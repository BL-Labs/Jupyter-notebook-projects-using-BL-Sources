The different revolutions which V nNlMr^ have distracted her since the establishment of nation- ality, together with the fact that the views and policy of each ruler were generally the very opposite of those of his predecessor, rendered it almost impossible for a neighbouring republic, whose foreign diplomacy had usually been stationary, to maintain strict amity. The war with Spain having drained the treasury, it became necessary to re plenish it by some extraordinary means ; and the various rulers, as they a 2 s"], [12, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 6 successively attained to power, understanding little of the laws of nations, and being always accustomed to raise money by seizure or impressment, now exercised their appropriating code to the capture of the property and vessels of other nations. From the relative situation of the United States, and the state of her commerce in the Gulf, she was particularly exposed to these outrages. \"Our citizens engaged in lawful commerce were im prisoned, their vessels seized, and our flag insulted in her ports. If money was wanted, the lawless seizure and confiscation of our merchant vessels and their cargoes were a ready resource ; and if, to accomplish their pur poses, it became necessary to imprison the owners, captains, or crews, it was done. In rapid succession rulers succeeded rulers, but still there was no change in the system of depredation. The government of the United States made repeated reclamations on behalf of its citizens, but these were answered by the perpetration of new outrages. Promises of redress made by Mexico in the most solemn forms were postponed or evaded. The files and records of the Department of State contain conclusive proofs of nume rous lawless acts, perpetrated upon the property and persons of our citi zens by Mexico, and of wanton insults to our national flag. The interpo sition of our government to obtain redress was again and again invoked, under circumstances which no nation ought to disregard. \"It was hoped that these outrages would cease, and that Mexico would be restrained by the laws which regulate the conduct of civilized nations in their intercourse with each other, after the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation of the 5th of April, 1831, was concluded between the two re publics; but this hope soon proved to be vain. The course of seizure and confiscation of the property of our citizens, the violation of their persons, and the insults to our flag pursued by Mexico previous to that time, were scarcely suspended for even a brief period, although the treaty so clearly defines the rights and duties of the respective parties, that it is impossible to misunderstand or mistake them.\"* It is not to be supposed that the United States could receive these in sults with impunity. Remonstrances were continually being made to the Mexican government for redress, and a removal of further causes of aggra vation. On account of the distracted state of her politics, it was not thought proper to appeal to \" the last resort\" of injured nations, and, accordingly, all the remonstrances of the aggrieved nation were marked with the spirit and tone of forbearance and magnanimity. Mexico did not appreciate this kindness. She even seemed to view it as a manifestation of weakness and pusillanimity on the part of her neighbours, and continued her unjust policy. In 1837, her aggressions had become so glaring, that Presi dent Jackson called the attention of Congress to them in the followino terms: \"The length of time since some of the injuries have been com- * President Polk's Message, December, 1846."], [13, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR 7 mitted, the repeated and unavailing applications for redress, the wanton character of some of the outrages upon the persons and property of our citizens, upon the officers and flag of the United States, inde pendent of recent insults to this government and people, by the late extraordinary Mexican minister, would justify in the eyes of all nations immediate war.\" Still desirous of avoiding this last and dteadful alterna tive, the President adds : \"It has occurred to me that, considering the present embarrassed condi tion of that country, we should act with both wisdom and moderation, by giving to Mexico one more opportunity of atoning for the past, before we take redress into our own hands. To avoid all misconception on the part of Mexico, as well as to protect our national character from reproach, this opportunity should be given with the avowed design and full preparation to take immediate satisfaction, if it should not be obtained on a repetition of the demand for it. To this end I recommend that an act be passed authorizing reprisals, and the use of the naval force of the United States, by the executive, against Mexico, to force them, in the event of a refusal by the Mexican government, to come to an amicable adjustment of the mat ters in controversy between us, upon another demand thereof made from on board of one of our vessels of war on the coast of Mexico.\"* I^Ss OTH houses of Congress fully concurred with the views gfnBj of the President concerning the enormities of Mexico, as g^pr well as in his plan for the prosecution of measures of \u25a0Jk?3[ redress. The report of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, IgJpw in the House of Representatives, has the following para \"The Committee fully concur with the President, that ample cause exists for taking redress into our own hands, and believe that we should be justified, in the opinion of other nations, for taking such a step. But they are willing to try the experiment of another demand, made in the most solemn form, upon the justice of the Mexican government, before any further proceedings are adopted.\" The similar committee of the Senate speak as follows: \" After such a demand, should prompt justice be refused by the Mexican government, we may appeal to all nations not only for the equity and moderation with which we shall have acted towards a sister republic, but for the necessity which will then compel us to seek redress for our wrongs, either by actual war or by reprisals. The subject will then be presented before Congress, at the commencement of the next session, in a clear and distinct form ; and the committee cannot doubt but that such measures will be immediately adopted as may be necessary to vindicate the honour of our country and insure ample reparation to our injured citizens.\" * Message, February, 1837."], [14, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 8 In consequence of these proceedings, a special messenger was despatched to Mexico, to make a final demand for redress ; and on the 20th of July, 1837, the demand was made. The reply of the Mexican government, dated on the 29th, contains assurances of the \" anxious wish not to delay the moment of that final and equitable adjustment which is to terminate the existing difficulties between the two governments;\" that \"nothing should be left undone which may contribute to the most speedy and equitable determination of the subjects which have so seriously engaged the atten tion of the American government;\" that \"the Mexican government would adopt, as the only guides for its conduct, the plainest principles of public right, the sacred obligations imposed by international law and the religious faith of treaties;\" and that \"whatever justice and reason may dictate respecting each case will be done.\" The decision of the Mexican govern ment upon each cause of complaint for which redress had been made, was also promised to be communicated to the government of the United Slates, through the Mexican minister at Washington. Notwithstanding this amicable appearance, reparation was not made by the Mexicans. President Van Buren, in his message of December 5th, 1837, uses the following language : \"Although the large number [of our demands for redress], and many of them aggravated cases of personal wrongs, have been now for years before the Mexican government, and some of the causes of national complaint, and those of the most offensive character, admitted of immediate, simple, and satisfactory replies, it is only within a few days past that any specific communication in answer to your last demand, made five months ago, has been received from the Mexican minister. ****** For not one of our public complaints has satisfaction been given or offered ; that but one of the cases of personal wrong has been favourably considered, and that but four cases of both descriptions, out of all those formally presented and earnestly pressed, have as yet been decided upon by the Mexican government. ****** On a careful and deliberative examina tion of the contents [of the correspondence with the Mexican government], and considering the spirit manifested by the Mexican government, it has become my painful duty to return the subject as it now stands, to Con gress, to whom it belongs, to decide upon the time, the mode, and the measure of redress.\" Notwithstanding the evidently belligerent disposition of the new presi dent, Congress did not think proper to declare war at that time, but entered into a new negotiation with Mexico. After unavoidable delay of more than a year, a convention of delegates met on the 11th of April, 1839, \"for the adjustment of claims of citizens of the United States of America upon the government of the Mexican republic.\" The joint board of commissioners created by this convention, to examine"], [15, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 9 and decide upon these claims, was not organized until the month of August, 1840. By the terms of the convention, they were to terminate their duties within eighteen months from that time ; but four months were consumed in preliminary discussions ; and it was not until December, 1840, that the main subject was entered into. The claims were found to be so numerous and difficult, that it was impossible to consider them all within the specified term, which expired in February, 1842. The claims which were allowed by the board, and by the umpire au thorized by the convention to decide in case of disagreement between the Mexican and American commissioners, amounted to $2,026,139 68. There were pending before the umpire, when the commission expired, additional claims which had been examined and awarded by the American commis sioner, and had not been allowed by the Mexican commissioner, amount ing to $928,627 88, upon which he did not decide, alleging that his authority had ceased with the termination of the joint commission. Besides these claims, there were others of American citizens, amounting to $3,336,837 05, which had been submitted to the board, and upon which they had not time to decide before their final adjournment. HE sum acknowledged by the con- vention was recognised by the Mexican government as a legal debt, but they asked a postpone- ment of the time of payment upon which the commissioners had agreed. This was agreed to, and, in the language of a second con- vention of the 30th of January, 1843, solely \"for the accommodation of Mexico.\" By the terms of this last convention, \" all the interests due on the awards which had been made in favour of the claimants, under the convention of the 11th of April, 1839, were to be paid to them on the 30th of April, 1843, and the principal of the said awards, and the interest accruing thereon, were stipulated to be paid in five years, in equal instalments every three months.\" Although the calling of this convention, and the terms adopted by it, had originated with Mexico, yet that power, either through inability or otherwise, did not meet the engagements thus imposed upon her. This led to proposals for calling a third convention, which was however post poned by the annexation of Texas, and the consequent war between the two countries. Before entering upon our main subject, it may not be improper to give a concise view of the political and civil history of the country which, by its union with our own, has occasioned a war between the two great re publics of North America. 2"], [16, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 10 By the treaty between France and England in 1803, Texas became a part of the United States, with the rest of the territory then known as Louisiana. By the Florida treaty of 1819, the United States ceded to Spain all that part of the territory within the present limits of Texas ; and Mexico, by the revolution which separated her from Spain, and rendered her an independent nation, succeeded to the rights of the mother country over it. The whole region formed the principal part of the ancient de partment of Tamaulipas. In the year 1824, Mexico established a federal constitution, under which the republic was divided into a number of sovereign states, confederated into a federal union similar to our own. Each of these states had its own executive, legislature and judiciary, and, for all except federal purposes, was as independent of the general government, and that of each of the other states, as is Pennsylvania or Virginia under our Constitution. Texas and Coahuila united and formed one of these Mexican states. The state con stitution which they adopted, and which was approved by the Mexican confederacy, asserted that they were free and independent of the other Mexican states, and of every other power and dominion whatsoever ; and proclaimed the great principle of human liberty, that \"The sovereignty of the state resides originally and essentially in the general mass of the indi viduals who compose it.\" Emigrants from the United States and other countries were invited, by the colonization laws, to settle in Texas, and many, profiting by the invita tion, settled upon its fertile fields, and in a short time formed a population wholly different in principles and pursuits from their southern neigh bours. In the year 1835, a military revolution broke out in the city of Mexico, which entirely subverted file federal and state constitutions, and placed a military dictator at the head of the government. Under his jurisdiction a decree of Congress abolished the state constitutions, established a Central Republic, and converted each state into a dependent department. The people of Texas remonstrated against this measure as unconstitutional and tyrannical ; and their remonstrance being disregarded, they arose in open resistance. Several small battles were fought, and with various success, until the 21st of April, 1836, when an army of Texan citizens and soldiers under General Samuel Houston defeated the Mexican dictator, Santa Anna, on the plains of San Jacinto. This battle was decisive. Santa Anna was taken prisoner, and the Mexican army entirely incapacitated for fur ther offensive operations in Texas. While a captive in the United States, the dictator signed a treaty in which he stipulated the complete independ ence of Texas, but this treaty was disapproved of by the Mexican govern ment, and that country still declared a part of Mexico. The distracted state of the latter country, however, prevented her from carrying out her"], [17, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 11 GENERAL O U S T 0 N. intended subjugation, and the independence of Texas was soon acknow ledged by all Christian nations. As early as 1836, the inhabitants of Texas expressed their wish, in a general election, to be annexed to the United States ; and in the following November their republican Congress authorized the appointment of a minister to bear their request to the sister government. The United States, however, rejected the proposal at that time. On the 12th of April, 1844, during the administration of President Tyler, a treaty of annexation was signed by joint commissioners, but rejected by the United States Senate. Finally, on the 1st of March, 1845, our Congress passed a joint resolution for annexation, upon certain preli minary conditions, to which the assent of Texas was required. The solemnities which characterized the deliberations and conduct of the government and people of Texas, on the deeply interesting questions pre sented by this resolution, are well known. The executive Congress and people of that country accepted the proposed terms of annexation in a convention appointed for the purpose ; and thus was consummated the important act, which not only restored to our government the vast territory formerly ceded to Spain by the Florida treaty, but which, in its conse-"], [18, "12 COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. quences, has been productive of the gravest results to all the nations immediately concerned. During the whole proceedings pending this negotiation, the Mexican nation had opposed the course of the United States, and formally protested against it. After the joint resolution had been passed by Congress, the Mexican minister at Washington addressed a note to the American secretary of state, dated 6th of March, 1845, pro testing against it as \"an act of aggression, the most unjust which can be found recorded in the annals of modern history ; namely, that of despoil ing a friendly nation, like Mexico, of a considerable portion of her terri tory.\" He also protested against the resolution of annexation, as being an act \"whereby the province of Texas, an integral portion of the Mexi can territory, is agreed and admitted into the American Union,\" announc ing that, as a consequence, his mission to the United States had terminated, and demanded his passports. These were granted, and he returned to Mexico. Things continued in this unpropitious condition until September, when President Polk authorized the secretary of state to inquire of the Mexican government, through the United States consul at Mexico, if it would be willing to receive an American envoy, entrusted with ample powers to terminate all difficulties. The inquiry was made, and on the 15th of October, the Mexican minister of foreign affairs addressed a note to the consul, containing a favourable response, but requesting that the American naval force might be withdrawn from Vera Cruz while negotiations should be pending. This request was complied with, and a minister with full powers sent to Mexico. He reached Vera Cruz on the 30th of Novem ber, 1845, but had the disappointment of finding that the politics of the country had undergone a change unfavourable to the United States. Pre sident Herrera, who had ever been favourable to peace, was opposed by a strong faction, under General Paredes, who founded his rebellion princi pally upon the assertion that Herrera, by consenting to receive a minister of peace from the United States, intended to dismember the territory of Mexico, by ceding to a hostile country the department of Texas. Prior to this revolution, the government of Herrera is believed to have been well disposed to a pacific adjustment of difficulties ; but, probably alarmed for its own security and destiny, to ward off the danger threatened by Pare des, it adopted the unhappy course of refusing to receive the minister, although it had stipulated to do so. The principal reason assigned for this policy was, that the minister had not come upon a special mission, con fined alone to the Texas question, but that his duties also included a con sideration of the long-disputed outrages upon the flag and citizens of his country. On the 30th of December, 1845, General Herrera resigned the presi dency, and General Paredes assumed the government without opposition."], [19, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 13 On the 1st of March following, the American envoy addressed a note to the Mexican minister of foreign affairs, requesting him to present his cre dentials to the new government, in order that he might be accredited in the diplomatic character in which he had been commissioned. On the 12th, he received an answer refusing his request, and, in consequence, he demanded his passports, and returned to the United States. While this negotiation was going forward, other and different operations were in progress. Anticipating war, the President of the United States \u25a0was organizing a force to be sent into Texas, to defend that country in case of an invasion, or to invade Mexico, should war be declared. Of this measure the President speaks thus in his annual message of Decem ber, 1845 : \" Both the congress and the convention of the people of Texas invited this government to send an army into their territory to protect and defend them against a menaced attack. The moment the terms of annexation, offered by the United States, were accepted by Texas, the latter became so far a part of our country as to make it our duty to afford such protection and defence. I, therefore, deemed it proper, as a precautionary measure, to order a strong squadron to the coasts of Mexico, and to concentrate an efficient military force on the western frontier of Texas. Our army was ordered to take positions in the country between the Neuces and the Del Norte, and to repel any invasion of the Texan territory which might be attempted by the Mexican forces. \" Our squadron in the Gulf was ordered to co-operate with the army. But, though our army and navy were placed in a position to defend our own and the rights of Texas, they were ordered to commit no act of hos tility against Mexico, unless she declared war, or was herself the aggres sor by striking the first blow.\" Of the organization of this force, he speaks as follows : \" When orders were given, during the past summer, for concentrating a military force on the western frontier of Texas, our troops were widely dispersed, and in small detachments, occupying posts remote from each other. The prompt and expeditious manner in which an army, embracing more than half of our peace establishment, was drawn together, on an emer gency so sudden, reflects great credit on the officers who were intrusted with the execution of these orders, as well as upon the discipline of the army itself.\" The important duty of appointing a commander-in-chief to this army was next to be attended to. General Gaines was the superior officer of that section, but for some reasons not well understood, he was overlooked, and at the suggestion of General Scott, General Zachary Taylor was appointed. Accordingly, on the 21st of March, 1845, orders were despatched to that offi- B"], [20, "14 COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. cer, then at Fort Jessup, in Louisiana, to prepare the forces at that placfl, and have them in readiness to march into Texas as soon as commanded. HE resolutions for the annexation of Texas had passed the United States Congress on the 3d of March, but had not yet been adopted by the Texan government. As the President, how ever, considered that there would be no opposi tion to them by that body, he issued further orders, through Mr. Marcy, Secretary of State, dated the 28th of May, and directing General Taylor, \" by order of the President, to cause the forces now under your command, and those which may be assigned to it, to be put in a position where they may most promptly and efficiently act in the defence of Texas, in the event it should become necessary or proper to employ them for that purpose.\" On the 15th of June, other instructions were given by Mr. Bancroft, act ing secretary, in the absence of Mr. Marcy. As this paper is highly im portant, in consequence of defining the exact position laid down to General Taylor by the government, we give it in full : \" [Confidential.\"] \"War Department, June 15, 1845. \" Sir, \u2014 On the 4th day of July, or very soon thereafter, the convention of the people of Texas will probably accept the proposition of annexation, under the joint resolution of the late Congress of the Uhited States. That acceptance will constitute Texas an integral portion of our country. \"In anticipation of that event, you will forthwith make a forward move ment with the troops under your command, and advance to the mouth of the Sabine, or to such other points on the Gulf of Mexico, or its navigable waters, as in your judgment may be most convenient for an embarkation, at the proper time, for the western frontier of Texas. ***** The point of your ultimate destination is the western frontier of Texas, where you will select and occupy, in or near the Rio Grande del Norte, such a site as will consist with the health of your troops, and will be best adapted to repel invasion, and to protect what, in the event of annexation, will be our western border. You will limit yourself to the defence of the territory of Texas, unless Mexico should declare war against the United States. \" Your movement to the Gulf of Mexico, and your preparations to embark for the western frontier of Texas, are to be made without delay ; hut you will not effect a landing on that frontier, until you have yourself ascertained the due acceptance by Texas, of the proffered terms of annex ation.\""], [21, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 15 These instructions were somewhat modified by the following language of Mr. Marcy, addressed to General Taylor, under date of the 8th of July. \" This department is informed that Mexico has some military establish ments on the east side of the Rio Grande, which are, and for some time have been in the actual occupancy of her troops. In carrying out the in structions heretofore received, you will be careful to avoid any acts of aggression unless an actual war should exist. The Mexican forces, at the posts in their possession, and which have been so, will not be disturbed, as long as the relations of peace between the United States and Mexico con tinue.\" On the 20th of July, General Taylor acknowledges the receipt of this letter, and expresses his gratification at the instructions it contained, \" as they confirm,\" says he, \"my views previously communicated, in regard to the proper line to be occupied at present by our troops ; those instruc tions will be closely followed, and the department may rest assured, that I will take no step to interrupt the friendly relations between the United States and Mexico.\" On the 30th, the General was still further instructed as follows : \" War Department, Washington, 30th July. \" He (the President) has not the requisite information in regard to the country, to enable him to give any positive directions as to the position you ought to take, or the movements which it may be expedient to make ; these must be governed by circumstances. While avoiding, as you have been instructed to do, all aggressive measures towards Mexico, as long as the relations of peace exist between that republic and the United States, you are expected to occupy, protect, and defend the territory of Texas, to the extent that it has been occupied by the people of Texas. The Rio Grande is claimed to be the boundary between the two countries, and up to this boundary you are to extend your protection, only excepting any posts on the eastern side thereof, which are in the actual occupancy of Mexican forces, or Mexican settlements, over which the republic of Texas did not exercise jurisdiction at the time of annexation, or shortly before that event. It is expected that, in selecting the establishment for your troops, you will approach as near the boundary line, the Rio Grande, as prudence will dictate. With this view the President desires that your position, for part of your forces at least, should be west of the Nueces.\" On the 6th of August, the adjutant-general stated, that the seventh in fantry and three companies of dragoons were ordered to join General Taylor in Texas, \" for,\" says the letter, \" although a state of war with Mexico, or an invasion of Texas, by her forces may not take place, it is nevertheless deemed proper and necessary that your forces should be fully equal to meet, with certainty of success, any crisis which may arise in Texas, and which would"], [22, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 16 require you by force of arms to carry out the instructions of the govern ment.\" The letter further called upon General Taylor to report what aux iliary troops, in case of an emergency, he could rely upon from Texas, and \" what additional troops, designating the arms, and what supply and description of ordnance, ordnance stores, small arms, &c, judging from any information you may possess as to the future exigencies of the public service,\" he (General Taylor) might deem necessary to be sent into Texas ; informing him at the same time that ten thousand muskets and one thou sand rifles had already been issued for Texas. During all this time the movements and intentions of Mexico remained, to a great degree, wrapped in obscurity. She was known to be most bit terly opposed to the course of the United States, respecting Texas : it was also pretty evident that she would not be willing to accede to the annexa tion without a struggle to prevent it ; and in addition, the president was the avowed enemy of the United States, and had gained his elevation from an uncompromising declaration of his principles. But whether the civil and political state of the country would enable the government to raise an army, and if so, whether it would so far confide in its strength as to risk a war with the United States, were utterly unknown. Under this embarrass ing state of affairs, the secretary of war wrote to General Taylor, on the 23d of August, further instructions, from which we select the following : \"The information hitherto received as to the intentions of Mexico, and the measures she may adopt, does not enable the administration here to give you more explicit instructions in regard to your movements, than those which have already been forwarded to you. There is reason to believe that Mexico is making efforts to assemble a large army on the frontier of Texas, for the purpose of entering its territory and holding forcible posses sion of it. Of their movements you are doubtless advised, and we trust have taken, or early will take, prompt and efficient steps to meet and repel any such hostile incursion. Should Mexico assemble a large body of troops on the Rio Grande, and cross it with considerable force, such a movement must be regarded as an invasion of the United States, and the commence ment of hostilities. You will, of course, use all the authority which has been or may be given you to meet such a state of things. Texas must be protected from hostile invasion, and for that purpose you will, of course, employ to the utmost extent all the means you possess or can command. \" An order has this day been issued for sending one thousand more men into Texas to join those under your command. When the existing orders are carried into effect, you will have with you a force of four thousand men of the regular army. We are not enabled to judge what auxiliary force can, upon an emergency, be brought together from Texas, and, as a precautionary measure, you are authorized to accept volunteers from the states of Louisiana and Alabama, and even from Mississippi, Tennessee,"], [23, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 17 and Kentucky. Should Mexico declare war, or commence hostilities by crossing the Rio Grande with a considerable force, you are instructed to lose no time in giving information to the authorities of each or any of the above-mentioned states as to the number of volunteers you may want of them respectively. Should you require troops from any of these states, it would be important to have them without the least possible delay. It is not doubted that at least two regiments from New Orleans, and one from Mobile, could be obtained and expeditiously brought into the field. You will cause it to be known at these places, what number and description of troops you desire to receive from them in the contemplated emergency. The authorities of these states will be apprized that you are authorized to receive volunteers from them, and you may calculate that they will promptly join you when it is made known that their services are required. Arms, ammunition, and camp equipage for the auxiliary troops that you may require, will be sent forward subject to your orders. You will so dispose of them as to be most available in case they should be needed, at the same time with a due regard to their safety and preservation. Orders have been issued to the naval force in the Gulf of Mexico to co-operate with you. You will, as far as practicable, hold communication with the commanders of our national vessels in your vicinity, and avail yourself of any assistance that can be derived from their co-operation. The Lexington is ordered into service as a transport ship, and will sail in a few days from New York, with a detachment of United States troops for Corpus Christi. She will be employed as the exigency of the public service may require. In order to keep up a proper communication between the army in Texas and the United States, the On-ka-hy-e, the Harney, and the Dolphin will be put into service as soon as they can be made ready as despatch vessels to convey intelligence, supplies, &c. You will avail yourself of these vessels, and all other proper means, to keep the government here advised of your operations, and the state of things in Texas and Mexico.\" In the same month, General Taylor, having concentrated his forces, marched for Texas, where he soon arrived and took up a position at Corpus Christi. On the 13th of January, orders to move from thjs place were issued : we give the reasons in the President's own words : \u2014 \"Instructions have been issued to the general in command, to occupy the left bank of the Del Norte. This river, which is the south-western bound ary of the state of Texas, is an exposed frontier ; from this quarter inva sion was threatened ; upon it and in its immediate vicinity, in the judg ment of high military experience, are the proper stations for the protecting forces of the government. In addition to this important consideration, seve ral others have occurred to induce this movement. Among these are the facilities afforded by the ports at Brazos Santiago and the mouth of the Del Norte, for the reception of supplies by sea; the stronger and more 3 B2"], [24, "18 COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. healthful military positions ; the convenience for obtaining a ready and a more abundant supply of provisions, water, fuel, and forage ; and the ad vantages which are afforded by the Del Norte, in forwarding supplies to such ports as may be established in the interior and upon the Indian fron- tier.\" Pursuant to these instructions, the army left Corpus Christi on the 11th of March, and moved westward toward the Rio Grande. Their march was slow, and in it they encountered the most frightful difficulties. The country is the southern portion of the great American desert, which is almost entirely destitute of water, and literally filled with every variety of venemous insect and reptile, which render a march through it almost in sufferably annoying and dangerous. Besides this, the heat of the soil parched the feet of the soldiers, and rendered it extremely difficult for ar tillery to proceed at all. The soldiers, however, bore all without murmur ing; a fact the more creditable to them as they were almost entirely new recruits. On the 20th, the general reached the Arroyo Colorado, a salt lagoon or river, about thirty miles east of the Rio Grande. Here he per ceived that a small force of stragglers and soldiers was drawn up on the other bank with a view to oppose his passage ; and soon after he was waited upon by a delegation from their cavalry, informing him, that if he persisted in crossing the stream, it would be considered a declaration of War. The general now placed his army in order of battle, and sent a party to open a passage to the beach. At the same time notice was given to General Mejia, the bearer of the Mexican communication, that the enemy would be fired upon in case of opposing the intended crossing. The artil lery were placed so as to cover the ford, all the port-fires lighted, and the passage commenced. Strange to say, no sign of resistance was offered by the enemy, notwithstanding that the point of landing was one which af forded most excellent opportunities to make such resistance successful. N the 22d, the march was resumed, the army moving on slowly towards Matamoras. It halted on the 24th, in consequence of General Taylor having received information that the Mexicans had taken possession of Point Isabel on the Brazos Santiago. This had been selected by the General as a convenient site to establish a depot for his stores, and thereby keep up a constant intercourse both by land and water, with the position which he intended to fortify on the Rio Grande. He determined, therefore, to leave the main body of his army on the Matamoras road, and push forward to Point Isabel without delay. When near this place with his dragoons, he was met by a delegation of citizens, who through the Prefect of the Department of Ta-"], [25, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 19 maulipas, protested against the march of an American army into a coun try claimed by Mexico. The General was replying, when some troops announced that the station was on fire. He therefore postponed his an swer until the army should have arrived before Matamoras, and despatched the dragoons under Colonel Twiggs to stop the conflagration. The bar racks and a few public buildings had been fired, but the perpetrators, to gether with citizens and military, had fled. The Colonel succeeded in saving some property, and he was soon after joined by General Taylor, who immediately gave orders to fortify the place. Major John Munroe was intrusted with the command. He had with him two companies of artillery, consisting of about four hundred and fifty men, with six brass six-pounders, two long eighteens and two ship's guns ; and the fort was amply provided with provisions, powder and ball. Having completed these arrangements, the commander departed to join the main army, which, under General Worth, had encamped a few miles from the junction of the Matamoras with the Point Isabel road. The whole army then moved forward to the Rio Grande, where it arrived on the 28th, and planted the United States flag on the bank opposite Matamoras. It is worthy of notice, that during the whole course of this march, as well as while the army was at Corpus Christi, General Taylor took great pains to impress upon the people and authorities, that he was not advanc ing as an enemy, nor to make war upon Mexico, but solely to assert the right of the United States to Texas up to the Rio Grande, including the free navigation of that river \u2014 free alike to Mexicans and Americans. The protest of the Prefect of Tamaulipas and the warning at the Arroyo Colo rado, had led to no ill words or ill conduct, and thus far all was bloodless. Two dragoons, who, on the approach of General Taylor towards Mata moras, had fallen into the hands of the Mexicans, were upon requisition re turned to him, and notwithstanding the commotion which his encampment over against Matamoras naturally excited there, no acts of hostility were perpetrated. The appearance of the country in which the Americans were now encamped is thus described by an eye-witness: \"Tamaulipas, in which we are encamped, is a beautiful, a delightful region. Far as the eye can reach, one level surface presents itself to view, dotted with cotton and sugar-cane fields, interspersed with lovely gardens after the Spanish fashion, the whole cut up and divided in all sorts of ways by groves of the finest trees, among which the lignum vit\u00e6 figures largely ; and the entire picture is cut in twain by the muddiest, crookedest, and swiftest river in North America. Neither mountain, hill, nor elevation of any sort, varies the everlasting level of the country around. The scene is rich and peaceful, with nought to mar its appropriate cha racter, save the armies of two nations. Our nights here, for the most part, are remarkable for their serenity. The stars stand forth in numerous"], [26, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR 20 crowds, with rare brilliancy ; not a leaf is moved, not a cloud is seen ; while ever and anon, a meteor of surpassing brightness shoots across the azure vault.\" On the 23d of April, President Paredes issued a proclamation to the people of Mexico, from which we extract the following : \"At the time Mr. Slidell presented himself, the troops of the United States occupied our territory, their squadrons threatened our ports, and they prepared to occupy the peninsula of the Californias, of which the question of Oregon with England is only a preliminary. Mr. S. was not received, because the dignity of the nation repelled this new insult. Meanwhile the army of the United States encamped at Corpus Christi, and occupied the Isla del Padre; following this, they then moved to the Point Santa Isabel, and their standard of the stars and stripes waved on the right bank of the Rio Bravo del Norte, opposite the city of Matamoras, blockading that river with their vessels of war. The village of Laredo was surprised by a party of their troops, and a small party of our men, reconnoitering there, were disarmed. Hostilities, then, have been com menced by the United States of North America, beginning new conquests upon the frontier territories of the departments of Tamaulipas and New Leon, and progressing at such a rate, that troops of the same United States threaten Monterey, in Upper California. No one can doubt which of the two republics is responsible for this war ; a war which any sense of equity and justice, and respect for the rights and laws of civilized na tions, might have avoided. I have commanded the general-in-chief of our forces on the northern frontier to repel all hostilities offered to us, which is actual war against any power making war on us, and calling upon the God of battles, he will preserve the valour of our troops, the unquestion able right to our territory, and the honour of those arms which are used only in defence of justice. Our general will govern himself by the esta blished usages of civilized warfare. With orders from me to prevent, if possible, the effusion of blood, he will intimate to the general-in-chief of the American troops that he shall return to the other side of the Rio de las Nueces, the ancient limits of Texas. Those nations interested in preserving the peace of so many years, and who may be injured in their commercial relations with the Mexican republic, will perceive the hard alternative to which they are reduced by the politic invasion of the United States, and they [the nations] must succumb or defend their existence thus compromised. I solemnly announce that I do not declare war against the United States of America, because it pertains to the august Congress of that nation, and not to the Executive, to settle definitely the reparation which so many aggressions demand. \" But the defence of the Mexican territory, which the United States troops invade, is an urgent necessity, and my responsibility would be"], [27, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 21 immense before the nation if I did not give commands to repel those forces who act like enemies, and I have so commanded. From this day com mences a defensive war, and those points of our territory which are invaded or attacked will be energetically defended.\" On the arrival of the American army opposite Matamoras, General Worth and his staff were ordered to cross the river in order to bear despatches to the commanding officer and civil authorities. He did so, and was met by a Mexican delegation, bearing a white flag, of whom he requested an interview with 'the authorities. After some delay, this was granted. The Mexican officers present were General La Vega, the Licenciado Censores, Juan N. Garza, and an interpreter. The reception of the despatches was refused, as was also permission for an interview with the American consul. HE Mexicans now suppressed all correspondence with the Ameri- can army, and a gloomy anxiety, the pause that precedes the storm, announced that the two nations had met for the first time as ene- mies. Meanwhile General Tay- lor was busy in throwing up intrenchments and fortifying his position. Fifteen hundred men were constantly employed on these works, labouring day and night with the most indefatigable persever ance. In the early part of April, the following proclamation was secretly dis tributed in the American camp. It is an ingenious appeal to a class of citizens, who appeared to its wily author as the most proper subjects for the principles contained in it. The Commander-in-chief of the Mexican Army, to the English and Irish under the orders of the American General Taylor: Know ye : That the government of the United States is committing repeated acts of barbarous aggression against the magnanimous Mexican nation ; that the government which exists under \" the flag of the stars,\" is unworthy of the designation of Christian. Recollect that you were born in Great Britain ; that the American government looks with coldness upon the powerful flag of St. George, and is provoking to a rupture the warlike people to whom it belongs ; President Polk boldly mani festing a desire to take possession of Oregon, as he has already done of Texas. Now, then, come with all confidence to the Mexican ranks ; and I guaranty to you, upon my honour, good treatment, and that all your"], [28, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 22 expenses shall be defrayed until your arrival in the beautiful capital of Mexico. Germans, French, Poles, and individuals of other nations ! Separate yourselves from the Yankees, and do not contribute to defend a robbery and usurpation which, be assured, the civilized nations of Europe look upon with the utmost indignation. Come, therefore, and array yourselves under the tri-coloured flag, in the confidence that the God of armies pro tects it, and that it will protect you equally with the English. Head-quarters, upon the road to Matamoras, April 2, 1846. Pedro de Ampudia. Francisco R. Moreno, Adj't of the Commander-in-chief. REVIOUS to this a number of desertions had happened in the American camp. Several of the soldiers escaped to Matamoras, where they were favourably received by the Mexicans, and some of them even treated with distinguished honour. In order to abolish so dangerous a practice, orders were issued to shoot every one ; who should leave his lines, and several were I thus put to death. The position of General Taylor at this period may be gathered from the following extract of one of his letters \" Strong guards of foot and mounted men are established on the margin of the river, and thus efficient means have been adopted on our part to prevent all intercourse. While opposite to us, their pickets extend above and below for several miles, and we are equally active in keeping up a strong and vigilant guard to prevent surprise or attacks under disadvan tageous circumstances. This is the more necessary whilst we have to act on the defensive, and they are at liberty to take the opposite course when ever they are disposed to do so. Nor have we been idle in other respects : we have a field-work under way, besides having erected a strong battery and a number of buildings for the security of our supplies, in addition to some respectable works for their protection. We have mounted a respectable battery, two pieces of which are long eighteen-pounders, with which we could batter or burn down the city of Matamoras, should it become neces sary to do so. When our field-work is completed, (which will soon be the case,) and mounted with its proper armament, five hundred men could hold it against as many thousand Mexicans. During the twenty-seven days since our arrival here, a most singular state of things has prevailed all through the outlines of the two armies, which, to a certain extent, have all the feelings as if there were actual war. \" Fronting each other for an extent of more than two miles, and"], [29, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 23 within musket range, are batteries shotted, and the officers and men, in many instances, waiting impatiently for orders to apply the matches, yet nothing has been done to provoke the firing of a gun, or any act of violence. \" Matamoras, at the distance we are now from it, appears to cover a large extent of ground, with some handsome buildings ; but I would imagine the greater portion of them to be indifferent, one-storied houses, with roofs of straw, and walls of mud, or unburnt brick. During peace, the population is said to be five or six thousand, but it is now filled to overflowing with troops. Report says from five to ten thousand of all sorts, regular and militia. \" Since writing the above, an engagement has taken place between a detachment of our cavalry and the Mexicans, in which we were worsted. So the war has actually commenced.\" Under these circumstances, General Taylor made the following requisi tion for troops on the Governor of Louisiana, according to authority pre viously granted him by President Polk : Head-quarters, Army of Occupation, Camp near Matamoras, April 26, 1846. Sir, \u2014 I have the honour to apprize you that hostilities have actually commenced between my forces and those of the Mexicans, and that I have need of the services of a considerable number of volunteers. Four regi ments have been called from Texas, but as there will be considerable delay in assembling them here, and as my further operations will require still stronger force, I have the honour, under the authority of the War Depart ment, to call upon the state of Louisiana for four regiments of infantry, to be ordered into service with the utmost despatch, and for the longest period authorized by law. I shall communicate immediately with General Gaines, and request him to give you every facility in the organization and equipment of these troops, and forwarding them to Point Isabel. I subjoin the organization of a regi ment of volunteers, and respectfully desire that it may be observed, and that the number of prescribed officers be not exceeded. The battalions may be mustered into service at New Orleans, or at Point Isabel, as most convenient. I beg that they may be sent forward as rapidly as they can be raised. I would suggest that a brigadier-general be commissioned to command the force called from Louisiana; and, from my experience of his excellent qualities as an officer, I would be particularly gratified if General Persifor F. Smith could be selected for such appointment. I cannot doubt that the gallant state of Louisiana will respond with alacrity to this call upon the patriotism of her sons ; and I feel assured that"], [30, "24 COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. no effort will be wanting, on the part of the state authorities, to organize the force and have it in readiness to embark at the earliest practical mo- ment. I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant, Z. Taylor, Bt. Brigadier-General U. S. A. Commanding. Hon. Isaac Johnson, Governor of Louisiana, New Orleans, La. On the 10th of April, Colonel Truman Cross rode out in the morning to take his customary exercise. As the day wore away, and he did not re turn, fears began to arise for his safety, and scouts were sent out in order to ascertain, if possible, his fate. Their search being unsuccessful, Gene ral Taylor wrote to the Commandant of Matamoras, who, however, dis claimed all connection or knowledge of his disappearance. On the 21st, a Mexican straggler came into camp, and reported that he knew where was the body of an American soldier. He was followed, and a corpse was found among some bushes, which was recognised as the re mains of the late colonel. There can be no doubt that he was murdered by some of the wandering rancheros, or brigands, acting without consent or knowledge of the Mexican army. An officer of the army thus relates the circumstances attending the recovery of the body: HE remains were found a short distance from a road [ leading near the river, and not on the Point Isabel 1 road, as formerly stated. He was stripped of his I clothing, and the flesh was picked off his body by j the vultures. He had been dragged some distance ! into the thicket after the murder. It was recog ! nised to be the body of Colonel Cross by his teeth, a part of his scalp, which had been torn off by the vultures, his stock, and one of the straps from the shoulder of his military frock-coat. His watch, his pistols, and his horse are now in possession of the Mexican officers in Matamoras. The same writer states that \"Colonel Cross was killed by one Romano Falcon in the presence of a lieutenant of the Mexican army.\" This, how ever, is extremely doubtful. Upon the recovery of the body, the following order was issued by Gene ral Taylor : Head-quarters, Army of Occupation, Camp near Matamoras, April 25, 1846. The commanding general has the painful duty of announcinc to the army, that the doubt which has so long prevailed, in regard to the fate of the late Colonel Cross has at length, been resolved into the melancholy"], [31, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 25 certainty of his death, and, there is too much reason to fear, by violent hands. The high rank of the deceased, and the ability and energy which he carried into the discharge of the important duties of his office, will cause his loss to be severely felt in the service, while the untoward circumstances of his demise will render it peculiarly afflicting to his family and personal friends. The remains of the late colonel will be interred with military honours, at 4 o'clock, P. M., to-morrow. The funeral escort will be composed of a squadron of dragoons and eight companies of infantry ; the whole to be organized and commanded by Colonel Twiggs. The necessary arrangements for the funeral ceremonies will be made by Lieutenant-colonel Payne, inspector-general. All officers off duty are respectfully invited to attend the funeral. By order of Brigadier-general Taylor. (Signed,) W. W. S. Bliss, Assistant Adjutant-general. This melancholy event is thus noticed by one of our leading Journals :* \" War is a horrible evil. The news of the death of the first victim in this new war into which our country is plunged, has brought with it a deepening sense of the evils inseparable from the mad conflict of man with man, be the occasion what it may. An acquaintance, formed in early life \u2014 a warm and steadfast friend from the commencement of that acquaintance \u2014 a generous, open-hearted, ardent, intelligent, and talented man \u2014 one who was in all attributes a man among men \u2014 is the first victim.

His son is snatched from our hopes, as well as from a wide circle of friends, and from his own wife, now widowed and left with her orphans to a life \u2014 how desolate and lonely ! WTreaths may encircle the brow of victors in the coming contest, but what shall compen sate for sufferings of which this is but the type, of what must be the price at which they are purchased ?\" On the 11th, General Ampudia arrived in Matamoras with a large army. He had been appointed to supersede General Arista, and his entrance was hailed by every demonstration of joy on the part of both citizens and sol diery. The Americans expected an early attack, but, instead of this, a messenger reached General Taylor on the following day with a despatch, of which we give a translation. * Niles's National Register. C"], [32, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 26 Fourth Military Division, General-in-chief. To explain to you the many grounds for the just grievances felt by the Mexican nation, caused by the United States government, would be a loss of time, and an insult to your good sense ; I, therefore, pass at once to such explanations as I consider of absolute necessity. Your government, in an incredible manner \u2014 you will even permit me to say an extravagant one, if the usage or general rules established and received among all civilized nations are regarded \u2014 has not only insulted, but has ex asperated the Mexican naiton, bearing its conquering banner to the Rio Bravo del Norte ; and in this case, by explicit and definite orders of my government, which neither can, will, nor should receive new outrages, / require you, in all form, and at latest in the peremptory term of twenty-four hours, to break up your camp and retire to the other bank of the river, while our governments are regulating the pending question in relation to Texas. If you insist in remaining upon the soil of the department of Tamau lipas, it will clearly result that arms, and arms alone, must decide the question ; and in that case, / advise you that we accept the war to which, with so much injustice on your part, you provoke us, and that, on our part, this war shall be conducted conformably to the principles established by the most civilized nations : that is to say, that the law of nations and of war shall be the guide of my operations ; trusting, that, on your part, the same will be observed. WTith this view, I tender the consideration due to your person and respectable office. God and liberty ! Head-quarters at Matamoras, 2 o'clock, P. M., April 12, 1846. Pedro D'Ampudia. Senor General-in-chief of the United States army, Don Z. Taylor. To this epistle, General Taylor replied in the following note : Head-quarters, Army of Occupation, Camp near Matamoras, Texas, April 12, 1846. Senor, \u2014 I have had the honour to receive your note of this date, in which you summon me to withdraw the forces under my command from their present position, and beyond the river Nueces, until the pending question between our governments, relative to the limits of Texas, shall be settled. I need hardly advise you, that, charged as I am, in only a mili tary capacity, with the performance of specific duties, I cannot enter into a discussion of the international question involved in the advance of the American army. You will, however, permit me to say that the govern ment of the United States has constantly sought a settlement, by neo-otia tion, of the question of boundary ; that an envoy was despatched to Mexico for that purpose, and that up to the most recent dates said envoy had not"], [33, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 27 been received by the actual Mexican government, if indeed he has not received his passports and left the republic. In the mean time, I have been ordered to occupy the country up to the left bank of the Rio Grande, until the boundary shall be definitely settled. In carrying out these in structions, I have carefully abstained from all acts of hostility, obeying, in this regard, not only the letter of my instructions, but the plain dictates of justice and humanity. The instructions under which I am acting will not permit me to retrograde from the position I now occupy. In view of the relations between our respect ive governments, and the individual suffering which may result, I regret the alternative which you offer; but, at the same time, wish it understood that I shall by no means avoid such alternative, leaving the responsibility with those who rashly commence hostilities. In conclusion, you will permit me to give you the assurance that, on my part, the laws and customs of war among civilized nations shall be carefully observed. I have the honour to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, Z. Taylor. Sr. Gen. D. Pedro de Ampudia. Notwithstanding the peremptory assertions of General Ampudia, the specified time expired without being followed by any occurrence of interest. On the 17th, the American army lost another promising officer in the person of Lieutenant Porter, who was killed by a party of Mexicans, while endeavouring to find the body of Colonel Cross. The particulars of this affair are thus given in a letter from an officer in Taylor's camp : \" Lieutenant Dobbins, 3d infantry, and Lieutenant Porter of the 4th, left camp on the 17th instant, each with a detachment of two non-commissioned officers and ten privates, to reconnoitre the surrounding country, from ten to twenty miles, in search of a band of robbers known to have been in that vicinity, and who were supposed to have murdered Colonel Cross, and also to learn, if possible, something of his fate. The two parties took dif ferent directions, it raining hard during the night. On the second day Lieutenant Porter met a party of Mexicans, one of whom snapped his piece at him. In return he discharged both barrels of his gun at the Mexi can, who disappeared in the thorny thicket. The Americans captured the camp of the marauders, ten horses, saddles, &c. \"This was at noon of the 19th, about eighteen miles above General Tay lor's camp, and six from the Rio del Norte. The lieutenant continued his search, and about 4 P. M. of the same day, fell in with another party of Mexicans, which, probably, had been joined by those whom he had already left. It was now raining heavily. The Americans were fired on and one"], [34, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 28 of their privates killed. They made an attempt to return the fire, but their powder had been wetted, and they were exposed to the full range of the enemy without the ability to defend themselves. The lieutenant, as was reported by his serjeant, made a sign with his hand for his men to extend to the rioht. The parly thus became separated in the thickets. The sergeant and four privates returned to camp on the 20th, and gave the above account. DETACHMENT of thirty dragoons was despatched early the next morning to reconnoitre the position, and search for Lieutenant Porter and those of his party who were missing. They returned the same night, without having learned any thing of them, the thickets being so dense that it was impossible for horses to move through them. They, however, fell in with Lieutenant Dobbins, who said that he would continue to look for Lieu tenant Porter a day or two longer. The next day, about noon, the corporal and three men of the lieutenant's party returned, saying that they feared he had been killed. One of them stated that he had seen him fall from his horse ; and another, that he dismounted and staggered towards a thicket while volleys of musketry were poured around him.\" A letter, dated the 24th, gives the following additional particulars : \" The whole of Lieutenant Porter's party have returned to camp, except himself and the soldier who was killed by the first fire of the Mex icans in the rencounter of the 19th. Private Arns, who came in last of the company, states that he was within five or six feet of Lieutenant Por ter when he fell. He received a ball which penetrated his thigh, and no doubt parted the artery. He immediately laid down, and expired very soon afterwards. The soldier previously killed lay within five yards of him. \" Private Arns remained near the bodies of the lieutenant and the sol dier for some time, concealed in the dense thicket, and hoping that relief would come to bear the bodies away. He was at last obliged to make his own way to camp.\" The first party of Mexicans which Porter encountered was supposed to number about a hundred and fifty, and the second was still more nume rous. No doubt the Americans would have suffered more severely, but that the attack was made at night. On the 22d, a correspondence took place between the two commanders, in consequence of General Taylor having issued orders on the 19th, for the United States brig Lawrence, and the revenue cutter Santa Anna, to pursue two vessels bound with supplies to Matamoras. The following is the letter of General Ampudia :"], [35, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 29 Division of the North, Second General-in-chief. From various sources worthy of confidence, I have learned that some vessels bound for the mouth of the river have not been able to effect an entrance into that port, in consequence of your orders that they should be conducted to Brazos Santiago. The cargo of one of them is composed in great part, and of the other en tirely, of provisions which the contractors charged with providing for the army under my orders had procured to fulfil the obligations of their contracts. You have taken possession of these provisions by force, and against the will of the proprietors, one of whom is vice-consul of her Catholic ma jesty, and the other of her Britannic majesty; and whose rights, in place of being religiously respected, as was proffered, and as was to be hoped from the observance of the principles which govern among civilized nations, have, on the contrary, been violated in the most extraordinary manner, opposed to the guarantee and respect due to private property. Nothing can have authorized you in such a course. The commerce of nations is not suspended or interrupted, except in consequence of a solemn declaration of blockade, communicated and established in the form prescribed by international law. Nevertheless, you have infringed these rules, and, by an act which can never be viewed favourably to the United States government, have hindered the entrance to a Mexican port of ves sels bound to it, under the confidence that commerce would not be inter rupted. My duties do not allow me to consent to this new species of hos tility, and they constrain me to require of you, not only that the vessels taken by force to Brazos Santiago, shall be at liberty to return to the mouth of the river, but the restoration of all the provisions which, besides belong ing to private contractors, were destined for the troops on this frontier. I consider it useless to inculcate the justice of this demand, and the results which may follow an unlooked-for refusal. I have also' understood that two Mexicans, carried down in a boat by the current of the river, near one of the advanced posts of your camp, were detained, after being fired upon, and that they are still kept and treated as prisoners. The individuals in question do not belong to the army, and this circumstance exempts them from the laws of war. I therefore hope, that you will place them absolutely at liberty, as I cannot be persuaded that you pretend to extend to persons not military the consequences of an inva sion, which, without employing this means of rigour against unarmed citi zens, is marked in itself with the seal of universal reprobation. I avail myself of this opportunity to assure you of my distinguished consideration. God and Liberty ! Matamoras, April 22, 1846. Pedro de Ampudia Sr. Gen. Don Z. Taylor. c 2"], [36, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 30 HE reply of the American general is worthy of particular attention, as it not only gives a clear view of his policy, previous to the cause of complaint, but also exhibits the coolness and dignity which characterizes all his public actions. Head-quarters, Army of Occupation, Camp near Matamoras, Texas, April 22, 1846. Sir, \u2014 I have had the honour to receive your communication of this date, in which you complain of certain measures adopted by my orders to close the mouth of the Rio Bravo against vessels bound to Matamoras, and in which you also advert to the case of two Mexicans, supposed to be de tained as prisoners in this camp. After all that has passed since the American army first approached the Rio Bravo, I am certainly surprised that you should complain of a measure which is no other than a natural result of the state of war so much insisted upon by the Mexican authorities as actually existing at this time. You will excuse me for recalling a few circumstances to show that this state of war has not been sought by the American army, but has been forced upon it, and that the exercise of the rights incident to such a state cannot be made a subject of complaint. On breaking up my camp at Corpus Christi, and moving forward with the army under my orders, to occupy the left bank of the Rio Bravo, it was my earnest desire to execute my instructions in a pacific manner ; to observe the utmost regard for the personal rights of all citizens residing on the left bank of the river, and to take care that the religion and customs of the people should suffer no violation. With this view, and to quiet the minds of the inhabitants, I issued orders to the army, enjoining a strict observance of the rights and interests of all Mexicans residing on the river, and caused said orders to be translated into Spanish, and circulated in the several towns on the Bravo. These orders announced the spirit in which we proposed to occupy the country, and I am proud to say, that up to this moment the same spirit has controlled the operations of the army. On reaching the Arroyo Colorado, I was informed by a Mexican officer, that the order in question had been received in Matamoras ; but was told at the same time that if I attempted to cross the river, it would be regarded as a declaration of war. Again, on my march to Frontone, I was met by a deputation of the civil authorities of Matamoras, protesting against my oc cupation of a portion of the department of Tamaulipas, and declaring that, if the army was not at once withdrawn, war would result. While this communication was in my hands, it was discovered that the village of Frontone had been set on fire and abandoned. I viewed this as a direct act of war, and informed the deputation that their communication would be"], [37, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 31 answered by me when opposite Matamoras, which was done in respectful terms. On reaching the river, I despatched an officer, high in rank, to convey to the commanding general in Matamoras the expression of my desire for amicable relations, and my willingness to leave open to the use of the citizens of Matamoras the port of Brazos Santiago, until the ques tion of boundary should be definitely settled. This officer received for reply, from the officer selected to confer with him, that my advance to the Rio Bravo was considered as a veritable act of war, and he was absolutely refused an interview with the American consul, in itself an act incompati ble with a state of peace. Notwithstanding these repeated assurances on the part of the Mexican authorities, and notwithstanding the most obviously hostile preparations on the right bank of the river, accompanied by a rigid non-intercourse, I care fully abstained from any act of hostility, determined that the onus of pro ducing an actual state of hostilities should not rest with me. Our relations remained in this state until I had the honour to receive your note of the 12th instant, in which you denounce war as an alternative of my remain ing in this position. As I could not, under my instructions, recede from my position, I accepted the alternative you offered me, and made all my dispositions to meet it suitably. But, still willing to adopt milder mea sures before proceeding to others, I contented myself in the first instance with ordering a blockade of the mouth of the Rio Bravo by the naval forces under my orders \u2014 a proceeding perfectly consonant with the state of war so often declared to exist, and which you acknowledge in your note of the 16th instant, relative to the late Colonel Cross. If this measure seems oppressive, I wish it borne in mind that it has been forced upon me by the course you have seen fit to adopt. I have reported this blockade to my government, and shall not remove it until I receive instructions to that effect, unless indeed you desire an armistice pending the final settlement of the question between the governments, or until war shall be formally declared by either, in which case I shall cheerfully open the river. In regard to the consequences you mention as resulting from a refusal to re move the blockade, I beg you to understand that I am prepared for them, be they what they may. In regard to the particular vessels referred to in your communication, I have the honour to advise you that, in pursuance of my orders, two Ame rican schooners, bound for Matamoras, were warned off on the 17th instant, when near the mouth of the river, and put to sea, returning probably to New Orleans. They were not seized, or their cargoes disturbed in any way, nor have they been in the harbour of Brazos Santiago to my know ledge. A Mexican schooner, understood to be the \" Juanita,\" was in or off that harbour when my instructions to blockade the river were issued, but was driven to sea in a gale, since which time I have had no report 9"], [38, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 32 ccncernino- her. Since the receipt of your communication, I have learned that two persons, sent to the mouth of the river to procure information respecting this vessel, proceeded thence to Brazos Santiago, where they were taken up and detained by the officer in command, until my orders could be received. I shall order their immediate release. A letter from one of them to the Spanish vice-consul is respectfully transmitted here with. In relation to the Mexicans said to have drifted down the river in a boat, and to be prisoners at this time in my camp, I have the pleasure to inform you that no such persons have been taken prisoners or are now detained by my authority. The boat in question was carried down empty by the current of the river, and drifted ashore near one of our pickets, and was secured by the guard. Some time afterwards an attempt was made to re cover the boat under the cover of the darkness ; the individuals concerned were hailed by the guard, and, failing to answer, were fired upon as a matter of course. What became of them is not known, as no trace of them could be discovered on the following morning. The officer of the Mexican guard, directly opposite, was informed next day that the boat would be returned on proper application to me, and I have now only to repeat that assurance. In conclusion, I take leave to state that I consider the tone of your com munication highly exceptionable, where you stigmatize the movement of the army under my orders as \"marked with the seal of universal reproba tion.\" You must be aware that such language is not respectful in itself, either to me or my government ; and while I observe in my own corre spondence the courtesy due to your high position, and to the magnitude of the interests with which we are respectively charged, I shall expect the same in return. I have the honour to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, Z. Taylor. Brevet Brig. Gen. U. S. A. Commanding. Sr. Gen. D. Pedro de Ampudia, Commanding in Matamoras. We have already mentioned the address of Ampudia to the foreigners of the American army. A similar one was disseminated by Arista, dated the 20th of April, and worded still more artfully than its predecessor. The rewards of desertion are implicitly defined in this artful appeal, of which we insert a copy. Head-quarters at Matamoras, April 20, 1846. Soldiers ! \u2014 You have enlisted in time of peace to serve in that army for a specific term ; but your obligation never implied that you were bound to violate the laws of God, and the most sacred rights of friends ! The United States government, contrary to the wishes of a majority of all honest"], [39, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 33 and honourable Americans, has ordered you to take forcible possession of the territory of a friendly neighbour, who has never given her consent to such occupation. In other words, while the treaty of peace and commerce between Mexico and the United States is in full force, the United States, presuming on her strength and prosperity, and on our supposed imbecility and cowardice, attempts to make you the blind instruments of her unholy and mad ambition, and force you to appear as the hateful robbers of our dear homes, and the unprovoked violators of our dearest feelings as men and patriots. Such villany and outrage, I know, is perfectly repugnant to the noble sentiments of any gentleman, and it is base and foul to rush you on to certain death, in order to aggrandize a few lawless individuals, in defiance of the laws of God and man ! It is to no purpose if they tell you, that the law for the annexation of Texas justifies your occupation of the Rio Bravo del Norte ; for by this act they rob us of a great part of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Chihuahua, and New Mexico ; and it is barbarous to send a handful of mren on such an errand against a powerful and warlike nation. Besides, the most of you are Europeans, and we are the declared friends of a majority of the nations of Europe. The North Americans are ambitious, overbearing, and insolent as a nation, and they will only make use of you as vile tools to carry out their abominable plans of pillage and rapine. I warn you in the name of justice, honour, and your own interests and self-respect, to abandon their desperate and unholy cause, and become peaceful Mexican citizens. I guaranty you, in such case, a half-section of land, or three hundred and twenty acres, to settle upon, gratis. Be wise, then, and just and honourable, and take no part in murdering us who have no unkind feelings for you. Lands shall be given to officers, sergeants, and corporals, according to rank, privates receiving three hun dred and twenty acres, as stated. If in time of action you wish to espouse our cause, throw away your arms and run to us, and we will embrace you as true friends and Christians. It is not decent nor prudent to say more. But should any of you render important service to Mexico, you shall be accordingly considered and pre ferred. M- Arista, Commander-in-chies of the Mexican army. Larce detachments of the enemy now appeared from time to time on the opposite bank of the river, and reports were daily received that they had crossed above Matamoras, and were marching down, in the rear of the American fort. Accordingly, several parties were sent out to reconnoitre, and one of them, commanded by Captain Thornton, was surprised and captured by the enemy. The particulars of this event we extract from Niles' National Register of May 23d. 5"], [40, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 34 \" On the evening of the 23d, General Taylor's spies brought in intelli gence to the effect that about two thousand five hundred Mexicans had crossed the Rio Grande to the Texas side, above the American fort, and that about fifteen hundred of the same had crossed below. The general immediately despatched a squadron of dragoons to each place of crossing, for the purpose of reconnoitering them and ascertaining their position. The squadron ordered below was in command of Captain Ker ; the one above was commanded by Captain Thornton, and composed of Captain Hardee, Lieutenants Kane and Mason, with sixty-one privates and non commissioned officers. \" The former commander, Captain Ker, on arriving at the point where it was supposed they had crossed, found that the report was false, but that they had crossed above. \" Thornton's command had proceeded up the Rio Grande about twenty four miles, and, as was supposed, to within about three miles of the Mexican camp, when the guide refused to go further, stating for his rea son that the whole country was infested with Mexicans. The captain, however, proceeded on with his command about two miles, when he came to a farm-house, which was entirely enclosed by a chapparel fence, with the exception of that portion of it which bordered on the river, and this was so boggy as to be impassable. APTAIN THORNTON entered this enclo- sure through a pair of bars, and approached the house for the purpose of making some inquiry, his command following him. When the whole party had entered the enclosure, the enemy, having been concealed in the chapparel, about two thousand five hundred in number, completely surrounded him and commenced firing upon his command. He then wheeled his command, thinking he could charge through the enemy, and pass out where he had entered, even though it should be attended with consi derable loss. This he attempted, but, on account of the strength of the enemy, did not succeed. \"At this moment Captain Hardee approached him for the purpose of suggesting the means to extricate themselves, the fire of the enemy still continuing. Thornton's horse, having received a shot, ran with him toward the chapparel fence, which he leaped, and plunged into a preci pice, where he fell with the captain underneath, who remained insensible for five or six hours. This casualty placed Captain Hardee in command, who attempted with the residue to make his escape by the river, intend ing, on arriving at its margin, to swim it. In this he failed, finding the"], [41, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 35 ground so boggy that he could not reach the river. He then returned, taking the precaution to keep out of musketry range, dismounted and examined the arms of his men, determined to sell their lives as dearly as possible. \" Before he had succeeded in the inspection of the arms, a Mexican offi cer rode up and asked him to surrender. The captain replied that he would surrender on one condition, which was, that if the Mexican general would receive them as prisoners of war and treat them as the most civil ized nations do, they would give themselves up, but on no other condition. The officer bore this message to the commanding general, and returned with the assurance that their request should be complied with. Captain Hardee then surrendered. Captains Thornton and Hardee, with Lieu tenant Kane and the residue of the non-commissioned officers and privates, were made prisoners of war, but were remarkably well treated by the enemy. \"Lieutenant George Mason was a fine young officer, and his death is much regretted. His sabre-belt was recognised among some articles that were subsequently captured from the enemy.\" The capture of this party was a source of unoounded joy to the Mexi cans. The commander wrote to one of his officers in terms of the most extravagant compliments, and the ruin of the invading army was confi dently and exultingly foretold. After the capture of Thornton, the Mexi cans threw off the reserve which had hitherto marked their movements, and, crossing the river in large detachments, spread themselves between Genera] Taylor and Point Isabel. The situation of both the American sta tions was now becoming critical, as all communication between them was cut off. In addition to the latter circumstance, there were but eight days' rations in the fort, all the provisions and military stores having been left at Point Isabel. This was a season of gloomy anxiety for the army ; beino- entirely ignorant of the designs of the Mexicans, they knew not what moment they would either be attacked themselves, or hear the report of a cannonade upon Major Munroe. \u2022EANWHILE the garrison at Point Isabel were not idle. As soon as intercourse ' with General Taylor was stopped, they placed every thing in a condition for im- mediate resistance, and, in addition to the regular force, the masters and crews of vessels landed and occupied stations with the troops. The works were as perfect as it was possible to make them under the circumstances, and it was generally believed that, should they be attacked by a force not superior to fifteen hundred men, they would be able to sustain themselves."], [42, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 36 During this state of affairs, Captain Samuel Walker, with a small body of Texan rangers, arrived at Point Isabel. He is quite a young officer, but served with great distinction in the Texan revolution, when he was taken prisoner, and sent to Mexico. On his arrival he was ordered by Major Munroe to occupy a station west of the point, in order to open, if possible, a communication with General Taylor. He accordingly took a position about twelve miles distant ; but soon after receiving intelligence from some teamsters who had been detached from the point with supplies for Taylor, that the Mexicans were completely obstructing the road, he set out on the 28th with his whole force of about seventy-five men, intend ing to cut his way to the Rio Grande. He had proceeded about twelve miles, when he unexpectedly encountered a large Mexican force, who immediately commenced an attack. A great part of the troops were raw; these the captain ordered to keep on the right, and directed the whole to retire under a neighbouring chapparel. But the fresh soldiers, panic struck at the first view of an enemy, scattered in confusion, and the Mex icans rushing on in overwhelming numbers, he was obliged to retreat. He was pursued to within cannon range of Point Isabel, which he entered with a few men. He estimates the number of Mexicans as fifteen hun dred men, and supposes that at least thirty of them fell in the fifteen minutes that the engagement lasted. They were believed to be a portion of the detachment which had crossed the Rio Grande, twenty-five miles above Matamoras, and which was estimated at three thousand men. They had arrived at their position by a circuitous route on the east of General Taylor's camp. So far from being discouraged by this disaster, Captain Walker volun teered his services, immediately upon arriving at Point Isabel, to carry any communication from Major Munroe to General Taylor, providing four men would accompany him. Although the proposal was regarded as reckless, yet six immediately volunteered their services, and received permission from the major. The party set out on the 29lh, and, after a number of almost provi- dential escapes, reached the camp opposite Matamoras in safety. PON receiving news of the situation of his main depot, General Taylor formed the bold design of marching with a part of his army to its relief. A glance at the position of affairs will show the energy necessary to insure success to such a movement. While on the road, his force would be divided into three small sec- tions, each threatened by a vastly superior force of the enemy ; and even though he should reach Point Isabel unmolested, yet the enemy might concentrate their armies in order to dispute his"], [43, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 37 return, or by a rapid movement overwhelm the little force he would leave behind him. But the General saw his duty, and determined to perform it. On the 1st of May the general marched from the fort, leaving it in pos session of Major Brown, with the seventh regiment of infantry, under Captain Lowd, and two companies of artillery, under Lieutenant Bragg, comprising, in all, six hundred men. He reached Point Isabel at evening of the next day, without having encountered any opposition. The march of the Americans was mistaken by the enemy for a retreat, and the whole population of the city, both civil and military, exhibited the most extravagant demonstrations of joy. The press adopted this opinion, as will be seen by the following extract from the El Monitor Republicano of May 4th : \"On the first of this month, at 11 o'clock in the morning, the gene ral-in-chief [Arista] left this place to join the army, which, several hours before, had left with the intention of crossing the river at a short distance from the camp of the enemy. In consequence of the orders given, so that this dangerous operation might be performed with due security, and according to the rules of military art, when our troops arrived at the spot designated for the crossing of the river, the left bank was already occupied by General D. Anastasia Torrejon, with all the force under his command. The enthusiasm of our soldiers to conquer the obstacles which separated them from the enemy was so great, that they showed themselves impatient of the delay occasioned by the bad condition of some of the flat boats which had been very much injured in the transportation by land, and could not be used, as they would fill up with water as soon as they were launched. In spite of that obstacle, the work went on with such activity, and so great was the ardour of the most excellent general-in-chief, whose orders were obeyed with the greatest promptitude and precision, that a few hours were sufficient to transport to the opposite bank of the Bravo a strong division, with all its artillery and train. HIS rapid and well-combined move- ment ought to have proved to the invaders not only that the Mexi- cans possess instruction and apt- ness for war, but that those quali ties are now brought forward l^e Purest patriotism. The northern division, fearless of fa tigue, and levelling all difficulties, ran to seek an enemy who, well sheltered under parapets, and defended by guns of a large calibre, could wait for the attack with indisputable advantage. With deep trenches, with a multitude of fortifications, the"], [44, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 38 defence was easy against those who presented themselves with their naked breasts. BUT General Taylor dared not resist the valour and enthu- siasm of the sons of Mexico. Well did he foresee the intrepidity with which our soldiers would rush against the usurpers of the national territory. Well did he know the many injuries which were to be avenged by those who had taken up arms, not to aggrandize themselves with the spoils of the property of others, but to maintain the independence of their country. Well did. he know, we repeat it, that the Mexicans would be stopped neither by trenches nor fortresses, nor large artillery. Thus it was that the chief of the American forces, frightened as soon as he perceived, from the situation and proximity of his camp, that our army was preparing to cross the river, left with precipitation for Point Isabel, with almost all his troops, eight pieces of artillery and a few wagons. Their march was observed from our position, and the most excellent General D. Francisco Mejia immediately sent an express extraor dinary to communicate the news to the most excellent general-in-chief. Here let me pay to our brave men the tribute which they deserve. The express verbally informed some of the troops which had not yet arrived at the ford, of the escape of the Americans ; in one instant all the soldiers spontaneously crossed the river, almost racing one with another. \" Such was the ardour with which they crossed the river to attack the enemy. The terror and haste with which the latter fled to the fort, to shut themselves up in it and avoid a conflict, frustrated the active measures of the most excellent Senor General Arista, which were to order the cavalry to advance in the plain, and to cut off the flight of the fugitives. But it was not possible to do so, notwithstanding their forced march during the night. General Taylor left his camp at two o'clock in the afternoon, and, as fear has wings, he succeeded in shutting himself up in the fort. When our cavalry reached the point where they were to detain him, he had already passed and was several leagues ahead. Great was the sorrow of our brave men, not to have been able to meet the enemy face to face. Their defeat was certain, and the main body of that invading army, who thought that they had inspired the Mexicans with so much respect, would have disappeared in the first important battle. But there was some fight ing to be done, and the Americans do not know how to use other arms but those of duplicity and treachery. Why did they not remain with firmness under their colours 1 Why did they abandon the ground which they pretend to usurp with such iniquity? Thus has an honourable gene ral kept his word. Had not General Taylor said in all his communica tions, that he was prepared to repel all hostilities ? Why, then, does he fly in so cowardly a manner to shut himself up at the point ? The com-"], [45, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 39 mander-in-chief of the American army has covered himself with oppro brium and ignominy in sacrificing a part of his forces, whom he left in the fortifications, to save himself; for it is certain that he will not return to their assistance \u2014 not that he is ignorant of their peril, but he calculates that his would be greater if he had the temerity of attempting to resist the Mexican lances and bayonets in the open plain.\" HE \" flight\" of the American general af- forded an excellent opportunity for the destruction of the fort and garrison oppo- site Matamoras ; and the Mexicans were too sagacious not to improve it. Early on the morning of the 3d, a brisk fire opened upon the fort from a battery of seven guns, placed in the town. This was answered by the eighteen-pounders, and for fifteen minutes both parties maintained a spirited cannonade. At the end of this time, the Mexican battery ceased, one of their guns having been shot from its carriage, and another disabled. The Mexicans now fired shells and shot from the lower fort and a mortar battery, until half-past seven o'clock in the evening. Soon after this time it was resumed, and continued with occasional inter missions until midnight. During all this time a part of the troops laboured to complete the fortifications, although exposed to the full range of the enemy's guns. The enemy discharged about fifteen hundred shot during this first day's attack, yet but one man was killed, (Serjeant Weigant, of the seventh infantry,) the principal damage being to property. Au officer, under date of May 4th, thus speaks of the cannonade : \" Yesterday morning the Mexicans opened their batteries from the town, which was returned from our eighteen-pounder, and a brisk fire was kept up for an hour or more, during which time one of their batteries was silenced by our guns, and a number of shots fired on the town. My sta tion beino- in one of the batteries opposite the fort, I could sometimes hear the shot crashing through the houses. Our guns stopped firing about ten or eleven o'clock, as we were only wasting our ammunition and did but little injury, except to the town. They kept on firing through the day and part of the night, but have done us little injury, one man only being killed. They have a mortar and annoy us considerably with their shells, several of which have exploded in the fort, but with no serious injury. We are hourly expecting an attack from their forces, and are prepared to make a vigorous defence.\" The Mexicans mistook the silence of the Americans as symptoms of fear, and were full of sanguine expectations of a surrender. We give an ex tract from the El Monitor Republicano of May 4th."], [46, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 40 \"But let us relate the glorious events of yesterday. As Aurora dawned, we began to fire from our ramparts on the fortifications of the enemy, and the thunder of the Mexican cannon was saluted by the reveille from every point of our line, by the bell of the parochial church, and by the vivas of the inhabitants of Matamoras. In a moment the streets were filled, and all were rejoiced to see at last the hour arrived, when we were to give a terrible lesson to the American camp, whose odious presence could no longer be tolerated. The enemy answered, but they were soon convinced that their artillery, although of a superior calibre, could not compete with ours. After a fire of five hours, our ramparts remained immovable, on account of the solidity of their construction, and the intelligence with which the rules of art had been observed. The same did not happen to the American fortifications, whose bastions were so completely demolished that their artillery ceased to play, and their fire was hushed. We con tinued to fire with alacrity during the day, without the enemy's daring to respond to us, because the parapets, under which they would shelter them selves, being destroyed, they had not courage to load their guns, which remained uncovered. This result shows us of what, in reality, consists the exalted skill of the American artillerists. They have eighteen pounders, and we have nothing larger than eight-pounders ; and yet the intelligence and practice of the Mexicans sufficed to conquer those who had superior arms. Unequalled glory and eternal honour to our brave artillerymen ! \" The enemy, in their impotent rage, and before they concealed their shame behind the most distant parapets, had the barbarous pleasure of aiming their guns towards the city to destroy its edifices, as it was not in their power to destroy the fortifications from which they received so much injury. This wicked revenge, which only springs from cowardly and miserable souls, did not meet with the success expected by those who so unworthily adorn themselves with the title of savants and philanthropists. Their stupidity was equal to their wickedness. Almost all the balls passed too high ; and those which touched the houses, although they were eigh teen-pounders, did not cause any other mischief but that of piercing one or two walls. If those who conceived the infamous design of destroying Matamoras had seen the contemptuous laughter with which the owners of those houses showed their indifference for the losses which they might sustain, they would have admired the patriotism and disinterestedness of the Mexicans, always ready to undergo the greatest sacrifices, when it is necessary to maintain their nationality and independence. The glorious 3d of May is another brilliant testimony of this truth ; through the thickest of the firing, one could remark the most ardent enthusiasm on all faces, and hardly had a ball fallen, when even the children would look for it, without fearing that another aimed in the same manner should fall in the"], [47, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 41 same place. That, we saw ourselves, in the public square, where a mul titude of citizens were assembled. \" The triumph of our arms has been complete ; and we have only to lament the loss of a sergeant and two artillerymen, who fell gloriously in fighting for their country. The families of those victims ought to be taken care of by the supreme government, to whose paternal gratitude they have been recommended by the most excellent senor general-in-chief. We must also be consoled by the thought, that the blood of these brave men has been revenged by their bereaved companions. As many of our balls passed through the embrasure, the loss to the Americans must be very great ; and, although w*e do not know exactly the number of their dead, the most accurate information makes it amount to fifty-six. It is probable that such is the case. Since 11 o'clock in the morning, the abandonment of their guns, merely because two of them were dismounted, and the others were uncovered ; the panic-terror with which, in all haste, they took refuge in their furthest intrenchments, taking away from the camp all that could suf fer from the attack of our artillery ; the destruction which must have been occasioned by the bombs, so well aimed, that some would burst at a yard's distance from the ground, in their descent to the point at which they were to fall ; every thing contributes to persuade that, indeed, the enemy have suffered a terrible loss. If it were not the case, if they preserved some remnant of valour, why did they not dare to repair their fortifications in the night? It is true that, from time to time, a few guns were fired on them in the night, but their aim could not be certain, and cowardice alone could force them not to put themselves in an attitude to return the fire which was poured on them again at daylight. No American put out his head ; silence reigned in their camp ; and for this reason we have sus pended our fire to-day \u2014 that there is no enemy to meet our batteries. \" To conclude, we will give a brilliant paragraph relating to the contest, by the most excellent senor general-in-chief, as to the part which he took in the events of yesterday. He says thus: 'Mexico must glorify herself, and especially the valiant men of the division of the north, that a force inferior in its elements, and perhaps in number also, and which required nearly two months to swell itself with the auxiliaries coming from the capital, should meet in an immense plain, defying the armies of the United States, and the whole power of that republic, without their opponents, who could receive succour in the space of fifty hours, should dare to leave the fort to give us battle.\" [From the Bulletin of the Northern Division.] \" So rapid is the fire of our guns, that the batteries of the enemy have been silenced. But what is most worthy of notice, as showing the great enthusiasm of this place, is the fact that many of the inhabitants of both D2 n"], [48, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 42 sexes, in the hottest of the cannonade, remained firm in front of the enemy, filled with enthusiasm ; indeed, fear is always unknown to those whose mission it is to avenge an outrage upon the sacred right of their beloved country. \"From our account of the war, the world will judge of the great supe- riority of our troops, in courage as well as skill, over the Americans. It is indeed wonderful to witness the dismay of the enemy ; rare is the occur rence when an American ventures outside of the breastworks. There can be no doubt of this, that the Mexicans will be considered by foreign nations as the very emblems of patriotism. How evident that they inherit the blood of the noble sons of Peiayo ! Happy they who have met with so glorious a death, in defending the territory bequeathed to them by their fathers ! \" The nation with which we are at war is most savage in its proceed ings ; no regard being paid to the flags of friendly nations ; even those usages and customs respected by civilized nations, to divest war of some of its horrors, have been shamefully disregarded. The enemy have fired red shot against this innocent city, and we publish it to the world in proof that, with all their boasted wisdom and liberty, they are unworthy of being counted among enlightened nations. \" His excellency, the general-in-chief of the northern division, and his intrepid soldiers, are ready to fight the enemy in any numbers, and we are certain that our arms will be successful ; but the nation against whom we have to contend is excessively proud ; and it is also possessed of resources which may perhaps surpass those within our reach. Let us then make an immense effort to repel their aggressions. Let us contribute every thing most dear to us \u2014 our persons, our means \u2014 to save our country from its present danger. Let us oppose to the unbridled ambition of the Anglo- American that patriotic enthusiasm so peculiar to us. Indeed, we need only follow the glorious example of Matamoras, that noble city, which will be known in future by the name of Heroic. Its inhabitants have emulated the examples of Menamia and Saguntum ; they have determined to die at the foot of the eagle of Anahuac, defend their fort whilst they retain the breath of life \u2014 this plan is settled. The supreme government is making strenuous exertions in order to protect the territory placed under its care by the nation, and nothing is now wanting but for the people to rush in a mass to the frontier, and the independence of Mexico is safe.\" Between two and three o'clock on the morning of the 4th, Captain Walker, with six rangers, arrived before the fort, and being hailed by the sentinel, announced himself and party as \"friends from Frontone.\"* After some delay he was admitted, and delivered messages from General Taylor to Major Brown. * Frontone is the Texan designation of Point Isabel."], [49, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 43 HE noise of the cannonading had reached Point Isabel, and, on account of the paucity of military stores in the fort, had created the most intense excitement. As it continued, the general determined to know something of the garrison, and accordingly selected Captain May, with about one hun- dred men, including ten rangers under Captain Walker, to open the wished-for communication. His orders were, to proceed to within a few miles of the fort, and, in the event of hearing no cannonading, to conceal his party behind some chapparel, while Captain Walker, with his rangers, advanced towards the fort ; and upon the return of the captain, to make a general reconnoitering of the country, and especially the enemy's position, but under no circumstances to risk an engagement. _ o Early in the afternoon the party left Point Isabel, and at nine arrived within view of the enemy's watch-fires, on the plain of Palo Alto. By skilful man\u0153uvering, May escaped observation, extended his party so as to encircle the Mexicans, and, marching round them, reached a station within seven miles of the American fort. Here he covered his party by rows of chapparel, and detached Captain Walker to Major Brown. After waiting until daylight for the return of the rangers, he decided to return, imagining that Walker had been captured by some of the numerous par ties who were known to be on the alert for him. May returned at a full gallop, passing within half a mile of the enemy's camp. When within twelve miles of Point Isabel, he encountered a body of one hundred and fifty lancers, whom he charged and pursued nearly three miles. As their horses were superior to his own, he was obliged to relinquish the pursuit, and returned to Point Isabel at nine o'clock. T was believed by the army that Captain Walker had been captured, and as he was a general favourite, as well as a most active officer, his supposed loss cast a gloom over both officers and men. Suddenly, however, he was observed approaching the point, and in addition to the joy attending his personal safety, reported the gra- tifying intelligence that Major Brown was able to main- tain his position. His passage from the fort to the position of General Taylor was a daring and skilful feat, and it was alone owing to his accurate knowledge of the face of the country, that it was so successful. In fact, this whole adventure of Captain May must be re garded as one of the most brilliant of all the events which have yet trans pired in Mexico. The fire of the enemy was not renewed on the 4th, and thus an excel lent opportunity was afforded to finish the defences of the fort. On the following morning, a battery was observed in the field on the east side of the Rio Grande, and for several hours troops continued to pour from all"], [50, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 44 quarters towards that station. At the same time the army in Matamoras were unusually active, and the Americans now felt certain that an assault was intended. Late in the afternoon, the field-battery opened upon the fort, and, after firing for a few minutes, was assisted by a severe discharge of shells and shot from the army in the city. The Americans replied to this combined fire by their six-pounder howitzer batteries, and after a short time the Mexicans ceased. In the evening, bodies of Mexican light troops, with some lancers and rancheros, being observed in various parts of the field, north and east of the fort, Lieutenant Hanson asked permission of the commandant, to issue out with a small party in order to reconnoitre. This was granted, and he ap proached one party, who fled at perceiving him. The remainder then endeavoured to surround him and intercept his return, but by vigilant movements he eluded them, and having effected his object, returned to the fort. The enemy then marched several detachments below the fort, so that before night they had entirely surrounded it. General Taylor had advised the major, that in case of this extremity he should discharge his two eighteen-pounders at regular intervals as a signal ; and this was accord ingly done. N the 6th, the cannonade was renewed, and conducted with far more vigour than on any previous day. At 10 o'clock, the Americans lost their brave commander, Major Brown, who was mortally wounded by a cannon shot. His right leg was completely shattered, and although amputation was immediately, as well as skil fully effected, he survived but three days. In the offi cial despatch of General Taylor, his death is thus noticed : \" The field-work opposite Matamoras has sustained itself handsomely during a cannonade and bombardment of one hundred and sixty hours. But the pleasure is alloyed with profound regret, at the loss of its heroic and indomitable commander, Major Brown, who died to-day from the effect of a shell. His loss would be a severe one to the service at any time, but to the army under my orders it is indeed irreparable.\" Major Brown was succeeded by Captain Hawkins. The fire of the Mexicans continued with but little intermission until noon. It then ceased and everything remained quiet for two hours, when a battery commenced a languid fire which soon ceased. About the same time, the companies which had moved to the rear of the fort on the preced ing night, approached so near as to be almost within musket range. Here, however, they were repulsed with some loss, by a discharge from the bat tery of Lieutenant Lowd. About five o'clock, the Mexicans sounded a parley, and immediately"], [51, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 45 after, two officers with a white flag were seen approaching the fort. By command of Captain Hawkins, they were met by Major Sewell and Lieu tenant Britton, to whom they delivered a message from General Arista, to the. commandant of the fort. The following is a translation : Mexican Army, Division of the North, General-in-chief. You are besieged by forces sufficient to take you, and there is, moreover, a numerous division encamped near you which, free from other cares, will keep off any succours which you may expect to receive. The respect for humanity acknowledged at the present age by all civil ized nations, doubtless imposes upon me the duty of mitigating the disas ters of war. This principle, which Mexicans observe above all other nations, obliges me to summon you, as all your efforts will be useless, to surrender, in order to avoid, by a capitulation, the entire destruction of all the soldiers under your command. You will thus afford me the pleasure of complying with the mild and benevolent wishes above expressed, which distinguish the character of my countrymen, whilst I at the same time fulfil the most imperious of the duties which my country requires for the offences committed against it. God and Liberty ! Head-quarters at the Fauques del Raminero, May 6th, 1846. Mariano Arista. One hour was allowed for the American commander's reply. Accord ingly a council of officers was convened, and the opinion of each one asked, commencing at the youngest. The response was unanimous \u2014 to defend the fort till death ; and before the hour expired, Arista received the following reply : Head-quarters U. S. Forces, Near Matamoras, May 6th, 1846, 5 p. m. Sir, \u2014 Your humane communication has just been received, and, after the consideration due to its importance, I must respectfully decline to sur render my forces to you. The exact purport of your despatch I cannot feel confident that I under stood, as my interpreter is not skilled in your language ; but if I have understood you correctly, you have my reply above. I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant, E. S. Hawkins, Commanding U. S. forces opposite Matamoras. Gen. M. Arista, Commanding Division of the North. The reception of this answer was the signal for a general burst of heavy shot upon the fort, and until sunset the cannonading was more severe than it had yet been. The American ammunition was nearly exhausted, and they were obliged to remain quiet, lest, by throwing it away now, they"], [52, "COMMENCEMENT OF THE MEXICAN WAR. 46 would be unprepared in case of an assault. During the night the troops slept upon their arms, the number of sentinels was increased, and every preparation made to repel successfully the expected night attack. The 7lh was a day of activity to both armies. Not only was a heavy cannonade maintained ail day, but various parties fired into the fort from almost every position, and large detachments of cavalry formed in the field with the evident design of making an assault. Orders had been issued, however, to the garrison not to fire upon the enemy unless they would ap proach within eighty yards of the fort ; and as this was not done, they were obliged to remain silent. In the evening, a small party, under Captain Mansfield, advanced into the plain and levelled the traverse formerly occupied by the Americans, and which now served to shelter the enemy while firing upon the fort. They also cut down large quantities of chapparel which the Mexicans used for a similar purpose, and returned to the city unmolested. At midnight the garrison were roused by volleys of musketry, and the noise of bugles, which continued for some time, the Americans expecting each moment a charge ; in a short time all was again quiet. The firing was renewed at daybreak of the 8th, and continued until afternoon, without loss however to the fort. In the afternoon, the sound of heavy cannonade, in the direction of Point Isabel, announced to the garrison that for the first time General Taylor had met with the enemy. In the evening, a Mexican fugitive arrived at the fort, and gave an account of the battle of Palo Alto. On the following morning the batteries re-opened on the fort, and con tinued until afternoon, when the cannonade of the previous day was re newed, apparently much nearer to the garrison. The Mexican batteries were now all silent, and the intensest excitement pervaded the fort. At evening the tale was told. A confused mass of infantry, lancers, and cavalry, burst from the adjoining thicket, and rushed toward the river, throwing aside every thing which might impede their flight. Some were crushed to death by the horses, others precipitated into the water, and many murdered by their own lancers ; while the terrified citizens of Mata moras, who had so exultingly witnessed the retreat of General Taylor, now saw his dark columns moving in stern pursuit of the flying legions of Mexico."], [53, "47 GENERAL TAYLOR, BATTLES OF PALO ALTO AND RESACA DE LA PALMA, ENERAL TAYLOR left Point Isabel on the even- ing of the 7th of May, and moved with the main body of the army toward the Rio Grande. They marched about seven miles, and bivouacked on their arms. The march was resumed on the fol- lowing morning, and about noon, the army came in sight of the enemy, stretched in one unbroken line of more than a mile in length. The battle of Palo Alto is described in the official report of General Taylor, which we insert. Head-quarters, Army of Occupation, Camp near Matamoras, Texas, May 16, 1846. Sir. I have now the honour to submit a more detailed report of the action of the 8th instant."], [54, "PALO ALTO AND RESACA DE LA PALMA. 48 The main body of the Army of Occupation marched under my imme diate orders from Point Isabel, on the evening of the 7th May, and bivou acked seven miles from that place. Our march was resumed the following morning. About noon, when our advance of cavalry had reached the water-hole of \" Palo Alto,\" the Mexi can troops were reported in our front, and were soon discovered occupying the road in force. I ordered a halt on reaching the water, with a view to rest and refresh the men and form deliberately our line of battle. The Mexican line was now plainly visible across the prairie, and about three quarters of a mile distant. Their left, which was composed of a heavy force of cavalry, occupied the road, resting upon a thicket of chapparel, while masses of infantry were discovered in succession on the right, greatly outnumbering our own force. Our line of battle was now formed in the following order, commencing on the extreme right: fifth infantry, commanded by Lieutenant-colonel Mclntosh ; Major Ringgold's artillery ; third infantry, commanded by Captain L. M. Morris ; two eighteen-pounders, commanded by Lieutenant Churchill, third artillery ; fourth infantry, commanded by Major G. W. Allen ; the third and fourth regiments composed the third brigade, under command of Lieutenant-colonel Garland, and all the above corps, together with two squadrons of dragoons, under Captains Ker and May, composed the right wing, under the orders of Colonel Twiggs. The left was formed by the battalion of artillery, commanded by Lieutenant-colonel Childs, Captain Duncan's light artillery, and the eighth infantry, under Captain Montgomery, all forming the first brigade under command of Lieutenant colonel Belknap. The train was parked near the water, under direc tions of Captains Crossman and Myers, and protected by Captain Ker's squadron. About 2 o'clock, we took up the march by heads of columns in the direction of the enemy, the eighteen-pounder battery following the road. While the other columns were advancing, Lieutenant Blake, Topographi cal Engineers, volunteered a reconnoissance of the enemy's line, which was handsomely performed, and resulted in the discovery of at least two batteries of artillery in the intervals of their cavalry and infantry. These batteries were soon opened upon us, when I ordered the columns halted and deployed into line, and the fire to be returned by ail our artillery. The eighth infantry, on our extreme left, was thrown back to secure that flank. The first fires of the enemy did little execution, while our eighteen-pound ers and Major Ringgold's artillery soon dispersed the cavalry which formed his left. Captain Duncan's battery, thrown forward in advance of the line, was doing good execution at this time. Captain May's squadron was now detached to support that battery and the left of our position. The Mexican cavalry, with two pieces of artillery, were now reported to be"], [55, ""], [56, ""], [57, "PALO ALTO AND RESACA DE LA PALMA. 51 moving through the chapparel to our right, to threaten that flank, or make a demonstration against the train. The fifth infantry was immediately detached to check this movement, and, supported by Lieutenant Ridgely, with a section of Major Ringgold's battery, and Captain Walker's com pany of volunteers, effectually repulsed the enemy \u2014 the fifth infantry re pelling a charge of lancers, and the artillery doing great execution in their ranks. The third infantry was now detached to the right, as a still further security to that flank, yet threatened by the enemy. Major Ringgold, with the remaining section, kept up his fire from an advanced position, and was supported by the left infantry. The grass of the prairie had been accidentally fired by our artillery, and the volumes of smoke now partially concealed the armies from each other As the enemy's left had evidently been driven back, and left the road free, and as the cannonade had been suspended, I ordered forward the eighteen pounders on the road nearly to the position first occupied by the Mexican cavalry, and caused the first brigade to take up a new position, still on the left of the eighteen-pounder battery. The fifth was advanced from its former position, and occupied a point on the extreme right of the new line. The enemy made a change of position corresponding to our own, and after a suspension of nearly an hour, the action was resumed. The fire of artillery was now most destructive ; openings were con stantly made through the enemy's ranks by our fire, and the constancy with which the Mexican infantry sustained this severe cannonade was a theme of universal remark and admiration. Captain May's squadron was detached to make a demonstration on the left of the enemy's position, and suffered severely from the fire of artillery, to which it was for some time exposed. The fourth infantry, which had been ordered to support the eighteen pounder battery, was exposed to a most galling fire of artillery, by which several men were killed, and Captain Page dangerously wounded. The enemy's fire was directed against our eighteen-pounder battery, and the guns under Major Ringgold in its vicinity. The major himself, while coolly directing the fire of his pieces, was \"struck by a cannon-ball and mortally wounded. In the mean time, the battalion under Lieutenant-colonel Childs had been brought up to support the artillery on our right. A strong demonstration of cavalry was now made by the enemy against this part of our line, and the column continued to advance under a severe fire from the eighteen pounders. The battalion was instantly formed in square, and held ready to receive the charge of cavalry, but when the advancing squadrons were within close range, a deadly fire of canister from the eighteen-pounders dispersed them. A brisk fire of small arms was now opened upon the square, by which one officer (Lieutenant Luther, second artillery) was"], [58, "PALO ALTO AND RESACA DE LA PALMA. 52 slightly wounded ; but a well-directed volley from the front of the square silenced all further firing from the enemy in this quarter. It was now nearly dark, and the action was closed on the right of our line, the enemy having been completely driven back from his position, and foiled in every attempt against it. While the above was going forward on our right, and under our own eye, the enemy had made a serious attempt against the left of our line. Captain Duncan instantly perceived the movement, and, by the bold and brilliant man\u0153uvering of his battery, completely repulsed several successive efforts of the enemy to advance in force upon our left flank. Supported in succession by the eighth infantry, and by Captain Ker's squadron of dra goons, he gallantly held the enemy at bay, and finally drove him, with im mense loss, from the field. The action here and along the whole line con tinued until dark, when the enemy retired into the chapparel, in rear of his position. Our loss this day was nine killed, forty-four wounded, and two missing. Among the wounded were Major Ringgold, who has since died, and Cap tain Page dangerously wounded, Lieutenant Luther slightly so. I annex a tabular statement of the casualties of the day. Our own force engaged is shown by the field-report, herewith transmit ted, to have been one hundred and seventy-seven officers, and two thousand one hundred and eleven men ; aggregate, two thousand two hundred and eighty-eight. The Mexican force, according to the statements of their own officers, taken prisoners in the affair of the 9th, was not less than six thou sand regular troops, with ten pieces of artillery, and probably exceeded that number \u2014 the irregular force not known. Their loss was not less than two hundred killed, and four hundred wounded \u2014 probably greater. This estimate is very moderate, and formed upon the number actually counted on the field, and upon the reports of their own officers. y As already reported in my first brief despatch, the conduct of our offi cers and men was every thing that could be desired. Exposed for hours to the severest trial \u2014 a cannonade of artillery \u2014 our troops displayed a cool ness and constancy which gave me throughout the assurance of victory. I purposely defer the mention of individuals, until my report of the action of the 9th, when I will endeavour to do justice to the many instances of distinguished conduct on both days. In the mean time, I refer for more minute details to the reports of individual commanders. I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant, Z. Taylor, Brevet Brig. Gen. U. S. A. Commanding. The Adjutant General of the Army, Washington. An officer writing from the field of battle gives the following thrilling account of some of the incidents to which he was an eye-witness :"], [59, ""], [60, ""], [61, "PALO ALTO AND RESACA DE LA PALMA. 55 \" When we arrived within good artillery range, their batteries opened upon us, some of their balls bouncing along the plain, and passing us in ricochet ; others flying over our heads and falling in our rear, showing us in a few moments that their pieces were served with skill and precision. The infantry were destined to give the strongest evidence of courage that a soldier can exhibit \u2014 to stand in squares four hours under fire of the enemy's artillery so as to protect our own artillery from the cavalry, whilst it was mowing down the enemy's ranks In the mean time, the whole order of battle had been, changed to conform to the man\u0153uvres of the enemy, and our brigade, which was the left, now turned itself in advance on the right \u2014 the artillery battalion being on the extreme right and the most in advance. In these different changes, our general was always slowly but steadfastly gaining ground to the front, and the enemy gradu ally falling back. The enemy's fire having slackened, and then ceased, General Taylor, from his new and more advanced position, ordered all his batteries to open, and in his turn attacked the enemy with such fury, as to cause evident destruction in their ranks ; but still they remained firm. By a charge on them they might have been routed entirely, but then we must have exposed our wagons to be captured by their cavalry, and that could not be thought of. At this moment the enemy were discovered coming down with his left flank in great force of cavalry and infantry, on the artillery battalion and eighteen-pounders, which that battalion supported. The eighteen-pounders were served by thirty men, and the artillery bat talion was about three hundred and sixty strong. Both the batteries and battalion were in such a position that they could not be supported by the other portion of the army, and at the time the charge commenced, the bat talion had deployed into line. However, it was thrown into square by a prompt man\u0153uvre, and awaited steadily the Mexican charge. On they came, 'horse, foot, and dragoons,' shouting and yelling, when a single horseman rode into the square and said, ' Men, I place myself in your square.' The general was immediately recognised by the men, who gave him three cheers for this evidence of his confidence. At this moment Lieutenant Churchill discharged one of his eighteen-pounders, loaded with grape, into the advancing ranks, but not checking entirely their onward movement. They marched forward to within good musket range, some one hundred and fifty yards of us, halted and delivered their fire, which our men received quietly at a shoulder. \"Our army slept on their arms precisely as night found them, and occu pied the position in which the enemy commenced the battle. The two armies slept quietly almost in presence of each other. The night was serene and beautiful, the moon casting the softest light on every thing around us, and but for the groans of the wounded, and the screams of those who were suffering under the knife of the surgeons, no one could"], [62, "PALO ALTO AND RESACA DE LA PALMA. 56 have imagined the scenes which had occurred but a few hours pre viously. \"Many dragoon horses were killed, and the escapes were almost incre dible. In Magruder's company, two men, whilst at an order, had the bayonets of their muskets cut off by cannon-balls passing just over their shoulders and between their heads. He had also a man killed on his im mediate right, and one on his left. Some of the balls fell in the centres of the squares and ricocheted out again without touching any one. Others fell just on the outside and bounced over. To stand patiently and coolly in square under such a fire, for five hours, without returning a shot, is the best evidence of discipline and invincible courage that troops can give. But more, \u2014 the effect of the conduct which none but regulars could have shown, must be considered. The next morning the enemy retreated, leaving the field strewed with their dead, and having lost, by their own confession, five hundred in killed and wounded ; but we have found out since that his loss was much greater. The enemy's artillery was nume rous, and served with great rapidity and precision ; while we had little cavalry, and they had an immense proportion of that arm. Hence our shell and grape-shot told briskly among them. In short, we gained on that day a great victory. When we consider the enemy's numbers, his numerous and effective regular cavalry, and well-drilled infantry and artillery, and, above all, that he had chosen his own ground, that upon which he is most accustomed to fight \u2014 the plain ; and compare all this with our inferiority in arms, and that we were encumbered by a train we could not afford to lose ; we can only account for the result by the impres sion made on the enemy by our firm and unshaken advance ; by the steadiness with which we repulsed their cavalry, and by the unrivalled skill of our artillery officers and men ; to which must be added a perfect knowledge on the part of both men and officers, that if we lost that battle, the fort at Matamoras must fall, the army be destroyed, and our depot \u2014 Point Isabel \u2014 be taken, to the eternal disgrace of the American army, and the ruin of the interests of our government, for some time at least, in this part of the world. We could not afford to be driven back a single inch, and all were prepared for any thing but retreat.\" The following remarks upon this battle are from a correspondent of the Portsmouth Mercury, and give a clear and concise account of the very active man\u0153uvering which formed an essential feature at Palo Alto : \"At Palo Alto, the view before the battle was beautiful in the extreme. The Mexican lines were of great extent, and were drawn up, with much skill, in terrible array. They outnumbered us more than four to one ; neverthe less, there was no hesitation on our part ; our little army was formed into line at once, and continued to advance in the order of battle with ten pieces of artillery, till we drew the fire from their battery of fourteen guns. We"], [63, "PALO ALTO AND RESACA DE LA PALMA. 57 then halted, corrected our allignment with the precision of a dress parade, and took our part in the ball. The enemy made increasing exertions to outflank us, but without success ; every such attempt uniformly ended in their being obliged to give ground. Whenever their demonstrations threatened our left, that wing of the army half-wheeled to the right, by regiments, and marched by its left flank upon a point, slightly beyond the enemy's extreme right. You will readily perceive, that this diagonal movement enabled us always to pour in a destructive raking fire, scathing their whole line. When they attempted our right, that wing half-wheeled by regiments to the left, and marched, by its right flank, upon a point beyond their left. These movements would leave a Ulrge interval in our centre, and then the Mexican cavalry would prepare to charge through ; but they never could succeed, for a simple 'By companies right and left into line,' re-formed our whole force in the same order as at first, but on ground considerably in advance of its former position. The consequence was that they would recede and try the same man\u0153uvres over again. \"In the mean time, clouds of dense smoke obscured the light of day, and hung over the scene in huge festoons like a funeral pall ; while the thunder of the death-dealing charge, the roaring of cannon, and continued volleys of musketry, deafened the ears and excited the imagination. Round, grape, and canister came hustling through the air, crushing skulls, mutilating limbs, and mangling bodies, till the whole plain was covered with the dying and the dead. For four hours we stood against the tre mendous odds arrayed against us, gradually forcing them to yield ground, till darkness put an end to the slaughter. By the lurid light of a burning prairie, we collected the wounded and buried the dead ; then, fatigued and supperless, we sank in repose upon the bare earth, with the full assurance of a hard day's fight on the morrow. Nor were we disap pointed. Daylight found the enemy retiring to a strong position in the chapparel of Resaca de la Palma. Here, screened by the bushes, the Mexicans waited our approach. General Taylor caused a detail of skir mishers, of whom I was one, to constitute the advance. We drew their fire at about 3 o'clock P. M., and maintained our ground till our regiments came up. The fifth and eighth infantry, with Captain May's squadron of dragoons, charged the enemy's battery, and carried nine brass pieces, when the enemy began to give way. We assisted them with the points of our bayonets, and chased them into the river, where many hundreds of them were drowned.\" In this first day's battle the Mexicans fought with much determination, and, notwithstanding their repulse, remained almost within sight of the American army during the night. General Arista, in his despatch to the Mexican minister of war, written on the field of battle, claims it as a victory. s"], [64, "PALO ALTO AND RESACA DE LA PALMA. 58 After the battle, the first care of General Taylor was to visit the wounded, and see that every comfort was supplied. The constant and well-directed energies of the medical department left but little for him to do ; every one, whether officer or soldier, having been attended with un wavering care and watchfulness. The troops having partaken of their meal, order was given to get the command under arms. The general then summoned a council of war, composed of the heads of the different commands, in all thirteen, exclusive of himself. After returning thanks for their support and bravery during the day, he called on each to give his opinion as to tie proper course to be pursued on the morrow. It was then ascertained that but four out of thirteen were in favour of advanc ing. Of the others, some voted to intrench where they were, and await the assistance of the volunteers, and others to retire at once to Point Isabel ; the general merely remarked, \" I will be at Fort Brown before night, if I live.\"* On the following morning the army recommenced its march for the Rio Grande, which General Taylor denominated Fort Brown, in honour of its lamented defender. When within about four miles of it, they again encountered the enemy encamped on chosen ground, considered impreg nable. It was denominated the pass of Resaca de la Palmas ERE they were not only concealed and defended by dense rows of chapparel, prickly pear, &c, but had also placed their artillery in such a posi tion as completely to sweep the narrow road which wound along the dry bed, or gorge, which gave name to the pass. Seeing this, General Taylor ordered the supply train to be strongly parked, and leaving four pieces of artillery to defend them, he pushed toward the enemy. Captain McCall was sent forward to ascertain their posi tion, and was soon engaged in a severe skirmish. The Americans ad vanced, and the action became general. The enemy were sure of vic tory, and fought with a determination rarely evinced by Mexican soldiery. As the battle advanced, it became evident that victory could not be com pleted by the Americans, without capturing the enemy's batteries. This was a dangerous undertaking ; but the commander intrusted it to Captain May. That gallant officer rode to the front of his men, and the next * \" Lieutenant Ridgely, who was entitled to a vote in the council, was, at the time in attendance on the lamented Ringgold, and, therefore, had no voice in the matter \u2022 but as he galloped up to the battery, on returning from his visit to the major, some one asked\u2014' Ridgely, were you at the council ?' ' No,' he replied, ' I did not know that one had been called, but I hope old Zack will go ahead, and bring the matter to close quarters.' \" t The Dry River of Palma."], [65, "PALO ALTO AND RESACA DE LA PALMA. 59 moment they were sweeping toward the Mexicans. He charged the bat teries, drove away the cannoneers, captured the guns, and dispersed the Tampico veterans, who several times attempted their rescue. In this assault, the Americans lost Lieutenant Inge, and seven men killed and a few wounded. The Mexican loss was heavy, and their general, La Vega, was captured by Captain May. This bold charge decided the fate of the battle. The Mexicans fled in disorder through the ravines and chapparel, and were closely pursued by the Americans. Captain Ker's dragoons and Duncan's artillery led the pursuit, and captured a large number of the fugitives. The American force actually engaged in this battle was about seven teen hundred men. They lost three officers, and thirty-one men killed and seventy-one wounded. The loss of the enemy was very great\u2014 they left two hundred on the battle-field. Eight pieces of artillery, several standards, a large amount of baggage and public property, together with many prisoners, were the rewards of the victors. A writer previously quoted, thus relates several incidents not fully de scribed in the official report : \" At 2 o'clock P. M., we found the enemy drawn up in great force, occupying a ravine which our road crossed ; with thick chapparel or thorny bushes on either side before it reached the ravine, and a pond of water on either side where it crossed the ravine, constituting a defile. They were seven thousand strong ; we fifty-four weaker than on the pre- vious day. The general ordered an immediate attack by all the troops, except the first brigade, which was kept in reserve ; and soon the rattling fire of musketry, mingled with the heavy sound of artillery, announced the commencement of the action. The enemy had chosen his position, which he considered impregnable \u2014 was vastly superior to us in numbers, and had ten pieces of artillery planted in the defile, which swept the road with grape, and which it was absolutely necessary for us to take before they could be beaten. These pieces were flanked on either side by a regiment of brave veteran troops, from Tampico, and we were obliged to stand an awful shower of grape and bullet before a charge could reach them. The battle had lasted some two hours with great fury on both sides, and many heroic deeds had been done, but no serious impression made, when General Taylor sent for Captain May of the second dragoons, and told him he must take that battery with his squadron of dragoons, if he lost every man. May instantly placed himself at the head of his men, and setting off at full speed, with cheers and shouts, dashed into the defile, where he was greeted with an overwhelming discharge of grape and bul- lets, which nearly annihilated his first and second platoons ; but he was seen, unhurt, darting like lightning through this murderous hail-storm, and, in a second, he and his men drove away or cut to pieces the artillerists."], [66, "PALO ALTO AND RESACA DE LA PALMA. 60 \"The speed of his horses was so great, however, that they passed through the battery, and were halted in its rear. There, turning, he charged back, and was just in time to rescue a Mexican general officer, who would not leave his guns, and was parrying the strokes of one of his men. The officer handed his sword to May, announced himself as General La Vega, and gave his parole. May turned him over to an officer, and galloping back to General Taylor, reported that he had captured the enemy's bat tery, and the gallant General La Vega, bravely defending it, whose sword he had the honour to present his commanding officer. The general was extremely gratified, and felt no doubt that a blow had been given, from which it would be difficult for the enemy to recover Colonel Bel knap, leading his regiment into the thickest of the fight, seized a Mexican standard, and waving it over his head, dashed on in front of his men, until his horse stumbled over some dead bodies, and threw him. Being a heavy man, he was helped on his horse by a soldier, who in the act received a ball through his lungs, and at the same moment a shot carried away the Mexican flag, leaving but the handle with the colonel. He dashed ahead with that, however, and his regiment carried every thing before it. At this moment the Mexicans gave way entirely, and, throwing down their arms, fled in every direction, leaving all their stores, munitions of war, arms, standards, &c. The killed, wounded, and prisoners, including those who were drowned in the Rio Grande, do not fall short of eighteen hundred \u2014 so that the enemy's loss in two days amounts to at least two thousand men, something more than the number we had in our army. \"When Lieutenant Magruder introduced General La Vega to General Taylor, the latter expressed his deep regret that such a misfortune should have happened to an officer whose character he so highly esteemed, and returned to him his sword which he had so bravely won.\" Another officer thus writes : \" On reaching the point of the road where May would have been discovered by the enemy, he was stopped by Ridgely, who told him that the enemy had just loaded their pieces, and if he charged them, he would be swept away, adding, ' Stop, till I draw their fire.' He then deliberately fired each gun. So terrible was the effect of the grape that the Mexicans poured their fire upon his pieces, and then May charged like a bullet, drove off their can noneers, took La Vega prisoner, and retreated. Here Lieutenant Inge, a gallant soldier, was killed just behind May, and afterwards stripped. Lieu tenant Sackett had his horse shot under him, and was precipitated into the pond, but rose again and escaped, covered with mud and water. The squadron suffered very much. I am sure May feels grateful to Ridgely for his cool judgment and timely advice. Had he charged on the battery, loaded with grape as it was, I do not believe he would have saved a man.\""], [67, "PALO ALTO AND RESACA DE LA PALMA. 61 The battle-fields of the 8th and 9th are thus described by eye-wit nesses : \"Our troops were resting on the battle-ground. Alas! what a sad picture presented itself. Around were lying heaps of dead, dying, and disabled men. The sigh, the groan, the shriek of agony filled the air, whilst the eye could not rest upon a spot, but it met with a head, a leg, an arm, a body cut off by the waist, or the more fortunate dead, who had received their death-wound from the rifle or musket.\" \"Resaca de la Palma battle-ground is covered with the graves of our fallen countrymen, who fell many of them fighting hand to hand with the enemy. Terribly were they avenged, however, on the spot, for their antagonists are buried around them by hundreds. I was shown one grave near the spot where the brave Cochrane is interred, in which some eight Mexicans are said to have been placed, and there are many more which each contain a score or two of the slaughtered foe. The grave of poor Inge was pointed out to me. It is near where one of the enemy's batteries was posted. It was with feelings of deep sadness that I recalled to mind the many virtues of this gallant and noble-hearted officer. He had left a young wife in Bal timore, and had arrived at Point Isabel, with a body of recruits just in time to march with General Taylor. He had distinguished himself in both bat tles by his heroic daring, and fell at the moment when that brilliant victory, to which he contributed so largely, was about to declare itself in favour of our arms. Mexican caps and remnants of their clothing are scattered here and there, and the whole field is dotted with marks of the enemy's camp fires. It is a wild-looking place, and so advantageous was the position of the enemy, that it will ever remain a wonder to me that our little army was not cut to pieces by their greatly superior force. Over a great portion of the ground on which our army prepared to attack them, the thickets are so dense that a dog would find it difficult to penetrate them. The men actually pushed each other through these thickets, and became divided into small squads of from three to six. HE Palo Alto battle-field, on this side, near the edge of the chapparels, is an open prairie, quite level, and a most magnificent place for the meeting of two armies. The positions of the Mexican lines were pointed out to me, and we rode over a part of the field where the battle raged the hottest. They are represented as having presented a very warlike as well as wild and picturesque appearance, as our troops approached' them. Their compact lines extended from an elevated point of chapparels on their right about a mile ; while their left stretched across the road near its entrance to the pass. I visited the place where some of their heavy artillery opened upon our army, and against which our two eighteen-pounders were for a time F"], [68, "PALO ALTO AND RESACA DE LA PALMA. 62 directed. Convincing evidences of the skill with which our artillery was used were still perceptible upon that part of the field ; for although they were permitted to bury their dead, and afterwards returned in numbers and spent considerable time in that employment, I counted some thirty dead bodies, stretched out as they fell in that immediate vicinity. OME had been nearly severed in two by cannon-ball ; others had lost a part of the head, both legs, a shoul- der, or the whole stomach. Of many of them nothing but the bones, encased in uniform, was left ; whilst others had been transformed into mummies, retaining the expression of countenance which their death ago- nies had stamped upon them. One man, who had been shot between the hips with a large ball, lay dou- bled up as he fell, with his hands extended, and his face downward, be tween his knees. Another, whose shoulders and back were shot away, seemed to have died in the act of uttering a cry of horror. Dead horses were scattered about in every direction, and the buzzards and wild dogs were fattening upon their carcasses.\" The daring reconnoissance of Lieutenant Blake is thus related by tne officer who accompanied him : \"After the line of battle had been formed, General Taylor rode along it to survey his command. Every man was perfectly cool, and had they been about to take dinner, they could not have been more indifferent. At this time the general had not the slightest knowledge as to whether the enemy had any artillery or not. The long prairie grass prevented any one from distinguishing it, when masked by men in front of the pieces. What was to be done ? It was an all-important point. Captain May was ordered to go forward with his squadron, reconnoitre the enemy, and, if possible, draw a fire from their artillery, but to no purpose ; they took no notice of him. Lieutenant Blake then proposed to go forward alone and reconnoitre. I was close to him, and volunteered to accompany him. He consented, and we dashed forward to within eighty yards of their line, the whole army looking on us with astonishment. Here we had a full view. The lieutenant alighted from his horse, and, with his glass, surveyed the whole line, and handed it to me. After making a similar observation, I returned the glass. Just then two officers rode out toward us. I men tioned it to Blake, and requested him to mount. He quietly told me to draw a pistol on them. I did so, and they halted. Had they thought proper, they could have fired a volley from their main line and riddled us both. We then galloped along their line to its other end, there examined them again, and returned. Scarcely had Blake reported, when their bat teries opened upon our line, and the work of destruction commenced. Our examination proved to be correct.\""], [69, "PALO ALTO AND RESACA DE LA PALMA. 63 The particulars of Major Ringgold's death are given from the letter of a distinguished officer in the United States navy. \"The engagement of the 8th was entirely in the hands of the artil lery, and the major took a most active and important part in it. About 6 o'clock he was struck by a six-pound shot. He was mounted, and the shot struck him at right angles, entering the right thigh, pass ing through the holsters and upper part of the shoulders of his horse, and then striking the left thigh in the same line. On the evening of the 9th, he reached this camp (Camp Isabel) under charge of Dr. Byrne, of the army. An immense mass of muscles and integuments were carried away from both thighs, but the arteries were not divided, nor the bones broken. I remained with him all night. He had but little pain, and, at intervals, had some sleep. On dressing his wounds, in the morn ing, they presented a most unfavourable aspect. During the night he gave many incidents of the battle, and spoke with much pride of the exe cution of his shot. He directed his shot not only to groups and masses of the enemy, but to particular men in their line. He saw them fall, and their places occupied by others, who in their turn were shot down, he pointing his gun to the same place, and feeling as confident of hitting his mark as though he had been using a rifle. \" He continued to grow worse, and a medical officer remained constantly by his side. Dr. Byrne was with him during the night, using every means which could be devised to save his valuable life, but without effect. He continued to grow worse, and finally expired, having survived his wounds sixty hours. During the whole time he had but little pain, conversed cheerfully, and made all his arrangements for his approaching end, with the greatest composure and resignation.\" Upon receiving news of the battle of the 8th, and the defeat of the 9th, the Mexican general, Parrode, issued a proclamation exhorting the Mexicans to use greater exertions, and promising success for the future. The victory of the 9th was complete. So great was the hurry of the Mexicans to escape the ardour of their pursuers, that scores of them were drowned in the river, and immense quantities of baggage, military stores, and camp equipage fell into the hands of the Americans. Among the latter was the property, both personal, public and private, of General Arista, together with all his despatches. The American army passed the night on the battle-field, and on the fol lowing morning an exchange of prisoners took place, by which they reco vered all those held in Matamoras, including Captain Thornton. General Vega was offered his parole, but refused accepting it, on the ground that the Mexicans would not allow him to remain neutral in his own country. On the 1 1th, General Taylor again left Fort Brown for Point Isabel, in order to have an interview with Commodore Connor, commander of the"], [70, "PALO ALTO AND RESACA DE LA PALMA. 64 American Gulf squadron. While at the point, he despatched a hasty letter to Washington, from which we give such extracts as may serve to illus trate his plans at that time. \" I avail myself of this brief time at my command to report, that the main body of the army is now occupying its former position, opposite Ma tamoras. The Mexican forces are almost disorganized, and I shall lose no time in investing Matamoras, and opening the navigation of the river. I am under the painful necessity of reporting, that Lieutenant Blake, Topo graphical Engineers, after rendering distinguished service in my staff, during the affair of the 8th instant, accidentally shot himself with a pis tol the following day, and expired before night. \"I have exchanged a sufficient number of prisoners to recover the com mand of Captain Thornton. The wounded prisoners have been sent to Matamoras \u2014 the wounded officers on their parole. General Vega and a few other officers have been sent to New Orleans, having declined a parole, and will be reported to Major-general Gaines. I am not conversant with the usages of war in such cases, and beg that such provision may be made for these prisoners as may be authorized by law. Our own prisoners hare been treated with great kindness by the Mexican officers.\""], [71, "GENERAL WORTH. CAPTURE OF MATAMORAS. \u2022 T the interview with Commodore Conner, Gene f ral Taylor arranged the plan of a combined land > and naval attack upon the Mexican posts on the Rio Grande. Early on the 13th, he left Point Isabel, accompanied by his staff, and procoeded toward Fort Brown. Aster riding a short J;s- tance, he received intelligence that the Mexicans were assembling a large force at Barita, a post on the river below Matamoras. He, therefore, altered his original plan, and in order to prepare for this danger, returned lo Point Isabel. Here he was gratified with the sight of a large number of volunteers and regular troops, who had just arrived from New Orleans. They were from the states of Louisiana and Alabama, and composed a part of the force for which the general had formerly petitioned. This accession enabled him to draw from the point a force of over six hundred men, accompanied by a train of artillery, nearly three hundred wagons, and a large quantity of military and other stores. With this force, he set out on the mornino- of the 14th, and reached Fort Brown without interruption. 9 ** \u00ab5"], [72, "CAPTURE OF MATAMORAS. 66 The first object of the general was an attack upon Barita. As he there anticipated considerable opposition, he took every precaution to organize such a force for its reduction as would ensure success. The commander of the assailants was Lieutenant-colonel Wilson, of the first infantry. He had three companies of volunteers, two from Louisiana, under Captains J. F. Stockton, and G. H. Tobin, and the other from Alabama, under General Desha. The colonel crossed the river, and marched down toward the depot, which, contrary to all expectation, he entered without opposition. Many of the inhabitants fled at his approach ; but after hearing that the Americans not only offered no injury to the citizens, but also permitted them to pursue their accustomed avocations, they returned, and soon business not only re vived, but Barita became an important station to the American army. The position of this place, together with the movements of Colonel Wil son, are thus described by an officer of the command : \"La Barita, May 17th. \u2014 I am here to select a site for the depot of our new base of operations, and to intrench. This village is about ten miles from the mouth of the river, and the same distance from Brazos Santiago, or Fort Polk. (Point Isabel.) The prominent features which might induce me to decide upon this, as the proper point for the depot, are, that it is the first high land you reach in ascending the river, that it is above hurricane tides, that the ground is naturally formed for a military position, command ing every thing around it, and commanded by nothing. It is equi-distant, and not very inaccessible from our other depots. The worst road is to Fort Polk ; while the direct line is only ten miles, the only road for wagons is over twenty. Colonel Wilson has four companies of his own regiment here, and four of volunteers. HIS movement up the river was intended to have been a combined one with Commodore Conner. It has been delayed two days in consequence of unfavourable weather ren- dering the bar too rough. The commodore's limited stay here compelled him to notify the general not to count upon his co-opera- tion in an expedition up the river. This morning at daylight I started the Neva (a river boat) out from the Brazos. She entered the Rio Bravo without difficulty about 8 A. M., and some time after I rode down the beach. Colonel Wilson's command has been bivouacking for two days on our side of the mouth. We crossed them all over by 12 ; and before 1 P. M. the column was en route up the river. The banks of the river are but slightly higher than the surface of the water for some miles"], [73, "CAPTURE OF MATAMORAS. 67 up. The whole country low, and filled with lagoons. There is a high ridge of sand hills, some twenty feet high, extending up and down the coast directly on the beach. The country back of this ridge is one vast plain of prairie and lagoon. The road up the river is tolerably good. The river is very serpentine. The road runs from bend to bend, the dis tance by river being nearly double that by road. The road up the right bank is skirted to the left and south by lagoons, until you reach Barita ; so that a march of a column up this side is by no means exposed to a thick attack.\" i'^MW\u00a7M\u00a7& FTER the capture of this station. General Taylor hurried I^^Pd___l^W- h'S PreParations t0 cross the Rio Grande, and attack IslilrJSyiilt Matamoras. S\u00b0 great, however, was his want of the $j%JFT^^Wi\\ necessaly means of transportation, that he was not able |^|psws^.-|a\u00abi to complete all his arrangements before the evening: of the 17th. Orders were then issued, for Colonel Twiggs to cross above the city, while, simultaneous with his movements, Colonel Wilson was to make a demonstration from Barita. At this moment the Mexican general, Reguena, arrived at the American camp, and stated to General Taylor that he had been empowered by Arista to negotiate for an armistice. To this the general replied that an armistice was out of the question ; that a month ago he had proposed one to Ampudia which was declined, but that circumstances were now changed ; that he had not provoked the first hostilities, but in consequence of receiving large reinforcements, he \u25a0would not now suspend them ; and finally, that he was determined to take the town. He added, however, that the Mexicans might withdraw their troops and public property. The Mexican general promised an answer in the afternoon ; but none coming, General Taylor commenced his preparations for crossing, which was done on the following morning. No opposition was experienced, and it was soon ascertained that the army had evacuated the city during the night. A message was then sent to the prefect demanding a surrender, and assuring him that every right of the citizens should be respected. To this an answer was returned that the city was at Taylor's disposal, and accordingly the Americans encamped, and commenced preparations to march into it on the following morning. The following letter, from a member of the army, gives a graphic description of the city, as well as many interesting incidents connected with its capture. \" We reached this point (Matamoras) on the 25th of May. The coun try through which we passed was lovely in the extreme \u2014 being as level as a bail-room floor, and full of little chapparels and muskeet groves. Our road, though not exactly following the meanderings of the river, touched"], [74, "CAPTURE OF MATAMORAS. 68 its banks often enough to obtain water every mile or two. The citizens were friendly to us, and showed little displeasure at the invasion. In fact, some of them expressed their wish that the country should be governed by Americans or some other people, that would guaranty them a liberal and stable government, so much had they been annoyed by the internal con vulsions of their own. At every house we found three or four men, which induced me to believe that the press-gang had met with poor success among them. They say that it is not their disposition to play the soldier at any time, particularly the present, and when the call is made for troops they leave their homes in possession of the women, and find business in the chapparel. They are a happy, simple people, whose aim seems to be to make provision for to-day, leaving to-morrow to look out for itself. All along the road they were found waiting with milk, a sort of bread, which they call tortillias, cheese, poloncas, or maple sugar, and a sort of liquor resembling, in looks and taste, San Croix rum. We paid them liberally for all we obtained, which to them must have presented a strong contrast to the Mexican soldiery, who spread dismay and devastation among their own people wherever they go. It seems to have been the desire of every man in our ranks to make the line of disparity between the American and Mexi can soldiers as palpable as possible ; and the good effect of such conduct, if not immediately developed, will in the course of tune be more apparent. Our march was very heavy, particularly during the day we left the Bari tas, and some of our young men were very much used up. Two from Company A were so much affected by the scorching sun as to be unable to proceed further, and stopped at the house of a Mexican, where they re ceived the utmost kindness and attention during the night, and were fur nished with horses in the morning to catch up with us. \"It was about ten o'clock in the morning when we reached the town of Matamoras, though its white buildings, so different from those we had passed on the route, had attracted the eye long before that time. There was something far more attractive to the eye than the white buildings of the town \u2014 something to awaken a thrill of pleasure in the breasts of the whole regiment \u2014 the stripes and stars were majestically floating in the breeze from the highest point in Matamoras, and between the river and the town hundreds and hundreds of white tents were pitched in such admira ble order as to induce the beholder to think it a great town. \"As we entered the town at the east end, thousands of people sallied out of their houses to look upon us, whose looks more bespoke a welcome to their own army than to that of the invaders. At many a half-opened door or window was to be seen the head of a senora, whose timidity or modesty (albeit they allow so little to the Mexicans) forbade their emerging into the streets. Some of these women are indeed beautiful, though a great major ity are indolent, slovenly and destitute of that female delicacy which cha-"], [75, "CAPTURE OF MATAMORAS. 69 racterizes our own women. Their common dress is a white muslin skirt tied quite loosely around the body, without any bodice ; their chemise being the only covering for their breast, in which they wear their jewelry and cross. I did not see one pair of stockings in all the town. From this style of dressing you will infer that pride of dress gives way to comfort and ease, and that, too, in a greater degree than I think the largest liberty would warrant them indulging in. I went into a house yesterday evening, occupied by an old man and two daughters, both speaking a sufficiency of English to be understood. After being seated for a few moments, the eldest of the daughters went to the bed and brought to me a lovely and inte resting child, as white almost as any of our own people. She informed me that she was married about two years ago to a Texan prisoner, and that he had been killed whilst fighting under General Taylor. She spoke in the highest terms of her deceased lord, and seemed to worship his image in the child. She is a lovely creature, and, I think, deeply devoted to our cause. \" Matamoras is a much handsomer place than I expected to find it. It covers two miles square, though by no means as compact as an American city \u2014 every house except those around the public square, has a large gar den attached. The houses in the business part of the town are built after the American fashion, though seldom exceeding two stories in height. All the windows to these buildings are grated from top to bottom with iron bars, and half of the door only opens for admittance, which gives them the ap pearance of prisons more than business-houses. The public square is in the centre of the town, and must have been laid off by an American or European, for the Mexicans never could have laid it out with such beauty and precision. On the four sides of the square, the houses are built close together, as in block, and are all of the same size and height, with the ex ception of the cathedral, which, though unfinished, still towers above the others. In these houses are sold dry goods, groceries, and every kind of wares, with now and then an exchange or coffee-house. They are princi pally occupied by Europeans, and you can hear French, English, Spanish and German spoken at the same time. After leaving the public square on either side, the houses decrease in size and beauty for two or three squares, when the small reed and thatched huts commence, and continue to the ex treme limits of the place. \" In walkino- through the streets, my attention was attracted to a house, in the door of which stood, or leaned, two half-naked Mexicans, so wo begone as to cause me to halt. On my nearing the door, a most disagreeable stench almost induced me to recede. I mustered courage to enter the door. On the floor, lying upon mats without covering, were near fifty Mexicans, wounded in the late engagements, attended by some ten or twelve women. The smell of the place was insufferable, and I had to leave it. The next"], [76, "CAPTURE OF MATAMORAS. 70 door was the same, and so on for about twenty houses. A friend of mine called my attention to a room in which there were at least forty of these miserable objects, and this room was scarcely twelve feet square. There was not positively room for the nurses to attend them. Some had lost a leg, others an arm, and some both legs and arms. I noticed one who will certainly get well, whose legs were shot off, within two or three inches above the knee, and he seemed to me to have a greater flow of spirits than some who had only flesh wounds. I said to him, that had his wounds been made by a Mexican shot, he would have been d-ead ; to which he replied, 'The American shot was very good \u2014 no poisonous copper in them.' One had died just before I entered the room, and they were making preparations to carry him out. He had been shot in the mouth by a rifle ball which passed under the left ear, and he had lived from the 9th, up to this time. There are between three hundred and fifty and four hundred of these hor rid objects in this place, and the sight of them would induce many a stout heart to lament the horrors of war. These men give the number of killed and wounded on the 9th, much greater than the Americans ever claimed \u2014 some say twelve hundred, and some fifteen hundred, but enough of them. Lieutenant Wells, of the spies, informed me yesterday, that General Arista had halted at the distance of eight}* miles from this place, and is receiving reinforcements quite briskly. Lieutenant Wells, with a few men, followed them sixty miles. The Mexicans say, he (Arista) will certainly return and attack us at this place, but the best informed Americans entertain no such idea.\" OLONEL TWIGGS was appointed as governor of Matamoras, and immediately after, the old governor, or prefect, left for the interior. Pub- lie as well as private property was respected, busi ness went on as usual, and every exertion made by the American officers to give peace and security to the citizens. Immediately after the capture of the city, General Taylor issued a pro clamation to the inhabitants of Mexico, setting forth at length the causes of the war, his own conduct toward the Mexican population, the tyranny of their rulers, and the desire of the United States speedily to terminate the war in a manner honourable to both countries. Such were the principal events attending the capture of Matamoras. The victors found an immense quantity of military stores, as well as pri vate personal property, among which was much belonging to General Arista. In their flight the Mexican army had endeavoured to conceal all that they could not carry with them ; and accordingly, large supplies of ball, cannon, small arms and munitions of every sort, were found secreted in cellars, wells, and other places, where they had been thrown by the re-"], [77, "CAPTURE OF MATAMORAS. 71 treating soldiers. The supplies in Matamoras would have provisioned a besieged army for many months. For the first time since the movement from Corpus Christi, the Ameri cans were permitted to encamp in habitable quarters, and be unannoyed by the prospect of a momentary attack. They were entitled to this privi lege. The fatigues of a march across the desert, a destitution of food and water, the suspense attending the investment of the two forts, and the weariness and suffering of bombardment and battle, had exhausted nature ; for a while they were to be rewarded \u2014 at least with that reward which is the most that a soldier can expect."], [78, "STORMING OF MONTEREY. FTER the capture of Matamoras, large num- bers of volunteers reached Point Isabel and the Rio Grande, swelling the force under General Taylor to a large army. This acces- sim, however, rather embarrassed him than otherwise. He was encompassed with diffi- culties ; the enemy could not be reached but by a fatiguing march into the interior ; to effect which, he had neither supplies for his army, nor means of transportation. Besides this the Mexicans, on their march, had been care ful to remove all provisions, and every ether article which might be of use to the invaders. On the other hand, should the Americans remain en camped at Matamoras, not only would the enemy have an opportunity to concentrate a larger force than they had hitherto displayed, but the troops would become dispirited by long inaction, and perhaps wasted by disease. His instructions from government were also of a very indefinite character,"], [79, "STORMING OF MONTEREY. 73 tending rather to increase his embarrassment, than to mark out a satisfactory course of duty. Amid these perplexing circumstances, General Taylor thought it more prudent to advance into Mexico, than to expose his troops to the numerous dangers consequent upon inactivity. Preparatory to the march of his main army, he despatched Captain McCulloch and the Texan Rangers to scour the country, and, if possible, make himself master of some of the Mexican posts near the Rio Grande. The party soon captured the ports of Mier, Reyonosa, and Camargo. General Worth was subsequently sent to San Juan, and Captain Wall to Reyonosa. On the 5th of August the main army left Matamoras and proceeded toward Camargo. On the 5th of September, news was brought to General Taylor, that Ampudia had entered Monterey at the head of three thousand men, and that the Mexicans were making every preparation to fortify the place for a successful defence. Upon the reception of this intelligence, he appointed Major-general Patterson to superintend the posts in the immediate vicinity of the river, and marched for the city on the 6th. On the same day he crossed the San Juan, and on the 7th took up his line of march for Seralvo, which was already occupied by an advance corps under General Worth. He soon received intelligence from that officer, that the Mexicans were in such force at Monterey, as to threaten an attack upon his position before the commander could arrive. He therefore hurried on by forced marches, reached Seralvo and relieved General Worth. Meanwhile some of the troops at Camargo succeeded in capturing sixty Mexicans, on the evening of the. 11th. They were well armed with carbines, had a supply of ammunition and pack mules, and were, no doubt, engaged as spies to the American camp. Some of them were provided with brass balls of an ounce weight, and a spy-glass. These men were all detained as prisoners of war. After the junction of the commander with General Worth, they pushed forward too-ether to Marin, upon the borders of the San Juan river, where the army encamped on the night of the 17th. On the following morning they resumed their march, moving in three divisions, separated from each other by a few miles, and having Gillespie and McCulloch, with a squadron of dragoons, in advance. Each division with its train occupied about three miles, having two companies in the rear of the whole,and the vo lunteers so placed, that they could retire to the centre in case of an attack. At night they reached San Francisco, within thirteen miles of Monterey. The city of Monterey is one of the strongest in America. It is built in the old Spanish style, surrounded by massive walls, and having battlements upon the roofs of each house. We give a list of its defences when at tacked by General Taylor, numbering them for future reference. 1st. A strong redoubt of masonry of four faces, with an open gorge of 10 2"], [80, "STORMING OF MONTEREY. 74 ten feet prepared for four guns, overlooked and commanded by a large stone house in the rear ; the whole prepared with sand-bags and loopholes for infantry. 2d. A strong redoubt of four faces defended by an open gorge of twenty feet and prepared for three guns. 3d. Fleches of masonry for infantry. 4th. A strong masonry work (tete du pont) in front of the bridge of the Purisiana. 5th. A strong redoubt for one gun, but which was not occupied by the enemy during the attack. 6th. A strong redoubt of masonry for three guns, overlooking the ap proaches from Cadereita, and commanding the gorge of No. 2. 7th. A strong redoubt of masonry for three guns, overlooked and com manded by a large stone house, prepared for infantry by loopholes and sand bags. Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, were connected by breastworks of earth, and brush for infantry, thus forming a complete line of defence from 4 to 7. Barricades of masonry twelve feet thick, with embrasures for guns, were erected in every part of the city. The house-tops and garden walls were loopholed throughout the city, and furnished with sand bags, for infantry defence. 8th. The cathedral in the main plaza, forming the principal magazine of the enemy. The plaza itself was surrounded on all sides by the strong est buildings in the city, all of which were garrisoned and defended by large bodies of troops, and stores of artillery and musketry. The streets leading to it were parked with artillery, and every house provided with loopholes for the guns of the infantry. Outside of the city was a steep hill, called, by the Mexicans, Independencia. This was defended by seve ral forts, and the \"Bishop's Palace,\" an immense structure; and to use the language of a volunteer, bristling with cannon and bayonets. This commanded all the passes to the Saltillo road, and was a most favourable station to resist a direct assault, or annoy an enemy acting against the city. 9th. Fort Independence or Citadel. This is a large rectangular stone building, of which only the walls remain. It is surrounded by an en closed work of solid masonry, having four bastion fronts, and prepared for thirty-one guns. From No. 7, along the southern edge of the town, a stone wall, four feet thick, prepared for embrasures for guns, and banquettes for infantry, extended beyond the plaza. The attack upon Monterey was conducted by two divisions of the army, acting separately and independently. The one directed against the city itself was commanded by General Taylor in person, assisted by General Butler, while General Worth, with his detachment, was detached to storm the Bishop's Palace and the other forts outside of Monterey. Each of these merits a particular description."], [81, ""], [82, ""], [83, "STORMING OF MONTEREY. 77 Aster a careful reconnoissance of the surrounding country, which proved the necessity of a separate operation against the Bishop's Palace, General Worth was ordered toward that station. He left the camp at 2 o'clock P. M., on the 20th, and at the same time Generals Twiggs and Butler were ordered to make a diversion to favour his march. At night, a small battery was erected opposite the citadel. In the morning, a second diver sion was made to favour the march of General Worth. The infantry and artillery of the first division, May's dragoons, Texas volunteers, and some other troops, were ordered to this service. The firing soon commenced with spirit, and both armies fought with a fierce determination to conquer. Lieutenant-colonel Garland's command entered the city, and attempted a capture of the first fort ; but their loss soon became so heavy that they were withdrawn. Captain Backus, however, mounted the roof of a tan nery, from which he poured a most destructive fire into the fort, and at the same time a large body of volunteers attacked it with energy. It was finally carried by General Ouitman's brigade. About the same time Gene ral Butler was wounded and compelled to quit the field. A heavy fire was now kept up by almost all the enemy's batteries. Colonel Garland made a second attempt to enter the town by carrying a bridge ; but, although nobly supported by his men, he was obliged to desist, and withdrew to No. 1. At the same time the enemy made a demonstra tion of cavalry near the battery opposite the citadel ; but they were re pulsed by Captain Bragg. The lancers had previously charged upon the Ohio and a part of the Mississippi regiments in some fields at a distance from the town, and were repulsed with loss. At the approach of night, operations ceased, and the men were ordered to give additional strength to the captured works during the night. On this first day's attack the Americans lost, in killed and wounded, three hundred and ninety-four. During the night, the enemy evacuated nearly all his defences in the lower part of the city ; and on the following morning, General Quitman commenced his march for the main plaza. The commander ordered General Henderson to his support, assisted by Captain Bragg's artillery. Their firing soon became destructive, and a portion of the large cathedral was battered down. The troops advanced from house to house, and from square to square, until they reached a street but one square in rear of the plaza, near which the enemy's force was principally concentrated. The advance was continued with due caution, until the falling buildings ren dered it dangerous to continue the fire, when the troops were ordered to fall back. This they did in good order. Nothing was effected during the night, and the reception of overtures of capitulation on the following morn ing terminated all further hostilities. In the following letter we have a description of the principal operations : a 2"], [84, "STORMING OF MONTEREY. 78 \"At noon of the 20th, General Worth marched from the camp, east of the town, in the directii n of the heights west, McCulkxh's and Gillespie's companies of rangers forming the reconnoitering party. At night, the division bivouacked almost within range of the guns stationed upon the highest point of the hill on which the Bishop's Palace is situated. At daylight of the twenty-first, the column was again in motion, and, in a few moments, was turning the point of a ridge, which protruded out toward the enemy's guns, bringing us as near to them as their gunners could desire. They immediately opened upon the column with a how itzer and twelve-pounder, firing shell and round-shot as fast as they could discharge their pieces. \" The road now wound in toward a gorge, but not far enough to be out of range of their guns, which still played upon us. Another ridge lay about three-fourths of a mile beyond the first, around the termination of which the road wound, bringing it under the lofty summit of a height which rises between Palace Hill and the mountains, which arise over us on the west. When the head of the column approached this ridge, a bod)* of Mexican cavalry came dashing around that point to charge upon our advance. Captain Gillespie immediately ordered his men to dismount and place themselves in ambush. The enemy evidently did not perceive this man\u0153uvre ; but the moment they came up, the Texians opened upon them a most destructive fire, unsaddling a number of them. McCulloch's company now dashed into them. Captain C. F. Smith's camp, and Cap tain Scott's camp of artillery, (acting as infantry,) and Lieutenant Long street's company of the eighth infantry, with another company of the same regiment, likewise charged upon the enemy. The Texan horse men were soon engaged with them in a sort of hand to hand skirmish, in which a number of them fell, and one Texan was killed and two wounded. \"Colonel Duncan now opened upon them with his battery of light artil lery, pouring a few discharges of grape upon them, and scattering them like chaff. Several men and horses fell under this destructive fire. I saw one horse and rider bound some feet into the air, and both fell dead and tumbled down the steep. The foot companies above named then rushed up the steep, and fired over the ridge at the retreating enemy, a consider able body of whom were concealed from our view, around the point of the hill. About thirty of the enemy were killed in this skirmish, and among them a captain, who, with two or three others, fell in the road. The captain was wounded in three places, the last shot hitting him in the fore head. He fought gallantly to the last, and I am sorry that I cannot learn his name. \" The light batteries, one of which is commanded by Lieutenant Mackall were now driven upon the slope of the ridge, and the howitzers opened"], [85, ""], [86, "CiPTOKE OF THB BISHOf's PALiCB."], [87, "STORMING OF MONTEREY. 81 upon the height of Palace Hill. A few shots only were thrown, before the enemy commenced firing with a nine-pounder from the height imme diately over the right of the column, aiming at Duncan's batteries. The several regiments took positions, and a few more shells were thrown towards Palace Hill, but did no execution. The nine-pounder continued to throw its shot with great precision at our batteries, one ball falling directly in the midst of the pieces, but, fortunately, hitting neither men nor guns. Finding his batteries thus exposed, and unable to effect any thing, Colonel Duncan removed his command to a rancho about half a mile further up the Saltillo road, where General Worth took up his position, after ordering the foot regiments to form along the fence near the point of the ridge. The artillery battalion, fifth, seventh, and eighth infantry, and the Louisi ana volunteers, remained in this position about two hours, directly under fire of the enemy's guns. The balls fell directly in their midst all this time without wounding a man ! To begin with, the Mexicans manage their artillery in battery as well as the Americans do\u2014 this, I believe, is now conceded by every officer. \"At half-past ten, the column moved towards the general's position. At this time, Captain McKavett, of the eighth infantry, was shot through the heart by a nine-pound ball, and a private of the fifth infantry was severely wounded in the thigh, and he died the next morning. About fifty Mexi cans now appeared upon the side hill over the moving column, and fired at our troops some hundred musket-shot, without doing any harm. The division deployed into the position pointed out, and remained an hour or two, vvhen Captain C. F. Smith, of the artillery battalion, with his own company, and Captain Scott's, together with four companies of Texan Rangers on foot, were ordered to storm the second height. This the gallant officer cheerfully undertook, and was followed with enthusiasm by the officers and men of his command. It was considered on all sides to be a dangerous undertaking, and his party was regarded most emphatically as & forlorn hope. That the height would be taken no one doubted, but that many brave fellows would fall in the attempt seemed inevitable. The dis tance to be climbed, after reaching the foot of the hill, was about a quarter of a mile ; a part of the way almost perpendicular, through thorn-bushes and over sharp-pointed rocks and loose sliding stones. \" The seventh infantry, commanded by Captain Miles, was ordered to support Captain Smith's party, and by marching directly to the foot of the height, arrived before Captain Smith, who had been ordered to take a cir cuitous route. Captain Miles sent up Lieutenant Gantt, with a detachment of men upon the hill-side, to divert the attention of the enemy from Cap tain Smith's command, which could not yet be seen. The seventh had already sustained a heavy fire of grape and round-shot, as they forded the San Juan, which winds round the foot of the height, and which fell like a 11"], [88, "STORMING OF MONTEREY. 82 shower of hail in their ranks without killing a man. Lieutenant Gantt's party were greeted with grape and round-shot, which cut the shrubs, and tore up the loose stones about the ranks, without killing any one ; but the gallant young officer came within an inch of being killed by a cannon-shot, which ran down the steep and filled his face with fragments of rock, dust, and gravel. The fire was accompanied by a constant discharge of mus ketry, the enemy covering the upper part of the hill-side ; but the detachment continued to move up, driving the Mexicans back, until they were recalled. APTAIN SMITH'S party now arrived and moved up the hill, the rangers in advance, and did not halt for an instant until the Mexicans were driven from the summit. Whilst this was going on, Colo- nel Persifor F. Smith, who commanded the fifth 1 and seventh infantry \u2014 the fifth, with Blanchard's Louisiana boys, under Major Martin Scott, had been ordered to support the whole \u2014 gave orders for these commands to pass around on each side and storm the sort, which was situ ated about half a mile back of the summit on the same ridge and com manded the Bishop's Palace. Such a foot-race as now ensued has seldom if ever been seen ; the Louisiana boys making tremendous strides to be in with the foremost. Captain Smith had the gun which he took upon the height, run down towards the breastworks, and fired into it. Then came Colonel P. F. Smith's men with a perfect rush, firing and cheering \u2014 the fifth and seventh, and Louisianians, reaching the ridge above nearly at the same time. The Mexicans fired us with grape, but it did not cause an in stant's hesitation in our ranks. Our men ran, and fired, and cheered until they reached the work, the foremost entering at one end, while the Mexi cans, about a thousand in number, left the other in retreat. The colours of the fifth infantry were instantly raised, and scarcely were they up before those of the seventh were alongside. The three commands entered the fort together \u2014 so close was the race \u2014 the fifth a little in advance. J. W. Miller, of Blanchard's company, was among the first four or five who en tered. The three commands may be said to have come out even in the race, for the seventh was not five seconds behind. In less than five mi nutes the gun found in the fort was thundering away at the Bishop's Palace.\" \" On the morning of the 21st, Colonel Childs, of the artillery battahon, with three of his companies \u2014 one commanded by Captain Vinton, another by Captain J. B. Scott, and the third by Lieutenant Ayres \u2014 and three com panies of the eighth infantry\u2014 company A, commanded by Lieutenant Longstreet and Wainright ; company B, by Lieutenant Halloway and Mer chant ; company D, by Captain Scrivner and Lieutenant Montgomery was ordered to take the summit of Palace Hill."], [89, ""], [90, ""], [91, "STORMING OF MONTEREY. 85 \" The colonel left the camp at 3 o'clock, A. M., and climbed the mountain through the chapparel, and up the steep rocks, with such secrecy, that at daybreak he was within one hundred yards of the breastwork of sand bags before he was discovered. Three of the artillerymen having rushed ahead too fast, found themselves in the hands of the Mexicans. They surren dered, and were shot down with the very pieces they had given up. I saw the poor fellows lying there. \"Colonel Staniford went up at daylight with the balance of the eighth, and Major Scott led up the fifth. The Louisiana troops were on the hill, with the fifth, at 8 o'clock, A. M. One of Duncan's howitzers, in charge of Lieutenant Rowland, was dragged up, or rather lifted up, and opened on the palace, which was filled with troops. The Mexicans charged on the howitzer, but were driven back. A constant firing was kept up for several hours, particularly by Blanchard's men, who left a dozen Mexicans dead upon the hill-side. At. length a charge was ordered, and our men rushed down upon the palace, entered a hole in a door that had been blocked up, but opened by the howitzer, and soon cleared the work of the few Mexicans who remained. Lieutenant Ayres was the lucky one who first reached the halyards and lowered the flag. One eighteen-pound brass piece, a beautiful article, manufactured in Liverpool in 1842, and a short brass twelve-pound howitzer, were captured, with a large quantity of ammunition, and some muskets and lances. \"The sort adjoining the palace walls is not complete, but is very neatly constructed as far as it is built. The killed on our side, in taking the palace, were seven \u2014 wounded, twelve. Lieutenant Wainwright was wounded in the side and arm by a musket-ball. Colonel Childs, Captain Vinton, Captain Blanchard, Lieutenant Longstreet, Lieutenant Clark, (adjutant of the eighth,) Lieutenant Ayres, Lieutenant McCown, and the two Nicholls, seem to have been the heroes of the day. The two latter performed prodigies, and not only Judge Nicholls, but old Louisiana may well be proud of such sons. The Mexicans lost at least thirty killed. \" Yesterday morning the whole division under General Worth entered the town on this side, and have been fighting there ever since. The heart of the city is nothing but one fortification, the thick walls being pierced for muskets and cannon, and placed so as to rake the principal streets. The roofs being flat, and the front walls rising three or four feet above the roof, of course every street has a line of breastworks on each side. A ten-inch mortar came around from General Taylor last evening, and it is now placed in the largest plaza, to which our troops have fought step by step and from house to house. Duncan's batteries are in town, and the present impression is that the place will soon be taken. General Worth has H"], [92, "STORMING OF MONTEREY. 86 gained all the strongholds that command the city, and has pushed the enemy as far as they can go without falling into General Taylor's hands on the other side of the city. All this has been done with the loss of only about seventy killed and wounded.\" On the 13th General Taylor received a note from the commandant of the city, requesting him to grant a sufficient time for the women and chil dren to retire from the city with their personal effects. The demand was not granted. Early on the following morning General Taylor received a communica tion from Morales, proposing the delivery of the city on condition of being permitted to take with him all the \"personelle and materielle,\" and being assured that no injury should be done to the citizens who had taken part in the defence. General Taylor replied that this was impossible ; that the city must surrender, though in consideration of its gallant defence the surrender should be upon terms ; and proposed the appointment of commissioners. In accordance with this communication, commissioners were appointed by the two commanders, to arrange the preliminaries of surrender ; and at the same time General Ampudia desired a personal interview with General Taylor. This was granted, and, with a number of officers, the American general proceeded to a house designated as the place at which the inter view was to be held. The parties having convened, General Ampudia announced, as official information, that commissioners from the United States had been received by the government of Mexico ; and that the orders under which he had prepared to defend the city of Monterey had lost their force by a subsequent change of his own government ; therefore he asked the conference. A brief conversation between the commanding generals showed their views to be so opposite as to leave little reason to expect an amicable arrangement between them. General Taylor said he would not delay to receive such propositions as General Ampudia indicated. One of General Ampudia's party \u2014 I think the governor of the city \u2014 suggested the appointment of a mixed commis sion, different from the former. This was acceded to, and General W. G. Worth, of the United States army, General J. Pinckney Henderson, of the Texan volunteers, and Colonel Jefferson Davis, of the Mississippi riflemen, were appointed on the part of General Taylor ; and General J. La Orteo-a, General P. Requena, and Senor the Governor M. la Llano, on the part of General Ampudia. General Taylor gave verbal instructions to his commissioners, which were afterwards prepared in writing by them. These were : I. As the legitimate result of the operations before this place, and the present position of the contending armies, we demand the surrender of"], [93, "STORMING OF MONTEREY, 87 the town, the arms, and munitions of war, and all other public property within the place. II. That the Mexican armed force retire beyond the Rinconada, Lin ares and San Fernando, on the coast. III. The commanding general of the army of the United States agrees, that the Mexican officers reserve their side-arms and private baggage ; and the troops be allowed to retire under their officers without parole, a rea sonable time being allowed to withdraw their forces. IV. The immediate delivery of the main work now occupied, to the army of the United States. V. To avoid collisions and for mutual convenience, the troops of the United States shall not occupy the town until the Mexican forces have been withdrawn, except for hospital purposes, &c. VI. The commanding general of the United States agrees not to ad vance beyond the line specified in the second section before the expi ration of eight weeks, or until the respective governments can be heard from. These terms were refused by the Mexican commissioners, who drew up a counter proposition, which demanded, among other matters, permis sion of the Mexican forces to retire with their arms. This was urged not only as a matter of soldierly pride, but of ordinary courtesy ; but the American commissioners having no power to negotiate further, the meet ing rose to report disagreement. General Ampudia then entered at length upon the question, treating the point of disagreement as one which involved the honour of his country, spoke of his desire for a settlement without further bloodshed, but adding that he did not care for the pieces of artillery which were in the city. General Taylor responded to the wish to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. And it was agreed that the Convention should reassemble, the American commissioners being instructed to concede the small arms. The Mexican commissioners now urged, that as all other arms had been recognised, it would be discreditable to the artillery if required to march out without any thing to represent their main arm, and stated, in answer to an inquiry, that they had a battery of light artillery man\u0153uvred and equipped as such. This fresh obstacle caused the commission again to rise and report disa greement on the point of artillery. Upon hearing that more was demanded than the middle ground, upon which, in a spirit of generosity, he had agreed to place the capitulation, General Taylor arose in a manner which showed his determination to talk no more. As he crossed the room to leave it, one of the Mexican commissioners addressed him, and some private conversation ensued. General Worth then asked permission to address some remarks to General Ampudia, the spirit of which was, that which he had manifested throughout the negotiation\u2014"], [94, "STORMING OF MONTEREY. 88 generosity and leniency, with a desire to spare the further effusion of blood. The commission assembled once more, and finally agreed to the following terms : Terms of capitulation of the city of Monterey, the capital of Nuevo Leon: Agreed upon by the undersigned commissioners, to wit: General Worth, of the United States army, General Henderson, of the Texan volunteers, and Colonel Davis, of the Mississippi riflemen, on the part of Major- general Taylor, commanding-in-chief the United States forces ; and General Requena and General Ortega, of the army of Mexico, and Senor Manuel M. Llano, governor of Nuevo Leon, on the part of Senor General Don Pedro Ampudia, commanding-in-chief the army of the north of Mexico. Art. I. As the legitimate result of the operations before this place, and the present position of the contending armies, it is agreed that the city, the fortifications, cannon, the munitions of war, and all other public pro perty, with the undermentioned exceptions, be surrendered to the command ing general of the United States forces, now at Monterey. Art. II. That the Mexican forces be allowed to retain the following arms, to wit : the commissioned officers their side-arms ; the infantry their arms and accoutrements ; the cavalry their arms and accoutrements ; the artillery one field battery, not to exceed six pieces, with twenty-one rounds of ammunition. Art. III. That the Mexican armed forces retire, within seven days from this date, beyond the line formed by the pass of the Rinconada, the city of Linares, and San Fernando de Presas. Art. IV. That the citadel of Monterey be evacuated by the Mexi can, and occupied by the American forces, to-morrow morning, at ten o'clock. Art. V. To avoid collisions, and for mutual convenience, that the troops of the United States will not occupy the city until the Mexican forces have withdrawn, except for hospital and storage purposes. Art. VI. That the forces of the United States will not advance beyond the line specified in the 2d [3d] article before the expiration of eight weeks, or until the orders or instructions of the respective governments can be received. Art. VII. That the public property to be delivered shall be turned over, and received by officers appointed by the commanding generals of the two armies. Art. VIII. That all doubts as to the meaning of any of the preceding articles shall be solved by an equitable construction, and on principles of liberality to the retiring army."], [95, "STORMING OF MONTEREY. 89 Art. IX. That the Mexican flag, when struck at the citadel, may be saluted by its own battery. Done at Monterey, Sept. 24, 1846. Manuel M. Llano, W. J. Worth, Brigadier-General, U. S. A, T. PiEQUENA, J. PlNCKNEY HENDERSON, Maj. -Gen. Com'g the Texan Volunteers, Ortega. Jefferson Davis, Col. Mississippi Riflemen, Approved : Pedro Ampudia. Z. Taylor, Maj. -Gen. IT. S. A. Com'g. After a short recess, the American commissioners again repaired to the room in which they had parted from the Mexicans. The latter were tardy in joining the Americans, as well as in executing the instrument of capitu lation. The 7th, 8th and 9th articles were added during this session. At a late hour the English original was handed to General Taylor for his examination ; the Spanish original having been sent to General Ampudia. General Taylor signed the instrument and delivered it to Colonel Davis, who returned to receive the Spanish copy with the signature of General Ampudia, and send him the one having General Taylor's signature, so that each general might countersign the original to be retained by the other. General Ampudia did not sign the instrument as was expected, but came in person to meet the commissioners. He unexpectedly began to dispute many points which the Americans had considered settled, and evinced a disposition to make the Spanish instrument differ in essential points from the English. At this conference General Worth was absent. At last Ampudia was required to sign the copy prepared for his own commis sioners, and the English original was left with him, that, according to pro mise, he might have it translated during the night, so as to be ready in the mornino- with a Spanish duplicate of the English instrument left with him. By this means the two would be made to correspond, and he would be compelled to admit his knowledge of the contents of the English original before he signed it. The next morning the commission again met, and the Mexican general renewed his solicitation to gain some grant in addition to the original com pact. At his request, the Americans had previously adopted the word capitulation in lieu of surrender; and he now wished to substitute stipu lation for capitulation. It was now evident to the American commander, that he did not wish to sign at all, but was merely quarreling about names and terms, either to gain time, or to accomplish some other purpose, pel haps not definite even to himself. At length it became necessary, peremp 12 5i"], [96, "STORMING OF MONTEREY. 90 torily to demand his immediate signing of the English instrument, and the literal translation now perfected by the commissioners and their general. The Spanish instrument first signed by General Ampudia was destroyed in presence of his commissioners, and the translation of our own instrument was countersigned by General Taylor and delivered. The agreement was thus complete, and it only remained to execute the terms. OLONEL DAVIS of the Mississippi riflemen, has the following remarks upon the terms of capitulation : \" Much has been said about the construction of article 2d, but whatever ambiguity there may be in the language used, there was a perfect understanding by the commissioners upon both sides as to the intent of the parties. The distinction we made between light artillery equipped and man\u0153uvred as such, designed for and used in the field, and pieces being the armament of a sort, was clearly stated on our side ; and that it was comprehended on theirs, appeared from the fact, that repeatedly they asserted their possession of light artillery, and said they had one bat tery of light pieces. Such conformity of opinion existed among our com missioners upon every measure which was finally adopted, that I consider them in their sphere jointly and severally responsible for each and every article of the capitulation. If, as originally viewed by General Worth, our conduct has been in accordance with the peaceful policy of our govern ment, and shall in any degree tend to consummate that policy, we njay congratulate ourselves upon the part we have taken. If otherwise, it will remain to me as a deliberative opinion, that the terms of the capitulation gave all that could have followed, of desirable result from a further assault. It was in the power of the enemy to retreat and to bear with him his small arms, and such a battery as was contemplated in the capitulation. The other grants were such as it was honourable in a conquering army to bestow, and which it cost magnanimity nothing to give.\" On the same subject, Major-general Henderson says : \" My first impression was, that no better terms than those first proposed on the part of General Taylor ought to have been given, and I said so to the general, when I found him disposed to yield to the request of General Ampudia ; and at the same time gave it as my opinion, that they would be accepted by him before he left the town. General Taylor replied that he would run no risk when it could be avoided, that he wished to avoid the further shedding of blood, and that he was satisfied that our government would be pleased with the terms given by the capitulation ; and being myself persuaded of that fact, I yielded my individual views and wishes ; and under that conviction, I shall ever be ready to defend the terms of the capitulation.\""], [97, "STORMING OF MONTEREY. 91 General Worth, whose valuable services and complete knowledge of the resources of the enemy at Monterey, render his opinion very valuable, has the following language on the same subject : OT only did I counsel and advise the opportunity offered the general-in-chief, in the first proposi tion, but cordially approved his decision in respect to the latter, as did every member of the commission, and for good and sufficient military an(^ national reasons, and stand ready at all * times and proper places to defend and sustain l^e acti\u00b0n of the commanding general, and par ticipation of the commissioners.\" Ampudia announced the fall of Monterey in a despatch to the Mexican Secretary of War, in which he uses every exertion to exaggerate the force and resources of his antagonist, and the difficulties surrounding himself. Throughout the whole Mexican war there is perhaps no event more glorious to the American arms, or more honourable to the valour and hu manity of the American soldier, than the capture of Monterey. If the rule of warfare be true, that to capture a mere fort requires a force superior, in every military point, to the garrison ; and that to conduct a successful as sault against any fortification, the assailants should number at least double their opponents, how may we regard the storming of a city surrounded by high massive walls which supported strong redoubts, whose every street was swept by cross fires of artillery, and every house of which was an armed fortification, by an army only one-half the number of the defenders, inferior in artillery and small arms, and fatigued with a long march across a desert country ! The Mexicans had employed months in fortifying Monterey ; and it was considered by them impregnable. This was no preposterous idea \u2014 it had been formerly attacked by an army vastly supe rior in resources to the Americans, and when its defences were compara tively few and weak, and yet had to brave the utmost efforts of the besiegers ; many of its garrison were veterans, who had seen many battles and had been admired by General Taylor himself on the fields of Palo Alto and Resaca. They were confident of success, and looked upon the advance of General Taylor with calmness and indifference. If we add to this the fact of their immense cavalry force, which was capable of directing its attacks upon any part of the American line, and the necessity of dividing the American army so as to resist the cannonade of the Bishop's Palace, which was as strong as the city itself, we will then have some just appreciation of the magnitude of the American triumph. Its success can be attributed only to the coolness and good discipline .evinced by all our troops, to their intrepidity in rushing forward in the very face of the most tremendous artillery fires, unappalled by the havoc on every side, to the"], [98, "STORMING OF MONTEREY. 92 fearlessness of the officers, ever foremost in danger, and especially to the calm systematic movements of Generals Taylor and Worth. When the excitement of the present will have subsided, and history has had time to weigh what is now but a recent and every-day occurrence, jshe will adjudge it a rank in her scale, by the side of the capture of Quebec and the fall of Yorktown. The invincibility of the Spanish race, when resist ing a siege, was broken at Monterey ; and as much as Wolfe, Wellington, or Bonaparte himself could have done, was there done by General Taylor, and an army of volunteers. FTER the evacuation of the city by the Mexicans, General Taylor established his head-quarters there, and made every preparation to render his wounded comfortable, and to refresh his exhausted troops. He was now in command of the key of Central Mexico, and had he but possessed the means, he could possi- bly have been able to inarch to the capital itself, be- fore the enemy could have recovered from their late disaster. But the same difficulties which had cramped all his previous operations surrounded him here \u2014 he had no means of transportation, and but little prospect of soon obtaining any. The main army was therefore obliged to remain quiet, until circumstances should warrant further active operations. In order, however, to command as much of the country as possible, General Worth was despatched with nearly one thousand five hundred men and eight field-pieces to Saltillo, and General Wool with two thousand four hundred men to Parras. No opposition was experienced by these officers ; the clergy and many citizens, however, fled at their ap proach. A sketch of the former of these places is given by a member of the army, whose style of writing entitles him to consideration. \" Saltillo is by far the best town that I have yet seen in Mexico. It surpasses Monterey in all respects. The cathedral is a fine building of a sort of Moorish or Saracen order of architecture, but gloomy within and disgustingly filthy. There is a great deal of gilding upon rude carved work about the altars and chapels ; but I have seen very little of the precious metals of a solid shape in the churches.\" At Parras, the American army received more than usual favour from the inhabitants ; their sick were attended to, many wants of the soldiers supplied, and many indications given that the people were not dissatisfied with the change of affairs. During these operations the Mexicans were not idle. In their retreat from Monterey, the army had destroyed every thing in their route which might be of serviee to the American army in their expected invasion. The water streams had been stopped or filled up, the wells destroyed, and all provisions carefully removed. Even private property was not re-"], [99, ""], [100, ""], [101, "STORMING OF MONTEREY. 95 spected ; and, indeed, the inhabitants cheerfully yielded up their effects to the flames, rather than, by retaining them, they should become a source of comfort to the hated invaders. It was their intention to make the country supply the deficiency of their arms, and to nullify the victories of the Rio Grande, by opposing to the victors an impassable desert. Meanwhile, un appalled by the loss of Monterey, they were making every effort to or ganize a large and efficient army in the interior ; and declared that the capture of the city was not the fault of the troops, but of Ampudia him self, who was accordingly court-martialed. We shall treat further of these movements of the Mexicans in a subsequent chapter. While the American commander was at Monterey, some unhappy dif ferences between the citizens and volunteers led to several murders on both sides. Many of the troops looked upon the Mexicans as a conquered peo ple, perfectly at their disposal, and were, consequently, not very scrupu lous in their treatment of them. On the other hand, the Mexicans were chafed by shame and defeat, and disposed to consider the Americans as a band of plunderers who had invaded their land for the purposes of rapine and tyranny. Secret retaliation was sought and improved ; and the hid denness of the frequent murders added to their atrocity by rendering it almost impossible to detect and punish the perpetrators. Of course, the subject was extremely vexatious to both General Taylor and the Mexican governor ; but neither could effectually prevent the evil. A correspondence took place between them, of which we subjoin a copy : Governor Morales to General Taylor. September 29, 1846. Multitudes of complaints have been made to this government against excesses committed upon persons and property of Mexicans daily, by vo lunteers in the service of the United States, and I am this moment in formed that three of our citizens have been killed by them without pity or any reasonable motive, only because they possess the power to do so. Under such circumstances, it is impossible that society can remain in much secu rity, as the most essential guarantees are wanting. I have the honour of making this known to your excellency, hoping that measures will be adopted to put an end to such atrocities in future, and to carry into effect the assurances given, of protection to the people. Repeating my esteem and consideration for your excellency, I am, &c. &c. The reply of General Taylor is dated on the 1st of October, and reads as follows : \"The communication of your excellency, dated 29th ultimo, relative to excesses committed by volunteers in Monterey, was duly received. Some delay has occurred in answering it, in order that I might communicate with the commandant of that post."], [102, "STORMING OF MONTEREY. 96 \"It is with sentiments of regret that I learn your just cause of complaint, founded upon the grounds stated by your excellency. Your excellency must be aware that it is no easy task to keep such men in subjection ; and although my great desire is to maintain good order, yet excesses have been committed ; but I believe none of a grave character. \" The volunteers now in the city will be removed in a few days, and by their absence I hope all cause of further complaints will cease. In the mean time, Brigadier-general Worth will use all efficacious measures to maintain order in the city. He is now invested with orders to this effect. Your excellency must be aware, that my desire is to comply with the gua rantees I have given in the name of my government, relative to the secu rity of persons and property.\" The exertions of General Taylor, relative to this subject, seem to have been productive of some benefit ; so that in a short time the evils, although not yet fully removed, were of much less frequency than before."], [103, "SANTA ANNA. BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA. EFORE entering into a detailed acccount of this battle, it may not be amiss to recede for a mo- ment from the regular progress of events, in order to notice some of the important movements which gave rise to it. Perhaps at no time since Mexico was an inde pendent nation, has there been so much of a revo lutionary spirit predominant among all classes, as has existed during her present war with the United States. Against the latter power, nothing but the most united efforts, conducted by active and patriotic generals, can give them the least chance of success ; and yet at the very moment when these are most needed, the nation is distracted by intestine tumults, and the jarrings of ambitious demagogues. In the commencement of the war, as we have seen, General Herrera was at the head of affairs. He seems to have been of a pacific disposition, and well inclined to settle the difficulties with the United States ; but he was speedily deprived of power, and superseded by Gene- 13 I 97"], [104, "BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA. 98 ral Paredes, whose views and designs were entirely different from those of his predecessor. Under his administration, war was declared, and every exertion made to conduct it with vigour. Success, however, did not crown his efforts, and soon the populace, ever ready to judge of men by their fortunes, began to look for another ruler. Several candidates were now in the field, each at the head of a small army, and each differing from the others in all points except one \u2014 hatred and opposition to the United States. A party differing from these soon arose, whose object was the restora tion of the banished Santa Anna. This general, as is well known, long acted a conspicuous part in the revolutions of his country, as well as in the Texan war, and was for a long while Supreme Dictator of all Mexico. In 1844, however, after the siege of Vera Cruz, he was expatriated, and continued afterwards to remain in exile at Havana. The revolution in his favour rapidly gained ground, and was finally consummated by the election of General Salas, his avowed supporter, to the presidency of Mex ico. Puebla and several other large cities declared for him ; Paredes was deposed, and while endeavouring to make his escape with a company of lancers, was arrested and thrown into prison. One avowed object of the restoration was the re-establishment of the constitution of 1824, by which the Mexican states constituted a federal republic, similar to our own coun try, instead of a consolidated republic, which made each separate state a mere department of the Union, and deprived the people in a great measure of representation. In pursuance of this project, General Salas issued a proclamation, directing Congress to meet on the 6th of December, under the rules and restrictions of the aforesaid constitution. Soon after he despatched his two sons to meet and welcome Santa Anna, who was daily expected at Vera Cruz. On the 16th of August, Santa Anna reached Vera Cruz in the ship Arab, having passed through the American blockading squadron under Commodore Conner, without opposition. Upon landing, he immediately placed himself at the head of the movement in that department, and the same day issued a proclamation, setting forth at large his views and de signs with regard to the origin, former conduct, and prosecution of the war. This proclamation was in accordance with a previous one in his favour which had been issued by the city of Mexico, detailing the plan proposed to be pursued by that city. It is as follows : Article I. Instead of the present Congress, another shall assemble, composed of representatives, popularly chosen according to the electoral laws in force for the election of 1824, whose duty shall be as well to frame a constitution for the nation, adopting the form of government which they may deem in conformity to the national will, as to take charge of all mat-"], [105, "BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA. 99 ters relating to the war with the United States, and the affair of Texas, and other frontier departments. The monarchical form of government which the nation evidently detests shall be excluded. Art. 2. All Mexicans, faithful to their country, including those out of the country, are called upon to give it their services in the present national movement, for which purpose very particular invitation is given to his excellency, General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, who is from this time recognised as general-in-chief of all the forces engaged, and resolved to combat, in order that the nation may recover its rights, secure its liberty, and govern itself. Art. 3. Until the sovereign Congress shall assemble and adopt the requisite measures for the war, it will be the indispensable duty of the executive to dictate such measures as may be urgent and necessary to sus tain with honour the national flag, and this sacred duty must be discharged without the loss of a single moment. Art. 4. Within four months from the occupation, by the liberating forces, of the capital of the republic, the Congress referred to in the first article must be assembled ; for which purpose it will be the duty of the general-in-chief to issue the order of convocation, in the terms indicated, and to take care that the elections proceed with all possible liberty. Art. 5. The existence of the army is guarantied, and it is assured of such attention and protection as are due to the well-deserving military class of a free people. Art. 6. Any one will be declared a traitor to the nation, who shall endeavour to retard the assembling of the said Congress, make any attempt against it by infringing the liberty of its members, dissolve it or suspend its sessions, or attempt to oppose the constitution which it may establish, or the laws which it may enact in conformity with the present plan. N September, Santa Anna left the hacienda near Vera Cruz, and advanced towards Ayotla, which he reached on the 14th of September. He here received a com- mission, appointing him supreme dictator, to which he replied in a dignified note, of course accepting the appointment. On the 15th the dictator entered the capital, and was welcomed with demonstrations of joy and confidence. He immediately directed his attention to the raising of money and troops, and for that purpose republished the following proclamations or decrees : 1. (Declaring, in substance, that) all Mexicans between the ages of eighteen and fifty years were under obligations to take up arms in defence of their country whenever required to do so. 2. Declaring free from import duty, for one year, the importation into"], [106, "BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA. 100 any part of the republic, as well as the sale in it, of muskets, carbines, sabres, brass and iron cannon, with gun-carriages, and in general every species of warlike arms and projectiles ; and declaring that the govern ment will purchase such quantity of the arms and projectiles referred to as it may require, and at such prices as may be agreed upon by the importer or holders. 3. Declaring an extraordinary contingent of thirty thousand men, to be contributed by the several states. 4. Giving pardon to all who may have deserted from the regular army, provided that they give themselves up within three months, and permitting them to serve in such corps as they may select. 5. Declaring that all officers, in civil or military employment, who shall refuse, without good cause, in the opinion of the government, to render such services as may be required of them during the war in which the republic is at present engaged, shall be dismissed from their employments, and declared incapable of being employed hereafter as military officers ; being liable, moreover, to the punishment already provided by law for such offences as they may have committed. \u2022T will be remembered that the terms of capitulation at Monterey stipulated for a conditional armistice of eight weeks, during which time neither army was to cross a certain line. General Taylor had no doubt that these terms would be endorsed by his government, but in this he was mistaken. The whole stipulation seems to have been somewhat opposed to the views of the Washington Cabinet, and orders were immediately despatched to the general, to recom mence hostilities. In obedience to the instructions, he directed a letter to Santa Anna, notifying him of the recommencement of hostilities, and requesting the release of some prisoners detained at San Luis Potosi, on the ground of the general's similar conduct to others who had fallen in his hands. Santa Anna replied in a courteous and dignified manner, acknow ledging the conclusion of the armistice, and at the same time releasing the prisoners, and providing money for their journey. This first correspond ence between the two great generals is highly pleasing. While Santa Anna was at San Luis Potosi, every exertion was beino made to raise an army sufficient to arrest all further successes of General Taylor. These operations seemed to have been enthusiastically entered into by the people, and soon the dictator found himself at the head of nearly twenty thousand men. The greater portion of the press warmly seconded his measures, and paraded him to the people as invincible. The following extracts from the leading journal, dated November 14, will give some idea of the spirit of their addresses : \" By the communication which we this day insert, our readers will"], [107, "BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA. 101 learn that General Taylor has declared that he is about to recommence hostilities upon the republic. The moment has arrived, the result is close at hand, of a terrible conflict, which is to decide the future lot of the nation. \" The enthusiasm of our army is great ; it is determined to fall or triumph, and we trust it will know how to avenge with honour the Mexi can blood which flowed at Matamoras and at Monterey. \" The whole world is contemplating this struggle ; its eyes are fixed upon our republic, whose rights and prerogatives as an independent and sovereign nation have been as audaciously as perfidiously trampled upon by the United States of the north. If the republic rises with the emer gency \u2014 if by the elastic impulse of all its citizens, it shall chastise its ene mies, and if by force of arms it makes its international rights respected, from that day forth the fate of Mexico will be eternally fixed, since it assures its independence, its respectability abroad, and its liberty. \"Mexicans ! This is not a question of party \u2014 it concerns our political existence. Let us, then, assist by every means in our power, in the na tional defence ; let us sacrifice ourselves, if it be necessary ; but in suc cumbing, let our last words be ' Independence and Liberty.' \" In December, General Taylor received information that the Mexican general, Urrea, was in the neighbourhood of Victoria, with a large force of cavalry. He, therefore, left Monterey on the 15th of December, and pro ceeded in the direction most favourable for encountering the enemy. Santa Anna was now near Saltillo, and the general soon received further intelli gence of a threatened attack upon that place. Fearing for the safety of General Patterson, who was stationed there, Taylor detached General Q,uit man with a field-battery to join him, while he himself retired towards Monterey. While marching thither, General Wool entered Saltillo with reinforcements, and on receiving intelligence thereof, as well as that the enemy were retiring towards Potosi, General Taylor again marched for Victoria, which he entered on the 30th. Here he received a letter from General Scott, the newly appointed commander of the Army of Occupa tion, requesting a large detachment of his troops, the object of which de mand was to increase the force under Scott, so that it might be able to co operate with the American gulf squadron, in an attack upon the fortress of San Juan de Ulloa and city of Vera Cruz. It was a source of grief to the American commander to be thus suddenly snatched from the prospect of victory, and compelled to retire from his present position, to a condition of comparative inactivity. The troops called for were the flower of his army, the veterans of all his Mexican victories ; and he parted from them with profound sorrow. The following is his address to them at marching from him : \" It is with deep sensibility that the commanding general finds himself i a"], [108, "BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA. 102 separated from the troops he so long commanded. To those corps, regular and volunteer, who have shared with him the active services of the field, he feels the attachment due to such associations, while to those who are making their first campaign, he must express his regret that he cannot participate with them in its eventful scenes. To all, both officers and men, he extends his heartfelt wishes for their continued success and happiness, confident that their achievements on another theatre will redound to the credit of their country and its arms.\" After the departure of these troops, the general again established his head-quarters at Monterey, where he remained until February. He re ceived in that month a considerable number of volunteers, which swelled his disposable force to five thousand four hundred men, with which force he marched from Monterey, determined to fight the enemy on their own ground. Notwithstanding the demonstration of Santa Anna toward Saltillo, his designs seem to have been either of a mixed or hidden character. For a while he seemed disposed to march for Vera Cruz ; then he would advance towards General Taylor; and at one time seemed to be proceed ing to the city of Mexico, in order to quell an insurrection which had lately broken out there. On the 27th of January, he issued an address to his \" companions in arms,\" which, however, was believed by many to be merely a feint to cover his meditated advance to Vera Cruz. The follow ing are extracts : \" Soldiers ! the entire world observes us, and will expect our acts to be heroic as they are necessary. Privations of all kinds surround us, in con sequence of the neglect shown towards us for more than a month, by those who should provide your pay and provisions. But when has misery debi litated your spirits, or weakened your enthusiasm ? The Mexican soldier is well known by his frugality and patience under suffering, never wanting magazines in marches across deserts, and always counting upon the re sources of the enemy to provide for his wants. To-day we shall under take to march over a desert country, without succour or provisions. But be assured, that we shall be immediately provided from those of the enemy, and with them you will be sufficiently reimbursed. My friends, we go to open the campaign. What days of glory await us ! What a flattering future for our country! How satisfactory, when we contemplate that we have saved its independence ! How the world will admire us ! How the nation will bless us ! And when in the bosoms of our families we shall relate the risks and fatigues which we have endured, the combats with and triumphs over a daring and presumptuous enemy ; and hereafter, when telling our children that we have saved our country a second time, the jubilee will be complete, and the sacrifices will then appear to us as no thing. Soldiers ! Hurry forth in the defence of your country. The"], [109, ""], [110, "BA.TTLB OF BTJKNA. VISTA."], [111, "BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA. 105 cause we sustain is a holy one ; never have we struggled with more justice, because we fight for the honour and religion of our wives and children ! What sacrifice, then, can be too great for objects so dear ? Let our motto De \u2014 ' Conquer or die !' Let us swear before the great Eternal, that we will not wait an instant in purging our soil of the stranger, who has dared to profane it with his presence. No treaty, nothing which may not be heroic and proud.\" The subsequent movements of Santa Anna proved that the above was a transcript of his real intentions. He left San Luis on the 2d of February, at the head of a large army, which was distributed as follows : Artillerists with nineteen guns, heavy calibre, 650 Eight regiments, (six of the line, two light troops,) . . . 6240 Light troops, 3200 Under General Parrode, with three pieces heavy calibre, . . 1000 Cavalry on the march, 6000 Artillery, ditto, 250 General Mejia's division 4000 Total, . . 21,340 The artillery were supplied with six hundred rounds of ammunition. Besides these troops, there were large detachments in the field, under Generals Juvera, Minon, and others. On the 7th, they reached Mate huala, a town between Saltillo and San Luis. They were in the utmost distress: in want of food, water, and clothing. One of the officers says: \u2014 \"No honourable resource remains, except to advance without supplies ; to capture them from the immense storehouses of the enemy in Saltillo and Monterey, and to live upon the country. The way to glory and honour is to be preferred to turning our backs upon the enemy. We go to try our fortune, since any thing would be a less evil than to die of hunger and complete inaction, besides being called traitors by those who really are such. If we do march, (without more than twelve days' provision for the troops, and half a month's pay for the officers,) we will live upon the country and the plunder of the enemy, now that they will not furnish us with any supplies.\" It now became necessary for Santa Anna to make the most vigorous exertions in order to save his army from disbandment. Accordingly he negotiated with certain commercial houses of San Luis for drafts, and a loan to the amount of a hundred and eighty thousand dollars, drawing on Mexico and Vera Cruz, and pledging all his private estate as security. This sum enabled his commissary-general to distribute sufficient food and clothing to the troops to continue them on the march to Monterey. On the 20th of February, General Taylor reached Agua Nueva, a place eighteen miles below Saltillo. He retired, however, at the approach of n"], [112, "106 BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA. Santa Anna, and awaited the threatened attack at Buena Vista, a strong position, a few miles south of Saltillo. On the 21st, the Mexicans attacked and defeated a small mounted force engaged to cover the removal of some public stores. At 1 1 o'clock the following day, Surgeon Liedenburg, of the Mexican army, arrived before General Taylor, with a white flag, and a communication to surrender. The demand was, of course, declined. Santa Anna still forbore his attack, no doubt waiting for the arrival of his rear troops, part of whom were already in view of the Americans. Towards evening, the Mexican troops engaged the extreme left, under Colonel Marshall, and considerable man\u0153uvering and skirmishing took place, which lasted till dark. A new order of battle was formed during the night, and the troops slept on their arms, without fires. The Mexicans also threw a body of light troops on the mountain-side, in order to outflank the left. In this position the hostile armies passed the night. Early on the 23d the action recommenced on the left. The enemy attempted to dislodge Colonel Marshall, I ut he sustained their attacks with the greatest coolness, and with but little loss. At 8 o'clock a large body of cavalry advanced to the same point. Part of them were dispersed by Captain Washington's battery, but the main body, aided by a large infantry force, bore down all opposition, routed the second Indiana regi ment, repelled the Illinois, drove back Captain O'Brien, and captured some of his guns. The second Indiana regiment could not be rallied, and many of them continued their retreat to Buena Vista. The enemy now poured masses of infantry and cavalry along the base of the mountain, and were concentrating them in the rear. At this moment, General Taylor, who had been at Buena Vista during the ni<rht, arrived upon the field. He immediately ordered the Mississippi reo-i ment to the left, and brought up the second Kentucky and a section of Bragg's artillery to support them. These arrived in a most happy moment, and, with a portion of the first Illinois under Colonel Hardin, drove back the enemy, and recovered a portion of the lost ground. In a moment, however, the enemy returned, and for a while the action raged with fearful violence. Captain Bragg fought within pistol-range, and Colonel Davis's Mississippians could distinguish the features of the enemy at every discharge of their rifles. The artillery mowed down horses and horsemen by hundreds, and the incessant discharges rolled and reverberated among the broken mountains, like the full thunderings of a whirlwind. The enemy were, at length, thrown into confusion, and a part attempted to retreat to the main line of battle. The first dragoons, under Colonel Rucker, were sent to oppose them, but met with such heavy loss that they returned without effecting any thino-. Meanwhile, a large body of the enemy concentrated to make a descent"], [113, ""], [114, "DEATH OF COLONBL CIAV"], [115, "BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA. 109 upon the hacienda of Buena Vista. this point with two pieces under could reach that point, the enemy Arkansas cavalry, under Colonels Colonel May was ordered to support Lieutenant Reynolds. Before these had been met by the Kentucky and Marshall and Yell. The Mexican column immediately divided, one portion sweeping by the depot under a destructive fire from the dispersed Indiana regiment ; the other gaining the opposite mountains. In this affair, Colonel Yell was killed by a lance, which entered his mouth and tore away part of his head. The situation of the Mexican army which had gained the rear was now very critical; but, while they were there, General Taylor received a flag of truce from Santa Anna, desiring to know what he wanted ; and the delay attending an answer to this, enabled the cavalry to rejoin the main army. At the conclusion of the truce, the cavalry of General Minon, which had been hovering all day near Saltillo, were so roughly handled by Shover's and Washington's artillery, that they did not reappear. The enemy now seemed to confine his efforts to the protection of his artillery, and soon the Illinois and second Kentucky regiments were over whelmed by the immense masses that were poured upon them. The artil lery were also driven back. It was a critical moment. Captain O'Brien, with two pieces, had sustained the charge until every man and horse was killed or wounded, and had left his guns on the field. The commander ordered Captain Bragg into battery, and without any infantry support, and at the imminent risk of losing his guns, he came rapidly into action when the Mexicans were within but a few yards of his pieces. In three dis charges, the enemy were in confused flight. The second Kentucky regi ment rushed forward so far in pursuit, that the cavalry suddenly wheeled round, attacked, and drove them back. In this disastrous charge, Colonels Hardin and McKee,and Lieutenant-colonel Clay, were killed. But for the timely assistance of Washington's battery, which opened upon the enemy from a ravine, the regiment would have been cut to pieces. HIS was the last effort of the enemy. The exhausted soldiers sunk upon the battle- field, among dead and dying, with their arms about them, and without fires. The officers removed the wounded to Saltillo, and made every preparation for an attack on the following night. General Wool's report of this battle is full of interest. He was the field-officer of the day, and no man did more than he to secure victory. His voice was everywhere heard amid the successive charges of the enemy, and his bold conduct infused energy into the soldiers. He is mentioned by General Taylor with distinguished honour."], [116, "BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA. 110 The artillery being the most valuable arm, and that by which the for tune of the day was decided, the accounts of their labours, as given in the despatches of the two principal artillerists, are full of the most thrilling interest. No man could have fought braver, or with more efficiency, than did Captain O'Brien ; and although he was obliged to leave his guns, he had the satisfaction of knowing that he had maintained his position long enough to secure victory. Although the advantages of victory in this affair were altogether with General Taylor, yet his antagonist also claimed a triumph, alleging his subsequent retreat to be the unavoidable result of the starving condition of his troops. It is very probable that this cause hastened the retreat of the Mexicans, and perhaps a second, and more obstinate engagement, as an additional force was then on the road to join Santa Anna. The causes of his failing to drive the Americans from their position, together with an elaborate vindication of his own conduct, are given in a lengthy report which he made to the government immediately after the battle of Buena Vista. The difficulties which he encountered were undoubtedly great, and in view of them we are obliged to admire the talents of the man who under such circumstances could keep an army together. The description of the last charge of the Mexicans, and of the close of the battle, is given in the following terms by a gentleman who was actively engaged during the whole of the 23d : \" While the dispersed Mexican cavalry were rallying, the third Indiana regiment, under Colonel Lane, was ordered to join Colonel Davis, sup ported by a considerable body of horse. About this time, from some unknown reason, our wagon train displayed its length along the Saltillo road, and offered a conspicuous prize for the Mexican lancers, which they seemed not unwilling to appropriate. Fortunately, Lieutenant Rucker, with a squadron of the first dragoons, (Captain Steen having been pre viously wounded, and Captain Eustis confined to his bed by illness,) was present, and, by order of General Taylor, dashed among them in a most brilliant style, dispersing them by his charge, as effectually as the previous fire of the Mississippi riflemen. May's dragoons, with a squadron of Arkansas cavalry, under Captain Pike, and supported by a single piece of artillery, under Lieutenant Reynolds, now claimed their share in the discussion, and when the Mexicans had again assembled, they had to encounter another shock from the two squadrons, besides a fierce fire of grape from Reynolds's six-pounder. \" The lancers once more rallied, and directing their course towards the Saltillo road, were met by the remainder of Colonel Yell's regiment and Marshall's Kentuckians, who drove them towards the mountains on the opposite side of the valley, where, from their appearance when last visible, it may be presumed they are still running. In this precipitate movement"], [117, "BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA. 111 they were compelled to pass through a rancho, in which many of our valiant comrades had previously taken refuge, who, from this secure retreat, opened quite an effective fire upon them. ' At this time the Mexican force was much divided, and the fortunes of the day were with us. Santa Anna saw the crisis, and, by craft and cun ning, sought to avert it. He sent a white flag to General Taylor, desiring to know ' what he wanted.' This was at once believed to be a mere ruse to gain time and re-collect his men : but the American general thought fit to notice it, and General Wool was deputed to meet the representative of Santa Anna, and to say to him that we ' wanted' peace. Before the interview could be had, the Mexicans themselves re-opened their fires, thus adding treachery of the highest order to the other barbarian practices which distinguish their mode of warfare. The flag, however, had accom plished the ends which its wily originator designed ; for though our troops could have effectually prevented the remainder of his cavalry from joining the main body, it could only have been done by a fire, which, while the parley lasted, would have been an undoubted breach of faith. Although a portion of the lancers, during this interim, had regained their original posi tion, a formidable number still remained behind. Upon these the infantry opened a brisk fire, while Reynolds's artillery, beautifully served, hailed the grape and canister upon them with terrible effect. \" The craft of Santa Anna had restored his courage, and with his rein forcement of cavalry he determined to charge our line. Under cover of their artillery, horse and foot advanced upon our batteries. These, from the smallness of our infantry force, were but feebly supported, yet, by the most brilliant and daring efforts, nobly maintained their positions. Such was the rapidity of their transitions, that officers and pieces seemed empowered with ubiquity ; and upon cavalry and infantry alike, wherever they appeared, they poured so destructive a fire as to silence the enemy's artillery, compel his whole line to fall back, and soon to assume a sort of sauve qui peut movement, indicating any thing but victory. Again our spirits rose. The Mexicans appeared thoroughly routed ; and while their regiments and divisions were flying before us, nearly all our light troops were ordered forward, and followed them with a most deadly fire, mingled with shouts which rose above the roar of artillery. \"When our men were driven through the ravines, at the extremities of which a body of Mexican lancers were stationed to pounce upon them like tigers, Brent and Whiting, of Washington's battery, gave them such a torrent of grape as put them to flight, and thus saved the remnants of those brave regiments which had long borne the hottest portion of the fight. On the other3 flank, while the Mexicans came rushing on like legions of fiends, the artillery was left unsupported, and capture by the enemy seemed"], [118, "BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA. 112 inevitable. But Bragg and Thomas rose with the crisis, and eclipsed even the fame they won at Monterey ; while Sherman, O'Brien, and Bryan, proved themselves worthy of the alliance. Every horse with O'Brien's battery was killed, and the enemy had advanced to within range of grape, sweeping all before him. But here his progress was arrested, and before the showers of iron hail which assailed him, squadrons and battalions fell like leaves in the blasts of autumn. The Mexicans were once more driven back with great loss, though taking with them the three pieces of artillery which were without horses. \" In this charge the first Illinois regiment and McKee's Kentuckians were foremost. The pursuit was too hot ; and as it evinced too clearly our deficiency in numbers, the Mexicans, with a suddenness which was almost magical, rallied and returned upon us. They came in myriads, and for a while the carnage was dreadful on both sides. We were but a handful to oppose the frightful masses which were hurled upon us, and could as easily have resisted an avalanche of thunderbolts. We were driven back, and the day seemed lost beyond redemption. Victory, which a moment before appeared within our grasp, was suddenly torn from our standard. There was but one hope ; but that proved an anchor sure and steadfast. \"Thus thrice during the day, when all seemed lost but honour, did the artillery, by the ability with which it was man\u0153uvred, roll back the tide of success from the enemy, and give such overwhelming destructiveness to its effect, that the army was saved and the glory of the American arms was maintained. At this moment, however, let it never be forgotten, that while every effective man was wanted on the field, hundreds of volunteers had collected in the rancho with the wagon train, whom no efforts or entreaties could induce to join their brethren, neighbours, and friends, then in the last struggle for victory. \" The battle had now raged with variable success for nearly ten hours, and, by a sort of mutual consent, after the last carnage wrought amon<- the Mexicans by the artillery, both parties seemed willing to pause upon the result. Night fell, and the American general, with his troops, slept upon the battle-ground, prepared, if necessary, to resume operations on the mor row. But ere the sun rose again upon the scene, the Mexicans had dis appeared, leaving behind them only the hundreds of their dead and dying, whose bones are to whiten their native hills, and whose moans of anguish were to excite in their enemies that compassion which can have no exist ence in the bosoms of their friends.\" Major Coffee, of General Taylor's staff, gave the following interesting incidents of Buena Vista, during a private conversation while in the United States as bearer of the general's despatches : \"General Taylor had fallen in love, at first sight, with the position at which he finally made his stand \u2014 at Buena Vista. His movement towards"], [119, "BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA. 113 Agua Nueva was merely a ruse to decoy the enemy into the field which he had selected for his battle-ground. As soon as McCulloch's men, who were invaluable as scouts, informed him of Santa Anna's approach to Agua Nueva, General Taylor quietly broke up his camp, and fell back to his first love, Buena Vista. This position was admirably chosen. It was at the foot of a mountain, or rather of two mountains, between which ran the road through a narrow valley. On his right there was a deep ravine, which protected that flank more effectually than half a dozen regi ments could have done. The left of General Taylor's line rested on the base of a mountain. The road in the centre was intrenched and defended by a strong battery. In front the ground was uneven \u2014 broken into hills and deep ravines \u2014 well adapted to the mode of fighting suited to our volunteers, and by its peculiarities supplying the disadvantage of a great inferiority of numbers. \" On the 21st, the enemy were descried approaching over the distant hills. At their appearance the volunteers raised a great shout, and gave three tremendous cheers. Their engineers and officers were seen flying over the field, and dragging their cannon about to get them into position, but the nature of the ground did not favour the undertaking, and it was late in the day before the big guns began to open. \"The enemy had with them thirty-two cannon, mostly of large calibre. Their fire, though kept up very briskly, and apparently well manned, did so little execution in our ranks, that it was not considered necessary to answer it. Our cannon were therefore silent the whole of the 21st. Eight or ten killed and wounded was the extent of the casualties sustained by our army on the 21st. During the next day an officer approached our lines with a flag of truce, and requested to be shown to General Taylor. The brave old man was sitting quietly on his white charger, with his leg over the pommel of the saddle, watching the movements of the enemy, when the Mexican officer was presented. In a very courteous and graceful manner the officer stated that ' he had been sent by his excellency Gene ral Santa Anna, to his excellency General Taylor, to inquire, in the most respectful manner, what he (General Taylor) was waiting for V From the silence of General Taylor's batteries, and the quiet manner in which he received Santa Anna's terrific cannonading, the Mexican supposed he was asking a very proper question ; to which, however, old Rough and Ready gave the very pertinent reply that ' he was only waiting for Gene ral Santa Anna to surrender.' The Mexican returned hastily to his lines. This message proved to be a ruse to ascertain where General Taylor's position was ; for after the return of the Mexican officer to his own ranks, the whole Mexican battery seemed to open upon General Taylor's position, and the balls flew over and about him like hail. Utterly indifferent to the perils of his situation, there sat the old chief on his conspicuous white is l\u00b1"], [120, "BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA. 114 horse, peering through his spy-glass at the long lines of Mexican troops that could be seen at a great distance on the march. The persuasion of his aids could not induce him to abandon his favourite point of observation, nor to give up his old white horse. \" AU the officers on our side, in this hard-fought battle, distinguished themselves. The details of the battle were confided to General Wool, who nobly justified the confidence of his commander and brother veteran, by the most active, zealous, efficient, and gallant conduct. Throughout the whole action he was constantly engaged in the disposition of our forces, and in rallying them to the onset. It was a miracle he escaped the thick-flying balls which thinned the ranks he was marshaling. There was but one complaint made against him, and that was that he exposed himself too much. Brigadier-general Lane also showed himself to be a brave and capable officer. Although wounded early in the action, he kept his horse until it closed, and never for a moment left his post. \" On the night of the 22d, both armies drew off from the field of battle. Our men were engaged all night in bringing in the wounded and taking care of them, the Mexicans as well as their own men. There were, how ever, but few of our men found on the field wounded. They were, to use Santa Anna's significant words in his despatch, \"all dead,\" the cowardly miscreants having killed every man whom they overtook, wounded and helpless, on the field. With like turpitude and treachery, they left their dead unburied and their wounded uncared for on the field where they fell. The latter were carried to Saltillo in our own wagons ; the former were buried by the alcalde, under the orders of General Taylor. \" A number of officers were taken prisoners, and an exchange was effected, by which all our men in their hands were released. Cassius M. Clay's party are understood now to be in the city of Mexico. \"Among the killed and wounded of the Mexicans are three general officers, and twenty colonels and commanders of battalions. General Minon, it appears, has not as yet realized the brilliant career of which he considered his capture of Major Borland an earnest. He was ordered by Santa Anna to attack and carry Saltillo during the engagement at Buena Vista. With this object he made a demonstration against the town with two thousand cavalry. Lieutenant Shover, with sixty men and two small pieces of artillery, went out to meet the valiant general, and at one dis charge of his cannon sent him and his large force to the right-about in double quick time.\" Private letters from Mexican officers and soldiers give frightful details of the sufferings experienced by their troops, both before and after the battle. \"Our troops,\" says one, \"are perishing with hunger and thirst. They have not drank water in two days, and have eaten nothino- since the day they were at Encarnacion, and a slice of roasted meat at La Vaca."], [121, "BATTLE OF B U E N A VISTA. 115 I am much afraid lest this cause should disperse us to-night, since the sol diers are already scattering, and bodies of them fighting and charging upon the enemy wherever they thought there was water, caring for nothing ; and we have seen them disputing among themselves, totally regardless of the fire of the enemy, for a piece of ham found upon the dead Yankees. This night is a fearful one for the republic, since I dread lest we should become disbanded. In conclusion, dear friend, there now remains but little to be done, because we have been pursuing the enemy all day long with the bayonet, and to-morrow they will be finished.

They have come to demand a peace, and they have been answered by the general-in-chief, that until the whole republic is evacuated by them, he will not listen to them.\" The following are the orders of the Mexican general issued on the 20th and 21st of February, and defining the order of battle, together with other matters relative to it. \"General officers of the day, Don Rafael Vasquez ; aids, Colonel Jose M.

Immediately after the battalion . of Sappers, and in its rear, and at the head of the division [ of infantry of the van, under the orders of General Pacheco, will be placed the company of sharp shooters, and three sixteen-pounders, with their respective artillerists and reserve \u2014 as, like wise the ammunition, composed of one hundred round shot and one hun dred and nine grape for each piece, and eighty boxes musket ammunition, each containing nine thousand six hundred cartridges. Division of infantry of the centre, commanded by General Manuel M. Lombardini, will follow. At the head of this column there will be five twelve-pounders as above named and ammunitioned, and also eighty boxes of musket ammunition.

After the ammunition train all the camp followers of all classes, with the baggage of all kinds, laundresses, cooks, it being distinctly understood that no woman will be allowed to mix with the column. The chief in command of the commissary department is Don Pedro Ravejel, who is also in charge of the baggage train. \" His excellency, the general-in-chief, furthermore orders, that the differ- ent corps shall to-day receive from the commissary three days' rations, for the 21st, 22d and 23d, and that they require the necessary meat this after noon, for the first meal to-morrow morning, which the troops are directed to eat one hour before taking up the fine of march ; and the second will be taken in their haversacks, to be eaten in the night whenever they may halt. This last will consist of meat, two biscuits, and half a cake of brown sugar for each man ; for on the night of the 21st, there will be no fires permitted, neither will there be signal made by any military instruments of music \u2014 the movement at early daybreak on the morning of the 22d, having to be made in the most profound silence. \"The troops will drink all the water they can before marching, and will take with them in their canteens, or other vessels, all they can possibly carry. They will economize the water all they can, for we shall encamp at night without water, and shall not arrive at it until 12 o'clock on the following day. The chiefs of corps will pay much \u2014 much attention to this last instruction. \"Each mule belonging to the ammunition train, and the horses of officers, will receive two rations of corn, which they will take with them, and these will be fed to them to-morrow night at dusk and on the following morning at daybreak. The horses' girths will only be slackened, and the mules will not be unharnessed while they are eating. The light brigade will likewise obey this order of the 21st, only loosening their saddles a little. The horses and mules will all be taken to water before commencino- the march. Each division will take with it its respective medical staff, hos pital attendants, medicines, &c, as regulated by themedical inspector-general. \" The chaplain-in-chief will provide each division with its chaplain.

Sixty-five commissioned offi cers killed and wounded in so small an army, exhibits a proportion and result unparalleled in the history of war. Estimating General Taylor's force at five thousand rank and file, and allowing one commissioned officer to twenty men, the startling conclusion is arrived at that our loss in this sanguinary engagement, of commissioned officers, amounted to one-fourth of the number in the field. If the loss of the rank and file were in like proportion to that of officers, it would exceed one thousand two hundred. In view of such terrible results as these, Santa Anna approached as near the truth, melancholy as it is, as he ever did, when he said that both armies were cut up. The loss of the Mexicans can scarcely be exaggerated, when it is put down at four thousand. Santa Anna must have had with him at least seventeen thousand men. When we last heard from him, previous to the battle, he was at San Fernando, waiting for all the various detachments of his army to assemble, preparatory to his attack. This was on the 17th, and the attack was fixed for the 21st. Now, as Santa Anna knew exactly Taylor's situation and force, he would certainly not attack him until he had collected all his available troops, and these we know, allowing for de sertion and for a corps de reserve, could not have fallen short of seventeen thousand, as he left San Luis with twenty-three thousand. If, then, with such a force as this, after a two days' hard fight, and after inflicting upon General Taylor so heavy a loss, he is compelled to withdraw twenty miles to the rear, the conclusion is inevitable that he has sustained a prodigious loss, and is irretrievably beaten. The army of General Taylor may be considered as reduced at least one-third by casualties and by details to take"], [124, "BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA. 118 care of the wounded. This would leave but about three thousand men to hold his position, and we know he did hold it for several days after the action, undisturbed by the enemy.\" General Taylor issued the following congratulatory orders on the 26th, three days after the battle : \" I. The commanding general has the grateful task of congratulating the troops upon the brilliant success which attended their arms in the conflict of the 22d and 23d. Confident of the immense superiority of numbers, and stimulated by the presence of a distinguished leader, the Mexican troops were yet repulsed in every effort to force our lines, and finally with drew with immense loss from the field. \" 2. The general would express his obligations to the officers and men engaged, for the cordial support which they rendered throughout the action. It will be his highest pride to bring to the notice of the government the conspicuous gallantry of particular officers and corps, whose unwavering steadiness more than once saved the fortune of the day. He would also express his high satisfaction with the conduct of the small command left to hold Saltillo. Though not so seriously engaged as their comrades, their services were very important and efficiently rendered. While bestowing this just tribute to the conduct of the troops, the general deeply regrets to say, that there were not a few exceptions. He trusts that those who fled ingloriously to Buena Vista, and even to Saltillo, will seek an opportunity to retrieve their reputation, and to emulate the bravery of their comrades, who bore the brunt of the battle, and sustained, against fearful odds, the honour of the flag. \"The exultation of success is checked by the heavy sacrifice of life which it has cost, embracing many officers of high rank and rare merit. While the sympathies of a grateful country will be given to the bereaved families and friends of those who nobly fell, their illustrious example will remain for the benefit and admiration of the army. \"By order of Major-general Taylor. W. W. S. Bliss, Adjutant-general.\" The following are similar documents of Santa Anna to his Mexicans : General Order of the army \u2014 23d February, 7 o'clock at night on the ground occupied by the enemy, camp of La Angostura. His excellency, the general-in-chief of the army, directs me to announce to the generals, field and company officers, and the soldiers which compose it, that he has witnessed with satisfaction the gallant bearino- of each one of them during the days of combat which we have had with the invading forces of North America. Such bearing is worthy of the soldiers of a people who desire to be free ; and the ground which we now occupy, on which the enemy was just now posted, the pieces of artillery, and the"], [125, "BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA. 119 colours we have taken, and the thousand corpses of the enemy which are scattered around us, will always be evidence of the valour of the soldiers of Mexico. His excellency also directs me to say, that in testimony of the brave deeds of his subordinates, he will present them to the nation and to the supreme government, with his commendation ; and, taking into consideration the fatigues of these days and the scarcity of provisions which the troops are suffering, that he will direct them to be so disposed that they may recover themselves so as to conclude with glory the enter prise so brilliantly commenced. He directs that this order shall be com municated to the army in a general order extraordinary. By command of his excellency, M. Micheltorena. General Order (about midnight) of 23d, (while marching.) His excellency the general-in-chief has directed that the army shall repose this day, it being understood that the design of retiring to this point is purely stratagetical, to see if the enemy will abandon his position, so that the cavalry can have an opportunity to operate. His excellency also directs that I should express to the generals, field and other officers, and to the soldiers, the satisfaction which he has derived from their brilliant de portment on the illustrious day of the 22d, and in the battle of the 23d. Victory has been ours. The loss of the enemy in men has been immense ; and then we have in our possession his colours and his artillery, which the infantry as well as cavalry, each for itself, succeeded'in taking from the enemy. The unevenness of the ground alone saved from our swords the miserable remnant of the enemy which have already fled for Saltillo. For all which, the commander-in-chief offers every class his due thanks, trust ing that hereafter they will continue to give similar proofs of their discipline and patriotism \u2014 services which the nation will ever acknowledge. * * * * By order of his excellency, M. Micheltorena. Upon hearing of the battle, the governor of San Luis Potosi issued a pompous declaration, claiming a complete victory to the Mexican arms. Many of the inhabitants thought different. We have thus collected into one view all the documents which might assist the reader in forming a clear as well as comprehensive opin ion of this great action, abstaining in the meanwhile, as much as pos sible, from any remarks of our own. It is difficult to judge fairly and impartially of any great national event, recently enacted. Party or na tional prejudices, the fear of opposition, deference to the opinions of others, and often ignorance of important circumstances, all combine to warp the verdict of the historian. To these may be added the una voidable accumulation of different and often contradictory evidences and authorities, which frequently renders even a correct narration of the event itself an impossibility. Hence the conflicting statements of many of"], [126, "BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA. 120 Napoleon's battles, of General Greene at Eutaw Springs, and of the British in India. On the other hand, when time has divested the great event of all its appendages, and the sight can grasp it, without being distracted by a multiplication of attendants, then only the impartial narrator may pro nounce with firmness, and without fear of contradiction, of its nature and merits. T the battle which we have just described, each army laboured under its peculiar disadvantages. The Mexicans were worn out by a fatiguing march, and debilitated by sickness and hunger. I Several of their generals were also unpopular, especially those who had been concerned at Mon- terey; and more than all, they were the assailants of an army flushed with the remembrance of for- mer victories, and occupying picked ground, which is universally acknowledged to be one of the strongest positions which a military force had ever defended. The Americans, however, were far inferior in numbers, in artillery, and especially in cavalry ; and, with the exception of a few companies, were composed entirely of new volunteer troops, who had been drawn from the quiet pursuits of every-day life, and were almost unknown to their officers and to each other. On the other hand, both were commanded by popular generals, possessing the entire confidence of their commands, both were certain of victory, and both con fident that the eyes of their governments were upon them. The balance of advantage however must be conceded to the Mexicans ; for we cannot resist the impression, that had the assailants been of the same nation or same military character with their opponents, General Taylor must have been cut to pieces. To other causes, then, than those just mentioned, we must ascribe the result of the conflict, and these are to be found in the sys tematic co-operation of each corps and commander, with the general-in chief and with each other, thus forming a federal whole; in the coolness evinced by almost every company, even while exposed to the most tre mendous fires of artillery and musketry ; in the fearlessness of the officers, who were always in advance of their men ; to the admirable management of the artillery; and finally, in no inconsiderable degree to the spirit of emulation between the regiments of different states, and of which the Mexi cans were wholly destitute. These are the qualifications of an army, without which superior numbers are of but little avail. In that last terrible charge, when the thousands of cavalry were rushing down upon one de voted corps, had the unanimity of the Americans for one moment forsaken them, they would that moment have been annihilated. O'Brien had lost in killed and wounded every man and horse, and had seen the hoofs of the horses strike the muzzles of his guns. But almost at the same"], [127, "BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA. 121 instant, Captain Bragg received his orders, galloped into action, and opened upon the exulting pursuers so suddenly that confusion ensued almost before they had time to perceive its source. A similar instance we have in the conduct of the Mississippi regiment after the retreat of the Indiana troops. Then, also, the day would have been lost, but for the oneness of action which pervaded both the officers and men of those gallant troops. An example of the want of it is given by Santa Anna, in the case of the failure of General Minon to co-operate with him in the last charge \u2014 and it is to be noted that to this cause alone the dictator ascribes his defeat. UT the principal cause of victory \u2014 that which combined and modified all others \u2014 was the character and conduct of the American general. Few men, besides himself, could have conquered at Buena Vista ; none other could have inspired the troops with such devotion and enthusiasm. Talents for the choice of position, for the arrangement of the line of battle, and for the conduct of the engagement; coolness and intrepidity while exposing his person whenever it became necessary ; together with the determination to conquer, which inspired, through him, all his men, marked his conduct on that day, and secured him, to future history, as the Hero of Angostura. After the retreat of Santa Anna, no event of importance transpired, until the 2d of March, when a force of two hundred Americans, com manded by Major Giddings, and accompanied by a train of a hundred and fifty wagons, was attacked by General Urrea, at the head of fifteen hun dred Mexicans. The first onset of the enemy was repelled; but the cavalry then attacked the wagon train, and succeeded in driving the team sters from their horses, and separating the whole into two bodies. A summons to surrender was now sent to the smaller division, which was refused, and, soon after, the Americans cut their way through the enemy, re-united, and forced them to retire. They lost fifteen teamsters and two soldiers, while the Mexicans left more than forty on the field. Major Gid dino-s entered Seralvo the next morning, and in a few days was joined by a considerable force under Colonel Curtis, who was in pursuit of Urrea. On the 16th, the colonel came up with General Taylor, near Marin. The general was also in pursuit of the Mexicans, having with him May's dra goons and two companies of Bragg's artillery. Notwithstanding, how ever, the active exertions of the general, Urrea succeeded in eluding him, and retreated beyond the mountains ; and, soon after, the Americans retired toward Monterey, and took up a position at Walnut Springs. The following is the address of General Taylor to the inhabitants of Northern Mexico : t L 10"], [128, "BATTLE OF BUENA VISTA. 122 The General-in-chief of the American forces, to the inhabitants of Tamau- lipas, Nuevo Leon, and Coahuila. When the American troops first crossed the frontier, and entered the above states, it was with the intention, and publicly declared to you, of making war, not upon peaceful citizens of the soil, but upon the central government of the republic, with a view to obtain an early and an honour able peace. The undersigned was authorized by his government to levy contributions upon the people, for the support of his army ; but, unwilling to throw the heavy burden of the war upon those who, with few excep tions, manifested a neutral disposition, he has continued, from the first, to pay punctually and liberally for all supplies drawn from the country for the support of his troops. He has used every effort to cause the war to bear lightly upon the peo ple of these states, and he had hoped by this means to retain their confi dence and insure their neutrality in the strife between his government and that of Mexico; but he regrets to say that his kindness has not been appreciated, but has been met by acts of hostility and plunder. The citi zens of the country, instead of pursuing their avocations quietly at home, have, in armed bands, waylaid the roads, and, under the direction, and with the support of the government troops, have destroyed trains and murdered drivers, under circumstances of atrocity which disgrace hu manity. The lives of those who were thus wantonly put to death cannot be restored, but the undersigned requires from the people of the country an indemnification for the loss sustained by the destruction of the trains and the pillage of their contents. To that end, an estimate will be made, by the proper officers, of the entire loss ; and this loss must be made good either in money or in the products of the country, by the community at large, of the states of Tamaulipas and New Leon and Coahuila, each dis trict, or juzgado, paying its just proportion. It is expected that the rich will bear their full share. And the undersigned calls upon all good citizens to remain absolutely neutral, and to give no countenance to the bands which infest the country for the purpose of mur der and pillage. It is his anxious desire to continue the same policy as heretofore, and he trusts that the course of the citizens will enable him to do so! Z. Taylor, Maj. Gen. U. S. A. Head-quarters at Monterey, March 31, 1847."], [129, "123 GENERAL SCOTT. CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ, S we have formerly stated, General Winfield Scott had been sent by government to the seat of war, previous to the battle of Buena Vista ; as he was the senior officer in rank, he of course became commander-in-chief of the whole southern army. He cannot, however, be said to have superseded Taylor, as the sphere of operations of the two generals was entirely different. The order defin- ing the duties of the new commander is as follows War Department, Washington, November 23, 1846. Sir, The President, several days since, communicated in person to you his orders to repair to Mexico, to take the command of the forces there assem-"], [130, "CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ. 124 bled, and particularly to organize and set on soot an expedition to operate on the Gulf coast, if, on arriving at the theatre of action, you shall deem it to be practicable. It is not proposed to control your operations by definite and positive instructions, but you are left to prosecute them as your judg ment, under a full view of all the circumstances, shall dictate. The work is before you, and the means provided, or to be provided, for accomplishing it, are committed to you, in the full confidence that you will use them to the best advantage. The objects which it is desirable to obtain have been indicated, and it is hoped that you will have the requisite force to accomplish them. Of this you must be the judge, when preparations are made, and the time for action arrived. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, W. L. Marcy, Secretary of War. Gen. Winfield Scott. N pursuance of this order, General Scott sailed \u25a0 from New York on the 30th of November, and reached the Rio Grande on the 1st of January. The great object of the new army was an attack upon the Mexican city and fort of Vera Cruz and San Juan d'Ulloa. The land forces of the general were to be assisted by the naval squadron under Commodore Conner. The latter embarked at the depot, and on the 7th of March landed at Anton Lizardo. Still the forces of the general were not sufficient to justify an attack, and he was obliged to detach a large number from the troops under General Taylor. These reached him in February, and aug mented his army to about twelve thousand men. The following excellent description of the city and castle of Vera Cruz, we extract from the New York Herald ; it will be seen that the Mexicans were justifiable in regarding it as impregnable : \"Vera Cruz is situated in 19\u00b0 11' 52\" north latitude, and Fahrenheit's thermometer has an average range there of 77 degrees. One portion of its walls is washed by the Atlantic, and the shore on the opposite side is a dry and sandy plain. Measuring from the wharf of the city to the fortress of San Juan de Ulloa, the latter is 1072 varas distant, and its circumference is 3174. \" The city is situated on the exact spot where Cortes landed on the 21st of April, 1519, to which he then gave the name of Chaichiuheuecan. The city, however, was not founded at that time. The first Spanish colony which occupied the Mexican territory was the Villa Rica de Vera Cruz, according to the account given by the illustrious Clavijero. This was situated three leagues from Tempoala, but was abandoned three years sub-"], [131, "CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ. 125 sequent to its occupation ; and the town afterwards known as La Antigua was raised in place of it. This latter is situated more to the south. At the end of the sixteenth century, during the period when the Marquis of Monterey was governor of Mexico, the present city of Vera Cruz was founded. It was termed New Vera Cruz, in order to distinguish it from the other one previously alluded to, and in the year 1615, it was incorpo rated as a city. Seventy-eight years after, that is to say in the year 1683, the buccaneers took it by surprise and sacked it, the tradition of which event is still spoken of in Vera Cruz, as the ' Invasion of Lorencillo,' that being the popular name which was given to the Hollander, Lawrence de Graff, the chief of the pirates who committed this outrage. \" The reason of the several changes made in the site of the city erected by the first settlers, however, may be somewhat attributed to the ravages made among the two first colonies by the yellow fever, or vomito prieto . Unfortunately, though, the new settlement of New Vera Cruz did not at all assist the new settlers in this particular, for in addition to the insalubrious nature of its warm and moist climate, there were other causes that were equally unfavourable, such as the ponds and marshes in the immediate vicinity of the city \u2014 the exhalations from which poisoned the atmosphere \u2014 and the reflected heat from the sandy plains that were still nearer, raised the temperature to a most extraordinary height. Added to these difficul ties was the bad quality of the water, and the immense abundance of that tormenting kind of musquito called the tancudo, whose bite gave rise to great irritation of the system. \"All these causes operating together, gave rise to various affections amono* those who were acclimated. The most common effects were more or less serious tertian fevers, whilst the stranger felt them in an attack of the terrible vomito, the very name of which is sufficient to terrify the in habitants of the more salubrious interior. Observation and experience, however, have now served to show all that can be done towards curing this awful disease, and, consequently, its ravages have not been so great for some years past. The two following facts have likewise been ascertained recardino- it \u2014 first, that foreigners who have once become acclimated in Vera Cruz, then enjoy better health than do the natives of that place ; and, second, that though the climate is so unhealthy and fatal during those periods of the year when great heat and heavy rains prevail, yet, that as soon as the north winds (which commence in October, and end in April) blow sufficiently strong to remove the miasmatic exhalations and musqui toes, and cool the atmosphere, then it becomes much more healthy than the climate of many places in the interior. \"The city is small, but from the regularity which marks its laying out, it is beautiful. The streets are wide, straight, and well paved. The houses, of which there are one thousand and sixty-three, are mostly two stones L 2"], [132, "CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ. 126 high, and built of the Muscara stone, taken from the sea-beach. There are some three stories high, and of fine architectural design, with their in ternal arrangements corresponding to the beauty of their external appear ance. The finest public buildings are those near the wharf, which have not long been built, and contain the principal public offices. We may also notice the market-place that has been recently laid out ; the parish or princi pal church ; the military and female hospitals ; the maritime custom-house, and the convent of St. Augustine, formerly occupied by the Jesuits. This latter is remarkable for the solidity of its walls. The other convents of San Francisco, Santo Domingo, La Merced, and Belen, are more remarka ble for their extent than for their architectural merits. The streets are well lighted by means of two hundred and thirty-two lamps, which suffice to illuminate them perfectly on dark nights. The excellent organization of the night-watch perfectly fulfils its object. In addition to the hospitals we have mentioned, there are others for the reception of male patients. The cemetery, which is situated outside the walls, is one of the handsomest in the republic. \" The country in the vicinity of Vera Cruz produces almost every thing, in the way of eatables, required by the inhabitants of that city. The woods abound in game, the fields in grain, vegetables and tropical fruits, and the savannas or plains with cattle. The sea, rivers, and large lakes abound with a great variety of fish, and the elevated and temperate regions with the various fruits and vegetables natural to those climates, while numerous vessels from Europe and America bring into the port all the various wines, liquors, and delicacies which the most refined epicure can desire. \" As Vera Cruz is one of the strongholds of the republic, in this descrip tion of it, it will not be amiss to give some idea of its fortifications. These consist of nine towers connected together by means of a stone and mortar wall, which, however, is not very thick. The two towers named Santiago and Conception are the most important, as well from their size and strength, as from the fact that by their position they contribute much to the defence of the port. They are situated at that portion of the walls looking toward the castle of San Juan, and are distant from each other one thousand two hundred and seventy varas. The other towers, including the one called San Fernando, are almost equal in shape, size, and strength. All of them can mount one hundred pieces of artillery of various sizes ; and save those of the middle ones, their fires all cross in front of the guard-houses, the external walls of which form part of the walls which surround the city. \"Although the port of Vera Cruz is the principal one in the Gulf of Mexico, it is very dangerous during the seasons of the northers \u2014 that which is called the bay being, in reality, nothing more than a bad road-"], [133, "CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ. 127 stead. The repub'ic of Mexico is as badly situated in this respect on the eastern coast, as it is highly favourable on the western ; and Baron Humboldt but too faithfully described the harbour of Vera Cruz when he said, that the only shelter it affords shipping is a dangerous anchorage among shoals. The ruinous condition into which the city wharf has been allowed latterly to fall, has not, by any means, contributed to lessen the serious inconvenience and risk which the maritime commerce of the place experiences from this state of things. This latter difficulty, however, we trust, will not be of long duration, as the necessary repairs have lately been commenced on the wharf, and, unless the funds fail, we hope to see this work completed during the coming year. \"The situation which Vera Cruz has occupied in the scale of Mexican civilization since the era of the emancipation from the Spanish yoke, is, undoubtedly, very high. The rising generation is gifted with excellent talents and imaginations, as ardent and lively as their climate ; and it is much to be regretted that they have not had the advantages of good col leges in their city to foster and bring out their capacities. The Vera Cruzanos are not less distinguished for force of character, than they are for capacity \u2014 as they are frank, affable and generous. Indeed, it would be difficult to instance any other part of the republic, where the inhabitants are better informed or more refined, or where there are more ideas of liberty and progression, less fanaticism, or better customs. The lower classes in the vicinity are not so addicted, generally speaking, to those lamentably dissipated and debauched habits, which are, unfortunately, too often found among the lower classes of the populace of the larger cities ; and long periods of time often elapse in Vera Cruz, without the occurrence of any of those awful crimes which are so frequent in other parts. When homicides or murders occur, it is generally among the soldiery ; and the robberies that are committed are, almost always, the work of strangers. Travellers arriving in the night during the hot season would be much surprised by finding the doors of the houses left open, and their inmates asleep. Yet such is the result of the confidence which the morality of the inhabitants inspires. \"Thoucrh in times past, Vera Cruz, from its riches and mercantile acti vity, well deserved the title of the Tyre of America ; it is, at the present day, falling rapidly into decay. Its business, which, in the year 1802, amounted to the enormous sum of eighty-two millions and forty-seven thousand dollars, has now (1844) become quite insignificant; and the population, which in 1804 exceeded twenty thousand souls, now scarcely amounts to seven thousand, even including the garrison. Vera Cruz is, beyond all doubt, the point in the republic which has been most severely tried in these latter times. In 1821, it was besieged and carried by the independent troops ; in 1822, it was again tbesieged by the Spanish troops ;"], [134, "CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ. 128 and between the 25th of September, 1823, and the 23d of November, 1825, it was thrice bombarded by the Spanish, who were occupying the castle of San Juan. In 1832, it was again besieged by what were termed the ministerial troops; and, in 1838, it was blockaded and taken by the French. The results of some of those sufferings have been very beneficial to the republic, and honourable to the city itself. It is the keystone of the republic, and well deserves the title of Heroica, which it has borne since the year 1825, when she accomplished the taking of the fortress of San Juan from its Spanish occupants. \"The castle of San Juan de Ulloa is unquestionably the most cele brated of all American fortresses. Its construction was commenced in the year 1582, upon a bar or bank, in front of the town of Vera Cruz, at the distance of one thousand and sixty-two Castilian varas or yards, and it is entirely surrounded by water. The centre of the area occupied by this fortress is a small island, upon which Juan de Grijalva landed a year previous to the arrival of Cortes upon the continent, and, at that period, it accidentally received the name which it retains to this present day. It seems that there was a shrine or temple erected upon it, in which human victims were sacrificed to the Indian gods ; and as the Spaniards were informed that these offerings were made in accordance with the commands of the kings of Acolhua, (one of the provinces of the empire,) they con founded or abbreviated this name into the word Ulloa, which they affixed to the island. \" Sixty-one years after the conquest, the work was undertaken, and although it seems to have been designed, not only to defend Vera Cruz, but to attack it in case of necessity, that city was, nevertheless, sacked by the pirates, under the renowned freebooter, Lorencillo, in the year 1683. \" The cost of the castle has been estimated by various writers, to have amounted to the sum of forty millions of dollars ; and it may not be re garded as an exaggeration, if we consider the difficulty of obtaining some of the materials of which it is composed, and the fact that a large portion of it is built in foundations laid in the sea, whose waves it has resisted for more than two centuries. \"According to a report made on the 17th of January, 1775, it was the opinion of a council of war, composed of distinguished officers, that this fortress, after all its defences were completed, would require a garrison for effective service, composed of seventeen hundred infantry soldiers, three hundred artillery, two hundred and twenty-eight sailors, and a hundred supernumeraries. \" The exterior polygon, which faces Vera Cruz, extends three hundred yards in length, whilst that which defends the north channel is, at least. two hundred yards long. Besides this, there is a low battery situated in"], [135, "CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ. 129 the bastion of Santiago, which doubles the fire on that channel. The southern channel is commanded also by the battery of San Miguel. \" The whole fortress is constructed of Madrepora Astrea, a species of soft coral, which abounds in the neighbouring islands. Its walls are from four to five yards in thickness, their exterior being faced with a harder stone. It is well supplied with water, having seven cisterns within the castle, which altogether contain ninety-three thousand seven hundred and sixty-seven cubic feet of water. Its full equipment of artillery pieces is three hundred and seventy ; but it contained only a hundred and seventy seven when attacked by the French in 1838.\" In February, a regiment of Louisiana volunteers, commanded by Colonel Russey, were wrecked near the island of Lobos. Here they were met by a summons to surrender, from a large Mexican force under General Cos ; but although the colonel's men were without arms, he presented a bold front, and delayed his answer until night, when leaving his baggage, and lighting camp-fires, he left his position, and by forced marches reached Tampico, the American head-quarters. E will describe the landing and principal events of the siege, in the language of eye- witnesses, believing that a clearer idea is thereby conveyed than from a mere detailed narrative. Immediately after landing at Lizardo, the two commanding officers made a reconnois sance in the steamer Petrita, and selected the beach due west from the island of Sacri ficios, as the most suitable point to land the troops. The landing is thus described by the commodore in his official letter to the secretary of the navy at Wash ington. \" The anchorage near this place being extremely contracted, it became necessary, in order to avoid crowding it with an undue number of vessels, to transfer most of the troops to the vessels of war for transportation to Sacrificios. Accordingly, on the morning of the 9th, at daylight, all neces sary preparations \u2014 such as launching and numbering the boats, detailing officers, &c. having been previously made, this transfer was commenced. The frigates received on board between twenty-five and twenty-eight hun dred men each, with their arms and accoutrements, and the sloops and smaller vessels numbers in proportion. This part of the movement was completed very successfully about 11 o'clock, A. M., and a few minutes thereafter the squadron under my command, accompanied by the command ing general, in the steamship Massachusetts, and such of the transports as had been selected for the purpose, got under way. 17"], [136, "130 CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ. \"The weather was very fine \u2014 indeed we could not have been more favoured in this particular than we were. We had a fresh and yet gentle breeze from the south-east, and a perfectly smooth sea. The passage to Sacrificios occupied us between two and three hours. Each ship came in and anchored without the slightest disorder or confusion, in the small space allotted to her \u2014 the harbour being still very much crowded, notwithstand ing the number of transports we had left behind. The disembarkation commenced on the instant. \" Whilst we were transferring the troops from the ships to the surf-boats, (sixty-five in number,) I directed the steamers Spitfire and Vixen, and the five gun-boats, to form a line parallel with and close in to the beach, to cover the landing. This order was promptly executed, and these small vessels, from the lightness of their draught, were enabled to take positions within good grape-range of the shore. As the boats severally received their com plements of troops, they assembled in a line, abreast, between the fleet and the gun-boats ; and when all were ready, they pulled in together, under the guidance of a number of officers of the squadron, who had been de tailed for this purpose. General Worth commanded this, the first line of the army, and had the satisfaction of forming his command on the beach and neighbouring heights just before sunset. Four thousand five hundred men were thus thrown on shore, almost simultaneously. No enemy ap peared to offer us the slightest opposition. The first line being landed, the boats in successive trips relieved the men-of-war and transports of the re maining troops by 10 o'clock, P. M. The whole army, (save a few strag gling companies,) consisting of upwards of ten thousand men, were thus safely deposited on shore, without the slightest accident of any kind. \"The officers and seamen under my command vied with each other, on this occasion, in a zealous and energetic performance of their duty. I cannot but express to the department the great satisfaction I have derived from witnessing their efforts to contribute all in their power to the success of their more fortunate brethren of the army. The weather still continu ing fine, to-day we are engaged in landing the artillery, horses, provisions, and other material. The steamer New Orleans, with the Louisiana re<ri ment of volunteers, eight hundred strong, arrived most opportunely at Anton Lizardo, just as we had put ourselves in motion. She joined us, and her troops were landed with the rest. Another transport arrived at this anchorage to-day. Her troops have also been landed. \"General Scott has now with him upwards of eleven thousand men. At his request, I permitted the marines of the squadron, under Captain Edson, to join him, as a part of the third regiment of artillery. The general-in chief landed this morning, and the army put itself in motion at an early hour, to form its lines around the city. There has been some distant firing of shot and shells from the town and castle upon the troops, as they ad-"], [137, "CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ. 131 vanced, but without result. I am still of the opinion, expressed in my previous communications, as to the inability of the enemy to hold out for any length of time. The castle has, at most, but four or five weeks' pro visions, and the town about enough to last for the same time.\" The following are the despatches of General Scott, describing the siege : \u2014 Head-quarters of the Army, Camp Washington, Before Vera Cruz, March 23, 1847. S'r' \u2014 Yesterday, seven of our ten-inch mortars being in battery, and the labours for planting the remainder of our heavy metal being in progress, I addressed, at 2 o'clock, P. M., a summons to the governor of Vera Cruz, and within two hours limited by the bearer of the flag, received the gover nor's answer. Copies of the two papers (marked respectively, A and B) are herewith enclosed. It will be perceived that the governor, who it turns out is the commander of both places, chose, against the plain terms of the summons, to suppose me to have demanded the surrender of the castle and of the city \u2014 when, in fact, from the non-arrival of our heavy metal \u2014 principally mortars \u2014 I was in no condition to threaten the former. On the return of the flag with that reply, I at once ordered the seven mortars, in battery, to open upon the city. In a short time the smaller vessels of Commodore Perry's squadron \u2014 two steamers and five schooners \u2014 according to previous arrangement with him, approached the city within about a mile and an eighth, whence, being partially covered from the castle \u2014 an essential condition to their safety \u2014 they also opened a brisk fire upon the city. This has been continued, uninterruptedly, by the mortars, only with a few intermissions, by the vessels, up to 9 o'clock this morning, when the commodore, very properly, called them off a position too daringly assumed. Our three remaining mortars are now (12 o'clock, M.) in battery, and the whole ten in activity. To-morrow, early, if the city should continue obstinate, batteries Nos. 4 and 5 will be ready to add their fire : No. 4, consisting of four twenty-four pounders and two eight-inch Paixhan guns, and No. 5, (naval battery,) of three thirty-two pounders and three eight inch Paixhans \u2014 the guns, officers, and sailors landed from the squadron \u2014 our friends of the navy being unremitting in their zealous co-operation, in every mode and form. So far, we know that our fire upon the city has been highly effective \u2014 particularly from the batteries of ten-inch mortars, planted at about eight hundred yards from the city. Including the preparation and defence of the batteries, from the beginning \u2014 now many days \u2014 and notwithstanding the heavy sire of the enemy from city and castle, we have only had four or five men wounded, and one officer and one man killed, in or near the"], [138, "CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ. 132 trenches. That officer was Captain John R. Vinton, of the United States third artillery, one of the most talented, accomplished, and effective mem bers of the army, and was highly distinguished in the brilliant operations at Monterey. He fell, last evening, in the trenches, where he was on duty as field and commanding officer, universally regretted. I have just attended his honoured remains to a soldier's grave, in full view of the enemy and within reach of his guns. Thirteen of the long-needed mortars \u2014 leaving twenty-seven, besides heavy guns, behind \u2014 have arrived, and two of them landed. A heavy norther then set in (at meridian) which stopped that operation, and also the landing of shells. Hence the fire of our mortar batteries has been slack ened, since 2 o'clock to-day, and cannot be reinvigorated until we shall again have a smooth sea. In the mean time I shall leave this report open for journalizing events that may occur up to the departure of the steamship of-war Princeton, with Commodore Conner, who, I learn, expects to leave the anchorage off Sacrificios, for the United States, the 25th instant. March 24. \u2014 The storm having subsided in the night, we commenced this forenoon, as soon as the sea became a little smooth, to land shot, shells, and mortars. The naval battery, No. 5, was opened, with great activity, under Captain Aulick, the second in rank of the squadron, at about 10 A. M. His fire was continued to 2 o'clock, P. M., a little before he was relieved by Captain Mayo, who landed with a fresh supply of ammunition \u2014 Captain A. hav ing exhausted the supply he had brought with him. He lost four sailors, killed, and had one officer, Lieutenant Baldwin, slightly hurt. The mortar batteries, Nos. 1, 2, and 3, have fired but languidly durin-r the day, for the want of shells, which are now going out from the beach. The two reports of Colonel Bankhead, chief of artillery, both of this date, copies of which I enclose, give the incidents of these three batteries. Battery No. 4, which will mount four twenty-four pounders and two eight-inch Paixhan guns, has been much delayed in the hands of the inde fatigable engineers by the norther, that filled up the work with sand nearly as fast as it could be opened by the half-blinded labourers. It will, how ever, doubtless be in full activity early to-morrow mornincr. March 25.\u2014 The Princeton being about to start for Philadelphia, I have but a moment to continue this report. All the batteries, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, are in awful activity this morn ing. The effect is, no doubt, very great, and I think the city cannot hold out beyond to-day. To-morrow morning many of the new mortars will be in a position to add their fire, when, or after the delay of some twelve hours, if no proposition to surrender should be received, I shall organize parties for carrying the city by assault. So far the defence has been spi rited and obstinate."], [139, "CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ. 133 I enclose a copy of a memorial received last night, signed by the consuls of Great Britain, France, Spain, and Prussia, within Vera Cruz, asking me to grant a truce to enable the neutrals, together with Mexican women and children, to withdraw from the scene of havoc about them. I shall reply, the moment that an opportunity may be taken, to say\u2014 First, That a truce can only be granted on the application of Governor Morales, with a view to surrender ; second, That in sending safeguards to the different consuls, beginning as far back as the 13th instant, I distinctly admonished them, particularly the French and Spanish consuls\u2014 and, of course, through the two, the other consuls\u2014 of the dangers that have followed; third, That although, at that date, I had already refused to allow any person whatsoever to pass the line of investment either way, yet the blockade had been left open to the consuls and other neutrals to pass out to their respective ships of war up to the 22d instant ; and, fourth, I shall enclose to the memorialists a copy of my summons to the governor, to show that I had fully considered the impending hardships and distresses of the place, including those of women and children, before one gun had been fired in that direction. The intercourse between the neutral ships-of-war and the city was stopped at the last-mentioned date by Commodore Perry, with my concurrence, which I placed on the ground that that intercourse could not fail to give to the enemy moral aid and comfort. It will be seen from the memorial, that our batteries have already had a terrible effect on the city, (also known through other sources,) and hence the inference that a surrender must soon be proposed. In haste, I have the honour to remain, sir, with high respect, your most obedient servant, Winfield Scott. Hon. William L. Marcy, Secretary of War. Head-Quarters of the Army, Vera Cruz, March 29, 1847. Sir, \u2014 The flag of the United States of America floats triumphantly over the walls of this city and the castle of St. Juan de Ulloa. Our troops have garrisoned both since 10 o'clock. It is now noon. Bricadier-general Worth is in command of the two places. Articles of capitulation were signed and exchanged at a late hour night before the last. I enclose a copy of the document. I have heretofore reported the principal incidents of the siege, up to the 25th instant. Nothing of striking interest occurred, until early in the morning of the next day, when I received overtures from General Landero, on whom General Morales has devolved the principal command. A terri ble storm of wind and sand made it difficult to communicate with the city, and impossible to refer to Commodore Perry. I was obliged to entertain the proposition alone, or to continue the fire upon a place that had shown a dispo- M"], [140, "134 CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ. sition to surrender; for the loss of a day, or perhaps several, could not be per mitted. The accompanying papers will show the proceedings and results. Yesterday, after the norther had abated, and the commissioners appointed by me early the morning before had again met those appointed by General Landero, Commodore Perry sent ashore his second in command, Captain Aulick, as a commissioner on the part of the navy. Although not included in my specific arrangement made with the Mexican commander, I did not hesitate, with proper courtesy, to desire that Captain Aulick might be duly introduced and allowed to participate in the discussions and acts of the commissioners who had been reciprocally accredited. Hence the preamble to his signature. The original American commissioners were. Brevet Brigadier-general Worth, Brigadier-general Pillow, and Colonel Totten. Four more able or judicious officers could not have been desired. I have time to add but little more. The remaining details of the siege ; the able co-operation of the United States squadron, successively under the command of Commodores Conner and Perry ; the admirable conduct of the whole army \u2014 regulars and volunteers \u2014 I should be happy to dwell upon as they deserve ; but the steamer Princeton, with Commodore Conner on board, is under way, and I have commenced organizing an advance into the interior. This may be delayed a few days, waiting the arrival of ad ditional means of transportation. In the mean time, a joint operation, by land and water, will be made upon Alvarado. No lateral expedition, however, shall interfere with the grand movement towards the capital. In consideration of the great services of Colonel Totten, in the siege that has just terminated most successfully, and the importance of his presence at Washington, as the head of the engineer bureau, I intrust this despatch to his personal care, and beg to commend him to the very favourable con sideration of the department. I have the honour to remain, sir, with high respect, your most obedient servant, Winfield Scott. Hon. W. L. Marcy, Secretary of War. Gentlemen who were eye-witnesses to the scenes which they portray, write as follows : Camp of the Besieging Army, March 10, 1847. At 2 o'clock this morning the camp was aroused by a brisk fire from the enemy, and the balls came whistling through, \"as thick as hail,\" breakino one man's thigh, and wounding two others. Instead of \" beating the lono roll,\" as usual in cases of alarm, a small detachment, under Captain Gor don, was sent out to reconnoitre. He had not proceeded over two or three hundred yards, when he found his command in the close vicinity of a bodv ofmen. He hailed them, and they answered him in Eno-lish, but the captain, not admiring their accent, withdrew his small force a short dis-"], [141, "CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ. 135 tance, and again hailed, when he was answered with a volley of musketry from their whole body, which was returned by the detachment, and had the effect of compelling the Mexicans to retire towards the town. Nothing but the sagacity of an experienced and able officer prevented the capture or destruction of the whole reconnoitering detachment. The steamer Spitfire, Captain Tatnall, at sunrise took position in front of the castle and town, and commenced a fire, by way of \"opening the ball,\" which she continued for about an hour, and which was returned by the castle and city. Shortly after the Spitfire commenced firing, the first and second divisions moved in a column up the beach towards the city, about a mile, and pro ceeded to invest the place. A Mexican force of cavalry and infantry, numbering, perhaps, four or five regiments in all, showed themselves on the sand heights towards the city, at the distance of half a mile from our advance, and commenced firing musketry. One of the mountain howitzers and rockets were placed on the hills, and fired a few shots and sent a few rockets whizzing through the air without any effect. The Mexicans appeared to be a little shy of them at first, but soon recommenced spread ing their line along the hill and firing their muskets. Captain Taylor was then ordered to try their mettle with a six-pounder, which had not been fired but a few times before they withdrew behind the hill, and left for some place secure from danger. In this firing there was one Mexican killed. General Worth succeeded in taking his position on the right of the line of investment by 11 o'clock. The line circumvallating the city, when completed, will run along a chain of sand-hills about three miles from the city, ranging from three hundred to fifteen hundred feet high, and com pletely overlooking and commanding the town and fortifications, but the heavy guns from the castle can be brought to bear upon the right wing of the line, where no doubt the quarters will be very hot. As soon as General Worth had occupied his ground, General Patter son's division took up its march, with General Pillow's brigade in advance, for the purpose of forming on the left of General Worth. The advance, however, did not proceed over a mile before they became engaged with the enemy in a thick cluster of chapparel. A rapid fire immediately ensued, which lasted about twenty minutes. The Mexicans retreated, and no loss on either side that I could ascertain positively; though I have heard it repeatedly this evening that five dead Mexicans had been found. General Pillow again commenced extending the line, but owing to the great difficulty and labour of cutting a road in the chapparel, through which he had to pass, he had not proceeded more than half a mile, up to 4 o'clock, P. M., when he again came in contact with the enemy, who were in ambuscade. The firing was so heavy, and appeared so to in-"], [142, "CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ. 136 crease, that General Patterson despatched the New York regiment, of Shields's brigade, to the assistance of General Pillow \u2014 but only one com pany of the New Yorkers arrived at the point of attack before General Pillow had routed the enemy by a charge. In this engagement, two of the first Pennsylvanians were slightly wounded, viz. : M. Crann, of com pany C, and T. Tice, of company F. A body of Mexicans was shortly afterwards discovered, through a glass, on the left flank of General Pillow's command, at a house known as a magazine, and I expect it has been occupied as such. A six-pounder was brought to bear on it from one of the heights in our possession, which caused them to leave without ceremony. Towards sundown, General Pillow's brigade very unexpectedly suc ceeded in reaching one of the highest points in the rear of the city, and planting the \" stars and stripes,\" which they greeted, as one of the Ten nesseans said, with \" three of the biggest kind of cheers.\" The batteries from town and castle kept throwing thirteen-inch shells, and twenty-four pound round-shot, at the- entire line, until dark. One of them exploded immediately in front of General Worth and staff, and a portion of it passed through Captain Blanchard's company, but fortunately without injuring any one. General Otuitman's brigade now moved forward and encamped on the right of General Pillow. Camp of the Besieging Army, three miles in rear of city, March 11, 1847. This morning, shortly after daylight, the batteries from the castle and the town opened on our lines, and continued, with short intervals, through out the day. I sincerely regret to announce that, among our losses to-day, is the death of Captain William Alburtis, of the second infantry. His head was shot off with a twenty-four pound shot from the city, while marching with the regiment to join General Twiggs, at the north end. Captain Alburtis was a printer, and former editor of the Virginia Republi can, at Martinsburg, Va. There was also killed by the cannonade, Pri vate Cunningham, of company A, mounted rifles, and a drummer boy of company B, second artillery, had his arm shot off. About 7 o'clock this morning, General Ouitman's brigade was ordered to relieve General Pillow from the position he had occupied durino- the night, in order that his troops might get their breakfast, and procure water to last during the day. The Mexicans saw our party leaving the height, but did not see the other coming up with their cavalry, expecting, no doubt, to steal upon their rear, but they were very much mistaken. General Ouitman advanced to the top of the hill, and a rapid fire at long shots was kept up for about an hour. Captain Davis, of the Georgia regi-"], [143, "CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ. 137 ment, with twenty riflemen, were sent as skirmishers, to incline round under the hill, and engage them at close quarters. As soon as they observed Captain Davis, about two hundred advanced on him, but with his small force he held them in check until Colonel Jackson, with the balance of three companies, and Colonel Dickenson, with his regiment, came to his assistance, when the enemy were compelled to retreat under the cover of the guns of the town, with the loss of several dead and some wounded. Our loss in this affair this morning is seven slightly wounded. The column of General Twiggs moved up this morning, with the mounted rifles in advance, at 9 o'clock, to take position on the left of the line. The undertaking was a most arduous one, but with General Twiggs there is \"no such word as fail.\" When his cannon could not be hauled by horses, they were pulled and lifted by his men, and they were taken up and over sand-ridges that I should think it utterly impossible, and beyond the physical strength of men, to surmount. The advance of this column arrived at their destination, on the sea-shore, above the town, about 2 o'clock, and the rear closed up at sundown. This now entirely circumscribes the place, and the entire line investing occupies a space of ground about eight miles in length. As the troops lay stretched along the hills and valleys, with the stars and stripes dotted here and there, fluttering in the breeze, they present to the view a majestic and sublime appearance. The enemy are now completely within our grasp, and whether they can rend asunder ihe chains that bind them to the confined limits of the walls of the city and castle, remains to be seen. General Worth occupies the right, General Twiggs the left, and General Patterson the centre. If either of these officers can be moved from their positions, one foot, by any force that can be brought against them, I am very much mistaken. Having our position, in the course of two or three days the mortars and cannon will be planted on the heights, when the enemy will have an opportunity of witnessing the effects of our shot upon their city. I was informed, at a late hour last night, that Colonel Persifor F. Smith, with his rifles, has had a very pretty fight with a force of about eight hundred from the city, and compelled them to retire in quick time, with a loss of about twenty-five killed, and several wounded, and sustaining a loss of two or three privates killed and wounded. I have made diligent inquiry into the healih of the army to-day, and the surgeons state that they never knew the army to be in better health and condition, and no evidence of any thing like vomito. [From the Correspondence of the Tropic.] Off Vera Cruz, March 13, 1847. * * * Nothing has been more remarkable in this campaign than the quietness with which the troops were permitted to land. 18 . S^l"], [144, "138 CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ. I have the assurance of officers, whose experience qualifies them to judge, that three pieces of cannon, judiciously planted, and masked by the small eminence which overhangs the point of landing, would have produced terrible havoc amongst our troops. I believe that three pieces so planted and masked, and served with grape and canister-shot, would have placed at least five thousand of our men hors du combat, before they could have reached the position which they were permitted to take unmolested. They could have spiked their guns upon our advance, and retired in perfect safety. To what are we to attribute this supineness? I cannot guess. General Scott may have deceived them somewhat by his reconnoissances of the 6th instant, in which he examined the coast to the northward as well as to the southward of the city ; but this will not account for the mat ter, as half a dozen guns upon each side of the city could form a con sideration of trifling importance to them in the way of defence. But so it was. Previous to the commencement of the attack, Commodore Perry had been appointed, by government, to supersede Conner. The foliowino- are the despatches of the former officer, remarkable, like those of General Taylor, for their terseness and modesty. Flag-ship Mississippi, off Vera Cruz, March 25, 1847. Sir, \u2014 The sailing of the Princeton this day scr the United States offers me an opportunity of informing the department that General Scott had, on the 22d instant, the day after I assumed command of the squadron, so far completed the erection of his batteries in the rear of Vera Cruz, as to authorize the summoning of the city, and, on the refusal of the governor to surrender, of opening his fire at 3 o'clock of that day. In conformity with arrangements made in the morning with General Scott, I directed the flotilla of small steamers and gun-boats of the squad ron, led by Commander J. Tatnall, in the Spitfire, to take a position and commence a simultaneous fire upon the city. The order was promptly and gallantly executed, and the fire was kept up with great animation until late in the evening. On visiting them at their position, I found that the two steamers had nearly exhausted their ammunition, but having received a fresh supply during the night from this ship, they, at sunrise, moved to a more favour able and advanced point, and resumed and continued their fire until recalled by signal. At the earnest desire of myself and officers, General Scctt generously assigned a position in the trenches to be mounted with guns from the squadron, and worked by seamen. Three eight-inch Paixhans and three long thirty-two pounders (all that was required) were consequently landed, and after immense labour in transporting them through the sand, in which"], [145, "CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ. 139 parties from the divisions of Generals Patterson, Worth, and Pillow, respectively detached by those officers, cheerfully participated, the pieces were placed in position and opened upon the city about 10 o'clock yester day, immediately drawing upon them a sharp fire from the enemy, which, in a short time, killed and wounded ten of the detachment from the squadron. In order to give all a chance to serve in the trenches, for the honour of which there is a great, though generous strife, I have arranged that de tachments from each ship, in charge respectively of lieutenants, and the whole commanded by a captain or commander, shall be relieved every twenty-four hours. Captain Aulick, assisted by Commander Mackenzie, and several lieutenants, had the direction of mounting the guns and open ing the fire, and well and bravely was the duty performed. Captain Mayo is now in charge, and will be relieved in turn. The Ohio arrived on the 22d instant, but, in consequence of a norther, did not reach her proper anchorage until yesterday afternoon. Detach ments of boats from all the vessels are employed night and day in landing from the transports the stores and munitions of the army. Enclosed is the list of killed and wounded, ascertained up to this hour, (12 meridian,) with the report of Captain Aulick ; also a list of the small vessels comprising the flotilla of the squadron, all of which were engaged on the 22d instant.

Sir, \u2014 The detention of the Princeton enables me to inform the depart ment of events up to this hour, (10 A. M.) Captain Mayo and his party have returned, having been relieved in the batteries by a detachment under Captain Breese. I hardly need assure the department that the party under Captain Mayo sustained, with unabated courage and spirit, the admirable fire of the naval battery. The bom bardment from the trenches was continued through the night. A heavy norther now blowing, (the third in five days,) has prevented communication with the shore since last evening. Several merchant vessels have been thrown, this morning, ashore by the gale. The report of Captain Mayo is enclosed, as also an additional list of killed and wounded. Among the names of the killed, will be sound that of Midshipman T. B. Shubrick, a most amiable and promising young officer. I have the honour to be your very obedient servant, M. C.

With high respect, your obedient servant, M. C. Perry, Commanding Home Squadron. Hon. John Y. Mason, Secretary of the Navy. The terms of capitulation were the following: \" 1. The whole garrison, or garrisons, to be surrendered to the arms of the United States, as prisoners of war, the 29th instant, at 10 o'clock, A.M.; the garrisons to be permitted to march out with all the honours of war, and to lay down their arms to such officers as may be appointed by the general in-chief of the United States armies, and at a point to be agreed upon by the commissioners. \" 2.

Absolute freedom of religious worship and ceremonies is solemnly guarantied.\" The following is the letter of General Scott to the Spanish consul in the city, in reply to a request of the consul, for the protection of the persons and property of Spanish residents : Head-quarters of the United States Army, Camp Washington, before Vera Cruz. The undersigned. Major-general Scott, general-in-chief of the armies of the United States, has had the honour to receive the note dated the 10th instant, of Senor D. Afiloss G. de Escalante, consul of Spain, residing in the city of Vera Cruz, asking that the said army, in its operations against the city, may respect the persons of Spanish subjects and their property within the same. The undersigned has great pleasure in recognising the intimate relations of amity which happily exist between his government and that of Spain, and the consequent obligations imposed on the public forces of the former, in their operations against the said city, to respect, as far as may be practi cable, Spanish subjects and their property within the same ; but he begs to say to the consul of Spain, that in carrying the city, whether by bom bardment and cannonade, or assault, or all \u2014 and, particularly in the night time, it will be exceedingly difficult for the forces of the United States to perceive the consular flags, or to discriminate between the persons and property of friends, and the persons and property of the enemy. The undersigned can, therefore, only promise to do all that circumstances may possibly permit, to cause such discrimination to be observed ; and, in the mean time, to show his anxiety to carry out that friendly purpose, he sends to her Spanish majesty's consul, residing in Vera Cruz, a printed safeguard, under his (Major-general Scott's) sign-manual, to protect as far as practi cable the house of the Spanish consul, and Spanish subjects and property within the same \u2014 to be shown, if the city should be carried, to all officers and soldiers of the United States forces who may approach the house of the consul ; it being well understood, that the said safeguard is solely in tended to protect Spanish subjects and their property. The undersigned, who has not had the honour to hear directly from the British consul, requests that a like safeguard, herewith enclosed for him, may be delivered by the Spanish consul. The undersigned offers to the consul of her majesty the Queen of Spain, the assurance of the high respect and consideration of the undersigned. Winfield Scott. For the Consul of Spain, at Vera Cruz, Senor D. Afiloss de Escalante."], [148, "CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ. 142 AMERICAN FLEET SALUTING THE CASTLE AT VERA CRUZ. Upon receiving the memorial of the consuls, the Mexican governor addressed a letter to General Scott, requesting his conformity with their request. The American commander replied in a negative to their de mands. The surrender of the city took place on the 29th. The Americans were drawn up in two lines facing each other, and stretching across a plain for more than a mile. The Mexicans left the city at 10 o'clock to the sound of their national music, passed between the American lines, and, after lay ing down their arms and colours, marched for the interior. General Worth had been appointed to superintend the evacuation ; and as soon as it was accomplished, a portion of his division entered the city, to the sound of national music and in full military array. Soon after the flag of the United States was erected over the Plaza, and saluted by the guns of the city and squadron. General Scott took up his head-quarters at the place, and General Worth was appointed military governor. The city of Vera Cruz was found to be in a state of the most diso-ustinc filth, and considerable time was spent in restoring it to cleanliness and health. The Americans remained there about a fortnight in order to recruit themselves after the fatigues of the siege ; and at the end of that time, General Scott prepared for a march into the interior. Previous to setting out, he issued a proclamation declaring his regard for the Mexican religion and customs, and advising all citizens not to join the army which was in arms against the United States."], [149, "CAPTURE OF VERA CRUZ. 143 On the 8th of April, the army left Vera Cruz, and commenced its march for the \"Halls of the Montezumas.\" They advanced in high spirits, and with the certainty of speedy battle, as it was understood that Santa Anna was in the neighbourhood with a large force. After his defeat at Buena Vista, the dictator had used every effort to assemble another army; and succeeding in this, he marched to meet the detachment under General Scott. Upon the near approach of the Americans, he retired towards Puebla, and after stripping it of every thing which might be of service to his army, he marched towards the Jalapa road, and took up a strong posi tion at Sierra Gordo. Here he waited with firmness the approach of the American forces."], [150, "144 BATTLE OF SIERRA GORDO. HE battle of Angostura, and capture of Vera Cruz, had been severe blows to the pride and strength of Mexico ; but with true Spanish i pride, she still refused to yield to her conque- rors, although every battle but testified to her own weakness and the enemy's strength. Santa Anna still possessed energy and influence enough to present a formidable array, and one which, with the strength of his position, enabled him to face the approach of General Scott with coolness Mr. Kendall, of the New Orleans Picayune, thus describes the advance of the American army : \u2014 \" General Twiggs's division of the army reached this place on Sunday last, (April 11th,) and General Patterson's on Mon day evening. Both are now encamped here in a delightful valley on the banks of the Plan del Rio, awaiting the arrival of General Worth's divi sion, and General Quitman's brigade of volunteers. General Scott arrived last evening, and we anticipate in a few days a hard battle. The Mexi cans, to the number of from twelve thousand to fifteen thousand men, with General Vega, if not Santa Anna himself, at their head, are strongly forti fied about three miles in our advance, and appear to be constantly engaged in making their position, if possible, still stronger. They have several bat teries planted, and will make a desperate stand. Our present force here is not over six thousand men, including Steptoe's, Wall's, and the howitzer batteries. The sappers and miners are busily engaged in cuttino- roads. \"April 16th. \u2014 The Mexicans under Santa Anna are occupying a chain of works along the road, the nearest of which is about a mile and a quar ter from General Scott's head-quarters in a direct line. The road this side is cut up and barricaded, and every possible means of defence and annoy-"], [151, "BATTLE OF SIERRA GORDO. 145 ance has been resorted to. Beyond the first work there are three or four others, completely commanding the gorge through which the road to Jalapa runs \u2014 these fortifications on hills, and rising so as to defend one another. It is thought that Santa Anna has twenty thousand men with him \u2014 the lowest estimate gives him fifteen thousand, and with these he has twenty four pieces of field-artillery, besides some fourteen heavy cannon in position. \" To turn the different works, a road has been partially cut through the rough ground and chapparel to the right; and although the reconnoissance is as yet imperfect, it is still thought that a point near the enemy's farthest work can be reached. General Twiggs, with his division, is to march at 8 o'clock to-morrow morning, by the new road, and on the following morning it is thought the attack will commence on the works on this side. If General Twiggs succeeds in reaching the rear of Santa Anna \u2014 and he will use every exertion to do so \u2014 I do not see what can save him. He is generally fox enough, however, to have plenty of holes out of which to escape, and from the great difficulty of reconnoitering his position fully, he may have some means to escape here. The general impression now in camp is, that this is to be the great battle of the war ; and the immense natural strength of Santa Anna's works would justify the belief. General Worth left Puenta Nacional this afternoon with his division, and will be up during to-night. He started a little after 1 o'clock this morning, with nearly two thousand picked men, determined to make a forced march through ; but learning on the road that the attack upon the Mexican works was not to commence as soon as anticipated, he returned to Puenta Na cional, after marching a mile and a half.\" The following description of the Mexican general's position, and of the preparatory arrangements of the American army, are from the pen of a gen tleman who was with General Scott during the whole affair of Sierra Gordo : \" The road from Vera Cruz, as it passes the Plan del Rio, which is a wide, rocky bed of a once large stream, is commanded by a series of high cliffs, rising one above the other, and extending several miles, and all well fortified. The road then debouches to the right, and, curving around the ridge, passes over a high cliff, which is completely enfiladed by forts and batteries. This ridge is the commencement of the Terra Templada, the upper or mountainous country. The high and rocky ravine of the river protected the right flank of the position, and a series of most abrupt and apparently impassable mountains and ridges covered their left. Between these points, running a distance of two or three miles, a succession of strongly fortified forts bristled at every turn, and seemed to defy all bravery and skill. The Sierra Gordo commanded the road on a gentle declination, like a glacis, for nearly a mile\u2014 an approach in that direction was impossi ble. A front attack must have terminated in the almost entire annihilation of our army. But the enemy expected such an attack, confiding in the 19 \u00a3"], [152, "BATTLE OF SIERRA GORDO. 146 desperate valour of our men, and believing that it was impossible to turn their position to the right or left. General Scott, however, with the eye of a skilful general, perceived the trap set for him, and determined to avoid it. He, therefore, had a road cut to the right, so as to escape the front fire from the Sierra, and turn his position on the left flank. This movement was made known to the enemy by a deserter from our camp, and conse quently a large increase of force under General Vega was sent to the forts on their left. General Scott, to cover his flank movements, on the 17th of April, ordered forward General Twiggs against the fort on the steep ascent, in front and a little to the left of the Sierra. Colonel Harney commanded this expedition, and, at the head of the rifles and some detachments of in fantry and artillery, carried his position under a heavy fire of grape and musketry. Having secured this position in front and near the enemy's strongest fortification, and having by incredible labour elevated one of our large guns to the top of the fort, General Scott prepared to follow up his advantages. A demonstration was made from this position against another strong fort in the rear, and near the Sierra, but the enemy were considered too strong, and the undertaking was abandoned. A like demonstration was made by the enemy.\" On the morning of the 18th, the army moved to the attack in columns, and their success was rapid and decisive. General Twiggs's division assaulted the enemy's left, where he had remained during the night, and, after a slight resistance, carried the breastwork at the point of the bayonet, and completely routed its defenders. Meanwhile, Pillow's brigade, accom panied by General Shields, moved rapidly along the Jalapa road, and took up a position to intercept the retreat of the Mexicans. At the same time General Worth pushed forward toward the left, to aid the movement of Twiggs. The rout was total. Three thousand men, with field and other officers, surrendered, and an immense amount of small arms, ordnance and batteries, were also captured. About six thousand Mexicans gained the rear of the Americans on the Jalapa road, but were closely pursued. The Americans lost two hundred and fifty in killed and wounded\u2014 among the latter, General Shields ; the loss of the Mexicans, exclusive of prisoners, was about one hundred more. The following more enlarged description of Twiggs's attack upon the Mexican fort, is given from the account of an eye-witness : \" On the 18th, General Twiggs was ordered forward from the position he had already captured, against the fort which commanded the Sierra. Simultaneously an attack on the fortifications on the enemy's left was to be made by Generals Shields and Worth's division, who moved in sepa rate columns, While General Pillow advanced against the strong forts and difficult ascents on the right of the enemy's position. The enemy, fully acquainted with General Scott's intended movement, had thrown' large"], [153, "SIERRA QOKDO."], [154, ""], [155, "BATTLE OF SIERRA GORDO. 149 bodies of men into the various positions to be attacked. The most serious enterprise was that of Twiggs, who advanced against the main fort that commanded the Sierra. Nothing can be conceived more difficult than this undertaking. The steep and rough character of the ground, the con stant fire of the enemy in front, and the cross fire of the forts and batteries which enfiladed our lines, made the duty assigned to General Twiggs one of surpassing difficulty. \"Nothing prevented our men from being utterly destroyed but the steepness of the ascent under which they could shelter. But they sought no shelter, and onward rushed against a hailstorm of balls and musket shot, led by the gallant Harney, whose noble bearing elicited the applause of the whole army. His conspicuous and stalwarth frame at the head of his brigade, his long arm waving his men on to the charge, his sturdy voice ringing above the clash of arms and din of conflict, attracted the attention and admiration alike of the enemy and of our own men. On, on, he led the columns, whose front lines melted before the enemy's fire like snow-flakes in a torrent, and staid not their course until leaping over the rocky barriers, and bayonetting their gunners, they drove the enemy pell mell from the fort, delivering a deadly fire into their ranks, from their own guns, as they hastily retired. This was truly a gallant deed, worthy of the Chevalier Bayard of our army, as the intrepid Harney is well styled. General Scott, between whom and Colonel Harney there had existed some coolness, rode up to the colonel after this achievement, and remarked to him \u2014 'Colonel Harney, I cannot now adequately express my admiration of your gallant achievement, but at the proper time I shall take great pleasure in thanking you in proper terms.' Harney, with the modesty of true valour, claimed the praise as due to his officers and men. Thus did the division of the gallant veteran, Twiggs, carry the main posi tion of the enemy, and occupy the front which commanded the road. It was here the enemy received their heaviest loss, and their General Vas quez was killed. A little after, General Worth, having, by great exer tions, passed the steep and craggy heights on the enemy's left, summoned a strong fort in the rear of the Sierra to surrender. This fort was manned by a large force under General Pinzon, a mulatto officer of considerable ability and courage, who, seeing the Sierra carried, thought prudent to surrender, which he did with all his force. General Shields was not so fortunate in the battery which he attacked, and which was commanded by General La Vega. A heavy fire was opened on him, under which the fort was carried with some loss by the gallant Illinoisians, under Baker and Bennett, supported by the New Yorkers, under Burnett. Among those who fell under this fire was the gallant general, who received a grape-shot through his lungs, by which he was completely paralyzed, and at the last account was in a lingering state. On the enemy's right, Gene- _! 2"], [156, "BATTLE OF SIERRA GORDO. 150 ral Pillow commenced the attack against the strong forts near the river. The Tennesseans, under Haskell, led the column, and the other volunteer regiments followed. This column unexpectedly encountered a heavy fire from a masked battery, by which HaskeJPs regiment was nearly cut to pieces, and the other volunteer regiments were severely handled. General Pillow withdrew his men, and was preparing for another attack, when the operations at the other points, having proved successful, the enemy con cluded to surrender. Thus the victory was complete, and four generals, and about six thousand men, were taken prisoners by our army. One of their principal generals and a large number of other officers killed. The Mexican force on this occasion certainly exceeded our own.\" According to the account of the captured officers, Santa Anna had in his lines at least eight thousand men, and without the intrenchments about six thousand, of which a third was cavalry. The army was composed of the best soldiers in Mexico. The infantry who had fought so bravely at Buena Vista, and all the regular artillerists of the republic, including several naval officers, were present. Some of the officers whom General Scott released at the capitulation of Vera Cruz without extorting the parole on account of their gallantry, were found among the killed and wounded. Of the latter was a gallant young officer named Halzinger, a German by birth, who excited the admiration of our army during the bombardment of Vera Cruz, by seizing a flag which had been cut down by our balls, and holding it in his right hand until a staff could be procured. He had been released by General Scott without a parole, and was found on the field of Sierra Gordo dangerously wounded. In addition to the loss of the enemy in killed and taken they lost about thirty pieces of brass cannon, mostly of large calibre, manufactured at the royal foundery of Seville. A large quantity of fixed ammunition, of a very superior quality, together with the private baggage and money-chest of Santa Anna, containing twenty thousand dollars, was also captured. On the same day that the battle of Sierra Gordo was fought, a portion of the American Gulf Squadron, under Commodore Perry, captured the town of Tuspan, on the Gulf. On the 19th, the city of Jalapa was captured by a detachment under General Twiggs ; and on the 22d, General Worth entered the town of Perote. Both these cities were taken without opposition; and in the latter were found immense stores of small arms, ammunition, and the large guns of the city and castle. On the 30th, the following General Orders were issued to the army : \" 1. The divisions of the army in this neighbourhood will be held in readiness to advance soon after the arrival of trains now coming up from Vera Cruz."], [157, "BATTLE OF SIERRA GORDO. 151 \"2. The route and time of commencing the march will be given at general head-quarters. \"3. Major-general Patterson, after designating a regiment of volunteers as part of the garrison to hold this place, will put his brigades successively in march with an interval of twenty-four hours between them. \"4. Brigadier-general Twiggs' division will follow the movement, also, by brigades. \"5. Each brigade, whether of regulars or volunteers, will be charged with escorting such part of the general supply train of the army as the chiefs of the genera] staff may have ready to send forward. \"6. Every man of the division will take two days' subsistence in his haversack. This will be the general rule for all marches when a greater number of rations is not specially mentioned. \"7. As the season is near when the army may no longer expect to derive supplies from Vera Cruz, it must begin to look exclusively to the resources of the country. \"8. Those resources, far from being over-abundant near the line of ope rations, would soon fail to support both the army and the population, unless they be gathered in without waste and regularly issued by quarter-masters and commissaries. \"9. Hence, they must be paid for, or the people will withhold, conceal or destroy them. The people, moreover, must be conciliated, soothed or well treated by every officer and man of this army, and by all its followers. \" 10. Accordingly, whosoever maltreats unoffending Mexicans, takes with out pay or wantonly destroys their property, of any kind whatsoever, will prolong the war, waste the means, present and future, of subsisting our own men and animals as they successively advance into the interior or return to our water depot, and no army can possibly drag after it to any considerable distance, no matter what the season of the year, the heavy articles of breadstuff's, meat and forage. \"11. Those, therefore, who rob, plunder or destroy the houses, fences, cattle, poultry, grain fields, gardens or property of any kind along the line of our operations, are plainly the enemies of this army. The general-in-chief would infinitely prefer that the few who commit such out ranks should desert at once and fight against us ; then it would be easy to shoot them down or to capture and hang them. \" 12. Will the great body of intelligent, gallant and honourable men who compose this army tolerate the few miscreants who perpetrate such crimes ? Again, the general-in-chief confidently hopes not. Let then the guilty be promptly seized and brought to condign punishment, or the good must suf fer the consequences in supphes and loss of character, of crimes not their own. \" 13. To prevent straggllng and marauding, the roll of every company"], [158, "BATTLE OF SIERRA GORDO. 152 of the army will be called at every halt by and under the eye of an officer. In camps and in quarters there must be at least three such roll calls daily. Besides, stragglers on marches will certainly be murdered or captured by rancheros. \" 14. The waste of ammunition by neglect, and idle or criminal firing, is a most serious evil in this army. All officers are specially charged to see that not a cartridge be lost from want of care, nor fired except by order otherwise ; fifty wagons of ammunition would not suffice for the cam paign, and it is difficult to find ten. Let every man remember that it is unsafe to meet the enemy without he has forty rounds in his cartridge box. \" 15. Every regiment that leaves wounded or sick men in hospital, will take care to leave a number of attendants according to the requisition of the principal surgeon of the hospital. Those least able to march will be selected as attendants. This rule is general.\" On the 15th of May, General Worth, the active coadjutor of the com mander-in-chief, took possession of the city of Puebla. The following spi rited description is given by one of the officers of his command. \" General Worth's command, four thousand strong, entered and took pos session of this city of palaces, with its eighty thousand population, on the 15th. Our guns gape on the city, and on its lazeroni, from every quarter. At Amazogue, twelve miles in the rear, Santa Anna came out to meet us with a column of about three thousand five hundred, supposing, as was the fact, that one of General Worth's brigades (Quitman's) was in the rear. We gave him the usual reception, a la Rough and Ready. We could only get Santa Anna near enough to give play to our light batteries, and only keep him in range long enough to unsaddle ninety cavalry. Santa Anna never fired a shot, and of course there was no loss on our side. WTe followed as close on his heels as tired foot could after Mexican horses well frightened, and entered Puebla at 10 o'clock in the morning, while Santa Anna had left at 4 o'clock, with a guard of three hundred or four hundred cavalry. Could General Worth have reached him, General Santa Anna and his force would have been destroyed. He is now at the capital, and a pronunciamento is hourly looked for. It is thought Herrera will be elected president ; the vote took place on the 15th. \" We are over eighty miles, or four days' march of the Halls of the Mon tezumas. The general-in-chief probably left Jalapa yesterday, and will be here in five days, (the 24th of May.\") The expected proclamation of Santa Anna, mentioned in the above ex tract, was issued from Ayotla, three days after the date of that letter. It is a document grounded on necessity, but displays the ingenuity of its author, who, although professing entire willingness to resign his hi<rh office as dictator, yet so manages his language as to inspire respect for himself,"], [159, "BATTLE OF SIERRA GORDO. 153 and a continuance of the favour of his people. The following is his paper : \" Excellent sir, \u2014 From the moment of my arrival at this point, I learned, from reliable sources, with profound regret, that my approach to the capital with the 'army of the east,' had diffused great alarm among the inhabitants, caused by the idea that it was intended to defend the city within itself, as well as by the agitation of party interests, which, putting political passions in action, have, it would seem, in this case, made com mon cause with the enemies of the national honour and independence. Alarmed by this state of things, which left to its natural course would not only rob me of the sole possession which remains to me on earth, my honour, but might at the same time decidedly injure the holy cause which we defend, I believed it to be my duty to suspend my march, in order to render to the supreme government an account of my actions and in tentions, hoping that the loyalty and frankness with which I shall make the explanation, will prevent the most horrible calamity which, under pre sent circumstances, could afflict our country \u2014 distrust and division among those who are called upon to save it. \" When I took up my line of march for that city, it was in consequence of a resolution adopted by a council of war ; of which I informed your excellency in my note of the day before yesterday, by which the salvation of your capital was considered as a measure advantageous and necessary for the ulterior operations of the war ; concluding that this would suffice to bring it to a happy and honourable termination. Notwithstanding these convictions, I had determined, on my arrival at the capital, to submit the same question to a new and more numerous council, presided over by the oldest general of the army, proposing to myself to conform to its decision, and even to resign my military power, as was manifested in the note re ferred to. Such were my intentions, to which, I solemnly aver, no thought of personal aggrandizement or ambition entered. The nation has seen that since my return to the republic, I have passed my life in the field, not accepting the supreme power until a majority of the representatives of the nation loudly called for me to put an end to the civil war which was de vouring the heart of the republic. \" Neither the abnegation so entire, nor so many and so severe sacrifices as I have made, have been sufficient to destroy old prejudices ; calumny and suspicion have arisen to infuse new gall into the already too bitter cup of my life. And under what circumstances 1 When I lead to the capital, for its defence, a corps saved from the ruins of the army, and when I come to ask of the country no other favour than to die in defence of its cause. Although this unexpected and unmerited recompense presents to me the opportunity of retiring with honour from the very difficult position in which I find myself involved, I will, nevertheless, take no such step, volun- 20"], [160, "BATTLE OF SIERRA GORDO. 154 tarily ; it shall never be said that the man to whom the nation had con fided its salvation did not make every kind of sacrifice \u2014 even that of self love or proper appearances\u2014 before he retired from the front of the enemy ; that if he did so, he was forced by unconquerable obstacles ; in fine, be cause he was repudiated by his fellow-countrymen. \" In my person are actually centred two kinds of representation \u2014 both supreme\u2014 the one military, and the other political, which respectively claim the discharge of peculiar duties ; it is necessary to satisfy both, and I shall do it as fully and completely as the circumstances in which I am placed are difficult. The first requires that I should manifest frankly and explicitly my convictions in respect lo the military operations intrusted to my charge, and these are that the war should be continued until we obtain justice from our unjust aggressor, and that, in order to attain this result, it is necessary to preserve the capital at all hazards ; as well that its defence may be the base of ulterior operations, as that I greatly fear, were it occu pied without resistance, that the public spirit would be broken, and the complete submission of the country follow. \" My duty as first magistrate of the nation, now atrociously outraged, and unworthily suspected by unjust and artful detractors, requires that 1 should remove the pretext, invented by perfidy and pusillanimity, to nullify the generous efforts which good citizens are disposed to make to save their honour and independence. In order to arrive at this result, it is indispen sable to make known to the government my plan, which I have insinuated on other occasions, and which I now expose in the two following points : first, to conduct the war upon the principles already indicated ; and se condly, to consider as one of the necessary present means the salvation of the capital. Being resolved not to swerve from these points, I desire that your excellency will inform his excellency, the president, of the same, so that if a contrary resolution be taken, he may consider that I have formally resigned my command-in-chief of the army and first magistracy of the republic, sending me suitable passports that I may retire to such place as shall be to me convenient. \" It may so happen, that although there is an absolute conformity with my ideas, it may be supposed that I myself am an obstacle to carrying them into the desired effect. I have already said that the circumstances would be propitious for me to retire from the difficult situation at which I have arrived, in a manner easy and honourable, by a prompt resignation ; but I entertain an exalted idea of my duties ; I know the obligations I con tracted towards the nation when it called me to its head, confiding in me its precious defence. Never will I betray these duties, and a voluntary separation from affairs would cause it to be beheved that I was implicated in an infamous desertion. My country has me on her side, and I am re solved to prosecute the mission to which she has called me to the last ex-"], [161, "BATTLE OF SIERRA GORDO. 155 treme : my dearest interests and my very existence are placed upon the altar of the liberty and independence of my country. \"As I desire to seek and conform to sound opinion, I wish that, speak ing with loyalty and frankness, the supreme government would inform me whether it believes that I ought to separate myself from the charges which have been confided to me, and I will not hesitate a moment to resign them. I shall thus have given way to respectable opinion, and not to the calcula tions of faction or individual interest. I shall retire, tranquilly making the last sacrifice, that of my opinions ; and of the satisfaction I would have had in shedding my blood for my country, and standing by its side in the moment of its affliction.\" O this letter Santa Anna received answer that the views of \" his excellency the general, respecting the war and the defence of the capital at all costs, were the same as his excellency the president substitute had always enter- tained.\" He was also invited to the capital and to the assumption of supreme power. In obedience to this in- vitation he left his army with some officers, and proceeded toward the capital. His reception, however, was any thing but flattering. His late disasters bad estranged the fickle populace from their late idolized dictator ; and he was met by their curses and denunciations. It is even reported that stones and missiles were cast upon his head, and that a double guard alone saved him from being dragged through the streets in ignominy or murdered. Much of this report has since been contradicted, and it is stated that upon his entrance he was enabled to immediately assume the supreme authority. Upon his entrance into the capital he applied himself to the raising of a defensive military force to oppose the progress of General Scott. He also beo-an to fortify Gaudaloupe, Person and other stations near the city, but was not able to complete them satisfactorily on account of an opposition to his plans prevalent among a large portion of the inhabitants. He left Mexico in May, and fora short time threatened an attack upon Vera Cruz ; but subsequently fell back to a very strong position between the capital and the armv of General Scott. Here it is expected that he will make his last great stand for the safety of the capital, and the news of a decisive battle is looked for with great anxiety. Mexico is now torn by civil dissensions, and any government but her own would be a gain to her. Yet still her people persist, with an obsti nacy rarely equalled, to refuse all overtures of peace, and notwithstanding their immense losses of life and treasure, madly hope to repel a nation, with whom every advantage has hitherto failed to give them one single victory. Perhaps few nations have ever met with so many and heavy losses in so short a period ; and no one certainly has persevered, under similar circum-"], [162, "BATTLE OF SIERRA GORDO. 156 stances, in maintaining an erect front, and furnishing army after army of devoted citizens. How long this feeling will prevail, it is impossible to tell. General Scott may be victorious in the coming battle, and will then no doubt take immediate possession of the capital. But will the war then be ended ? Will the loss of their principal city arrest the intrusions of the numerous guerilla bands which are known to infest every forest and moun tain, and whose avowed military code is no quarter to an American? These are questions rife with importance to every lover of peace, and to every American, and should receive the gravest consideration of our country. War at any time is a fearful calamity, but when it places men on a foreign soil, far from any resources, but those of the barest necessity, exposed to blazing suns, wasting marches, and ravaging local diseases, with no power to make a decisive blow, and with a chaos of prospects before them, then indeed humanity calls loudly for its termination. A practical illustration of this we have in the history of the Tennessee regi ment, when passing through New Orleans. On their way to the seat of war they numbered nine hundred strong young recruits ; just one year after, when they returned through the same city, their broken remnant dis played three hundred and fifty worn-out men. Two-thirds of their origi nal number, averaging about fifty per month, had been left on the plains of Mexico. However opinions may disagree concerning the origin and progress of the Mexican war, we think all are willing to unite in a wish for its speedy termination. Battles and cities may yet be won, and the nation will not be dilatory in her expression of admiration and bravery for the troops who have gained them ; but with greater alacrity would she hail the news of a permanent and honourable peace between the two republics."], [163, "AFFAIRS IN NEW MEXICO THE campaigns of Taylor and Scott were not the only occasions to call forth the prowess of American soldiery. An army, separate from both the main ones, had entered New Mexico in the commencement of the war, and, after a few successful battles, had taken military possession of all Northern Mexico and California. Although these battles were fought at various times, we have thought proper to throw the account of all the operations in those provinces into one description, in order not only to obtain a more connected view of them, but also to avoid in terrupting the narratives of more important events. In the spring of 1846 the United States govern ment determined to explore New California, and the country to the north of it, and for that purpose sent out Captain John C. Fremont, with a force of sixty two men. On entering the territory he learned that his arrival had been anticipated, and that a large force under General Castro, was advancing to attack him. Instead of returning to Oregon, he retired to a mountain position about thirty miles from Monterey, the capital of California, where he intrenched himself and awaited the expected attack. As this did not take place, he determined so far to enlarge on his original mission, as to enable him t'o act in the capacity of a military leader. Accordingly he detached small parties to different portions of the neighbourhood, one of which cap tured thirteen men and two hundred horses on the 11th of June ; and on the 15th a second took possession of the Sanoma Pass, containing nine O 157"], [164, "AFFAIRS IN NEW MEXICO. 158 cannon, two hundred and fifty muskets, and some other munitions, and a small garrison. After this affair, Fremont advanced toward the Sacrimento river, but was obliged to return in consequence of information that General Castro was on the point of attacking the small garrison he had left at Sanoma. He arrived at Sanoma on the 25th, at the head of ninety riflemen, and detached twenty men upon a party of seventy dragoons, whom they defeated, killing and wounding several, without loss to themselves. After this skirmish, General Castro retired to Santa Clara, whither the Ame rican party determined to pursue him. He now learned that an American force, under General Kearney, had taken possession of New Mexico ; and that Commodore Sloat had taken Monterey, and was ready to combine with him in the pursuit of Castro. On the 18th of August, Brigadier-general Kearney, with sixteen hun dred men, took possession of Santa Fe, the capital of New Mexico. He had left Fort Leavenworth on the 30th of June, and marched across a plain country for the distance of eight hundred and thirty-seven miles. The city was taken without opposition ; Governor Armigo, and the garri son of four thousand troops, flying at his approach. General Kearney now advanced for California, but, after proceeding nearly two hundred miles, he received information of the occupation of that country by Fremont. He, therefore, sent most of his forces back to Santa Fe, and advanced with only one hundred to join Fremont. Meanwhile, the pursuit of Castro was continued, and on the 12th of August, a body of riflemen and marines, under Fremont and Stockton, who had succeeded Sloat in the navy, took undisputed possession of the \"City of the Angels.\" Commodore Stockton now appointed Fremont as Governor of all New Mexico, to act until he should return to the City of the Angels. The army now remained quiet until the commencement of the year 1847. On January 24th, two hundred and ninety Americans, under Colonel Price, advanced on the village of La Canada, where two thousand Mexicans and Indians were posted among the hills and strong positions. A battle commenced by the American artillery, and, after an hour's fight, the Mexicans broke and fled on all sides, having experienced a losl of thirty-six killed and forty-five wounded. The Americans lost none Another engagement took place on the 29th, at El Embudo, between a large Mexican force and some Americans under Captain Burgwin. On account of the difficulties experienced by the Americans in gaining the heights, the battle continued longer than it would otherwise\\ave done. The enemy, however, were finally routed, with the loss of twenty killed and sixty wounded ; the Americans lost but one killed and one wounded. On the 3d of February, at about 2 P. M.. the Americans attacked the"], [165, "AFFAIRS IN NEW MEXICO. 159 village of Puebla de Taos, and an engagement ensued which lasted until dark. It was renewed on the 4th, and again continued until evening. At that tune the Americans had penetrated into the village, and the Mexi cans sued for peace on the following morning. This victory placed all New Mexico in the hands of the invaders. Meanwhile, equally important operations were going forward in the department of Chihuahua. The Mexicans had fortified a very strong position in a valley crossing the road to the city of Chihuahua. Here they were attacked at 3 o'clock on the afternoon of the 28th of February, and the engagement continued until dark, when the Mexicans broke and fled on all sides, leaving their cannon and other munitions in the hands of the victors. In this affair, the American force was nine hundred and twenty-four, of whom one was killed, and eight wounded, one mortally. The Mexicans numbered twelve hundred cavalry, twelve hundred infantry, and fourteen hundred and twenty ran cheros ; their loss was three hundred killed, as many wounded, forty pri soners, and their entire artillery, ten wagons, and large stores of provi sions. EVERAL other skirmishes have taken place in these provinces, but all so small as not to deserve a record in history. The above accounts we have given as the result of a patient and laborious compilation from all available sources, without vouching for the correctness of all the details. Possibly, some of the actions may have been overwrought by the reports of interested participators ; no doubt the loss of the Mexicans is somewhat exaggerated, and, perhaps, that of our own forces concealed ; but for this we are not responsible. One thing is cer tain \u2014 New Mexico and the Californias are now ours, as far as military conquest can give one nation a title to the territory of another. The Mex icans, it is true, still maintain their ranchero and guerilla parties there ; but they are able to accomplish little more than occasionally to surprise strao-glino' individuals. Mexico can never recover her lost possessions but by treaty. But, are the people satisfied with their new government ? It is not our province fully to discuss this question ; but a reference to it, as a matter of history, may not be irrelevant. Accounts from Fremont and Stockton represent the inhabitants as not only satisfied, but well pleased with the chano-e ; private accounts describe them as filled with secret hatred, and a desire of revenge ; and this is confirmed by late proclamations of the clergy, those omnipotent directors of the Mexican mind, as well as by"], [166, "160 AFFAIRS IN NEW MEXICO. other sources. One thing is certain ; every nation, however miserable her political condition, is always jealous of foreign interference, even though it be evidently to her interest to accept of it. This feeling seems to be an inseparable result of the love of country, wisely implanted in every human breast. Of this feeling, the Mexicans, as well as other people, have their full share ; and its effects are increased by that overweening pride and self-confidence, which forms so prominent a part in their charac ter. Add to this, the seeling prevalent throughout Mexico, that the Ame ricans are but a band of usurping robbers, and we will have a mass of irresistible evidence against the pacific manifestations of New Mexico. Of course, while such a disposition exists, government cannot be administered happily or satisfactorily. Confidence between the ruled and their rulers will be altogether w*anting ; and soon they will begin to look upon each other in the old light, and act accordingly. We much fear, that although all is at present peaceable, the time is approaching when the sword will again be unsheathed, and the history of the Californias and New Mexico be darkened by many accounts of hard-sought actions lost and won."], [167, "THE BATTLE OF CHURUBUSCO. FTER the battle of Sierra Gordo, General Scott re- mained for some time inactive, in the hope of receiv- ing reinforcements. His head-quarters were at Puebla. Meanwhile the Mexicans, discouraged but not disheartened by their late disasters, were col- lecting another army and fortifying the different entrances to the capital. When a small number of additional troops arrived, the American army left Puebla on the 8th of August, and after a fatiguing march in an un healthy season, reached Ayotla about the 12th. A reconnoissance now took place of the rocky fortification of St. Pinon, which was found to be so well defended, both by nature and art, as to render an attack upon it eminently hazardous. Another road was discovered, south of Lake Charles, opening into that from Vera Cruz, below Ayotla, and the old one abandoned. The march was a dreadful one. Heavy rains had filled the low places with water, through which the troops were often obliged to wade ; while in many places steep and towering heights were to be crossed, in the paths and gorges of which the enemy had rolled immense masses of stone. The nio-hts were dark, wet, and dreary, and a damp and chilly rest succeeded the heavy labours of each day. On the 17th, the advance reached San Auo-ustin, a village about twelve miles south of the city, and was joined next day by the second division. General Worth advanced a division to 2i o 2 161"], [168, "THE BATTLE OF CHURUBUSCO 162 take possession of a hacienda, near the fortification of San Antonio, and preparatory to assaulting the latter place. The village was captured, but in a reconnoissance that ensued, a heavy discharge from a Mexican bat tery killed Captain Thornton, and wounded one or two others. An artil lery squadron and battalion of infantry continued to hover round the redoubt in hope of making a successful attack that afternoon ; but, towards evening, a heavy rain ensued, and General Scott thought proper to with draw them. All night, the hostile batteries frowned in gloomy silence upon this detachment ; had they opened with activity it might have been forced to retire, or perhaps even been cut to pieces. During the night, the divisions of Pillow and Twiggs marched toward the strong work of Contreras, so as to take up a position for an assault on the following morning. The fatigue they encountered was appalling. The country was enveloped in thick darkness, rain poured down in streams, while the wind tossed and whirled like the ground in an earth quake. Now they mounted over clumps and ridges, formed by rocks of lava, and entangled with dense brushwood ; and now plunged into some swollen stream, whose rushing waters destroyed all order of march. Dimly, in the distance, could be observed the flame of camp fires, strug gling through the wind and rain ; while the rumbling of heavy cannon, the tramp of horses, the clashing of guns and bayonets, and the thunder ings of the tempest, rolled strangely through the sullen night. T eight next morning, the Mexican batteries re-opened upon the hacienda of San Antonio, where General Worth was posted. The heavy explosions shook the air, while houses and strong bulwarks sunk in thundering masses beneath the showers of shot and shells. The balls whistled through the quiet lanes, raking them from end to end, and tearing up the ground in deep ridges. Large bombs burst I in the air, throwing slugs, shot, and fragments among the Americans, with terrible effect. Yet these gallant troops, dis daining to yield, stationed themselves behind walls and buildings, and, though all around was ruin and confusion, calmly prepared for active duty. Soon after, the divisions of Pillow and Twiggs pushed toward Contreras, which, after a fatiguing march, they reached about 1 o'clock, p. M.' General P. F. Smith was then ordered to march up in face of the enemy's works, and Colonel Riley to move rapidly toward the right, gain the main road, and cut off any Mexican reinforcement that might present itself. Smith rushed forward amid a tremendous fire, and gained a position for his artillery ; every gun on both sides now opened, and the terrific explo sions shook the ground for miles around, and rolled in deafening echoes"], [169, "THE BATTLE OF C H U R U B U S C O. 163 along the mountain ridges of Mexico. But the few guns of the American advanced battery were soon silenced ; and General Pierce marched to the relief of General Smith. About this time, large reinforcements of the enemy approached Contreras, and General Cadwalader pushed forward to reinforce Riley. Again the batteries broke forth in rapid discharges, but neither army yielded one inch of ground. About 4 o'clock, a com manding figure swept along the American line, while his piercing eyes glanced over the field of action. \"General Scott!\" rang from rank to rank, and a shout, wild and enthusiastic, poured forth his wel come. Perceiving the immense strength of the Mexicans, the com mander-in-chief ordered General Shields to reinforce Riley and Cad walader, and also strengthened the army in front of the enemy. The whole field was now covered with soldiers, marching and wheeling in line. At some distance off, the Mexican cavalry hovered like a cloud on the movements of Cadwalader and Riley ; while on the side of General Smith, peal after peal of heavy ordnance told that death was raging with terrible strides among the ranks of the high-souled combatants. For six hours the dreadful work continued, when darkness closed round the armies, and the firing grew less and less rapid, then died away and all was still. The disappointed Americans, who, unacquainted with the enemy's strength, had calculated on speedy victory, lay down on the rug ged ground without blankets, and amid rushing floods of rain that, collect ing among the ridges, rushed and foamed like mountain torrents. About 8 o'clock General Scott retired to San Augustin, and was followed by Twiggs and Pillow, at 11. Early the next morning, Generals Scott and Worth again set out for Contreras. Some cannonading, and a rapid discharge of musketry, was heard in that direction, and, soon after, Captain Mason galloped up to the commander-in-chief, with the tidings, that Smith had carried the whole line of fortifications at Contreras. That enterprising general had planned and executed the assault, and suffered comparatively small loss. He cap tured fifteen hundred prisoners, including Generals Salas, Blanco, Garcia, and Mendoza, an immense amount of ammunition and camp equipage, and fifteen artillery pieces ; among them the two that had been taken from Captain O'Brien at Buena Vista. Seven hundred of the enemy were killed, and a still larger number wounded ; while the route of the fugi tives was strewed with muskets and other arms. Upon receiving this intelligence, General Scott sent General Worth to make a demonstration on San Antonio, while he, with a portion of the army, should get in its rear. The troops composing the latter passed by the late battle-field. Even the bold heart of the soldier grew sick at the shocking spectacle. Hundreds, that but one day before were active with health and ambition, now covered the bloody plain, stiff, pale, and dis-"], [170, "THE BATTLE OF CHURUBUSCO. 164 torted as death had left them. Here and there a wretch, writhing in agony, moaned forth a prayer for water ; while the neighbouring streams ran red with human blood, and mangled heaps were piled on each other along their banks. On reaching San Pablo, another action com menced, and at almost the same instant, the roar of Worth's cannon was heard at Churubusco. The flower of the American army was now en gaged with that of Mexico, and the battle was one of those rarely witnessed on the continent. Thousands of musketry rattled in uninterrupted suc cession, while, now and then, the deep cannon would break in with sullen roar, that rolled trembling away in the distance. On one part of the field the commanding form of Scott was sweeping from rank to rank, animat ing and superintending his legions, heedless of the thick storm that was whizzing like hail around him ; on another, the loud voices of Worth and Twiggs were shouting their heroes on the stubborn foe. Dark around that scene hung dense columns of smoke, as though hiding man's dark character from the gaze of day. In two hours, all the works were in possession of the Americans, and the enemy in full flight for the city. General Worth pursued them almost to the gates of the capital. The next morning, a portion of the American army entered the town of Chapultepec, without opposition; and soon after, flags arrived from General Santa Anna, proposing a suspension of hostilities. Negotiations took place, and the following commissioners were appointed to arrange a temporary suspension. The following is the result of their delibera tions : THE ARMISTICE. The undersigned, appointed respectively, the first three by Major-gene ral Winfield Scott, commander-in-chief of the armies of the United States, and the last two by his Excellency D. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, President of the Mexican Republic, and commander-in chief of its armies, met with full powers, which were fully verified in the village of Tacubaya, on the 23d day of August, 1847, to enter into an armistice for the purpose of giving the Mexican government an opportunity of receiving propositions of peace from the commissioners appointed by the President of the United States, and now with the American army, when the following articles were agreed upon : Art. 1. Hostilities shall instantly and absolutely cease between the armies of the United States of America and the United Mexican States, within thirty leagues of the capital of the latter States, to allow time to the' commissioners appointed by the United States and the commissioners to be appointed by the Mexican Republic to negotiate. 2. The armistice shall continue as long as the commissioners of the two governments may be engaged on negotiations, or until the commander of"], [171, "THE BATTLE OF CHURUBUSCO. 165 either of the said armies shall give formal notice to the other of the cessa tion of the armistice for forty-eight hours after such notice. 3. In the mean time, neither army shall, within thirty leagues of the city of Mexico, commence any new fortification or military work of offence or defence, or do any thing to enlarge or strengthen any existing work or fortification of that character within the said limits. 4. Neither army shall be reinforced within the same. Any reinforce ments in troops or munitions of war, other than subsistence now approach ing either army, shall be stopped at the distance of twenty-eight leagues from the city of Mexico. 5. Neither army, or any detachment from it, shall advance beyond the line it at present occupies. 6. Neither army, nor any detachment or individual of either, shall pass the neutral limits established by the last article, except under a flag of truce bearing the correspondence between the two armies, or on the busi ness authorized by the next article ; and individuals of either army, who may chance to straggle within the neutral limits, shall, by the opposite party, be kindly warned off, or sent back to their own armies under flags of truce. 7. The American army shall not, by violence, obstruct the passage from the open country into the city of Mexico, of the ordinary supplies of food necessary to the consumption of its inhabitants, or the Mexican army within the city ; nor shall the Mexican authorities, civil or military, do any act to obstruct the passage of supplies from the city or country, needed by the American army. 8. All American prisoners of war remaining in the hands of the Mexi can army, and not heretofore exchanged, shall immediately, or as soon as practicable, be restored to the American army, against a like number, having regard to rank, of Mexican prisoners captured by the American army. 9. All American citizens who were established in the city of Mexico prior to the existing war, and who have since been expelled from that city, shall be allowed to return to their respective business or families therein, without delay or molestation. 10. The better to enable the belligerent armies to execute these articles, and to favour the great object of peace, it is further agreed between the parties, that any courier with despatches that either army shall desire to send along the line from the city of Mexico or its vicinity, to and from Vera Cruz, shall receive a safe conduct from the commander of the oppos- ing army. 11. The administration of justice between Mexicans, according to the general and state constitutions and laws, by the local authorities of the towns and places occupied by the American forces, shall not be obstructed in any manner."], [172, "THE BATTLE OF CHURUBUSCO. 166 12. Persons and property shall be respected in the towns and places occupied by the American forces. No person shall be molested in the exercise of his profession ; nor shall the services of any one be required without his consent. In all cases where services are voluntarily rendered, a just price shall be paid, and trade remain unmolested. 13. Those wounded prisoners who may desire to remove to some more convenient place, for the purpose of being cured of their wounds, shall be allowed to do so without molestation, they still remaining prisoners. 14. The Mexican medical officers who may wish to attend the wounded shall have the privilege of doing so, if their services be required. 15. For the more perfect execution of this agreement, two commission ers shall be appointed, one by each party, who, in case of disagreement, shall appoint a third. 16. This convention shall have no force or effect, unless approved by their excellencies, the commanders respectively of the two armies, within twenty-four hours, reckoning from the sixth hour of the 23d day of Au gust, 1847.
