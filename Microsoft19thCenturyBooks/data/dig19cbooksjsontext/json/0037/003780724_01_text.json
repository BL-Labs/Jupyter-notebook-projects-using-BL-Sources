And so your Vicar is then reaUy coming to-morrow ; to-morrow, my dear Cure*, is it not so ? \" \" One thing at a time Doctor, if you please ; check to my king you said \u2014 weU let me see, ah ! yes, I cover him perfectly thus \u2014 proceed with your question.\" \" Cover him, indeed !

It seems to me he has been waiting until your sight should have become too dim for you to be capable of examining him too distinctly, which he may possibly find desirable. I have known such things occur.\" A slight gesture, an almost imperceptible turn of the head in the direction of the speaker, stopped this flow of words very suddenly, and at the same time brought into the full flood of Hght, which streamed from an opposite window, the face and person of the Cure-. The tonsured crown and cassock, which bespoke his calling, harmonized well with the priestly gravity of the wearer's counte nance, of which the features, though slightly worn, were calm, and full of peace ; a look of pain, however, crossed them as he endeavoured to face the sunlight ; and he sighed, as, covering his eyes with his hand, he turned away. No one, who had remarked his opponent's"], [9, "VERONIA. 3 aspect on the previous instant, would ever have supposed it capable of assuming so different an expression as it did at this moment. A long woebegone countenance, com posed of the most irregular and exaggerated features, was surmounted by a forest of light-coloured, ray less hair, which, under the excitement of his play, had been pushed erect from off his brow ; a figure all points and angles, and yet possessing a certain curious distinction, singularly independent of any physical endowment apparent in him; all the peculiarities combined had produced one of the most extraordinary, and quaint looking beings it would be possible to imagine, and yet a single glance of the pale sad eyes (which had been fixed with ludicrous intensity upon the board), when raised towards his companion, changed, as by a magic touch, the entire character of his face and person. Nothing more harsh and uncouth than the outward man ; no thing more gentle, honest, and gracious than the soul that looked forth from within. \" You are tired, Paul ? It is my fault, b 2"], [10, "4 VERONIA. how thoughtless of me ! A beautiful posi tion, you see ; I should have mated in the next move or so, but it will keep, it will keep ; we will leave the board untouched and resume the game to-morrow,\" and he rose impetuously to lay it aside, but his opponent interposed. \" On no account, my dear Doctor. I should be quite distressed to leave it un finished \u2014 the Hght hurts me, that's all. Now see \" \u2014 and he made another move \u2014 \" does not that rather change our relative positions? Check to you now, and be careful how you move.\" Again the pale scrutinizing eyes were bent intently on the board, as with every faculty absorbed, their owner watched the fatal piece descend ; despairingly, as it did so, and without a pause, he seized one of his own men, made a rapid move, and heart and soul suspended on it, awaited in breathless silence the result. It came. A moment's pause, and then the dreadful words, \" Check-mate /\" \" Sac a papier ! \" exclaimed the van quished Doctor, with a frantic bound."], [11, "5 VERONIA. \" How can it be ? inconceivable, incom prehensible ! \" And seizing the chair on which he had been seated, and hoisting it aloft Hke the club of Hercules, he started across the chamber, thus equipped, with hasty and un equal steps ; then, abruptly stopping as he caught the priest's half-smiling look directed towards him, he lowered it softly as if over whelmed with confusion, and sat down upon it in silence, with head a little droop ing, and his eyes directed bashfully towards the silver buckles of the Cure's shoes. \" My dear Van Helder,\" said the latter, kindly laying a hand upon his shoulder as he might have done on that of a child, while a gentle but irrepressible smile stole over his features, \"what is deferred, re member, is not always hopeless. A little more patience and reflection, and believe me you might be a very good player, but you are too hasty ! \" \" Patience ! reflection ! bah, it is incon ceivable,\" exclaimed the Doctor, again springing up, stung at the expression of his opponent's face, and writhing anew at"], [12, "6 VERONIA. his defeat. \" It is utterly mysterious, and beyond my comprehension. I repeat it. Here have we two been playing on, night after night, without intermission during so many weeks, since I first taught you the moves \u2014 for you remember it was I who first brought these confounded wooden men under this roof \u2014 and since that unlucky hour, you have invariably won ; in fact, I have not once had the satisfaction of check mating you. You my pupil too ! bah ! it is not to be borne, it cannot go on, Cure ; we must give up chess, and try something else.\" \" With all my heart, Doctor ; what shall it be ? \" \" After all I am but a fool,\" observed the latter, under the impulse of a sudden re action, probably produced by this unquali fied submission on the part of his opponent, and with a sigh of infinite wofulness he sank again into his seat, and became reabsorbed in contemplation of the theatre of his dis grace. The rustling of a silk dress, followed by the entrance into the apartment where they"], [13, "VERONIA, 7 sat of a female figure, disturbed the Doc tor's cogitations. In the centre of its brick floor stood a person, whose appearance was very little in unison with its homeliness, and stiU less in keeping with the pale and subdued aspect of him who now turned to welcome her approach. The warm glow of sunset which flooded the parlour of the presbytery \u2014 resting brightly, as it did at that moment, upon the figure of the visitor and her host \u2014 disclosed more fully the contrast between them, lending temporary brightness to the priest's mild features, and throwing a deeper glow over the brilliant complexion and gaudy attire of the lady. The latter was the personifica tion of vulgar ease, contentment, and pre tention, had long passed the season of youth, and seemed, by the evidence of both dress and manner, to be in the possession of very soHd wordly advantages, and un encumbered with any superfluous refine ment Hkely to interfere with their enjoy ment. \" So, my dear sister, you are determined to leave me to-day ? It has been a short visit.\""], [14, "8 VERONIA. \"Yes, to-day I must positively leave you; my son is coming for me, and many things necessitate my departure ; first, that you will be fully occupied by the arrival of your new vicar, and secondly, that as Monsieur Bouchard writes me word I have also a visitor at home, and Justine^ is a very bad substitute during my absence ; but I will send her to you if agreeable.\" \" Thank you, my dear ; certainly I shall be happy to see her, \" said the Cure\", at the same time wincing slightly, either from the effect of the strong light now falling on his eyes, or at the proposal. \" That reminds me, Bertha, of a question I had intended to ask you. Did I not once hear you say that the vicar and his sisters, whom I am expecting, have lived near you ?\" \" Yes, they are well known to Julien ; who says that the women are exceedingly respectable and industrious. Of the young man himself, I know nothing ; but he ought to turn out well, since it appears that his sisters have sacrificed everything to his Seminary education, and worked hard to procure means for it.\""], [15, "9 VERONIA. \" Ah ! such examples are refreshing in this selfish world, I am glad to hear it,\" said the Cure, while a pleased expression stole over his features. \" Highly praiseworthy, certainly,\" assent ed the lady, in a tone of qualified approval ; \" but then you. know, brother, after all it was their interest, as one may say, for in their obscure class it is always an advantage to have a relation in the priesthood, and carries with it a certain amount of con sideration in the world, to which of course they were not insensible.\" The priest was silent ; he saw that sacri fice, unprompted by a selfish motive, was beyond his sister's powers of appreciation, and wisely forbore to contradict her. At length he said, \" Julien will be glad, I dare say, to find they are coming here ; but I suppose it was more particularly the vicar who was his companion ?\" \"Assuredly my son knows better than to make companions of those so greatly his inferiors ; he has been very condescending and good to them, I believe, but that is all,\" answered the lady warmly, with a look of"], [16, "10 VERONIA, angry wonder dilating her round black eyes. \" But, my dear Bertha, you surely forget,\" said the Cure\", \" that the most holy order of priesthood is the highest dignity that can be conferred on man, and that he who bears it is, in that character alone, the superior of every earthly prince and potentate. If Julien does not remember this, and should dare despise my vicar, let him not come hither, lest I should be tempted to remind him too severely of it.\" A glow of indignant feeling had made the pastor speak more warmly than his wont, for he was of a pacific nature, and on the ordinary occasions of Hfe \u2014 unless his sense of truth and justice were most keenly outraged \u2014 gentleness and courtesy ever characterised him ; they had been so now, however, and he little cared to hide it. Meanwhile, and during this discussion, the dejected chess-player, abandoning in disgust the contemplation of his defeated army, had placed himself listlessly at the casement, and had been there silently observ ing the movements of a number of crows,"], [17, "11 VERONIA. who were wont to assemble at certain periods around the steeple of the village church. The sacred edifice was situated at the extremity of a waste and rugged piece of ground, which lay between it and the Presbytery. To watch these crows (when he was, as now, under the influence of disappointment or sadness) was one of the Doctor Van Helder's special recreations. He seemed more effectually to overcome his mortification in listenino- to their solemn cawing, or in watching their dark flight ; but woe to any one who disturbed him while seeking this peculiar consolation, for then indeed his indignation kindled fiercely, and found vent often in bitter words. The rustling silk, unmodulated voice, and loftly airs of his friend's sister, produced now somewhat of the effect of oil on fire, upon his sensitive and irritable humour, excited too as it was by recent contradiction ; but, when to these were added her last speech, his wrath burst forth uncon trollably. \" Inferiors !\" uttered he, in a tone of bitter sarcasm, which (absorbed as they had"], [18, "12 VERONIA. thought him in his favourite pursuit) startled both his listeners not a little. \" I wonder what is the exact meaning of that word, and to see often by whom and to whom it is applied, would methinks make those crows themselves laugh, could they hear it.\" If Van Helder despised Madame Bou chard, she as cordially detested him, unable to understand the peculiar nature of which he was a type, and antagonistic, like all vulgar minds, as she was, to every evidence of character which could not be referred precisely to a certain standard of her own, or rather of the little world in which she lived ; but, even while despising the Doctor, she half feared him as a kind of savage, and he knew and exulted in it. Exasperated now, however, at this sudden attack, she turned upon him sharply to retort, saying : \u2014 \" It is easy enough, I should think, to see who are our superiors, and who are our inferiors in this world. People like this vicar's family, for instance, may be very devoted, and virtuous, and so forth, and"], [19, "VERONIA, 13 others (with a contemptuous glance at him) may be philanthropic, and all that sort of thing ; but nobody, I should imagine, would hold them to be the equals of Monsieur Bouchard's family, at least in this world.\" How far Van Helder might have been disposed to express a difference of opinion on so delicate a point, it is impossible to say, for another person \u2014 perhaps fortunately \u2014 interposed at this juncture. \" Supper is ready, and the soup served out. Now don't let it cool as you did last night, Meinheer Pastor,\" shrieked a wild voice, proceeding from an uncouth female figure, which suddenly thrust its head in at the doorway, directing what, to anyone unaccustomed to so much ugliness, would have seemed a menacing glance towards the Cure1. \"Coming, Godensca, \u2014 coming, my child,\" answered he, rising submissively, while his sister added significantly, shaking her head as the apparition vanished, \" That, Monsieur le Cure\", is one of the consequences of not drawing the"], [20, "14 VERONIA. line between superiors and inferiors. La mentable ! no subordination \u2014 no re spect !\""], [21, "15 CHAPTER II. \" The rank is but the guinea stamp, The man's the gowd for a' that.\" There has been given to the world in our days a theory, according to which the existence among us of a class of beings, living, so to speak, more particularly by their sensations than others, more keenly aHve to physical influences, and con sequently more irritably disposed, is clearly demonstrated, and these finer organizations have been classified under the suggestive name of \" Sensitives !\" We have doubtless aU remarked, says the learned enunciator of this system, that many things, which are to some men matters"], [22, "16 VERONIA. of perfect indifference, will often be to others the cause of acute uneasiness, border ing upon pain, and the experience of our readers may probably furnish them with some evidence in support of the observa tion. For ourselves, we have met with so many instances of the kind, as to be at no loss for an exemplification of our meaning, and among others may cite that of a gentleman, \u2014 in every other respect a person of nerve and firmness \u2014 whose self-possession utterly abandoned him at the sound of the sweet but melancholy tones of the Eolian harp ; and of another person on whom the mere mention of a domestic animal which he disliked, would take the same powerful effect, and produce the same symptoms of loathing and horror, as actual contact with some hated object might produce on any other person. Now, according to the philosopher re ferred to, these persons, so far from being \u2014 as might naturally be supposed \u2014 the victims of their own fancies, were only \" Sensitives,\" whose acute sensibilities on particular points,"], [23, "17 VERONIA. might perfectly have been accounted for by natural laws. Decidedly Jean Fortune' Van Helder must have belonged to this species, for, on this supposition only, could some of his pecuHarities have been explained. To those ignorant of such physiological mysteries, he would only have appeared to be one of those incomprehensible combinations of eccentricity and contradiction so ex pressively designated as \" Originals ;\" but by the initiated, he would assuredly have been recognized as a \" Sensitive \" of the \" Reichenbach \" school. Sympathetic to the highest degree, he was also, like all such persons, prone to strong antipathies ; when once possessed of such, his mind could scarcely ever again be freed from them, and these were often of a nature apparently most unfounded and childish. Such was the feeling with which he regarded the Cure's sister, Madame Bouchard. Democratic to the heart's core, he might yet have overlooked her upstart pride, the tyranny she was too apt to exercise in the vol. i. c"], [24, "18 VERONIA. priest's quiet dwelling, and the undisguised hostility she never failed to manifest towards himself, rather than one crowning atrocity, which in his opinion outweighed all the rest, and against which his senses revolted, and his blood boiled. Nearly two hours had elapsed since the scene we have just described. Evening, which had just closed in, found him under the shelter of his own roof, and lingering with a friend over the remains of supper at his own table, cogitating upon the same subject still; for in this offence, as usual, was merged the recollection of every other. \" I tell you, Henricart, that the Cure' is a perfect victim, a miserable victim, when that woman is there, with those flaming ribbons before his eyes, and that fearful rustling going on round him. I only wonder that he has not long since gone mad \u2014 I am all on edge with it still,\" and truly Van Helder shivered as he spoke. The person he addressed, who, seated opposite to him, was helping to discuss a bottle of wine which stood between them, was also vigorously contributing his aid"], [25, "19 VERONIA. towards increasing the already dense body of smoke which pervaded the chamber, and this circumstance, together with the fading light, rendered him but dimly visible. We wUl, however, describe this guest as he would have otherwise appeared. Jacques Henricart was a man past middle Hfe ; of broad, muscular build and hard outHnes. He had the brow, the keen eye, and the sharp nostril which mark a strong wiU and indomitable energies. The mouth \u2014 that surest index of the animal pro pensities \u2014 was hidden under bushy dark mustachios, but the secret there guarded was revealed by the stern jaw and deeply accentuated chin. Fierce passions, insati able desires, bitter disappointments had left their traces in the thinly-covered crown and temples, and the deep lines which age had not alone had time to dig. He wore the rough blouse of the country, and across his breast was strapped the leathern belt to which sportsmen attach the \" carnassiere,\" or game bag. As Van Helder spoke, his companion looked up, and a caustic smile, in which c2"], [26, "20 VERONIA. the eyes took no part, displayed a range of glittering and strongly-set teeth, which strongly corresponded with his other characteristics. \" She is certainly not pleasant, and I can quite understand, Doctor, that you do not like her ; neither do I.\" \" Oh ! it is not her ; I really don't believe it is so much herself, Jacques, as that sound, that constant rustling sound, and those ribbons.\" \" Ah ! yes, I see,\" said the guest, not however seeing at all, but willing to appear as if he did so, \" you think she should not wear such bright colours \u2014 I agree with you ; at her age it is ridiculous, considering too her figure.\" \" Pray talk of something else, my dear Jacques, do ; I really cannot bear it any longer, and to change the subject for a pleasant one, let us speak of the De MeTiuls. These are women indeed ! What a con trast ! \" \" Just so, and it is on their account in fact I came here, to ask the favour of you to present them with some game I shot"], [27, "21 VERONIA. to-day, if you think it worth offering ;\" and rising, the speaker took, from a corner where it lay beside his gun, a well-filled pouch, and drew from it a fine hare and a brace of birds. \"The hare is for you, Doctor, but the birds might, I think, please the ladies, if you were so very obliging as \u2014 \" \" To take them for you, Jacques,\" inter rupted Van Helder, \" but really, my dear fel low, I don't see why I am so often to do you this service, when you could just exactly as well do the same thing yourself \u2014 unless, indeed, you have any particular dislike to calling upon them.\" \" Oh ! no, I assure you ; nothing of the kind,\" replied the sportsman hurriedly, and bending as he spoke over the trophies of his skill, in such a manner as to avoid meet ing the unsuspicious glance directed towards him. \" Then why \u2014 may I ask again \u2014 not take them yourself? \" inquired the puzzled Doctor. \" I should be most happy, but they might not have equal pleasure in seeing me.\""], [28, "22 VERONIA. \" What, accept the gift, and repulse the giver ! you cannot think it of them for a moment,\" was his friend's warm rejoinder. \" Repulse is a hard word, and does not express my meaning,\" said Henricart, now meeting the Doctor's look. \" They are too good, too gentle, too polished, to be capable of a discourtesy, but that is the very reason I would not overstep the bounds of due respect towards them. It is not because they are probably great ladies, and I am an obscure artist \u2014 a man of the people \u2014 that I would observe the distance which society has placed between us, but because they are gracious and high-minded women in distress.\" \"You have the soul of a prince, Jacques Henricart,\" exclaimed the Doctor, enthusi astically striking his friend's brawny hand. \" I will answer for it, they 'would be glad to see you step over their threshold any day, and in proof of it, the last time I saw Mademoiselle de Mehul, she inquired whether they were never to have the oppor tunity of thanking you for all you have lately sent them.\""], [29, "23 VERONIA. \" Truly, I ask no better, and will do as you suggest, Doctor, if I may say you authorised it,\" answered the sportsman, with evident gratification. \" Well, for a Hercules of a fellow, a Mar seillais, and a child of the Revolution all in one, Jacques, you are passably timid,\" rejoined Van Helder, laughingly, but on observing the sudden contraction of his friends' brow, he added, soothingly: \"yet you are right in principle, and I honour you for it. The cloud cleared away, as Henricart slowly regained his seat ; a dreamy look passed into his keen eyes, his head drooped meditatively upon his breast, and he was silent. Some minutes passed thus, during which the Doctor, puffing away tranquilly at his pipe, did not break in on his companion's reverie, and when Henricart spoke again, his tones seemed softened by some-subduing thought. \" It is a hard fate,\" said he, \"for women reared, as they have evidently been in luxury, to be now living thus wretchedly,"], [30, "24 VERONIA. subjected to every privation. It is hard for the mother at her time of life, and with her broken health ; but harder still for the daughter, so young, so beautiful, and so admired, as she must have been. I have often wondered at the mystery that sur rounds them, but I feel certain that it can be nothing evil.\" \" Evil ! oh ! no,\" exclaimed the Doctor, energetically ; \" very sad, I fear, however.\" \" Sad, indeed, to have left such paleness on the young one's cheek, such sorrow in her eyes. Ill as Madame de M^hul looks, do you know, Van Helder, I fancy that the daughter bears traces of ever more acute suffering than her mother. Do you not think so ? \" \" Undoubtedly, but that is easily ex plained, for Veronia de Mehul is at an age when the passions are more tumultuous than at the period of life to which Madame de MeTiul has attained ; these may, and I should say have had some share in the daughter's soi*rows, beyond their common misfortunes.\" \" You think so ? \" inquired the artist,"], [31, "25 VERONIA. eagerly, and but for the twilight, his com panion must have noticed the sudden pallor that overspread his dark cheek ; \" you think perhaps that she has \u2014 loved?\" fal tered he, reluctantly, after a moment's pause. \" Well, very probably,\" was the reply, uttered in a tone whose philosophic coolness contrasted curiously with the questioner's evident and tremulous interest in the theme ; \" young people are so imagina tive, that a mere fancy affords them just as much material for substantial grieving as the most important reality would furnish us ; but dear me, we all have our troubles ; I have had my share, let me tell you, Jacques, before now.\" \" Indeed,\" answered Henricart, mechani cally, for his thoughts had wandered away into a chaos of speculation, awakened by the Doctor's surmise, and he was wondering what could be the history of the pale and beautiful Veronia's heart. \" Yes,\" continued Van Helder, not per ceiving his friend's abstraction, \"nobody ever had such a youth as mine, I do believe."], [32, "26 VERONIA. We lived in those days in a large damp house close to the church, and full of rats, as full as it could hold. Well, as if that wasn't enough of mortification, there were on one side, the church bells going ever lastingly, morning, noon, and night ; and on the other, there was my mother's voice, scold, scold, scold, the Hvelong day ; trying in fact to scold me into the Seminary oppo site ; but it wouldn't do, it was enough to harden a man's heart, and make him renounce Rome, the Pope, and the Cardinals, all at one stroke, which of course I did, and there they are all to this day associated in my mind with rats, church bells, and my mother's scolding voice. Ah ! don't talk of people being miserable about love affairs to a fellow who has gone through what I have done.\" \" Poor Doctor ! \" said Henricart, drawn from his reflections, and irresistibly amused by the serious and plaintive manner with which this sketch of miseries had been given, and once more the shades of evening served as a friendly screen by concealing from Van Helder a smile, which the latter, had he"], [33, "27 VERONIA. observed it, might long have remembered. \" So then, my dear Jacques, it is settled that you wiU yourself take this game to the De Mehul's, and I may announce your visit?\" \" Certainly,\" said the sportsman, rising to depart, and while re-adjusting his pouch, and shouldering his gun, he added, feel ingly, \" would to Heaven that I could do them some real good, or help to lighten their afflictions ; it is frightful to think of that delicate girl slaving to keep comfort and order in their miserable dwelling, and yet you say she contrives it ? \" \"Admirably, as you will judge for your self on going there ; no menial could better accomplish the rough tasks she had taken upon herself, or produce such neatness as is apparent in all around them ; be sure, Jacques, that whatever be her origin, she is one of Nature's true ladies, at least \u2014 gifted with the fine instinct to feel all the harmony that may lie in the perfect execution of even mean details like these. She is indeed a noble creature, and thank Heaven I have at last a plan for Hghtening her labours, which will, I have every hope, succeed.\""], [34, "28 VERONIA. \" The fates be propitious to it ! my heart bleeds for them as it is. Good night, Doc tor, pleasant dreams.\" \" Good night, Jacques, good night,\" and so they parted ; the philosophic Doctor to set in order his dwelling before retiring to rest, for, like a true original, he had, through some confirmed whim concerning the softer sex, accustomed himself to dis pense with their services, and constituted himself his own domestic ; and the sports man to return to his also lonely dweUing, at some distance across the country."], [35, "29 CHAPTER III. \" Deifica Professio ! \" Saint Ambroise. It would hardly have been easy, throughout the entire extent of Flanders (that land of famous kitchens), to have found one more worthy of delineation than that of the vicar's dweUing. Bright with morning sunshine and cleanliness, it looked the very picture of comfort, and proved that female powers of no mean order in the domestic art, had presided over its arrangements. The door left purposely open to admit the fresh air, looked out upon a long and well-stocked garden, in which the useful greatly preponderated over the beautiful. Flowers there were few \u2014 here and there a"], [36, "30 VERONIA. rose-bush, some hardy annuals, and a box shrub or two. The remaining space was all devoted to the solid and necessary. And this it is but fair to state was scarcely so much a matter of choice as of expediency, for on the supply to be derived from the ground attached to the house, depended very much the comfort of its inhabitants, a circumstance not to be wondered at, if it be taken into consideration that upon the vicar's scanty emoluments himself and two sisters had to subsist. It will therefore not seem surprising if, under such circum stances, vegetables were preferred to rose bushes. Deeply absorbed in the perusal of a volume in his hand, the master of the dwelling was walking gravely up and down his Httle garden, between the thickly-planted rows of cabbages and potatoes which lay on either side his path. The subject of his studies, was the sermon which he was that morning to deliver to his village congregation, the first that he had ever addressed to them, and, as the vicar did not number among his talents that of"], [37, "VERONIA. 31 extraordinary eloquence, it was not wonder ful, that his usually placid and smiling countenance should now be slightly over shadowed by anxiety. The custom of the country exacting ex temporary preaching, it was the somewhat difficult task of committing to memory the result of his meditations in which he was now engaged. As he was to celebrate mass also, and was therefore still fasting, he had preferred awaiting in the open air the conclusion of his sisters morning meal. The latter were seated at one end of the large kitchen table, on which was spread their repast, of which a massive, dark-coloured loaf, some fruit and milk, formed the chief materials, but the appetites of neither seemed inclined to do them justice on this occasion. The elder female's staid features wore an additional tinge of gravity, which the severe propriet}^ of her Sunday's attire served rather to enhance, while the fair, smooth face of the younger one, was often crossed by a look of unaccustomed earnestness, as her eyes followed the movements of her brother, and"], [38, "32 VERONIA. watched his footsteps ; but neither spoke, fearing to disturb him by a passing word. At length he closed his book, stopped for an instant as if to dwell finally on its con tents, made the sign of redemption rever entially over brow, lips, and heart, and then turned towards them. \" He is ready, Ana ! \" was the younger sister's half-breathless exclamation, hast ening as she spoke to meet him. The more sober Ana rose slowly, methodically putting away all traces of the meal, and was prepared with the priest's hat when he entered. Over the rest of their attire the sisters then drew the customary black cloak of their countrywomen (that pictur esque relic of the mantilla), and the three then set off for church, the priest, however, preceding them by a few yards. At the porch of the sacred edifice he dis appeared through a side door leading into the Sacristy, and the two women mingled with the congregation who were beginning to assemble. Glances of interest and curi osity met them as they passed modestly along; but these they saw not, for the"], [39, "33 VERONIA. moment, so sweet, yet anxious, to which for so long a time every sacrifice and labour had tended, was before them, and they felt and remembered nothing else. At the shrine of \" Our Lady \" the step of Ana faltered, and instead of proceeding onward to her place, she stopped and sank upon her knees; her sister did likewise, and for some moments they remained there, united in the same thought. Like a mother had the pious Ana prayed, watched over, and striven for her young brother, and as a mother did she now offer up the thanksgiving of a grateful heart that the object of her ambition was attained. When he appeared at the foot of the altar, the vicar had lost none of his quiet con fidence, and though fuUy alive to the solemnity of the duty he came there to perform, yet he was not of that impression able nature, which yields easily to emotion ; nor was it until he had mounted the steps of the pulpit, that he showed any evidence of agitation. Then, however, the slight pallor which overspread his countenance, and the tremor VOL. I. D"], [40, "34 VERONIA. of his voice, sent a sympathetic thrill through the affectionate hearts that beat for him below. Ana's thin, faded cheek, was for one brief moment crimsoned, and then became more sallow than before, while the tenderer Beth's eyes grew strangely dim, and at length overflowed. A large fly disporting himself in one of the casements, and the rustling of a young tree that grew beside the church porch, and was waving in the morning breeze, were the only sounds that met the ear, as the text was given out ; so attentive were the assembled listeners. \" The good shep herd giveth his life for the sheep,\" were the words selected for the text, and although, at first commencing, the natural timidity of a young and inexperienced speaker rendered him rather nervous, yet soon the genuine simplicity of the vicar's character triumphed, and he forgot himself, to think only of those whom he addressed. And this in fact is the chief secret of success ; for what is the cause of more than half the stumbling and defective oratory which, whether from pulpit or platform, is"], [41, "35 VERONIA. every day inflicted on society, but a diseased, and overweening notion of his own im portance on the part of the orator? This breeds in him the unhappy delusion that he himself is everything, \u2014 his hearers nothing. With very few exceptions it may said that when a speaker loses his self-possession, becomes confused, wandering, and em barrassed, the reason of this embarrassment is simply that he has aUowed the impression which he wishes to produce, to be the uppermost object in his thoughts, and is in this most justly punished, by forfeiting the attention he might otherwise have obtained. The vicar was too sensible to be ignorant of this fact, and when he felt a certain bashfulness gaining upon him, he resolved to forget himself, and think only of his congregation ; but the subject he had chosen rendered this task a less easy one than com mon, for it was of himself he had to speak. He, to whom had been entrusted the care of the eternal interests of the flock, was, he told them, the representative on earth of that heavenly Shepherd, who d 2"], [42, "36 VERONIA. watched over them from above. He it was, who, inspired by the Church, was appointed to be their guide into the paths of everlasting peace, their defender amid the snares and perils of their spiritual life on earth ; set apart from secular interests, and consecrated to the work, the life of the priest had been snatched from the world, that it might belong more entirely to them. Had any gone astray, his was the sacred task of leading them back to God ; were any sorrowful, his task it was to soothe their grief; were any ill, to him belonged the care of bringing hope to their sick-beds, and hallowing their hour of death ! Contagion, distance, or the strife of elements, all that weakens other ties, were to be to him as nothing. For their sakes he must brave aU terrors, face all dangers, endure all pains ; happy, and more than repaid, could he win some souls to the knowledge and love of that good Shepherd who had suffered and died for all. Truly and simply did each word seem, as he uttered it, to come straight from the preacher's heart, and thus it was that it"], [43, "37 VERONIA. reached the hearts of his listeners, and there found entrance. The sisters' trembling anxiety had given place to a proud happiness at the attentive silence with with their brother's discourse had been received, nor was the measure of their honest pride left incomplete. A pale benignant countenance, on which rested recent traces of pain and sickness, had been long turned earnestly towards the preacher. A shade covered the eyes, and partially con cealed the upper portion of his face ; but the baU smile of pleasure on the lip, the attentive attitude of the figure and uplifted head, were too expressive to be mistaken ; and the language which they spoke was the crowning triumph of two simple hearts, which had beat not a little tremulously, in suspense as to what might be the verdict of their Cure\\"], [44, "38 CHAPTER IV. \" Thou speakest truly, poet 1 and methinks More hearts are breaking in this world of ours, Than one would say.

At the period of which we write, however, no"], [46, "40 VERONIA. such cloud hung over the village; sun shine and gladness rested upon it, for sum mer, beautiful summer, was in the fulness of her reign. On the morning which succeeded the vicar's sermon, his sister Beth was leaning thoughtfully against the gate at the end of their garden, occupied with her knitting, whilst her mind was so deeply absorbed in pleasing retrospect of that event of the pre ceding day which had been the greatest one in her calm life, that the sound of approach ing footsteps fell unheeded upon her ear, until they stopped beside her, and a voice called her by name. She looked up and beheld the Doctor Jean Fortune Van Helder. The young girl had already met him at the Presbytery, and had, moreover, heard that he was the Curd's friend and constant visitor ; consequently, although he was very unlike any specimen of his sex with which her Hmited experience of the world had yet furnished her, Beth felt disposed to regard him with respect and confidence, and welcomed him accordingly."], [47, "41 VERONIA. Declining an invitation to enter the house, Van Helder rested his arm upon the wooden barrier that separated them, and remained for some minutes buried in re flection, while his eager glance surveyed the countenance of his companion, as if there lay the solution of some problem that per plexed him. Surprised at the look \u2014 which, however, was not of a nature to offend her \u2014 Beth's eye sank timidly beneath it, while she remained silent. 'Finding, however, that the visitor seemed equally disinclined to speak, she at length did so. \"If Meinheer has business with my brother he will not have very long to wait, but Karel is unfortunately out just now.\" \" I am very glad to hear it, as it shows that our vicar has set to work in earnest,\" replied the Doctor ; \" but it is not with him I wish to speak, but with yourself, Fraulein Beth. I have selected you for an express mission \u2014 wiU you undertake it ? \" \" Indeed, Meinheer ! \" said Beth, in great surprise, \"would not my sister Ana do better ? Her heart is full of charity, if it is"], [48, "42 VERONIA. a work of that sort you want done, and \u2014 \" lowering her voice, she 'added seriously \u2014 \"Ana is a hundred times more kindly than she looks, believe me.\" \" I have no doubt whatever of her good ness,\" replied Van Helder, smiling, \"but she is not the person I want to-day, although, as you have guessed, it is for a very particular work of charity; but the fact is, good Fraulein, that your youth and cheerful face -render you best suited to the case.\" \" I am ready, Meinheer,\" replied she, de liberately rolling up her stocking upon its needles, for she read in his eager face that it was the immediate fulfilment of his wish he was about to claim, \" what do you require me to do ? \" \" To accompany me to a dwelling where are both sickness and sorrow, but which the priest and the sister of charity may not enter.\" \" Jesu-Maria! \" was the young girl's in voluntary cry, as, starting back, her fresh cheek lost something of its colour, and her lips trembled. Van Helder saw these symp-"], [49, "43 VERONIA. toms of alarm, and hastened to reassure her. \" I am sorry to have shocked you, my child,\" said he, soothingly, \" but you have no cause for fear. On anything worse than sickness and poverty, you may rest assured I would not ask one so young to look. No, Fraulein Beth, those in whose behalf I ask your kindness are strangers, that is their misfortune ; they are poor, that is their only crime.\" He spoke warmly, with his strange pale eyes kindling in a manner which no one ever saw unmoved, and, half ashamed of the doubt she had betrayed, Beth hesitated no longer ; but her Flemish nature prompted no expression of her feelings in words, so she turned silently away to prepare for the excursion. Van Helder watched her with a disturbed air, as she walked up the garden path, striking at the same time his walking stick into the ground, and rooting fiercely at a poor buttercup which lay at his feet, as he muttered some inaudible words. He was annoyed, not so much at her first involuntary movement as at the silence which"], [50, "44 VERONIA. accompanied her acquiescence ; it both vexed and puzzled him. When he again looked up, a figure was approaching from the direction of the vil lage ; it was the vicar, who hastened his step on perceiving the visitor at his dwell ing. The young man looked heated and fatigued \u2014 his hat thrust beneath his arm, his brow bathed in moisture, and his priestly garments discoloured with dust ; but there was a glow of satisfaction on his homely features, and a gleam of good-humour in his eye, which touched pleasantly upon the sympathies of the philanthropist, as their hands met in a cordial salutation. \" I may as well make full confession, as I am caught in the fact,\" said the Doctor, from whose brow all traces of vexation now cleared away, \" I am running away with your youngest sister, Mr. Vicar, have I your permission ? \" \" Certainly, Meinheer ; but may I inquire where you are going to take her ? \" \" Ah ! you too cannot quite trust me,\" was the smiling rejoinder ; \" has the Curd then given you no hint of a mission or"], [51, "45 VERONIA. which her services were required, and for which he thought I might seek them ? \" \"Yes, but I had in truth forgotten it. To visit some aliens to the faith, I think he said ; if so, do not let me detain you, pray, Meinheer, and may God speed your efforts ! \" Beth had, meanwhile, joined them, and stood modestly wrapped in her black cloak, awaiting the signal to depart, which was promptly given, for Van Helder would have felt puzzled how to answer the priest's last words. He was too thoroughly honest even tacitly to accept a commendation not his due, and he was aware that the merely temporal good which he meditated would scarcely have drawn it forth. \"Your brother imputes to me a more spiritual motive than that by which I am actuated,\" said the doctor to his companion, after they had proceeded some little distance in an uneasy silence ; \" it is not the spirit of proselytism, but that of simple charity which impels me, that charity which is equally the due of every human being, be their creed or calling what it may.\" Although she could scarcely disclaim"], [52, "46 VERONIA. participation in it, there was something in this sentiment which jarred a little upon the timid orthodoxy of Beth ; but as, after a moment's reflection, she found nothing in it that admitted of positive dispute, she ven tured merely to ask what faith the persons alluded to professed. \" I am really not learned enough on the subject of creeds and their ramifications to designate the particular sect to which they belong, but they are certainly Protestants of some sort,\" answered the Doctor, care lessly. Born and educated among a people who hold to their religion with something of the same fervour that other nations invest in political or patriotic feeling, the young Flemish girl had learnt to think a Protest ant not a whit removed in infidelity from a Jew ! Were they not even worse than that benighted nation, in having a second time rejected the Saviour in the person of his sacred spouse, the Church? This was the question Beth asked herself, and unable to solve it, her voice trembled with a new emotion, when she again spoke."], [53, "47 VERONIA. \" Are you quite sure, Meinheer,\" said she, timidly, \" that the unbelieving are equally deserving with the faithful ? I cannot feel certain, but \" \" You almost think not, I perceive ; so that if, in fact, I lay dying in yonder ditch, because I don't happen to hear mass quite as often as yourself, Fraulein Beth, you would think twice before admitting that it was expedient to pick me out : thank you ! \" \" Oh ! no, indeed, Meinheer, not you ! \" exclaimed the now frightened Beth, for the glow that had overspread the Doctor's coun tenance and passed into his eyes was fierce and angry, but it died away again as sud denly as it had come, and changed to a look of sadness. \"Child, child! beware of putting limits to your mercy, or deciding who has, and who has not, a claim upon it, See how Heaven's sunshine falls on all alike ; can it teach you no lesson of leniency, at least ?

But I am wrong in supposing you could be inclined to indul gence towards those of whom you know only the one fact of their professing an ob noxious creed; let me tell you something of their story, and then, Fraulein Beth, you will pity them, I am sure. Madame de MeJiul is a widow. She lives alone with her daughter in the very humble dwelling you see yonder, and has been longer a suf ferer from the fever which, you know, often rages here in the autumn, and which her natural frailty of constitution, combined with the circumstance of unaccustomed privations, has rendered her powerless to resist, This lady and her daughter have been rich, courted by the world, prosperous, and happy ; now, ruined and forgotten, their lives wear away in comparative want and sorrow. A year since the mother's sickness would have yielded without diffi culty to care and medicine, but then I did not know of their position, which, indeed, they kept proudly hidden from all. Now it is too late \u2014 it is only in my power some what to soften her sufferings, to cheer her"], [55, "49 VERONIA. downward path, until that day \u2014 fast ap proaching \u2014 when her daughter, Veronia, will be left to bear the burden of life alone ! \" \" Poor things ! \" burst from the lips of Beth, in tones of genuine pity. Brief and common as was the story, it had reached her heart. She forgot, at once, the heresy of them who formed the subject of it, to re member only their sorrows, and walking onward, though in silence, side by side, the heart of the Doctor and that of his com panion now beat in unison. At the extremity of the Dunes,* and in a hollow, save on that side which looked towards the sea by a ridge of sand-hills, ap peared a solitary dwelling, bearing rather more resemblance to a fisherman's hut than to an ordinary dweUing. The door stood open, admitting the fresh breeze from the water, but on reaching it the Doctor knocked gently before crossing the thresh hold. A voice from within gave the sig nal to enter, and beckoning to his compa- * The sandy tract of country which skirts those shores, is so designated. VOL. I. E"], [56, "50 VERONIA. nion to follow him, he went in. Beth stood for a moment hesitating, partly in timidity, partly in surprise. A flood of sunlight, which streamed across the chamber that lay before them, revealing its utter bareness, enclosed in its brightness a figure seated in the midst of it, and fell more faintly over a pale and shadowy form lying upon a couch at some distance. Beth's eyes, after this first glance, turned from the latter, back to the centre figure, and her attention remained riveted upon it. Pale, sorrowful, austere, as she looked, the light which rested upon Veronia brought into stronger contrast her aspect of mourn ing. Her features were wan and rigid, and their utter colourlessness lent a darker hue to the thick tresses which overshadowed them, and whose glossy lustre seemed, at a superficial glance, almost the only evidence of youth which she possessed. Her dress, plain to severity, did not, how ever, abstract from the native elegence of a person whose every line spoke eloquently of high descent and noble breeding. Nun-like"], [57, "VERONIA. 51 as were the hue and texture of her robe, there was an unstudied dignity in the wearer that surprised and half abashed the homely visitor. Beth felt, as she would have expressed it, that she was in the pre sence of a \" great lady ; \" and unable in her simplicity to reconcile this fact with that of the excessive roughness of the dwelling, she was, and doubtless looked, bewildered. The young lady, whose glance had been, meantime, directed towards the stranger, now rose, and turned towards Van Helder, who had been silently watching them both. The fascination which had riveted Beth's faculties seemed no longer to enchain them when MademoiseUe de Mehul looked away, and she then, for the first time, per ceived a large frame, on which was stretched a gorgeous piece of embroidery, on which the lady had been apparently engaged. A cry of admiration escaped her, at the beauty of the garlanded flowers, of every tint and kind, assembled on it, and another of asto nishment at discovering that they were but silken copies of reality. \" It is not often, Fraulein Beth, that you e 2"], [58, "52 VERONIA. see such work, ay ? \" said Van Helder, smilingly ; but the smile faded, and an air of constraint replaced it after a temporary glance towards Veronia, whose aspect be trayed the most painful agitation. Her lips quivered, a deep flush passed over her countenance, leaving it almost instantly whiter, if possible, than before ; and her large dark eyes flashed and dilated, as she turned them upon the poor philanthro pist. \" You are annoyed, Veronia, \u2014 forgive me ! \" urged he, humbly, advancing a step towards her, and speaking in answer to her look. \" Forgive me for taking you thus by surprise, but I knew it was the only way of attaining any object in which your welfare is concerned. Approach, Fraulein, and tell this lady that you only came with the thought of being useful to her.\" \" And if I want no services, what then ? \" asked the young lady, haughtily, without deigning to look again towards the timid intruder. \" Have I not told you often, Doctor Van Helder, that I can dispense with aid and fellowship, nay, that they are"], [59, "53 VERONIA. distressing to my mother and myself, and yet you inflict upon me the task of thus formally rejecting them ; \" and the tone of softened reproach in which she ended, went to Beth's good-natured heart. \" Mademoiselle,\" said she, forgetting her timidity, \"how can a lady like you do without help, and with sickness too in your dwell ing? Let me come sometimes and assist you, I shall be only too glad.\" Again the red glow burnt upon Veronia's brow, and this time it faded not so fast, but that the applicant had time to see, to her surprise, what she had not observed before, that when she blushed thus, the lady became beautiful. A glance of feudal haughtiness shot once more from her eyes as, turning to poor Beth, she froze her with a cold and stern refusal. \" Veronia ! Veronia ! for your mother's sake,\" pleaded the Doctor, in a really piteous accent ; \" remember how you have both suffered already from this pride ; think of the long winter nights before you, and what she must suffer if you thus repulse all sympathy, for will your own exertions"], [60, "54 VERONIA. suffice to her necessities, and if they should not, to what needless misery do you expose her?\" \"Not needless, cruel Doctor!\" And the placid Beth observed with astonishment the trembling voice and tearful eyes which suddenly replaced the ' sternness of the previous instant in this impulsive nature. \" Why urge what is beyond my power ? am I not poor ? can I afford to purchase, to pay for services ?\" Then, turning suddenly to Beth, she exclaimed passionately, \" Since even this last humiliation is required of me, learn that I labour for my bread !\" \" Child !\" cried the now provoked Van Helder, as, overcome at the confession she had just made, Mademoiselle de Mehul sank pale and trembling into her chair, \" would not any one suppose, to hear you, that to labour for their bread was the last degree of degradation to which a human being could fall, instead of being the most honourable of all conditions? How can a gifted mind like yours be guilty of such folly ?\" She was silent, while more than ever"], [61, "VERONIA. 55 mystified. Beth imitated her example, and the Doctor continued : \" I know not the creed that you profess, Veronia ; but this young girl is the adherent of a faith which has sanctified the exercise of poverty, and made it holy ; to her, therefore, the absence of worldly goods cannot seem shameful, or the struggle \u2014 even in those not born to it \u2014 for independence a disgrace. She knows that you were once rich and honoured ; why blush that she should learn that, though rich no longer, you are now more worthy of honour than before ?\" \"Veronia, my child, who is that stranger?\" said a feeble voice from the couch, as the form that had reclined there emerged from its piUows, and turned in the direction of the group ; and looking round Beth beheld a faded, elderly, and very emaciated woman gazing anxiously at her. Shy as she could not but feel towards the daughter, the suffer ing aspect of the mother fiUed her with unmixed compassion, and at a slight gesture from Van Helder, she rose and approached the latter. The Doctor, meanwhile, stepped to"], [62, "56 VERONIA Veronia's side, and bending over her, spoke long and earnestly upon the project next his heart. He painted in far softer colours than he conceived them, the trials that awaited her should her strength fail beneath her self-imposed task; but in pity con cealed the fact of how rapidly the fever stricken mother was sinking to the grave ; yet the conviction lent a deeper gravity to his words and manner than he was himself aware, and impressed by it, Mademoiselle de M eh id's proud spirit yielded to his entreaties, and before he left her roof a pact, if not of friendship, of at least kind feeling, was made between the two young women. Touched by the sympathy in Beth's honest face, Veronia half forgot the momentary morti fication of which she had been the cause, whde subdued bv an irresistible charm which in her gentler moments belonged to Mademoiselle de Mehul, and filled with genuine pity for her misfortunes, the vicar's little sister remembered the vexed subject of her heresy no longer."], [63, "57 CHAPTER V \" Honi soit qui mal y pense !\" But it is time slightly further to par ticularise the spot where these scenes were passing, lest a word in our last chapter may have misled the reader concerning its locality, and induced him to believe that the writer aimed at presenting him with a purely Dutch picture, which is not precisely the case. Along the coast of North West Flanders, between the existing French and Dutch frontiers, lies the obscure village which forms the theatre of our story, and which we shall distinguish by the name cf St. Andrew's. To point it out more distinctly"], [64, "58 VERONIA. to notice is not our intention, for many and good reasons, which to the reader of delicacy will need no explanation ; suffice it to say that, with regard to beauty, fertility, or salubrity, it forms no exception to the surrounding country ; and all of praise which it is possible to accord it, is more justly due to its moral than to its physical endow ments. It was the Sunday following that on which the vicar's first appearance had been made. The services of Vespers and Benediction were over, and the congregation were dispersing with the half-serious, half-smiling placidity pecuUar to themselves. Perhaps few things are better calculated to afford insight into the character of a people than their manner of entering and departing from their different places of worship. The Anglo-Saxon's solemn step and demure countenance ; the Frenchmen's often flippant air and smiling lip; the Spaniard's reverental kiss upon the hand with which he has just signed the symbol"], [65, "VERONIA. 59 of his faith ; each and all of these, like the good Fleming's serene devotion, speaks un mistakably of the spirit which severally prompts them. Foremost among a group of sable-hooded matrons strode on the Curd's maid, Go densca, her gaunt form draped in the long folds of black cloth which formed her mantle, and the severe sharpness of her step distinguishing her from aU around, as much, perhaps, as the profound awe in which they held her. The priest's dwelling was situated at the end of the churchyard, and across a piece of waste ground which served apparently no earthly use, and had a most desolate appearance, so that when, on reaching her master's house, the hand-maiden drew from her vast pocket a huge key, thrust it violently into the lock, and pushing open the door, disclosed to view a long stone passage, exquisitely spotless, and beyond this a glimpse of pleasant garden filled with rose and currant bushes, the eye gladly rested upon them. Leaving the door open behind her, in"], [66, "60 VERONIA. expectation of the Curd's return, Godensca marched down the passage until, reaching its extremity, she stood for a moment attentively looking into the garden, with an impatient expression upon her harsh features, and then, with a toss of the head, and the words, \" a nice pair,\" she turned away, and plunged into her own regions. The objects of this criticism, having at the moment their backs turned from the dwelling, had not perceived her, but were sauntering slowly down between the rows of currant-bushes, both seemingly absorbed in reflection of a serious nature, to judge by their measured steps and contemplative air. On reaching a hedge which marked the boundary of the domain, they turned, and disclosed to view the countenance of Van Helder, and, following closely at his heels, the no less expressive one of his companion, a black terrier belonging to the Curd, but which, having been formerly the Doctor's property, had ever remained faithful in affection to him. Finding the house locked, Van Helder"], [67, "VERONIA. 61 had, as usual on such occasions, stepped over the hedge just alluded to, there to await his friends' return from the church. While thus employed, we will take the opportunity of saying a few words concern ing him, with which, if the reader feels disposed further to pursue his history, it is necessary he should become acquainted. Jean Fortune Van Helder's family, on his father's side, were \u2014 as their name sufficiently indicates \u2014 of Dutch origin, and proudly asserted that three centuries had seen them denizens of Amsterdam, and not the least respected of its merchants. But as the wheel of fortune is ever in rotation, that which these centuries of industry \u2014 blessed by the fair smile of the goddess \u2014 had brought to the ascendant, suddenly, in one brief day declined, and, despite his auspicious name, Jean Fortune's early days had been overshadowed by the utter ruin of his house and prospects. Tempted by the passion \u2014 perhaps the Dutchman's only one, but undoubtedly his strongest \u2014 of gain, his father had long, in"], [68, "62 VERONIA. common with many of his countrymen, indulged in the secret traffic with England, so severely prohibited by Napoleon Buona parte, until intoxicated by success, and em boldned by impunity, he had risked in one venture his entire fortune. Betrayed by an accomplice, he had seen with agony the wreck of his hopes and the reprobation of his name. The blow was too keen even for the phlegmatic Dutchman, and in removing to another city his bereaved widow and son had left his ashes in Amster dam. On her husband's death, Madame Van Helder had returned to her birth-place, Bruges, which was, however, only the adopted residence of her family, who were French subjects, but had left their own land for motives which it is needless here to detail. Jean Fortund's youth had there fore been passed in this city, which he had thus learnt to consider as his own, and under the fond but rather conflicting governance of his mother and maternal grandfather. To the memory of the former \u2014 in the"], [69, "VERONIA. 63 conversation with Jacques Henricart which we have related in another chapter \u2014 he had omitted to do justice, for a more devoted parent, or a better woman, it would have been difficult to find ; but even his convic tion of her intrinsic virtues had ever failed to redeem in her son's eyes the one un pardonable quaHty to which he had aUuded. In a word \u2014 which we must borrow from the expressive language of her father \u2014 Madame Van Helder had been a devote. To see her son a candidate for the priest hood had been the daily aspiration of her Hfe ; the hope of its realization more than consolation for the loss of all worldly goods ; and, with the blindness of all earthly pas sion (for such it really was), she drove headlong towards her aim, regardless of all obstacles, unswerving before all resistance. Nor were these wanting on Van Helder's part, for, disgusted at a discipline too sharp for his sensitive nature, and too uncompro mising for his pecuUar turn of mind, he had ended by conceiving the most profound horror of that faith, the interpretation of"], [70, "64 VERONIA. which had been penance to his youth, and threatened to overshadow his manhood, until at last, disgusted, bewildered, and wearied, he had rebelled. Long and severe had been the struggle between mother and son, so severe, in fact, as to destroy in Jean's heart all filial tender ness, and awaken in its stead all the deep animosity of the oppressed towards the oppressor. Never would he be a priest, should every other career be shut for ever to him ; and never, when once emancipated from maternal tyranny, would he have aught to do with that religion by which his early days had been embittered. These were the two secret determinations of his soul, and to both had he remained faithful. Yet, as our most passionately cherished plans must ever succumb beneath the cruel force of circumstances when these run counter to them, so probably would have done those of the young martyr, had not an ally existed, able and willing to bring triumph to his cause. Madame Van Helder's father (with whom"], [71, "65 VERONIA. she had sought refuge on her husband's death) was a true Frenchman of the philo sophic school. But as he was a man of the world also, he had never interfered with the education of his children on those points of faith and morals concerning which his wife's views had differed from his own. Thus his daughter had imbibed the devout principles of her mother, to which her own ascetic tastes had added a still further tincture of austerity. Between the extreme opinions of these relations, Van Helder's mind had long oscil lated. His naturally soft heart, warm imagination, and impulsive nature, aided by the potent influence of first associations, had kindled early to a glow of religious enthu siasm, which would probably have led him to the desired point, but for the indiscrete zeal which pressed so sharply on him. But though his heart was tender, it was pas sionate also ; and his ardent spirit, thirst ing for deeds of sacrifice, eager even to seek the martyr's crown, revolted at the constant surveillance which sought to question his very thoughts, and rigidly exact the per- VOL. I. f"], [72, "66 VERONIA. formance of every supererogatory duty. As a child it had sickened and repulsed him ; as a youth it angered, and ended by rousing the evil passions of his breast. And then, as ever, the tempter was at hand. \" Poor child ! we have all passed by there,\" would the sarcastic Frenchman say. \" Fables, Jean ! fables, my dear boy, which they make us swallow in our infancy, but which every man of sense and spirit rejects later, when the choice of good or evil, liberty or bondage, is set before him. Courage, my little Jean, courage, read and judge for yourself, and they will never make a priest of you, I'll answer for it.\" And read for himself the youth accordingly did, and with what result the cunning philosopher had perfectly foreseen, for it was the authors of his own school only whose works filled the library shelves of the old man, and from the perusal of them, Jean Fortune arose the intoxicated disciple of \" liberty,\" as those bright spirits under stood it. Proportionate to the Free-thinker's re joicing at what he called the emancipation"], [73, "67 VERONIA. of his grandson, had been the mother's sorrow. Over her grieved spirit, then, and then only, came the full realization of her late misfortunes, of the death and ruin that had visited their house, with all the fatal con sequences to her son's future destiny they had entailed. She saw how every other career was apparently closed to him for ever, and the blow fell with double force and meaning. \" My son,\" would she often say, \"some day you will repent having slighted a mother's prayer; God never blesses the disobedient child, and He best knows it was your happiness I sought.\" And this was true ; but, alas ! like many another Christian, her zeal had not been tempered with discretion ; heavy was the price she paid for having dared to cast her erring mortal judgment into the scale. Alienation from the being whom she loved best on earth, and later, a lonely deathbed, disturbed by the constant vision of his reprobation. Nor must we say, in justice to him, had these things faUen Hghtly on Van Helder's e 2"], [74, "68 VERONIA. heart. Long after the grave had closed over her would the recollection of her mild caresses, in the days of his early childhood, ere the bitterness of conflicting interests had arisen between them, come back sadly to his mind, bringing with it a remorseful feel ing which showed that aU on that score was not at peace within. \"God never blesses the disobedient child ! \" would memory repeat to him ; and although he tried to silence her whisper, as that of superstition, it is certain that, under the restless influence awakened by it, had been committed some of the most wild, and, to the world who witnessed them, most inex plicable actions of his youth. It was very shortly after Madame Van Helder's death \u2014 which had been, in fact, ac celerated by these circumstances \u2014 that Jean Fortune's true vocation declared itself, de veloped probably by the pecuUar course of study upon which, in pursuance of his grandfather's wishes, he had then entered. A life of Marat, which he had perused with enthusiasm\u2014 shewing how were blended in one man the passion for freedom, with that"], [75, "69 VERONIA. of scientific research, awoke in his brain a kindred emulation. Of liberty, as the phUosophers defined it, he was enamoured already ; why should he not become so equally of science ? Thus did this mind become launched upon the ocean of speculation and, so had Van Helder become a follower of Esculapius. Years went on, and brought with them the death of his grandfather, and Van Hel der's own settlement in life, as much, at least, as could be hoped from such a nature. But as discretion is the better part of valour, so is tact the better part of talent ; and his total deficiency in the former, out weighed with a thoughtless public his pos session of the latter quality. He was not popular because he was too genuinely true. \"My good sir,\" would he bluntly say, when caUed in to assuage the sufferings of some gouty glutton, \"had you been tem perate, you would not now be ill; take warning for the future, and abstain.\" What could be hoped for such a monitor,"], [76, "70 VERONIA. but that outraged society should turn against him as it did. Though still young, the lesson was not lost upon him. He understood his case immediately. \" The world will not take the wholesome pill of truth, unless it is silvered over ; such work is neither to my taste, nor in my power; what then but that the world and I must part, and if it feels the separation no more than I, why, we are quits ! \" Some such thoughts as these had formed the turning-point in his existence. Like most originals, Van Helder had ever held aloof from intimate association with mankind; Too genuine himself for the ex igencies of society, he had the fatal gift of penetrating beneath its varnished surface, and reading the natural character of those with whom he came in contact, with some thing of that sagacity which the animal species display under similar circumstances, and which human wisdom had defined as instinct. Be this as it may, the Doctor's faculty resembled it in this respect. He needed not"], [77, "71 VERONIA. to raise his eyes towards a fellow-being \u2014 scarcely to hear them speak ; to breath for some brief seconds the same air, to listen to their step or movement, sufficed to him. There, by some wonderful intuition, he gathered instantly a world of secret indica tions respecting them, which, strange as it may seem, time and experience never failed to verify. It may be asked by those who are suffi ciently philosophical to admit the possi bility of this psychological phenomenon, how such a man could lack the common savoir vivre necessary for even the most ordinary professional success? And to this, paradox ical as it may appear, we must reply, that it is precisely beings like Van Helder who are most deficient in the latter quality. A little reflection will explain why. It is very evident that the mysterious gift alluded to springs from no exercise of the reasoning or purely mental faculties, while it is equally certain that the worldly wisdom for which our Gallic neighbours have so expressive a term, is nothing else than the application of these powers."], [78, "72 VERONIA. But it is time that we should draw the history of Van Helder's past life to a close, lest the reader's patience should refuse to accompany us further. We have said, then, that he was of un social habits ; yet one friendship the Doctor had contracted in his youth, and to this one he had ever remained faithful. At the Lyceum, where his early education had been conducted, was a boy some few years his senior, with whom a similarity of trials had strongly united him by sym pathy. Like himself was this poor youth the victim of a parent's persecutions on the sub ject of vocation. While every desire of his heart tended to a renunciation of the world's pleasures, and the humble life of religion, he had to endure the repetition of unceas ing arguments against the career of his choice, until, wearied and despairing, he had been on the point of yielding, when death intervening carried off the persecutor, and left him free to follow his own path. Many an hour of recreation had been spent by the two sufferers in comparing"], [79, "73 VFRONIA. their mutual afflictions; and the serious communion thus engendered had drawn together these youthful hearts too closely for later circumstances to have any power of disuniting them, although so different was the aim of each of their lives. Paul Alost, pitied the ardent mind thus early torn by dissension, and plunged into what his religious convictions made him consider a gulph of fatal error and con fusion : he therefore used all the fervour of his eloquence to restore it to the paths of peace ; and Van Helder, though deaf to his exhortations, and triumphing in the belief of superior knowledge and wisdom, yet felt the influence of his companion's purer and less passionate nature, and yielded to its charm. So it came about that when, some years later, disgusted with the world, he decided on quitting it for some calm retreat where he could indulge his taste for study and simplicity, uncriticized and uncon demned, his thoughts turned towards the quiet spot of which his friend had been for some years the parish priest, and thus had he become a member of the little com-"], [80, "74 VERONIA. munity which we have attempted to de scribe. We left Van Helder at the commence ment of this chapter pacing the narrow limits of the pastor's garden, and he had just again reached the hedge at its ex tremity, when the sound of the church bell giving out the \" Angelus,\" announced that the service had concluded. This aroused him from the thoughtful mood into which unconsciously he had fallen. He started at the sound, and as he looked up suddenly, the worn and saddened look which charac terised his features in repose, gave place to the usual glitter of his restless eyes and the habitual mocking curl of the lip. \" All over for the day ; we may frisk now, my boy,\" said he, looking down at the terrier, and disturbing its equilibrium by a gentle kick, which threw the animal on its side, at the distance of some paces. The dog sprang up with a sharp, eager bark, ex pressive of delight, and while Van Helder continued to excite it by voice and gesture, commenced a series of canine gambols, ac companied by vocal demonstrations of the"], [81, "75 VERONIA. same kind, which soon brought Godensca to the door. \" Limb of the evil one ! \" cried she, in angry tones, \"it is like you to howl at the blessed Angelus in that way ; and you, Van Helder, ain't you worse than he is, to go on so ? I'm ashamed of you both, I am ! but here comes Meinheer and the vicar ; see if you dare go on so before them ! \" and enveloping both the Doctor and his com panion in the same glance of reprobation, which actually had the effect of reducing the latter to silence, the outraged hand maiden retreated. \"Just like you, indeed, not to know the difference between a bark and a howl,\" called the offender after her ; but the figure of the Cure, attended by that of his vicar, appearing on the threshold, broke in upon his recriminations, and gave afresh turn to his thoughts. Covering the upper portion of his coun tenance, the elder priest wore a shade, which at first prevented him from perceiv ing the visitor, who sprang towards him, however, immediately."], [82, "76 VERONIA. \" I thought you would never come out of church again,\" said Van Helder, im patiently, \"and I have been waiting for you this hour or more ; I suppose it was the sermon that kept you so long ; but it's a mistake, Cure\\ to preach to people until they are obliged to drop asleep in self defence, I can assure you ;\" and he glanced reproachfully at the Vicar, as if the observa tion was more particularly meant for him. The Cure laughed good-humouredly as he turned with Van Helder into the garden path. \"First Sunday of the month, my dear friend ; consequently procession,\" said he, \" and that always adds half an hour to the service at least. Then, as you say, the ser mon took as much again, for I never preach in a hurry, and yet I don't often see my parishioners asleep either.\" \" Ah ! poor things, they all take snuff, I believe, to keep themselves awake ; or, at least, the sneezing of those who do, serves to wake up those who don't,\" said Van Helder, ironically, \"so you see the merit is not yours.\""], [83, "77 VERONIA. \"Meinheer is perhaps not aware,\" here interposed the half-shocked Vicar, hasten ing conscientiously to his superior's defence, \"that habitual snuff-takers never sneeze, consequently \" \" They choke,\" interrupted the sarcastic Doctor, \" which you will permit me to observe, Mr. Vicar, must be perhaps even more distressing to the delicate ear of the god Somnus, and have the same effect of driving him away ; so that you perceive my argument holds good.\" \" A truce, my children,\" said the still smiling Cure ; \" and to change the theme, what news is stirring? Have you nothing new to relate to us, Van Helder ?\" \"News! to be sure,\" answered the mobile Doctor, commencing as he spoke to feel his pockets, and drawing from one of them a paper, which he wrenched open in his usual impetuous manner ; \" I had indeed almost overlooked it, dolt that I am ! and you remind me I have this day re ceived a letter from a person whose very existence I had forgotten until this reached me \u2014 a former friend and countryman of"], [84, "78 VERONIA. my maternal grandfather's. You may re member him\u2014 a tall, dark, grand-looking man, who visited the Lyceum once, and in whose honour we were given a holiday. Have you any recollection of the circum stance ?\" \" Not the slightest,\" answered his friend, \" it is so long ago, that I wonder you should remember it.\" \" Ah ! holidays were never to you, Paul, what they were to me,\" sighed the philoso pher, with as woeful an aspect as if he were again restored to the days of Latin verbs and the ferule. \" My days of pleasure never so abounded that I was likely to forget them so easily ; but you were always happy, or at least resigned, it is no wonder.\" \" Tut, tut, Jean ! nonsense, nonsense! but what about this grand gentleman, has he only just turned up, after so many years ? \" \" Oh, no ! I met him often during my grandfather's lifetime, and after the latter's death the Duke did not forget me ; but it is long since I have heard anything of him until to-day.\""], [85, "79 VERONIA. \" A Duke indeed ! \" exclaimed the Cure\\ with a gesture of ingenuous surprise, \" you are favoured, Jean, surely. I did not know you had such fine friends,\" and the simple priest actually pushed aside by an in voluntary movement the shade which covered his eyes, as if the better to view the man honoured by such patronage. The hght, however, striking sharply on his enfeebled orbs, or a sense of the weakness of which he was guilty, came to his aid in time to prevent his sarcastic companion from perceiving the effect which his words had produced. \" I did not say he was my friend,\" returned the philosopher, rather impati ently, though he was far from guess ing the Curb's thoughts. \" He was the friend of my grandfather, but how, or why, I never clearly understood, as there must have been a difference of some years between their ages ; and as far as my judgment then could decide, there were not two subjects on which they agreed. However, they corresponded regularly for many years. Since the latter's death I"], [86, "80 VERONIA. have once or twice received the Duke's hospitality in passing through Paris, where he resides, and once or twice subsequently, and at long intervals \u2014 for he is now a very old man \u2014 had communications from him. This is the entire history of our acquaint ance.\" \" And what does he write about to-day, if I may make so bold ?\" asked the Cure\\ meekly. \" Ah ! just what I asked myself, when his letter reached me. It proved, however, to be nothing very interesting to any one but himself, a slight service, as he calls it, which he requires at my hands. The address of a person of whom he has lost sight for some years, and whom he supposes to be resident in this country. \" Now as the only possible way of tra cing an individual the clue to whose where abouts is lost, is, I presume, to be had alone through the police \u2014 a brotherhood to whom I have a particular aversion \u2014 the commission does not much gratify me, and yet I can scarcely refuse to accept it ; do you think so ?\""], [87, "VERONIA. 81 \" Hardly, but I think it may be accom plished otherwise than you suppose, Jean ; for instance, why not consult Monsieur Bouchard ? If the thing can be done, he is undoubtedly the man to do it ; were I in your place, that would be my course.\" A curious grimace passed over Van Helder's features at this suggestion. \" If there is a house in all Flanders which I hate calling at, it is that of your worthy brother-in-law, my good Paul,\" said he, bluntly - and raising from his brow the straw hat which he wore, he flung it to a distance in the energy of his feelings. The dog sprang after it with a delighted bark, which his master rewarded by a petu lent kick, while the Cure\" laughed frankly as he replied : \"It is then a choice of evils ; the prefect of police or the lawyer, whichever you dis like least.\" \" Well, of the two, perhaps, I should say the lawyer ; so that is settled, and I will go to Bruges to-morrow. Heigho ! what an unlucky fellow I am, Paul, to be sure ! VOL. I. G"], [88, "82 VERONIA. Cauvin, you rascal (to the dog), bring me my hat.\" Meanwhile the vicar had lingered bash fully some steps behind the speakers, and was at this moment occupied in admiring one of his superior's choice rose-trees through his spectacles ; while his sisters, having joined him, stood demurely awaiting his pleasure, one on either side of him. Van Helder's quick eye embraced the en tire group at a glance. \" Good souls ! \" said he, approvingly, to his companion. \" Simple, unaffected, and likely to be useful ; little Beth particu larly.\" The Cure smiled at the last words. \"Ah! the fair heretic thinks so; I am glad of it. But here comes Godensca, to call us to supper.\" It was perhaps fortunate, for the Doctor's humour was, we regret to acknowledge, often apt to be ruffled by even the sem blance of a joke at his own expense. It is a test before which philosophy herself some times gives way, so let us not too harshly judge him."], [89, "83 VERONIA. \" The soup is served out,\" called Goden sca, appearing on the threshold ; and with a smiling invitation to his guests to fol low him, the master immediately led the way to his hospitable board. The feast was spread \u2014 in honour of its being the first at which the vicar and his sisters had appeared \u2014 not, as usual, in the kitchen, but in a sanded parlour, the deco rations of which, besides the table, and a row of cane chairs with very high backs, consisted of some rather scanty but admir ably white muslin window-curtains, an old clock in the corner, and two flower-pots on either side the fire-place, which, it being now summer, was consistently hidden from view beneath a plainly-papered board. This board had formerly displayed a sylvan scene, in the centre of which appeared a rather showily-dressed shepherdess, sur rounded by her fleecy charge, apparently the object of much attention to a gay-look ing shepherd, who was contemplating her admiringly from a distance ; but to so many light remarks had this unconscious couple given rise from Van Helder's lips, that Go- G 2"], [90, "84 VERONIA. densca's sense of propriety had been wounded, and, having resolved on their destruction, she had accomplished it by pasting over them a sheet of plain grey paper, not a little, be it said, to the mali cious Doctor's anger and regret. The party did not sit long at table, from which, on rising, they removed to Goden sca's domain, to partake of the inevitable coffee, with which, in that part of the world, every meal concludes. The handmaiden placed chairs for them, at some distance from the stove, served them silently, and then retired to a corner to take her own supper. Having heaped a large bowl full of salad well saturated with vinegar, she filled an other one with milk, and sat down to par take, after her own fashion, of these in gredients. Van Helder, with much curiosity, watched her devour the contents of the salad bowl, unqualified by anything beyond the cold milk, which she swallowed at a draught after it, and then he stepped up to her:"], [91, "VERONIA. 85 \" Do you do that every night?\" asked he, solemnly. \" Do what ?\" said she. \"I sup always, of course.\" \" Oh ! you call that supping, do you ? \u2014 swallowing vinegar by the pint in that way! I call it poisoning yourself ; it will end so, take my word for it.\" \"And if it does, I shan't call you in for a doctor,\" cried Godensca, exasperated ; \"get those to listen to you that you can.\" \" Leave her alone, Van Helder, pray,\" interposed the Cure ; \" I wonder you have nothing better to do than to be always tor menting somebody or other ; let us have a game my children, and you, Jean, fetch the cards.\" \" Certainly,\" said the Doctor, \" with plea sure ; but first let me shew you all a charm ing present I have received, and one by which you shall benefit also, Cure\\ It is a chess-board, which has been painted ex pressly for me by Henricart, but I chose the subjects represented; they are from mythology ; see, here is Venus, the goddess of beauty, rising from the ocean, with her"], [92, "86 VERONIA. beautiful golden hair falling round her like a veil \u2014 not at all unlike the colour of your hair, Fraulein Beth, if you would let it hang down naturally, instead of hiding it away under that tight little cap.\" And while thus speaking he laid on the kitchen table a chess-board, each corner of which was decorated with an exquisitely painted subject on ivory, in miniature style. The words, \" Goddess of Beauty,\" incom prehensible to the three women, surprised and attracted them in a moment round the painting, to which, involuntarily also, the vicar had drawn near ; but great was the Doctor's astonishment at the simultaneous movement with which, after a rapid glance, they all drew back. It is an undoubted fact, that so complete a creature of convention is the human mind, as to render it perfectly willing and ready to accept, under the sanction of some re ceived authority, the very same object which it will disavow and repudiate if presented under other auspices ; and it is not, therefore, hazarding too much to say"], [93, "87 VERONIA. that if, instead of \" Venus,\" Van Helder had named Saint Genevieve of Brabant, and that landscape, instead of ocean, had ap. peared in the picture to corroborate the statement, it would, so far from appearing objectionable, most probably have enlisted their warmest sympathies and admiration. As it was, the figure now offered to their view, under the heathen designation too, of \" Goddess of Beauty,\" startled and shocked these simple and unsophisticated natures beyond expression. Surprised at the coldness of its reception \u2014 for in the first instant of their horror they were silent \u2014 the Doctor looked up, and saw with dismay the effect he had produced. The calm vicar had retired to the side of his superior, with a flush of unmistakable indignation on his brow, at what he con sidered the unchristian indelicacy of which the Doctor had been guilty. The serious Ana looked nothing less than awful in the uncompromising rigidity with which she had drawn her stiff figure to its height, while Beth was vigorously pulling on her little light cap, as if to disavow the"], [94, "88 VERONIA. resemblance to her hair, which had been mentioned, while a blush of offended modesty burnt upon her cheek. \" Meinheer ! Meinheer ! \" shrieked Go densca, whom no amount of horror could long keep silent, \" I say it is a burning shame and a disgrace to treat us like Pagans that way. I'll burn it,\" added she, turning menacingly to the culprit, \"the very first time I find it about \u2014 a scandal to the Presbytery, so it is ! \" and more furious with him than she had ever been before, she stalked out of the kitchen. The Cur^, surprised at this outcry, had approached and lifted the shade from his eyes, the better to take cognizance of the object of it. A glance sufficed to him, and taking the offending painting in his hands, he quietly placed it in those of Van Helder, who, though only dimly realising the full extent of his imprudence, looked half alarmed, and thoroughly discomforted at the scene. \" You should remember, my dear friend,\" said he, somewhat severely, \" that there is such a virtue as discretion in the world \u2014"], [95, "89 VERONIA. one which should supply the place of Christian charity, when this is wanting, and teach you to respect the simplicity of minds less initiated than your own.\" \" But all the world knows that Venus \u2014 ' began Van Helder. \"All the world knows nothing of the kind,\" returned the priest, anxious to dis miss the subject; \"and to those who are ignorant of mythology, pray consider how very unedifying must be so abrupt an intro duction to it. But there, there, Jean,\" seeing that the latter was again about to remonstrate, \"say no more, I beg of you, and I will undertake that none here shall think the worse of you for what is past. You did not mean harm, I am quite sure.\" \" Harm ! \" cried Van Helder, in a lament able and yet indignant tone ; \" could I be expected to know how far such unheard of scruples would extend ? But I will say no more. Good night, Mr. Vicar and ladies. Good night, Cure ; \" and in two rapid steps the Doctor had disappeared. The terrier bounded after him down the garden pathway, and springing over the"], [96, "90 VERONIA. hedge, awaited him on the other side. Van Helder stooped and patted the animal, as it looked up wistfully into his now pale and sorrowful face. \"Ah! Cauvin,\" said he, passionately, there is more logic in the tip of your two ears than in all their vaunted sense.\" Godensca had heard the culprit's depart ing footsteps, and re-entered the kitchen. \" My friends,\" said the Cure, earnestly, \"let me entreat you to forget the error of which our good Doctor has been guilty. Did you know, as I do, his many inesti mable qualities, and the irreproachable purity of his moral character, you would perceive at once that he is incapable of willingly offending against good manners on the most delicate point. He is thoughtless, how ever, I admit, and sadder still, alas ! his faith is dead. He has long ceased to be a Christian. Pray for him, my children, for he has great need of prayers.\" \" It is all very well, Meinheer,\" here observed Godensca, with a despairing shake of the head ; \" but for my part, I'm tired of praying for him any longer ; it seems to me"], [97, "91 VERONIA. to make him worse, instead of better ; and what I say is, it is quite time he should be made to pray for himself."], [98, "92 CHAPTER VI. \" The world is a comedy to those who think ; A tragedy to those who feel.\" In a small, dark, and shabbily furnished room on the ground-floor of a handsome house in the city of Bruges, were seated two women, on the morning following the events we have recorded in the last chapter. Like their personal appearance, their occupations were very dissimilar, and to the most superficial observer would have at once given an insight into the peculiar temper and disposition of each. The younger of the two was seated in the embrasure of the one deep, antique case ment of the chamber ; a parcel of quill pens"], [99, "VERONIA. 93 lay upon her knee, which she was assiduously occupied in mending, throwing into her work a sort of grisly vivacity and enjoy ment, strangely suggestive, somehow, of a cruel and relentless turn of mind. She was no longer young, although, perhaps by courtesy it might be said, somewhere on the right side of thirty ; spare, yet squarely built, with a light sallow skin, hair to correspond, and pale eyes, in which sat a peculiarly chill and gloomy expression. Her dress \u2014 if we may be excused for pro longing the description \u2014 was a muddy looking wrapper, of no particular colour, and yet comprising a variety of violent ones, which, if intended to subdue the crude repulsiveness of her complexion, only served to bring it out more strongly. To conclude, no one in whom the perception either of form, colour, or harmony was ever so faintly developed, could have contemplated her without distress. The other occupant of the apartment was seated on a little round table in the centre, on which lay a considerable litter of threads, needles, and tapes. In her hand she held a piece of"], [100, "94 VERONIA. plain sewing, on which she was vigorously employed \u2014 so vigorously, indeed, that as the needle ploughed its rapid way through the stiff material, it emitted a sharp crack ling sound, as if sparks must inevitably have followed. No such result ensued however ; and as the complacent seamstress swayed to and fro with the effort' necessary for every stitch, her buxom person seemed to radiate again with a glow of energetic satisfaction. When we add that a continual rustling accompanied every movement, need we further state that she was Madame Bouchard ? Into this theatre of harsh, grating, and sharp sounds, was suddenly introduced the sensitive Van Helder. We have said that the Doctor's nature inclined him to conceive antipathies, and if, as we have already said, he entertained a strong one for the lawyer's wife, that which he cherished for his daughter Justine \u2014 the person whom we have described above \u2014 was even greater. Like a very child \u2014 as in many respects he was \u2014 Van Helder often experienced a sort of fear of those whom he disliked, in the same"], [101, "95 VERONIA. manner that his confidence was boundless, and never to be shaken in those whom he had once esteemed ; and as it was in accord ance with the simplicity of his nature, invariably to betray the feelings with which a person inspired him, or rather never to attempt a concealment of them, he had always shunned the slightest contact with Mademoiselle Bouchard, who, perfectly reciprocating the aversion with which he regarded her \u2014 beyond sometimes gratifying herself when the opportunity occurred of an noying him \u2014 took no notice of his presence. He passed her accordingly, on entering the room, without even the common civility of a salutation, and advancing to her mother, but even then forgeting to remove his hat, inquired for Monsieur Bouchard. So unexpected, for in fact so rare, were the Doctor's visits, that the good lady stopped, as if petrified, at the very turning point of an important stitch, and mindful of their last stormy meeting, looked up at him with surprise. A glance at his features showed her, however, instantly, that all recollection of"], [102, "96 VERONIA. it had faded from his mind, and she thought it expedient, therefore, to appear also to have forgotten it. \"Oh! it is you, Meinheer Van Helder,\" said she, with assumed politeness ; \" I never thought of seeing you to-day, of all days in the year ; but you want to see Monsieur Bouchard, I suppose \u2014 he will be very glad, I am sure \u2014 pray sit down, and I will go and look for him in the office ; \" and, rising with alacrity, she rustled inportantly from the apartment. The Doctor remained standing where she had left him, his eyes now turned with a terrible fascination towards the person whom, when at a safe distance from her, he often jokingly designated as Justine the ghastly, the strokes of whose pen-knife seemed to him to become each instant more keen and cruel, as they fell with thrilling distinct ness on his easily-excited nerves. He thought, as he watched her, how deadly might such a little instrument become in such a hand, and shivered, as he felt his look riveted upon the sharp blade in the lithe fingers which moved so swiftly."], [103, "97 VERONIA. Neither had spoken ; but as \u2014 by that mysterious communication of thought which exists between those who hate as powerfully as between those who love \u2014 Justine had read his fancy, she turned towards him suddenly, and darted her pale, lynx-like glance into his eyes. Van Helder turned sick ; a mist swam before his sight ; and but for Madame Bouchard's approaching step, he would have rushed from the chamber. He felt relieved at having been saved the shame of so ignominious a retreat before his enemy, by the door opening to admit her mother. \" Monsieur Bouchard, I regret to say, is out, but has left word he will return shortly ; will you walk into the office, Meinheer, and await his return ? \" It is at all events reversing the proverb of \" out of the frying-pan into the fire,\" thought Van Helder, as he followed, and found himself for once listening to the creaking of Madame's shoes, and the flutter ing of her ribbons, without acute disgust ; VOL. I. H"], [104, "98 VERONIA. but that Justine is an awful creature, and this one is only horribly unpleasant. When Monsieur Bouchard entered his private office, half-an-hour later, well as he was acquainted with the Doctor's counte nance, he started to perceive how very dreary it had become. Seated on the precise spot where the lady of the house had left him, he was still occupied in wiping from his brow the clammy moisture which the shock he had sustained in Justine's presence had brought to it, and so deep in reflection on the subject, as to be unmind ful of the lawyer's presence, until the latter inquired, in a tone of polite sympathy, if anything of a distressing nature had caused his visit. \" Distressing ! ay, horrible ! \" replied Van Helder, still under the magnetic influence of the recollection ; then coming suddenly to a sense of surrounding things, as he felt the keen bright eye of his host fixed curiously on him, he rose, walked smartly round the room as if to shake off the impression, and then reseated himself with a less anxious air."], [105, "VERONIA. 99 \" Really you alarmed me when I first came in, but I am glad to see you all right now ; have some beer, Meinheer Van Helder, you must be tired with your journey.\" \" Thank you, yes, I shall be glad,\" re plied the Doctor, who although it was still morning, was, like all his countrymen, ready for the national beverage at any hour; \"the fact is that I came by the barge, and have had the sun beating on my brain for the last two hours ; I shouldn't wonder if it has become slightly addled ! \" \" Ha, ha,\" laughed the lawyer, with the jovial air peculiar to him, as he filled a tall, thin glass with sparkling beer \u2014 which had just been sent in by his wife \u2014 and offered it to his guest, immediately taking one also for himself. \" I drink to you, Doctor ; as the Turks say, ' May your shadow never be less.' \" \" Thank you, Bouchard, and may yours never be broader;\" and with this smiling allusion to his host's extensive proportions, Van Helder tossed off his glass of beer gaily. H 2"], [106, "100 VERONIA. \" Well, well, nothing very dreadful then can have occurred if you are able to joke as usual, but by my faith, Doctor, the solemnity of your aspect on arriving alarmed\u2014 yes, positively alarmed me.

Bou chard glanced from him to his watch, and then rising hastily, shouted rather than spoke into his ear : \" Awake, Meinheer Doctor, the finest dream must have an end, and we have wasted the whole morning already ; dinner will be ready in half an hour, and I have an appointment in town which will occupy me meanwhile, so we must put off your business, whatever it may be, until this afternoon.

As the sufferer was a young, struggling, al most destitute artist, without friends or patronage, one of those unfortunates, in fact, whose exit from the scene of life, would have been little thought of or re marked, either by society in general, or any of its members in particular, for this very reason the Doctor's philanthropic heart felt more keenly for him, considering that he VOL.

He set off accordingly, one afternoon, to seek his abode, and having reached a shabby looking door, in a back street, stopped be fore it and knocked. The summons was answered by the ap pearance of a respectable elderly woman, of serious aspect, whose features brightened considerably at sight of the visitor. \" Good day, Frau Broc ; is Carl Dopter at home ? \" was Van Helder's inquiry. \" He is, indeed, Meinheer,\" was the reply, in a deploring tone ; \" and, dear me, it is quite a comfort to see you.\" \" Why, I trust all is well \u2014 no more sick ness, no accidents, have you?

Why, ever since the day she entered this house as a bride, the best part of her days have been spent in the garden swing, and eating green apples from sunrise to sun set. Just before you knocked at the door she turned so giddy \u2014 and no wonder \u2014 that she was obliged to go in \u2014 I never saw such a baby in my life !

It was hardly prudent, but I won't scold if you will confess.\" \" / confess, Meinheer ! \" exclaimed the Frau, with consternation depicted on every feature, at a charge so monstrous. \" Jesu- Maria ! as if I had not trouble enough with them already, without adding to it by my own act ! As to that poison which smells even down here, it's only what goes on every clay. Who takes it, or what they do with it, I don't know, but it is poisoning me by inches, even at this distance.\" The Doctor waited to hear no more, but thoroughly mystified, and more than half alarmed, he sprang, with the agility of a youth, up the stairs, and knocked smartly at the door of a room on the first landing, from whence proceeded sounds of mirth and laughter. It was hastily opened by a young man, of lively, intelligent, but rather wild, ap pearance, in shirt-sleeves, who uttered a noisy exclamation of welcome on seeing Van Helder, and drew the guest into a chamber, the atmosphere of which was"], [124, "118 VERONIA. charged with an overpowering odour of \u00e6ther, together with the fumes of coarse tobacco, through the dense clouds of which Van Helder dimly perceived two other per sons. The first was a shaggy -looking youth, with a pipe in his mouth, who was loung ing at a table covered with a heterogeneous mass of articles, amid which some empty beer glasses were conspicuous; the other individual was a young girl, reclining upon a couch at some distance, with head bowed, and her features hidden between her clasped hands. She seemed thus to have cast her self down, either from weariness or despon dency, and as if trying to shut out the sight of the unpleasant externals by which she was surrounded. Van Helder was at no loss to guess that this lady was the bride, and, glancing from her to the disorder of her home, and observing the reckless aspect of the newly made husband, felt sorry for her. \" Why, Doctor ! \" exclaimed the latter, boisterously, \" who would have thought of seeing you so unexpectedly ?

Blank astonishment at this extraordinary recital, and the strangely simple expression, on the candid Flemish physiognomy of the speaker, while delivering it, had succeeded to the Doctor's rising remonstrance and now kept him silent ; but the sound of an oppressed sigh from the sofa recalled his thoughts to the poor bride, and awoke his sympathies. \" And your wife, Mr. Carl! are you aware that while you are practising these tricks, she is inhaling a poison that may possibly be the death of her, and is probably the cause of her present indisposition ?\" asked he severely. \" Oh ! there indeed you are mistaken, Doctor,\" replied the husband with convic tion. \" Gretchen has never had robust health, and since she has been here I think she has lived rather too much in the swing.

For the sake of their souls, probably ! \" \" Jesu - Maria ! \" exclaimed the asto nished Godensca. \"Well, it passes my un derstanding.

Turning quickly at the sound, the Doctor's heart stood still with an icy chill, like that of nightmare, as Justine Bouchard's pale eyes looked into his own. Almost at the same instant a fleeting apparition of the Cure's counte nance presented itself at the open doorway) while a look of mild reproach, which seemed to rest upon Van Helder, roused the cul prit's feelings of remorse, and, dismayed, contrite \u2014 nay, utterly confused \u2014 he rushed into the garden to recover his equanimity.

There was, besides, another motive for meeting Mademoiselle Bouchard, at least on civil terms, for it was she who was, this time, deputed to settle a matter relating to Veronia, which he had hitherto always transacted with her mother ; so he plucked up his courage \u2014 to do which, absurd as it may seem, required no little effort \u2014 and re entered the Presbytery. The Cure met him near the kitchen door, and, considerately pretending not to have before observed him, weclomed his arrival. \" I am glad to see you so early, Van Helder ; you are wanted in there, for my niece is come, and has a message for you from her mother.\" \" Indeed,\" replied the Doctor, with a transparent attempt at surprise ; \" where is she ?\" \" Here,\" said the toneless voice of Justine, as she advanced towards him ; \" I am com missioned to give you this,\" \u2014 displaying as"], [142, "136 VERONIA. she spoke some silver \u2014 \"for the work done by the person you mentioned to my father the other day, and to claim the article.\" \" Mademoiselle de Mehul has not yet given it into my hands, though it is, I believe, com pleted,\" said the Doctor stiffly, but per tinaciously avoiding to meet her look. \" I shall see her, however, to-day, and will ask for it.\" \" Before giving the money ; I suppose I needn't suggest that ; or, perhaps, I had better keep it in my own pocket until I get the article.\" The blood flew to Van Helder's brow ; he looked up angrily now, and met the eye of the speaker. \" You may insult me, Fraulein Bouchard, at your pleasure ; but no one with my con sent shall wound the feelings of the unfortunate ladies whom I have the honour to attend. Keep your money if you choose ; but I will see they have the value agreed upon for their work before it leaves their hands.

That then, was, in the speaker's eyes, evidently the only feminine attribute Justine pos sessed. All griffin as she was, she felt the stab ; the feline principle that lurks in every woman's nature, sprang to the surface, and looked out of her eyes. Had she been of Southern blood, that very instant terrible would have been the exhibition of her resentment ; but belonging to a race in whom passion is often transformed into craft and malice, she swallowed the impulse to strangle him on the spot, and with a glance at her opponent \u2014 which, though boiling over as he had been, now actually chilled him \u2014 moved silently away with noiseless tread, leaving Van Helder and the Cure in quiet possession of the ground. \"You are ruffled and angry to-day, Jean, and I fear it would only make matters worse if you returned to dinner as I had wished ; so I will exempt you from it, unless you are disposed to make peace with her,\" said the latter, when he thought his niece was out of hearing. \"You might as well, my dear Paul, put"], [145, "139 VERONIA. soda and acid together, and request them not to fiz.

I only saw the ladies for a few moments, and as usual didn't speak to your niece at all. As to Bouchard and myself, we got on remarkably well, I believe. I handed him the Duke's letter, and he seemed to enter into the nature of the case directly ; and seeing that, I dele gated to him all my part of the business, such as answering the old gentleman's com munication, and conducting the inquiries he suggests. It is properly a lawyer's business, after all, and I should only have made a mess of it \u2014 don't you think so ? \" \" Well, I think you have taken the wisest course by putting it into more experienced hands, and, whatever happens, will have the consciousnes of having done for the bes ; but I must quit you now, as I have"], [147, "141 VERONIA. business 'at the church, so God be with you, my dear Jean, until we meet again.\" \" And may the Patron Saint of comfort and resignation (whoever he is) be with you, unhappy Cur6,\" mentally re joined Van Helder, as he parted from his friend. As he stepped forward his foot brushed aside a slip of crumpled paper which lay upon the spot where Justine had lately stood. He stooped and lifted it, and as he did so, and the writing caught his eye, an expression of keen curiosity and interest flitted across his features. He gazed at the fragment fixedly for an in stant, and then, having carefully secured it in his vest, took his way towards the vicar's dwelling, for, we lament to say, the weak purpose of a gossip with the sisters on the subject of that morning's events. The Doctor was not such an ignoble exception to man in general, in this respect, as might be thought, when pouring into Beth's sympathising ear the tale of Justine's insolent mistrust of Veronia ; nor, after this, can it be wondered at if the story which he would have so carefully kept from her"], [148, "142 VERONIA. found its way to Mademoiselle de Melml's self. The last thought in Beth's mind was to give pain or to wound the dignity of her friend, but she did both by divulging to her the slight which had been passed upon her ; and thus added a drop of double bitterness to the proud girl's already brim ming cup of sorrows. This, the Flemish maiden's nature, though true and kindly, was, however, scarce delicate enough to understand."], [149, "143 CHAPTER IX. \" So many men, so many minds.\" Since the day when he had obtained the Doctor's sanction to his wishes, Jacques Henricart had timed his visits to the De Mehuls with such discretion as gradually to obtain a sort of footing there, of wThich he had been very careful to take no undue advantage, and it was indeed but rarely that he presented himself unaccompanied by Van Helder ; but when he did so, the reserve of his manner and language proved how deep was the respect with which he approached them. Nor was this delicacy unappreciated by Veronia, who, hke all proud persons, was thus unconsciously induced to overlook \u2014"], [150, "144 VERONIA. perhaps even at moments to forget\u2014 some part of the great social distance that sepa rated them ; as she had already overlooked it with regard to the Doctor, for in this case, as in all others, \" Ce n'est que le premier pas qui coute.\" That once taken, it unavoidably entails succeeding ones. Perhaps, too, Van Helder's liberal opin ions had gained a little on her convic tions, and his friend's thoughtful bear ing and delicate conduct, under circum stances where many of his superiors in station might have failed in both, had aided the impression ; but, be this as it may, at the date to which this chapter refers, Henricart's presence was neither unfre quent nor unwelcome in their dwelling. The day was drawing to a close ; its last hues were lingering over earth and sea, and tinting with a crimson glow the white crest of the waves, as they came rolling proudly in. Brightened by the glad re flection, the melancholy abode of the De Mehuls looked less sad, and the shadow on the face of its inmates seemed less deep than usual."], [151, "145 VERONIA. Poor mother ! on her features it was ever that of pain, but to-day even that was softened into patience. Veronia sat beside her couch, clasping in her own one of her pale, wasted hands, but with her eyes turned towards the open door, upon the sea and sky beyond, and, as on the day when we first introduced her to the reader, the sunlight falling round her gave to her pallid cheek a brightness not its own. \" Look, mother, how gorgeous is the scene to-night \u2014 how the waves glitter beneath the sunset ! I am glad we settled near the sea, it is so full of change \u2014 so beautiful ! \" \"Yes,\" replied the sick woman, languidly, \" but I miss the sight of flowers sadly ; how few we have seen this summer, and the season is nearly over. I am sorry, for I shall never see them any more.\" \" Dearest mother, how can you have such a thought ? \" and tenderly bending down to kiss the faded cheek, Veronia added, \" But you shall have flowers, for I will ask the Doctor to get us some, the next time that he comes.\" As she was yet speaking, the sound of VOL.

The former drew back after a hasty salu tation, and smilingly pushed forward his companion, with an expressive gesture, when Veronia perceived that he held in his hand a superb bouquet of choice roses, whose rich perfume already pervaded the chamber. He glanced a moment irreso lutely from Madame de Mehul to her daugh ter, made a step forward, hesitated, coloured slightly, and then, with an abrupt movement, crossed towards the couch, and laid the flowers silently on it. The invalid's eye was raised gratefully, and she smiled \u2014 the first time for many a long month ; that smile, so faint and unfamiliar, lighting up, as it were, all the deep ravages of pain and grief, over which her long sadness, until then, had cast a veil, struck sorely upon Veronia's heart. The blood rushed pain fully over neck, cheek, and brow, while a gush of irrepressible tears, for a moment, dimmed her sight; but ere these signs of"], [153, "147 VERONIA. emotion had scarcely appeared, they had again vanished, and her unbending spirit had regained the mastery over feeling; then, remembering her mother's wash thus unexpectedly gratified, she felt that some acknowledgment was due to the donor, and, stepping to where Henricart stood, with a silent look of thanks, she offered him her hand. At this unlooked-for favour \u2014 the greatest his wildest hopes had ever, perhaps, sug gested \u2014 the artist turned pale, trembled, and drew back ; then, suddenly ashamed of his emotion, he took the proffered hand, though timidly, within his own, and, as he did so, his troubled glance was cast upon the ground. Is it thus the apostles of equality shrink, then, and tremble at the superior's touch when graciously accorded to them ? We know not, but can only vouch, that this condescension from Mademoiselle de Mehul made Jacques Henricart's aspect grow as shy and strange as though he had been guilty of some crime in which he was then suddenly detected. Moved herself by her pre- L 2"], [154, "148 VERONIA. vious feelings of distress, the former did not perceive his agitation, and, when she found a voice, expressed in grateful terms her sense of his attention. He stammered some unintelligible words, and without yet venturing to raise his eyes towards her, retreated into a corner of the apartment, while Van Helder, as usual, after dragging a chair forward, and chang ing its position some dozen times, at last seated himself to his satisfaction, and gave forth a sigh expressive of content. \" Beautiful creations ! \" said Veronia, en thusiastically, as she took the flowers and inhaled their fragrance with evidenjt delight. \" My favourite flower is not the rose, and yet that she is the queen of flowers, I must admit ; but, dearest mother, their scent is too powerful for you, I will place them at a little distance, where you can equally ad mire, without being overcome by them ; \" and, so saying, she removed the nosegay to a table in the centre of the room, and busied herself in arranging it tastefully in a vase of water. \"May I venture to ask mademoiselle"], [155, "VERONIA. 149 which is her favourite flower ? \" inquired Henricart, timidly, while a very perceptible change of tone betrayed something of the feelings which had just agitated him, and drew even the attention of Van Helder, who looked at him in surprise. Perhaps this time Veronia also noticed it, for her glance rested wonderingly on him for an instant, and when she answered, it was with a half-jesting air, very unusual to her, and as if intended to efface the re collection of her late feeling one. \"That, monsieur,\" said she, smiling, \" would be \u2014 according to some theorists \u2014 telling many other things besides, for it has been said that if a person could be induced to answer, with perfect frankness, three questions, of which that is one, it would be easy to deduce from those answers an exact estimate of his mind and character.\" '.' Oh, delightful!\" exclaimed Van Helder, springing gleefully like a school-boy to her side ; \"let us all compare notes directly, Veronia, and see the stuff that we are each composed of \u2014 what are the three questions, I beg ? \""], [156, "150 VERONIA. \" Will you answer them faithfully, Doctor, for your own part, if I ask them? \" said she, amused at his impetuosity, which drew forth even from the grave Henricart a smile. \" Answer them ? \u2014 of course I will \u2014 pro ceed.\" \" Well, then, they are these : First, what is your favourite flower? Secondly, what book \u2014 were but one allowed you \u2014 would you select to take into a desert island ? And lastly, under what reign \u2014 had the choice been possible \u2014 would you have preferred to Hve ? \" \" Under that of Lycurgus,\" said Van Helder, solemnly, and characteristically answering the last question first, \" the great lawgiver, who nobly devoted himself to the welfare of his people, who taught them to restrain their appetites, and to despise filthy lucre ; who made their men worthy of the name, their children hardy, and their women sensible ; who \" \" Enough, Doctor, we fully grant it ; and who obliged them, whatever might have been their digestive powers, to swallow"], [157, "151 VERONIA. black broth at stated periods. I do not really understand your taste; but, however, to proceed, to your favourite book, or rather that one, under the circumstances stated, which you would select?\" \" Digestive powers ! God bless me ! \" said the Doctor, reverting to the commencement of this speech, and looking not a little in dignant at the tide of his enthusiasm having been thus abruptly checked. \" Do you suppose for an instant, mademoiselle, that Lycurgus would have allowed his people to suspect that they had digestive organs at all ? You understand his character very imperfectly, I see, by such an observation, and it would be therefore idle to discuss it with you. Let us go on to the next question. \" The book, undoubtedly, I should select to take with me into a desert island, would be the ' History of Robinson Crusoe.' I declare that description of Friday's footsteps in the sand, and the table in which is balanced his account of good and evil, are admirable. I know nothing finer \u2014 \" \" There, again \u2014 although I admire ' Robinson Crusoe ' exceedingly \u2014 is a slight"], [158, "152 VERONIA. difference of opinion between us,\" said Veronia ; \" and now let us see whether we shall agree better as to the flower \u2014 which flower is your favourite ? \" \"Well, really that now is perplexing, seeing that I never notice flowers,\" replied the Doctor, with a puzzled look ; \" but let me see \u2014 I think, upon the whole, the arti choke.\" \" The artichoke ! \" exclaimed Henricart and Veronia together, \" you mistake, Doctor, that is a vegetable \u2014 \" \" I beg your pardon, mademoiselle,\" said he, with a slightly offended air, \" but there is a flower belonging to it, at all events, for I noticed it this very morning in the Cure's garden, which is the reason I know it ; a deep blue flower, and very pretty, too, it is, I can assure you.\" \" Indeed, it may be so, but I have never seen it,\" said Veronia; \" however, it will not do for our purpose ; it must be a real flower, Doctor \u2014 have you no preference?\" \" I daresay that I should have, if I knew their names and what each of them was like; but as 1 don't, how can I care about"], [159, "153 VERONIA. them? \u2014 say the rose, if j'ou like \u2014 those roses, to be sure, are splendid.\" \" No, that will never do \u2014 you say the rose because you see it at this moment, as you would say the buttercup, if it was before you.\" \" Then I don't know, indeed, so I can't say, unless an animal might supply the place of a flower.\" \"I think,\" said Veronia, \"it might; at least, it has been said so by those philosophers who make analogies their study, so choose your favourite, Doctor.\" \" Oh ! without any doubt the dog, fine faithful fellow ! I love the dog, and cannot say as much for all the rest of the crea tion. \"And I the cat,\" said she, \"though all the world unites in blackening her charac ter; \" then added laughingly, \"I never see a glossy, purring cat, or little gambolling kitten, without feeling some tender sym pathy, some domestic instinct, awakened in me, to which at other moments I am a stranger.\" \" The cat \u2014 she is a traitor ! \" cried Van"], [160, "154 VERONIA. Helder, fiercely, \" she has neither honour nor frankness \u2014 how can you, Veronia? But I suppose that women naturally like what ever is smooth and silky ; unfortunate for us rough creatures, eh, Jacques ? \" Had Henricart been dreaming? It looked very like it, for he started like one roused from a deep sleep at the mention of his name. Veronia gave him no time to understand or answer the query, for she turned quickly towards him. \" It is your turn now, monsieur,\" said she. \" The Doctor has answered all my questions. To begin, therefore, by the same that he commenced by, allow me to ask under what reign you would have lived ?\" \" Forgive me, mademoiselle, if I decline to answer your inquiry ; it is not my nature, even in jest, to prevaricate, and the truth might \" \" Shock you,\" here broke in Van Helder, laughing. \" Yes, shock and frighten you, Veronia, and no wonder; ask no further, I advise you.\" \" Shock and frighten me,\" she repeated, in surprise, \" and wherefore ? Should not"], [161, "155 VERONIA. all men be free to hold the opinions on such matters that they choose, so long as they do not attempt to force them upon others?\" \" You think so, mademoiselle \u2014 I thank you ; then this is mine. I would have lived under no reign, because I would have recognized no monarch ; but I would fain have been among those heroic spirits who struggled for the rights of man, the birth rights of humanity, with Robespierre, Saint Robespierre, as their leader,\" and he uttered the words Saint Robespierre, with the same air of reverence with which a devout Catholic might have pronounced the name of one of the Church's most venerated martyrs. \" Oh ! you are startled,\" exclaimed the Doctor, as, unable to conceal her astonish ment, Veronia drew back with a sudden gesture of dismay. \" You don't half know him yet ; this amateur of roses, this peaceful being, who assents to all you say, and if you had a kitten here, would hold a ball of string for its amusement by the hour \u2014 he is a ' red ' \u2014 a blood red \u2014 don't trust him, for"], [162, "156 VERONIA. he will turn out badly some day, depend upon it ;\" and dehghted at the evident dis comfiture of the admirer of Robespierre, who bit his lip, and more than once changed colour, Van Helder laughed, rubbed his hands delightedly together, and looked at him with an eye brimful of gleaming mischief in every glance. \"Your tastes, gentlemen, are certainly peculiar,\" said Veronia, after a pause, \" nor can I understand them ; but, of course, Monsieur Henricart's judgment has weighed his opinions in this case, or he would not so frankly express them,\" and her look provoked a defence ; but evidently not disposed to utter it, the latter was silent. \" And the book ?\" she now asked, in a tone of unsubdued sarcasm, \"is, I presume, of the same colour as the opinions ?\" \" I am no reader,\" answered he humbly, \" and I scarcely know how to answer this question ; but I met, when I was a youth, with a work which made a deep impression on me, and I think, if I had to select one as a companion, under the circumstances"], [163, "157 VERONIA. you have named, it would be that \u2014 perhaps, mademoiselle, you may have heard of it \u2014 the ' Ten Thousand and One Nights !

She turned quickly upon the speaker, therefore, as Henricart was about to speak, determined to avenge his outraged dignity, and thus prevent his doing so more warmly. \" It is you, Doctor, on the contrary, who are inconsistent,\" said she; \"you, a classical scholar, objecting to fable! Have you, then, quite forgotten the ' Iliad,' and the 'Odyssey,' the speech of Xanthus to Achilles, Suetonius' horses weeping at the death of C\u00e6sar, Livy's Ox, whose speech beginning ' Roma, cave tibi,' he quotes to us \u2014 not to mention all the marvels contained in Apu leius' ' Metamorphosis, or the Golden Ass,' and the ' Lucius, or the Ass ' of Lucian, or Lucius of Patras, \u2014 to whichever of them it may belong? My erudition does not come up to that of the most ignorant school boy, and yet I should find no difficulty in multiplying examples of this kind until nightfaH. How can you, then, reproach your friend for admiring what, under another shape, you are infatuated about yourself?\" \" Whatever belongs to the classics is"], [165, "159 VERONIA. consecrated,\" began Van Helder, solemnly ; but Veronia mischievously interrupted him. \" Say rather, Doctor, that like every one of your opinionated sex, whatever your own taste disapproves, no one else on any pretext may admire ; true, however, as you say, the classics are exceptional in a manner, but is that any reason why other literature should be depreciated?\" \" Nor do I depreciate it ; you think, per haps, mademoiselle, that I have no taste, no feeling for modern works of sentiment ; but you are mistaken. I have shed tears, impenetrable as I appear, over the sorrows of Werter. I have hung in imagination with him over Charlotte's nosegay, and trembled at each speck of dust, as she re moved it from those weapons which he des tined to turn against his own existence \u2014 what a pathetic passage ! \u2014 and the little group of hungry children around Charlotte. how affecting !

Despite Henricart's"], [166, "160 VERONIA. cloudy visage \u2014 who had not yet recovered his equanimity \u2014 and the Doctor's undoubted seriousness, Veronia could not keep her countenance; his belief in his own impene trability, the image of his figure hanging weeping over Charlotte's bouquet, or trem bling over her lover's pistols, and, above all, his sudden and unprecedented admiration for little hungry children, excited her risi ble faculties to that degree, that to control them was impossible. She glanced involun tarily at Henricart, and turning aside in a vain effort to hide her amusement from the speaker, struck him dumb with amazement and indignation by a sudden peal of gay and girlish laughter, such as he had never before heard from her lips. He looked at her for an instant fixedly \u2014 then, as if too greatly disgusted for words, stepped over the threshold, and stalked down upon the shore. His friend's brow cleared, he looked after Van Helder's retreating form complacently, and felt that he was avenged far better than by any action of his own, for the poor Doctor was evidently mortified to the"], [167, "VERONIA. 161 quick, and he knew that he could only have succeeded in irritating or offending him. Yes, such is man \u2014 and, for that matter, woman also. There are moments when his dearest friend's vexation is as nectar to him ! It is an ugly trait in human nature, no doubt. In palliation of Jacques Henricart at this moment, however, we must recall the fact that his own self-love had just been deeply wounded. \" I am too happy, mademoiselle,\" said he, now looking at Veronia with beaming eyes, \" that my poor taste has met with your approval. 1 confess that I had fears lest you should consider it extravagant.\" \" Oh, no ! you are far, in this respect, from being singular,\" replied she. \" Philo sophers and grave men before you, have been fascinated with the gorgeous imagery of those wonderful tales, and one of the most elegant, accomplished, and classic writers of his day, has said of them ' Thomme qui cherche inutilement une compensation passagere d Tamer ennui de sa realise', n'a probablement pas lu encore les' Mille et Une Nuits.'

While these thoughts had been passing through her mind, Henricart had ap proached the flowers, and was now bend ing over them. \"Ah! that reminds me,\" said she, ob serving him, \" that you have yet to answer the question, as to which is your favourite flower ? \" He glanced towards the door to see whether the coast was clear enough for him to speak unheard by the Doctor, then, after looking down a moment, in half em-"], [169, "163 VERONIA. barrassed silence, and carefully avoiding to meet Veronia's eye, said, low and hur riedly : \"Our preference for, or dislike of, most things, is, I think, mademoiselle, founded on some association, pleasant or painful, connected with them \u2014 beyond all other flowers, I henceforth love the rose ! \" M 2"], [170, "164 CHAPTER X. \" He, full of bashfulness and truth, Loved much, hoped little, and desired nought.\" \" The rose ! it is not possible ! \" exclaimed Veronia, indignant as his meaning flashed across her, confirmed, too, by the trem bling lip, the downcast eye, and troubled mien. \" You love the rose : what can the beautiful, the fragrant, the delicate ideal which she personifies have in common with a taste for bloodshed, violence, and crime r They were hard words, and uttered harshly, for she felt outraged at his mad presumption, and to it indeed was the reproach in reality addressed."], [171, "VERONIA. 165 Henricart saw only that his companion was excited \u2014 her sparkling eye and heav ing breast showed it too plainly ; but he was far from guessing the exact cause of her emotion, and simply answered the expressed one \u2014 \" Do you then really believe me pos sessed of such base instincts, mademoi selle ? \" he asked, gently and sorrowfully, venturing now to raise towards her a reproachful look. \" Forgive my saying so, but oh, you wrong me cruelly, most cruelly, by such a judgment.\" \"Can the disciple dissent then so utterly from the master? \u2014 for you have avowed yourself the adherent of one on whose name lies thickly the stain of blood, whose memory is black with murder ; these things eternity itself cannot efface.\" \" And those who knew him truly dis avow,\" retorted he, warmly. \" Is not the memory of great spirits for ever calum niated by baser ones ?

He had caught Jacques Henricart's last words on entering, and rushing to his side perceived that the latter's dark cheek was overspread with a sallow paleness not usual there. \" We were speaking of the immortal Maximilian,\" said he, solemnly, in answer to the Doctor's exclamation ; \"I regret to have exposed his name to reproach, for mademoiselle unfortunately cherishes the common prejudice against the heroes of the Revolution.\" \"And what, in the name of common sense, man, does it, can it, signify what is now said of Robespierre ? He is dead ; his"], [173, "167 VERONIA. reign is over, is it not? and other times have come. Not that he wasn't a butcher though, mind you, while he lived ! \" \" Yes, a butcher on the same principle that the soldier, who strikes with a relent less hand the enemy of his land, liberty, and life, is one,\" repHed the Frenchman, scornfully \u2014 \" the definition is a just one.\" \" Oh ! if you are going to take up the defence of soldiers, I have done,\" laughed Van Helder. \"The soldier is a fine crea ture, to be sure. He goes forth to accom plish a certain amount of mangling, and stands to be hacked at in return, at the rate of so many pence a-day, clothes to wear, and food \u2014 if he lives to eat it \u2014 included. Trained, like a bulldog, to demolish whatever is set before him, he neither knows nor cares one half the time who's right or who's wrong. Truly you do your hero injustice in supposing I could compare him to a type like this. No, no \u2014 the gentle Maximilian knew well the value of each head he felled ; he didn't murder for the pleasure, but the profit.\" \" Dr. Van Helder,\" exclaimed Henricart,"], [174, "168 VERONIA. pale with passion, turning full upon him, \" do you forget that I have been a soldier ? But for the presence of these ladies, no man should speak thus of the military profession with impunity before me.\" \" I had forgotten it, my dear, good Jacques,\" exclaimed Van Helder, frankly ; \" pardon me, for the last thing I intended was to offend you. In proof of it I will do penance by listening in silence to all the nonsense concerning your idol you like to pour into Mademoiselle de Mehul's ear; can I \u2022 do more, and am I now ab solved ? \" \" Yes, Doctor ; knowing as I do your most peculiar theories, I was a hasty fool to feel annoyed at your remarks,\" answered the ci-devant soldier, accepting his friend's offered hand immediately. He might have added that, but for Veronia's presence, he would not have been so, for that was the truth, and it was indeed some minutes before his brow cleared again. Veronia's look, unconsciously to herself, had meanwhile rested earnestly and search ingly upon him. The knowledge that in"], [175, "169 VERONIA. that heart, so kindling with blood-stained traditions, lurked, warm and tender, a secret that had power to conquer even them ; that, amid all those images of storm and blood and darkness, reposed one soft, fair, and gracious as woman's heart could wish her own to be reflected in the breast of him she loves ; that knowledge, so un looked for, and so suddenly acquired, made the proud lady tremble for an instant, as the virtuous of her sex must ever do when such a secret is first revealed to them. But nature and education in her at once came to the rescue, recaUed the full magnitude of Henricart's presumption, and the cool ness necessary to quench it, so that when she turned again towards him her features wore the icy calmness, and her tone the condescending nonchalance, of an accom plished woman of the world. \" So then, Monsieur Henricart, you un hesitatingly avow yourself a ' red,' and we, on whom it has pleased Heaven to bestow the trifling distinction of gentle blood, be come entitled by that circumstance, you think, to all the honours of the guillotine.\""], [176, "170 VERONIA. \"Madame,\" said the revolutionist, proudly, struck by the unaccustomed dis tance of her manner, and as if accepting the challenge conveyed by it, \" not all, as I have had the opportunity of learning, since I have enjoyed the distinguished honour of being admitted to your presence \u2014 not aU betray the high prerogatives conferred by birth and station ; but that they do not, is alone owing to the accident which some times joins nobility of soul to these advan tages.\" \"Indeed,\" said Veronia, as coolly as be fore, and with a glance of keener sarcasm ; \"it is, then, I perceive, your theory, that it is a matter of course, when the plebeian is possessed of a high cast of character, honour, and so forth, and accidental when these attributes are found in the patrician.\" \" Perhaps my own experience would not so far disprove the assumption, madame,\" replied he, briefly ; \" the virtues of human nature, though capable, doubtless, of attain ing to perfection, are at a low ebb now, and have long been so ; when placed in the midst of institutions tending to vitiate,"], [177, "171 VERONIA. what can be expected but that corruption should be exactly in proportion to the amount those institutions have fostered ? \" \" Very fairly argued,\" responded the Hstener, mockingly ; \" and as, by the institu tions you allude to, social distinctions are, I suppose, meant, it follows that, according to your opinion, Monsieur Henricart, in proportion as a human being's position is elevated in the material world, it wiU be degraded in the moral one \u2014 do I under stand you?\" \" Henricart, my dear good soul, when you do argue you are reaUy so prosy that you must excuse my listening to any more of it,\" said Van Helder, moving towards the door. \" If he bores you to the point of death, Mademoiselle de Mehul, call me to the rescue, otherwise I shall stroll about near the door tiU he has done.\" As he crossed the threshold a change came over Veronia and his friend. Left thus again alone with him, the lady's confidence gave way, and though she blushed with anger at her own weakness, a sense of embarrassment stole over her, and"], [178, "172 VERONIA. would not be shaken off. As if Henricart had noted the difference, his look, too, altered now; his hard brow relaxed its folds, the defiant sternness melted from his \u2022eyes, and only a grieved expression re mained in their stead. \" Well, monsieur,\" said Veronia, calling to her aid a manner of assumed indifference, as with this new, and, as she feared, senti ment-foreboding aspect her companion again approached her, \" we have, you see, tired the patience of Doctor Van Helder, and not gained particularly upon each other's convictions, so it is, perhaps, as well to leave the subject. If I am not singular in my opinions \u2014 aristocratic prejudices as, I believe, your school caU them \u2014 neither is it perhaps surprising you should cling to yours. Birth, early association, and educa tion have so much to do with these' things, that it is not to be expected the offspring of nobility should be a liberal, or the child of the people a conservative \u2014 so let it rest \u2014 you have the tendencies of your class, I, too, must uphold now, and for ever, the prerogatives of mine.\""], [179, "173 VERONIA. She rose with the haughty grace that seemed at moments a part of her nature, made an imperious gesture as if to dismiss at once the theme and the speaker, and was stepping to the door by which Van Helder* had issued, when Henricart hurried to her side. \"A word \u2014 a single word, madame, ere I depart,\" said he, enlightened suddenly by the significant manner in which the last words had been uttered, and gleaning jfroin it into what depths his rashness had pre cipitated him ; \" whatever may have been the boldness of my language, whatever the freedom of my manner, never for one instant, since the proud moment I first crossed your threshold, have I ceased, even in my most secret thoughts, to honour and reverence you supremely, and, above all, that you deigned then to receive, and con verse 'with me as an equal, was a distinction to which, but for your friend the Doctor's encouragement, I should have never dared to aspire.

Doubtless that I have seemed to you an outcast, exiled from the country of my birth, and living in this remote spot, yet such had not been my forlorn lot had not the base deception of a noble brought disgrace on my home. Judge then if I could do otherwise than hate and despise a class ever ready to heap dishonour upon mine ; be just, and say how can a man, who sees his whole life's hopes laid bare, and blasted, by wickedness (which urges the pride of blood as an excuse, and family dignity as a motive against reparation) be blamed, if peace and charity desert his breast for ever? Such was my case,\" re sumed he, after a momentary pause, and in a softened tone, \"when, as if to make amends for so much misery, Heaven brought me a careworn, hopeless being to your side. Since then what light has shone upon my darkened path, what better thoughts have sprang to life within me ; and if these are all to close in disappointment, how can I look"], [181, "175 VERONIA. on life with tolerant eyes again ?

When as a stranger, and under circumstances calculated to raise distrust of me in the mind of any other person, I first arrived in this country, he came forward with a gracious confidence towards me, that would have alone made me for ever his debtor. While I remained in Bruges, where, as you perhaps know I exercised the art of painting, he found me patrons, and would have found me friends, had I been so disposed; but the cloud of my past life hung too darkly over my spirits for me to be capable of finding any pleasure in the society of my feUow-men. A mis anthrope I was, and must, I fear, remain.\" \"Yes, a misanthrope who can talk for three or four hours at a stretch,\" provo kingly said Van Helder, looking round the door ; \" come away, Jacques, before Made moiselle de Mehul mentally consigns you to the chef, under whose particular superin tendence Saint Robespierre is doubtless at present broiling \u2014 do you hear ? \""], [183, "177 VERONIA. \" Good night, Doctor,\" said Veronia, smiling ; \"I think we have done with the reign of terror for some while, so you need not fear, next time you come, hearing any more about it.\" \" I am thankful to learn it, my dear young lady, for my friend Henricart had given me already so many editions of it, that the recurrence of the theme began to create in me a Httle, just a little nausea, you know.

Four months had elapsed since the day when Veronia had repulsed the offered services of Karel Vanneker's little sister, and yet, in that brief space, their intimacy had ripened into a feeling which it would be scarcely exaggeration to term friendship.

For one year the unhappy girl had clung with the obstinacy of despair to the dread solitude in which she had sought shelter from the world. Alone with her sick mother, and her own fainting spirit, she had seen season after season pass away, and no voice, but that of the eccentric Doctor, had fallen on her ear, no human shape beside had crossed their threshold. Day succeeded day, un marked save by the duU routine of labour, and the sad phases of decline through which her parent's life was ebbing out. Oh ! life, life ! with all your varied forms of suffering, to how many are you as a bad dream, from which they hope only in death to awaken ! Such had been existence to the proud, undisciplined heart of Veronia, until the sunshine of Beth's Christian charity stole cheeringly in, and melted the thick waU of ice that seemed to have closed for ever around it. As her strength diminished, the dying woman's moral energies had wasted also, until, at last, it was only under the influ ence of deHrium that they ever brightened, n 2"], [186, "180 VERONIA. and thus her daughter was kept in a still greater solitude of mind. As for Van Hel der, though excellent, warm-hearted, and sympathetic, he was yet, in some respects too widely removed from cultivated human nature to render it possible that he should ever supply, to one of the softer sex, the absence of all other companionship, and thus it came about that Veronia gradually broke down the barriers of her former haughtiness, and admitted the village girl to her confidence. Nor, in so doing, had she erred ; for the latter was pure and sim ple as any soul can be that for eighteen mortal years has worn a covering of clay. Summer had passed away. AHeady the time of brief twilights and chill evenings had commenced. Autumn was beginning her poetic, if melancholy, reign ; and the sinis ter influence which she ever exercised in those regions, was beginning also to dim many an eye, and bring the hue of sickness to man)r a sun-burnt cheek. Itwas on one of these evenings \"that Veronia had just laid aside her work, and was pre paring to steal down for a few moments' re-"], [187, "181 VERONIA. freshment to the beach, when a low tap at tbe door was followed by the apparition of Beth, who now, not unfrequently, came thus without warning. The invalid lay sleeping upon her couch, and, making a sign to the young girl not to disturb her mother, Veronia drew Beth out side the dwelling, of which she shut the door. The air was unusually soft and balmy. The sea, breaking along the shore in silver ripples, rose and retreated with a murmur ing cadence, like music, that fell soothingly upon Veronia's weary heart and brain. She cast herself down upon the sand, as might have done a saddened child, and, closing her eyes, turned languidly to catch the breeze that was blowing softly towards land. Beth contemplated her thus a moment, silently, with an admiring smile, half puz zled to discover whence arose the charm that hung about her, for the wan cheek, sunken eyes, arid wasted outlines were quite unlike all forms of beauty she had ever heard ex toUed; yet beautiful, against the evidence of"], [188, "182 VERONIA. all her experience, Beth fancied she must be. \"Yes,\" thought she, \" I have heard Van Helder and Jacques Henricart, when they thought I was was not listening, speak of her as superior to aU women they had ever seen, and they must surely know ; besides that, a lady's beauty must of course be dif ferent from that of simple girls like me.\" Veronia met her glance as these thoughts were passing through the mind of Beth, who felt that it was necessary to explain the scrutiny of her look. \" I was thinking, mademoiselle, how pale you are ! Were you alwaj^s thus ? \" \" Not always,\" answered Veronia, with a sad smile. \" No, Beth, though I could never boast your blooming cheeks, yet ' I was not formerly the faded creature you now see me ; yet, changed as I am, I only wonder I am not more so, and cannot un derstand how every lock has not turned, long ago, like snow.\" \" You have suffered, mademoiselle ; yes, I can see it \u2014 that is what has taken away all your colour ; but you are still young, it wiU return, and though beauty is, after all,"], [189, "183 VERONIA. nothing compared to the soul's adorning, yet we may hope you will be handsome again, some day.\" \"Never! oh, never!\" exclaimed Veronia, with an impatient gesture; \"life can con tain for me no further hope, as it can hold no further pain \u2014 my destiny is fulfilled.\" Presumptuous words ! weU may they tremble who have dared to pronounce them. The pious Beth was not a little shocked at the want of aU religious training which this sentiment implied, and ere replying, pondered for a m oment how most delicately to instil a better one. \" We never know,\"she said, \"what troubles we can bear until they are laid upon us. I pray that mademoiseUe may never have heavier ones than those already past, but if it should please God to try her further \u2014 \" \" Impossible, I tell you, child,\" exclaimed Veronia, with flashing eyes ; \" all that the heart of woman can endure has been poured into mine ; unmerited dishonour, treachery, poverty, disgrace ; all these, and more \u2014 what could I suffer yet ? \" \"There are dregs to every cup,\" mur-"], [190, "184 VERONIA. mured Beth, with an involuntary glance at the dwelling, to whose sick inmate her mind instinctively reverted; but Veronia heard her not, she had risen, and was now pacing to and fro with the agitated step of one under the influence of strong, un conquerable feeling. Suddenly she paused beside the young girl, and casting herself again upon the sand, turned away, and, as far as her companion's eye could judge, her looks seemed bent in the direction of the far-off horizon bounding the view to the west. The beams which had so lately guilded it had died away, the indefinite ness of evening was closing over it, and, to those who cared to mark them, the softness and the melancholy of twilight tinted the scene. The unpoetic Beth scarce saw the change, to her it was only grey distance and even ing; she guessed not the power of awaken ing sad memories that they might have on the impassioned heart beside her, and started when a broken voice addressed her. On looking round, she saw that Veronia's eyes were full of tears."], [191, "185 VERONIA. For an instant Beth forgot her condem nation of the sufferer, to remember only her pain. She took the latter's slender hands within her own, and chafed them tenderly, as if they had been those of a child, and her glance grew dim with pity as it rested on the sorrowful face before her; but the Flemish nature, like the English, when most deeply affected, boasts not the ready flow of language, in which to clothe a sympathetic thought. Kind, tender, and generous feelings filled her heart to overflowing; but they could not reach her tongue, and she was silent. Veronia was too much absorbed with her own reflections, to misconstrue, perhaps even to notice, her companion's reserve. For a few moments she too was silent, and then with drawing her hands, shook off all the traces of her tears, and spoke again. \" Oh ! child,\" said she, \" you are happy, such cares as mine have never reached you; you have never known those keen and piercing griefs that wither and devas tate the heart they once have touched ; yet, even you mu^t have known, under"], [192, "186 VERONIA. some form, that feeling, the object of which is dearer to you than your own life, for whom no sacrifice would seem too hard, from whom no human sorrow or infirmity could turn you. If so, you can understand me, for you have loved.\" She paused trembling and hueless be neath the passion her memory had evoked ; while startled, confused, half-frightened, Beth said nothing. But little mattered this to her companion ; she was looking back into a past that had cast its dark shadow far even into the years to come, and saw only its reflection. She continued, \u2014 \" It is time, good Beth, you should know something of my life and sorrows ; be fore we part to-night, you shall do so. \" My parents were rich, and of high caste ; a marriage of pure love had united them, by which my dearest mother had broken all those ties that should have bound her to her own kindred, for in becoming my father's wife she had com mitted in their eyes an unpardonable crime, for the reason that his religious and political faith differed widely from theirs. They might"], [193, "187 VERONIA. possibly in time have entertained more softened feelings about this, had my father been inclined to meet them half way, but his pride was as intense as their own, and it never yielded. I was an only child, and my parents loved me fondly. Every caprice that money could satisfy was indulged, and my nature was ardent, and thirsted for indulgence in every form. In the gay capital where we Hved, and where the great and briUiant of all nations flocked at times, I had already been distinguished for that beauty of which you can scarcely now find any traces, and my life was one enchanted round of triumphant vanity. But a change was at hand. \"Among the fashionable strangers who had sought and gained admittance to my father's house, was one who had but lately arrived in the city. Young, elegant, and accomplished, he soon attracted my atten tion, not so much by these qualities as by another which seemed scarcely calculated to charm a spout child of the world like myself. Courteous, gallant, and fascinating as he was, there was yet an under-current"], [194, "188 VERONIA. of irony in his manner, that showed his spirit was never for one instant influenced or charmed from his own control. Though winning all around him, he himself remained unwon, untouched, and free. My self-love was wounded by this. I had seen older and graver men than he forget their dignity and soften at my glance ; why should he remain proudly serene, and with that mock ing glitter ever in his eye? I would subdue him, he should lie humbled at my feet. Alas ! in the toils spread for another, I was the first ensnared. I loved him, while he still remained indifferent. It is well to blame the woman's heart that yields its love unasked, and to cry shame that it cannot wait coldly until the solemn word is said ; but what would that love be worth that could thus diplomatically calculate the chances of success ? Sad, disgraceful as it may seem, since woman is a human being, there is no remedy ; the world's rule over her deeds can never extend in justice to her thoughts ; but if she would be spared shame, anguish, and mortal degradation, deep in the sanctuary of her own breast let her hide"], [195, "189 VERONIA. them. Yes, I loved him, and the years of unchecked indulgence I had passed, my ardent character, unaccustomed to denial or restraint, betrayed me. How I wrestled with that burning passion none but Heaven ever knew ; how I wept and trembled at the thought that he might guess it, and despise me; how I prayed to die, if the bitter shame of an unsought, disdained affection was to be mine. That agony, in part at least, was spared me. \"It was one evening, at a ball given by the French Ambassador, that my tortured feelings had reached their height, for a con versation, at which I had that morning been present, connected his name with that of one of the wealthiest ladies of the city \u2014 a widow, young,, handsome, and who, in the opinion of all, was waiting only a favourable oppor tunity to assume the honours of matrimony a second time. It was said that his court ship had been crowned with success, that she had accepted him, and their marriage would not be long deferred. The tale seemed probable, for could I doubt that any woman would be insensible to the love of"], [196, "190 VERONIA. him whom / so blindly worshipped ? I threw around a searching, feverish glance on entering the suite of brilHant rooms, in one of which I knew that he would be ; but we had traversed several without having seen him, when I was asked to join the dance just then commencing, and having no pretext for a refusal, I took the offered arm presented to me, and in another moment was in the throng of dancers. Suddenly a well-known voice seU upon my ear ; I glanced instantly in the direction whence it came, and perceived the beautiful widow, and beside her, bending with evident admi ration in his eyes, stood the object of my love. It was true then, I could not doubt it ; the glow of triumph on her cheek, and the deep homage of his manner, both pro claimed it. They were lovers ; and as the conviction reached me, a pain like that of death, sharp as the rending asunder of flesh and spirit, made me turn faint and shudder. Proud, and smiling in the fulness of their own happiness, they swept past me without a look, and I shrank back, scorched, blinded, and like a tree blasted by lightning, fell"], [197, "191 VERONIA, stricken at their feet. But dreadful as was that moment, it was soon forgotten. By what mysterious subtlety he learnt the truth, I know not, but he did learn the secret of my distress, and of the long state of insensibility from which it was feared that I should never waken more. From that day a tenderer ray beamed from his eyes when they rested on me ; a softer smile, a voice more gently subdued, all proved, and at last his own words told, that he loved me. The account of his engagement had been but a fable. He had loved me from the first, but hearing I was hard to please, and greatly courted, had conceived and carried out a scheme to excite my jealousy, and pique me into warmth, of which the fair widow had been the victim. I did not pause then upon the heartlessness of this, I scarcely saw it, for every feeling of my heart, every faculty of my mind, was merged into the one rapturous enjoyment of happy and acknowledged love. It was settled between us that he should ask me of my father the moment that he had obtained the approval of a relative on whom his prospects entirely"], [198, "192 VERONIA. depended, and whom gratitude for past benefits, as well as interest, he said, rendered it imperative to consult ; but he assured me that from this quarter no obstacle was to be feared, as although his relative would un doubtedly oppose his union with a portion less girl, my father's well-known fortune and position would obviate aU such objections. ' And when he knows you, my Veronia,' added he, fondly, ' he will believe what I shall tell him, that to think of adding to your own merits, by the addition of this world's treasure, would be, indeed, like trying to gild refined gold.' \" I listened enchanted, as every woman does, to language such as this, until at last I came to think it must be true, and that I was indeed the angel he described me \u2014 that my existence, as he said, ought to be all joy, all sweetness, all idolatry, and the dream was Heaven while it lasted, yet not such rapture as the awakening was death. What had I done, what had I ever done, to suffer thus? Why did Heaven give me happiness, only to plunge me into deeper woe ? \" ."], [199, "193 VERONIA. \" Oh, stop there, I entreat you, made moiselle,\" here interposed the shocked and tearful Beth, as Veronia, in another access of passionate emotion, cast herself down, as if in terrible despair. \" Blessed Virgin, have compassion on her,\" muttered she, turning devoutly aside to make the sign of redemption \u2014 \" Holy Mother, take pity upon her \u2014 let her not fall eternally into the power of the evil one.\" And then again addressing herself to the distracted narrator, she added, \" Cease, mademoiselle, to rend your heart so sorely ; I have heard enough to make me pity you with all my soul, and to make me pray for you during the remainder of my life. But you must stop now, indeed \" \" No,\" cried Veronia, vehemently, start ing up ; \"I must rather go on. Do you think I could walk silently into yonder dwelHng, with the long hours of night and darkness coming on, and lie calmly down to rest with all the memories now flooding through my brain ?

All, therefore, was full of brightness for the future, and nothing seemed to offer even a chance of disappoint- ment to our hopes.

He stood before his wife and child, trembling, ghastly, the image of shame and desperation, and told the tale.

The father I so loved and had so honoured was now a fallen, degraded man. I might still feel for him affection, but I could never more feel respect, and the pang which only a proud nature can experience pierced me at the thought. I was dwelling painfully on it, when the sound of the open door roused me, and looking round through the gloom, I felt rather than saw, that it was my intended husband. His footstep at any other time had power to banish from my memory all else \u2014 even now it cheered me. I sprang to meet him, and tenderly he drew me to his side.

It was chill, altered, and embarrassed. \" ' Love like mine, Veronia, could not indeed be influenced by such a cause,' said he, ' but, alas ! I am not a free agent. Miserably dependent upon the will of another, by his permission only can I seek your hand, and he may now forbid me to think further of it.' Then as, struck with a feeling of horror, I involuntarily drew back, and struggled to repulse his touch, he said more warmly, 'But why anticipate such evils ? Let us hope still that all may"], [205, "VERONIA. 199 be repaired, for I could not, my beloved, so easily resign you.' \" He rose to leave the room ; a few more words of assumed love fell coldly from his lips, but their meaning was lost upon me ; he kissed my cheek carelessly, dropped my hand coldly, and then departed. \"Long, long afterwards, that sentence, *i\" could not so easily resign you,' was the only one of aU that he had uttered on that miser able night, that I could clearly recall ! Cruel words ! \u2014 mockery of that love which I had believed was to be eternal! They burnt into my soul.\" For a few moments, suffocated by the emotion these memories awakened, Veronia was again silent, then more calmly she resumed : \"Perhaps (if it is true that Heaven meddles with the cares of men) I was favoured, that when the morning dawned, my heart seemed turned to stone. \" Dead \u2014 murdered by his own hand \u2014 my father lay beneath his own roof, a spec tacle of horror to all !

Few compassionated his fate, for pecuniary ruin is one of those things that dry the springs of pity in the hearts of most men, and my father's pride, expressed by a cold haughtiness of manner to society in general, had rendered him unpopular, so that even his widow and child found none to feel for their distress. \" Liugeringly, dismally, passed the days succeeding that one of awe and horror \u2014 like a fearful dream they seemed for ever recommencing, and never likely to end. On me, bewildered and broken-hearted as I was, fell the weight of all, for my mother sank beneath this last stroke, and became dulled to surrounding things. I saw that every eye looked coldly on us, that our portion among men was henceforth to be that of shame.

They spoke of pain which he dreaded to communicate, but suddenly he rose, approached Veronia, and, for the first time in the whole period of their intimacy, seized her hands.

Silence, fit companion to that shadowy hour, hung paU-like over aU ; not a breath, not a sigh, broke the stillness, or spoilt the charm, until suddenly an impatient foot step profanely awoke the echoes of the venerable pavement, and at the same"], [220, "214 VERONIA. moment a stately form entered from a side door, and moved across the edifice. It was that of a young man, belonging evidently to the upper classes of society, evinced not merely by his haughty bearing, but by those indefinable but certain tokens which mark the aristocrat, who lives especially among his equals, and apart from common society, so unmistakably from other men.

Keen, uncompromising scorn curled his fine lip, and shot from an eye which an instant before had been cold and listless. \"This is desperately chilly,\" he muttered, in half audible tones ; \" what can that young fool keep me here waiting for? It is intolerable ; the open street is better \u2014 this place smells of those old mummies, positively ;\" and having worked himself up to this point concerning the worthy per sons whose devotion disgusted him, he passed out of the building by an opposite door to that by which he had entered.

The light outside the church, though failing rapidly, was yet sufficient, as it fell upon the two young men, who now joined, and accosted each other, to show the difference existing between them. The last comer was good looking, well-dressed, and seemingly intelH gent, but belonging as clearly to the citizen class as his companion did to a superior one. \" Excuse me, my dear Monsieur Jules, for not waiting longer, but really those old churches are so damp, that I cannot bear their atmosphere above a few seconds at a time ; that was my reason for leaving it, although the air here is moist enough also. By my faith, it is very different from that of Paris.\" \"The damp affects you disagreeably, I perceive, monsieur,\" answered the other, politely, as his companion, shivering at the evening mists which were now rising, drew his mantle closer round him, and hastened onward. \" Very much so, indeed ; I have always heard that you Belgians have a bad cHmate,"], [223, "217 VERONIA. fine women, fine pictures ; but fevers, rheu matisms, and that sort of thing, into the bargain,\" \" I was not aware of it, monsieur,\" said the Belgian, rather mortified; \"but of course, where there is much water, there must be exhalations from it, and we are approaching a canal at this moment, which is the cause of the sudden moisture of the air ; added to which your long journey, and consequent fatigue, may have chilled you.\" \"Yes, very probably ; I am in fact tired to death, and quite disposed to do honour to Monsieur Bouchard's hospitality; have we still much farther to go, Monsieur Jules?\" \" Julien is my name, monsieur,\" answered the young' man, rather drily ; \"we are arrived ; this is my father's door.\" They had reached a handsome house, standing within gates, and fronted by a square stone court, with a fountain in the centre. Mounting a flight of grey steps, and crossing a vestibule, Julien Bouchard led his father's guest into a large and lofty"], [224, "218 VERONIA. chamber on the ground-floor, the uncom promising stiffness of whose arrangements, though handsome, and not devoid of con tinental comfort, proved it to be the draw ing-room, or apartment set apart for great and rare occasions.

The latter's keen blue eye ran rapidly over the person of his advancing' host, with a stronger look of interest than had yet ap peared there, and a brief survey sufficed to him accurately to note every particular concerning him. Like his son, Monsieur Bouchard, was a good-looking, well-dressed, and agreeable specimen of his class, with a manner, as we"], [225, "219 VERONIA. have before said, rather inclined to be jovial and off-hand, perfectly in keeping with a rather stout person, ruddy cheeks, and very sharp black eyes ; but a close observer would have noticed that there was, perhaps, a shade less of natural ease, and certainly more assumption, in the air of the father than in that of the son, and this difference was brought out more evidently than it would have otherwise been, by the contrast afforded in the calm dignity of his guest's manner, who responded to the lawyer's somewhat fussy demonstrations by a calm poHteness which marked his higher breed ing. Bouchard commenced by an unmeasured amount of apologies for his unavoidable absence until that moment, pointedly al luding to the extraordinary exigencies of his professional duties as being the cause, and regretting also that his son should have detained monsieur on the way, by passing through Saint Jacques. \" I desired him merely to call at a house close to it, where I expected to be at about that hour, hoping thus, monsieur, to enjoy"], [226, "220 VERONIA. the honour of myself escorting you hither ; but it was utterly out of my power, greatly as I desired it, and I fear Julien may have thus kept you waiting.\" During the time occupied by these speeches, Justine had sulkily advanced, and placed the guest a chair, but without ac cording him any further notice ; and his look was stiU resting upon her, with some thing of the fascination with which we sometimes contemplate a singular or unplea sant object, when Madame Bouchard, in a state of silks and ribbons, whose rustling announced her approach long before she was visible, and would have caused Van Helder to faint had he been present, made her appearance. She cast an angry look upon her daugh ter's unseemly toilet, which consisted of a tumbled morning gown, of an indescribable mixture of violent colours, in which yeUow strongly predominated.

Then, to her daughter, who had paid no attention to the strong hint conveyed in her former look, she said decisively \u2014 \"You have, I see, forgotten the hour, Justine \u2014 go quickly, and change your dress.\" A reply rose to the latter's Hp, but a look frorh her father seemed to repress it, and she silently left the room. \"I must entreat you to excuse my daughter, monsieur,\" said the lady; \" but Justine is not an ordinary character at all \u2014 her talents are reaUy wonderful, she is, in deed, head-worker in her father's office, and all the accounts, however complicated, pass through her hand \u2014 therefore, you see \" \"My dear,\" here interrupted Monsieur"], [228, "222 VERONIA. Bouchard, with a look of vexation, \" mon sieur must require some refreshment, and cannot interest himself in family details ; will you let us have supper ?\" She took the hint, and in a few moments they were seated in the dining-room at a substantial repast. Whether it was that the fatigue of his journey had told upon his nerves, or from some other cause, the traveller's spirits drooped suddenly, and the air of gentle vivacity with which a few moments before he had seemed disposed to enter into con versation, perceptibly deserted him ; he sank into a languid silence and abstraction, varied only by occasional and stealthy glances at Justine, who, having joined the party, was now seated opposite to him, but on her part, however, seemed scarcely cog nizant of his presence. She had assumed a dress of a hard blue colour, trimmed \u2014 re lieved, we believe, would be the profes sional term \u2014 by a sharp pink, and her charms, thus contrasted, had gained little by the absence of the before-mentioned yellow, but in one particular a decided improve-"], [229, "VERONIA. 223 ment had taken place. Soap, water, and a comb had fulfilled their mission, and her complexion was some shades lighter, her hair less tangled. \" What execrable taste ! \" thought the Parisian, as his glance returned again and again, attracted painfully towards her, \"and what an eye ! Is it grey, green, or stone colour ? Impossible to say, for it seemed each alternately.

Madame Bouchard and her daughter re ceived their visitor with due ceremony in the drawing-room when his host led the way thither, and Justine's observant eye marked that, in the brief interval of their absence, there was already an indefinable difference in the manner with which her father addressed his aristocratic guest, something in short that proved to her that on one side or the other a few of the inter vening steps on that social ladder which separated their stations had been virtually diminished between them.

The question of what would be the pro bable fate of mankind, in the case of the promulgators of the rights of women ever so far accomplishing their designs as to gain for them admittance to the legal body, formed the subject of the lawyer's cogita tions as he meditatively descended the private staircase leading to his office ; and so dreadful was the conclusion at which he arrived, that he shivered at the picture which it brought before him. He paused a moment as he reached the door, and stood with his hand upon the lock, as, by some mysterious effect of the"], [237, "231 VERONIA. law of mental association, the working of his reflections produced a sudden thought, the nature of which was the more sur prising, as their current had seemed to tend another way.

A hot conviction of success here took possession of him, a glow of pride in his anticipated triumph, not aU peculiar to the legal mind, and, with a sudden movement, the door-handle turned within his grasp. Justine looked up as her father appeared, half surprised at the impetuosity of his entrance, for \u2014 as has been observed by the genius of De Balzac \u2014 a man's step will sometimes betray his state of feeling as clearly as his voice, and the quick ear of Monsieur Bouchard's daughter instantly noted in her father's footfaU an unaccus tomed something which attracted her atten tion towards him. Seated at his desk, she had been occu pied with some calculations entrusted to her, but as they were just finished she rose on seeing him, resigning her seat with the same ungracious air habitual to her. Unlike his usual self, he took it silently, and seeming not to notice the accomplished task which lay before it. Justine seemed sur-"], [239, "233 VERONIA. prised, but, without remark, she quietly took it up and commenced its perusal, in the dry, husky tone, and with the profes sional accent which appeared to have been born with her. \" My dear,\" to her utter astonishment said the lawyer, as she paused, on reaching the conclusion of a long statement of accounts elaborately drawn out, of which he had not heard one word, and absently extending his hand to take the paperfrom her own \u2014 \" your mother has just discovered that she would Hke to have Monsieur de Boisvante\" as a son-in-law \u2014 what say you to it?\" The proposed bride seemed to think her father struck with sudden mania, for she looked at him with a scowl of suspicion, and resolutely opposed the gesture he made to take posession of her work ; but as he responded only by a smile, and by balancing his chair to and fro with a kind of rocking movement, peculiar to his moments of satisfaction, while nibbling the office ruler, she contemptuously recom menced her reading."], [240, "234 VERONIA. \" You are a clever girl, my dear,\" said the complacent father, as she finished, and once more raised to his her sombre, watchful glance \u2014 \" a very clever girl, and it is only a pity you belong to the wrong sex, for a first-rate lawyer you would have made, and, \u2014 but it is no use lamenting over what cannot be helped ; nor, indeed, would there be anything in it to regret, were you disposed to climb the ladder I am wiUing to hold for you \u2014 it isn't steep \u2014 it isn't dangerous \u2014 it isn't impossible in any way, and as to difficult, why nothing is difficult, where there is money enough to carry it through.\" \" Hush !\" cried she, briefly, as he pro nounced the concluding words, and half turning towards the outer office door, which was fast shut. The sound of a foot step had arrested her attention, and darting forward, she opened it quickly ; but with a sudden assumed impassibility upon her features, calculated to deceive any one who should meet her on its threshold. \" Are the clerks not yet come ?\" asked she, sharply, of an old woman who was lighting the stove ; \" reaUy those good-for-"], [241, "235 VERONIA. nothings get worse and worse \u2014 here have I been at work above half an hour, and my father is asking for them.\" \" Mademoiselle is always so fuU of zeal,\" said the servant, in humble accents. \"There, there \u2014 that will do,\" resumed Justine ; \" fire enough and to spare for such as they ; and if the walls are damp,\" \u2014 for it was this that necessitated fire, even at that season, in the apartment, \u2014 \" well, it is only what a couple of such rats deserve ;\" and pushing the old woman out of the chamber, she shut the door tightly that communicated with the passage beyond, and then re-entered the inner office. His daughter's absence had meanwhile given Monsieur Bouchard time to make some re flections, and combine his tactics He saw that he had broached the subject too abruptly. He had not lived thirty years as a lawyer, without acquiring some of that insight into human hearts and motives, which the law is, perhaps of all professions, best calculated to give, and this acquirement at the present moment served him fully. \"Justine,\" he thought, \"is at that age when"], [242, "236 VERONIA. every single woman most keenly feels the disadvantages of her position. Later, habit would make them probably a matter of indifference, and she would settle down with resignation to a lot to which she would see many like herself subjected. \" Now it is not so ; the companions of her youth are all either married or striving to be so, and succeeding, like Jeannette Morin, whom I heard of this morning ; naturally my girl feels jealous, irritated, and dis satisfied ; this makes her sensitive upon the subject of matrimony, and fearful lest any undue anxiety concerning it should be imputed to her. Of course she would wish to have it supposed that she disdains the other sex, and would not on any con sideration relent towards them. To bring her to the desired point, therefore, I must appear as believing as all the rest of the world ; and with regard to her success, if she once undertakes the business, I reaUy think Madame Bouchard is right, and that, when women make up their minds to have a victim, it's a done thing !

I wonder how the new client would like all his affairs entrusted to them, or such as they?\" Monsieur Bouchard noted that she spoke as if it had been really the gentle man's interests he had been discussing, and not her own ; and it confirmed him in the view he had just taken. He adopted a new plan accordingly \" You are right, my dear ; I was at fault, certainly,\" said he, composedly, \" the more so, as I was on the point of disclosing particulars relating to this young man of the last importance ; but we are safe now, for the next ten minutes at least, as it has not struck nine, and none of my clerks are ever before their time ; so sit down, Justine, and let us take advantage of a quiet moment.\" She obeyed in sUence, and the speaker"], [244, "238 VERONIA. saw, in the half glance which he directed towards her, that the bait had taken. He continued : \"You are the only person, my dear child, with whom I have ever shared the secrets of my business ; to your good mother, of course, it would be out of all rule and reason that they should be communicated, and almost equally so that I should make my clerks the confidants of more than abso lute necessity required they should know. To you, however, as the partner of my labours, and the person in whom, next to myself, I have the most unbounded con fidence, it is only natural and just I should disclose them. And you will acknowledge, Justine, I have ever done so.\" She nodded grimly, but without compro mising herself by a word ; and apparently aware he must be content with this reply, Monsieur Bouchard went on. \"The calculation which you have just completed,\" said he, taking up the paper from his desk, \"relates to Monsieur de Boisvante\"s affairs. It is, in fact, the schedule of those debts under which he is"], [245, "239 VERONIA. at this moment burdened \u2014 above a hundred thousand francs, as I perceive.

This uncle, having never married, and being consequently without heirs of the body, the young man had grown up with the persuasion, of one day coming into undisputed possession of all his relatives' worldly possessions \u2014 and under this persuasion has given more than one post-obit on the future, besides incurring debts to the amount referred to \u2014 when, suddenly, to add to his disquietude, he learns that there exists, or did exist, a per son having stiU stronger claims upon his uncle's fortune than himseU, and to whom the latter bears at least a kindly feeling,"], [246, "240 VERONIA. though they have been separated for many years.

Each village has, or had, its confraternity of archers, or cross-bow men, known under the title of the \"pledged ones,\" who assemble at these feasts, in procession, bear ing flags, and headed by musicians. The prizes accorded to their success are usually silver hearts, &c, &c, which the"], [254, "248 VERONIA. winners carry solemnly to the church, and deposit there. In the towns, the feasts differ somewhat, occurring, generally, at the time of the principal fair. Before the revolution they were always opened by the clergy and the civil authorities in procession, and were celebrated by representations of gigantic men and animals in effigy. Of these northern feasts, that of Douai takes place each year, on the nearest Sun day to the 7th of July. It is distinguished by the appearance of \" Gayant,\" a gigantic figure constructed of osier, surmounted by a wooden head, carved and painted, says tradition, by Rubens. The giant was forbidden to appear under the Consulate, but restored to his ancient dignity at the period of the Reign of Terror. Under the Empire, \" Gayant \" and his wife \u2014 another figure which always accompanied him \u2014 were habited in the classic style, the former retaining, notwithstanding his im mense wig, large ear-rings, and mou stachios. The cortege was preceded by drums"], [255, "VERONIA. 249 and fifes, playing the air of \" Gayant,\" the \"Rantz des Vaches\" of Flanders, so to speak, which it is impossible for a Douaisien to hear without emotion. Lille had also its feasts, the principal of which had been instituted by Marguerite, Countess of Flanders, in 1269, besides a no less celebrated one, called the \"Joute de I'epinnette,\" dating from 1220, at which the Counts of Flanders never failed to be pre sent. The feasts of Valenciennes and Cam bray were no less remarkable, as exempli fications of the spirit of a past age ; but to none of these, it is hardly necessary to say, was the \" Kermesse \" of our Curb's village to be compared. At this, as Madame Bouchard had justly termed it, rural feast, the cere\" monies were as follows : All the parishioners assembled to hear a high mass, celebrated by their head clergy man, assisted, if such there were, by his vicars, and other clergy. After Divine Service, aU proceeded to witness the sports of the day. At the con clusion of which, every house became the"], [256, "250 VERONIA. theatre of hospitality to the many strangers and friends drawn thither by the occasion. The Presbytery, of course, took a leading part in these festivities, throwing open its doors to the neighbouring clergy, their re latives, friends, and, in short, all those re spectable strangers or parishioners who chose to profit by the opportunity- We shall now turn from the lawyer's house, and see what was going on in that of his vener able brother-in-law. From earliest morning had Godensca's usually wan features been in a glow, excited by the fever of her mind, relating to the preparations devolving on her, as well as the re-action from her unparalleled exertions in the scouring, scrubbing, and cooking line during the previous week. Added to these circumstances, was the still more agitating one \u2014 doubtless to be attributed to the ardent imagination with which, as we have shown, she was gifted \u2014 of her having dreamt over again, during the night, all that she had consummated each day, and it will, we think, need no further argument to convince the reader"], [257, "251 VERONIA. that Godensca was in a state bordering upon delirium. Beth, having tendered her services, as a matter of course, on the occasion, was ho vering about, pale silent, and not a little awe-struck at her position ; answering only by monosyUables, and at long intervals, to Godensca's rapid Flemish discourses, which trouble she might have spared herself al together, as, being chiefly addressed to the furniture, kitchen utensils, or domestic ani mals which crossed her path, and delivered, as we have said, under the influence of no trifling degree of mental excitement, the latter never expected to have them answered, and would certainly never have noticed their not being so. \" Twelve of the clock ! \" said she, at length, in a lugubrious tone, as the hour sounded from the church tower \u2014 then turn ing towards her silent companion, as if suddenly restored to lucidity by the deep solemnity of the moment, \" Go, Beth Van neker, and see that all is right upon the tables.\" Timidly, and with downcast eyes, the"], [258, "252 VERONIA. sedate maiden, in obedience to this behest, demurely made her way into the now crowded parlour, where the company, seated in groups, a score of strangers and others, about the half of whom were clergy, stood talking in the subdued and rather business-like tone which men are apt to assume a short time previous to being called to dinner. No one noticed her by either word or greeting, excepting her brother Karel \u2014 the young vicar \u2014 who good-naturedly but seriously pointed out to her notice some trifling error in the ar rangements, and, a Httle re-assured, Beth proceeded to take up from the kitchen the immense tureen of soup which Godensca had meanwhile removed from the stove, where it had been simmering since day break. The meal was over, the coffee drunk, and all traces of both removed, when Monsieur Bouchard and his son Julien, accompanied by Monsieur de Boisvante\", arrived at the Presbytery, and encountering Van Helder, who was lighting his pipe in the garden, were \u2014 after some few words of introduction"], [259, "VERONIA. 253 had been pronounced, and the Frenchman had duly accomplished his mission by the delivery of his relative's letter \u2014 conducted to the Cure's presence.

No lover of nature for its own sake was de Boisvante, but as he seated himself in the cool arbour to which their host led them, and felt the air stir gently around, charged with the perfume of the climbing briar and honeysuckle, he realized for one brief instant, and by virtue of the force of con trast, some of her charms. Van Helder, who had himseU retreated thither for the purpose of smoking his usual after-dinner pipe, now joined the group and politely offered the Frenchman a cigar, which was, however, declined. \" So you do not smoke, monsieur ? \" said the unceremonious Doctor, rather contemp tuously ; \" I should like to see whether you will adhere to that rule twenty years hence.\" \" Impossible to say, monsieur, what a person may come to when his best faculties are beginning to fail him,\" was the super cilious reply. \" Diantre ! \u2014 do you mean to say, then, that I am superannuated ? \" asked Van Helder, rather fiercely. \" Ta, ta,\" interposed the Cure\" ; \" mon sieur means nothing but that he doesn't"], [262, "256 VERONIA. smoke ; don't bring the heat of the weather into this cool retreat, Jean, I beg.\" And the speaker laughed good-naturedly at his own allusion. The arrival of Beth Vanneker with a tray of refreshments put a stop to the conversation, if such it could be called, and once more the stranger's surprise was called forth, but this time with more amusement than disgust. A bottle of cool \" Bordeaux \" being placed before him, and an immense can of beer before his companions, the vicar's sister presented them with the crowning dainty of the day, consisting of a plate heaped full of thick slices of coarse plum-cake, between each of which was a substantial sHce of ham. Of this, being \" Kermesse \" fare, every guest was expected to partake, and again Van Helder's glance expressed decided con tempt, as the Frenchman suffered it to pass him untouched, while accepting readily the beverage of his own country. \" You have come a long distance, I sup pose, monsieur ?\" said the host, hospitably replenishing his glass."], [263, "257 VERONIA. \" Indeed, no,\" was the reply, \" only from Paris.\" \" Onlv from Paris ! \" laughed the Cure, \" what would our ancestors have thought of that speech ? Ah ! monsieur, the world has made strange strides in the last half century ; how different from the times of the good monks of Ferriers.\" \" What about them ?\" asked Van Helder, abruptly. \" Why,\" answered the priest, nothing loath to repeat the story, \" it happened in the eleventh century, that certain monks inhabiting an abbey of that name, found it necessary for the transaction of some busi ness relating to their order that they should communicate with certain other monks, inhabiting the place called Tournay, in Flanders. The Abbey of Ferriers was situated within the limits of the diocese of Sens, and how to proceed from thence to Tournay was so great a problem, to its brotherhood that it was only after two years of indefatigable research and inquiry they succeeded in solving it, and reaching VOL. i. s"], [264, "258 VERONIA. the abode of their Tournai' brethren, who, meanwhile had been in similar perplexity concerning them.\" \"Good, excellent,\" exclaimed Bouchard and Van Helder for once in accordance, while De Boisvante\" smiled politely, as in duty bound. \" Served them right for their folly in being monks at all, say I,\" added the former contemptuously, in which senti ment the Frenchman united by a glance in the direction of the speaker. Mean while, still more intense had been the enjoyment of the company assembled in Godensca's department. This included, besides the vicar's two sisters, about a dozen distinguished female parishioners, foremost of whom was the wife of the village schoolmaster, and head chorister of the church, who formed, at that mo ment, one of the card-playing party in the parlour.

Slipping away accord ingly from the arbour, he marched up the garden walk, and, though very doubtful of his reception as Godensca's guest, presented himself modestly at the threshold of her domain. \" Isn't there parlour and garden room enough for you, that you must needs come here ! \" exclaimed she, fiercely, as the Doctor peeped cautiously from behind the door. \" Poisoning us all with that pipe of yours, too, when you know Meinheer Pastor can't bear it the first day of ' Ker messe,' at all.\" \" Indeed, Godensca, I have left my pipe in the garden,\" replied he, submissively, \" but I am so thirsty ; would you allow Fraulein Beth to give me a drink of coffee and a sugar-ball ?\" \" Ah, I daresay ! always some excuse,\" said Godensca, somewhat mollified however by the humble manner in which the request was s2"], [266, "260 VERONIA. made, and proceeding to gratify it imme diately. \" How nice ! you do make good coffee, Godensca,\" said Van Helder, hypocritically, while sipping the liquid, and rolHng about in his mouth the sugar-ball, which it is usual in that country to use in this manner instead of sugar. \" So pleasant, too, to drink in the society of ladies, instead of supping up beer with the men, yonder; may I sit down ? \" \" Now, Meinheer Doctor Van Helder, if you begin any mockery here,\" commenced the Queen of the feast, severely \u2014 but a knock at the kitchen door interrupted her at this juncture, and the Doctor started up gleefully, on perceiving, as it opened, the form of Jacques Henricart. \"Ah!

My compliments and kind wishes to the De M^huls, if you go there, and I will see them later myself\u2014 adieu,\" and with a wave of the hand, Van Helder withdrew, con siderably annoyed at what he considered Henricart's obstinacy, and want of good fellowship, on so important an occasion. He paused for a moment to look in at the parlour door in passing, and then, pre ferring the air outside, bent his steps again towards the arbour. \" Any cases of apoplexy yet among the card-players ? \" asked Bouchard, with his jovial laugh, as Van Helder again joined the party. \" Not yet, they are in a sort of vapour bath at present, and not therefore in any immediate danger,\" answered he, in the same spirit, while even De Boisvante\" smiled."], [269, "263 VERONIA. \" I think that a rural life has some very decided advantage over a city one,\" said the latter, with that slight shade of con descension in his manner, with which he addressed everyone\" but the lawyer. \" In Paris, for instance, a professor of the healing art, Hke Monsieur Van Helder, can never yield himself to the charms of society for an hour at a time, without being called away for some urgent case or other.\" \"And for the very good reason,\" replied the Doctor, \" that his servant has orders to pursue him from house to house, with fictitious messages of a pressing nature, for the purpose of impressing society with the notion of his extended and successful practice.\" \"Is it possible ! what a gulf of deception is the world,\" sighed the priest. \" Bah ! \" exclaimed Van Helder, \" that's nothing, and we are certainly not the worst of the lot. Ask \u25a0 the lawyers if they never play any of these Httle tricks; ay, Bouchard, what say you ? \" \" Why, that if everybody had their due, you would be proved to have much less"], [270, "264 VERONIA. clean hands than we should,\" said the lawyer; colouring slightly ; not perhaps so much from the effects of conscience, as that of the warm weather, on his sanguine tem perament. At all events we never poison or mutilate our clients, when we don't know what else to do for them ! \" \" Neither does the Doctor Van Helder,\" interposed the simple Cure, warmly. \" How, indeed, but for him, my poor parish would ever look up after its periodical invasions of fever, I know not ; and that it does so, I must attribute under the blessing of God, to his care and skiU only.\" \" Oh ! nonsense, Paul \u2014 all that I do is to second the efforts of nature, instead of counteracting them, as the usual practice is, and if my efforts are crowned with success, it is as much as anything owing to the faith of my patients, and their docility in following the few directions I give them,\" was Van Helder's blunt rejoinder to his friend's praises. \" Ah ! you manage them, I suppose, on the same principle that Doctor Thibaut did his sick?\" here observed Bouchard, with"], [271, "265 VERONIA. the air of having a story to tell, which instantly imposed upon Van Helder, who, unsuspicious of the lawyer's meaning, asked eagerly for it. \"Well then,\" said the latter, 'maliciously directing a glance around the party, calcu lated to draw the attention of all to his speech. \" The Due de Rohan, being taken ill while travelling in Switzerland, sent for the most celebrated doctor of the canton, whose name was Thibaut. After some conversation, the Doctor told the Duke confidentiaUy, that he had formerly been a farrier in his stables. ' I have now a great reputation as a physician,' said he ; ' but the fact is, that I treat the Swiss as I used to do your grace's horses, and find that I generally succeed with them very well !' \" The peal of genuine Flemish laughter which greeted this anecdote, so exasperated Van Helder by drowning entirely all his attempts at a reply, that he turned away, and while puffing angrily at his pipe, strode some paces up the garden walk, to mark his sense of the wrong."], [272, "266 VERONIA. He was met by Jacques Henricart, who, on second thoughts, had returned, partly to soothe the Doctor's wounded feelings con cerning his refusal to join in the festivities of the day, and partly with the ulterior motive of begging some flowers for Veronia. \" Back again, Jacques !\" exclaimed Van Helder, haU crossly, on perceiving him, \" I thought you had set off for the De Mehuls?\" \" So I had, Doctor,\" was the reply, in a conciliatory tone ; \" but my conscience became reproachful for having yielded to the black mood that was on me ; I did not mean to be ungracious, my friend, in refus ing to join your party, and in proof of it, I am ready to drink your beer, and break the ' Kermesse ' cake with you, on the spot, if your host will receive me ; but I have been looking vainly in the parlour \u2014 can you lead me to him ?\" \"To the Cure? \u2014 to be sure \u2014 the more the merrier, is the word with him on these days ; so come along, Kobe, my boy, since you are returned to your senses \u2014 this way ; he is in the arbour.\" Determined, if the"], [273, "267 VERONIA. sacrifice was to be made, that it should at least be accompHshed gracefully, and in the courteous manner of a Frenchman, Henricart obeyed, resolved to shake off the sort of fore boding sadness which, as he had told the Doctor, had been weighing upon his heart uuaccountably all day, and infusing into his air as much gaiety as he could assume at the moment, he followed Van Helder's footsteps to the summer-house, and presented himself smUingly to its occupants. Although by no means particularly a distinguished favourite at the Presbytery, or one whom its venerable master often encouraged to visit there \u2014 for the sole reason that his conduct, and it was suspected his opinions also, in religious matters, were lax \u2014 yet as his grave manners, and discrete language, when received there, left nothing to reproach him with further, and as Van Helder's friendship for him was well known, the Cure, immediately on seeing him, stretched forth the hand of good fellowship and welcome, at the same time making room for him at the bench beside himself. \" You are come in time to empty a bottle"], [274, "268 VERONIA. of your own Bordeaux with a compatriot, Monsieur Henricart,\" said the priest, pleas antly, nodding towards De Boisvante^ who, seated opposite the place which Jacques had just accepted, had been speaking to some one on the other side of him, and so had not observed the new guest's entrance. He turned now, on being addressed, how ever, and their looks met. In another in stant Henricart had risen to his feet, stiff, livid, and ghastly, with some sudden and terrible emotion. Eloquent of horror were his fixed eyes, set jaw, and bloodless aspect. He seemed to be living over again some dreadful passage of a deeply graven past, reflected back to him from the scarcely less agitated features of the man before him. A corpse-like dew and pallor sat upon the fair brow of De Boisvante \u2014 a convulsive quiver trembled on his lips, and his cool, confident glance had fallen earthward, scared by the deadly influence of that ap palling recognition. For a brief moment, thus confronted, the two Frenchmen remained, as if paralyzed by one common shock ; then Jacques"], [275, "VERONIA. 269 Henricart it was who broke the spell. \" Dastard ! \" hissed he, through his clenched teeth ; \" we shall meet again ! \" and, without another word, look, or ges ture to any one person present, he sprang away down the pathway, cleared at a bound the hedge terminating the garden, and was out of sight before the astonished Flemings had scarcely drawn breath, or realized the scene that had just passed before them."], [276, "270 CHAPTER XVI. It was early morning; so early that the hamlet lay still calm and slumbering be neath the sun's first beams, which had not yet had time to dry the dew-besprinkled heads of its pastor's daliahs and china-asters, between two glowing beds of which he was, nevertheless, chaplet in hand, al ready stirring. Even Godensca, like the world around her, stiU reposed, for, half maddened by black coffee, smoke, society, the cares of office, and a score of other brain-exciting causes of the previous day, exhaustion, fortunately for her future sanity, had supervened, and led to \"Nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep.\""], [277, "271 VERONIA.

He looked up, with a startled exclamation, on seeing it was Van Helder who stood before him. \"Hush, Cure I\" was the latter's greeting, as he approached him quietly ; \" don't speak so loud, we may be overheard, and I have come to talk with you, over a matter of great importance ; \" and his haggard features looked, indeed, so pale, and doubly careworn, that his friend saw instantly how serious must be his mission. \" It is so early yet, that there is, I think, no danger, Jean, of listeners being abroad,"], [278, "272 VERONIA. but if you fear it, come into the house,\" said the priest, turning resignedly from the fresh breeze he had been so enjoying, and leading the way back to his own dweU ing. \"Dear me, how the smoke of yesterday still pervades the atmosphere,\" said he, ap proaching to open a window, when they had crept noiselessly to the kitchen, and closed the door. \" I must let in some air, Jean, or I fear I shall turn sick.\" \"No, no,\" rejoined the Doctor, peremp torily ; \"you must do nothing of the kind ; that window creaks outrageously whenever it is touched, and if Godensca hears it she will be down upon us in a moment. You must really bear to feel sick for the occa sion ; charity demands the sacrifice \u2014 the pastor's watchword, as you often tell me. So patience now, and listen.\" \" I hear you, Jean,\" replied the poor priest, rather piteously. \" Your business is, I guess, connected with the strange scene of last night \u2014 am I correct ? \" \" Precisely so, you saw what passed here, but that, surprising as it was, com-"], [279, "273 VERONIA. prised the least part of the affair. The rest was even stranger. It so confused and frightened me on Henricart's account, that I have not closed my eyes in sleep one mo ment through the night, and the result of my reflections was that I would come off, Cure*, and see you, before taking any step on my own responsibility or judgment. Do you understand me ? \" \"So far; but proceed, I beg you.\" \" Well, then, a short time after the de monstration of last night, which so startled us, I slipped away, as you may have re marked, and thinking it probable that, in his then state of excitement, Henricart would scarcely have sought any other society for the evening, I set off in the direction of his own dwelling, and, as I had anticipated, there found him. He was walking up and down before the door, and in a state of agitation, which some very powerful motive only could have produced in a man of his grave temper and general seU-possession. He did not perceive me until I was close upon him, and then looked up with the shuddering start of a maniac, VOL. I. T"], [280, "274 VERONIA. which appalled me. I spoke to him, calmly at first, then more earnestly, as I took his hand, but he snatched it from me, as if the contact of mine distracted him, and made me a frantic gesture to depart. I obeyed, so far as to retire from him, coolly lit my pipe at the threshold of his dwelling, and then unceremoniously went in, and prepared to await the conclusion of his strange mood. For a good hour I watched him, through the open door, pace still up and down, and noted every change that passed across his features, every glance of his eye. At length his step slackened, the rigid tension of his muscles was yielding to physical fatigue ; it was by this time too dusky for me to see clearly his features, but a certain alteration in the outline of his figure gave me indication sufficient, and when his arms, which had been hitherto sharply crossed upon his breast, fell at last wearily down, I felt satisfied that the fever of his senses had given way. In another moment he was in the house, and seemed as much surprised on seeing me as if he had entirely forgotten having already done so."], [281, "275 VERONIA. \" ' You here, Doctor ? ' he said, as I rose to greet him, and put my own pipe into his hands with as unconcerned an air as I could assume, while I sought about for another to replace it, carefully avoiding all the time too particularly to notice him. \" ' You here ; pray when did you come? ' \" ' Oh ! not long ago,' said I, quietly ; ' I saw you were discomposed this evening, and left the Presbytery to see if I could be of any service to you. You will have con fidence, my good Jacques, in your friend, and tell him the cause of your annoyance, surely ? ' \" ' Annoyance ! ' he answered, sharply ; ' pshaw ! Doctor, you know not what you are talking about,' and he burst forth into a fit of nervous laughter, which alarmed me again. \" ' WeU then,' I answered, as soothingly as possible, 'grief, anger, indignation, my dear fellow, or whatever it might be ; I don't wish to pry into your secrets, but there are occasions when a trouble is lightened by being shared with some one, as I am ready, Jacques, like a good comrade, t 2"], [282, "276 VERONIA. to share this, or any other with you, unless, indeed, you think me unworthy of the trust ?

' said he, with energy ; ' I owe to you the only happy moments of the last two years, but no more in this life can I own a friend, no more may my hand touch those of honest men, for it is dedicated to a crime ; already in intention stained with blood.' \" \" Great Heaven ! \" exclaimed the Cure\", as Van Helder paused in his recital ; \" and this wretch, this murderer, we have har boured among us. Have I not repeatedly warned you, Jean, against the danger of trusting to a man of his principles ? \u2014 can"], [283, "277 VERONIA. anything be more dreadful, more sanguin ary?\" \" Ah ! \" responded Van Helder, with bitterness; \"yes, that is Christian justice; judge a man on any evidence that tends against him, and condemn him even before that is complete. Go on, Monsieur le Cure\", carry out that principle, and see how many of your own parishioners are worthy the absolution you are called on so frequently to bestow.\" \"Enough, Jean, or I can listen to you no further,\" said the priest, severely ; \" what more about this wretched man ? If it is any counsel you seek concerning him, you can scarcely doubt, I think, what it must be ; leave him, let all communion cease between you, and may God have mercy upon him ! \" \"Exactly what the judge says when he is condemning a fellow-creature to death,\" was Van Helder's sarcastic reply ; \" and before doing so, even he pleads for the wretch the full benefit of a doubt ; would it not be well in us to imitate this judicial charity sometimes, think you, Cure? \""], [284, "278 VERONIA. \" Well, well,\" replied the latter, \" as you will ; but I am anxious for the conclusion of your story, for time is passing, and on these festival days, the house, you know, fills early, and the vicar's mass will ring in half an hour, when I must leave ycu.\" \"True, we must profit by the few remain ing moments, my friend, as you do well to remind me, for everything depends on coming to a quick decision, before it is too late. To sum up, then, in a word, all my efforts to draw from Henricart the cause of his agony of mind, and the vengeful feeling to which it had given birth, proved unavail ing. I left him, convinced that, unless some measures are taken to prevent it, the passion by which his reason is now obscured will drive him to the commission of a crime of which Monsieur de Boisvante will be the victim.\" As the priest's only comment was a gesture of horror, Van Helder continued : \"When I returned hither, which, unknown to you, I did, it was past eleven o'clock, and your assemblage were departing by the front door. I came round, therefore, and"], [285, "279 VERONIA. stepped quietly over the garden hedge, wishing to avoid them, and, if possible, have a few words with you before return ing home.

Another instant enHghtened me. \" ' These sort of secrets are awkward pro perty, particularly, as in this instance, when they are shared with the very person of aU others from whom it is most essential they should have been kept.

As for the Duke's object in the affair, I cannot say that I see precisely what it may be ; but from the tone of his letters I should judge that some very deep feeling, akin more nearly to grief or to remorse than any other, seems to actuate him.\" \" And of this his ambassador is aware, I presume ?\" \" That I can answer with no certainty, as I can trace no absolute confirmation of it in his letters. In the last, which was pre sented to me by De Boisvante, yesterday, he merely thanks me for my introduction to Bouchard, and states that, as the former has offered to undertake the journey to Belgium (this being the dead season in Paris, when the young man usually, like most Parisians, takes a trip northward or southward as the case may be), he doubts not that, between the lawyer and himself, the search will be successfully prose cuted, so as to spare me any further trouble.\""], [289, "283 VERONIA. \" A most perplexing business altogether,\" observed the Cure\", as his friend concluded, \" and what advice to give you I am at a loss.

The priesthood is not apt to be so shy of meddling, if the world speaks true.\" \"And because the world says this, and sometimes with justice,\" answered the Cure, meekly, \" it behoves us to be prudent, and give as little cause as possible for scandal. Ah ! Jean, you little know the difficulties of our path.\" \" Well, then, if you refuse me the benefit of your counsel I must act without it,\" said Van Helder, decidedly ; \" and as the first thing to be done is to prevent Henricart from rushing on a frightful destiny, the only step which presents itself to me as likely to accomplish that object must be"], [290, "284 VERONIA. resorted to without delay.

On the evening of the same day Jacques Henricart stood deep in thought upon the threshold of his own poor dwelling. Before him stretched a landscape flat and dreary, bounded to the north by sandhills, whose only vegetation was here and there a fringe of lank, coarse grass or solitary thistle. To the east lay a long tract of level, swampy land, rich in nothing but mias matic exhalations, while to the west wound silently away the turgid waters of a dank"], [293, "VERONIA 287 canal, proceeding towards the parish of St. Andrews, which lay southward. Over this uninviting prospect looked down a bitter, mournful sky \u2014 black, but not stormy, yet chiU and sullen as the low, bleak wind which crept complainingly above all. The Southern's eye dwelt sadly on the scene, and as he looked he sighed, like one whom its gloomy influence oppressed. Perhaps had his thoughts flown back to days of glowing sunshine and youthful wanderings amid the vine-clad hills of his own beloved land ; perhaps, stung by the contrast, was fancy whispering of the per fumed breeze that hour was wont there to awaken, and the sounds of mirth and music borne upon it, announcing how joyous day was melting into moonlight scarce less glorious, and human hearts were kindling to all its soft delights. But no, it was not of these things the Frenchman thought ; swept from his soul aU memory of former glad ness, its every faculty of calling up such dreams was merged in the sadder one of dwelling, with a thousand-fold intensity, upon the cruel present."], [294, "288 VERONIA. Dreary as was the landscape now before his sight, chill as the breeze thaf. hurried whispering past, more dreary and more cold yet lay his heart within him. Where were now the wild fancy, and the passion to dare all, of the previous night? Had they flown like phantoms before the light of day, or shrunk away, quelled by the sug gestions of fear? Such weakness could Jacques Henricart's nature never know ; and yet his spiritless demeanour might, to a stranger's eye, have justified the doubt. Listlessly he drew from his breast a letter, and bent despond in gly over its contents. They ran as follows : \" Mr DEAR GOOD JACQUES, \"The soldier who deserts his post, not only draws upon himself the reprobation of society, but carries with him the burden of an offended conscience, and ceaseless prick ings of remorse. \" I am like that soldier, yet, more for tunate than he. a comrade may stand, while I am absent, in my place, and take from"], [295, "VERONIA. 289 my mind, in part, the trying consciousness of duties left undone. \" You are the friend, Jacques, to whom, in this dilemma, I must turn : faith in your honour, confidence in your good heart, assure me that you wiU accept the charge, however painful at this moment to yourself.

Adieu, then, for the present, my dear Jacques, with thanks and good wishes from your ever true and faithful friend, \" Jean Fortune Van Helder.\" \" Mysterious ! this unexpected absence,\" murmured Henricart, as he refolded the letter. \" By what relentless malice, too, fate should at this moment weave such a chain around me, is inconceivable !

Can I feel that she is deserted, sad, crushed under such impending misery, and volun tarily leave her to her fate ?

Evening was fast closing in, and still more dark and gusty it became. Henri cart felt that, having lingered all the day, it would not do to delay longer ; and having secured the entrance to his dwelling against the possible intrusion of strangers during his absence, he now turned his foot- u2"], [298, "292 VERONIA. steps in the direction of the De Mehuls' cottage. He had completed about half the distance when he suddenly remembered the enclosed letter for Veronia, which he had laid aside, and afterwards forgotten to take up, and, knowing that it would seem strange to pre sent himself without it, though aware of the loss of time he would thereby incur, he deliberately turned back. Half an hour was spent in a fruitless search, for in the tumult of thought and feeling he had passed through since receiv ing it, as was not surprising, he had entirely forgotten where it had been placed. At length, however, it was found, and hastily securing it in his breast-pocket, he again set off upon his mission. By this time darkness had come on, and would have prevailed entirely, but for the sickly gleams of a pale, watery moon. Henricart shivered as he glanced up at her, and then his mind reverted to the moon light of his own more favoured land. He thought, too, of the evening skies which he had looked on in Algeria, where a portion"], [299, "293 VERONIA. of his military Hfe had been spent ; and with these memories came back upon his heart some of the softer feeHngs of his youth. \" I, too, might have been happy, as my comrades of that time are still,\" thought he, \" and now, what is my life like, but an unconnected, weary, troubled dream ?\" He had reached the summit of a sand hill, one of the range which formed a back ground to the De Mehuls' dwelling, and he could see below a light emerging thence ; hastening forward, he was in a few moments beside it. \"Who is there?\" asked the voice of Veronia, in answer to his knock, and on receiving his reply, the door was unhesitat ingly opened, and she stood wonderingly before him. \" I humbly ask your pardon, mademoi selle,\" said the intruder, as he put Van Helder's letter into her hand ; \" but, not withstanding the lateness of the hour, I have ventured to bring you this, as I know the writer must have wished you to receive it before the day was over \u2014 this I trust wiU"], [300, "294 VERONIA. excuse me in your eyes. To-morrow early, I shall have the honour of waiting upon you for any commands you may have to give, or any service you may require ;\" and with a profound and silent salutation, he was gone. Veronia looked after him for a moment or two into the darkness \u2014 haU puzzled, half frightened, at what his unexpected apparition might portend, until, recollecting the paper which he had presented to her, she hastened \u2014 having once more secured their dwelling for the night \u2014 to seek there in for some solution of the mysterj^.

The uncompromising nature of the"], [310, "304 VERONIA. sentiment she had expressed, its breadth and grandeur, struck his lively fancy, and made him realize more fully than he had ever done before the full splendour of the conservative principle which it exemplified. \"The majority are against you, I fear, my dear friend,\" said the old Duke, turning smilingly towards the defender of the occult sciences; \"and for myself, what can I say to soften the fact of being of their number?

How can you pray \u2014 you who have learnt only error from your birth ?\" \" It may be,\" replied the now bewildered girl. \" It is true, mother, that we have never sought the truths of religion as we perhaps might have done; but God is good ; they say He loves to pardon ; turn to Him trustfully ; ask Him for forgiveness, and He will surely hear you.\" \" You know not what you say, Veronia. I dare not pray, for I have renounced the faith, trampled upon the cross, and denied the Saviour, even as Judas !\" These words seemed to scorch the wretched speaker as she uttered them, for her features became distorted, and she seU"], [334, "328 VERONIA. back writhing as if in torment. Then sud denly starting up again, and stretching forth her arms distractedly, she resumed with rapid and still more vehement utterance \u2014 \" But there is time, time yet, if you will fly, Veronia, and fetch a priest. Tell him I am dying, and bid him, in the name of God, hasten to bring the Sacraments, for \u2014 I am a Catholic !\" Shocked and terrified, Veronia stood rooted to the spot. The revelation had been so sudden and unlooked-for, that she could scarcely have beHeved it even now, had not the sick woman's looks of anguish left no room for doubt. Drops of agony stood upon her brow ; its veins were black and throb bing ; the colour on her hollow cheek had deepened to a lurid glow that seemed to have been kindled by some fierce, quenchless fire within, and the great, the awful presence of death had cast its coming shadow on her face. As her daughter stood, confused and wavering, before her, she rose once more, ex tended her thin hands, and Veronia thrilled with horror as the accents of a parent's threatened malediction fell upon her ear."], [335, "329 VERONIA, She would have stayed the frightful menace by an imploring gesture or embrace, but such a glance \u2014 so filled with the despair of a lost soul \u2014 met her own, that, appalled and shuddering, she sprang forth into the chill evening, and sped away desperately upon her ghostly errand. Night was closing in. The low querulous breeze that had been abroad aU day, lay hushed and silent. All was still, dark, and solemn over the deserted Dunes, for the moon had not yet risen, and the stars looked out but fitfully, veiled, as they were, by drifts of fleeting clouds. Oh ! that stillness of outward things, when the heart is convulsed by sorrow, how does it, by contrast, intensify the storm that is making all so desolate within ! How, from the beautiful face of Nature seems to rise up a mocking voice, suggesting that the wretchedness of man is uncared for, un pitied, and unknown ! Thoughts such as these awoke in the breast of Veronia as she hurried onwards, fear struggling in her mind with grief; for the dear mother, whom she had so fondly loved and tended, seemed"], [336, "330 VERONIA. transformed into a tortured spirit, around whom hung an atmosphere of horror and dismay. Ever before her, in the darkness, gleamed those burning eyes ; ever rose up, livid and spectral, that convulsed face, on which rested the reflection of a coming ghastly eternity ; ever rang in her ears those last words, pregnant of a curse ! Away, over the damp moors, past the decaying churchyard, across the rugged piece of ground that lay between it and the Curb's garden, Veronia hurried still desperately as one who speeds for life \u2014 madly as one the voice of whose reason is dumb. Folly, idolatry, superstition in its worst form \u2014 did she not know it? \u2014 lay before her ; but the horrible image of reprobation was behind. Why balance, then, betwixt a choice of evils when all seemed desperate ; when all, perhaps, was lost ? Suddenly, through the darkness, flashed the red gleam of the Presbytery fire : the stove \u2014 fora moment, probably, uncovered \u2014 had thrown out the lurid crimson of its furnace, which almost instantly faded again ; but that moment had sufficed to guide"], [337, "331 VERONIA. Veronia, and she pressed rapidly on towards it. There is in every man's Hfe some hour in the twenty-four to which he looks as compensation for the rest \u2014 and we say com pensation advisedly, for to those who have passed the sweet spring-time of illusions, and to whom life is not an actual sorrow, it is, at least, a prosaic penance enough ! This hour of compensation in the Cure's existence was the present one, when secure from interruptions \u2014 for, since his infirmity, all duty after nightfall devolved upon his vicar \u2014 he could taste in peace the scanty home enjoyments of the priest. The frugal meal, the quiet meditation, and the invariable nap with which it closed, these, when Van Helder, or some other friend, were not present, were his only plea sures, and if nature had instilled into him some qualities that seemed incompatible with such a destiny, yet the effects of long habit, profound piety, and the sharp influ ence of ecclesiastical harness, had so well schooled them, that the balance had long been counterpoised, and all was now har-"], [338, "332 VERONIA. mony within his breast, so that it would have, perhaps, been difficult to find within the diocese a more contented spirit. On a low chair, within an angle of that apartment wnich, on ordinary occasions, served the common purposes alike of par lour and kitchen, with folded hands, and head slightly inclined, the pastor was now seated, wrapped, to all appearance, in the continuation of that soothing dream, the thread of which he had resumed at about the same hour for some five-and-twenty years gone past. From the downcast, placid eyelid to the grave folds of his priestly drapery, all was calm, motionless, and hushed around him, save that, as if in mockery of this repose, a red reflection from the stove sprang out at intervals, to dance and flicker with gleeful mischief on the surface of the large sUver buckles of his shoes. An immense caldron, seething near him, was mingling its music with the continu ous roaring of the stove, beside which stood Godensca, bending intently over the bar barian mess of thickened butter-milk then"], [339, "VERONIA. 333 preparing for her master's supper; and above all these sounds was heard that of the ladle making its solemn round athwart the heaving mass, as she kept slowly stirring it with all the profound abstraction from all other interests, of some sibyl, engaged in mystic rites. Reflected thus upon the wall by the uncertain fire-light, her gaunt figure might weU have simulated such ; but a glance at herself would, alas ! have dispelled the illusion, for her tight boddice, scanty striped petticoat, broad quilled cap, and wooden shoes rudely clashed with any clas sical associations, though we are, perchance, unjustified in saying so, inasmuch as there could not be two opinions as to her possess ing the head of a Gorgon, and arms worthy of Vulcan ; the imposing effect this harmonious combination might have other wise produced, being, however, utterly marred by her possessing, also, the un doubted figure of a wasp, and feet \u2014 oh ! clement reader ! Godensca's feet were really so unlike anything that have ever before appeared in nature, or been represented in art under the category feet, as totally to"], [340, "334 VERONIA. baffle our best powers of description. We will, therefore, speak only of her shoes, which were in shape very much like a pair of Ve netian gondolas, and being, as we have be fore said, wooden, went clatter, clatter, over the stone floor at every step she took. Around her, in a semicircle, sat the three not least important members of the pastor's household ; they to whom Goden sca's virgin heart, perhaps exclusively, be longed, and bestowed, too, with something of the same decision with which it was with held from another member \u2014 no less a per sonage, indeed, than the green parrot before alluded to, inhabiting for some years past a cage placed near her master's chair, and between whom and the handmaiden there had ever existed a deep and unconquerable antipathy, awakened, on her part, it is but just to say, by a legitimate disgust at the more than occasional levity of his language, besides his irreverent habit of quoting and applying Holy Scripture on all available occasions \u2014 a habit not confined alone to Jacco, although Godensca, having never Uved with any other than Catholic Chris-"], [341, "335 VERONIA. tians, could not be expected to be aware of this, or consequently to excuse him. There was yet another individual present, of rough exterior, but genteel manners. He had a sharply pointed muzzle, and erect ears, a tail to match, the liveliest pair of gleaming eyes one would be likely to meet with in the course of a summer's day, and, to be brief, he was a scion of the terrier breed. He has aHeady had the honour of introduction to the reader by the name of ' Cauvin.' It is, doubtless, superfluous to mention here, that the real name of John Calvin, the reformer, was ' Cauvin ' \u2014 from him then did this ' Cauvin ' take his name. Prompted by the same ceaseless love of mischief that had induced him to corrupt the language of poor Jacco, Van Helder, on presenting the Cure with this terrier, had stipulated that ' Cauvin ' should be his name, foreseeing all the amusement to be derived from the allusions to which the associations connected with that cognomen would give rise; and the priest, unsuspicious of his motive, had yielded good-naturedly, as he generaUy did,"], [342, "336 VERONIA. to his friend's wishes. Of this dark plot, poor Cauvin was the victim ! The dreadful heresies from Van Helder's mocking Hps, which the mere enunciation of his name produced, had closed Godensca's heart entirely against him. She considered him in a manner dedicated like Jacco to the powers of ill, and lost no opportunity of endeavouring to instil a similar conviction into the pastor's mind ; but we need hardly say without much appearance of success. Such being the state of things, the dog most often sought shelter by his master's side, in the absence of Van Helder, turning his bright eyes from time to time towards the priest, as if to say that to him alone he looked for any kindness. Lolotte, Blomen, and Skirl, so were the trio named whom we have already designated as the especial objects of the handmaiden's affec tions, formed at this moment as we have said, a semicircle round the stove, its simmering caldron, and their patroness ; and we prefer to state it thus, as, the secret of hearts being hidden from us, we know not in fact to which their homage was more particularly"], [343, "VERONIA. 337 addressed, and would not intentionally do them an injustice. It was evident, how ever, that they wished to express feelings in harmony with the scene, for each head drooped meditatively, probably in respect to the grave abstraction reflected in the pastor's attitude, while an attentive and continuous ' purr,' seemed intended as a sympathetic accompaniment to the roaring of the stove, and the pleasing music of the ladle's circuitous vigil. \" Hurrah ! Skirl ; why don't you curl your tail tidily like Blomen, then, if it is not to be trodden on?\" cried the sibyl, energeticaUy, as Skirl gave forth a cry worthy of his name on feeHng one of the gondolas suddenly descend upon him. \" Stand away with you, sir, disturbing the pastor at his thoughts, that way \u2014 how dare you ?\" and the abashed Skirl retired a few steps before sitting down to envelope him self in his tail, as recommended. \" Hark !\" exclaimed the priest, suddenly, as Cauvin, roused by a sound at the outer door, bounded towards it with the sharp ringing bark of his species, expressive of VOL. I. z"], [344, "338 VERONIA. anger and excitement. \" Do you hear, Godensca, there is some one knocking at the front of the house \u2014 see who it is, pray. The vicar has aU the keys of the sacristy \u2014 I never keep them now until this hour.\" \" A moment, Meinheer ; I must first lift off the caldron, or the soup will turn to lumps,\" answered she, joining the action to the word, while the Cure, having now opened the kitchen door, the sound of loud, reiterated knocks came plainly from the outer one, thereby raising Cauvin's indignant remonstrance to a pitch of fury. \" Hold your noise do, you bad dog,\" cried Godensca, angrily ; \" is that the way to go on in a Christian house, as if we had no more ears than pagan idols ! Just like you, and your good-for-nothing, unbeliev ing name !\" and applying a pretty sharp kick upon his ribs, which sent poor Cauvin howHng to his master, she puUed open the door irately, over the threshold of which at the same instant a wan, dishevelled, panting figure bounded. \" For the love of God, a priest \u2014 quickly, a priest,\" cried Veronia, for it was she, as the"], [345, "339 VERONIA. startled Cure stood looking wonderingly at her, lamp in hand. \" Come instantly, monsieur, I beseech you \u2014 death is there \u2014 we have no time to lose \u2014 come quickly I say,\" and she clutched the pastor's garment distractedly, as if to drag him with her as she spoke. \" She is mad, Meinheer, she must be, to be out at this hour with a bare head, that way ; and just see how wild she looks. St. Benoit be with us \u2014 what shall we do with her?\" \" Do you hear ?\" resumed Veronia, not understanding the Walloon dialect in which this speech had been uttered; and then, ere the bewildered Cure could sufficiently col lect his faculties to answer her, conceiving that her language might be equally incom prehensible to him, she gave way, for a moment, to despair. \" Oh, Van Helder,\" cried she, in a tone of anguish, \" why did you abandon us? My poor, poor mother! whither can I turn for help ?\" \" You are, then, Mademoiselle de Melml, my child,\" said the Cure, whom this mention of the Doctor had suddenly enlightened, and"], [346, "340 VERONIA addressing her in French (in which language she had spoken, and which, like the upper classes of her countrywomen, she used habitually to the exclusion of her mother tongue). \"I see it all; fly instantly, Godensca, and tell the vicar to bring the holy oils without delay; I will keep the young lady here until he comes.\" \" God be thanked,\" exclaimed Veronia, as Godensca, whose pious zeal was never at fault, hurried off without a word on seeing that the case was urgent ; and, as she spoke, the now exhausted girl reeled back, and would have fallen, but for the good priest's supporting aid. He led her gently to his own seat beside the fire, either ignorant or forgetful of the fact that, to a fainting person, air, and not warmth, is the chief re quisite, and scarcely was she seated than she sank into a partial swoon. It now fortunately occurred to the Cure that, on similar emergencies, water was commonly applied, and having fetched some, and dashed a good portion of it in her face, he had, in a few moments, the relief of see ing her revive \u2014 almost at the same instant,"], [347, "341 VERONIA. reappeared Godensca, accompanied by Karel Vanneker, with an attendant acolyte, and following on their steps was little Beth, panting, breathless, and overflowing with sympathy, which, however, as usual, was silently expressed. Faint and trembling as she was, Veronia rose instantly, and her friend did not attempt to combat her evi dent intention of proceeding with the priest immediately, for she felt by sympathy how terrible must be to the daughter the anxiety of each moment's absence from her mother's side. It had been dark, as we have said, when Veronia quitted her dwelling ; but now the moon was rising, and, save when some pass ing cloud obscured her face, began as they proceeded to cast a partial light over the road they had to traverse. The lamp car ried by the acolyte aided them also in avoiding the earth holes and rough places, in struggling over which Veronia had been much delayed in coming.

Beth guessed the agony that kept her silent, and although astonished at the circumstance of one so lately an alien from the Church, now calling for its aid, forbore, at such a moment, to press inquiries. The vicar discreetly imi tated her example, and not a word passed between them. Suddenly, borne upon the air, came the far-off sound of the village clock striking the hour. Two had elapsed since Veronia had left her dying mother's side ; how had they sped with her ? \u2014 The thought was fraught with terror. It quickened with a feverish throb her fainting pulse ; but, silently as before, she hurried on. By this time the orb of night had fully risen, and the long ridge of sand-hills which rose before them, looked white and spectral beneath her glassy beams. A few more steps, and the ocean lay calmly glittering to their view ; not a ripple stirred its surface, scarce"], [349, "343 VERONIA. a murmur died along its shore. The priest, Beth, even the objects of her mission, were forgotten by the daughter as she came within sight of the roof beneath which her mother's soul was passing to eternity.
