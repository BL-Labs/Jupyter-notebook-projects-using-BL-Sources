' ~T F ever there was an unlucky beggar, I am I one!' The speaker of these doleful words was young Viscount Tempeston, aged fifteen, just then reclining at full length on the sofa in his sisters' schoolroom. He was a slight, graceful boy, with curly brown hair, deep blue eyes, long dark lashes, remarkably straight features, and a pair of very thin lips, the upper one of which curled slightly. It was these last which told of the lad's worst failing, \u2014 a violent temper and a somewhat proud disposition. There were two other occupants of the room, \u2014 the Ladies Helen and Lina Thorpe, daughters of the Earl"], [14, "Olga. 10 of GrantoAvn and sisters of Tempeston's. The eldest, a pretty, dark girl, Avas just seventeen, while the other, aged twelve, bore a strong family likeness to her brother. Five years before the date of my story, the children had had the great misfortune to lose their mother. Lord Grantown, though he had loved his wife dearly, was not a man to Avear his heart on his sleeve ; and she, poor lady, mistaking his somewhat stern manner for indifference, had expended the wealth of her affections on her children. To all of them her death was a bitter bloAV. Helen had been of an age to feel it acutely, added to which, she had been her mother's constant companion ; while Lina, as the youngest, had of course been the spoilt pet of the mistress of the house. As for Lord Grantown, he Avas a man not altogether undeserving of notice. HeAvas tall and thin, Avith iron grey hair, dark, piercing eyes, and a slight stoop. Though he was a man greatly given to speaking, and Avith much of the orator about him, he had taken no part in political life. He was never absent from his"], [15, "Home Life. 1 1 place in the Upper House, but he never opened his lips when there, unless an ecclesiastical question was being discussed. Then, though he spoke eloquently, \u2014 so eloquently that he was never at a loss for a word, \u2014 he yet influenced no one. His quarrel Avas not with this or that party, but rather with the whole bench of bishops. He Avas for ever prophesying the instant destruction of the Church of England before the great wave of infidelity, unless some pet plan of his own was at once adopted. It was useless to point out that in the past such theory had been acted upon and failed. What matter though 'they had toiled all the night, taking nothing ; ' the burden of his cry was, ' Let down the net once again.' This, however, must be done according to his express directions. Poor Lord GrantoAvn ! it was not all his own fault. His mother had been a Scotchwoman, and a member of a sect but little knoAvn in these days, and from his earliest years he had been instilled in her somewhat gloomy doctrines until he had grown up and adopted them as his OAvn. He never laughed, because he was ever thinking of serious things, and laughter to him"], [16, "Olga. 1 2 was frivolous. He never shot or hunted like other men, or followed their pursuits. To him God and the things of God were all in all. So, though many thought him harsh and cold, yet on the whole he was a good man, and ever strove to act up to his principles. His wife's death made but little outward change in him, since he believed that the exhibition of sorrow was not permitted to the man who strove to folloAV the divine will ; so, even while his heart Avas Avrung, none guessed it. Such was the master of the castle at the date of my story. But, of all the household, none had felt Lady Gran town's death like her son Tempeston. The day before her decease, having given birth to a boy who survived but a feAV hours, she was taken alarmingly ill. Towards nightfall, the ordinary medical man, Dr. Tufnell, had requested that Sir William M'Bean might be sent for from London, and Lord Grantown, a man much averse to alarm and excitement under any circumstances, had striven to oppose his wish. He said he was quite satisfied that Dr. Tufnell would do all that was necessary, and that he had every confidence in him."], [17, "Home Life. 1 3 Then it became necessary to break to the husband the country practitioner's fears, and the former, seeing how serious matters were, gave way. Coming in, full of joyous carelessness, Tempeston had met the servant bearing the telegraphic despatch to the station, and in a moment seemed to realize the calamity with which he was threatened. Panting for breath, in his thick, muddy boots, in tAvo minutes he Avas outside his mother's door. There he Avas stopped \u2014 he could not go in. He would \u2014 he must ; no one should prevent him. His old nurse had her arms round him, and Avas seeking to drag him away, Avhen Lord GrantoAvn came out to see Avhat the disturbance was about. He Avas ashamed of such violence at such a time, he said, and ordered his son sternly from his presence. Then Avith flashing eyes the boy refused. ' Let me pass ! ' he cried ; ' I will go in. She will see me ; I will make her better.' ' Your mother is unconscious,' Lord GrantoAvn retorted. ' I order you to be quiet. Go to your room and remain there without your tea as a punishment for not obeying me at once.'"], [18, "Olga 1 4 The warm, passionate heart, bursting with terror at the idea of his mother's danger, could ill stand rebuke at such a moment. He flung himself from his old nurse, and strove to Avrestle his Avay past his father. Lord GrantoAvn caught him by the collar and half dragged, half carried the lad to the latter's OAvn room. ' You will remain here till to-morrow morning,' he said, preparing to quit the apartment. Half mad, the boy struck out at the speaker, receiving in return a ringing box on the ear. Then followed a terrible scene ; Tempeston fought with all his might, not heeding the blows showered on him, while Lord Grantown, though a strong man, had to do his best against his son. At length the elder prevailed, and flung the boy from him, bruised, to the floor. ' Lie there,' he said, ' you bad, wicked child ! Is it at such an hour as this you would shoAV your violence, when your mother may be dying ? ' ' Curse you ! ' Tempeston hissed through his clenched teeth ; ' I wish that you Avere dying. I hate you ! ' Through the night that followed, the lad remained locked into the room without food or comfort. He"], [19, "15 IN AN INSTANT TEMPESTON WAS IN HER ARMS."], [20, ""], [21, "Home Life. 17 ne er slept. Now pacing the apartment from end to ena, now flinging himself weeping on his bed, he waited for the arrival of the doctor who should bring help. At length, towards morning, he heard the sound ' vheels, and, looking out, beheld the carriage driving to the door. Sir William M'Bean had come by special train, but he had come too late. It was close .->\u00bb_ five o'clock Avhen the sound of the key turning .j'lsed the lad from a half doze. He opened his eyes to see his old nurse. In an instant Tempeston was in her arms. ' How was mammy ? What did the doctors say ? When would she be better ? ' The woman held him in her arms. The house was still and quiet. There was no reply \u2014 yet her silence gave him ansAver, and with a cry the lad fell senseless at her feet. The doctor came, and lingered round his bed, but it was some days before the boy recovered consciousness. In after life Tempeston never forgot the day and hour when his senses returned. For a time he had a difficulty in recalling events. There Avas a stir and bustle within the house just then, and he could hear 2"], [22, "Olga 1 8 the sound of hoofs and wheels beloAv his window. He listed himself from his pilloAv Avith a moan, as the knowledge of the past came back to him, Avhen sud denly the tread of many feet outside his door startled him. Who were they ? Hoav slowly they came ! Every noAv and then they paused, as though they bore some heavy Aveight ! He rose, staggered to the window, and, peeping out, beheld, waiting at the steps, a carriage Avith feathers on the top which nodded in the wintry Avind. And so seeing, the boy kneAv Avhat it Avas that had been borne past his bedroom door. It Avas five years since then, but, even at the date of the opening of my story, Tempeston had never learned to speak of his mother. The girls liked to talk with old nurse about 'her dear mistress,' but if the young heir's step was heard approaching, a sudden hush fell on them all lest he should hear. ' If ever there Avas an unlucky beggar, I am one ! ' ' What's the matter, Tempest ? ' asked Lina, looking up from the table where she was copying a French exercise."], [23, "Home Life. 19 'Why, papa says I'm not to go back to Eton next half; not to go back at all.' ' Goodness me ! why not ? ' He says he's had a correspondence with Mr. Beatson, who, it seems, must needs go writing to him that I was idle, or something of that sort, \u2014 as if a fellow could be always sapping, \u2014 so I'm to stop at home and have a tutor.' ' A tutor ! ' echoed both the girls in amazement. 'Yes. He says that he's going to superintend the lessons himself, and see that I work.' ' Good heavens ! ' exclaimed Helen ; ' what dreadful scrapes you will get into, Tempest ! I knoAv Avhat it will be, \u2014 simply endless rowing from morning till night betAveen you both.' ' It won't be my fault if there's not, I can tell you. I'll lead him such a life that he'll rue the day he took me away from Eton. Here am I to go to London with you in May, stop there all the season, and have no cricket or anything ! I hate him. I always did and shall ; but noAv I hate him more than ever !

'Oh, it's not that I mind. I shan't trouble very much about lessons. If I don't know them, Avhat can he do ? He dare not strike me now. The last time he tried that game was tAvo years ago, and if he thinks at my age ' \u2014 speaking very loftily \u2014 ' that I shall con sent to have my ears boxed by him, why, then, he's very much mistaken, that's all.' Helen could not help smiling at the speaker's ' my age.' ' I don't see AA-hy you should grin,' retorted her brother, settling himself more comfortably on the sofa ; ' you are only two years older than I am, and yet you are going to be presented next month, and call yourself groAvn up ! ' Long experience had taught the schoolroom party that it Avas best not to contradict Tempeston. Yet, with all his faults of temper and boyish conceit, the lad was a prime favourite, not only with his sisters, but Avith Miss Emmett, the governess, and all the estab lishment."], [25, "Home Life. 21 ' Does papa know of a tutor ? ' asked Helen, changing the subject. ' No ; he's going to look out for one after we go to London on the first of May. All that I know at present is that he is to be a man of papa's views.' ' Good heavens ! no ! ' exclaimed the elder girl. 'A fact.' 'And do you mean he'll live in the house, and be at luncheon, and everything, just like Miss Emmett ? ' ' I suppose so.' ' Good-bye, then, to any fun up here at tea-time,' said Lina. ' Oh, I don't think he'll come to that. He will have dinner with papa, I suppose, or else alone.' ' Well, it's been dull enough this afternoon till now, but I must say, Tempest, you have brought us some news,' said Helen. ' Wait a minute, old girl,' was the reply, ' and I'll tell you some more. Lina, just put that cushion over there under my head ; it's too low \u2014 thanks. Well, Helen, until he finds the man, very likely he's ' \u2014 speaking in a"], [26, "Olga. 22 tone partly filled with awe and partly with hardly suppressed fun \u2014 ' he's going to teach me himself.'

And listen : I'm to sit Avith him in the library every day from ten till one, and two till four, Avorking all the time.' ' Poor boy ! ' exclaimed both the girls, in a tone of the deepest commiseration. At this moment the door opened, and Miss Emmett, the governess, entered the room. She Avas a lady in appearance as well as by birth. Her father had been a fox-hunting parson, and her mother the daughter of a post-captain in the navy. Well read, anxious to educate her pupils to the best of her ability, and of a kindly nature, she Avas a prime favourite, not only Avith her motherless charges, but also Avith all the servants of the establishment. The girls Avere allowed six Aveeks' holiday in the autumn, and a month at Christmas, and in old times Miss Emmett had delighted to spend"], [27, "Home Life. 23 those brief seasons of rest either with friends or touring on the Continent. Since, however, the September pre vious to Lady GrantoAvn's death she had never been absent from her pupils for a single night. They had their usual vacations and the governess put away the lesson-books, and turned into a holiday-maker herself, but still she remained at their side. She was never in the Avay on these occasions, but spent herself in making the time of rest happy. ' I declare,' she began, as soon as she caught sight of the boy's figure on the sofa, ' young people know how to make themselves comfortable nowadays ; don't they, Helen?' ' He's spent the last twenty minutes of our prepara tion time there; and, Miss Emmett, make him tell you what he has told us.' ' What is it, Tempest ?

Lying luxuriously at full length and looking up at Miss Emmett with an expression half regretful at having to leave Eton, and half mirthful at the idea of"], [28, "Olga. 24 being partly educated by his father, the lad related his story. ' Help to teach you himself!' repeated the governess. ' Yes.' 'My dear boy, you'll get into serious trouble I'm afraid.' ' Can't help it,' retorted Tempeston. ' I didn't propose or want it. I suppose he begins to find he cannot live Avithout me.' Every one laughed, including Miss Emmett. ' But it seems such a pity he should leave Eton,' said the last-named lady, speaking in rather a Ioav tone to the eldest girl. ' Your father does do such sudden things. I wish he had consulted me. I never even kne.v Mr. Beatson had written about Tempest.' ' Nor any one else until this afternoon. He met Tempest in the hall and told him, a propos of nothing.' ' Really ! ' ' Yes,' said the boy. ' I had just dashed doAvn the grand stairs, \u2014 fancy, if he had seen me ! \u2014 and as I was walking across the hall he came out of the library and"], [29, "Lfome Life. 25 said, \" Tempest, you will not return to Eton again.\" You might have knocked me down Avith a feather, \u2014 I was so taken aback, partly at that and partly at being so nearly caught on the stairs.' ' I hope you will try and please him more when you Avork with him, Tempest,' said Miss Emmett. ' But now, my dear, you must be off,' she added, as the young viscount tried to prevent a cushion falling from under his head without fatiguing himself by lifting his hands. ' Oh, why ? I'm so comfortable.' ' Lina will never finish her lessons by tea-time if you stay here talking.' 'All right! only do let's have it punctually. I'm so awfully thirsty ! ' ' Very well ; run along noAv,' was the reply. Tempeston struggled up from among the cushions and quitted the room Avith a rather thoughtful air. He was wondering what on earth he should do with himself for the next quarter of an hour. Down the corridor he went, until he came to the head of the grand stairs. The schoolroom party Avere not sup posed to make use of these, but, instead, were under"], [30, "26 Olga. orders always to go doAvn the back Avay. Now this back way Avas much frequented by housemaids carrying brooms, Avhich articles they from time to time left lying about \u2014 thereby furnishing useful weapons for Tempeston to pursue and torment his sisters Avith. The boy Avas apt to boast that he could get almost anything he Avanted out of Helen by the mere threat of brushing her hair Avith one of the aforesaid mops. The shrieks Avhich echoed through the house on these occasions had once or twice been heard by Lord Grantown, and had brought that gentleman to the spot, greatly to the discomfort of the principal parties engaged. Tempeston stood leaning over the rails at the head of the grand stairs, listening to the tick-tick, tick-tick of the clock, and wishing for Helen, that he might make her Avalk down the forbidden Avay, when his eye suddenly fell on a large india-rubber ball Avhich he had mislaid, and now found lying on a table beside him. He seized the lost toy and began throAving it up into the air and catching it. This amusement occupied a feAV minutes, and then"], [31, "Home Life. 27 began to pall. It Avas not sufficiently exciting. To thoroughly enjoy a thing, Tempeston required that there should be a certain amount of risk about it. Suddenly the idea struck him of pitching the ball against the opposite wall Avith sufficient force to make it rebound back to the landing-place ; if it failed to do so, it Avould go down the Avell of the staircase, which Avould necessitate his going after it. The fear of its doing so, and of his father catching him as he crept down, lent the required flavour to the new pastime. One, two, three, four, backwards and forwards went the ball, and each time Tempeston caught it easily ; but the fifth time, either from carelessness, or the sudden sound of the tea-bell ringing distracting his attention, he did not send it hard enough. The ball struck the Avail lightly and then disappeared down the well of the stairs, followed by a sound of broken glass. 'Death and destruction! what's gone now?' exclaimed the boy, peering over the rails, when the sound of a footstep in the hall made him start. He kneAv Avhose it was. ' Good gracious ! he's come in from his Avalk and is"], [32, "28 Olga going to the library ! ' thought the lad. ' I must Avait till after tea before I dare go down and see what it is. He'll be up-stairs perhaps by then.' Tempeston dashed away to the schoolroom, where he found the party gathered round the board, on which was spread cold beef, tea, toast, jam, bread, and eggs. Tempeston was soon hard at work. Indeed, they all did full justice to the good things, while laughter and fun were the order of the day. The boy, having related the accident with the india rubber ball amidst general exclamations of horror and dread, was just engaged in a friendly argument Avith Lina as to whether she had or had not taken two helps of straAvberry jam to his one, when a knock came to the door. No one heard it. ' You did. I saw you take it. I remember noticing how you stuck the spoon Avell in, so as to get double.' ' Oh, Tempest ' (getting very red), ' what a story ! ' ' It's not a story. I never have anything to eat up here unless you are late, and I happen to get a start' Again the knock. This time Miss Emmett heard it."], [33, "Home Life. 29 ' Come in ! ' The door opened, and there appeared 'his lordship's man,' Dutton, who had never in his life before had occasion to visit the schoolroom party. Every one stared, Avhile Tempeston sat with the jam-spoon in his hand, gazing wildly at the new arrival. He thought it was a summons for him. ' His lordship's compliments, and Lady Helen was to dine with him at eight o'clock.' ' Good gracious ! ' from the last-named individual. ' Dear me ! ' from Miss Emmett. ' Oh, Helen ! ' from Lina. ' My stars, what swells we are ! ' from the holder of the jam-spoon, thinking that the above Avas the Avhole of the message, when his hopes were rudely broken by Dutton turning toAvards him, saying, \u2014 ' Will you please step down, my lord, to the library, and see his lordship at once ?

' He said at once, my lord,' urged the kindly valet ' It's all UP!' exclaimed Tempeston, laughing in"], [34, "Olga. 30 spite of his fright, as they rose from the table, and he AvithdreAv toAvards the door. ' Hoav did he look, Dutton ? ' he asked ; ' nice ? ' ' N \u2014 not very, my lord,' Avas the reply. Miss Emmett, who heard it, said grace with difficulty."], [35, "CHAPTER II. HELEN'S FIRST DINNER.

He pushed open the swing door and entered the hail, but the great place Avas deserted ; and, after pausing for a moment, pursued his way to the library, and, opening the door, Avent in. Before the fire stood the master of the house, Avhom I have already described to my readers. He did not move when his son entered, but, fixing his piercing gaze upon him, silently regarded him.

I thought I had smashed something worth fifty pounds, at least' ' Do you suppose I am going to put up Avith having every lamp glass smashed in the house?

I only require a guinea. You can keep the other four shillings.' ' I don't Avant the beastly things,' retorted the boy. ' What's the use of four shillings ?

He allowed the matter to drop. ' Oh, Helen !

' Never mind, Tempest,' she said, kissing him. ' You shall give it me some other day, when you are rich.' ' Oh, I will, Helen.

' He told you, perhaps, to him ? ' that I had been speaking ' Yes, papa.' ' I have reflected over siderable correspondence the matter, and had con- Avith his tutor and form- master. I regret now I sent him to Eton ; he would have done better at home.' ' But, papa, there Avould have been no one here who"], [45, "Helen s First Dinner. 41 could have played cricket, or fives, or any of the games he likes.' 'There are things of greater importance than mere sports. He must learn these things. He has been idle, grossly idle ; and I can see, too, that he has no sense of religion ; even this very morning he Avas smiling when I was reading to you all of the children mocking the bald-headed prophet' ' But, papa, he is only a boy.'

' He Avas greatly disappointed, poor boy, because the punishment prevented his giving me a birthday present. Papa, I think he is the most generous boy I ever heard of. He always spends nearly the Avhole of his pocket-money on every one but himself. He is sorry not to go back to Eton, too ; perhaps that Avas Avhat made him seem a little sulky.

He is fond of horses.' ' A dangerous taste for a young fellow of his stamp. I must put a stop to that ! ' ' Good gracious ! what have I done ? ' thought the unhappy Helen. ' I do not think it does him any harm,' she ventured to suggest. ' /am the best judge of that,' Lord GrantoAvn returned. There was a silence for a while, as the servants cleared away and placed the dessert on the table, while the girl wondered how long she ought to sit, and whether her companion would tell her when to go. 'You do not eat much dinner,' Lord Grantown remarked, as Helen refused fruit and biscuits. ' Papa, I had tea at half-past five.'"], [48, "Olga, 44 ' What ! schoolroom tea ? ' Yes. I did not know I was to dine with you, till just as Ave were finishing' 'I forgot to send earlier. For the future, Helen, you will, of course, both here and in London dine Avith me.' The girl with difficulty repressed a groan. Farewell tea, toast, and jam ! Farewell to the merry schoolroom fun ! Oh, Avhat good times they had had up there ! What absurd scenes, when Tempest had set them playing ' hunt the slipper,' \u2014 the Avhole party only consisting of herself, Lina, Miss Emmett, and old nurse. Lord Grantown sipped his claret in silence for a little while ; but at length he said, ' I have arranged that your Aunt Harriet shall present you on the fifth.' ' Yes, papa. I heard from her this morning ; she says she has not been to court for fifteen years.' ' Well, it is but a piece of Avorldly vanity and I regret you should have to undertake it.

There is no worldly amusement you will not find patronized by some one of them, on the score of prudence and concession.' ' Good gracious ! I have done it now ! ' thought Helen. I must start something else quickly.' ' Papa, who will Tempest have to play with him Avhen we come back from London ? It has always been that in his autumn holidays he is rather tired of cricket, after the long summer term, but now it will be different' ' He has chosen to be idle, and must abide the consequence.'

' I can't help it ; I shall laugh Avhenever I think of it. When you got into the dining-room I lay down there on the rug and thought I should have died.' 'It was very naughty.

' That's quite true,' Tempeston ansAvered ; ' and now tell me, what did you talk about all dinner ? ' ' I have a good mind not to say. It's more than you deserve. We talked of you and you only.

The boy glanced mischievously up at his sister, but she wisely forbore looking at him. ' Do you not like either ? ' asked the master of the house kindly, as his son refused both tea and coffee. ' Papa, yes. I like coffee for breakfast, but I don't want any now.' ' I thought boys could eat and drink whenever they got a chance,' was the reply, given with what was intended for a smile. ' Well, I can't; retorted Tempeston, rather rudely. Helen glanced nervously at her father, but he only seated himself with a sigh. The brother and sister soon AvithdreAV to a distant sofa, and a laughing whis pered conference began. ' He's going to sleep,' said the boy, glancing at his father, who lay with closed eyes. ' I wish he would.' ' How long noAv before prayers ? ' ' Only a quarter of an hour. Oh, I'm so tired with"], [55, "Helens First Dinner. 51 making conversation at dinner !

' He can't hear, even if he is awake.' And he was awake, and, through his almost closed eyes, watching his children, wondering at the change which had come over them in the last few minutes. During the afternoon of that day he had spent twenty minutes with his son, and the whole of that time the lad had never once looked up at him in the manner he was now doing at his sister. Why was he sullen when spoken to for his good ? He had seen other men with their heirs, and things with them had been altogether different. He told himself that such difference arose through his determination not to permit that familiarity between parent and child which characterizes the present day, and which he believed tended to prevent the respect due from the one to the other. Had he been careless as to duty, then that easy intercourse would probably have existed between himself and his"], [56, "Olga. 52 children. As he sat in his chair, watching the pair on the sofa, particularly the boy, he told himself that it was his duty to maintain that reserve which he had hitherto done. He Avould like to have drawn the lad to him as he had seen other fathers do Avith their sons, speaking to him of those frivolous amusements which, alas ! interested the boy. Hoav handsome and comely he was, with his wavy hair and slight, aristocratic figure, lounging beside his sister ! But if such Aveakness was complied with, where would be that Avholesome fear which it was so necessary his son should feel for him ? His position, he thought, as a Christian parent, precluded him from that joyous intercourse Avhich other parents indulged in Avith their children. And it was doubly necessary, he considered, that Tempeston should have this fear of him, because the boy was wild and passionate, and he believed fear alone could restrain him. His daughter, too, was an altogether different being, as she sat whispering and laughing Avith her brother, from Avhat she had been at the head of his dinner table. As he sat in his chair, he hated to think that his presence awed her ;"], [57, "Helen s First Dinner. 53 yet he believed it was right that it should do so. He would strive to perpetuate it, too, though his weak heart craved for joyous and familiar inter course. Then the prayer-bell clanged forth, and Lord Gran town's meditations were over. ' Only fancy,' said Helen to her brother, as they said good-night in the dimly-lighted gallery, ' a week, and we shall be in London ! I shall be going out with Aunt Harriet, and you will have your tutor. I hope he will worry you to death, just because you made me jump like that in the hall to-night, Avhen I was going in to dinner with papa. I'll never, never forgive it' After this Christian speech the pair separated."], [58, "CHAPTER III. THE THRONE STEPS. IT was four o'clock on the afternoon of the ist of May 188 \u2014 , and Tempeston was standing in a disconsolate way in his own room at Lord Grantown's house in Great Stanhope Street, Mayfair. The Avhole party had arrived at Waterloo at a quarter-past two that day, and were just then in the midst of the confusion of unpacking, Avhile all Avere a trifle cross at finding themselves in London. Each year it was a grievance to leave home for the Avilderness of bricks and mortar Avhich go to make up our modern Babylon. Lord GrantOAvn's decision, how ever, on the point Avas irrevocable.

He brought his children to London because he believed that, as a widower, it behoved him to keep them perpetually with him, though they, poor things, derived but little pleasure from the trip. In the morning, about nine o'clock, they walked in a deserted part of Hyde Park for half an hour, and then came lessons, which lasted to nearly luncheon time. Lord Grantown made a point of presiding at the mid day meal, though his presence certainly did not add to his children's appetite. He sat at the head of the table, solemn and sad, carving for them, but eating nothing himself, because it was not his custom to eat at two o'clock. The boy, as I have said, was standing in the middle of his room at four o'clock on the day of their arrival in town, when he received an unexpected summons from his father, to the effect that he was to put on his best hat and coat, and be ready to go out in half an hour."], [60, "56 Olga. 'Where is his lordship?' Tempeston asked of the butler, as soon as he was ready; and, having learned in reply that he Avas in the study, went thither. He opened the door softly, and, looking in, beheld, to his amazement, his father drinking tea. ' Come in,' said the latter encouragingly, as the boy paused, \u2014 ' come in and have a cup. I ordered it ex pressly for you.' ' Ordered it for me ! ' in a tone of surprise. ' Yes. I don't drink it myself as a rule, but, as I .vas tired and the tea was there, I thought it might refresh me.' ' But, papa, there Avould have been tea in the school room in half an hour \u2014 proper tea, you know,' Avith a look of contempt at the three little tiny slices of bread and butter. ' I could not Avait for you. It's nearly five noAv, and I have to be at the House. I am going to take you down also ; for I expect a gentleman to come to me in the lobby some time this afternoon, and I wish to intro duce you to him. I don't know when we shall be back, so I have ordered them to lay a place for you at dinner"], [61, "The Throne Steps. 57 to-night, as you have had to go without your proper tea, as you call it' Tempeston had never been at the House, and so was rather pleased. He knew fellows at Eton who used sometimes to go with their fathers, but hitherto he had never liked to ask to be taken. Those fellows' fathers were different from his, he thought sadly. When the three little slices had been eaten, and the tea consumed, Lord Grantown led the way to the brougham which was waiting at the hall door. The master of the house left a message for his eldest daughter, saying it might be a little after eight before they returned, and he Avould be glad if dinner could be put back a quarter of an hour. Then father and son stepped into the carriage and drove away. There was a silence for a little time betAveen the pair, and Tempeston Avondered Avhether he was expected to talk or hold his tongue. Some repairs were being done to the road in Curzon Street, and the coachman had therefore driven round by Park Lane and Picca dilly. They passed St. James's Club, and the boy tried to remember the name of it, but failed. He glanced"], [62, "58 Olga, up at the men looking out of the window at the passers by, and recalled how his schoolfellows used to talk glibly of this or that club to which their fathers belonged while he knew not whether his father had a club or not He was just reflecting over this, when a group of ' sand- Avich-men ' passed by, carrying advertisements of some new play which was being performed at one of the principal theatres. ' Oh, papa,' exclaimed the boy, without thinking much of Avhat he was saying, ' I should like to go to a theatre ! ' ' A what ! ' returned Lord Grantown in dismay. ' A theatre.' He was engrossed in the subject, and did not notice the tone of his father's voice. ' Do you think I should allow you to go to such a place?' ' But, papa, Smart and Charlie Stanley,' naming tAvo Etonians, ' used to go with their fathers.' ' I care nothing for that. Doubtless they are mere men of the Avorld, who wish their sons to be men of the world after them,' returned Lord GrantoAvn. 'And Bletchley, too; his father always took him'"], [63, "The Throne Steps. 59 Avent on the boy, warming to the subject, and speaking of the eldest son of a man whose name was respected throughout the length and breadth of the country for his philanthropy. The gentleman addressed was silent. He could not bring himself to abuse one whom everybody, from the Queen downwards, delighted to honour; and yet, in his own heart, he believed that the act of going to the theatre was altogether detrimental to the morals of youth. On the spur of the moment he could not find an answer to the lad's query. He was annoyed at the dilemma Tempeston had placed him in, and was also vexed that a child of his could entertain such a wish. ' Their fathers took them,' urged the youth, and still Lord Grantown sat silent. 'And I should like to go with you,' murmured the boy gently, and blushing a little, as though half afraid of what he was saying. It was not often' Tempeston spoke in that way ; indeed, his father had never heard him do so before. The truth was that the lad had been mentally contrast ing his own position with that of his former school-"], [64, "60 Olga, fellows. He recalled their delight when ' the governor' paid them a visit, and how Smart's father used to walk up and down under the shade of the great trees with his hand resting on his son's shoulder. A sudden wish had swept across the boy's mind that he might be as these lads were Avith their fathers; hence the sweet, gentle tone Avhich Lord GrantoAvn had never heard before. And in a moment there came over the latter again the weakness he had felt in the library on the night when he had watched through his half-closed eyes his son and daughter whispering lovingly and laughingly together. Once more, at the sound of the half-caressing murmur, ' I should like to go with you,' came the long ing to draAv his boy to himself as he had seen other fathers do; but he put it away from him as he had done before. It Avas his duty to ansAver this request in no uncertain tone, and yet for a moment he allowed himself a respite, Avhile his eyes dwelt on the handsome, flushed face beside him. He would like to have been able to grant his boy this favour, but it was impossible ; to do so would be to err against his whole rule of life."], [65, "The Throne Steps. 61 He was silent, Avhile his glance rested on Tempeston, and he kneAv that he was proud of his son. Frequently his brother peers brought their heirs to stand on the throne steps, and he bethought himself how common place the lads were as a rule. Now and then, only, was there a handsome one among them, and none that he had seen had ever eclipsed his boy. His boy ! Avith the curly brown hair and blue, blue eyes. He must hide from the lad all this weakness, must answer him sternly, coldly. He had never heard that gentle tone before ; would he hear it again if he ans.vered thus ? No matter ; it was his duty, and he .vould do it. AAvay with such weakness ! ' No son of mine,' Lord Grantown said sharply, ' shall do such a thing. What others do, I care not. I knoAv that such a place is bad, and you shall never go.' The momentary wish was gone from the lad. He had been a fool to think that his father could ever be as other fathers ; besides, he had forgotten for a second that which must always place a barrier betAveen them. What other father would have kept a son from his dying mother, but his ?"], [66, "Olga, 62 ' No,' the boy answered roughly, ' I suppose not, just because I said I should like it. If I hated going you'd take me fast enough. It's always the way with you.' What a great change ! Could this be the lad Avho had spoken but a moment ago so gently. Yes, duty was never easy, thought Lord GrantoAvn. If he had been weak and sinful, giving the permission asked for, he would have heard again the caressing tone ; because he had done right, this was the result. 1 Everything I ask for is refused,' the boy went on, as his temper rose. ' I don't often beg a favour of you, and I never will again. I wish, oh, I wish I had been born some one else's son instead of yours ! Then I would have had somebody Avho cared to do little things Avhen I asked.

'You are very young, my dear, and do not know what is for your good,' he said, putting out his hand and touching his son almost timidly. 'By and by, please God, you will recognise that I have been right in this. Come, we are just there. Do not\u2014 do not cry.' 'Leave me alone ! ' retorted the boy, turning his blue eyes full on his father and looking very fierce. ' I was a fool to mind.' To Lord Grantown's relief all trace of tears had vanished. His son was always handsome, he knew, but he thought he had never seen him look as beautiful as he did just then, with that flush on his cheek. He was glad that it should be so. He knew\u2014 or perhaps I should say he thought he knew, since every one really respected him\u2014 that he was sometimes an object of ridicule to his companions in the House, and it hurt him to feel this. But to-day things would be different. He led the way through the peers' entrance, while Tempeston followed, and as he passed a man here and there of whom yesterday he had been almost afraid, he"], [68, "Olga, 64 felt altogether different. And it was right, he con sidered, that it should be so. Had not the Royal Psalmist said that children were a gift from the Lord, and that the man Avho possessed them should not be ashamed Avhen he spake with his enemies in the gate ? As he returned the salutations of those he fancied most wont to ridicule him, \u2014 and Lord Grantown saw their glance turned once, twice, and even thrice upon the graceful young figure near him, \u2014 he told himself, in very truth, that he was not ashamed. He entered the House with a far more confident air than usual, telling the boy that he might either sit on the throne steps, or stand, as he preferred, provided he kept behind the gilt rail ; and then passed to his place, feeling still the spirit of that verse in the Psalms. And I, who saw the boy standing there that day, with his wavy hair, blue eyes, and comely, graceful figure, think that any man who had owned such a son should have felt as Lord Grantown did. The lad, left to himself, stood leaning across the bar, Avhile he made a careful survey of the magnificent chamber. The House was very full, since a specially"], [69, "The Throne Steps. 65 interesting debate relating to Ireland was on, and it was known that a division might be taken about seven or eight o'clock. A great orator, a brilliant statesman, and the leader of the party just then in Opposition, was on his legs, denouncing the occupants of the ministerial bench. As he leant across the table, in an attitude peculiar to him, the speaker declared that the hands of the Queen's ministers were morally red with the blood of every landlord and agent who had been murdered in Ireland during the previous winter ; and finally, after this parting shot, sat down amidst loud applause. Then from the ministerial bench arose an old gentleman with grey hair, Avho, Tempeston thought the moment he began to speak, was the most perfect old gentleman he had ever seen in his life. He wore a black frock coat, loosely buttoned, a check neckcloth, tied in a very large bow, whilst he leant on a Avalking stick as he spoke, having recently, so he informed the House, recovered from an attack of gout. The old gentleman, in the most dulcet tones, re plied to the strictures of the noble speaker opposite, 5"], [70, "66 Olga, and proved conclusively \u2014 at least, to the minds of his own supporters \u2014 that all a Government could do had been done to maintain law and order in Ireland. After that he sat doAvn, and some one else rose, to whom nobody appeared to pay the slightest attention. Tempeston, leaning across the rail, was just thinking it very bad manners for so many of those present to talk Avhilst one of their number was speaking, when his attention was attracted by somebody close by, regarding him carefully. The stranger was a tall, slight man, at least six feet in height, and of the most distinguished appearance. He had eyes of greyish blue, remarkably handsome features, and a small imperial. This last, like the hair on his head, was just tinged with Avhite, although he Avas not much past fifty, and, indeed, he looked some ten years younger. He leaned against the woodwork on the ministerial side of the House, and regarded Tempeston, as I have said, carefully. It Avas a kind face, but yet it wore so sad an expression that the boy could not help noticing it. Presently Tempeston observed the tall stranger stop"], [71, "The Throne Steps. 67 a passer-by, and say something. He knew directly what it was, for the latter turned and looked at him ; then shook his head. Evidently the gentleman had asked his friend if he knew who he, Tempeston, was. The boy blushed, but was conscious of a feeling of pleasure. Every time he glanced in the same direction he met the blue-grey eyes, and each time he could not help thinking how sadly they looked at him. At length, turning to see if they were still regarding him, he found the stranger close beside him. The latter looked down and smiled kindly. ' Is this your first visit to the House ? ' he asked. ' Yes.' ' And how do you like it ? ' ' Oh, very much.' * And did you understand the debate ? ' * A little, not all.

' And yet, I daresay, he may meet your friend with the Avalking-stick somewhere this evening, and chat away with him.' ' Really,' said the boy, ' I should not have thought that. I can understand fellows, after they have quarrelled and had it out in a mill, making it up.' The stranger laughed at the boy's answer. ' They have been scolding each other across that table for years past, \u2014 in fact, ever since they have been in the House together, \u2014 but that would not prevent their being friends out of doors. But tell me, which side does your father sit ? perhaps I know him.' ' That is him there, low down on the left,' replied the boy, pointing to the end of the Conservative benches, near the bar. ' Where\u2014 which ? ' said the gentleman hurriedly ; ' not \u2014 not Grantown ? ' ' Yes.' Glancing up at the stranger, Tempeston thought he"], [73, "THE STRANGER LAUGHED AT THE BOY'S ANSWER."], [74, ""], [75, "The Throne Steps. 71 saw an involuntary smile pass across his face, but, if so, it was quickly repressed. ' And are you at Eton ? ' ' Not now. I was, but papa has just taken me away, because I did not get on fast enough.' ' Ah, that's a pity. You were sorry to leave ? ' ' Oh yes.' ' I can fancy that I am an old Etonian myself How long have you been there ? ' ' Three years.' ' And how old are you ? ' ' Fifteen.'

Just at that moment the statesman with the dark beard intimated that he should not use his power and divide the House. No sooner Avas this announcement made, than nearly every one present took their de parture as rapidly as possible. The old gentleman Avith the walking-stick opened a despatch-box, and began reading some papers, while a grey-headed man opposite was making a speech in a very Ioav voice. Still, in spite of the deserted aspect of the chamber, the tall stranger lingered beside Tempeston. ' Very likely your father will speak in a minute,' he Avhispered to the boy ; ' he generally does, Avhen there's anything of this sort on.' ' Is \u2014 is it anything to do with the bishops ?

His companion laughed ' Lord Dreadrington is asking the Government to"], [77, "The Throne Steps. 73 introduce a bill making religious instruction compulsory in Board schools ; your father is certain to support him.' Lord GrantOAvn, however, did not get an opportunity. The moment the speaker had ceased, the kindly old gentleman with the walking-stick rose from his seat. It Avas his mission in life to often pour oil on troubled waters. He stood at the table then, and sought to console the disturbed nobleman, while refusing him that which his soul craved. He refused him, yet he did not leave him quite without comfort. He did not say that, at some future period, the Government would introduce such a bill, but he hinted, or seemed to hint, at some such possibility. Then Lord Dreadrington, having aired his grievance, expressed himself satisfied ; at which Tempeston's father exclaimed, ' No, no ! ' and the old gentleman with the walking-stick in great haste moved the adjournment. Lord Grantown stared in amazement at the stranger, who was explaining some Parliamentary rule to his son just as he came up. It was evident that the two men, though they knew each other's names and appearances, were not acquainted. The unknown bowed."], [78, "74 Olga ' I am initiating your boy into the mysteries of the House,' he said, with a smile. Lord Grantown looked half gratified, yet half dis trustful, as he replied something about his son, and being very much obliged. ' I expect your new tutor is in the lobby, Tempest, so we had better go and look for him there. He has been in the gallery during the sitting.' This was why he had been brought down to the House, then, the boy thought. He looked up at his new friend, as he prepared to follow his father from the chamber, as though uncertain whether to say good-bye. ' I am going out through Westminster Hall,' the stranger replied to the glance ; ' so I will come with you through the lobby.' When they reached the vestibule, they found a short, stout gentleman, with a schoolmaster's air, aAvaiting them, and Tempeston guessed at once that this was the new tutor. ' I must not keep you,' said the unknown. ' Lord Grantown, Ave have sat opposite each other for many years Avithout being introduced. I hope, however,"], [79, "The Throne Steps. 75 after to-night we may consider ourselves acquainted. Perhaps, I may add, we are about to become near neighbours in the country.' ' Indeed ! ' in a tone of surprise. ' Yes,' was the reply. ' Our real home in Shropshire has been shut up for the last two years, and my wife cannot yet make up her mind to go back there. Constant change of scene has been good for her, but this autumn we mean to remain in England, and shall pass the long recess at Shirley Park.' ' I had forgotten it belonged to you,' Lord Grantown said, looking rather startled ; ' I remember it now, of course.' ' Shirley ! ' exclaimed the boy eagerly ; ' oh, I am so pleased ! I shall see you again there.' 'I hope we may not have to wait till August for that,' was the kind reply. 'Perhaps your father will allow you to come and see me at luncheon to-morrow?' ' May I, papa ? ' 'I\u2014 I\u2014 really \u2014 I fear it may inconvenience you,' stammered Lord Grantown, evidently ill at ease, and not knowing exactly what to say."], [80, "6 Olga. 76 ' It Avill give me great pleasure. I hope you will trust your boy to me,' was the courteous return. ' Oh \u2014 oh, certainly ! ' Very Avell, then, at tAvo o'clock to-morrow, Number Carlton House Terrace. I shall expect you.' ' Oh, I Avill be there ! ' exclaimed the boy. The stranger shook hands with Lord GrantoAvn and his son, then, listing his hat to the tutor, Avho Avas standing by, Avent down the passage towards West minster Hall. ' Surely,' exclaimed the fat little man, ' I have seen that face before. Is it not the Marquis of Meltonbury, the Privy Seal in this Ministry?' ' The same,' Lord Grantown replied. ' Of course,' said the tutor, ' I kneAv it was. I have been told, too, that he is a very rising man.' ' Yes,' replied the other, ' and, I fear, a some what worldly one besides. His Avise, too, is, I am told, an ambitious woman, and I Avould rather Tempeston should not visit them ; but, if Ave are to be near neighbours, I do not see how it can be avoided.'"], [81, "The Throne Steps. 77 ' It is a difficult matter, certainly,' was the answer. 'But is not this my new pupil, Lord Grantown?' ' Yes, and I hope you will be able to make more of him than others have done.' ' Ah, I daresay, I daresay ! In my time I have had some experience of young gentlemen who would not work, but I have rarely failed in the end to make them do so. My young friend here, however, will, I hope, not give much trouble.' ' You hear what Mr. Marshall says, Tempeston,' said his father. ' I hope that you intend to turn over a new leaf.' The boy's temper was easily roused, and he flushed angrily at the last remark, made in a public place, especially as he saw one of the officials standing near smile. 'You hear?' repeated Lord Grantown. ' I'm not deaf,' retorted his son ; ' and I Avish you would not speak so loud ! Every one is listening.' Tempeston would probably have received a very stern rebuke for such a piece of disrespect, on an ordinary occasion ; but Lord GrantOAvn knew the lad's"], [82, "78 Olga. hot temper, and, not .vishing to have a scene in the lobby, held his peace. The tutor looked rather astonished. ' Would the day. after to-morrow suit ? ' the latter asked, in reply to Lord Grantown, who requested to know when he could conveniently commence his duties. ' Certainly, certainly ; and to-morrow Tempeston can do a little work with me, so as to prepare something for you and shoAV you how far be is advanced. I fear you will find that he is very much behind-hand.' The tutor rubbed his hands and smiled ' What a wretch he looks ! ' the boy thought. ' I shall hate him ; I know I shall.' ' The day after to-morrow, then ? ' Lord Grantown asked. Mr. Marshall smirked and bowed, and then the nobleman held out his hand, saying something about its being late, and time that they were at home. The father and son did not speak during their drive to Great Stanhope Street."], [83, "CHAPTER IV. OLGA. IT wanted ten minutes to two the next day when Tempeston found himself on Carlton House Terrace. The boy, who had driven down in a hansom as far as the United Service Club, looked as neat as a new pin, and had not even a speck of dust on his patent leather boots. 'I suppose I'd better wait another five minutes,' he said to himself. ' It's too early yet' He made out the position of the house, which was situated at the east end of the terrace, and one or two doors beyond the Duke of York's column. Though he was very anxious to see his kind friend of yesterday, he felt, now he had come,^half-inclined to run away.'"], [84, "80 Olm. Suppose there was a croAvd of people at luncheon, and no one he knew ! That would be dreadful ! He glanced up at the great house, Avith its hanging gardens of scarlet geraniums and large balcony carefully sheltered by a striped aAvning, but found nothing particular to encourage him. ' I suppose it's time to go in noAv,' he said, looking at his gold watch, and, having mounted the steps, pulled the bell. The door Avas opened by a grave-looking butler, and in the hall Avere two or three poAvdered footmen dressed in sober black. The boy gave his hat and umbrella to one of the servants, and followed the butler up the broad flight of stairs to the dra.ving-room. The man, it seemed, knew his name, for he threw open the doors and announced him Avithout asking for it. Tempeston entered the great room, feeling rather shy. He glanced round the splendid suite of apart ments opening one out of the other. What a contrast to the dull, dingy draAving-room in Great Stanhope Street, with its sombre green damask hangings ! Here"], [85, "Olga. 8 1 were white marble statues, chandeliers filled Avith waxen tapers, silken draperies, paintings of rarest value, trifles of costliest art, while the air seemed heavy with the scent of flowers. As the boy was announced, a lady seated in the back drawing-room at a writing-table rose and came for- Avard. She was a woman of about eight-and-thirty, and still remarkably beautiful. Her dark hair was arranged very simply, while her eyes were so full of expression that they seemed literally to speak. She was dressed in a long black silk, ornamented here and there with crape trimmings ; and she came forward and welcomed the lad in a manner full of winning courtesy. Many people said of Lady Meltonbury that she was 'a humbug,' or that she was 'all things to all men.' The individuals who made these assertions were them selves ignorant of the name even of the virtue practised by the lady in question. In an age in which people give their left hand to their friends to shake, or tell them boldly to their faces that it is too much trouble to get up and greet them, it is perhaps not to be wondered at that Lady Meltonbury and her ways 6"], [86, "Olga. 82 attracted attention. She herself, being not only a refined, but also a good Avoman, practised a virtue which has almost died out noAv, but which was common enough once in the apostolic ages, the virtue of Christian courtesy. Whoever came to her she met half-way across the apartment ; when they left her she Avent with them to the door of the room, in order to do them greater honour. If she had enemies, she had also friends. Those who realty knew her knew what she was \u2014 the type of a Christian, high-bred lady. Tempeston thought, as he stood talking to her, that he had never seen any one he liked so much. She was so kind, so gracious, she made him feel as if he had known her for years instead of about two minutes. The boy had hardly thought of this when something else struck him. She looked at him \u2014 as he fancied Lord Meltonbury had done the previous evening \u2014 sadly. What was it, he wondered ? The drawing-room door opened just at that moment, and the master of the house entered. He looked even more dignified than yesterday, but his face lighted up Avhen he saAv his young guest. He came forward and"], [87, "Olga. 83 gave him a kindly greeting, then he turned to his wife. ' What do you think ? ' he asked. 'I see it\u2014 I saw it the moment he came,' she answered quickly, almost nervously. Lord Meltonbury drew the boy closer to him, and rested his hand on the youthful shoulder. Something in the attitude seemed to recall the past to his wife, and she left the room. 'Is anything\u2014 have I done anything wrong?' Tem peston asked, astonished. ' No, no,' his host answered quickly ; ' I will tell you, dear boy, what it is. You bear a likeness\u2014 a very extraordinary likeness-to our son, our only son, who is dead.' The sad looks were explained now. There was a silence for a little space. Tempeston, hot-tempered and passionate as he Avas, had a warm, loving heart. He glanced up, with his blue eyes full of tears, at the kind, grave face above him. Lord Meltonbury softly patted him on the shoulder without speaking. After a few minutes the lady of the house returned,"], [88, "84 Olga and began to talk upon indifferent subjects, yet such as would naturally interest an Etonian. Cricket, boat ing, the best way of passing the time in London during the hot Aveather ; all a boy's pleasures and little disagreeables Lady Meltonbury seemed perfectly acquainted with. Suddenly the sound of the gong interrupted the conversation. ' There,' she said, rising ; ' we will go and have some luncheon ; ' then, looking towards the window opening on to the shaded balcony, she called ' Olga ! ' There was a stir among the chairs outside, and then between the lace curtains a vision appeared, the like of which Tempeston had never seen before. It was the form of a little maiden of about fourteen years of age, with a face of rare promise. The curly golden hair was cut short all round the little head, the eyebrows were delicately pencilled, while the eyes themselves, when not hidden by the trailing black lashes, were of the loveliest grey. The nose was perfect in shape, the little lips red as cherries, while the dimpled cheeks had the flush of the wild rose on them. The child was dressed in a white frock, elegantly"], [89, "IT WAS THE FORM OF A LITTLE MAIDEN OF ABOUT FOURTEEN. 86"], [90, ""], [91, "Olga. 87 trimmed with lace, and here and there a black ribbon bow, which showed she was still in mourning. Tem peston almost held his breath for a moment as he watched the picture ; she looked so like a little visitant from another world. ' Did you call, mama ? ' asked a clear, ringing voice. ' Yes ; the gong has sounded for luncheon. Did you not hear it ? Come in and be introduced to my friend here. I daresay, if you ask him, he will tell you all about your cousin Willy at Eton. Tempeston, this is my little daughter.' The big grey eyes lifted themselves for a minute to the boy's face, and then were hidden again by the long lashes. ' Come,' said Lady Meltonbury, ' let us go down-stairs.' The dining-room, which looked out towards the parade-ground at the back of the Foreign Office, felt cool and pleasant. All the windows were open, but thick outside blinds excluded the sun's powerful rays, while there, as in the drawing-room, the air was scented with flowers. * It's as hot as July, I declare,' said Lord Meltonbury."], [92, "Olga. 88 ' If it goes on like this we shall all be burned up before the end of the session.' ' I hope it will be as fine on Tuesday,' replied his Avise. ' I ahvays feel so sorry when it is a Avet drawing room day.' ' My sister \u2014 my eldest sister, that is \u2014 is going to be presented at it,' Tempeston remarked. ' Is she ? ' said Lady Meltonbury, Avith a kindly smile of interest. ' Tell me all about her, and is she very pretty ? ' Poor Tempeston, though he Avas very fond of both his sisters, in spite of violent quarrels with them, had never stopped to consider before whether they Avere pretty or not. His host saAv the difficulty and came to the rescue Avith a laugh. ' My dear Catherine, Tempeston, like all brothers of his age, scarcely knoAvs whether his sisters have eyes and noses like other people.' The boy, who happened to be just glancing at the fairy-like vision in white opposite, saw the grey eyes open wide in surprise at these Avoids. The little face turned eagerly, as though to contradict her father's"], [93, "Olga. 89 assertion, then suddenly she sighed, as though remem bering something, and the black lashes fell again. Tempeston guessed that the dead brother had been more observant than he had been. 'So should I,' he thought, 'if Helen and Lina were like that.' ' Where are your thoughts now, my boy ? ' asked Lord Meltonbury, as the butler asked the former for the third time Avhether he would have hock or claret-cup. 'Oh, I beg your pardon!' stammered Tempeston, getting very red, and turning to his host, still in ignorance of the grave domestic beside him ' It's merely a question of your own comfort ; take your choice ; ' and Lord Meltonbury pointed laughingly to the servant. ' Oh, claret-cup, please,' said Tempeston, remembering that he Avas very thirsty and the day very hot. ' And what has my good little girl been doing ? ' the master of the house asked, when the domestics had withdrawn. ' When, papa ? '"], [94, "Olga. 90 ' Since she finished her lessons at midday.' ' I have been lying down on the balcony. Miss Proctor said it Avas too hot for me to go out.' ' So I should think. I never knew Aveather so Avarm early in May. What were you doing to amuse yourself all the time you were lying doAvn ?' ' I was reading \u2014 reading history.' ' But, my child, you should do that in school-time. That's not amusement' ' Oh, but, papa, it is amusement. I did not read it because I was obliged, but because I liked it' ' She still thinks too much, Catherine,' Lord Melton bury said, looking across at his Avise Avith an anxious expression on his countenance. ' She does indeed. If I only kneAv some way to keep that busy little brain quiet ! ' 'But, mamma,' broke in the girl, laughing, 'perhaps I do not Avish that it should be quiet.' Lady Meltonbury shook her head. 'We must find some way of amusing her. I do not think she cares much for driving about the hot streets, though I drag her with me every afternoon. Riding did her more"], [95, "Olga. 91 good than anything. I don't see why she should not go on with it in town, only it's too hot in the morning, and just at five o'clock, when she could go, you are at the House.' 'And obliged to be there too. I suppose I could hardly resign office on the ground of having to take my little daughter for a ride ! ' His wife smiled, a sweet yet sad smile. She was thinking of how but for that cruel scarlet fever the girl's brother would have been there to take her out,\u2014 the boy brother Avho Avas so proud of his graceful, beautiful sister, and was wont to declare that there was no one in all the world the least like her. The dining-room in Carlton House Terrace faded away from Lady Meltonbury's thoughts. She was back again in the stately old Shropshire home, in her own apartment. From her windows she could see the miles of park land, the hills crowned with their forests of green, the winding stream, and nearer the gardens\u2014 a blaze of red, white, and yellow. She could picture herself seated there with her daughter beside her, and could almost hear the clatter of feet tearing doAvn the"], [96, "Olga. 92 gallery, see the door burst open, and feel a pair of arms round her neck. Then the news Avhich had to be told, the trout that had been caught, the pheasants shot, the foxes killed, or the runs scored in the cricket field Avith scratch elevens made up of village boys, grooms from the stables, and servants from the house. And with these thoughts came also to Lady Melton bury's mind the remembrance of that day when the boy had come in from shooting Avith his father, and had told her how he had missed everything. He said he thought his arm was weak, and oh, how sore his throat Avas, and his head did ache so ! The mother felt as if she could still feel the hot hands and see the flushed cheeks. She remembered his dozing there, Avith his head on her knee and his muddy shooting-boots soiling the satin sofa cushions. She recalled the doctor coming and asking to see his chest, and saying, ' Hem ! scarlet fever ! ' That was on the Tuesday, and the next day the medical man added another word to his diagnosis, ' Malignant scarlet fever.' Then came Thursday, and on Thursday the boy died. And even"], [97, "Olga. 93 though three years had passed aAvay since then, it seemed but yesterday, and she had seen her darling lying among the snoAv-white sheets, lilies, and azaleas. The funeral was a thing as clear in her mind as if it had just taken place. She had gone to it \u2014 she, his mother ! The bright September sun had never shone more brightly, the birds had never sung, oh, surely ! half so gaily. The hired men in black had little to do. Their work was taken from them, and, in spite of warnings as to infection, the light weight was carried from the house to the chapel, and there tenderly lowered to the vault by grooms and servants. Close behind the coffin in the procession had come the lad's favourite hunter, led by the stud groom. Ever)' one was there to do homage to the dead boy. Half the county stood round the open grave, but Lady Meltonbury scarcely noted these. It was the people from the hamlets for miles around, the weeping village boys, she saw and cared about.

'What proposal, dear?' she asked. Lord Meltonbury sighed. He knew Avhat she had been thinking about as Avell as if she had told him. He was ahvays doing it himself, for the matter of that. ' Here's Tempeston can ride. His horse is at home, but he can have one of mine. I should think he might take Olga out. What do you say? Simmons, of course, would go Avith them.' Lady Meltonbury looked a little doubtful. Her husband interpreted her glance, and turned to his young guest. ' How old are you ? ' he asked. 'Fifteen,' the boy replied."], [99, "Olga. 95 Fifteen plus fourteen. They don't make up thirty between them, Catherine. I think it's a good idea.' ' Would you like it ?

' Oh,' said the boy, blushing, ' I should like it of all things ; but I could only go at half-past five, as I am going to do lessons all day with a tutor. Even then I should have to go without my tea, but I don't mind that for the sake of a ride.' 'We won't tax you so hardly,' exclaimed Lady Meltonbury, with a smile. ' Miss Proctor will give you both some tea when you return at seven. Three rides a week, I should think, Avould be enough, and the other afternoons my little woman must be content to drive about Avith me.' ' Oh, mother, I like that too !

' Young people are always better without money.' ' Papa ? ' said his daughter. ' Well ? ' ' But, papa, I don't think so.' ' Very likely not, Olga. You see you and Tempeston look at the question from an opposite point of view from Lord Grantown and myself.' The child smiled. ' But do you mean seriously that you think money is not good for us until we are grown up ?

Three of the party ascended the broad flight of steps, and entered the beautiful drawing-rooms, while the master of the house lingered behind, detained by the arrival of a big official letter. ' What do they call you at home ?' said Lady Melton bury, resting her hand on her young guest's shoulder. ' At home ? Oh, I know what you mean \u2014 Tempest' ' Then I shall call you Tempest too.

Lady Meltonbury rose and drew the boy to herself. ' I know and understand what you feel,' she whispered to him, 'though we are all differently constituted. Some, like you, cannot bear to speak of their loss, while others are comforted by it For my part, I love to talk of my boy. I could talk of him all day long. Would you like to see his picture ?

The features were exactly similar to those of the dead boy's father, and there was the same unstudied grace in the attitude of the lad, represented, as he Avas, leaning Avith his back to a table on which his elbows rested. He Avas painted in hunting costume, and his hand held a Avhip, while a favourite hound lay at his feet. There was something so beautiful in the expression of the face that Tempeston felt fascinated by it.

As long as the family stayed in town he was to come by the day, but Avhen once they had returned to the country Mr. Marshall was to take up his abode with them permanently. Lord GrantoAvn carried off the tutor into his own library for a private conversation, which lasted nearly half an hour, during which Tempeston hung about the hall, and felt very uncomfortable. At length the door of his father's sanctum opened, and the pair came out. Mr. Marshall was, as I have said, a short, fat man,"], [108, "Olga. 104 and, I might have added, an ugly one. Though he Avas only about five-and-thirty, yet he was already bald, which made him look considerably older. His cheeks were puffy and remarkable for a brilliant colour, while his eyes were like two large black beads. Alto gether the tutor was not a prepossessing person, and his new pupil felt sure he should not like him. ' Well, young man,' said the former, addressing Tempeston, and shaking hands after the manner of a prize-fighter with his opponent before commencing a combat, \u2014 ' well, young man, and are you prepared to work hard ?

I have been showing Mr. Marshall all the letters I received from Eton about you, and he comprehends everything.'"], [109, "Disobedience. i o 5 These letters were very sore subjects to the boy at any time, and especially so just then, when he was so full of good resolutions. Unfortunately they were not confined to complaints about idleness ; but related to several foolish scrapes into which the lad had got, including the famous absence for the whole of one Ascot cup day, and which had so nearly resulted in expulsion. It would, perhaps, have been better if Lord Grantown had not informed his son that he had thought it advisable to show the epistles in question to Mr. Marshall. True, he had done so solely because he believed it best that the tutor should fully understand his pupil's character, but Tempeston never stopped to think of that. When his father spoke of the infor mation he had given Mr. Marshall, the boy did not answer, but shot at him a glance so full of hatred that Lord Grantown was absolutely startled. All the good intentions which Tempeston had made after his interview with Lady Meltonbury vanished at once. If he was to be thought and called a black sheep, then a black sheep he would most certainly be. He had known the moment he had seen Mr. Marshall in the"], [110, "Olga. 106 lobby of the House of Lords that he should not like him ; but he had meant to try and Avork hard and keep out of mischief. Now all that Avas over. He would have to sit Avith his tutor Avhen his tutor came, but that was all he would do. As to preparing lessons, or anything of that sort, Tempeston told himself, in expressive but schoolboy slang, ' that he Avould be hung first and then he wouldn't' Lord GrantoAvn saAv his son's look of hatred, and saAv, too, that the young face settled into a very determined expression, as though it had taken a resolution and meant to keep it. ' What do you mean, sir, by looking at me like that ? If I think it's my duty to inform Mr. Marshall of your faults, for your own good, is that a reason for you to become sulky and get into a passion ? ' ' I'm not in a passion,' the boy retorted. ' There, Mr. Marshall, you see thus early the truth of what I told you. I hope you will keep a firm hold over him ; I leave him entirely in your charge.' ' I will do my best, my lord,' the tutor ans .vered ; ' but I fear, from what I see, my task will be no easy one."], [111, "Disobedience. 107 Come into the study, sir, and let me see how far you are advanced.' 'And, oh, Mr. Marshall,' broke in Lord Grantown, ' whatever lessons you set him, kindly leave me a note of them. I will see that they are duly prepared in my library before he goes out.' ' Thank you, my lord. Come, sir, come.' The tutor led the way into a dingy back chamber, Avhich had been originally intended for a smoking room, but in Lord Grantown's house was used for no particular purpose. This apartment had now been made over formally to Mr. Marshall, for the use of himself and pupil. ' And Avhere are your books ? ' the former asked ; ' where are the books you used at Eton ? ' The boy turned round to Avhere he had placed them, in a cupboard by the window, and taking out some half dozen jerked them on to the table. ' Dear me, Lord Tempeston,' exclaimed Mr. Marshall angrily, ' that's a very rude way of placing the volumes before me. Take the books up again and arrange them neatly.'"], [112, "Olga. 108 The boy was hardly prepared to have a disagreement Avith a stranger so soon ; he therefore complied, though not with the best grace. ' Hem ! C\u00e6sar, Ovid, English History, Colenso's Arithmetic \u2014 all good books; and, dear me, what's this ?' holding out one of Bohn's literal translations. ' What ? ' said Tempeston, looking up from the book cupboard in which he Avas still rummaging ; ' oh, that ! that's my crib to Horace ! ' ' Your crib ! What do you mean, sir ? ' ' Why, it's what I used to do my work with at Eton.' ' I never heard such a flagrant piece of dishonesty in all my life ! ' 'What!' exclaimed Tempeston, springing up angrily at the word ' dishonesty,' \u2014 - Avhat do you say ? ' The boy looked so fierce that Mr. Marshall, although a strong man, felt rather uncomfortable. Lord Gran town had spoken of his son that morning as though he was half a wild animal, and the tutor would, I think, not have been surprised if the lad had sprung at him, then and there. ' No violence, please,' said Mr. Marshall, holding up"], [113, "Disobedience. 109 his left hand. ' If you reflect for a moment you will perceive that I used a correct term ! By means of this \u2014 this translation ' (Mr. Marshall thought the term crib too slangy) ' you got up your lessons, \u2014 that is, you palmed off the knowledge you had obtained in a dis honest way, as though it were the result of hard and careful work. If you can apply to such conduct any other word except that which I have used, I shall be happy to hear your explanation.' Whatever faults Tempeston had, he Avas truthful and honourable in the extreme. The expression which his new tutor had used was offensive to him in the highest degree, but he began to see. that Mr. Marshall had used it Avith some reason, though under a misappre hension. All the anger faded away out of the boy's face, and he began to laugh. ' It was not dishonest,' he said. ' The masters kneAV it perfectly well. They can't prevent it' ' Knew that you cribbed, as you call it ? ' ' I and half the other fellows.' ' Impossible ! ' 1 Ask any Eton master, and he will tell you so. Ask"], [114, "Olga. 110 Jackson, Avho was a town - boy there once, and see what he will say. Of course, if caught, a fellow would catch it.' ' I can scarcely credit my ears,' exclaimed Mr. Marshall, on Avhom, however, the conviction was groAving that he did not understand the Avays and customs of the great public school in question, and that it was better to let the subject drop. Meanwhile he confis cated all Tempeston's classical translations, intimating that he wished, as a matter of interest, to look through them carefully. As the boy had never been in the habit of preparing his Avork without the aid of a crib, he began to wonder how he should get on. It did not matter, however; the worst that Mr. Marshall could do would be to complain of him to his father, and Tempeston found that every day his dislike for the latter increased, Avhile the fear of him died a.vay. The morning crept slowly on. Mr. Marshall having become more civil, the boy condescended to translate Latin into bad English, and Greek into something Avhich Avas certainly not the vulgar tongue.

At length, when Tem- peston had calculated the number of men required to dig ditches of various lengths in various spaces of time, the clock chimed a quarter to two, and Mr. Marshall said he thought that Avould be enough for the day. Poor Tempeston ! he felt he had never done so much work in the whole of his life. Ever since half-past ten he had sat at that table and racked his brains. Good gracious ! he should never be able to go on at that rate. He had just thought this, when his tutor handed him a slip of paper, on which was written the lessons he required his pupil to prepare for the next day. The boy, glancing at it, beheld C\u00e6sar, Horace, some mathematics, and, as a crown to all his Avoe, a set of Latin verses. He knew, from past experience, that, if he sat down then and there, he might\u2014 it was by no means certain, but still he might\u2014 conclude his task by seven o'clock. And at half-past five he was to be on Carlton House Terrace to ride with Olga, and after wards to have tea there."], [116, "Olga. 112 ' It's too much,' he gasped out. 'Your father will sit Avith you,' said Mr. Marshall. ' He has kindly promised to help you. We thought two hours and a half would be sufficient, but if it is not you must lengthen it by another hour. Now I will just see Lord GrantoAvn for a moment or two. Good morning.' Tempeston, left alone, made one remark out loud : ' I'll keep the appointment, though, let them do Avhat they will.' Then he ran up-stairs to dress ready for riding, so as to set at his books immediately after luncheon. He took everything he could possibly want, except a whip.

What he Avas to do if his father sat till half-past five, he scarcely kneAv. If the Avorst came to the Avorst, he could steal out of the library at a quarter past, open the hall door, and hail a hansom. To do that he must have his hat in the hall. Accordingly, ten minutes after the rest of the household Avere assembled round the luncheon table, the boy came out of his room, and, running"], [117, "Disobedience. 1 1 3 quickly down-stairs, deposited his best ' topper ' in a safe place, then, opening the dining-room door, entered the apartment. Mr. Marshall had gone for the day evidently, as he was not there. ' How is this, Tempest ? ' Lord Grantown asked. ' How is it that you come ten minutes late ? ' ' Because,' retorted the lad, who certainly was not in the best of humours at that moment, ' because I didn't leave off lessons till just on two o'clock.' ' And how long do you take to wash your hands ? ' ' I had more to do than that. I had to change my clothes.' 'Why?' ' I have to go out by and by,' replied the boy, letting slip the very thing he had meant to keep secret. ' Where, sir, and Avhen ? ' asked Lord GrantoAvn ' To meet a friend at half-past five.' 'Then you won't do anything of the kind, as a punishment for answering in the way you have. You will come to me in the library at half-past three, for a couple of hours, to prepare your lessons for to-morrow.' The boy lost his temper at once. ' Take that away,' 8"], [118, "Olga. 114 he said to the butler, Avho handed him some beef which his father had carved.

Such a breach of rules had never before been committed as that now perpetrated by Tempeston. Lord Grantown watched his son's proceedings in amazement. Helen, Lina, and Miss Emmett ex changed frightened glances, anticipating a scene ; but nothing happened. The boy was fifteen, and Lord GrantoAvn felt he could hardly prevent his eating mutton cutlets if he preferred them to beef. He held his tongue, and let the affair pass. The moment luncheon .vas finished, Tempeston dashed into the little study and began to Avork. He had dropped the idea of refusing to labour, as Mr."], [119, "Disobedience. 115 Marshall had on the whole been civil. With wonderful prudence the boy determined to leave the Latin verses to the last, and applied himself diligently to the mathematics, C\u00e6sar, and Horace. He vanquished several more workmen digging ditches, moved C\u00e6sar about in Gaul without much difficulty, and then dis- covered to his delight that the ode in Horace was one he had frequently translated before, the English of which he knew by heart. By this time it was half-past three, and he accordingly packed up his books and took himself off to the library. His father was already there. ' Begin with the C\u00e6sar,' the latter said. ' I have done it,' replied the boy ; ' there it is ; ' and he pointed to a fair copy translation. ' When did you do it ? ' ' After luncheon.' ' Oh, well, take the Horace.' ' That's done too.'

Those will take me some time, you know.' ' Don't hurry over them, then,' was the answer. ' In any case, you will have to remain in this room until it is half-past five o'clock.' Tempeston said nothing, but sat down to work. The afternoon was very hot, and he felt anything but inclined for more study ; nevertheless, he went at it with a will. The anticipated ride kept him up. When the clock struck four the boy had done three verses out of eight. Lord Grantown was pleased to see his son working so diligently, and, rising from his chair, went over to where he was sitting, and, wonderful to relate, rested his hand on the lad's shoulder. ' How are you getting on ? ' he asked. Now, it so happened that he bent over his son at a most unpropitious moment. Tempeston wanted a dactyl and could only find spondees. ' Don't,' he said, shaking his father's hand off roughly. ' I wish you would not ; you make me so hot !

The clock ticked away on the mantelpiece, and Lord Grantown sat in his easy chair, watching his son, whose face was still hidden in his arms. He began to feel sorry he had acted a little impulsively and destroyed the verses ; yet he told himself it was necessary that he should punish the boy. He Avished the lad would raise his head, and begin to work again. He did not like to see him sitting there so dejected. Though Lord Grantown appeared hard and cold, in reality he was far from being so, and he loved his children dearly. True, they were Avholly ignorant of it, but that Avas because he had carefully hidden the fact from them as though it were a weakness. He believed that if he exhibited his affection there Avould have been an end to all that obedience he required from his offspring. Thus the love was pushed out of sight, and the children believed that it did not exist."], [123, "Disobedience. 119 Five o'clock struck, and still Tempeston lay quiet. The boy had by this time entirely forgotten the verses, and was simply wondering how on earth he was to keep his appointment. He heard the chimes, and moved his feet impatiently. He would sit there quietly until the quarter struck, and then jump up and run for it. His father Avas seated at the end of the room, so that he would have a fair start Tempeston had just concluded this desperate resolve Avhen the door opened, and the footman announced that a gentleman was in the drawing-room waiting to see his master.

The boy, left alone in the library, glanced first at the clock. It Avas only ten minutes past five, so he had plenty of time. He listened to hear if all was quiet, and, finding it was so, softly opened the door and passed out into the hall. Once there the lad did not"], [124, "Olga 1 20 linger, but caught up his hat and dashed out of the house.

The boy sprang quickly out, flung the man double his fare, and, dashing up the steps, impatiently pulled the bell. The first person Tempeston saw in the hall was Lady Olga, standing ready dressed in her habit and hat. The child looked even more lovely in riding costume than in the elegant white dress and lace of the previous day. ' Oh, I hope I have not kept you Avaiting !' exclaimed Tempeston ; ' it was not my fault'"], [126, "Olga 122 ' It is only just the half hour, and I am only just ready,' Avas the reply.

The groom assisted Lady Olga to mount, and then, Tempeston throwing himself into the saddle, they were soon ready and off. The day Avas a very Avarm one, and the horses walked quietly along Pall Mall, which was filled Avith carriages of all kinds, hansoms, and four-wheelers. There was a silence for some time between the tAvo children, Avhile the boy tortured his brain to find a subject for conversation. He glanced at his companion, but she was gazing up at the AvindoAvs of the Travellers' Club, and did not appear to be thinking about him at all. ' I wish,' thought Tempeston, ' I could find something to say. She will think me so stupid.'

' I never call for him anywhere,' Tempeston returned, looking very hot and uncomfortable.

Lady Olga lifted her eyebrows, and looked rather doubtfully at her companion."], [128, "124 Olga. ' It's not my fault,' the boy broke in quickly, noticing the glance; 'at least, I mean, not always.' 'But your father would not scold you unless you had done wrong,' the girl answered. * You don't understand,' Tempeston replied,-' indeed you don't. He thinks everything wrong. It's not only me, but with my sisters it is just the same. Do you know that sometimes we have been punished for laughing ? He says it's frivolous !

It Avas six o'clock when they passed under the arch and entered Rotten Row.

Perhaps he is very nice, and you will end by liking him ever so much.' The boy groaned at the idea, as the remembrance of Mr. Marshall and his black beady eyes rose before him. The girl laughed.

' My boy was just as keen as you about it all,' Lord Meltonbury said, ' and when the shooting Avas on, those three hours and a half's work were a real trial to him. Nine o'clock till half-past twelve was the period allotted to study ; and at first he thought he could never learn to bear it. When he had persevered for about two years, his reward came. The beauty of work revealed itself to him, and latterly I have known him, on a history day, keep me waiting to start a quarter of an hour and twenty minutes, if he was particularly engrossed.' Tempeston wondered if he should ever learn to regard his tasks in the same manner, but he had not much time for reflection, for they were already walking doAvn Great Stanhope Street, and in another minute the hall bell of Number \u2014 had been rung. The pair in the porch had not long to wait. In a minute steps were heard, and in another second the door Avas flung open"], [142, "Olga 138 ' Oh, my lord,' exclaimed the butler, on beholding Tempeston, 'wherever have you been? Here's his lordship half out of his mind, and ' \u2014 The man stopped suddenly on beholding the tall, commanding figure of Lord Meltonbury. ' The young gentleman has been in my company,' said the last-named. ' Have the kindness to inform Lord Grantown I am here with his son.' The butler took the card handed to him, and dis appeared into the library. ' Tempest,' came a loud whisper over the stairs, \u2014 ' Tempest, is that you ? Oh, there's such a toav ! ' ' Hush, Helen ! ' exclaimed her brother ; ' don't you see there's some one here ? ' The sudden disappearance of a head which had leaned over the bannisters and the rustle of a skirt Avas the reply. 'Will your lordship step this Avay?' said the butler, reappearing, and addressing the visitor. ' You'd better come too,' said the latter to Tempeston. The master of the house was standing in the centre of the room Avhen my hero and his companion entered,"], [143, "A Friend in Need. 139 and his stern face looked even sterner than usual. He bowed to Lord Meltonbury, and then turned towards his son, saying, \u2014 ' What do you mean, sir, by such conduct as this ? What do you mean by such flagrant disobedience to my orders ? ' The boy grew red, but did not answer. ' Go to your room, sir, and remain there. I will speak to you to-morrow morning. How, my lord, can I serve you ? ' And the speaker turned to Lord Meltonbury. ' May I ask as a favour to myself that your son be allowed to remain ? I think I shall be able to show you that I am almost more to blame than he is in this matter.' ' Stop, sir, then,' said Lord Grantown to Tempeston, and again turned to his visitor, motioning him to a chair. Lord Meltonbury seated himself, wishing to humour his strange host, and then he began his explanation. In a simple pleasant way he told of the arrangement made at luncheon as to the ride ; of his own inability"], [144, "140 Olga. to take his daughter out, and the promise Tempeston had given not to keep Olga waiting. ' Yes, yes,' broke in the angry father ; ' but he should have told me. Besides, this does not touch the question of his disobedience to my order, directing him not to quit this room.' 'I was endeavouring to show that he did it in order not to keep my little girl waiting,' returned Lord Meltonbury. 'Then, why did he not inform me of this engage ment?' 'Possibly he thought you might still forbid him to keep it,' was the answer, in a low voice. ' But all this time we are talking, your son is here without finding an opportunity for doing that which I asked leave for him to remain and do. Come, Tempest, I am sure you remember what is due to your father, and will tell him how sorry you are.' 'Yes,' said the boy hurriedly, and getting very red \u2022 ' I am sorry, father, I did not explain about the' engagement I-I beg your pardon.' ' Hem,' returned Lord Grantown. ' It is easy enough"], [145, "A Friend in Need. 141 to beg pardon after committing an offence, sir, and I expect your apology is dictated more in hopes of escaping punishment than from true contrition.' The boy drew himself up proudly as he answered, \u2014 ' I'm not afraid of you or any one. I said I was sorry I did not tell you of the engagement, and I am. I don't tell lies and say what I don't mean.' 'Silence, sir. I will not have you use such a tone to me.' Lord Meltonbury made a sign secretly to the boy, and then said, \u2014 ' I am sure Tempest is grieved that he did not confide to you the arrangement we had made. I hope, Lord Grantown, you will accept your boy's apology, espe cially as I feel I am to blame in the matter. Of course I ought to have written and asked your sanction.' Now, though Lord Grantown was far from knowing it, he was more influenced at times by worldly con siderations than was quite compatible Avith his pro fessions. He knew that Lord Meltonbury was a very great personage, and that he might possibly live to be Premier. True, they differed in politics, if Lord"], [146, "Olga. 142 GrantoAvn can be said to have had any politics, but still it is always worth while for a man to be on good terms Avith a possible first minister of the Crown. Who kneAv Avhat he might not Avant some day ? If he and Lord Meltonbury were friends, possibly at a future time he might succeed in gaining for the men of his own views the vacant Church appointments. If he could succeed in these things his life would not have been spent in vain. ' I cannot refuse what you ask,' Lord Grantown replied at length to his visitor. ' For your sake no more shall be said about the matter. Tempest, you may consider yourself indebted to Lord Meltonbury for this.' It Avas with a feeling of surprise, not untinged Avith jealousy, that Lord Grantown observed his guest draw the boy towards him, resting his hand on the young shoulder, Avhile the lad leant familiarly against him, whispering his thanks. Why did Tempest never Avhisper in his ear, the father thought, as he was doing in this man's, whom he had kno.vn but a few days? Why did the lad never lean against him, looking up"], [147, "A Friend in Need. 1 43 Avith an expression like that which he now wore ? As a rule, Avhen he met the boy's glance, there was a look in the dark blue eyes very far from one of love. The stern father had never known till that moment that the look in his son's face pained him deeply. ' What shall you say,' said Lord Meltonbury, with a smile, glancing up at his host from his whispered con ference with Tempeston, \u2014 ' what shall you say if I have yet another favour to ask ? ' ' That I trust I shall be able to grant it,' was the conciliatory reply. ' Well, will you let my young friend ride three times a week at half-past five with my little girl ? Lessons will be over by then, and it will be a real kindness to me, as the horses do not get half enough exercise.' ' Certainly, certainly. I will see that he punctually fulfils the engagement' ' Thanks ; and now I must wish you good night,' said Lord Meltonbury, rising. ' I trust,' observed his host, ' that our acquaintance does not cease here. I hope I may be allowed to call?'"], [148, "Olga. 144 ' My wife and I will be charmed,' Avas the ansAver. ' Good-night and good-bye to you, dear boy. The day after to-morrow, you know, at half-past five. He may stay to tea, I suppose, on these occasions ? He shall be home before ten.' Again Lord Grantown said ' Certainly.' The bell was rung, and in another moment Lord Meltonbury was gone, and Tempeston was left alone with his father. There was a silence in the room while the boy lingered to see if his parent had anything more to say, and the latter sat Avishing for a look from his son such as he had seen so lately given by him to a stranger. ' Do you want me any more, papa ? ' asked the clear young voice at last. Should he call the boy to him? Lord Grantown thought; should he draw him to himself, as he had seen Lord Meltonbury do? and if he did, what sort of a glance Avould the blue eyes shoot up at him ? 'Do you want me any more, papa?' the question came again. Lord Grantown rose and began to walk up and down"], [149, "A Friend in Need. 145 the room, a favourite custom of his. He paused when he reached the spot where his son stood. ' No,' he said, ' there is nothing more.' Tempeston moved eagerly to the door. He did not say good-night or turn his head once, and in another moment Lord Grantown was alone. ' I wish I had said good-night,' the latter thought. ' Perhaps I have been too cold with him and with them all. They do not love me, I can see that I wonder if I could gain my boy's affection, so that he would look up at me like he did at Meltonbury! Perhaps it's too late to try.' Lord Grantown resumed his walk up and down the room, and the clock on the chimney -piece had long chimed two before he lighted his candle and ascended the stairs to bed. 10"], [150, "CHAPTER VII. A MISUNDERSTANDING. THE Aveeks that followed the events recorded in my last chapter would have been weari- some to Tempeston, had it not been for his rides Avith Olga. These Avere his sole support through the long hours of study with Mr. Marshall, and the scarcely less hard ones of preparation for the next day's work in his father's library. I do not think that the rest of the household were much better off than poor Tempeston.

Nine till a quarter to two in the morning, and three till five in the afternoon, and sometimes another hour in the evening, to get things anything like done.' ' Shall I speak to your father ? ' asked Miss Emmett anxiously. ' I am sure,' she went on, turning to Lina, ' it's too much for him or any other boy in London in this weather. He has just no amusements, except those rides of an hour each three times a week.' ' It's too bad,' Lina ansAvered. ' Mr. Marshall gives him, when his morning's work is finished, more than anybody could possibly prepare for the next day. He's looking as ill as he can now from it all.' \u2022 Are you ill, Tempest ?

Just run doAvn, Lina, like a good girl, to the library, and put away his books for him.' ' But I have not done a quarter,' groaned Tempeston ; ' and papa said I was to finish my algebra and verses before I went out. He'll kick up such a row if I don't try.' 'You'll do nothing of the kind,' Miss Emmett answered firmly. ' Run down, Lina, as I told you ; and, Tempest, you come and lie on the sofa in my room. I will take the responsibility of your not doin^ the work.' With womanly tenderness the governess led the boy along the passage to her own apartment. There she placed him on the couch, darkened the room, and, having given him a dose of sal- volatile, bade him try and go to sleep, while she finished hearing Lina's lessons. It was nearly seven when Miss Emmett again paid a visit to her chamber. She was stealing softly out, having found the tired boy still asleep, Avhen she met a servant bearing a message to the effect that Lord Tempeston .vas to go down at once to his father."], [153, "A Misunderstanding. 149 ' I will see about it,' replied the governess, and doAvn stairs she ran. Miss Emmett had the reputation of being the only person in the house who was not afraid of its master. ' You sent for Tempest,' she said, entering the library. ' Yes. Why does he not come, and why has he not left the work he has prepared for to-morrow out for me to see ? ' ' He has not finished it. The truth is, that I gave him my directions not to do so. The boy is on my sofa, where he has been asleep for more than two hours, quite worn out.' ' Worn out ! What do you mean ? ' ' He came up-stairs to me in a burning fever and with a racking headache. I'm convinced if he had continued his work he would have been seriously ill. Something, Lord Grantown, must be done. The boy is overworked \u2014 completely overworked.

I have no doubt the boy is tired by the work, but that is simply because he has never before made any attempt to study properly. Certainly I shall not dream of speaking to Mr. Marshall, or of cancelling his orders. PshaAv ! it amuses me to hear of young people in these days with their aches and pains ! When I was a boy and did my work I never had a headache.' ' Perhaps not,' Miss Emmett answered ; ' but that proves nothing. We are not all constituted alike, and any one can see at a glance that Tempest is not robust. If the hours of study are not shortened to-morrow they Avill have to be in a fe.v weeks.' ' Shortened ! I won't hear of it,' retorted Lord GrantoAvn. 'Very Avell,' said Miss Emmett quietly; 'then the boy Avill have a nervous fever. I haven't been teaching all my life not to know when a child's Avork is beyond him. At all events, Avhen the doctor does come, you Avill not be able to say that the lad's ill-health has come upon you Avith surprise.'"], [155, "A Misunderstanding. 151 ' PshaAV ! ' was Lord Grantown's answer. Miss Emmett had not long to Avait for a proof of the truth of her words. The very next day Mr. Marshall reported to Lord Grantown that his pupil Avas extremely idle and inattentive, and had done prac tically nothing. During afternoon preparation things went from bad to Avorse, until a violent quarrel between father and son brought all attempts at study to an end. Tempeston completely lost control over himself, flung the books across the room, accidentally upsetting the ink as he did so over the Turkey carpet, and finally strode out of the room and out of the house. The boy rode with Olga in the park, and poured all his troubles into her sympathizing ear, receiving in return comfort and good advice. After tea on Carlton House Terrace, Lady Meltonbury, seeing the boy was far from well, contrived to get him to tell her about his difficulties. She promised to consult her husband on the matter when he should return that evening from a City banquet to which he had gone. It Avas the first public entertainment Lord Meltonbury had been"], [156, "152 Olga. present at, and the first time he had worn the Garter since his son's death. It had been a terrible duty to him, and as he had fastened the order on he had remembered that last occasion, how Holme, being in the dressing-room, had taken up the broad blue ribbon and had held it across his own chest to see, he said, how he would look one day when he was grown up and should have won that coveted honour ! That had been the night of a Mansion House dinner in August, and only six weeks before\u2014 only six weeks ! But there was no need for Tempeston's friends to interfere on his behalf. On the night in question, after leaving the terrace, finding the weather fine, he thought that a Avalk home would do him good, so he started off on foot. The boy went the usual way, by Pall Mall and St. James's Street, but by the time he had reached the top of the hill he found that he Avas very tired. It seemed absurd, however, to take a cab when he had accom plished half the distance, so he decided to finish his journey walking. Though he went by the short cut, which is through the passage lying at the back of"], [157, "A Misunderstanding. 153 Devonshire House gardens, and up Curzon Street, he was obliged to walk so slowly that he did not reach home till nearly half an hour after his usual time. When he had rung the hall bell he was compelled to lean for support against a pillar in the portico. Tempeston entered the house, and was just handing his hat to a servant preparatory to making his way up-stairs to bed, when his father's voice called him from the library. The door of the apartment was open. The boy complied with the summons, and tottered rather than walked into the room, sinking down into the chair at his work table. Lord Grantown regarded his son with dismay. ' What is the matter with you ? ' he asked ; ' why are you in such a disgraceful state ? Just look at the sleeve of your coat.' Tempeston glanced down and saw that it was covered with Avhite chalk. ' I leaned against the pillar in the portico,' he answered faintly. ' They seemed so long coming to the door, and I Avas very tired.' ' Tired ! ' echoed Lord Grantown. ' Did that make"], [158, "Olga. 154 you Avalk as you did just noAv ? Begin your Avork Avhich you have left undone.' The boy pulled his books towards him. He Avas feeling too weak and ill to dispute or refuse. ' It's no use,' he said, after a minute or two. ' I can't see to read. The words all dance up and doAvn so.' Lord GrantoAvn rose, his face settling into its sternest expression. ' So ! ' he exclaimed ; ' my suspicions are confirmed. This is the last time you ever visit at Lord Melton bury's house.' ' Never visit again ! ' the boy repeated stupidly. ' I \u2014 I will. Why am I never to visit there ? ' ' You shall go to no house from Avhich you are allowed to return in such a state. Not content, sir, Avith being idle, you must now be vicious. Covered with dust, unable to stand or read ! You are tipsy, sir, tipsy ! ' The Avords roused all the lad's fiercest Avrath, conscious as he was of the unjustifiable nature of the charge. He sprang to his feet and faced his father."], [159, "A Misunderstanding. 155 ' You \u2014 you lie ! ' he panted forth. Lord Grantown raised his hand for ans.ver and struck his son a ringing blow on the ear. Another time I fear Tempeston would have closed Avith his father, but then, ill and worn out, he staggered to the sofa and fell into a flood of tears, such as a nervous excitable boy will sometimes indulge in Avhen very unwell. The master of the house stood regarding his son for some time with a look almost of satisfaction, but Avhen, as minute after minute went by, the sobs became louder and louder, he grew frightened. ' Be quiet, sir ! ' he said, \u2014 ' be quiet ! ' His words produced no effect, only the sobbing became more frequent and hysterical. Lord Grantown got seriously alarmed. The library door was open and he heard voices speaking in whispers. 'Is Miss Emmett there?' he called. 'Send Miss Emmett at once.' The governess was in the room in a minute. In truth, she had been debating with Helen and Lina on the stairs whether she should attempt to interfere in"], [160, "156 Olga. the quarrel which, from the noise, it Avas evident to all had commenced. ' Tempeston,' exclaimed Lord Grantown nervously, ' Tempeston is unwell. I was obliged to administer a box on the ear, and this is the result. Stop him, I beg ; the servants will hear.' Miss Emmett hardly waited for Lord GrantoAvn to finish his speech before she was at the side of the sofa. ' Tempest,' she said firmly,-' Tempest) you must stQp at once, my dear. I can't allow this.' The boy put out his arms to her, and panted between his sobs, \u2014 ' He said-he said that I was tipsy. It's not true not true.' Another flood of tears cut short the explanation, but Miss Emmett fully comprehended. ' Tipsy ! ' she exclaimed, in clear, derisive tones ; \u25a0 you are dreaming, Tempest ! you are only unwell. Do you think I don't know tipsy people when I see them ? \u25a0 'He said it-he said it,' poking at Lord Gran. town."], [161, "A Misunderstanding. 157 ' I \u2014 I ' \u2014 began that gentleman, but Miss Emmett cut him short. 'Send the servant round the corner for Dr. Willis. Tell him to come at once. I told you this Avas coming on, only you would not believe me.' The master of the house, who began to see he had made a mistake, obeyed quickly. Some ten minutes elapsed before the medical man arrived, and by that time, under the governess's firm but kind treatment, the boy's tears had ceased, and the only remains of the attack Avas an occasional convulsive sob. ' Overworked, I think,' whispered Miss Emmett to the physician. ' Scene with his father just now \u2014 he accused the boy of being tipsy.' ' Pshaw ! ' said the doctor, looking down at his patient kindly. The man of science took a seat on the sofa, and asked the lad a few questions. ' Could you bring me a little wine ? ' said Dr. Willis, looking up at Miss Emmett ; ' you might bring it to us in ten minutes. Don't let any one else come but yourself.'"], [162, "Olga. 158 The governess complied, and left the room. ' Had a little difference with your father, eh ? ' asked the doctor when the door closed. ' Y\u2014 yes.' ' What about ? ' ' I Avas tired.

' Pshaw ! ' said the doctor again. ' I know Lord Meltonbury too,' he Avent on. ' Ah, if Ave had a feAV more such men as he in the Ministry Ave should do a little better.' Tempeston's face brightened. ' Is he not good and kind ? They are my greatest friends. I ride his horses for him three times a Aveek for an hour in the park.' ' And a very good thing for you, and better still if you could do it oftener and for longer. Come, tell me, my young friend, have you been feeling unwell long?' ' No, only the last feAV days.'"], [163, "A Misunderstanding. 159 ' Too much Avork, eh ?

Avhile he made a careful study of the physiognomy of his youthful patient. ' Get out of temper sometimes, don't you ? ' the man of science asked, when at length he had completed the survey. The eyelids with the long dark lashes fell quickly. The doctor was answered. ' More often after working hard ? ' ' Y\u2014 yes.' ' Ah ! Well, you must try and control yourself. You are getting a big boy now, and must make up your mind that you won't let trifles put you out, eh ? ' Y\u2014 yes.'"], [164, "160 Olga. ' That's right. As regards the Avork, I will speak to your father. We must have a good long holiday first, I think ; get right away into the country, and forget all about C\u00e6sar and Horace for a time.' Just then Miss Emmett returned with the wine, which the doctor administered to his patient; and then, intimating that he should like to speak to the governess alone, he dismissed Tempeston to bed. 'I will see you before you go to sleep, dear,' said Miss Emmett, and in another minute the boy was gone. Dr. Willis seated himself at a table, and wrote a couple of prescriptions, frowning occasionally as he did so. 'Some men would be better without children,' he observed abruptly when he had finished writing, \u2014 ' much better.' Miss Emmett sighed. She knew to whom the doctor referred.

' ' Oh, I think he will do all right,' was the reply ; ' that is, with care, you know. I shall see him about noon to-morrow, and he had better lie quiet till then.

I daresay the medicine will make him sleep the clock round.'"], [167, "A Misunderstanding. 163 ' Dear, dear ! ' said Lord Grantown ; ' it's a great pity. There is his tutor coming at nine.' ' Ah,' exclaimed Dr. Willis, ' there must be no more tutoring for a long while to come ! ' ' What do you mean ? ' in a horrified tone. 'Just what I said,' the physician returned quietly. 'Tutors and books must be banished absolutely for a period.

'And I'll tell you something else. I haven't been in practice for five-and-thirty years without being able to judge of what my patients can bear and what they can't. Your son may live to be as strong as you are, but at present he's a very delicate, growing lad, and if he had had brain fever I don't think he would have pulled through.' Lord Grantown gazed at the speaker for a moment"], [168, "164 Olga. in horror. A sense of the calamity with Avhich he had been threatened was upon him \u2014 that calamity which might still occur. The doctor saw the effects of his words, and saw, too, that the rest he required for his young patient would be accorded. ' Good-night,' he said briefly. ' Good-night,' the other answered hoarsely. ' Come early to-morrow.' ' I will.' Then the hall door closed, and Lord Grantown was alone. He went back into the library. The room was empty ; Miss Emmett had gone up-stairs ; and he sat down to think. ' Brain fever\u2014 a delicate, growing lad\u2014 I don't think he would have pulled through.' The doctor's Avords came back to his mind. Sup pose it had come\u2014 this fever ! Suppose it had ended as the doctor said it might end ! What should he, the unhappy father, have done?

Hard and cold he had been to his son, but he had been so only because he believed that a father should be feared by his children, and because he believed that such fear would beget a proper and wholesome respect and love. Lord Grantown had failed to gain either from his son ; or, indeed, from any of his children. In the silence of his own room he acknowledged it to himself. He had been mistaken, but he would seek to rectify in the future that mistake. Was there time though ? Suppose even yet the fever came, and the boy died ! The thought was too much for him.

The eyes were closed, and the long lashes rested on the flushed cheeks. He did not hear the step of the new comer. Lord GrantoAvn stood for a moment without moving.

Looking doAvn, he seemed to hear again the doctor's words, ' I doubt if he Avould pull through.' ' Is \u2014 is he asleep ? ' Lord Grantown asked nervously, of the governess. ' No,' the other Avhispered ; ' only very tired. The medicine will send him off soon.' The father bent down to look at his son, and Tempeston opened his eyes. There was a look of astonishment in them when he saw Avho it Avas, which changed quickly to one of dislike and anger, as he recalled the charge Avhich had been made against him that evening. ' Are you better ? ' Lord Grantown asked. ' No,' said the boy roughly. The father stooped and swept the curly hair back"], [172, "1 68 Olga. from the hot young forehead. He did it, too, with no ungentle hand. ' Don't ! ' exclaimed the lad peevishly ; ' I wish you wouldn't You make me so hot' Tempeston, as he spoke, jerked himself away. Miss Emmett looked on nervously. A pang went through poor Lord Grantown's heart, as he noticed the gesture. He understood its signi fication. 'Would-would you like me to sit up with you, Tempest?' he asked, almost timidly. 'No.' 'But I could give you your medicine when you wake, and things to drink if you are thirsty, you know.' Lord Grantown's tone was almost imploring. ' No,' retorted the boy ; ' I have got Emmett. I wish you would go away\u2014 I hate you ! ' The little mouth set itself into its most determined expression, and the father turned toAvards the door. At the words of the young speaker, the governess saw a sort of convulsive twitch of the man's mouth, and she pitied him at once with all her kind heart"], [173, "A Misunderstanding. 169 ' Hush, Tempest dear ! ' she said. ' It's very kind of your father, and you should not answer so.' And as Lord Grantown paused at the door, he heard the reply given : ' But it's true ; I do \u2014 I do hate him.' The father stole softly from the room, and crept doAvn to his own apartment There he fell on his knees and called upon his Maker to give him, at any cost, Avhat he craved, the life of his boy \u2014 and his love. And He who sitteth on high heard the Avild petition, and gave him first the one and then the other ; but not the last until his son had cried aloud, ' I Avould that I were dead ere this ! I would that I had died \u2014 oh, long ago ! ' Lord Grantown, when he asked that night for the life of his boy, forgot to say, ' Thy will be done.'"], [174, "CHAPTER VIII. CRUEL WORDS. IT Avas August, and Lord Grantown Avith his family Avas back home amongst the green woods, enjoying the fresh country air. Parliament was still sitting, but Lord GrantoAvn, contrary to his usual custom, had not waited for the prorogation. Dr. Willis had been so urgent for the removal of his youthful patient from tOAvn, that all ecclesiastical questions were forgotten by the anxious father. Tempeston had been ill, seriously ill, and it was only Avith difficulty that the doctor had warded off a nervous fever. Lord Grantown and Mr. Marshall realized for the 17u"], [175, "Cruel Words. 171 first time how hard the boy must actually have been Avorking, though neither of them understood the cause of his energetic attempts to improve in his studies. The true reason why Tempeston had suddenly con centrated his mind on his work Avas owing to the interest Lord Meltonbury had shoAvn that he should make up for lost time. The wise counsels, too, that the golden-haired Lady Olga gave the boy under the trees of Rotten Row had perhaps stimulated him still more than anything else. He wanted to be like Holme, she would say ; Avell, then, he must Avork, because that Avas Avhat Holme did to please papa and mamma. So Tempeston had striven to fulfil the tasks Avhich Mr. Marshall set, and did his best ; until all at once the young brain, unaccustomed to real wofk, broke down. It all came so suddenly that perhaps it is not fair to blame the father or tutor, though the former considered it all his own fault. ' If I had listened when you spoke,' Lord Grantown used to say to Miss Emmett, ' he might not have been ill.'"], [176, "172 Olga. The governess tried to comfort her employer by explaining how she herself had only known the boy was ailing a short time before he was actually taken ill. It was no use, either, going back to what was past, she urged ; Avhat they had to do then was to endeavour to get the lad well as soon as possible. After a few days' rest in bed, under Dr. Willis's wise care, the danger of fever passed off, and Tempeston was allowed to leave his couch. The boy was alarm ingly weak, and he Avas only permitted to lie on the sofa in the drawing-room and be read to or amused by his sisters and Miss Emmett. Poor Tempeston ! He found the time hang heavily on his hands, and groaned continually over the loss of his rides with his little friend. At length Dr. Willis said he might receive visitors, and then all was changed. Lady Meltonbury and Olga used to come and sit during the hot hours of the July afternoons beside the boy's sofa, bringing with them flowers and the choicest fruits. Often the lady would go avvay to pay visits, leaving her young daughter to amuse the invalid, and then Tempeston thoroughly enjoyed himself."], [177, "Cruel Words. 173 They were such nice confidential chats that the pair used to have together ! The boy delighted to listen to the clear young voice reading aloud, or to watch the child where she sat in her white dress, trimmed with costly and elegant lace, gently scolding him when he confessed he had been cross with his sisters or Emmett. The little lectures did Tempeston much good, and his attendants, though ignorant of the cause, profited greatly by them. There were no cross words or frowns for a day or two after the little graceful figure in white, with the short curly golden locks and grey eyes, had said, ' Promise to try,' and Tempeston had given answer, ' I promise.' But, though Olga's influence for good over the boy gained daily, she did not succeed in getting him to be on friendly terms with his father. The girl did not press the point too much, lest she should, in so doing, lose that salutary power of which I have spoken ; but wisely determined to leave it to time, and until she should have gained still greater influence over him. There was also another and constant visitor in Great"], [178, "Olga. 1 74 Stanhope Street Avhom the young viscount delighted to see, and this was Lord Meltonbury.

Sometimes Lord Meltonbury came before luncheon sometimes before going to the House, and very often in the dusk, after the adjournment, to fetch Olga home. At first, when Tempeston was moved down to the drawing-room sofa, Lord Grantown Avould make excuses for being in the same apartment. It Avas cooler there than in his library, or else the light was better for reading, he used to say. But Miss Emmett, watching him closely, knew that he came there neither for coolness nor for the purpose of reading, but simply to be near his boy, though the latter never spoke to him. Lord GrantoAvn, opening the door and coming in"], [179, "Cruel Words. 175 with his excuses, used to see a frown come on the handsome young face lying back among the sofa cushions. That look pained the father more than he could have expressed, but still he persevered with his visits. He was always hoping to be left alone with his son. Then he meant to take the boy in his arms and feel that he was safe, and tell him that his old father loved him \u2014 loved him, oh, so dearly ! But then came the day when Dr. Willis said visitors would be good for Tempeston and cheer him up : so the Meltonburys' visits began. Lord Grantown Avas very civil to his guests, but he saw his presence was not over welcome, so he used to go aAvay till they were gone, and then return to read or write ; but he gave that up after a little bit The father, when he opened the drawing-room door, used to see the young head turn eagerly to know who it was, and then turn away with a sigh and a muttered ' I thought it was Lord Meltonbury.'

He could not bear to Avatch the affectionate looks his son cast up at Lord Meltonbury, while the latter sat with his hand on the invalid's shoulder, tell ing him stories.

Lord Grantown was not more successful in his attempts to win the affection and confidence of his other children. They could not easily accustom them selves to his altered manner. Their old fear .vas on them ; and, going into the dining-room to carve their luncheon, or coming to pay a visit to the schoolroom, he would hear the laughter die away, and note that the mirthful faces changed to grave ones as soon as he appeared on the scene. So through the hot July days the solitary man sat in his lonely library and ate his heart out in longing for that which for so lengthened a period he had put from him. He watched Lord Meltonbury with his daughter Olga, contrasting the love and confidence between them and his own relationship with Helen and Lina.

' None of them love me,' he told himself as he sat in solitude ; ' none of them love me. I am all alone.'

'Oh, I wish it Avas the nth now!' exclaimed Tem peston. Then the carriage moved off on its way to Waterloo Station.

Shirley ! the trees of Avhich he could see far aAvay on the hill to the right, and which had never been visited, as far as he could remember, by its owners before. As Tempeston was not allowed to rise till midday, and hated eating his breakfast in bed, it was, of course, impossible that he could dine at two o'clock. The local medical man accordingly settled the difficulty by directing that his patient should have his chief meal Avith Lord Grantown in the evening. It Avas not a gay party that met round the dinner table at eight o'clock. Tempeston was generally tired with the efforts of the day and the fatigue of dressing, Avhile Hele.i spent her time in vainly trying to talk"], [183, "Cruel Words. 179 to her father and seeing that her young brother ate as much as he ought. At the head of the table the master of the house sat, watching his children, speaking almost timidly to them, and longing for a look or word of affection from his son. One evening, at the end of the first week in August, the stable clock was striking six, and Tempeston was alone, lying on his couch under the trees. Miss Emmett, with Lina, had gone to schoolroom tea, Avhile Helen Avas out riding. Suddenly the boy heard a step on the gravel path near, and, looking up, beheld his father. ' Have they all deserted you ? ' the latter asked, with a smile. ' They are at tea,' the boy answered coldly, and turned his head away. ' Shall I \u2014 I will stay with you till they return,' was the reply ; and Lord GrantoAvn drew near, and stood beside the sofa. ' I like better to be alone,' was the ungracious answer. ' Can I not amuse you in any way ? ' Tempeston lifted his eyebrows in surprise."], [184, "1 80 Olga ' I like better to be alone,' he said again. Lord Grantown sighed, but still he could not make up his mind to go. Should he tell the boy ho.v he loved him, and Avanted to be his friend ? They Avere alone, and not likely to be broken in upon. It was improbable he Avould have a better opportunity. He Avould try, at all events, to bring things into a happier state between them. ' But I do not like to leave you,' he said. ' Tempest, Avhy is it that Ave do not see \u2014 do not see more of each other ? ' The boy did not ansAver \u2014 only looked at him.

' he asked, very, very sadly. ' Because I do,' the boy returned, his temper rising as he recalled the misunderstandings of the past. 'Because you said that I was tipsy, and told Mr. Marshall, and others, things that had happened long ago, and ' \u2014 'And,' Lord GrantoAvn asked, his face white and drawn, ' what else ?

For one brief second Lord Grantown stood rooted to the spot, then he turned without a word towards the house, and Tempeston Avas alone. Lying under the green trees, quiet and silent, the boy's anger began to die away. He felt, though he Avould not own it, even to himself, a little sorry he had spoken quite so plainly. It was true Tempeston had no very great affection for his father. The latter had always seemed so stern and severe that the lad had never suspected the deep love Lord Grantown felt towards him. He had appeared harsh, not because he was so naturally, as I have frequently said, but simply because he believed it to be the proper course to pursue in order to win the respect and confidence of his children. The man's eyes had been opened, during the last few Aveeks, to the knowledge that he had been mistaken. The moment he had realized this truth he set himself to repair his error, and Tempeston's ansAver that August evening was his reward."], [187, "Cruel Words. 183 The boy felt a little sorry, as I have already men tioned. He was naturally Avarm- hearted and affec tionate, and after a fit of anger was always deeply grieved for whatever he had said. The only person to whom he had hitherto addressed bitter speeches and felt no regret was his father. Tempeston had never forgiven the not being allowed to go to his mother on that memorable last day of her life. Long brooding over it, he had grown to hate the hand that had kept them apart, and never for a moment paused to consider that Lord Grantown had done only what he believed was best for his Avise. Unhappily the act had sown a seed of hatred in the boy's heart toAvards his father, and the latter's subsequent fault-finding, threatenings, and lectures, caused in reality only by over-anxiety for the lad's Avelfare, had all been mis understood, and had even tended to foster the groAvth of the ill weed to a dangerous extent. But, on the particular evening of Avhich I am speaking, there was a slight change in Tempeston's feelings to the ones he usually experienced after a round of biting words Avith his parent. The boy could"], [188, "1 84 Olga not quite forget the spasm of agony that had crossed his father's face Avhen the words ' I hate you ' had been spoken. The Avhite, drawn look, too, Avas still before Tempeston's eyes. Deep down in the lad's heart Avas a voice Avhich kept asking him \u2014 endeavour as much as he Avould not to hear it \u2014 what Olga Avould have said if she had heard those Avords. He could never tell her of them. Often he had confided it to the child Avhen he had been angry Avith his sisters or Emmett \u2014 dear, kind Emmett, Avhom his Avarm heart loved so Avell, and sometimes in his hours of penitence had even confessed to her some of the things he had said. But he felt he could never dare to meet those grave eyes again, if once he had Avhispered in her ear that he had looked upon his father's face and said, ' I hate you.' The governess and Lina came back about half-past six, and broke in upon Tempeston's meditations. He was distracted, and they Avere unable to get him to laugh and talk as he usually did. Miss Emmett noticed that his glance Avandered uneasily round, as though in search of some one ; she saw something had happened, but could not make out exactly what."], [189, "Cruel Words. 185 ' Have you seen your father this afternoon ?

' Didn't he say anything ? ' ' No ; only turned and went into the house.' Nothing more was said then, but, whilst Helen was dressing for the evening, Miss Emmett paid a visit to the girl's room and counselled her to be prudent at dinner. ' Keep them from talking by talking yourself, my dear,' said the governess. ' I will if I can,' Helen replied, and went down stairs. In the great hall she found her brother ready dressed, and speaking to the butler."], [190, "1 86 Olga. ' Look here !

Tempeston sat silent and gloomy, and, as Helen could not get any more out of him, she proposed their going up-stairs to the schoolroom. ' Very well,' answered her brother ; ' but mind, you have promised not to say anything to the others.' Helen sighed as she nodded her head, and the pair, arm-in-arm, passed through the gloomy hall, passed the library door, and ascended to their own part of the house. The library door ! Within the room the grey-haired father was sitting, silent, alone, and Avretched. He had eaten nothing, and wished for nothing. The footman brought in coffee, and he drank a cup mechanically, and then Avas alone again. ' I hate you.'

He had striven to rear them so that they might fear, first God, and then himself, as their guardian appointed by that great Being whom he endeavoured to serve. ' I hate you.' Over and over again in the bitterness of his own heart Lord Grantown repeated the words. Hated by his son \u2014 that son whom he loved so well ! Poor man he did not quite understand children, and had no idea that in the heat of temper they may use words of which they do not grasp the full meaning. Tempeston, when he thought of this or that event, above all of his separation from his mother during the closing hours of her life, did feel hatred in his heart towards his father ; but still it was not a hatred so great as Lord GrantoAvn believed. At the very moment, too, when the solitary"], [194, "Olga, 190 man Avas brooding over the obnoxious phrase, some thing very like regret was in the heart of the boy who had spoken it The clock upon the mantelpiece told the hours, ten eleven, tAvelvc, and still the nobleman sat in his arm chair, gazing vacantly at nothing. He rang the bell, and sent the servants to bed, and then he resumed his train of thought Hated by his son ! Very likely that was the sentiment entertained by all his other children for him. True, they had not said it, but that was only because Tempeston Avas more open. He told himself, and Avith truth, that his boy scorned a lie. Hoav he loved the lad, \u2014 loved even his very faults ! He Avould have striven, if he had been allowed, to aid in overcoming them ; but, alas ! he Avas not so allowed.

The boy Avas getting stronger every day in spite of the heat, but still the doctor said, ' No books.' Lord Grantown, sitting near the open window of his library, used to hear the gay voices and merry laughter and the patter of feet in the great hall, but that was all. He never went out to them.

Miss Emmett did that, and his children got on better without him, he told himself. After his biscuit and glass of sherry at two o'clock, he took his hat and wandered away alone into the woods, where it was not too hot to walk. It was better than sitting still, but it was very solitary. Now and then he would meet one of his woodmen, and then he used to sit down and chat. Formerly he would have returned the touch of the hat and passed on, thinking nothing of the man to whom he paid Avages, but of this or that theory, which, if once adopted, would, he believed, put down infidelity for ever. Things were changed with Lord Grantown all at once, he could scarcely have told why. The truth was that he had learned that respect is not enough, that he craved love and sympathy. A woodman was better than nothing, so he used to sit and talk about the toiler's life, his wife and family.

Sometimes Tem peston thought of making a remark, to see what Avould happen, but as day succeeded day, and still his father did not speak, he got shy.

Still, as the time Avent on, Tempeston grew more and more to wish for a reconciliation. With his Avarm, loving heart, he did not relish seeing the weary look upon his father's face, nor meeting the dark, grave eyes, which looked so full of sadness and reproach at him. Once or twice, when he was not feeling very strong, he made an excuse to leave the dinner-table early, and afterwards questioned Helen closely as to the conversation which had taken place after his departure. The girl's answer was the same on both occasions. ' He never spoke about you,' she said, \u2014 ' never once.' ' Are you sure ? ' ' Certain.' Tempeston was more piqued than ever.

It Avas a burning hot afternoon Avhen he set off, about five o'clock, for Shirley Park, on horseback. The gates of Lord Meltonbury's place Avere not quite two miles from the lodge at Grantown, so he did not take very long trotting over. Fortunately the road was shady most of the Avay, so that Tempeston was not very much done up Avhen he reached his destination.

He could have told it was Lady Meltonbury's room by the Avealth of flowers which were everywhere to be seen, and by the air of refinement which hung over all. The boy stood still, gazing round, Avhen the servant"], [203, "Good A dvice, 199 had left him to inform the lady of the house of his arrival. After a minute he walked across to a large glass, surveying himself to see that he was neat and tidy. The lad was just engaged in arranging his necktie, when a merry laugh behind made him start. Looking up, he saw that Olga was lying half-hidden in an easy chair, before a small tea-table, at the other end of the room. ' Goodness ! ' exclaimed Tempeston ; 'how long have you been here?' ' Before you were shown in ; and if you had not been so intent upon your own personal appearance, I daresay you would have found me out sooner. Come and have some tea.' Tempeston received his cup from the youthful tea maker, and stood in front of her admiringly. The girl Avas dressed as usual, in white, and looked cool, while every one else the boy had seen that day appeared hot and uncomfortable.

I will try and do the same for you, in a minute, if you are good.' ' Thanks ; but, I say, Olga, I don't think the princesses in fairyland ever had their heads cropped.' It was Tempeston's special delight to tease the child about her hair, though he really admired it immensely. ' It's so nice and cool, you know,' the girl answered. ' Fancy, if I let it grow this weather ! ' ' It's not so long as mine, I declare,' Tempeston returned ; ' I believe, Olga, it's a Avig ! Some fine day, when you are not looking, I shall jump up and pull it, to see if it is real. I can hardly prevent myself doing it noAv. Should you mind, Olga, if I did?'

No party, you know, only us three ; for mamma cannot make up her mind to go. It would bring everything back to her so plainly. She loves to talk of him, but she cannot see the place. With me it is different : I like it. Do you understand ? ' Tempeston shook his head as he answered, ' Do you mean because \u2014 because you and Holme were there together ?

Perhaps some day it will give you pleasure, and then you shall tell me all about her. Come, here is mamma ; I hear her step. We must not be sad any longer.'

Tell me, Tempest, do you think your father will raise any objection ? ' ' Oh no, I should not fancy so. It's not as though Mr. Marshall Avas at GrantoAvn. Now that I am not alloAved to do any lessons I may just as well be at Meltonbury as at home.' ' The very thing my husband was saying this morning.

'You are sure you think that the wisest course?' his hostess asked ; ' because, you know, we don't want a refusal.' ' Oh no ! I don't think he will object' 'Very well, then, we will leave it to you. Let us hear the result to-morrow.' ' I will be over at five o'clock,' the boy answered, only too glad of an excuse for so soon coming again. ' It is just six now ; I need not go for a little time yet. Won't you come out, Olga, for a short walk in the garden ? The sun is not very hot.' The young girl rose and left the room.

He was quite different to what he used to be, wanted to know why I was alone, and why I never sent for him, to talk and sit with me, as I did for the others.' Tempeston paused in his speech. He did not like having to tell the story, and grew more and more afraid that Olga would be horrified before it was finished. ' Well ?

That he did so on this occasion shows how strong was his attachment to Olga, and how great his desire not to forfeit her affection. The girl listened in amazement, feeling sure that there must be some mistake, and that no parent could possibly have pursued the course which Tempeston alleged Lord Grantown had done.

'Yes. Well, I have thought of what you must do, Tempest. When you go to ask about coming to Meltonbury, you can easily tell him you are sorry.' The boy looked a little doubtful. ' I have thought of saying it, once or twice,' he answered slowly; 'but \u2014 but just as I got to the library door, the remembrance of that which I told you came over me, and then I \u2014 I couldn't' ' Oh, Tempest, I feel so sure that there is a mistake !

' he said, looking up at the big grey eyes. * Suppose \u2014 suppose that you are right, and that there was no mistake, still you must say you are sorry.

To say you forgive but won't forget is only telling a story. Hush ! it is; mamma told me so once. If you really forgive, really and truly, then you will soon learn to forget.' ' Anything but that one thing,' the boy answered. ' I don't hate him for it as I used, because I believe, you know, that he thought it Avas right to punish me ; but I can never quite forgive it. I shall remember it till I die.' There was a pause in the conversation for a moment, and then Olga spoke again \u2014 spoke shyly, and almost in a whisper. ' Tempest, what if God said that about some offence of ours.' There was no answer, only the colour mounted to the lad's face, and he fidgeted uneasily. ' Can you say the \" Our Father \" ?

' Yes, but He came to set us an example, and if Ave ask Him He will help us to follow it.' Tempeston did not answer, and the girl, with tact, understood that it would be better not to pursue the conversation further at that point. She must wait and see if the little seed she had timidly endeavoured to sow would ripen into anything. It was some minutes before the boy could quite recover himself; but, as Olga cleverly propounded several schemes for passing the time at Meltonbury, he was at length aroused to real interest on the subject. They sat chatting till seven o'clock struck, making Tempeston start ' I must go,' he exclaimed. ' I have to ride home and dress, and all sorts of things, before dinner.' Lady Meltonbury and Olga came and stood at the"], [220, "1 6 Olga. 216 hall door Avhile the young viscount mounted his horse. ' Good-bye,' he said, looking down Avith a sunny smile at the pair. ' Good-bye.' ' Good-bye,' echoed Olga. Don't forget.' Lady Meltonbury only thought her little daughter alluded to the application to be made to Lord Gran town as to the projected visit, but the boy understood the girl's deeper meaning. ' I'll not forget,' he said,\u2014' I'll try.' It Avas just nine o'clock Avhen Helen and Tempeston left their father to the enjoyment of his claret, and passed out into the big gloomy hall. ' I Avish you'd go up-stairs Avhen his time's up for coming out. I have to go and ask if I may go aAvay for a month.' ' Goodness, Tempest, Avhere to ? ' ' Meltonbury.'

The girl kissed her companion affectionately; a salute which was returned by a warm brotherly hug. ' That's what the big monkeys do,' he explained, as Helen endeavoured to repair some of the creases in her frock. ' And small ones, too, sometimes, sir,' she returned, laughing. An exciting race on tiptoe round the hall-table followed, till the girl was caught Tempeston con ducted her to the foot of the schoolroom stairs, and there dismissed her Avith another monkey hug by Avay of punishment. Left once more to himself, he returned to the hall. The youthful viscount sat upon the oak table, swinging his legs, for about five minutes, and then Lord Grantown came out of the dining-room, on his way to the library. He gave a perceptible start as his glance fell on his son, but he passed on, as Avas his Avont now, without a word. To the boy's eye"], [222, "2 1 8 Olga. he looked older, sadder, and greyer, and the sight increased his desire for a reconciliation. Lord Grantown closed the library door behind him, while Tempeston sat on, swinging his legs, and reflecting deeply. He wanted to get up and ask his father's leave for the proposed visit, and he wanted, as he had told Olga, to offer some sort of apology. Olga wanted him to do it, too, but something kept him back. He told himself he was shy, that he didn't know what answer he might receive to any expression of regret which he might utter. The simple truth was, that in the great still hall there was another than Tempeston present, unseen, it is true, by mortal eye, but yet dimly suspected by the boy him self. Yes, close beside him, Avhispering in his ear, was the black spirit Pride. At last the lad did that which we all so often do ; he temporized Avith the evil one. He wouldn't pledge himself to apologize, but would go in and see how things went. If a favourable opportunity arose, why, then, of course, he would do it, but if not, he must Avait a day or two. After all, it would be much easier to say he was"], [223, "Good Advice. 219 sorry just when he was starting to go away than then. Besides, there might not be time ; Helen Avould of course return soon. Any way, he must go and get leave to visit Meltonbury. So the boy got off the table, opened the library door, and went in, while the black spirit followed quickly. There was nothing ghostly about it. He passes in and out with you and me, reader, through the doors we open, very, very often. He is always busy, always attending some one of us, and he will do so as long as the world shall last. Just then, he was with Tempeston, standing on the hearth-rug beside him in Lord Grantown's library. It was with unfeigned astonishment that the last named individual beheld his son before him. Since their interview beneath the trees, the boy had never once entered the library, and the pair had held no converse together. The father's heart beat a little quicker than usual ; perhaps his son had come to say something about those rash and cruel words, to say they were not true. For a moment or two neither spoke.

The boy was looking his best just then, dressed as he was for the evening in his pretty Eton jacket, white tie, and Avear ing a rosebud which Olga had given him for his button-hole. The handsome young face was slightly flushed, while the eyes were hidden by the long downcast lashes, as though he felt abashed before his father. At length the lad gathered courage to make his request. ' Papa, I came to ask if I might go away for a month to Meltonbury. He is going \u2014 Lord Melton bury, that is \u2014 and Olga. I should like to go too. There is splendid shooting and fishing.' During the years Avhich Tempeston had been at school, Lord Grantown had parted from him at the end of each vacation Avithout much regret, but since then things had changed. He knew in a moment, in his own heart, that it would cost him a sharp pang to let his son go aAvay for a whole month, even though he and that son never spoke.

Lord Grantown scarcely kneAv what he was saying. He was thinking \u2014 thinking what a long time is a month ! ' Thank you, papa.' The request had been made, and a favourable reply received. It was, therefore, time to make the apology ; to say those Avords of regret which he had promised Olga to try and say. How should he begin ? ' Not now ; not now,' the black spirit kept Avhisper ing. ' Put it off. Just before the carriage starts \u2014 that will be the proper time ; now is the most inconvenient moment possible.

Amidst their tall ancestral trees, O'er all the pleasant land. The deer across their greensward bound.

In the great state beds had slumbered young King Edward the Sixth, James the Second, and the grandson of that ill-fated monarch, the Young Pretender.

There are some, too, about whom old world notions still cling, and who, when the hoarse cheer of the crowd rings forth, see but little, since their eyes are dim, while in their hearts they whisper, ' May she rule us long !

I will therefore return to my tale, leaving my reader to imagine, as best he may, the great yellow pile of buildings, situated nearly at the foot of a line of hills, covered from end to end with the great green forest. Tempeston felt almost in a dream, as he followed the servant to the room Avhich had been prepared for him. It was a large apartment, simply but elegantly furnished, having three windows with a southern aspect. The lad, as soon as he was alone, made a bound to the open casement, and looked out at the famous flower-gardens, laid out in terraces ; the whole being a perfect blaze of colour. Beyond the garden was a huge lake, half a mile across and nearly a mile long, while beyond this again were the water woods through which the river ran, and then the line of hills already mentioned, covered with their forest dress of green.

' Here you are ! ' he exclaimed joyfully. ' I was afraid I should lose my way completely.' Olga laughed, and pushed open a swing door on the left, which led on to the landing, and together they descended the staircase. ' Come out,' said the girl, taking a parasol belonging to her mother, and leading the way through an open window into the beautiful gardens. Long did the children linger there, happy in the society of each other, and enjoying the calm beauty of the scene.

The dinner presented a marked contrast to that to Avhich Tempeston was accustomed at Grantown. There, the meal was eaten in a big room, badly lighted, and served by a fat butler and a willing but ' dumpy ' footman. At Meltonbury the table was resplendent with gold plate, illuminated by numerous wax-lights carefully shaded, while four tall footmen in powder and black silk stockings glided noiselessly about, under the direction of a butler and a groom of the chambers. As soon as the children were able, they made their escape from table, and Avent out again upon the terrace. Tempeston, however, insisted that Olga should have a shawl or scarf around her; and, when the maid had brought the requisite article, the boy carefully folded it round his young and beautiful companion before alloAving her to go out into the evening air.

September came, and the partridges with it. At eleven o'clock every morning Lord Melton bury and Tempeston started from the house, and it was generally nearly seven before the sound of Avheels coming up the avenue announced their return.

We like to be there, and comfort ourselves by reading the words of Holy Writ cut on the marble cross which marks his resting-place : ' Is it well with the child ? And they answered and said, It is well.' Tempeston did not see so much of Olga as he had expected. They rarely met till dinner-time, and then he and his host generally had a good deal to say about their sport. In the evening Lord Melton bury usually fell asleep, and the boy, being still delicate, felt too tired to walk on the terrace, but liked best to lie on a sofa and listen to Olga playing."], [236, "Olga 232 Thus opportunities for little confidences were few and far between. Towards the end of the month there came a day when there was no shooting. It Avas the third anni versary of the young Lord Holme's death. There Avas morning service at the exquisite private chapel in the park, Avhere the family vault was situated. Tem peston Avas to have been left behind ; but, at the boy's OAvn particular request, he Avas permitted to be present. He sat Avith his friends at the top of the chapel, and Avatched the sunlight fall through the stained windows, in a flood of crimson and blue, upon the great stone above the vault, on Avhich Avas carved the coronet and arms of the house of Meltonbury. Huge Avreaths of azaleas, lilies, and Avhite roses lay in heaps thereon, and the scent of flowers filled the air. Towards the close of the service Lady Meltonbury became greatly overcome, and her husband made her AvithdraAv Avith him, instead of waiting for the end. Thus Olga and Tempeston Avere left alone, and the last Avail of the sad chant had long died aAvay before the slight, graceful little figure in black raised her face"], [237, "The Memory of the Dead. 233 from her hands, and signed to her companion that it was time to go. The tAvo children stepped out into the glorious sunshine, and walked quickly aAvay from the crowd who lingered round the door of the little sanctuary. ' Come into the woods, Tempest,' Olga said. ' It Avill be cool and quiet there. We shall be able to have a little chat. I never see you now.' So the pair Avandered off along the shore of the lake, until they reached the green woods through which the river ran. Following a narrow path, they came to a small bench which stood close to the edge of a bank running down to the stream. Here Olga seated herself, while her companion stretched himself on the grass at her feet. How quiet and pleasant it was, that September day, in the Avater Avoods of Meltonbury ! Scarcely a sound broke the intense and almost Sabbath-like stillness. Now and then overhead the leaves stirred slightly, lifted by the breeze, or a bird sang forth his merry song, Avhile his little voice sounded loud and clear in the silence"], [238, "Olga. 234 which reigned around. Far aAvay to.vards the left came the murmur of the waterfall near the mill, and once or twice a shout from the men at Avork there. Tempeston lay for a long time with his head resting on his arm, and his eyes closed, when suddenly the sound of a faint sob startled him. He looked up, and saw that Olga was weeping bitterly. All the boy's warm heart woke up at once, and he Avas beside her in a moment. ' Don't cry, dear,' he said, taking one of the little black-gloved hands in his own rough ones, \u2014 ' don't cry. I know Avhy it is ; and oh, Olga, I wish that I could bring him back to you ! ' ' Oh, I would not have him back, Tempest,' the girl answered, with a sad little smile. ' We, none of us, Avish that.' The boy gazed at his companion in surprise. ' He was not like others,' the girl went on in her soft, low voice. 'When it \u2014 the fever I mean \u2014 came, and he died, every one said he was too good to live. It was quite true. When people are like that, mamma"], [239, "The Memory of the Dead. 235 says, God often takes them aAvay from the evil world.' There was a silence for a minute, and then Olga spoke again. ' Do you know why I wanted to come here to-day, and brought you Avith me? Well, I will tell you. The last Avalk I ever had with our darling boy was in this wood. It was the Sunday before he was taken ill. He seemed quite well then, and yet \u2014 yet he died on the Thursday.' Again there was a little silence, while the girl tried to subdue her emotion. ' I think it's so good of God not to let us know Avhat is going to happen, don't you ? Now that Sunday Ave were both so happy, and how could I have been like that if I had known ? We came here after church, and he lay where you are now, Tempest, and the day was, oh, so beautiful ! just like this. I remember it all so well ; his lying there, and talking, Avhile the sunlight fell full upon him, and he looked so beautiful. Holme always loved the sunshine.' Again there was a silence."], [240, "Olga. 236 ' No, I would not bring him back,' the girl went on, ' much as I long to see him. Sometimes at night, Tempest, I dream about him, and he ahvays looks so happy, with such a smile upon his face ! Mamma says he looked like that when he was dead. They Avould not let me see him. They were afraid of the infection. I wanted to go, too, so much, just to kiss him once again. It seemed so hard that they should take him away from me Avithout one kiss ; he Avho never went to bed Avithout putting his dear arms round my neck. Oh, Holme ! oh, darling, darling Holme ! ' All the girl's self-command gave way, and a burst of weeping folloAved. Vainly Tempeston, as he knelt beside her, sought to comfort her, but it was long before his words had any effect. ' Though you did not know him, \u2014 never even saw him, \u2014 yet from Avhat I have told you, you love him a little, don't you, Tempest? Say you love him. I cannot bear that he should be forgotten and unknown Say you love him a little, Tempest.' ' Oh, I do, I do, Olga!

There was such sincerity in the tone of her young companion's voice, that the girl knew the words were not merely spoken to comfort her. ' Yes, be like him, Tempest dear, and I shall love you ; we shall all love you, even more than we do now. He always did what was right, at any cost to himself. That was what helped us in those first days. We felt so sure that, after such a life and such a death, he must be happy. Poor papa !

He was walking on the terrace with me, when suddenly he stood still with his hat off\", looking at the sunset for a minute or tAvo, without speaking. Then he turned, and, pointing to the sky, said, \" I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.\" He began to take up his work again the next day, and, though he has never, never been what he was, still I think he is content. He always looks forward to things, and often he says to me, \" When I see Holme again, how much I shall have to tell him ! \" '"], [242, "238 Olga The girl stopped. She had ceased to Avecp, but it was Tempeston's turn now. Olga's simple narrative had already upset him, but the closing words relating to his kind friend Lord Meltonbury entirely overcame him. 'Dear boy,' exclaimed the girl, 'don't cry! It was foolish of me to tell you all this.' ' But I cannot \u2014 I cannot bear to think,' Tempeston ansAvered, ' that he should care for nothing now, but always be looking fonvard to death.' ' Oh, but that is not it, Tempest,' Olga answered. ' Papa would be very sorry to go away and leave me and dear mamma, and you too, I think. Often and often he says how fond he is of you, and hoAv much you put him in mind of our boy. It is only that when death comes it will be sweet for him to meet dear Holme again.' The lad nodded his head, as much as to say he understood. He could not trust his voice, and for a little while the pair sat quiet, until the first luncheon bell startled them. ' We must go, Tempest, or Ave shall be late.

Well, I \u2014 I didn't' ' Oh, Tempest, you have broken your word !

The girl could not but grant a petition so worded ; otherwise, I think, she would have given poor Tem peston the rebuke of which he stood in such need. Alas, that she did not do so ! The boy's speech did not please her at all. ' I mean to be like Holme \u2014 I will tell papa I am sorry \u2014 I will never do wrong or be angry again.' It was not the sort of speech the dead brother used to make, if she pointed out to him any trifling disagreeeble duty.

THE remaining days of September fled all too quickly for Tempeston, and on the ist of October he journeyed back home with the Meltonburys, Avho were again returning to Shirley Park. Lady Meltonbury was glad to leave Shropshire. She felt she had done Avisely in overcoming her feelings and facing the place, but when the time came for returning to Shirley she rejoiced. Poor Avoman ! the visit to her had been one long heartache. Each spot around that stately home was associated in her mind Avith her dead son. It had been terrible to her to be Avhere, hitherto, the lad had ever been at her side, ..."], [247, "Broken Faith. 243 but still she had held up bravely. Once, and once only, her self-command gave way, and that was when her husband, having paid a visit to the dead heir's rooms, came to ask if she would not like to see them too. She shrieked aloud then at the first mention of the proposal. ' Go there ! ' she cried ; ' go Avhere my darling used to be ! No, no ! \u2014 never ! As long as life shall last I Avill keep away from there.' Lord Meltonbury did not renew the proposition. He, Olga, and Tempeston, Avhom the girl invited to join them, were the only persons who visited the apart ments, Avhich were usually kept locked up. The rooms were apparently just as they had been in the young heir's lifetime. In reality they had been fresh painted and done up generally immediately after his death, so as to destroy all taint of the infectious malady to which he had succumbed. The apartments were tAvo in number, \u2014 a bedroom and a study, both overlooking the flower-gardens, and opening out of each other. The walls were hung Avith pictures of Landseer's and a few hunting sketches. There were"], [248, "Olga. 244 numerous antlers, bearing sticks, fishing-rods, and Avhips without end. In a corner Avas a cricket-bat. The sleeping-chamber .vas nearly as large as the sitting room, but the walls there were hung mostly with sacred engravings. The group stole silently round the room. Now and then the young girl paused, and touched some familiar object of former days lovingly, as though she had met an old friend, but that was all. They did not speak, and Tempeston, with his Avarm heart, had hard Avork to keep back the tears Avhich would rise to his eyes Avhen ever he looked at the faces of Lord Meltonbury and his daughter. A few days after the visit to the rooms of the dead young Earl of Holme, the party, as I have said, left Shropshire for Grantown and Shirley Park respectively. Tempeston was very sorry to part Avith his kind friends, even though they would still see each other pretty often. He knew how much he should miss his daily intercourse Avith Olga, and he Avas also deeply attached to both Lord and Lady Meltonbury. The young viscount bade adieu to his friends at the"], [249, "Broken Faith. 245 station near GrantoAvn, where they all alighted, and took his place in the dogcart which had been sent to meet him with a sad heart. He drove along the familiar road, entered the park, nodding kindly to the old woman who swung back the lodge gate, and in a few minutes arrived at the familiar door. Miss Emmett, Helen, and Lina Avere all in the hall to welcome him. The boy Avas really glad to see them, and gave an affectionate embrace to each. They went up-stairs, and the young traveller was refreshed Avith a cup of tea ; while the governess and Lina discussed their substantial evening meal, and Helen sat by and seemed rather thoughtful. Tempeston talked a great deal. He had an immense amount to tell about his kind friends, their beautiful place, and the splendid shooting he had had. ' You have got quite strong again, then ? ' Miss Emmett asked at length, Avhen she and Lina had finished and were ready to rise from table. 'Oh, quite strong,' the boy answered; 'fit to fight anybody noAv.'"], [250, "246 Olga. That's right,' the lady replied, smiling. ' Noav you will have to think about work again.' ' Oh, I suppose so.' There was a little silence. The governess and the two girls looked at each other, as though they wished to say something but were unable to make up their minds to do so. At length Helen took courage, and broke the silence which had fallen upon the group since Miss Emmett's last speech and the boy's reply. ' Tempest, do you know there's some one here ? ' she asked, \u2014 ' some one you don't like.' ' No. Who is it ? ' ' Mr. Marshall.' ' That beast ! ' ' My dear Tempest ! ' exclaimed the governess, but her tone of remonstrance was very mild. ' I can't help it,' Tempeston answered ; ' he is such a complete beast. When did he come ? ' ' He arrived yesterday,' Helen returned. ' I do not think papa expected him in the least Indeed, I know he was very much surprised ; but it turned out, after a"], [251, "Broken Faith. 247 bit, that when you were taken ill, and Mr. Marshall went away, papa said something about beginning work again on the 1st of October, and the consequence was that, as I said, he arrived yesterday.' ' Have you seen him ? ' the boy asked. ' Seen him ! Good gracious, yes ! He dined with me and papa last night. You will meet him at dinner by and by.' ' How awful ! What on earth did he talk about ? ' 'You, mostly. 'No!' ' He did, really. I do not think papa quite cared about it He said something about meaning to make you work very hard, and papa stopped him quite shortly, saying that everything must be done very gently, and that you were never to have anything to do after the morning was over.' ' Well, that's a good thing,' sighed Tempeston ' After. vards there was quite a sort of quarrel,' Helen went on ; ' because, when they came out of the dining-room, I heard Mr. Marshall say he had understood you were to be left quite in his hands,"], [252, "248 Olga. and that, if he had known that such was not to be the case, he should not have undertaken the charge of you.' 'I Avish he hadn't,' the boy retorted. 'Well, what did papa say after that ? ' ' Oh, nothing then, because I was there ; but I believe they sat up talking late, till nearly one o'clock, and to-day at luncheon papa hardly spoke, and seemed dreadfully put out.' ' Serve him right ! ' Tempeston answered disrespect fully. ' He should not have engaged such an awful brute.' ' My dearest boy ! ' Miss Emmett again exclaimed. ' Oh, it's no use saying anything else ! ' the young viscount ansAvered ; ' you'll say he's one directly you see him, Emmett dear.' ' I hope I shall do nothing of the kind,' the governess answered, laughing. ' I have seen a great many people in my time, and I'm quite positive I never used such an epithet about any one of them. Besides, Tempest, I have seen him.' ' When ? '"], [253, "Broken Faith. 249 ' In London, frequently. You forget, dear ; and I met him at luncheon to-day, too.' ' Well, and Avhat did you think of him ? Tell us the truth, Emmett dear, the Avhole truth.' ' He did not strike me \u2014 indeed, he never did \u2014 as being a very prepossessing person. I daresay, though, that is because his appearance is a little against him.' ' I should think it was,' the boy returned energeti cally. ' He's got the beastliest \u2014 no, I can't help it, Emmett dear \u2014 the beastliest eyes I ever saw ; just like great black beads, you know.' ' He can't help his eyes,' said Helen. ' Oh, don't let's talk about him ! ' answered her brother. ' If Ave don't talk or think of the fellow, perhaps I may be able to prevent myself from kicking him at dinner.' ' I hope you will refrain,' said Miss Emmett, smiling. ' It's not generally the way young gentlemen behave to their private tutors.' It was with a beating heart that Tempeston pre pared to go down-stairs the same evening, when he had"], [254, "Olga. 250 finished his toilet for dinner. He had forgotten all about Mr. Marshall, and was thinking only of his meeting with Lord Grantown. He had promised Olga that, if his father seemed to remember what had previously passed betAveen them, he Avould apologize for his hasty Avords. He fully meant to keep that promise. Pride Avas very busy telling him he would loAver himself, and urging sundry objections to the course he proposed to take ; but the odds against the black spirit were heavy. The recollection of a curly golden head and big grey eyes was still very strong with Tempeston ; so he descended the stairs nervously, fully intending to keep his promise. The young heir crossed the hall and reached the library door. He paused for a moment, then opened it and entered the apartment. Pride Avaited outside. The boy's heart Avas too full of good resolutions, just then, to make it worth his while to go in also. The black spirit Avaited in the big, gloomy hall. The lad hardly dared to lift his eyes for a minute, then he raised them. Lord GrantoAvn Avas standing alone on the rug before the unlighted fire, and looking"], [255, "Broken Faith. 251 at him. The boy went forward, holding out his hand. ' How do you do, papa ? ' he said shyly. Lord Grantown shook the rough, well-shaped palm, while he looked his son carefully over. ' How do you do ? ' he said at length in return. Are you quite strong again ? ' Such a kind tone, such a look of affectionate regard ! Tempeston almost choked. Of course he Avould apologize ! Hoav easy it was after all ! The only difficulty was how to begin. ' Quite strong,' the lad ansAvered cheerfully. 'That's Avell, that's well. And you had good shooting ? ' ' Awfully good.' Fancy his father asking about the shooting ! How jolly it all Avas ! There was a silence, while the boy racked his brain, thinking hoAv to begin his little speech. Suppose he broke down ! Suppose Helen or some one came into the room ! The best thing would be to say everything very quickly ; as fast as ever he could, in fact. It would be over in a minute that way. After all, it"], [256, "Olga 252 would not be a Avorse minute than he spent at the dentist's once. He Avould begin at once.

I daresay, perhaps, you have forgotten all about it, and didn't care really. It Avas something I said to you under the trees, Avhen I Avas ill.' ' I \u2014 I have not forgotten. I did care, my dear.' Such a kind, happy voice ! If his father spoke like that again, he should cry. He mustn't on any account do that. The apology must be finished at once. It was silly to make a muff of oneself. He was so busy with his thoughts that he never heard the footsteps on the thick carpet of some one Avho had just entered the room. Lord Grantown did not hear either. He was looking with all his eyes at his son, waiting for words he knew were just coming. Then \u2014 then he would snatch his boy to himself, and Tempeston Avould look up at him with those big blue eyes of his, look up as he had"], [257, "Broken Faith. 253 seen him do at Lord Meltonbury. In a minute, only a minute ! ' Well,' Tempeston went on at length, ' I thought \u2014 I mean \u2014 I didn't mean \u2014 I am very' \u2014 A noise behind startled the speaker. He glanced up and beheld Mr. Marshall. It was he who had entered the room unheard by either of the occupants ; and in another second, too, through the open door, had come Pride. ' I fear I intrude,' the tutor began, softly rubbing his hands ; ' but I understood we gathered in the library before dinner. I trust, young man, you will finish the apology you are making, and ' \u2014 ' Mind your own business ! ' Tempeston exclaimed, furious with anger in a moment at being detected in what he regarded as a most humiliating position \u2014 by Mr. Marshall, too, of all people in the world ! ' Tempest ! ' exclaimed Lord Grantown, in a pained Voice, \u2014 ' Tempest ! ' ' Well,' burst forth the boy, ' Avhat business is it of his, what I say or do?

He longed to turn him out of the house, then and there ; but he Avas a just man, and knew that Mr. Marshall Avas not really to blame. ' Tempest !

' It's you Avho ought to be ashamed,' the other exclaimed, with flashing eyes, \u2014 ' you, who steal about the house like a spy to pick up what you can hear. You came creeping in like that on purpose, and stood there meanly listening. No gentleman would have done such a thing \u2014 but then you are not a gentleman.' Mr. Marshall, though a short man, was yet a power ful one. He was not good-tempered, \u2014 indeed he was rather the reverse, \u2014 and the last audacious sentence from his pupil's lips overcame him completely. He stepped up to the boy and struck him such a box on the ear that the lad staggered, and all but fell. All but fell ! In another moment Tempeston re covered, and, half mad Avith anger and outraged pride, flung himself on his assailant. The latter was a little"], [260, "Olga. 256 taken aback, and he received tAvo well-delivered blows before he recovered. The tutor, as I have said, was a strong man, and the boy Avas no match against him. The former caught Tempeston's left arm in a grip of iron, and with his right hand delivered blow after bloAv on the boy's ear. In a few seconds the latter was swaying half senseless in Mr. Marshall's grasp, and the tutor realized, not without alarm, that he had, in spite of his provocation, gone a little too far. He tried to hold the lad up, but it was a difficult task. At this juncture Helen appeared, and the first glance at her young brother's appearance told her Avhat had happened.

I was absolutely obliged to defend myself against your son, who has even dared to strike me in the face. Pray observe the state I am in.' ' Papa,' said Helen, 'it was very wrong of Tempest, but I saw the manner in Avhich Mr. Marshall struck him. He might have killed him. Just look at him !

Lord Grantown glanced in alarm at his son, but, seeing that he Avas quite sensible, he recovered himself. ' Do I understand that he has struck you, Mr. Marshall ?

Tempeston had hardly got out into the hall, Avhere the dining-room doors were open, and the servants standing wondering at the delay, before his father joined him. It was evident at a glance that the lad Avas sick and faint. The boy paused for a moment at the hall table to rest, and the next moment his senses nearly left him with surprise. Lord Grantown had stooped, picked him up, and Avas carrying him up-stairs. On the landing near the schoolroom the pair fell in Avith Miss Emmett and Lina, both of whom uttered an exclama tion of horror. ' It's nothing,' Lord Grantown said. 'The boy forgot himself while I was out of the room, and struck his tutor. He has received his punishment ; rather more than he deserved, I believe.' ' I should think so,' exclaimed Miss Emmett, glancing at the Avhite, exhausted youth. ' Lina,' said Lord Grantown, ' you will not speak to"], [265, "Broken Faith. 261 your brother till I give you leave. Miss Emmett, you will kindly only address him Avhen necessary.

Perhaps you will look in just to see he wants for nothing, in about an hour ? ' ' Certainly ; ' and Miss Emmett withdrew. Very tenderly Lord Grantown laid his son on the couch, and then, turning, struck a match and lighted a pair of candles on the mantelpiece. It Avas years since the OAvner of the mansion had been in that apartment. He glanced round the room, which was very nicely furnished, and almost smiled at the numerous arrangements for comfort which the boy had made. His eye took in every detail, and, knowing the lad's allowance, he fairly started when they rested on the dressing-table covered with the silver and ivory contents of a magnificent dressing-case Avhich stood thereon. Where on earth had the boy got such a thing?"], [266, "262 Olga. ' Tempest,' he said, ' where did you get this \u2014 these silver things from ? ' ' Lord Meltonbury,' the boy murmured faintly. The sound recalled the father to the bed. 'You must undress at once,' he said. His son made a few attempts, but he Avas so evidently done up that Lord Granto.vn lent his assist ance. Tired and weak as he was, somehoAv or another the youth recognised that it pleased his father to do this for him. How he kneAv it, he could not tell ; he simply understood that such was the case. Even his silk socks were taken off for him, and when he was ensconced in his neat little bed his father tucked him up carefully. ' Have you got all you Avant ? Lord Grantown asked. ' Y \u2014 yes,' said the boy, half crying. He Avanted to tell his father how sorry he Avas ; but he couldn't. The latter understood it all, but he felt it was his duty that he should cause his son to apologize to Mr. Marshall, before coming to any terms with him himself. So he took no notice, merely saying, ' Some supper"], [267, "Broken Faith. 263 will be sent up directly ; ' and then Tempeston was left alone. The meal was brought, and the boy ate and drank, and then Miss Emmett came in to see that all was right ; soon afterwards the light was put out and the lad fell asleep. He half Avoke once, and fancied there had been a light in his eyes, and that some one had lifted the hair from his brow and kissed him, but he didn't knoAv. It must have been a dream, though, because Emmett had kissed him when she went away at ten, and he had certainly heard the clock strike two Avhen he half awoke. It could not be either Helen or Lina at that hour. ' Only a dream,' he murmured, and, turning over, he fell asleep again. Lord Grantown softly descended the stairs."], [268, "CHAPTER XII. GOOD-BYE.

Breakfast was brought to his apartment as soon as he had finished dressing, and then a message came from his father that he might go out for an hour in the morning and a couple of hours in the afternoon. It was a dull day to the boy, though he availed him self of the permission to Avalk. All his meals, like breakfast, Avere sent up to him, and no one came in to talk secretly. Miss Emmett, it is true, paid him a couple of visits, to know if he Avas quite well ; but even she Avas glum. The truth was that Lord GrantoAvn 26."], [269, "Good- Bye. 265 had given the schoolroom party very positive orders to hold no communication with Tempeston. He had explained that it was absolutely necessary the boy should be made to apologize to his tutor, while the sadness of his manner showed that no one was more oppressed at the captive's imprisonment than he Avho had ordered it. Miss Emmett told her pupils she thought their father quite right, and the girls sighed and did as they were bid. Once or twice during her visits to the boy's apart ment the governess implored him to obey his father. She strongly urged the point, saying that he was only punishing himself by not doing so ; and this was quite true. Miss Emmett knew something which Tempeston did not know, and which no one else knew. Lord Grantown had closely questioned Helen as to Mr Marshall's treatment of his son, and the father had communicated privately to the governess that, when the boy apologized, he meant to give the tutor his dismissal then and there. But Tempeston was angry, and Tempeston was proud. He would not give in. He would die rather,"], [270, "Olga. 266 he told himself, than apologize to such a one as Mr. Marshall. Miserable, wretched, and lonely as he Avas, still he Avould not yield. The days Avent by, and the lad remained nursing his anger and outraged feelings, either in the solitude of his own room, or while wandering in the grounds. He wondered and tortured himself in wondering Avhat the Meltonburys would think of his never going to see them ; and yet he did not want to see them, \u2014 least of all did he Avish to meet Olga. How completely he had failed ! In every respect, in everything he could, he had gone contrary to the promises he had given the girl under the trees in the Avater Avoods at Meltonbury. His friendship with her and her relations was over. He had promised and failed, promised and again sailed. ' Oh, Tempest ! I did not think you would have broken your word to me.' Olga's remark came back to him, and with it the renewal of the pledge beneath the green leaves. He was to have tried to be like Holme ! Well, that dream was over. Anything less like the dead boy's conduct"], [271, "Good-Bye. 267 than his own had been, he could not well imagine. He would give up the Meltonburys, give up Olga, and his good resolutions. He had failed twice, and would struggle no more. If the girl came over, and he saw her, and she urged him to apologize, as he was certain she Avould, then he would refuse. He had tried to be good and failed, failed miserably. Now he would return to his old ways, and be like he was at Eton, when he did not trouble his head about anything but pleasing himself. His mind was made up. After the lamentable result of his attempts at doing better, he would struggle no more. But the Meltonburys and Olga ? Well, he must say good-bye to them, like everything else that was good. After all, he had done very well without them before he knew them, and it was a great bore trying to be better than other fellows. It was one fine afternoon, an hour after luncheon, and a week exactly from the date of the scene in the library, that Tempeston, lying on the sofa in his room, came to the above resolutions. He had just arrived at the last conclusion, Avhen the sound of hoofs made him"], [272, "268 Olga. start In a moment he was at the windoAV, and in time to see Olga riding up to the house, followed by a groom. Tempeston's heart beat fast He heard the door bell ring, and in a minute or tAvo the horses Avere being led up and down the gravel sweep in front of the house. The girl had come in, then, and was probably Avith his sister Helen, or in the schoolroom. Those stupid people were sure to let out something about it ! He Avould get out of the Avay at once, or he might be sent for, if Olga thought of asking Lord GrantoAvn's leave. The boy took his hat and crept down stairs. Tempeston did not come across any one in his flight through the hall, and, once outside, he felt compara tively safe. If they did call from the big schoolroom window, he could pretend not to hear. No one, how ever, interfered Avith him, and he Avent down the road to the stables, and then along a broad path through the plantations, till he came to a great gate Avith a padlock on it. This gate led into a private lane, rarely used. In the time of Lord Grantown's grandfather, it"], [273, "Good- Bye. 269 was the way to the kennels ; but these had long since disappeared. From disuse, the grass had grown upon the path, and the only person whose footsteps ever trod there once in six months was Tempeston. The boy used it because he could go to Shirley Park that way, it being just about the same distance as by the high road, and possessing the great attraction of run ning part of the Avay alongside the railway. Indeed, for nearly half a mile, there was no barrier, even in the shape of a fence, between the grass-grown, deserted lane and the iron lines along which the express trains used to rush. Tempeston only went to Shirley by the private path when -he was walking. His father had always strictly forbidden his riding there, as, at such close quarters, a horse might well be excused if frightened by the noise of the engines. The day, how ever, of which I write, Tempeston had no intention of going to Shirley. He simply meant to walk down, and wait to see a train or two pass. That would probably fill up the time of Olga's visit, and then he could return in safety to the house. The boy undid the padlock, and pushed the iron"], [274, "Olga. 270 gate open. He would not shut it He would be returning in an hour or so, and no one ever came that way. He went on a little, when the sound of a horse snorting, close behind, caused him to start and look round. It was Olga, mounted on her chestnut mare. The boy, as he took off his hat, grew very red, and looked about for some way of escape. The road, just at that point, Avas lined on either side by two great banks, crowned Avith high hedges, \u2014 more like a Devon shire than a Dorsetshire lane. It was, therefore, absolutely impossible for him to get aAvay. Olga greeted the lad Avith a little laugh, though her face looked very grave. ' How do you do?' she said, stretching out a delicate hand, enveloped in a natty little gauntlet ' If Nelly had not snorted like that, I should have come up beside you without your seeing me.' ' Hoav did you know where I Avas ? ' the boy asked rather roughly. ' I saw you go off, from the schoolroom window. By the time I had said good-bye to the others, you had had a little start ; but Helen, whom I told that"], [275, "Good-Bye. 271 I Avanted to see you, guessed Avhere you had gone, and described the way I was to follow. This is the road that comes out near the lodge at Shirley, is it not, and runs by the raihvay ? I thought so. Helen says you like to watch the trains pass ! I did not think you were such a big baby, Tempest.' Olga gave quite a merry little laugh. She had pulled up, and was looking down at her companion. The children formed a striking picture, \u2014 the girl, in her short habit, with her golden locks and lovely grey eyes, sitting firmly in her saddle ; and the boy, with his big blue orbs and flushed handsome face, looking up at her. There was a little silence, and then Olga said, \u2014 ' Do you know, Tempest, why I folloAved ? I want you to do something for me? Will you? I Avant you to come back to the house ; tell Mr. Marshall you are sorry ; then order your horse, and ride back with me to Shirley to dinner. Your servant can easily bring your things.' The boy shook his head. ' Oh, but you must ! ' Olga went on. ' I know you"], [276, "Olga. 272 won't refuse me, and, besides, I want some one to come and take care of me on the Avay back. You see I have sent my groom home, because I could not bring him here when I Avanted to talk to you like this. Say you'll come.' ' I'll come, but I won't apologize.' ' That cannot be, Tempest. Your father Avould not allow it, and I should refuse to let you ride Avith me.' ' All right. I don't Avant to.' ' Tempest, I think you are very unkind. Ah, do, dear boy ; do as I ask. You'll be ever so much happier. I can see you are miserable now. Come back, and tell the man you are sorry, and then we will order your horse and be off directly. I have such lots to tell you, and you must come to take care of me, because Nelly shied twice, riding over. Fancy Nelly, who never shies !' ' I tell you I'll come, but I won't apologize. He struck ' \u2014 ' Tempest,' broke in Olga, ' I don't Avant to hear anything about it. I told your sisters so, when they began.

You don't know what I know, and you're ever so foolish, dear boy, to delay the matter. Come, now, and I'll walk Nelly all the way back to the house, and we will talk about all sorts of things, and not think about Mr. Marshall till you go into the room. Then you can just say how sorry you are, and everything will be right' ' No, I won't,' retorted Tempeston. Pride and Anger, those two ugly spirits, were there in the quiet lane. The boy did not know it, did not think about it ; but they were there, all the same. 'Ah, Tempest, do \u2014 for my sake,' Olga pleaded. The last three words nearly overcame the boy ; but alas ! he had dallied with those black sprites too long to rid himself of them easily. If we would only break away from the Tempter early in the temptation, how much easier he would be to conquer ! When we keep him Avith us, then, ah ! then, he is very hard to banish. All the remembrance of the scene in the library, when Tempeston's pride had been outraged, 18"], [278, "Olga. 274 rose up before him. He hardened his heart against his kind little friend. ' No, I won't,' he retorted again. ' Why should I ? You don't care a bit for me. Of course I'm wrong. I shan't come ; and, Avhat's more, I don't mean to come and see you again.' ' Not again, Tempest ! ' The big grey eyes were open wide with surprise, and the beautiful young face looked very sad. ' Not again, Tempest dear ! Why, I thought you were going to be like a brother to me, and try and supply the place of the one I lost ! I don't think you can mean what you say. I'm sure \u2014 I'm sure you don't' Things were getting uncomfortable. The boy Avas conscious of a disagreeable lump in his throat, Avhile the glimpse of the sad, sorroAvful little face looking down nearly finished him altogether. He wouldn't look there again. If he did, he might be led into humiliating himself to that odious man ; and he would rather die than that, he thought. ' It's no use talking,' he broke forth at length. ' I never, never will apologize to that fellow, as long as 1"], [279, "Good- Bye. 275 live. Let my father send him away, and I don't mind saying I am sorry to him for what I said, but to Marshall \u2014 no, never, never ! ' Matters looked hopeless ; still Olga would not quite give up. ' Dear Tempest, what does it matter, just humbling yourself for a minute ? You know you have done wrong, and ought to say so. Come back now, and do as I ask. Won't you ? ' No answer. ' Dear Tempest, do, for my sake.' Again the little pleading voice almost upset him, and again Pride conquered. * I Avon's ' And that is really your answer to me, after coming to find you and all ? Oh, Tempest, I didn't think you Avould \u2014 you could \u2014 refuse me like this ! ' No reply. ' Am I to go away and leave you, Tempest ? ' ' I don't care whether you go or stay.' Even this ungracious answer did not upset the girl's SAveet temper."], [280, "Olga. 276 ' I think you do not quite mean Avhat you say,' she said, with a little smile. 'Well, then, I do. I don't want to see you, or any of you, again. You are always against me, and I \u2014 I hate you \u2014 there ! ' ' Tempest,' exclaimed Olga very gravely, ' I did not think you could speak to me like that ! you, an Eton boy and a gentleman ! ' The rebuke stung Tempeston, and he felt he had justly deserved it ; but unfortunately he was one who, when he had lost his temper, generally lost it still more because he was annoyed at having done so at all. As usual, on this occasion he plunged still deeper into the angry stream. ' I Avon't talk any more,' he answered roughly. ' You are always against me, and only want me to apologize because you know I hate it, and won't. I'll never be friends with any of you again \u2014 never!' 'Tempest,' said Olga, 'do you remember your promise ? Is this trying to be like Holme ? ' ' No, it's not, and I don't want to be either. He was a muff, I know.'"], [281, "Good-Bye. 277 ' Oh, Tempest ! ' Such surprise, horror, and regret were all contained in the ejaculation, that the speaker of these last shame ful words would have given millions to have been able to recall them. As usual, though, he only sank deeper instead of trying to rise. ' There ! ' he exclaimed ; * I think I have got rid of you at last. I have been trying to do so for a long time. I'm sick to death of your preaching, and I don't mean to stand it any more \u2014 there ! ' Tempeston, at the conclusion of these words, turned round, and began to stride back towards home. He did not glance at the girl, so he never saw that she was weeping bitterly. He was mad with rage at him self for behaving as he had, and scarcely knew what he was doing. He had not gone many paces, when the mare was beside him. ' Stop, Tempest ! ' Olga exclaimed. ' If you are tired of being friends, \u2014 and I suppose you are after what you have said, \u2014 we will not part in anger. Won't you shake hands ? I know you did not mean what"], [282, "278 Olga. you said \u2014 that about him. Shake hands. Look, I'm not a bit cross, and I Avon't come to trouble you any more. Good-bye, Tempest ! ' The young voice was full of tears. Surely he would answer, Avould accept the little outstretched hand? ' Good-bye, Tempest,' she said again. The light of the October sun fell on the young and lovely child as she spoke, illuminating the fair cheeks still wet with tears. She looked like some youthful saint, her whole face lighted up by the sun and the still greater light of SAveet forgiveness for the cruel words that had been spoken. Surely the boy must listen to that gentle tone, must grant her what she pleaded for. Oh, Tempest, boy whom I have loved, do not refuse ! Life is so uncertain ! Who can tell that ye tAvain will meet on earth again ? Answer, answer, as she has asked ! For one moment the youth stood still. For one moment there was a struggle, and then \u2014 then Pride and Anger triumphed, as they ever will if we dally with them. He turned Avithout a word, strode on through"], [283, "Good-Bye. 279 the gate, banged it behind him, and quickly fastened the padlock. The whole thing was so sudden, that Olga had not moved, had not realized what Avas being done, till she saw herself shut out. She trotted quickly to the gate then. ' Tempest,' she exclaimed, ' let me through ! I have only an hour to spare. Papa is going to London by the five o'clock train, as he has to start for Balmoral to-night. I have promised to be back before he leaves.' ' Be back then,' the boy retorted rudely, forgetting that he was a gentleman, and everything else, in rage at his own foolish conduct, \u2014 ' be back. That road leads straight to Shirley.' ' But I cannot go by the railway ; Nelly Avould be frightened \u2014 she might shy \u2014 I might be thrown ! I tell you, Tempest, I must be back. Pray, pray, open the gate ! ' ' 1 won't ! Go by the railway, and I hope she will shy.' Half mad with the passion which had now com pletely mastered him, the boy strode on once more;"], [284, "Olga. 280 and the girl, having glanced at hei watch, fov.nd that she must either go by the lane, if she would see her father, or give it up and wait for the time Avhen some one should pass and open the gate, and enable her to reach the high road. Olga chose the former. She could not let her father go for a whole fortnight Avith out saying good-bye. She turned Nelly round, and set off down the park, trusting that no trains would pass Avhile she was near the line. We will now return to Tempeston. For the first ten minutes. after he had left Olga, he walked forward, not knowing Avhere he was going. His brain was confused. He cursed himself for his conduct, and in doing so acknoAvledged that he had been a blackguard and no gentleman. What Avould Lord Meltonbury say when his daughter related what had taken place that afternoon ? Very likely he Avould come over at the first opportunity, and thrash a fellow who had treated a young girl as he had treated Olga. What would the boys at Eton have said to him ? What would Emmett, and Helen, and Lina say? Stop, though, very likely Olga would not tell ! Had she ever"], [285, "Good- Bye. 281 done anything unkind? Oh, what a fool he had been ! Tempeston had got so far in his reflections, when he found himself at the point where the road from the plantations joined the drive leading up to the house. He turned quickly back. He did not want to be seen ; he wanted, instead, to be alone and think what was best to be done. So Tempeston began to retrace his steps, and he had hardly done so before the idea struck him that, if he did not really wish to forfeit his character as a gentleman completely, he must go back and open the gate for Olga. He had begun to repent of the act a second after it was done, but it was only after ten minutes' reflection that the full enormity of his offence seemed to strike him. He set off running, as soon as he had made up his mind. The boy was fleet of foot ; indeed, his room was filled with cups won in the playing fields at Eton, engraved with such inscriptions as 'The Quarter Mile,' 'The Mile,' 'The Half Mile.' As he bounded down the steep hill, the dreadful thought occurred \u2014 what if Olga had really gone by the lane ? He knew how close the path was"], [286, "282 Olga to the railway. Fancy, if Nelly shied ! Fancy, if Olga was thrown and hurt ! It was too horrid to think of for a moment ! He put it aAvay from him ; nevertheless he increased his speed, and, just five minutes after his determination to return, he reached the padlocked gate. He had been gone, in all, a quarter of an hour. The boy looked through the iron bars eagerly, Avhilst unfastening the lock ; but there Avas no Olga to be seen. A few yards farther, and the lane turned sharply to the left, and from that point he could gain a view of the road for at least half a mile. In less than a minute Tempeston was standing, panting for breath, on the spot. No, there was no one in sight. Olga had dis appeared ; and, if she had ridden quickly, \u2014 and she probably Avould, wishing to see her father before he started, \u2014 the girl by that time must be half-way to Shirley. It was useless to folloAv. He was a dis graceful little blackguard, and if the Meltonburys never spoke to him again it would serve him perfectly right Sadly, Tempeston Avalked back, locked the gate, and"], [287, "Good-Bye. 283 then, flinging himself doAvn on the grass, gave himself up to thought. What had he done ? What had not his silly pride and violent temper led him into ? He had quarrelled Avith his best friend \u2014 his dear, dear little Olga. A great lump rose in the boy's throat Avhen the thought of the girl's kind Avords came back to him, and after such disgraceful conduct as his ! And, with this, came also the remembrance of what he had dared to say about the dead Holme \u2014 the Holme whose name was never mentioned, save softly, as though it meant some sacred thing ! ' I don't want to be like him. He was a muff, I know.' What words \u2014 what words to have used about the dead ! That was the Avay he had repaid the kindness of Lord and Lady Meltonbury and Olga ! Well, he had killed that friendship for ever. He would never see Lord Meltonbury's kind eyes looking down at him, or Avalk arm-in-arm with him again. It wasn't likely. The thought was too much for Tempeston, and he burst out sobbing."], [288, "Olga. 284 Long did the lad lie on the soft grass, taking no heed of time or anything else. Once he raised his head from his arms, and that was Avhen he heard, in the distance, the whistle of a train. He took out his watch. It was five o'clock, and that, of course, was the express which was to take Lord Meltonbury to town. He laid his head down again wearily, with a great sigh, and Avent on thinking about his misery ; and while he was so thinking, exhausted by passion and its after-fatigue, he fell fast asleep. It was very dark Avhen the lad woke, with a great start He had been dreaming; but about Avhat he could not remember, only it seemed as if it had been something horrid, for he felt frightened. He pulled out his watch and peered at it through the fast deepen ing tAvilight Twenty-five minutes to seven ! He had left the house at three, and it was part of his punish ment that he should not stay out more than tAvo hours at a time. What would his father say?

He remained sitting on the grass, Avhich Avas wet"], [289, "Good- Bye. 285 with the evening dew, and began to think about his troubles. All at once a brilliant idea flashed across the boy's brain. If he went home, and straightway apologized to Mr. Marshall, very likely his father would allow him to go to Shirley that same evening. Once there, he would see Olga, and then he would go dowrt on his knees, and beg her to forgive him and forget what he had said. That, he felt sure, was Avhat Holme would have done, if Holme had ever been as naughty and wicked as he had been. By asking Mr. Marshall's pardon he would show Olga he was in earnest. Yes, he would beg the tutor's pardon, and that of his father, he determined, and anybody's else's they liked, \u2014 the butler's, even, if ft pleased them, though he hadn't done the butler any wrong. He would do all this \u2014 anything \u2014 so that he might be allowed to go to Shirley, for he suddenly felt as if he must, at any cost, see Olga that night and beg forgiveness. The resolution once taken, the boy jumped to his feet and began running home as fast as he could. He did not feel very unhappy then, for he kne.v Olga"], [290, "286 Olga. so well that he felt pretty sure she would not tell her father about him. Olga never, never did Avhat Avas unkind. She Avould forgive him, and then, Avhat should he do ? Hoav should he thank her ? He knew. He would tell her that he would be a brother to her, try, really try this time, to grow something like dead Holme ; and then \u2014 then he would seal his promise with a kiss. To be sure, he had never done such a thing before, but he felt that such a promise and such a reconciliation must have something special about it. Tempeston emerged from the Avood just then, and bounded along the gravel drive and out on to the sweep before the house. He Avas dashing quickly up to the portico when he heard, with a great start, his father's voice calling. 1 Tempest ! Tempest ! Is that you ? The sound came from under the grey pillars.

There was only one other occupant of the chamber besides the invalid and these two, and that Avas Lord Grantown. The nobleman was sitting on the bed, supporting his son in his arms, while the young head rested on his shoulder. Tempeston's eyes were closed.

Something had happened, but, save that it was some thing terrible, he could not tell what it was that had occurred. He was in bed, and there were people in the room, because he had been ill.

Why was he ' poor.' His father had called him ' poor ' and kissed him ! He couldn't understand it at all. His father had never kissed him before. He Avas ill ; perhaps he was dying ! This last thought roused the lad. It was like the word he wanted to supply a missing link,- \u2014 not dying, but dead !

' he moaned aloud, \u2014 ' have mercy ! ' There was such an agony of remorse in the tone that the listeners started. ' What is it, my child ? ' Lord Grantown asked, bending over his boy ; and again the answer came, \u2014 ' Don't touch me. Put me away from you. I am not fit' ' Is he sensible ? ' the anxious father asked of the medical man, who had drawn near. Tempeston's eyes were wide open, and looking straight at Lord Grantown. The doctor examined the young face closely before he answered, \u2014 ' Perfectly. Something on his mind, perhaps.'"], [297, "Gates Ajar. 293 ' What is it, my child ? ' the father urged again. 1 What is it that ails you ? ' 1 Put me away. I am not fit' Again the same answer. ' I cannot understand him,' Lord Granto.vn said, speaking to the doctor. ' Anything the matter, my boy ? ' asked the physi cian kindly, and laying a big cool hand on the invalid's forehead. Tempeston did not seem to hear the question. He was looking straight before him then, apparently lost in a sudden train of thought At length he started, as though he had come to some fixed purpose, and said hurriedly to the doctor, \u2014 ' Am I very ill ? ' 'Almost Avell,' Avas the reply. ' What has been the matter Avith me?' ' You broke a small blood-vessel on the chest ; nothing very serious. You'll be all right in a day or two.' ' Could I get up and \u2014 and run ?

' How far could I walk ? ' ' Bless the boy ! ' retorted the man of science ; ' I don't knoAv. Fellows in action have Avalked miles after losing four times the amount of blood you lost \u2014 fel lows only some few years older than you ; but it all depends upon circumstances. If you and I were soldiers, and had been beaten in battle, and .vere in full retreat, I daresay you would be able to get to W \u2014 r \u2014 t \u2014 r (the doctor named a market town some seven miles distant), ' whilst, situated as you are now, Avithout any real call, perhaps you would not be able to get to the end of the floAver-garden.' ' Thank you,' said the boy. ' Will you put out the light and all go away? I want to be alone. I think perhaps I might sleep.' ' Well, that is the very best thing you could possibly do,' replied the physician; 'but I don't know about all going away. You see you might Avant drink or ice in the night, so I think I shall get either your father or"], [299, "Gates Ajar. 295 this kind lady to sit with you. If you wish it, you can have the light put out.' ' I can't sleep if there's any one in the room. I can't sleep, and I must be left alone,' Tempeston made answer. The doctor looked thoughtful. ' Well,' he said after a bit, answering the questioning looks of Lord Grantown and Miss Emmett, ' he's almost recovered, and if the boy thinks he'll be quieter alone, I don't see Avhy he should not be left. Where's the bell ? ' ' There,' said Miss Emmett, ' but it rings down-stairs, and the servants all sleep above. My room, however, is next to this, and I should hear the schoolroom hand bell in a minute.' The governess left the apartment, and in a feAV moments returned with the required article, which she placed on a table beside the boy's bed. ' There !' exclaimed the doctor; ' I am not sure it's not the best arrangement in the end. After all, patients very often know Avhat will suit them best. Noav we can leave, and it will be better not to disturb him until"], [300, "Olga. 296 he rings. There's one o'clock striking now. I'll be over by about eight o'clock to-morrow morning, or, I should say rather, this morning, and if he can sleep quietly till then so much the better. Is there anything more, my boy? No. Well, we will go out now, and leave him.' The doctor nodded to his patient ; Miss Emmett kissed the lad ; and then Lord Grantown drew near the bed. ' Would you \u2014 do you want to speak to me, my child ? ' the latter Avhispered, as he bent down. ' Not now,' the boy answered, with a little shiver. ' I want to be quiet' Then the party left the room, and Tempeston Avas alone in the dark. One o'clock ! It Avas about five minutes past then. How long Avould it be before the others Avere in bed ? An hour ! In an hour's time, then, the house would be still. That Avould be two o'clock. How long Avould it take him to Avalk to Shirley ?

But he had allowed himself no time to dress, and also it would be useless to reach Shirley till five o'clock ; there would be no one up. So he must lie quiet till half-past two, and then he would rise and creep out of the house and away to Shirley. There he would see Lord Melton bury and tell him what he had done. Oh, God ! how had he repaid his kindness ! Their child, their only child left, and he \u2014 he had murdered her ! When he had told Lord Meltonbury, he would be given over to the police, and then in a little time they would hang him. Olga killed, and killed through him ! Olga, who had been so sweet and dear to him ! Olga, who had forgiven all his cruel treatment, even those last bitter words against her young dead brother. 'Won't you shake hands? I know you did not mean it. See, I'm not a bit cross.' The silvery voice Avas still upon his ear \u2014 a voice so full of forgiveness for his wicked conduct ! And he had refused ! He had gone away, and sent her to her death !"], [302, "Olga. 298 ' I cannot go by the raihvay ; Nelly might shy. I might be thrown. Oh, Tempest, open the gate !

He tossed from side to side upon his couch, his brain felt on fire, and his throat was parched and dry. What should he do ? He could do nothing. ' Thou shalt do no murder.' Hoav often, oh, how often, Sunday after Sunday, had he heard those words, and how little he had dreamed that it was a command he would one day be guilty of breaking ! He had thought it so beyond all possibility that such could ever be the case, that he had hardly taken the trouble to repeat, even Avith his lips, \u2014 much less Avith his heart, \u2014 the response the Church of England service gives, ' Incline our hearts to keep this law.' Lying there in the black, black darkness, in the solemn silence of the night, the old familiar Bible story \u2014 so often got up for divinity class at school\u2014 came"], [303, "Gates Ajar. 299 back to him. The clouds and thick darkness, the lightnings and thunder, the voice as of a trumpet exceeding loud, so that all that heard it trembled, the voice of the Lord Most High giving the great command, \u2014 ' Thou shalt do no murder.' Tempeston shuddered at the result of his anger and of the broken commandment, but, though he did so, it was only at intervals he could fully realize what had actually happened. He felt at other moments that it was impossible, and that Olga could not be dead. Two. The castle clock chimed the hour. It was pitch dark. It would be so for another three hours, but he could lie there no longer. He would rise and creep out of the house, and aAvay to Shirley. Once there, he could wait till the household were awake, and then he would go in, and, sending for Lord Meltonbury, tell him \u2014 tell him that it was he who had killed his only remaining child. Softly, very softly, the boy struck a light and crept out of bed. He leaned against a chair for a moment,"], [304, "Olga 300 for he Avas so weak he felt as if he must fall. He AA'as fearful, too, that, in the intense stillness Avhich reigned, Miss Emmett in her room might have caught the slight sound of the match igniting.

The cold water in which he dipped his face and hands refreshed him a little, but long ere he had finished dressing the perspiration Avas running doAvn his face, so weak and exhausted was the lad from loss of blood. At last all was finished. Tempeston glanced round the room for a farewell look. He Avould not see it again, he supposed. Lord Meltonbury Avould give him to the police when he had heard his tale. A pang of agony went through the boy's heart, as his eyes fell on the dressing-box which his kind friends had given him. It Avas Olga, he kne.v, Avho had suggested it to them ; because once he had happened to say, Avhen riding up St. James's Street, how jolly the bags and cases looked in Jenner and Knewstub's Avindow. Olga, whom he loved, oh, so dearly ! Olga, who had been killed through his mad anger !"], [305, "Gates Ajar. 301 Tempeston extinguished the light, gently opened the door, and stole out into the corridor. Very softly, for fear of waking any one, he crept along, passed Miss Emmett's door, passed Helen and Lina's rooms, \u2014 Avhat would they feel Avhen they should learn what he had done ? \u2014 and then he descended the stairs. The swing door into the hall opened Avithout noise, and he walked quickly across the great place, and, sliding back the bolts, opened the portal. He closed it gently after him, and, stepping out from under the portico, found himself in the open air, with the stars glittering brightly overhead. The fresh night air revived the boy for a minute, and he got a little way from the house without much difficulty ; but soon he began to shiver with cold. How strange it seemed to be walking along under the great trees, and how different the park looked from what it did in the day-time ! By the pale light of the rising moon he could see the stable clock, pointing to twenty minutes to three. In his present state he would not be at Shirley much before five. He didn't even know whether he should be there then, for already his"], [306, "Olga. 302 legs were trembling under him, and the great drops, in spite of his chilliness, Avere falling from his broAv. Just then he reached the spot Avhere the lane leading doAvn to the padlocked gates joined the drive. He shuddered Avith horror. It seemed as if he heard a voice still calling, ' Open the gate, Tempest ! ' Oh, Avould that it Avere so ! How he would run and unfasten it cling to the girl, praying for forgiveness, and she \u2014 she would give it, as she had ever done. Oh, Father in heaven, undo the evil ! Alas, alas ! how could it be undone ? 4 Olga was dead, killed by the horse being frightened at the engine ; and it was he who had sent her by that fatal road ! There was not a fragment of hope that it could be untrue. The very doctor who had seen her had pronounced her dead, and had come away because he could do nothing. But if Olga Avas dead, at least let it not be his fault, not be through his OAvn vile temper. Perhaps she might have chosen to have gone by that lane ! Pshaw ! how could that be ? ' Open the gate, Tempest. I cannot go by the rail way. Nelly might shy. I might be thrown.' There was no hope, no release, nothing ! Suddenly"], [307, "Gates Ajar. 303 there flashed to the boy's mind the remembrance of some of those quaint stories about answers to prayer which his father had so often related at Sunday evening devotions. Vague recollections of drowning men, in mid-ocean, calling to God for help, and being saved by a plank floating near ; or of travellers falling from a precipice, uttering a prayer, and being caught in a bush and drawn up alive, unhurt The ex-Eton boy had hitherto regarded such tales in a slightly sceptical way, and had listened with a half smile. It was not that he was an irreligious lad ; on the contrary,' he was rather the reverse. Unknown to any one, he always read his Bible daily, and he accepted much greater miracles without a doubt. His scepticism on this point was only, I fancy, because the tracts belonged to his father, and he knew, or thought he knew, that Lord Grantown never took the slightest trouble to find out if the stories therein contained were authentic. But that night in his extremity the boy did not feel inclined to smile. No help that any man could give would avail ; One, and One alone, could, if He chose, lend assistance. Tempeston glanced up at"], [308, "Olga. 304 the mighty host of stars above his head. Surely the Maker of them could do wonderful things ! He knelt down on the dripping grass and asked, in a few simple words, of the great Father of all that somehow he might be released, that a portion of his misery might be taken from him. Then he rose and resumed his Avalk. The echo of the stable clock striking three reached Tempeston's ears just as he had quietly opened the gate at the lodge, and stepped out on to the high road. He had thus two miles still before him to Shirley. It was a terrible journey, that, to the boy who a few hours before had broken a blood-vessel, and who toiled on with the knoAvledge of the tale he had to unfold to Lord Meltonbury at the end ! Several times he sank exhausted to the ground at the side of the road, and once or twice his mouth filled with blood. Just at five o'clock, when the first streak of daAvn appeared in the east, Tempeston arrived at the Avell-known lodge-gate. He recalled with agony how often he had ridden gaily through it when going over to pay a visit ; frequently the sole object of such visit being to see Olga, and ask"], [309, "Gales Ajar. 305 her advice as to what he ought to do in this or that case. He lifted the latch, shut the gate, and went quickly on up the drive. The grey light was increasing every moment, his journey was nearly over, his task about to begin. Faster and faster his heart beat, his brain seemed to whirl, and he thought for a moment that this Avas death. The lad leaned for support against a tree. The feeling passed away almost immediately, and he felt stronger again. He was sorry for that. He had suffered such agony for his sin, that surely God would have pardoned him had he died, and then there would have been an end to all his wretchedness. But it was not to be. He pulled himself together, and staggered, rather than walked, onward for a few paces, and then the house came in sight. The blinds .vere draAvn in all the windows ; the stillness of death was on the place. In one of those shut-up rooms Olga lay dead. The boy wondered vaguely which room it was. He felt as if he had hardly realized, till he saw that array of white blinds, that she was actually gone. Standing before the 20"], [310, "Olga. 306 mansion, Avith the hushed stillness all around him, he knew in very truth that she Avas dead. Could she see him, then, from her place among the angels, he Avon dered ? He didn't kno av ; all he was sure of was that she was noAv one of God's bright hosts. Tempeston had just thought this, Avhen one of the casements near him opened, a blind was thrust aside, and, Avith an agonizing pang at his heart, the boy beheld Lord Meltonbury. He never knew how he got there, but in another moment he Avas before the bereaved father, and had sunk exhausted on the ground at his feet. ' Tempest ! ' The Avord came in a tone of amazement. Lord Meltonbury had heard that the lad before him had broken a blood-vessel but a feAV hours ago, and Avas dangerously ill. He was naturally startled to see him there. He gazed in astonishment at the young figure, soiled with the dust of the road on which he had sunk down so often, and .vith the red blood dripping from his mouth. 'My child!' he exclaimed, as he lifted the half-"], [311, "'TEMPEST ! 307"], [312, ""], [313, "Gates Ajar. 309 fainting lad, and carried him back into the room ; ' how came you here ? ' ' I walked,' panted the boy. ' Don't touch me \u2014 keep away \u2014 I did it \u2014 I killed her ! ' To Lord Meltonbury the words Avere those of delirium. He forgot for a moment the agony of his own broken heart. 'Hush, hush!' he said; 'you are ill, dear child,' and again he sought to lift the boy from the crouching position into which he had sunk upon the floor. ' Don't,' exclaimed Tempeston, with a great shudder ; ' I am not mad. It is the truth I tell.' Lord Meltonbury gazed in astonishment at the speaker. The boy's blue eyes were open wide ; a look of horror was in them, but there was no delirium there. What did the lad mean ? ' Tempest,' he gasped, ' I do not understand. What is it you would say ? ' ' I did it,' moaned the lad. ' I killed her. It was I who sent her to her death ! Oh, Olga ! oh, darling Olga ! '"], [314, "Olga. 310 Something in the speaker's tone told Lord Melton bury that, whatever it was that was meant, the boy believed the truth of his OAvn Avords. It Avas clearly his duty to unravel the mystery, to find out if the dusty, blood-stained figure that lay prone at his feet could, by any possibility, have had a share in the terrible tragedy of the previous afternoon. 'Tell me,' he exclaimed sternly, 'what is it you mean ? Speak ! I order you.' The boy lifted his white face, and gazed at Lord Meltonbury. In the dim light of the room, behind the closed blinds, the lad saw how fearfully his kind friend had altered in one short night. He was dressed in a travelling suit, \u2014 the one he had been wearing for the journey on which he Avas about to start, when the awful news reached him. His hair, which formerly had been tinged Avith grey, had grown white ; and his beard Avas of the same hue. The features, too, Avere drawn and sharpened, while his whole attitude was that of a man stricken by a blow from which he would never recover. ' Speak ! ' he said once more ; ' I order you.'"], [315, "Gates Ajar. 3 1 1 ' It was the afternoon,' panted the boy. ' She came on Nelly, and folloAved me to the wood. I had done Avrong, and she Avanted me to be good, like Holme. I Avould not listen. I was angry, and shut and locked the gate upon her, and sent her back by the lane near the railway. Oh, if I were dead ! I Avish that I had died, oh, long ago ! ' He paused, wringing his hands and moaning. ' Go on,' gasped Lord Meltonbury ; ' what then ? Hoav Avas it your fault ? Speak ! ' ' That \u2014 that is all,' panted the lad. ' I lay on the ground in the wood for a long time. It Avas dark Avhen I came aAvay, and Avhen I reached the house they told me how the railway engine had frightened the horse, and she was killed. Oh, have mercy \u2014 God have pity ! ' Exhausted, half dead, the boy sank down upon the floor, from which he had risen to tell his tale, his eyes closed, his brain whirling. How long he lay thus he never knew. It may have been minutes, it may have been hours. He was roused at last by some one lifting him tenderly up, and in another moment he Avas lying"], [316, "Olga. 312 in Lord Meltonbury's arms, and the kind voice of the latter avhs speaking to him. 'My boy,' he said, 'it is all a mistake. Our darling Avas killed here, close to the house. It Avas the thrash ing - machine engine, Tempest, Avhich frightened the mare. The men got up steam soon after she had ridden away to see you. It was working near the stables. It's all a mistake.' The room whirled round Avith the boy, but still his senses did not quite leave him. ' And I have not done it after all ? ' he cried, in a shrill voice, Avhich sounded still shriller in the stillness of the early morning. ' I have not killed her ? I am not a murderer ? ' ' Thank God, no ! ' exclaimed Lord Meltonbury, holding the lad closer to himself. 'He heard my prayer!' the boy .vent on, his eyes looking straight before him, with an almost super natural light in them. ' I knelt upon the grass in the park \u2014 how wet the grass is in the early morning ! \u2014 I cried to Him to be released, and He has heard me, and forgiven. Oh, thank God \u2014 thank God ! '"], [317, "Gates Ajar. 313 The half delirious words startled Lord Meltonbury. ' Tempest,' he said, trying by a calm voice to recall the young fellow to himself, 'can you hear me? Can you understand a message if I give it to you ? ' ' A message ! ' repeated the lad stupidly ; ' a message from Avhom ? ' ' From our darling,' Lord Meltonbury replied. ' She did not die at once. They carried her into the hall, and she was sensible. You say that you were angry Avith her; well, this is her message: \"Tell Tempest not to mind. Tell him I am very sorry he was vexed. Ask him to be like Holme. Say good-bye for me to him, and tell him I'm not a bit cross.\" She said the last words twice, my boy, and then she gave a sort of little moan \u2014 and it was over.' Lord Meltonbury's voice trembled at the last words, and a deep sob issued from his breast; but, sincere as Tempeston's affection for him was, the lad neither heard nor noticed it. He lay still, lost almost in a transport of joy rather than sorrow. The terrible taint of murder was gone from him, and, deeply as he had sinned by Avild, passionate anger, still from the shed-"], [318, "Olga. 314 ding of blood he Avas free. In his thankfulness he could almost have shouted aloud. And, as though this release Avas not enough, there had come the message of pardon, of SAveet forgiveness, and of comfort from the dead ! 'Tell Tempest I am sorry he was vexed. Ask him to be like Holme. Say good-bye for me to him. Tell him not to mind.' This was the farewell message from the child to him, who, if he had done no real harm, had at least risked her life by sending her back by that dangerous road. And after that, even, she did not despair of him ! ' Tell him to be like Holme.' There was hope for him yet. It Avas not all too late, as he had thought. He Avanted to go and see Olga, and Avhisper to her that henceforth he Avould strive, with all his might, to do the things she Avished, and seek to Avalk in the steps of the dead young earl. ' Holme ahvays did Avhat Avas right,' the girl had said that summer day beneath the green trees in the water woods at Meltonbury. He, God helping, Avould do the same. ' Take me to her now,' the boy said slowly ; and"], [319, "Gates Ajar. 3 1 5 Lord Meltonbury arose without a Avord, and led the Avay. The glory of the early sunrise lightened all the room, and, stealing through the Venetian blinds, fell in bright rays upon the snow-white couch and the form that lay beneath the sheet. Gently, very gently, Lord Melton bury drew back the cover, and Tempeston, with a smothered cry, sank down beside the bed. It was Olga, Olga unchanged, Olga looking just as she did in life \u2014 only a thousand times more beautiful ! There was the little head, with the short curly golden locks, which the boy had admired so much, and about which he had been wont to teaze her. There were the trailing silky lashes, the rosy lips, the beautiful complexion, all just as in life \u2014 save that the soft grave eyes were closed to open never any more till the last great Easter dawn. ' Olga,' the boy Avhispercd, ' I want to tell you some thing, to tell you I am very sorry. I mean to grow like Holme, dear, and always try to do what you would like. You do forgive me, Olga darling, I know, because you sent to tell me so ; and oh, I thank you,"], [320, "Olga. 316 dear ! I'll try to be very good, Olga, and then perhaps, because I am so miserable, God will let me die soon, and Ave shall be together always, dear, you and I.

I wanted so to see you once again, dear ; and oh, please give my love to Holme ! for, though I didn't really know him, still I seem to do so through you. I think she Avill like me to send my love to Holme?' he added, looking up at Lord Meltonbury half-inquiringly. The tall figure signed, as though he, too, had thought the same. ' I don't want to leave you, Olga,' the boy Avent on, turning back toAvards the still, quiet face, on which God's angels had draAvn the sweetest smile, 'but I am ill. I will come back soon, only now my eyes are heavy, and I want to sleep. Good-bye, darling ! I may kiss her, may I not ?

Two years have passed aAvay since the events recorded, and changes have come to the inhabitants of Grantown Castle. Helen is married, and liAres happily at Salisbury, in the cathedral close, with her husband, a talented and wealthy canon, but Lina is still under kind Miss Emmett's charge. The governess's hair is grey now, and she grows daily more beloved and esteemed by all at the Castle. The master of the house is Avell. He is yet stern looking at first sight ; but after a minute's con versation the stranger notes a kindly light of interest in the piercing glance. He gives largely in charity from his not too ample rent-roll, and he is regarded as the best landlord in all Dorsetshire. He has still his own peculiar theories as to religion, but he is no longer a bigot, and he seeks to bring his schemes for the general welfare more into accordance with the spirit of the age. He is always to be seen in the Upper House whenever a debate of either an eccle-"], [322, "318 Olga siastical or philanthropic character is down for discussion, but Avhen it is over he troubles but little about the vieAvs of those who have differed from him. Lord Grantown may be said to live in and for his children. Long ago Tempeston told him the story of the padlocked gate, Avhile his arm Avas round the boy's neck, and Avhen the tale Avas finished, the father, in a broken voice, gave thanks to his Maker in that He had dealt gently Avith his son. It Avas long before the boy recovered the shock of that terrible night, when he had believed himself the cause of his beloved young friend's death, but gradually youth reasserted itself, and he is now as strong and well as ever. There is a new tutor, Avith whom he is on the best of terms, and who, the moment that work is over, is ready to enter fully into all the boy's sports and amusements. As to his father, Tempeston is deeply attached to him, and it is Lord Grantown's especial delight to map out a career for his son's future, and to instil into him what the duties of his position will require of him hereafter. Tempeston, as may be imagined, spends a consider-"], [323, "Gates Ajar. 3 1 9 able part of each year at Meltonbury, where the marquis and his wife now live, and where, in the family vault, lie both their children. He is literally as a son to both of them, and they thus fulfil Olga's dying request, \u2014 ' Take care of Tempest.' Any career that the boy chooses will be open to him, since, though Meltonbury House, title, and rent-roll, all, of course, pass to the heir-at-law, a distant cousin in India, Shirley Park, Avhich is not entailed, and all else that Lord Meltonbury can leave, will descend to Viscount Tempeston, only son and heir of the Earl of Grantown. But though thus restored to health, and looking forward eagerly to life, its duties and its pleasures, I should be wrong to say there was no change in Tempeston. Never, since the afternoon of the terrible tragedy at Shirley, has an angry word been known to pass his lips ; daily his smile grows s .A'eeter, his patience greater. The transformation was not com pleted without a severe struggle, but the story of young Lord Holme's life, so often put before him by Olga, has borne full harvest at last.

He is full of health and spirits ; but at times, as he thinks of the child's sweet face, and the recollection of the great grey eyes comes back to him, a shadow steals across his brow. And often of a summer's Sabbath afternoon, in the quaint village church, when the old clergyman waxes eloquent as he tells of the Land whither we are all bound, Tempeston thinks of how, when the fashion of this world shall have passed away, he shall see the golden gates roll back, and there, in the splendour of the everlasting morn, once more behold Olga, and see Holme standing by her side. And then, when words of joyous welcome have greeted him, they three shall pass along the streets of gold, and hear the white-robed harpers sing their Avondrous song, until at length his eyes shall see the sight that crowns the triumph \u2014 'The King in His beaut)-.'
