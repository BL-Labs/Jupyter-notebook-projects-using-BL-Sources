In afhortTime Itracd him out; and -when I had found him, he appear' 'd fuch a Pofitive, Dogmatical Spark, that I began to repent of my 1 rouble, in fearching after him. It was my Misfortune, over a Pa of Beer, to begin a film- 1 Difccurfe of the Modern Poets and Actors ; and immediate ly he fell into a great Paffion, and fwore, 'That there were \u2022very few Perfons noiu Living, which defevvd the Name of a good Dramatick Poet, or a Natural Adtor ; and declaim d againft the prefent PraBice of the Englifh Stage with much Violence, faying, he believd the two Companies were joind in a Confederacy againft Smithfield, and refolvd to ruin their Fair, by out-doing them in their Bumbaflick Bills, and ridiculous reprefenting their Plays ; adding, \"That he hoped ere long 'Mr. Collier, and others, woud write them down to the Devil.

When next I faro the Gentleman, my Friend, who recom mended him to me, I told him how I was entertain d by his Cynical Acquaintance. He laugh'd, hut bid m$ not be difi courag'd; faying, that Et of Railing woud foon have been ever ; and when his juft Indignation had fpe'nt it felf, you plight have imparted your Buftnefs to him', and receiv'd a more fatisfaBory Account.

I follow' d my Friend's Directions, and found the Event anfuerable to his Prediction. Not long after, I met him 'in Fleet-ftreet, and carry 'd him to the Old Devil; and ire we had empty' d One Bottle, I found him of a quite different Humour, from what I left him in the Time before : He appear d in his Difcourfe to be a very Honeft true En glim-Man ; a hearty Lover of his Country, and the Government thereof, both in Church and State ; a Loyal Subject to his Sovereign; an Enemy to Popery and Ty ranny, Idolatry and Superftition , Antimonarchical Go- vernment and Confufion; Trrehgion and Enthufiafm. ft Jhort, I found him a Perfon of a competent Knowledge in the Affair I went to him about, and one who underflood the Eng' lifh Stage very well; and tho fomewhat Pofitive ; as If aid before, yet I cbfervd, he always took Care to have Truth on his Side, before hs Affinnd, or deny'd any Thing with more than ordinary Heat ; and when he was fo guarded, he was Immoveable. When I had difcover d thus much, and calfd for the Se cond Bottle, I told him from whom I came, and the Caufe"], [9, "to the Reader. V of my Addr effing to him. He deftr'd my Patience 'till he ftept to his Lodgings, which were near the \"Tavern ; and after a port Space he return 'd, and brought with him the Papers, which contain the following Notes. When he had read them to me, 1 lik'd them fo well, that I defii'd the Printing of them, provided they were Genuine ; he ajfur'd me they were, and told me farther ; That, while this Farce was compofing, and Altering, he had frequent Occafions of being with the Author, of perufing his Papers, and hearing him difcourfe of the feveral Plays he expos' d, and their Authors .- Infomuch, that few Perfons had the like Opportunities of knowing his true Meaning, as he him felf had. If any other Perfons had known the Author s Mind fo ex- actly, in all the feveral Particulars, 'tis more than probable, they wou'd have been made Publick before now ; but nothing of this Nature having appear d thefe Two and Thirty Tears ; (for fo long has* this Farce ftourijh'd in Print ) we may reafonably and fafely conclude, that there is no other fuch like Copy in being ; and that thefe Remarks are Genuine, and taken from the great Perfon' s own Mouth and Papers. I was very well fatisjfd with this Account, and more de finus to Print it than ever ; only I told him, I thought it wou'd be very advantageous to the Sale of thefe Annotations, to have a Preface to them, under the Name of him, who was fo well acquainted with the Author ; bu t could not, by all the Arguments I was Mafter of, obtain his Confent ; tho' we de- bated the Point a pretty while. He aHedg'dfor his Excufe, that fuch an Undertaking would be very improper for him, becaufe he pould be forc'd to name feveral Perfons, and fome of great Families, to whom he had \u25a0been cbligd ; and he was very unwilling to offend any Perfon of Quality, or run the Hazard of making fuch who are or may be his Friends, become his Enemies ; tho' he fhon d only .act the Part of an Hiftorian, barely reciting the Words he heard from our Author.

To tell tljee, what all Perfons, who are any. Thing ac quainted with tlx Stage, knozu already ; vi z. That this Farce \u2022am wrote by the mojl Noble George Villiers, late Dale of Buckingham, &c. a Perfon of a great Deal of Natural H^it and Ingenuity, and of excellent Judgment, particularly in Matters of this Nature; his forward Genius was improv d by a Liberal Education, and'the Converfation of the greatefl Perfons in his Time : And all thefe cultivated and improv d by Study and Travel. By the former, he became well acquainted with the Writings of the moft Celebrated Poets of the late Age; viz. Shakefpear, Beaumont, and Johnfon, (the lafl of whom he knew Per- Jcnaliy, being thirteen Tears old when he dy'd) as alfo with the Famous Company of ABors at Black-Fryars, whom he al ways -admird. He was likewife very intimate -with the Poets cf his Time, as Sir John Denham, Sir John Suckling, the Lord Falkland, Mr. Sidney Godolphin, (a near Relation to the late Lora1 High Treafmer of England, the Glory of that Ancient Family) Mr. Waller, and Mr. Cowley j on the lafl of whom he beflow'd a Gentile Annuity during his Life ; and a Noble Monument in Weftminfter-Abbey after his Deceafe,. By"], [11, "to the Reader. VII By Travel he had the Opportunity of obferving the Decorum of Foreign-T/;(?rtrw, efpecially the French, under the Regulation of Monfieur Corneille, before it was fo far Italianated, and over-run with Opera and Farce, as now it is; and before the Venom thereof had crofs'd the narrow Seas, and poyfoned the Engliih-^V^; we being naturally prone to Imitate the French in their Fajhions, Manners, and Cuftoms, let 'em be never fa Vitiopn, Fantaftick, or Ridiculous. By what has been faid on this Head, I hope thou an fully fatisfyd who was- the Author of this Piece, which the Learned and Judicious \u00a3>. Burnet (lateBipopof Sarum) callsaCot- rection, and an Unmerciful Expofing; and I believe, thou haft as little Caufe to doubt of his being able to perform it. Had this Great Perfon been indued with Conftancy and Steadinefs of Mind, equal to his other Abilities, both Natural and Acquird, he had been the moft Compleat Gentleman in his Time. I pall proceed, to pow, 2. The Motives which indue d him to undertaken. The Civil-War filene'd the Stage for almoft TwentyTears, tho' not near fo Lewd then, as it is fince grown ; and it had been happy for England, if this had been the worft EffeBofthat War. The many Changes of Government, that fucceeded the Diffo lution of the Ancient Conftitution, made the People very Un eafy, and unanimoufly Deftrom of its Reftitution ; which was epeBed by a Free Parliament, in the Tear 1666. This fudden Revolution, which is heft known by the Name of the Reftauration, brougln with it many ill Cuftoms, from the feveral Countries, to which the King and the Ca valiers were retir'd, during their Exile, which prov d very pernicious to our Englifh Conftitution, by Corrupting our Morals ; and to which the Reviving the Stage, and bringing Women on't, and Encouraging and Applauding the many Lewd, Senfelefs, 'and Unnatural Plays, that enfu'd upon this great Change, did very much Contribute. Then appear d fuch Plays as thefe, The Siege of Rhodes, Part 1. ABed at the Cock-Pit, before the Reftauration ; The Play-Houfe to be Lett ; The Slighted Maid; The United King-"], [12, "The ru Dinner VIII rent Kingdoms ; The Wild Gallant ; The Englifh Monlieur ; The Villain ; and the like. v . Tou wiU meet with feveral Paffages out of aU thefe, except the United Kingdoms, (which was never Printed) in the following Notes; as you will find out of feveral other Plays, which are\" here omitted. Our moft noble Author, to manifefl his jufl Indignation and Hatred of this Fulfom new Way of Writing, us'd his ut moft Interefl and Endeavours toftifle it at its fir ft Appearing on the Stage, by Engaging all his Friends to Explode, and Run down thefe Plays, efpecialiy the United Kingdoms ; which had like to have brought his Life in Danger. The Author of it being Nobly born, of an Ancient and Nume ropii Family, had many of his Relations and Friends in the Cock- Pit, during the ABing it ; fome of 'em perceiving his Grace to head a Party, who were very aBive in Damning tlx Play, by Hijfing and Laughing immoderately at the flrange ConduB there of; there were Perfons laid wait for him as he came out; but there being a great Tumult and Uproar in the Houfe, and the Paffages near it, he efcapd: But he was threaten 'dhard; how ever, the Bufinefs was compos' d in a port Time, tho by what Means I have not been inform' d. After this, our Author endeavour'd by Writing, to expofe the Follies of thefe New-faftiond Plays in their proper Colours, and to fet them in fo clear a Light, that the People might be able to difcover what Trafh it was, of which they were fo fond; tp he plainly hints in the Prologue ; and fo Jet himfelf to the Compofing of this Farce. When his Grace began it, I cou'd never learn, nor 'is it very material. Thni much we may certainly gather from the Editions of the Plays refteBed on in it, that it was before the End of 1663, and finip'd before the End of 1664; becaufe it had been fever at Times Rehears'd, the Players were perfect in their Parts, and all Things in Readinefs for its ABing, before the Great Plague in 166$ ; and that then preventedit. But what was fo ready for the Stage, andfo near being ABed, at the Breaking out of that Terrible Sicknefs, was very diffe-"], [13, "to the Reader. IX tent from what you have fince feen in Print. In that he call'd his Poet Bilboa ; by which Name the Town generally underflood Sir Robert Howard to be the Perfon pointed at ; befides there were very few of this new Sort of Plays then extant, except thefe bef ore-mention d, at that Time ; and more than were in Being coud not be Ridicul'd. The ABing of this Farce being .thm hinder d, it was laid by for feveral Tears, and came not on the Publick Theatre 3 till the Tear \\6ji. During this Interval many great Plays came forth, writ in Heroick Rhyme ; and on the Death of SirWilliam D'Avenant, 1669, Mr. Dryden, a new Laureat, appear d on the Stage, much admird, and highly Applauded; which movd the Duke to change the Name of his Poet from Bilboa, to Bayes, whofe Works you will find often mention d in the following Key.
