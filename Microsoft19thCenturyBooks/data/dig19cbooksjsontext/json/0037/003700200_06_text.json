He obeyed, and found the regent and Secretary Lethington sitting together ; upon which he conveyed to them, \" in as earnest and vehement a form as he could set it forth,\" the queen his mistress's severe disapproval of their recent conduct. To this remonstrance Maitland made a bold reply. He renounced, for himself and his col leagues, all intention of harm to the person and honour of his royal mistress in their late proceedings. \" So far from it,\" said he, \"Mr Ambassador, that we wish her to be queen of all the world ; but now she is in the state of a person in the delirium of a fever, who refuses every thing which may do her good, and requires all that VOL. VI. B"], [24, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1567. 18 may work her harm. Be assured nothing will be more prejudicial to her interest, than for your mistress to precipitate matters. It may drive us to a strait, and compel us to measures we would gladly avoid. Hitherto have we been content to be charged with grievous and infamous titles ; we have quietly suffered ourselves to be condemned as perjured rebels and unnatural traitors, rather than proceed to any thing that might touch our sovereign's honour. But beware, we beseech you, that your mistress, by her continual threats and defama tions, by hostility, or by soliciting other princes to attack us, do not push us beyond endurance. Think not we will lose our lives, forfeit our lands, and be challenged as rebels throughout the world, when we have the means to justify ourselves. And if there be no remedy but your mistress will have war, sorry though we be, far rather will we take our fortune, than put our queen to liberty in her present mood, resolved as she is to retain and defend Bothwell, to hazard the life of her son, to peril the realm, and to overthrow her nobility.1 \" For your wars,\" he continued, \" we know them well : you will burn our borders, and we shall burn yours ; if you invade us, we do not dread it, and are sure of France ; for your practices to nourish dissen sion amongst us, we have an eye upon them all. The Hamiltons will take your money, laugh you to scorn, and side with us. At this moment we have the offer of an agreement with them in our hands. The queen, your mistress, declares she wishes not only for our sovereign's liberty, and her restoration to her dignity, but is equally zealous for the preservation of the king, the punishment of the murder, and the safety of the 1 Throckmorton to Elizabeth, Aug. 22, 1567. Keith, p. 448."], [25, "1567. REGENCY OF MORAY. 19 lords. To accomplish the first, our queen's liberty, much has been done ; for the rest, absolutely nothing. Why does not her majesty fit out some ships of war, to apprehend Bothwell, and pay a thousand soldiers to reduce the forts and protect the king ? When this is in hand, we shall think her sincere ; but for her charge to set our sovereign forthwith at liberty, and restore her to her dignity, it is enough to reply to such strange language, that we are the subjects of another prince, and know not the queen's majesty for our sove reign.\" l As soon as Lethington had concluded, Throckmorton, turning to Moray, expressed a hope that such senti ments would at least not meet his approval. He was not \"banded\" with these lords, he had committed none of their excesses. But Moray was now secure ; he had little to fear from Elizabeth, nothing from France, and his answer was as decided, though more laconic tban the secretary's. \" Truly, my lord ambassador,\" said he, \" methinks you have had reason at tie Laird of Lethington's hands. It is true, that I have not been at the past doings of these lords, yet I must commend what they have done ; and seeing the queen my sove reign and they have laid on me the charge of the regency, a burden I would gladly have avoided, I am resolved to maintain their action, and will reduce all men to obedience in the king's name, or it shall cost me my life.\" 2 The ambassador had been long aware that his further stay in Scotland would be totally useless. He had earnestly solicited his recall ; and Elizabeth now agreed to it, but ordered him first to make a last remonstrance 1 Throckmorton to Elizabeth, August 22, 15G7, printed by Keith, p. 448, from original, Caligula, C. i. sol. xxxii. 2 Ibid, tit supra."], [26, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1567. 20 in favour of the captive queen, and to request to be admitted to her presence. This, as he had looked for, was peremptorily refused by Moray : they had ex cluded De Lignerolles, the French ambassador, he said, who had so lately left them ; aud it was impossible to admit him. For the rest of his message from the Queen of England, the regent, after his usual fashion, replied to it with great brevity. As to his acceptance of the government, the deed was done ; for calumny he cared little, and would use none other defence than a good conscience and a sincere intention ; to satisfy the queen that his mistress had consented, he could only say, that he had her own word and signature ; for her liberty, its being granted depended upon accidents ; and as to her condition after Bothwell's apprehension, it would be idle, he said, to bargain for the bear's skin before they had him. The ambassador, before he took his leave, was pressed to accept a present of plate in the name of the king. This was declined in strong terms, and on the 29th of August he left the capital for England. Moray now addressed himself with characteristic de cision and courage to the cares of government ; and, to use Throckmorton's expressive phrase, \" went stoutly to work, resolved rather to imitate those who had led the people of Israel, than any captains of that age.\" 1 He instantly despatched the Laird of Grange, and Murray of Tullibardine, with three armed ships, in pur suit of Bothwell, who, after lurking in the north, and in vain attempting to make a party in these remote districts, had fled to Orkney and turned pirate.2 1 Throckmorton to Cecil, August 20, 1567, in Stevenson's Selections p. 282. \" ' 3 Ibid.

REGENCY OF MORAY. 21 He next employed the most vigorous measures to compel the whole kingdom to acknowledge the king's government, to secure himself against attack if Eliza beth should meditate it, and to keep up pacific relations with France, which, from the tone all along assumed byDe Lignerolles,he was assured would not be difficult. The Hamiltons had made some feeble attempts to pre vent the regent being proclaimed within their bounds ; but they acted with no fixed plan, had no leader of ability, and gave him little anxiety.1 A large proportion of the nobles, who had hitherto been hostile or neutral, now sent in their adherence to his government ; and Sir James Balfour, the governor of the castle of Edinburgh, delivered that fortress into his hands. This infamous man was the intimate friend of Bothwell, and a principal actor in the king's murder. It might have been expected that Moray, who had lately expressed so much horror for that deed, and so determined a resolution to avenge it, would have been the last to overlook the crime in one of the principal conspirators ; but, like other ambitious men,' he could make his conscience give way to his interest, as the treaty in question completely proved. Its first stipu lation was, that Balfour should have an ample remission as an accomplice in the murder ; the next, that before he gave up the keys of the castle, five thousand pounds should be paid down ; the last, that he himself should have the priory of Pittenweem, and his son an annuity. All this was agreed to, apparently without difficulty; and only two days after his assuming the regency, Moray in person took possession of the castle.2 1 Throckmorton to the queen, August 23, 1567, Stevenson's Selections, p. 291. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Throckmorton to Cecil, August 26, 1567. Historie of James the Sext, p. 18."], [28, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1567. 22 As if to cover the shame of this transaction, the regent made unusual exertions to seize some of the inferior delinquents. Previous to his arrival in Scot land, Captain Blacater had been taken and executed : he now apprehended John Hay of Tallo, a page of the king's called Durham, black John Spens, John Bla cater, and James Edmonson.1 The guilt of Tallo, as a principal agent in the murder, was completely proved ; but his examination threw Moray into great perplexity, for, to use Bedford's words to Cecil, he not only \" opened the whole device of the murder,\" but \"declared who were the executioners of the same, and went so far as to touch a great many, not of the smallest.\"3 We have already seen that Lethington, Morton, and Argyle, three of the most powerful men in Scotland, were either accomplices in the assassination or consenting to its perpetration ; and there can be no doubt that they, amongst others, were implicated in Tallo's confession. But in what manner was Moray to proceed ? It was these very men who had placed him in the regency ; with them he now acted famili arly and confidentially : their cause could not with safety be separated from his own. He might, indeed, attempt to seize and punish them ; but such was their strength, that it would be at the risk of being plucked down from his high office by the same hands which had built him up. The truth, however, probably was, that Moray had been long aware of the true character of the persons by whose successful guilt he now pro fited, and had determined to favour the higher culprits, whilst he let loose the vengeance of the law upon the lesser delinquents. He could not prevent the people, MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C. Bedford to Cecil, September 5, 1567. And same to same, September 11, 1567. 2 Ibid. September 16, 1567."], [29, "1567. REGENCY OF MORAY. 23 however, and all the more honest part of the nation, from arraigning such interested conduct ; but he little heeded these murmurs ; and for the present Hay's exa mination was suppressed, and his trial indefinitely postponed : Durham the king's page also was kept in prison in irons.1 The regent now summoned the castle of Dunbar, which was still held for Bothwell by one of his retainers. Its governor affected to resist, but Moray bombarded it in person, and in a few days the garrison capitulated. A last effort of the Hamiltons to get up a resistance was only made to be abandoned; Argyle, who had encouraged it, submitted, bringing with him Boyd, Livingston, and the Abbot of Kilwinning. This last person was deputed by the Archbishop of St Andrews, the leader of the Hamiltons, to make his peace; Huntley and Herries, much about the same time, gave in their adherence to the king's government ; and the regent on the 15th of September, informed his friend Cecil, that the whole realm was quiet.2 In the midst of these transactions, Grange returned unsuccessful from his pursuit of Bothwell. He had boasted to Bedford, that he would either bring back the murderer or lose his life in the attempt ; but, in giving chase, Grange's ship, one of the largest in the Scottish navy, struck upon a sand-bank, and although he boarded and brought home with him one of Both well's vessels, the earl himself, in a lighter craft, escaped to Norway. In one respect the expedition was impor tant, as Hepburn of Bolton, an accomplice in the king's murder, was seized in the ship, and by his confession, 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, September 17, 1567, Occurrents out of Scotland. 3 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

For the present, however, his revelations were not suffered to be known.1 Moray now summoned a parliament, (December 15th,) the proceedings of which evince the new regent's complete connexion and sympathy with the party of the reformed church, and demand especial attention. It has been asserted that it was thinly attended ; but the remark can only apply to the bishops, who represented the ecclesiastical estate, of whom but four appeared, Moray, Galloway, Orkney, and Brechin. There were present, however, fourteen abbots, twelve earls, sixteen lords and masters, the name given to lords' eldest sons, and twenty-seven commissioners of burghs. 2 The discussions were opened in a speech by Lethington, of which a copy still remains in his own handwriting ; and it were to be wished that its truth and sincerity had been equal to its talent. He alluded to the vast im portance of the crisis in which they met, and the sub jects upon which they were about to legislate, any one of which would, he said, have been enough to have occupied a parliament. These were, the establishing a uniform religion ; the acknowledgment of the just authority of the king, in consequence of the queen's free demission of the crown in his favour ; the sanction to be given to the appointment of a regent chosen to act in the king's minority ; the reuniting the minds of the nobility ; the punishment of the cruel murder of the late king, their sovereign's father ; and many other disorders requiring the grave consideration of their lordships. Upon these heads, he said, he would not 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, 11th September, 1567. Moray to Cecil. Also, Melvil's Memoirs, p. 186. Also, 16th September, MS. letter, B.C.

REGENCY OF MORAY. 25 dilate ; but two points he must not omit, both tending to their great comfort, and calling for deep gratitude. The first was, the success which, in matters of religion, had followed such comparatively small beginnings ; the second, their happy fortune in having in the regent a nobleman so excellently qualified to carry their ordinances into execution, whether they related to the church or the commonwealth. \" As to religion,\" said he, \" the quietness you presently enjoy, declares sufficiently the victory that God by his Word has obtained among you, within the space of eight or nine years ; how feeble the foundation was in the eyes of men, how unlikely it was to rise so suddenly to so large and huge a greatness, with what calmness the work has proceeded, not one of you is ignorant. Iron has not been heard within the house of the Lord ; that is to say, the whole has been builded, set up, and erected to this greatness, without bloodshed. Note it, I pray you, as a singular testimony of God's favour, and a peculiar benefit granted only to the realm of Scotland, not as the most worthy, but chosen out by his providence from among all nations, for causes hid and unknown to us, and to foreshow his almighty power, that the true religion has obtained a free course universally throughout the whole realm, and yet not a Scotsman's blood shed in the forthsetting of the whole quarrel. With what nation in the earth has God dealt so mercifully ? Consider the progress of religion from time to time in other countries \u2014 Germany, Denmark, England, France, Flanders, or where you please : you shall find the lives of many thousands spent before they could purchase the tenth part of that liberty whereunto we have attained, as it were sleeping upon down beds.\" x 1 MS.

When we recollect the events of the few last years \u2014 the rising of Moray against the queen's marriage, the murder of Riccio, the flight of Morton, the assassi nation of Darnley, the confederacy against Bothwell, and the imprisonment of the queen, all of them events more or less connected with the establishment of the Reformation in Scotland \u2014 and remember also that Lethington was deeply engaged in them all, it is certainly difficult which most to condemn, the gross inaccuracy of this picture, or the hardihood evinced by its coming from his lips. But to return to the proceedings of the parliament. The committee of the lords of the articles having been chosen,2 the three estates sanctioned the queen's demission of the crown, the king's coronation, and the appointment of Moray to the regency. The pope's authority was next abolished, the act to that effect, passed in the disputed parliament of 1560, being solemnly ratified. All laws repugnant to the Word of God were annulled ; and the \" Confession of Faith,\" which had been already read and approved of in a former parliament, was sanctioned and published. All heretics and hearers of mass were made liable to punishment ; confiscation of moveables being declared the penalty for the first offence, banishment for the second, and death for the third. Such persons as opposed the Confession of Faith, or refused to receive the sacraments after the Presbyterian form, were declared to be no members of the church of Christ. at the parliament of Scotland, December 1567, in Lethino-ton's own hand. 2 It was composed of the Bishops of Moray, Galloway, and Orkney ; the Abbots of Dunfermline, Melrose, Newbottle, Balmerino, St Colm's Inch, Pittenweem, and Portmoak ; the Earls of Huntley, Argyle, Morton, Athole, Glencairn, Mar, and Caithness ; the Lords Hume' Lindsay, and Sempil ; with the Provosts of Edinburgh, Dundee Mon trose, Aberdeen, St Andrews, Cupar, Stirling, and Ayr."], [33, "1567. REGENCY OF MORAY. 27 The examination and admission of ministers was de clared a prerogative inherent in the church ; but to lay patrons was continued the power of presentation, with an appeal to the General Assembly, if their nomination of a qualified person was not sustained by the superintendents and ministers ; and, lastly, all kings, at their coronation, or princes or magistrates acting in their place, were bound to take the oath for the support of the true church, and the extirpation of heresy.1 So far every thing succeeded to the wishes of the reformed clergy ; but their endeavour to repossess themselves of the patrimony of the church was not so fortunate. They pleaded a former promise to this effect ; and, if we may credit Bishop Spottiswood, the regent showed an anxiety to fulfil it ; but the laymen, who had violently seized the property of the church when it was in the hands of the Roman Catholic clergy, manifested the same violence now that their own ministers proposed to resume possession, and, with difficulty, consented to restore to them a third of the benefices.2 It was next ordered that a refor mation should be made in all schools, colleges, and universities, and that no teachers were to be admitted but such as had been examined and approved by the appointed visiters and superintendents; and, lastly, that, as far as concerned the preaching of the Word, the reformation of manners, and the administration of the sacraments, no other ecclesiastical powers should be acknowledged than those which were now claimed by the Presbyterian church, to which they gave the title of the Immaculate Spouse of Christ.3 1 Spottiswood, p. 214.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 28 A keen debate arose when the subject of the queen's imprisonment came before the Assembly, which was greatly divided in opinion. Many, who were con vinced of their sovereign's guilt, and who had adopted the views lately promulgated by the ministers in their pulpit addresses, contended that she should be brought to a public trial, and, if the crime was proved, punished by the laws like any other subject of the realm. To this it was objected, that the monarch was the source of all authority ; that she could not, without absurdity and contradiction, be made amenable to an inferior jurisdiction, but was accountable for her conduct to God alone. It was replied, that extraordinary crimes required extraordinary remedies ; but this doctrine was not generally acceptable. The discussion concluded in a resolution, that the imprisonment of the queen should be continued, and an act of parliament passed for the exoneration of those noblemen and barons who had risen in arms for the prosecution of the murder. The terms of this act, which were nearly similar to a previous resolution of the privy council, require a moment's notice, as it is in it that we find the first public mention of those letters of Mary to Bothwell, which, it was afterwards contended, completely proved her guilt. It declared the conduct and transactions of these lords, from the 10th of February (the day of Darnley's murder,) till the present time, to be lawful and loyal ; that they should never be subjected to any prosecution for what they had done ; because, if the queen were confined, it was solely in consequence of her own fault and demerit, seeing that, by several of her private letters, written wholly with her own hand, and sent by her to Bothwell, and by her ungodly and pretended marriage with him, it was most certain that she was cognizant, art and part, of the murder of"], [35, "1567. REGENCY OF MORAY. 29 the king her husband. This declaration of the estates having been signed and sealed, and ordered to be printed along with the other statutes, the parliament was dissolved.1 It appears by an act of privy council, dated the 16th September, 1568, that the Earl of Morton had at that time,2 delivered to the regent the little box or coffer, with the letters and sonnets which it con tained. It was to these letters that the act now quoted referred ; and the partial and unjust conduct of Moray and the parliament need hardly be pointed out. Such documents might or might not be originals ; but by every principle of justice, the queen ought not to have been condemned, nor should these letters have been received as evidence of the justice of that condem nation, until she had enjoyed in person, or by her counsel, an opportunity of examining the proofs pro duced against her. This injustice, however, was little in comparison with another proceeding of Moray's, who, having now tasted the sweets of absolute power, and being determined, at all hazard, to retain it, became little scrupulous of the means which he em ployed. Sir James Balfour, as we have seen, had been the confidant of Bothwell, and was the depositary of the bond or contract which was drawn up for the murder of the king.3 It had been seen by one of the accomplices in the murder, named Ormiston, who affirmed that Bothwell pointed out certain signatures, which he declared to be those of Argyle, Huntley, Lethington, and Balfour himself.4 This profligate 1 Goodal, vol. ii. pp. 62, 69.

In estimating his moral character, which has been highly extolled by some writers, it is instructive to mark in what way he appears to have proceeded. The letters alleged to be written by the queen were preserved, exhibited to the council, and quoted to the parliament as proofs of her guilt. Her jewels and other apparel were delivered up by Balfour J to Moray; but the \" bond \" which con nected his friends with the murder, was appropriated by Lethington, committed to the flames, and destroyed for ever. We learn this important fact, which is new in the controversy, from a letter addressed by Drury to Cecil, on the 28th of November, a short time before the meeting of the parliament. \" The writings,\" said he, \" which did comprehend the names and consents of the chief for the murdering of the king, is turned into ashes, the same not unknown to the queen ; and the same that concerns her part kept to be shown, which offends her.\" It is true there is here no asser tion that the regent himself threw the bond into the fire, and it was Lethington's and Balfour's interest, as it criminated themselves, to have it destroyed ; but that Moray consented to its destruction, whilst he preserved the evidence against the queen, the whole 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

REGENCY OF MORAY. 31 circumstances appear to me to demonstrate. Drury, in the same letter to Cecil, observed, \" that Moray made fair weather with Mary, and was dealing very soundly and uprightly.\" Sir William's ideas as to upright conduct, unless the expression was used solely with reference to the safety assured by the regent to his own associates, must have been peculiar. Of this partial dealing he now gave another signal instance, in the trial of those delinquents who were in custody for the king's murder. Their names were Hay of Tallo, John Hepburn of Bolton, George Dal gleish a page or chamberlain, and William Powrie a servant of Bothwell. It was well known at the time of his being apprehended, that Hay, the confident of Bothwell, had not only given a full detail of the murder, but had accused some of the highest nobility of being accomplices in it.1 It was equally notorious that Captain Cullen, who had been employed in his most secret concerns by the chief murderer, had revealed the whole circumstances,2 and that the lords and the regent must have been in possession of his confession. So general was the expectation of these disclosures being made public, that Sir William Drury, in writing to Cecil upon the subject, informed him that Tallo's life had been spared for a little only, until some of the great persons who were acquainted with the cruel deed were apprehended. All, therefore, looked with intense anxiety to the trial of these men; and it was confidently demanded, that as so much pains had been taken in the recent parliament to criminate the queen, the same 1 Bedford to Cecil, MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

But Moray had neither the power nor the will to make this exposure. The trials were shamefully hurried over. The culprits were arraigned, convicted, and executed in one day, (January 3.) Al though Hepburn of Bolton, in his speech on the scaffold, directly asserted that Argyle, Huntley, and Lethington. had subscribed to the bond for the murder, no arrest of these persons followed ; the judicial confessions which were made by him and his accomplices were suppressed at the time ; and, when subsequently brought forward to be exhibited in England, it was found that they had been manifestly tampered with, and contained evidence against no one but themselves and Bothwell.1 These proceedings told strongly against the regent ; and, making every allowance for the miserable state of the law in these times, it is impossible to exculpate him from the charge of having lent himself to a plan for the defeat of justice. Nor does it need any great dis cernment to discover both the means by which the truth was suppressed, and the motive for such base conduct. Argyle was lord justice-general, the head and fountain of the criminal jurisprudence of the coun try. By his deputy the trials were conducted, and Argyle was a principal accomplice in the king's mur der. The confessions Were made before the lords of the privy council, and amongst these lords were 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C. Drury to Cecil, January 4, 1567-8.

Lastly, Moray was regent of the realm ; but he had been placed in the high office by these very men, and his tenure was still so insecure, that a new coalition might have unseated him. Such conduct, although politic so far as his own greatness was concerned, disappointed the people, and was loudly condemned. Handbills and satirical poems, which upbraided his partiality, were fixed to the doors of the privy council and of his own house. Of these one was in the following pithy terms : \u2014 \" Qu\u0153ritur. \" Why John Hepburn, and John Hay of Tallo, are not compelled openly to declare the manner of the king's slaughter, and who consented thereunto?\"1 Another was a pasquinade, of which the truth was more striking than the poetry. It bore the title of a letter sent by Madde unto my Lord Regent and the whole estates, and strongly insinuated that Hay and Hepburn were about to be hurried out of life, and their confessions suppressed, lest they should discover the principal subscribers of the bond for the king's death.2 By his partial conduct, Moray not only estranged 1 MS.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 34 the people, but it was soon apparent that, notwith standing all his efforts, he could not long keep his party together. Even in the parliament, his legislation on the subject of religion had been condemned by Athole, Caithness, and the Bishop of Moray ; and the provision for the ministers of the church was an un popular measure with a majority of the lords. He had endeavoured, indeed, to secure the support of the chief nobility and barons by rewards and favours. Lething ton had received the sheriffship of Lothian, Hume that of Lauderdale, Morton the promise of the lord high admiral's place, vacant by the forfeiture of Bothwell ; Kirkaldy of Grange had been made governor of Edin burgh castle, and Huntley and Argyle were courted by the prospect held out to them of a matrimonial alliance with the regent's daughter and sister-in-law.1 But even these prizes and promises sometimes failed in their effect, every one being ready to magnify his own merit, and to anticipate a higher distinction than was bestowed. Nor did it escape observation, that his conduct since his elevation had become haughty and distant to those proud nobles who had so recently been his equals ; whilst he was open to flattery, and suffered inferior men to gain his confidence. Even the vigour with which he punished the riot and lawlessness of the border district failed to increase his popularity, the kingdom having been so long accustomed to a more relaxed rule, that justice was construed into tyranny. Owing to such causes, it was apparent that Moray's government, soon after the dissolution of parliament, was in a precarious state. The Hamiltons hated him ; to Lethington intrigue and change seemed to be the 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C. Berwick, Drury to Cecil, Jan. 4, 1567-8.

Since her interview with Moray, the captive queen had exerted all the powers of fascination, which she so remarkably possessed, to gain upon her keepers. The severe temper of the regent's mother, the lady of the castle, had yielded to their influence;3 and her son George Douglas, the younger brother of Lochleven, smitten by her beauty, and flattered by her caresses, enthusiastically devoted himself to her interest. It was even asserted that he had aspired to her hand, that his mother talked of a divorce from Bothwell, and that Mary,never insensible to admiration, and solicitous to secure his services, did not check his hopes.4 How ever this may be, Douglas for some time had bent his whole mind to the enterprise, and on one occasion, a little before this, had nearly succeeded ; but the queen, who had assumed the dress of a laundress, was detected 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

He communicated with Lord Seton and the Hamiltons ; he carried on a secret correspondence with the queen ; he secured the services of a page who waited on his mother, called Little Douglas, and by his assistance at length effected his purpose. On the evening of the 2d of May, this youth, in placing a plate before the castellan, con trived to drop his napkin over the key of the gate of the castle, which, for security, was always placed beside him when at supper, and carried it off unperceived ; he hastened to the queen, and hurrying down to the outer gate, they threw themselves into the little boat which lay there for the service of the garrison. At that mo ment Lord Seton and some of her friends were intently observing the castle from their concealment on a neigh bouring hill ; a party waited in the village below, while, nearer still, a man lay watching on the brink of the lake.2 They could see a female figure, with two attendants, glide swiftly from the outer gate. It was Mary herself, who, breathless with delight and anxiety, sprung into the boat, holding a little girl, one of her maidens, by the hand ; while the page, by lockino- the gate behind them, prevented immediate pursuit. In a moment her white veil, with its broad red fringe, (the concerted signal of success,) was seen glancing in the sun ; the sign was recognised and communicated ; the 1 Keith, p. 470. 2 Proofs and Illustrations, No. I. from the MSS. of Prince Labanoff; and letter of Kirkaldy to Lochleven, Morton MSS."], [43, "1568.

Throwing herself on horseback, she rode at full speed to the Ferry, crossed the Firth, and galloped to Niddry castle, having been met on the road by Lord Claud Hamilton, with fifty horse. Here she took a few hours' rest, wrote a hurried de spatch to France, despatched Hepburn of Riccarton to Dunbar, with the hope that the castle would be delivered to her, and commanded him to proceed afterwards to Denmark, and carry to his master, Bothwell, the news of her deliverance.1 Then, again taking horse, she galloped to Hamilton, where she deemed herself in safety. The news of her escape flew rapidly through the kingdom, and was received with joy by a large portion of her nobility, who crowded round her with devoted offers of homage and support. The Earls of Argyle, Cassillis, Eglinton, and Rothes ; the Lords Somerville, Yester, Livingston, Herries, Fleming, Ross, Borth wick, and many other barons of power and note, crowded to Hamilton. Orders were sent by them to put their vassals and followers in instant motion, and Mary soon saw herself at the head of six thousand men. She now assembled her council, declared to them that her demission of the government, and consent to the coronation of her son, had been extorted by the imminent fear of death, and appealed for the truth of 1 Proofs and Illustrations, No. I.

An act of council was then passed, declaring all the late proceedings, by which Moray had become regent, treasonable and of none effect ; and a bond drawn up by the nobility for the defence of their sovereign and her restitution to her crown and kingdom, which, in the enthusiasm of the moment, was signed by nine earls, nine bishops, eighteen lords, twelve abbots and priors, and nearly one hundred barons. But the queen, though encouraged by this burst of loyalty, felt a desire to avoid the misery of a civil contest, and in this spirit sent a message to Moray, with offers of reconciliation and forgiveness.1 The regent was in Glasgow, a city not eight miles from Mary's camp at Hamilton, engaged in public business, and attended only by the officers of the law and his personal suite, when almost at the same instant he received news of the queen's escape and her over tures for a negotiation. It was a trying crisis \u2014 one of those moments in the life of a public man which test his judgment and his courage. Already the intelli gence, though but a few hours old, had produced an unfavourable effect upon his party. Some openly deserted, and sought the queen's camp ; others silently stole away ; many wavered ; and not a few, whilst they preserved the show of fidelity, secretly made pre parations for joining the enemy. Under these difficult circumstances Moray exhibited that rapid decision and clearness of judgment which mark a great man. When counselled to retire, he instantly rejected the advice. \" Retreat,\" said he, 1 Keith, p. 475. Also, MS. letter, State-paper Office, 8th May, 1568.

It is cer tain ruin ; it will be construed into flight, and every hour's delay will strengthen the queen and discourage our adhereuts. Our only chance is in an instantaneous attack, before Huntley, Ogilvy, and the northern men, have joined the royal force.\" Pretending, however, to deliberate upon the offers of negotiation, he gained a brief respite : this he used to publish a proclamation, in which he declared his determination to support the king's government ; and sending information to the Merse, Lothian, and Stirlingshire, was rapidly joined by a considerable body of his friends. Morton, Glen cairn, Lennox, and Semple, lost no time, but mar shalled their strength and advanced by forced marches to Glasgow:1 Mar despatched reinforcements and cannon from Stirling ; Grange, whose veteran expe rience in military affairs was of infinite value at such a moment, took the command of the horse ; and Moray had the good sense to intrust to him the general arrangements for the approaching battle. Hume, also a skilful soldier, not only foiled Hepburn of Riccarton in his attempt to seize Dunbar for the queen,2 but kept the Merse men from declaring for her, and soon joined the regent with six hundred men, whilst Edinburgh beat up for recruits and sent a small force of hagbutters. The effects which so invariably follow decision and confidence were soon apparent, and in ten days Moray commanded an army of four thousand men.3 1 Drury to Cecil, May 7, 1568. Keith, p. 474.

In return, the English queen resolved to despatch Dr Leighton into Scotland with her warm congratulations, and an assurance, that if her sister would submit the decision of her affairs to his royal mistress, and abstain from calling in any foreign aid, she would speedily either persuade or compel her sub jects to acknowledge her authority.1 It happened, too, that shortly previous to her escape, Monsieur de Beau mont, an ambassador from Henry, had arrived from France to solicit, as he affirmed, an interview with the captive princess, which had been positively refused. Some suspected that he came to urge the expediency of a divorce from Bothwell, and a marriage between Mary and the Lord of Arbroath, second son of the Duke of Chastelherault. Others affirmed that, like De Lignerolles, his secret instructions were more favour able to the regent than the queen ; but, however this may be, he now resorted to the camp at Hamilton, and apparently exerted himself to procure a reconciliation between the two factions.2 We have already seen, that this was agreeable to Mary's own wishes. Her inclination from the first had been to avoid a battle, to retire to Dunbarton, a fortress which had been all along kept for her by Lord Fleming, and to regain by degrees her influence over her nobility and her people. In this wise and humane policy she was opposed by the ambition and fierce im patience of the Hamiltons, who, seeing themselves the strongest party, deemed the moment favourable to 1 MS.

REGENCY OF MORAY. 41 crush Moray for ever, and to obtain an ascendency over the queen and the government.1 So far, however, Mary's influence prevailed, that they consented to march from Hamilton to Dunbar ton ; and Moray, congratulating himself upon their resolution, immediately drew out his little army on the Burgh-muir of Glasgow, resolved to watch their movements, and, if possible, bring them to an engage ment. For this purpose Grange had previously exa mined the ground ; and the moment he became aware that the queen's army kept the south side of the river, the regent's camp being on the opposite bank, he mounted a hagbutter behind each of his horsemen, rapidly forded the Clyde, and placed them at the village of Langside, amongst some cottages, hedges, and little yards or gardens which skirted each side of a narrow lane, through which the queen's troops must defile.2 Whilst this man\u0153uvre was successfully performing, Moray, who led the main battle, and Morton, who commanded the vanguard or advance, crossed the river by a neighbouring bridge and drew up their men ; a movement which was scarcely completed when the queen's vanguard, two thousand strong, and commanded by Lord Claud Hamilton, attempting to carry the lane, was received by a close and deadly fire from the hagbutters in the hedges and cottage gardens. This killed many, drove them back, and threw their ranks into confusion ; but, confident in their numbers, they pressed forward up the steep of the hill, so that the men were already exhausted when they suddenly found themselves encountered by Moray's advance, which was well breathed, and in 1 Memoirs of James the Sext, p. 25.

Morton, who led it, with Hume, Ker of Cessford, and the barons of the Merse, all fought on foot ; and when the first charge took place, Grange's clear voice was heard above the din of battle, calling to them to keep their pikes shouldered till the enemy had levelled theirs, and then to push on.1 They obeyed him, and a severe conflict took place. It was here only that there was hard fighting ; and Sir James Melvil, who was present, describes the long pikes as so closely crossed and interlaced, that, when the soldiers behind discharged their pistols, and threw them or the staves of their shattered weapons iu the faces of their enemies, they never reached the ground, but remained lying on the spears.2 For some time the conflict was doubtful, till Grange, perceiving the right wing of the regent's advance (consisting of the Renfrewshire barons) beginning to give way, galloped to the main battle, and brought Lindsay, Lochleven, Sir James Balfour, and their followers, to reinforce the weak point. This they did effectually ; and their attack was so furious, that it broke the queen's ranks and threw all into confusion. Moray, who had hitherto stood on the defensive, con tenting himself with repulsing the enemy's cavalry, which was far superior in numbers and equipment to his own, now seized the moment to charge with the main battle, and the flight became universal.3 At this instant, too, the chief of the Macfarlanes, and two hundred of his highlanders, broke in upon the scattered fragments of the army with the leaps and 1 Melvil's Memoirs, p. 201.

This decisive battle lasted only three quar ters of an hour. On the queen's side there were but three hundred slain ; some accounts say only half that number.2 On the regent's only a single soldier fell. Ten pieces of brass cannon were taken, and many prisoners of note. Amongst the rest, the Lords Seton and Ross ; the masters, or eldest sons of the Earls of Eglinton and Cassillis ; the Sheriff of Ayr ; the Sheriff of Linlithgow, a Hamilton, who bore their standard in the vanguard ; the Lairds of Preston, In nerwick, Pitmilly, Balwearie, Boyne, and Trabrown ; Robert Melvil and Andrew Melvil ; two sons of the Bishop of St Andrews, and a son of the Abbot of Kilwinning. It was reported that Argyle was made prisoner, but purposely suffered to escape. On the regent's side, Hume, Ochiltree, and Andrew Car of Faudonside, were severely wounded.3 Previous to the conflict, Mary had taken her station upon an eminence half a mile distant, which commanded a view of the field. She was surrounded by a small suite, and watched the vicissitudes of the fight with breathless eagerness and hope. At last, when the charge of Moray took place, witnessing the total dispersion of her army, she fled in great terror and at full speed in the direction of Dumfries; nor did she venture to 1 MS.

It was a hasty and fatal resolution, adopted against the advice of those faithful servants who had followed her in her flight, and must have been dictated more by the terror of her own subjects, than by any well-grounded con fidence in the character of Elizabeth. Lord Herries, who accompanied her, had taken the precaution of writing to Lowther, the deputy-governor of Carlisle, desiring to know whether his royal mistress might come safely to that city ; but such was her impatience, that before any answer could be returned, she had taken a boat and passed over in her riding dress, and soiled with travel, to Workington,2 in Cumberland. Here she was recognised by the gentlemen of the country, who conveyed her to Cockermouth, from which Lowther conducted her with all respect and honour to Carlisle.3 Amongst her attendants were the Lords Herries, Fleming, and Livingston. While still at Workington, the Queen of Scots had written to Elizabeth, describing the wrongs she had endured from her rebellious subjects, alluding to the recent defeat at Langside, and expressing her confi dent hope that the queen would protect and assist her against her enemies. She concluded with these pathetic words : \" It is my earnest request that your 1 MS.

I have no other dress than that in which I escaped from the field ; my first day's ride was sixty miles across the country, and I have not since dared to travel except by night.\" x On receiving this letter, Elizabeth felt that Mary was at last in her power, and she did not hesitate to avail herself of the fatal error which had been com mitted. Her first orders to the sheriffs, on the 19th of May, sufficiently show this. She commanded them to treat the Scottish queen and her suite with honour and respect, but to keep a strict watch, and prevent all escape.2 At the same time, Lady Scrope, sister to the Duke of Norfolk, was sent to wait upon her, and Sir Francis Knollys arrived with letters of con dolence.3 But impatient under these formalities, and anxious for a personal interview, Mary addressed a second letter to Elizabeth, in which she entreated, that as her affairs were urgent, she might be per mitted instantly to see the queen, to vindicate herself from the false aspersions which had been cast upon her by her ungrateful subjects, and to dispel the doubts which she understood were entertained. She had sent up Lord Herries, she said, to communicate with her sister, and Lord Fleming to carry a message to France ; but she entreated, if any resolution had been formed against assisting her, (a decision which must surely come from others, not from Elizabeth's own heart,) leave might be given her as freely to 1 Anderson, vol. iv. pp. 29, 33.

Nothing could so much injure her cause as delay ; and already had she been detained in the state of a prisoner for fifteen days, a proceeding which, to speak frankly, she found somewhat hard and strange. In conclusion, she reminded Elizabeth of some circum stances connected with the ring which she now sent her. It bore the emblem of a heart, and had probably been a gift of the English queen. \" Remember,\" said she, \" I have kept my promise. I have sent you my heart in the ring, and now I have brought to you both heart and body, to knit more firmly the tie that binds us together.\"1 The offer in this letter to vindicate herself in person before Elizabeth, was earnestly pressed by Mary in her first interview with Scrope and Knollys. Her engag ing manner, and the spirit and eloquence with which she defended herself, made a deep impression on both. She openly declared, that Morton and Lethington were cognizant of the king her husband's murder ; and Knollys confessed, that although he began by accusing her of that dreadful crime, the sight of her tears soon transformed him into a comforter.2 Meanwhile, Moray lost no time in following up the advantage which he had gained ; and after the retreat of the queen, having made an expedition northward, at the head of a large force, and for the moment put down opposition, he returned to the capital, to let loose the vengeance of the laws against those who had resisted his government. Notwithstanding the accu sations of his enemies, no instance of cruelty or revenge 1 Anderson, vol. iv. part i. pp. 48, 49, 50. Historie of James the Sext, pp. 27, 28. 2 Id.

REGENCY OF MORAY. 47 can be proved against him : whether it was that his nature was really an enemy to blood, or that he found fines and forfeitures a more effectual way of destroying his opponents and enriching his friends.1 These oc cupations at home, however, did not prevent his cares for his safety on the side of England. As soon as he heard of Mary's retreat to Carlisle, and her offer to vindicate herself before Elizabeth, he sent up his secretary, or confidential servant, Wood, to express his readiness instantly to appear in person with the Earl of Morton, to answer any charges brought against him ; to produce evidence to justify his conduct and that of his companions, and, as Drury expresses it, to enter himself prisoner in the Tower of London, if he did not prove her guilty in the death of the king her husband.2 This proposal of both parties to vindicate themselves before the queen of England, and to make her the arbiter of their mutual wrongs, came very opportunely to Elizabeth, as she was at that moment engaged with her council in a deliberation on the proper course to be pursued, in consequence of the flight of the Scottish queen. Knollys had already warned her of the im pression made upon the Roman Catholics in the north by her arrival, and had urged the necessity either of granting her assistance, or, if that was held too much, restoring her to liberty. Rumours and speeches, so he wrote, were already blown about the country, ex posing, in strong language, the ungratefulness of her detention ; and indeed so manifest a wrong was com mitted by her imprisonment, it involved so flagrant a breach of the common principles of law and justice, 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

And here, although I must strongly condemn the conduct of the English queen, it is impossible not to see the difficulties by which she was surrounded : the party which it was her interest to support, was that of Moray and the Protestants ; she looked with dread on France, and the resumption of French influence in Scotland ; within her own realm, the Roman Catholics were unquiet and discontented, and in Ireland constantly on the eve of rebellion \u2014 if such a word can be used to the resistance of a system too grinding to be tamely borne. All these impatient spirits looked to Mary as a point of union and strength. Had she been broken by her late re verses, had she manifested a sense of the imprudence by which she had been lately guided, or evinced any desire to reform her conduct, or forgive her subjects who had risen against the murderer of her husband more than against herself, the queen might have been inclined to a more favourable course. But the very contrary was the case : her first step after her escape had been to resume her correspondence with Bothwell ;2 his creatures, Hepburn of Riccarton, and the two 1 Knollys to Cecil, Carlisle, 2d June, 1568.

In her conversations with Knollys and Scrope, she could not repress her antici pations of victory and purposes of vengeance, if once again a free princess. She declared, that rather than have peace with Moray, she would submit to any ex tremity, and call help from Turkey before she gave up the contest ; and she lamented bitterly that the delays of Elizabeth imboldened the traitors who had risen against her.1 Was the Queen of England at such a crisis, and having such a rival in her power, to dismiss her at her first request, and permit her to overwhelm her friends and allies, to re-establish the Roman Ca tholic party, and possibly the Roman Catholic religion in Scotland ? After such conduct, could it be deemed either unlooked-for, or extraordinary, should she fall from the proud position she now held, as the head of the Protestant party in Europe ? So argued the far sighted Cecil, and the queen his mistress followed, or, it is probable, in this instance anticipated, his counsel. It was determined to detain Mary a prisoner, to refuse her a personal meeting, to support Moray in the regency, and to induce him to make public the proofs which he possessed of the guilt of his sovereign the Queen of Scots. With this view Elizabeth wrote to the regent, and soon after despatched Mr Middlemore with a message both to him and to the Scottish queen. She informed him in her letter, that he was accused by his sovereign of the highest crimes which a subject could commit against his prince \u2014 rebellion, imprisonment of her person, and her expulsion from her dominions by open 1 Anderson, vol. iv. part i. pp. 71, 791.

She admonished him to forbear from all hos tility ; and as her royal sister, who would observe the same abstinence, was content to commit to her the hearing and ordering of her cause, she required him to bring forward his defences against the crimes of which he was accused.1 Before repairing to Moray in Scotland, Middlemore was admitted to an interview with Mary, at Carlisle. He informed her, that his mistress disclaimed all idea of keeping her a prisoner, her present detention at Carlisle having no other object than to save her from her enemies. As to a personal interview that was at present impossible. She was accused of being an accomplice in a foul and horrible crime, the murder of her husband : she had made choice of the Queen of England to be the only judge of her cause ; and care must be taken not to prejudice her defence, and give a handle to her enemies, by admitting her to her pre sence, before trial had been made of her innocency. At these words judge and trial, which escaped Mid dlemore, Mary's spirit rose, and she at once detected and exposed the artful diplomacy of which she was about to be made the victim. It was God, she ex claimed, who could alone be her judge ; as a queen she was amenable to no human tribunal. Of her own free will, indeed, she had offered to make Elizabeth the confidant of her wrongs, to defend herself against the falsehoods brought against her, and to utter to her such matters as had never yet been disclosed to any living being ; but none could compel her to accuse her self: and as to Moray, and those rebels who had joined him, her sister was partial. She was contented, it appeared, that they should come to her presence to 1 Elizabeth to Moray, June 8, 1568. Anderson, vol. iv. part i. pp. 68, 69. r"], [57, "1568. REGENCY OF MORAY. 51 arraign her, whilst she, their sovereign, was debarred from that indulgence in making her defence. \" Who ever heard that subjects and traitors should be per mitted to plead against their prince ? And yet,\" said she, \" if they must needs come, bid the queen my sister call up Morton and Lethington, who are said to know most against me \u2014 confront me with them \u2014 let me hear their accusations, and then listen to my reply. But,\" she added significantly, \" I suspect that Lething ton would be loath of such an errand.\" 1 It had been Mary's idea, from some expressions used by Scrope and Knollys in their first interview,2 that the English queen would be induced to restore her without inquiry, or at least by an inquiry so regulated as to criminate her subjects, without permitting them to reply ; but the mission of Middlemore dispelled this notion. She found that not only was she to be refused an interview with the English queen, but that Moray had been already called upon to repair to England, and to justify his conduct by bringing forward his proofs against his sovereign. Against this she loudly pro tested, and at once declared, that she would endure imprisonment, and even death, sooner than submit to such indignity.3 Such conduct was, no doubt, com pletely consonant to her feelings and her rights as a free princess, and may have been quite consistent with her entire guiltlessness of the charges brought against her; but it seems to me, that complete innocence would have embraced even the opportunity of an im perfect defence, rather than endure the atrocious as persions with which she was now loaded. 1 Anderson, vol. iv. part i. p. 90.

Having received Middlemore's message at Dumfries, hostilities against Mary's parti sans were suspended at the request of the English queen, and he professed his readiness to repair to Eng land in person, accompanied by Morton, rather than that the truth should not be fully investigated -,1 but previous to this, there was one point upon which he desired to be satisfied. It was evident, he said, that in a cause involving such grave results, nothing could be more ruinous for him than to accuse the queen, the mother of his sovereign, and afterwards, as he expressed it, \" to enter into qualification with her.\" 2 Again, if the accusation should proceed, and he was able to prove his allegations, he was solicitous to know what was likely to follow. As to such letters of the Queen of Scots as were in his possession, he had already sent translations of them by his servant Wood ; and he would gladly understand whether, in the event of the originals agreeing with these translations, their con tents would be judged sufficient to establish her acces sion to the murder.3 This preliminary inquiry, so artful in its object, for it is evident it enabled the regent to arrange or amend his proofs according to the instructions which he might receive from England, was intrusted to Middlemore, who, on his return to the English court, reported it to Elizabeth, and at the same time informed her of Mary's resolution to decline the intended investigation. Cecil's answer was framed with the evident view of being com municated by Lord Herries, who was then at the 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C. Drury to Cecil, 17th June, 1568. 9 MS.

It informed the regent that Elizabeth neither meant to promote anyaccusation of the Scottish queen, nor to proceed to any condem nation ; that her single purpose was to settle all disputes, to allow of no faults in her sister, to bring the controversy to a happy conclusion with surety to all parties, and to esteem no proof sufficient till both parties were heard.1 Such a declaration must have startled Moray ; and had he believed it, it is evident, from the cautious tone of his previous inquiries, that no accusation of the Queen of Scots was to be looked for from him. But Elizabeth at this moment exerted all the powers of that state craft in which she was so great an adept, to blind both Moray and Mary. It was her object to persuade the regent, that whatever might be her assurances to Mary, she really intended to try the cause, and if he could prove her guilty, to keep her where she was, in prison : it was her purpose, on the other hand, to con vince Mary that she would never permit Moray to bring forward any accusation, but quashing all odious criminations, promote a reconciliation with her sub jects, and restore her to her dignity. The negotiations were conducted on the part of the Scottish queen by Lord Herries, who was then at the English court ; and by Cecil's directions, such only of this nobleman's proposals as it was deemed expedient Moray should know, were communicated to the regent,2 whilst from Mary we may believe the same concealment was made of Moray's entire messages. These artful transactions occupied nearly a month, 1 Goodal, vol. ii. p. 89.

In that country Moray's unpopularity was now exces sive, whilst the queen's friends were daily rising into confidence and strength. The severity of the regent, and the terrors of an approaching parliament, in which the dismal scenes of forfeiture and confiscation were expected to be renewed, had so estranged his supporters and united his enemies, that he began to be alarmed, not only for his government, but for his life. A con spiracy for his assassination was discovered, at the head of which were the comptroller Murray of Tullibardine and his brother, the same persons who had acted so bold a part in arraigning Bothwell.1 The regent was taunted, and not unjustly, with his former activity in prosecuting the king's murderers, and his present lukewarmness ; and people pointed ironically to his associate, Sir James Balfour, a man universally de tested, by his own confession one of the murderers, and now employed by Moray in the most confidential affairs of the government.2 To such a height had these discontents arisen, that Argyle, Huntley, and the Hamiltons, uniting their strength in favour of the queen, held a convention at Largs, (July 28th,) in which they resolved to let loose the borderers upon England, and wrote to the Duke of Alva, requesting his assistance in the most earnest terms.3 Notwithstanding the delays produced by this miserable state of things, Mary and the regent at last agreed to have their disputes settled by the English 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

As some controversy has arisen upon this point, it is right to give his very words. He told Mary that Elizabeth had commanded him to say unto her, \" That if she would commit her cause to be heard by her highness's order, but not to make her highness judge over her, but rather as to her dear cousin and friend, to commit herself to her advice and counsel ; that if she would thus do, her highness would surely set her again in her seat of regiment, and dignity regal, in this form and order: \u2014 first, her high- ness would send for the noblemen of Scotland that be her adversaries, to ask account of them, before such noblemen as this queen herself should like of, to know their answer, why they have deposed their queen and sovereign from her regiment ; and that if, in their answers, they could allege some reason for them in their so doing, (which her highness thinks they cannot do,) that her highness would set this queen in her seat regal conditionally, that those her lords and subjects should continue in their honours, estates, and dignities to them appertaining. But if they should not be able to allege any reason of their doings, that then her highness would absolutely set her in her seat regal, and that by force of hostility, if they should resist.\" To this promise, which is quite clear and explicit, Eliza- beth annexed as conditions, that Mary should renounce all claim to the crown of England, during the life of the queen, or her issue ; that she should forsake the league with France, and, abandoning the mass, receive the Common Prayer after the form of England.1 This 1 Anderson, vol. iv. part i. pp. 109, 110."], [62, "1568. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 56 last stipulation was added with a view of encouraging some symptoms of a disposition to be converted to the Church of England, which had recently appeared in Mary, who had received an English chaplain, and \"had grown to a good liking of the Common Prayer.\" x These proposals the Queen of Scots embraced after some hesitation, and commissioners would have been immediately appointed for the trial of this great cause, but for the melancholy state of Scotland. In this country, Huntley and Argyle kept the field at the head of a large force ; and, having completely reduced under the queen's power the northern and western parts of the kingdom, were rapidly advancing to the south. Their object was to crush Moray before he could hold the parliament, in which they expected the vengeance of the laws to be let loose against themselves ; but their march was arrested by letters from their sovereign, who commanded her friends to desist from hostilities, in forming them that Elizabeth would compel the regent to the same course.2 This order, on Mary's side, was obeyed ; on Moray's, if indeed ever sent by the Eng lish queen, it was openly violated ; for scarce were his rivals dispersed, than the parliament met, (18th August,) and, had it not been for the remonstrances of Lethington, not a baron who had espoused the cause of the queen would have been left unproscribed. As it was, all his efforts could not save the Archbishop of St Andrews, Lord Claud Hamilton, the Bishop of Ross, and many others, who were declared traitors, and forfeited.3 It was in vain that the lords of Mary's party complained of this cruel and unjust conduct, and prepared for revenge. Moray, forgetful of his promises, anticipated their attack, hastily levied a force, overran 1 Knollys to Cecil, 28th July.

If this was delayed or resisted, she declared her resolution instantly to set Mary at liberty, and assist her against her enemies; adding, that his refusal would convince her of his mistress's innocence and his own guilt.1 This mandate Moray did not dare to disobey, what ever may have been his wishes and regrets. He distrusted Elizabeth ; he dreaded increasing his unpo pularity with the nobles, by openly bringing forward so odious an accusation against his sovereign ; he saw that success was doubtful, failure absolute ruin ; and when he proposed to select commissioners, all shrunk from so invidious an office. But he had advanced too far to retract ; and digesting as he best could the mor tification of being arrested in the course of his victories, he determined to appear personally at York, and ap pointed four commissioners to accompany him. These were the Earl of Morton, the Bishop of Orkney, Lord Lindsay, and the Commendator of Dunfermline. To them he added some assistants, the most noted of whom were Lethington the secretary, whom he had begun to suspect of a leaning to the queen's cause, and dreaded to leave behind him, the celebrated Buchanan, and Mr James Makgill. Elizabeth now directed the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of Sussex, and Sir Ralph Sadler, to appear upon her part ; and nothing remained but for Mary to appoint her commissioners.2 Previous to this, she desired to have a consultation 1 Camden, apud Kennet, vol. ii. p. 412. 3 Goodal, vol. ii. p. 109."], [64, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1568. 58 with Lesley the bishop of Ross ; and, on his repair to Bolton, this able and attached servant expressed his sorrow that she had agreed to any conference wherein her subjects should be accused, as Moray and his friends, he said, would undoubtedly utter all they could for their defence, although it were to her dishonour and that of the whole realm ; it was vain, he added, to expect that they would openly acknowledge themselves to be ill subjects, and she a good princess ; and it would, in his opinion, be far better to endeavour to bring about an amicable arrangement, without any accusation on either side. To this, Mary's answer, as reported by Lesley himself, was remarkable. She declared there was no such danger to be apprehended as he supposed, since the judges would be favourable to her, and she was already assured of the good will of the Duke of Nor folk, who had sent her a message to Bolton, expressive of his attachment to her interests.1 At this moment, Robert Melvil arrived at Bolton with important despatches from Lethington to Mary. He stated that Moray was determined to utter every thing he could against her, and had carried with him to York the \" letters which he had to produce in proof of the murder;\" he sent her, by the same messenger, copies of these letters which he had clandestinely pro cured ; he assured her, that nothing but a desire to do her service had induced him to come into England, and begged her to send word by Melvil to York, what she thought it best for him to do. Mary, after having carefully examined these letters, which were only the translations from the original French into the Scottish language, sent her answer to Lethington. It is worthy of note, that it contained no assertion as to the forgery 1 Examination of the Bishop of Ross at the Tower. Murdin, p. 52."], [65, "1568. REGENCY OF MORAY. 59 or interpolation of these letters, now, as it appears, communicated to her for the first time. It simply requested him to use his efforts to stay the rigorous accusations of Moray, to labour with the Duke of Nor folk in her favour, and to give full credit to the Bishop of Ross.1 Having concluded her consultation with Lesley and Melvil, she chose her commissioners. They were the Bishop of Ross, Lords Herries, Boyd, and Livingston, the Abbot of Kilwinning, Sir John Gordon of Loch invar, and Sir James Cockburn of Skirling.2 These persons having received their instructions, proceeded to York, where they met the regent, the Duke of Norfolk, and the rest of the judges. So far Elizabeth had been successful, and the posi tion in which she had placed herself was certainly most solemn and imposing. Before her pleaded the Queen of Scots, so late her rival and her opponent, now her prisoner awaiting her award, and acknow ledging, that if restored to her dignity, she would owe all to her interference. On the other hand, stood the regent, the representative of the majesty of his sove reign, and the governor of a kingdom, but now receiv ing the law from her lips whose superior power he did not dare to resist. To hear the cause were assembled the noblest and the wisest in both coun tries ; and besides this, the misfortunes of Mary had created so great and universal a sensation, that it is no exaggeration when we say, the eyes not only of England and Scotland, but of Europe, were fixed upon the conferences now opening at York. The commissioners, accordingly, having assembled, the proceedings began ; but, on the very threshold, a 2 Goodal, vol. ii. p. 109. 1 Murdin, pp. 52, 53."], [66, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1568. 60 sharp dispute arose when Norfolk observed, that the regent, having consented to plead before Elizabeth, must first do homage to the English crown. The pro position was received as an insult ; and Moray, red with anger, was hesitating how to answer it, when the cooler Lethington took up the word, and sarcastically re marked, that when the Scottish monarchs received back again the counties of Northumberland and Cum berland, with the manor of Huntingdon, it would be time to talk of homage ; but, as to the crown and king dom of Scotland, both were more free than their own England had recently been, when she paid Peter's pence to Rome.1 The mention of the point, however, rendered some notice of it necessary, and after the oaths had been administered, mutual protestations were taken.2 The commissioners of the Scottish queen then gave in their complaint. It stated, in clear and energetic language, the history of the rebel lion against Mary, her deposition and imprisonment, the usurpation of the regency by Moray, her escape, defeat, and flight into England, and her confident hope that, by the mediation of Elizabeth, she might be restored to the peaceable enjoyment of her kingdom.3 All now looked with eagerness for Moray's reply, confidently expecting that he would bring forward, as his defence, the accusation of his sovereign, and the promised proofs of her accession to the murder of the king; but, to the surprise and disappointment of Elizabeth, he was seized with a repetition of his for mer fears ; and, instead of proceeding to any accusa tion, requested a preliminary conference with the 1 Melvil's Memoirs, p. 206.

Being admitted to it, he desired to know whether they would grant him an assurance that their mistress would pronounce the Queen of Scots guilty or not guilty, according to the proofs which he laid before them ; and, in the event of the conviction of the murder, whether the Queen of England would sanction his proceedings, maintain the government of the king, and support him in his office of regent.1 These questions being remitted by the commissioners to Elizabeth, he gave in his defence, which produced new astonishment. It rested solely on Mary's marriage with Bothwell, and detailed the shameful circumstances by which it was accompanied, with the necessity of rising in arms to defend the prince, and of subjecting the queen to a temporary imprisonment, during which she voluntarily resigned the crown. It added not a syllable, directly or in directly, accusing Mary of being an accomplice in the murder, and did not even contain a hint or an allusion, from which it could be gathered that the regent ever entertained such a suspicion, (October 10th.)2 It was difficult to account for this sudden and un expected moderation upon the part of Moray. A few weeks only had elapsed since he had been loud in his accusations, and testified the utmost eagerness to bring forward his proofs. He was now silent on the subject ; his defence was general, almost to feebleness ; and when, after a few days' interval, it was replied to by Mary's commissioners, who urged, forcibly and triumphantly, the coalition between Bothwell and the lords, his trial and acquittal, and their subsequent recommendation of him as a husband to the queen, he sat down apparently 1 Goodal, vol. ii. pp. 130, 131.

A secret intrigue, of which we have already had some slight intimation from Mary's conversation with the Bishop of Ross, furnishes us with a key to all this mystery. It originated in the ambition of the Duke of Norfolk, a nobleman then, perhaps, the most power ful subject in England, and who had long been a favourer of Mary's title to the crown. There seems, too, to be little doubt, that for some time Norfolk had entertained the idea of a marriage with the Scottish queen, and that he deprecated the present proceedings against her in the strongest manner, although he dared not refuse the task imposed upon him by Elizabeth. These feel ings, which he had secretly imparted to the Scottish queen through his sister, Lady Scrope, who waited on her, she had, as we have seen, communicated to Leth ington and the Bishop of Ross ; and Lethington, on his arrival at York, procured a secret interview with Norfolk.1 On this occasion the duke expressed his astonish ment that he and Moray should so far forget their honour as to accuse their sovereign before Elizabeth ; as if they thought that England was entitled to be a judge or a superior over the kingdom of Scotland. Lethington warmly deprecated the idea, blamed the weakness of the regent, whose own feelings were against the accusation ; declared for his own part, that he was there, as Moray well knew, rather as the friend than the enemy of his sovereign, and professed his readiness to exert every effort to quash the accusation.2 Nor folk then asked, whether he thought in this matter Moray could be trusted ; and the secretary affirming 1 Examination of the Bishop of Ross.

REGENCY OF MORAY. 63 that he might, the Duke took the regent aside and remonstrated with him on the folly and impolicy of his present conduct. The English queen, his mistress, he said, was resolved during her life to evade the question of the succession, careless what blood might be shed, or what confusion might arise upon the point ; as to the true title, none doubted that it lay in the Queen of Scots and her son, and much he marvelled that the regent, whom he had always reputed a wise and honourable man, should come hither to blacken his mistress, and, as far as he could, destroy the pro spect of her and her son's succession.1 \"Besides,\" added he, \" you are grievously deceived if you imagine the Queen of England will ever pronounce sentence in this cause. We are sent here, no doubt, as com missioners, but we are debarred from coming to a decision, and Elizabeth has fully resolved to arrive at none herself. Do you not see that no answers have been returned to the questions which upon this point were addressed by you to us, and forwarded to the queen ? Nay, you can easily put the matter to a more certain proof: request an assurance, under the queen's hand, that when you accuse your sovereign and bring forward your proofs, she will pronounce sentence. If you get it, act as you please; if it is not given, rest assured my information is correct, and all that will come of your accusation will be repentance for your own folly.\"2 This conversation made a deep impression on Moray, already sufficiently alive to the dangerous part he was playing : and when he imparted it in confidence to 1 Melvil's Memoirs, pp. 206, 207. 2 Ibid. pp. 207, 208, 4to edition, Melvil's authority here is unques tionable, as he was not only present at York, but the regent made him privy to this secret interview. Also, De'peches de la Motte Fenelon, vol. i. p. 17."], [70, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1568. 64 Lethington and Sir James Melvil, both of them strongly confirmed him in the views stated by Nor folk.1 From his brother commissioners, Morton and Makgill, and his secretary, Wood, who had drawn up the proofs against the Scottish queen, the regent care fully concealed what had happened ; but he determined to follow Norfolk's advice, and bring forward no public accusation till he was assured of the course to be followed by Elizabeth. Such is the secret history of Moray's sudden change, and the present moderation of his conduct towards the queen his sovereign. But whilst a regard for his own interest prevented him from assuming the character of a public accuser, the regent privately exhibited to Norfolk, Sussex, and Sadler, the alleged proofs of Mary's guilt, consisting of various bonds or contracts, and other papers, besides some letters and love sonnets addressed by her to Bothwell, with a contract of marriage in the hand writing of the Earl of Huntley. These letters had been found, as the Scottish commissioners affirmed, in a little silver casket or coffer ; it had been given by the queen to Bothwell, and was afterwards with its contents seized by Morton ; and they offered to swear that the letters were written in Mary's own hand. Having carefully inspected them, and drawn up a summary of their contents, Norfolk transmitted it in a letter to Elizabeth, requesting her judgment whether she considered them sufficient to convict the queen of the murder of her husband. He added, at the same time, his own opinion and that of his brother commis sioners, that the proof was conclusive against her, if the letters were really written with her own hand. 2 1 Melvil's Memoirs, p. 208. 3 The Commissioners to Elizabeth, I lth October, 1568.

REGENCY OF MORAY. 65 This, however, was confidential, and unknown to the world ; so that if matters had terminated here the result of the inquiry must have been considered highly favourable to Mary. She had triumphantly confuted Moray ; and, after his boastful speeches, he had shrunk from any open accusation. But Elizabeth was not to be so easily defeated. She had resolved that Moray should publicly accuse his sovereign of the murder ; she was convinced that such an event would be of the greatest service to England whether the Scottish queen was to be restored to her dignity or detained a prisoner ; and with this view she suddenly removed the conferences to Westminste: affirming that York was too distant to allow of a speedy settlement of the controversy, and taking particular care that neither Mary nor her commissioners should suspect any sinis ter intention upon her part.1 How artfully this was managed appears by the original draft of the English queen's letter, still preserved, and partly in Cecil's handwriting. In it Norfolk and his companions were instructed to be especially careful that the Queen of Scots' commissioners should gather no suspicion of the ill success of her cause, but imagine that this new measure was solely intended to accelerate their mis tress's restoration to her dignity on safe and honourable terms, both for herself and her subjects.2 It happened that at this moment Moray had made a secret overture to Mary, which rendered this queen less likely to dread any disadvantage to her cause from the removal of the conferences to London. He had sent Robert Melvil to Bolton to propose a scheme, by which all necessity for accusing his sovereign should 1 La Motte Fenelon, vol. iv. p. 18. 8 Original draft, State-paper Office, papers of Mary queen of Scots, October 16, 1568, Elizabeth to her Commissioners.) VOL. VI. E"], [72, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1568. 66 be removed, and an amicable compromise take place. The Scottish queen was to ratify her demission of the crown, which had been made in Lochleven, the regent was to be confirmed in his government, and Mary was to tarry in England, under the protection of Elizabeth, and with a revenue suitable to her royal dignity. On these conditions Moray was contented to be silent ; and although at first the captive princess professed much unwillingness to agree to such terms, she was at length convinced, by the arguments of Melvil, that such a settlement of the controversy was the best for her interest and honour. She therefore despatched Melvil to carry her consent to Moray j1 she wrote to the English queen, expressing her entire satisfaction that her cause and her honour were now placed in her hands, where she most wished them to be,2 and she despatched four of her commissioners, Boyd, Herries, the Bishop of Ross, and the Abbot of Kil winning, to London. On their arrival, Elizabeth admitted them to an audience ; assured them that she had carefully weighed all that had been done at York ; that the enemies of the Queen of Scots appeared to her to have entirely failed in their defence, as far as they had yet pleaded ; and that their only course was to acknowledge their offences, return to their allegiance, and intercede for pardon, which she would labour to procure them. For this purpose she had removed the conferences to London, and, to make the settlement more solemn, had joined some other commissioners to those already named. Nothing now remained but to proceed with 1 MS. declaration of Robert Melvil, Hopetoun MS.

REGENCY OF MORAY. 67 the business, first ascertaining whether Moray had any thing further to say in his defence.1 When the regent repaired along with Lethington and Makgill to London, it was with a determination not to accuse Mary, but to remain true to his agree ment to Norfolk ; and if any thing should occur to render its execution difficult or impossible, to fall back upon his scheme for Mary's demission of the crown, which he had so lately proposed, and to which she had consented. But an interview with Elizabeth alarmed and perplexed him ; he found, to his dismay, that she was perfectly aware of his intrigues with Norfolk. The whole transactions had been betrayed by a confidant of Mary to Morton ; he had indignantly revealed it to Cecil, and from him it reached the queen. Nor were his difficulties lessened by a message from Mary her self, who informed him that the Duke of Norfolk had forbid her to resign the crown ; and without his con sent she could not abide by her agreement.2 Nothing could be more embarrassing than his situation. On the one hand, Elizabeth did not conceal her anxiety that he should accuse the Scottish queen and bring forward his proofs of the murder. She had every thing in her power : she already hinted that, in case of his refusal, it might be found necessary to bring forward the Duke of Chastelherault, whose claim to the regency was superior to his own ; and it is scarcely matter of wonder that Moray faltered in his resolution. Yet, should he consent to the wishes of the Queen of England, he must bear the disgrace of betraying Norfolk. On the other hand, if he remained true to this nobleman, his fellow commissioners were ready 1 Anderson, vol. iv. part ii. p. 95.

Hopetoun MS."], [74, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1568. 68 to arraign him of treachery to them and to the cause of his sovereign. Under these embarrassments he adopted a middle course, and resolved to prepare the accusation, but not to make it public until he had a positive assurance that the Queen of England would pronounce judgment. Meanwhile, Mary became alarmed at some private intelligence which she received from Hepburn of Riccarton, a follower of Bothwell's, who was now in London, and who assured her, that so far from being favourable, Elizabeth was decidedly hostile to her, and would probably succeed in compelling Moray to desert Norfolk and accuse his sovereign.1 To meet such an emergency she sent additional instructions to her commissioners, by which their powers were limited to the single act of extending her clemency to her dis obedient subjects. She added, that if they found any encouragement given to her adversaries to accuse her, they were instantly to demand her personal admission to the presence of Elizabeth, and if this was refused, to break up the negotiation.2 The conferences were now opened in the chamber called the Camera depicta, at Westminster, the com missioners of the Scottish queen having declined to meet in any place where a judicial sentence had been pronounced. They protested against any thing which was now done being interpreted against the rights of their mistress, who, as a free princess, acknowledged no judge or superior on earth ; and they required, that as Moray had been admitted to the presence of Eliza beth, and had calumniated his sovereign, the English queen should grant the same privilege to the Queen 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, papers of Mary queen of Scots, Knollys to Cecil, 21st November, 1568. 3 Goodal, vol. ii. pp. 185, 186, 187."], [75, "1568. REGENCY OF MORAY. 69 of Scots, and listen to her defence from her own lips. To this Elizabeth replied, that it was far from her intention to assume the character of a judge, or in any thing to touch their sovereign's honour ; but that to admit her into her presence was impossible till the cause was decided.1 With this answer they were compelled to be con tent ; and having retired, Moray and his friends were called in, when, being informed that the defences recently made by them at York were considered inconclusive, they were required to say whether they could urge any thing further in their behalf. To en courage them to speak openly, Sir Nicholas Bacon, the lord-keeper, assured the regent, in reply to the demands made at York, that if the Queen of Scots should be proved guilty of the murder of her husband, she should either be delivered into his hands, her life being sufficiently secured, or be kept in England ; and he added, that if found guilty, Moray should be con tinued in the regency, till it was shown that another had a superior right.2 By this declaration Moray was somewhat reassured. He had prepared his accusation ; and the paper which contained it was at that moment in the possession of John Wood, his secretary, who sat beside him at the table, and for greater security kept it in his bosom. The regent now rose, and declared how unwilling he and his friends had ever been to touch the honour of their sovereign, or to publish to strangers what might eternally defame her ; how readily, had it been possible, they would have secured her reputation and preserved their prince, even at the price of their own exile ; and he solemnly protested, that if at last they were coni- 1 Goodal, vol. ii. pp. 188, 189, November 23, 1568. 2 Ibid. pp. 201, 202, November 26, 1568."], [76, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1568. 70 pelled to pursue a different course, the blame was not to be imputed to them, but rested with their enemies, who constrained them to adopt it in their own de fence, and dragged into light the proofs which they had hitherto concealed.1 Having delivered this pro test in writing, Moray prepared to give in his accusa tion ; but before he took this last and fatal step, he required an assurance, under the English queen's hand, that she would pronounce a judgment. To this Cecil replied, \" that he had ample assurance already; and it ill became him to suspect or doubt the word of their royal mistress. Where,\" added he, \" is your accusa tion?\" \u2014 \"It is here,\" said Wood, plucking it from his bosom ; \" and here it must remain till we see the queen's handwrit ;\" but as he spoke the paper was snatched from him by Bothwell the bishop of Orkney, who sprung to the table pursued by Wood, and, mid the ill-suppressed laughter of the English commis sioners, laid it before them. The scene, as it is described by Melvil, must have been an extraordinary one. The regent was deeply mortified; and Cecil, smiling triumphantly, enjoyed his confusion : Lord William Howard, a rough seaman, shouted aloud, and commended the activity of Bishop Turpy, a nickname of Orkney ; and Lethington, who was the saddest of the company, whispered in Moray's ear, that he had ruined his cause for ever.2 The die, however, was cast ; and the charge, which had been so long withheld, was now preferred in the broadest terms. The regent stated, that as Bothwell was the chief executor of the horrible murder of their late sovereign, so he and his friends affirmed that the 1 Anderson, vol. iv. part ii. pp. 115, 118. 2 Melvil's Memoirs, pp. 210, 211."], [77, "REGENCY OF MORAY. 1568. 71 queen his wife had persuaded him to commit it ; that she was not only in the foreknowledge of the same, but a maintainer of the assassins, as she had shown by thwarting the course of justice, and by marrying the chief author of that foul crime.1 To give additional force and solemnity to this proceeding, the Earl of Lennox, father to the murdered king, at this moment presented himself before the commissioners ; and hav ing bewailed in pathetic terms the miserable fate of his son, delivered to them a paper, in which he accused Mary in direct terms of conspiring his death.2 When informed of this proceeding, the deputies of this princess expressed the utmost indignation ; they declared that nothing could be more false and calum nious than such a statement ; that some of those persons who now with shameless ingratitude sought to blacken their sovereign, were themselves deeply implicated in the murder ; and they required an imme diate audience of Elizabeth.3 When admitted to her presence, they complained in strong terms of the manner in which she had conducted the proceedings. They reminded her how carefully it had been provided, that, in the absence of their royal mistress, nothing should be done which might affect her honour and royal estate : this, they declared, had been directly infringed : she had admitted her subjects into her presence ; they had been encouraged to load her with the most atrocious imputations ; it was now, there fore, their duty, as custodiers of their mistress's hon our, to demand that, in common justice, she should also be heard in person ; and to beseech her to arrest the authors of such slanderous practices, till they 1 Anderson, vol. iv. part ii. p, 119. 3 Ibid. p. 122. 3 Goodal, Appendix, vol. ii. pp. 209-213, inclusive."], [78, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1568. 72 should answer the charges which should be brought against them.1 This demand perplexed Elizabeth. It was a just and spirited assertion, on the part of the Scottish commissioners, of their mistress's undoubted right ; but the English queen had not the slightest intention of acquiescing in it. She had now gained her first point, Moray having at last publicly arraigned Mary of the murder; but another and greater object re mained : she was desirous of getting possession of the proofs of her guilt, of exhibiting them to her council, and either publishing them to the world, or employing them in intimidating her unhappy prisoner into an acceptance of any terms she dictated. Her mode of accomplishing this was artful and politic. It was, no doubt, quite reasonable, she said, addressing the commissioners of the queen, that their mistress should appear to defend herself against so heinous an imputation as the murder of her husband, a crime of which she never had believed her guilty. As for a personal interview, the only reason why she had re fused this was, on account of the common slander against her ; and now, since the accusation had been publicly made, it would be inconsistent, alike with her honour and that of their mistress, to consent to any compromise or agreement, until the regent and his friends had been called upon to prove their allega tions. She, therefore, had resolved to send for them and demand their proofs, after which she would will ingly hear their mistress.2 The commissioners remonstrated against the mani fest partiality and injustice of such a proceeding : they 1 Goodal, Appendix, vol. ii. pp. 213-21 9. La Motte Fenelon, vol. i. pp. 38-51. 2 Ibid. p. 221, December 4."], [79, "REGENCY OF MORAY. 1568. 73 observed, that her majesty must, of course, act as she pleased ; but, for their part, they would never consent that their sovereign's rebellious subjects should be further heard, till she herself were admitted to declare her innocence : and they ended by solemnly protesting, that nothing done hereafter should in any way affect or prejudge her rights.1 So far, every thing on their part was consistent and agreeable to the indignant feel ings of a person unjustly accused ; but their next step is perplexing, and seems not so easily reconcileable with Mary's perfect innocence ; for, on the same day, they made a finalproposal for a compromise, by which Moray, notwithstanding his accusation, might still once more be admitted to the favour of his sovereign, and the disputes between her and her subjects be settled.2 They added that this scheme seemed to them most consonant to the first intentions of both the queens. It was re jected, however, by Elizabeth : any compromise, she said, would now affect Mary's honour ; better far would it be to summon her accusers, to reprimand and chastise them for the defamation of their sovereign. She would not call for proofs ; but if they persisted in their charge, it would be proper to hear what they could allege in their defence.3 Such a proposal for a compromise would certainly tell strongly against the innocence of the Scottish queen, had it proceeded from herself, after the accusa tion brought forward by Moray ; but this was not the case. It came from her commissioners alone, and, as they afterwards asserted, without any communication with their mistress. When at last they found it de- 1 Goodal, vol. ii. p. 223. 2 See Anderson, vol. iv. part ii.pp. 135, 137, for the particulars of this last proposal. 3 Ibid. pp. 139, 140."], [80, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1568. 74 clined, and perceived that Elizabeth had formed a re solution to hear from Moray the alleged proofs of their sovereign's guilt, before she was suffered to open her lips in her defence, they resolved to be equally per emptory : as soon, therefore, as the regent was sum moned before the English commissioners, the Bishop of Ross and his associates demanded admission ; and, coming forward, at once dissolved the conference. They declared, that since the Queen of England was deter mined to receive from the regent the proofs of his in jurious allegations against their sovereign, before she was heard in her presence, they were compelled to break off all proceedings ; and they delivered a written protest, that nothing done hereafter should prejudice the honour or estate of their royal mistress. Cecil and the commissioners declined to receive this paper, affirm ing that it misrepresented the answer of the English queen ; but the Scottish deputies withdrew, repeating that they would neither treat nor appear again.1 From this moment the conferences were truly at an end ; but Elizabeth's object was still to be attained : Moray, therefore, was charged with having defamed his sovereign by an unfounded accusation, and required to defend himself. He did so, by the production of those celebrated letters and sonnets, which Elizabeth had already secretly examined, and of which he now produced both the originals and the copies. Of these, the originals have long since disappeared, and the garbled state of the copies which now exist, and which appear to have been tampered with, certainly renders their evidence of a suspicious nature. At this time, however, both originals and copies were laid before the commissioners, after which the depositions of some 1 Anderson, vol. iv. part ii. pp. 145, 146, December 6, 1568."], [81, "1568. REGENCY OF MORAY. 75 servants of the late king, and the confessions of Powrie and others, executed for the murder, were produced. Having proceeded thus far, and the English commis sioners being in possession of the whole proofs against the Scottish queen, it might have been expected that some opinion would have been pronounced by them. Nothing of this kind, however, took place, neither did Elizabeth herself think it then expedient to say a word upon the subject ; but, after a short season of delay, she resolved to bring the cause before a more numerous tribunal. With this view, the chief of her nobility were summoned to attend a meeting of the privy council. There came, accordingly, the Earls of North umberland, Westmoreland, Shrewsbury, Worcester, Warwick, and Huntingdon ; and from some expressions dropt by Cecil, in a letter to Norris,1 it may be gathered, that it was intended, with their advice, to come at last to some important and final decision. Yet this third solemn preparation ended, like the rest, in nothing. After the lords had been sworn to secrecy, the whole evidence against the Queen of Scots was laid before them ; and instead of a judgment upon the authenticity of the proofs, and the alleged guilt of the accused, these noble persons contented themselves with a vague allu sion to the \" foul matters they had seen,\" and a general approval of the course adopted by their sovereign. Elizabeth next sent for the Scottish commissioners ; and, in reply to their demand so recently made for the admission of their royal mistress to defend herself in her presence, informed them that, from the turn matters had taken, it had become now more impossible than ever to listen to such a request. It was easy, she said, for Mary either to send some confidential person to court with her defence, or to permit the English queen 1 Cabala, p. 155."], [82, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1568. 76 to despatch some noblemen to receive it, or to authorize her deputies to reply to the English commissioners. If she still refused to adopt any one of these methods to vindicate herself, she must not be surprised if so obstinate a silence should be interpreted into an ad mission of guilt.1 These specious offers and arguments did not impose upon the Bishop of Ross and his colleagues. They remonstrated loudly against the injustice with which their royal mistress had been treated ; they insisted that since she was denied the common privilege of a personal defence, she should be permitted to return as a free princess to her own kingdom, or, if she preferred it, to retire to France ; and at the same time, as their services were no longer necessary, they requested their dismissal from court.2 The queen replied, they might go to Bolton and consult with their mistress, but should not leave England till the conference was at an end. She then addressed to Mary a letter, of which the ob ject seemed to be, to intimidate her into a defence ; but so perplexed and capricious was Elizabeth's mind at this moment, that on the next day she changed her measures ; and, in a private communication to Knollys the vice-chamberlain, who then had charge of the Scottish queen, declared her anxiety to proceed no farther in her cause. It appeared to her, she said, a far better method to endeavour to persuade Mary to resign the government into the hands of Moray ; whilst the prince her son, for his safety, should be brought into England. She herself, too, it was added, might continue in that country, and this whole cause of hers, wherewith she had been charged, be committed to per petual silence.3 1 Goodal, vol. ii. pp. 257, 260, 263, 264.

REGENCY OF MORAY. 77 Knollys was directed to manage matters so that this proposal might proceed from herself; but whilst Eliza beth was thus tossed about by so many intricate and contradictory schemes, Maryhad transmitted directions to her commissioners which defeated this last artifice. She informed them, that although she still insisted on her right to be heard in person, and adhered to her protestation, it was not her intention to pass over in silence the atrocious calumnies with which she had been assailed ; that Moray and his accomplices, in accusing her, had been guilty of a traitorous falsehood, and had imputed to her a crime of which they were guilty them selves. She then enjoined them to demand inspection both of the copies and the originals of the letters which had been produced against her, and she engaged to give such an answer as should triumphantly establish her innocence. This spirited appeal, which was made by the Scottish commissioners in peremptory terms,1 threw Elizabeth into new perplexity, and it required all the skill of Cecil to evade it. Recourse was had to delay, but it produced no change ; and on the 7th January, the Bishop of Ross required an audience, in which he re peated the demand in still stronger language. His royal mistress, he said, was ready to answer her calum niators, and once more required, in common justice, to see the letters, or at least the copies of the letters, which had been produced by her enemies, that she might prove them to be themselves the principal authors of the murder, and expose them to all Christian princes as liars and traitors.2 This fair and moderate request Elizabeth evaded. It appeared to her better, she said, that Mary should resign the crown in favour of her 1 Goodal, vol. ii. pp. 288, 289. 2 Ibid. pp. 297, 299."], [84, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1568-9. 78 son ; that, on the ground of being weary of the govern ment, she should remain privately in England, and make a compromise with her enemies.1 It was in stantly answered by Ross, that he had his mistress's command to declare, that to such a condition she would never agree : if the letters were produced, and she was permitted to see the evidence against her, she was prepared to defend herself. She was ready also to entertain any honourable proposal by which a pardon might be extended to her disobedient subjects, notwithstanding the greatness of their offences : but to resign her crown would be to condemn herself; it would be said, she was afraid of a public accusation, and shrunk from inquiry : this, therefore, she would sooner die than consent to, and the last words she uttered should be those of a Queen of Scotland.2 Elizabeth struggled violently against this determina tion, and was unwilling to receive it. She entreated Ross again to write to his mistress ; but this he steadily refused. She required him and his colleagues to con fer with her council. They did so, but it was only to reiterate Mary's final resolution.3 It was now become absolutely necessary that the Queen of England should either grant this last request, or refuse it, and pronounce a final judgment. Moray earnestly urged the necessity of a return to his govern ment. From Mary no change of mind was to be ex pected. The regent was accordingly summoned before the privy council, and Cecil delivered to him and his associates the definitive sentence of Elizabeth. Its terms were most extraordinary: he stated, on one hand, that as Moray and his adherents had come into England, at the desire of the queen's majesty, to answer 1 Goodal, vol. ii.p. 300. 2 Ibid. p. 301. 3 Ibid. p. 304, January 9, 1568-9."], [85, "1568-9. REGENCY OF MORAY. 79 to an accusation preferred by their sovereign, she was of opinion that nothing had as yet been brought forward against them which impaired their honour or allegiance. He declared, on the other hand, with regard to Mary, that nothing had been produced or shown by them against the queen their sovereign, which should induce the Queen of England, for any thing yet seen, to con ceive an ill opinion of her good sister ; and he concluded by informing Moray, that he should immediately re ceive permission to return to his government.1 From this judgment, which was virtually an acquittal of Mary, it seems an inevitable inference, that the English queen, after having had the most ample opportunities of exa mining the letters which had been produced, either considered them to be forgeries by the other party, or found that they had been so interpolated, garbled, and tampered with, as to be unworthy of credit ; for no one can deny, that if the letters were genuine, the Queen of Scots was guilty of the murder. But if Mary was acquitted, Moray also was found guiltless ; and these two conclusions, so utterly incon sistent with each other, Elizabeth had the hardihood to maintain. When we consider the solemnity of the cause, the length of the conferences, the direct accusa tion of Moray and his associates, the recrimination of the queen, the evidence produced, and the impossibility that both parties could be innocent, the sentence of Elizabeth is perhaps the most absurd judicial opinion ever left upon record. It was followed by a scene no less remarkable. A privy council was called at Hampton Court, on the eve of Moray's departure. It included the Duke of Norfolk, the Earls of Pembroke, Derby, Bedford, and 1 Goodal, vol. ii. p. 305. January 10, 1568-9."], [86, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1568-9. 80 Leicester, with Sir William Cecil, and Sir Walter Mildmay. Before it were summoned the Bishop of Ross and Lord Herries, on the one side ; on the other came Moray, Morton, Lethington, Makgill, Orkney, Balnaves, and Buchanan ; and when they were met, Cecil, rising up, delivered a message from the queen his mistress. She had determined, he said, to give the Earl of Moray and his adherents permission to depart for Scotland ; but a rumour having arisen that they were concerned in the murder of the king, Moray had desired to be confronted with the deputies of the Queen of Scots ; and he now came there to know whether they would accuse him or his adherents, in their mistress's name or in their own.1 To this challenge the Queen of Scots' commissioners immediately answered, that in their own name they had affirmed, and would affirm, nothing; but, with respect to the queen their mistress, they had received her written instructions to accuse the Earl of Moray and his adherents as the principal authors, and some of them the actual perpetrators of the murder. They had communicated, they said, their sovereign's letters on this point to the Queen of England ; they had pub licly preferred their accusation ; they had constantly adhered to it ; they had offered to defend the innocence of their mistress ; they had demanded in vain an in spection of the letters produced against her ; and even now, if exact copies were furnished, they would under take her defence, and demonstrate, by convincing proofs, what persons were indeed guilty of the murder of the king.2 Moray strongly asserted his innocence, and offered to go to Bolton and abide in person the arraignment of his sovereign. It was answered, that 1 Goodal, vol. ii. p. 307 2 Ibid. p. 308."], [87, "1568-9. REGENCY OF MORAY. 81 such a step was wholly unnecessary, as her written accusation had been produced to the Queen of Eng land. Both parties then left the council, and next day the regent received permission to return to Scotland, (January 12. )x It remained to dismiss their antagonists with an appearance of liberality ; and being once more called before the privy council, Cecil intimated to them his mistress's consent, that the Queen of Scots should have copies of the letters, (the originals having been redelivered to Moray ;) but he first required them to procure a declaration, under her seal and signature, that she would reply to the charges which they con tained. It was answered, that Elizabeth had already two writings of the precise tenor required, under the queen's hand ; to seek for more was only a vexatious delay. The whole proceedings, from first to last, had been partial and unjust. If the regent and his ad herents were permitted to depart, why was their royal mistress, why were they themselves, debarred from the same privilege ? If the Queen of England were really solicitous that she should enter upon her defence, let her adversaries be detained until it was concluded. To this spirited remonstrance, it was coldly and briefly replied, that Moray had promised to return when called for ; as for the Scottish com missioners, they also would probably be allowed to depart, but for many reasons the Queen of Scotland could not be suffered to leave England. Against this iniquitous sentence, no redress was to be hoped for : the deputies could only protest that nothing done by her in captivity should prejudge her honour, estate, or person ; and having taken this final precaution, they left the council.2 1 Goodal, vol. ii. p. 309. 2 Ibid. pp. 310, 313. VOL. VI. F"], [88, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1568-9. 82 It is difficult, from the conferences at York and Westminster, to draw any certain conclusion as to the probability of Mary's guilt or innocence. Both Elizabeth and the Queen of Scots acted with great art ; and throughout the discussions neither the professions of the one or of the other were sincere. Thus the English queen, whilst she affected an extreme anxiety to promote a reconciliation between Mary and her subjects, was really desirous that the breach should be made irreconcileable, by the accusation of Moray, and the production of the letters. Nor does there seem to be any doubt that Norfolk's assertion was correct, when he assured Lethington she had no inten tion of pronouncing a decision. On the other hand, it is clear that, during the first part of the conferences, both Mary and her advisers, Ross, Herries, and Lethington, were, from whatever motive, anxious to suppress Moray's charge; that they deprecated the pro duction of his evidence ; and were only induced to go into the investigation from the hope which Elizabeth held out, that she would not permit an accusation, but exert herself, under all circumstances, to promote a reconciliation between the Scottish queen and her subjects, and restore her to the throne. It must have struck the reader that, whenever, by means of the private letters which have been preserved, we get behind the scenes, and are admitted to Mary's secret consultations with her commissioners, or to their own opinion on the conduct of the cause, we meet with no assertion of the forgery of the letters ; and it seems to me difficult to reconcile her agreement to resign the crown, and suppress all inquiry, a measure only prevented by the interference of Norfolk, with her absolute innocence. On the other hand, there are some circumstances, especially occurring during the"], [89, "REGENCY OF MORAY. 1568-9. 83 latter part of the conferences, which tell strongly in her favour. The urgency with which, from first to last, she solicited a personal interview with Elizabeth, and promised, if it were granted, to go into her defence ; the public and oft-repeated assertion of the forgery of the letters, and the offer to prove this if copies were furnished to her commissioners ; Elizabeth's evasion of this request ; her entire suppression of these sus picious documents ; their subsequent disappearance ; and the schemes of Norfolk for a marriage with Mary : these are all circumstances which seem to me exceed ingly irreconcileable with her being directly guilty of the murder of her husband. Upon the whole, it ap pears to me, that in the present state of the contro versy, we are really not in possession of evidence sufficient to enable any impartial inquirer to come to an absolute decision. I have already pointed out, as the circumstances occurred, such moral evidence against the queen as arose out of her conduct both before and after her marriage with Bothwell. The discussions at York and Westminster do not materially affect this evidence, either one way or the other ; and so far as we judge of these conferences by themselves, they leave the mind under the unsatisfying and painful impression, that the conduct of the Scottish queen, throughout the whole investigation, was that of a person neither directly guilty, nor yet wholly in nocent. But, whilst animadverting on the proceedings of Elizabeth and Mary in these celebrated conferences, the conduct of the regent must not be forgotten. He was then perfectly aware of the accession of both Leth ington and Morton to the murder of the king : this both prior and subsequent events proved ; yet did he not scruple to bring these two accomplices to England,"], [90, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1568-9. 84 and employ Morton as his assistant in the accusation of his sovereign. Such a course, which could be dictated only by the ambition of retaining the whole power of the government in his hands, seems unworthy of the man who was the leader of the Reformation in Scot laud, and professed an extraordinary regard for reli gion : it was cruel, selfish, and unprincipled. Nor is this all : making every allowance for the defective justice of the times, it is impossible to defend Moray's management of the evidence against Mary. There can be little doubt, I think, that some letters addressed by this unfortunate princess to Bothwell, did really fall into the hands of her enemies ; but the regent's refusal to produce the originals to the accused, and the state in which the copies have descended to our times, evidently garbled, altered, and interpolated, throws on him the utmost suspicion, and renders it impossible for any sincere inquirer after the truth to receive such evidence. If the only proofs of Mary's guilt had been these letters produced at Westminster, the task of her defenders would have been compara tively an easy one.1 It is the moral evidence arising out of her own conduct, which weighs heaviest against her. But to return. 1 I have purposely abstained from quoting or entering into the arguments of the writers in the controversy which has arisen on the subject of these letters, and of Mary's guilt or innocence. My object has been to attempt, from original and. unquestionable evidence, to give the facts ; not to overload the narrative with argument or contro versy. The reader who may wish to pursue the points farther will find ample room for study in the volumes of Goodal, of Tytler my venerated grandfather, of Laing, Whitaker, and Chalmers. Upon the whole, my grandfather's \" Historical and Critical Enquiry,\" as it appears in the 4th edition, London, 1790, may still, I think, be ap pealed to, not only as the best defence of Mary, but, in a controversy which has been deformed by much coarse and bitter invective, as the most pleasing and elegant work which has appeared on the subject. It is, throughout, the production of a scholar and a gentleman."], [91, "REGENCY OF MORAY. 1568-9. 85 Upon the conclusion of the conferences, the Scottish queen exerted herself to rouse her partisans in Scotland, and animate them to a vindication of their independence against the practices of Elizabeth. Acting by the advice of Cecil her chief minister, the Queen of England had formed a scheme by which, under the nominal regency of Moray, she would herself have managed the whole affairs of the country. The project, drawn up in the handwriting of its astute author, still exists ; the young prince was to be delivered up by Moray, and educated in England under the eye of Elizabeth ; the regent was to be continued in his office, receiving, of course, his instructions from the Queen of England, on whom he was to be wholly dependent ; and the Queen of Scots was to be persuaded to remain where she was, by arguments which Cecil minutely detailed.1 These insidious proposals were discovered by Mary, and being communicated to her friends, exaggerated by her fears and indignation, raised the utmost alarm in Scotland. The regent, it was said, had sold the country ; he was ready to deliver up the principal for tresses ; he had agreed to acknowledge the superiority of England ; he looked himself to the throne, and was about to procure a deed of legitimation, by which he should be capable of succeeding if the young prince died without issue. Such reports flew from one end of the country to the other ; and as he was not on the spot to contradict them, and cope with his adversaries, their effects were highly favourable to the captive queen. In the meantime, although he had received per mission to return to his government, Moray found himself very unpleasantly situated. He was deeply in debt ; and although he had lent himself an easy tool 1 MS. British Museum, Caligula, C. i. sol. 273, 22d December, 1568."], [92, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1568-9. 86 in the hands of the Queen of England, she refused to assist him. If, indeed, we may believe Sir James Melvil, who had an intimate personal acquaintance with the history of these times, she really despised him for his subserviency, and enjoyed his distresses. This was not all : the Duke of Norfolk was enraged at his late conduct ; he had broken all the promises made to this nobleman ; and as Norfolk commanded the whole strength of the northern counties, through which lay Moray's route homeward, he dreaded being waylaid before he crossed the border. Nor was such an apprehension without good foundation, as a plot for his assassination, of which it is said both Norfolk and Mary were cognizant, was actually organized, and the execution of it committed to the Earl of Westmore land.1 Under these difficulties Moray had recourse to dissimulation. With much address he procured a reconciliation with Norfolk, expressed deep contrition for the part he had been compelled to act against his sovereign, and declared, that his feelings upon the subject of the marriage between her and the duke remained unaltered ; it was still his conviction, he said, that such a union would be eminently beneficial to both kingdoms, and he was ready to promote it by every means in his power. To prove his sincerity he opened the matter to the Bishop of Ross, he sent Robert Melvil to propose it to Mary herself, he pro mised to use his influence for its furtherance with the Scottish nobles ; and in the end he so completely reas sured the duke, that this nobleman procured the regent a loan of five thousand pounds from Elizabeth, and sent the strictest injunctions to his adherents not to molest him in any way upon his return.2 1 Murdin's State Papers, p. 51. 3 Lesley's negotiations in Anderson, vol. iii. p. 40."], [93, "1568-9. REGENCY OF MORAY. 87 With Mary herself, his artifices did not stand him in less stead. Her friends in Scotland were at this time mustering in great strength. She had appointed the Duke of Chastelherault and the Earls of Argyle and Huntley her lieutenants. The two earls com manded the north ; the duke was ready to rise with the whole strength of the Hamiltons ; Lord Boyd and other powerful nobles were preparing for action ; and had these combined forces been brought into the field, Moray must have been overwhelmed. But at this crisis the queen and Norfolk were deceived by his pro fessions of repentance ; and Mary, trusting to his expressions of devotion to her interest, commanded her adherents to abstain from all hostilities. They reluctantly obeyed ; and the regent, congratulating himself on his own address and the credulity of his opponents, returned secure and unmolested to his government. On his arrival in Scotland Moray dropped the mask, and exerted himself with energy against his opponents. He held a convention of the nobility, clergy, and com missaries of the burghs at Stirling ; he procured an approbation of his conduct, and a ratification of his proceedings in England ; and lastly, he gave orders for a general muster of the force of the kingdom.1 On the other hand, the duke, Cassillis, and Lord Herries, as soon as they came home, assumed a bold tone ; issued a proclamation, in which the regent was branded as a usurper ; mustered their strength, forti fied their houses, and showed a determination to put all to the arbitrement of the sword. But the rapidity 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Moray to Cecil, 8th February, 1568-9. Ibid, same to same, 17th February, 1568-9. Ibid, same to same, 25th February, 1568-9. Ibid. B.C.

It was evident that, although willing to enter into terms, he was better prepared than his opponents to act upon the offensive ; and after a personal con ference with the regent at Glasgow, (March 13th,) they concluded a treaty of peace.1 It was agreed, that a convention of the nobility should be held upon the 10th of April, for the settlement of the affairs of the country, and that in the mean season there should be a suspension of hostilities. Moray simply insisted that Chastelherault and his adherents should acknow ledge the authority of the king. The duke agreed to this, on condition that all who had been forfeited for their obedience to the queen, should be restored ; that such measures should be taken for the maintenance of her honour and welfare as were consistent with the sovereignty of the king ; and that a committee, selected from the nobles on both sides, should meet at Edinburgh, to deliberate upon a general pacification. It embraced the regent himself, the duke, and the Earls of Huntley, Argyle, Morton, Mar, Athole, Glencairn, and Lord Herries. For his part, Moray stipulated that these noblemen should repair to Edinburgh and return to their estates in security ; whilst they agreed to disband their forces, and surrender themselves, or their eldest sons, as a security for the performance of the treaty.2 A temporary tranquillity being thus restored, the leaders of both parties repaired to Stirling, where the Archbishop of St Andrews, the Earl of Cassillis, and Lord Herries, placed themselves in Moray's hands as hostages ; and the regent, in return, released the pri- 1 Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 141.

It was expected that he would next disband his force ; but, seizing this moment of leisure, he led them against the border marauders, who, from the long interruption of justice in these districts, were become formidable to both king doms. His expedition was successful, and it was a politic stroke ; for it afforded him a good excuse for keeping up his forces, and it taught them confidence in themselves and their leader. When he returned to the capital, it was with spirits animated by victory, and with a secret determination never to lay down his arms till he had compelled his enemies to submit to such terms as he was pleased to dictate. The 10th of April, being the day for the convention of the nobles, now arrived ; and, according to agree ment, the duke, Cassillis, Herries, and other nobles who composed the committee, (Huntley and Argyle excepted,) met at Edinburgh. Two points of much difficulty, and almost irreconcileable with each other, were to be settled \u2014 the continuance of the king's government, and the restoration and return of the captive queen ; but Moray had no serious intention of entering into discussion upon either. When, therefore, the counsellors were assembled, he rose, and haughtily handing a paper to the Duke of Chastelherault, de sired him and his associates, before proceeding farther, to sign an acknowledgment of the king's authority. The duke remonstrated : the demand, he said, was unjust and premature, as the regent well knew. The object of this conference, was to deliberate on the measures to be adopted towards their captive sove reign : let him propose such measures himself, or listen to him and his friends when they brought them forward. If both parties were agreed upon them, he and his adherents were ready to subscribe to the king's autho-"], [96, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1569. 90 rity : they had observed every article of the late treaty, they had trusted themselves in the regent's power, their hostages were in his hands, their lives and their lands at his disposal ; but they had relied upon his honour, most solemnly pledged and signed, nor could they believe that he would disgrace himself by an act of fraud and tyranny. To this spirited remonstrance Moray did not vouchsafe an answer, but ordered his guards instantly to apprehend the duke and Lord Herries. The last nobleman, being the most formid able, was hurried a prisoner to the castle of Edinburgh without a moment's delay ; the duke next morning shared the same fate.1 This outrage was beheld with deep indignation by the country, and estranged from the regent some of his best friends ; but it intimidated his opponents, and rendered Argyle and Huntley more inclined to an accommodation. These noblemen wielded the whole power of the northern districts, and had refused to sign the pacification at Glasgow. So deep was their enmity to Moray, that they had accused him, in a public paper, presented during the conferences at Westminster, of being accessory to the murder of the king ; and since that time they had left nothing undone to support the interests of their sovereign, and destroy the authority of the regent. But the late scenes in the capital had alarmed them ; they saw him sup ported by England, at the head of a large force, his opponents in prison, the southern part of the kingdom reduced to obedience ; and they deemed it prudent to enter into an accommodation. Argyle consented to acknowledge the king's authority, and was immediately received into favour. With Huntley, who had acted 1 Melvil's Memoirs, p. 219. Historie of James the Sext, pp. 39, 40.

REGENCY OF MORAY. 91 more independently for the queen, and granted com missions in her name, the arrangement was more difficult. But, at last, all was settled in a meeting at St Andrews, and the northern lord subscribed his adherence to the government, surrendered his artillery, and delivered hostages for his peaceable behaviour, (10th May.)1 To secure his advantage, the regent immediately led his army into the north, reduced the country, levied heavy fines on all who had risen in favour of the queen, compelled the clans to swear allegiance, and returned, enriched and confident, to hold a great convention of the nobility, which he had appointed to meet at Perth on the 25th of July.2 To explain the object of this assembly, we must look back for a moment, and recall to mind the intrigues which had taken place between Moray, Lethington, and the Duke of Norfolk, to bring about a marriage between this nobleman and the Scottish queen. The project had originated in the busy and politic brain of Lethington ; it had been encouraged and furthered by the regent ; and its success was ardently anticipated by the duke, who carried on a correspondence with Moray upon the subject, and trusted in the end to procure the consent of his own sovereign. A secret of this kind, however, is difficult to keep in a court ; and something coming to Elizabeth's ears, she broke forth with much passion, and attacked the duke, who saved himself by his address. He would admit, he said, that proposals had been made to him on the subject by some noblemen : these he could not have prevented, but he had never seriously entertained them ; 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

After some time, the scheme assumed a definite form, and was secretly supported by a large party of the nobility in both countries. Leicester earnestly pro moted it ; the Earls of Arundel, Pembroke, Bedford, Shrewsbury, Northumberland, and Westmoreland, gave it their full concurrence : Sir Nicholas Throck morton laboured warmly in the cause ; even the cautious Cecil, to whom it was early communicated, contributed his advice.2 In Scotland the plan was managed by Lethington, the regent, and his secretary Wood; whilst the Bishop of Ross and the Lord Boyd communicated with Mary, who corresponded with the duke, and professed her readiness to be divorced from Bothwell. Nothing, in short, was wanting, but the consent of Elizabeth and the concurrence of the Scottish nobility. To conciliate and convince the English queen, Leicester proposed that Lethington should repair to England : to ensure the second, it was resolved that the matter should be brought before that convention of the whole nobility which was to meet at Perth on Moray's re turn from the north. In the meantime, whilst these secret transactions were carefully concealed, the Bishop of Ross, who re mained in England, carried on an open negotiation for his mistress's restoration. To this Elizabeth, with the desire of keeping a check over Moray, affected to 1 Trial of the Duke of Norfolk, Jardine, vol. i. p. 162. 3 Lesley's negotiations, Anderson, vol. iii. pp. 51, 61, 62.

REGENCY OF MORAY. 93 listen ; and Lord Boyd was despatched with some proposals on this subject, to be communicated first to Mary herself, and afterwards, when she had given her consent, to be broken to the Scottish nobility. These articles, Camden affirms, were drawn up by Leicester.1 They stipulated that the Scottish queen, on condition of being reinstated in the government of her kingdom, should enter into a perpetual league with England, establish the Protestant religion, receive to favour her rebellious subjects, and give assurance to Elizabeth that neither she nor her issue should be molested by any claims upon the English throne. Another article was added on the marriage with Norfolk, but was carefully concealed from the English queen. It re commended this union, as the only measure which was likely to restore tranquillity to both kingdoms ; and, to enforce it more effectually, Leicester and his friends despatched a special messenger, Mr Candish, who accompanied Lord Boyd to Tutbury, and carried letters and costly presents to Mary.2 To some of the conditions she immediately consented; on others she demurred, and requested time to consult her foreign allies ; as to the projected marriage, her sorrowful experience, she said, inclined her to prefer a solitary life ; yet, if the remaining conditions were settled to her satisfaction, she was not indisposed to Norfolk, provided Elizabeth were consulted, and her consent obtained.3 On receiving this favourable reply, Norfolk became impatient to complete his ambitious project. He courted popularity, kept open house, strengthened himself by every possible means, and communicated 1 Camden's Elizabeth.

Nor did he neglect the Scottish regent, with whom he kept up a close corres pondence, and who assured him of his continued fide lity and devotion to his service. It may seem strange that Norfolk should have so long delayed to sound Elizabeth upon his great design ; but Leicester, in whom he chiefly confided, strongly dissuaded him from any premature disclosure ; and the deeper he and his confederates were engaged in their secret intrigues, the more they shrunk from the dreaded task of reveal ing them to a princess whose violence and severity held them in constant awe. Meanwhile, though kept in the dark as to the mar riage, the English queen was urged to conclude an agreement for the restoration of Mary, on the ground of those articles which had been submitted to her by the Bishop of Ross ; and, after a conference with her privy council, Lord Boyd was despatched upon this business into Scotland.1 This nobleman carried with him letters to the regent from Elizabeth, Mary, the Duke of Norfolk, and Sir Nicholas Throckmorton ; and meeting Moray at Elgin, on his return from his northern expedition, he immediately laid before him his despatches and instructions.2 The letters of Elizabeth contained three propositions in Mary's be half, and she intimated her desire that one or the other of them should be adopted. She might be re stored she said, fully and absolutely to her royal estate : or, secondly, she might be united in the government with her son, and retain the title of queen, whilst the administration continued in the recent till 1 Lesley's negotiations, Anderson, vol. iii. pp. 54,55. - Ibid. p. 70."], [101, "1569. REGENCY OF MORAY. 95 the prince had attained the age of seventeen: or, lastly, she might return to Scotland as a private person, and be honourably maintained in quiet and retirement. In Mary's own letter, which was brought by Lord Boyd, she briefly intimated her desire that judges should be appointed to decide upon the lawfulness of her marriage with Bothwell ; and should it be pro nounced illegal, her request was, that sentence of nullity should be pronounced, so that she might be free to marry where she pleased. This request evi dently pointed to the projected union with Norfolk, and the subject was insisted on in the letters of the duke himself and Sir N. Throckmorton. Norfolk, in addressing the regent, contented himself with warm professions of friendship, and assured him that, as to his marriage with the queen his sister, he never meant to recede from his promise, having proceeded so far that he could not go back without dishonour. He referred him to Lord Boyd, who was fully instructed by Mary and himself to reply to any doubts which he might entertain, and begged him to believe that he felt for him the affection not only of a faithful friend, but a natural brother.1 Throckmorton's letters were addressed both to Moray and to Lethington. To the regent he observed, that the time was come when he must give up all his con scientious scruples and objections: the match was now supported by a party too powerful and too numerous to be resisted ; if he opposed it, his overthrow was inevitable ; if he promoted it, no man's friendship would be so highly prized, no man's estimation be greater or more popular. In his letter to Lethington, Throckmorton urged the necessity of his hastening to 1 Haynes, p. 520."], [102, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1569. 96 court, for the purpose of breaking the affair to Eliza beth. Of her consent, he said, he need have no doubt. She was too wise a princess to risk the tranquillity of her government, her own security, and the happiness of her people, for the gratification of her own fancy, or the passions of any inconsiderate individual ; and he concluded by assuring him, that the wisest, noblest, and mightiest persons in England were all engaged upon their side. On receiving these letters, the regent, as we have seen, summoned a convention of the nobility at Perth, on the 25th of July ; an assembly of the church was held at the same time in the capital, and commis sioners deputed from it to the meeting of the nobles. It was impossible so acute a person as Moray should fail to perceive that the queen's restoration and the proposed marriage, if carried into effect, must be a deathblow to his power ; and whilst he affected to fulfil his engagements to the duke with scrupulous fidelity, he secretly persuaded his partisans to oppose the match with their utmost influence.1 When Boyd delivered his letters at the convention, containing Elizabeth's three proposals, the effect of this disingenuous dealing was perceived : Mary's full re storation to her dignity was refused ; her association with the young king in the government was also de clared dangerous and impossible ; but the third scheme, for her restoration to liberty, and being reduced to a private condition within her dominions, appeared to them more likely to succeed. The assembly, however, arrived at no definite resolution ; and when the queen's letter, regarding a divorce from Bothwell, was laid 1 Lesley's negotiations, Anderson, vol. iii. p. 71, MS.

REGENCY OF MORAY. 97 before them, a violent debate arose between Lething ton and his friends, who secretly supported the intended marriage with Norfolk, and Makgill the clerk-register, with the leaders of the Presbyterian party. It was argued by the secretary, between whom and Moray there had recently been great coldness, that the divorce might be concluded without injury or disrespect either to the king or the church. To this Makgill answered, that Mary's own letters confuted him, and insulted their sovereign. The king was their only head and master, yet she still addressed them as her subjects, and subscribed herself their queen. The Bishop of St Andrews was a heretic, a member cut off from the true vine, an obstinate rebel and papist, yet she wrote to him as the head of the church. To vouchsafe an answer to such an application, would be in some mea sure to admit its justice ; to grant it, nothing less than treason and blasphemy. It was in vain that Lethington attempted a reply, and sarcastically in sinuated, that they who were so recently anxious for the queen's separation from Bothwell, had now altered their tone with unaccountable versatility. He was interrupted by Richardson the treasurer, who started from his seat, calling the assembly to witness that the secretary had argued against the king's authority, and protested, that any who dared to support him should be accounted traitors and dealt with accordingly. This appeal finished the controversy, and Mary's proposal for a divorce was indignantly rejected.1 The assembly then broke up with mutual expressions of contempt and defiance, the queen's deliverance appearing still more distant than before. 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Lord Hunsdon to Cecil, Berwick, 5th August, 1569.

The renewed intrigues of the Duke of Nor folk were discovered ; and Elizabeth's suspicions being once awakened, she never rested, till, by the assistance of Cecil, her indefatigable and vigilant minister, the whole plot was unravelled.1 These discoveries were made when the duke scarcely suspected it, till he was awakened from his security by some dark speeches of the queen, who taunted him with his high hopes, and bade him beware on what pillow he leant his head.3 But this moderate tone of reprehension was short-lived; for on ascertaining the extent to which the plot had been carried under her own eye, by her principal nobi lity, and without a pretence of soliciting her consent, Elizabeth's fury was ungovernable. Leicester and his associates hastened to propitiate her resentment by a full discovery, and basely purchased their own security with the betrayal of Norfolk. His example was fol lowed by Moray, who with equal meanness, on the first challenge of the English queen, delivered up the whole of his secret correspondence with Norfolk, and excused himself by declaring, that a fear of assassination had compelled him to join a conspiracy of which he secretly disapproved.3 He pleaded also, and with some reason, that Elizabeth's own conduct was enough to mitigate her resentment. If she had adopted a decided part against Mary, they would have known how to receive Norfolk's proposals; but her vacillating policy, and the favour with which the captive queen was treated, 1 Maitland, vol. ii. p. 1090. 2 Spottiswood, p. 231. 3 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Moray to Cecil.

REGENCY OF MORAY. 99 created, he said, an equal uncertainty in his mind, and that of his supporters.1 As for the unfortunate duke himself, he appears to have acted with that indecision which, in matters of this kind, and with such an adversary as Elizabeth, is commonly fatal. His friends admonished him to throw off the mask and take the field at once, and had he followed their advice, his popularity was so great that the consequences might have been serious : but he rejected their advice, and in an apology addressed to the queen, assured her that it had been his fixed resolution, throughout the whole course of the negotia tions, never to marry the Queen of Scots without the consent of his sovereign. His guilt lay in the delay, but his allegiance was untainted, and his devotion to her service as entire as it had always been. This letter was sent from Kenninghall, his seat in Norfolk, to which he had precipitately retired on his first suspicion of a discovery. Elizabeth's reply was an immediate summons to the court. The duke did not venture to obey without first consulting Cecil : the secretary assured him that he was safe : he complied, and was instantly arrested and lodged in the Tower.2 The discovery was followed by a more rigorous con finement of the Scottish queen, who was now removed from Winkfield to Tutbury : her repositories were ransacked for letters ; and she was committed to the custody of the Earl of Huntingdon, a nobleman par ticularly obnoxious to her, who was associated in this charge with Shrewsbury, her former keeper.3 Her most trusty domestics were dismissed, the number of her attendants diminished, her letters intercepted and 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Moray to Cecil, Dumfries, 29th October, 1569. 3 Haynes, pp. 528, 533. 3 Ibid. pp. 526-527."], [106, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1569. 100 conveyed to the Queen of England, and all her actions so rigorously watched, that it became impossible for her to communicate, even in the most common affairs, with her friends.2 Nothing can more strongly mark the sudden and extraordinary changes of these times than an event which soon after occurred in Scotland \u2014 the arraign ment of Lethington. The regent, since the discovery of his intrigues with Norfolk, had fallen into suspicion with Elizabeth. His secretary Wood, also, who had been intrusted with his negotiations at the English court, by his duplicity and false dealing had incurred her resentment ; and although Moray hastened to ap pease her, by a delivery of the letters which convicted the duke, she was aware that Lethington still intrigued upon the subject, and suspected that the regent, from their long habits of intimacy, might be induced to favour his designs. Her fears, indeed, on this point proved to be unfounded ; for Moray, as we learn from Melvil, had recently forsaken his old friends, and suf fered himself to be surrounded by a circle of base and needy parasites. But of this estrangement Elizabeth was ignorant. She therefore directed Cecil to keep a vigilant eye upon the operations of the regent ; Lord Hunsdon, the governor of Berwick, received the same instructions ; the proceedings of the convention at Perth, and the subsequent conduct of the Scottish governor, were severely criticised ; and Moray found, to his mortification, that whilst he had incurred ex treme odium by the betrayal of Norfolk, he was him self an object of suspicion. Whilst Elizabeth, however, only suspected Moray, she was incensed to the highest degree against Leth- 1 Lesley's negotiations, Anderson, vol. iii. p. 78."], [107, "1569. REGENCY OF MORAY. 101 ington, whom she now discovered to be the originator of the marriage plot and the greatest partisan of Nor folk. This restless and indefatigable politician, since his unsuccessful efforts in the convention at Perth, had sought security in Athole, where he was surrounded by his friends, and continued to incite them to renew their exertions in favour of the Scottish queen ; and Moray, who, like other victims of ambition, had be come sufficiently unscrupulous in the means which he adopted to consolidate his power, resolved to recom mend himself to Elizabeth by the ruin of his former associate. Under the pretence of requiring his immediate as sistance at Stirling, in the business of the government, he requested the secretary to leave his retreat in Athole and return to court. Suspicious of some intrigue, he obeyed with reluctance ; and scarce had he taken his seat at council, which was attended by Moray, Mar, Morton, Athole, and Semple, when word was brought that Crawford, a gentleman from the Earl of Lennox, requested audience on business of moment. He was admitted, and, falling down on his knees, demanded justice to be done on William Maitland of Lethington, and Sir James Balfour, as the murderers of their sovereign.1 Amongst the councillors, the only one who heard this sudden accusation unmoved was the secretary himself. With a smile of calm contempt he observed, that his long-continued services might have exempted him from so foul and false a charge, preferred, too, by so mean a person ; but he was ready to find surety to stand his trial on any day which was ap pointed, and he had no fears for the verdict. Crawford, however, still kneeling, warmly remonstrated against 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C. Lord Hunsdon to Cecil, New castle, September 7th, 1569.

He, a gentleman, and a ser vant of the late king,1 had publicly arraigned that guilty man of treason : he was ready to prosecute and adduce his proofs, and under such circumstances he appealed to the council whether bail could possibly be accepted. After a violent debate, it was determined that the secretary should be committed ; and Moray, who secretly congratulated himself on the issue of his intrigue, carried him to the capital, and confined him in the house of Forrester, one of his own dependants. At the same time a party of horse were despatched to Fife, who surrounded Balfour's residence at Monimail, and brought him and his brother George prisoners to Edinburgh.2 The arrest of Lethington increased the unpopularity of the regent ; but his victim had scarcely fallen into his hands ere he was again torn from him ; for the secretary's old associate Grange, dreading some new treachery of Moray and Morton, now closely leagued together, attacked the house in which he was confined, and, by a mixture of stratagem and courage,3 carried him off in triumph to the castle. This rescue deeply mortified Moray, who believed that in securing Leth ington he was not only performing an acceptable ser vice to Elizabeth, but removing the most formidable opponent of his own government. He dissembled his indignation, however ; and as the secretary still declared his readiness to answer the accusation, con- 1 Supra, vol. v. p. 380. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Moray to Cecil, Stirling, September 5th, 1569.

Meanwhile England became disturbed by a rebellion in the northern counties, which at first assumed a for midable appearance. Its leaders were the Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland, its object no less than the restoration of the Roman Catholic faith, the destruction of the Protestant constitution of that country, and the delivery of the Scottish queen. So imminent did the danger at first appear, that Elizabeth issued an order under the great seal for Mary's execu tion, which seems only to have been arrested by the sudden and total failure of the insurrection.1 It arose from the intrigues of the Duke of Norfolk and the hopes excited amongst the English Catholics by the anticipated restoration of Mary. Amongst Norfolk's most powerful friends were the Earls of Northumber land and Westmoreland, two peers of ancient lineage, powerful connexions, and steady attachment to the church of Rome. They commanded the strength of the northern counties ; and had Norfolk chosen to have bid defiance to Elizabeth, they were ready to have risen in arms in his defence. His submission and imprisonment broke, but did not put an end to, their intrigues ; and, irritated at his desertion, they sought the support of the King of Spain, and secured the services of the Duke of Alva and the Bishop of Ross. This prelate, a man of great talents and restless intrigue, was the ambassador and confidential minister of the Scottish queen, and by his secret negotiations, his mistress, who in her first imprisonment at Bolton 1 See Proofs and Illustrations, No. III. Letter of Leicester to Cecil, communicated by Mr Bruce."], [110, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1569. 104 had kept up a correspondence with Northumberland,1 became involved in these new commotions. Alva promised to assist the two earls with a large body of men, and sent over the Marquis Vitelli, one of his best officers, under the pretence of a mission to Elizabeth, but really to forward the rebellion. Before, however, these preparations were completed, Elizabeth obtained a knowledge of the plot, and instantly summoned both to court. Whilst they hesitated, intelligence arrived that Sussex, the queen's lieutenant in the north, had received orders to arrest them ; and scarce was this message delivered, when Northumberland's castle was beset by a body of horse. He escaped with difficulty, joined the Earl of Westmoreland, and, as the only chance now left them, they dropped the mask and broke into rebellion. An enterprise thus prematurely forced on, could scarcely be successful. In their pro clamation the two earls professed a devoted attach ment to the queen's person, and declared their only object to be the restoration of the faith of their fathers, the dismissal of false counsellors, and the liberation of Norfolk. They had confidently looked to being joined by the large body of the English Roman Catholics all over the country ; but their utmost strength never amounted to six thousand men, and these soon melted away into a more insignificant force. Sir John For ster, the warden of the middle marches, made himself master of Northumberland's castles of Alnwick and Warkworth, and by taking possession of the principal passes, effectually cut off all communication between the earl and his vassals in those parts : thence march ing to Newcastle, and being joined by Sir Henry Percy, Northumberland's brother, he speedily reduced the rebels in the northern parts of Durham ; so that 1 Haynes, pp. 694-595."], [111, "REGENCY OF MORAY. 1569. 105 when Sussex took the field with seven thousand men, the rebellion wras already expiring.1 The two rebel earls, with a force which diminished every hour, retired first upon Hexham, and afterwards fell back upon Naworth castle, in Cumberland. Here they suddenly dispersed their little army, and fled with a handful of horse into Scotland. Westmoreland took refuge with the Lairds of Buccleuch and Fernyhirst, two of the most powerful chiefs in those parts ; whilst Northumberland, in company with black Ormiston, a traitor who was present at the king's murder, the Laird's Jock, and other border banditti, threw himself into the Harlaw, a stronghold of the Armstrongs.2 These events passed with so much rapidity, that Moray, who, on the first intelligence of the insurrec tion, had professed his readiness to assist Elizabeth with the whole forces of the realm, was scarcely able to muster his strength before he heard that assistance was unnecessary.3 From such commotions in England, so intimately connected with the fortunes of the captive queen, we must turn to the condition of her partisans in her own country. Of these, the great leaders were Lethington and Grange. Grange was in possession of the castle of Edinburgh, within which now lay his friend Lething ton, Lord Herries, the Archbishop of St Andrews, and others who supported the cause of Mary ; professing, 1 Lingard, vol. viii. pp. 52, 58.

Opposed to them was the regent, supported by England and the party of the Kirk, who kept up a constant correspondence with Cecil, Elizabeth's mini ster, and whose measures were entirely dictated and overruled by English influence. Since his accession to the chief power in the state, but more especially since the termination of the con ferences at Westminster, Moray's popularity had been on the decline. Men blamed his conduct to his sove reign, his treachery to his associates, his haughtiness to his own countrymen, his humility and subserviency to a foreign power, as England was then considered. They accused him of being surrounded by troops of low and needy flatterers, who prospered upon the ruin of the ancient nobility, and persuaded him to betray his former friends, by whose efforts he had been placed in the regency. They declared, and with some truth, that having once sold himself to England, he had be come insensible to every suggestion of honour and good faith. Hence his betrayal of Norfolk, his imprison ment of Herries and the Duke of Chastelherault, his treacherous accusation of Lethington, his threatened severity to Northumberland : all this weighed strongly against him ; and those who had been most willing to anticipate the happiest results from his administration, were now ready to acknowledge their mortification and disappointment.1 Yet, although thus fallen in public estimation, and surrounded by enemies, Moray, natu rally daring and intrepid, showed no symptoms of decreasing energy ; and as the time approached when Lethington was to stand his trial for the murder of 1 Melvil's Memoirs, p. 220."], [113, "1569. REGENCY OF MORAY. 107 the king, he appeared fully determined to insist on the prosecution. When the day arrived, however, a scene presented itself very different from the pacific solemnities of public justice ; Lord Home, at an early hour, occupied the city with a large body of horse. He was speedily followed by multitudes of the secretary's friends, all armed, and surrounded by their retainers ; and as every hour was increasing the concourse, Morton, a principal accuser of Lethington, refused to risk his person within the city. Amidst this warlike concourse, Clement Little, an able advocate of the time, entered where the council had assembled, and protested, that as his client, the secretary, was ready to stand his trial, and no prosecutor had appeared, he was entitled to a ver dict of acquittal. Moray, however, who had taken care to be strongly guarded, rose up, and declared, that as long as the town was occupied by armed troops, no trial should take place, and no verdict be pronounced. He had been placed, he said, by their unsolicited suf frages, in the first office in the state ; he had given his solemn oath to administer justice ; they had promised to obey the king, and assist him in maintaining the law. What, then, meant this armed assembly? Was it thus they fulfilled their promise ? or did they think to intimidate him into their opinion? That, at least, he should show them was a vain expectation ; and therefore he now prorogued the trial till quiet was restored, and they were prepared, having laid aside their arms, to resume the demeanour of peaceable subjects. Such was Moray's speech, as reported by himself in a letter written next day to Cecil ; but we learn, from the same source, that the regent was daily expecting a communication from Elizabeth, containing her instructions how to conduct himself in Lethington's"], [114, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1569. 108 case, and that he delayed the trial to give time for their arrival : an additional proof of his entire subser viency to England.1 He concluded the same letter by an allusion to the recent rebellion in the north : \u2014 \" I have offered,\" said he, \" already to Mr Marshal of Berwick, [he meant Sir William Drury,] to take such part in her highness's cause and quarrel with the whole power of this realm, that will do for me, as he shall advertise me ; * * * and since the matter not only touches her highness's obedience, but that we may see our own destruction compassed, who are professors of the Gospel, let not time drive, but with speed let us understand her majesty's mind.\"2 Moray followed up this offer by summoning the whole force of the kingdom to meet him in arms at Peebles on the 20th December, for the defence of their native country, the preservation of their wives and children, and the liberty of the true religion.3 He had received early intelligence from Sussex of the flight of the rebel earls into Scotland, and immediately despatched messengers to the seaports to keep a strict look-out, lest any should take shipping and escape. But his chief reliance lay in his own activity ; and marching rapidly towards Hawick, he beset the Harlaw, a tower in which Northumberland had found shelter from Hecky, or Hector Armstrong, a border thief. This villain, bribed by the regent's gold, sold the English earl to Moray, who carried him to 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Moray to Cecil, Edinburgh, 22d Nov. 1569, endorsed in Cecil's hand, \"Earlof Murray to me, concerning the day of law for Lydington.\" 3 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Moray to Cecil, Edinbur\u00b0h 22d November, 1569. 3 MS.

This imboldened him to make a proposal on which he had long meditated, and for which the Eng lish queen was by no means prepared. It was no less than that she should surrender Mary into his hands to be kept safely in Scotland, a solemn promise being given by him, \" that she should live her natural life, without any sinister means taken to shorten the same.\"2 It was added that a maintenance suitable to her high rank should be provided for her ; and the arguments addressed to Elizabeth upon the subject, in a paper intrusted to Nicholas Elphinston, who was sent with the request to the English court, were drawn up with no little art and ability. After an enumeration of the late miseries and commotions in England, it stated, that \" as Mary was notoriously the ground and fountain from whom all these tumults, practices, and daily dangers did flow,\" and as her re maining within the realm of England undoubtedly gave her every opportunity to continue them, there was no more certain means to provide a remedy, and 1 Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 154.

At the same time Knox addressed a letter to Cecil. He described himself as writing with one foot in the grave, alluded to the late rebellion, and recommended him to strike at the root, meaning Mary, if he would prevent the branches from budding again. It appears to me that the expressions of this great Reformer, whose stern spirit was little softened by age, go as far as to urge the absolute necessity of putting Mary to death ; but his words are somewhat dark and enigmatical. The letter, which is wholly in his own hand, is too remark able to be omitted. \" Benefits of God's hands received, crave that men be thankful, and danger known would be avoided.

REGENCY OF MORAY. 111 Moray despatched Elphinston on the 2d of January, and as Knox's letter was dated on the same day, and related to the same subject, it is probable he carried it with him.1 The envoy, who was in great confidence with the regent, and a man of talent, received full in structions for his secret mission, which fortunately have been preserved. He was directed to impress upon Elizabeth, in the strongest manner, the difficulties with which Moray was surrounded ; the daily increas ing power of his and her enemies, who supported the cause of the captive queen both in England and Scot land ; the perpetual tumults and intrigues of the Spanish faction of the Catholics in England, and their brethren of the same faith in Scotland ; their inter course with Philip of Spain and the Pope, who were animating them at that very moment to new exertions; the succours hourly looked for from France ; and the utter impossibility of the regent keeping up the struggle against his opponents, if Mary was permitted to remain in England, and Elizabeth did not come forward with more prompt and effectual assistance. It was necessary, he said, to prevent the ruin of the cause, that the Queen of England and his master should distinctly understand each other. She had lately urged him to deliver up her rebel the Earl of Northumber land, to pay the penalty of a traitor. It was a hard request, aud against every feeling of honour and humanity, to surrender a banished man to slaughter ; but he was ready to consent, if, in exchange, the Queen of Scots were committed into his hands, and if, at the same time, Elizabeth would support the cause of his young sovereign, and the interests of true religion, by an immediate advance of money, and a seasonable pre- 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Moray to Cecil, January 2, 1569-70."], [118, "1569-70. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 112 sent of arms and ammunition.1 If this were agreed to, then he was ready to continue his efforts for the maintenance of the government in Scotland against the machinations of their enemies : he would not only preserve her amity, but \" would serve her majesty in England, as they are accustomed to do their native princes in Scotland, and out of England, upon reason able wages.\" If she would not consent to this, then he must forbear any longer to venture his life as he had done ; and it would be well for her to consider what dangers might ensue to both the realms, by the increase of the factions which favoured papistry and the Queen of Scots' title. Above all, he entreated her to remember, (alluding, as it appears to me, to the subject of Knox's letter,) that the heads of all these troubles were at her commandment ; that this late rebellion was not now ended, but had more dangerous branches, for which, if she did not provide a remedy, the fault must lie upon herself.2 These secret negotiations were detected by the vigi lance of the Bishop of Ross, and he instantly presented a protest to the Queen of England against a proposi tion which, if agreed to, was, he said, equivalent to signing Mary's death-warrant. He solicited also the ambassadors of France and Spain to remonstrate against it; and La Motte Fenelon addressed an earnest letter to the queen-mother upon the subject.3 Some little time, too, was gained by the refusal of the Scot tish nobles to deliver up Northumberland, and Eliza beth had despatched Sir Henry Gates and the marshal of Berwick with a message to the regent, when an 1 MS.

This was the murder of Moray himself in the town of Linlithgow, by James Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh. The assassination is to be chiefly traced to the in fluence of private revenge ; but there is no doubt, also, that the author of the deed was the tool of a faction which had long determined on Moray's destruction. He was a gentleman of good family, had been made prisoner at Langside, and with others was condemned to death ; but the regent had spared his life, and been satisfied with the forfeiture of his estate. His wife was heiress of Woodhouselee, a small pro perty on the river Esk, to which she had retreated, under the mistaken idea that it would be exempted from the sentence of outlawry which affected her hus band's estate of Bothwellhaugh. But Bellenden tfce justice-clerk, a favourite of Moray's, who had obtained a grant of the escheat,1 violently occupied the house, and barbarously turned its mistress, during a bitterly cold night, and almost in a state of nakedness, into the woods, where she was found in the morning furi ously mad, and insensible to the injury which had been inflicted on her. If ever revenge could meet with sympathy, it would be in so atrocious a case as this; and from that moment Bothwellhaugh resolved upon Moray's death, accusing him as the chief author of the calamity. It is affirmed by Calderwood, that he had twice failed in his sanguinary purpose, when the Hamiltons, who had long hated the regent, en couraged him to make a third attempt, which proved successful.2 Nothing could be more deliberate than the manner in which he proceeded. Moray, who was at Stirling, 1 The forfeited property. 2 MS. Calderwood, Ayscough, 4735, pp. 746, 747. VOL. VI.

In this town, and in the High Street, through which the cavalcade generally passed, was a house belonging to the archbishop, uncle to Bothwell haugh. Here the assassin took his station in a small room, or wooden gallery, which commanded a full view of the street. To prevent his heavy footsteps being heard, for he was booted and spurred, he placed a feather bed on the floor ; to secure against any chance observation of his shadow, which, had the sun broke out, might have caught the eye, he hung up a black cloth on the opposite wall ; and, having barricaded the door in the front, he had a swift horse ready saddled in the stable at the back. Even here his preparations did not stop ; for, observing that the gate in the wall which enclosed the garden was too low to admit a man on horseback, he removed the lintel stone, and returning to his chamber, cut, in the wooden panel immediately below the lattice window where he watched, a hole just sufficient to admit the barrel of his caliver.1 Having taken these precautions, he loaded the piece with four bullets, and calmly awaited his victim. The regent had received repeated warnings of his danger; and, on the morning of the murder, John Hume, an attached follower, implored him not to ride through the principal street, but pass round by the back of the town, promising to bring him to the very spot where they might seize the villain who lay in wait for him.2 He agreed to take his advice ; but the crowd of the common people was so great, that it became impossible for him to alter his course.

REGENCY OF MORAY. 115 same cause compelled him to ride at a slow pace, so that the assassin had time to take a deliberate aim ; and as he passed the fatal house, he shot him right through the lower part of the body : the bullet enter ing above the belt of his doublet, came out near the hipbone, aud killed the horse of Arthur Douglas, who rode close beside him.1 The very suddenness and success of this atrocious action produced a horror and confusion which favoured the murderer's escape ; and, mounting his horse, with the weapon of his revenge still warm in his grasp, he was already many miles from the spot, whilst the people, infuriated at the sight of their bleeding governor, were in vain attempt ing to break open the door of the lodging from which the shot proceeded. A few, however, caught a sight of him as he fled, and, giving chase, observed that he took the road to Hamilton.2 Here he was received in triumph by the Archbishop of St Andrews, the Lord Arbroath, of whom Bothwellhaugh was a re tainer, and the whole faction of the Hamiltons. They instantly assembled in arms, declared Scotland once more free from the thraldom of an ambitious tyrant, who had been cut off at the very moment when he was plotting against the life of his sovereign ; and re solved instantly to proceed to Edinburgh, to join with Grange, liberate their chief the Duke of Chastelherault, and follow up the advantage they had won.3 All these events took place with a startling rapidity, of which the slow progress of written description can 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

Mortal symptoms, however, soon appeared ; and when made acquainted with them, he received the information with his usual calm de meanour. When his friends bitterly lamented his fate, remarking, that he might long since have taken the miscreant's life, and observing that his clemency had been his ruin, Moray mildly answered, that they would never make him repent of any good he had done in his life ; and after faintly, but affectionately, commending the charge of the young prince to such of the nobility as were present, he died tranquilly a little before mid night.1 I will not attempt any laboured character of this extraordinary man, who, coming into the possession of almost uncontrolled power, as the leader of the reformed party, when he was little more than a youth, was cut off in the midst of his greatness before he was forty years old.2 Living in those wretched times, when the country was torn by two parties which mortally hated each other, he has come down to us so disfigured by the prejudices of his contemporaries, that it is difficult to discern his true features. As to his personal intre pidity, his talents for state affairs, his military capacity, and the general purity of his private life, in a corrupt age and court, there can be no difference of opinion. It has been recorded of him that he ordered himself and his family in such sort, that it did more resemble a church than a court ; 3 and it is but fair to conclude that this proceeded from his deep feelings of religion, 1 Spottiswood, p. 233. 2 He was born in 1530, and slain in 1569-70. 3 Spottiswood, p. 233."], [123, "1569-70. REGENCY OF MORAY. 117 and a steady attachment to a reformation which he believed to be founded on the Word of God. But, on the other hand, there are some facts, especially such as occurred during the latter part of his career, which throw suspicion upon his motives, and weigh heavily against him. He consented to the murder of Riccio : to compass his own return to power, he unscrupulously leagued himself with men whom he knew to be the murderers of the king ; used their evidence to convict his sovereign ; and refused to turn against them till they began to threaten his power, and declined to act as the tools of his ambition. If we regard private faith and honour, how can we defend his betrayal of Norfolk, and his consent to deliver up Northumberland ? If we look to love of country, a principle now, perhaps, too lightly esteemed, but inseparable from all true great ness, what are we to think of his last ignominious offers to Elizabeth ? If we go higher still, and seek for that love which is the only test of religious truth, how diffi cult is it to think that it could have a place in his heart, whose last transaction went to aggravate the imprison ment, if not to recommend the death, of a miserable princess, his own sister and his sovereign. All are agreed that he was a noble-looking personage, of grave and commanding manners. His funeral, which was a solemn spectacle, took place on the 14th of February, in the High Church of St Giles, at Edin burgh, where he was buried in St Anthony's aisle. The body had been taken from Linlithgow to Stirling, and thence was transported by water to Leith, and carried to the palace of Holyrood. In the public pro cession to the church it was accompanied by the magis trates and citizens of Edinburgh, who greatly lamented him : they were followed by the gentlemen of the country, and these by the nobility.

The servants of his household followed, making great lamentation, as Randolph, an eye-witness, wrote to Cecil. On entering the church the bier was placed before the pulpit, and Knox preached the sermon, taking for his text,\" Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord.\" 1 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Randolph to Cecil, Edinburgh, 22d Feb. 1569-70.

Its consequences threatened to unite closely the party which favoured the restoration of Mary, and were solicitous for a general pacification. The Hamiltons, Lethington, Herries, Huntley, and Argyle, had vigor- ously resisted the measures of the regent, and felt impatient under the ascendency of English influence, which Moray, Morton, and their faction, had introduced. That \" inestimable commodity,\" x an English party in Scotland, which Elizabeth's ministers described as having been so difficult to attain, and so invaluable in its effects, was now threatened with destruction ; and Lord Hunsdon, the very day after Moray's death, wrote in anxious terms, requiring the queen's immediate attention to the state of Scotland. Important matters, he said, depended, and would fall out by this event, and much vigilance would be required to watch \" the great faction which remained, who were all French.\" 2 1 Anderson's Collections, vol. iv. part i. p. 104. s MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

If Eliza beth looked to her own realm, it was full of discontented subjects, and on the very eve of another rebellion. If to Scotland, Mary's adherents were in a state of high elatedness and hope ; 1 the Hamiltons had already taken arms, the castles of Edinburgh and Dunbarton were in the hands of her friends, succours had arrived in the Clyde from France ; and, on the morning after the regent's death, Scott of Buccleuch, and Ker of Fernyhirst, two of the mightiest of the border chiefs, broke into England, and in a destructive \" raid\" let loose their vengeance. In their company was Nevil, the banished Earl of Westmoreland, a rough soldier and devoted friend of Mary, who, as Hunsdon wrote Cecil, had testified his joy, on hearing of Moray's death, by casting his hat into the fire: replacing it, no doubt, by a steel bonnet. All this was ground for much anxiety at home ; and the prospect was not more encouraging abroad. In France, the news of Moray's assassination produced a paroxysm of joy, and was followed by active prepara tions to follow up the advantage.2 In Spain no less interest was felt ; and at that moment Douglas, a mes senger from the Duke of Alva, employed by the Bishop of Ross, was in Scotland. He had brought letters to the friends of Mary, sewed under the buttons of his coat, had twice supplied them with money, and warmly exhorted them to keep up the contest until assistance arrived from Philip.3 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

INTERREGNUM. 121 These were all alarming indications ; and the papers of Elizabeth's vigilant and indefatigable minister, Cecil, contain ample proof that he was not insensible to the importance of the crisis. In an able but somewhat Machiavelian memorial on the state of the realm, drawn up on the very eve of Moray's murder, and the arguments in which were greatly strengthened by that event,1 he stated the perils both in respect of persons and matters to be many, great, and imminent ; pointed out the increasing strength of the Romish party all over Europe ; the decay and probable extinction of the Protestant power in France and Flanders; the weakening of all those counter forces which his mistress had hitherto been successful in raising against it ; and the well known resolution of the court of Rome, and the three great powers of Spain, Austria, and France, never to intermit their efforts until they had destroyed England, and placed its crown upon the head of the Scottish queen. In the same paper he called her at tention to that unceasing encouragement to intrigue and rebellion, which was held out by Mary's presence in England, and the growing unanimity and power of her party at home. All this, it was evident, called for immediate exer tion ; and, in Cecil's opinion, there was but one way to provide a remedy, or at least to arrest the evil in its progress. Scotland was the field on which Elizabeth's domestic and foreign enemies were uniting against her : the strength of that country lay in the union of its various factions, which previous to Moray's death had been nearly accomplished by the efforts of Lethington and Grange, and which this event threatened to acce lerate. Her policy, then, must be, to prevent a pacifi- 1 Haynes, p. 579."], [128, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1569-70. 122 cation, keep up an English party, and find her own peace in the dissensions and misery of her neighbour. For this end two instruments were necessary, and must instantly be procured : the first an ambassador, who, under the mask of a peacemaker, might sow the seeds of disquiet and confusion ; the second a regent, who would submit to her dictation. She found the one in Sir Thomas Randolph, an accomplished master in political intrigue, whom she despatched to Scot land only three days after the death of Moray.1 For the second, she chose the Earl of Lennox, father of the unhappy Darnley, who had long been a pensioner upon her bounty, and whose moderate abilities and pliant disposition promised the subserviency which she wished. Immediately after the regent's death, this nobleman had addressed a \"supplication\" to Elizabeth, represent ing the great danger in which it left the infant king, his grandson, her majesty's near kinsman, and suggesting the propriety of extending her protection to the \" little innocent,\" by getting him delivered into her own hands.2 This had been always a favourite project of the queen's, and disposed her to think favourably of Lennox ; but another cause recommended him still more strongly : there had long existed a deadly hatred between the two great houses of Hamilton and Lennox, and no more effectual method to kindle a flame in Scotland could have been adopted, than the elevation of this nobleman to the first rank in the government.3 1 MS. letter, draft, State-paper Office, entirely in Cecil's hand.

INTERREGNUM. 123 In the meantime, Elizabeth received a letter from Lord Hunsdon, the governor of Berwick, which in some degree quieted her apprehensions, and gave her better hopes than he had at first held out. A week after the regent's murder, the Earl of Morton requested a meeting at Edinburgh with Sir Henry Gates and Sir William Drury, who had come to Scotland on a mission to the regent, and were in that country when he died. It was held in Gates's lodging ; and there, besides Morton, the envoy met Grange, Lindsay, Sir James Balfour, Makgill the justice-clerk, Bellenden the clerk-register, with the lairds of Pitarrow and Tullibardine. The conference was opened by Makgill, who assured the English envoys of their continued devotion to Elizabeth, and betrayed an evident terror lest she should set their queen at liberty and send her home amongst them. They spoke of an approaching con vention of the nobility, but declared, that if the Queen of England would accept their services, secure their re ligion, and aid them to resist the intrusion of foreigners, they would run with her the same course which Moray had done, and decide on nothing till they knew her pleasure : as to a regent, her majesty would do well, they said, to think of the Earl of Lennox, a Stewart by birth, a Douglas by marriage, and at that time within her majesty's realm. If she would send him, they were ready to make him the head of their faction ; and should she wish him to be accompanied by any confidential person whose advice he might use, they would gladly receive him also. In the concluding passage of Hunsdon's letter to the queen, he entreated her, when such \" good stuff was offered,\" not to hesitate about its acceptance ; adding, that if the Hamiltons were allowed to bear the chief sway, the French would"], [130, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1569-70. 124 not be long absent. Lastly, he implored her to watch the Bishop of Ross, and take good heed to the Scottish queen.1 Randolph soon after arrived in the capital, and not- withstanding the encouraging assurances of Morton and his friends, found things in an unsettled state.2 Yet this was far from ungratifying to a minister who considered that the strength of his royal mistress lay in the dissensions of her neighbours. A messenger had been sent from Argyle and the Hamiltons, who warned their opponents not to acknowledge any other authority than the queen's ; declaring that, as her lieutenants in Scotland,3 they were ready to punish the regent's murder, but ridiculing the idea that the whole race of Hamilton were guilty because the mur derer bore their name. To this the reply was a public proclamation, interdicting any one from holding communication with that faction, under the penalty of being esteemed accomplices in their crimes. Soon after, Lethington, who till now had remained in a nominal captivity in the castle, was summoned, at his own request, before the privy council, where he pleaded his innocence of the king's murder, complained of the grievous calumnies with which his name had been loaded, and professed his readiness to stand his trial, and reply to any who dared accuse him. This, as it was well known, no one was prepared to do ; and the council immediately pronounced him guiltless, rein stating him in his accustomed place and office \" as a 1 MS. letter, a copy by Hunsdon himself.

The whole transaction was an idle farce, and deceived no one : but the party required Lethington's able head, and imagined they could thus secure his assistance. At this meeting Randolph communicated his in structions, and assured the council of his royal mis tress's support, on condition that they would remain true to the principles of the late regent. For her part, he said, she would increase the rigour of Mary's confinement, and support them both with money and soldiers ; from them she expected that they would watch over the young king, prevent his being carried to France, maintain religion, preserve peace, and de liver up the rebel Earls of Northumberland and West moreland.2 A convention of the whole nobility of the realm was summoned for the 4th of March, to take these offers into consideration, and proceed to the election of a regent ; 3 letters were written to Len nox, requesting his immediate presence; and Randolph, with an evident alacrity, recommenced his intrigues with all parties. In the midst of this, a new rebellion broke out in the north of England. It was led by Leonard Dacres, a Roman Catholic gentleman, of noble family,4 bred 1 Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 158, MS.

When still brooding over his projects, the law adjudged the rich family estates, of which he deemed himself the heir, to the daughters of his elder brother : and, stung with this imagined injury, he at once broke into rebellion, seized the castles of Naworth, Greystock, and other places of strength, collected three thousand men, and bid defiance to the government. It was an alarming outbreak, and greatly disturbed Elizabeth ; but the flame was extinguished almost as soon as kindled, for Lord Hunsdon instantly advanced from Berwick with the best soldiers of his garrison there, and Sir John Forster, warden of the middle marches, meeting him with the border militia, they encountered the fierce insurgent on the banks of the little river Gelt, in Cumberland, and after a sanguinary battle entirely defeated him. Dacres and his brother fled into Scot land, where his presence, along with Westmoreland and Northumberland, formed a just subject of com plaint and jealousy to the English queen.1 Scotland, in the meantime, presented a melancholy spectacle : torn between two factions, one professing allegiance to the captive queen, the other supporting the king's authority ; both pretending an equal desire for the peace of their country, but thwarted in every effort to accomplish it by their own ambition and the intrigues of England. Of these two parties, the friends of the captive queen were the stronger, and must soon have triumphed over their opponents, but 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

They included the highest and most ancient nobility in the country : the Duke of Chastelherault and the whole power of the Hamiltons ; the Earls of Argyle, Huntley, Athole, Errol, Crawford, and Marshal; Caithness, Cassillis, Sutherland, and Eglinton; the Lords Hume, Seton, Ogilvy, Ross, Borthwick, Oli phant, Yester, and Fleming ; Herries, Boyd, Somer ville, Innermeith, Forbes, and Gray.1 The mere enumeration of these names shows the power of that great party in the state which now anxiously desired the restoration of the queen, and resisted the hostile dictation, whilst they still entreated the good offices, of Elizabeth. They possessed the castles of Edinburgh and Dunbarton ; the first commanding the capital of the country, the second its strongest fortress, and, from its situation on the Clyde, affording a port by which foreign succours could be easily introduced into Scotland. But their chief strength lay in Kirkaldy of Grange, and Maitland of Lethington the secretary ; Grange being universally reputed the bravest and most fortunate soldier, and Maitland the ablest statesman in the country. It was generally believed that, with two such heads to direct them, Mary's party would be more than a match for their opponents. Yet these were formidable enough. Their great leader, and the soul of every measure, was the Earl of Morton, a man bred up from his infancy in the midst of civil commotion, \"nusselled in war and shedding of blood,\" (to use a strong phrase of Cecil's,)2 and so intensely selfish and ambitious, that 1 MS.

His interest had made him a steady Protestant. By his professions of attachment to the Reformation, he gained the powerful support of Knox and the church, and he was completely de voted to England. His associates were Lennox, Mar the governor of the infant king, Glencairn, and Buchan, with the Lords Glammis, Ruthven, Lindsay, Cathcart, Methven, Ochiltree, and Saltoun.1 Such was the state and strength of the two parties when Randolph returned to Scotland as ambassador from Elizabeth ; and, acting under the directions of Cecil, exerted himself with such success to increase their mutual asperity, that every attempt at union or conciliation proved unsuccessful. The miserable condition of the country at this moment, has been strikingly described by Sir James Melvil, an eye witness, and an old acquaintance of Randolph. \" Now,\" says he, \" the two furious factions being framed in this manner, the hatred and rage against each other grew daily greater. For Master Randolph knew the diver sities that were among the noblemen, and the nature of every one in particular, by his oft-coming and long residence in Scotland. Among the ladies he had a mother, and a mistress, to whom he caused his queen oft send communications and tokens. He used also his craft with the ministers,2 and offered gold to divers of them. One of them that was very honest, refused his gift, but he told that his companion took it as by way of charity. I am not certain if any of the rest took presents, but undoubtedly he offered to such as were in meetest rowmes,3 to cry out against factions 1 MS. copy of the time, State-paper Office, Instructions given by the Lords of Scotland to the Commendator of Dunfermline, 1st May, 1570. a The Clergy. 3 Offices."], [135, "1570.

He appears to have taken the attack with great com posure, and contented himself with writing a humorous satirical letter to Cecil, in which he amused the Eng lish secretary with a portrait of his Scottish brother. \" The Lord of Lethington,\" said he, \" is presently at Seton, to air himself before this convention.

Many poems and ballads, describing Moray's assassination, and exhorting to revenge, were scattered amongst the people, and the exasperation of the two parties became daily more incurable.2 The failure of the great assembly appointed for March was followed by busy preparations. Every baron assembled his vassals ; armed conventions of the king's and queen's lords, as the two rival factions were now termed, were held in various quarters ; and Morton and Mar, who had been encouraged by the message from Elizabeth,3 having assembled their friends in great strength in the capital, were eagerly pressing for the return of Lennox, when the arrival of Monsieur 1 MS. letter, State -paper Office, Randolph to Cecil, March 1, 1569-70. s State-paper Office ; printed Broadsides, in black letter, by Lek previk. 3 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Mar to the Queen of England, Edinburgh, March 14, 1569-70."], [137, "1570.

Its declared object was to return an answer to France, and deliberate upon the best means of restor ing peace to their unhappy country ; at the same time they addressed a petition to Elizabeth, in which they earnestly implored her to put an end to the miserable divisions of Scotland, by restoring the Scottish queen.3 Very different thoughts, however, from peace or restoration, were then agitating the English queen. The intrigues of Norfolk ; the successive northern re bellions ; the flight of the disaffected into Scotland ; the invasion of Buccleuch and Fernyhirst ; the fact that this \"raid\" had been especially cruel, and that its leaders had shown a foreknowledge of Moray's death, besides the perpetual alarm in which she was kept by the dread of French intervention and Spanish intrigue, had roused her passion to so high a pitch, that she commanded Sussex,4 her lieutenant in the north, to advance into Scotland at the head of seven thousand men.

But Elizabeth was much excited : Randolph, at this moment, had warned her of a conspiracy against her life, and hinted that Mary was at the bottom of it,3 whilst Morton blew the flame by accounts of the hostile activity of Lethington, the total desertion of Grange, and the warlike preparations of their oppo nents. No one that knew the English queen expected that she would have the magnanimity or the humanity to arrest her arms. Under such provocation the storm burst with terrific force.

This little army included the veteran companies, called the old bands of Berwick,2 and had orders to advance to the capital, and avenge the death of the regent upon the house of Hamilton. To Lennox no more grateful commission could be intrusted ; and, making all allowance for the recollec tion of ancient injuries, it is difficult to regard the intensity of his vengeance without disgust. His letters addressed to Elizabeth and Cecil are unfavourable specimens of his character, full of abject expressions of implicit submission, unworthy of his country and his high rank.3 He appears to have been wretchedly poor, entirely dependent for his supplies upon the bounty of the English queen ; and although on his march a grievous sickness had brought him to the brink of the grave, his first thoughts on returning health were, as he boasted to Cecil, \" that he should soon pull the feathers out of the wings of his oppo nents.\"4 This he and his colleague, the marshal of Berwick, performed very effectually ; for, having ad vanced to Edinburgh, and formed a junction with 1 Spottiswood, p. 237. 2 Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 176. 3 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Lennox to Cecil, 16th April, 1570..

In this expedition the palace of Hamilton, belonging to the Duke of Chastelherault, with his castles of Linlithgow and Kinneil, and the estates and houses of his kindred and partisans, were so completely sacked and cast down, that this noble and powerful house was reduced to the very brink of ruin.1 Having achieved this, Lennox wrote in an elated tone to Cecil, glorying in the flight of their enemies, recommending the English to reduce Dunbarton, and imploring Elizabeth to pity his poverty and send him more money.2 From Lethington the English minister received a letter in a different and more manly strain. It was his astonishment, he said, and a mystery to him, that the Queen of England had renounced the amity of a powerful party in Scotland, consisting of the best and noblest in the realm, for the friendship of a few, utterly inferior to them in degree, and whose strength he might judge of by their being only able to muster two hundred horse. In their mad attempts they had thought nothing less than that they might have carried off the ball alone, and have haled the devil without impediment : but he had thrown a stumbling block in their way; and although they would fain make him odious in England, he trusted Leicester and Cecil would give as little heed to their aspersions as he did to their threats.

As for Randolph, he feared he had been but an evil instrument, and would never believe the queen could have followed the course she now adopted, if truly informed of the state of Scotland.1 These remonstrances of Lethington were repeated and enforced in England by the French ambassador and the Bishop of Ross, and Elizabeth began to have misgivings that her severity would unite the whole country against her. She instantly wrote to Sussex, described her interview with the French ambassador, declared she had justified the expedition as well as she could, by asserting that she was only pursuing her rebels, but that she was sorry he had taken so decided a part, and would not hear of his besieging Dunbarton.2 At the same time she commanded Randolph to return from Berwick to Edinburgh, and inform the two fac tions that, having \" reasonably \" chastised her rebels, she had yielded to the desire of Mary's ambassador, the Bishop of Ross, and was about to open a negotiation for her restoration to her dominions. In the mean while, Sussex was directed to correspond with Morton and his party. Ross repaired to Chatsworth, to deliberate with his royal mistress ; and her offers for an accommodation were carried into Scotland by Lord Livingston and John Beaton. The English army then retired, and Elizabeth assured both factions of her earnest desire for the common tranquillity.3 1 Copy, State-paper Office, Lethington to Cecil, 17th May, 1570.

The one had not the slightest intention of restoring Mary, the other deprecated such an event as absolute ruin, and having humbled his enemies, looked forward to a rich harvest of forfeiture and plunder. A correspondence between Sussex, the leader of the late cruel invasions, and Lethington, was the only remarkable feature in the negotiations. The English earl had been a commissioner in the conferences at York ; he was familiar with the services of Moray, Lethington, and Morton, during their days of fellow ship, and was selected by Elizabeth to remonstrate with Maitland on his desertion of his old friends. To his letters the secretary replied by some bitter remarks on his recent cruelties, and he exposed also the infam ous conduct of the king's faction to their queen and their native country. Sussex answered, that he would be glad to know how Lethington reconciled his doings at York, when he came forward and accused his sove reign of murder, with his new zeal in her defence. \" Your lordship,\" said he, addressing the Scottish secretary, \" must call to remembrance that your queen was by you and others, then of the faction of Scotland, and not by the queen my sovereign, nor by her know ledge or assent, brought to captivity, deprived of her royal estate, to which she was by God's ordinance born lawful inheretrix, condemned in parliament, her son crowned as lawful king, the late Earl of Moray ap pointed by parliament to be regent, and revoked from beyond the seas ; yourself held the place of secretary to that king and state ; and after she escaped from her captivity, from the which the queen my sovereign had"], [143, "1570.

Now, my lord, to re turn to my former questions, which be but branches from those roots, and cannot be severed from them, I do desire to know by what doctrine you may think that cause to be then just, which you now think to be unjust ?

On the contrary, the country presented a miser able spectacle of intestine commotion and private war, and it was in vain that all good men sighed and struggled for the restoration of order and tranquillity ; the king's authority was despised, the queen remained 1 Copy of the time, State-paper Office, Ledington to Sussex, 2d June, 1570, Dunkeld. 2 Copy of the time, State-paper Office, May 1, 1570, Thomrts Rnn dolph to the Laird of Grange."], [146, "1570.

In the meantime, the Bishop of Ross and the Lord of Living ston, continued their negotiations for Mary;1 Cecil and the privy council deliberated, and the poor cap tive, languishing under her lengthened imprisonment, refused no concession which she deemed consistent with her honour; but every effort failed, from the exasperation of the two factions. Morton and Lennox had despatched the Abbot of Dunfermline to carry their offers to Elizabeth, and were thrown into deep anxiety by her doubtful re plies.2 She had stimulated them to take arms ; and now, as they had experienced on former occasions, she appeared ready to abandon them, when to advance without her aid was impossible, and to recede would be absolute ruin. In this difficulty, a decided step was necessary, and they determined to raise Lennox to the regency. It was a measure imperatively required, as the only means of giving union and vigour to their party ; and, as they acted with the advice of Randolph the English ambas sador, they were well assured that, although Elizabeth affected neutrality for the moment, such a step would 1 MS.

But in deference to her wishes for delay, they proceeded with caution. In a convention of the lords of the king's faction, held at Stirling on the 16th of June, they conferred upon Lennox the interim office of lieutenant-governor under the king, until the 12th of July. This choice they immediately imparted to the English queen, and ear nestly entreated her advice as to the appointment of a regent.1 Her reply was favourable : the disorders of the country now called loudly, she said, for some settled government ; and whilst she disclaimed all idea of dic tation, and should be satisfied with their choice wherever it fell, it appeared to her that her cousin the Earl of Lennox, whom they had already nominated their lieu tenant, was likely to be more careful of the safety of the young king than any other.2 Thus encouraged, a convention was held at Edinburgh on the 12th of July, in which Lennox was formally elected regent. Lethington was then in Athole ; Huntley, whom Mary had invested with the office of her lieutenant-governor,3 remained at Aberdeen, concentrating the strength of the north ; and the other lords who supported the queen's authority, were busily employed arming their vassals in their various districts.

He refused to be present, would not even hear the letter of Elizabeth read by Randolph, and issued orders that no cannon should be fired after the proclamation.1 Upon this Sussex told Cecil, that he had written \" roundly\" to him ; but so little impression was made by his remonstrances, that the queen's lords declared their determination to hold a parliament at Linlithgow, on the 4th of August, and publicly avowed their resolution never to acknowledge Lennox as regent.2 Both parties now prepared for war, and the new governor, aware that his only chance of success rested on the support of England, despatched Nicholas Elphin ston to urge the immediate advance of Sussex wTith his army, and the absolute necessity of having supplies both of money and troops. Without a thousand foot men, it would be impossible for him to make head, he said, against the enemy : Huntley was moving forward to Brechin with all his force ; the Haniiltons were mustering in the west ; Argyle and his highlanders and islemen, were ready to break down on the low lands ; and, at the moment he wrote, Lord Herries and the Lairds of Lochinvar, Buccleuch, Fernyhirst, and Johnston, were up in arms and had begun their havock.3 These representations alarmed Elizabeth. It was her policy that the two factions should exhaust each other, but that neither should be overwhelmed, and with this view she directed Sussex to ravage the 1 Copy of the time, State-paper Office, B.C.

But whilst nothing but professions of peace and benevolence were on her lips, Scotland was doomed to feel the consequences of such cruel and ungenerous policy in a civil war of unexampled exasperation and atrocity. To prevent any parliament being convened by the queen's lords at Linlithgow, Lennox assembled his forces, with which he joined the Earl of Morton, and advancing against Huntley, stormed the castle of Brechin, and hung up thirty-four of the garrison (officers and soldiers) before his own house.2 These exploits were communicated by Randolph to Sussex, now busy with his preparations for his expedition against the west ; and he informed him at the same time, that, in the negotiations then proceeding in Eng land, the Scottish queen had, it was said, behaved with uncommon spirit. Elizabeth, before she restored her to liberty, having insisted on being put in possession of the castles of Edinburgh and Dunbarton, Mary, on the first mention of such conditions by the Bishop of Ross, indignantly declared, that the matter needed not an instant's consideration : Elizabeth might do to her what she pleased, but never should it be said, that she had brought into bondage that realm of which she was the natural princess.3 1 Draft by Cecil, State-paper Office, July 26, 1570, Queen's ma jesty to Sussex.

Sussex, at the head of four thousand men, now burst into Annandale, and advanced in his desolating progress to Dumfries. His own letter to the Queen of England, the mediatrix between the two countries, will best describe the nature of his visit. \" I repaired,\" said he, \" with part of your majesty's forces, to Carlisle, and receiving no such answer from the Lord Herries as I expected, * * * I entered Scotland the 22d of this present, and returned thither the 28th, in which time I threw down the castles of Annand and Hoddom, belonging to the Lord Herries ; the castles of Dum fries and Carleverock, belonging to the Lord Maxwell; the castles of Tynehill and Cowhill, belonging to the Lairds of Tynehill and Cowhill ; the castles of Arthur Greame and Richies George Greame, ill neighbours to England and of Englishmen sworn, now Scots, and some other piles where the rebels have been main tained.\" 1 He observed, in a separate letter to Cecil, \" that he had avoided as much as he might the burn ing of houses or corn, and the taking or spoiling of cattle or goods, to make the revenge appear to be for honour only ;\" and yet, he complacently adds, as if afraid lest his royal mistress should misunderstand his leniency, \" I have not left a stone house to an ill neighbour within twenty miles of this town.\" 2 It is difficult to recount these transactions of Sussex with out expressing abhorrence of the cruel and nefarious policy by which they were dictated. This invasion was followed by an abstinence of two months, during which the negotiations for Mary's restoration were continued ; but, after repeated and protracted deliberations between the commissioners 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

REGENCY OF LENNOX. 145 of Elizabeth, the Scottish queen, and the regent, the issue demonstrated the hollowness and insincerity of the whole transaction upon the part of the English queen, and the faction which she supported. Secretary Cecil and Sir Walter Mildmay had repaired to Mary at Chatsworth : they had proposed to her the condi tions of an accommodation ; and after taking the advice of her commissioners, and communicating with the King of France and the Duke of Alva,1 whose answers she received, she had declared her acqui escence. All matters appeared to be upon the eve of a speedy arrangement ; and it only remained for the English and Scottish commissioners to have a final discussion, when new demands, to which it was im possible for the Scottish queen to submit, were started by Elizabeth ; and Morton for the first time declared, that his instructions were limited to a general autho rity to treat of the amity of the kingdoms, and that he and his colleagues had no power to receive their queen into Scotland, or to give up to Elizabeth the person of their infant sovereign.2 This declaration, Lesley, the bishop of Ross, with a pardonable warmth, characterized as an unworthy subterfuge ; complained that his mistress had been deceived ; and insisted that, if there was any sincerity upon the part of the English queen, the treaty for the restoration of the Queen of Scots might be terminated upon terms of perfect honour and safety.3 But the appeal was addressed to ears determined to be shut against it. Morton's conduct appears to have been the result of a previous correspondence with Cecil and Sussex ; he was well assured his declaration would be nowise unacceptable to Elizabeth herself ; and the 1 Lesley's negotiations, Anderson, vol. iii. pp. 109, 120, 121, 122, 123. 3 Ibid. pp. 125, 127, 130, 131, 133. 3 Ibid. pp. 134, 137, 139.

The English deputies, in giving a final judgment, observed, that as the re presentatives of Mary, and those of the king and the regent, could not come to an agreement, they con sidered their commission at an end, and must break off the negotiations.1 During all this time, the regent, although professing to observe the truce, continued a cruel persecution of his opponents, and determined to assemble a parlia ment In which he might let loose upon them all the vengeance of feudal forfeiture. Against this Elizabeth remonstrated, but in such measured and feeble terms that her interference produced little effect.2 It was not so, however, with Sussex, \u2014 a cruel soldier, but a man of honour, \u2014 who, on hearing a report that a sen tence of treason was about to pass upon Lethington, wrote this sharp letter to Randolph. \" Master Randolph, \u2014 I hear that Lethington is put to the horn, his lands and goods confiscated and seized ; if it so be, it doth not accord with the good faith the queen's majesty meant in the articles accorded between her highness and the Bishop of Ross, nor with the writing I subscribed, and therefore I have wrritten to the regent and others in that matter. * * * And although I, for my part, be too simple to be made a minister in princes' causes, yet truly I weigh mine own honour so much, as I will not be made a minister to subscribe to any thing wherein my good faith and true meaning should be abused to my dishonour, or any person trusting to that he shall accord in writing with me, should thereby be by fraud deceived.\" 3 1 Lesley's negotiations, Anderson, vol. iii. pp. 138, 139. 2 Original draft in Cecil's hand, State-paper Office, 25th September, 1570, minute of the queen's majesty's letter to Sussex. 3 Copy of the time, State-paper Office, 8th October, 1570, Sussex to Randolph.

REGENCY OF LENNOX. 147 At this moment nothing could exceed the exaspera tion of the two parties, who employed every method they could devise to blacken each other. The regent was branded by Huntley, the lieutenant for the queen, as a stranger and alien ; a man sworn to the service of England, supported by foreign power, and dead to every honourable and patriotic feeling. Huntley and his friends, on the other hand, were attacked as traitors to the government, enemies to religion, band-breakers, assassins of the late virtuous and godly regent, and associates in that infamous band for the murder of their sovereign, which many had seen and well remembered. They replied, that if they were guilty or cognizant of the murder, their opponents were not less so, and pro duced the band itself, signed by Moray the regent, amongst other names. It was answered, that this was not the true contract for the king's murder, which Lethington had purloined, and now produced another in its place. The disputes became public, and Ran dolph, who felt indignant at the attack upon his old friend the regent Moray, addressed a remarkable letter to Cecil in his defence. \" Divers,\" said he, \" since the death of the late regent, some to cover their own doings, (how wicked soever they have been,) some to advance their own cause, grounded upon never so much injustice and untruth, seek to make the late regent odious to the world, spreading, after his death, such rumours of him as they think doth make most to their advantage towards their innocency in crimes that they are burdened with, and would fain be thought guiltless of; which is not only daily done here among them selves, but spread so far abroad as they think to find any man that will give credit either to their word or writing.\" He then continued, \" To name such as are yet here"], [154, "14s HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1570. living, most notoriously known to have been chief con sented to the king's death, I mind not ; only I will say, that the universal bruit cometh upon three or four persons, which subscribed into a ' band,' promising to concur and assist each other in doing the same. This band was kept in the castle, in a little coffer or desk, covered with green ; and after the apprehension of the Scottish queen at Carberry hill, was taken out of the place where it lay by the Laird of Liddington, in pre sence of Mr James Balfour, then clerk of the register, and keeper of the keys where the registers are. This being a thing so notoriously known, as well by Mr James Balfour's own report as the testimony of others that have seen the same, is utterly denied to be true, and another band produced, which they allege to be it, (containing no such matter, at the which, with divers other noblemen's hands, the regent's was also,) made a long time before the band of the king's murder was made : and now [they] say, that if it can be proved by any band that they consented unto the king's death, the late regent is as guilty as they; and for testimony thereof, as I am credibly informed [they] have sent a band to be seen in England, which is either some new band made among themselves, and the late regent's hand counterfeited at the same, (which in some other causes I know hath been done,) or the old band, at which his very own hand is, containing no such matter. \"Wherefore,\" continued Randolph to Cecil, \"knowing so much of his innocency in so horrible a crime, be sides the honour of so noble and worthy a personage, so dear a friend to the queen's majesty my sovereign, I am loath that, after his death, his adversaries should, by false report, abuse the honest and godly, especially her majesty, with such writings as they may either"], [155, "1570.

He had bitterly deplored the loss of Moray, and, aware of Mary's application for succour to the courts of Spain and France, two powers connected, in his mind, with every thing that was corrupt and idola- trous, he denounced her intrigues in the pulpit, and inveighed against her as a murderer and an adulteress, in his usual strain of passionate and personal invective. \" It has been objected against me,\" said he, \" that I have ceased to pray for my sovereign, and have used railing imprecations against her.

Notwithstanding some assistance in arms and money from France and Spain,2 and the incessant exertions of Grange and Lethington to keep 1 Bannatyne's Journal, pp. 109-112, inclusive. 2 Historie of James the Sext, pp. 62, 64."], [157, "1571. REGENCY OF LENNOX. 151 up the spirit of the queen's friends, it was evident that they were becoming exhausted under the long pro tracted struggle ; and the capture of Dunbarton castle by the regent, which occurred at this time, gave a severe shock to their fortunes. This exploit, for its extraordinary gallantry and success, deserves notice. The castle, as is well known, is strongly situated on a precipitous rock, which rises abruptly from the Clyde, at the confluence of the little river Leven with this noble estuary. It was com manded by Lord Fleming, who, from the beginning of the war, had kept it for the queen; and its importance was great, not only from its strength, which made many pronounce it impregnable, but because its situa tion on the Clyde rendered it at all times accessible to foreign ships, which brought supplies. Captain Crawford of Jordanhill, to whom the attack was intrusted, had been long attached to the house of Lennox. He was the same person whose evidence was so important regarding the death of Darnley, and who afterwards accused Lethington of participation in the murder, since which time he appears to have followed the profession of arms. In the enterprise he was assisted by Cunningham, commonly called the Laird of Drumwhassel, one of the bravest and most skilful officers of his time, and he had been fortunate in securing the assistance of a man named Robertson, who, having once been warder in the castle, knew every step upon the rock familiarly, and for a bribe consented to betray it. With this man, Crawford and his company marched from Glasgow after sunset. He had sent before him a few light horse, who prevented intelligence by stop ping all passengers, and arrived about midnight at Dumbuck, within a mile of the castle, where he was"], [158, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1571. 152 joined by Drumwhassel and Captain Hume, with a hundred men. Here he explained to the soldiers the hazardous service on which they were to be employed, provided them with ropes and scaling-ladders, and advancing with silence and celerity, reached the rock, the summit of which was fortunately involved in a heavy fog, whilst the bottom was clear. But on the first attempt all was likely to be lost. The ladders lost their hold, whilst the soldiers were upon them ; and had the garrison been on the alert the noise must inevitably have betrayed them. They listened, how ever, and all was still ; again their ladders were fixed, and this time their steel hooks catching firmly in the crevices, they gained a small jutting-out ledge, where an ash tree had struck its roots, which assisted them, as they fixed their ropes to its branches, and thus speedily towed up both the ladders and the rest of their companions. They were still, however, far from their object. They had reached but the middle of the rock, day was breaking, and when, for the second time, they placed their ladders, an extraordinary impediment occurred. One of the soldiers in ascending was seized with a fit, in which he convulsively grasped the steps so firmly, that no one could either pass him or unloose his hold. But Crawford's presence of mind suggested a ready expedient ; he tied him to the ladder, turned it, and easily ascended with the rest of his men. They were now at the bottom of the wall, where the footing was narrow and precarious ; but, once more fixing their ladders in the copestone, Alexander Ramsay, Craw ford's ensign, with two other soldiers, stole up, and though instantly discovered on the summit by the sentinel, who gave the alarm, leapt down and slew him, sustaining the attack of three of the guard till he"], [159, "1571. REGENCY OF LENNOX. 153 was joined by Crawford and his soldiers. Their weight, and struggles to surmount it, now brought down the old wall and afforded an open breach, through which they rushed in, shouting, \" a Darnley ! a Darnley !\" Crawford's watchword, given evidently from affection for his unfortunate master, the late king. The garrison were panic-struck, and did not attempt resistance ; Fleming the governor, from long familiarity with the place, managed to escape down the face of an almost perpendicular cleft or gully in the rock, and passing through a postern, which opened upon the Clyde, threw himself into a fishing-boat and passed over to Argyleshire.1 In this exploit the assailants did not lose a man, and of the garrison only four soldiers were slain. In the castle were taken prisoners, Hamilton the bishop of St Andrews, who was found with his mail shirt and steel cap on ;2 Verac the French ambassador, Fleming of Boghall, and John Hall, an English gentleman, who had fled to Scotland after Dacre's rebellion. Lady Fleming, the wife of the governor, was also taken, and treated by the regent with great courtesy, permitted to go free, and to carry off with her her plate and fur niture ; but Hamilton, the primate, was instantly brought to trial for the murder of the king and the late regent, condemned, hanged, and quartered, without delay. Of his being not only cognizant, but deeply implicated in both conspiracies, there seems little doubt ;3 but the rapidity with which the legal proceed- 1 Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 203.

The reformed clergy pointed to his fate as a judgment from heaven ; the people, who were aware of his corrupt life and profligate principles, rejoiced over it ; and this distich was fixed to the gallows on which he suffered : Cresce diu felix arbor, semperque vireto Frondibus, qui nobis talia poma feras. The loss of Dunbarton was a severe shock to the queen's cause. It gave a death-blow to all hopes of foreign aid ; and the regent advanced to Edinburgh with the determination of holding a parliament, col lecting his whole force, and at once putting an end to the struggle.1 Grange, however, still held out the castle, keeping the citizens of the capital who favoured the king's faction in constant terror, and affording a rallying point to the queen's friends. During the late truce he had been guilty of many excesses ; and on one occasion had broken the common prison, and res cued one of his soldiers who had stabbed a gentleman in the street. It was said, also, that he had carried off at the same time a woman, suspected of being cog nizant of the late regent's murder. F/pon hearing of the outrage, Cecil, his old friend, recently created Lord Burghley, remonstrated in indignant terms, expressing his horror, that one in his high command, and who had in former years of their intimacy been a professor of the Gospel, should be guilty of so flagrant a contempt Scrope, 10th April, 1 571 .

The concluding portion of his letter is remarkable: \u2014 \"How you will allow my plainness,\" said he, \" I know not ; but surely I should think myself guilty of blood, if I should not thoroughly mislike you ; and to this I must add, that I hear, but yet am loath to believe it, that your soldiers that broke the prison have not only taken out the murderer, your man, but a woman that was there detained as guilty of the lamentable death of the last good regent. \" Alas ! my lord, may this be true ? and with your help may it be conceived in thought that you, \u2014 you, I mean, that was so dear to the regent, should favour his murderers in this sort. Surely, my lord, if this be true, there is provided by God some notable work of his justice to be showed upon you; and yet I trust you are not so void of God's grace : and so for mine old friendship with you, and for the avoiding of the notable slander of God's word, I heartily wish it to be untrue. * * * I pray you commend me to my Lord of Ledington, of whom I have heard such things as I dare not believe of him, and yet his deeds make me afraid of his well doing.\" 1 This eloquent appeal of the English minister would have been well calculated to recall Grange to his duty, had he and Lethington not been aware that there were occasions when deeds of violence, and even assassina tion, did not excite, in his placid temper, such extreme feelings of abhorrence. In the meantime, Morton, Makgill, and the Abbot of Dunfermline, returned from their negotiations in England ; 2 and, on rejoining the regent, it was deter mined to resume hostilities with vigour. Lennox 1 Copy, State-paper Office, endorsed by Cecil himself, \" Copy of my letter to the Laird of Grange, 10th January, 1570-1.\" 8 19th April."], [162, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1571. 156 issued a summons for the whole force of the realm to meet him at Linlithgow on the 19th of May, and Morton concentrated at Dalkeith the troops which were in regular service and pay.1 Grange on his part was nothing intimidated. He had received money from Mary, who, although in captivity, contrived to keep a secret intercourse with her supporters ; about the same time a seasonable supply of a thousand crowns, with arms and ammunition, arrived from France.2 The Duke of Chastelherault joined him with three hundred horse and one hundred hagbutters. Lord Herries and Lord Maxwell entered the capital with two hundred and forty horse ; Fernyhirst soon followed them ; and the castle was so strong in its garrison and its fortifications, that he regarded the motions of his opponents with little anxiety. On the 9th of May, Lennox and Morton, having united their forces, encamped at Leith, and erected a small battery on a spot called the Dow Craig,3 above the Trinity Church, with the object of commanding the Canongate, a principal street of the city. Here, whilst the cannon of the castle opened upon them, they as sembled to hold their parliament, which was nume rously attended, and fulminated a sentence of forfeiture against Lethington, his brother Thomas Maitland, and others of the most obnoxious of their opponents. Having hurried through these proceedings, they broke up their assembly, and abandoned the siege, whilst Grange immediately held a rival parliament in the queen's name, and attacked his enemies with their own weapons.4 It is impossible to conceive a more miserable 1 Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 209. 2 Ibid, p 211 3 The Pigeon's Rock, 4 Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 215.

REGENCY OF LENNOX. 157 spectacle than that presented at this moment by the country and the capital : the country torn and desola ted by the struggles of two exasperated factions, whose passions became every day more fierce and implacable, so that the very children fought under the name of king's and queen's men ;J the capital in a state of siege ; whilst the wretched citizens, placed between the fires of the castle and the camp of the regent, were compelled to intermit their peaceful labours, and either to serve under the queen's banner, or to join Lennox, and have their property confiscated. Two hundred chose this last severe alternative, and fled to the camp at Leith, upon which Grange passionately deposed the provost and magistrates, and placed Kerr of Ferny hirst, a fierce and powerful border chief, in the civic chair, with a council of his retainers to act as bailies.2 Amid these transactions, Sir William Drury, the marshal of Berwick, had been sent by Elizabeth to open negotiations with the leaders of the two factions, and, if possible, to bring about a pacification. Such, at least, was the avowed object of his mission ; but the court of England have been accused by Sir James Melvil of acting at this moment with great duplicity.3 The various ministers whom they sent into Scotland, if we may believe this writer, a man of character, and intimately acquainted with the times and the actors, were instructed to widen rather than to heal the wounds of the country ; and it is certain that Drury 's con ferences with Kirkaldy, Morton, and Lennox, were followed by fiercer struggles than before. Nor were English intrigue, and the jealous or selfish passions of the rival factions, the only causes of the continuance 1 Crawford, p. 179. 2 Diurnal, p. 226. 3 Melvil's Memoirs, p. 240.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 158 of this unhappy state of things : fanaticism added her horrors to the war; and the reformed clergy, by a refusal to pray for the queen, inflamed the resentment of her friends, and gave an example of rancour to the people. Knox, their great leader, had some time before declared his determination never to acknowledge her authority, and no longer to supplicate God for her welfare.1 On the entry of his enemies, the Hamiltons, into the capital, he had been compelled to a precipitate retreat ; 2 but his flight was followed by more resolute measures on the part of the Kirk and the clergy, an assembly being convoked some time after at Stirling, which confirmed his judgment and reiterated their refusal.3 Grange now determined to hold a parliament in Edinburgh, whilst the regent and the king's lords resolved to assemble the three estates in Stirling. On the queen's side, sentences of forfeiture and treason were pronounced against Lennox the regent, Morton, and Mar, the Lords Lindsay, Hay, Cathcart, Glam mis, Ochiltree, Makgill clerk-register, the Bishop of Orkney, and a long list of the king's faction, amount ing nearly to two hundred persons.4 The assembly, however, which was only attended by two of the spiri tual and three of the higher temporal lords, was scarcely entitled to the name of a parliament.5 On the other hand, their opponents, with a greater attendance of the nobility, and a more solemn state, met at Stirling. Here the young king, then an infant of five years, was 1 Diurnal of Occurrents, p. 225. Historie of James the Sext, p. 93. Bannatyne's Journal, p. 98. 2 Historie of James the Sext, p. 75.

The little king, in a pause of the proceedings, turning to his governor, asked him, what house they were sitting in ? On being answered, that it was called the parliament house, he looked up to the roof, and pointing to a small aperture which his quick eye had detected, observed, that there was a hole in that parliament. People smiled, but the superstitious declared that it augured disaster to the regent, whose death occurred only five days after,3 in an enterprise which seemed likely at first to have brought the war on Grange's side to a fortunate and glorious conclusion. This able soldier, having learnt the insecurity with which the regent and his friends were quartered at Stirling, concluded that it would not be difficult, by a rapid night march, to surprise the city.

Their force consisted of sixty mounted hagbutters and three hundred and forty border horse ; and as Bell had been born in Stirling, and knew every lane and alley, no better guide could have been chosen. This little force rode out of Edinburgh in the evening of the 3d of September, some horsemen having been previously sent to the ferry and other parts between Stirling and the capital, to arrest all passengers and prevent any information being carried there.1 They first took the road towards Peebles, and it was reported in the enemy's camp at Leith, that they meditated an attack upon Jedburgh. Favoured by the night, how ever, they wheeled off in the direction of Stirling ; and having left their horses about a mile from that city, entered it on foot by a secret passage in the gray of the morning, before the inhabitants were stirring. So complete was the surprise, that they occupied every street without difficulty;2 broke up the noblemen's houses ; and in an incredibly short time took prisoners, the regent himself, the Earls of Morton, Glencairn, Argyle, Cassillis, Eglinton, Montrose, and Buchan,with the Lords Semple, Cathcart, and Ochiltree. These were placed under a guard in their houses, and at this moment, had the borderers kept together, the victory was complete ; but the Liddesdale men went to the spoil, emptied the stables of their horses, broke up the merchants' booths, encumbered themselves with booty, 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, from Scotland, a spy to Lord Burghley, 5th September, 1571.

Morton, before he was taken, had block aded his house, and refusing to surrender till it was set on fire, his resistance gave the townsmen time to recover themselves. Mar, in the meantime, rushing from the castle with forty soldiers, commenced a fire from an unfinished lodging, which still fronts the High Street, and drove Huntley and Buccleuch, with their prisoners, from the market-place to another quarter, where they were assailed by the citizens on all sides ; whilst Lennox, Morton, and the rest of the noblemen, so lately captives, snatched up such weapons as were at hand in the confusion, and soon put their enemies to flight. In the midst of this confusion and struggle, Captain Calder, rendered furious by the disappointment, de termined that the regent, at least, should not escape, and coming up behind, shot him through the back. Lennox had been made prisoner by Spens of Wormis ton; and this brave and generous man, perceiving Calder's cruel intention, threw himself between them, and received the same shot in his body, and was then hacked to pieces by the soldiers, Lennox faintly im ploring them to spare one who had risked his life in his defence. Calder afterwards confessed, that he was instigated to this savage deed by Lord Claud Hamilton and Huntley, before they took the town, in revenge for the death of the Archbishop of St Andrews, whose ignominious execution the Hamiltons had sworn to visit to the uttermost upon the regent.

The loss would have been much greater, but that the Liddesdale and Teviotdale borderers had stolen every hoof within the town, and not a horse could be found to give the chase. It was certainly, even with its half success, a daring exploit ; and Grange, in a letter written a few days after, whilst he deplored the fate of the regent, could not refrain from some expressions of exultation. \" In their parliament time, (said he,) when all their lords, being twenty earls and lords, spiritual and temporal, were convened in their principal strength, wherein there were above two thousand men, three hundred of ours entered among them, were masters of the town, at least for the space of three hours, might have slain the whole noblemen if they had pleased, and retired themselves in the end with a rich booty, and without any harm.\"2 The unfortunate regent was able to keep his seat on horseback till he entered the castle of Stirling, but the first view of his wound convinced every one that it was mortal ; and his own feelings telling him he had but a few hours to live, he 1 Second examination of Bell, State-paper Office, 6th September, 1571. \"George Bell * * being put to pains, declares he came running down the gate for Huntley and Claud, and cried ' shoot, the regent ! the traitor is coming upon us, and ye will not get him away.'

For his servants, they knew he had been cut off before he could reward them, so he must leave their recompense to his friends ; for himself, he would only ask their prayers ; and for my poor wife Meg, said he, turning to Mar and wringing his hand, you, my lord, must remember me lovingly to her, and do your best for her comfort.1 He died that same evening, the 4th of September, and on the succeeding day, the Earl of Mar, governor to the young king, was chosen regent. His competitors for the office were Argyle, whom Morton had induced to join the king's faction, and Morton himself, who was supported by English influence ; but the majority declared for Mar, whose character for honesty in these profligate times stood higher than that of any of the nobles.2 On his accession to the supreme power, Mar con fidently hoped, that by a judicious mixture of vigour and conciliation, he should be able to reduce the op posite faction, and restore peace to the country;3 but the difficulties he had to contend against were infinitely more complicated than he anticipated.

This daring and crafty man, who was the slave of ambition, knew well that his best chance of securing the supreme power lay in keeping up the commotions of the country; and in this perfidious effort he received rather countenance than opposi- tion from the government of England. So successful were his efforts, that for some months after Mar's accession to the regency, and during the siege of the capital, the war assumed an aspect of unexampled ferocity. In the midst of all this misery, the supporters of the captive queen were generally successful. Mar had been compelled to abandon the siege of Edinburgh, and now sent an earnest petition for assistance from Eliza beth.2 In the north, Adam Gordon of Auchendown,3 Huntley's brother, defeated the king's adherents in repeated actions, and brought the whole of the country under Mary's obedience.4 Gordon's talents for war 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Berwick, 9th October, 1571, Drury to Burghley.

REGENCY OF MAR. 165 were of the first order, and in his character we find a singular mixture of knightly chivalry, with the ferocity of the highland freebooter. Of the first, he exhibited a striking instance at Brechin, where, after a total defeat given to the Earl of Buchan, he generously dis missed nearly two hundred prisoners, most of them gentlemen, without ransom or exchange. Of his ven geance, a dreadful example was given in his burning the castle of Towie, with its unfortunate mistress, the Lady Forbes, and her whole household, thirty seven in number. In her husband's absence, she had undertaken its defence, and too rashly defied him from the battlements. Such a combination as that exhibited by Gordon was no unfrequent production in these dark and sanguinary times.1 Meanwhile, in England, was discovered a new in trigue of the Duke of Norfolk for his marriage with the Scottish queen. This nobleman had been liberated from the Tower, under the most solemn promises to forsake all intercourse with Mary ; but his ambition overmastered both prudence and honour, and he had again embarked deeply with the Bishop of Ross and other friends of the captive princess, in their schemes for her restoration and marriage. It was not to be expected that the English queen should again pardon so dangerous an attempt, and her animosity was roused to the highest pitch when she discovered the skill with which the plot had been carried on, its ramifications with her own Roman Catholic subjects, its favourable reception by the courts of France and Spain, and the undiminished spirit and enterprise of Mary. Norfolk 1 Historie of James the Sext, pp. 97, 111.

To obtain this, however, she was unwilling to incur the expense of an army, or the risk of a defeat. And by her orders, Sir William Drury the marshal of Berwick, and Lord Hunsdon the governor, began a correspondence with Grange, with the object of bring ing him to terms. Lord Burghley, also, after a silence of two years, sent a friendly message to Lethington, and the secretary seemed rejoiced that their inter course was renewed. He lamented their interrupted friendship, expressed satisfaction that some seeds of love yet remained, and trusted they would still pro duce either flower or fruit. To go into all the history of these sad times, he said, or of his conduct in them, would be as tedious as to declare, \" Bellum Trojamim ab Ovo ;\" but this he would say, that since the be ginning of their acquaintance, he had reverenced him as a father, and followed his counsels as of the dearest friend he had. As to Drury's messages, the matters they had to treat of were such as related to honour, duty, and surety ; no light subjects. They proposed, therefore, to send a special messenger to the queen's majesty, to inform her particularly of their intentions, and, in return, expected that she would grant a com mission either to Drury or some other person, who should be empowered to conclude a treaty with them.1 This high tone appears to have disgusted Elizabeth : Drury's letters led to no satisfactory result ; and Lord 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Lethington to Burghley, castle of Edinburgh, 26th October, 1571."], [173, "1571-2. REGENCY OF MAR. jgfl Hunsdon, after a tedious correspondence, was equally unsuccessful. He was instructed to bring over the queen's faction either by negotiation or by force ; but when Grange discovered that he had no commission from his royal mistress to bind her by any positive agreement, he wisely rejected his offers ; and as the force of which he talked did not appear to be forth coming, totally disregarded his threats. There is, indeed, every reason to believe that Elizabeth's chief object at this moment in the negotiations with Mary's supporters was, to ascertain their exact strength, and the practicability of reducing the kingdom under the king's obedience.1 Meanwhile, owing to the season of the year, for winter was commencing, she determined to delay all hostilities, and permit the rival factions to exhaust each other, confident that her interest would not materially suffer by the delay. Nor were her hopes in this disappointed. For many miserable months Scotland presented a sight which might have drawn pity from the hardest heart : her sons engaged in a furious and constant butchery of each other;2 every peaceful or useful art entirely at a stand ; her agriculture, her com merce and manufactures,neglected; nothing heard,from one end of the country to the other, but the clangour of arms and the roar of artillery ; nothing seen but villages in flames, towns beleaguered by armed men, women and children flying from the cottages where their fathers or husbands had been massacred, and even 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Berwick, 10th November, 1571, Hunsdon to the Lairds of Lethington and Grange ; and, also, copy of the time, State-paper Office, Grange and Lethington to Hunsdon, Edinburgh castle, 9th December, 1571. 2 Ibid.

Into all the separate facts which would support this dreadful picture I must not enter, nor would I willingly conduct my reader through the shambles of a civil war : prisoners were tortured or massacred in cold blood, or hung by forties and fifties at a time ; countrymen driving their carts, or attempt ing to sell their stores in the city, were hanged or branded with a hot iron ; women coming to market were seized and scourged ; and as the punishment did not prevent repetition of the offence, one delinquent, who ventured to retail her country produce, was bar barously hanged in her own village near the city.1 These are homely details, but they point to much intensity of national misery, and made so deep an impression, that the period, taking its name from Morton, was long after remembered as the days of the \" Douglas wars.\" When we consider the aggregate of human misery and guilt which such a state of things supposes, it is impossible to withhold our abhorrence at the cold blooded policy which, for its own ends, could foster its continuance. Yet at this moment Elizabeth appears to have secured the services of Morton by a pension, and these services were wholly directed to oppose every effort made by the regent to restore peace to the coun try.2 His principle was, never to sheath the sword till his enemies had unconditionally surrendered, and the cause of the captive queen should be rendered utterly hopeless. 1 The village of West Edmonston.

The efforts of Gordon in the north, and Kirkaldy and Lethington in the capital, exhibited no signs of feeble ness. Even the shocking severities I have mentioned of Morton, produced little other feelings than execra tions against their author ; and before the middle of summer, 1572, the affairs of the queen were once more in a prosperous condition. Gordon had completely triumphed in the north ; x her supporters were masters of the principal city and the strongest fortress in the kingdom ; they had been repeatedly supplied with money, arms, and ammunition, by France and Spain, and of the continued assistance of the latter, at least, had no reason to despair.2 They had defeated Lord Semple in the west ; their arms, under Fernyhirst, had carried all before them in the south ; it was evident, from her long delays, that the Queen of England had some invincible repugnance to send any force to bom bard the castle of Edinburgh ; and if she did, they were in want of nothing for their defence ; whilst their garrisons of Niddry, Livingston, and Blackness,3 amply supplied them with provisions. At this crisis, Elizabeth, who looked with alarm upon the increasing strength of her opponents, pro posed a truce for two months, preparatory, as she said, to the conclusion of a general peace, on terms which should secure the honour and safety of the queen's supporters. The negotiations were managed by Sir William Drury and the French ambassador, De Croc, 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Drury to Lord Hunsdon, Restalrig, 9th July, 1572. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Randolph and Drury to Lord Huns don, 26th February, 1571-2.

It seems strange that so able a statesman as Lethington, and one so intimately acquainted with the duplicity of the English queen, should on this occasion have been prevailed upon to consent to a measure which ultimately proved the ruin of his mistress's cause.1 But he and Grange had been branded by their oppo nents as men of blood, who had obstinately refused to give a breathing time to their bleeding and exhausted country, and to confute the aspersion they agreed to the truce. It was signed on the 30th of July, and contained an express provision, that, as soon as might be, the nobility and estates of the realm should assem ble to deliberate upon a general peace. On the same day the truce was proclaimed in the capital, amid the shouts and joy of the inhabitants, and the now harm less thunder of the ordnance of the castle. Having thus suffered themselves to be overreached by their crafty opponents, Kirkaldy and Lethington were not long allowed to be ignorant of their fatal blunder. Mar the regent was indeed sincere, but he was completely controlled by Morton. This ambitious man now ruled the council at his will : he successfully thwarted every effort to assemble the estates, or deli berate upon a general pacification ; and, unfortunately for Scotland, a calamity occurred at this moment which struck all Europe with horror, and produced the most fatal effects upon any negotiations with which Mary 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Lethington and Grange to my Lord Ambassador of England, Edinburgh castle, 13th July, 1572.

Five hundred Protestant geutlemen and men of rank, and about ten thousand of inferior condition, were butchered in cold blood ; the greater part in the capital of France, where the king himself, it was reported, directed the assassins, looking from the windows of his palace upon the miserable victims who fled from their assailants.2 In the provinces the same dreadful scenes were repeated ; and when the news arrived in England, communicated by Walsing ham, Elizabeth's ambassador at the court of Charles the Ninth, the suddenness of the shock electrified the whole country. Grief, pity, and indignation, shook the national mind as if it had been that of one man. When Fenelon, the French ambassador, presented himself at the palace, he found the queen and the court clad in mourning. He was received in silence ; the stillness of the grave, as he himself described it, seemed to reign in the apartments ; the queen, indeed, endeavoured to preserve her equanimity, and although deeply sorrowful, received him without complaint ; but the courtiers, fixing their eyes on the ground, refused to notice his greeting. Instead of a palace, he seemed to have entered a chamber of death, where men were met to mourn for their dearest friends.3 But sorrow and indignation were not the only, or 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

She had, indeed, recently concluded a league with France ; yet this, though it restrained the outward violence, did not diminish the intensity of her feelings. Fears for her own life, and terror for the result of those dark plots which she had already repeatedly detected and severely punished, perpetually haunted her imagination, and shook even her strong and masculine mind. Of these conspiracies Mary was the centre ; she was engaged in a perpetual correspondence with the court of Rome ; with France, whose name could not now he uttered without calling up images of horror ; with Spain, where Philip and the Duke of Alva, men hated by the Protestants, had recently lent her the most effectual assistance ; and, what was more alarming to Elizabeth than all, the recent trial of Norfolk, and the confessions of the Bishop of Ross, now a prisoner in the Tower, had convinced her, that as long as the Scottish queen remained in England, the minds of her Roman Catholic subjects would be kept in perpetual agitation ; that no perma nent tranquillity could be reasonably expected, and that, judging by the recent excesses in France, her own life might not be secure. It is impossible to blame such feelings or such con clusions. They were natural and inevitable ; yet here let it not be forgotten, that the terrors of the English queen are to be traced to an act of flagrant injustice. She had seized and imprisoned Mary contrary to every principle of the law of nations, to the promises she had given, to the commonest feelings of humanity; and her present thorny anxieties for her life and crown were a just retribution for such conduct. Making, however, every allowance for the fears of her council and her people, and the attachment of her great minister,"], [179, "1568. REGENCY OF MAR. 173 Burghley, we are scarcely prepared for the calmness with which the death of the Scottish queen was re commended by the House of Commons, and strongly urged by Cecil. Elizabeth, however, would not listen to their arguments, and at last peremptorily put an end to their consultations.1 She had already publicly declared, that there had been no sufficient evidence exhibited against Mary by those who accused her of the death of her husband ; and to bring her to trial in England, or to cause her to be publicly put to death without trial, would, she felt, be equally unjust and odious. She accordingly contented herself, after the death of Norfolk, with sending Lord De la Ware, Sir R. Sadler, and Bromley her solicitor-general, to in terrogate the Scottish queen regarding her political connexion with that unfortunate man, and to remon strate against any continuation of her intrigues.2 On this occasion Mary, although plunged in grief for the recent execution of the duke, was roused by the harsh ness of the messengers to a spirited vindication of her rights as a free princess. Some of the allegations she admitted, some she palliated, others she peremptorily denied, and the interview led, and was probably in tended to lead, to no definite result. But if Elizabeth abandoned all thoughts of bring ing her royal prisoner to a public trial, and putting her to death in England, it was only to embrace a 1 The English bishops, in answer to a question of Burghley 's, had given it as their opinion, that Elizabeth might lawfully put Mary to death, and justified their sentence by reasons of Scripture taken from the Old Testament.

The plot was an extraordinary one, and its details, upon which I now enter, are new to this part of our history. Previous to the massacre of St Bartholomew, and after the failure of the negotiations for peace in Scotland, which were conducted by the French am bassador De Croc, and Sir William Drury, Elizabeth had resolved to send a new envoy to that country, with the object of watching over the English interests. When the dreadful news arrived from France, Burgh ley and Leicester pressed upon the English queen the necessity of instant attention to her safety on the side of Scotland, and Mr Henry Killigrew was selected to proceed thither.1 He was instructed to negotiate both with Mar the regent and the opposite faction led by Lethington and Grange ; to exhort both sides to observe the late truce : to give them the details of the late horrible massacre, expressing the queen's conviction that it was premeditated; and to implore them to be on their guard. Such was his public mission, but shortly before he set out, Killigrew was informed that a far greater matter was to be intrusted to his management, that it was to be conducted with the utmost secrecy, and was known to none but Elizabeth, Leicester, and Burghley.2 In an interview with the queen herself, to which none were admitted but these two lords, he received his instructions, which remain drawn up by Cecil in his own hand.3 It was explained to him, 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, copy, August, 1572. Instructions to Henry Killigrew touching the troubles in Scotland, being sent thither after the great murder that was in France. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Killigrew to Burghley and Leicester November 23, 1572. 3 Murdin, p. 224."], [181, "1572. REGENCY OF MAR. 175 that it had at last become absolutely necessary to execute the Scottish queen, and that, unless the realm were delivered of her, the life of Elizabeth was no longer safe. This might, indeed, be done in England, but for some good respects, it was thought better that she should be sent to Scotland, and delivered to the regent and his party, \" to proceed with her by way of justice.\"1 To accomplish this must depend, it was said, upon his skilful management. He must frame matters so, that the offer must come from them, not from the English queen. This would probably not be difficult, for they had already many times before, under the former regents, made proposals of this nature. If such an offer were again made, he was now empowered to agree to it ; but it must be upon the most solemn assurance, that she should be put to death without fail, and that neither England nor Scotland should be endangered by her hereafter : for otherwise, it was added, to have her and to keep her, would be of all other ways the most dangerous.2 If, however, he could contrive it so that the regent or Morton should secretly apply to some of the lords of the English council, to have her given up, now was the best time ; only, it was repeated, it must be upon absolute surety that she should receive what she de served, and that no further peril could ever possibly occur, either by her escape, or by setting her up again. 1 Dr Robertson notices the paper in Murdin, and severely condemns this proposal of Elizabeth. This eminent writer interprets it, as if the queen had desired the Scottish regent to bring Mary to a public trial, and, if condemnation followed, to execute her. It seems to me clear, however, that the words, \"proceed with her by way of justice,\" when taken with the context, can bear but one meaning, the same meaning in which Leicester employs the phrase, in his letter in the Proofs and Illustrations, No. III. \u2014 that of executing her summarily and without delay. See Dr Lingard, vol. viii. p. 118. \u2022 Murdin, p. 224."], [182, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1572. 176 To make certain of this, hostages must be required by him, and those of the highest rank, that is to say, children or near kinsfolk of the regent and the Earl of Morton. Last of all, he was solemnly reminded that the queen's name must not appear in the transac tion ; and Elizabeth herself, in dismissing him, bade him remember that none but Leicester, Burghley, and himself, were privy to the great and delicate charge which was now laid upon him, adding a caution, that if it \" came forth,\" or was ever known, he must answer for it. To this Killigrew replied, \" that he would keep the secret as he would his life;\" and immediately set out on his journey.1 On entering Scotland, his first visit was to Tantal lon, Morton's castle, where that nobleman was confined by sickness : but the ambassador received from him the strongest assurances of devotedness to the young king his sovereign, and to Elizabeth, whose interests he believed to be the same. Knox had returned again to Edinburgh, and the recent news of the massacre in France was producing the strongest excitement. On repairing to Stirling to meet the regent, he passed through the capital, and encountered there his old friend Sir James Melvil, from whom he understood something of the state of the Castilians,2 as the queen's party were now called ; and, in his subsequent inter view with Mar, he found him expressing himself de cidedly against any intimate alliance with France, and determined, so long as he had any hope of effectual assistance from England, never to connect himself with a foreign power. So far all was favourable; but it was 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Killigrew to Burghley and Leices ter, November 23, 1572. 2 Castilians, so called, from their having possession of the castle.

REGENCY OF MAR. 177 evident to Killigrew, that, without additional forces, which he well knew Elizabeth would be unwilling to send, the regent could never make himself master of the castle. These, and similar particulars connected with his public mission, he communicated, as he had been pre viously instructed, to the secretary of state ; but his proceedings in the other great and secret matter touch ing Mary, were contained in letters addressed to Cecil and Leicester jointly, and he appears to have lost no time in entering upon it. He informed them, in a despatch on the 19th of September, that he had already \" dealt with a fit instrument, and expected that the regent and the Earl of Morton would soon break their minds unto him secretly.\" x The instrument thus selected to manage the secret and speedy execution of the unhappy Mary was Mr Nicholas Elphinston, a dependant of the late Regent Moray, and who, from an expression of Killigrew, appears to have been on a former occasion employed in a similar negotiation. Matters, however, were not expedited with that rapidity which Burghley deemed necessary ; and this minister, although assured by his agent that he could not for his life make more speed than he had done, determined to urge him forward. For this purpose he addressed to him a letter, jointly from himself and Leicester. In reading it as it still exists, in the original draft in Cecil's hand, with its erasures and cor rections, it is striking to remark the contrast between its cold and measured style, and the cruel purpose which it advocates. It was written from Windsor, and ran thus : \u2014 \" After our hearty commendations, we two have 1 MS. letter, British Museum, Caligula, C. iii. sol. 365, Killigrew to Burghley, September 19, 1572.

The picture given of this extraordinary man by Killigrew, in a letter addressed to Cecil and Leicester, written on the 6th of October, in reply to theirs of the 29th of Septem ber, is very striking. \" I trust,\" said he, \" to satisfy Morton ; and as for John Knox, that thing, you may see by my despatch to Mr Secretary, is done, and doing daily : the people in general well bent to Eng land, abhorring the fact in France, and fearing their tyranny.

He doth reverence your lord ship much, and willed me once again to send you word, that he thanked God he had obtained at his hands that the gospel of Jesus Christ is truly and simply preached through Scotland, which doth so comfort him as now he desireth to be out of this miserable life.

He desired me to make his last commendations most humbly unto your lordship, and withal, that he prayed God to increase his strong spirit in you, saying, that there was never more need.\" 1 It was, no doubt, by Knox's advice that proclama tion was made, on the 3d of October, for a convention of the \" professors of the true religion,\" to consult upon the dangers resulting from the conspiracies of the papists. To the sheet on which it was printed, there were added certain heads or articles, said to be extracts from the secret contract between the pope, the emperor, and the Kings of Spain and Portugal, for the extirpa tion of the Protestant faith ; 2 and Killigrew believed that all these preliminaries would prepare the mind of the people for any extremities that might be used against their unhappy sovereign. Meanwhile his tool, the Abbot of Dunfermline, was secretly trafficking with Morton and the regent, and so far succeeded, that on the 9th of October a conference on the proposedexecution of Mary was held atDalkeith, in Morton's bed-chamber, he being still confined by sickness. None were present but the Regent Mar and Killigrew, who immediately communicated the result to Cecil and Leicester in the following letter : \"My singular good lords \u2014 What has past here since my last, touching the common cause, I have written to Mr Secretary at length. \" Now for the great matter ye wot of.

They told me, notwithstanding, the matter was dangerous, and might come so to pass, as they should draw war upon their heads ; and in that case, or rather to stop that peril, they would desire her majesty should enter in league defensive, compre hending therein the cause of religion also. \" We came,\" he continued, \" to nearer terms, to wit, that her majesty should, for a certain time, pay the sum that her highness bestoweth for the keeping of her in England, to the preservation of this crown, and take the protection of the young king. All this I heard ; and said, if they thought it not profitable for them, and that, if they meant not to will me to write earnestly as their desire, I would not move my pen for the matter ; whereat the Earl of Morton raised himself in his bed, and said, that both my lord regent and he did desire it, as a sovereign salve for all their sores : howbeit, it could not be done without some man ner of ceremony, and a kind of process, whereunto the noblemen must be called after a secret manner, and the clergy likewise, which would ask some time. Also, that it would be requisite her majesty should send such a convoy with the party, that in case there were people would not like of it, they might be able to keep the field ; adding, farther, that if they can bring the nobility to consent, as they hope they shall, they will not keep the prisoner three hours alive, after he come into the bounds of Scotland.1 But I, leaving of these devices, desired to know, indeed, what they would have me write ; and it was answered, that I should know farther 1 Sic in original^"], [188, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1572. 182 of my lord regent's grace here. So as this morning, a little before dinner, going to take my leave of him, as he was going towards Stirling, he told me, touching that matter which was communed upon at Dalkeith, he found it very good, and the best remedy for all diseases, and willed me so to write unto your honours ; nevertheless, that it was of great weight, and therefore he would advise him of the form and manner how it might best be brought to pass, and that known, he would confer more at length with me in the same. Thus took I my leave of him, and find him, indeed, more cold than Morton, and yet seemed glad and de sirous to have it come to pass.\" x Killigrew proceeded to say, in the same letter, that some were of opinion the queen could not be executed without the meeting of parliament, which might be called suddenly, and under pretence of some other business. The reason assigned was, that the Scottish queen had only been condemned as worthy of deposi tion on the ground of her accession to the murder of her husband ; she had not yet been judged to die.2 This proposition met with no encouragement from the English envoy ; a clear proof that a secret and speedy death was the object desired by Elizabeth. The pro posal was, as he hinted, an excuse to delay time, and to agree to it would have been to act contrary to his instructions. The conclusion of his letter I must give in his own words : \u2014 \" Although there be that do assure me that the regent hath, after a sort, moved this matter to nine of the best of their party, to wit, that it were fit to make 1 MS. letter, Caligula, C. iii. sol. 373, 374, Killigrew to Burghley and Leicester, 9th October, 1572. 2 MS. letter, British Museum, Caligula, C. iii. sol. 374, 375, Killi grew to Lords Burghley and Leicester, October 9, 1572."], [189, "1572.

Measures were to be taken to have the sentence pronounced, (if, indeed, any ceremony of a sentence was seriously con templated,) and the execution hurried over with the utmost expedition and economy : and the only cause of delay on the part of the regent and his brother earl, was the selfish wish of making the most profit of this cruel bargain.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 184 matter,\" but \" the two ministers \" equally eager in the business. From the cautious manner in which the English envoy wrote, the names of these two ministers are suppressed, and in such a case conjecture is un satisfactory. We know that Mr Nicholas Elphinston, and Pitcairn the Abbot of Dunfermline, were the in struments already employed by Morton and Killigrew in this dark negotiation, and it is possible that they are here meant. Two other facts also are certain, from a letter of the English envoy : the one, that Cecil had enjoined him to avail himself of the co-operation of the Kirk in accomplishing the objects of his negotiation ; the other, that he had already consulted John Knox, who, even in \" extreme debility,\" and, as he describes it, \" with one foot in the grave,\" was in mind as active as ever. From a letter already quoted, we have seen his convictions of Mary's guilt, and wishes for her execution; he may, therefore, have been one of the ministers to whom allusion was made. But this is speculation ; and, after all, it might be argued, that from the words of Killigrew, the matter he spoke of to Knox was not the execution of Mary, as the former private interview may have solely related to the best method of exciting the people against France and the Catholic faction in Scotland. However this may be, the English ambassador was informed by Morton, that if Mar showed coldness, or delayed to execute the matter, it should be done without him; and he added, that as he was lieu tenant-general of the whole kingdom on this side Tay, he had power to carry it into execution.1 He hinted, however, that if Elizabeth hoped to gain this great object, she must be more cordial in her support, and 1 MS. letter, British Museum, Caligula, C. iii. sol. 376, Killigrew to Burghley and Leicester, ]3th October, 1572."], [191, "1572.

To this Killigrew shrewdly replied, that if Morton could at this moment have given some good assurance that Mary should be executed, or, as he expressed it in his dark language, for the performance \" of the great matter,\" then he might safely reckon on the Queen of England for the satisfying his desires : but he must recollect, that its accomplishment was the sole ground on which a de fensive league between the two countries could be ne gotiated. Without it \"a man could promise nothing.\"1 From the ambassador's next letter, however, any anticipated coldness or disinclination on the part of Mar appears to have entirely vanished. It was written from Stirling, and informed Burghley and Leicester, that the after some general observations on the subject of the peace, began to speak, \" touching the great matter, wherein,\" said he, \" I found him very earnest.\" \" He had sent,\" he said, \" his resolute mind to the Lord Morton by the abbot, and desired him (Killigrew) to write speedily to Burghley and Leices ter, that they might further the same by all possible means, as the only salve for the cure of the great sores of the commonwealth.\" \" I perceive,\" added Killigrew, \" that the regent's first coldness grew rather for want of skill how to compass so great a matter, than for lack of good will to execute the same. He desired me also to write unto your honours to be suitors unto your majesty for some relief of money towards the payment of his soldiers.\"2 1 MS. letter, British Museum, Caligula, C. iii. sol. 376,\u00bbKilligrew to Burghley and Leicester, 13th October, 1572. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Killigrew to Burghley and Leicester, 19th October, 1572, Stirling."], [192, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1572. 186 It is very striking, that in the midst of these dark practices, and when he had not only consented to Mary's death, but pressed that it should be speedy, Mar was himself struck with mortal sickness, and died at Stirling on the 28th of October, within ten days after his interview with the English ambassador.1 Previous to this event, however, he and Morton had sent to Killigrew, by the Abbot of Dunfermline, the conditions on which they were ready to rid Elizabeth of her rival. They stipulated, that the Queen of Eng land should take the young king their sovereign under her protection ; they demanded a declaration from the English parliament, that his rights should not be prejudged by any sentence or process against his mother ; they required that there should be a defen sive league between England and Scotland ; and that the Earls of Huntingdon, Bedford, or Essex, accom panied with two or three thousand of her majesty's men of war, should assist at the execution. These troops were afterwards to join the young king's forces in reducing the castle of Edinburgh. This fortress, when recovered from the enemy, was to be delivered to the regent, and all arrears then due to the Scottish forces were to be paid by England. With these conditions Killigrew was grievously disappointed. He instantly, however, sent them by Captain Arrington, a confidential messenger, to Burgh ley, accompanied by a letter, in which he mentioned Mar's extreme danger, but gave some little hope of life. At the moment, however, when this was written at Edinburgh, the regent had expired at Stirling, and Burghley received the account of his death, and the \" Articles of agreement, touching the great matter,\" 1 See Proofs and Illustrations, No. V. Letter of Killigrew on the death of Mar."], [193, "1572. REGENCY OF MAR. 187 almost at the same instant. Although commonly of a calm and collected temper, his agitation on the present occasion seems to have been extreme. The articles themselves were such as he had little expected \u2014 the price of blood demanded by the Scottish earls was unreasonably high ; and he felt indignant at Killigrew, that he should ever have received such proposals. But even if it had not been so, the death of Mar rendered it impossible to carry them into execution with the speed the necessity required ; and he immediately wrote to Leicester, informing him of the total failure of their Scottish project, and emphati cally remarking, that the queen must now fall back upon her last resource for the safety of herself and her kingdom. What this was, he shrunk from stating in express words, but he knew that Leicester could supply them ; aud there is not the slightest doubt that he alluded to the execution of Mary in England. His letter, however, is too characteristic to be omitted. It is wholly in his own hand. \" My Lord, \u2014 This bearer came to me an hour and a-h[alf] after your departure. The letters which he brought me are here included. I now see the queeu's majesty hath no surety but as she hath been counselled, for this way that was meant for dealing with Scotland is, you may see, neither now possible, nor was by their articles made reasonable. If her majesty will continue her delays, for providing for her own surety by just means given to her by God, she and we all shall vainly call upon God when the calamity shall fall upon us. God send her majesty strength of spirit to preserve God's cause, her own life, and the lives of millions of good subjects, all which are most manifestly in danger, and that only by her delays : and so, consequently, she"], [194, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1572. 188 shall be the cause of the overthrow of a noble crown and realm, which shall be a prey to all that can invade it. God be merciful to us.\"1 Thus was Burghley and Leicester's project for Mary's secret execution by the hands of her own subjects de stroyed by the death of Mar, at the moment he had consented to it ; and the scheme which these cruel and unscrupulous politicians conceived themselves to have so deeply laid, on which they pondered, as Cecil owned, \" daily and almost hourly,\" entirely discomfited and cast to the winds. Mary in the meantime was herself unconscious of the danger she had escaped ; and indeed it is worthy of observation, that so well had the English ambassador kept his counsel, and so true were the conspirators to their secret, that after a concealment of nearly three centuries, these dark intrigues, with all their ramifica tions, have now for the first time been made a portion of our national history.2 Another base transaction stains the history of this year. During Morton's exile in England the Earl of Northumberland had been his kindest friend : Northumberland himself was now a 1 MS. letter, British Museum, Caligula, C. iii. sol. 386, Burghley ta- Leicester, 3d November, 1572. 2 Dr Robertson not having access to the State-paper Office, had not seen the letters of Killigrew and Burghley, which unveil this part of Mary's history. He consequently falls into the error of stating, that Mar, from his honourable feelings, instantly rejected Killigrew's pro posal of bringing Mary to her trial in Scotland, pronouncing her guilty, and executing her. All subsequent historians, amongst the rest the acute and learned Lingard, have been misled by this view of the transaction. Killigrew's and Burghley's letters have at length given us the truth. No trial, it appears to me, was ever contemplated ; although, to use Morton's words, \" a kind of process \" was to le used after a secret manner, (supra, p. 181 ;) and Mar, though at first cold in the matter, at last gave his full consent to Mary '6 being put to death as speedily and secretly as possible."], [195, "REGENCY OF MAR. 1568. 189 captive in Scotland, under the charge of Morton ; but, instead of a return of benefits, this base and avaricious man sold his unhappy prisoner to Elizabeth, who shortly after had him executed at York.1 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Hunsdon to Burghley, 1st May, 1572.

The death of Mar, over which there hung some sus picion of poison, threw Killigrew, the English ambas sador, into much perplexity ; J and Burghley, who had received the news as early as the 3d of November, wrote on that day to Walsingham, the English am bassador at the French court, in much anxiety. \" The 28th of the last,\" said he, \" the good regent of Scot land is dead, as I think by a natural sickness, and yet the certainty is not known.

She wrote to the Countess of Mar, recommending her to watch over the safety of the young prince, her dear relative, in whose welfare she took the deepest interest ; and she sent a flattering letter to the Earl of Morton, in which, with unusual condescension, she addressed him as if already regent, calling him her well-beloved cousin, commending the wisdom with which he had governed himself in times past, in seasons of great difficulty, and expressing her hope that he and the nobility would take measures for the safety of the young king and the repose of the realm. For more particulars she referred him to Kil ligrew, her ambassador ; and alluding to the necessity of appointing a new regent, trusted that the election would not disturb the quiet of the country.1 These were politic steps, as Morton was undoubtedly at this time the most able and powerful of the nobility. Even under Mar he had regulated every public mea sure ; and when it was certain that the regent was on his death-bed, the whole administration of affairs seems naturally to have devolved on him. 2 He was sup ported by the great majority of the nobles, by the influential party of the church, and by the friendship of England. Against such influence the Castilians and their friends could do little ; and after a feeble opposition, he was chosen regent in a parliament held at Edinburgh on the 24th of November, and proclaimed next day with the usual solemnity.3 1 Copy, State-paper Office, Elizabeth to Morton, 4th Nov. 1572. - MS. letter, Caligula, B. viii. sol. 300.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 192 At this parliament Elizabeth's letters to the Scottish nobility were publicly read ; and although these were not so decided in their language as her partisans had desired, there can be little doubt that the knowledge of her favour to Morton produced the greatest influence. On informing his royal mistress, and her minister Burghley, of the late events, Killigrew earnestly ad vised some more effectual assistance to be sent to the new regent. He had in vain endeavoured to induce the two factions to refer their controversies to Eliza beth. The Castilians were still confident in the strength of their fortress, and looked to speedy aid from France ; Morton, on the other hand, although he admitted the desirableness of peace, had invariably asserted, that to storm the castle and utterly subdue the king's enemies would be the only means to estab lish a firm government, and restore security alike to Scotland and England. But it was evident that this could not be done without some effectual assistance. The regent and the nobles were too poor to maintain any sufficient body of troops on their own resources, and the danger seemed to be, that if not supported by Elizabeth, they would look to France. \" This regent,\" said Killigrew, in his letter to Burghley, \" is a shrewd fellow ; and I fear little Dou glas be not come home out of France without some offers to him among others ; howbeit, hitherto, I can perceive nothing at all, for he assureth me still to run the course of England as much as ever regent did. Notwithstanding I see not how he can make war till the parliament be ended, though he had aid of money, and that for two reasons : the one, the parliament is appointed in this town, which cannot well be holden, because of the castle, if it were war, and the parlia ment must of necessity be holden for many weighty"], [199, "1572. REGENCY OF MORTON. 193 reasons ; the other is the regent's indisposition, as he is not like to travel for a month or two, but rather to keep his bed or chamber under the surgeon's care, for a disease that hath much troubled him this five or six years.\" x A few days after the despatch of this letter, Killi grew made a rapid journey to Berwick to hold a con ference with Sir William Drury on Scottish matters, and obtain his advice and assistance. He was recall ed suddenly, however, to Edinburgh, by a report of Morton's extreme danger, but found him much re covered, and soon after had the satisfaction of receiv ing an assurance from England, that the queen had determined to give effective support to the new regent both in money and troops.2 Of the money, part was instantly paid down ; and, by Elizabeth's directions, two skilful engineers, Johnson and Fleming, repaired to Edinburgh and examined the strength of the castle. They reported that, with a proper force and battering trains, it might be taken in twenty days ; and it was resolved, as soon as the season of the year permitted, to begin the siege. It was in the midst of these transactions, and on the very day on which Morton was chosen regent, that the celebrated reformer Knox died, in his house at Edinburgh.3 He was scarcely to be called an aged man, not having completed his sixty-seventh year ; but his life had been an incessant scene of theological and political warfare, and his ardent and restless intellect 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Killigrew to Burghley, Dec. 10, 1572, Edinburgh. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 194 had worn out a frame which at no period had been a strong one. There is perhaps no juster test of a great man than the impression which he has left, or the changes he has wrought upon his age ; and, under this view, none is more entitled to this appellation than Knox, who has been deservedly regarded as the father of the Refor mation in Scotland. The history of his life is indeed little else than the history of this great religious revolution ; and none can deny him the praise of courage, integrity, and indefatigable exertion in pro claiming that system of truth which he believed to be founded upon the Word of God. To this he was faith ful to the last ; 'and although it appears to me, that on many occasions he acted upon the principle, (so manifestly erroneous and anti-Christian,) that the end justified the means, on no one occasion do we find him influenced by selfish or venal motives. In this respect he stands alone, and pre-eminent over all men with whom he laboured. To extirpate a system wThich in its every part he believed to be false and idolatrous, and to replace it by another of which he was as firmly persuaded that it was the work of God, seems to have been the master passion of his mind. In the accom plishment of this, none who has studied the history of the times, or his own writings, will deny that he was often fierce, unrelenting, and unscrupulous ; but he was also disinterested, upright, and sincere. He neither feared nor flattered the great ; the pomp of the mitre, or the revenues of the wealthiest diocese, had no attractions in his eyes ; and there cannot be a doubt of his sincerity, when, in his last message to his old and long-tried friend, Lord Burghley, he assured him, that he counted it higher honour to have been made the instrument that the gospel was simply and truly"], [201, "1572. REGENCY OF MORTON. 195 preached in his native country than to have been the highest prelate in England. During his last illness, his time was wholly occupied in offices of devotion, and in receiving the visits of a few religious friends, who affectionately assisted his family in the attendance which his feeble and helpless condition required. A few days before his death, he sent for Mr David Lindsay, Mr James Lawson, and the elders and deacons of the church,1 and raising himself in his bed, addressed them in these solemn words : \" The time is approaching for which I have long thirsted, wherein I shall be relieved of all cares, and be with my Saviour Christ for ever. And now God is my witness, whom I have served with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that I have taught nothing but the true and solid doctrine of the gospel ; and that the end I proposed in all my preaching, was to instruct the ignorant, to confirm the weak, to comfort the consciences of those who were humbled under the sense of their sins ; and bear down, with the threaten ings of God's judgments, such as were proud and rebellious. I am not ignorant that many have blamed, and yet do blame, my too great rigour and severity ; but God knows, that in my heart I never hated the persons of those against whom I thundered God's judgments. I did only hate their sins, and laboured at all my power to gain them to Christ. That I for bore none of whatsoever condition, I did it out of the fear of my God, who had placed me in the function of the ministry, and I knew would bring me to an account. Now, brethren, for yourselves, I have no more to say, but that you take heed to the flock over whom God hath placed you overseers, and whom he 1 Bannatyne's Memorials, pp. 264, 283."], [202, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1572. 196 hath redeemed by the blood of his only begotten Son. And you, Mr Lawson, [this was his successor,] fight a good fight. Do the work of the Lord with courage and with a willing mind ; and God from above bless you and the church whereof you have the charge: against it, so long as it continueth in the doctrine of truth, the gates of hell shall not prevail.\" 1 During his illness he continued to exhibit all his wonted interest in public affairs, often bewailed the defection of Grange, one of his oldest friends, and sent a message to him which at the time was regarded as almost prophetic. \" Go,\" said he, addressing Lindsay the minister of Leith, \" to yonder man in the castle, whom you know I have loved so dearly, and tell him that I have sent you yet once more to warn him, in the name of God, to leave that evil cause. * * * Neither the craggy rock in which he miserably confides, nor the carnal prudence of that man [meaning the Se cretary Lethington] whom he esteems a demi-god, nor the assistance of strangers, shall preserve him ; but he shall be disgracefully dragged from his nest to punish ment, and hung on a gallows against the face of the sun, unless he speedily amend his life and flee to the mercy of God.\" 2 It appears to me, that in this and other similar predictions, the dying Reformer, who was not only intimately acquainted with, but personally engaged in, the secret correspondence between his party and Eng land, availed himself of this knowledge to fulminate his threats and warnings, which he knew the advance of the English army was so soon likely to fulfil. During this time his weakness rapidly increased, and on Friday the 21st of November, he desired his coffin 1 Spottiswood, pp. 265, 266.

The succeeding Saturday and Sunday were spent by him almost uninterruptedly in medita tion and prayer, in pious ejaculations, and earnest advices addressed to his family and friends. On Monday the 24th these sacred exercises were resumed till he was exhausted and fell into a slumber, from which he awoke to have the evening prayers read to him. \" About eleven o'clock [I use the words of his excellent biographer] he gave a deep sigh, and said, ' Now, it is come;' upon which Richard Bannatyne, his faithful servant and secretary, drew near, and desired him to think of those comfortable promises of our Saviour Christ which he had so often declared to others ; and perceiving that he was speechless, re quested him to give them a sign that he heard them, and died in peace. Upon this he lifted up one of his hands, and sighing twice, expired without a struggle.\" x The Reformer was twice married. By his first wife, Mrs Marjory Bowes, he left two sons, Nathanael and Eleazer, who were educated in England, and both died without issue : it is remarkable that Eleazer entered the English church. By his second marriage, with Marp-aret Stewart the daughter of Lord Ochiltree, he left three daughters, Martha, Margaret, and Elizabeth, all of whom married, but the research of his able bio grapher has not detected any descendants.3 The death of Knox was followed by the complete recovery of Morton and the renewal of the war, after a vain attempt to prolong the truce.3 But although hostilities recommenced, a parliament assembled in the capital, the house where it met being protected from the fire of the castle by a bulwark ; and in this, after 1 M'Crie's Life, by Crichton, p. 309.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 198 the election of the regent had been confirmed by the three estates, all measures adopted since the coronation of the young king were ratified, and every proceeding that had been conducted in the name of the captive queen declared invalid and treasonable. Measures, also, were taken to urge forward a reconciliation be tween the regent and such of the nobility as had not yet acceded to his government. Of these the greatest were the Duke of Chastelherault, the whole of the Hamiltons, Argyle, Huntley, and his gallant brother Sir Adam Gordon, who still maintained his ascendency in the north. With a view to facilitate an accommo dation, it was ' secretly resolved, that for the present no inquiry into the murder of the late king should take place, nor any prosecution be instituted against such persons as were suspected of this crime. The regent was also empowered to pardon all persons ac cessary to the death of the Earl of Lennox.1 The object of all this was quite apparent. Morton himself, Huntley, Argyle, and Sir James Balfour, (who had lately deserted his friends in the castle,) were all of them concerned in the murder of Darnley; whilst the assassination of Lennox, the late regent, was as certainly the work of the Hamiltons. Any resolu tion to prosecute the perpetrators of either crime must have at once put an end to the hopes of a reconciliation, and it was determined for the present to say and do nothing upon either subject.2 During the first sitting of the parliament Killigrew was absent at Berwick, whither he had gone for the purpose of consulting with Sir William Drury and 1 Supra, p. 161. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Jan. 26. 1572-3.

Before his departure, however, he had a meeting with Nicholas Elphinston on the \"great matter,\" or, to speak more plainly, the secret project for having Mary executed, \u2014 a subject which, although interrupted by Mar's decease, appears to have been resumed on the election of Morton. It seemed, how ever, that this dark design of Elizabeth, by which she hoped to rid herself of her enemy without her hand appearing in the transaction, was invariably destined to be thwarted. We have just seen, that, for the security of Huntley, Argyle, and the regent himself, it had been resolved to accuse no person of the murder, and the same prudent considerations made it expedient, at this moment, to say and do nothing against the queen. In a letter addressed at this time by Elphin ston to Killigrew, this is clearly explained. \" The other matter,\" said he, \" I doubt not, you know per fectly well, cannot nor may not at this time be touched, because presently the murder may not be spoken of, seeing some suspected thereof to be in terms of ap pointment, as I shall at meeting cause you more clearly to understand ; but of this matter I trust here after shortly to see a good beginning.\" 1 In this parliament a conference took place between the Kirk and certain commissioners appointed by the three estates, in which an important ecclesiastical measure was carried. This was the confirmation of that order for the election of bishops, which had been drawn up in the Book of Discipline, devised at Leith many years before. The change amounted to nothing less than the establishment of Episcopacy in the Scot tish church. It was decided, that the title and office 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, N. Elphinston to Killigrew, Janu ary 17, 1572-3."], [206, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1572-3. 200 of archbishop and bishop should be continued as in the time which preceded the Reformation, and that a spiritual jurisdiction should be exercised by the bishops in their respective dioceses. It was determined that all abbots, priors, and other inferior prelates who were presented to benefices, should be tried by the bishop, or superintendent of the diocese, concerning their fitness to represent the church in parliament, and that to such bishopricks as were presently void, or which should become vacant, the king and regent should take care to recommend qualified persons, whose election should be made by the chapters of their cathedral churches. It was also ordered, that all benefices with cure under prelacies should be dis posed of to ministers, who should receive ordination from the bishop of the diocese, upon their taking an oath to recognise the authority of the king, and to pay canonical obedience to their ordinary.1 In the midst of these proceedings Killigrew returned to Edinburgh, and on the succeeding day was admitted to an audience of the parliament. The message which he delivered, and the assurances he conveyed of the determination of his royal mistress to protect the young king and support the government of the regent, 1 Spottiswood, p. 260. \u2014 Mr David Lindsay, a minister and com missioner, communicated these important measures to Killigrew in a letter written during the sitting of the conference, and when the guns of the castle were thundering in their ears. Its concluding sentence is worthy of notice, as it seems to show that Killigrew had still in view such measures as he judged necessary for the prosecution of the \"great matter\" confided to him. \" The article which your lordship desired me to remember, touching the murder, is not like to pass, lest it should hold back some that are willing to come to composition I cannot tell how long the parliament shall last, but I suppose all will be ended this next Wednesday at the farthest.

It was attended by the English ambassa dor, in whose lodging the conferences took place, and who exerted himself so successfully to compose all subjects of difference, that at last a complete recon ciliation was effected. \" And now,\" said the success ful diplomatist to Lord Burghley, \" there remaineth but the castle to make the king universally obeyed, and this realm united, which, peradventure, may be done without force after the accord; notwithstanding, in my simple opinion, which I submit unto your honour's wisdom, it standeth with more reason and policy for her majesty to hasten the aid rather now than before this conference.

Ve rac, who had been commissioned to bring them relief from the French king, was driven by a tempest into Scarborough, and detained in England.

With this view the indefatigable Killigrew had hurried from Perth to the capital, where he obtained the regent's signature to the articles of pacification.1 Even under all these gloomy appearances, the spirit of Grange was unbroken, and the resources of Lethington undiminished. A long experience of the parsimony of Elizabeth had persuaded them that she would never submit to the expense of sending an army and a battering train into Scotland. They looked with confidence to the arrival of assistance from France, and trusted that, even if long delayed, the Strength of their walls would still bid defiance to the enemy.2 For a brief season these sanguine anticipations seemed to be realized ; and the Queen of England, at the moment when Burghley imagined he had con vinced her of the necessity of sending her forces into Scotland, began to waver. She dreaded bringing on a war with France ; represented to her council the great expense and hazard of the siege ; and asserted that Morton ought to be able to reduce it without her assistance. Killigrew was in despair. He wrote instantly, that if the expedition were abandoned, Scotland would be lost to> them, and as surely united 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Killigrew to Burghley, February 23, 1572-3. \" God so blessed this treaty, as this day, being the 23d aforenoon, the Articles of Accord and Pacification were signed.\" 2 Copy of the time, State-paper Office, 23d February, 1572-3.

Lord Seton had been already negotiat ing with the regent to win him to France. What had been Verac's late commission ? To corrupt the garrison of Dunbarton, to bribe the governors of the young king, and to convey him out of Scotland. What was Stephen Wilson's message out of France, when he was lately seized, and his letters to the cap tain of the castle of Edinburgh intercepted ? Did he not bring assurances from the French king and the Bishop of Glasgow, Mary's ambassador in Paris ; and had he not confessed the pope's designs, and that of the rest of the Romish league, to be mainly directed against England and Scotland ? Nay, were not the papal coffers already unlocked, and the man's name known who was shortly to bring the money, and begin the attack ? And would her majesty shut her eyes to all this, and this too at the very crisis when a decided effort, and no very great sum, might enable her to confound these plans and secure her ground in Scot land ? Would she countermand her army, and abandon the advantages which were within her reach, or rather which she had already secured ? \" If so,\" said the ambassador, in the end of an eloquent letter to Burghley, \" God's will be done. For mine own part, if this castle be not recovered, and that with expedition, I see, methinks, the beginning of sorrows, and her majesty's peaceable reign hitherto, decaying as it were in post, which God of his mercy defend.

A last attempt to bring the Castilians to terms was now made by the Earl of Rothes; but it led to no result. Kirkaldy and Lethington declared that, though de serted by all their friends, they would keep the castle to the last ; and on the 25th of April, the English army, consisting of five hundred hagbutters, and a hundred and forty pikemen, entered the capital. They were joined by seven hundred soldiers of the regent ; and the battering train having at the same time arrived by sea, the operations of the siege com menced. In the midst of these martial transactions, the regent assembled a parliament, which confirmed the league with England, ratified the late pacification, restored Huntley and Sir James Balfour to their estates and honours, and pronounced a sentence of treason and forfeiture against the Castilians. A summons of sur render was then sent to Grange in the name of Morton and of the English general,1 and operations for the undermining the \" Spur,\" or blockhouse, and erecting the batteries on the principal spots which commanded the walls, proceeded with little interruption from the besieged. Their obstinacy, indeed, was surprising, and can only be accounted for by the extraordinary 1 Copy, State-paper Office, April 25, 1573, Sir W. Drury's Sum mons.

REGENCY OF MORTON. 205 influence which Lethington possessed, and his fatal conviction that succours would yet arrive from France. His power over Kirkaldy was described by Killigrew as something like enchantment ; and although Robert Melvil, Pitarrow, and other leading men, would fain have come to terms ; though they argued that their powder and ammunition were exhausted, their victuals and supply of water on the point of failing, and their distress increasing every moment ; still the governor declared he would hold the castle till he was buried in its ruins. On the 2d of May, Killigrew, who himself assisted in the trenches, wrote thus to Burghley. \" Yesterday I did advertise your honour of the end of the parlia ment. This day, Sir Henry Ley, with his company, dined with the regent ; and upon Monday, the 4th of this month, the general doth intend to begin to plant his batteries. They within make good show, and fortify continually to frustrate the first battery, al though the regent and others here be of opinion, that they will never abide the extremity. Their water will soon be taken from them when the ordnance shall be laid both within and without. Hope of succour there is none, and therefore their obstinacy must needs be vain. I send your lordship the roll of their names within, both tag and rag; and, as I am informed, eighteen of the best of them would fain be out.\"1 All such hopes of escape, however, were now utterly vain, for Drury perceived his advantage, and Morton had determined to receive nothing but an unconditional surrender. In England, the result of the siege was regarded with deep interest, and many young cavaliers, amongst whom was Thomas Cecil, Burghley's eldest 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, 2d May, 1573, Killigrew to Burghley."], [212, "1573.

On the 17th of May the batteries were completed, and, beginning to play upon the principal bastion, named David's Tower, were answered by a long and loud shriek from the women in the castle, which was distinctly heard in. the English camp. \" This day,\" (17th May), said Killigrew in one of his journal letters to Burghley, \"at one of the clock in the afternoon, some of our pieces began to speak such language as it made both them in the castle, I am sure, think more of God than they did before ; and all our men, and a great many others, think the enterprise not so hard as before they took it to be. * * I trust, to be short, that after the battery shall be outlaid, which, as they say, will be ready by the twenty-first of this month, the matter will be at a point before the end of the same. * * Thanks be to God, although it be longsome, it hath hitherto been with the least blood that ever was heard in such a case ; and this conjecture we have to lead us, that they want store of powder within, for they have suffered us to plant all the ord nance, and to shoot yesterday, all the afternoon, without any harm from them.\" 1 * * From this time till the 23d, the cannon played incessantly upon the castle, the guns of the garrison were silenced, and in the afternoon of that day the southern wall of David's Tower fell with a great crash ; next day its east quarter, the portcullis and an outer bastion named Wallace Tower, were beaten down ; and on the 26th, the English, with little resis- 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Edinburgh, Killigrew to Burghley, 17th May, 1573.

This was in the evening, and a meeting immediately took place between Grange and Robert Melvil, on the part of the Castilians, Killigrew and Drury for the Queen of England, and Lord Boyd for the regent. Kirkaldy's requests were, to have surety for their lives and livings, not be spoiled of their goods within the castle, to have license for Lord Hume and Lethington to retire into England, and himself to be allowed to remain unmolested in his own country.2 To these conditions Drury would probably have agreed, but they were scornfully rejected by Morton. As to the great body of the garrison, he said, he was ready, if they came out singly without arms, and sub mitted to his mercy, to grant them their lives, and permit them to go where they pleased ; but there Avere nine persons who must be excepted from these conditions : Grange himself, William Maitland of Lethington the secretary, Alexander Lord Hume, Robert Melvil of Murdocairny, the Bishop of Dunkeld, and the Lairds of Restalrig, Drylaw, and Pitarrow. These must submit themselves unconditionally, and their fate be determined by the Queen of England, 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Drury to Burghley, May 28, 1573. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Killigrew to Burghley, 27th May, 1573.

But this was no longer in their power, for the soldiers began to mutiny, threatened to hang the secretary over the walls within six hours if he did not advise a surrender, and were ready to deliver the captain and his companions to the enemy.2 In this dread dilemma an expedient was adopted, suggested probably by the fertile brain of Lethington. Grange, after refusing the terms in open conference, sent a secret message to Drury, in consequence of which two com panies of the besieging force were admitted within the walls on the night of the 29th, and to them in the morning he and his companions surrendered; expressly stating, that they submitted, not to the Regent of Scotland, but to the Queen of England, and her general, Sir William Drury. They were accordingly carried to his quarters ; and, notwithstanding some remon strances upon the part of the regent, received with courtesy.3 Morton, however, was not thus to be baulked of his prey. He instantly wrote to Burghley, 1 Copy of the time, State-paper Office, \" The regent's answer to the Castilians,\" May 28, 1573.

He sajs, \" By computation there hath been near 3000 great shot bestowed against the castle in this service, and the bullets of all or the most part recovered, and brought again, part by our own labours, and part by the Scots, paying to the Scottish people a piece of their coin called a bawbee for every bullet, which is in value English, one penny and a quarter.\""], [215, "1573.

At this trying moment, Grange and Lethington addressed the following letter to one who had once been knit to them in ties of the strictest friendship, the Lord Treasurer Burghley. \" My Lord \u2014 The malice of our enemies is the more increased against us, that they have seen us rendered in the queen's majesty's will, and now to seek refuge at her highness's hands. And, therefore, we doubt not, but they will go about by all means possible to procure our mischief; yea, that their cruel minds shall lead them to that impudency to crave our bloods at her majesty's hands. But whatsoever their malice be, we cannot fear that it shall take success; knowing with how gracious a princess we have to do, which hath given so many good proofs to the world of her clemency and mild nature, that we cannot mistrust that the first example of the contrary shall be shown upon us.

Elizabeth, indeed, did not instantly decide, and requested particular in formation to be sent her of the \" quality and quantity of the prisoners' offences ;\" but Killigrew and Morton so strongly advised their execution, that the queen com manded them to be delivered up to the regent, to be dealt with as he pleased. This, as she must have known, was equivalent to signing their death-warrant. Before, however, the final order arrived, Lethington died in prison. It was reported that he had swallowed poison ; 1 MS. letter, British Museum, Caligula, C. iv. sol. 86, Lethington and Grange to Lord Burghley, 1st June, 1573."], [217, "1573. REGENCY OF MORTON. 211 but the rumour was uncertain, and was treated by many as an invention of his enemies.1 Ten days after this, Drury reluctantly complied with the orders of Elizabeth, and delivered Grange, Hume, John Mait land, (Lethington's younger brother,) aud Robert Melvil, to the regent;2 Grange's brother (Sir James Kirkaldy) being already in Morton's hands. Much interest was now exerted to save the life of Grange, but without success : he had made himself too conspicuous, and his talents for war were much dreaded by his adversaries. A hundred gentlemen, his friends and kinsmen, offered for his pardon to become perpetual servants to the house of Angus and Morton in \" bond of manrent,\" a species of obligation well known in those times, and to pay two thousand pounds to the regent, besides an annuity of three thousand merks ; but although Morton's prevailing vice was avarice, he was compelled to resist the temptation, influenced, as he stated in a letter to Killigrew, by the \" denunciations of the preachers,\" 3 who cried out that God's plague would not cease till the land were purged with blood. They were aware of the prediction of Knox, so recently uttered upon his death-bed, that Grange should be shamefully dra<nred from the rock wherein he trusted, and hanged in the face of the sun. The success of Drury had fulfilled the first part, and the violence with which the ministers opposed every intercession for mercy, affords a melancholy proof of their determination that 1 British Museum, Caligula, C. iv. sol. 97, copy, Elizabeth to Morton, June 9,1573.

Nor were they disappointed. On the 3d of August, Sir William Kirkaldy and his brother were brought from Holyrood to the cross of Edinburgh, and executed in the presence of an immense concourse of spectators. They were attended on the scaffold by Mr David Lindsay, a martial clergyman of those times, to whose hands, if we may believe Melvil, it was difficult to say whether the Bible or the hagbut were most con genial instruments. Grange received his ministrations with gratitude, and expressed on the scaffold deep penitence for his sins and unshaken attachment to his captive sovereign.1 Thus died the famous Laird of Grange, a gentleman who, although his character will not bear examination, if we look to consistency and public principle, was justly reputed one of the best soldiers and most accomplished cavaliers of his time.2 The year 1573 was thus fatal to the cause of Mary, whose last hope expired with the execution of this brave man, and the surrender of the castle of Edin burgh. In England she had seen all her plans blasted by the death of Norfolk and the imprisonment of the Bishop of Ross : to France she could no longer look for active interference in her behalf, for Elizabeth had recently entered into the defensive treaty of Blois, with that kingdom; and Catherine of Medicis was negotiating a marriage between the English queen 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Killigrew to Burghley, August 3 1573.

Even Spain she could no longer regard with any confidence. The Duke of Alva was the friend and secret correspondent of Burghley and Elizabeth ; and although the Roman Catholic refugees in Flanders were incessant in their kitriguesT and Philip himself seemed disposed to annoy her on the side of Ireland and Scotland, the influence of this minister effectually counteracted any decided enter prise.1 With the death of Kirkaldy, therefore, the reign of Mary properly terminates ; for immediately after that event, her last intrepid supporter, Sir Adam Gordon of Auchendown, retired to France ; and from that period till her death, no subject dared to acknow ledge her as his sovereign. 1 Gonzalez, pp. 370, 371."], [220, "1573.

Scotland was now at peace ; and the regent, having nothing to fear from domestic enemies or foreign in trigue, addressed himself with great energy and success to reduce the country to order. The border districts, at all times impatient under the restraints of a firm government, had, during the late civil commotions, become the scene of the utmost violence and confusion; but Morton, advancing from Peebles to Jedburgh with a force of four thousand men, soon compelled the prin cipal chiefs to respect the law and give pledges for their obedience.1 Sir James Hume of Coldingknowes was then appointed warden of the east, Lord Maxwell of the west, and Sir John Carmichael of the middle marches ; 2 and the regent had leisure to renew his correspondence and confirm his ties with England. Some time before this, when Killigrew, after his successful embassy, returned to the English court,3 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, the Regent to Lord Burghley, Kelso, August 30, 1573. 2 Diurnal of Occurrents in Scotland, p. 337. Spottiswood, p. 272. 3 June 29."], [221, "1573. REGENCY OF MORTON. 215 Morton had sent a memorial to Elizabeth,1 in which he pointed out the principles upon which he proposed to regulate his future government. He declared the grateful feelings entertained bv himself and the people, for her late assistance in quieting their troubled conn try, and reducing it under the king's obedience.2 He urged the necessity of entering into a mutual league for the maintenance of the Protestant religion, and its professors, against the Council of Trent ; and suggested the expediency of a contract or band for mutual defence from foreign invasion.3 In a letter written at the same time to Burghley, he pointed out the heavy charges which he had incurred, and requested pecuni ary assistance, as it would still be necessary for him to provide against any renewed rebellion by keeping up a body of troops ; and he, lastly, reminded Elizabeth that Mary, the root of all the evil, was still in her power, and at her disposal. \" The ground of the trouble,\" said he, \" remains in her majesty's hands and power ; whereunto I doubt not her highness will put order when she thinks time, so as presently I will not be further curious thereanent, abiding the knowledge of her majesty's mind, how she shall think convenient to proceed in that behalf.\" 4 It appears from this sentence, that the regent invited the English queen to renew the negotiations for putting Mary to death in Scotland, which were so suddenly broken off by the decease of Mar ; and indeed, some time before the surrender of the castle of Edinburgh, Killigrew the ambassador wrote to Burghley, that he had given Morton a strong hint upon the subject. He stated, 1 Copy, State-paper Office, Memoirs of me, the Lord Regent of Scotland, to the Queen's Majesty of England's Ambassador, &c. 26th June, 1573. 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid. 4 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Morton to Burghley, June 25, 1573."], [222, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1573. 216 that in a conversation which took place in the palace, the regent had declared, that as long as the Scottish queen lived, there would be treason, troubles, and mis chief: \"to which,\" said Killigrew, \"I answered he might help that ; and he said, when all was done, he thought at the next parliament * * to prove the noblemen after this concord, to see what might be done.\" 1 We do not find, however, that Elizabeth at this moment gave any encouragement to the renewal of this nefari ous negotiation. All was now quiet in Scotland ; and it is remarkable that, notwithstanding the miseries of the civil war, the general prosperity of the country had been progressive. Commerce and trade had increased ; and whilst the power of the high feudal lords was visibly on the de cay, the middle classes had risen in importance ; and the great body of the people, instructed in their poli tical duties by the sermons of the clergy, and acquiring from the institution of parish schools a larger share of education and intelligence, began to appreciate their rights, and to feel their own strength. There is a passage in a letter of Killigrew, which is worthy of notice upon this subject. \" Methinks,\" said this acute observer, \" I see the noblemen's great credit decay in this country, and the barons, burrows, and such like, take more upon them ; the ministers and religion increase, and the desire in them to prevent the practices of the papists; the number of able men for service very great, and well furnished both on horse and foot ; their navy so augmented, as it is a thing almost in credible.\"2 It is to be recollected, that Killigrew's last 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, the Regent to Lord Burghley, Holyrood, 26th June, 1573.

REGENCY OF MORTON. 217 visit to Scotland had been in 1567, immediately after the murder of the king ; and that the remarkable change which he now noticed, had taken place in the brief period of five years. This flourishing state of things, however, did not long continue ; for although the regent was justly entitled to the praise of restoring security and order, and his vigour in the punishment of crime, and the maintenance of the authority of the laws, was superior to that of any former governor, there was one vice which stained his character, and led to measures of an unpopular and oppressive kind. This was avarice : and he found the first field for its exercise in an attack upon the patrimony of the Kirk. He had the address to persuade the Presbyterian clergy, that it would be the best thing for their interests to resign at once into his hands the thirds of the benefices, which had been granted for their support by a former parliament. Their collectors, he said, were often in arrear ; but his object would be to make the stipend local, and payable in each parish where they served. This would be a better system ; and if it failed, they should, upon application, be immediately reinstated in their right and possession. 1 The plan was agreed to, but was followed by immediate repentance on the part of the clergy ; as the moment Morton became possessed of the thirds, his scheme of spoliation was unmasked. The course he followed was, to appoint two, three, or even four churches to one minister, who was bound to preach in them by turns ; and at the same time he placed in every parish a reader, whose duty was to officiate in the minister's absence, and to whom a miserable pittance of twenty or forty pounds Scots 1 Spottiswood, p. 273,"], [224, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1573. 218 was assigned. Having thus allotted to the church the smallest possible sum, he seized the overplus for himself; and when the clergy, sensible of their error, petitioned to be reinstated in their property, as had been promised, they were at first met with delays, and at last peremptorily told, that the appointment of the stipends ought properly to belong to the regent and council. Nothing could be more distressing and degrading to this independent body of men than such a state of things. Before this, when their stipend was defective, they had an appeal to the superintendents, who, if not always able, were at least solicitous to relieve them. Now, they were compelled to become suitors at court, where their importunate complaints met only with ridicule and neglect. All this misery was justly laid to the regent's account ; and although once their favour ite, as a steady friend to the Reformation, he became highly unpopular with the clergy. But if the grasping avarice of Morton fell heavy on the ministers of the Kirk, their woes were little to the miseries of the lower classes, more especially the arti sans, merchants, and burgesses of the capital. Many of these had remained in the city during the time of the late troubles. These were now treated as rebels, who had resisted the king's authority; and they found that they must either submit to a public trial, or purchase security by payment of a heavy fine. The sum thus collected was intended at first to be divided between the state and the citizens whose houses and property had been destroyed ; but it followed the fate of all moneys paid into the coffers of this rapacious governor. Another source of complaint arose out of those itinerant courts, denominated Justice Ayres, and held"], [225, "1573. REGENCY OF MORTON. 219 in different parts of the kingdom ; which, under his administration, became little else than parts of a system of legal machinery, invented to overawe and plunder all classes in the country. To supply them with vic tims, he kept in pay a numerous body of informers, whose business it was to discover offences. Nor was it difficult to bring forward accusations of almost every possible nature, after so many years of a divided go vernment, in which men, at one time or another, had been compelled to acknowledge very opposite authori ties ; now that of the king and his regent, now of the queen or her partisans. Ample ground was thus found for every species of prosecution : against merchants for transporting coin out of the realm, against Pro testants for transgressing the statute by eating flesh in Lent, against the poorer artisans or labourers for the mere remaining in a town or city which was occu pied by the queen's forces. As to those whose only offence was to be rich, their case was the worst of all ; for to have a full purse, and \" thole \" J a heavy fine to the regent, were become synonymous terms. These were not Morton's only resources. His peti tions to Elizabeth for support were importunate and incessant ; nor did he fail to remind her, that as it was by her allowance and advice that he had entered upon the regency, so he confidently expected her aid, especially in money, and pensions bestowed upon his friends. Although universally reputed rich, he dwelt pathetically on his limited revenue compared with his vast outlay ; and in the letter to Burghley, which pre ferred these requests, he at the same time earnestly recommended Elizabeth to keep a watchful eye upon France, as the noted Adam Gordon, who had already 1 \"Thole,\" undergo."], [226, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1573. 220 done so much mischief in the north, was now received at the French court, and had offered, if properly sup- ported, to overthrow the king's government in Scot- land.1 This news seems to have alarmed the English queen ; for, not long after, she again despatched Killi- grew into that country. Her avowed object was to learn the state of public feeling, and the disposition of the regent ; \" whether he was constant in his affection towards England ; how his government was liked by the people ; whether the Scottish queen had yet any party there ; and, above all, to discover whether France was intriguing, as had been reported, to get possession of the young king.\" To the regent's proposal for a defensive and religious league, he was instructed to reply, that she deemed such a measure at present unnecessary ; although, in any emergency, he might look confidently to her support. As to his request for money, Killigrew was, as delicately as he could, to \" waive \" all discussion upon the subject. Here, however, as in the former embassy, there was a mission within a mission ; and the envoy's open in structions embraced not the whole, nor even the most material part of the object for which he was sent. He was enjoined by Burghley and Leicester (doubtless, as before, with Elizabeth's knowledge and advice) to renew the negotiation for the \" great matter, \" the project for having Mary put to death in her own country, and by her own subjects. Unfortunately the written orders upon this point are now lost ; but im mediately upon his arrival in Edinburgh, the ambas sador communicated to Walsingham his fears that 1 MS. letter, State- paper Office, the Regent Morton to Burghley, Jan. 21, 1573-4, Haddington."], [227, "1574. REGENCY OF MORTON. 221 they had suffered the time for the accomplishment of so desirable a result to go by.1 On examining the state of the country, Killigrew became convinced that his sovereign and the English had lost popularity since his late residence in Scotland. The regent, although professing his usual devotion, appeared more distant and reserved. The queen's coldness on the subject of the proposed league, and her evasion of his requests for pensions, had produced no good effect ; and some piracies committed by English subjects upon Scottish merchantmen, had occasioned great popular discontent. Not long after the ambassador's arrival, he repaired to Stirling, where he was introduced to the young king, who had very recently completed his eighth year ; and, after the interview, he sent this interesting portrait of him to Walsingham : \u2014 \"Since my last unto you,\" said he, \" I have been at Stirling to visit the king in her majesty's name, and met by the way the Countess of Mar coming to Edinburgh, to whom I did her majesty's commendations. \" The king seemed to be very glad to hear from her majesty, and could use pretty speeches : as, how much he was bound unto her majesty, yea, more than to his own mother? And at my departure, he prayed me to thank her majesty for the good remembrance she had of him ; and further desired me to make his hearty commendations unto her majesty. His grace is well grown, both in body and spirit, since I was last here. He speaketh the French tongue marvellous well ; and that which seems strange to me, he was able, extempore, (which he did before me,) to read a chapter of the Bible 1 MS.

He found the regent firm in his government, universally obeyed, somewhat more feared than loved ; but bold, decisive, and clear-headed in the adoption and execution of such measures as he deemed necessary to establish quiet and good order in the realm. The general prosperity of all classes of the people surprised him. He had, to use his own expression, left the country \" in a consumption,\" distracted and impoverished by a long continuance of civil war.2 He had expected, on his return, to meet with the same melancholy state of things ; but to his astonishment, the nation, as he described it to Burghley and Wal singham, had recovered itself with a rapidity of which he found it difficult to assign the cause. Its commerce and manufactures were in a flourishing condition, the people seemed to have forgotten their miseries, the nobles were reconciled to each other, and universally acknowledged the king's authority.

Formerly, the people, broken, bankrupt, and dispirited, were glad to sue for the protection of England, and the nobles were eager in their offers to Elizabeth. Now, to use Killigrew's phrase, they were \"lusty and indepen dent ; \" they talked as those who would be sued to ; their alliance, they said, had been courted by \" great monarchies ;\" and they complained loudly of the attack and plunder of their merchantmen by the English pirates. On this subject the regent expressed himself keenly, and was greatly moved. He dwelt, too, on other causes of dissatisfaction. The rejection of the proposed league by Elizabeth ; her silence as to sending him any aid, or granting any pensions ; the delay in giving back the ordnance which had been taken by the English, and other lighter subjects of complaint, were all recapitulated ; and it was evident to Killigrew that there was an alteration in the relative position of the two countries, which he assured Walsingham would not be removed by mere words of compliment.1 The ambassador anxiously impressed upon Elizabeth and her ministers, that the Scots were no longer de pendent upon England ; and as to attempting to make any impression upon the regent in \" the great matter,\"2 which Leicester and Burghley were solicitous should be again secretly discussed, it seemed to him a vain idea at present. If Morton were to consent to put Mary to death on her delivery into his hands, it would only be, as he soon perceived, by the offer of a far higher bribe than Elizabeth was disposed to give ; and 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Killigrew to Walsingham, June 23, 1574.

Killi grew was so assured of the backwardness of his royal mistress upou this point, and the determination of the regent not to move without such inducement, that he bested to be allowed to return. \" I see no cause,\" said he to Walsingham, \" why I should remain here any longer ; * * * especially if you resolve not upon the league, nor upon pensions, which is the surest ground I do see to build 'the great matter' upon, without which small assurance can be made.

It is unfortunately involved in much obscurity, owing to the letter in which it is alluded to being written partly in cipher ; but it was disapproved of by Walsingham, apparently on the ground that it would be dangerous to send the Scottish queen into Scotland without an absolute certainty that she should be put to death.1 The English queen was evidently distracted be tween the fear of two dangers, \u2014 one, the retaining Mary within her dominions, which experience had taught her was the cause of constant plots and practices ; the other, the delivering her to the Scots, an expedient which, unless it were carried through in the way pro posed by Burghley and Leicester in 15722 \u2014 that is, under a positive agreement that she should be put to death, was, as they justly thought, full of peril. Mor ton, however, although he had shown himself perfectly willing to receive Mary under this atrocious condition, continued firm in his resolution not to sell his services for mere words. He, too, insisted on certain terms ; especially an advance in money, and pensions to his friends. But the queen deemed his demands exorbi tant ; and, as was not unfrequent with her when pressed by a difficulty from which she saw no imme diate escape, she dismissed the subject from her mind, 1 MS. letter, State paper Office, Walsingham to Killigrew, Wood stock, July 30, 1574. Killigrew accordingly accompanied the regent in his northern progress, and, on their arrival at Aberdeen, held a secret consultation on the great matter ; but, unfortunately, the letters in which we might have looked for a particular account of what took place have disappeared. All that we know with certainty is, that the ambassador returned soon after to the English court, (Aug. 16 ;) and that in a brief memorandum of such things as the regent desired him to remember in his conferences with the Queen of England, is this slight note ; \u2014 \" What further is to be looked for in that which passed betwixt us at Aberdeen, touching the matter of greatest moment.\" \u2014 MS.

In this manner \"the great matter\" for the present was allowed to sleep ; and Mary owed her life to the parsimony of Elizabeth, and the avarice of the Scottish regent.1 Killigrew not long after left Scotland, and on part ing with him, Morton assured Leicester, in a letter which this ambassador carried with him, \" that no stranger had ever departed from that country with greater liking and contentment of the people.\" 2 He requested him at the same time, on his return to the English court, to communicate with the queen and council upon some subjects of import which required a speedy answer. These embraced the dangers to which the Protestant interest in Scotland was exposed from continental intrigue ; but, to the regent's morti fication, many months elapsed before any answer was received. At last, Walsingham, alarmed by the apathy of Elizabeth, and the continued practices of her enemies, endeavoured, in a letter of free remon strance, to rouse his mistress to a sense of her peril. He told her, that he had recently received a despatch from the Scottish regent, and with it some intercepted papers of the Bishop of Ross, which required instant consideration. They would convince her, he trusted, how utterly hollow were the promises of France and Spain, and to what imminent danger she was exposed from \" unsound subjects at home.\" He besought her deeply to weigh the matter, and \" set to\" her hand for the protection of her realm; observed that, though the Cardinal of Lorraine were dead, he had left successors enough to execute his plots ; and con- 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, the Regent to Leicester, August 16, 1574, Aberdeen. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Morton to Leicester, 16th August, 1574."], [233, "1574.

Diseased estates are no more cured by consultation without execution, than unsound bodies by mere conference with the physician ; and you will perceive by his letters how much the regent is aggrieved.\"1 For a moment these strong representations alarmed Elizabeth, and she talked of sending Killigrew or Randolph immediately into Scotland ;2 but her rela tions with France occasioned new delays. She had entered into an amicable correspondence with Cathe rine de Medicis ; the Duke D'Alencon still warmly prosecuted his marriage suit ; and although the Eng lish queen had not the slightest intentions of granting it, she, as usual, dallied and coquetted with the pro posal. In the midst of all, Charles the Ninth died ; the queen became engrossed with the speculations and uncertainties which follow a new succession ; and Morton, irritated by neglect, was driven by resent ment and necessity to cultivate the friendship of that party in Scotland which was devoted to France. This alienation was soon detected by Walsingham, who wrote in alarm to Burghley, and on the succeed ing day to Elizabeth, adjuring her, for the love of God, to arrest the impending mischief, and secure the Scottish amitv, which of all others stood them at that 1 MS. letter, draft, State-paper Office, Walsingham to Elizabeth, January 15, 1574-5. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Edward Cary to Walsingham, 17th January, 1574-5.

Already, he said, the regent was conferring favours on the Hamiltons, who were entirely French ; already he was plotting to get the young King of Scots out of the hands of his governor, Alexander Erskine ; Henry the Third, the new King of France, was well known to be devoted to the house of Guise ; and with such feelings, what was to be expected, but that the moment he had quieted the disturbances in his own realm, he would keenly embrace the cause of the Scottish queen?1 Elizabeth was at last roused, and gave orders for the despatch of Henry Killigrew into Scotland, ac companied by Mr Davison, afterwards the celebrated secretary, whom he was directed to leave as English resident at the Scottish court.2 But before the am bassador crossed the border, an affray broke out, which threatened the most serious consequences, and arrested him at Berwick. At a warden court, held by Sir John Forster, warden of the middle marches, and Sir John Carmichael, keeper of Liddesdale, a dispute arose which led to high words between these two leaders ; and their followers, taking fire, assaulted each other. The Scots at first were repulsed, but being joined by a body of their countrymen from Jed burgh, rallied, and attacked, and totally routed the English. Sir John Heron, keeper of Tynedale, was slain ; whilst Sir John Forster, Sir Francis Russell, Sir Cuthbert CollingAvood, Mr Ogle, Mr Fenwick, and about three -hundred men, were made prisoners, and carried by the Earl of Angus to the regent at Dalkeith.

Such a proceed ing, he said, was beneath the dignity of the office he held ; but he offered to send the justice-clerk to arrange a meeting in Scotland.1 On being informed of this, Elizabeth, already chafed by the detention of her warden, broke into one of those furious fits of passion which sometimes caused her highest councillors to tremble for their heads, and disagreeably reminded them of her father. In this frame she dictated a violent message to the Scottish regent, which she commanded Killigrew to deliver without reserve or delay. She had seen, she said, certain demands made, on his part, by the justice clerk, and did not a little wonder at so strange and insolent a manner of dealing. He had already been guilty of a foul fact in detaining her warden, the go vernor of one of the principal forts in her realm : he had committed a flagrant breach of treaty ; and had she been inclined to prosecute her just revenge, he should soon have learnt what it was for one of his base calling to offend one of her quality. And whereas, continued she, he goeth about to excuse the detaining of our warden, alleging that he feared he might revenge himself when his blood was roused for his kinsman's death, \u2014 such an excuse seemed to her, she must tell him, a scornful aggravation of his fault ; for she would have him to know, that neither Forster nor any other public officer or private subject of hers dared to offer 1 MS.

As to the conference with Huntingdon, instead of receiving her offer with gratitude, he had treated it with contempt. He had taken upon him to propose a place of meeting, four miles within Scotland ; an ambitious part in him, and savouring so much of an insolent desire of sovereignty, that she would have scorned such a request had it come from the king his master, or the greatest prince in Europe. To conclude, she informed him that, if he chose to confer with the Earl of Huntingdon at the Bond Rode,1 she wras content ; and he would do well to remember that his predecessor, the Regent Moray, had not scrupled to come to York, and afterwards to London, to hold a consultation with her commis sioners.2 This passionate invective I have given, as it is highly characteristic of the queen ; but Huntingdon and Killigrew deemed it proper to soften its expres sions, in conveying the substance of it to the regent, whom they had no mind unnecessarily to irritate.3 Even in its diluted state, however, it awed him into submission. He met the English president on the 16th of August at the appointed place, arranged all differences, and not only dismissed his prisoners, but loaded them with presents, and sent Carmichael up to England to ask pardon of Elizabeth. Amongst his gifts were some choice falcons ; upon which a saying rose amongst the borderers, alluding to the death of Sir John Heron, that for this once the regent had lost 1 The Bond Rode, or boundary road, a place or road on the marches near Berwick, common to both kingdoms. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, to Killigrew in Scotland.

On his arrival there, he perceived every where indications of the same flourishing condi tion in which he had lately left the country. Whilst the people seemed earnestly disposed to preserve the amity with England, all lamented the late accident on the borders ; and the ministers in their sermons prayed fervently for the continuance of the peace. As to the regent himself, the ambassador found him still firm in his affection to England, and in resisting the advances of France. Although not popular, generally, the vigour and success of his government were admitted even by his enemies : property and person were secure, except from the rapacity of the regent himself, and he gave an example of confidence in his own conduct ; for he never used a guard, and would pursue his diversions, walking abroad with his fishing-rod over his shoulder, or his hawk on his wrist,2 almost alone, to the wonder of many. The borders, since the late disturbance, had been quiet ; and so rapidly had the foreign commerce of the country increased, that Killi grew reckoned it able to raise twenty thousand mariners.3 Such was the favourable side of the picture ; but there were some drawbacks to this prosperity, arising chiefly out of the feuds amongst the nobility, and the discontent of the clergy.

Arbroath was second son of the late Duke of Chastel herault, and, owing to the insanity of Arran his elder brother, had become the chief leader of the Hamiltons. The idea of the return of the late regent's murderer, roused his friends to the highest pitch of resentment ; and Douglas of Lochleven, Moray's near kinsman, assembling a force of twelve hundred men, vowed deadly vengeance against both the assassin and Ar broath his chief. The Earls of Argyle, Athole, Buchan, and Mar, with Lords Lindsay and Ruthven, espoused the quarrel of Lochleven : Arbroath, on the other hand, would be supported, it was said, by all the friends of France and the queen; whilst Morton in vain endeavoured to bring both parties to respect the laws. Arbroath, too, meditated a marriage with the Lady Buccleuch, sister to the Earl of Angus, the regent's nephew and heir ; and when Morton appeared to countenance the match, a clamour arose amongst the young king's friends, that he showed an utter dis regard to the safety of his sovereign. Was not the duke, they said, failing the king, the next heir to the throne? was not Arran, that nobleman's eldest son, mad ? and did not the right of the royal succession devolve on Arbroath ? Had the regent forgotten the ambition of the house of Hamilton, and Arbroath's familiarity with blood ? and would he strengthen the hands of such a man by a marriage in his own family ? If so, he need not look for the support of any faithful subject who tendered the young king's preservation.1 To these were added other causes of disquiet and 1 Murdin, pp. 282, 283."], [239, "1575. REGENCY OF MORTON. 233 difficulty. Morton was no longer popular with the citizens of Edinburgh ; nor, indeed, could he reckon upon the support of any of the middle or lower classes in the state. His exactions had completely disgusted the merchants of the capital. He had imprisoned the most opulent amongst them ; and this caused so great an outcry, that many scrupled not to say, that, if he did not speedily change his measures, the same burghers' hands which had put him up would as surely pull him down again. To all these causes of discon tent, must be added his quarrel with the Kirk, and the soreness arising out of his recent establishment of Episcopacy. This had given mortal offence to some of the leading ministers, who considered the appoint ment of bishops, abbots, and other Roman Catholic dignitaries, to be an unchristian and heterodox prac tice, utterly at variance with the great principles of their Reformation. They arraigned, and with justice as far as regarded the regent, the selfish and venal feelings which had led to the preservation of this alleged relic of popery. It was evident, they said, that avarice, and not religion, was at the root of the whole. The nobles and the laity had already seized a large portion of the church lands, and their greedy eyes still coveted more. These prizes they were determined to retain ; whilst the poor ministers, who laboured in the vineyard, and to whom the thirds of the benefices had been assigned, found this a nominal provision, and were unable, with their utmost efforts, to extract a pittance from the collectors ; the whole of the rents finding their way into the purses of the regent and his favourites. And how utterly ridiculous was this last settlement of the bishops ? Was it not notorious, that the see attached to the primacy of St Andrews belonged, in reality, to Morton himself?"], [240, "1575. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 234 that there was a secret agreement, a nefarious collu sion, between him and the prelate, his own near relative, whom he had placed in it ? Was it not easy to see that the chief purpose of this ecclesiastical office was to enable the regent more readily and decently to suck out the riches of the benefice, as, in the north country, farmers would sometimes stuff a calf's skin, called there a tidchan, and set it up before a cow to make her give her milk more willingly ? What were all these bishops, and abbots, and priors, whom they now heard so much about, but mere tulchans, \u2014 men of straw, clerical calves, \u2014 set up by the nobility to facilitate their own Simoniacal operations ? These arguments, which were enforced with much popular eloquence and humour by those ministers who were attached to the Presbyterian form of church government, produced a great effect upon the people, already sufficiently disgusted by the exactions and tyranny of the regent. Morton, too, increased the discontent by his violence, threatening the most zeal ous of the ministers, and broadly declaring his con viction that there would be no peace or order in the country till some of them were hanged.1 At this crisis, Andrew Melvil, a Scottish scholar of good family, who had been educated first in his native country, and afterwards brought up in the strictest principles of Calvin and Beza at Geneva, returned to Scotland from the continent. He was profoundly skilled in the Greek and Latin languages, and calculated, both by his learning and enthusiasm, to be of essential service to the reviving literature of his country ; but he was rash and imperious, a keen republican, sarcastic and severe in his judgment of 1 Calderwood, MS. Hist. British Museum. Ayscough's Catalogue No. 4735, p. 1053 of the MS."], [241, "1575. REGENCY OF MORTON. 235 others, and with little command of temper. Soon after his arrival he acquired a great influence over Durie, one of the leading ministers of the Kirk, who, at his instigation, began to agitate the question, whether the office of a bishop was consistent with the true prin ciples of church government, as they could be gathered from the Word of God ? After various arguments and consultations held upon the subject, a form of church polity was drawn up by some of the leading ministers ; and the regent, with greater indulgence than his former proceedings had promised, appointed some members of the council to take it into considera tion ; but they had scarcely met, when the state was suddenly plunged into new troubles, which at once broke off their conference. This revolution originated in a coalition of the Earls of Athole and Argyle against the regent. Both these noblemen were of great power and possessions, and could command nearly the whole of the north of Scotland. Athole, a Stewart, was considered the leader of that party which had recently attached themselves to the young king, under the hope of pre vailing upon him to assume the government in his own person. Being a Roman Catholic, he was, for this reason, much suspected by Morton ; and he, in his turn, hated the regent for his cruel conduct to Lethington, to whom Athole had been linked in the closest friendship. Argyle, on the other hand, al though he had formerly been united with Morton in most of his projects, was now completely estranged from his old comrade ; and the cause of quarrel was to be traced to the regent's cupidity. Argyle had married the widow of the Regent Moray, Agnes Keith, a sister of the Earl Marshal, and through her had got possession of some of the richest of the"], [242, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1575. 236 queen's jewels. These Mary had delivered to Moray in a moment of misplaced confidence. He, as w7as asserted, had advanced money upon them to the state; at his death they remained in the hands of his widow ; and Morton now insisted on recovering them, in obe dience to an order given on the subject by parliament. Argyle and his lady resisted ; and although the jewels were at last surrendered, it was not till the noble persons who detained them were threatened with arrest. This, and other causes of dispute, had en tirely alienated Argyle from Morton : but, for a short season, the regent derived security from the sanguinary contests between the two northern earls themselves. Their private warfare, however, which had threatened to involve in broils and bloodshed the whole of the north, was suddenly composed ; and by one of those rapid changes which were by no means unfrequent in feudal Scotland, the two fierce rivals, instead of destroying each other, united in a league against the regent. This new state of things is to be traced to the influence of Alexander Erskine, the go vernor of the king and commander of Stirling castle. This gentleman had recently discovered that Morton, with that subtle and treacherous policy of which he had already given many proofs, was secretly plotting to get possession of the person of the young monarch, and to place >a creature of his own in command of the castle of Stirling. To confound his scheme, Erskine, who was beloved by the higher nobles, and a principal member of the confederacy which had been formed for the king's protection, wrote secretly to Athole and Argyle, inviting them to come to Stirling, assuring them that James was already well disposed to redress their complaints against the regent, and promising them immediate access to the royal person."], [243, "1576. REGENCY OF MORTON. 237 It is scarcely to be believed that these plots and jealousies should have altogether escaped the atten tion of Morton. He had his secret emissaries both in Scotland and in England, and he must have been well aware of his increasing unpopularity. The age of the young king, who had now entered on his twelfth year, and begun to take an interest in the government, admonished him that every succeeding year would render it a more difficult task for any regent to engross the supreme power ; and as long as James remained under the care of Alexander Erskine, whom he had reason to believe his enemy, it was evident that the continuance of his authority must be precarious. Al ready, he saw his sovereign surrounded by those who, for their own ends, sought to persuade him that he was arrived at an age when he ought to take the govern ment into his own hands. So far-sighted and experienced a political intriguer as Morton could not be sensible of all this, without speculating on the best mode of encountering the storm when it did arrive, and averting the wreck of his power. To continue sole regent much longer was evidently full of difficulty ; but to flatter the young monarch by a nominal sovereignty, and to rule him as effectually under the title of king, as he had done when sole regent, would be no arduous matter, con sidering his tender years, provided he could undermine the influence of Erskine his governor, and crush the confederacy with Argyle and Athole. In the mean season, he resolved to await his time and watch their proceedings. But the regent, although cautious and calculating, was not aware of the full extent of the confederacy against him ; and the catastrophe arrived more suddenly than he had anticipated. The intrigues of Argyle and Athole had not escaped the eyes of"], [244, "J 577. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 238 Walsingham ; and in December 1577, Elizabeth, suspecting an impending revolution, despatched Sir Robert Bowes to Scotland, with the hope of prevent ing any open rupture between Morton and the nobility. He was instructed to inculcate the absolute necessity of union, to prevent both themselves and her kingdom from falling a sacrifice to the practices of foreign powers ; and to threaten Morton, that, if he continued refractory, and refused to make up his differences with his opponents, she would make no scruple to cast him off, and herself become a party against him. He carried also a flattering letter from the queen to the Earl of Athole, in which she assured him of her favourable feelings, and recommended peace.1 For a moment, the envoy appears to have succeeded ; but he was aware that the friendship professed on both sides was hollow, and the lull of civil faction only tem porary. This is evident from a letter which he wrote to Leicester, upon his return to Berwick. \"Albeit,\" said he, \" those matters [in Scotland] are for a season wrapped up, yet it is not unlike, without wise handling and some charge to her majesty, that the fire will be readily kindled again. * * * The readiest way, in my opinion, to preserve the realm in quietness, with continuance of this amity, is to appease and 2 all the griefs between the regent and others of the realm, and by friendly reconciliation and union to make him gracious amongst them ; for which he must receive some apt lessons, with gentleness, from her majesty : but with the same, he must also receive 1 MS.

But the queen, who had received some new and alarming information of the success of French intrigue in Scotland, commanded him to revisit Edinburgh, and watch the proceedings of both parties. Even this, however, did not appear enough ; and soon after, Randolph was despatched on a mission to the young king and the regent, its object being similar to that of Bowes, but his instructions more urgent and decided.2 Some delay, however, occurred ; and he had scarcely arrived in Scotland, when the clouds which had been so long gathering burst upon the head of the regent. The rapidity of the movements of the conspirators, and their complete success, were equally remarkable. On the 4th of March, 1577-8, Argyle rode with his usual retinue to Stirling, and being im mediately admitted by Erskine to an interview with the young king, complained loudly of Morton's insolent and oppressive conduct, not only to himself, but to the whole nobility and people. He implored him to call a convention to examine their grievances ; and, if he found them true, to take the government upon himself, and put an end to a system which, whilst it cruelly oppressed his subjects, left him nothing but the name of a king. These arguments were enforced by Erskine the governor ; the famous Buchanan, one of the tutors 1 MS. letter, British Museum, Caligula, C. v. sol. 86, Sir R.

Athole at this time was absent : but he arrived, no doubt by concert, at the moment his presence was most necessary ; and being instantly admitted into the castle, and led to the king, his opinion was urgently demanded. Scarcely, however, had he time to deliver it, and to express his detestation of the tyranny by which they had been so long kept down, when a messenger brought letters from Morton, keenly re probating the conduct of the northern earls. He remonstrated with the king on the outrage committed against his royal person and himself; represented the necessity of inflicting on such bold offenders speedy and exemplary punishment ; and concluded by declar ing his anxiety to resign his office, if his royal master was prepared to overlook such proceedings. This offer was too tempting to be rejected : letters were addressed to the nobility, requiring their instant at tendance at court. Argyle, Athole, and Erskine, took care that those summonses should find their wTay only to their friends. The convention assembled; a reso lution was unanimously passed that the king should take the government upon himself; and before the regent had time to retract, he was waited upon by Glammis the chancellor, and Lord Herries, who brought a message from his sovereign, requiring his immediate resignation. Although startled at the sud denness of the demand, Morton was too proud, or too wary, to pretend any repugnance. He received the envoys with cheerfulness; rode with them from his"], [247, "1577-8. JAMES VI. 241 castle at Dalkeith to the capital; and there, at the Cross, heard the herald and the messenger-at-arms proclaim his own deprivation, and the assumption of the government by the young king. He then, in the presence of the people, resigued the ensigns of his authority ; and, without a murmur or complaint, re tired to one of his country seats, where he seemed wholly to forget his ambition, and to be entirely en grossed in the tranquil occupations of husbandry and gardening. The news of this revolution was instantly commu nicated by Randolph to his friend Killigrew, in this laconic and characteristic epistle, written when he was on the eve of throwing himself on horseback to proceed to England, and in person inform Elizabeth of the alarming change. \" All the devils in hell are stirring and in great rage in this country. The regent is discharged, the country broken, the chancellor slain by the Earl of Crawford, four killed of the town out of the castle, and yet are we in hope of some good quietness, by the great wisdom of the Earl of Morton. There cometh to her majesty from hence an ambassador shortly. I know not yet who, but Sandy Hay in his company. It be hoveth me to be there before : and so show my wife.\"1 The death of the chancellor, Lord Glammis, here alluded to by Randolph, was in no way connected with the revolution which he describes, but took place in a casual scuffle between his retinue and that of the Earl of Crawford. His high office was bestowed upon Athole, Morton's chief enemy, and the leader of the confederacy which had deposed him. But this, though 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Randolph to Killigrew, 20th March, 1577 \u2014 that is, 1577-8. Signed jocularly, Thomazo del Niente. Sandy Hay was Alexander Hay, clerk-register.

Meanwhile, the confederated nobles followed up their advantages. As the king had not yet completed his twelfth year, a council of twelve was appointed. It consisted of the Earls of Argyle, Athole, Montrose, and Glencairn ; the Lords Ruthven, Lindsay, and Herries ; the Abbots of Newbottle and Dunfermline ; the Prior of St Andrews ; and two supernumerary or extraordinary councillors \u2014 Buchanan the king's tutor, and James Makgill the clerk-register. All royal letters were to be signed by the king and four of this number ; and as the first exercise of their power, they required from Morton the delivery of the castle of Edinburgh, the palace of Holyrood, the mint, and the queen's jewels and treasure. To all this prostration of his former greatness, he appears to have made no resistance ; but simply requested, that, in the next parliament, they should pass an act approving of his administration during his continuance in the regency. Morton then held a hurried conference with Randolph, before that ambassador set off for the English court, intrusted him with a brief letter to Lord Burghley, written in his new character as a private man,1 and seemed prepared, with perfect contentment, to sink into that condition. It was evident, however, from the expressions he used in this short note, that he had informed Randolph of some ulterior design for his resumption of power, which he did not choose to commit to writing ; and that the ambassador, long versant in Scottish broils 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, the Earl Morton to Lord Burghley, March 28, 1578. He signs simply, \" Morton.\""], [249, "1578. JAMES VI. 243 and intrigues, considered it a wise and likely project. Nor was he wrong in this conclusion : for the develop ment of this counter-revolution, which restored Morton to power, followed almost immediately ; and the out break was as sudden as the success was complete. The king's lords, as Argyle and his friends were called, had formed their council,1 assembled in the capital, conferred the chancellor's place on Athole, and proclaimed a parliament to be held on the 10th of June. On the 24th of April, the General Assembly met at Edinburgh ; and having chosen Mr Andrew Melvil to be their moderator, proceeded to their deliberations with their usual zeal and energy. It was determined to revise the Book of Church Polity, and lay it before the king and council ; and a blow was aimed at the late episcopal innovations, by a declaration that, owing to the great corruption already visible in the state of bishops, no see should be filled up till the next General Assembly of the church.2 During these transactions Morton lived in retirement, and appeared wholly engrossed in his rural occupations ; but he had secretly gained to his interest the young Earl of Mar, whose sister was the wife of Angus, Morton's heir, and the head of the house of Douglas. To Mar, he art fully represented that he was unjustly and shamefully treated by his uncle, Erskine the governor. He, the young earl, who was no longer a boy, was entitled by hereditary right to the government of Stirling castle ; but his uncle usurped it, and with it kept hold of the king's person. It was Alexander Erskine, not the Earl of Mar, who was now considered the head of that ancient house. Would he submit to this ignominy, 1 MS. Record of the Privy-council, in Register-house, Edinburgh, March 24, 1577-8. 2 MS. Calderwood, pp. 1055-1059."], [250, "1578. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 244 when, by a bold stroke, he might recover his lost rights; when the house of Douglas, with all its strength and vassalage, was ready to take his part ; and his uncles, the Abbots of Dryburgh and Cambus kenneth, offered their counsel and assistance ? These arguments easily gained over the young lord ; and as he and his retinue were generally lodged in the castle, he determined to put Morton's plan in execution. On the 26th April, about five in the morning, before many of the garrison were stirring, Mar, who had slept that night in the castle, assembled his retinue, under the pretence of a hunting party, and riding to the gates with the Abbots of Dryburgh and Cambus kenneth, called for the keys. He was met by his uncle, Erskine the governor, with a small company, who for the moment suspected nothing ; but finding himself rudely accosted as a usurper by the abbots, instantly dreaded some false playr. To shout treason, seize a halbert from one of the guard, and call to his servants, was with Erskine the work of a moment ; but, ere assistance arrived, his little band was surrounded, his son crushed to death in the tumult, and himself thrust without the gates into an outer hall, whilst Mar seized the keys, put down all resistance, and became master of the castle. In the midst of this uproar the young king awoke, and rushing in great terror from his chamber, tore his hair, and called out that the Master of Erskine was slain. He was assured that his governor was safe ; and the Earl of Argyle, who had been roused by the tumult, finding the two abbots arguing with Erskine in the hall, but showing him no personal violence, affected to consider it a family quarrel between the uncle and the nephew, and retired, after advising an amicable adjustment. News of the tumult was, that evening, carried to the council at"], [251, "1578. JAMES VI. 245 Edinburgh, accompanied by an assurance from Mar, Argyle, and Buchanan the king's tutor, that the dis pute was adjusted. Upon this they despatched Mon trose, the same night, to Stirling, who, coming alone, was courteously received and admitted into the castle ; but next day, when the council rode thither in a body and demanded admittance, this was peremptorily re fused by Mar. They should all see the king, he said, but it must be one by one ; and no councillor should enter the gates with more than one attendant.1 Incensed at this indignity, the council assembled in Stirling, and issued a proclamation, prohibiting any resort of armed men thither, whilst they sent secret orders to convoke their own forces. But their measures were too late ; Douglas of Lochleven had already entered the castle, joined Mar, and communicated with Morton, whose hand, it was strongly suspected, although it did not appear, had managed the whole. Angus, meantime, by his directions, was ready, at six hours' warning, with all the armed vassals of the house of Douglas ; and the ex-regent, forgetting his gardens and pleasure grounds, hurried from his rural seclusion, and reappeared in public, the same subtle, daring, and unscrupulous leader as before. 2 Events now crowded rapidly on each other. At the earnest request of the young king, an agreement took 1 MS. Calderwood, British Museum, p. 1061.

In this letter of Bowes to Burghley, written in the midst of this revolution, and on the very day the council rode to Stirling, he says, \" What storm shall fall out of these swelling heats, doth not yet appear. But I think, verily, within two or three days, it will burst into some open matter, discovering suffi ciently the purposes intended ; wherein, to my power, I shall seek to quench all violent rages, and persuade to unity and concord amongst them.\""], [252, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1578. 246 place between Mar and his uncle, Alexander Erskine. The earl retained the castle of Stirling, and with it the custody of the royal person. To the Master of Erskine, so Alexander was called, was given the keeping of the castle of Edinburgh ; and in a meeting held at Craigmillar, between Morton, Athole, and Argyle, it was decided that they should next day repair together to Stirling, and adjust all differences before the king in person. This was determined on the 8th of May ; and that evening the two northern earls, after sharing Morton's hospitality at Dalkeith, rode with him to Edinburgh. In the morning, how ever, the ex-regent was nowhere to be found ; and it turned out that he had risen before daybreak, and, with a small retinue, had galloped to Stirling, where he was received within the castle, and soon resumed his ascendency both over Mar and the king.1 Against this flagrant breach of agreement, Argyle and Athole loudly remonstrated ; and Sir Robert Bowes, the English ambassador, exerting himself to restore peace, the young monarch summoned a conven tion of his nobles ; but the northern earls and their associates received such a proposal with derision, and sent word by Lord Lindsay, that they would attend no convention held by their enemies, within a fortress Avhich they commanded. Other lords obeyed, but came fully armed, and with troops of vassals at their back ; and both factions mustered in such strength, and exhibited such rancour, that, but for the remon strances of Bowes, the country would have hurried into war. Amidst the clamour and confusion, however, it was 1 MS. Calderwood, British Museum. Ayscough, 4735, p. 1061. Also, original draft, State-paper Office, Articles delivered by Argyle.

It was next determined to send the Abbot of Dunfermline as ambassador from the young king to Elizabeth. He was instructed to thank that princess for the special favour with which she had re garded him from his birth, to confirm the peace between the two countries, and to propose a stricter league for mutual defence, and the maintenance of true religion.1 The parliament had been summoned to meet in July at Edinburgh: but Morton was well aware of his unpopularity in that city, and dreaded to bring the king into the midst of his enemies. By his persuasion, therefore, the young monarch changed the place of assembly to the great hall within Stirling castle, where he knew all would be secure. But this new measure gave deep offence ; and when the day ap- proached, Argyle, Athole, Montrose, Lindsay, and Merries, with their adherents, assembled in the capital, declaring that nothing should compel them to attend a parliament within a citadel garrisoned by their mortal enemies, and where it would be a mockery to expect any free discussion. Despising this opposition, Morton hurried on his measures, and the estates assembled in the great hall within Stirling castle.2 It was opened by the king in person ; but scarcely had the members taken their seats, when Montrose and Lord Lindsay presented themselves as commissioners from Argyle, Athole, and their adherents, and declared that this could in no sense be called a free parliament. It was held, they said, within an armed fortress; and for this cause the noble peers, whose messengers they were, had 1 MS. draft, State-paper Office, June 18, 1578. 8 July 16, 1578."], [254, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1578 248 refused to attend it ; \" and we now come,\" said Lind say, with his usual brevity and bluntness, \" to protest against its proceedings.\" Morton here interrupted him, and commanded him and his companion to take their places; to which Lindsay answered, that he would stand there till the king ordered him to his seat. James then repeated the command, and the old lord sat down. After a sermon, which was preached by Duncanson the minister of the royal household, and a harangue by Morton, who, in the absence of Athole the chancellor, took upon him to fill his place, the estates proceeded to choose the Lords of the Articles ; upon which Lindsay again broke in upon the proceed ings, calling all to witness, that every act of such a parliament was null, and the choosing of the lords an empty farce. This second attack threw Morton into an ungovernable rage, in which he unsparingly abused his old associate. \" Think ye, sir,\" said he, \" that this is a court of churls or brawlers ? Take your own place, and thank God that the king's youth keeps you safe from his resentment.\" \u2014 \" I have served the king in his minority,\" said Lindsay, \" as faithfully as the proudest among ye ; and I think to serve his grace no less truly in his majority.\" Upon which Morton was observed to whisper something in the king's ear, who, blushing and hesitating, delivered himself of a little speech, which, no doubt, had been prepared for him beforehand. \" Lest any man,\" said he, \" should judge this not to be a free parliament, I declare it free ; and those who love me will think as I think.\"1 This silenced Lindsay, and the proceedings went on; but Montrose, abruptly leaving the hall, rode post to Edinburgh. It was reported that he bore a secret 1 MS. Calderwood, British Museum, pp. 1062, 1065."], [255, "1578. JAMES VI. 249 letter from the king, imploring his subjects to arm and relieve him from the tyranny of Morton. It is certain that the recusant earl drew a vivid picture of the late regent's insolence, and roused the citizens to such a pitch of fury, that they mustered in arms, and de clared that they would rescue their sovereign from the hands of a traitor who had sold them to the English. Nothing could be more grateful to Argyle and Athole than such a spirit ; and sending word to the townsmen, that they would speedily join them with a force which would soon bring their enemies to reason, they sum moned their feudal services, and prepared for war.1 Montrose's sudden retreat saved him from imprison ment ; for next day an order of privy council appeared, commanding him and Lindsay his associate to confine themselves to their own lodgings under pain of rebel lion.2 In the meantime, the parliament proceeded. Morton's demission of the regency, and the king's acceptance of the government, were confirmed : an ample approval and discharge was given him of all the acts done during his regency, and a new council appointed, in which he himself sat as chief, and could, in any emergency, command a majority. The revolu tion was thus complete. He had lost the name of regent, but he had retained his power ; and the nomi nal assumption of the government by the young king had removed many difficulties which before trammelled and perplexed him.3 But this daring and experienced politician had men to deal with who, having been trained in his own 1 MS. letter, British Museum, Caligula, C. v. sol. 101, Lord Hunsdon to Burghley, August 19, 1578, Berwick. s MS.

It was in vain that Sir Robert Bowes, the English ambassador, remon strated against this ; in vain that a charge from the privy council was fulminated against the two earls, commanding them, on pain of treason, to depart from Edinburgh within twenty-four hours. Both sides flew to'arms : the country, so lately restored to peace, again resounded with warlike preparation : proclamations, and counter-proclamations, were discharged against each other ; summonses for their armed vassals issued in every direction ; and so readily were the orders obeyed, that Argyle and Athole, who had marched out of Edinburgh on the 11th August with only one thousand men, found themselves, on mustering at Falkirk on the 13th, seven thousand strong. Of these troops the greater part were animated by the deadliest hatred of Morton, especially the hardy bands of the Merse and Teviotdale, led by their wardens, Coldingknowes and Cessford. They carried before them a banner of blue sarcenet, on which was painted a boy within a grated window, with the distich, \"Liberty I crave, and cannot it have.\"1 This was meant to represent the king's thraldom to Morton ; and below it was their answer, declaring that they would die to set him free.

JAMES VI. 251 general to the king, with a body of five thousand men ; and the skirmishing between the advanced parties of each army had commenced, when Sir Robert Bowes, accompanied by Lawson and Lindsay, the two prin cipal ministers of the kirk, rode hastily from the capital, and again offered himself, in the name of his mistress the Queen of England, as a peacemaker be tween the rival factions.1 In this humane office, after prolonged and bitter discussions, he was successful. The young king, or rather Morton in his name, declared, that, foreseeing the wreck and misery of the realm, if the present divisions were not speedily removed, he was ready to meet the wishes of the Queen of England ; and there fore commanded his nobility, on both sides, to disband their forces. To reassure Argyle and Athole's faction, their late conduct in taking arms was accepted as loyal service ; Argyle, Lindsay, and Morton, so recently denounced traitors, were added to the privy council ; a committee of eight noblemen was to be chosen, to advise with the king upon the best mode of reconciling his nobility ; and, from this moment, free access was to be afforded to all noblemen, barons, or gentlemen, who came to offer their service to their prince.2 To these conditions both parties agreed ; and by the judi cious management of Bowes, Scotland was saved for the present from the misery of civil war. This minister, after the service he had thus per formed, remained for some time resident ambassador at the Scottish court, where Morton's successful intrigues had once more established him as the chief ruler in the state ; a result which was viewed with 1 MS. Calderwood, p. 1071. 2 MS. State-paper Office, copy of the time, Articles agreed on in Scotland between the King and the Lords, 13th August, 1678."], [258, "1578. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 252 much satisfaction by Elizabeth, who, even after his demission of his high office, had never ceased to give him the title of regent.1 For the name, however, he cared little ; it was power to which he looked ; and this, having for the moment secured, he was deter mined not speedily again to lose. The great principles upon which he had hitherto conducted the government, were a strict amity with England, opposition to all foreign intrigue, a determined resistance to the deli verance of the Scottish queen, and a resolution to maintain the Protestant reformation. On this last important point, however, his motives had become suspected by the influential body of the ministers of the kirk. This was owing to his introduction into Scotland of the episcopal form of church government, and his resistance to the Book of Church Polity which had been drawn up by the General Assembly, and presented to the king and the three estates for their approval. Yet still, although no longer the favourite of the clergy, Morton was anti-Catholic enough to be preferred by them to Athole, a professed Roman Catholic, and his associates, wdio, for the most part, were either avowed or suspected Roman ists ; and for the present the ministers refrained from endangering the restored peace of the country by any violence of opposition. Yet it was impossible for any acute observer not to see that the times were precarious. The elements of discord were lulled in their active efforts, but not destroyed ; the intrigues of France and Spain for the deliverance of Mary, and the re-establishment of the ancient faith, were still busily carried on ; and Bowes, the ambassador, who from long experience was inti- 1 Instructions to Randolph, 31st January, 1578, Caligula, C. v. sol. Ill, British Museum."], [259, "1578. JAMES VI. 253 mately acquainted with the state of the rival factions, regarded the court and the country as on the eve of another change. On the 3d November, shortly pre vious to his leaving Scotland, he thus wrote from Edinburgh to Lord Burghley : \u2014 \" By my common letters to the lords of her majes ty's council, the weltering estate of this realm, that now attendeth but a tide for a new alteration of the court, will appear to your lordship, and how necessary it is in this change approaching, and in the confedera cies presently knitting, to get some hold for her majesty amongst them.\" x It had been his own earnest endea vour to get such hold over them ; and for this purpose he had entered into negotiations with the Earl of Caithness, one of the principal leaders of the confede racy against Morton. He and his associates had sent articles of agreement, in the usual form, to the Eng lish ambassador : but they expected also the usual gratuity, and, as it turned out, valued their devotion to Elizabeth at a higher rate than that parsimonious princess was disposed to reckon it. Caithness, indeed, was of loose and accommodating principles, both in politics and religion ; and although Bowes flattered himself that, on his departure from Scotland, he had left the faction opposed to Morton very favourably disposed to England, he did not conceal from Wal singham his apprehensions that the continuance of this feeling Avas precarious. \" I fear,\" said he, in his letter to this minister, \"that no great inwardness shall be found in them, when they find her majesty's liberality coming slowly to them, that use not often at the fairest call to stoop to empty lure.\" 2 1 MS. letter, British Museum, Caligula, C. v. sol. 109, Sir R.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 254 These apprehensions of the English minister regard ing the unsettled state of Scotland were not without good foundation. Mary's indefatigable friend, the Bishop of Ross, whose intrigues in the affair of the Duke of Norfolk had already given such alarm to Elizabeth, was now busily employed on the continent, exciting France, Spain, Germany, and the papal court, to unite for her deliverance ; and holding out the present crisis of affairs in Scotland as eminently favour able for the restoration of the true faith. The extent to which these operations were carried, was amply proved by a packet of intercepted letters, written in cipher, and seized by Walsingham or Burghley, whose spies and informers were scattered all over Europe. It was found that the Earl of Athole, a Roman Catholic, the great leader of the late cabal against Morton, and chancellor of Scotland, was in constant correspondence with the Bishop of Ross. The letters of the Scottish queen herself, written immediately after Morton's resignation of the regency, to the same prelate, and directed to be communicated to the pope, expressed her satisfaction at the late revolution in Scotland, and her zealous concurrence with his holiness in his pro ject for the restitution of the true faith in Britain, by the united efforts of the great Catholic powers. She alluded, in the same letter, to a project for the carrying off her son, the young king, to the continent, which the pope had offered to forward by an advance of money. She informed him, that in consequence of the changes in Scotland since Morton's demission, she felt perfectly assured of the affection and services of the young prince, and of his counsellors ; she urged the necessity of placing him, if possible, in the hands of her friends of the house of Lorraine \u2014 alluding to the imminent danger he incurred from Elizabeth's intrigues to get"], [261, "1578. JAMES VT. 255 possession of his person, or even to deprive him of his life. She declared her conviction, that if her son were once in France, and removed from the sphere of Eliza beth's influence, a more lenient treatment of herself would ensue ; and, lastly, she directed Ross to com municate upon all these matters with the pope's nuncio at Paris.1 In an interecpted letter, written about the same time by Beaton bishop of Glasgow, Mary's ambassador at the court of France, to the Bishop of Ross, the determination of Henry the Third and the Duke of Guise to assist her to their utmost, was clearly inti mated.2 In the autumn of the same year, and soon after the pacification between the rival factions in Scotland, which we have seen effected by Bowes, the Bishop of Ross made a progress into Germany, with the object of exciting the emperor and the duke of Bavaria to unite with the other Catholic powers for the speedy liberation of his royal mistress, and the restoration of religion. From both potentates he re ceived the utmost encouragement. The emperor de clared his readiness to co-operate with the endeavours of his brother princes for the deliverance of the Scot tish queen, and the securing to her and her son their undoubted right to the English throne ; and the duke professed his determination to peril both property and life itself for the restoration of the Catholic faith.3 This encouraging information was conveyed by Ross to the Cardinal Como, in a letter written from Prague on the 27th September, 1578, which, unfortunately 1 MS.

In a second interview, to which the emperor admitted him, he described the state of parties in Scotland, following certain directions communicated by his royal mistress ;2 and by all these united exertions, there is no doubt that a deep impres sion was made throughout Europe in favour of the Scottish queen. Well, therefore, might Sir Robert Bowes describe the condition of affairs in Scotland as one full of alarm ; and before we condemn Eliza beth for her severity to Mary, we must weigh the perils to the Protestant cause which these intercepted letters so clearly demonstrated. But, on the other hand, it must not be forgotten, that these very dangers arose out of the injustice of her imprisonment. In the meantime, Morton once more bore the chief sway in Scotland, where his triumph over the conspiracy of Athole and Argyle had really increased his power ; whilst his possession of the king's person enabled him to overawe the j7oung monarch as effectually as he had ever done when regent. This resumption of strength he now employed to crush the house of Hamilton. The Duke of Chastelherault was dead ; his eldest son, the Earl of Arran, had been insane for some years ; and in these melancholy circumstances, the leaders of this potent and ancient family were his brothers, the Lord of Arbroath and Lord Claud Hamilton. Arbroath, in the event of the death of Mary and the young king, 1 MS. British Museum, Caligula, C. v. sol. 105. 2 Ibid. sol. 106."], [263, "1579.

But although his enmity against Arbroath and his brother was entirely selfish, Morton was not guilty of injustice when he persuaded the young king that it was his duty to proceed with severity against the house of Hamilton : it had a long reckoning of crime and blood to account for. There was little doubt that the late Archbishop of St Andrews, its chief leader and adviser, had suf fered justly as an accessary to the murder of Darnley ; and this cast a strong suspicion of implication upon its present leaders. It was certain that they were guilty of the death of the Regent Moray ; it was as undoubted that Lord Claud Hamilton had given the order which led to the murder of the Regent Lennox ; and the houses of Mar and Douglas were bitterly hostile to the whole race. The Hamiltons being thus miserably situated, the terrible work of feudal retribution commenced, and was prosecuted in the rapid and cruel spirit of the times. Morton and Angus in person besieged the castle of Hamilton, commanded by Arthur Hamilton of Merton.2 He offered to surrender on being assured of his life, and pardon to himself and his garrison of all their offences, except the murder of the king and the two regents ; but these terms were scornfully 1 MS.

He and his company, therefore, were hanged ; amongst whom was Arthur Hamilton, a brother of Bothwellhaugh who had shot the regent, and who was known to have held the stirrup when the murderer threw himself on horseback and escaped.2 The castle of Draffen, another strong hold of this great family, in which the Duchess of Chastelherault and the unfortunate Earl of Arran had taken refuge, was invested and taken about the same time, its garrison having abandoned it during the night; and in a convention of the nobility held soon after at Stirling, it was determined to complete the ruin of this devoted house by processes of treason in the next parliament. Nothing could be more wretched than its condition at this moment : the Lord of Ar broath had fled to Flanders, where he was an almost houseless exile ; Lord Claud escaped to England, and threw himself upon the compassion of Elizabeth ; its lesser chiefs were trembling under an impending sen tence of forfeiture ; and its head, the Earl of Arran, whose royal descent and great power had made him, in former days, an almost accepted suitor, first of Eliza beth, and afterwards of Mary, was a prisoner, hope- 1 MS. letter to Sir George Bowes, from (as I suspect) Mr Archibald Douglas, Edinburgh, May 24, 1579, copy of the time, Bowes Papers. 2 MS.

Yet these accumu lated miseries do not appear to have excited the slightest degree of sympathy in this unfeeling age ; and when Elizabeth, compassionating the misfortunes of the Hamiltons, despatched her envoy, Captain Arrington, to plead their cause at the Scottish court, he found the young king, and the whole body of the nobility, in flamed with the deepest hatred against them, expressing a conviction that their restoration would be dangerous to his person, and resolute against their pardon or return.1 In the midst of these cruel transactions, Athole the chancellor, and the great leader of the confederacy against Morton, died suddenly, under circumstances of much suspicion.2 He had just returned from a banquet, given by Morton at Stirling to commemorate the reconciliation of the nobles ; and the symptoms of poison so strongly indicated themselves both before and after death, that his friends did not hesitate to say publicly, that he had met with foul play from the ex-regent, who, however, treated the report with contempt.

By some the poison was so plainly detected, that they declared there was not a doubt upon the subject; whilst Dr Preston, the most eminent physician of the time, was equally positive that there was no poison in the case, \u2014 certainly none in the stomach. On being irri tated by contradiction, however, he had the temerity to touch a portion of its contents with his tongue, and, to the triumph of his dissentient brethren, almost died in consequence, nor did he ever completely recover the unlucky experiment.1 In the meantime, though the dark report was thus strengthened, Morton's power, and the absence of all direct proof, protected him from any farther proceedings. Some time after this, the General Assembly of the Kirk met at Edinburgh ; and having chosen Mr Thomas Smeton for their moderator, at his request appointed a council of the brethren to advise with him upon matters of importance. To this council Mr Thomas Duncanson, minister of the royal household, presented a letter from the young king, which con tained a request, that the Assembly would at present abstain from debating upon such matters touching the polity of the Kirk, as in a former conference had been referred for debate and decision to the estates of parliament. The same letter informed them, that parliament would shortly meet and take these matters into consideration ; and it expressed the king's hope, that, in the mean season, the Assembly would exert themselves to promote peace and godly living, not only amongst their own members, but throughout the whole body of the subjects of the realm ; so that the expectations of such busy meddlers as were enemies to the public tranquillity, should be disappointed. 1 MS.

These were, that he would interdict all parents, under heavy penalties, from sending their children to be educated at the university of Paris, or other foreign colleges professing papistry ; that he would cause the univer sity of St Andrews, some of whose professors had recently left the Protestant communion, to be re formed in all its colleges and foundations ; and take order for the banishment of Jesuits, whom the As sembly denominated \" the pestilent dregs of a most detestable idolatry.\" They further besought him to proceed to a farther conference upon such points of church polity as had been left undetermined at the last conference at Stirling, and to desist from con trolling or suspending, by his royal letters, any of the decrees of the General Assembly.1 Calderwood, the zealous and able historian of the Scottish Kirk, has pronounced a high eulogium upon the learning, holi ness, and unanimity of this Assembly.2 Not long after this, Esme Stewart, commonly called Monsieur D'Aubigny, cousin to the king, and a youth of graceful figure and accomplishments, arrived in Scotland.3 He was the son of John Stewart, brother of Matthew earl of Lennox, the late regent, and had scarce been a week at court when he became a great 1 MS.

It was immediately whispered, that he had been sent over by the Guises, to fill Athole's place as leader of the French faction, and to act as a counterpoise to the predominating in fluence of Morton. He was accompanied by Monsieur Momberneau, and Mr Henry Ker, \u2014 the first a man of great wit and liveliness, gay, gallant, and excelling in all the sports and pastimes to which the young monarch was partial; the second, Ker, of a more subtle and retired character, \u2014 who had been long a confidential servant of D'Aubigny's, and was strongly suspected by the ministers of the Kirk to be a secret agent of the Guises. All this excited the fears of Elizabeth ; and the information sent her by her secret agents, both in Scotland and France, was by no means calculated to remove her apprehension. As D'Aubigny and his friends, however, acted as yet with great caution and reserve, the queen contented herself, for the moment, with a mission of observation and inquiry ; for which she selected Captain Nicolas Arrington, a brave and intelligent officer of the garrison of Berwick, who had already been repeatedly employed in Scotland. His open instructions were to intercede with James for some favour to the Hamiltons; his more secret orders, to acquaint himself with the character and intentions of D'Aubigny, the state of parties, and what projects were then agitated for the young king's marriage. On the first point, the pardon, or at least the more lenient punishment of the house of Hamilton, he prevailed nothing, so deep was James's hatred, or perhaps more truly that of Morton, against it. With regard to the marriage, Arrington informed Burghley, that neither the council nor D'Aubigny had yet made any formal proposal upon the subject. \" It was evident,\""], [269, "1579. JAMES VI. 263 he said, \" that the young French stranger had already won the affection of his royal kinsman, and might look for high preferment,\" probably to be Earl of Lennox, with a large share of the forfeited lands of the Hamiltons, if he could be prevailed upon to change his religion.1 The old soldier who thus wrote to Burghley, re quested his indulgence, should his information prove incorrect, as he had been more familiar with \" another weapon than the pen ;\"' but the course of events soon proved the accuracy of his intelligence. Wherever James went, he insisted on having D'Aubigny beside him. When he removed, for the purpose of holding his parliament, from Stirling to Holyrood, his graceful cousin had splendid apartments provided for him in the palace, next to the royal bed-chamber ; and in the sports and pageants with which the citizens received their monarch, the favourite, for so he was now de clared, found himself universally regarded and courted. The expensive scale on which these civic festivities were conducted, evinced a remarkable increase in the national wealth. They exhibited the usual confusion of classical, feudal, and religious machinery ; in which \" Dame Musick,\" attended by four fair virgins repre senting the cardinal virtues, and the provost and three hundred citizens, clad in velvet and satin, enacted their parts with great assiduity and success. Whilst the 20th Psalm was being sung, a little child emerged from a silver globe, which opened artificially over the king's head, and fluttering down to his majesty's feet, presented him with the keys of the city. Reli gion, a grave matron, then conducted him into the High Church ; and thence, after hearing sermon, the 1 MS. letter, British Museum, Caligula, C. v. sol. 130, Nicolas Arrington to Burghley, October 10, 1579, Berwick."], [270, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1579. 264 monarch and the congregation repaired to the Market Cross, where Bacchus sat on a gilded puncheon, with his painted garments and a flowery garland : the fountains ran wine ; the principal street of the city was hung with tapestry ; and, at the conclusion of the procession, the town presented the king with a cup board of plate, valued, says a^minute chronicler, at six thousand merks.1 These pageants were introductory to the parliament w7hich assembled on the 20th of October, and, as had been^anticipated by Arrington, was principally occupied with the proscription of the Hamiltons, and the exaltation of D'Aubigny. The Lord Arbroath and Lord Claud Hamilton, with many more of the same name and house, were proclaimed traitors, and their estates forfeited ; whilst all who had been partakers in the slaughter of the two regents, Moray and Lennox, were commanded, under pain of death, to remove six miles from court. On the other hand, the king con ferred the earldom of Lennox upon his favourite, and presented him, at the same time, with the rich abbacy of Arbroath. Not long after, the stream of royal favour flowed still more munificently : he was made cham berlain for Scotland ; his earldom, it was reported, would be soon erected into a dukedom ; and he was so caressed by the young sovereign, that Argyle and many of the principal nobility began not only to treat him wTith high consideration, but, according to the common usage of the times, to enter into those bands or covenants by which they bound themselves to his service, and with which the reader of this history is already so well acquainted.2 1 Moyse's Memoirs, Bannatyne edition, p. 25.

When these fears were once excited, the churches resounded with warnings against the dark machinations of popery ; and the pulpit, as had fre quently happened in these times, became a political engine. It was recollected that the Duke of Guise had accompanied D'Aubigny to Dieppe, and remained with him for many hours in secret conference in the ship ; D'Aubigny had been known, also, to have had consultations with the Bishops of Glasgow and Ross ; x and for what purpose (so the ministers argued) could the forty thousand crowns, which he brought with him, be so naturally applied as in corrupting the Protestant nobles ? Nay, was it not known that a part had already found its way into the coffers of the Lady Argyle ; and did not all men see the warm and sud den friendship between her husband the earl and the favourite ? 2 Amid these suspicions and jealousies the year 1579 passed away ; and it was apparent to all who regarded the state of the country with attention, that it could not long remain without some sudden change or con vulsion.

The nobility, on the other hand, were rich ; they had prospered as the crown had sunk ; and so determined were they to hold fast their gains, that they \" would spare nothing they possessed to the king's aid, without deadly feud.\" 1 It had been earnestly recommended, that the king's person, in those unsettled times, should be defended by a body-guard, and that six privy councillors, in rotation, should always remain with the court ; but no funds could be raised to pay the soldiers' wages ; the councillors refused to support a table for themselves ; no money was forthcoming elsewhere ; and the king was fre quently left almost alone, without court or council around him ; a state of destitution which, it was justly apprehended, might lead to the most dangerous results. When Elphinston, abbot of Dunfermline, was sent to England, in the preceding summer,2 his main pur pose was to explain to the queen the poverty under which the young prince had entered on his govern ment ; the great insecurity of his person, surrounded as he daily was by men \" who had dipped their hands in the blood of his parents and dearest kinsfolks ;\" and the absolute necessity for a supply of money to pay the expenses of his guards and household.3 But Elizabeth could not be induced to advance any sup plies ; and these evils and dangers had ever since been on the increase.

But Morton's great wealth, his energy, cou rage, and experience, made him still a formidable enemy ; and they who most wished his downfal, knew not on what side to attack him. The young king, in the meantime, who had always felt an awe for the late regent, became daily more devoted to Lennox, whom, with a boyish enthusiasm, and a precocious display of theology, he was labouring to convert from what he esteemed his religious errors. He gave him books of controversy, brought him to attend the ser mons of the ministers, procured one of the mildest and most learned of their number to instruct him, and so far succeeded, that, if not converted, he was reported to be favourably inclined to the Protestant church. Any sudden recantation would have been suspicious ; and, meanwhile, his royal and youthful mentor con gratulated himself upon his favourite's hopeful and inquiring state.1 Amid these cares and controversies a sudden rumour arose, none could tell from what quarter, that the Earl of Morton had plotted to seize the king and carry him to Dalkeith. How this was to be effected, no one could tell ; but James, who had ridden out on a hunting expedition, precipitately interdicted the sports, and galloped back to Stirling castle. Morton loudly declared his innocence, and defied his calum- 1 MS.

In the midst of these ominous rumours, the night of the 10th April arrived, and all in the castle prepared for an attack. Mar permitted none to see the king; soldiers were stationed within and without the royal chamber ; and a shout arising, that Lennox ought to be thrust out of the gates, he shut himself up in his apartments, with a strong guard of his friends, armed at all points, and swore that he would set upon any that dared invade him. In the morning, Argyle, Sutherland, Glencairn, and other adherents of Len nox, hurried to Stirling, but were refused admittance to the castle ; and their fears for Lennox increased, when they heard it reported, that Morton was on the road to join his party. All was thus in terror and uncertainty : men gazed, trembled, and whispered fearfully amongst each other, aware that secret plots 1 MS. letter, British Museum, Caligula, C. vi. sol. 8, Captain Ar lington to Lord Burghley, 16th April, J 580, Berwick."], [275, "1580.

At this moment Captain Arrington, Eliza beth's envoy, was in Stirling castle, and thus wrote to Burghley : \" The young king is in heavy case, and much amazed with these troubles, and the more by reason of his great affection towards D'Aubigny, whom he perceives the mark they shoot at. Monsieur D'Aubigny, with his faction, doth offer to abide the trial by law, or otherwise, in their very persons, that there was never any such plot or meaning by him, or his consent, or by any others to their knowledge, to have drawn the king either to Dunbarton or any other sinister course.\"1 It is difficult to arrive at the truth amidst these conflicting accusations of the two factions. Elizabeth certainly had received a warning from her ambassador in France, that there was a design on foot to have the young king brought thither ; and Morton had probably been encouraged by the English queen to prevent it by every possible means.2 Lennox, on the other hand, although he indignantly, and probably truly, repelled any such treasonable intentions, avowed his wish to reform the council, and protect the king from the pillage of the blood-suckers of the royal revenue, who had been thrust into their offices by Morton and Mar. In this project James himself appears to have borne a part ; and had probably intended, under pretence of a hunting party at the Doune of Menteith, to have escaped from the tutelage of Mar, and accomplished a 1 MS. letter, British Museum, Caligula, C. vi. sol. 7, Arrington to Walsingham or Burghley, 10th April, 1580, Stirling.

In the meantime, the picture drawn by Arrington, of the dangerous state of the country, threw Elizabeth into alarm, and she immediately despatched Sir Robert Bowes to Stirling. His instructions were to strengthen, by every means, the decaying influence of Morton ; to declare the queen's willingness to gain some of the chief in authority by pensions ; to pull down the power of Lennox ; to plead for the pardon of the Hamiltons ; and thoroughly to sift the truth of the late rumours of a conspiracy for carrying off the young king. Bowes also, before he set out, received a letter from Secretary Walsingham, recommending him to use the utmost vigilance in this mission. This, he said, was most necessary, as it was already reported in Spain, that mass was set up once more in Scotland, and arms taken against the Protestants ; and, as he knew for certain that Kerr of Fernyhirst, a Roman Catholic and an active friend of the Scottish queen, with Bothwellhaugh, the blood-stained Hamilton who had shot the Regent Moray, had recently ridden post from France into Spain.2 On reaching court, the ambassador was received by the young king with great courtesy : but James's manner instantly changed when any allusion was made to the Hamiltons ; and it was evident to all that Bowes' exertions on this head would be unavailing.3 It was apparent, also, that the revival of Morton's formerpower promised to be a matter of extreme difficulty.

In a secret conference, held in the night, with Bowes, at Stirling castle, the ex-regent expressed much doubt whether it was not too late to attempt any thing against Lennox, who now professed himself a Protes tant, and had so completely conciliated the ministers of the Kirk, that they addressed a letter in his com mendation to the council.1 As to the late rumoured conspiracies for carrying off the king, the ambassador found it difficult to discover the truth ; but he was witness to a strange scene of violence and brawling before the council, in which Morton, Mar, and Lennox, gave the lie to their accu sers ; and the king, with much feeling and good sense, exerted himself to restore peace : a striking contrast, no doubt, to Bowes' experience of the decorous gravity and awe preserved by Elizabeth in her council, in which the highest nobles generally spoke upon their knees, and none but her majesty was permitted to lose temper. On the subject of the alleged plot of Lennox, James was at first reserved, although he expressed much love and admiration for Elizabeth ; but the ambassador at last gained his confidence, and drew from him many particulars, which showed that the conspiracy, intended to have been carried into effect at Doune castle, invol ved the ruin of Morton, the dismissal of Mar and other obnoxious councillors, and a complete reconstruction of the government under Lennox and Argyle.

He was the more persuaded of this, when Morton assured him that, since D'Aubigny's arrival, the king's feelings had undergone a great change in favour of that country. But the time called for action, not for speculation ; and on consulting with his friends, regarding the most likely means of averting the dangers threatened by this alarming state of things, there were many conflicting opinions. It was recommended to have tried council lors about the king, and a strong body-guard to prevent surprise ; as it had been remarked, that the late alarms and plots had all broken out when there was scarce a single councillor at court who could be depended upon. Yet this could not be done without money ; and where was money to be had in the present exhausted state of the royal revenue ? x Soon after this, the ambas sador took an opportunity of seeing the young king alone, and delivering a secret message from Elizabeth, upon a subject of the deepest interest to both : his suc cession to the English crown after her death. The particulars of the interview, and the answer given by James, were communicated in cipher, in a letter of which the address is now lost, but which was written probably to Burghley or Walsingham, his usual cor respondents when the subject was of high moment. \" In private with the king,\" so wrote the ambassador, \" I have offered to acquaint him with a secret greatly importing him and his estate, and lately discovered to me by letters, which were not out of the way in case he should desire sight thereof; and, taking his honour 2 MS. letter, British Museum, Caligula, C. vi. sol. 24 and 27, in clusive, and sol. 28 and 32, Bowes to Burghley and Walsingham, May 3, 1580.

The influence of Lennox and his friends became daily more predominant ; his youthful master's arguments on the errors of the church of Rome, seconded by the expositions of the Presbyterian clergy, had, as he affirmed, convinced him ; he had publicly avowed his conversion to Protestantism, and had signed the articles of religion drawn up by the Scottish clergy.

As he was sup ported by the favour of the king, and the countenance and money of France, he drew into his party the most powerful of the nobility. His possessions and landed property were already great. Favour after favour was bestowed. Himself, or his friends and retainers, held some of the strongest castles in Scotland ; and not long after this, Walsingham, who was anxiously watching his power, heard with dismay, from Bowes, that Dunbarton, one of the most important keys of the kingdom, was to be delivered to the favourite.2 This last determination incensed Elizabeth to the highest pitch. She had for some time been engaged in a secret correspondence with the captain of the castle, the noted Cunningham of Drumwhassel, who had promised to retain it at her devotion ; and on the first intimation that it was to be placed in the hands of Lennox, she ordered Sir Robert Bowes to ride post from Berwick into Scotland, with a fiery message, to be delivered to the Scottish council. The imperious and unscrupulous temper of the queen was strongly marked in his instructions. If he found the fortress (for so its great strength entitled it to be called) un delivered, he was to remonstrate loudly against its being surrendered to one who, whatever mask the pope 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, draft, Walsingham to Bowes, 31st August, 1580 ; and same to same, August 10, 1580.

If it was too late, and the castle already given up, he was instantly to confer with Morton how so fatal a step could be remedied : \" either,\" to quote the words of the instructions \" by laying violent hands on the duke and his principal associates, in case no other more temperate course can be found, or by some other way that by him might be thought meet.\" l Bowes hurried on to Edinburgh, met with Morton, whom he found still bold, and ready to engage in any attack upon his rival; and had already given him \" some comfort to prick him on \" \u2014 -meaning, no doubt, an advance in money, when new letters arrived from the queen. A single day had revived her parsimony, and cooled her resentment : it would be better, she thought, to try persuasion first, and forbear advising force, or any promise of assistance. None could answer for the consequences of a civil war : they might seize the young king, carry him to Dunbarton, and thence transport him to France.2 Bowes was directed, at the same time, to alarm James's fears, for a second time, on the subject of the succession ; to assure him, in great secrecy, that if he continued obstinately to prefer D'Aubigny's persua sions to the counsels of his mistress, his right would be cut off by an act of parliament, and the title to the English throne established in the person of another.3 This threat, however, had been so often repeated, that it produced not the slightest effect ; and Elizabeth soon after recalled her ambassador, commanding him, before he left the Scottish court, to upbraid the king 1 Orig. draft, State-paper Office, Walsingham to Bowes, August 30, 1580.

His farewell interview was a stormy one. His royal mistress, he said, was bitterly mortified to find that this was all the return for her care of James ever since his cradle. She had little expected to be treated with contempt, and to see promoted to credit and honour the very man against whom she had expressed so much suspicion and dislike ; but hereafter, he might find what it was to prefer a Duke of Lennox before a Queen of England. x This retirement of Bowes greatly strengthened D'Aubigny. The young king became more attached to the interests of France ; he entered into communi cation with his mother, the imprisoned queen ; 2 and whilst the courts of Rome, Paris, and Madrid, united their endeavours to procure her liberty, Lennox per suaded James to second their efforts, and to overwhelm their opponents by a mighty stroke. This was the destruction of Morton, the bitterest enemy of the Scottish queen, and whose recent intrigues with the English ambassador had shown that, although his power was diminished, his will to work their ruin was as active as before. Their plot against him, which had been in preparation for some time, was now ripe for execution, and it was determined to arraign him as guilty of the murder of Darnley. That he had been an active agent in the conspiracy against that unhappy prince, was certain ; and that Archibald Douglas, another powerful member of the house of Douglas, had been personally present at the murder, was well known ; but this could be said of others who had escaped pro secution ; and as to Morton, although shorn of much 1 Orig. draft, State-paper Office, Walsingham to Bowes, Oct. 7, 1580.

JAMES VI. 279 of his power and lustre, he was still so dreaded, that no one, for many years, had dared to whisper an accusation against him. The arrival of Lennox, how ever, had changed the scene ; and this new favourite of his sovereign was now risen to such a height of power, that, finding the late regent intriguing with Elizabeth against him, he determined to pull down and destroy his enemy at once. For this purpose many things then assisted. Mor- ton had quarrelled with the Kirk, and lost the confi- dence of its ministers ; he was hated by the people for his avarice and severe exactions during his regency ; and his steady adherence to England had made him odious to the friends of the imprisoned queen and the party of France. Lennox, therefore, had every hope of success ; and to effect his purpose, he employed a man well calculated to cope with such an antagonist. This was James Stewart, captain of the Royal Guard, and second son of Lord Ochiltree, who had already risen into great favour with the king, and was after- wards destined to act a noted part in the history of the country. Stewart had received a learned education ; and from the principles of his father, and his near con- nexion with Knox, who had married his sister, was probably destined for the church. But his daring and ambitious character threw him into active life : he embraced the profession of arms, served as a soldier of fortune in the wars of France and Sweden, visited Russia, and afterwards returned to his own country, where he soon won the confidence of the young king and the Duke of Lennox, by his noble presence and elegant accomplishments. Beneath these lighter at tractions, however, he concealed a mind utterly reckless and licentious in its principles, confident and courageous to excess, intolerant of the opinions of other men, and"], [286, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1580-1. 280 unscrupulous as to the means he adopted to raise him self into power. To this man, then only beginning to develop these qualities, was committed the bold task of arraigning Morton ; and to obtain complete proof of his guilt, it was arranged that Sir James Balfour, who was believed to have in his possession the bond for Darnley's murder, and who was himself a principal assassin, should come secretly from France and exhibit this paper with Morton's signature attached to it. In this last scene of his life, the ex-regent exhibited the hereditary pride and courage of the house of Dou glas. He had been warned of the danger he incurred, and the storm which was about to burst over his head, two days before, when hunting with the king : but he derided it ; and on the last of December, the day on which he fell into the toils, took his place, as usual, at the council table, where the king presided. After some unimportant business, the usher suddenly entered and declared that Captain James Stewart was at the door, and earnestly craved an audience. The request was immediately granted ; and Stewart, advancing to the table, fell on his knees, and instantly accused Morton of the king's murder. \" My duty to your highness,\" said he, addressing the king, \" has brought me here to reveal a wickedness that has been too long obscured. It was that man, (pointing to the earl,) now sitting at this table, a place he is unworthy to occupy, that conspired your royal father's death. Let him be committed for trial, and I shall make good my words.\" 1 Amidst the amazement and confusion occasioned by this sudden and bold impeachment, the only person 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Walsingham and Burgh ley, January 1, 1580-1."], [287, "1580-1.

Rising from his seat, he cast a momentary and disdainful glance upon his accuser, and then firmly regarding the king, \" I know not,\" he said, \" by whom this informer has been set on, and it were easy for one of my rank to refuse all reply to so mean a person ; but I stand upon my innocence, I fear no trial. The rigour with which I have prose cuted all suspected of that murder is well known ; and when I have cleared myself, it will be for your majesty to determine what they deserve who have sent this perjured tool of theirs to accuse me!\" These bitter terms Stewart threw back upon the earl with equal contempt and acrimony. \" It is false, utterly false,\" he replied, \" that any one has instigated me to make this accusation. A horror for the crime, and zeal for the safety of my sovereign, have been my only counsel lors ; and as to his pretended zeal against the guilty7, let me ask him, where has he placed Archibald Dou glas his cousin ? That most infamous of men, who was an actor in the tragedy, is now a senator, promoted to the highest seat of justice, and suffered to pollute that tribunal before which he ought to have been arraigned as the murderer of his prince.\" 1 This scene had begun calmly ; but as these last words were uttered, Stewart had sprung upon his feet, and Morton laid his hand upon his sword, when Lords Lindsay and Cathcart threw themselves between them, and prevented a personal encounter.2 The king then commanded both to be removed ; and, after a brief consultation, the justice-clerk, who sat at the council table, having declared that, on a charge of treason, the accused must instantly be warded, 1 Spottiswood, p. 310. 2 Harleian, 6999, sols. 3, 4, 5.

Even there, however, he was not deemed secure from a rescue; and his enemies were not contented till they had lodged him within the strong fortress of Dunbarton, of which Lennox, his great enemy, was governor.1 On the same day that the ex-regent was committed, the council ordered his cousin, Archibald Douglas, to be seized ; and Hume of Manderston, with a party of horse, rode furiously all night to his castle of Morham : but Douglas had escaped, a few hours before, across the English border, having received warning from his friend the Laird of Lang-Niddry, who rode two horses to death in bringing him the news.2 Lennox and his faction, however, had made sure of their principal victim ; and all was now headlong haste to hurry on his trial, and have the tragedy completed, before any interruption could be made, or any succour arrive. Yet this was not easily accomplished. The story of his seizure had effectually roused Elizabeth. Ran dolph was despatched, on the spur of the moment, to carry a violent remonstrance to the king ; and Lord Hunsdon, her cousin, a proud and fiery soldier, re ceived orders to raise the power of the north, and lead an army into Scotland.3 But the envoy, on his arrival at Edinburgh,4 found it more difficult to revive a party for the delivery of Morton than he had anticipated.

The Earl of Angus, indeed, Morton's nearest kinsman, was ready to peril all in the effort to save him ; but he stood alone. The rest of the nobles were either banded with Lennox, or held themselves aloof, till Hunsdon's soldiers should be seen crossing, and not threatening to cross the border, and till Randolph had begun to pay them in better coin than promises. They had been so often deceived by the artful diplo macy of the English queen \u2014 she had already so fre quently incited them to take arms, under a promise of assistance, and left them when it was too late to retreat \u2014 that they were full of distrust and suspicion. Nor was the audience with the young king in any way more encouraging. James had been irritated on Randolph's first arrival, by his refusal to have any intercourse with his favourite Lennox ;2 and when the envoy attempted to justify himself, and offered to prove, by the production of an intercepted letter, that he was an agent of Rome and the house of Guise, and carried on a secret intelligence with the enemies of both kingdoms, the monarch answered with much spirit, that Lennox was an honourable nobleman, his own near kinsman, and that the accusation was per fectly false.

The whole force of the realm was summoned to be in readiness to resist the English army. - Bands of \" waged soldiers \" (so termed to distinguish them from the feudal militia of the country, who served without pay) were enlisted, and added to the ordinary guard about the king's person ; and the three estates assembled to vote supplies for the exigencies of the expected war with England. Before this parliament Randolph appeared and made his last great effort to bring about the deliverance of Morton, and overthrow the power of Lennox, by open negotiation and remonstrance. He spoke for two hours : insisted with much earnestness on the benefits to be derived from the friendship of his royal mistress ; described, in glowing terms, the dangers to be appre hended from Lennox, whom he denounced as an agent of France and Rome ; and produced an intercepted letter from the Bishop of Ross, to prove his allega tions. All these exertions, however, came too late, and were utterly unsuccessful. Lennox denied the charge, and demanded the fullest investigation. The parliament promised forty thousand pounds to sup port the preparations against England ; daily rumours of war, and whisperings of the intrigues and conspira cies which were fomented by the English diplomatist, agitated and inflamed the country ; and at last, as Randolph himself described it, \" Every day bred a new disorder ; men began to be stirring in all parts ; the ambassador grew odious, his death suspected, and the court in a manner desperate.\"1 These suspicions of conspiracies were not without foundation ; for, from the moment of his arrival, 1 MS. State-paper Office, Mr Randolph's Negotiation in Scotland."], [293, "1580-1. JAMES VI. 287 Randolph had kept in his eye the third article in his instructions, which was, to raise a faction against Lennox, and employ force, either in seizing his person, or putting him to death in some open attack, if more conciliatory measures failed.1 It was hoped that in this way the party in the interest of England might secure the person of the young king, and remove from him those obnoxious ministers who persuaded him to throw himself into the arms of France, and to seek the liberty of the imprisoned queen. The great ad vocates for this plan were Sir Robert Bowes, Lord Hunsdon, Lord Huntingdon, and the Earl of Angus ; but they differed somewhat as to the best mode of proceeding. Bowes seemed to have the least scruples as to employing force, for the separating James from his favourite. In a letter to Walsingham or Burgh ley,2 written shortly after Randolph's arrival, he informed his correspondent, that the Scottish nobles were drawing to an association ; and that, amid the pageants with which the king and Lennox were then recreating the court, \"a strange masque might be, perhaps, seen at Holyrood,\" which would check the triumph of the favourite. Hunsdon, whose fiery tem per on no occasion brooked much delay, recommended martial measures ; and assured the English secretary, that Lennox must look for his dismissal to France, or to \" something worse.\"3 Huntingdon, a nobleman of the highest honour in these dark times, assured Randolph, that any attempt to restore English ascen dency by negotiation would be fruitless ; that open war must be deprecated ; and that to get out of their 1 MS.

The conspirators, thus encouraged, completed their arrangements. They succeeded in corrupting some of the royal household ; by their connivance, forged keys for the king's private apartments were made ; and they thus hoped to enter the palace, seize the young monarch, put Lennox, Argyle, and Montrose, to death, and send James to England.2 But Lennox, when on the very point of being cut off, was saved by an unexpected discovery ; and Morton, when his prison began to be cheered by the near prospect of escape, found himself more hopelessly situated than before. The chief actors in the association for his rescue were the Earls of Angus and Mar. With Angus, Randolph had arranged all in nightly meetings, held sometimes in the fields, sometimes at Dalkeith. The Laird of Whittingham, a Douglas, and brother to the noted Archibald Douglas, was a principal con spirator, and intrusted with their most secret inten tions ; and four confidential servants of Morton, named Fleck, or Affleck, Nesbit, Reid, and Jerdan, were prin cipal agents in the plot, and knew all its ramifications.

Morton's servants, Fleck, Nesbit, Reid, and Jerdan, were instantly arrested and put to the torture. Angus was banished beyond the Spey ; Randolph, whose intrigues were laid bare, fled precipitately to Berwick, after having been nearly slain by a shot fired into his study ; l and Elizabeth, disgusted by the treachery of Whittingham, and the utter failure of the plot against Lennox, commanded Hunsdon to dismiss his forces, recalled Randolph, and abandoned Morton to his fate.2 This, it was now evident, could not be long averted. His enemies were powerful and clamorous against him. Captain James Stewart, the accuser of the ex- regent, had openly declared, if they by whom he had been urged to this daring enterprise did not make an end of the old tyrant, he would soon make an end of them.3 The confession of Whittingham, and of Morton's con fidential servants, had furnished his enemies with evidence sufficient to bring him to the scaffold ; 4 and although Angus, Randolph, and Hunsdon still con tinued their plots, it was found impossible to carry them into execution.

For this purpose Stewart, his accuser, and Mon trose, were commissioned to bring him from Dunbarton to the capital. In those dark days many prophetic warnings hung over ancient houses ; and among the rest was one which predicted that the bloody heart, the emblem of the house of Douglas, would fall by Arran. This saying Morton affected to despise ; for the Earl of Arran was dead, and the Hamiltons, his enemies, in whose family this title was hereditary, were now banished and broken men. But Stewart, his implacable foe, had recently procured from the king the gift of the vacant earldom, though the news of his promotion had never reached the captive in his prison at Dunbarton. When Morton, therefore, read the name of Arran in the commission, he started, ex claiming, \" Arran ! who is that ? the Earl of Arran is dead.\" \u2014 \" Not so,\" said the attendant ; \" that title is now held by Captain James Stewart.\" \u2014 \" And is it so?\" said he, the prediction flashing across his memory : \" then, indeed, all is over ; and I know what I must look for.\"2 Yet, although hopeless as to the result, nothing could be more calm or undaunted than the temper in which he met it. During his long imprisonment, he had expressed contrition for his sinful courses ; de plored the many crimes into which ambition and the insatiable love of power had plunged him ; and sought for rest in the consolations of religion, and the con- 1 MS.

At the same time, his preparations for the worst had not prevented him from taking as active a part against his enemies as his captivity would allow. He was brought to trial on the 1st of June, five months after his arrest ; and such was still either the lingering dread of his power, or the terror of some attempt at rescue, that the whole town was in arms. Two companies of soldiers were placed at the Cross, two bands above the Tolbooth ; whilst the citizens, armed also, and with another body of troops, filled the principal street, for the purpose of conducting him from his lodging to the Tolbooth, where the trial took place. His indictment contained twelve heads of accusation, or \" dittays but the paper has not been preserved ; and this is the less material, as the pro ceedings had scarcely begun, when a letter from the king was presented, commanding the jury to confine their attention solely to the most important charge, his accession to the murder of the late king, his father. On this point, absolute and direct proof might not have been easily procured ; for it turned out that Sir James Balfour either did not possess, or would not produce, the bond for Darnley's murder. But Morton's own defence supplied this defect ; for although he denied that he had ever procured, or given his consent to the death of Darnley, he dis tinctly admitted that he knew the murder was to be committed, and had concealed it ; upon which confes sion the jury found him guilty. The terms in which their sentence was embodied were the same as those still employed in Scotland. It declared him \"convicted of counsel, concealing, and being art and part of the king's murder ;\" upon hearing which last words read aloud, the earl, who"], [299, "1581. JAMES VI. 293 had maintained the greatest calmness and temper during the trial, became deeply agitated. \" Art and part!\" said he, with great vehemence, and striking the table repeatedly with a little baton or staff which he usually carried \u2014 \"art and part! God knoweth the contrary.\" It is evident that he drew the dis tinction between an active contrivance and approval, and a passive knowledge and concealment of the plot for Darnley's assassination. On the morning of the day on which he suffered, some of the leading ministers of the Kirk, with wThom he had been much at variance on the subject of Epis copacy, breakfasted with him in the prison ; and a long and interesting conference took place, of which the particulars have been preserved in a narrative drawn up by those who were present.1 It is difficult for any one who reads this account, and who is acquainted with the dark and horrid crimes which stained the life of Morton, not to be painfully struck with the disproportion between his expressions of contrition, and his certain anticipations of immediate glory and felicity.

Yet all may have been, nay, let us hope all was, sincere ; and 1 Bannatyne's Memorials, Bannatyne Club edition, p. 317."], [300, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1581. 294 whilst it is vain to speculate upon a state of mind known only to Him who sees the heart, allowance must be made for the character of an age familiar with blood ; for the peculiar, and almost ultra-Calvinistic, theology of the divines who ministered to him in his last moments ; and the possibility of inaccuracy in the narrative itself, which was not read over to him before his death. In speaking of the assassination of the king, he distinctly repeated his admissions made at the trial ; affirming that he, in common with many others, knew that Darnley was to be cut off, but did not dare to forewarn him ; and adding, that the queen was the contriver of the whole plot. These conferences took place on the day in which he suffered ; and his friends amongst the clergy had scarcely left him, when his keeper entered his room, and desired him to come forth to the scaffold. He appeared surprised, and observed, that, having been so much troubled that day with worldly matters, he had hoped that one night at least would have been allowed him to have advised ripely writh his God. \" But, my lord,\" said the keeper, \" they will not wait, and all things are ready.\" \u2014 \" If it be so,\" answered he, \" I praise God I am ready also ;\" and after a short prayer, he passed down to the gate of the palace to go to the scaffold. Here another interruption took place ; for Arran, his mortal enemy, was waiting on the steps, and requested him to tarry till his confession, which had been made to the ministers, had been written down, and brought to him for his signature. But this reim mersion into worldly affairs he entreated to be spared. \" Bethink you, my lord,\" said he, \" that I have far other things now to advise upon. I am about to die ; I must prepare for my God. Ask me not to write now ; all these good men (pointing to the ministers)"], [301, "1581. JAMES VI. 295 can testify what I have spoken in that matter.\" With this Arran professed himself satisfied : but his importunity was not at an end ; for he added, that Morton must be reconciled to him before he proceeded farther. To this the earl willingly agreed ; observing, that now was no time to reckon quarrels, and that he forgave him and all, as he himself hoped for forgive ness. He then proceeded to the scaffold, which he ascended with a firm step ; and turning to the people repeated, shortly, his confession of the foreknowledge of the king's murder, only suppressing the name of his near relative, Mr Archibald Douglas. He declared that he died in the profession of the gospel as it was at that day taught and established in Scotland ; and exhorted the people, if they hoped for the favour of Heaven, to hold fast the same. Mr James Lawson, one of the ministers, then prayed aloud ; and during this act of devotion, Morton, who had thrown himself, with his face on the ground, before the block on which he was to suffer, was observed to be deeply affected. In his agitation, his whole frame was convulsed with sighs and sobs bursting from his bosom ; and his body rebounded from the earth on which he lay along. On rising up, however, his face was calm and cheerful ; he shook his friends by the hand, bidding them fare well with many expressions of kindness ; and having declined to have his hands bound, knelt down and laid his neck upon the block. At this awful moment, Mr James Lawson, stooping forward to his ear, read some verses from the Scripture, which Morton re peated with a firm voice. As he pronounced the words, \"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!\" the axe descended, and the imperfect sentence died upon the lips, which quivered and were silent for ever.1 The 1 MS.

It was remarked that Fernyhirst, who was known to have been acquainted with the murder of the king, stood in a window opposite the scaffold. He was recognised by a con spicuous feature in his dress \u2014 his large ruffles ; and seemed to take delight in the spectacle. The people also remarked that Lord Seton and his two sons had taken great care to secure a good view of all that passed, by pulling down a stair which would have intercepted their view of the scaffold.1 On the day after Morton suffered, George Binning, a servant of Archibald Douglas, was executed for his participation in the murder of the king. The confes sion of this accomplice threw some additional light on this dark story. He affirmed, that his master, Archi bald Douglas, who was then an adherent of the Earl of Bothwell, was present at the deed, and, in his haste to leave the spot, lost one of his slippers ; that, when his master came home, his clothes were full of clay and soil, occasioned, no doubt, by the explosion ; and that, in retreating from the scene of the murder, he (Binning) encountered, at the foot of a narrow lane near the spot, certain \" musselled men,\" meaning men who had disguised themselves by muffling their faces in their cloaks ; one of whom, as he conjectured by his voice, was a brother of Sir James Balfour.2 The death of Morton was followed, as was to be expected, by the concentration of the whole power of the state in the hands of the Earl of Lennox and Morton's head was fixed on the Tolbooth, on the highest stone of the gable towards the public street.

This neces sarily led to the revival of the influence of France, and^to renewed intrigues by the friends of the Catholic faith and the supporters of the imprisoned queen. The prospects of the Protestant lords, and of the more zealous ministers of the Kirk, were proportion ably overclouded ; the faction in the interest of Eng land was thrown into despair, and reports of the most gloomy kind began to circulate through the country. It was said that religion was on the point of being altered ; that the king would marry a priucess of the house of Lorraine ; that the Duke of Guise had already written to him in the most friendly terms, and now for the first time had condescended to call him king.1 The conduct of Lennox was calculated to confirm rather than mitigate these suspicions. He professed, indeed, an earnest desire to maintain amicable rela tions with England ; and had written to this effect to the Earl of Leicester, warning him against Archibald Douglas, who was now in England, and laboured to embroil the two kingdoms.2 But he had forgotten entirely his friendly professions to the Presbyterians. The ministers of the Kirk, who had congratulated themselves as the instruments of his conversion, were treated wdth coldness ; and it was soon discovered that he had warmly espoused the king's opinions with regard to Episcopacy, and was ready to second, to his utmost ability, the efforts of the monarch for its com plete establishment in his dominions.

Soon after the execution of Morton, he appeared before the privy council, entered into a detail of his proceedings against that nobleman, lamented the necessity he had been under of employ ing torture to procure evidence, and demanded and obtained an act of approval from the king, \"which characterized his whole conduct as honourable, and assured him, that at no future period should it be called in question.1 His next step was an act of such open profligacy, as to incense and scandalize the whole country. He lived in habits of familiar friend ship with the Earl of March, and had been under deep obligations to him ; but he employed the oppor tunities such intimacy gave him to seduce the affec tions of the Countess of March, a woman of great beauty; and so completely succeeded in depraving her mind, that she brought an action of divorce against her husband, on a ground which, in this day, none but the most abandoned could plead. The suit was successful, the decree of divorce pronounced, and Arran married the countess, whose situation at that moment proclaimed her either a liar or an adulteress. It affords a shocking picture of the manners of the times, that the young king appears to have counte nanced this proceeding. Nor was this all. James determined to grant new honours to those who had assisted him in the overthrow of Morton : Lennox was made a duke ;2 Captain Stewart, who had already received a gift of the earldom of Arran, was invested in that dignity with great solemnity; the Earl of March received the earldom of Orkney ; Lord Ruthven that 1 Original Record of Privy-council, in the Register-house, Edinburgh, June 3, 1581. 2 Douglas, vol. ii. p. 99.

Parliament now assembled, and the sanction of this supreme court was given to all those measures lately passed in favour of Lennox and Arran. Indeed, it could scarcely be expected that any would dare to oppose them ; for James had sent intimation to the Earls of Mar, Eglinton, and Glencairn, with the Lords Lindsay, Boyd, Herries, and Ochiltree, that he would dispense with their presence on this occasion;1 and none, probably, attended but those who were favourable to the court. The adherents of the late Earl of Morton were pronounced rebels, and their estates confiscated. Amongst these, the principal were the Earl of Angus, Archibald Douglas of Whit tingham, James Douglas prior of Pluscardine, and James Douglas of Pittendreich, two natural sons of the Regent Morton ; Douglas of Parkhead, and Archibald Douglas constable of the castle of Edin burgh. In the same parliament, Lennox, who be lieved his influence now to be all-powerful, exerted himself to procure the pardon of Sir James Balfour, who had recently done him good service in the over throw of Morton. But he was disappointed ; for James refused his request, and pointed to those acts of parliament by which it was declared, that no per son guilty of the king his father's murder, should ever be restored.2 At the same meeting of the estates, the statutes were confirmed which protected the re formed religion ; some enactments were introduced for the regulation of the coinage, against the expor- 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Burghley, October 18, 1581. 2 MS.

It is now necessary to turn for a moment to the Scottish queen in her imprisonment. It was a miser able circumstance in the fate of this unfortunate princess, that any successes of her friends generally brought along with them an increase of rigour and jealousy upon the part of her inexorable rival. This increase, on the other hand, as surely led to more determined efforts for her delivery ; and thus, during the thirteen years for which she had now continued a captive, her health had been shattered, and her spirits broken, by those alternations of hope and fear, \u2014 those fluctuations of ardent expectation, or bitter disap pointment, which must have destroyed even the healthiest and most buoyant constitution. Her con dition about this time was so feeble, that she had lost the use of her limbs, and was carried in a chair, or litter, by her servants. She besought Elizabeth, in pathetic terms, for the favour of a coach, that she might enjoy a drive in the park of Sheffield castle, where she was confined ; she requested the additional attendance of two female servants and two men servants, which her sickness demanded ; and she entreated to have passports for the Lady Lethington and Lord Seton, in whose society she might find some alleviation of her solitude. But, although Castelnau, the French ambassador, seconded these requests by the most earnest remonstrance, the English queen was deaf to his entreaties, and resisted the application.1 1 Addition aux Mem. de Castelnau, p. 519. Chalmers' Life of Mary, vol. i. pp. 384, 388."], [307, "1581. JAMES VI. 301 This cold and unrelenting conduct could not fail to make a deep impression upon Mary ; and, in a moment of resentment and excitation, she had determined to resign her rights as Queen of Scots, and her claims upon the crown of England, into the hands of her son, with an earnest hope, that he would invade that realm, and, assisted by the Roman Catholic party abroad, and Elizabeth's discontented subjects at home, establish his rights, and overwhelm her op pressor. But the return of calmer consideration showed the madness of such a scheme ; and her anxiety for the amicable recognition of the rights of her son to the English crown, banished the suggestions of personal resentment. In a memorial presented by Mary about this time to Elizabeth and her parliament, she requested to be heard, by deputies whom she would appoint, upon the subject of her title and pre tensions.1 It was not, she added, on her own account that she sugoested this. Continued affliction had brought on a premature age ; sorrow had extinguished ambition ; and, with her shattered frame, it would be ridiculous to expect to survive Elizabeth. But she felt the natural anxiety of a mother to secure the rights of her child : aud she entreated her sister of Eugland to agree to her petition, and to recognise the undoubted title of her son, as the most certain means of promoting settled peace, and securing their mutual security. This, sensible memorial experienced the same fate as her former petition : it made no impression upon the Queen of England, or her ministers ; and Mary, defeated in her moderate desires, was compelled to embrace more determined measures, and to throw 1 Murdin, p. 367."], [308, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1581 302 herself entirely into the arms of France. This led to a new project, known by the name of \" The Associa tion,\" and which appears to have originated about this time. It was proposed to the young king, that in order to have his title to the Scottish throne recognised by the powers of Europe, none of whom, with the exception of England, had yet publicly given him the name of king, he should resign the crown to his mother, under the condition that she should re transmit it to him, and retire from all the active duties of the government. But before pursuing this scheme, which led ultimately to important conse quences, it is necessary to attend to the state of the church, and its violent collision with the crown. The struggle between Episcopacy7, which had been originally established at the time of the Reformation, and the Presbyterian form of church government, was now assuming every day a more determined and obstinate form. The young king, with his ministers, and favourites, Lennox and Arran, and a large pro portion of the nobility, supported Episcopacy. The ministers of the Kirk, and the great body of the burghers, and middle and lower classes of the people, were zealously attached to the Presbyterian model ; and considered the office of a bishop as anti-scriptural, and a remnant of popery. In a General Assembly, held some time previous to this, the \" Platform \" of ecclesiastical government, drawn up by Andrew Melvil, had been ratified by a majority of the ministers, and received the solemn sanction of the church, under the title of \"The Second Book of Discipline.\"1 Under these conflicting circumstances, the Duke of Lennox, whose influence with the young king gave him an 1 Calderwood's History, pp. 97, 102, convened April 20, 1581.

It was notorious to all, that this was a collusive and simoniacal transaction ; for Montgomery resigned the temporalities of the see to the duke, and was contented to receive a small annual stipend out of its revenues. But the clergy, at first waving this objection, pronounced a high censure upon Montgomery, and interdicted him from accepting a bishoprick. He remonstrated, and was supported by the king and his council, who contended, that as Episcopacy had never been abolished by the three estates, no illegal act had been committed. The General Assembly of the church soon after was convened in the capital ; and as some private in telligence had been sent to Scotland of the intended \" Association \" between the imprisoned queen and the king her son, this ecclesiastical convention met in a state of much excitement.1 It was known that various missionary priests were covertly intriguing in the country ; that George Douglas had arrived on a mission from France, charged with secret despatches from the Bishops of Glasgow and Ross, her agents in that realm ; and great dread was entertained of Len nox's increasing influence over the mind of the young king. Determined measures, therefore, were adopted by the church. Articles against Montgomery were drawn up, which condemned, in strong terms, his life, conversation, and opinions ; and although, upon in vestigation, many faults objected to him turned out to be frivolous and unfounded, other matters were proved, which, it was contended, utterly incapacita ted him for the office which he had accepted. He 1 Calderwood, p. 118."], [310, "304 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1581. received an injunction, therefore, to continue in his ministry at Stirling; and, under pain of the highest censures, to abandon all thoughts of the bishoprick. During these transactions, Elizabeth, who had be come alarmed on the subject of Scotland, and dreaded the preponderating influence of Lennox and Arran, despatched Captain Nicolas Arrington, an able officer of the garrison at Berwick, on a mission into that country. He was instructed to use his utmost efforts to persuade the king to continue in amicable relations with England ; to sow, if possible, by some secret practice, a division between the Duke of Lennox and the Earl of Arran ; and to expose the devices of France and Spain for the overthrow of religion, and the resumption of power by the Scottish queen.1 It had beeii the advice of Sir Robert Bowes, in a letter addressed to Burghley, that every means should be adopted to increase some jealousies, which, owing to the pride and intolerance of Arran, had arisen between him and the duke. But after every effort to \" blow the coals,\" 2 as he expressed it, these proud rivals became convinced that their safest policy was to forget their differences, and unite against their common enemies. A reconcilement, accordingly, took place;3 and Len nox, strong in the continued attachment of the king, and the new friendship of Arran, determined to con centrate his whole strength against that faction of the Kirk which opposed themselves to Episcopacy, and had threatened his bishop with deposition. At this moment secret information of a threatening nature arrived from France. The reports regarding 1 State-paper Office, October 26, 1581, Instructions for N. Arring ton, sent into Scotland.

JAMES VI. 305 the progress of \" The Association\" between the queen mother and her son were confirmed. It was said, that Lord Arbroath, the head of the great house of Hamilton, now in banishment, was to be restored by French influence, under the condition, that the \" mass\" should return along with him ; and Mr John Durie, one of the ministers of Edinburgh, sounded a fearful note of alarm, in a sermon which he delivered in the High Church of the city. The king, he said, had been moved by certain courtiers, who now ruled all at their will, to send a private message to the King of France and the Duke of Guise, and to seek his mother's blessing. He knew this, he declared, from the very man who was employed in the message \u2014 George Douglas, Mary's sworn servant ; and he painted in strong colours the deplorable effects which might be anticipated from such a coalition. It was proposed, in these dark counsels, that the king should resign the crown to his mother, and she convey it again to him, with an assurance that he should then be acknowledged as king by France, and by the powers of Europe, which, up to this time, had refused him the royal title. And what must inevitably follow from all this? If the transaction were completed, it would be argued, that the establishment of religion, and all other public transactions since the coronation, were null ; that the king's friends were traitors, and their adversaries his only true subjects. After the sermon, a remarkable conference took place between the Earls of Argyle and Gowrie, and the ministers, Durie, Lawson, and Davison, in the council-house. On being pressed as to the French intrigues, Argyle confessed that he had gone too far ; but affirmed, that if he saw any thing intended against religion, he would forsake his friends, and oppose it to his utmost. vol. vi. u"], [312, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1581. 306 To Gowrie, Davison the minister of Libberton, in alluding to the murder of Riccio, used a still stronger argument : \" If things,\" said he, \" go forward as they are intended, your head, my lord, will pay for Davie's slaughter. But Scottish nobles now are utterly un worthy of the place they hold : they would not, in other times, have suffered the king to lie alone at Dalkeith with a stranger, whilst the whole realm is going to confusion ; and yet the matter,\" they signifi cantly added, \" might be reformed well enough with quietness, if the noblemen wrould do their duty.\" 1 Nor were these warnings and denunciations confined to the nobility. The young king, when sitting in his private chamber in the palace of Stirling, received an admonition quite as solemn as any delivered to his subjects. Mr John Davison, along with Duncanson the royal chaplain, and Mr Peter Young, entered the apartment ; and Davison, after pointing out the dread ful state of the country, exhorted him to put away those evil counsellors who were so fast bringing ruin upon the commonweal and his own soul. \" My liege,\" said he, \" at this present, there are three jewels in this realm precious to all good men \u2014 Religion, the Commonweal, and your Grace's person. Into what a horrible confusion the two first have fallen, all men are witness; but as to the third, your grace hath need to beware, not only of the common hypocrites and flatterers, but more especially of two sorts of men First, such as opposed themselves to your grace in your minority : whereby they have committed offences for which they must yet answer to the laws; and, therefore, must needs fear the king. Remember the saying, ' Midtis terribilis, caveto midtos.' The second 1 MS. Calderwood, Ayscough, 4736, sol. 1172."], [313, "1582. JAMES VI. 307 sort are those who are conjured enemies to religion. If,\" he concluded, \" your grace would call to you such godly men as I could name, they would soon show you whom they think to be included in these two ranks.\" It had been arranged beforehand, that should the young king exhibit any desire to profit by this counsel, Davison was to name the Lairds of Dun, Lundie, and Braid, with Mr Robert Pont and Mr James Lawson, two of the leading ministers ; but James, after hearing the exordium, and observing hurriedly that it was good counsel, started off from the subject, and broke up the interview.1 These scenes of alarm and admonition were followed by a violent attempt of Montgomery to possess him self of the bishoprick, in which he entered the church at Glasgow, accompanied by a band of the royal guard, and in virtue of a charge addressed by the king to that presbytery^, endeavoured to expel the established minister from the pulpit, and to occupy his place. This was resisted by the Kirk ; and the ministers of the presbytery of Glasgow were in consequence sum moned before the council;2 but they defended them selves with the greatest courage, and, when pressed by the king, declined the judgment of the sovereign or his judges in a matter not of a civil but of a purely spiritual nature. Lawson, Durie, Andrew Hay, and a large body of the ministers and elders from Edin burgh, Dalkeith, and Linlithgow, accompanied them to Stirling ; and when the king insisted that they should receive Montgomery, and warned them of the fatal consequences of a refusal, he was boldly reminded by Durie, that such intemperate proceedings would only lead to the excommunication of the man whom he 1 MS. Calderwood, British Museum, sol. 1172. 2 April 13, 1582."], [314, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1582. 308 favoured.1 This threat, and the preparations for carrying it into immediate execution, alarmed the object of the quarrel himself; and the submission of Montgomery to the jurisdiction and sentence of the Kirk, led to a temporary cessation of the controversy. This lull, however, proved exceeding brief, and was soon followed by a more determined collision between the antagonist principles of Presbyterianism and Epis copacy. The Kirk at this time possessed, amongst its ministers, some men of distinguished learning, and of the greatest courage : Durie, Lawson, Craig, Lindsay, Andrew Melvil, Thomas Smeton, Pont, Davison, and many others, presided over its councils, and formed a spiritual conclave which, in the infallibility\" they claimed, and the obedience they demanded, was a hierarchy in every thing but the name. Eloquent, intrepid, and indefatigable, they had gained the affec tions of the lower classes of the people, and were supported also by the increasing influence of the burghs and the commercial classes. Animated by such feelings, wielding such powers, and backed by such an influence, it was not to be expected that they would be easily put down. The great cause of Episco pacy, on the other hand, was supported by the young king, who was himself no contemptible theologian, by the Duke of Lennox, the Earl of Arran, and a laroe portion of the old nobility. Abroad, it looked to the sympathy and assistance of France ; and as the whole hopes of the imprisoned queen, and the great body of the Roman Catholics in England, rested on Lennox and his friends, they were inclined to strengthen his 1 Calderwood MS. sol. 1174. Montgomery, incensed against Andrew Hay, one of the ministers, threatened to bring him to justice, as art and part in foreknowing and concealing the late king's murder. The only ground of the charge was, that Mr Andrew Hay was uncle to the Laird of Tallo, (Hay,) who was executed for the murder."], [315, "1582. JAMES VI. 309 hands in every possible way. The power of this party had recently been shown by the destruction of Morton, which they carried through with a high hand, against the whole influence of England and the Kirk ; and, flushed by this success, they resolved to renew the battle with the Presbyterian party, in the case of the Bishop of Glasgow, which, however insulated or insignificant it might appear at first sight, really involved the establishment or destruction of Episco- pacy. Montgomery, a weak man, and wholly under the influence of Lennox, was easily persuaded to re- tract his submission, and repeat his attempts to possess himself of the bishoprick ; whilst at this moment the feelings of the ministers were goaded to the highest pitcli of jealousy and resentment, by the arrival of a messenger from the Duke of Guise: ostensibly, he came with a present of horses to the king ; but it was suspected that more was intended than mere courtesy. The person who brought this gift was Signor Paul, the duke's master stabler, and, as was asserted, one of the most active and remorseless murderers at the massacre of St Bartholomew.1 It was scarcely to be expected that this should be tamely borne ; and John Durie, the minister of Edinburgh, instantly rode to Kinneil, Arran's castle, where the king had deter- mined to receive Guise's envoy. Meeting Signor Paul in the garden, the minister hastily drew his cap over his eyes, declaring he would not pollute them by looking on the devil's ambassador ; and turning to the king, rebuked him sharply for receiving gifts from so odious a quarter. \" Is it with the Guise,\" said he, \" that your grace will interchange presents ; with that 1 MS.

Listen not, then, to those ambassadors of the devil, who are sent hither to allure you from your religion.\" J To this indignant sally, James, overawTed by the vehement tone of the remonstrant, quietly an swered, \" that his body was pure ; and that he would have no woman for his wife who did not fear God and love the Evangell.\" 2 From Kinneil, Durie returned to Edinburgh, where his zeal flamed up to the highest pitch ; and, trans forming the pulpit, as was the practice of those times, into a political rostrum for the discussion of the mea sures of the government, he exposed the intrigues of Lennox, the schemes of the queen-mother, and the profligacy of the court, in such cutting and indignant terms, that he was immediately summoned before the council, and ordered to quit the city.3 The strictest injunctions, at the same time, were directed to the provost and magistrates to carry this sentence of banishment into execution under pain of treason.4 Lennox's party, at this moment, was described by the Laird of Carmichael, (a Scottish gentleman em ployed to transmit secret information to Walsingham,) as guiding all at court.

These, he added, were all papists.1 But Carmichael himself, probably a rigid Presbyterian, was little disposed to make any distinction between those who supported Episcopacy, and the friends of the church of Rome. Yet it must be remembered, that the reported in trigues between the court of Spain and the duke, with the secret negotiations of the Jesuits for the associa tion of the queen-mother with her son in the govern ment, gave him no little countenance in the assertion ; and the vigour with which Lennox pushed forward his measures against the Kirk, seemed to indicate a very formidable combination of forces. Undismayed, however, by the attack of their adversaries, the party of the Kirk only roused themselves to a more de termined opposition, retaliated, by excommunicating Montgomery, and called upon the people to weep for their sins, and be prepared to peril all, rather than part with their religion. The country, at this moment, must have presented an extraordinary picture : the pulpits rang with alternate strains of lamentation and defiance. Patrick Simpson, alluding to the fate of Durie, declared, that the principal link in the golden chain of the ministry was already broken.

Against Christ himself : from whose divine head these daring and wicked men would fain pluck the crown, and from whose hands they would wrench the sceptre.\" These might be deemed strong expressions, he added, but did not every day verify his words, and give new ground for alarm ? \" Need he point out to them the king's in tended demission of the crown to his mother ? Was not the palpable object of this scheme, which had been concocting these eight years past, the resumption of her lost power, and with it the re-establishment of her idolatrous worship ? Who were its authors ? Beaton bishop of Glasgow, and Lesley bishop of Ross. And by what devices did this last-named prelate ex plain their intentions to the imprisoned princess ? To the letters which he sent, he had added a painting of a queen, with a little boy kneeling at her feet and im ploring her blessing ; whilst she extended one hand to her son, and with the other pointed to his ancestors, 1 MS.

The provost and magistrates contended that they must execute the law which had pronounced the sentence, or become themselves amenable to its penalties. One party of the ministers, taking a middle course, advised that two of their brethren, Mr David Ferguson and Mr Thomas Buchanan, should be sent to remonstrate with the king. But from this the fiery Davison loudly dissented. \" Ye talk,\" said he, \"of replacing John Durie. Will ye become suppliants for reinstating him whom the king had no power to displace, albeit his foolish flock have yielded ? \" At this, Sir James Balfour started to his feet, and fixed his eyes sternly on the speaker. Balfour was notorious as one of the mur derers of Darnley ; yet having been acquitted of that crime by a packed jury, he had resumed his functions as an elder of the Kirk.2 Such a man was not likely to overawe the bold minister ; and he un dauntedly continued. \" Tell me what flesh may or can displace the great King's ambassador, so long as he keeps within the bounds of his commission?\" Saying this, he left the Assembly in great heat, per ceiving that the question would be carried against him, which accordingly happened ; for, on the resump tion of the debate, it was determined that Durie should submit, if the magistrates, who belonged to his flock, insisted. They did so : and that very evening, he was charged not only to depart from the town, but 1 MS. Calderwood, Ayscough, 4736, sol. 1192, June 27, 1582. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

On reaching the Market Cross, he directed the notaries to read a written protestation, in which he attested the sincerity of his life and doctrine ; and declared, that although he obeyed the sentence of banishment, no mortal power should pre vent him from preaching the Word.2 Upon this, placing a piece of money in the hands of the notaries, he took instruments, as it was termed ; and during the ceremony, Davison, who stood by his side, broke into threats and lamentation. \" I too must take in struments,\" cried he ; \" and this, I protest, is the most sorrowful sight these eyes ever rested on ; a shepherd removed by his own flock, to pleasure flesh and blood, and because he has spoken the truth. But plague, and fearful judgments, will yet light on the inventors.\" All this, however, passed away quietly, except on the part of the speakers ; and the denun ciations of the minister appear to have met with little sympathy. A shoemaker's wife in the crowd cried out, if any would cast stones at him, she would help.3 A bystander, also, was heard to whisper to his neigh bour, looking with scorn on the two protesters, \" If I durst, I would take instruments that ye are both knaves.\" 4 Shortly before this, a conference had been held at Stirling, between the commissioners of the court and 1 MS.

They accordingly prepared their \" Articles,\" which, in bold and unequi vocal language, drew the distinction between the obedience they owed to the king and the submission that was due to the Kirk. They complained, that the mouarch, by advice of evil counsellors, had taken upon him that spiritual authority which belonged to Christ alone, as the King and Head of his Church ; and, as examples of this unwarrantable usurpation, appealed to the late banishment of Durie, the maintaining an excommunicated bishop, the interdicting the General Assembly from the exercise of their undoubted spirit ual rights, and the evil handling of the brethren of Glasgow for doing their duty in the case of Mont- gomery.1 The presentation of these Articles was intrusted to a committee of the ministers. It embraced Pont, Lawson, Smeton, Lindsay, Hay, Polwart, Black burn, Galloway, Christison, Ferguson, James Melvil, Buchanan, Brand, Gillespie, Duncanson the minister of the king's household, and Andrew Melvil principal of the new College at St Andrews. To these a single layman was added in the person of Erskine of Dun, a name much venerated in the history of the Kirk. It had been agreed, that these \" Griefs\" should be pre sented to the king in the beginning of July ; and on the 6th of that month, this intrepid band of ministers set out for Perth, where James then held his court. Their adversaries had in vain made many exertions to intimidate them ; and secret information had been sent by Sir James Melvil, to his relative Andrew 1 MS.

On being ushered into the presence-chamber, they found Lennox and Arran with the king; and laid their remonstrance on the table. Arran took it up, glanced his eye over it, and furiously demanded, \" Who dares sign these treasonable Articles?\" \u2014 \"We dare,\" responded Andrew Melvil, \" and will render our lives in the cause.\" As he said this, he came forward to the council-table, took the pen, subscribed his name, and was followed by all his brethren. The two nobles were intimidated by this unlooked-for courage : the king was silent ; and, after some conference, the min isters were dismissed in peace.1 It would have been well for Lennox and Arran had they taken warning from these symptoms of deter mined opposition ; but they underrated the influence of the ministers, and were not aware that, at this moment, a strong party of the nobility was forming against them. It was fostered by the Kirk, and en couraged by England ; whilst its leaders, as usual in such enterprises, appear, about this time, to have drawn up a written contract, which declared the pur poses for which they had leagued together. This paper was entitled the \"Form of the Band, made among the noblemen that is enterprised against Dobany ; \" 2 and it described, in strong language, the causes which had led to the association. These were said to be, the dangers incurred by the professors of God's true religion; the intended overthrow of the gospel, by godless men, who had crept into credit 1 MS.

Shortly previous to the interview of the ministers with the king at Perth, Montgomery had been rein stated in the bishoprick of Glasgow by the royal command ; and the sentence of excommunication pro nounced upon him by the Kirk was reversed, and de clared null. To soften, at the same time, the effect of this strong measure of defiance, the king, by a public proclamation, renounced all intention of making any 1 Caligula, C. vii. sol. 14, British Museum.

But Lawson, one of the leading ministers, flew to the magistrates, accused them of permitting an excommu nicated traitor to walk the streets, and compelled them to discharge him from their city.1 As he de parted, Montgomery threatened, that within half an hour they should change their tone ; and within a brief space returned with a royal proclamation, which was read at the Cross, commanding all men to accept him as a true Christian and good subject. He brought also letters to the same purport, which were sent to the lords of session. All, however, was in vain, so strong Avas the popular current against him. The provost, in an agony of doubt between his duty to the king and his allegiance to the Kirk, imprecated vengeance upon his head, and declared he would have given a thousand merks he had never seen his face. The judges refused to hear him : and a report arising, that he should be again expelled, an immense crowd assembled. Tradesmen, armed with bludgeons, and women with stones, waited round the door of the court ; and their expected victim would probably have been torn in pieces, had he not been smuggled away by the magistrates through a narrow lane called the Kirk Heugh, which led to the Potterrow gate. His retreat, however, became known ; the people broke in upon him with many abusive terms.

His penetration did not enable him to see the formid able strength which was gradually arraying itself against him ; and his blind obstinacy only hurried on the catastrophe. At the instigation of France,2 he determined, by a sudden attack, to overwhelm his enemies ; and, assisted by the force which himself and Arran could command, to seize the Earls of Gowrie, Mar, and Glencairn, with Lindsay, and the chief of the Protestant nobles. Having achieved this, and banished the leading ministers of the Kirk, he looked forward to a triumphant conclusion of his labours in the establishment of Episcopacy, and the association of the imprisoned queen with the government of her son. Bowes, however, the English ambassador, became acquainted with these intentions, and informed the Protestant lords of the plot for their destruction. The minuteness of the information which this veteran diplomatist elicited by his pensioned informers, is remarkable.3 He assured Gowrie and his friends, that they must look to themselves, or be content soon to change a prison for a scaffold ; that he had certain intelligence the king had consented to arraign them of a conspiracy against his person : and they knew that, if convicted of treason, their fate was sealed. It was by Walsingham's orders that Bowres made this communication, in the hope that it would rouse 1 MS. Calderwood, sol. 1202. 2 Sir R.

The only danger to be dreaded was in prematurely exploding the mine already in preparation, and thus risking a failure. The band or contract, as we have seen, had been drawn up ; but it was still unsigned by many of the nobility. There was scarcely time to concentrate all their forces ; and although they made sure of the approval of the ministers of the Kirk, who had already cordially co-operated with them in all their efforts against Lennox, still these ecclesiastical associates were now scattered in different parts of the country, and could not be individually consulted. On the other hand, the danger was imminent ; and if they acted instantly, some circumstances promised success. The young king was at Perth, separated both from Lennox and Arran.2 He had resorted to that coun try to enjoy his favourite pastime of the chase ; his court was few in number ; Gowrie, Glammis, and Lindsay, three of the chief conspirators, were all powerful in the neighbourhood of Perth ; and should they delay, as had been intended, till the king re moved to the capital, it would become more difficult, if not impossible, to execute their design. In this state of uncertainty, they received intelligence which made them more than suspect that Lennox had discovered 1 Original draft, Sir Robert Bowes to Walsingham, 25th August, 1582, Bowes' Letter-book.

JAMES VI. 321 their conspiracy.1 This settled the question : and having once decided on action, their proceedings were as bold as they had before been dilatory. In an in credibly short time, Gowrie, Mar, Lindsay, the Master of Glammis, and their associates, assembled a thousand men, and surrounded Ruthven castle, where the king then lay. It was Gowrie's own seat ; and James, who, it appears, had no suspicion of the toils laid for him, had accepted the invitation of its master, thinking onlyr of his rural sports. To his astonishment, the Earls of Mar and Gowrie entered his presence, removed his guards, presented a list of their grievances, and, whilst they professed the utmost fidelity to his person, took special care that all possibility of escape was cut off. Meanwhile, the intelligence flew to Arran that the king was captive ; and he, and Colonel Stewart his brother, set off in fiery speed at the head of a party of horse. Their attempt at rescue was, however, too late ; for Colonel Stewart was attacked and defeated by Mar and Lochleven, who threw themselves upon him from an ambush, where they had watched his approach ; whilst Arran, who had galloped by a nearer way to Ruthven, was seized the moment he entered the castle court, and confined under a guard. All this had passed with such rapidity, and the lords who sur rounded the king treated him with so much respect, that James deluded himself with the hope that he might still be a free monarch. But next morning dispelled the illusion. As he prepared to take horse, the Master of Glammis intimated to him that the lords who were now with him deemed it safer for his grace to remain at Ruthven. James declared he would go that instant, and was about to leave the chamber, when 1 MS. letter, Sir George Bowes to Walsingham, August 26, 1572, Bowes' Letter-book. Melvil's Memoirs, pp. 277, 281 .

The indignity drew tears from the young monarch, and some of the associated lords remonstrated with Glammis ; but he sternly answered, \" Better bairns 1 greet, than bearded men ; \" a speech which his royal master never afterwards forgot or forgave.2 But although thus far successful, the actors in this violent and treasonable enterprise were in a dangerous predicament. Gowrie, Mar, Glammis, and Lindsay, were indeed all assured of each other, and convinced that they must stand or fall together ; but the band or covenant which, according to the practice of the times, should have secured the assistance of their associates, was still unsigned by a great majority of the most powerful nobles and barons, on whose assistance they had calculated. On the other hand, the Duke of Lennox could reckon on the support of the Earls of Huntley, Sutherland, Morton, Orkney, Crawford, and Bothwell ; besides Lords Herries, Seton, Hume, Sir Thomas Kerr of Fernyhirst, Sir James Balfour, the Abbot of Newbottle, and many inferior barons ; whilst the Earls of Caithness, March, and Marshal, professed neutrality.3 This array of opposition was sufficiently appalling ; and for a brief season the enterprisers of the \"raid\"4 of Ruthven (as it was called) began to waver and tremble ;5 but a moment's consideration convinced them, that if there was danger in advance, there was 1 Bairns, children ; greet, weep. 2 MS.

They were already guilty of treason ; they had laid violent hands on the king's person ; had defied Lennox, imprisoned Arran, out raged the laws, and raised against them the feelings, not only of their opponents, but of all good citizens. If they drew back, ruin was inevitable. If they went forward, although the peril was great, the struggle might yet end triumphantly. They had the young king in their hands, and could work upon his timidity and inexperience, by menacing his life ; they had pos session of Arran, also, a man whom they dreaded far more than the gentler and vacillating^ Lennox ; they were certain of the active support of the ministers of the Kirk ; and Bowes and Walsingham had already assured them of the warm approval, and, if necessary^, the assistance of England. All this was encouraging ; and they determined, at every risk, to press on reso lutely in the revolution which they had begun. In the meantime, whilst such scenes passed at Ruthven, the capital presented a stirring scene. Lennox, who was at his castle of Dalkeith, in the immediate neighbourhood of the city, when he re ceived the intelligence of the surprise of the king, deeming himself insecure in the open country, took refuge with his household within the town. On his arrival, the magistrates despatched messengers to Ruthven, to ascertain the truth or falsehood of the king's captivity from his own lips ; the ministers of the Kirk began to exult, and rouse the people to join with the Ruthven lords ; and Mr James Lawson, al though earnestly entreated, by the provost of the city, to be temperate in his sermon, replying, in the words of Micah, that what the Lord put in his mouth he would speak,1 seized the opportunity to deliver from 1 Calderwood, MS.

It was true, he said, that these two barons had subscribed the Con fession of Faith, professed the true religion, and com municated with their brethren at the Lord's table ; but their deeds testified that they were utter enemies of the truth. Had they not violated discipline, de spised the solemn sentence of excommunication, set up tulchan bishops, and traduced the most godly of the nobility and of the ministry? And as for this Duke of Lennox, what had been his practices since the day he canje amongst them ? With what taxes had he burdened the commonwealth, to sustain his intolerable pride ? What vanity in apparel ; what looseness in manners ; what superfluity in banquet ing; what fruits and follies of French growth had he not imported into their simple country? Well might they be thankful ; well praise God for their delivery from what was to have been executed the next Tuesday. Well did it become Edinburgh to take up the song of the Psalmist \u2014 \" Laqueus contritus est, et nos liberati sumus.\" 1 Whilst the ministers of the Kirk thus eulogized the enterprise of the Ruthven lords, Elizabeth, who had speedily received intelligence of their success, despatched Sir George Carey to Scotland, with letters to the young king, and instructions to co-operate with her ambassador Bowes, in strengthening the hands of Gowrie and his faction. Randolph, too, wrote in great exultation to Walsingham, rejoicing in the success of the revolution ; and, with the avidity and instinct of the bird which comes out in the storm, requesting to be again employed in the troubled at mosphere of Scotland.

JAMES VI. 325 the measures which had been adopted, he, in the spirit of the Puritan party to which he belonged, pronounced the king's captivity a reward conferred by God on his sincere followers. \" If it be true,\" said he, \" that the king be now in the Protestants' hands, the duke pursued, Arran imprisoned, and his brother slain, we may then see from this what it is to be true followers of Christ, in earnest preaching, and persevering in setting forth His word without respect or worldly policies.\"1 It seems strange it should never have occurred to this zealous diplomatist, that the imprisonment of a king, and the violent invasion and slaughter of his councillors, were not the fruits to be expected from the gospel of peace and love. Meanwhile, the captive monarch considered the late proceedings in a very different light, and meditated many schemes of escape and revenge ; but he was alone and closely watched : he did not even consider his life in safety ; and although it would be difficult to believe that Gowrie and his associates had any such atrocious designs, yet the history of Scotland afforded him too good a ground for these apprehensions. Lennox, on the other hand, was timid and irresolute, allowed the precious moments for action to pass, and contented himself with despatching Lord Herries, and the Abbot of Newbottle, with some offers of recon ciliation, which were instantly rejected.2 These envoys, on arriving at Stirling, where Gowrie and his fellow conspirators now held the king a pri soner, were not permitted to see James in private, but were introduced to him in the council chamber, where they declared their message. \" The Duke of Lennox,\" they said, \" had sent them to inquire into 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, September 2, 1582, Maidstone. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office."], [332, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1582. 326 the truth of a rumour, that his sovereign lord was forcibly detained in the hands of his enemies ; for if it were so, it was his duty to set him free ; and with the assistance of his good subjects, he would instantly make the attempt.\" The scene which occurred, on the delivery of this message, must have been an extra ordinary one. Without giving Gowrie or his friends a moment to reply, James started from his seat, crying out it was all true ; he was a captive ; he was not at liberty to go where he chose, or to move a step with out a guard : and he bade them tell it openly, that all who loved him should assist the duke, and achieve his deliverance. The Ruthven lords were, for a moment, overwhelmed with confusion : but they outbraved the accusation. Their sovereign, they declared, had no more faithful subjects than themselves; nor should he be denied to go where he pleased ; only, they would not permit the Duke of Lennox and the Earl of Arran to mislead him any longer. If he valued, therefore, the life of that person, he would do well to cause him to retire instantly, and quietly, to France. If this were not done, they must call him to account for his late actions, and enforce against him the most rigorous penalty of the law.1 Such was the message which they sent back by Lord Herries ; and they followed it up by a peremptory command to Lennox to deliver up Dunbarton castle, quit the kingdom within twelve days, and, meanwhile, confine himself with a small train to his houses of Aberdour or Dalkeith ; orders which, after a short consideration, he despondingly and pusillauimously prepared to obey.2 1 Spottiswood, pp. 320-321. 2 Copy of the time, endorsed, 14th September from Stirling, 20th September to Windsor; also, MS. letter, Bowes to Walsingham, Stirling, 20th September, 1582, Bowes' Letter-book. \""], [333, "1582.

Mr John Durie, who had been banished from his pulpit, in the capital, was brought back in processional triumph. As he entered the town, a crowd of nearly two thousand people walked before him bareheaded, and singing the 124th Psalm ; and, amid the shouts of the citizens, conducted him to the High Church.1 It was observed that Lennox, from a window, looked down on the crowd, and tore his beard for anger ; but although still supported by a considerable party amongst the citizens, he showed no disposition to contest the field with his enemies ; and next day, accompanied by Lord Maxwell, Ferny hirst, and others of his friends, he left the city, and took the road to Dalkeith. This, however, was only to blind his opponents ; for he soon wheeled off in an 1 MS. Calderwood, sol. 1212.

They had already compelled the king to issue a proclamation, in which he declared that he was a free monarch, and preferred to remain for the present at Stirling : both assertions being well known to be false. They now committed Arran to a stricter ward, summoned a convention of the nobility for an early day, required the Kirk to send commis sioners to this Assembly, promised to hear and remove its complaints, and gave a cordial welcome to Sir George Carey aud Sir Robert Bowes, the English ambassadors, who had now arrived at Stirling.2 At this audience Carey delivered a gracious message from his royal mistress ; but when he alluded to the dangerous practices of Lennox, and charged him with meditating an alteration in religion, and the overthrow of the king's estate and person, James could not con ceal his passion and disgust. He warmly vindicated his favourite : affirmed that nothing had been done by Lennox alone, but with advice of the council ; and declared his utter disbelief that any treason could be proved against him.3 Elizabeth and Walsingham, however, trusted that this would not be so difficult ; for they had lately seized and examined two persons, who managed the secret correspondence which the im prisoned Queen of Scots had recently carried on with 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Archibald Douglas to Randolph, 12th September, 1582.

This Archibald, a daring and unprincipled man, had been a principal agent in the murder of Darnley, and had played, since that time, a double game in England. He had become reconciled to Lennox, and was trusted, in their confidential measures, by Mary and the French court ; whilst he had ingratiated him self with Elizabeth, Walsingham, and Randolph, to whom he unscrupulously betrayred the intrigues of their opponents. On the late fall of Arran, the mortal enemy of the house of Douglas, he had written an exulting letter to Randolph,1 and had begun his preparations for his return to his native country, when he was seized, by the orders of the English queen, his house and papers ransacked, and his person committed to the custody of Henry Killigrew, who by no means relished the charge of the \" old Fox,\" as he styled him in his letter to Walsingham.2 From the revelations of these two persons much was expected ; and George Douglas confessed that he had carried on a correspondence between Mary and her son, in which she had consented to \"demit\" the crown in his favour, on the condition of being associated with him in the government : he affirmed, too, that her friends in France had consented to recognise him as king.

Arran, indeed, who was still a prisoner at Ruthven, offered to purchase his freedom by dis covering enough to cost Lennox his head ; 1 but the lords would not trust him, and preferred relying on their own exertions to accepting so dangerous an alliance. In these efforts they derived the most active assis tance from the ministers of the Kirk, who, on first hearing of the enterprise at Ruthven, despatched Mr James Lawson, and Mr John Davison, to have a pre liminary conference with Gowrie and his associates at Stirling;2 and, a few days after, sent a more solemn deputation, including Andrew Melvil and Thomas Smeton, to explain to the privy council the griefs and abuses of which the Kirk demanded redress.3 At this meeting, the causes which had led to the late re volution were fully debated ; and a band or covenant was drawn up, declaring the purposes for which it had been undertaken, and calling upon all who loved their country and the true religion to subscribe it, and unite in their defence. Two days after this, Lennox, from his retreat at Dunbarton, published an indignant denial of the accusations brought against him ; in which he demanded a fair trial before the three estates, and declared his readiness to suffer any pun ishment, if found guilty.4 He alluded in this to the \u00bb MS. letter, State-paper Office, Archibald Douglas to Randolph, September 12, 1582. \" 2 On the 15th September, 1582.

In the midst of these commotions which followed the raid of Ruthven, occurred the death of BucLanan, a man justly entitled to the epithet great, if the true criteria of such a character are originality of genius, and the impression left by it upon his age. His in tellect, naturally fearless and inquisitive, caught an early aud eager hold of the principles of the Reforma tion ; and having gone abroad, and fallen into the toils of the inquisition, persecution completed what nature had begun. In politics he was a republican ; and his famous treatise, \" De Jure Regni apud Scotos,\" was the first work which boldly and eloquently advocated those principles of popular liberty, then almost new, and now so familiar to Europe. In religion he was at first a leveller, and with the keen and vindictive temper which distinguished him, exerted every effort to overthrow the Roman Catholic church ; but in his later years, when the struggle took place between Episcopacy and Presbyterianism, his sentiments be came more moderate or indifferent ; and latterly he took no part in those busy intrigues of the Kirk and its supporters which terminated in the raid of Ruthven. Of his poetical works, so varied in style and so excellent in execution, it is difficult to speak 1 MS. Calderwood, sol. 1225."], [338, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1582. 332 too highly; for seldom did a finer and more impassioned vein of poetry flow through a Latinity that, without servile imitation, approached so near to the Augustan age. In his history of his native country he is great, but unequal : his was not the age of severe and criti cal investigation ; the school in which he studied was that of Livy and the historians of ancient Rome, in which individuality and truth is often lost in the breadth and generality of its pictures. But in their excellencies he has equalled and sometimes surpassed them. The calm flow of his narrative, his lucid arrangement, the strong sense, originality, and depth of his reflections, and the ease and vigour of his un shackled style, need not dread a comparison with the best authors of the ancient world. The point where he fails is that in which they, too, are weakest \u2014 the cardinal virtue of truth. It is melancholy to find so much fable embalmed and made attractive in his earlier annals ; and when he descends later, and writes as a contemporary, it is easy to detect that party spirit and unhappy obliquity of vision, which distorts or will not see the truth. In an interesting letter quoted by the best of his biographers,1 and written not long before his death, he tells his friend, that having reached his seventy-fifth year, and struck upon that rock beyond which nothing remains for man but labour and sorrow, it was his only care to remove out of the world with as little noise as possible. With this view he abstracted himself from all public business; left the court at Stirling, and retired to Edinburgh, where, on the 28th September, 1582, his wishes were almost too literally fulfilled : for amid the tumult and agitation which succeeded the raid of 1 Irving's Life of Buchanan, p. 273."], [339, "JAMES VI. 1582. 333 Ruthven, his death took place in his seventy-sixth year, unnoticed, unrecorded, and accompanied by such destitution, that he left not enough to defray his funeral. He was buried at the public expense in the cemetery of the Grey Friars : but his country gave him no monument ; and at this day the spot is un known where rest the ashes of one of the greatest of her sons.1 Soon after the death of Buchanan, the General Assembly met at Edinburgh on the 9th of October ; and the noblemen who had engaged in the enterprise at Ruthven, having laid before this great ecclesiastical council their \" Declaration\" of the grounds on which they acted, received, to their satisfaction, the cordial approval of the Kirk. Nor was this all : the Assembly issued their orders, that every minister throughout the kingdom should justify the action, and explain to his congregation the imminent perils from which it had delivered religion, the commonwealth, and the king's person ; and not satisfied even with this, it was determined to institute a rigid prosecution of all persons who presumed to express a different opinion.2 But although thus resolute in the support of the Ruthven confederates, as far as concerned their seizure of the king, the ministers severely rebuked the same noblemen for the profligacy of their lives, and their sacrilegious appropriation of the ecclesias tical revenues. Davison the minister of Libberton, in his conference with Gowrie and his friends, called loudly on them to begin their reformation of the com monwealth with a thorough reform of their sinful and 1 Irving's Life of Buchanan, p. 309.

By her anxious and repeated orders he exerted himself to obtain it ; but without success. Gowrie at first equivocated, and was unwilling to admit the fact ; but when Bowes convinced him that he had certain proof of it, he changed his ground, alleging that such precious papers could not be delivered to Elizabeth without the special directions of the king. This wras absurd, for James at this moment was a mere cipher ; but the leader in the late revolution did not choose to part with papers which, in his busy and intriguing career, he might one day turn to his advantage.3 Gowrie's is the last hand into which we can trace these famous letters, which have since totally disappeared. The situation of James was now pitiable and de grading.

The most anxious wish of his heart was to see the duke restored to his former power ; but to betray this now would, he thought, be to bring his favourite into more imminent peril ; whilst, if he allowed him to retire for a short season to France, he might not only escape ruin, but return with renewed influence and power. There were some friends of Lennox, on the other hand, who exhorted him strongly to attack his enemies, and assured him that every day spent in inactivity, added strength to their position and weakened his own ; whereas, if he boldly faced the danger, they were ready to assemble a force sufficient to overwhelm Gowrie, and rescue the king. These so far prevailed that, on one of the dark nights of December,1 it was resolved to attack the palace of Holyrood, massacre the Ruthven lords, and carry off the king ; but the ministers, and Sir George Bowes the English ambas sador, sounded the alarm : a strong watch was kept ; and although Fernyhirst, Maxwell, Sir John Seton, and other barons, were known to have joined Lennox, and parties of horsemen were seen hovering all night round the city, the enterprise, from some unknown cause, was abandoned, and the king remained a prisoner.2 This failure was a triumph to the opposite faction, who lost no time in following up the advantage. A letter was sent to the duke, to which the king had been compelled to put his name, charging him with disturbing the government, and with recklessly 1 On the 4th December, 1582. 2 MS.

It was the anxious desire of the English queen that no communication should take place between La Motte and the duke, as she had received secret in formation that this Frenchman came to promote the great scheme of an \" association\" between Mary and her son, by which the Scottish queen wras nominally to be joined with him in the government, whilst he was to retain the title of king.3 It wTas believed, also, that he was empowered to propose a marriage between the young king and a daughter of France, and to strengthen the Catholic party by promises of speedy support.

He was eager to hurry into Scotland before Lennox had left it ; but matters were so managed, that they only met on the road; and here, too, Davison, who had received his lesson, took care that their conference should be of the briefest description.1 Lennox then passed on to London, and the French and English ambassadors held their way for Scotland. Meanwhile, the Ruthven lords, with their allies the ministers of the Kirk, were much elated by the triumph over Lennox ; and Bowes, in a letter to Walsingham, assured the secretary, that Elizabeth might have them all at her devotion if she would but advance the money necessary for their contentment and the support of the king.2 They selected Mr John Colvile, who had acted a principal part in the late revolution, to proceed as ambassador to the English queen. He came nominally from the King of Scots, but really from them, and brought letters to Walsing ham from Gowrie, Mar, the Prior of Blantyre, and the Abbot of Dunfermline, the great leaders of that party. On his arrival at court, he found there his old antagonist the Duke of Lennox, who had brought a letter and a message to Elizabeth from his royal master. This princess had, at first, refused to see him under any circumstances ; but afterwards admitted him to ;ate interview, in which, to use the homely but expressive phrase of Calderwood, the historian of the Kirk, \" she rattled him up,\" 3 addressing to him, at first, many cutting speeches on his misgovernment ; 1 MS, letter, State-paper Office, Davison to Burghley, January 3, 1582.

It is curious to observe by what low devices, and with what complete success, the English secretary became possessed of Lennox's most secret feelings and opinions. There was at the English court one Mr William Fowler, a gentleman of Scottish extrac tion, and apparently connected with the duke, who had admitted him into his secret confidence. Fowler, at the same time, had insinuated himself into the good graces of Mauvissiere, the resident French am bassador at the court of Elizabeth ; and by pretending a devoted attachment to French interests and the cause of the captive Queen of Scots, he had become acquainted with much of the intentions and intrigues of Mary and her friends. This man was a spy of Walsingham's ; and his letters to this statesman, detailing his secret conversations with Lennox and Mauvissiere, have been preserved. The picture which they present is striking. In their first interview, Lennox showed much satisfaction. \" Your mother's house,\" said he to Fowler, \" was the first I entered, in coming to Scotland, and the last I quitted, in leav ing the country.\" The duke then told him that the French ambassador was not in London, but had been 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, singham, January, 1 582-3.

This was a trick, he added, to prevent a meeting between him and Mau vissiere ; and he heard, also, that the Queen of England would not see him ; but, in truth, he had little to say to her, except to complain of the conduct of her ambassador in Scotland. At this moment their con ference was broken off by some of the courtiers, who appeared dissatisfied that they should talk together ; and the Master of Livingston, who was in the con fidence of Lennox and his friends, joined the party. Fowler upon this took Livingston aside, and ex pressed his astonishment that the duke should have left Scotland, when he could muster so strong a party against his enemies. Livingston replied, that Lennox knew both his own strength and the king's good will ; but that he had been forced to leave Scotland, \" be cause the king mistrusted very much his own life and safety ; having been sharply threatened by the lords, that, if he did not cause the duke to depart, he should not be the longest liver of them all.\"1 Arran, it appeared, had also written to James, assuring him that the only surety for his life was to send Lennox out of Scotland ; and Fowler, in his secret meetings with Mauvissiere the French ambassador, had the address to elicit from him, and communicate to Wal singham, the intended policy of France. La Motte Fenelon had been sent, he said, to renew the old league with Scotland ; to offer succour to the young king, if he found him in captivity, and a guard for the security of his person ; to promise pensions to the principal noblemen in Scotland, as they had in Car dinal Beaton's time ; and, if possible, to advise a marriage with Spain.

This was that same Archibald Douglas, above mentioned as a man of considerable ability and restless intrigue. It had been proposed by Lennox to bring Douglas back to Scotland, and employ his power and talents against the English faction and the Kirk; but the young king had shrunk from receiving a man stained with his father's blood : and the prisoner, anxious for his freedom, was ready to purchase it by betraying the secrets of his royal mistress; consenting to plot against her with the same activity wrhich he had exerted in her behalf.2 We shall soon perceive the success of this base scheme, and its fatal influence upon the fate of Mary. In the mean time, Elizabeth gave an audience to Colvile, the ambassador of Gowrie and the Kirk, and assured him of her entire approval of their spirited proceedings against Lennox. She cautioned him, in strong terms, against French intrigues ; observing, that though the king promised fair, yet, as the recent conspiracy for seizing his person plainly showed, 1 Fowler to Walsingham, January 19, 1582-3.

JAMES VI. 341 \" Satanas non dormit ;\" and she concluded by a general assurance of support, and a promise to restore Archibald Douglas to his native country, as soon as he had cleared himself from the accusations against him in England.1 Scotland, during these transactions, must have been in a state of extraordinary excitement: it was a busy stirring stage, upon which the young king, the ministers of the Kirk, the French ambassador, and Gowrie, with the rest of the Ruthven lords, acted their different parts with the utmost zeal and activity. James, whom necessity had made an adept in political hypo crisy, or, as he sometimes styled it, king-craft, pre tended to be completely reconciled to the departure of Lennox, and said nothing in condemnation of the violent conduct of his opponents ; whilst he secretly intrigued for the recall of his favourite, and antici pated the moment when he should resume his liberty, and take an ample revenge upon his enemies. The ministers, on their side, deemed the season too pre cious to be neglected ; they had expelled the man whom they considered the emissary of Antichrist, the young king's person was in the hands of their friends, and they determined that he should remain so. Such being the state of things, the arrival of Mon sieur de Menainville the French ambassador, and his request to have a speedy audience of the king, aroused them to instant action. From the pulpits resounded the notes of warning and alarm : France was depicted as the stronghold of idolatry ; the French king pointed out as the tiger who glutted himself with the blood of God's people ; it became amongst them a matter of serious debate whether it were lawful to receive any ambassador from an idola- 1 State-paper Office, January 18, 1582-3, Her Majesty's answer to Mr Colvile's negotiation."], [348, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1582-3. 342 tor ; and when the more violent could not carry their wishes, and it was decided that, \" in matters politick,\" such a messenger might be permitted to enter the kingdom, a committee was appointed to Avait upon the young king, and read him a solemn lesson of admoni tion.1 In this interview James behaved with spirit, and proved a match in theological and political con troversy for the divines who came to instruct him. These were, Pont, Lawson, Lindsay, and Davison ; and, on entering the royal cabinet, they found Gowrie, the justice-clerk, and others of the council, with the king, who thanked them for their advice, but observed that he was bound by the law of nations to use courtesy to all ambassadors. Should an envoy come from the pope, or even from the Turk, still he must receive him. This Lawson stoutly controverted ; but the king not only maintained his point, but took occasion to blame the abuse with which this minister had assailed the French monarch. \"As for that,\" said they, \"the priests speak worse of yrour grace in France, than we of the King of France in Scotland.\" \u2014 \" And must ye imitate them in evil ? \" retorted James. \" Not in evil,\" was their answer, \" but in liberty. It is as fair for us to speak the truth boldly, as they boldly speak lees;2 and if we were silent, the chronicles would speak and reprove it.\" \u2014 \" Chronicles,\" said James, \" ye write not histories when ye preach ; \" upon which Davison whispered in Lawson's ear, that preachers had more authority to declare the truth in preaching, than any historiographer in the world. Gowrie then observed, that as hasty a riddance as might be, should be got of the French ambassadors, and the ministers took their leave ; but Davison 1 MS.

It had been debated by the Kirk, with a reference to their arrival, whether private masses should be permitted under any circumstances ; and aware of this, he had scarcely risen from kissing the king's hand, when he put on his cap, and boldly claimed the privileges which belonged to his office. \" I am come,\" said he, \" from the most Christian King of France, my sovereign, to offer all aid to the establishment of quietness ; and being an ambassador, and not a subject, I crave to be treated as such ; and as I have food allotted for my body, so do I require to be allowed the food of my soul, I mean the mass ; which if it is denied me, I may not stay and suffer a Christian prince's authority and embassy to be violated in my person.\"2 This spirited address made much noise at the time, and drew from Mr James Lawson, on the succeeding Sabbath, a\"counterblast\" of defiance, 1 MS.

Nor was this all : the indig nation of the Kirk was roused to a still higher pitch, wdien the king commanded the magistrates of the capital to give (as had been usual in such cases) a farewell banquet to De la Motte Fenelon. This am bassador now proposed to return to France, leaving his colleague, Monsieur De Menainville, to watch over the interests of that kingdom in Scotland ; and nothing could equal the abuse and opprobrious terms which were employed, to convince men of the horror of such a proposal. Even the sacred ornament of the cross, which La Motte, who was a knight of the order of the \" Saint Esprit,\" wore upon his mantle, was described as the badge of Antichrist ; and when the influence of the ministers was found insufficient to stay the feast, a solemn fast was proclaimed for the same day, to continue as long as the alleged profane entertainment wTas enacting. At this moment, the scene presented by the capital was extraordinary. On one side, the king and his courtiers indulging in mirth and festive carousal ; whilst on the other was heard the thunder of the Kirk, and its ministers \" crying out all evil, slanderous, and injurious words that could be spoken against France ; \" and threatening wdth anathema and excommunication the citizens who had dared to coun tenance the unhallowed feast.1 Meanwhile the king became every day more weary of his captive condition ; and secretly favoured the efforts of De Menainville, who remained in Scotland, 1 Spottiswood, p. 324.

It was necessary, however, to act slowly and with great caution, for the keen eyes of Bowes and Davi son, Elizabeth's agents at the Scottish court, early detected these intrigues. Walsingham, too, was informed of the frequent communications which took place between the captive queen and her son ; and his spies and agents on the continent sent him, almost daily, information of the correspondence of the Eng lish refugees and foreign Catholics with their friends in England.2 Had Elizabeth seconded, as was neces sary, the indefatigable efforts of her ministers, it can hardly be doubted that she would have overthrown the efforts of France ; but her parsimony was so excessive,2 that Walsingham found himself compelled to renounce many advantages which the slightest sacrifice of money would have secured. It was in vain that she commanded Bowes and Davison to remonstrate with the young king ; to warn him of the confederacies of foreign princes against religion ; to point out the great forces lately raised in France ; to declare her astonishment at his suffering the in solence of De Menainville, and receiving, as she heard he had done, with complacency7, the congratulations of La Motte on his intended \" association \" with his mother, the Queen of Scots. It was in vain that she expressed her alarm at the report which had reached her, that he meant to recall the Duke of Lennox from France, and restore the Earl of Arran to his liberty; in vain that she begged him to peruse the letter written to him with her own hand, expressing 1 MS.

These remonstrances James, who was an early adept in diplomatic hypocrisy, received with expressions of gratitude and devotedness; but they did not in the slightest degree alter his efforts to regain his freedom, and strengthen his party ; whilst, with a talent and sagacity superior to his years, he controlled the more violent of his friends, forbade all sudden movements, and calmly watched for a favour able moment to put forth his strength, and resume his freedom. This patience, indeed, was still necessary; for, although gradually losing ground, the strength of Gowrie, and the faction of the Kirk, was yet too powerful for their opponents ; and a convention hav ing been held by them in the capital, (18th April, 1583,) it was resolved to assemble parliament. Against this measure James, who dreaded the proscription of his friends, and the total overthrow of his designs, remonstrated in the strongest terms, and even to tears, when his request was denied. He prevailed so far, however, as to have the meeting of the three estates delayed till October ; and cheerfully consented that a friendly embassy should be despatched to England. To this service, two persons of very opposite principles were appointed : Colonel Stewart, the brother of the Earl of Arran, who was much in the king's confidence, and had been bribed by De Menainville ; and Mr John Colvile, who was attached to Gowrie aud the Ruthven lords. Their open instructions were to communicate to Elizabeth, from the king, the measures he had adopted for the security and tranquillity of his realm ; to request her approval and assistance ; to move her to restore the lands in England which belonged to his"], [353, "1582-3. JAMES VI. 347 grandfather the Earl of Lennox, and the Countess of Lennox his grandmother, and to have some consulta tion on his marriage.1 They were, lastly, enjoined to make strict inquiry whether any act was contemplated in prejudice of his succession to the English crown, and, if possible, to ascertain the queen's own feelings upon this delicate subject.2 De Menainville the French ambassador still lingered in Scotland, although he had received his answer and applied for his passports;3 but the king was unwilling that he should leave court before he had completely organized the scheme for his delivery. Of all these intrigues Walsingham was fully aware : for De la Motte Fenelon, in passing through London,4 had informed Fowler of the great coalition against the Ruthven lords ; and Fowler, of whose treacherous practices the ambassador had no suspicion, told all again to Walsingham.5 It appeared, from these revelations that La Motte had in his pocket, to be presented to his master the French king, a list of the most powerful noblemen in Scotland who had banded together for the king's delivery. These were the Earls of Huntley, Arran, Athole, Montrose, Rothes, Morton, Eglinton, Bothwell, Glencairn, and Crawford, with the Lords Hume and Seton. The young king himself had secretly assured La Motte Fenelon, \" that, although he had two eyes, two ears, and two hands, he had but one heart, and that was French ;\" 6 and so successfully had De Menainville 1 MS.

He loves money : granted ; but to take my gold does not hinder him from receiving another's. May we not hope, that such a man will do more for two sums than for one ? He is a party man : I admit it ; but show me any man who has 1 State-paper Office, Copie de la Premiere Lettre, endorsed, Menain ville to La Motte ; but I think the letter is written to Mauvissiere, March 28, 1583."], [355, "1582-3.

For the rest, the game is a good game.\"1 It must have been tantalizing to Walsingham, whose unceasing exertions had thus detected the plots of the French court in Scotland, to find that all their efforts to defeat them, and keep the English party together, were ruined by Elizabeth's extreme parsimony. In other matters, not involving expense, she was active and vigorous enough. Holt, the Jesuit, who was engaged in secret transactions with the Scottish Catholics, had been seized at Leith ; and Elizabeth strongly recommended that he should be, as she expressed it, \" substantially examined, and forced, by torture,\" to discover all he knew.2 She wrote to Gowrie, and to the young king;3 she urged her busy agent, Bowes, to press Menainville's depar ture ; but the moment that Burghley, the lord chan cellor, and Walsingham, recommended the instant advance of ten thousand pounds to counteract the French influence in Scotland, \" she did utterly mislike such a point, (to use Walsingham's words,) because it cast her into charges.\" 4 Of this sum one half was to be given to the young king, and the rest expended upon the nobility, and the entertainment of a resident 1 Copy, State-paper Office, Menainville to Mauvissiere, March 28, 1683.

About this same time, and shortly before the Scot tish ambassadors set out for England, the captive Queen of Scots, worn out with her long imprisonment, and weary of the perpetual dangers and anxieties to which the efforts of the Catholic party exposed her, renewed her negotiations with Elizabeth. Some months before this she had addressed a pathetic and eloquent appeal to that princess, imploring her to abate the rigour of her confinement, to withdraw support from the rebels who kept her son in durance, and to listen to the sincere offers she had so repeatedly made for an accommodation. Some of the passages in this letter were so touchingly expressed, that it is difficult to believe even the cold and politic heart of the English queen could have been insensible to them ; but there were others so cuttingly ironical, and at the same time so true, that we cannot wonder the epistle remained, for a considerable time, unanswered.1 At length, however, Elizabeth despatched Mr Beal, one of her confidential servants, a strict Puritan, and a man of severe saturnine temper, to confer with the imprisoned queen. It may be doubted whether she had any serious intentions of listening to Mary ; but she was anxious, before she received the ambassadors, Stewart and Colvile, to probe her feelings, and as certain how far there existed any mutual confidence between her and her son ; and Beal's letters to Wal singham present us with an interesting picture of this conference. Lord Shrewsbury had been associated with him in the negotiation, of which he gave this account to the English secretary: \"Since our last It will be found with a translation in Whitaker, vol. iv. p. 401."], [357, "1583.

She had a great heart which had preserved her, and desired now to be at rest, by the making of some good accord with her majesty, her son, and herself.\" Beal then told Mary, that, in his opinion, such an agreement or association as had been contemplated was not desired in Scotland, either by the young king or the nobility. \" For the nobility,\" said she, \" all that might hinder it are already gone. I have offended none of them which are now remaining ; and therefore I doubt not but they will like thereof. These are principally to be doubted; Lindsay, Gowrie, Lochleven, Mar, and Angus.

In the association passed between her and her son,\" she said, \" all former offences doue to her were pardoned ;\" adding, \" that whatsoever account her majesty now maketh of Gowrie, his letters unto the Duke of Guise, sent by one Paul, which brought certain horses unto her son into Scotland, can declare that he will yield unto any thing \u2014 she marvelleth how her majesty dared trust him ;\" and said, \"that because the Earl Morton did not, in a particular controversy that was between him and Lord Oliphant, do what he would, he was the cause of his death. * * There fore,\" she said, \" there was no stability or trust in him.

It is certain, at least, that in his secret interview with the English ambas sador, James expressed himself with much suspicion 1 MS.

Thus, in pointing to the eighth article, which related to their being jointly associated in the government, he doubted, he said, that some prejudice might come to him, as well at home as otherwise ; since it seemed so worded, that she should not only be equal with him in authority and power, but also have the chief place before him : a matter dangerous to his state and title to this crown. Besides, he observed, sundry obstacles might be found in the person of his mother, which might annoy both him and her. She was a Papist ; she had a council resident in France, by whom she was directed ; she was so entangled with the pope, and others her confederates, that she could not deliver herself from suspicion. In honour she could not abandon her friends in France ; and as, in the person of Queen Mary, (alluding to Elizabeth's predecessor,) he said, it was found, and seen to the world, that her own mild nature could not suppress the great cruelty of her councillors, but that their desire prevailed to persecute and torment God's people ; to overthrow the whole state and government established by King Edward the Sixth ; * * so the Protestants and others in Endand, desirino- a peaceable government and estate, might both doubt to find the like effects in the person of his mother, and be affrayed to come under the rule of a woman thus qualified. These impediments and dangers, he added complacently, would not be found in his own condition, but rather an expectation of good parts or qualities promising better contentment and satisfaction. He"], [361, "1583. JAMES VI. 355 then, at Bowes' request, gave him the whole history of the correspondence between himself and the captive queen ; expressed the deepest gratitude to Elizabeth for this confidential communication ; and concluded by assuring him, that, as he was convinced Mary pre ferred herself before him in this proposal, till he saw much more clearly than he yet could, the bottom of the business, and her true meaning, he would go no farther without communicating with the English queen, and taking the advice of his council ; whose opinion he could not now have, on account of the solemn promise of secrecy to Elizabeth.1 It is evident, through the whole of this negotiation, that James, if he expressed his real feelings, had a single eye to his own interest ; and cared little what became of his unfortunate mother, provided he secured an undivided sceptre in Scotland, and his succession to the English crown on Elizabeth's death. One only thing may be suggested in his defence : It is just possible that, in all this he dissembled, with the object of blinding Elizabeth and Bowes to his purposes for the recovery of his liberty and the overthrow of the English faction. But of this, the result will enable us more truly to judge. In the beginning of May, Menainville, having fully organized the plot for the overthrow of the Ruthven lords and the return of the Duke of Lennox to power, took shipping from Leith for the court of France ; and so confidently did he express himself to his secret friends, that Bowes, who had a spy amongst them, told Walsingham he might look for a new world in August.2 1 MS.

At the same time, the Scottish ambassadors, Colonel Stewart and Mr John Colvile, accompanied by Mr David Lindsay, one of the ministers of Edinburgh, who went at James's special request, repaired to Lon don, where they were banqueted by Leicester, and soon admitted to an audience by Elizabeth. This princess was, as usual, profuse in her professions and advice to her young cousin the King of Scots, but exceed ingly parsimonious of her money.1 On the subject of his marriage, upon which he had solicited her advice, she promised to write herself ; but referred all other points to her council. It was urged by Colvile, in the strongest terms, that the king's person could not be deemed in safety, unless the Scottish guard were increased. By this he meant, in plain language, that James could not be kept in captivity without a larger body of hired soldiers to hold the opposite faction in check. In them, to use the words of the ambassadors, \" the life of the cause consisted.\" 2 And yet Eliza beth could scarcely be prevailed on to advance the paltry sum of three hundred pounds, which she insisted Bowes must pay upon his own credit : and \" if,\" said Walsingham, when he sent him her com mands in this matter, \" her Majesty should happen to lay the burden upon you, I will not fail to see you myself discharged of the same.\" 3 It had been one great purpose of Colonel Stewart, in this em bassy, to ascertain whether most could be gained by the proffered friendship of England or France.

Only two days after the Scottish ambassadors had left court on their return, Bowes wrote from Edin burgh to Walsingham, that the Earls of Huntley, Athole, Montrose, and other barons, had met at Falk land ; that their \" purpose to welter 1 the court and state \" was no secret ; and that nothing but a satisfac tory message from their royal mistress could save the English faction, and prevent a change of government.2 Yet all this did not alter the resolution of the English queen. It was in vain that the ambassadors remon strated with Walsingham ; that they reminded him of the promises made by the queen to the lords who had seized the king at Ruthven ; of the exhortations sent them, at the beginning of the action, to be constant ; of the assurances given to them of assistance both in men and money.3 Gowrie found himself cheated out of the sums he had spent upon the common cause : and perceiving the course which things must take, determined to make his peace with James on the first occasion. Bowes' advances to the English faction were discouraged ; and Walsingham bitterly com- 1 To welter ; to throw the government into a state of movement and disturbance. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Walsingham, May 31, 1583. 3 Ibid.

I pray God we perform the rest of things promised.\" x At this crisis, intelligence arrived of the death of the Duke of Lennox in France.2 He had been for some time in delicate health ; but the Scottish king had looked forward with confidence to his recovery, and his grief was extreme. His feelings became more poignant when he found the deep affection which his favourite had expressed towards himself on his death bed : enjoining his eldest son to carry his heart to his royal master in Scotland ; and dying, apparently, in the reformed faith. On the day of his death he addressed a letter to James, informing him that his recovery was hopeless ; and advising him to trust no longer to Angus, Mar, Lindsay, or Gowrie, whom he suspected were devoted to the English faction ; but to give his confidence to those whom he termed his own party. A blank, however, had been left for their names, and he expired before it was filled up.3 This event threw an obstacle in the way of the im mediate execution of that plot for his liberty, which the young king had been so long concerting, and from the success of which he had so fondly looked forward to the restoration of his favourite.4 Elizabeth seized 1 MS.

James observed to Bowes, that although, as a dutiful son, he was ready to exert himself to procure the com fort and liberty of his mother, he was neither bound to this scheme of an \" association,\" as she had asserted, nor would he ever consent to it in the form which she had proposed. The councillors were still more violently opposed to Mary on both points. \" The association,\" they said, \" had been proposed in Moray's regency, and absolutely rejected ; and they were confident it would meet the same fate now ; and for her liberty, if, under restraint, she could keep up so strong a faction, what would she do when free?\"1 This secret consultation between the English am bassador and the king took place at Falkland on the 24th June ; and so completely had James blinded Bowes, that he left court and returned to the capital, unsuspicious of any change. Next day, John Colvile, who, with Colonel Stewart, had just returned from England, assured Walsingham, \" that all things were quiet, and that the last work of God, in the duke's departure, had increased the friendly disposition of the king.\" 2 But the letters were still on their way to England when all these flattering hopes were over thrown, and the ambassador received the astounding intelligence, that the king had thrown himself into 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Walsingham, Edinburgh, June 29, 1583. - Ibid.

On the heels of this news came a horseman in fiery speed from Mar to Angus ; and this earl, the moment he heard of the movement, de spatched a courier by night with his ring to Bothwell, urging him to gather his borderers and join him instantly ; which he did. But the two barons were met, within six miles of St Andrews, by a herald, who charged them, on pain of treason, to disband their forces, and come forward singly. They obeyed, rode on, saw James, and received his orders to return home and remain at their houses till he called for them.1 A few days showed that this sudden, though blood less revolution, was complete. The king was his own master, and owed his freedom to the ability with which he had organized the plot and blinded his adversaries.2 Gowrie, Mar, and Angus, the three lords who had led the faction of England, and kept him in durance, were in despair ; but Gowrie, more politic than his asso ciates, had secured a pardon for himself some time before the crisis.3 His colleagues in the triumvirate fled ; and to crown all, Arran, who, there is every reason to believe, had been privy to the whole, after a brief interval returned to court, was embraced 1 MS.

But the insult had sunk deeper than was believed ; and it was soon evident that the king had determined to convince his people, that the person of the monarch and the laws of the land should neither be invaded nor broken with impunity. A proclamation was set forth,2 which characterized the enterprise at Ruthven as treason ; and whilst it assured his subjects, that all who ac knowledged their offence should experience the mercy of their prince, avowed his resolution to proceed vigorously against the impenitent and refractory. At the same time, he published a declaration \" of the good and pleasant death in the Lord\" of his late dear cousin the Duke of Lennox ; informing his subjects that this nobleman had departed in the profession of the true Christian faith established within his realm in the first year of his reign ; and denouncing penalties upon all who pretended ignorance of this fact, or dared to contradict it, in speaking or in writing, in prose or rhyme.3 This public vindication of the memory and faith of his favourite, was intended to silence the ministers of the Kirk, who had deemed it their duty to cast out 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Walsingham, August 5, 1583. 2 MS.

This harsh attack upon his favourite justly and deeply offended the king; and Lawson, the author of the calumny, having been commanded to appear at court, he, and a small company of his brother ministers, repaired to Dunfermline, and were conducted into the presence chamber. Here, owing to the recent changes, they found themselves surrounded with the strange faces of a new court. Soon after the king entered, and whilst they rose and made their obeisance, James, to their astonishment, took not the slightest notice, but passing the throne, which all expected he was to occupy, sat down familiarly upon a little coffer, and \" eyed them all marvellous gravely, and they him, for the space of a quarter of an hour ; none speaking a word ; to the admiration of all the beholders.\"2 The scene, intended to have been tragic and awful, was singularly comic : and this was increased when the monarch, without uttering a syllable, jumped up from his coffer, and \" glooming\" upon them, walked out of the room. It was now difficult to say what should be done. The ministers had come with a determina tion to remonstrate with their sovereign against the recent changes; and he, it was evident, enraged at their late conduct, had resolved to dismiss them un heard ; but, whilst they debated in perplexity, he re lented in the cabinet, to which he had retired, and called them in.

His wit was of a homely and peculiar character. James, he said, ought to hear him, if any ; for he had demisted the crown in his favour. Was he not Fer guson, the son of Fergus the first Scottish king ? and had he not cheerfully resigned his title to his grace, as he was an honest man and had possession? \" Well,\" said James, \" no other king in Europe would have borne at your hands what I have.\" \u2014 \" God forbid you should be like other European kings ! \" was the reply ; \" what are they but murderers of the saints ? \u2014 ye have had another sort of upbringing : but be ware whom ye choose to be about you ; for, helpless as ye were in your cradle, you are in deeper danger now.\" \u2014 \" I am a Catholic king,\" replied the monarch, \" and may choose my own advisers.\" The word Catholic was more than some of the ministers could digest, and would have led to an angry altercation, had not Ferguson again adroitly allayed their excited feelings. \" Yes, brethren,\" said he, turning to them, \" he is a catholic ; that is, a universal kiug ; and may choose his company as King David did, in the hun dred and first psalm.\" This was a master stroke ; for the king had very recently translated this psalm into English metre, and Ferguson took occasion to com mend his verses in the highest terms. They then"], [370, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1583. 364 again warned him against his present councillors ; and one of the ministers, stooping down, had the boldness to whisper in his ear, that there was no great wisdom in keeping his father's murderers, or their posterity, so near his person. Their last words were stern and solemn. \" Think not lightly, sir,\" said they, \" of our commission ; and look well that your deeds agree with your promises, for we must damn sin in whoever it be found ; nor is that face upon flesh that we may spare, in case we find rebellion to our God, whose ambassadors we are. Disregard not our threatening ; for there was never one yet in this realm, in the place where your grace is, who prospered after the minis ters began to threaten him.\" At this, the king was observed to smile, probably ironically, but he said nothing ; and, as they took their leave, he laid his hand familiarly on each. Colonel Stewart then made them drink, and they left the court.1 I have given this interview at some length, as it is strikingly cha racteristic both of the prince and the ministers of the Kirk. On receiving intelligence of the revolution in Scot land, Elizabeth wrote, in much alarm, to Bowes,2 and resolved to send an ambassador with her advice and remonstrance to the king. She hesitated, however, between Lord Hunsdon her cousin, and the now aged Walsingham ; and two months were suffered to pass before she could be brought to a decision. During this interval, all was vigour upon the part of the king and Arran, whilst despondency and suspicion paralyzed and divided their opponents.

Those officers of the king's household, who were sus pected of being favourable to England, were removed, to make way for others of the opposite party. It was observed that James had given a long secret conference to young Graham of Fintry, a devoted Catholic, lately come from France, with letters (as Bowes believed) from the Duke of Guise.3 It was even noted, that a present of apples and almonds had been sent from Menainville to the king ; a token con certed to show that all was ripe for the completion of the plot which he had devised when last in Scotland.4 In short, although the young king continued to make the fairest professions to Bowes, and addressed a letter to Elizabeth, in which he expressed the greatest devotion to her service, and the most anxious desire to preserve the amity between the two kingdoms, it was evident to this ambassador that all was false and dissembled.

He found himself treated with coldness. His audience was unnecessarily delayed ; and when at last admitted, the young king was in no compliant mood, although he received him with much apparent courtesy.3 To his complaints of the late changes, James replied, that he had every wish to maintain friendship with her majesty : but this he would now be better able to accomplish with a united than a divided nobility. Before this, two or three lords had usurped the government ; they had engaged in dangerous courses, and had brought their ruin upon themselves.

This secret conference, however, does not appear to have taken place. The probability is, that Arran, who carried himself towards Walsingham with great pride, had prevented it ; and, having bid adieu to the king, the English secretary wrote to Burghley in these ominous terms : \" You will easily find that there is no hope of the recovery of this young prince ; who, I doubt, (having many reasons to lead me so to judge,) if his power may agree to his will, will be- come a dangerous enemy. * * * There is no one thing will serve better to bridle him, than for her majesty to use the Hamiltons in such sort as they may be at her devotion.\"3 1 MS. letter, original draft, State-paper Office, Walsingham to Elizabeth, September 11, 1583. 2 Ibid.

By his advice, Bowes bribed some of the leading nobles ; and in less than a week after Walsingham's departure, his busy agent wrote to him, that the good course begun by him in that realm was prosperous ; that he had met with many of the persons appointed, who promised to do what was committed to them ; and that already the well-affected were in comfort, and their adver saries in fear.1 This new plot Walsingham communicated to Eliza beth in a letter which has unfortunately disappeared, but to which he thus alluded in writing to Burghley from Durham, on his journey back to the English court : \" There is an offer made to remove the ill affected from about the king, which I have sent to her majesty.

The \" Bye-course\" (the name given to the pro jected conspiracy) was thus abandoned ; and Elizabeth, who was dissatisfied with Walsingham's ill success, determined to reserve her judgment on the Scottish affairs, and recalled Bowes from Scotland.1 This coldness in the English queen completely dis couraged the opponents of the late revolution ; and before the end of the year, the king and Arran had triumphed over every difficulty. Angus, Mar, and Glammis, the Lairds of Lochleven and Cleish, the Abbots of Dunfermline and Cambuskenneth, with others who had acted in concert with Gowrie, were compelled to acknowledge their offences and sue for mercy; whilst a convention was held at Edinburgh, in which the good sense and moderation of the king were conspicuous, in restoring something of confidence and peace even to the troubled elements of the Kirk.2 Considering the difficulty of this task, it gives us no mean idea of James's powers at this early age, when we find him succeeding in taming the fiery and almost indomitable spirits of one party of the ministers, and reconciling to his present policy the more placable division of the Presbyterians. The great subject of contention between the court and the Scottish clergy was the outrage committed at Ruthven ; a transaction which had received the solemn sanction of the Kirk, but which the prince, however compelled to disguise his sentiments at the time, justly considered rebellion.

Angus retired beyond the Spey ; the Earl of Mar, the Master of Glammis, with the Abbots of Dryburgh and Cambuskenneth, repaired to Ireland ; Lord Boyd, with the Lairds of Lochleven and Easter Wemyss, passed into France; and other of their associates were imprisoned, or warded within the strictest bounds.

But Durie was compelled, by threats of having his head set upon the West Port, one of the public gates of the city, to make a qualified retraction ; x and Melvil only saved himself from im prisonment by a precipitate flight to Berwick.2 This man, whose temper was violent, and who was a strict Puritan in religion and a Republican in politics, when called before the council, resolutely declined their jurisdiction; affirming that he was amenable only to the presbytery for any thing delivered in the pulpit ; and when the king attempted to convince him of the contrary, he arrogantly told him, that \" he perverted the laws botli of God and man.\" The removal of so stern an opponent was peculiarly grateful to the court ; and as James had assured the commissioners of the Kirk, that he was determined to maintain the reformed religion, and to lay before his council the remedies they recommended for restoring tranquillity to the country, it was anxiously hoped that the dis tracted and bleeding state might be suffered to enjoy some little interval of repose.3 During these transactions, the young Duke of Len nox, having left the French court, arrived in Scotland. He was accompanied by the Master of Gray, a person destined to act a conspicuous part in future years, and whom the king had expressly sent on this mission. On coming ashore, at Leith, they were met by Arran and Huntley, and carried to Kinneil, where the court 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Walsingham, Dec. 29,1583.

James received the son of his old favourite with the utmost joy; restored him to his father's honours and estates ; and as he was then only thir teen, committed him to the government of the Earl of Montrose.1 It was now expected that a period of order and quiet would succeed the banishment of the disaffected lords ; for although the counsels of Arran were violent, there was a wiser and more moderate party in the king's confidence, which checked, for a little while, his rash ness and lust of undivided power. To this class be longed the celebrated Sir James Melvil, with his brother Sir Robert, and some of the more temperate spirits in the Kirk. One of these, Mr David Lindsay, accounted amongst the best of the brethren, addressed a letter at this time to Bowes, the late ambassador, in which he spoke in high terms of the young king. He advised Bowes to write to James ; informed him that advice from him was sure to be well received ; and added, that his royal master had recently, in private, assured him, that Secretary Walsingham was the wisest man he had ever spoken with ; that the more he had pondered on the counsels he had given him, in their late meeting, the better and more pro fitable they appeared. \" I perceive,\" said he to Bowes, \"his majesty begins to take better tent [heed] to his own estate and weal nor [than] he has done ' MS. letter, State-paper Office, Bowes to Walsingham, November 16, 1583.

The chief conspirators were the ban ished noblemen, Angus, Mar, the Master of Glammis, the Earl of Bothwell, Lord Lindsay, and their asso ciates. Of these, Mar and Glammis passed over secretly from their retreat in Ireland ; Angus left his refuge in the north ; the two sons of the Duke of Chastelherault, Lord Claud and Lord John Hamilton, were sent down by Elizabeth from England to the borders ; whilst Gowrie, who, to cover his purposes of treason, had sought and obtained the king's license to visit the continent, lingered in Scotland to arrange the plan of the insurrection.2 In England, the great agent, in 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Mr David Lindsay to Mr Bowes, Leith, November 2, 1583.

Gowrie, as it appears, had hesitated for some time between submitting to the king and embarking in the plot ; but Bowes wrote to Walsingham, on the 4th March, 1583-4, that he had abandoned all thoughts of con cession, and stood faithful to his friends. He added, that the ground and manner of the purpose was known to very few, as it was thought requisite to keep it secret till the time of the execution approached. Some delay, however, took place regarding the course to be pursued with a certain bishop, who was considered too powerful an antagonist to be continued in power ; and Colvile, who managed the plot in London, had a secret meeting with Walsingham on this delicate point ; after which, he wrote to him in these words : \" Concerning the bishop, the more I think of the matter, the more necessity I think it, that he, and all other strangers of his opinion, were removed ; for it is a common pro verb, Hostes si intus sint, frustra clauduntur fores ; neque antequam expellantur Me cubandum est.\"1 But although Bowes, Walsingham, and Colvile, were no mean adepts in planning an insurrection, they had to compete with an antagonist in Arran, who detected and defeated all their machinations.

He was aware that a band had been drawn up, and signed by many of his enemies in Scotland, by which they solemnly engaged to assassinate him, and compelled the king to admit them to his councils.1 He had received information that, in the end of March, a general assembly of the nobles, who trusted to overturn the government, would be held at Perth. But he awaited their operations with indifference ; for he knew that the Earls of Glencairn and Athole, upon whom Gowrie, Angus, and Mar, principally depended, were traitors to their own friends, and had already revealed every thing to him. When the meeting accordingly did take place, and the insurgent noblemen called upon all who were solicitous for the advancement of the Word of God, and the setting forth of his glory, to join their banner, their appeal found no response in the hearts of the people, and the assembly fell to pieces without striking a blow.2 This premature movement, and its ill success, inti midated the conspirators, and gave new courage to Arran and the king, who sent a secret messenger to Elizabeth, offering the most favourable terms of ac commodation, and assuring her, that in supporting Gowrie and his friends, she was the dupe of some dangerous and unquiet spirits, whose purposes varied every month, and who were not even true to each other.3 The queen hesitated.

These he was to correct and present to Elizabeth. But this princess was in a dilemma. If she signed the articles, she bound herself to the fac tion ; and should they be discomfited, she furnished evidence of her encouraging rebellion in subjects ; an accusation which Arran and his friends would not be slow to use. On the other hand, Colvile maintained that the late failure at Perth was to be ascribed to the folly and impatience of some of their friends; and that now all was ready for the outbreak and success of the great plot. Gowrie was at Dundee, waiting only for the signal from his fellow-conspira tors. Angus, Mar, and Glammis, wTere ready to rise and march upon Stirling.

At this crisis, this busy partisan, Colvile, exerted himself to the utmost. He found that the English queen, whilst she verbally gave her warm approval to the insurgents, \" expressing her gracious and motherly care of the well-doing of the noblemen,\" steadily refused either to sign their articles, or to receive any messenger from them, till they were openly in arms.

Arran, who was informed of every particular, had quietly suffered the plot to proceed to the very instant of its execution. Having secretly instructed his own friends to be ready with their forces at an instant's warning, he did not move a step till his adversaries were in the field, and, by an overt act, had fixed upon themselves the crime of rebellion. The moment this was ascer tained, and wdien he knew that Gowrie only waited at Dundee for a signal to join his friends, who were advancing upon Stirling, he despatched Colonel Stewart to arrest him ; who, with a hundred troopers, coming suddenly to that town before sunrise, surrounded his castle. It was difficult, however, in these times of feudal misrule and hourly danger to find a Scottish baron unprepared ; and the earl bravely held his house against all assailants for twelve hours. But he was at last overpowered, seized, and carried a prisoner to Edinburgh.1 At the same moment that these scenes were acting at Dundee, word had been brought to the court, that the Earls of Mar and Angus, with the Master of Glammis, and five hundred horse, had entered Stirling, and possessed themselves of the castle ; and when Stewart entered Edinburgh with his captive, he found it bristling with arms and war like preparations ; the drums beating, and the young king, in a high state of excitement, assembling his forces, hurrying forward his levies, and declaring that he would instantly proceed in person against them.2 1 MS. letter, Caligula, C. viii. sol. 9, Bowes to Walsingham, Ber wick, April 19, 1584. 2 MS. letter, British Museum, Caligula, C. viii. sol. 13, Bowes to"], [385, "JAMES VI. 1584. 379 So soon were the musters completed, that within two days an army of twelve thousand men were in the field ; and James, surrounded by his nobles, led them on to Stirling.

They afterwards, with Polwart subdean of Glasgow, John Davison minister of Libberton, and the noted Andrew Melvil, fled to England. 2 In the mean time, it was determined to bring Gowrie to trial. Of his guilt, there was not the slightest doubt. He had been a chief contriver of the plot, and the most active agent in its organization : but there was some want of direct evidence ; and a base device, though common in the criminal proceedings of these times, was adopted to supply it. The Earl of Arran, attended by Sir Robert Melvil, and some others of the privy councillors, whose names do not appear, visited him in prison ; and professing great concern for his safety, informed him that the king was deeply incensed against him, believing that he had the chief hand in expelling his favourite, the Duke of Lennox. Gowrie declared, that his part in the disgrace of the duke was not deeper than that of his associates ; but anxiously besought them, as old friends, to sue to the king for a favourable sentence. They replied, that to become intercessors for him in the present state of James's feelings, would only ruin themselves, and not serve him. \" What, then,\" said he, \" is to be done?\" \u2014 \" Our advice,\" said they, \"is, that you write a general letter to the king, confessing your knowledge of a design against his majesty's per- son, and offering to reveal the particulars, if admitted to an audience. This will procure you an interview, which otherwise you have no chance of obtaining. You may then vindicate your innocence, and explain the whole to the king.\" \" It is a perilous expedient,\" answered Gowrie. \"I never entertained a thought 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Moyse's Memoirs, p. 50.

You must remember it all,\" said he, looking at Arran and turning to the lords who had accompanied him to the prison, \" how at first I refused ; how earnestly I asserted my innocence ; how you sware to me, upon your honour and faith, that the king granted me my life, if I made this confession.\" The lord advocate replied, that the lords had no power to make such a promise ; and when the prisoner, with the energy of a man struggling between life and 1 Dittay ; accusation. 3 MS.

He sent, also, by one of them, a pathetic message to his wife ; begging him to conceal his fate from her, as she was just delivered of her child, and the news, if heard suddenly, might be fatal to her. At this moment the jury returned and declared him guilty, a sentence which he received with much firmness ; then instantly rising to speak, the judge interrupted him, telling him that his time was short, as the king had already sent down the warrant for his execution. \" Well, my lord,\" said he, \" since it is the king's con tentment that I lose my life, I am as willing to part with it as I was before to spend it in his service ; and the noblemen, who have been upon my jury, will know the matter better hereafter.

The justice-clerk then assisted him to undo his doublet, and bare his neck ; Gowrie himself tied the handkerchief over his eyes, and kneel ing down, \" smilingly,\" as it was remarked by an eye-witness, rested his head upon the block.

His early age Avas stained with the blood of the unfortunate Riccio ; he and his father being two of the principal assassins.

All this makes me suspect that Melvil only accom panied Arran, and did not assist him in entrapping Gowrie.

Since that time, his life had been one continued career of public faction ; his character was stained by a keen appetite for private revenge ; x and although all must reprobate the base contrivances resorted to, to procure evidence against him on his trial, it is certain that, in common with Mar, Angus, and Glammis, he had engaged in a conspiracy to over- turn the government.2 It is singular to find, that a man thus marked so deeply with the features of a cruel age, should have combined with these considerable cultivation and refinement. He was a scholar, fond of the fine arts, a patron of music and architecture, and affected magnificence in his personal habits and mode of living.

He combined military experience, and the promptitude and decision which a soldier of fortune so often acquires, with a genius for state affairs, and a ready eloquence, in which all could see the traces of a learned education. To this was added a noble presence and figure, with commanding manners, which awed or conciliated as he pleased those whom he employed as the tools of his greatness.

For their truth, she and her councillors had no guarantee : and looking to the profligacy of his private life, his bitter opposition to the Presbyterian clergy, and his constant craving after forfeitures and power, they conjectured that his alleged devotion to England, and desire to continue the amity, was rather a contrivance to gain time till he looked about him, than any more perma nent principle of action. All this was embarrassing to the English queen and her ministers : and there were other difficulties in the way of their recovery of influence in Scotland, to which it was impossible to shut their eyes. They had trusted that the late conspiracy7, if successful, would restore Lord Arbroath and Lord Claud Hamil ton to their ancient authority and estates ; and that their union with the Earl of Angus, who wielded the immense power of the house of Douglas, would enable them to crush Arran, and destroy the French faction in Scotland. But Arran was now triumphant ; and his enmity to the houses of Douglas and Hamilton was deep and deadly. Their restoration, he well knew, must have been his utter ruin. He had brought the Regent Morton to the scaffold ; he had possessed himself of the title and estates of the unfortunate Earl of Arran ; and as long as he continued in power, Elizabeth foresaw that the exiles would never be permitted to return. She had difficulties, also, with the faction of the Kirk. They had hitherto been encouraged by England ; and had been employed, by Burghley and Walsingham, as powerful opponents of the French faction and the intrigues of the queen-"], [393, "1584. JAMES VI. 387 mother. But Elizabeth had herself no sympathies for the Presbyterian form of church government : she had often blamed the factious and Republican princi ples disseminated by its ministers; and now, when the party of the Kirk were no longer dominant, she felt disposed to regard them with coldness and dis trust.1 On the other hand, the young king had avowed his determined enmity to Rome ; whilst his opposi tion was simply to Presbytery as contrasted with Episcopacy. He had formed a resolution to maintain, at all risks, against the attacks of its enemies, the Episcopal form of government which had been estab lished in Scotland. He was assisted in this great design by Arran, a man not easily shaken in his pur poses ; and by Adamson archbishop of St. Andrews, whose abilities were of a high order, both as a divine and a scholar : and now that Gowrie was gone, and the other great leaders of the Kirk in exile, there was every probability that James would succeed in his object. It became, therefore, a question with Eliza beth, whether she might not gain more by encouraging the advances of Arran, than she would lose by with drawing her support from the exiled lords. Such being her feelings, she resolved to be in no hurry to commit herself till she had sent a minister to Scotland, who should carefully examine the exact state of parties in that country. When the conspiracy broke out, Mr. Davison had been on his road thither ; but he was arrested on his journey, at Berwick, by letters from Walsingham : 2 and when the French ambassador, who was resident at the English court, requested the queen's permission to repair to Scotland 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Walsingham to Davison, June 17, 1584. s Ibid.

He had declared his earnest desire to see the three crowns united in perfect amity, and his wishes that the afflicted state of Scotland should be restored to quiet ; whilst he had instructed his am bassador to visit the captive Queen of Scots, to exert himself to the utmost to mitigate the rigour of her confinement, and, if possible, to procure her restoration to liberty.2 In the mean time, Arran and the king, although they professed a firm resolution to maintain pacific relations with England, adopted energetic measures to secure their triumph and complete the ruin of their enemies. A parliament was held at Edinburgh,3 in which Angus, Mar, Glammis, and their numerous adherents, were declared guilty of treason, and their estates forfeited to the crown ; whilst some laws were passed, which carried dismay into the hearts of the Presbyterian clergy, and amounted, as Davison de clared to Walsingham, to the supplanting and over throw of the government of the Kirk. The authority of the king was declared supreme in all causes, and over all persons. It was made treason to decline his judgment, and that of his council, in any matter whatsoever; the jurisdiction of any court, spiritual or temporal, which was not sanctioned by his highness and the three estates, was discharged ; and no persons, 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Walsingham to Davison, May 4, 1584.

Having satisfied their conscience, and warned their flock against obedience, they deemed it proper to provide for their own safety ; and fled in the night, followed hard by some of the king's guard, who had orders to arrest them. They escaped, however, and entered Berwick by daybreak.1 Elizabeth now ordered Davison to proceed to Scotland ; and the young king despatched the cele brated Sir James Melvil, who was then much in his confidence, to meet him on the borders. Melvil's commission was to sound the ambassador's mind before he received audience ; and after their meeting he despatched a letter to his brother, Sir Robert Melvil, in which he gave a minute and graphic account of their conversation, as they rode together towards the court. Davison he described as all smiles and gentleness, full of thanks for the noble train which had met him on the marches, and earnest in his hopes that he might prove a more happy in strument of amity than his diplomatic predecessors, Randolph and Bowes. Sir James's reply was politely worded, but significant and severe. He had little doubt, he said, that the intentions of the Queen of England were sincere ; her offers assuredly w7ere fair, and the rebellion of subjects against their prince could not but be hateful to her ; and yet the proceed ings of her councillors and ministers appeared far otherwise to clear-sighted men.

JAMES VI. 391 and acute enough to look more to deeds than words. It is the custom (continued Melvil) of some countries to hold their neighbours in civil discord, and send ambassadors to and fro to kindle the fire under colour of concord. No words could more plainly point out the recent proceedings of Elizabeth ; but Sir James was too much of a courtier not to avoid the direct application. He utterly disclaimed having that opinion of her majesty, or of the ambassador himself, that many had of some counsellors and ambassadors ; but he assured him, unless her majesty proceeded otherwise with the king than she had done yet, matters were able1 [likely] to fall out to her unmendable miscontentment. I would not speak of auld2 done deeds, said he, pursuing the attack ; but now lately, when Mr Walsingham was sent, his majesty was in good hope of a strait amity to be packed in respect of his own earnest inclination and the quality of him that was sent, and could find nothing but an appearance of changement of mind in him, either upon some new occasion, or by the persuasion of some other party; and, nevertheless, his majesty dealt favourably and familiarly with him, and showed favour unto sundry that were suspected, at his request, and kept straitly some speeches that were between them ; albeit afterwards Mr Bowes alleged the contrary, in such sort that sundry thought it were done to pick a quarrel. And whereas, (con tinued Melvil, alluding to the late conspiracy of Gowrie,) his majesty was mercifully inclined to all his subjects, \u2014 both they with some of England, and some of England with them had practised, whereof 1 \"Able\" is the word in the original.

What is this but mockery ? 2 This was a home-thrust, which Davison, who knew its truth, could not easily parry ; nor was he more comfortable when Sir James alluded to the conduct of the Kirk, and the state of religion. Lord Burghley himself, said Melvil, when in Scotland at the time of the siege of Leith, had been scandalized at the pro ceedings of the ministers, and gave plain counsel to put order to them, or else they would subvert the whole estate'; and yet now, said he, they are again crying out against the king's highness, whose life and conversation is better reformed and more godly than their own. He then detailed to him more particu larly, as they rode along, the \" slanderous practices of some of these busy factioners ;\" and ended with this advice: \"Mr. Ambassador, \u2014 if the queen require friendship, she must like the king's friends ; she must hate his enemies ; and either deliver them into his hands, or chase them forth of her country, as she did at his majesty's mother's desire after the slaughter of Davie.

JAMES VI. 393 The two friends, by this time, had reached Melvil's country seat, from which they rode to the court at Falkland, and Davison was admitted to his audience. He found the young Duke of Lennox, and the Earls of Arran, Huntley, Montrose, and other nobles, around the king, who received his letters with courtesy, but expressed himself in passionate terms against the re bellious nobles, whom, he said, he expected Elizabeth to deliver into his hands. To this Davison replied, that no one could be more tender of his estate and preservation than his mistress. As to the noblemen whom he termed rebels, she was as yet utterly ignorant of the true circumstances of the late alteration, (by this mild term she alluded to Gowrie's treason ;) but she had always regarded these nobles as men who had hazarded their lives in his service ; nor could she now deliver them, without blemish to her honour. Did his majesty forget, that he had himself blamed Morton for the delivery of Northumberland in his minority ; and had recently refused to give up Holt the Jesuit, who had been concealed in Scotland, and was a no torious intriguer against her majesty's government? Besides, she had good cause of offence from the late conduct of Livingston, his servant, whom he had sent up to require the delivery of Angus and his friends. This man had spread reports injurious to her honour: he had asserted that Gowrie had written a letter in prison, accusing Elizabeth of a plot against the life both of Mary and the young king. The whole was a foul and false slander ; and she knew well the strata gems which had been used to procure such a letter ; but she did, indeed, think it strange that the king himself should credit such stories of one whose life and government had been as innocent and unspotted as hers, and who had shown such care of himself, and"], [400, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1584. 394 sisterly affection to his mother.1 For the banished noblemen, she should take good care they should create no trouble to his kingdom. To all this James answered, with a spirit and readi ness for which Davison was not prepared, that for this last assurance there was not much necessity. He could look, he hoped, well enough himself to the defence of his kingdom against such rebels as she now thought good to protect. The case of Holt, he said, was not parallel. He was a mean and single subject : they were noblemen of great houses and alliance. For Gowrie's letter, it was true such a letter had been written ; but its terms were so general, as to touch neither her majesty, nor any other persons in particular : nor was the accusation ever substantiated by proof. Her majesty's honour, therefore, was un blemished. James then turned to lighter subjects, talked of his hunting and pastimes, and handed the ambassador over to Montrose, with whom he dined.2 A few days' observation convinced Davison that James felt as deeply as he had expressed himself; and that, although Arran's power was great, the king's inclinations seconded, if they did not originate, all those severe measures which were now adopted against the banished nobles and the ministers. Nothing was heard of, from day to day, but prosecutions, arrests, forfeitures, and imprisonments ; whilst Arran, and the nobles and barons who had joined his party, exultingly divided the spoil. The immense estates of the family of Douglas were eagerly sought after ; and Davison, in a letter to Walsingham, conveyed a striking picture of the general scramble, \" with the misery and confu sion of the country.

The association, concluded already, or on the point of being concluded, between them, by which Mary was to resign the kingdom to her son ; the late revolution at St. Andrews ; the execution, exile, or imprisonment of such as had been constant in religion ; the altera tion of the Protestant magistracy in the burghs ; the reception of English Jesuits into Scotland ; the nego tiations of the Scottish nobles now in power with the Bishops of Glasgow and Ross, Mary's ambassadors and instruments at the courts of France and Spain ; the frequent intelligence between the young king and his mother ; his speeches in her favour, and his im patience of hearing any thing in her dispraise : all were so many facts, to which the most cursory observer could scarcely shut his eyes ; and which, to use Davison's words to Walsingham, clearly demon strated that the Scottish queen, though elsewhere in person, sat at the stern of the government, and guided both king and nobles as she pleased.2 This was an alarming state of things to Elizabeth. The king was now grown up : his marriage could not be long delayed. If, by his mother's influence, it took place with a daughter of France ; if. to the intrigues of the Spanish faction of the Roman Catholics in her own realm, were to be added the 1 MS. letter State-paper Office, Davison to Wralsingham, June 10, 1584. a Ibid.

A conspiracy against her person was at this moment organizing in England, for which Francis Throckmorton was afterwards executed.1 Of its true character it is difficult to form an opinion ; but whether a real or a counterfeit plot, it was enough to alarm the country7. It seems certain, that many Jesuits and seminary priests were busy in in both kingdoms, exciting the people to rebellion. Slanderous libels, and treatises on tyrannicide, were printed and scattered about by those who considered the Queen of England a usurper and a heretic : her enemies looked to the Queen of Scots as the bulwark of the true faith in England ; and Mary, impatient under her long captivity, naturally and justifiably felt disposed to encourage every scheme which promised her liberty and rest. At this moment, when all was so gloomy, the faction in Scotland by whose assis tance Elizabeth had hitherto kept her opponents in check, had been suddenly overwhelmed, its leaders executed, or driven into banishment, and a govern ment set up, the first acts of which had exhibited a complete devotedness to the friends and the interests of Mary. The English queen was, therefore, compelled, by the imminency of the danger, to put the question, How was this crisis to be met ? Having consulted Davison, she found that any attempt at direct medi ation in the favour of the banished lords, would, in the present temper of the young king, be unsuccess ful ; and to use open force to create a counter-revo- 1 Carte, vol. iii. p. 586."], [405, "1584. JAMES VI. 399 lution, and restore the Protestant ascendency, was a path full of peril.1 Setting both these aside, however, there were still three ways which presented them selves to revive her influence, and check the headlong violence by which things were running into confusion and hostility to England. One was to secure the services of Arran, who possessed the greatest in fluence over James. He had secretly offered himself to Elizabeth, declared his constancy in religion as it was professed in England, and his conviction, that to preserve the amity with that realm was the best policy for his sovereign. He undertook, if the English queen followed his counsel, to keep the young king his master unmarried for three years ; and he requested her to send down to the border, some nobleman of rank in whom she placed confi dence, whom he would meet there, and to whom, in a private conference, he would propose such mea sures as should be for the lasting benefit of both countries. A second method, directly contrary to this, was to support the banished lords, Angus, Mar, and Glammis, with money and troops ; to employ them to overwhelm Arran, and compel the king to restore the reformed faction, and the exiled ministers of the Kirk. A third scheme presented itself, in the offers which the captive queen herself had made at this moment to Elizabeth. She was now old, she said ; ambition had no charms for her ; she was too much broken in health and spirits, by her long imprisonment, to meddle with affairs of state. All that she now wished, was to be restored to liberty, and permitted to live in retirement, either in England or in her own country. She could not prevent her 1 MS. Letter, State-paper Office, Davison to Burghley, June 23, 1584."], [406, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1584. 400 friends, and the great body of the Roman Catholics in Europe, from connecting her name with their efforts for the restoration of the true faith; from soliciting her approval, and organizing plans for her deliverance. All this resulted from her having been so long detained a captive against the most common principles of law and justice ; but if the queen would adopt a more generous system, and restore her to liberty, she was ready, she said, to make Elizabeth a party to the association, which was now nearly completed, with her son ; to resign the government into the hands of the young king ; to use her whole influence in reconciling him to the exiled lords; to promote, by every method in her power, the amity with England ; and not only to discourage the in trigues of the Roman Catholics against the govern meut of her good sister, but to put her in possession of many secret particulars, known only to herself, by which she should be enabled to traverse the schemes of her enemies, and restore security to her person and government. All these three methods presented themselves to Elizabeth, and all had their difficulties. If she ac cepted Arran s offer, it could hardly7 be done, except after the old fashion, which she so much disliked, of pensioning himself and his friends, outbidding France, and setting her face against his mortal enemies, the Douglases and the Hamiltons, whose return must be his ruin. If she sent back the exiled lords, it equally involved her in expense, and pledged her to the support of the Kirk; to whose Presbyterian form of govern ment, and high claims of infallibility and independence, she bore no favour. If she embraced Mary's proposals, \u2014 her safest, because her justest and most generous course, \u2014 she acted in hostility to the advice of Burgh-"], [407, "JAMES VI. 1584. 401 ley and Walsingham, who were deemed her wisest councillors ; and who had declared, in the strongest possible terms, that the freedom of the Scottish queen was inconsistent with the life of their royal mistress, or the continuance of the Protestant opinions in England. Having weighed these difficulties, Elizabeth held a conference with her confidential ministers, Lord Burghley7 and Walsingham. Although of one mind as to the rejection of the offers of Mary, they, contrary to what had hitherto taken place, differed in opinion on the two alternatives which remained. Burghley advised her to gain Arran, to send a minister to hold a secret conference with him on the borders,1 and, through his influence, to manage the young king. Walsingham, on the other hand, warmly pleaded for the banished lords. No trust, he affirmed, could be put in Arran ; and as long as he ruled all, there would be no peace for England : but at this instant, so great was the unpopularity of the young king and this proud minister, that if her majesty sent home the banished lords, with some support in money and sol diers, they would soon expel him from his high ground, and restore English ascendencv at the Scottish court. Having considered these opinions, Elizabeth decided that she would exclusively follow neither, but adopt a plan of her own. It was marked by that craft and dissimulation which, in those days of crooked and narrow policy, were mistaken for wisdom. To all the three parties who had offered themselves, hopes were held out, Arran was flattered, his proposals accepted; and Lord Hunsdon, the cousin of the English queen, directed to meet him in a conference on the borders.2 At the same moment, a negotiation, which had been 1 MS. State-paper Office, Instructions to Lord Hunsdon, June 30, 1584. 2 Ibid. 2 Ibid. VOL. VI. 2 C"], [408, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1584. 402 opened a short while before with the Queen of Scots, was renewed : she was once more deluded with the dream of liberty, and encouraged to use her influence with her son, and persuade him to more charitable feelings towards England and the exiled lords ; 1 and, lastly, these noblemen, and the banished ministers of the Kirk, were fed with hopes, that the queen would restore them to their country ; strengthen them with money and arms, and gratefully accept their service to overwhelm both Arran and the Scottish queen.2 In this way Elizabeth persuaded herself that she could hold in her hand, and ingeniously play against each other, the main strings which moved the principal puppets of the drama. If Arran proved true to his promises, as Burghley anticipated, she could easily cast off the banished lords : if false, as Walsingham judged likely7, they were ready, at her beck, to rise and overwhelm him ; whilst, from the captive queen, whose restoration to liberty was never seriously con templated, she expected to gain such disclosures as should enable her to traverse the constant intrigues of her enemies. It is to be remembered, that all these three modes of policy were carried on at one and the same time ; and it is consequently difficult to bring the picture clearly, or without confusion, before the eye ; but it must be attempted. Elizabeth, in the beginning of July, informed James that she had accepted his offers, and had appointed Lord Hunsdon to hold a conference with Arran on the 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, 10th May, 1584, Walsingham to Davison.

For all this Walsingham sent special instructions : and whilst his secret agents were busy in Scotland, Colvile had private meetings with Elizabeth, and laboured to gain the Hamiltons to join the exiled noblemen. It was hoped, in this way, that the foundation of a movement would be laid, by which, if Arran played false, a result which both Elizabeth and Walsingham expected, the banished nobles should break into Scotland, seize or assassinate the Scottish earl, get possession of the person of the king, and put an end to the French faction in that country. This, as will be seen in the sequel, actually took place, though the course of events interrupted and delayed the outbreak.2 It was now time for the appointed conference ; and on the 14th of August, the Earl of Arran and Lord Hunsdon met at Foulden Kirk ; a place on the bor ders, not far from Berwick. It was one object of the Scottish lord to impress the English with a high idea of his power ; and the state with which he came was that of a sovereign rather than a subject. His retinue amounted to five thousand horse, and he was attended by five members of the privy council, who, whilst Hunsdon and he alone entered the church, waited obsequiously without in the churchyard.

There was a frankness about his communications which impressed the English lord with a conviction of their truth ; and Hoby, who knew Elizabeth's love of hand some men, sent a minute portrait of him to Burghley, recommending him to the favour of his royal mistress. \"For the man,\" said he, \"surely he carrieth a princely presence and gait, goodly of personage, representing a brave countenance of a captain of middle age, very resolute, very wise and learned, and one of the best spoken men that ever I heard : a man worthy the queen's favour, if it please her.\" 2 But to return to the conference. Hunsdon, on his side, following the instructions of Elizabeth, complained of the recent unkind conduct of James in seeking an alliance with France, and encouraging the enemies of England. It was well known, he said, to his royal mistress, that this young prince, instead of fulfilling his promises to her to whom he owed so much, was practising against her. His harbouring of Jesuits; his banishment of the noblemen best affected to Eng- 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Hunsdon to Burghley, August 14, 1584. Ibid.

She now trusted that Arran would act up to his protestations ; and employ his influence with the king his master, for the restoration of amity be tween the two crowns, and the return of the exiled nobility. In his reply to this, Arran did not affect to conceal the intrigues of France and Spain to gain the young king; but he assured Hunsdon that all his influence should be exerted to counteract their success, and pro mote the amity with England. As to Elizabeth's complaints, some he admitted to be true, some he denied, others he exculpated. His master, he said, had never dealt with any Jesuits, and knew of none in his dominions : the Scottish king had no intentions of carrying forward \"the association\" with his mother ; nor had he any secret intrigues with the pope. Arran admitted James's severity to some of the English ambassadors ; but had it not been for the reverence borne to their mistress, they would have been used with harder measure : for James had Mr. Randolph's own hand to prove him a stirrer up of sedition ; and it was Mr. Bowes, her majesty's ambassador, who was the principal plotter of the seizure of the king's person at Ruthven, and the recent rebellious enterprise at Stirling. As for the banished lords, it was strange, indeed, to find her majesty an intercessor for men who had cast off their allegiance, and taken arms against their natural prince ; and whose proceedings had been so outrageous, that neither the king, nor he himself,"], [412, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 406 1584. could entertain the idea of their return for a moment. Angus, Mar, and their companions, had never ceased to plot against the government. Let Hunsdon look back to the course of the last two years. With what shameful ingratitude had Angus treated the king his master, in the business of the Earl of Morton, in the affair of the raid of Ruthven, when they seized and imprisoned him, (Arran,) and threatened the king they would send him his head in a dish, if he did not instantly banish Lennox ! Hunsdon pleaded against this the king's own letter to Elizabeth, which showed that he was pleased with the change. Arran smiled and said, it was easy to extort such a letter from a prince they had in their hands. Hunsdon replied, that James ought to have secretly sought advice from Bowes the English ambassador. Bowes ! retorted Arran : Bowes, as the king well knew, was at the bottom of the whole conspiracy for his apprehension. And then, look to the dealings of the same lords in the last affair, which cost Gowrie his head. With what craft did they seduce the ministers ; plotting my death, and the king's second apprehension, had it not been hap pily detected and defeated. Nay, said he, getting warmer as he proceeded, what will your lordship think, if I tell you, that at this moment the men you are pleading for as penitent exiles, are as active and cruel-minded in their captivity as ever; and that, at this instant, I have in my hands the certain proofs of a plot now going forward, to seize the king, to assassinate myself, to procure by treachery the castle of Edin burgh, and to overturn the government ? x 'Tis but a few days since all this has been discovered ; and can 1 MS.

JAMES VI. 407 your lordship advise your mistress to intercede for such traitors ? This was too powerful an appeal to be resisted; and Hunsdon, changing the subject, spoke of the con spiracies against Elizabeth. Adverting to Throck morton's recent treason, he declared that his mistress the queen well knew that, at this moment, there were practices carrying on in the heart of her kingdom for the disturbance of her government. She knew, also, that the King of Scots and his mother were privy7 to these ; nay, she knew that it was intended he should be a principal actor therein. Let him disclose them all fully and frankly, and he should find that the Eng lish queen knew how to be grateful. To this, Arran promptly answered, that nothing should be hid from Elizabeth, and no effort omitted by the king or him self to satisfy her majesty on this point. He then showed Hunsdon his commission under the great seal, giving him the broadest and most unlimited powers ; and the conference, which had lasted for five hours, was brought to an end.1 On coming out of the church, both Hunsdon and he appeared in the highest spirits and good humour. It was evident to the lords, who had waited without, that their solitary communica tions had been of an agreeable nature ; and the Scot tish earl seemed resolved that his own people should remark it ; for, turning to the lords about him, he said aloud, \" Is it not strange to see two men, accounted so violent and furious as we two are, agree so well together, \u2014 I hope, to the contentment of both crowns and their peace?\"2 At this moment, Hunsdon and 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Hunsdon to Walsingham, August 14, 1584 ; ibid, same date, Hunsdon to Burghley. 3 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Sir Edward Hoby to Dr. Parry, August 15, 1584."], [414, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1584. 408 Arran were reckoned the proudest and most passion ate noblemen in their two countries ; but for this excessive cordiality there were secret reasons, if we may believe an insinuation of Walsingham's to Davi son. Hunsdon and Lord Burghley had a little plot of their own to secure the favour of the young King of Scots, by gaining Arran, and bringing about a marriage between James and a niece of the English earl ; who, as cousin to Elizabeth, considered his kin as of royal blood.1 On this point, Walsingham felt so bitterly, that he accused his old friends of worship ping the rising sun ; and observed, that her majesty had need now to make much of faithful servants.2 On coming out of the church, Arran called for the Master of Gray, a young nobleman of his suite, and introduced him to Hunsdon. It was impossible not to be struck with the handsome countenance and graceful manners of this youth. He had spent some time at the court of France ; and, having been bred up in the Roman Catholic faith, had been courted by the house of Guise, and employed by them as a confidential en voy in their negotiations with the captive Queen of Scots. He had always professed the deepest attach ment to this unhappy princess ; and the young king had, within the last year, become so captivated with his society, that Mary, who had too rapidly trusted him with much of her secret correspondence, sanguinely hoped that his influence would be of the highest service to her, in regaining a hold over the affections of her son. But Gray, under an exterior which was pre-emi nently beautiful, though too feminine to please some 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Hunsdon to Burghley, October 1, 1584.

JAMES VI. 409 tastes, carried a heart as black and treacherous as any in this profligate age ; and, instead of advocating, was prepared to betray the cause of the imprisoned queen. To her son the young king, and the Earl of Arran, he had already revealed all he knew; and he now presented a letter from James his master to Hunsdon. Its con tents were of a secret and confidential kind, and related to the conspiracies against Elizabeth, which gave this princess such perpetual disquiet. After enjoining on Hunsdon the strictest concealment of all he was about to communicate from every living being, except his royal mistress, Gray informed him that the King of Scots meant to send him speedily as ambassador to England, with some public and open message to Eliza beth ; under colour of which, he was to be intrusted with the commission of disclosing all the secret prac tices of Mary. Had Hunsdon kept his promise, we should have known nothing of all this ; but next morning he communicated it to Burghley, in a letter meant only for his private eye. It is to the preserva tion of this letter, that we owe our knowledge of a transaction which brings the young king, and his favourite the Master of Gray, before us in the degrading light of informers : the one betraying his mother ; the other selling, for his own gain, the secrets with which he had been intrusted by his sovereign. This is so dark an accusation, that I must substantiate it by an extract from the letter in question. \" Now, my lord,\" said Hunsdon, addressing Burghley, \"for the principal point of such conspiracies as are in hand against her majesty, I am only to make her majesty acquainted withal by what means she shall know it \u2014 yet will I acquaint your lordship with all.

He is, no doubt, very inward with the Scottish queen, and all her affairs, both in England and France ; yea, and with the pope, for he is accounted a Papist ; but for his religion, your lordship will judge when you see him; but her majesty must use him as Arran will prescribe unto her ; and so shall she reap profit by him. * * * I have written to Mr. Secretary [Walsingham] for a safe-conduct to him ; but nothing of the cause of his coming, but only to her majesty and to your lordship. If Mr. Secretary be slow for this safe-con duct, I pray your lordship further it, for the matter requires no delay.\" 2 The conference was now concluded, and Arran had succeeded in persuading Lord Hunsdon, not only of his sincerity and devotion to the service of Elizabeth, but of his entire hold over the mind of his royal master. If Lord Burghley, to whom he professed the utmost attachment, would co-operate firmly with him self and Hunsdon, and the Master of Gray7, he was able, he affirmed, to hold the young king entirely at the devotion of the Queen of England. He did not despair to unite the two crowns in an indissoluble league ; and, by exposing the practices of her enemies, to enable Elizabeth to traverse all the plots of Mary and the Roman Catholics. But there were two par ties whom, he declared, they must put down at all risks : the one laboured for the liberty of the captive 1 These words seem superfluous, yet they are in the original letter. 5 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Hunsdon to Burghley, Aug. 14, 1584."], [417, "1584. JAMES VI. 411 queen, and her association in the government with her son : the other was, at this moment, intriguing in every way for the return of Angus and the exiled lords ; for the triumph of the Kirk over Episcopacy, and the re-establishment of the Republican principles which had led to the raid of Ruthven, and the other conspiracies for seizing the king, and using him as their tool. The first party was supported by France, Spain, and the Spanish faction of the Roman Catholics in England : its agents on the continent were the Bishops of Ross and Glasgow, whose emissaries, the Jesuits and seminary priests, were at that moment plotting in Scotland ; it possessed many friends in the privy council and nobility of Scotland, \u2014 such as, Maitland the chancellor, Sir James and Sir Robert Melvil,1 the Earl of Huntley, and it might, indeed, be said, the whole body of the Roman Catholic peers in both countries. It was from this party that the late conspiracies against the Queen of England had proceeded, as her majesty would soon discover by the embassy of the Master of Gray ; and if she listened to his (Arran's) advice, it would be no difficult matter to detach James for ever from his mother and her friends. But to effect this, she must put down the other faction of the banished lords. The king, he said, hated Angus, their leader; and Angus and the whole house of Douglas were still boiling in their hearts to revenge on their sovereign, and on Arran, the death of the Regent Morton. As to the banished lords of the house of Hamilton, their return must be his (Arran's) destruction ; and for the exiled ministers of the Kirk, James was so incensed against them, and so bent upon the establishment of Episcopacy, that 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Walsingham to Hunsdon, August 12, 1584."], [418, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1584. 412 he would listen to no measures connected with their restoration. Yet this party for the return of the banished lords, was supported by Walsingham in England, and Davison her majesty's ambassador in Scotland ; and their busy agent, Colvile, was admitted to secret audiences with Elizabeth, and fed with hopes of their return. If this policy were continued, (so argued Arran,) it would blast all his efforts for the binding his young master to the service of Eliza beth ; for rather than one of the banished lords should set his foot in Scotland, James, he was assured, would throw himself into the arms of France and Spain, and carry through the project of an association with his mother the captive queen. These arguments of Arran explain that jealousy and irritation which appeared in many of Secretary Walsingham's letters regarding the conference be tween him and Hunsdon. This crafty statesman was well aware that there was a conference within a con ference, to which he was kept a stranger ; a secret negotiation between Burghley and Hunsdon, the exact object of which he could not fathom ; but by which he felt his own policy regarding Scotland shackled and defeated. He looked, therefore, with suspicion upon Burghley's whole conduct in the affairs of Scot land at this time ; and these feelings were increased by the court which Arran had paid to Burghley's nephew, Sir Edward Hoby, who formed one of Huns don's suite at the conference. This accomplished person, on the conclusion of the conference, rode from Foulden Kirk, with the Earl of Arran, to the ground where he had left his troops ; the distance was three miles ; they had ample time for secret talk; and Hoby next morning described the conversation, in letters addressed both to his"], [419, "1584. JAMES VI. 413 uncle Burghley, and his kinsman Dr. Parry.1 The Scottish earl was particularly flattering and confiden tial. Bringing Hoby near his troops, which were admirably mounted and accoutred, he pointed to them significantly, and shaking his head, told him, in these ranks there were many principal leaders, who would gladly send him out of the world if they could, so mortally did they hate him ; but he feared them not. Nay, such was his power, and his enemies' weakness at this moment, that if Elizabeth would accept his offers, she should have twenty thousand men at her service. To devote himself to her, indeed, would be his highest pride. As for France and Spain, he cared little for either : he neither needed their friendship, nor feared their enmity ; but with the favour of his royal master, could live in Scotland independent of both ; and for these conspiracies against his life, the same God who had defended him in Muscovy, Sweden, and Germany, would cast his shield over him at home. Arran then appears to have changed the subject to James's expectations as Elizabeth's successor, the state of England, the rival interests of the Catholic and Protestant factions in reference to this delicate point, and the probable effects of Mary's intrigues for the recovery of her liberty upon the prospects of her son. So, at least, may be conjectured, from Hoby's description of the great aud weighty discourses into which he entered ; and he ended by assuring him, that the King of Scots desired, of all things in the world, to place himself, and his whole interests, in the hands of Lord Burghley and Lord Hunsdon, the one as the wisest head, and the other the boldest heart, in 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Sir Edward Hoby to Dr. Parry, August 15, 1584."], [420, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1584. 414 England.1 When it is recollected that Arran was no friend of the Queen of Scots, and that Burghley was not only opposed to every scheme for her liberty, but had often repeated his conviction, that her life was inconsistent with Elizabeth's security, we require no more certain evidence of the melancholy7 fact, that James was ready, at this instant, to desert her cause, and- betray her designs to her bitterest enemies. On his return from this conference to the capital, Arran, presuming on its successful issue, resumed the management of affairs with a high and proud hand. A few days before he met Hunsdon, he had, as we have just seen, discovered a conspiracy against the govern ment. In this plot, the captain of the castle of Edinburgh had been detected tampering with Davison and Walsingham, for the delivery of the fortress into the hands of the English faction ; and Arran wisely resolved to defeat all recurrence of such attempts, by taking possession of the place in person.2 He accordingly removed the governor and officers, sub stituted his own creatures in their room, demanded the keys of the crown jewels and wardrobe from Sir Robert Melvil, and, with his lady and household, occupied the royal apartments within the castle.3 He had now four of the strongest fortresses of the country at his devotion \u2014 Dunbarton, Stirling, Black ness, and Edinburgh ; and his ambition enlarging by what it fed on, he assumed a kingly consequence and state which offended the ancient nobility, and excited their fear and envy. On his return from the confer ence at Foulden Kirk, he was welcomed with cannon 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Sir Edward Hoby to Lord Burghley, August 15, 1584. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Walsingham to Davison, July 12, 1584; and ibid.

JAMES VI. 415 by the castle ; a ceremony, as it was remarked, never used but in time of parliament, and to the king or regents : and when, soon after, summonses were issued for the meeting of the three estates, all the country looked forward with alarm to a renewal of the pro scriptions and plunder which had already commenced against the exiled lords. But the reality even out ran their anticipation. Arran, assisted by his lady, a woman whose pride and insolence exceeded his own, domineered over the deliberations of parliament ; and, to the scandal of all, insisted on those acts, which they had previously prepared, being passed at once without reasoning.1 Sixty persons were for feited, 2 many were driven to purchase pardons at a high ransom, and the unhappy Countess of Gowrie was treated with a cruelty and brutality which ex cited the utmost commiseration in all who witnessed it. This lady, a daughter of Henry Stewart lord Methven, on the last day of the parliament, had obtained admission to an antechamber, where, as the king passed, she hoped to have an opportunity of pleading for herself and her children ; but, by Arran's orders, she was driven into the open street. Here she patiently awaited the king's return, and cast herself, in an agony of tears, at his feet, attempting to clasp his knees ; but Arran, who walked at James's hand, hastily pulled him past, and pushing the miser able suppliant aside, not only threw her down, but brutally trode upon her as the cavalcade moved for ward, leaving her in a faint on the pavement. Can we wonder that the sons of this injured woman, bred up in the recollection of wrongs like these, should, in 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Davison to Walsingham, August 24, 1584. 2 Ibid.

Immediately after the parliament, the king repaired to his palace at Falkland ; whilst Arran, Montrose, and the other lords of his party, now all-powerful, remained in Edinburgh, engaged in pressing on the execution of the late acts, for the confiscation and ruin of their opponents. Of these, by far the most formidable was the Earl of Angus ; who, although banished, and now at Newcastle, retained a great influence in Scotland. He was the head of the Pres byterian faction in that country, the great support of the exiled ministers; and it was his authority with Walsingham that traversed Arran's and James's schemes for a league between England and Scotland, on the broad basis of the establishment of Episco pacy. It was resolved, therefore, to cut off this baron ; and Arran, and his colleague Montrose, the head of the powerful house of Graham, made no scruple of looking out for some desperate retainer, or hired villain, to whom they might commit the task. Nor, in these dark times, was such a search likely to prove either long or difficult. They accordingly soon pitched upon Jock, or John Graham of Peartree, whom Montrose knew to have a blood feud with Angus ; sent a little page called Mouse to bring the borderer to Edinburgh ; feasted and caressed him during the time of the parliament, and carried him afterwards to Falkland, where the two earls, and the king, pro posed to him not only to assassinate their hated enemy, but to make away with Mar and Cambusken neth, his brother exiles, at the same time. Jock at once agreed to murder Angus, and was promised a high reward by the young monarch ; but he declined having any thing to do with Mar, or Cambuskenneth,"], [423, "1584. JAMES VI. 417 with whom he had no quarrel ; and he left the palace, after receiving from Montrose a short matchlock, or riding-piece, which was deemed serviceable for the purpose in hand. But this atrocious design was not destined to succeed. The villain, who was probably lurking about in the neighbourhood of Newcastle, was detected and seized, carried before Lord Scrope, compelled to confess his intention ; and information of the whole plot was immediately transmitted by Scrope to Walsingham.1 The English secretary recommended, that the discovery should be kept a secret from all, except Angus and Mar, who were privately warned of the practices against them ; and it is from the confession of the borderer himself, which he made before Scrope, that these particulars are given. The intended assassin thus described his interview with the king : After stating that he had arrived late at night at the palace, they brought him, he said, into the king's gallery7, where he (the king) Avas alone by himself: and only he, Montrose, and Arran, and this examinant, being together, the king himself did move him, as the other two had done, for the killing of Angus, Mar, and Cambuskenneth : to whom he answered, that, for Mar and Cambusken neth, he would not meddle with them ; but for Angus, he would well be contented to do that, so as the king would well reward him for that. And the \u00a9 king said, he would presently give him sixty French crowns, and twenty Scottish pound land to him and his for ever, lying in Strathern, near Montrose.2 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

To return, however, from this digression to Arran's headlong career. His hand, which had recently fallen so heavily on the nobility, was now lifted against the Kirk. Proclamation was made \u00a9 that all ministers should give up the rental of their benefices; and that none should receive stipend but such as had subscribed the new-framed policy, by which Presbytery was abrogated and Episcopacy esta blished. As was to be expected, many of the clergy resisted, and were commanded to quit the country within twenty days; nor were they permitted, as before, to take refuge with their banished brethren in England or Ireland.1 All this was carried through at the instigation of the primate, Archbishop Adamson, who had recently returned from England, and exerted himself to purify the universities from the leaven of Presbyterian doctrine, and to fill the vacant pulpits with ministers attached to the new form of policy. His efforts, however, met with bitter opposition. At St. Andrews, the archiepiscopal palace in which Adam son resided, was surrounded by troops of students, who armed themselves with harquebusses,and paraded round the walls, bidding the primate remember how fatal that see had been to his predecessor, and look for no better issue.

The anathema of one of these, named Mr. John Hewison, minister of Cambuslang, has been preserved. It is more remarkable, certainly, for its courage than its charity ; and may be taken as an example of the tone of the high Puritan faction to which he belonged. \u00a9 \u00a9 Preaching in the Blackfriars at Edinburgh, on the text which declares the resolute answer of St. Peter and St. Paul to the council of the Pharisees, he passed from the general application to the trials of the Kirk at that moment, and broke out into these words : \u2014 \" But what shall we say ?

Suddenly, in the firmament, there appeared a figure in the likeness of a man ; of glorious shape and surpassing brightness ; the sun was above his head, the moon beneath his feet ; and he seemed to stand in the midst of the stars. As the captive gazed, an angel alighted at the feet of this transcendant being, bearing in his right \u00a9' \u00a9 \u00a9 hand a red naked sword, and in his left a scroll, to whom the glorious shape seemed to give command ment ; upon which the avenging angel, for so he now appeared to be, flew rapidly through the heavens, and lighted on the ramparts of a fortress, which Lindsay 1 Wrangously, wrongfully. a Aneugh, enough. 3 Ken, know. 4 MS.

The scene then changed : the captive was carried to an eminence, from which he looked down upon the land, with its wide fields, its cities and palaces. Suddenly the same terrible visitant appeared : a cry of lamentation arose from its inhabitants ; fire fell from heaven on its de voted towns, the sword did its work, the rivers ran with blood, and the fields were covered with the dead. It was a fearful sight ; but, amidst its horrors, a little bell was heard ; and within a church which had stood uninjured, even in the flames, a remnant of the faithful assembled, to whom the angel uttered these words of awful admonition \u2014 \" Metuant Justi. Iniquitatem fugite. Deligite Justitiam et Judicium ; aut cito revertar et posteriora erunt pejora prioribus.\" 1 Lind say asserted that it was impossible for him to ascertain whether this scene, which seemed to shadow out the persecutions and prospects of the Kirk, was a dream or a vision ; but it brought to his mind, he said, a pro phecy of Knox, who, not long before his death, had predicted great peril to the faithful in the eighteenth year of the reign of James. Elizabeth now recalled Davison from Scotland,2 and looked anxiously for James's promised ambassa dor, the Master of Gray, whose mission had, as she thought, been somewhat suspiciously delayed. But 1 Sir George Warrender, MS. vol. B. sol. 59. \"A vision [which] appeared to Mr. David Lindsay, he being in his bed in the house of Blackness, in the month of October, 1 584.\" 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Davison to Walsingham, Sept. 17, 1584."], [428, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1584. 422 this gave her the less anxiety, as she had, in the mean time, continued her correspondence with the banished lords, whom, at any moment, she was ready to let loose against Arran and the kiug.1 She, at the same time, resumed her negotiations with Mary; and this unfortunate princess, who had so often been deluded with hopes, which withered in the expected moment of accomplishment, was, at last, induced to believe that the blessed period of freedom had arrived. Even Walsingham declared himself pleased with her offers, and advised his royal mistress to be satisfied with them.2 Such was the crisis seized by the accom plished villany of the Master of Gray, to betray his royal mistress, and to enter the service of Elizabeth. Before he threw off the mask, he had the effrontery to write to Mary, affecting the highest indignation at the suspicions she had expressed of his fidelity ; and declaring, that the best mode to serve her interests was that which he was now following. It was neces sary, he said, that the young king, her son, should, in the first instance, treat solely for himself with Eliza beth, and abandon all thoughts of \"the association\" with his mother. This, he affirmed, would disarm suspicion ; and James, having gained the confidence of the English queen, might be able to negotiate for her liberty. But Mary, who was already aware of Gray's treachery, from the representations of Fontenay the French ambassador, promptly and indignantly answered, that any one who proposed such a separa tion between her interests and those of her son, or who opposed \"the association,\" which was almost concluded, must be her enemy, and in that light she 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Walsingham to Captain Reid, Sept. 23, 1584. 2 Sadler Papers by Scott, vol. ii."], [429, "1584. JAMES VI. 423 would regard him. To this Gray returned an angry answer, and instantly set off for England.1 At Berwick, he had a private consultation with Hunsdon, whose heart he gained by his sanctimonious deportment in the English church, and by the frank ness with which he communicated his instructions. His principal object, he declared, was to insist, that the banished lords should either be delivered up by Elizabeth, or dismissed from her dominions. If this were done, or if the queen were ready to pledge her word that it should be done, he was prepared, he said, to disclose all he knew of the secret plots against her person and government ; and he would pledge himself, that no practice had been undertaken, for the last five years, against herself, or her estate, by France, Spain, the Scottish queen, or the pope, but she should know it, and how to avoid it.2 Gray had been expressly ordered by James to hold his confidential communica tions with Burghley alone, and to repose no trust in Walsingham, whom the young king regarded as his enemy. From Arran he had received the same in junctions ; and nothing could exceed the confidence which both monarch and minister seemed disposed to place in Cecil. The king paid court to him in a long pedantic letter, written wholly in his own hand ; in which he discoursed learnedly upon Alexander the Great and Homer ; modestly disclaiming any parallel between himself and the conqueror of Darius, but ex alting Cecil far above such \" a blind, begging fellow \" as the Grecian bard. He addressed him as his friend and cousin, and assured him, that he considered him self infinitely fortunate in being permitted to confide 1 Papers of Master of Gray, Bannatyne Club, pp. 30-37. 2 Hunsdon to Burghley, October 19, 1584, Papers of Master of Gray, p. 13."], [430, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1584. 424 his most secret affairs to such a counsellor ; to whom, he was convinced, he already owed all the prosperity which hitherto had attended him.1 Arran, at the same time, wrote in the most flattering and confiden tial terms to Sir Edward Hoby, Burghley's nephew ; and Hunsdon was requested by James to repair from Berwick to the English court, that he might assist in their consultations.2 Gray now proceeded to London, and was speedily admitted to an audience of Elizabeth. It may be necessary, for a moment, to attend to the exact atti tude and circumstances in which this princess now stood. She had the party of the banished lords, now in England, at her command. Angus, Mar, Lord Arbroath the head of the house of Hamilton, Glam mis, and many other powerful barons, were in con stant communication with Walsingham ; their vassals on the alert ; the exiled ministers of the Kirk eager to join and march along with them : they held themselves ready at her beck ; and she had only to give the signal for them to cross the border and attack Arran, to have it instantly obeyed. On the side of Mary, this poor captive had been drawn on, by the prospect of freedom, to offer the sacrifice of every thing which belonged to her as an independent princess, and which she could give up with honour. By the long contemplated \" association \" with her son, she had agreed to resign the government into his hands, and to renounce for ever all connexion with public affairs, were she only allowed to live in freedom, with the exercise of her religion. Here, then, the Queen of England had only to consent, and, 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, James to Burghley, October 14, 1S84, s Ibid."], [431, "1584. JAMES VI. 425 in the opinion of even the suspicious Walsingham, she was safe. Such was the state of things, when the Master of Gray made his proposals from a third party, \u2014 the young king and Arran. From his intimate knowledge of the most secret transactions of the Scottish queen and the Catholic faction, he was possessed, as he affirmed, of information which vitally touched her majesty's person and estate.1 This he was ready to reveal, but on condition that she would deliver up the banished lords, or drive them out of her dominions, break off all treaty with Mary on the subject of the association, and advance a large sum of money, in the shape of an annual proof of her affection to the young king. The first was absolutely necessary ; for the king his master was animated with the strongest hatred of his rebels. The second was equally so ; for Mary's liberty was inconsistent with the security of both the Queen of England and James ; her unshaken attach ment to the Roman Catholic faith rendering any \" association \" with her son highly dangerous to Eliza beth ; whose efforts ought to be directed to separate their interests, and to secure the establishment of a government in Scotland under a minister opposed to Mary. And here Gray artfully laid the foundation of his own rise with Elizabeth, and of Arran's disgrace. Arran, he insinuated, was not so deeply devoted to her majesty, or so hostile to the Scottish queen, as he pretended. He was proud, capricious, tyrannical, and completely venal. The king, too, was in such need of money, that Elizabeth would do well to remember that his politics, at this time, depended on the supply of his purse. If France bid highest, Frauce would 1 Papers of the Master of Gray, p. 13, Hunsdon to Burghley, Oct, 19, 1584."], [432, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1584, 426 have both the minister and his master. Arran, too, by his pride and extortions, was daily, almost hourly, raising up a formidable party against himself. None, he said, dared to aspire to any interest with the king, whom he did not attack and attempt to ruin. Already he, the Master of Gray, was the object of his jealousy and hatred, for the favour with which the king regarded him. All was yet, indeed, smooth and smiling between them ; but he knew well, this very embassy had been given him with the view of separating- him from his master. The storm was brewing ; but if Arran tried to wreck him, as he had done so many others, he might chance, proud as he was, to have a fall himself. So confident did he feel, he said, in the love of his royal master, that, if Elizabeth would grant him her sup port, he was certain he could supplant this insolent favourite, gain the voung king, unite England and 7 \u00a9 t/ O \u00a9* \u00a9 Scotland in an indissoluble league, recall the banished lords, overwhelm all the secret plots of the Roman Catholics, and completely separate Mary and her son. To effect all this, however, would require time ; for, on two points, the king would be hard to be moved. If the exiles came back, they would bring Andrew Melvil and the banished ministers of the Kirk along with them ; and, at this moment, the very mention of such a result would excite James's determined opposition. Elizabeth was highly pleased with this proposal. She had long distrusted Arran, and felt that her best security lay in the return of the Protestant lords : she was anxious to break off her negotiation with \u00a9 Mary, but did not like the odium of such a course ; the blame would be thrown on the King of Scots by Gray's plan, and this she liked much. She knew the unremitting efforts of France and Spain to gain the young king ; and felt assured, that her only safeguard"], [433, "1584. JAMES VI. 427 would be an \" association \" between her own kingdom and Scotland, from which Mary should be entirely excluded ; and the basis of which should be the de fence of the reformed religion against the perpetual attacks of the Roman Catholics in Europe. There were some circumstances of recent occurrence which greatly strengthened her in this course. Father Crichton, a Jesuit, happening to be on his voyage to Scotland from Flanders, the vessel was chased by pirates, and he was observed to tear some papers and cast them away ; but the wind blew them back into the ship : they were picked up, put together, and found to contain a proposal for an invasion of England by Spain and the Duke of Guise. As one object proposed here, and in all such plots, was the delivery of the Queen of Scots and the dethronement of Elizabeth, their constant recurrence was now met by an \" asso ciation \" for the protection of the English queen's government and life, first proposed by Leicester, and eagerly subscribed by persons of all ranks and deno minations. The terms of this association were after wards solemnly approved by parliament, and an act passed for the safety of the queen's person. It stated, that if any invasion or rebellion should be made in her dominions, or any enterprise attempted against her person, by or for any person pretending a title to the crown after her death, she might, by a commission under the great seal, constitute a court for the trial of such offences, and which should have authority to pass sentence upon them. It added, that a judgment of \" guilty \" having been pronounced, it should im mediately be made public ; and that all persons against whom such sentence was passed, should be excluded from all claim to the crown, and be liable to be pro secuted to the death, with their aiders and abettors,"], [434, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1584-5. 428 by her majesty's subjects.1 This league was evidently most unjust towards the Scottish queen, as it made her responsible, and liable to punishment, for the actions of persons over whom she had no control. She saw this; and at once declared that \"the associa- tion \" had no other object than indirectly to compass her ruin. But if alarming to Mary, it was propor- tionably gratifying to Elizabeth. She persuaded her- self, that, if her subjects thus united to protect her person, and preserve the reformed faith, she ought vigorously to second their efforts ; and this inclined her to look graciously on Gray7. The measures, therefore, proposed by him were adopted. It was resolved to undermine Arran, as the first step for the restoration of the banished lords ; and the other objects, it was trusted, would follow. To co-operate with Gray, Sir Edward Wotton was chosen to suc- ceed Davison as ambassador in Scotland. He was a man of brilliant wit and insinuating address, a great sportsman, an adept in hunting and \"wood-craft;\" and these qualities, with a present of eight couple of the best hounds, and some choice horses, wrould, it was believed, entirely gain the heart of the young king. Wotton, too, as we learn from Sir James Melvil, was a deep plotter, and capable of the darkest designs, whilst to the world he seemed but an elegant, light hearted, and thoughtless man of fashion. Having laid these schemes for the ruin of his cap tive sovereign and of Arran his friend, the Master of Gray returned to the Scottish court, and received the thanks of the king, and his still all-powerful favourite, for the success with which he had conducted his negotiations.2 To disarm suspicion, it was judged 1 Carte, vol. iii. p. 587. s MS. letter, Master of Gray to Elizabeth, January 24, 1584-5."], [435, "1584-5. JAMES VI. 429 prudent that, for some time, all should go on serenely. Elizabeth wrote in flattering terms to Arran. She, at the same time, commanded the banished lords to remove from Newcastle into the interior;1 and, in return for this, Gray had the satisfaction of assuring her, that he found the king his master in so loving a disposition towards her, that he could not feel more warmly were he her natural son. He was equally successful in at once creating a breach between Mary and James. The just and merited contempt with which Fontenay the French ambassador had stigma tized Gray's base desertion of that princess, furnished him with a subject of complaint to the king and council ; and he so artfully represented the dangerous consequences which must follow \" an association\" be tween the young king and his mother, that it was unanimously resolved it should never take place.2 This was a great point gained ; and to secure further success, he implored Elizabeth and her minis ters to humour James for the present, by entirely casting off Angus and the exiled lords, whose despair was great when they found the predicament in which they stood. They appealed in urgent terms to Wal singham ; declared that, even now, if the queen would say the word, they Avould break across the border, surprise the person of the king, and chase Arran with ignominy from the country. Every thing was ready for such an effort, and their friends only waited their arrival. But their proposal for an irruption was coldly received. Walsingham wrote to them, that Ibid.

All ministers were compelled, on penalty of de- privation, to subscribe the acts of parliament which established the Episcopal form of government ; for- bidden to hold the slightest intercourse with their brethren who had fled for conscience' sake ; and even prosecuted, if they dared to pray for them.2 This extreme severity7 appears to have been followed by a very general submission to the obnoxious acts ; and as it was followed up by the removal of the banished lords into the interior of England, and a prohibition of any Scottish minister from preaching, publicly or privately7, in that realm, the cause wTas considered at the lowest ebb. A letter, written at this time by David Hume, one of the exiles, from Berwick, to Mr. James Carmichael, a recusant brother of the Kirk, gave some details which carried sorrow to the hearts of the brave little remnant which still stood out against \u00a9 the court. It told, in homely but expressive phrase, that all the ministers betwixt Stirling and Berwick, all Lothian, and all the Merse, had subscribed, with only ten exceptions ; amongst whom, the most noted were Patrick Simpson and Robert Pont ; that the Laird of Dun, the most venerable champion of the Kirk, had so far receded from his primitive faith as to have become a pest to the ministry in the north ; that John Durie, who had so long resisted, had 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Walsingham to Colvile, January 10, 1584-5. 2 Spottiswood, p. 336."], [437, "1584-5.

His own estates, he added, had been forfeited, his wife and children beggared ; and yet he might be grateful he was alive, though in exile, for at home terror occupied all hearts. No man, said he in conclusion, while he lieth down, is sure of his life till day.2 This miserable picture was increased in its horrors by the violent proceedings of Arran against all con nected with the banished lords, by his open contempt of the laws, and the shameful venality of his govern ment. His pride, his avarice, his insolence to the ancient nobility, and impatience of all who rivalled him in the king's affections, made his government in tolerable ; and the Master of Gray, beginning to find that he was looked upon with suspicion by this daring man, concluded that the moment had come for the mortal struggle between them. At this time, Sir Edward Wotton, the English am bassador, arrived in Edinburgh. He was instructed to congratulate James on his wise determination to \u00a9 break off \" the association \" with his mother the cap tive queen, and to encourage him to enter into\u00ab^ firm league with England. The ambassador was also \u00a9 \u00a9 directed by Elizabeth to hold out to the Scottish king good hopes of a pension ; but Walsingham, her prudent secretary, advised him not rashly to name 1 \" Cracked his curple.\" Curple, Scots ; i. e. crupper ; meaning that the crupper had broken, and Durie, saddle and all, had come violently to the ground. 2 MS. letter in Calderwood, British Museum, Ayscough, 4736, sol. 1528."], [438, "432 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1585. the sum set down in his instructions, as its small sound might rather do harm than good.1 As he found opportunity, he was to sound the king, also, on the subject of his marriage, naming the King of Denmark's daughter; and to assure him, that his deep animosity7 against the banished lords, was, in her opinion, immoderate and unjust. Last summer, she said, the Earl of Arran had, in his letters to her, accused them of a conspiracy against his life ; and now, recently, she had investigated a similar story brought up by James's ambassador, the justice-clerk: but both tales, in the end, proved so weak and groundless, that she had good cause to think them maliciously devised to serve some end.2 Such were Wotton's open instructions ; and as he seconded all he said by a present of eight couple of buckhounds, and brought some noble horses for the royal stud, James received him with the youthful boisterous delight which such gifts usually produced in the royal mind. But the ambassador had a darker and more secret commission. During Gray's late stay at the court of England, he had contrived, with the approval of Elizabeth and the assistance of Walsing ham, a plot for the destruction of Arran ; and Bellenden the justice-clerk, who had recently visited England, had been prevailed on by the queen to join it. Wot ton was now sent down to take the management ; and at the moment when he arrived, he found the Master of Gray deliberating with his brother conspirators, whether it were best to seize and discourt3 their 1 MS.

JAMES VI. 433 enemy, or to assassinate him. The Lord Maxwell, now best known by the title of Earl of Morton, had joined the plot, having a mortal feud with Arran ; and it is not improbable the more violent course would have been chosen, when Gray received, by the hands of Wotton, a letter from Elizabeth, recommend ing them to spare him. Wotton next day wTrote thus to Walsingham : \" By my letter that myself did deliver to the Master of Gray from her majesty, their purpose is altered, at her majesty's request, to deal with him by violence ; notwithstanding, upon the least occasion that shall be offered, they mean to make short work with him.\"1 Gray, also, on the same day, addressed a letter to the English secretary, assuring him, that he would comply with the queen's wishes, and not resort to violence, except he saw some hazard to his own life. Adding, emphatically and truly, as to his own character, \" when life is gone all is gone to me.\"2 In the midst of these intrigues, all was bustle and pleasure at the Scottish court. The king hunted, feasted, and made progresses to his different palaces, and the seats of his nobility. The ambassador, in whose society he took much delight, attended him on all his expeditions ; occasionally mingling state affairs with the chase, or the masque, or the banquet ; re commending the speedy adjustment of the league with Elizabeth ; sounding him lightly on the point of his marriage ; touching on the melancholy divisions amongst his nobility, which were increased by his con tinued severity to the banished lords ; and sometimes adverting, with extreme caution, and in general terms, to the delicate subject of the promised pension.

It appeared to him, he said, most wise and necessary, that the \" confederacy,\" which had re cently been entered into by the various Roman Catholic princes, to prosecute the professors of the reformed faith, should be met by a union of the Protestant powers in their own defence ; and when the various heads of this treaty, transmitted by Walsingham to Wotton, were laid before him, they met with his cordial approbation.1 On his marriage, he showed no disposition to speak with seriousness; and Gray assured Wotton, that to deal lightly in that matter would be best policy, his young master having no inclination to match himself at this moment. His mind was wholly engrossed with his pastime, hunting, and his buckhounds. Of this passion, a ludicrous outbreak occurred shortly before Wotton's arrival. James, at the end of a sharp and successful run, calling for a cup of wine, drank to all his dogs ; and, in particular, selecting and taking the paw of an old hound, named Tell True, who had greatly distin guished himself, he thus apostrophized his favourite : \"Tell True, I drink to thee above all my hounds; and would sooner trust thy tongue than either Craig or the bishop.\" Craig was the royal chaplain, and the prelate, Montgomery bishop of Glasgow. This anecdote was reported again to the banished ministers of the Kirk ; and mourned over more seriously, and as pointing to a deeper depravity, than it seems to have indicated. 2 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Wotton to Walsingham, 5th June, 1585.

JAMES VI. 435 Wotton was pleased to find that James continued constant in his resolution not to enter into any asso ciation with the captive queen ; but, on the other hand, there were two subjects on which the young monarch was immoveable, \u2014 his love for Arran, and his enmity to the banished Protestant lords and their ministers. These were most serious impediments in the way of the negotiation ; and as the conspirators suspected that Arran was already intriguing with France, to traverse the league with England, many secret conversations took place between the English ambassador and the conspirators, as to the propriety of cutting off this powerful favourite at once, before he should do more mischief. Wotton duly and minutely communicated what passed at such interviews, to Walsingham and Elizabeth ; and although the letters are, in many places, written in cipher, and wherever the intended murder is directly mentioned, the words have been partially scored out, still, fortunately for the truth, we have a key to the cipher, and the erasure is often legible. Strange and revolting as it may sound to the ears of modern jurisconsults, it is nevertheless certain, that the Lord Justice-clerk Bellenden, the late am bassador to England, and the second highest criminal judge in the country, promised Wotton to find an assassin of Arran, if he would engage that his royal mistress would protect him. Wotton was much puzzled with this, and still more embarrassed when he received a private visit from the proposed murderer himself; who figures in his letter as 38, and appears to have been Douglas provost of Lincluden.1 The English ambassador had been carefully warned not to implicate Elizabeth, by any promises, but to leave the 1 MS. letter, WTotton to Walsingham, June 9, 1585.

James had determined that the proposed league between England and his kingdom, for the defence of religion, should be concluded. He had revised and amended the various articles ; and, with the view of bringing forward the subject, had assem bled a convention of his nobility at St. Andrews, when an event occurred, which threatened to throw all into confusion. This was the slaughter of Lord Russell in a border affray, which took place at a meeting, or day of truce, as it was called, between Sir John Foster and Kerr of Ferny7hirst, the wardens of the middle marches.1 There is good reason to believe, that this unfortunate affair was wholly un premeditated, for so Foster himself declared in his letter, written to Walsingham the day after ; 2 but as Fernyhirst happened to be the intimate friend of Arran, it instantly occurred to the crafty diplomacy of the English secretary, and Wotton the ambas sador, 3 that a good handle was given by the death of Russell, to procure the disgrace of this hated minister. Foster, therefore, was directed to draw up a paper, the purport of which was to show that the attack had been preconcerted;4 and Wotton did not scruple to declare to the young king, that one of the bravest noblemen of England had been murdered by the contrivance of Arran and Fernyhirst. 1 July 28. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, B.C.

Nor were these mere words: Arran was imprisoned in the castle of St. Andrews ; Fernyhirst was threatened to be sent to stand his trial in England ; and a strict investigation into the whole circumstances of the alleged murder took place. But the result rather evinced the in nocence, than established the guilt of Fernyhirst. Arran, meanwhile, bribed the Master of Gray, who procured his imprisonment at St. Andrews to be exchanged for a nominal confinement to his own castle at Kinneil ; and this scheme for the ruin of the court favourite, bid fair, by its unexpected result, to re-establish his influence over the young king, and increase his power.1 All this fell heavily on Wotton and Walsingham. Arran had resumed his intrigues with France ; it was believed that he had adopted the interests of the imprisoned queen, who, as we shall immediately see, was now busily engaged in organizing that great plot for the invasion of England aud her own deli very from captivity, which was known by the name of Babington's conspiracy. At the same moment Burghley and Walsingham, who, by intercepting Mary's letters, had discovered her designs against their royal mistress, were occupied in weaving those toils around Mary, and possessing themselves of those 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Wotton to Walsingham, July 29 and 30, 1585 ; also ibid, same to same, August 6, and 7, 1585, St. Andrews ; and ibid.

It was to them, therefore, of the utmost consequence, that the league between England and Scotland should be concluded before they made their great effort against Mary ; that the young king should be bound to Elizabeth by ties for mutual defence and the maintenance of the established religion ; and that Arran, and French interests and intrigues, should not repossess their power over his mind. Yet the only counterpoise to Arran, in James's affections, lay in the Master of Gray, their great tool and partisan ; and he had betrayed them. There could not be a doubt that Arran owed to him his late deliverance from prison. Gray had proved false, too, at the critical moment when he was privy to all their schemes against this favourite ; so that it became equally hazardous to trust him or to throw him off. What, then, was to be done ? It was necessary to act rapidly7 \u2014 to act decidedly ; and yet it was almost impossible for Elizabeth's ministers to make a single move against Arran without the fear of failure. From this difficulty they were delivered by the fertile brain and flagitious principles of the very man who had so recently betrayed them \u2014 the Master of Gray. He, too, had his misgivings as to the insecurity of the ground on which he stood, and in his dilemma sought the advice of Archibald Douglas, now in banishment in England, the intimate friend of Walsingham, and equally familiar with the party of the exiled lords and the expatriated ministers of the Kirk ; who, since the fall of Morton, had found a retreat in England. To this man, \u2014 who had been stained by the murder of Darnley, and since then engaged in innumerable plots, sometimes for, and sometimes against the queen-mother \u2014 Gray addressed"], [447, "1585. JAMES VI. 441 a singular letter, which yet remains, in which he laid open his secret heart, and required his advice, as the friend he loved best in the world. He told him frankly that the queen of England had deserted and almost ruined him. It was by her advice, and relying upon her promises of support, that he had matched himself against Arran ; that he had sought Arran's life, and Arran his : and now that he was reduced to a strait, where were all her promises? To continue to deal frankly with her was impossible ; and must lead to his overthrow. What parties, then, were left to be embraced? \u2014 Arran, the imprisoned queen, the French politics, the Roman Catholic in terests in Europe? This was impossible. Arran, although obliged to him for his recent escape, was the falsest of men, and never to be long trusted; Arran knew, too, that he would have taken his life. As to the Scottish queen, he (Gray) could never hope to be trusted by Mary after deserting her ; and his perfidy was perfectly known to the whole body of the Catholics. One party only remained, by uniting himself with which a revolution might be effected in Scotland: the party of the banished lords, and their expatriated friends, the ministers of the Kirk. If Angus, Mar, and the Master of Glammis, could make up their differences with their exiled brethren, Lords Claud and John Hamilton, with whom they were still at feud, and unite in invading Scotland, there would be little doubt of a strong diversion in their favour. To them Gray said he would promise all his influence ; it might happen, too, that he would find means to rid them of Arran ; but as to this he would make no stipulation. Yet, if the deed could still be done so secretly, that his knowledge of the \" doer\" should not be suspected, he would still make"], [448, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1585. 442 the attempt. At all events, they should be joined by Bothwell and Lord Hume ; and he could promise, also, he thought, for Cessford. He concluded his letter by assuring Douglas, that this was the only plan left, which had the slightest likelihood of suc cess ; that if the exiled noblemen were ever to make the attempt, now was the time when he would promise them they should muster at least two to one against their enemies ; and he ended his letter with these emphatic words : Persuade yourself, if the banished lords come down, the king shall either yield or leave Scotland.1 This new plot was readily embraced by the outlawed lords and the ministers of the Kirk, and warmly en couraged by Wotton, the English ambassador, who immediately communicated it to Walsingham, in a letter from Dunbarton, whither he had accompanied the young king upon a hunting party. The Master of Gray had sought him out, he said, and informed him, that he was now convinced they had run all this Avhile a wrong course, in seeking to disgrace Arran with the king, whose love towards him was so extreme, that he would never suffer a hair of his head to fall to the ground, if he might help it. It was evident, he continued, that as long as Arran should remain in favour with the king, it wTould be impossible to bring home the lords by fair means ; that, unless they might be restored, the league could neither be sure, nor the Master of Gray, and the rest of his party, in safety : for Arran, recovering the king's person, would be able, with his credit, to ruin them, and divert the king from the queen ; or, finding his affection towards her irremoveable, would not stick to convey him into 1 MS. letter, British Museum, Caligula, C. viii. sol. 222, Master of Gray to Archibald Douglas, August 14, 1535."], [449, "1585.

It was the advice, he said, of this experienced intriguer, that her majesty, having so good occasion ministered by the death of my Lord Russell, should pretend to take the matter very griev ously, and refuse to conclude the league for this time. She might then let slip the lords, (meaning Angus and his associates,) who, with some support of money7, and their friends in Scotland, might take Arran, and seize on the king's person ; in which exploit Gray promised them the best aid he and his faction could give. Gray added, that if Walsingham found this overture well liked at the English court, he would direct a special friend of his and the exiled lords, very shortly into England, who might confer with Angus and the rest about the execution of the plot. This (continued Wotton, addressing Walsingham) was the effect of Gray's whole speech, saving that, in the end, he said, in answer of an objection I made, that he would under take this thing, being alone, to bring the league to a perfect conclusion.1 This letter was written on the 25th of August ; and so actively did Gray proceed with his plot, that, within a week after, it had assumed a more serious shape. In Scotland he had gained the Earl of Mor ton, formerly Lord Maxwell, a powerful border baron, who had been suspected to be in the interest of Arran. In England, not only Angus, Mar, Glammis, and their friends, were secured as actors, but also the Lords Claud and John Hamilton, the mortal enemies of Arran, who had remained in banishment since the year 1579, when they were forfeited for the murder 1 State-paper Office, Wotton to Walsingham, Dunbarton, August 25, 1585.

These two noblemen agreed to a reconciliation with Angus and his party, with whom they had been at feud, and determined to unite against Arran. Wotton, the English ambassador, lent to all this his active assistance ; and his letters to Walsingham, which are still preserved, present us with an interest ing picture of the growth of the conspiracy.1 Some time before this, the Earl of Morton, who was war den of the west borders, and whom few noblemen in Scotland could surpass in military power and expe rience, had incurred the resentment of the king by an attack upon the Laird of Johnston, in which he slew Captain Lammie, who commanded a company of the royal forces which James had sent to reinforce John ston. This enraged the king, who, by the advice of Arran, determined to lead an army against the insur gent ; 2 and at this crisis of personal danger, overtures being made to Morton, he, to secure his safety, readily embraced the offers of Gray, and joined the conspiracy.3 This was a great point gained, and gave the utmost satisfaction to Wotton and Walsingham, to whom it was immediately communicated.4 But although nothing could exceed the activity and talent (if we may use this term) of Gray and Wotton, in the management of this plot, their efforts were counteracted by the coldness and delays of Elizabeth, 1 State-paper Office, Wotton to Walsingham, September 1, 1585.

This nobleman, still nominally confined to his house at Kinneil, on the charge of being accessary to Lord Russell's death, was yet daily recovering his power over the king's mind : and it was now well known that, having been deceived and thrown off by Elizabeth, he had embraced the interests of France, from which government he had recently received a large supply of money.1 Under his protection, Holt, Dury, and Bruce, three noted Jesuits, were secretly harboured in Scotland,2 and busily engaged in intrigues for the restoration of the queen-mother, and the re-establishment of the Roman Catholic faith.3 Nor wras this all. Arran, as we have already seen, could organize plots, and frame secret schemes for surprise and assassination, as well as his enemies. He had been too early educated in the sanguinary and unscrupulous policy of these times not to be an adept in such matters ; and whilst Gray and Wotton were weaving their meshes round him, they knew that counter-plots were being formed against themselves, of the existence of which they were certain, although they could not detect the agents. The two great factions into which the state \u00a9 O of Scotland was divided, were thus mutually on their guard, and jealously watching each other ; both armed, both intent on their dark purposes, busy in gaining partisans and in anticipating the designs of their op ponents ; so that it seemed a race who should soonest spring the mine which was to overwhelm and destroy their adversary.

He knew, and repeatedly wrote to Walsingham, that his life was in danger. His intrigues had been partially discovered by Arran. Colonel Stewart, the brother of that nobleman, and captain of the Royal Guard, had upbraided him for his perfidy before the king ; and although the ambas sador gave him the lie on the spot, the truth was too well known for any to be deceived by this bravado.1 It was under the influence of such feelings that he thus addressed Walsingham : \u2014 \" Though ye in Eng land be slow in resolving, Arran and his faction sleep not out their time : for they are now gathering all the forces they can make, and, within three or four days, Arran meaneth to come to the court, and to possess himself of the king, in despite of the Queen of England, as he saith ; which, if he do, I mean to retire myself to the borders for the safety of my life, whereof I am in great danger, as my friends which hear the Stewarts' threatenings daily advertise me.

Other hope to England than in them, I see none ; the king being young and easily carried, and most about him either Papists or Atheists.\"1 In a second letter, written to Walsingham on the same day, Wotton added this emphatic paragraph : \" The Master of Gray,2 through our long English delay, findeth himself driven to a great strait. For the king presseth him greatly to meet with Arran, and threateneth, that, unless he do it, he shall have just cause to suspect him.

Such being the ripeness of all things, Wotton, who still remained at the Scottish court, although in daily danger of his life, wrote hastily to Walsingham, on the 5th of October, assuring him, that the king had resolved to send his forces against O \u00a9 Morton before the 20th of October, and would pro bably lead them in person. Arran, he added, was to be liberated; and if the lords meant to surprise him, and strike the blow with any hope of success, it must be done instantly.3 These arguments had the desired effect ; and Eliza beth, being assured that no time was to be lost, com manded her ambassador to require an audience of the King of Scots, and make a peremptory demand for 1 State-paper Office, Wotton to Walsingham, Sept. 30, 1585, Stir ling.

It was certain that this would be refused ; and her object was to afford a pretext for the retirement of Wotton from the Scottish court, at the moment when the con spiracy, which he had organized with such persevering activity, was to take effect.1 But matters framed themselves otherwise. Early in October, the banished lords, Angus, Mar, and the Master of Glammis, who were then in London, received Elizabeth's permission to set out on their enterprise ; but by the advice of the ministers of the Kirk, their companions in exile, they first held an exercise of humiliation at West minster, and with many tears, (so writes the historian of the Kirk,) besought God to strengthen their arm, and grant them success against their enemies.2 They then set forward, accompanied by their ministers, Mr. Andrew Melvil, Mr. Patrick Galloway, and Mr. Wal ter Balcanquel ; and pressing forward to Berwick, met there with the Hamiltons and their forces. These movements could not be concealed ; and the tidings flying quickly into Scotland, became known to the king and the English ambassador at the same moment. It was a stirring and remarkable crisis. James, by this time, was fully aware of the intrigues of Wotton ; and resolving to make him a hostage for his own security, gave orders to seize the ambassador in his house, and carry him with the army, which was then on the point of marching against Morton. Wotton, however, received intimation of his danger : at night-fall he threw himself upon a fleet horse, galloped to Berwick, and from that city wrote, in 1 Copy, State-paper Office, October 12, 1585, Wotton to Walsing ham.

Arran, breaking from his ward, hurried from Kinneil to court, and rushing into the young king's presence, declared that the banished lords were already in Scotland, and rapidly coming forward with their forces; accused the Master of Gray as the author of the whole con spiracy, and urged James to send for him instantly, and put him to death.2 Gray was then absent from court, raising his friends in Perthshire, and was thrown into perplexity and agitation on receiving the king's message. If he disobeyed it, he dreaded the over throw of the plot, and the retreat of Angus and his friends ; if he returned to court, he cast himself within the toils of his mortal enemy Arran. Yet choosing the boldest, which in such a crisis is generally the most successful course, he braved the peril, rode back to court, entered the royal presence, defended himself from the accusation, and was so graciously received, that Arran and his faction had determined, as their last hope, to stab him even in the king's presence,3 when a messenger arrived in fiery haste, with the news that the advanced parties of the banished lords had been seen within a mile of Stirling. They had first met at Kelso, separated to raise their men, con- 1 State-paper Office, October 15, 1585, Berwick, Wotton to Elizabeth ; .same to Walsingham. 2 Relation of the Master of Gray, by Bannatyne Club, p. 59. 3 Ibid."], [457, "1585.

Arran knew that his head was the only mark they shot at ; that he was surrounded by enemies within as well as without the town ; and that his life was not safe for a moment. As the only resource left him, therefore, he fled secretly from Stirling, accompanied by a single horse man. His retreat was followed by the instant occu pation and plunder of the town by Angus and his forces ; whilst Montrose, Crawford, and the other lords of the opposite faction, threw themselves, as their last resource, into the castle ; which (to use the Master of Gray's own expression) was in a manner crammed full of great personages with the king \u2014 some friends, some enemies.1 Preparations for a siege were now commenced ; and the lords had already set up their banners against the \"spur,\" or principal bastion, when the king sent out the Master of Gray7 with a flag of truce, to demand the cause of their coming. They replied, it was to offer their duty to his majesty, and kiss his hands : to which it was answered, that the king was not at that moment solicitous of an \u00a9 interview ; but if they would retire for a brief space, their lands and honours should be restored. Still, however, they insisted on a personal interview, and James declared his readiness to agree to it on three conditions : safety to his own person ; no innovation to be made in the state ; and an assurance for ttn3 lives of such persons as he should name. To the two first they instantly consented ; to the last, they re plied, that as they were the injured persons, and their 1 Relation of the Master of Gray, by Bannatyne Club, p. 60."], [458, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1585. 452 enemies were about the king, they must, for their own security, have them delivered into their hands, with the castles and strengths of the realm.1 This nego tiation, which was conducted by Gray, the arch-con triver of the whole plot, could only terminate in one way. James was forced to submit : the gates were opened ; the Earls of Montrose, Crawford, and Rothes, with Lord Down, Sir AVilliam Stewart, and others, made prisoners; and the banished lords conducted into the king's presence. On their admission, they fell on their knees ; and Lord Arbroath, the head of the house of Hamilton, taking precedency from his near alliance to the crown, entreated his majesty's gracious acceptance of their duty, and declared that they were come in the most humble manner to solicit his pardon. It was strange to see men who, a few hours before, with arms in their hands, had dictated terms of submission to their sovereign, now sue so submissively for mercy : but the scene was well acted on both sides ; and James, an early adept in hypocrisy, performed his part with much address. \" My lord,\" said he to Hamilton, \" I never saw you before ; but you were a faithful servant of the queen my mother, and of all this company have been the most wronged. But for the rest of you, (casting his glance over the circle on their knees,) if you have been exiles, was it not your own fault ? And as for you, Francis, (he continued, turning to Bothwell,) who has stirred up your unquiet spirit to come in arms against your prince ? When did I ever wrong thee ? To you all, who I believe meant no harm to my person, I am ready, remembering nothing that is past, to give my hand and heart ; on one condition, 1 Relation of the Master of Gray.

JAMES VI. 453 however, \u2014 that you carry yourselves, henceforth, as dutiful subjects.\"1 This interview was followed by measures which showed that these apparently submissive lords were not disposed to lose their opportunity. Arran was proclaimed a traitor at the market-place, and in the king's name ; the royal guard altered, and its com mand given to the Master of Glammis ; the castle of Dunbarton delivered to Lord Arbroath ; that of Edin burgh to Coldingkuowes ; Tantallon to Angus ; and Stirling to Mar. On the same day, a pacification and remission was published in favour of the exiles, who now ruled every thing at their pleasure. All faults were solemnly forgiven ; and the whole of the measures lately carried into effect with such speed and success, declared to be done for the king's service.2 Immediately after the seizure of Stirling, the Master of Gray communicated the entire success of the plot to the English court, by letters to the queen herself, Archibald Douglas, and Secretary Walsingham. He assured the English secretary, that the banished men were in as good favour as they ever enjoyed : nothing was now required but that Elizabeth should send au ambassador, and the intended league between the two kingdoms would be concluded without delay.3 The queen, accordingly, despatched Sir William Knolles, who had audience at Linlithgow on the 23d November, and was received by James with much courtesy. The king professed himself to be entirely at her majesty's devotion ; declared he was ready 1 Spottiswood, pp. 342, 343. 2 Relation of the Master of Gray, p. 61. 3 State-paper Office, Master of Gray to Walsingham, November C, 1585."], [460, "454 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 1 585. to join in league with England, both in matters of religion and civil policy ; and that, although at first offended at the sudden invasion of Angus and his friends, he was now satisfied that they sought only their own restitution, and, indeed, had found them so loving and obedient, that he had rather reason to bless God so great a revolution had been effected without bloodshed, than to regret any thing that had happened. Knolles, too, as far as he had an oppor tunity of judging, considered these declarations sin cere. He observed no distrust on the part either of the lords or their sovereign. They kept no guard round him, but suffered him to hunt daily with a moderate train ; and as Arran had fled to the west coast, and Montrose, Crawford, and the rest of that party, were in custody, no fear of change or attack seemed to be entertained.1 Such was Knolles' opinion ; although, in the end of his letter, he hinted that the king might dissemble according to his custom ; a suspicion which next day seemed to have increased.2 Apparently, however, these misgivings were without foundation ; for a par liament assembled shortly after at Linlithgow, in which it was unanimously resolved that there should be a strict league concluded with Elizabeth.3 On this occasion, the king, if we may judge from his address to the three estates, expressed extraordinary devoted ness to England, and the most determined hostility to the Roman Catholics. He alluded to the confe- 1 State-paper Office, Mr. William Knolles to Walsingham, Linlith gow, November 23, 1585. 2 State-paper Office, Knolles to Walsingham, Linlithgow, Nov. 24, 1585. \u00b0 3 State-paper Office, certified copy of the Act of Parliament autho rizing the King of Scots to make league with the Queen's Majesty of England, December 10, 1585."], [461, "1585-6.

These leagues, he observed, were composed of French men and Spaniards, assisted with the money of the King of Spain and the pope, and must be resisted, if Protestants had either conscience, honour, or love of themselves. To this end, he was determined, he said, to form a counter-league, in which he was assured all Christian princes would willingby join ; and as the Queen of England was not only a true Christian princess, but nearest to them of all others, in consan guinity, neighbourhood, and good will, it was his fixed resolution to begin with her.1 To second this, the king despatched Sir William Keith with a friendly message to the English queen, requesting her to send down au ambassador, by whose good offices the pro posed treaty might be carried into effect.;2 and Ran dolph, whose veteran experience in Scottish diplomacy was considered as peculiarly qualifying him for such an errand, was intrusted with the negotiation. He arrived in Edinburgh on the 26th February, having been met at Musselburgh, six miles from the capital, by the justice-clerk, and a troop of forty or fifty gentlemen, many of them belonging to the royal house hold.

An ambassador had been sent from France, and was reported to have brought with him a freight of French crowns. Holt the Jesuit, and other brethren of that order, were still secretly harboured in the north, supported by Huntley, Montrose, Crawford, and other nobles of the Roman Catholic faith ; the agents of the queen-mother were busy with their intrigues, both in Scotland and in Eng land ; and Morton, that powerful baron, whose union with Angus and the Hamiltons had so recently turned the scale against Arran, presuming upon his recent success, openly professed the Roman Catholic faith, and caused mass to be celebrated in the provost church of Lincluden.1 All these were ominous appearances ; and although James had instantly summoned Morton, and impri soned him in Edinburgh castle, yet the king was known to be so great a dissembler, that few trusted his professions. Randolph had been instructed by his royal mistress to congratulate the monarch upon the quiet state of his realm ; to express her willingness to proceed with the treaty, for a firm and lasting religious league be tween the two kingdoms, which had been interrupted ; and to warn him against the intrigues of France.

In return for all this, should it be faithfully performed, Elizabeth declared her readiness to fix a yearly pension on the king, and to grant a solemn promise, under her hand and seal, that she would permit no measures to be brought forward against any title he might pretend to the succession to the English crown.1 On being admitted to an audience, which took place the 3d day after his arrival, Randolph, at first, found nothing but smiles and fair weather at court. The king assured him, that he felt himself bound to the queen his mistress, as strictly as if she were his own sister ; that he esteemed her advice the best he could possibly receive, and meant, God willing, to follow it.2 Having spoken this so loud, that most that stood by could hear it, James, entering into more private talk, told him of the arrival of the French ambassador, and spoke slightingly of his youth and ignorance of Scot land and Scotsmen. This led to some remarks on the house of Guise, and the intrigues of the Jesuits ; to which the king answered, he had but one God to serve ; and as for the Papists, that Morton himself, and some others, would be arraigned within a few days. Before the audience was concluded, Randolph exhibited a little packet, \" curiously sealed and made up,\" which he gallantly pressed to his lips, and de livered to the young monarch. It was a private letter from Elizabeth, which James, stepping aside, read with every appearance of devotion ; and, placing it in his bosom, declared that all his good sister's desires should be fulfilled.3 1 Original draft, State-paper Office, principal points of Mr. Ran dolph's Instructions. 2 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Randolph to (Walsingham?)

These counter intrigues, however, were for the present defeated; and the ambassador, with great address, procured the king's signature to the league with England, and sent Thomas Milles, his assistant and secretary, to present it to Elizabeth for her ratifica tion.1 Milles was, at the same time, instructed to warn the English queen to have special care, at that moment, of her own person ; and to reveal the parti culars of a conspiracy against her, which was then hatching in Scotland. On this delicate point the am bassador wrote both to Burghley and Walsingham : but he referred simply to Milles' verbal report, and added to the English secretary this ominous sentence ; \" The men, and, perchance, the women, are yet living, and their hearts and minds all one, that devised or procured the devilish mischiefs that hitherto, by God's providence, she hath escaped. You have heard, both out of Spain and France, what is to be doubted out of the Low Countries. I have seen what warning hath been given for her majesty to look unto herself; and, in the presence of God, I fear as much despite and devilishness from hence as from them all ; though I judge the king as free as myself, and could himself be content that he were out of this country.\"2 State-paper Office, April 1, 1586, Randolph to Lord Burghley, by Thomas Milles. 2 State-paper Office, Randolph to Walsingham, April 2, 1586."], [465, "1586. JAMES VI. 459 These disclosures of Milles to Elizabeth unfortu nately do not appear ; but there can be no doubt that they were connected with that conspiracy afterwards known as \" Babington's plot.\" It is certain that this plot had its ramifications in Scotland ; that the captive queen had still a powerful party in that kingdom, at the head of which was Lord Claud Hamilton ; and many of her adherents were busily intriguing with France, Spain, and Rome. The league with England was distasteful to Secretary Maitland and a large portion of the nobility. They maintained, and with great appearance of reason, that the king, before he had been so readily induced to sign a treaty of so much importance, ought to have secured some com mercial privileges to his subjects, similar to those enjoyed by them in France ; that Elizabeth should have made some public and explicit declaration re garding their master's title to the English crown ; and that the annuity which he was to receive ought to bear some proportion to the large offers of those foreign princes, which his adherence to England had compelled him to refuse. All this, they said, he had neglected ; and, without consulting his council, had recklessly rushed into a treaty which he would speedily repent.1 This threat seemed prophetic : on Milles' arrival with Elizabeth's signature to the league, James discovered that the pension, which, as first promised by Wotton, amounted to twenty thousand crowns, had dwindled down to four thousand pounds; and the same envoy brought the king a private letter, written with her own hand, in terms of such severe and sarcastic admonition, that it utterly disgusted 1 State- paper Office, Archibald Douglas to Walsingham, May 6, 1586.

This fit of disgust was fostered, as may easily be believed, by Secretary Maitland and his friends ; and it required all the address of Randolph to soften the royal resentment and hold the king to his engagements. At last, however, every thing was arranged, and the ambassador, in a letter to Walsingham, congratulating himself upon a speedy return home, advised this min ister to be careful in the choice of his successor at the Scottish court. \" Your honour knows,\" said he, \" that non ex omni ligno fit Mercurius ; and he has need of a long spoon that feeds with the devil.\" 2 Having procured the young king's signature to the articles of the league, Randolph left the Scottish court ; and in the succeeding month the negotiation was finally concluded by the commissioners of both countries, who met at Berwick.3 In this important treaty, it was agreed between the Queen of England and the Scottish king, that they should inviolably maintain the religion now professed in both countries, against all adversaries, notwithstanding any former engagements to the contrary.

If Ireland should be invaded, all Scottish subjects were to be inter dicted, under pain of rebellion, from passing over into that kingdom. All rebels, harboured within either country, were to be delivered up, or compelled to depart the realm ; no contract was to be made by either of the princes, with any foreign state, to the prejudice of this league ; all former treaties of amity between the predecessors of the two princes were to remain in force ; and on the Scottish king's attaining the age of twenty-five, he engaged that the \" league should be confirmed by parliament ; his sister, the English queen, promising the same for her part.\"1 It will be observed, that all consideration of the condition or interests of the unhappy Queen of Scots is studiously avoided, both by her son and by Elizabeth.

The happy conclusion of this league was a matter of sincere congratulation to the English queen ; but she had intrusted to Randolph another somewhat difficult negotiation. This was to induce James to \u00a9 recall and pardon the well-known Archibald Douglas, whom she had herself recently imprisoned, but who had purchased his freedom by betraying the secrets of the Scottish queen. This gentleman, with whose name and history we are already in some degree familiar, united the manners of a polished courtier to the knowledge of a scholar and a statesman. He was of an ancient and noble house : he had been for years the friend and correspondent of Burghley and Walsingham ; and he was now in great credit with the English queen. But Douglas had a dark as well as a bright side ; and exhibited a contradiction or anomaly in character, by no means unfrequent in those days : the ferocity of a feudal age, gilded, or lacquered over, by7 a thin coating of civilisation. Ex ternally all was polish and amenity; truly and at heart the man was a sanguinary, fierce, crafty, and unscrupulous villain. He had been personally pre sent at Darnley's murder, although he only admitted the foreknowledge of it : he had been bred as a re tainer of the infamous Bothwell : he had afterwards been employed by the Scottish queen, whom he sold to her enemies ; and Elizabeth's great purpose in now interceding for his return from her court to his own country, was to use his influence with the young king against his mother and her faction. He now brought a letter written by that princess to the king in his"], [469, "1586. JAMES VI. 463 favour;1 and it is little to James's credit, that he speedily obtained all he asked. A mock trial was got up, a sentence of acquittal pronounced, and Douglas was not only restored to his estates and rank, but admitted into the highest confidence with the sove reign whose father he had murdered. Nay, strange to tell, James held a secret conversation with him on the dark subject of Darnley's assassination ; and as Douglas instantly sent a report of it to Walsingham, we get behind the curtain. The king commanded all the courtiers to retire ; and, finding himself alone with Douglas, after reading the Queen of England's letter, thus addressed him : \" At your departure, I was your enemy ; and now, at your returning, I am and shall be your friend. You are not ignorant what the laws of this realm are, and what best may agree with your honour to be done for your surety. I must confess her majesty's request in your favour to be honourable and favour able, and your desire to have come by assize2 to be honest ; and I myself do believe that you are innocent of my father's murder, except in foreknowledge and concealing ; an fault so common in those days, that no man of any dealing could misknaw ;3 and yet so perilous to be revealed, in respect of all the actors of that tragedy, that no man, without extreme danger, could utter any speech thereof, because they did see it and could not amend it : and, therefore, I will im pute unto you neither foreknowledge nor concealing ; and desire that you will advise by my secretary what may be most agreeable to my7 honour and your surety 1 MS. draft, State-paper Office, Elizabeth to James, Scottish Royal Letters, April 6, 1586. 2 To have come by assize ; to be tried by a jury. 3 Misknaw ; be ignorant."], [470, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 464 1586 in trial, and it shall be performed.\" 1 These are re markable words, and probably come very near the truth as to the foreknowledge of the king's murder possessed by every man of any note or consequence in the court. It is evident the king kept at a dis tance from all direct mention of his mother's name. The general expressions which he used may either infer that the queen must have known of the intended murder, but could not, without imminent peril, have revealed or prevented it, or that she knew and per mitted it. As to Douglas's own active share in the murder, it was positively asserted by7 his servant on the scaffold, and at a moment when there could be no temptation to deny or disguise the truth, that he was present at the explosion, and returned from it covered with soil and dust. 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, Archibald Douglas to Walsingham, 6th May, 1 586."], [471, "PROOFS AND ILLUSTRATIONS FROM MANUSCRIPTS, IN HER MAJESTY'S STATE-PAPER OFFICE, AND OTHER COLLECTIONS HITHERTO UNPRINTED. 2G VOL.

And by occasion of this speech his grace said moreover to me, how he had sent his resolute mind unto my Lord of Morton by the said abbot touching the great matter ; wherein I found him now very earnest, insomuch that he desired me to write speedily unto both your honours to further the same by all the good means you might, as the best, and as it were, the only salve for the cure of the great sores of this com monwealth. I am also put in good hope of the said abbot that I shall receive a good answer of my Lord of Morton's touching the circum stances, et cetera, which I omit to write till the despatch of my courier, by whom I shall be able to satisfy your honours more at length, having only written thus much, as it were, by the way. \"I perceive the regent's first coldness grew rather for want of skill how to compass so great a matter, than for lack of good-will to exe cute the same.

Bowes to Burghley. 5 \" Edinburgh, April 28, 1578. \" May it please your lordship. \u2014 On Saturday last, about six in the morning, the Earl of Mar, accompanied with the Abbots of Dryburgh and Cambuskenneth, and their servants ordinarily lodged in the castle of Stirling, came to the castle gate, with pretence to go a-hunt ing; and finding there the Master and his servants, the abbots called the Master aside, charging him that he had much abused the Earl of Mar, his nephew, and far overseen himself in withholding the custody of the king and castle from the earl. The Master, after reasonable excuse made, found that they pressed to possess the keys, and com mand the piece ; and reaching himself to an halbert, his servants came 1 As much. 2 Until. 3 Thrown. * State-paper Office. 0 Orig.

Dryburgh and some with him stayed the Master; Cam buskenneth and his complices assaulted the rest ; when Buchanan, one of the Master's men, was sore hurt. After the fray pacified, the master and the abbots withdraw themselves to the hall to debate the matter ; and Argyle being then a-bed, rose speedily, and came with a small number to the hall, where, hearing that the master and the abbots were in quiet communication, he retired himself to his chamber, and, arming himself, he assembled his servants, that with the Master were able to have overmatched the other. But the master being then fully satisfied, Argyle was likewise soon after appeased ; and then yielding possession for the earl, they agreed at length to remove thence, and draw to concord, specially to satisfy the king, who of the tumult, as is reported, was in great fear, and teared his hair, saying the Master was slain. And as I am informed his grace by night hath been by this means so discouraged, as in his sleep he is here with greatly disquieted. After all this was ended, the Earls of Argyle and Mar, the two abbots and Mr. Buchanan,1 advertised by their letters this council of this accident ; declaring that the parties were well reconciled ; and persuaded the council to proceed forwards in the course determined for the government, as no such matter had happened. Argyle departed out of the castle, and he is now gone to levy his forces, meaning to return within two days at the farthest. \" In this uproar, the eldest son of the Master was so crushed in the throng, as he died the next day. The Master is fallen into vehement disease with danger of his life. \" Upon the coming of the said letters from Stirling, on Saturday about nine in the afternoon, the council assembled ; and after some hot humours digested, they despatched Montrose that night towards Stirling, to understand, and certify to them the true state of the matter, to persuade quietness about the king's person, and to continue this present government established until the next parliament. \" Montrose, after long abode at the Lord of Livingston's house, came to Stirling in the next day, and was received into the castle. He putteth the council in good hope that the matter is well pacified, and that this government shall not by this accident be impeached. Whereupon the most part of this council, pretending to have the king's letters commanding their repair to him, are departed this day towards Stirling ; but what shall ensue hereof is greatly doubted. \" Lochleven being speedily advertised of the doings of the abbots, came the same day to Stirling, and with some difficulty (as out wardly was showed) was let into the castle with one servant, whom 1 This was the celebrated Buchanan."], [486, "480 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. presently he returned to Lochleven to the Earl of Morton, and him self remaineth still in the castle. The Earl of Morton, upon the first advertisement, came to Lochleven ; despatched his servant to the Earl of Angus, to put all his friends and forces in a readiness on an hour's warning. And many noblemen, being friends to these two earls, have done the like ; nevertheless they show no force nor assem bly as yet. \" The Lords of the Council have likewise levied all their powers, drawing some part with all possible speed towards Stirling, and leav ing the residue in readiness upon warning. \" Some are of opinion, that the council will be readily received and welcomed to the king and to all the castle, without further change ; and many think that, by the means of the abbots, the king shall cause them to retire to their own houses, till his pleasure be further known ; and in case they disobey the same, then to lay siege and take the castle. That then the king will cause the Earl of Morton and other nobles to levy their power within the realm, to raise the siege, and rescue his person from their violence. What storm shall fall out of these swelling heats doth not yet appear. But I think, verily, and that within two or three days, that it will burst into some open matter, discovering sufficiently the purposes intended ; wherein, to my power, I shall seek to quench all violent rages, and persuade unity and concord among them ; which, if this sudden chance had not happened, might easily have taken place.

Lord Hunsdon's letter from Berwick to Lord Burghley, referred to in the text, and preserved in the British Museum, Caligula, C. v. sol. 101, gives some interesting particulars of the composition between Morton and his powerful opponents. It is as follows : Hunsdon to Burghley. \" Berwick, August 19, 1578. \" My very good Lord, \u2014 I will not trouble your lordship with any long discourse touching this matter in Scotland.\" Hunsdon then refers Burghley to Mr. Bowes' letter, \" who,\" he says, \" has the greatest merit in bringing about peace : otherwise there had been such a slaughter as would not have been appeased in"], [487, "PROOFS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 481 Scotland these many years, \u2014 the malice of the lords and their adherents, especially the wardens of Tevydale and the Merse, and their bands, which was their greatest force against Morton, was so great and so desirous of revenge. They of the Merse made them a standard of blue sarcenet, and in it a child painted within a grate, with this speech out of his mouth, ' Liberty I crave, and cannot it have.' They seemed to answer under it, ' Either you shall have it, or we will die for it ;' so as, though their malice to Morton was their quarrel indeed, yet they made the detaining of the king their colour. \" My Lord, the queen's maj : hath now both sides at her devotion, and the party of Athole and Argyle more in show than the king's ; for the king's side terms the others Englishmen, because they were contented to put the whole of their causes to her majesty ; which the other lords, being required of Mr. Bowes to do the like, Morton utterly refused the same, saying that the K. and his council would end them. But if Mr. Bowes' travel, and some other means, had not taken place, it was very like that Morton had been hard bested ; for although the king's side were something more in number, yet were the others better chosen men, far better horsed and armed, and besides, few of them but, either for their own causes or their friends, bare Morton a deadly hatred and sour desire of revenge, which was but in few of the king's side against any of the other lords. I pray God her majesty do so deal now, having both sides at her devotion, as she may keep them both ; which surely she may easily do if she will. \"The king hath sent her majesty a cast of Falcons.

The King's Recovery of his Liberty in 1583, page 356. In the month of May, 1583, when James was pondering on the plot for the recovery of his liberty, and his escape from the thraldom in which he was kept by the Ruthven lords, there occurs a remark able letter written by Fowler to Walsingham, which shows that the young king had first disclosed his secret intentions to the Master of Glammis. This is strange enough ; for Glammis, as we have seen, (supra, p. 321,) was one of the leaders of the \" Raid of Ruthven.\" The letter is as follows. \u2014 It is preserved in British Museum, Caligula, C. vii. sol. 148 : \u2014 Fowler to Walsingham. \"May, 1583. \" My Lord, \u2014 After my most humble commendations and service, I do send your honour such proofs of my fidelity, that your honour may thereby well judge of my true meaning. The king hath entered in conference with the Master of Glammis after this sort : \u2014 ' I intend to go in progress, and first to Falkland, and thereafter to the Glammis. What think you, Master, \u2014 shall I be welcome ? ' The other answered that his welcome should be better than his majesty's entertainment ; because, saith he, ' I am less able now than I was these five years before :' meaning of his loss and fine of xx. thousand pounds, which he paid, by7 the Duke of Lennox's means, for the killing of the Earl of Crawford's man. The king answered, ' Master, are you not yet contented and sufficiently revenged? If you had not turned that night to Ruthven, these things, which were then devised, would never have taken effect. Well, Master, I will forgive you ; and if you will conform yourself now to my request, your losses shall be faithfully repaired you hereafter.' \u2014 ' Sir,' said he, ' what is your will ? Com mand me in any thing : your majesty shall be obeyed, \u2014 yea, were it in the killing of the best that are about your majesty.' The king answered, ' Master, I mean not so : but because I think it stands not with my honour to be guided by other men's will, I would things were changed, \u2014 which you only may perform, if you follow my device. None mistrusteth you ; and, therefore, I will come to the Glammis, where you may have such power for that effect, that I will remain"], [510, "HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. 504 your prisoner, so that you debar these from me who hath me at their devotion.' To conclude, the other hath agreed thereto, and shall conclude therein, if good counsel prevent it not. \" As these things must come to light, so would I they so should be used, as the chief intelligence should be known not to have corned from hence ; otherwise I shall be suspected, and incur the king's hatred and the Master of Glammis's displeasure.\" No. XIX.

The following letter, from the State-paper Office, relates to this interesting embassy : \u2014 Walsingham to Burghley. \" Edinburgh, 6th September, 1583. \" My very good Lord, \u2014 Since I last wrote unto your lordship I have received three sundry letters from you, by the which I find your lordship hath obtained so much leisure as to see your house at Burghley ; where I could have been content, having finished here, to her majesty's contentment the charge committed to me, to have met your lordship. \u2014 I mean, with the leave of God, according to my pro mise made to Sir Thomas Cecil, to see him there, and to survey such faults as have been committed in your buildings by reason of your lordship's absence ; and yet am I in hope to come time enough in my return to see him at Snape ; for here I see little hope to do any good, so resolutely and violently are they carried into a course altogether contrary to the amity of this crown, which by the better sort is greatly misliked of: and it is thought that they which have the whole managing of the affairs cannot long stand, so hateful do they grow generally to all estates in this realm. \" Though I press my audience very earnestly, yet can they not resolve neither of the time nor place. They are now, as I learn, busily occupied how they may excuse their breaches of promise? and other attempts against her majesty, but most especially how they may excuse the late outrage committed in the middle marches, by yielding fair words and promises for satisfaction.

The ministers, who foresee how greatly the common cause should be shaken if discord between the two nations should break out, will not omit to do their best endeavours to prevent the same. I will not fail, at my access, to press both speedy redress and full satisfaction, as well of that outrage as of divers others committed this last month. * * It shall be necessary for her majesty, in these doubtful times, considering how they stand affected that have now the helm in hand here, to place some horsemen and footmen upon the borders for a season, which may serve well for some other purpose, as your lordship shall hereafter understand. * * * \u2014 At Edinburgh, the 6th September, 1583. \" Your lordship's, &c. \" Francis Walsingham. \"After I had written my letter, Mr. James Melvil came unto me from the king to excuse the delay of my audience, without bringing any certain knowledge when the 6ame should be granted, which moved me to deal roundly with him.\" END OF VOL.
