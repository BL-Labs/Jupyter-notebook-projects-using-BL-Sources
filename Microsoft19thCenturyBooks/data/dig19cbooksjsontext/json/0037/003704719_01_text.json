The following Poem is intended to illustrate some of the most remarkable parts of the region, to which, from the gratification they have afforded me, I may apply (as Pliny the Younger did to the Larian, or the Lake of Como, not unaptly compared to the one I have attempted to celebrate) the epithet of niece delicice. \" The Lakes of Westmorland and Cumberland,\" says Eustace,* \" are to England what those of the Milanese are to Italy.\" Yet none of our ancient Poets have noticed their distant beauties. They still remain unsung and unconsecrated in classic story. One of the Scottish Lakes has lately been more for tunate. Yet, who ever heard of Loch Katrine till the Minstrel peopled its lonely isle with phantoms of valour and of beauty ? And^sweetly o'er the Lake was heard his strain Mix'd with the sounding harp. Lady of the Lake. With respect to the present undertaking to remove the neglect with which such interesting scenes have been treated, however little I may have succeeded * Classical Tour through Italy"], [10, "IV PREFACE. in it, I can with truth declare that what I have asserted in the text is not a mere fiction ; of the affection which at a distance I cherished for these scenes, and of my having settled among them in the very Residence that was so attractive to my fancy, and whose anticipated pleasures, evinced by the test of so many years, have so fully answered to the expectations, and proved so congenial to the wishes of my heart. To elucidate the allusions to the scenery, the sub joined extracts are quoted fromXicolson's and Burn's History of Westmorland and Cumberland :* \u2014 \" A considerable part of Ulleswater, from the middle eastward, is within the manor of Barton. It has its name probably from Ulf, a name frequent in old time : Lyulf (L'Ulf ), was the first baron of Graystock, to whom this lake did belong. It is a large mere, of seven or eight miles in length, and of a great breadth and depth .... The water which supplies this lake, at its highest source, springs at Kirkstonfell, in the manor of Hartsop. Thence it runs, on the east side of Hartsop- hall, into a lough, about a quarter of a mile over, called Broad-water, bearing the name of Hartsop beck till it comes there ; and further (after having received Haiswater) till it be out of Hartsop lordship. Then it receives Deepdale beck, which comes eastward into it, and some other rills, and from thence carries the name of Deepdale beck till it \u2022Vol. 1. p. 407"], [11, "PREFACE. V comes to Goldrel bridge near Patterdale chapel, where Grisedale beck comes in from the west, and there it receives the name of Eamont. Thence it runs north ward about a quarter of a mile into this great lake. In the course of which lake there are three remark able islands: 1. Cherry Island, so called from a cherry-tree anciently growing there, distant from the head of Ulleswater about a mile and a half : 2. Wall Holme, over against Stybarrow, so called from having been anciently walled about, distant from Cherry Island about two bowshots : 3. House Holme, about a quarter of a mile below, so called probably from some house thereon formerly. From hence the water turns in a bow above two miles to a crag near How Down. Thence directly northwest to Dun Mallard, three miles in length and in breadth near one mile. And there the lake ending, the river reassumes its name ; and so, running by Sockbridge, Yanwath, Brougham Castle, and Hornby, it empties itself into the river Eden . . . Descending by the water from Hartsop we come to Patterdale, so called probably from St. Patrick, to whom the chapel seems to be dedicated. For in the bishop's register it is called Patrickdale, on the admission of Adam Abbot to be curate as aforesaid. And nigh unto the chapel is a well called St. Patrick's Well . . . The hall belongs to Mr. John Mounsey, whose ancestors purchased the same from the Threlkelds, in whom it had continued for many generations. This Mr. Mounsey and his"], [12, "VI PREFACE. forefathers for time immemorial have been called kings of Patterdale, living as it were in another world, and having no one near them greater than themselves. . . North from the hall is a little gill called Glenridden ; from the Scotch word glen, which sig nifies a gill or hollow, and Ridden the name of the river which runs there with a precipitous course into Ulleswater. Near to Glenridden lieth Glencune, a little farther to the north, as much as to say, a glen in a corner; cune, coyn, or corner, being one and the same thing. Nigh the chapel, towards the west, lies a little hollow or gill, which they call Grisedale. Grise is a common name for swine, and it may well seem to have taken its name from being frequented by wild boars, which are beasts of the forest. Unto which the large rock called Stybarrow, on the west side of Ulleswater may have some allusion. And, perhaps, there have been deer also in this dale, for there is a place in it called Glemara Park. In the head of the dale is a rocky mountain, called Eagles crag; and eagles to this day frequent and breed in the mountains thereabouts .... Martindale is so de nominated probably from another species of beasts, namely, the martern, valuable for its fur. . . Here is a kind of forest replenished with red and fallow-deer, and there are tenants who are bound to assist the lord in hunting and turning the red deer on the tops of the mountains to the forest, whom they call strones. . . Pooley, a village at the foot of Ulleswater,"], [13, "PREFACE. VII taketh its name undoubtedly from that great pool or lake. It is pleasantly situate, having, besides the embellishments of wood and water, a great accession of beauty from Dun-mallard hill, (so called from the resort thither of wild fowl from the lake) .... Unto this hill Pooley is connected by an handsome stone bridge lately erected.\" From the above cited work the following account is taken, in explanation of the time and action of the Poem, where the Vision has been introduced : \u2014 \" Here are large remains of the ancient feudal policy, which was kept up here after it had ceased elsewhere, by reason of the particular military service against the Scots. The lands at first were granted out in large districts by William the Conqueror and his successors to certain great Norman barons. These parcelled them out to inferior lords ; who again granted the same to individuals, each man having a portion of land assigned to him for the sustentation of the military character. And they seem to have extended this regulation as far as it would go.\" Among the great Norman lords, who followed Wil liam the Conqueror to this Country, was Ranulph de Meschines. \" This Barony (Graystock), the Earl Ranulph de Meschines gave to one Lyolf or Lyulphe, and King Henry the First confirmed the same unto Phorne, son of the said Lyulphe, whose posterity took their surname of the place and were called de Graystock.\""], [14, "PREFACE.

In memory of this remark able chase, the hart's horns were fixed upon this tree, whence it obtained its name ; and, as all extraordinary events were in those days recorded in rhymes, we find the following popular one upon this occasion, from which we learn the dog's name likewise : \u2014 Hercules kill'd Hart of Greece, And Hart of Greece kill'd Hercules This story appears to be literally true, as the Scots preserve it without any variation, and add, that it happened in the year 1333 or 1334, when Edward Baliol, King of Scots, came to hunt with Robert de Clifford in his domains at Appleby and Brougham. I camiot, however, help thinking the Countess is mistaken in calling the dog a greyhound, as he must have run upwards of eighty miles, even supposing the deer to have taken the direct road ; and this no one, who is acquainted with the nature of dogs, can suppose a greyhound capable of performing.\" \u2014 Clarke's Survey of the Lakes, p. 3.

Their engagement often lasts half an hour, and they frequently break their horns, sometimes near the head, or near the middle : whichever is conquered generally flies his country seve ral miles, often crossing Ullswater, and never again returning ; the other then reigns sovereign of both herds, and unites them as a conquered country to his own.

And of the marvels which the mist has wrought Upon our waters. \" Walking by the side of Ullswater, upon a calm September morning, I saw, deep within the bosom of the lake, a magnificent castle, with towers and battlements; nothing could be more dis tinct than the whole edifice ; after gazing with delight upon it for some time, as upon a work of enchantment, I could not but regret that my previous knowledge of the place enabled me to account for the appearance. It was in fact the reflection of a pleasure-house, called Lyulph's Tower, the towers and battle ments magnified and so much changed in shape as not to be imme diately recognized. In the meanwhile, the pleasure-house itself was altogether hidden from my view by a body of vapour stretch ing over it and along the hill-side on which it stands, but not so to have intercepted its communication with the lake ; and hence this novel and most impressive object, which, if I had been a stranger to the spot, would, from its being inexplicable, have long detained the mind in a state of pleasing astonishment. \" An appearance of this kind, acting upon the credulity of early ages, may have given birth to the stories of subaqueous pa laces, gardens, and pleasure-grounds, the brilliant ornaments of Romance."], [278, "254 NOTES \"With this inverted scene I will couple a much more extraor dinary phenomenon, which may show how other elegant fancies may have had their origin less in invention than in the actual processes of Nature. \" About eleven o'clock on the forenoon of a winter's day, coming suddenly, in company of a friend, into view of the Lake of Gras mere, we were alarmed by the sight of a newly-created island ; the transitory thought of the moment was, that it had been produced by an earthquake, or some other convulsion of nature. Recovering from the alarm, which was greater than the reader can possibly sympathize with, but which was shared to its full extent by my companion, we proceeded to examine the object before us. The elevation of this new island exceeded considerably that of the old one, its neighbour ; it was likewise larger in circumference, comprehending a space of about five acres ; its surface rocky, speckled with snow, and sprinkled over with birch-trees ; it was divided towards the south from the other island by a narrow frith, and in like manner from the northern shore of the lake : on the east and west it was separated from the shore by a much larger space of smooth water. \" Marvellous was the illusion ! Comparing the new with the old island, the surface of which is soft, green, and unvaried, I do not scruple to say that, as an object of sight, it was much the more distinct.

I have witnessed many tremendous thunder-storms among the Alps, and the most glorious effects of light and shadow ; but I never happened to be present when any Lake was agitated by those hurricanes which I imagine must often torment them.

Notwithstanding these horrors and difficulties, she preserved and effected her escape ; and to this day the place has retained the name of the Maiden's Step.

And, during the time of the Saxons in England before the Norman conquest, there was a famous warrior of the name of Uchtred, sou of Waltheof, Earl of Northumberland, who, with a much infe rior army, gave the Scots under their King Malcolm a most signal overthrow; for which victory King Ethelred gave to Uchtred his daughter, the Princess Elgiva, in marriage, and with her the counties of Northumberland and York for portion.

The same, that moves the troops round Souter Fell. \" Opposite the nine mile-post (in the road from Penrith to Keswick), on the right hand, is Southerfell ; rather smoother than its neighbours, and remarkable for an extraordinary pheno menon, which perhaps can scarcely be paralleled by history, or reconciled to probability : such, however, is the evidence we have of it, that I cannot help relating it, and then my readers must judge for themselves. I shall give it nearly in the words of Mr. Lancaster, of Blakehills, from whom I had the account; and whose veracity, even were it not supported by many concurrent testimonies, I could fully rely upon. The story is as follows : \u2014 'On the 23d of June, 1744, his father's servant, Daniel Stricket (who now lives under Skiddow, and is an auctioneer), about half past seven in the evening was walking a little above the house. Looking round him, he saw a troop of men on horseback riding on Southerfell-side (a place so steep that a horse can scarcely travel on it at all), in pretty close ranks, and at a brisk walk. Stricket looked earnestly at them some time before he durst ven ture to acquaint any one with what he saw, as he had the year before made himself ridiculous by a visionary story, which I beg leave here also to relate : \u2014 He was at that time servant to John Wren, of Wiltonhill, the next house to Blakehills ; and, sitting one evening after supper* at the door along with his master, they saw a man with a dog pursuing some horses along Souther fell-side ; and they seemed to run at an amazing pace, till they got out of sight at the low end of the Fell. This made them * It is a custom with the shepherds here to sup by daylight half the year ; in consequence of which they sup about eight in the summer, and at or before six in winter."], [286, "262 NOTES resolve to go next morning to the place to pick up the shoes which they thought these horses must have lost in galloping at such a furious rate; they expected likewise to see prodigious grazes from the feet of these horses on the steep side of the mountain, and to find the man lying dead, as they were sure he run so fast that he must kill himself. Accordingly they went, but, to their great surprise, found not a shoe, nor even a single vestige of any horse having been there, much less did they find the man lying dead as they expected. This story they some time concealed ; at length, however, they ventured to tell it, and were, as might be expected, heartily laughed at. Stricket, conscious of his former ridiculous error, observed these aerial troops some time before he ventured to mention what he saw : at length, fully satisfied that what he saw was real, he went into the house, and told Mr. Lancas ter he had something curious to show him. Mr. Lancaster asked what it was ? adding, ' I suppose some bonfire ? ' (for it was then, and still is, a custom, for the shepherds, on the evening before St. John's day, to light bonfires, and vie with each other in having the largest). Stricket told him, if he would walk with him to the end of the house, he would show him what it was. They then went together ; and, before Stricket spoke or pointed to the place, Mr. Lancaster himself discovered the phenomenon, and said to 'Stricket, 'Is that what thou hast to show me?' \u2014 ' Yes, Master,' replied Stricket: c do you think that you see as I do?' They found that the)' did see alike, so they went and alarmed the family, who all came, and all saw this strange phenomenon. These visionary horsemen seemed to come from the lowest part of Souther Fell, and became visible first at a place called Knott ; they then moved in regular troops along the side of the Fell, till they came opposite Blakehills, when they went over the mountain : thus they described a kind of curvilineal path upon the side of the Fell, and both their first and last appearances were bounded by the top of the mountain. Frequently the last, or last but one, in a troop (always either the one or the other), would leave his place, gallop to the front, and then take the same pace"], [287, "NOTES 263 with the rest, a regular swift walk : these changes happened to every troop (for many troops appeared), and oftener than once or twice, yet not at all times alike. The spectators saw all alike the same changes, and at the same time, as they discovered by asking each other questions as any change took place. Nor was this wonderful phenomenon seen at Blakehills only ; it was seen by every person at every cottage within the distance of a mile ; neither was it confined to a momentary view, for, from the time that Stricket first observed it, the appearance must have lasted at least two hours and a half, viz. from half past seven till the night coming on prevented the farther view ; nor yet was the distance such as could impose rude resemblances on the eyes of credulity : Blakehills lay not half a mile from the place where this astonishing appearance seemed to be, and many other places where it was likewise seen are still nearer. Desirous of giving my readers every possible satisfaction, I procured the following attestation signed by Mr. Lancaster and Stricket : \u2014 ' We, whose names are hereunto subscribed, declare the above account to be true, and that we saw the phenomena as here related.

There is a tradition that this chapel served both sides of the water, and that they passed over in boats. \" An anecdote took its rise at this chapel, which is so whim sical that I cannot help relating it. At a little distance from the chapel is a hill, commonly known by the name of the Priest's Crag; it was formerly covered with wood of different kinds, and was about one hundred and twenty years ago the common resort of the country-people for hunting, gathering nuts, and other diversions ; these they put in practice on the Sunday, to the great disturbance of the congregation, as their shouting, swearing, and squalling, were very distinctly heard in the chapel. This roused the pious wrath of the minister, Mr. Dawson, who accordingly one Sunday reproved them in these words : \u2014 * Oh ye wicked of Water Millock and ye perverse of New Kirk, ye go a-hunting, a-roving, and a-nutting on the Sabbath-day, but, on my soul, if you go any more, I '11 go with you ! ' The parson was a keen hunter, and his expression of / '11 go with you, (which in this country's dialect is a mere threatening phrase) striking some of the more waggish of his hearers in a double sense, the sermon and its author made such a noise, that it came to the ears of Rainbow, Bishop of Carlisle. The Bishop upon this, with the concurrence of the Duke of Norfolk, ordered the wood to be cut down ; this put an end to the profanations there carried on : but the appella tion of the wicked of Water Millock sticks to the inhabitants of that place till this day. \" Next sail past Skelly-Neb, towards the mountain Hallin, and at or near Geordy Crag fire your guns, taking notice to point them towards Gowbarrow Hall, or a little above it.

The boat may go close to it, as at fourteen yards from the shore there is twenty-six fathom water, and the face of the rock is nearly perpendicular. Cavities of this kind are not unfrequent in rapid torrents subject to frequent floods, or in large falls of water ; and these are occasioned by the rolling of stones, which are always found in them ground as if done by an artist : but here not one of these circumstances takes place, and on that account this rock may safely be ranked among our natural curiosities. \" Next proceed to a little bay in Hallin Hag, where the painter will meet with employment for his pencil in two most beautiful landscapes.\" \u2014 Clarke's Survey, p. 26.

Stanza xxvi, Page 188. Long Meg and all her Daughters. Mr. Hutchinson, in his History of Cumberland, (quoted by Green in his Guide, v. 2. p. 414), thus describes this ancient monument: \u2014 \"It forms nearly an exact circle of three hundred and fifty paces in circumference of massy stones, most of which remain standing upright. These are sixty-seven in number, of various qualities and species, not hewn or touched with a tool ; and their form shows they were gathered from the surface of the earth: some are of blue and grey limestone, some flint, but most of them are granites ; many of those that are standing measure from twelve to fifteen feet in girt, and ten feet in height, others much less in size. At the southern side of this circle, about the distance of seventeen paces from its nearest part, is an upright column, naturally of a square form, of red freestone, with which the country abounds, and of which there is a fine quarry, known to the Romans, at Crawdundale, not many miles distant from this monument. This stone is placed with one of its angles towards the circle, is near fifteen feet in girt and eighteen feet in height, each angle of its square answering to a cardinal point of the compass. In that part of the circle which is most contiguous"], [292, "268 NOTES to the column four large stones form a square figure, as if they had supported some table-stone, or had enclosed a space more particularly kept holy than the rest. Towards the east, west, and north, two stones of great magnitude are placed in the circle, at a greater distance from each other than those in other parts, as if intended especially for entrances into this mystic round. What creates great astonishment to the spectator is, that the whole face of the adjacent country does not show any stones of the like mag nitude or quality ; and how such immense bodies could be moved, in an age when little of the mechanical powers (except the force of the lever) were known in this country, is not to be conceived.\" Concerning its origin and uses he enters into a laborious investi gation of the opinions of various writers, and concludes as follows : \" Upon the whole, after a full consideration and comparison of all that has now been quoted, together with all that we have else where read or have seen, we are free to give it as our opinion, though with all becoming deference to the opinions of the learned authors whose works we have mentioned, that Long Meg and her Daughters, the greatest and most extraordinary piece of anti quity, we believe, in the world of its kind, was solely adapted to offices of law, a court of judicature, and place of public assem bly for the dispensing of justice. Stonehenge and Anbury mo numents are of different natures, derived from different periods of time, and originally appropriated to different uses. These Druidical remains we conceive were after the Hebrew mode, rude and unhewn masses of stone, placed in a circular order, as an em blem of the eternal existence of the Deity. * And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shal t not build it of hewn stone, for if thou lift up thy tool upon it thou hast polluted it.' \u2014 Exodus, 20, verse 25. As we incline to adopt the rule of the Hebrews for these erections, we would further observe, that in the passage of Jordan they raised their monuments in number according to the tribes, each tribe a column. We conceive the number of stones in the circle before us denotes the number of delegates, who, from their"], [293, "N OTES. 269 several districts and tribes, were members of the convention held hi this place, a Druid to each pillar ; distinguishing at the same time how many tribes were amenable to this court of judicature. The Druids had other consecrated places for their religious duties, high places, the summits of lofty eminences, shaded with groves of oaks, surrounded by several fences, encinctures resembling those of Sinai, of divine description. In these courts of justice, they began every public act with the previous solemnities of prayer, sacrifice lustration, and other religious rites. If there really ever has been a hollow or bason on the top of the chief column, called Meg, perhaps incense was burnt therein, or the sacred fire was exhibited whilst the sacrifice was preparing or the criminals tried before the people. Such was the power of the Druids that they retained the whole legislative authority. The principle that pervaded all their doctrines was this \u2014 that all law was from Heaven, and that, as a divine thing, it solely was the office of the priests to dispense justice.\" Stanza xvii, Page 225.
