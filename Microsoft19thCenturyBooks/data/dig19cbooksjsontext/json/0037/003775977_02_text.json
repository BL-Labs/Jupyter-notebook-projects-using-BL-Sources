Some little peculiarity as to the manner in which the property of the Harlands had been invested, obliged George to run down to \"Wallingford. \"When he reached the bank, it was late in the day, and he could not see the manager till the following morning. There was no conveyance to Merton after mid-day, and he determined therefore to stay at one of the inns, and settle the busi ness on hand. VOL. II D"], [10, "2 MARTYRS TO FASHION. It was market day, and he had some difficulty in finding a bed. At length, however, he obtained accommodation at a quiet inn, on the outskirts of the town, and feeling weary, went to bed at once. One thing had struck him as singu lar when he enquired at the bar. The host had conferred for a considerable time with some one in an inner room. Then, having told him in a dubious, undecided sort of Avay that he could be accommodated, the chambermaid brought a light and sho\\\\red him the room. George noticed that the girl surveyed him curiously, and when he asked her some trifling question, answered him in a vasrue and reserved manner. How ever, the room was clean, and the bed Avas soft, and without thinking further about the matter, he flung himself into"], [11, "A MYSTERY. 3 bed, and in less than two minutes was asleep. He had slept for a considerable time, when he was aroused by a singular sound, which, as it ceased the moment he aAVoke, he fancied at first was only a dream. He sat up in bed, annoyed that he could not sleep, and believing that his supposed dream was the result of fatigue, he listened for a long time, but could hear nothing, and was just' dropping off again, with the delicious feeling that he had still some hours undisturbed before him, when the noise which he had before attributed to some dreaming fancy, became distinctly audible. At first it came from a room above him, and was evidently produced by heavy, irregular steps, immediately overhead. There was nothing extra ordinary in this, if the steps had been b2"], [12, "4 MARTYRS TO FASHION. regular, but the movement had a capricious character, as of some one under the influence of a strong passion, or suffering from intense pain. He even thought after a time that the action somewhat resembled the pace of a Avild beast, but the idea of a wild beast being kept in an upper room of a country inn did not seem at all feasible, and he dismissed the notion with a smile, and sought some neAv interpretation. George began to despair of the sound sleep he had anticipated, and wished most heartily that the eccentric stranger Avould cease from his nocturnal prome nade, and give him another chance of a nap, when he was startled to hear some one passing and repassing the door of his room, in an aAvkAvard, irregular manner. Then it seemed to"], [13, "5 A MYSTERY. him that a hand Avas draAvn in an uncertain way along the thin wooden partition, which separated the room from the passage without. It was evident that the hand vvas groping about to find the handle of George's door, and he conjectured that the intruder must have been without a light, or he Avould have discovered it in a moment. George was certainly curious as to Avhat this could mean, but he decided quickly that it must be some merry making farmer coming home a little fuddled, who had mistaken his way in the darkness. He now remembered, to his great annoyance, that he had forgotten to lock his door, and jumping hastily out of bed to repair the error, found that the key was left on the outside, and then too came the thought"], [14, "6 MARTYRS TO FASHION. that the intruder might not be quite harmless in his intentions. He Avas about to open the door and take the key inside, but the chance of a blow on the head made hirn hesitate, having nothing Avith which to defend himself, in case of being attacked. While he still hesitated, a scratching noise upon the panels of the partition again called up the idea of a wild beast. But irritated with suspense, George determined to open the door, and discover the cause of this intrusion. He began to open it cautiously, so that he might not be taken by sur prise, when it was suddenly pushed inward with considerable violence, and the tall, dusky figure of a man was dimly seen standing in the centre of the open doorway. George was puzzled how to act. If"], [15, "7 A MYSTERY. he assumed the offensive, he might only inflict injury upon some harmless fellow, who had blundered through taking a drop too much. It Avas too dark to see the features of the stranger, so that George Avas ignorant whether his intentions Avere fair or otherwise. The size and apparent strength of the stranger gave him little hope of being able to expel him by force, while, unless he did something, George felt that he would be completely in the stanger's power, if he intended mis chief. During this momentary hesitation, the man neither spoke nor moved,. The uncertainty which influenced George for the moment, was now, however, changed to a feeling of alarm, when he perceived the man walk coolly to the end of the passage leading from"], [16, "8 MARTYRS TO FASHION. his room, and opening a window, call softly to some one beneath. If any answer was made, the distance was too great for George to hear. Having secured the key, and placed it in the inside of the door, he waited a moment, filled with a strange curiosity as to his visitor's movements and intentions. It seemed that his calling from the window had met with no response, for the man sat doAvn upon the floor, and waited as though for an accomplice. All, however, remained perfectly still, and the moon, which had now risen, threw its pallid light upon this strange rigid figure, whose back was turned towards George, and whose fixed attitude was like that of some hideous god in the shrine of an Indian temple. It was not easy to believe that such strange behaviour as this, at such a"], [17, "9 A MYSTERY. time of the night, boded any good to George Harland. Yet it seemed strange that a powerful man like this, if he intended mischief, had not attacked him at once when he opened the door. George stood there watching him till his patience was nearly exhausted, when he once more opened the window, and called as before. He fancied that this was probably a signal agreed upon, and began to consider in what way he could defend himself, when the stranger turned suddenly, and immediately walked to ward his room. George stepped quickly inside, and was in the act of shutting the door, when the stranger stopped mechanically, and went back toward the the window. , Taking advantage of this extraordinary promenade, George dressed himself as quickly as possible, seeing that any"], [18, "10 MARTYRS TO FA.SHI0N. attempt to sleep Avas out of the question. He had locked the door for the moment, but noAv re-opened it, as he could not restrain his curiosity. To his surprise, when he looked out again, he saAV the man shake his head, as though from disappointment, and then proceed slowly down stairs. Strangely enough, during all these movements, George had never once caught a glimpse of his face. When he had confronted him at the open bedroom door, it was too dark to distinguish anything, and afterwards, when he had gone to the window, the distance was too great to perceive more than the merest outline of his form. When George heard his heavy sham bling footsteps echoing doAvn the stairs? an irresistible impulse impelled him to follow, augmented by a curiosity which"], [19, "11 A MYSTERY. he felt wholly unable to repress. He had never in his life experienced such a singular influence. So strong was its power, that had death awaited him in the track of this mysterious unknown, George would have followed without hesitation. Slowly and mechanically he strode down the stairs, and opened the front door of the inn, with the greatest facility. A sudden thought came into George's mind that this strange person must be a sleep-walker. He had heard strange tales of such people, and felt himself more than ever bound to follow him. But again his first idea that the man was in concert with thieves re turned to him, and he felt glad to get out of the house. The man passed through the open door, without attempting to close it, or"], [20, "12 MARTYRS TO FASIIION, to look behind him, and stood for a second or tAvo in the road, as though undecided which way he should turn. There was not a soul abroad besides themselves, as the stranger, muttering some unintelligible words, turned toAvards the river. Softly drawing the door a little closer, George did not attempt to fasten it, in order that he might have the chance of entering it again, in case of need. He was anxious also not to make a noise to attract the stranger's attention, as he was already in imminent fear of his turning round and discovering that he was followed. The man had not proceeded far, when he stopped suddenly in an open space, where the moonlight streamed brilliantly upon him, and threw the deep shadow of his tall figure upon the ground."], [21, "A MYSTERY. 13 Bending over this shadoAv, he made a movement which filled George with horror, and convinced him at once that some vile deed was upon the point of being put into execution. Flinging out his arms, as though he grasped some imaginary foe, he seemed to fight the air, as Macbeth clutched the visionary dagger, and then, with a stamp of defiance, and a terrific howl, which died away in a grim chuckle, suggest ing the mocking laughter of a fiend, rather than anything human, he dashed forward at such a rapid pace, that George had the greatest difficulty in keeping up writh him. For the first time since their strange companionship, George saw the face of the unknoAvn, and then the terrible truth wrhich he just began vaguely to suspect, became fully revealed. The"], [22, "14 MARTYRS TO FASHION. Avild light flaming from his eyes, the incoherent sound of his voice, his un decided manner, the awful air of reck lessness with which he shook his fist at the calm sky, as though defying heaven and earth to hinder his purpose, filled George with an indefinable sense of horror. The whole secret of all this singular conduct needed no further ex planation. This was a madman. Whether stricken suddenly with this terrible affliction \u2014 Avhether some dire calamity had befallen him, and in a moment had tottered reason from its throne \u2014 or whether the curse had smit ten him in his cradle, and he had uoav escaped from a life-long confinement, f*o revenge himself on his captors, it was impossible to divine. With the conviction that some dark mystery, some strange crime was one"], [23, "15 A MYSTERY. day to be revealed, by this singular in cident, George followed the madman without further hesitation. These proceedings had occupied a considerable time, and George still followed the stranger cautiously. They were clear of the town, having crossed the bridge over the Thames, and pro ceeded for some distance into the open country, without meeting anyone, when they reached a secluded lane, down which the madman turned unhesita tingly, and continued his rapid pace, till he reached a villa, standing someAvhat removed from the road. Apparently bent upon some decided purpose, he strode up the path leading to the house, and knocked violently at the door. It was evidently the home of a per son of cultivated tastes, the garden was in perfect order, and filled with the"], [24, "16 MARTYRS TO FASHION. choicest flowers, which Avith the night dew still upon them, scented the keen morning air deliciously. The beauty and peacefulness of the scene, impressed George deeply, especially as it seemed so completely in contrast with the manner of the person seeking admission to the house. Taking advantage of the number of trees and shrubs, George easily secreted himself, and awaited the result. A deeper feeling than mere curiosity filled him now, for he could not but believe that danger A^as at hand, and felt it his duty to watch the madman closely, and if possible, frustrate his design. The madman knocked repeatedly without awakening anybody, but at length the door was opened. George went nearer to the house, to render assistance if needed, but the peculiar"], [25, "A MYSTERY. 17 cunning of lunacy made it very un certain what the next step might be. The person Avho came to the door was a man probably about forty years of age, of gentlemanly exterior, and com manding appearance, but George per ceived in a moment that he Avas greatly alarmed by the presence of this unwelcome visitor, and unc3rtain how to act. He looked at the madman quickly from head to foot, in order apparently to satisfy himself that he AAras unarmed. George could perceive that they Avrere old acquaintances, and the first words that Avere spoken shoAved that the owner of the house had been accustomed to deal with the madman. He said, with an effort to be as calm and cool as possible\u2014 \" So you have come to breakfast AA'ith me.\" VOL. II. c"], [26, "18 MARTYRS TO FASHION. \" I shall breakfast with the devil,\" was the strange reply. \"Indeed, but you have started very early.\" \"Not at all, but I intend you to breakfast first Avith the angels.\" George saw the first speaker was alarmed, and he would gladly have stepped forward to assure him of assistance, but he feared to precipitate the scene which was evidently coming. He thought it possible also that the gentleman had assistance in the house. \" If you are about to introduce me to such high society, I had better at once change my dress.\" \"No,\" said the madman, fiercely, \" your dress is not of the slightest consequence.\" i ) George thought the oAvner of the house spoke Avith a foreign accent, and"], [27, "19 A MYSTERY. a few more words confirmed the sup position. \"Allow me,\" said he with the greatest composure he could assume, \" to leave a little message for Madame Santi, and I shall be quite ready,\" and he turned to enter the house, when with a sudden fierce grip, the madman caught the Italian by the collar of his coat, and tore him out of the doorway. \" You shall come with me, and that instantly,\" said the madman, and with out more ado he dragged the Italian, shuddering like an aspen, in his terrific clutch down the garden path and into the lane. Without losing a moment, George followed them till they reached a deep black pool by the roadside, where the Avater was dammed up to increase the supply of a water-mill, AA'hich stood in c 2"], [28, "20 MARTYRS TO FASHION. a picturesque situation, a little loAver down. Years before, George had sketched the spot, little dreaming of the strange scene he Avould see enacted there. Upon reaching the verge of the pool, the madman stopped, and turning to the Italian, said, Avith a hideous laugh \u2014 \" There are the angels, they are waiting for you,\" and he made a lunge, as though to tkroAV the Italian into the pool. With the quickness of his country, he contrived, by a sudden movement to free himself for a moment. His escape however was but temporary, and he had scarcely got twenty yards from the pool, when the madman noAv lashed by ex citement and opposition into ungovernable fury, rushed at him, and then Ayith a horrible yell, dragged him to the edge of the mill-dam."], [29, "21 A MYSTERV. The time had come for George to act, if at all. The danger AAas considerable, for the size and strength of the madman Avere such, that he feared, even with his assistance, the Italian Avould hardly escape Avith his life. There was not a moment to lose, and tearing a stick from the hedo-e near him, he rushed toAvards them. The Italian seemed paralyzed, but quickly perceiving that George intended to assist him, he recovered his courage, and Avith desparate energy defended himself against his foe, Avho Avas noAv sAviftly dragging him away. George had now reached the spot, prepared for a tremendous encounter, but the suddenness Avith which he had come upon the scene, had the effect of divert ing the maniac's ideas. He immediately relaxed his hold of the Italian, and after"], [30, "22 MARTYRS TO FASHION. a vacant stare, strangely at variance with the fiendish energy he had exhi bited a moment before, turned, leaped a ditch by the wayside, crossed a neigh bouring meadoAv, chuckling hideously to himself as he went, and then disappeared. George accompanied the Italian back to the villa, frequently glancing round to see that the madman was not follow ing them. The Italian did not speak for some time, and seemed greatly agitated. When they reached the house, however, he thanked George warmly for the assistance he had rendered. George was curious to know something of the connexion between the Italian and the madman, but he was not com municative upon the subject at first. After a time he said \u2014 \" I have had charge of this man two years, and I have often been in fear of"], [31, "23 A MYSTERY. my life. What may become of him now, or how he managed to stay at the inn, I do not know. Most likely he was quiet when he Avent there, and tried to make them believe he Avas wrongly confined. Yes, it must have been so, for the people of that inn have been curious about us here. He has been so calm lately, that Ave have had but one man to attend him, and yesterday after noon, while walking in the garden, he knocked the keeper down, and made off, but I did not imagine he was so near. My greatest fear Avas that he had gone to the Manor at Merton.\" The Manor at Merton !\" cried George with astonishment. \" What on earth should he want there ?\" \"Hush, my good friend,\" said the Italian, in a Avhisper, \"You haAre saved my life this day, and may the"], [32, "24 MARTYRS TO FASHION. Holy Mother reward you, but not a word of this, as a man of. honor.\" \" If by speaking of this strange incident I should be likely to injure you, I Avill most assuredly be silent,\" George ansAvered, \" but Avhen I tell you that I am a native of Merton, you will not wonder at my being astonished.\" \" There are secrets, my gracious preserver \u2014 there are secrets I am bound by sacred vows never to reveal. The man I serve rescued me from an Italian prison, from which I should have been taken in another day to death. My crime Avas that I loved my country. My friend also dreAV a sword for my beloved Italy. I am bound to him for life.\" \" But if this man reaches the Manor, ay hat then ?\" \" Hush, my good friend.

We are too well knoAvn, and this is the second time he has escaped. Will you go back to the inn ?\" \" Yes, I think so,\" George answered, \"but why?\" \" As a gentleman, give me your word not to repeat Avhat I have said.\" George considered a moment before he gave this promise. What if some deed of villany might be brought to light by making use of the knoAvledge he had so singularly gained. Yet the man was mad beyond all doubt, and his confinement Avas an absolute neces sity. It did not appear either that he was treated Avith undue harshness. The countenance of the Italian at once belied such a supposition. It Avas"], [34, "26 MARTYRS TO FASHION. genial, and even benevolent, Avhile it vvas evident from the tone of passionate though suppressed enthusiasm Avith Avhich he had spoken the fe\\v words relating to himself, that he Avas a man of generous impulses. There Avas evidently a strange history behind all this. But regarding the simple fact of the stranger's insanity, it was natural if he Avas in any Avay connected with or related to Sir Charles Sinclair, that the baronet would desire to have him strictly guarded by some one upon whom he could thoroughly depend. If the Italian was bound to him by any tie of gratitude or self-interest, the more reason to suppose that he would treat the unfortunate maniac kindly. Besides, if evil lay concealed in this incident, it was doubtful if he Avould counteract it by publicly speaking of it"], [35, "27 A MYSTERY. in such a place as a country inn, and in giving his word to the Italian, he only pledged himself temporarily. \" I will give you that promise,\" George said. \" Thanks, my good preserver, thanks. You will keep your Avord, I know, by that open English face.\" \"But upon one condition only.\" \"What is that,\" asked the Italian. \" I wish you to tell me when and where you first undertook to take charge of this madman.\" \" It is the only reward I can make you for saving my life this day,\" said Santi, \" and I will tell you. Five years ago I was a physician in Rome. Imprisoned for a political offence, I was rescued by a young Englishman of good birth. We met again at Baden. I was very poor, and the Englishman"], [36, "28 MARTYRS TO FASIIION. said, ' You are a physician, Santi : do you comprehend the treatment of the insane ?' I answered yes, and took charge of this maniac at Baden, two years ago. But hush ! my good friend, ask me not another Avord, for the love of the Holy Mother.\" \" That is enough,\" said George Har land, \" be assured I will not make use of the knoAAdedge to do you any mis chief.\" So they shook hands and parted. The day was just dawning as George reached the door of the inn. It Avas still standing open as he had left it. Evidently not a soul had passed along the road. He entered, softly closed the door without any noise, and fatigued with his nocturnal adventure, was soon in a sound sleep. He took breakfast at the inn, and it amused him greatly"], [37, "29 A MYSTERY. to watch the furtive glances cast at him by the host, the barmaid, the ostler, and two or three loungers at the tap. They had discovered that their strange guest had departed, but forbore to question George, and he on his part did not choose to enlighten them, but when he had finished his breakfast, went to the bank, and then took coach to Merton, to visit his mother and Gilbert, before returning to town."], [38, "CHAPTER II. GILBERT IS SANGUINE. Some weeks had passed since the farmer's humiliation at the Manor. The affair had been much discussed in Merton, but like other scandals, it soon lost its interest, and was replaced by some other subject for gossip and idle specu lation. Mr. Warren still carried himself haughtily at market and elsewhere, and still dressed better than his neighbours, but it is impossible to express the secret bitterness that was eating into his heart. In the first violence of his disappointment, he had sought the ser\\Tices of a solicitor, with the inten tion of bringing an action against Sir"], [39, "GILBERT IS SANGUINE. 31 Charles, as he had threatened, for breach of promise, but the lawyer gave him so little hope of a successful issue, that the project was abandoned. He had literally no case against the baronet, who had simply amused himself at the expense of a pretty accomplished girl, and who, when the acquaintance seemed likely to be inconvenient, had put an end to it. That was all, Sir Charles reasoned Avith himself, and in what Avay could he be blamed. He forgot perhaps that a farmer's daughter might be as sensitive of her honor \u2014 as Avillin^ to receive adulation \u2014 as ready to believe in the poAver of her youth and beauty, as the proudest dame in Belgravia.

The conduct of her father had been so absurd \u2014 his motive so obvious, that the baronet might Avell be excused for the unceremonious way in which he had dismissed him. The shock which Annie herself had sustained, was a very severe one. It was Avith difficulty she could be per suaded to see her most intimate friends, so galling Avas her humiliation. She Avould sit whole days at her Avindow, watching the sailing clouds, as they shadowed the distant fields, or lav mirrowed upon the smiling river, so depressed and hopeless, that her health became seriously affected.

Gilbert had indeed already made himself obnoxious to authority. When a pauper woman died in childbirth, for Avant of proper medical attendance, Gilbert's letter to the Times, brought sharp retribution, and much obloquy to the guardians ; when the ignorance and drunkenness of the Avretched schoolmaster appointed through Bumbledom interest, could no longer be tolerated, it was Gilbert, who, through a long winter instructed twenty or more poor lads at his OAvn house, and out of his oavu pocket provided them Avith books.

All this told against him, and Sir Charles Avas severely ridiculed for not pressing the charge. The term of Gilbert's imprisonment, had been short, but the agonies of mind he endured, made it seem half a lifetime. Day by day, and hour by hour, he rehearsed that old, old story, so familiar, yet so often reneAved, \" did she really love him, or not ?\" Was it possible that Annie, so gentle, so fair, so confiding, could have lent herself as readily as EAe of old to the first false voice.

Gilbert felt no shame, no indignity in his confinement. He thought himself perfectly justified in what he had done. He grieved sincerely on his mother's account, but he knew his old foreman Kebble would see that all business matters were properly attended to. Notwithstanding all that had passed, Gilbert's first enquiry when he reached home Avas about Annie. The AvidoAv felt great bitterness on the subject, but Gilbert said, hopefully \u2014 \"I should think uoav that Warren has had enough of his folly. He will surely not oppose me any longer.

Mrs. Harland believed only in property that could be seen. A nice pile of well-seasoned timber, ready to supply the first cus tomer that came, and all paid for beforehand, represented tangible value in the old lady's mind. But putting money into the hands of others, Avith only their promise to pay as security ; it was not the way poor dear Harland managed business when he Avas alive. \" You need not be over-anxious, mother,\" Gilbert said, in answer to all this. \" The business will pay back the mortgage in three or four years.\" \" Not with a wife to keep who wants all sorts of extravagancies and fiddle saddle.\" \" Indeed, mother, you alarm yourself Avithout cause.

Not even this provocation could induce him to reply Avith any bitterness. Besides, he was so perfectly satisfied about Annie.

He would sally out to the Mount Farm at once."], [49, "CHAPTER III. AN UNINVITED GUEST. Some Aveeks had passed since Mr. Warren dined at the Manor. It was nearly the middle of October, and showers of russet leaves marked the change of the season. The mellow misty afternoon, which gave additional beauty to the declining day, brought on the darkness rapidly. So rapidly indeed, that Sir Charles, who had been shooting all the day, found the Manor quite dusky and gloomy, upon his return to dinner.

Rumour had many strange things to say of Merton Manor, in its ancient days, and even Avithin a few years past it had caused many mysterious hints and whispers to be circulated in the locality. For the Manor had lain neglected many a long year before the advent of Sir Charles Sinclair. Law-suite, domestic unhappiness, extravagance, debts and mismanagement, had cruelly diminished the once princely revenues of Merton. It had been held in trust for vears"], [51, "AN UNINVITED GUEST. 43 Avhile the young heir was abroad, and the house in consequence was only tenanted by tAvo or three servants. It was supposed that the accumulation of property during' this period, had redeemed the liabilities upon the estate, for upon Sir Charles taking possession, a lavish expenditure at once restored the old house to something like its former splendour. Whether this outlay was made from the legitimate resources of the estate or not, was unknown. Indeed until the baronet came to Merton, and courted popularity by unwonted festivites, nothing was known of him. Some who professed to be better informed as to his antecedents, spoke of having met with him in Germany, and in fact, he was recalled from the continent to take possession of the estate."], [52, "44 MARTYRS TO FASHION. The previous neglect which had overtaken the Manor, could be only too easily accounted for. Sir Hugh Sinclair the former baronet, had ahvays been a man of pleasure. It was enough to take away one's breath to hear of the doings at the Manor in those days. Fetes took place in the park, to which any were welcome, and Avhich were kept up for days at fearful expenditure. Racing, hunting, and mas querading absorbed the rent-roll, till money had to be raised upon any terms to keep up the excessive outlay. At last a sudden stop was put to all this by the disappearance of Sir Hugh. The creditors made the most of what they could find, and alloAved the fine old place to fall into decay. Sir Charles was popular, and he certainly did all he could to ingratiate"], [53, "AN UNINA'ITED GUEST. 45 himself. He encouraged all the local amusements. He purchased everything of Merton tradesmen, who of course showed their gratitude by charging him twenty per cent, beyond what he would have paid by having the goods sent from London, or even from Oxford. He was president and patron of the Literary Institution at Merton. He was popular as we have said, but there were times when strange fits of gloom and despondency came over him, and puzzled those who were accustomed to see him in brighter moods. Such a feeling oppressed him on that calm and subdued October day, as he came back to dinner. There was an unusual stillness and repose in the air.

Whether it Avas that the sombre aspect of the place suggested sinister forebodings, or that some dreary reminiscence was floating through his brain, Ave cannot say, but the baronet stopped more than once as he came up the avenue, listened and looked about him, ere he resumed his walk. When he reached the door, it Avas just that subdued hour when the day light has almost faded, but we are still Availing for complete darkness, ere we light the lamps. Sir Charles remem bered as he entered the house that he had not replied to an invitation received some time before, and made for the study, intending to write a line before dinner. The house was unusually still, and no one had seen him enter. It"], [55, "47 AN UNINVITED GUEST. was from no intentional purpose, but simply in accordance with the same sombre feeling Avhich had oppressed him while passing through the park, that induced him to enter the study noise lessly. Being fatigued also with his day's sport, he dropped languidly into an easy chair, and did not immediately ring for his lamp, but sat for a con siderable time absorbed in deep reverie. The strangest stories have been told of the magnetic power of one human being over another. Legends are plen tiful, and have formed the themes of poems, plays, and romances, in Avhich relatives are described as having mys terious foreAvarnings of danger or distress to those dear to them. Omens and presentiments had led them to prognos ticate death and disaster, long before the doom has fallen. Without subscribing"], [56, "48 MARTYRS TO FASHION. to these almost supernatural theories, it is yet certain that Sir Charles as he sat there, became conscious that he was not alone. There was not the slightest sound, nor any movement to suggest this feeling. The same whisper of the Avind and rustle of the leaA'es \u2014 the same cawing of the rooks, subdued a little by distance, echoed through the house, but nothing more. There was not a shadow upon the Avail \u2014 not a breath \u2014 yet Sir Charles shrank as from the presence of a deadly enemy.

Sir Charles was not near enough, Avhere he sat to touch his bell Avithout rising from the chair, and for a time so influenced was he by a feeling of dread he could scarcely collect himself suffi ciently to decide upon a course of action. At this moment, hoAveArer, Sir Charles heard, Avith such a feeling as the be nighted wanderer might catch, the distant echo of a human A'oice, a footstep along the corridor Avithout, and a moment after the door of the study opened and his serA'ant entered Avith a lamp and placed it upon the table.

The baronet felt his blood congealing with horror, as he returned the awful gaze of this stranger.

Would he sit there hour by hour until the lights died out, and one by one the servants had gone to rest and then rush upon him like a wild beast who has lingered all day for its prey ? He was totally unarmed him self.

Sir Charles thought of"], [61, "AN UNINVITED GUEST. 53 the tales he had heard of brute tamers who were torn to pieces in a moment if they allowed their eyes to wander in the slightest degree.

The baronet was not without courage, but to-night, fate itself seemed to con spire to shake his nerves to the uttermost. It was long before he resolved to ring and order another lamp. At length, however, he groped noiselessly for the bell, and after waiting a short time, but as it seemed for hours, a lamp was brought. But when it came the grim stranger"], [62, "54 MARTYRS TO FASHION. was not there. He came like a shadow and so he had departed. But the terror of his presence in that house had completely unnerved the baronet, and it was an effort to rouse himself again as his servant entered."], [63, "CHAPTER IV.

I may yet be in time to repair my rudeness.\" Glad of any pretext to get rid of the man, Sir Charles ordered his horse, having no idea for the moment, except to get away from the house for a time, but as he considered the matter, he determined to ride over to Santi at once, and demand an explanation of his carelessness. For the reader will have guessed that the strange visitor to the Manor was no other than the patient of the Italian physician. His anger against Santi was excessive. He had given such particular instruc tions that the lunatic should be watched night and day. Santi would tell him of course that his patient had been very calm lately, and he had deemed restraint unnecessary, but he must know, as a medical man, that insanity could"], [65, "57 SANTI IS FIRM. not be trusted, and that those semi-lucid intervals, which seemed so reassuring, Avere in reality the moments most to be feared. Besides, had he not paid large sums that nothing should be neglected. It was in this Avay the baronet argued as he rode, and his first impulse Avas to give the care of the lunatic to another, but where could another be found with such apparent fidelity as Santi. He was bound by ties of gratitude and self-interest. He had no friends or relatives in England, that the baronet was aware of. He could not transfer the charge of this poor creature to a stranger without explanations, and there were reasons why he did not wish it to be prated about that there Avas insanity in the family. It was a picturesque road Sir Charles"], [66, "58 MARTYRS TO FASHION. i Avas travelling, and the silver light of the full October moon shone brilliantly upon hill, wood, and river. The baronet, . however, Avas blind to its beauty, and the fantastic shadoAVs of a bush or tree only suggested to him for a moment the idea that his late unwelcome guest was lurking near. Such, hoAvever, Avas not the case, for Santi, immediately after he had parted from George Harland, sent out three men, Avhose assistance he relied upon when his patient was in his Avorst moods. These men had searched all the day, and had been warned by Santi that it was not unlikely the lunatic might, by a sort of instinct, wander to the Manor. At the moment the strange intruder left the house, these men were Avaiting in the avenue, and pounced upon him instantly."], [67, "59 SANTI IS FIRM. It was Avith the greatest difficulty Sir Charles could control his temper, when alone with the Italian, though the calmness and suavity of Santi would have disarmed even a more irritable man. But in this very calmness there was also an element of strength, which the baronet had not counted on. He knew that the Italian was poor. That he had accepted his charge without requiring particulars, and that the heavy sum which he was paid yearly gave him a handsome income, but he over rated the tie of self-interest which he supposed bound Santi to him. In all previous interviews with Santi, there had been no cause of irritation, and there had been much apparent friendship between them. Sir Charles, from youthful love of excitement, had headed a party of Romans under Gari-"], [68, "60 MARTYRS TO FASHION. baldi, and during a night attack, Santi, Avho was one of the party, had been taken prisoner. Making interest in high quarters, Sir Charles had saved him from death, upon condition that he left the kingdom. When the offer had been made to him, to take charge of the maniac, he had accepted it, as he would have accepted anything at the time, with gratitude and devotion. But there had gradually arisen in his mind a sense of degradation in connexion with the position he occupied. There were Italians in London whom he had known in his youth, who would gladly have welcomed him among them, but Sir Charles had rigidly interdicted his making any acquaintance in England. He had taken the secluded cottage we have described, as being near enough to the Manor for him to visit occasionally."], [69, "61 SANTI IS FIRM. but the unforseen event of this day inclined him to think that it was hardly wise to have the maniac so near. \"I am thinking, Santi,\" the baronet said, with some hesitation, \" that it would be better if you removed from here. The unfortunate occurrence of to-day has almost decided me to send you away from England.\" \" Then, my good Sir Charles, I must decline.\" \" Decline !\" \" Yes, indeed, Sir Charles.\" \" But, my dear sir, that is a subject for me to decide, I think.\" \" Not entirely, my good Sir Charles. I am not ungrateful. I have sacrificed my liberty, but I shall not sacrifice my honor.\" \" What do you mean ?\" \" Is there any reason for secrecy in"], [70, "62 MARTYRS TO FASHION. the charge you have given me ?\" asked the Italian, pointedly. It was a home thrust as unexpected to receive as it was difficult to parry. Indeed, the question would not have been asked a few hours before, but the tone and manner of George Harland in the morning had shown the sensitive Italian plainly that there was a senti ment of distrust in him, and he was keenly wounded by it. \" To some extent it is important that it should be kept secret, Santi.\" \" Will you kindly explain, Sir Charles.\" \" You have not forgotten, Santi, the Sardinian family whose acquaintance we made at Turin.\" \"Assuredly not, Sir Charles, nor La Bella Giulia, either.\" \"I am about to marry her.\" \"Ah!\""], [71, "63 SANTI IS FIRM. \" Yes, and you may naturally suppose I do not wish the fact of my unfortu nate relatiA^e's insanity to be known.\" \" Nothing more ?\" \" Well, Santi, there are sundry family grievances which have been allowed to die out, but which might be revived by the freedom of this unhappy maniac and cause me great annoyance.\" \"Ah, indeed!\" \" Therefore,\" continued Sir Charles, \" I have thought it better that his existence should be entirely unknoAvn to my friends, and in the event of his death I will settle upon you a hand some annuity for your services.\" \" My good Sir Charles, you are very kind, but I wish to be relieved from this position.\" \"Why?\" \" I'm looked upon with suspicion here"], [72, "64 MARTYRS TO FASIIION. \" Yet, Santi, when I propose a change of residence you object.\" 'Yes, I shall not leave England. \" There is no necessity for that.

Come now, be frank, and tell me Avhat is the matter. I pay you liberally, but I will increase the amount if you desire it.\" \" No, Sir Charles, not one penny more. I decline the charge upon any terms.\" \" Give me your reason. \" Certainly, Sir Charles. Because you have not given me your confidence.\" They were interrupted at this moment by the arrival of a fly in the lane. The"], [73, "65 SANTI IS FIRM. baronet was annoyed at the interruption, but was glad to perceive, by an exclama tion from Santi, that the lunatic had been caught. A scene, however, took place, for which they were quite unprepared. The poor maniac irritated by coercion, and perhaps by want of food, as he had been at large two whole days, could with difficulty, be brought into the house, even with the united strength of three men, assisted by the physician. Sir Charles did not attempt to assist them, but contemplated the scene with a feeling of horror, impossible to describe. Even when the lunatic, after violent struggles and cries more nearly resembling those of a wild beast than anything human, was at last, put under restraint, Sir Charles did not move. Santi came back bieathless with his VOL.

Had you given me your confidence at the first it would not have happened to me to make a discovery which throws a neAv light upon your conduct.\" \"A discovery, Santi?\" The physician did not answer, but took from his desk a splendid photo graph of two handsome young men, extremely alike and apparently of a similar age. One of them, however, was a little taller than the other and of a more robust frame. \"They are twin brothers,\" said the"], [75, "67 SANTI IS FIRM.

If he had followed the example of many others, who becoming involved go abroad and retrench for a season, he might, in time, have returned and lived happily upon his own estate.

Lady Sinclair, who was devotedly attached to him, had lost any influence she had once possessed over him, and now reduced to all sorts of humiliating shifts for daily existence, and alarmed also by the violent fits of passion which followed her husband's excesses, she was glad to accept the shelter of a home for herself and her twin boys, Charles and Hugh, with an old friend who sympathised with her struggles, and hoped to save the boys from the evil example of their father. It was through the judicious conduct of this true friend, that Lady Sinclair at length derived some benefit from the Merton estate. By guaranteeing the debts in instalments, during a period of seven or eight years, this gentleman"], [78, "70 MARTYRS TO FASIIION. perceived it to be quite possible to clear the estate from all liabilities. A small yearly income was allowed by the creditors, to be paid to Lady Sinclair, the bulk of which she devoted to the education of her boys. Education in Germany is both good and cheap, and by the time they reached manhood she had the gratification of knowing that her sons possessed, perhaps, better and fuller cultivation than they would have obtained at some English Colleges. The poor Lady's trials were not ended yet. Her husband, who saw her occasionally, and when sober was full of promises of amendment, only became confirmed in his favorite habit, and in a fit of delirium committed suicide. The boys were then about fifteen years of age. The shock to Lady Sinclair, whose health was delicate, was"], [79, "71 RETROSPECTION. greater than she could bear, and after gradually sinking, for nearly two years, she died. The orphans of Sir Hugh, had, up to this period, shown considerable promise for the future. They were possessed of excellent talents, and were accom plished and handsome. There was a great similarity in their features, so that one was frequently mistaken for the other, but when together the elder brother was at once seen to possess the greatest strength and animal vigour. The brothers were on good terms with each other, and for a year or two after the death of their mother were always together. However, at about nineteen years of age, a great change took place in the character of the eldest. The cause of this change was for a long time a secret to the younger brother,"], [80, "72 MARTYRS TO FASIIION. and instead of being much together, as formerly, they now did not see each other for weeks together. When they met, the elder brother was so gloomy and reserved, that the younger felt relieved when they were separated again. Curious to ascertain the cause of this change, the young Sinclair frequently questioned him as to his habits, but never elicited anything from him. He was, evidently, living a most irregular life, and his appearance denoted too plainly his profligate habits. For months they had seen little of each other, when one evening the youngest was surprised by a visit from a shabby stranger, who most earnestly begged him to come at once, as his brother had been taken dangerously ill. At first he was unwilling to go with the man, fearing some trick, but yield-"], [81, "73 RETROSPECTION. ing at length to his urgent entreaties, he found himself in a little wretched cottage, on the outskirts of Baden, and there, lying upon a miserable bed, in a room which bore every mark of poverty and neglect, he found his brother lying totally unconscious. How he came there, what was his disease, and who was attending to him, were questions his guide could not answer ; but soon a young woman entered, bringing a medical man, and proclaimed herself the wife of the invalid. She was a fair-haired, blue-eyed girl, with skin like ivory \u2014 a type of thousands to be seen daily in Germany \u2014 and car ried a child at her breast, which'* was evidently \u2022 but a few weeks old. The medical man looked carefully at the patient, and shook his head doubtfully. \" This is a sun-stroke,\" he said \" and"], [82, "74 MARTYRS TO FASHION. doubtless, aggravated by reckless living and improvident habits. I feel it my duty, sir, to warn you, that this man, if he recovers at all, must be carefully watched and kept under some kind of restraint. The least excess in future will induce disorder of the brain.\" Staggered by this intelligence, Hugh Sinclair went home to his apart ments profoundly distressed by all the circumstances of the case. He did all that lay in his power, and would have removed his brother to his own apartments, but the young wife, who, though belonging to a very humble class, and without cultivation and refinement, was evidently tenderly attached to the man she had chosen, would not hear of his removal. Months passed, and as no change took place for the better, it became"], [83, "75 RETROSPECTION. necessary to remove the invalid to an asylum, and the young wife went to live with her friends. At this time some acquaintances of the younger Sinclair were about to visit Italy, and induced him to join them. Ignorant that their object was a political one, he readily consented, and it was only upon their arrival in Rome, that he discovered the real purpose of their journey. Fired with the spirit of adventure, the young man needed little persuasion to fall into their views. He had received some military training at the college, where he had been educated, and felt the pride of an Alexander upon being appointed to a small com mand. The result of the skirmish, in which he took part, proved abortive. It has been stated already, that the physician"], [84, "76 MARTYRS TO FASHION. Santi, was one of the troop, and in what way Sinclair had served him. Santi went back with the young man to Baden, hoping to find an opportunity to establish himself there. Events, however, were ordered otherwise ; upon the evening of their arrival, the younger Sinclair found at his old lodgings a letter from England, addressed to the elder brother, which had been lying there for some days. Under ordinary circumstances, Hugh Sinclair would not have dreamt of opening this letter, which was addressed in a cramped legal handwriting he had frequently seen before, being that of the solicitor managing the Merton estate; but quick as lightning he guessed the contents of the letter, and determined upon opening it. The letter addressed to Charles"], [85, "77 RETROSPECTION.

Then"], [86, "78 MARTYRS TO FASHION. he signed his brother's name and posted the letter. His next care was respecting his brother. He found, upon enquiry, that his health had improved, but that little change had taken place in his mental state. He was quiet, and with care might some day recover. He might be removed without danger, the physician said. Young Sinclair had spoken to no one of his brother's attack, and this fact enabled him now to carry out his design.

Long before his attack the young husband had given the girl a photograph of himself and his brother, beautifully executed, and now, with only this photograph and her husband's name to guide her, she started for England to find him."], [88, "CHAPTER VI. AFTER DINNER. Things were going on as usual at the Mount Farm on the day when Gilbert had been released. Twelve o'clock was the usual dinner hour at the farm, and Michael Warren and his wife having just finished that meal, had drawn round to the fire, the farmer to indulge in his accustomed forty winks, the dame settling herself down to a mysterious performance, which she called her fancy work. The dairymaid was clattering with her pans and pails under the watchful superin tendence of Mrs. Higgins. Two men were thrashing in the barn, across the"], [89, "AFTER DINNER. 81 strawyard, and Cruppy was watching them, making a certain kind of harmony by whistling an accompaniment to the strokes of the flail. The farmer had more than once altered this early dinner hour. He could not see why Compton, the paper maker, should dine at five any more than himself, but the pressure put upon him at the farm Avas so great that he was compelled to to go back, reluctantly, to the old fashioned hour. But he ahvays grumbled, and invariably called it lunch to strangers. The farmer had not forgotten that it was the day of Gilbert's release, nor had Annie. She, poor girl, was not Avith her parents. She had not left her own room for several days. The farmer had been Avondering all the momma1 how Gilbert Avould act in VOL. II. G"], [90, "82 MARTYRS TO FASHION. in the matter. Would he write first, or come to the farm ? If so, hoAV should he receive him ? or how would he reply. The farmer's pride had been deeply wounded, but he was recovering him self. He would take the matter into consideration, because, if Gilbert, after all that had taken place, was still so much attached to Annie as to wish her for his wife, he must either permit the match, or banish him at once. The latter course was that which would have been most agreeable to the farmer's feelings. Gilbert had shown himself so forward and so presumptuous in fact, that Mr. Warren would never willingly consent to Annie marrying him. But certain personal influences were at work which cowed the farmer considerably. Rent day was near at"], [91, "83 AFTER DINNER. hand, and money was uncommonly short. There Avas the neAv piano, too, which he had bought for Annie, had not been paid for ; and a disagreeable note had just reached him from college.

It was time in fact that Arthur left the college, but what to do with him then ? and Annie herself was a great perplexity to him. He would not humble himself so far as to make any enquiry as to her present feeling for Gilbert Harland. Still, he Avould have been glad to know, because, if she was really passionately attached to the timber merchant, he would hardly like to be harsh. G 2"], [92, "84 MARTYRS TO FASHION. All these thoughts passing through the farmer's mind, rendered his after dinner nap somewhat uneasy. Finding himself so wakeful, Mr. Warren deter mined to discuss the matter with his Avife. The occasions when Mr. Warren took his wife into his confidence were so few that the good lady was in a flutter when he began enquiring if she had thought lately, anything about Gilbert Harland and Annie. Mrs. Warren was about to make some simpering reply when a modest rap at the door Avas heard. There were so many people coming to the farm, that little ceremony was observed about ansAvering the door. Neighbours came to purchase eggs and butter ; cheese factors and wool dealers dropped in; it might be the horse doctor, or the pig killer ; perhaps it was the owner of"], [93, "85 AFTER DINNER. the steam threshing-machine, or the blacksmith. Sometimes Mr. Chekker would leave a pious tract, to remind the farmer of some especial saint's day. Travelling packmen sometimes tapped at the door, or it Avas a visit from the shepherd ; so many calls took place at the Mount Farm that it was usual merely to say \"come in,\" as an easier process than getting up to open the door. Such an answer was returned by Mr. Warren, to the knock just heard. The latch chinked, and some one entered. It was no cheese factor, smith, clergyman, or horse doctor. It was Gilbert Harland. He was received in utter silence. The farmer was too proud to speak first, and Mrs. Warren was too frightened. \" I am afraid, Mr. Warren,\" said"], [94, "86 MARTYRS TO FASHION. Gilbert, in a decided tone, \"that I am not very welcome here, but I am not a man to be turned from my purpose by a trifle.\" The farmer would not even turn his head when he found who his visitor was. Gilbert, hoAvever, with the utmost coolness, took a chair and seated him self in a position Avhere the farmer could not ignore his presence without changing his place. \"That's cool, upon my soul,\" said the farmer, \" taking a man's house by storm in this way.\" \" I wish to know, once for all, Mr. Warren, if you intend to reject my proposition for your daughter's hand.\" \" I wish my daughter to marry a gentleman, Gilbert Harland.\" \" Opinions differ as to Avhat constitutes a gentleman, Mr. Warren.\""], [95, "87 AFTER DINNER. \"At least,\" said the farmer, \"I do not intend giving her to a poor man, she would be miserable.\" \"You might be easy on that score, Mr. Warren, my own affairs are in a prosperous state ; I could provide your daughter with every comfort and in dulgence.\" Now the farmer, from the moment Gilbert entered the door, had been earnestly revolving the matter in his mind. He tried to remember any chance remarks Annie had made in reference to Gilbert. He tried to recall her looks and tones upon particular occasions, and he came to the conclusion, that if Annie ever really loved Gilbert the feeling was over. He would treat Gilbert fairly. Nobody should say in Merton, that he coerced his daughter, he therefore, instead of replying to"], [96, "88 MARTYRS TO FASHION. Gilbert, simply said to his Avife, \"Just run up stairs and bring Annie doAvn. She shall speak for herself.\" Mrs. Warren dreaded her errand, but she had not sufficient decision of character to raise the slightest objection, and left the room at once. The farmer, taking no further notice of Gilbert, lighted a cigar and puffed it leisurely. Gilbert sat for, perhaps, ten minutes, heartily wishing that the relationship which he sought with Michael Warren did not stand in the way of his speak ing with greater freedom. However, the farmer had sent for Annie, and he joyfully hoped that it would be the last time he would thus have to assert himself. While he was thinkinar of what he should say to the charming girl, after his painful absence, Mrs."], [97, "AFTER DINNER. 89 Wrarren came back to the room, her face a perfect blank, from sheer dismay. \"Well, Avife,\" said the farmer, \" Avhere is Annie ; why doesn't she come ?\" \"I can't \u2014 find her \u2014 Michael,\" Avas the breathless answer. \" Can't find her !

Such was her punishment, Avhen Captain Mellor came back with Caroline. Laura well knew how shallow the artist's daughter was. She had heard from Caroline's own lips the tale of George Harland's disappointed hopes, and she had sometimes wondered what manner of man he was. The flippant way in which Caroline had disparaged his claim to her affection, had found little response with Laura.

For the Captain was too fascinated for the moment with Caroline to give a thought to the old love.

It was quite in harmony Avith her character that Caroline should feel an additional pleasure in captivating Mellor in face of such a splendid Avoman as this. A woman, too, whose ample means Avould establish the Captain in clover for the rest of his days. Hitherto, Mellor had been calculating enough, as wre have seen, but there are moments in the lives of even the most Avorldly, when the chances of the future are thrown aside, so as to be no drag to the indulgence of the present. There was in Caroline a saucy charm of manner, when she perceived the game Avas in her own hands, which few men, even of a quieter cast than the Captain,"], [133, "BLIND AS A BAT. 125 could resist. We have seen Iioav easily she carried George Harland, simple and unaffected as he was, chained to her victorious car, but the charm was still greater to Mellor, because he had been accustomed to \" good society ;\" in other words, to society that may feel, think, eat its own heart with jealousy or scorn ; society that Avaits for the revenge, which a Avord or look may one day inflict upon a rival, and when the chance comes, strikes secretly and mercilessly ; but a society which, like the North American Indian, bears its torture smiling and in silence.

How galling that bondage was, and what stern fetters hemmed in her sex upon all sides, avc may see by the relations betAveen her and Mellor. Had there been any genuineness in the man, he could not have helped seeing that Laura really loved him. Meamvhile, her perceptions, which Avere as clear as his Avere obtuse, told her plainly that any sIioav of affection on her part, no matter how modestly dis played, would have driven him from her presence at once.

But the comedy wanted a larger audience ; it was too well played for a single spectator, and that one so deeply interested ; whichever won, to her it was a losing game. And Laura could stand it no longer. So intent had the players become upon their individual game, that they seemed altogether oblivious of her presence, until she said, \" Let me show you my exotics, Caroline, before the sun goes down.\" With that, Caroline slightly abashed, took the Captain's arm and they passed into the consen-atory. \"Do you like those gorgeous blooms ?\" asked Caroline of her companion, who had remained silent for a moment. \"No, Miss Sandall, they are very beautiful, I grant, to those Avho have"], [137, "129 BLIND AS A BAT. a taste for such excessive richness, and know how to appreciate that kind of beauty.

When she saw once for all that any lingering fancy the Captain might once have had for her, was now utterly gone, her next desire was to protect Caroline. This, it is true, did not exhibit any high opinion of the Captain, but women can love a man most tenderly and truly, as we see every day, and yet be fully ali\\'e to his Aveaknesses or vices.

The plain question with Caroline was whether the Captain really liked her well enough to make her his wife. \" It's all very well living with dad,\" the young beauty reasoned, \" and he would do anything to please me, and make me happy, but he's getting old, and can't last for ever, as he often reminds me. He doesn't save a penny either, and I should find it troublesome if he went off unexpectedly.\" She was in a boat with the Captain while these thoughts passed through her mind. Mellor seemed pleased with her, and Caroline certainly looked very pretty"], [183, "175 CAUGHT AT LAST. as she reclined in the boat, and watched her cavalier pulling against the stream. He almost made up his mind, as he looked at her, to ask her at once to be his wife, but sundry troublesome ques tions of finance of old date always turned up in his mind, the moment he began to think of Caroline seriously. He knew woman's world pretty well, and did not expect from Caroline, judging by what he had seen, any violent passion for him. \" She wouldn't break her heart, I'll be bound, if I fell out of the boat, and never came to the surface again \u2014 would you, Caroline ?\" The last three words were spoken aloud, with the least perceptible shade of sentiment. \" Would I what ?\" asked the young lady Care if I came to grief. Caroline opened her eyes a little at"], [184, "176 MARTYRS TO FASHION. this; much as a fine tabby might, who had been sitting half-asleep before the kitchen fire, and suddenly hears the timid scratch of a little mouse near at hand. \"Really, Captain Mellor,\" she said, \" you look so perfectly at your ease, that it is difficult to imagine your coming to grief.\" \" Oh, but cooler felloAvs than me, have gone adrift before now. There was young Lynne, of our regiment, was fished out of the Serpentine one day, and everybody was puzzled hoAV he came to end his days in that way, when somebody told me a lock of Lady Jocelyn's hair was found in his pocket book. I guessed then the whole thing, for I knew he was sweet upon her.\" \"A married lady, of course,\" remarked Caroline."], [185, "CAUGHT AT LAST. 177 \"WTell, I believe so.

Then for a considerable time there was silence, and the Captain pulled gently up the stream, sometimes glanc ing at his pretty companion, wondering what her thoughts were. As to his OAvn, they ran pretty much in this strain \u2014 \"Pity she hasn't Laura Mostyn's VOL. II. N"], [186, "178 MARTYRS TO FASHION. money.

Why was the Captain so excessively slow. If he would but give her the cue, he would not find fault of her rendering of the part. Caroline is much too clever and experienced to be impatient, or, rather, to shoAV her impatience. She knows, sweet soul, that the sport is akin to angling, and nothing is more injudicious then to twitch the rod before the bait is fully seized ; it is better, even, to give a little line, and let the fish fancy himself free, and finally swallow the bait entirely, and of his own choice. Even then, if he can be got out of his native element without feeling the"], [190, "182 MARTYRS TO FASHION. hook too keenly, it is better ; as to his imbecile wriggles afterwards, they are merely laughable. But the Captain still hesitated. Caroline had no money, and for himself he was but a brilliant beggar, at the best. He had not been solvent these ten years, and suppose he were mad enough to make her his wife, hoAV could he keep a home when he could not, at all times, keep himself. True, he was not a very good manager, and, happy thought ! there was his mother ; perhaps the old lady rejoiced in the idea of her son settling doAvn into a steady paterfamilias, would come to the rescue. It Avas a good thought, he would not be over hasty, but take a run to Guilford before he committed himself. Now, Caroline had been Avatching the"], [191, "CAUGHT AT LAST. 183 Captain while these thoughts revolved in his mind, and had not been oblivious to the sudden smile Avhich shot across his countenance as the last notion pre sented itself. It Avas hardly possible to be keener in reading character than Caroline was, and she determined not to part from her companion without bringing matters to a climax. The bait was swalloAved, she kneAv, and he should be pulled out of the stream before she left him ; and noAv she opened fire. \"What a charming woman Laura Mostyn is, Captain Mellor.\" \"Yes, very nice, very nice.\" \" Very nice,\" retorted Caroline, \" I should be glad to know where you will find her equal.\" What was she driving at, thought Mellor ; he had alloAved himself to be"], [192, "184 MARTYRS TO FASHION. fascinated, but he would not say any thing now, to hasten matters. He was already a little more entangled than was quite safe. \" Good woman, Caroline, and all that, but one needn't go so far to find her match.\" \" Is it not astonishing, that she still remains single ?\" \"Don't know, I'm sure, hasn't drop ped upon the right felloAV yet, I presume.\" Alas for youth and beauty. This is the way a man of the world speaks of a woman like Laura, \" she hadn't dropped upon the right fellow.\" True, she would have dropped upon the wrong felloAV if unlucky fate had mated her with Captain Mellor. \" And then, being so rich makes it still more remarkable.\" This Avas touching the Captain in a very"], [193, "CAUGHT AT LAST. 185 sore place. \"You shouldn't imagine, Caroline, that we fellows think of no thing but money,\" said he. \" I fear that is the strongest attraction irC these days,\" retorted Caroline, \" or why is it that so many fine girls remain single.\" The Captain was piqued.

Captain Mellor was not a man to let the grass grow under his feet when he had a decided purpose in view. He had been accepted by Caroline, and she also raised no objection to a speedy union. The Sandall household, never very pros perous, had lately become much narrower than usual, for the artist was getting older, and his eyes were dim, and his hand unsteady. The few commissions he obtained were executed with much difficulty, and the small sums he obtained were given more from charity than a love of art.

This has been fre- quently remarked elsewhere. The ever varying splendour of the Alps seems powerless to influence those who gaze upon it daily. Human nature delights in contrast, and it is the man who has lived the best part of his days in some smoky street in London or Birmingham, who retires to a spot that commands a charming landscape, and seems never tired of gazing upon it, and watching it under different aspects.

She had watched the flippant, thought less girl with considerable anxiety, for she did not believe she would have acquired so much influence as to induce the Captain to marry her. The caution she had given Caroline had been as delicate as was consistent, with fair warning, but when it became really a settled thing, Laura, with just a little sigh, which she could not entirely repress, entered into the details of the wedding with the utmost zeal. Nothing could exceed her generosity. Caroline was touched by it, when every day some graceful present or other was sent to the cottage.

Indeed, she had so many kind suggestions to make, so much graceful and tender advice to bestow, that Caroline was trotting between Coombe House and the cottage from morning till night. The hardest task that Laura had was to say farewell to the Captain. He had kept aloof from Coombe House, which could hardly be wondered at, having formerly been upon such intimate terms with Laura. She knew so much more about him than any other living woman, and he felt that she would wonder, most of all, at the step he had taken. HoAvever, the Captain's perfect coolness, and Laura's good nature, took away all stiffness from the interview. In marrying Caroline, perhaps, the Captain feared nothing so much as the jocularity that would be indulged in at"], [201, "Caroline's honeymoon. 193 his expense. The fact that there was a certain secrecy in all his movements, that there was an evident underlying spice of wickedness in the Captain, had made him quite a reputation amongst a certain set of ladies. They had teased and petted him in proportion to their estimate of the advantages of a fast life. But that he, the man of society, the man, who above all things, studied his ease and comfort, who was so chary of incurring any responsibility, should take upon himself the burden of a wife, and that wife a woman who did not bring him a penny, would, he well knew, astound some of his old admirers. Nothing, however, could be more cool than the Captain's behaviour through the whole affair. They were married, and the happy pair had gone off to Paris to spend the honeymoon, yet the finan- vol. n. o"], [202, "194 MARTYRS TO FASHION. cial department was in a worse condition than ever. Of course the Captain made no confession to Caroline of his circum stances. He knew her aim so exactly, that he felt no compunction as to the manner in which he was treating her. He had always managed to pull through, and a vague impression seemed to in fluence him, that it only required a determination to take things coolly, and a conscience elastic enough to make one indifferent to Avhat was thought or said of one's doings, to overcome almost any difficulty. Certainly, in spite of this nonchalance, there were times when the shadows of outstanding debts looked a little threat ening ; and he was by no means confident, either, how Mrs. Torkey would relish his bringing home a young wife to Jermyn Street. He must make a new"], [203, "CAROLINE'S HONEYMOON. 195 arrangement with that lady, and a new arrangement involved a settlement of former claims. The hundred pounds or so, which was the extent of the Captain's wealth when he married Caroline, would last them most likely through the honeymoon, and he must then see what else could be done. \" I shall find some way out, I dare say,\" the Captain said to himself. \"If matters get awkward, I must realize six months' housekeeping somewhere, and cut for the French coast.\" Caroline was in high spirits ; tempera ments like hers, with so much vivacity, levity, and caprice, easily absorb the enjoyment of the present moment, and their very heedlessness makes them captivating to such men as Mellor. The change, too, from the quiet life of Merton, with the occasional excitement o 2"], [204, "196 MARTYRS TO FASHION. of a ball in Oxford, or a little musical practice with Laura Mostyn, to the head long feverish excitement of Paris, was eminently calculated to please her. The Captain knowing her ignorance of society took her to resorts which would have shocked a more delicate nature, and it was the greatest amusement to him to watch her astonishment at some of the manners and customs of the Parisians. The Captain was not a man to rail at the world when things went hardly with him. His estimate of men being a low one, he was not surprised at a bit of sharp practice. If he failed to meet a bill, and was obliged to keep out of the way of a writ, he did so with admirable coolness, and the perfect suavity of his manner, when compelled to stare the difficulty in the face, fre quently disarmed his antagonist, and"], [205, "Caroline's honeymoon. 197 obtained a renewal upon easy terms. The fellows did not like to be hard upon such a pleasant gentleman. But notwithstanding this free and easy philosophy, time Avill pass, and purses become empty. They had made themselves extremely merry in Paris, but the Captain feared he might come to complete low water mark, before he could establish himself in Jermyn Street. Caroline, however, begged hard to stay longer. \" I will pay the expenses myself,\" she said, \"if that is any consideration.\" \"You?\" said the Captain, with as tonishment. Caroline opened her purse, and shoAved her husband a goodly pile of bank notes. \" Painting must be a better trade than I calculated, Caroline.\" \" You surely do not suppose poor old"], [206, "198 MARTYRS TO FASHION. dad gave me these,\" retorted she, merrily. \"Why, the poor old boy scarcely ever OAvned a ten pound note in his life.\" \" How on earth did you get this fund, then ?\" \"Guess,\" said Caroline. Mellor considered for some time, and not without result. \" I know, Caroline, and I am half sorry to know ; you got them from Miss Mostyn.\" \" I certainly did, but why should you be sorry ?\" The Captain did not answer this question. For the first time in his life he was humiliated by the fact of his pecuniary resources being so trans parently doubtful. \" She must have thought that Caroline might one day be in a fix. Well, she's a noble"], [207, "CAROLINE'S HONEYMOON. 199 woman, and to spend her money like this is mean and contemptible.\" \" Somehow, Caroline, I had rather that money was not spent upon this trip.

Had he a lingering affection for her after all ? However, nothing more was said, and they shortly left Paris. Hitherto the honeymoon had been extremely sunny ; the Captain was joyous, and Caroline enthusiastic ; the temporary shadow that passed over her mind respecting the Captain's serious ness, on account of the money she had accepted from Laura, soon passed, and"], [208, "200 MARTYRS TO FASHION. they travelled gaily homeward. The Captain had been discreetly silent as to his prospects and mode of life, and the marriage had taken place so speedily, that Caroline had very little opportunity to question her future lord as to his town mansion, servants, &c. She took it for granted that everything would be very complete and elegant ; perhaps even grand, as the Captain might intend a charming surprise for her. She had a surprise, certainly, Avhen they reached Jermyn Street, but unfortunately, not of the kind she had contemplated. Jermyn Street is much frequented by jolly young bachelors, and men about town. It is near to all the favorite places of amusement, and there is a flavour of fashion about it, in consequence of the vicinity of aristocratic mansions, and popular clubs. It is easy to stroll"], [209, "Caroline's honeymoon. 201 down to the \" House \" from Jermyn Street, and within five minutes' walk of the picture galleries. If a young fellow manages to hook a young lord or marquis, there is generally no excuse upon the score of distance, about paying a return visit. Perhaps a bachelor can make as good an appearance from Jermyn Street upon small means, as from any street about the West End, but it is decidedly not the locality for a family man. The first shadow that fell upon the nevvly-married pair came from Mrs. Torkey. Captain Mellor had only written to her a day or two before they returned, thinking it was the best policy to delay to the last an explanation with that lady. He did not wish, either, to give her the opportunity of Writing to him. She might write upon unpleasant topics, and Caroline might"], [210, "202 MARTYRS TO FASHION. get hold of the letter. He thought it better to trust his diplomacy to a per sonal interview, having so often succeeded with Mrs. Torkey before. But that lady was not so gracious as she might have been. In the first place, she could hardly be persuaded that the Captain and Caroline were really man and wife, and her reception of the young bride Avas exceedingly cool. Besides, she had not bargained for married lodgers, and the Captain had as yet made no arrangements about terms. The good lady, therefore, was determined not to make herself too agreeable until after a private conference with Mellor. But the astonishment with which Caroline saw the evident displeasure of Mrs. Torkey, was far surpassed by her inspection of the Captain's apartments."], [211, "Caroline's honeymoon. 203 Judging by the outward appearance of the man, and the society he kept, one would have expected, at least, a certain degree of elegance, if not splendour, in his home, but this was the point upon which his closest intimates had not been enlightened. Captain Mellor would take his friends to the club or to the theatre ; he would even, upon slight encouragement, take a friend or two to dine with him at some of the houses he frequented, though he had met more than once Avith some rebuffs in trying this experiment, but he never invited them to Jermyn Street. Indeed, scarce one of these cronies knew where he actually lived. If by chance he was strolling with a companion in the neighbourhood of his lodgings, he would dexterously propose a walk in another direction, or plead an appointment.

The truth was, that the Captain spent every penny upon his own person, and per sonal indulgences. Every item in the shabby apartments was the property of Mrs. Torkey, and had done good service for years before Captain Mellor had availed himself of them. Upon the strength of handsome curtains, mainly, the drawing room looked well from the street, but all glory of color had faded long ago from the well-Avorn carpet.

Caroline had too much con fidence in herself to follow the example of the former, and too little romance"], [214, "206 MARTYRS to fashion. or idealism in her nature to belong to the latter class. She was quick enough to perceive the blunder she had made, but far too proud to let the Captain see anything like astonishment in her face. Some would have felt a little compunc tion in bringing a sprightly, handsome girl, in the first flush of her radiant youth, to such a dingy home, but the Captain was not blessed with sensibility. He had frequently visited the humble cottage of the artist at Merton, and knowing how poor and ill-furnished that was, he concluded that Caroline would be easily satisfied. But he had made no allowance in his calculations, if he had ever calculated at all, for the enthusiastic visions of a young girl. He did not consider what knights of romance, what heroes of"], [215, "Caroline's honeymoon. 207 impossible novels go to the composition of that \" coming man,\" the future hus band. Nor had he taken into consider ation the great change for a young girl to make, from the fresh breezes of the Oxfordshire fields and meadows ; the freedom of the sketching mornings with her father about the lanes ; the sunshine, woods, and flowers, to be exchanged for the confinement of a drawing room and bedroom in Jermyn Street. Caroline accepted her fate in silence, she received graciously the little endear ments of the Captain, who had married her for his own gratification, not for hers, and had as yet been charmed with her loveliness and saucy beauty.

But when the Captain left her for a private interview with Mrs. Torkey, Caroline rose from her seat on the dingy sofa, and paced the drawing-room' tingling from head to foot, with intense passion. There was no escape, there was nothing but to bear it, yet she burned to revenge herself, and pondered deeply how she could humiliate him, and make him feel that she was not entirely at his mercy. There was one thing she could do, and she did that at once ; she sat down, and wrote to Laura Mostyn, concealing nothing, and fully detailing the bitterness of her secret feelings. Laura was touched keenly by this letter, which had at least one good effect upon her. Every lingering spark of affec tion she yet entertained for Captain Mellor was extinguished at once.

Mrs. Torkey also having been re-assured by sundry plau sible suggestions from the Captain, became almost affable, and contrived, with some assistance from Caroline's purse, to make the apartments look more cheerful.

Lingering gleams of sunlight had smiled lovingly upon the river and the woods occasionally, as if unwilling to leave the pleasant landscapes of Merton ; but now, the grey, sad, russet garb was over all.

Even the inevitable sorrows which creep in the household unawares, at Merton as elsewhere, seem to lose half their keenness in the beaming reflection of those kindling logs.

He was not a stranger at the house ; indeed, Cruppy found it con venient to make friends where he could. \"It is very handy, when you are overtaken by a storm,\" Cruppy used to say, \" to know where you can make sure of a jug of ale, while you wait till the storm is blown over.\" \" You can't be expected to fall in love with all the dairymaids between Merton and Oxford,\" he said, on another occasion, \" but they most of 'em takes kindly to a little soft soap, Avherever you go.\" The farmers sitting by the roaring"], [224, "216 MARTYRS TO FASHION. fire, perhaps from old experience of the readiest way to encourage Cruppy, im mediately offered him a glass of grog. The result was magical. Cruppy, who seemed before tongue-tied with horror and cold, found his voice, and his ideas returned to him instantaneously. He had been a little perplexed likewise, the cause of which will presently appear. \" I think, neighbours, there's somebody drowned at the ferry,\" said Cruppy, emphatically, when a little consideration had shown him a way to overcome his own difficulty. \"Drowned at the ferry?\" said several voices at once.

When they reached the river bank they met the ferryman. \"We can do nothing without a boat,' he said, \"if you wait a bit, I can get one from the mill above.\" In a few minutes he was pulling towards the party, in an old pleasure boat, large enough to carry the whole party. \" It's a queer time to go fishing,\" said Cruppy, \" I only hope we mayn't find some poor wretch at the weir.\" \"What I fear, is,\" said the ferryman, \" that somebody has been trying to come across, and overreached themselves in pushing out, for I heard a splash in the water, and that roused me.\" It was a curious scene. The evening was so dark, and the wind howled sadly through the tall trees, which at this part of the river lined each bank. The"], [227, "219 CRUPPY ON GUARD. farmers shuddered as they looked by turns into the black depth each moment, half in fear, yet hoping at the same time that some human figure would rise to the surface. \" Pull hard, if you will be so good,\" said the ferryman, \" for if I lose my boat, I lose my living.\" \" How deep should you think it is here,\" asked one of the farmers. \"A matter of fifteen or twenty feet, I should say, Master Hicks, and the bend in the river makes the water run sharp just hereabouts.\" \"Oh Lord, what's that!\" said Cruppy, as a black mass was floating just ahead of them. One of the farmers held up the lantern, and another made a thrust with his pole. It proved to be the ferry-boat floating slowly bottom upAvards. Having"], [228, "220 MARTYRS TO FASHION. secured it, they pulled slowly onward, till they could hear the noise of the water falling over the weir. \"A likely place that,\" said the ferry man, \" the water ain't so high now as when poor old Amos Burton was lost, so that a body wouldn't be carried over.\" \"But why shouldn't it float past here ?\" asked a farmer. \"It's deep under the weir, and the current is strong, you'll find it there if anywhere.\" As they pulled slowly along, they plunged the poles into the river from time to time. When they came nearer the weir the rush of the water com bined with the darkness, gave a strange unearthly feeling to the scene, and filled the minds of these simple men with gloomy horror. Their first idea that it had been done as a practical"], [229, "221 CRUPPY ON GUARD. joke was dismissed for a more serious solution. \" Shouldn't wonder if this job isn't murder,\" said one. \" Why so ?\" enquired another. \" Some body coming from Wallingford with a lot of money has been watched and pitched over, you think ?\" \" Then how did the robber get away ?\" \" perhaps he could swim.\" This appeared a probable solution, and a feeling of horror seized upon the party. Men like these are not so accus tomed to the daily catalogue of crimes that unfortunately fills our papers, and a serious crime produces a great sensa tion in local circles. \"Now for a sharp pull,\" said the ferryman, \" and I'll slip the rope over the timbers of the weir, and see if I can find anything.\""], [230, "222 MARTYRS TO FASHION. The ferryman, accustomed all his life to the river, walked nimbly across the narrow ledge of the weir, while Cruppy held the lantern as high as he could. \" How's this ?\" he muttered to himself, \" the water don't flow through the weir at the usual spot. Hi ! mate, hand us the lantern, will you.\" \"Quick, quick, for God's sake!\" he shouted a moment after. \" There's a man here, as sure as I'm alive.\" Cruppy, the nimblest of the party, leaped out of the boat, carrying one of the ropes they had brought, and managed, by taking the ferryman's hand, to get a foothold on the weir.

Cruppy, upon the signal being given, pulled lustily, and soon a rigid shape was hauled into the boat, amongst the terror-stricken farmers. \"Don't lose a minute,\" said the ferryman. \" I'll leave my boat here at the weir till the morning. Let us get ashore at once, and fetch a doctor, somebody.\" \"Very little use fetching the doctor,\" Cruppy said, \" but I'll go all the same,\" and as soon as they reached the shore, he dashed into Wallingford with his utmost speed.

Cruppy had never in his life before made such good use of his time, but the medical man he brought back with him, saw at once the case was hopeless. \" The man had been dead for an hour or two,\" he said. Then came the enquiry who he was, but nobody knew him, and many sugges tions were thrown out as to how he came by his death. The doctor looked care fully, but could find no trace of a blow, no sign of a wound.

THE SERVANTS' HALL. It is not to be wondered at that the movements of Sir Charles, or rather, Hugh Sinclair, began to cause some speculation in the servants' hall. The strange visit their master had received on that particular dusky evening, when Ambrose had brought the lamp to his study, had created great wonderment. Ambrose, as in duty bound, said little, though by many mysterious hints he gave his fellow servants to understand that he knew a great deal more than he chose to tell.

The demeanour of this man was almost saintly. The demure way in which he received Captain Mellor, who was knoAvn to be somewhat lax in his morality, and respecting whom many little adventures were recorded, greatly to the amusement of the other servants, but which appeared to shock Ambrose severely, had often amused his master.

If anybody could have got anything out of Ambrose, it would have been Maggie Reed, a pert and sprightly housemaid, Avhose laughing looks and bright eyes had charmed many besides Ambrose. It was extremely amusing to the other servants to watch the saintly glances of Ambrose fixed upon Maggie. He followed her with cat-like movements, constantly enquiring after her health, and taking, in his peculiar way, great interest in her.

She felt certain that Ambrose knew some secret of his master's, and tried hard to get him to unravel it, but he Avas as close as the grave. Maggie never lost an opportunity of disparaging her admirer, especially if Mrs. Prunella happened to be Avithin hearing. Generally she Avas contented to put Maggie down Avith scornful looks, but sometimes she defended Ambrose more pointedly. A dance had been held in the servants' hall, which was severely condemned by Ambrose, and Maggie was the loudest in ridiculing CO O his Puritanism. \" Nonsense, Maggie,\" said Mrs. Pru nella, Avho heard her. \" Wre have been,"], [240, "232 MARTYRS TO FASHION.

Thanking her coarse companion, she rose from the ground, stiff, weary, and hungry, and went over to the barracks again, to seek the sentinel who had befriended her on the previous evening. The sweet voice and expressive eyes of the girl had made quite an impression upon the tender-hearted soldier, and he received her with much warmth. \"I am afraid,\" said he, \"you'll get into trouble of some sort, if you have"], [271, "263 AN EPISODE. no home to go to.

They waited, hoAvever, till the morning, being unable to decide upon any course of action, and then, in response to his urgent entreaty, sent a messenger to Merton. In the meantime, the man explained his own share in the matter. \" I am not going to keep secrets now the man is dead,\" said he, \" Sir Charles Sinclair came to me, and told me that the person who had charge of a relative subject to fits of insanity, was compelled to resign his post, and asked me to"], [277, "269 THE INQUEST. undertake it. I received a recommenda tion from the asylum, where I had been employed for some years. I was told to come over to Wallingford early in the day, and the person there would give me instructions. I went, and found a gentleman there, a physician, who told me his name was Santi ; a very gentle manly, and accomplished man. He gave me some particulars as to how I should act Avhen these fits came on, for it seemed that at other times the man's intellect was clear, and he was as gentle as a child.\" \" For some reason, this gentleman, Santi, did not seem satisfied with his position. He made no complaint against Sir Charles, but when I made bold to ask him where he was going to, or what was to be his future occupation, he said, that giving up his present post"], [278, "270 MARTYRS TO FASHION. would reduce him to complete poverty, but that he would rather endure any suffering than keep it any longer. I asked him for my own sake, if it was because Sir Charles was hard to please, but he said, no, Sir Charles had been extremely liberal, but there were other reasons. We parted in a most friendly way, and Santi gave me an address in London, where a letter would reach him, if any difficulty should occur respecting the lunatic.\" \" When Sir Charles came, he seemed very much grieved to hear that Santi was gone. We then talked about the treatment of the lunatic. He gave me no particular directions, for he seemed troubled in his mind. I noticed as one thing peculiar, that Sir Charles en deavoured not to be seen by the lunatic. While we had been talking, and settling"], [279, "271 THE INQUEST. terms, the lunatic was walking in the orchard at the back, and an assistant was with him. He was talking quite rational and reasonable to the man, when suddenly he stopped, and listened, as a man might do, hearing a voice he knew, which he hadn't heard for years. How he came to do so, was, no doubt, through the back door being open. Sir Charles had spoken in rather a loud tone, and it was his voice this poor fellow heard. Before the man who was with him could prevent him, he had dashed through the orchard, and leaped a hedge nearly as high as himself, which separated the orchard from the road leading to the ferry. All this I did not knoAv at the moment, for my man rushed breathless into the house, just as Sir Charles went away, to tell me of it. At first I thought it advisable to follow"], [280, "272 MARTYRS TO FASHION.

I was wandering about all the afternoon without finding him, and was just going back by the ferry, being the nearest way.\" \" But how do you know that the man is brother to Sir Charles ?\" enquired the ferryman. \" The physician, Santi, while giving me directions, accidentally spoke of him as Sir Charles's brother. I don't think he intended it.\" This Avas all the explanation the man had to give, and, after a consultation with the doctor, and two or three far mers, it was decided to set him at liberty.
