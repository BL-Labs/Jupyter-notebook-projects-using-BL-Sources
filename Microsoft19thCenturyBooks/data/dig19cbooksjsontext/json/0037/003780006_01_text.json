And this, to the double end, that the. panel's minds may not be abused, and that he suffer no hurt from misapprehension directing them to a mistaken verdict. At the same time, be it not thought, for a moment, that we desire this proem to be considered in the light of an ordinary preface. Common-sense forbid !\u2014 although small is the difference, probably, between a long preface and a voluminous appendix ; if the advantage be not with the former, in meeting with people who are more willing to leam what they have to expect, than content to count over again the \" spade Georges\" already in their pockets. And if our \"legion\" readers do demur to its magnitude, or\u2014 permit us to substitute a more modest term \u2014 its longitude, we must take shelter behind our prospectus : viz., Poems, Songs, &c. &c. The &c. must be our defence in this matter ; and they who care not to follow us from the beginning can pass at once to that part of the Volume where our Muse, somewhat diffidently though not unhopefully, becomes a candidate for their suffrage. If, by so doing, they are no gainers in knowledge . why ! we must simply be losers in paper. The \"august WE,\" as it has facetiously been called, chosen in prefer ence to the more egotistic pronoun,\u2014 and one of which must be somewhat protrusive in a \"profession of faith\"\u2014 we have most seriously considered. I' faith ! we ape at nothing by the use of it. a"], [10, "PROEM. VI There is a French proverb which says \u2014 \"He that excuseth himself accuseth himself :\" and in certain circumstances, it may be, the adage will prove a 'true one. Yet would we always prefer an investigation where a question of principle is involved, rather than allow the same to be either dwarfed or magnified by any doubts or mists which may surround it. Besides ; there is a good old English saw, not a whit less true ; that \u2014 ' ' Every herring must hang by its own head : \" \u2014 and if so, then it is as clear as one of Euclid's \"self -evidents,\" that a head was contemplated for it by which it could be hung. Hence is it, that in our preface we would essay, first, to settle the character and just object of some of our Muse's creations ; and, in the end, insure for ourselves a fair-going, average, respectable head of our own, whereby to'hang. . . We know, full well indeed, from the very nature of some 'of our pleas, as surely as ever a \"leader\" in Court, of Queen's Bench, Exchequer, or Chancery can tell that he will have .'gowned brothers down upon him with whole wigsful of battery, prepared' to resist him from all the Malakoffs and Mamelons in the Kingdom of laws, before he has well laid- down a parallel, that we shall not have all the Court with us. And therefore have we taken counsel of a still more sage Scots ajdom, premonitory : \u2014 \" Highlanders \u2014 shoulder to shoulder!\" \u2014 to the end that our \" investment,\" of facts, may prove as decisive, if not so bloodless, as we could wish. What we have written, we have written : and we would not have .one word of it altered. For, as the truth has often \u2014 how often to our hurt ? \u2014 compelled us both to speak and act \"in consonance with it, without fear as without favour, so has it been the principle with which we commenced, and we trust have finished, these few jottings. Had we any misgivings, we should have made our alterations or amendments before they met the public eye. If in the treatment of some subjects we seem to have^accomplished sim plicity ; generously be it conceded to us the aim so to do. Rather, how ever, will we accept the charge of puerility, than split upon the rock so fatal to many an amateur writer : viz., believing the greatest 'achievement in \" the intellectual\" to be the inditement of the obscure, the metaphysical, the mysterious, and the impossible-to-be-analysed. In the spirit of our Merchant-tailor's junior stitcher, in short, deeming the very climax of genius to be the writing of something whjch nobody could understand !"], [11, "PROEM. VII On the contrary ; we would wish not only, ourselves, to apprehend, what we have written, but to have it clear to the minds of others, also. Not carried away by the mere love of jingling rhyme, lacking sense, we would avoid the fate of the hapless \"local,\" in his Sunday-school address to the children, when he attempted a verse of Dr Watts', with variations, thus : \u2014 \" Let dogs delight to bark and bite, And 'mprove each shining hour : . And bears and lions gtowl and fight In every opening flower. \" In a word : With all due deference toour pedal-playing, lock-stitching, Wheeler & Wilson oracle, aforesaid, we much prefer the common-sense, plain, he-that-runneth-inay-read sort of thing. , \u2022 ' What would -it avail one, for -instance?\u2014 Who would so much as thank us? \"were We to follow in the wake of that most learned and erudite of bodies, the American Association for '.the Achievement of Science, and string our verses ' together with \"pearl, 'of knowledge, even, after their fashion ; giving them so \"the States-united and the World-at-large, simplex munditiis, as in the following inimitable quatrain \u2014 \" The homologies of the synomosal bone show The posterior half of the arch zygomatic Not developed by the macrodatylic oboe, As some would-contesid, of the javel periphrastic.\" Readers ! we shall not .Yankee-doodle you, after that style, at any rate. At the out-set we hinted there were matters in this Work\u2014 and those more especially which were merely \" Extracts\" from another one\u2014 on which it might be desirable to offer some comment. We must restrict such desire, however. For, were we to indulge too much, our \"preface\" would be bigger than our face, and we should ignore the first principles of commercial policy, in expending upon superstate matter the little profit we reckoned upon frc-un this, our first \"wholesale\" venture. And yet we are bound to notice some half-dozen, or so, if for no other reason than that the several critiques with which we have been honoured from subscribers who have read our specimen pages, while favourable with out exception, yet shew such a diversity of appreciation as to make this a necessity."], [12, "VIII PROEM.

These are about all that demand a few words, explanatory ; most of them bearing on religious matters, and being therefore of more importance. Our secular subjects, like Tom Hood's eyeless bodkin, may \"look out\" for themselves. But even the afore-named* may only be noticed briefly, cursorily. Neither the argumentum ad hominem, nor the argumentum ad judicium, can be gone into in a preface : though we hope to consider them more fully, at another time and place. We state but the simple truth, as our MSS. extant will prove, when we affirm that the opinions formed on those topics from which several of our \"Extracts\" are taken, in relation hoth to Church and State, were enunciated a decade of years prior to either the parliamentary and ecclesiastic action touching the former, or the democratical, as affecting the latter, which so distinguishes the present time. And we must not neglect, here, in simple justice to our more than Thousand subscribers \u2014 alike to those whose names are, and to them whose names are not, upon our list \u2014 to state plainly that not one of them can any more than can a single member of our own family, be held responsible for, or even to endorse, the statements put forth or views advocated in this"], [13, "PROEM. IX proem. And for this most conclusive reason, that they were not aware of its existence, even ; it being partly explanatory, and partly of the nature of an advertisement of other and yet unpublished works. We, at any rate, and we alone, are responsible for the matter therein. May it commend itself for the honesty of its purpose, if for naught else! In an Age so rife as is the present with resolves on the part of peoples to emancipate them from the over-ridings and trammels of Class ; from the tyranny of statutes which make the very blood of a freedman to boil ; and from customs which are not yet, though they ought to have been long-ago and altogether, obsolete ; to free themselves alike from the fripperies of puppet state, and the solemn fooleries of sectarian dogmatists ; it will surely not be held that we are altogether unjustified in levelling a-shaft at local and sectional abuses, which, in our very sufferance of them, tend only to the confirmation of all these : \u2014 swelling them out to ridiculous proportions, often, in their imagined superexcellence, and absurd claims. We are not at all opposed \u2014 and we say this modestly, lest we be charged with presumption \u2014 we are in no wise opposed to that just weight and influence which members of the \" Second Estate \" ought to have from their stake in the Country, and from the admittedly-great intelligence which their very wealth enables them to obtain and bring to the consideration of great national and international interests. But, Class legislation must cease from the face of the Earth. They must carry, at least, their own burthens. The declared will of a Nation they must not oppose. Else, will their legislative functions presently cease to exist ; the walls of their House of Assembly be engrossed with a MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN ; and the Lord Chancellor himself be sent a wool-gathering. But what have we any right to expect, so long as in their own domains we continue to worship with our bodies and our souls, lords manorial and gods rural ; with a servile renunciation of rights political and social that it would flush with envy the cheeks of an Ignatius Loyola and a whole Con sistory or College of Jesuits to see ; sacrificing on altars with a helot obsequiousness, a more degraded serfdom \u2014 because in a brighter Era \u2014 than any records of the feudal ages can attest ? What can all this tend to, but to confirm the power which has too long bound the people in chains, and rivet yet faster the gyves with which they have for centuries been fettered ?"], [14, "PROEM. X If any apology be needed, then, for our exposure of that meanness of spirit which we have been pained to see in a thousand instances in our own experience, this is it. The object we propose to accomplish is a two -fold one :\u2014 for the present to open a Court of Appeal, only : the whole facts of the \"causes,\" and a hundred more to be added thereto, being reserved for our History : and to offer samples of the material, in the form of \" Extracts,\" of which our next Work now preparing for the Press\u2014 \" Telescopic Musings \"\u2014is to be builded up. With respect to what has been advanced in relation to the Established Church, its position, and prospects ; to the crying shame of over-gorged bishoprics and simony pluralities, in conjunction with, or alongside of, starveling curacies ; we shall have more to say, logically, and in a greatly enlarged form, also, in the work above-mentioned. It may be said here, however, that we know, what with Curates' Augmentation Fund and other helps, the \"ways and means\" of the most zealous labourers in Christ's vineyard, of those who must bear the heat and burthen of the day, have been materially increased of late. It is a good sign ; although greater and more radical will be the changes presently to be accomplishes1 if we mistake not ; when the Church shall no longer be supported (?) \u2014 trai. nelled and hindered, we think \u2014 by the State. Even allowing that the literality of the command to the early bishops is not now to be insisted upon \u2014 \" provide ye neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses : \" \u2014 still, who can shut their eyes to the violence done to the entire spirit of HIS rule and Kingdom, in the lawn sleeves and fine linen, the palatial grandeur and diocesan \"gules\" and \"verts,\" and princely equipages of their modern successors ; in the very face of the obtruded wants of the Church, and the necessities of her subordinate ministers ? Could it promote the cause of religion, in any degree, to have it told us that in certain wide-lying fields of missionary labour, the self-sacrificing martyr Evangelist has had to toil on through morass and swamp and beneath scorching sun, spending that physical strength which should have been spared him for the exhaustive duties of the separate stations, from sheer lack of funds to provide him fitting transport ; all-while the very"], [15, "PROEM.

Alas ! poor Mulligatawnies ! We surely cannot be wrong in this : \u2014 that it was monstrous to hear the great and continued out-cry from want of Church extensions, Church accom modation, more sittings, &c, at the very time that eight or ten thousand pounds could be expended on the erection or enlargement of a bishop's palace;* for the aristocratic residence of a professed \"servant\" of a Master who had not \"where to lay His head\" (!) \u2014 that it was monstrous to have known \"fishers of men,\" with an understood or nominal income of ten or fifteen thousands a year, but with one really nearer fifty or sixty or seventy thousands ; while many hard-working subsidiaries \u2014 they who, the Apostle says, preaching the Gospel ought to live of it \u2014 have had doled out to them a miserable pittance of forty or fifty or sixty pounds, per annum, as their living ! Nor let it be said we are drawing, in the slightest, upon imagination. Not longer ago than the 20th of May, 1870, we received by post a letter from the Vicar of Harlow, in Essex, asking a contribution of one shilling toward 4000 which were being collected to secure a gujmt for the augmenta tion of the living, which was only .\u00a370 a year ; and \u00a3_\\o of which was quite uncertain !! But, if there were the slightest doubt as to the apostolic ' ' all-things-in common\" character of the Church, and of the tender consciences and fine principles of some of our clerical dignitaries ; not to speak of their utter regardlessness of their \"poor brethren\" who are, after all, the real pioneers and champions of the Cross, and whom we yet see so often \"faint by the way ;\" and of the disgraceful condition of our laws \u2014 the result of class legislation, of course \u2014 which can allow it ; such a piece of profligacy as we gather from the following would be sufficient to dispel it : \u2014 * In little more than 20 years after the establishment of the Royal Commission (1835) there was expended on bishops, bishops' palaces, bishops' gardens, bishops' stables, &c, no less a sum than ,\u00a3304,933 !"], [16, "PROEM. XII \" An evening journal has called attention to the amount of Public Money which had passed into the hands of the Reverend Thomas (in about 37 years). That clerical person, nephew of such a Lord Chancellor as he of whom some wicked wit said ' that nobody could be as wise as Thurlo w looked, ' held three sinecures : he was Patentee of Bankrupts ; Keeper and Clerk of the Hanaper ; and Prothonotary of the Durham Court of Pleas. To compensate him for the abolition of the first, he received annually \u00a37352. 14. 6 ; of the second \u00a34028; of the third \u00a3335. 12. 3;\u2014 the last a trifle scarce worthy of his acceptance. About \u00a31 1,700 a year . . . about \u00a3432,000 in that time . . . that excellent clergyman received from the unfortunate rate payers, as compensation for the abolition of useless appointments conferred upon him by a loving Uncle. We have not a Clergy List at hand to ascertain whether he was the holder of one or more livings. It is to be hoped that so saintly a man \u2014 for surely, (continues the journal), it must have been as a reward for saintliness that Providence conferred upon him nearly half a million, sterling, \u2014 had a cure of souls somewhere or other. We cannot help wishing to know something more about the happy recipient of \u00a3432. 5\u00b03- 2. 9-\" We, on the contrary, most devoutly wish the Country had never heard tell of him, at all.

And how many more of the like stamp have there not been, who, in their boundless ambition, their lust after wealth, and the more-than-heaven worth hope of constituting an earthly oligarchy, might have embodied all their litany in the last verse of Holy Willie's prayer? Oh ! the inimitable satire ! the truthfulness to nature, human and all other, of Scotland's immortal bard. Listen, how he pictures such to the life :\u2014 But, Lord, remember me and mine, Wi' mercies temporal and divine, That I for gear and grace may shine, Excelled by nane ; And a' the glory shall be thine, Amen, amen.\""], [17, "PROEM. xm Truly, indeed, Christ's words to the rich man who had kept all the commandments from his youth, up, and yet lacked something to entitle him to the inheritance of heaven \u2014 \" Go, sell that thou hast, and give unto the poor :\" \u2014 would seem to have died a natural death ; when not the poor, alone, but the very fellow-workers in the ministry are thus suffered to want, whilst plenty and affluence crown the boards of a full-fraught hierarchy. If there is one thing in the world, more than another, of which we have long been morally assured, it is this : \u2014 that the religion of the Cross can not be effectually propagated by \"purple and fine linen.\" The inoculation won't take : albeit the same be enforced by an Order in Council. It is in view of these considerations then, principally, that we must accept the words already alluded to \u2014 ' Besides ; of priests, such as they are, We've qitantian suff. already.' As far as we can judge, we really want a great many more ; but diffe rently circumstanced ; differently elected ; differently ruled ; and differently supported. It is nevertheless true, that there is another view, a different phase of the subject presented in those words, which, if properly reflected, would no longer make it a wonder to any one, that among the many truly noble, earnest, Christian characters which adorn her temples and strengthen her bulwarks, we should yet detect occasional counterfeit Pauls and Apolloses and Cephases, from whom the Church suffers lamentably ; and from whom she might not have, except for political considerations and interests, lay patronage, and other cognate evils which so defile the one, and make assailable the other. But, to the records of our History we must leave the indisputable facts, and conclusions deducible therefrom, with which to establish our position : \u2014 that, even as one of our Essayists showed in the 1 6th Century it particularly was, we still have men in the Church who would have been better as Con naught Rangers than enduring soldiers of the Cross : \u2014 who would have been ploughing the seas or the land, probably, instead of furrowing badly the human heart : \u2014 have been on the Mart of commerce ; at the receipt of"], [18, "PROEM. XIV custom ; anywhere, rather than taking their stand as watchmen on the towers of the Lord :\u2014 except for the present anomalous constitution of the Church, and the evils of patronage and power, lay and irresponsible, which we so frequently see exercised on grounds political or connexional : on any, in fact, rather than on personal qualification and fitness for the Office. Our stubborn facts we will then leave, like the Auctioneer's stalwart, full-boned horses, \"to speak for themselves !\" Grateful we are, at the same time, for this opportunity of professing the deep heart-felt pleasure derivable from the knowledge that there are so many, on the other hand, \u2014 numbers, God be thanked for it ! \u2014 within our own life's ken, of whom the very opposite of all this must be said. Men, whose Sunday ministrations, strictly as they are performed, and humanly judging, embrace not a tithe of the benefits they confer upon their fellow men : ministering to them in sickness, not by day only, but through the watches of the night, often ; and giving liberally of their strength, as of their substance, to the bodily relief of their parishioners : \u2014 Men, who sup port the Christian character, as they do the gentlemanly : who acknowledge there is but ONE GOD, and act up to such profession : who resolutely refuse to make DEUS and DUX convertible terms : zealous in their Office ; friends of the poor ; not satellites of the rich '; lovers of freedom ; patrons of learning ; who have by a true, undeviating, life-long obedience to a divine Master, whilst honouring their God, elevated their own natures as far beyond the estimation, as above the praise, of man. These are the men whose friendship and esteem we deem it our richest earthly guerdon to obtain ; and to forfeit which, our greatest present loss. In using the term, \"satellites of the rich,\" we are reminded and feel im pelled to record, that we never have felt more disgusted with the hollow, temporizing profession of religion ; with the most partial exercise of the duties of a minister, or steward, or overseer of a Christian Church, than in some particular cases of no very olden time ; wherein certain clergymen have \"banned,\" in a sense \"excommunicated\" a parishioner tradesman for an unpremeditated, incidental, lapse from the code of virtue ; not only shunning all recognition of him publicly, but positively injuring him and his dependent family by the withdrawal of their business favours ; and by the influence which their conduct exerted upon others of their own class and station. And yet, nevertheless, with coward conscience, could tacitly condone the ten-thousand-times-more-flagrant conduct of some noble patron, who systematically violated the marriage oath by an understood, if"], [19, "PROEM.

Stem, severe, relentless, cruel, persecuting the poorer man : affable, smiling, smooth, obsequious, without one whispered imputation, even, of sin against Heaven, or an outrage upon decency, to the man of title and estate who flattered them with the amenities of a host, and the honour (?) of companionship. It seems astonishing that the conduct of such should not have been re pudiated by the whole Order. Was Nathan a myth, then? His pet-lamb story an allegory, only? Or, is his race, to the irremediable loss of the World, as defunct, as thoroughly extinct, as ever a brachiopod's of the Lower Silurian Stratum ? And what but this deferential spirit, this obsequious cringing was it, that so long prevented an organized opposition to a damnable custom, which had disgraced alike Alnwick Castle and our Town, for Ages, in the Bacchanalian revelries of a July Fair Sunday night ; when the tradesmen of the town were invited to drink freely in the Steward's room in the Castle ; and after being well drunken, were paraded through the streets to the Market Cross to assist at the \" calling of the Fair : \" while the commoner people were in dulged within the gates of the former with an unlimited amount of strong drink ; \u2014 or when the limit, at any rate, was the condition of being too drunk to drink any more : when the barrels were annually broached there with the perfect consciousness, with the certain knowledge, that the people would so get drunk : and on a Sunday evening, too, during the hours of divine service, as we have said ? O scandalum magnum ! How often have not we seen this ; and been taunted with our assumed, supercilious refusal to take part therein. We shall see, anon. What, moreover, but this unmanly fear of \" risin' coroneted ha'r\" was it, that for so long a time kept in abeyance the full responses of the choir, and eke the congregation of our Church ; except that the lord of the manor preferred the old-fashioned, sing-song hum-drum of an un tunable parish clerk, and his wretched antiphonals, in those portions of"], [20, "PROEM.

But, of this matter of Duke worship, so intimately associated with Lay Patronage, can there be any doubt ?"], [23, "PROEM. XIX Would to God ! it were even bounded by this patronage in relation to the Church. Alas ! too successfully does it compete both with the public and the divine service ; and too frequently, also ; as we shall undertake to show presently, and beyond all doubt, in our third Work also preparing for publication : viz. : \u2014 \"The History of Alnwick. in Our Own Times,\" chiefly : showing \"the intimate ties\" and \"strong relations\" which have \"bound\" the inhabitants thereof to the Ducal House of Percy : viewed in four aspects \u2014 political, social, commercial, and religious. Deus and Dux convertible terms, indeed ! What a poor impotent word to convey our meaning ! Have we not a triumvirate \u2014 Deus, D ux, and Mammon ? but with this peculiarity in the government, that the two latter have in some places usurped well-nigh all the power : Or, at any rate, will allow the former to have any rule or sway on One day of the week, only : \u2014 and not always on that. Nor would it be a very mean parallel, after all, were we to compare our practice, if not our faith, with that of the Hindoos of the Himalayas. We, alike with them, abstain from ablutions in our worship : but \u2014 by the peak of the Greater Kylas ! \u2014 we are still liker them in another respect ; in that we do not so much regard the Great Spirit who dwelleth in heights unap proachable, as we do our petty gods and minor divinities : and from pretty much the same belief, too ; that we may omit largely of our homage to the Good Spirit who will do us no harm ; and devote the more of our time and service to the propitiation of such as are likely, from the neglect of them, to do us some mischief. Hence, our everlasting \"poojah;\" our humble obeisance to our lesser, and nearer-at-hand, if not more-accessible deities : \u2014 those who have so many of the good things of earth and air and water at their arbitrary disposal. Nor is it with us, any more than with the Paharis, that the common people, alone, walk about with prayer-mills in their hands, grinding as"], [24, "PROEM. XX they go ; and with the significant words engraven thereon \u2014 \" O mane pad me han :\" [To Him of the lotus and the jewel] but which, in our case, might very fairly be rendered : [To Him of the loaves and fishes.] As for the short but comprehensive prayer inside the mill, we could find a thousand parallels, if occasion were, for that ! But, Oh ! ye worshippers of OM, TUT, or SUT, how are ye to be envied! For, what is your creed? \"To adore God, alone. To know God, alone : and to give up all other discourse :\" \u2014 while we find men ready to defer to a petty manorial lord, even in the ministrations of the temple : changing a service in his life ; and abrogating another at his death ; as though, in fact, our most holy things were part and parcel of himself and his estate. Nay ! hanging as if in token thereof, and with the most con summate impudence, his escutcheon upon the pulpit ! ! on the very watch tower of the LORD of LORDS, himself ! \u2014 ignoring the divine assurance that God is no respecter of persons ; but that all are equal in His sight : \u2014 giving the lie as it were, practically, to the declaration of the High and Lofty One who inhabiteth Eternity, that it is not to the Rich and the Mighty and the Noble He will look ; but to him that is of a meek and lowly spirit, and that trembleth at His word. What a miserable piece of toady-ism is it, then \u2014 not to use any stronger term \u2014 thus to glorify and mix up the fleeting casual honours due to mere worldly rank, with the service of the Great God, himself! Honours casual and fleeting, we have said ; and when hereditary, only, of intrinsic value easily estimated: though by the \"divine right\" (!) of Kings made transmissible from generation to generation, much in the same way as our ancestorial three-legged cutty-stool, with a hole in the top of it, may have been handed down from our Two-hundred-and-fifty-fifth Great- Grandfather in the flesh. [At which remote period of existence, by the bye, if Darwin gets a verdict, said hole must have proved of no small con venience to our relatives.] Oh, that we had but space, here, to complete our picture ; even though we never had the good fortune to have it, as Academicians say, ' ' hung upon the line.\" Deus and Dux, indeed !

Verily, we could not have been so far astray, after all, when we pro posed to add to the already-numerous titles of religious sects thatoi Duxists or Duke-worshippers. They are numerous enough, in all conscience, for the foundation of an Order. Yet, will it be believed ? these are the very men who, even in public company and over the amenities of an evening's friendly entertainment, will presume, will dare, to lecture you on the beauty of truth ! dilate with the fervour of a Paul on the virtue of sincerity ! and finish off with a peroration against disingenuous actions, and all manner of shuffling ! though they, themselves, were the very soul of honour, and the delegated vicegerents of the Deity on Earth. We are writing from absolute experience. We have, ourselves \u2014 who would reckon every attribute of our manhood degraded in being placed in the same category with theirs \u2014 been challenged by some of those trimmers with \"pretence ;\" with having \"kept\" our arm in sling for five years.

But so it is, ever. Just as we find the most cringing slaves, when invested themselves with power, to become the most infernal tyrants ; so is it with your political and social parasites.

Would it have made up for the absence of the One Grand Colossal Work, that they reli giously expended the whole sum, afterward, in fritters of little lions, petit conquerors, and collective statuary, all around ? The public, no less than"], [28, "PROEM. XXIV the subscribers, have answered this question, decisively. Oh ! it is a delicious history, we think : and with other delicacies yet to be served up, we may safely promise the veriest epicure such a feast as would travesty My Lord Mayor's civic banquet, even ; or the daintiest white-bait feed ever supplied to Ministerial order. \u2014 See Our History. In connection with stained-glass windows, we observe that our greatly respected and energetic Vicar, the Rev. E. B. Trotter, has just issued an address to the Young people and children of his Charge ; nor does he forget the parents, altogether, in his zeal for the beautifying of God's House. Yet, there can hardly be a doubt of it, except in such hands as his \u2014 he having had nothing to do with the misappropriation of the large balance before mentioned \u2014 the present scheme for a new Children's-Window must have proved a complete failure. For, people who had before subscribed liberally, and found themselves deceived, are everywhere remarking that the misappropriated moneys previously raised, if such had been used for the Nave of the Church, instead of the Chancel, would have been almost sufficient to have filled every window in it, without further dipping into the parishioner pocket. The only three windows in the Church now in bad repair, are those on the North side of the chancel ; and it shows how their flattering gift of the three upon the South was appreciated, that the lay rector has allowed the former to remain in such a wretched state for so long a time ; draughts and colds both annoying and dangerous to those seated there, notwithstanding ; and after all sorts of things, including great squares of sheet glass, had been tried to avert the same. We cannot help thinking, moreover, that it would much more have re dounded to the credit of our authorities, had they, on the restoration of our fine old Church more than 7 years ago, seen to provision being made for the replacement of the Ten Commandments, Creed, and Lord's Prayer, which for ages had been so conspicuous upon its East Walls : the former with the Cherubim overspreading them, as in Olden time these did the mercy seat of the Ark which contained them. It seems strange, truly, that so many years should have elapsed without any attempt at the replacement of those laws, &c, upon which the polity of"], [29, "PROEM. XXV the Church was founded : unless, indeed, the premier one of the decalogue \u2014 \" Thou shalt have none other Gods but me \" \u2014 be in these days deemed an impertinent and offensive reflection upon the divided worship of a people. It is long since we propounded our views on this subject to our Church wardens, as they will testify ; on learning that they had ' ' a balance in hand \" after the restoration in 1863 : viz. ; that so far from them condoning the obliteration of the Old Commandments, they couldn't possibly expend their then surplus better, than in having them decuplicated, and enamelled in letters of plain bold character upon every pillar in the Church. The sooner they are restored, at any rate, the better ; whether it be the business of the Officers of the Church, or that of His Grace as claiming the Chancel, to do so. We are quite aware, and we have been assured of it over and over again, that to this, our plain speaking and plain acting in accordance therewith, \u2014 to our unmeasured contempt for, and denunciation of, an abject mean servi lity to the \" powers that be ;\" and to our frequent exposure of that nauseat ing hypocrisy which has for years, as a High-Priest, sacrificed principle political and religious, alike, at the shrine of our Shire Magnates \u2014 may be referred, in a great measure, our own limited success in life. We might almost say, indeed, and by reason thereof \u2014 [the words are quoted reve rently] \u2014 \" Our enemies compass us like water : they come about us like bees : they keep us in on every side : they are more in number than the hairs of our head.\" But what then ? Three hundred years ago a chart was laid down by the celebrated, as unfortunate, Sir Walter Raleigh, which might enable any one, who would do so, to steer clear of the Scylla upon which so many have shipwrecked their fortune in life. He said, that he knew such success \"was no other than the fashioning ourselves to the nature and things of the times in which we live. For, however true it might be, yet no one may tell a Great Man that he is not just ; a General that he is not valiant ; or a Lady that she is not fair ; and expect afterward to be made a Counsellor, a Captain, or a Courtier.\" He also pertinently adds \u2014 \" Whosoever shall follow Truth too near the heels, it may haply knock out his teeth. \""], [30, "PROEM.

Whenever that be issued, we promise it shall speak with a challenge-note to them who, \"under the green tree,\" have scrupled not to impugn both our conduct and our motives, whenever these have been arrayed against that unquestioning, pitiful abasement of spirit ; that worse than-Oriental prostration at the feet of our territorial magnates, in every circumstance almost, political, social, commercial, and religious, which\u2014 we are sorry to write it\u2014 has been the bane of our Town ; Ay ! and which, we much fear, will eventually prove the decadence of it.

Need we more than point to the determined opposition to the North- Eastem main line of rail to the Town, in time past ; or that to the Western or Rothbury branch of later date ? We shall have a series of tableaux, we hope, in our History presently, in illustration of the several attempts, all of them frustrated, to have Railway communications obtained for our town, to conserve that trade which Alnwick has had for centuries ; but which now must be, nay ! which has already been, and will still more be, diverted from it to the extent of thousands of pounds annually. And this, by the opposition to such lines which has been offered, both openly and covertly, or actively and passively, by our Great Men ; because, forsooth ! the privacy and lordly seclusion of their noble seats might be somewhat lessened thereby ! We shall see whether every word, almost, then spoken prognostically with regard to the Rothbury or Western Line from our Town has not come true : and whether the tradesmen of Alnwick will not some day forgive us, in our warm feeling for its interests, an expression coarse and unpolite as we confess it to have been \u2014 \"that our Dukes didn't care one for such, when these were arrayed ever so slightly against their own prejudices or plans.\" And we propose to ourselves, to shew how it is they have so long dared to act so, with impunity.

An exceptional one, only, with us : albeit we have quite as extraordinary freaks of \" hailse,\" or salutation, in our own, as in any you will find 'tween the Mountains of the Moon and John o'Groat's dominion ; and affording the strongest evidence of the truth of our posi tion. We have no desire to ostracise [more than the mere record of this fact will do so] that famous and certainly devoted citizen, of Artillery Volunteer renown, who could willingly expose himself \" in the ranks,\" for an hour or more, in a pitiless drenching down-pour, at the sacrifice of his time, at the risk [it might almost be said, at the cost] of his life, and his family's incompensatable loss ; only that he might \"present arms,\" (! !) or fire a salute of so many guns, to an Ancient of Ermine, who, one moment before, and we are very sure, one moment after, wouldn't be aware that such a bit of potter's clay, as his own, cumbered the face of the Earth ! And yet ! \u2014 Oh, brave commentator on Jumna offerings and Juggernaut immolators !\u2014 who could turn back, half-way to Church on the following morning, for a few drops of rain on his West-of-England super ; and from a horrible dread of \" the rheumatics !\""], [35, "PROEM. XXXI tuition in the higher branches of science ; and in the same being offered free to our carriage-driving, fox-hunting merchants and professional gentle- men, whose pride would yet in a moment have revolted, we are sure, had the olden badges of the \"Charity School,\" viz.; red-tasselled cap, abbre- viated swallow-tails, scarlet waistcoat, and corduroy unmentionables, been made the marks of their acceptance? Offering? Nay, actually soliciting parents, even, who were worth their \"thousands,\" and as well able to educate their children as any nobleman in the Kingdom, to send their children there, who were at the very time paying for their education at the Borough schools ! Talk of consistency, and principle, and fair-dealing ! What a sop was this for the town ! For who is he that can receive continual douceurs, or daily obligations from another, and checkmate him immediately afterwards, if occasion arise, even upon principle? Let our Political History Answer the Question. But, as we said, what a likelihood in this, still further to sap the totter ing independence of the town : and which, we are sorry to think, so many of our money-above-all-things-loving tradesmen, and others, acceded to ; failing to perceive, apart from the love of independence for its own dear sake, that what is so pleasant now, might in the end prove to be wretchedly suicidal. For where should we be, if, after our public establishments had succumbed to irresistible power and secret influence, ' ' a King should arise who knew not Joseph?\" .... A nobleman is not bound always, and for ever, to educate his serfs. May we not ask, then, in the words of the patriot poet, regarding the few who are willing, for their own selfish objects, to be built up on the debris of the many ; those who lend themselves as facile agents to an overgrown power, if so only, they themselves shall be assured their guerdon ? \u2014 \u25a0\" Is there not Some chosen curse, some hidden thunder in the stars of Heaven, Red with uncommon wrath, to blast the men Who owe their greatness to the commune's hurt?\" Well. We may reserve the fuller discussion of the question of \"the serfdom of the 19th century,\" for our next Essay."], [36, "PROEM. XXXII We shall establish this fact, at least ; that we have had men amongst us who could prate of their freedom, even while hugging their chains. Yankee like, flaunting their flag of liberty in the very heartdom of slavery : whist ling their British Marseillaise in the very nursery-grounds of conscription : drivelling with a lachrymose pity over the poor rustic who had accepted the sergeant's shilling, and a bunch of bright ribbons to the fife-and-drum over ture of \" Britons never, nev-er, shall be slaves ! \" Mocking their fellows, even, who were eulogizing the fiction, and ignoring the fact : and ever with a seeming, beautiful unconsciousness that at their own doors, in their own most proper persons, was afforded the most ample and unanswerable justi fication of them all. And yet, why marvel we? Human nature is not so vastly different, now, from what it was in the days of Julius C\u00e6sar ; great as is the interval of time, and the vaunted advance of civilisation and freedom, between those days and our own. Then, we are told, Brutus, when he went out as the champion of liberty to slay the C\u00e6sar, and make his speech in the forum, had his own door opened for him by a slave chained to the lintel ! Beauti ful consistency ! And why should not we, then, in our day have the \"door opened,\" the \"opportunity offered\" by our pretended freeman when his Noble Master seeks an opportunity to enslave the people ? The paradox is not one whit more revolting in the eyes of some people, now-a days, than it was in those of the Romans. Moreover ; History will repeat itself, though somewhat varied, perhaps in its combinations. Have we said enough, then ? Or, now that we have taken upon our selves to prove a greater-than-Egyptian bondage, perhaps a single page more \u2014 one specimen page from our forth-coming History \u2014 will not be deemed greatly out of place ; even though it does attest a Cisatlantic mer chandise of body and soul, a thousand times more degrading to human nature than ever a New Orleans slave-mart could exhibit ; a willing bond age which we have fought, a life-time, against ; and which we still believe it to be our duty to denounce. We will take care to limn this, our part picture, with the pencil of Truth, itself; though the \"subjects\" of it will not now be treated with that Draconian severity which an aggregate of their deeds demands. It was in the year 1862 (or 63) that a Choral Society or Union was pro-"], [37, "PROEM. XXXIII jected for our town, of which every devotee of Euterpe was invited to form a part ; and, under the eccentric but undeniably-exquisite taste and leader ship of Mr Wm. Alphonse Leggatt, the then organist of St Paul's, Alnwick, \u2014 now of St Mary's Cathedral, Newcastle, \u2014 a success unprecedented in the town's musical annals was predicted. One feature in the projected scheme ought not to be lost sight of ; that Mr Leggatt, in striking contrast to many of his professional brethren, in the most generous manner offered his ser vices gratuitously to the Society ; although the labour of training and con ducting such a large body would have been immense. A fact conclusive, that Mr Leggatt's motives alone were the gratification and intellectual enjoyment of his townsmen, outside of all selfish considera tions, whatever ; and far above suspicion, even, of the presumptive ones which were so wrongly imputed to him. A day, then, was fixed for a general meeting to form a committee and make arrangements. The place fixed upon by the promoters, one of whom was the Curate of St Paul's, and another the much-respected Head-Master of it, was the Duke's school, aforesaid ; while the well-known singers of defunct choral societies were hunted up and solicited to attend : Mr Leg gatt, himself, the Rev. Mr , and a certain St Chrysostom Fiddlebow, being the most active \" resurrectionists.\" Guess the amazement, then, with which we and other members of St Michael's choir who had been invited, received an intimation, while at Church practice one night, that our then Incumbent did not wish his choir to join the projected Legatto-Pergolesian-Chrysostomian Society ! Of course, there was only one thing possible for us to do. And we did it. We demanded to know the reason for such a message being sent to us : \u2014 a most extraordinary one, we ventured to observe, to be sent to a voluntary, unpaid choir ! and one, at the same time, in direct opposition to the action of a brother clergyman, and the wishes of a large community, who had been consulted. There was no explanation, however. Of course not. Expla nation forsooth ! But there it was ; a plain, bare, presuming message to a voluntary choir ; and thereupon followed our plain, bare, declared resolu tion to allow no man, Incumbent or other, to dictate to us how we should spend our leisure hours. And we are glad to say we influenced a good portion of the adults of our choir."], [38, "PROEM. XXXIV Well : but the night of the meeting arrived; the attendance at the Duke's school was numerous ; and Rev. Mr took the chair. And now, it was to be made evident that the animus, whatever that was, had found its way to, and had its effect upon, the ear of the Duke, who was then rapidly nearing his dotage, and was easily led when diplomatically handled. The Chairman opened the business by announcing that \"he was sorry to say their scheme for forming a Choral Union must fall to the ground ; for he had just had an intimation that His Grace of Northumberland was averse to such a society being formed.\" \" No one,\" he added, \" could feel more disappointed than himself at the miscarriage of their project ; but it was useless to persist in the face of the Duke's opposition. Pie therefore re commended that we pursue the matter no further, for the present.\" On this occasion we were again spokesman, and asked for an explana tion : and in reply to our question \u2014 \"Whether we were to consider His Grace's opposition an active, or a merely-passive one, in not subscribing to the funds?\" \u2014 we were told by the Chairman that he feared it was an active one; for he would not. allow the boys of his school (Mr Leggatt's own choir) to sing. (!) We expressed our surprise, in no measured terms at this, seeing that His Grace had, only some few years before, brought a professor of music to the town, and borne a large share of the expenses of the popular classes then formed. And in the entire absence of any explanation, and of all consideration for the wishes of the town, or of anything to soften down his harsh, autocratic treatment of that meeting, we felt bound to move \u2014 \" that a vote of censure be recorded against him in its minutes, for arrogat ing such a presumptuous line of action, in direct opposition to the ex pressed wishes of a large community.\" Now ; we have never seen a bombardment by shell ; and hope we never shall. Yet, when the same has been pictorially illustrated, we have quite appreciated the almost rectangular dialysis of leg exhibited by those who were so fortunate as to be able to run away, when a fizzing, ricochetting Todtleben had alighted among them ! We had not the running away upon this occasion, it is true. But the horror depicted upon every face, at our daring proposition, was a sight to be remembered. Don't be sceptical. The expression given to the counte nances of the Indian mutineers, when about to suffer death by being blown"], [39, "PROEM. XXXV from the guns, was a de-light-ful one in comparison. The Chairman, him self, jumped up as if he had been operated upon by a fifty-thousand-plated Signor Galvani ; or, as if we had energized the marrow in his whole spinal canal. Gracious goodness ! To have arraigned Heaven, or charged Pro vidence with direct German proclivities in the late war, supposing that to have then taken place, would have been a comparatively venial offence on our part ! But to propagate a grudge against their live Duke ! Awful ! Horrible ! You might have seen in the eye of every one of them the pure undiluted \" Conjuro te! scelestissima-nequissima-spurcissima-iniquissima atque miserrima!\" of a Dominie Sampson. The Chairman protested \"that if we pressed our motion, he must vacate the chair ! He could n't put any such motion reflecting upon that nobleman ; for he was the Duke's servant ! The Duke paid his stipend as Curate of St Paul's ! !\" And now we have come to the revelation, to the uncovering, of the very ' ' pistil \" of our case. The Duke's Servant ! A minister of God ; an ambassador of the King of Heaven ; but the Duke's servant ! What a confession ; and what a Tishbite-ish smack the acknowledgment had about it ! In the olden time, the dignity of the Office and the sacredness of his Calling would have asserted themselves in such a profession as \"The Servant of the Most High God.\" But the servant of the Duke ! Bah ! irrespective of the merits of our proposition, or the righteousness of his conduct. This it was which only was wanting to complete our picture of degradation. But the \"Servant\" was saved. Not one present would second our motion of censure. Not very likely ; though nearly all admitted its being deserved. The chair was therefore vacated, at length, in due and formal manner ; and the Earth did not open her mouth and swallow us up. It was clear now, however, that the Duke's ear had been poisoned by misrepresentations of some kind. All were agreed upon that. And now just observe the curious action of these worthy independent members of the body commune, whenever the antidote to such poison had"], [40, "PROEM. XXXVI been administered. Some time after, when the Duke had veered about, and declared not his wish, only, but his intention to establish this very Society, will it be believed that even the quondam most-easily-scared pro moters of the former project were again among the very first to put their names down on the list of subscribers for its formation ! It was so, verily ! And now we were, in turn, to be dunned by them with an importunity that might have moved the bowels of an unjust judge, only to join for God's sake !\u2014 which, in their vernacular, meant the Duke's sake, of course. But we would not. They had misprised the elements of success, after all ; for many other bassos refused, along with us, to join : and when called upon at another meeting of choristers, to give our reasons for not supporting the said Society, then ; our answer simply was, that \" Duke Vernon would n't countenance it now.\" Hence the issue. They could not secure a complement of one of the most essential of their parts : and after lingering out a wretched existence, the laughing-stock and derision, at length, of the musical part of the com munity, and to the almost distraction of their trainer \u2014 not Mr Leggatt, after all, be it observed ! but Mr Rea, of Newcastle, one of the most talented conductors in all England, this grand, Duke-supported, parasiti cally-strangled Choral Union gave up the ghost ; literally expiring for want of breath ; its few good members being thoroughly disgusted, and but rarely attending. One word interrogative. Have we proved our position? And why should we be so ready to discredit those quaint old German legends which tell of men lusting for power and wealth selling themselves, \"for a consideration,\" to the devil ; to the accredited Incarnation of temporal glory and riches and power ; when we have men amongst us, in these days, sacrificing not their temporal independence and honour, only, but their very souls, at the shrine of a doting or capricious nobleman ? And how multitudinous are the re flections ; how awful are the spectra issuing from all this ; had we but time to analyse or pursue them ! Chief among them, perhaps, the amazing power which wealth can wield ; for, of course, if our Dukes were as poverty-stricken as were the Muscovian in Ivan's time, who could be hired by an English Merchant to groom his horse and black his boots, then the case would be materially altered, no doubt of it."], [41, "PROEM. XXXVII And we are far from being sure that many of these reflections would not be found in opposition to Mr Buckle, in his \"History of Civilization;\" when he gravely doubts the position of \"hereditary qualities.\" For, in such an atmosphere of bondage, as we have described, what more probable than that education and example, together, should so deeply taint the soul as to make the hereditament of a slavish vassalage, a degraded villany, as certain as is believed to be the transmission of the nature of a vicious' horse? We believe in transmitted idiocy, and in hereditary disease, multiform : and why not in hereditary poltroonery, still supplemented and developed as that is by an every-day, life-long surrender of will ? I' faith ! we think it as certain as is the physical, inevitable Hapsburg upper lip first derived from the Jagellon : and not half so problematical as the story of the Carolina dog, which transmitted its defect of a lost tail to its descendants of the fourth generation. We must put off, for the present, the consideration of our deeper ignominy, our lower degradation, as shown in our calmly permitting the very grave-stones to be removed from our tombs in the Church-yard, where they marked the resting-places of those dear to us ; and to see the same set up against the several walls of the church, with an inscription like the following graven along the bottom of them \u2014 \"The remains of the above named lie buried 26 feet, S.E. from this spot:\" or \"18 feet, N. from this ! \" And why so ? Just that My Lord of Northumberland might have a private carriage-drive, forsooth ! from his Castle to the Church, over the graves of the dead ! ! Slaves, that we are ! Though even this will not prove to be our most terrible illustration of what we have become reduced to. See Our History. We will only say here, then, that had such a shameless desecration been attempted with stone and grave of kindred of Ours ; at the risk of our life we would have dragged horses and chariot and all from that road, had twenty Knights of Garter been its load. \u25a0, C"], [42, "XXXVIII PROEM. And now, before we enter upon themes which may be considered of more general or common interest, permit us to defend the course we have taken, up to this point, from any presumed charge, that what we have just penned is of \"too local\" a character to be of much general interest. We cannot think so. The great Globe itself is but made up of atoms ; as all nations are of human units; while we feel quite sure our \"call\" will find its \"echo\" in a hundred communities ; some fainter, it may be, than that of others ; but that is all. Besides ; what would they imply by \"too local ? Take the fictions, only, of any of our Novelists ; especially of those whose object-paramount it is, in the guise of story, to pourtray the follies of an Age, the peculiarities of a Class, the lust of power, the battle of principle, the pride of \"caste,\" or the force of character; and are not the whole of these drawn out in persons and places that have no existence, in reality ? And yet we are content that they shall localize and impersonate as they shall see fit. Surely, a \"too local\" charge would have but bare standing ground, from such a view point as this. We speak from positive experi ence, of a condition of things from which the element of fiction is absolutely excluded ; and we expect, on these very grounds, to ensure all the greater interest. See if this be not so. But one argument, more, as a crowner. If the \"savour\" or intro duction of personal matters into our Work should chance to be remarked ; we would ask this one question \u2014 Why are matters of really no direct per sonal moment to any of us \u2014 to no one, indeed, save to them immediately concerned in them \u2014 daily reported with so much detail and at such great cost by the Public Press ; except that injustice and wrong doing, which would otherwise become rampant, may be exposed and held forth for the reprobation of society : not in the immediate sphere of their own action, only ; but wherever the history of the same may become known ? It is therefore, also, that the fullest information is given as to the successful opposition offered to such ; and to any penalties incurred or degradation suffered by the perpetrators. These again act as a caution and a deterrent to others, who, in their egregious selfishness, would otherwise not have hesitated to follow in the same track, to the hurt of the people, at large. We forget the social argument, too often, when we charge others with discussing, publicly, personal matters. Whereas, we ought to remember that a direct and intentional wrong done to an individual member of society, is in reality an attack upon the whole body ; for each one member may, in his turn, be the subject of the like injury. Hence, on that ground alone, a"], [43, "PROEM. XXXIX successful exposure and resistance of individual wrong is a matter of direct interest to Society in the aggregate. The constitution of our laws, in fact ; and the embodiment of judicial power, are a positive affirmation of this proposition. WE don't want to engage public attention at all ; and would not, except for such an obliga tion. In one sense, much rather would we that our case had been another's, if it had to be _\u2022 and that we should have had the counselling of the wronged, and the denunciation of the unscrupulous oppressors. Therefore, without further defence of our course, we simply announce, by way of advertisement, Our Pamphlet now preparing for publication, entitled \"At the Bar of Public Opinion.\" The publication of it, indeed, is inevitable. For, while the carrying out of that which has been a strong \"principle of action,\" all our life : viz. ; the determined and uncompromising resistance of wrong, has already sub jected us to heavy pecuniary loss ; to the threats first, the annoyances afterward, and subsequently to the expenses of an Extraordinary County Court action, \u2014 in which, however, we were completely successful\u2014 it is at this very time, in our maintenance of \"public rights,\" as against an aristo cratical Class invasion of them, about to involve us in a still more serious and costly Assize Trial. It must be so, however. All the Adin Balloons in the world will not convince us it is our duty to submit to be crushed, unresistingly ; stamped out, as it were, by the iron heel of tyranny, and that presumptive power which the possession of mere wealth too often has made triumphant, in like cases. After a score of fruitless efforts to keep clear of the Law, we shall test such power, yet once more, in Our Case. See Appendix, for advertisement of Pamphlet, above-named. By the sale of it, and this Work, we propose to raise arms and ammunition ; that is, \" Counsels' retaining fees, &c. &c,\" for the fight. With regard to the last stanzas in \" The Budget,\" we would simply say, in as many words, that we are not revolutionists. Far from it. So much as we have studied history, it has impressed us deeply with an abhorrence"], [44, "PROEM. XL of the evils of war, in every form : but much more so of those so fearfully enhanced in a Civil War, or Revolution. In truth we would, were it possible, abolish wars by all means: Or, compel them who make them, alone to fight them. Oh ! that horrible wholesale butchery ; the carnage and the horrors, the frightful scenes and wide-spread suffering and broken hearts that go to form the damnable record of a protracted internecine war ! And how intensified are all these when wrought by members of the same family \u2014 kindred in blood and nationality ? What an evidence of all this, have we not just had, in unhappy France ? We simply refer in those lines, then, to such an exigence as might arise out of an unrighteous, as foolish and useless, opposition to the determined will of a united people : when populations long-suffering, ground down and pauperised to keep up the fopperies of State, the pomp and circum stance of War ; to invest Automatons with power, or Class with prero gative ; will raise up a Nemesis such as the chisel of a Phidias never ren dered the outline of ; and which might eventuate in such a popular decree as \u2014 \"Usurpers of God's Earth.\" Our Country's history furnishes us with illustrations ; and might have supplied more, but for prudent and timely concessions to the resolution of an omnipotent people. Such was the policy resulting in those' detestable acts of tyranny which brought Charles I. to the scaffold ; made James II. a fugitive outcast ; and altered the succession to the throne. Such, as an obverse, was Catholic Emancipation ; the very necessity for which has left its stain upon our common humanity : when the enjoyment of civil rights was tyrannically made dependent upon conformity to a State creed.* Such was the Reform * Could Dr Croly really have been in earnest when he thought George IV. was taken suddenly from his loving (?) people because he had sanctioned the passing of the Emanci pation Bill? Verily, the Doctor paid no great compliment to Heaven, in whatever light it is taken. Loving people, truly 1 And what an unmitigated libel upon Eternal Justice 1 But in speaking of Catholic disabilities, it just occurs to us, what a wonderful principle, also, lay wrapt up in those legislative enactments which \"barred,\" for Ages, the pro-"], [45, "PROEM. XLI bill of 1S32 ; and again that of 1867. Such was the Corn Law Repeal Act ; and such was the crowning one of the Irish Church bill. We do indeed sincerely pray that the day may never dawn that shall hear our millions of poverty-stricken, if not poverty-doomed people \u2014 millions of free men in their death struggle for relief from grinding, oppressive, unnecessary taxation, pronounce that decree which, we have only said, under such circumstances might be sent forth. We say unnecessary taxation. For, are not \"legion\" the instances of the money of the tax-payer being squandered ? Ex. Gr. In the year 1 702 an Earl was changed into a Duke, and because his income wouldn't support the weight and glory of his additional top-knot, a pension of .\u00a35000 a year was bestowed upon him, and \u2014 mark this! \u2014 upon his heirs for ever ! That little job has cost the public ,\u00a3840,000, since. Earl Marlborough, at least, had done something to deserve a pension, himself; though the fruit of his loins, after him, might never do. Some of them, indeed, might one day have deserved hanging, for anything those generous givers-away of other people's money could have foreseen. Still, it was ruled they should have their _5ooo a year, for their hundreth-and-first Great Grandfather's sake, retro ! Or, what shall be said, again, of the following choice \"piece of roast\" off John Bull? \u2014 the following Parliamentary Jack S raid upon the pockets of the British tax-payer ? Viscount , who died some little time ago, when a mere youth was appointed to \"a perfect sinecure,\" we are told, by his grandpapa, Arch- fessors of Socinian or Unitarian doctrine from the grants and privileges accorded to other religious bodies ; although their loyalty no less than their good-citizenship was allowed to be unquestionable, while that of others, participant, was held to be doubtful. And a greater wonder, still, can we discern in those transcendental dogmas which could pro nounce men beyond the pale of salvation and communion with their God ; \u2014 poor, weak, simple-minded, soft-headed men, too, such as Drs Priestly, and Worcester, and Channing, for instance ! ! to say nothing of \"glorious\" John Milton,.\u2014 the very base or foundation of whose faith was a jealous regard for the indivisible Unity and unpartakable Honour and Glory of their God. Ay ! and who have braved alike the contumely of the World, the forfeitures of the State, and the anathemas and penalties of the Church, in their main tenance of it. Who would ever dream of placing a State religionist, or mere Mammon convert, upon the same pedestal with such men as these ?"], [46, "PROEM. XLII bish0p . The office, however, was soon abolished, as it justly deserved to be : when, lo ! a life compensation\u2014 for what?\u2014 was voted to him! Nay! we are told, as if such a \"stand and deliver!\" was not strong enough, although the said office was one of _3000 a year, only, the life compensation was made one of \u00a35000 per annum! So that for the after years of his existence, during which he never saved Britannia \"the turning of a hair\" for it, he would pocket about the nett sum of \u00a3200,000, sterling ; drawn from the very life-blood, the brain, and thews and sinews of the people ! Let the system here denounced, though, only be made general in its application, and we should see what barricados and obstructionists would cross its path, in a moment. Suppose that the pension bestower, himself, were compelled from circumstances to reduce his establishment. He must not discharge a groom of the chambers, an under butser, and a second coachman. Oh, no ! although he may have no further occasion for them, and cannot afford to employ them, he must still pension them for life! And that, although they were, every one of them, amply remunerated while in the discharge of their office ! How would that suit him ? And if not him ; why the people ? Before we take leave of this part of our subject, let us hear that most marvellous story told by Mr J. R. Planche, of the broad-shouldered, burden-bearing, good-natured John Bull of a generation or two back. The facts he vouches for. We tell them, therefore, nothing doubting. There was a baby born into the world. And his babyship being of the fruit of the loins of a friend of the cousin of the wife of a minister of the Crown, had to have a superfine godmother. And the minister's wife was the super. Of course, it is known all over the world that godmothers make gifts to their \"responsibilities :\" and whether such be in the form of bells and coral, or silver cup, or state sinecure, will depend. Well : Mr Planche tells us that the Crown-Minister's wife, on a certain occasion (the christening, that was), much regretted that Lord had nothing much worth, at his disposal, just at that time. AU the colonelcies of regiments were, it seems, silled up ; as were also the Commissionerships of Excise. Nor was the Mastership of the Mint, just then vacant. The only thing, then she feared, would be to have her little godson \" Six- Weeks\" entered on the pension list as a superannuated general postman !"], [47, "PROEM. XLIII The offer \u2014 doubtless on the proverbial grounds \u2014 \"better a half-loaf than no bread\" \u2014 was accepted : and, Mr P. vouches for that pension having been paid regularly for 80 years ! On the pensioner's Executor at last going to announce his death, and to receive the last payment just then due, he asked if they would require \"a certificate\" of the soi-disant postman's death ? The reply was a mazer. \" Oh no, Sir ! I can take your word for it. My father, I know, paid this pension as long as he lived ; and since his death /have paid it for 30 years. I am quite satisfied Mr must be dead by this time ! \" We do not know what Mr Planche's reflections upon this were. Our own were, at least, two : viz. ; that a life of 80 years, only, after super annuation, was a striking testimony to the wearing-down nature of Post Office duties ; and proves, conclusively, that the antediluvian patriarchs, at any rate, never could have been engaged in any such blood-for-money occupation. Only imagine, if we can, those immense sums of which we have spoken, added to thousands more such, invested for the relief of the unfortunate and the aged of our Countrymen when compelled at last to yield in the battle of life. And yet, with the knowledge of all this, we still dare to look with scornful pity upon the humble-minded, broken-hearted, legitimate pauper to whom adversity has made necessary the \"dole\" provided for him by law ; after having for well-nigh a life time paid largely to all rates for the support of the indigent, himself. But, such is our high standard of morality ; such our appraisement of social status ; and such our estimate of true honour. But though we may hope the day of martial revolution may never dawn, that one is probably not so far distant, when the tiers itat shall assert its right and power, and make felt its influence, alike in the finding and the disbursing of the \"ways and means\" of the kingdom. If instead of 1 So, 000 families being owners of considerable freeholds, over and above 17,000 aristocratic landowners, we now find one-half of England owned by some few hundred persons ! while in Scotland, alone, in the hands of"], [48, "xliv PROEM. 12 persons, there are no fewer than 19,000,500 acres ! we may not wonder so much, perhaps, at the bent and bias of our legislation during the past century, or century and a half. And we are now on the very verge of increased taxation. Not, we fear, of the skill and industry of the Country in legitimate proportion, as these ought to be ; but in unfair measure. We cannot understand, indeed, why lands which so far back as 1S00, only, yielded a rental of \u00a322,000,000, and paid upon that a tax of \u00a32,030,200, should in 1870, after they have risen in annual value to \u00a367,000,000 sterling, be paying a land tax of actually less than \u00a31,000,000 ! Rents three times as great as they were ; and tax not one-half what it formerly was ! One hundred and twenty years ago paying one-fifth of the taxation of the Country ; to-day about the one-seventieth part, only. Formerly charged largely, as land ought to be, with the \"defence\" of the Country : now, out of every 20s., raised by the government, paying about 5d., for that purpose ! Surely it needeth no diviner of divinations to tell either what are the causes thereof, or what the eventual, if not speedy remedy will be. With regard to the highest functionaries of the Anglican Church, neither is this the time and place to discuss fully the merits of such a scheme as that said to have been contemplated by the sagacious Henry VII., for avoiding the encumbrance of the nation with an expensive provision \u2014 drawn as such generally is from the very vitals of the people \u2014 for Royalty's younger sons, by training and fitting his second son to be an Archbishop : nor yet the correlative question \u2014 If archbishops and bishops there must be, with their \u00a310,000 and \u00a315,000 a year, as the recognised and legitimate servants of a Master who was so poor, \u2014 whether Seventh Harry's plan might not reasonably be entertained ? We will only say, here, that we can see no reason why it should not be. Surely, if such, in the event of their succession to the throne, would be deemed equal to sustain the Very Headship of the Church, as our Kings and Queens have been said to do, there is no reason moral, if none physical, which could be urged against their discharging some of its subordinate functions, under such head!"], [49, "PROEM. xlv With such an ample \"civil list\" allowance, at any rate, we have long thought it more than time that foreign princes should cease being made dependants on, and hanging like mill-stones about the necks of, the struggling millions of our poor countrymen, who are taxed to the very eyes for pensions and grants and allowances to them in whom they have so little part or interest. Great people, one would think, would have a spirit above genteel pauperism ; living at the cost and charge, and by the very necessities, of the poor.

We have now to glance at a question which must soon become one of the \"propositions\" of the Age : i.e., if the world is to see Christ's Kingdom come in any thing like the power we are taught to believe it will possess : viz. ; \u2014 Whether such positions (anomalies, we call them) as bishops in a State legislature, and priests upon a Bench of Magistrates, are at all likely to advance such kingdom ?\u2014 Whether their position is one whit less incon gruous than that of a woman's would be, so placed ; especially on the magisterial bench? where-upon, curiously enough we are told, once sat Countess Margaret of Richmond, as a Justice of the Peace! The simple question is \u2014 What have the ministers of God's word, the messengers of the Prince of Peace, the servants of Christ, the followers of the meek and lowly Jesus, the preachers of the \"new commandment\" of love, of self-denial, of charity, of suffering-for-His-sake, to do with the commerce of the World, the balances of Astr\u00e6a, the triumphs of Conquest, or the vials of War? \u2014 with the voting of subsidies for death and famine and disease to be let loose among the nations ? For, the general polity embraces all these, indirectly : and we cannot see, for the life of us, why they, above all men, should meddle and defile them selves with such matters. Surely, none of the latter, at any rate, can be considered the true ad ministration of the divine legacy \u2014 \" Feed My sheep.\" But more still : \u2014 What have the humbler of them, our parish priests who minister in holy things to the body of God's people to do, any more than a delicate-minded woman has, with the coarse and often indecent revelations of a Police Court ; which have been known to take the edge off a Justice Ralph Dodds, * and a whole armoury of lay magisterial blades, thoroughly ground and well-tempered though they be.

For, how often is not the delinquent shunned, and studiously avoided, by the priest-magistrate who has attainted and condemned him? We can scarcely see how it can be otherwise. How often have his prospects, his whole future life, been blasted by this false position ; even when the errant but repentant one was strong, or seeking for strength, in his resolutions of amendment ? Whereas, that clergyman's duty \u2014 true duty \u2014 unmistakeably was, after the offender had suffered the due penalty of his lapse from virtue, to have sought to restore him again to the communion of the Church ; to his mem bership in Christ's body ; ay ! and eventually to his forfeited place in the society of his fellow men. That would be the true cure of souls ; the binding up of the bruised ; the pouring in of the oil -and wine of good Samaritanship. And yet, how fre quently is not the very opposite of all this the case? We believe the monstrous evil to be, as it is now in practice, as unavoidable as it is damn able : and if there be not curses, there-upon, long and loud and deep, registered and to be answered for in the great balancing of accounts, we must credit other than the See of Rome with the plenitude of \"indulgence.\" And what of their Office ? Let any one make us answer. With what force, with what consistency, can the prayer \u2014 \"forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us \" \u2014 be offered up by a clergyman on a Sunday morning, who has on the Saturday, on the morning before only, as a magistrate visited with the severest penalties that the legislature allowed, some offence, it may be, which good men and true statesmen alike will sometimes doubt the righteousness of regarding as crime demanding such punishment ? We are not contending, as the law now is, that a poacher, for instance, violating it should not be punished. That is not the point. We want to know what a clergyman has to do with sitting in judgment upon him ?\u2014 even if such be in the possession of all his faculties ; which surely every administrator of justice ought to be; and yet, which we know, some are not. We could desire to know what such a clergyman's position would be ? What his feelings ? if he were called upon, in his duty as a clergyman, to give spiritual consolation to a sick wife, or a dying daughter, prostrated and perchance lacking the very sustenance needful for the natural life, in con-"], [52, "xlviii PROEM. sequence of the imprisonment of the husband, or bread-winner ?\u2014 by the very act of which he had made himself the instrument? We are waiving altogether the question of just punishment. That will find its solution, presently, in the tidal wave of Reform to come yet ; and compared with which that of Fundy's Bay, even, will be dwarfed into insignificance. We have only to ask, here :\u2014 Does that clergyman believe his spiritual ministrations would, in the case presented, be as acceptable, as effectual, so consolatory, nay ! so consistent as they would otherwise have been ? Let every honest heart answer as before God. And what a fearful commentary is the whole thing on the professed belief that One human soul is of more account than the material dross of a whole World. Do these men believe what they preach ? We may be wrong. But this has long been our con viction, that such a state of things must prove one of the greatest of hindrances to the advancement of religion, that we can possibly imagine. We should have more hope of an atheistic generation, almost, than of one so darkly-blinded and living on in the avowed approval of such. And oh ! in vivid contrast to such reflections as these, how does one's heart warm ; how does one's very soul go out toward the earnest, loving, faithful pastor of a people, who, in danger and in sickness, or \" any other adversity,\" takes his place by the couch of suffering, and wrestles with his God in prayer for the soul's weal of One, at once assailed by the shrinkings of mortality, and the doubts and terrors of the Invisible. And when the agony of a wounded spirit, the intensity of mental suffering over that of mere physical pain is considered, it is difficult to award him his meet desert. Who indeed is worthy of our love and regard and veneration, if not he ? The subject of the making of bishops ; the political exigences which so much affect the \"Apostolic Succession;\" and their under-thumb position with respect to the State ; we must of necessity leave over for consideration in a future publication. There is neither time, nor space for it here. We may just remark that the estimation in which their Office \u2014 or rather their title to, and the inviolableness of, their Office \u2014 was held even by a jjrotestant Queen Elizabeth, will be seen from one of our \"Extracts:\""], [53, "PROEM. xlix while the history of how Lady Yarmouth, the favourite of one of England's religious and gracious Georges, affected the true apostolic succession is too well known : viz. ; by betting a certain clergyman \u00a35000 that he would be made a bishop : he of course becoming one, and paying her the wager ! A fine succession that, truly ! as every candid mind must admit. And will any one endeavour to convince us that the mere \"laying on of hands\" was any adequate counterpoise to such an iniquity as this ? Upon such facts as these, the political element and the temporal power, rests our opposition to the present constitution of the Church. Regarding the occasional use of God's holy Name, we have only to say in reply to some of our true friends, that, whatever appearances may seem to indicate, we do use it with heart-felt reverence ; and, we believe, in the interests of truth and justice. Our reverence for His holy Word is no less. That is, when we can feel assured that that which is represented as the in terpretation of His Word, is truly so ; but which we fail to do, always, and cannot do in the admittedly wrong and dubious formul\u00e6 which are so frequently pointed out to us, both in the sermons of our best Churchmen, and in the writings of our highest ecclesiastical authorities, themselves. In this, we take courage and are thankful that we are not hypocrite enough to affect to believe, with a blind adhesion to custom and olden time creeds and traditions, what in our heart and judgment, and by our faith in the inflexible and impartial justice of the Supreme Being, we feel disposed to doubt. Are we not frequently assured by those to whom we have just made refer ence, that our Holy Books much want revision : good divines and able senators alike declaring such necessity, and asserting their right and power to make the change? And who that has studied Bibliology, at all, and the history of \" translations,\" can have any doubt of this necessity ? And why should it not be done at once ?*\u2014 instead of the ever-recurring, unseemly, faith-submining course now pursued in our pulpits, of explaining away, or giving an interpretation so widely different from the sense commonly under stood, as to be well-nigh the very opposite. * This was written long before the present-time \" revision\" had been resolved upon."], [54, "L PROEM. Hear what a writer in the Spectator says on this important subject : \u2014 \" We suspect that what Lord S is really afraid of, is the commercial loss involved in the partial superannuation of so many Bibles, with which some folks would begin to be dissatisfied. It would be very inconvenient perhaps to have amendments moved in the Bible Society proposing that in future they should order the newly-revised version ; the cost of which per Bible might be somewhat increased. These are the substantial considerations, we imagine, which induce the Earl of S to apologize for error, and for an amount of obscurity which makes one-tenth part of the Bible, at least, a mere riddle to ordinary people. A great capital has been sunk in Bibles : the capitalists must be consulted before reverence to the Divine Speaker can be attended to. HIS meaning is nothing like so important as the convenience of the Society got up to publish His meaning. What though most of the minor prophets and much of the greater pro phets in the present translation be mere enigma ? The production of fifty million copies of such enigma creates a vested interest which makes it a grave question whether you can supersede them in spite of any claims of divine right. Our Evangelists worship an idol called Authorized Version, which claims indeed to represent God ; but which has so many independent interests of its own, that even where it is proved to misrepresent or obscure Him, it is strongly supported against any proposal to perfect it further. \" Without endorsing all that is here said, we still cannot but recognize in this, the feeling which every candid reflecting mind must have, that a re vision is loudly called for, in behalf of those who lack both the education and the time needful to trace through the obscurities in which much of our religious reading is involved. How often has not the good divine, the true Christian preacher, himself, been told that his teachings cannot be justified, because the Hebraic scholar, the reader \"in the original,\" has otherwise determined? And having held those views so long, how much did it rejoice us, only a few weeks ago, to have our conscientious opinions justified by the dignified sentiments \u2014 fearless as dignified \u2014 of Dr Henry Alford, the Dean of Canter bury ; one of the greatest bulwarks of the Church. We will quote him, presently. {Vide \"Good Words;\" January, 1870.)"], [55, "PROEM. LI And how much more our occasion for rejoicing, that in the face of moral pressure of no light degree, if not \"high-pressure,\" we had resolutely again and again refused to petition against such revision, as well as against the discarnation of the Established Church. Anent Canterbury's Dean : If ever there has been a true, broad, Chris tian spirit in the World since the days of St Paul, we believe such spirit surely animates the Very Reverend Dr Alford. And what is his testimony, in opposition to the narrow minds if not meagre intellects of some of our tremulant, though imperious divines? And how does he dispose of that pseudo, because entire and blind, reliance upon the early Fathers and tra ditions of the Church, which has so long proved a bugbear to it? \" Surely,\" his Reverence says, \" it is not an attitude befitting one ready to be taught of God, to be timidly shrinking from the possible results of scientific inquiry ; and evermore crying out that the Scriptures are in danger. Who believes the Bible less, because ' Sun, stand thou still :' cannot be literally understood ? Do we think that we have so completely mastered the sense of Scripture, we who know it only at a distance of nearly a score of centuries, and in a language different from its original one, that we have nothing more to learn about its interpretation? Do we suppose that the Holy Spirit who taught mankind of Old, is teaching them nothing now ? Because both of these presumptions seem to be involved in what some of our teachers are now telling us. \" And again he says : \u2014 \"Truth can take care of itself without me. Science properly so called, and Scripture properly understood, are perfectly safe to gether. You cannot crush out truth \u2014 you cannot forbid research. These will go on as earnestly and as fruitfully as they do now : and if you pro claim them, what they do not proclaim themselves, hostile to Christianity ; if you make an enemy of that which ought to be one of your chief friends, you will find the advance of scientific discovery too strong for a merely artificial and conventional religion.\" Once more : \u2014 \" Every Christian Englishman values the Version put forth two hundred and sixty-eight years ago, as he values few other things ; is jealous of having it touched ; has its phrases familiar as household words. Yet every scholar who regards truth rather than popularity is constrained to confess that this Version, excellent as it is, does not now within many"], [56, "LII PROEM. degrees represent what we know of the text and the meaning of Holy Scrip ture. And if we are conscious that we are reading in our churches, and are sending forth to our people, an inaccurate representation of the Revelation of God to man, then it is our bounden duty to correct that inaccuracy, let the results be great or small.\" And what a startling testimony does this honest Churchman bear to the weak faith and ignoble fears of some, who from their very office ought ever to be the vanguard of the Truth ! \"Twenty-seven years ago,\" he adds, \"when I first conceived the idea of editing the Greek text of the New Testament, I received from a dear and valued friend a piece of advice which I cannot forget. It was this : \u2014 ' Do not point out difficulties ; pass them over and ignore them ; it is not the time to be directing attention to them. ' My answer was, I can consent to no such procedure. As every difficulty arises, I will state nothing but the plain truth : for I am persuaded that the cause of Christ never has been and never can be served by any concealment or warping of truth, nor by any equivocation or reservation whatsoever.\" Noble Dean ! Let all men honour thee for thy brave heart and excellent Christianity. What an anti-Jesuitical profession of faith was this last ! And what a Church we should have were all imbued with thy spirit ; which dares, even now, in an Age when one section of it affects to claim such a superiority, alike in doctrine and in formularies, to utter such an ungar nished truth as the following \u2014 \"I have absolutely no right to judge my neighbour in the matter of doctrine. I regard some point as essential : as lying at the very root of my Christianity. I cannot modify my conviction. But my neighbour thinks different. He thinks that my cherished tenet de stroys Christianity altogether. Now, I could not be as he is : to me it would be death to faith and hope. And he could not be as I am, fora like reason. I have then no right to require of a member of any other religious body that he should conform to a particular mode of fulfilling our Lord's com mand, or should view it as I do. What the Lord ordained, that binds every Christian man, and nothing else : and we have the same power of in terpreting His words now, as those had who immediately followed the Apostolic times. Therefore, though we may not approve of the interpre tation of a fellow Christian, if he call Christ Lord and be found in His ways, we have no right to unchurch and depreciate him, even though he hold not the command as pointing to any ordinance at all.\" Grand Apostle ! we repeat, i Let all men honour thee."], [57, "PROEM. LIII Regarding our few extract lines on Creation, &c, we must refer those who may differ from us \u2014 can there be many such, now-a-days? \u2014 to the Very Reverend Dean Alford, on \" Conscience;\" and to that noble Chris tian Professor, Dr Hitchcock, on \" Revelation illustrated by Science.\" We have no hesitation in affirming this \u2014 that we believe the WORKS of God to be a revelation of Himself : at once of His Wisdom, Power, and Goodness. And when He speaks to us clearly in these, demanding the acquiescence of that reason and judgment which He has given us for the very purpose of assenting to, and lauding Him in them ; then, we are bold to assert that were an Angel to appear to us with a revelation of words, direct, much less with an interpretation of the same, only, and mystified by the lapse of Ages, or marred by the infirmities of weak and fallible men ; and, in a literal sense, absolutely inconcordant with His Natural Revelation ; then, we must unhesitatingly accept the evidence of HIS WORKS. These are the grand revelation of the Deity, we believe ; though with out one thought, at the same time, of either denying or disregarding the revelation of HIS WILL. Certainly, it is true, as Wesley wrote in his beautiful hymn, that \" God moves in a mysterious way, His wonders to perform : \" Yet cannot we be too careful not to wrest either tradition or ancient records to suit our own early-instilled, preconceived, or it may be altogether-crude ideas of Heaven's plans and purposes. As one of our living Savants puts it : \u2014 \"When probable solutions, consistent with the ordinary course of nature, can be found, we must not invoke an abnormal act of Creative Power.\" This postulate applied to the subject of Creation, and the seven-leagued strides which Science has taken for the last 300 years, together, ought to draw the very last fang from the Cobra jaw of dogmatism. Our unwavering faith is, that science and revelation never have run, and never can run, counter to each other. Man's knowledge of the one may be imperfect, or his interpretation of the other, wrong ; as indeed both philosophers and theologians have so often proved by their differences : but that must be charged to the account of finite apprehension. d"], [58, "liv PROEM. They are doubtless all-while in perfect harmony, as truth must ever be with truth : and our own feeble limited powers alone they are, which seem to make them jarring and out of tune. Be this ever our Prayer \u2014 O Thou, who art of Nature God, Ev'n as Thou art of Grace, In both, Thy wisdom, power, and love, Give us Thine aid to trace. Sir Thomas Browne very beautifully observes \u2014 \" There are two books from whence I collect my divinity. Besides that written one of God, an other of his servant Nature ; that universal and public manuscript that lies expanded unto the eyes of all. Those who never saw HIM in the one have discovered HIM in the other.\" That the term \"weakling ones\" used in discussing one \"article of faith,\" and to those who endorse that view of it which we cannot but think far from right, is too strong a one, we cannot see. We believe in the rite of baptism ; that it is an obligation imposed and binding upon us. But we do not believe in its being essential to salvation in the case of infants. Some do hold and preach this. It is of no use their trying to qualify or lessen the harshness of their doctrine, by explaining away ; by refined sub tleties ; or by an ambiguity of words. It is as logical an inference as any Whewell, or Whately, or other inductive science philosopher among them could draw from their words \u2014 \" that a child born into the world, and under-going the rite of baptism, is thereby freed from that taint of original sin which made it obnoxious to divine justice ; \" \u2014 that the converse pro position cannot be other than this \u2014 \" that the child dying, without such rite being performed, must be obnoxious still.\" And we all know what that means. They must accept the alternative, however ; or have a prick from this horn of the dilemma : \u2014 If they do not so declare the child to have died in a state of obnoxiousness, the consequence of original sin, then, there must have been some other means of purification ; some other medium of reconcile ment to God. But, if so, then infant baptism can not be essential to salvation."], [59, "PROEM. Iv We believe in the rite, nevertheless, as necessary for every member of the Christian Church ; though not in this essentiality. \" The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all sin ; \" and, of course, original included. The other is in our eyes one of the most horrible doctrines that can be propagated ; making a righteous God to be less just, not to say less merciful, than the poor, weak, finite creature whom He has made ! \u2014 making Him, indeed, a very Moloch in relation to our poor little harmless ones. When we use the epithet \"weakling ones,\" therefore, to those professing such a creed, it is surely the less to be objected to ; for, if we credited them with full powers of mind, we must have substituted some term less palatable still, we fear. We simply believe, then, God to be dishonoured by such a scheme of religion \u2014 a system of award and punishment that man holds to be iniquitous in man ; and which would be a disgrace to any Judicial Court upon Earth. And we hope to die in the full assurance of those attributes with which we think it to be absolutely incompatible. Vide Extract from Telescopic Musings. What a stain is it not upon the Clerical profession ! What a \"blot\" in the Churchman's gammon ! What a caricature of the loving large-hearted ness and all-embracing charity of the Founder of their faith ! is the refusal of a minister to give Christian burial to a poor helpless unoffending babe, because over it the waters of the font had not been poured : leaving it to be huddled out of sight as they would have buried some hound or terrier bitch's pup. We could devoutly wish to God, that His Grace of Canterbury were only as sure of Heaven. It is no justification to plead that the Church or the Rubric ordains they shall so act. They ought at once, then, to move for such Church's reform. And so long as they do not this, they are answerable for it, as for their own act and deed. We have our doubts \u2014 grave doubts \u2014 as to the righteousness of refusing Christian burial to the poor broken-hearted suicide, even. They assume a mighty deal, in doing so. For, if the one last mortal act of a man's life, simply because that is of the nature of a grievous sin \u2014 the sin of a poor victim, it may be, of some scoundrel Fitz-Osborne or Grantmesnil who had"], [60, "Ivi PROEM. wrecked his home and happiness, or ever he had drained the life-destroying cup ; yet whose own vile Norman clay shall in due time be laid [with bowed and bared head and holy service resonant over the real murderer] in conse crated ground ! far from the breast-staked victim of his outrage : \u2014 We say, if the one last act of a man's life, because it is grievously sinful, be sufficient to shut him out from the offices of the Church ; then, surely, almost the very last act of the bishop of M , who, it is said, refused to forgive his own daughter ; and that of thousands more who have died in a spirit pro scribed by the Church, and antagonistic to the divine code, should be ac counted equally worthy of the former's reprobation, and the penalties she imposes. No prayers over the suicide, indeed ! A wayward sinful brother, we confess ; Yet still a brother, not one whit the less. Why ! just imagine, by the way, My Lord Bishop and some wretched felo-de-se on their way to Hade's, together. And what a reproof to such a Church, for the poor crazed suicide to be accepted on that all-prevailing intercession, still being offered up \u2014 \" Father, forgive him, for he knows not what he does :\" \u2014 and on the ear of Eccle siastes, himself, echoing through the eternal vaults, falling those terrible words \u2014 \" I forgave thee all thy debt, because thou desiredst me : Shouldest not thou also have had compassion?\" What of Christian burial, and all its pomp-diluted solemnities, in such a case? And who wouldn't elect, after all, to be the former with his dull, dismembered, interdicted clay cast headlong into the abhorred depths of Hinnom, itself; rather than the latter, though his embalmed dust should mingle with that of the sacred Valley of Jehoshaphat ? \u2014 Or, in the words of the illustrious Lamartine \u2014 \"lie where the olive and the orange trees cover with a deeper shadow the narrow valley of Gethsemane, which delves like a sanctuary into its darkest depths ? \" Yet, in all this can we not see sufficient ground for leaving the Com munion of our Church ; but feel it our bounden duty to remain therein ; in the full hope and trust that the time is not afar off when these and many"], [61, "PROEM. lvii other blots shall have ceased to exist : when, consequent on their decease, there shall be such an ingathering to her bosom as will make the countless sects, now split again and again by the love of sway, and the unworthy pleas of this and that form of government, wonder at their persistent pre lation of unmeaning \"independence\" (!) of each other, over that bond of Union which ought to be the Cardinal aim of every Christian people. But alas ! for the unity of the Church, at present. Why, even in our own, what have we not seen resulting from petty divisions and jealousies which so mar its beauty and frustrate its purposes. Is it not a fact, and one which seems to mock, open-mouthed, at the professed homogeneity of Christianity, that even in one town, divided into district parishes, we could have such an awful illustration of this as the following? \u2014 that an aged person, in articulo mortis, at the point of death, should have had her requisition for One clergyman's attendance refused, on the ground of her residence in the Other's district, and from the fear of giving the latter offence ! while the clergyman of the district, proper, also declined attending the sufferer, because she \u2014 vile unconscionable wretch ! for doing such a monstrous thing ! ! \u2014 during her life and health had persisted in still attend ing the Old or Mother Church ; which she had, in fact, attended all her days. And so it fell out, that the poor disconsolate dying one had to receive at the last the ghostly consolations of a dissenting minister ! Is it but a dream, then, that parable of \"the Son of Man coming ; and all His holy angels with Him !\" and the withering judgment of the King \u2014 \"Inasmuch as ye did it not unto the least of these, &c\"? And what a beautiful exordium is such to that of the Good Samaritan ! What a sparkling illustration of the beauty of Unity does not such a fact exhibit ! What General, we wonder, ever would or could hope for a successful campaign, against a powerful and strategic foe, with forces which he could never unite and concentrate for action under any circumstances ? Away with all divisional Churches, Roman Catholic, Church of Eng land, Presbyterian, Independent, Old Methodist and New, and the scores of others that tell of schisms and heart-burnings and jealousies.

He says \u2014 \"It is a charge 'of want of unity,' in fact, which I have to make against the Christianity of the day. I venture to say there has been immense confusion in understanding this term, Unity. As long as any outward uniformity is retained as its condition, it is misunderstood. We have made some advance\u2014 for we do not any longer require of men that they should conform to one ritual in order to qualify for serving the State ; \u2014 but we have much more to make ; for we have not ceased to assert the universal obligation of one ritual ; we have not ceased to look with dis favour on those who refuse to conform to it.\" He then adds\u2014 \"More and more symptoms are every year coming to the surface, that a time is pre paring, when the many Christian bodies of England will consciously constitute one Church : not by growing uniformity, but by the bringing out of their essential unity in the midst of manifold variety.\" * With regard to our aristocratic places of worship, and the classification of rich and poor in the House of God, is it possible that the strictures in our \"Extract from Telescopic Musings\" need any defence? We fancy not. What says St James? \u2014 \"If there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment ; And ye have respect unto him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou there in a good place ; and to the poor man, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool : Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts ? \" And what further says he to such? \u2014 \"My brethren have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, with respect of persons. \" Judge, then, whether in the short \"extract\" from our Telescopic Musings on the subject, we have said one word opposed to truth ; but the very reverse : whether our several grades of society, in despite if not in defiance of God's assurance that HE is no respecter of persons, but that all are equal in HIS sight, are not yet classified with a nicety and a discrimination that would put the great Linn\u00e6us, himself, to the blush.

We spoke of the dependants of Our Noblemen, at one time, bending the knee in homage to their Lord and Lady in God's own House and Presence, as they passed them to their seats. But it is said, that once upon a time a Royal Duchess attended service, there ; when the whole congregation, nearly, after having on bended knee entered into communion with their God, upon the Duchess's later entrance actually rose up en masse, and shook their dimity skirts and elongated swallow-tails in humble recognition of the royal furbelows ! and did not sit down again, though, until she first had taken her seat ! And thus, between Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and Her, dividing the praise and glory and laud and honour. We shudder at the practical idolatry of that act. And why wonder we, that one-time, 2500 years by-gone, upon Dura's plain in the province of Babylon, men should have paid worship, not to a god of dull clay, but to an image of gold ! a god auriferous and of towering majesty ; threescore cubits high ! \u2014 what wonder was it, with their very souls melted within them at the mingling sounds of comet and flute, of harp and sackbut, and psaltery and all kinds of music ; and with the ordeal or death by fiery portation of our grandees thence to their homes. It used to be a matter of some wonder to us, why the homilies of the Church should have possessed no vital interest for men in plush breeches and three-cornered cocked hats. * We have been informed that the present Duchess of Northumberland has interdicted any recognition of her upon her entrance to Church.

All honour, howbeit, let us accord to one of our noble-hearted authorities, who, we are informed, most decidedly refused to request his servants to keep their seats in Church, until first the Lord of the Manor had got him out of doors ! Inconceivable arrogance, on the one hand : manly unosten tatious maintenance of right, on the other. Is it not written\u2014\" Honoured shall they be who bow not down to Rimmon\" ? But, we find some of our gentry not only asserting all their rights of social precedence and position, in God's House ; not only refusing a poorer brother a seat in the same pew with them \u2014 as though one dish of crockery in the same closet with a service of Sevres were sufficient to crack the reputation of the whole set ; \u2014 not only refusing him a seat in the same pew with them, but actually compelling him to come out ! when by chance one does get there ; and marching him off, poor soul ! to find his \"communion with the saints\" elsewhere. Others, again, we have known to go and pray alone, by the stony saints at foot of bell-tower stair, rather than hold pew-fellowship with any one having a taglet less to their golden hoop than they, themselves. We pass by, for the present, all notice of preference of \"Order,\" in some of the ordinances, at some places ; and the absolute change of service to suit \"lay\" taste, of high rank, at others. If, after duly considering what we have written, our strictures seem to any one unnecessary, then we can only tell such, that we consider we have but touched the superficies, as yet, of that immense stratum of cursed pride which we see ever and again uphoven as a Baal for worship, in the very temple of God, Himself ; and which taints our chiefest service as with a moral leprosy.

R T C , of Alnwick ; DIED JANUARY I 7, 1870 : IN HIS TWENTY-FOURTH YEAR. Written from the Testimony of his Companions in Life. That \"they whom the gods love die young\" is a trite saying, and one with too much truth in it, to our mind, we are often tempted to think : Whilst it is far from being a matter of wonder that one just verging on the estate of manhood, and the possessor of an equable, gentle, retiring, yet kindly disposition, should, in the too evidently-near presence of death, become the almost-idol o{ a loving, sorrowing, home circle. Nay ! it is scarcely exaggeration to say that the very bitterness of death, must have overflowed their own cup, whose lot, in a mysterious Providence, it has been to part with such. The converse of this, indeed, would be the wonder. And when we find, over and above all, even amongst his companions in the chequered and often traverse paths of youth ; among his very rivals in the affec tions of the heart ; that such a one had not only his friendship reciprocated, but returned to him with a hundredfold of interest ; then may we feel assured that such a friendship was a jewel to be worn with pride by all who were so fortunate as to possess it.

Oh ! what a change one brief, sad hour should bring In this, her first awakening to her loss ! The spirit, like a bow too long tight strung, Loses its elasticity, or breaks.

The splendid inventions and endless applications of the present age would obtain for it merely the praise of ingenuity ; but the simultaneous diffusion with these of a taste for poetry, music, and art, stamps the epoch as a period of indubitable progress. Civilization does not, altogether, consist in the perfectionnement of the mechanical arts of life. The analysis of so ethereal a thing as beauty is not impossible ; and it, in all probability, depends upon laws as simple as those of light itself. It is no longer now committed wholly to the researches of the metaphysician. Ideal beauty, a higher branch of the subject, whenever met with in high art, used to be set down as the result of special inspiration. It is now pretty generally acknowledged to be a real existence. The taste for beauty in the human form grows by what it feeds on. Women have contended publicly for the prize of beauty ; and the Spartan matrons placed in their sleeping-rooms the images of the most graceful deities. Sculpture was early made a means of perpetuating the memory of charms men almost worshipped ; and statues became the universal expression of admiration. The feeling of ideal beauty is not an instinct. It comes by study, by medita tion, by abstraction from low desires. And it must come with the power to separate it from the association of a passion with which it has no necessary con nection \u2014 the passion of love. The educated and enlightened African may com prehend this beauty ; but he will not love the less fondly his dusky wife, and the dark imps she has given him. The Greeks revelled in beauty with a kind of intoxication ; and in the images of their gods gave us creations of ideal beauty. Let us hear the description of a German enthusiast of one of their ideals: \u2014 \"I could wish in this place,\" he says, \" to describe beauty the like of which can hardly have had human origin. It is a winged genius in the Villa Borghese, of the size of a well-made youth. If the imagination, filled with the single beauties everywhere displayed in nature, and occupied in the contemplation of that beauty which flows from God, and leads to God, were to shape during sleep a vision of an angel, whose countenance was brightened by the divine effulgence, and whose form was seemingly an effluence"], [115, "THOUGHTS OF LEISURE HOURS. 47 from the source of the highest harmony \u2014 in such a form let the reader set before himself this lovely image. It might be said that nature, with God's approval, had fashioned it after the beauty of the angels.\" Ideal beauty is, after all, simply the highest beauty in nature ; and although it may be comprehended intuitively by genius, we must approach it in ordinary cir cumstances through the cultivation of taste. In making this approach, we rise in general refinement and enlightenment ; for nothing mean or base may draw near that divine presence. Governments would do well to understand this. They would do well to familiarize the million with the works in which beauty resides.

Machiavelli, an Italian famous as a politician, lived in the latter part of the 15th century. He was a poet, also. In the Republic of Florence he held posts of considerable importance ; and was at one time Secretary of State. He died poor, in 1527. The world seems divided in opinion as to the character and purpose of many of his writings. In his treatise \u2014 \"The Prince\" \u2014 some have maintained that his object was an exposure of the arts of tyrannical governors : and a cave to wicked rulers. Others, that he was the apologist of arbitrary power ; and that he sought by a crooked policy to undermine every better prin ciple. Who may now say, whether his maxims were the very refinement of satire, or were propounded by him as the complement of his own convictions ? At any rate, he has given us a title for a subject. If aright we have read, The Prince Talleyrand said Language wasn't bestowed to reveal A man's innermost mind : But, instead, as a blind, All the better his thoughts to conceal.

Why, one might as reasonably bring a Salamander to a state of incandescence, or white heat, and expect him to feel cool to the touch, as hope to blot out, effectually, impressions of persons, places, and things from the tablet of the memory. We say memory, advisedly, and in contradistinction to the commonly adopted expression\u2014\" the tablet of the brain.\" We believe devoutly in this thesis ; that, though more generally or fully exercised by the capital organs and senses, memory is not peculiar to mind, alone ; any more than that mind has for its exclusive organ the brain proper. In fact, it has been demonstrated in the lower animals, to whom no one will deny the powers of memory, that the reflex acts of the spinal cord, independently of the brain, will display aim, consciousness, and volition : and hence it has been concluded, that the whole body becomes a \"registry\" of acts, feelings, and impressions, done, received by, or made upon it. What says a celebrated physiologist on the subject ? \" There are certain actions, movements, manifestations, which it is difficult to class : whether they are mental or physical. For, if they are mental, we must greatly enlarge our conception of mind ; and of its seat. If they are physical, then we must sub tract from mind functions which have hitherto been held as essential to its full functions.\" What we usually hear spoken of, as \" impressions,\" has been set down as the physiological condition of ideas : and the registration of these is memory. We are told that in every nerve-cell of the body there is memory. Nay, that it is probably in every organic element of the body. That memory, in short, is simply an organic registration of effects or impressions ; the organization of ex perience ; and comparatively, if not absolutely, independent of the will. Hence, even up to the hour of death, until disorganization results, these are never actually forgotten ; but will endure while life lasts. We maybe powerless to recall them, at will, even ; but no waves of oblivion will be able utterly to efface their character. An accident, a momentary flash will reproduce them vividly, when they would seem to have evanished for ever. Oh ! beneficent, cruel, hateful, loving, devil, angel, Memory ! Who may sound thy bottomless pit of horrors !

(Written in 1837.) In the stillness of night as I strolled by the Aln, Where its banks by the clear crystal waters are laved, The moon's silver beams lit the old Gothic towers, Where the flag of the Percy for ages had waved. Tho' assailed by the armies of Scotland's bold kings, With the cap-d-pie'd warriors of Douglas combined; Northumbrian proud bulwark their efforts defied, While its walls by the vassals of Percy were lined. And when the stern Monarch had summoned its lord, By the voice of a herald ; this was his reply \u2014 His banners he nailed to the flag-staff; and swore By the heav'ns frowning o'er him, to conquer or die. Thus, silent, I mused as the sweet Queen of Night O'er the face of the waters emitted her beams : Where the sere yellow leaves and the turrets did blend In one, on the face of my bright native stream."], [338, "THOUGHTS OF LEISURE HOURS. 270 LOVE'S APPEAL : AN IMPROMPTU.

Ye smiling dales, and cowslip-covered hills ; Bright-bosom'd streams, and softly-murmuring rills ; In storied song renowned.
