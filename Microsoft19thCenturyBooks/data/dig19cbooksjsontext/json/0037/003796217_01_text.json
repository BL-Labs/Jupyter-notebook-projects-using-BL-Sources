PEr haps you Gentlemen, expett to day The Author of this Fag-end of a Play, According to the Modern way of Wit, Shou'd (frive to he before-hand with the Pit ; Begin to rail at you, and fuhtiy to Prevent th' affront by giving the firjl blow. He wants not Prefidents, which often fway In matters far more weighty than a Play .* Bat he no grave admirer of a Rule, Won't by Example learn to play the fool. The end of Plays fhould be to entertain, And not to keep the Auditors in pain. Giving our price, and for what trafh we pleafe, He thinks the Play being done, you fhould have eafe. No Wit, no Sence, no Freedom, and a Box, Is much like paying Monyfor the Stocks. Befides the Author dreads the ft rut and mien Of new prais'd Poets, having often seen Some of his Fellows, who have writ before , When Nel^bas danc'dher Jig, steal to the Door, Hear the Pit clap, and with conceit of that Swell, and believe thews fives the Lord knows what. Most Writers now adays are grown so vain, That once approvd, they write, and write again Till they have writ away the Fame they got j Our Friend this way of writing fanfies not, And hopes you will not tempt him with your Praise, To rank himself with some that write new Plays : For he knows ways enough to be undone Without the help of Poetry for one.
