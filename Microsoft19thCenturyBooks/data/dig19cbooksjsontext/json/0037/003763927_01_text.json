The second son of Watkyn Vaughan of Bredwardyne, County Hereford, he was in tended for Court life, his first-cousin, Rowland Vaughan of Porthamel (afterwards M.P. for Breconshire), being Groom of the Chambers to Queen Elizabeth, and his grand-aunt, Dame Blanche Parry, her great friend and chief Bedchamber-woman ; but, as he himself tells us, \" his spirit was too tender to endure the bitternesse \" of Dame Blanche's \" humor,\" and after some years spent in the greatness and glory of Court, he was \"forced\" by the same old relative's \" careful, though crabbed, authority \" into the Irish wars \u2014 probably"], [16, "INTRODUCTION those of Sir Henry Sidney against the O'Desmond. Here he spent three or four years ; but this time it was his body that was \"too tender,\" and the standing waist (or, to use his own expression, \"twist\") deep in the bogs, combined with fasting and ill diet, sent him home invalided to Bredwardine. That Bredwardine was a place of some pretensions, we learn from some seventeenth century manuscript notes for a History of Herefordshire. First in a list headed \"Where appeare any tokins of great old houses now done desolated \" we find \" Castells within the shire on the south side of Wye \u2014 the Castel of BredAvardine.\" Then in an account of the different parishes comes, \" Bredwardine had a faire castel called the Castel of Grone, and another at the place called the Court of Vaughans, called also the Radnor ; the first held by appearing at Brecknocke Castle gate on horseback completely armed with his speare, and there to wait all day on the day of . It is now honoured with a family of the Vaughans, of the second house, whose ancestors by a match with one of the co-heirs of the Parrys had by her great viii"], [17, "IX INTRODUCTION revenues.\" This alludes to the marriage of Rowland's father, Watkyn, with Joan Parry, daughter of Henry Parry of New Court. The manuscript goes on to state that in Bredwardine Church is an effigy of a knight in full armour, supposed to be \"by tradition, and that probable,\" John de Bredwardyne, knighted by William the Conqueror. Thus far goes the Harleian M.S. No. 6868. M.S. No. 6726, also Harleian, written in 1655, tells us a little more about BredAvardine. It states, \"The dwelling-house, very fairly built by Roger Vaughan about the year 1639 1640, was an ancient and strong castle, re taining that title still. It was called anciently the Castel of Grone ; the lands and tenements belonging to it is still called by the name of the Manor of Grone. Another Lordship in this parish, which is held by the suit and doome in the County Court, and belongs unto the Vaughans, is called the Court of Vaughans (belonging to another branch of Vaughans, viz., Sir George Vaughan), was sold to those Vaughans of Bredwardine about the year 1630. There is a small fortified hill, which was for the safeguard of the inhabitants against sudden invasion.\""], [18, "X INTRODUCTION In Rowland's day, then, the place was a \"faire castell.\" The rebuilding of 1640 was not till after his death, Roger being his nephew, son to his elder brother Henry Vaughan of Moccas ; but two years even in this \" great old house\" bored our hero to such an extent, that he would have gone off again to the wars, had not his fair kinswoman, Elizabeth Vaughan, intervened, and turned his thoughts towards matrimony. Elizabeth was daughter of the abovenamed Rowland of Porthamel and Elizabeth Parry of New Court, co-heiress with her sister Joan, who married Rowland's father, Watkyn of Bredwardine, of the New Court estates. The Parrys and Vaughans intermarried in each generation, and the cross-relationships are so puzzling, that I shall not attempt here to follow up the pedigree of either family, except to draw attention to the fact that they were both very proud of their kinship with David Gam, the hero of Agincourt, from whose daughter, \" Gladis de Gam,\" sprang the Vaughans by her first marriage with Sir Roger Vaughan, who was killed at Agincourt, and the Pembrokes by a second marriage with Sir William Herbert, father by her of the first"], [19, "XI INTRODUCTION Earl of Pembroke. The Vaughans and Pembrokes fought side by side in many a sight, and the dedication of Rowland's book to the then Earl show that the feeling of kinship had survived the wear and tear of nearly two hundred years. Rowland Vaughan of Porthamel and his wife, Elizabeth Parry, had two daughters (their son died unmarried in 1582), Eliza beth, who married our hero, and Katherine, who married Sir Robert Knollys, and so be came daughter-in-law to dear old Sir Francis Knollys, whose wife, Katherine Carey, was Queen Elizabeth's first-cousin. The fair and virtuous Elizabeth Vaughan was \" a loving wife,\" according to her hus band, but apparently one who would stand no nonsense. She soon put a stop to his roystering with old comrades, and bade him employ himself at home, by looking after her property, she \"being seized of a mannor and overshott mill.\" The manor was New Court. An apparent disagreeable with the miller made Rowland wish to get rid of his respon sibility, but madam overruled him, and he \"obeyed her will, as many doe, and many miseries do ensue thereby.\" And so, \"in the"], [20, "XII INTRODUCTION month of March,\" our Rowland (\"with no desire, I protest, to fashion or forme hus bandry \") was wandering by the mill-stream, possibly whistling as he went for want of thought, or thinking regretfully of those boon companions, only now allowed to memory, when his wandering eye fell upon a small stream, or, as he would call it, a \" waterprill\" issuing from a molehill, and from this small beginning came his mighty scheme of irri gation. His difficulties were great. His neighbour, Rowland Pariy of Moorhampton (whose son Stephen afterwards became our Rowland's son-in-law), readily gave him per mission to make the necessary uses of his side of the river; but one of his tenants (\"being very aged and simple\") made such a to-do, that, after Rowland had vainly tried what he calls \" bugg words,\" bribery had to be resorted to, with the result that the simple(?) rustic got a \" meadow-plott \" worth ,\u00a340, instead of the three acres of old meadow-land, heavily laden with moss, rush, and cowslip, which his landlord so much coveted. Of the money spent we can form no estimate. Over one piece of trenching (which, the neighbours said, would cost a thousand marks) Rowland"], [21, "XIII INTRODUCTION saved a \u00a3100 by his crafty way of setting to work. Elsewhere he mentions that a bad piece of work on the part of a vain-glorious carpenter cost him over But his book must have bitterly disappointed any one who tried to get real practical information on either of his subjects ; his wandering mind flies off anywhere, wholly irrelevant anec dotes are begun and never finished, and real statistics are the last things he would con descend to work out for us. Still, he states that his demesne at NeAV Court was let for a year, and \" is now worth ,\u00a3300 \" ; that one meadow, for which he got yearly, now yields \u00a3 1 5 in hay and aftermath alone ; that if at the end of four years' \" drownings \" your outlay of has not made itself or \"your choyce\" (of land) \" is bad, and luck worse.\" He offered a neighbour a year for a hundred acres of arable (that being its rental) on a four years' agreement, at the end of which time Row land was to haAre a twenty-one years' lease of it at ;\u00a3ioo a year, all cost of putting up sluices, &c, to be Rowland's; but on the entering of the twenty-one years' lease the neighbour was to put down ,\u00a3300, which,"], [22, "XIV INTRODUCTION as Rowland observes, he gets back in three years. Though the hundred acres was \" in the eye of his house,\" and must have been unsightly in its state of unculture, the neighbour re fused the offer. \" He offered nothing, and he hath done nothing,\" says Rowland, \" therefore this is but an accusation for negligence, setting it forth in as friendly a manner as I may.\" Further on we learn that three moles, suf fered to live by a servant's carelessness, cost him ,\u00a320 a year in damage to the \" stankes,\" and there is an amusing little homily on the sin of ingratitude to these little creatures, who were the originators of all the vast system of irrigation; but though they are offered the run of his pleasaunce, burrowing in the \" Stanke Royal \" is high treason, and the moles are doomed, in spite of qualms of conscience. Then, too, the saving of labour is slightly touched on, but these facts are scattered all about the book, and one can only guess that the cost must have been immense, though Rowland blames his neighbours for not fol loAving his example, in utter oblivion of the fact that they may not have had any capital to advance, as not to every one's share falls a"], [23, "XV INTRODUCTION wife seized of a \" mannor and a overshott mill.\" And here I must note that a mill in those days was apparently a very choice possession, for Rowland thus comments on their owners : \" The mill may be worth four or five pound ; but because he will win reputa tion to his demesnes on information on the marriage of his son that he hath such a mill, he would rather suffer muddy fiouds in winter and clean water in summer to breake their limbs in his mill-wheels then exercise his wits (by drowning) to attain a world of wealth.\" When or why Rowland first thought of the project which he calls his \"common-wealth\" does not appear, but it also must have been a gigantic work ; we gather it was begun after the completion of the water-works, as he says, \" I have built my mill, and acquainted the Avater with his course ; unto this mill I add all offices,\" &c, &c. This commonwealth was a sort of community of tradesmen, who supplied each other with their specialties before offering them in open market ; a clerk fixed the rate at which the tanners was to supply the glovers, and the carders the spin-"], [24, "INTRODUCTION ners, &c. ; and justice seems to have been meted out with a steady hand. Great order was kept in the commonwealth ; a first offence was reprimanded, a second punished, the third entailed banishment from the precincts. Rowland thus got a market for all his farm produce. He grew the sheep and kine which both fed and employed his glovers and weavers, the tanners got their bark from his forests, and he seems to have personally superin tended everything. A great number of the operatives were housed on the premises ; and we read of their washing-places, their eating hall, their hospital \u2014 indeed, of every conveni ence that human ingenuity of those days could dream of. Two thousand \" mechanicalls \" had joined Rowland's community by the time of his writ ing his book (1604), which was in those days a very much larger number proportionately to the population than it is now, especially in that remote corner of England or Wales, as RoAvland repeatedly calls Herefordshire These tAvo thousand workmen daily assem bled to food in the big hall at sound of trumpet ; but bodily food was not the only thing supplied for them by their energetic xvi"], [25, "INTRODUCTION \"protector,\" He built them a chapel, attended by both preacher and curate, who got respec tively \u00a350 and ,\u00a320 yearly \u2014 good stipends for those days \u2014 and almshouses for the sick and old. The priests must have been a great boon outside the commonwealth, for in all the Golden Valley, \" which is seven miles long and one broad,\" there was not one parish which could afford to maintain a priest, and a young \"preacher\" used to come over from Hereford every now and then, and preach so many sermons at so much a piece, charging very high, RoAvland hints, on account of the fancied perils of the journey ! Other ministrations the people had none, except that of an old monk, survivor of the \" great house of White Monks \" (Abbey Dor), who is evidently in Rowland's eyes a great deal worse than nobody ; though I cannot decide whether a Papist or a Puritan was his chiefest aversion \u2014 probably the latter, the religion which did not allow oaths being quite unfit for any gentleman. The poet, John Davies of Hereford, who lauds his kinsman with such fervour that only the knowledge that he was writing master to Henry Prince of Wales, and a xvii b"], [26, "XVIII INTRODUCTION great celebrity in his own line (Fuller says his handwriting was so beautiful that one had to examine it under a magnifier to see if it were print or no), prevents one thinking that he was largely in Rowland's debt, says that \"the Mechanicalls \" all wore \"scarlet capps,\" and filled their chapps and lapps from the forty dishes, which we learn were daily provided for them. This scarlet Rowland also alludes to, saying that if he did go again to Court he would be but a shabby figure, though smart in a sense, as wearing \" scarlets of Builth, or Welch frize.\" It was twenty years from the time of that walk, one day in March, before the account of the water-works was begun \u2014 and that appa rently took about six years to write, as he notes events taking place as he writes in 1604, an(l the date of publication is 16 10. That he dictated it is evident, from the words \" take breath \" written in by error on the part of the secretary at the close of a sentence. While the \" Water- works\" were in progress old Dame Blanche died (in 1589). She left Rowland a most handsome bequest in those times, and also for the repair of the road betAveen \" Moat and Douro, and NeAv"], [27, "XIX INTRODUCTION Court and Moorhampton.\" Douro sounds so suggestive of Spanish settlers that I must quote what my MS. says about it : \" The vale of Straddel is that which we call the Golden Valley \u2014 ystrad in Welsh is valley \u2014 and we may believe this is the most ancient denomination of it, for dyffrin dwr being sounded among the Normands, they thought they had heard the word d'or, and so Eng lished it the Golden Valley, whereas the latter Welsh denomination signifies noe more than the Watry Valley.\" Thus my manuscript ; but another legend has it that when the Saxon invaders pushed the Welsh back into \"Welsh Wales,\" they asked some captive the name of the little brook which runs purling through the valley, and were told Dwr, which means simply water, but which they caught up as Dor, and hereafter called the river \"the Dor.\" In later days the monks, moved either by the fairness of the landscape or the golden rich ness of the fields ripe for harvest, perpetrated a monkly jest, and called the valley Valle d'Oro, the Golden Valley, or the Valley of the Dor. However that may be, in Rowland's time it was always called the Golden Valley,"], [28, "XX INTRODUCTION but the great ruined abbey at the mouth of it was known as Abbey Dor or Douro, and it is then between the abbey and Moat that the road was to be kept up. Immediately after the Reformation, John Scudamore, of Kent Church, had interposed to stop the work of desecration and spoliation of the abbey, and turned part of it into an Anglican place of worship, and I suppose it is to him alone we owe the partial preservation of it \u2014 all honour to his name ! From 1584 to 1600 RoAvland was involved in one laAvsuit after another. They are extremely dull lawsuits, their only interest being that they show what large possessions Rowland had acquired, either by inheritance, money-lending, or purchase. The suit in 1584 is against one Dame Anne Gresham, with regard to some property Avhich Rowland owns by right of his wife, who inherited from her brother William, who died childless in 1582. Then in 1596 is one against James Parry of Poston, who seeks to \" redeem tithes within the townships of Poterchurch, Hynton, Taylorshope, Wilbroke, Leynalls, and Wylaw stone, in the parish of Peterchurch, which he"], [29, "XXI INTRODUCTION held in lease for years, and the park of Snod hill, his inheritance, which he mortgaged.\" Rowland had lent James Parry on the security of the abovenamed tithes. Then comes a Star-Chamber case, and then, crowning misfortune, one in the \" Court of Wardes,\" which, as Rowland pathetically says, \" Bredd more Avhite haires in my head in one yeare then all my wetshod water-works in sixteene.\" This case lasted five years, and during its course Rowland Avent home to see to his \"drownings\" (sadly neglected, we hear, during his absence), leaving his \"Wanton Warde,\" as he calls her, in charge of a Puritan tailor, and the next thing he hears is that his \" Welsh niece,\" alias the Wanton Warde, has married the tailor's nephew. Rowland's wrath knows no bounds ; he has a stormy intervieAV with the tailor, who declares his ignorance of the intrigue ; but when Rowland wants him to swear on the cross of his shears, he refuses, it being against his principles to swear. It is not, however, against Rowland's, and black surmises about complicity are made, and our poor old squire loses all chance of the customary \"tip\" over that ward's marriage, and is not that enough"], [30, "INTRODUCTION of itself to \"brede white hairs in a Brittaines beard 1 \" In 1594 Rowland's sister, \"Lady Gattes,\" died ; and as her funeral certificate is rather quaint, I append it ; it is from the coUection at the College of Arms. \" Catherine, Lady Gattes, doughter to Watkyn Vaughan of Bredwardyn, in Com.

This property Rowland had bought from Sir Christopher Hatton, who had received it as a grant from Queen Elizabeth. After one intermediate generation this property passed into the hands of the Clives of Styche (in Shropshire), who in 1800 bought out some descendants of the New Court Parrys, who still had Wormebridge place, and pulled down both houses, building in their stead their present seat of Whitfield. The last page of Rowland's book contains a formal acknowledgment of a debt of forty shillings. Of the four copies to which I have had access, only three have the acknowledg ment, and only one has any name filled in. The name has been carefully erased, not so carefully, however, but that we fancy we can decipher it as William Powell, in the parish of Llywell, in the county of Brecknock, xxiii"], [32, "XXIV INTRODUCTION the last word being quite clear.

Gough, in his \" Typographica Brittanica,\" mentions two maps, but I have only been able to reproduce one, from a photograph off an engraving in Duncombe's copy of the work, which engraving was discovered by Dr. Vevers of Hereford in 1883. It should be somewhere about the centre of the book ; but I have, for various reasons, put it in the place of the missing frontispiece. The two main ostensible reasons for the book, namely, the irrigation scheme, and the commonwealth or community of trades, do not by any means sum up Rowland's resources. He must have had great mechanical skill, as he used his water-power for all sorts of pur poses, amongst others for turning his kitchen spits (at the factory, not at home), and sawing timber. He soon discovered the cheapness of water traffic, and built a boat to convey his farm produce from the White House to New"], [34, "INTRODUCTION Court, where the \" Mechanicalls \" had their headquarters ; whilst his remarks on the breeding and rearing of calves, though they savour somewhat of the kindergarten system of education (teaching by playing), show that he took great heed to his stock as well as his crop. I cannot find if any of his neighbours followed his example ; for, though my manu script tells of the remains of trenches at Moccas, where his brother Henry lived, one can only conjecture that they might possibly have been for irrigation purposes, and I have searched in vain for any remark in the his tories of Shropshire about that ill-judged attempt of Maister Hoord, of which Rowland speaks in his book. The date of Rowland's death and his age are unknown. I can find neither will, in quisition, nor certificate ; but on a beam in Peterchurch Church is the Vaughan coat-of arms, quartered with that of Gams (?), with date 1612, the last figure somewhat doubtful, which I take to be a monument to the old man. The blazon of the Vaughan coat, which is reproduced on the title-page, is \u2014 Sable a chevron argent between three boys' heads affrontee, couped at the shoulder proper, xxvi"], [35, "XXVII INTRODUCTION crined or, and about each neck a serpent entwined vert. This coat was adopted on account of the legend that Moredig Warwyn, one of their ancestors, was born with a snake round his neck. The Bredwardine Vaughans always bore the chevron, as appears in the visitation of Herefordshire of 1619, from which the York herald has copied this coat for me. There is a legend that our Rowland is buried at West Ham, but there are no regis ters there prior to 1653, and there is no trace of a tomb ; but I found the inquisition of a certain Rowland Vaughan, a city knight, who died in 161 2, and I consider he was probably buried in the old church, not our Hereford shire Rowland ; the fact that this city man had also a wife Elizabeth, and left no male heir, is quite enough to account for the story. Elizabeth Vaughan re-married a certain Richard Leighton, and is buried at Vow church. The date on the tomb is 1640, but it is so rudely cut that it may have been added later, and be quite incorrect. The in scription runs thus : \" I. H. S. Here lieth the body of Eliza Leighton, wife to Richard"], [36, "XXVIII INTRODUCTION Leigh, and formerly married to Rowland Vaughan, Esquire, deceased.\" Rowland had three children. One son, John, who died sans issue, I believe, before his father \u2014 he was alive and of age in 1609 \u2014 and two daughters. Jane, who had New Court, married her kinsman, Stephen Parry of Moorhampton, who exchanged the com bined properties for that of Arkeston, in the parish of Kingston, Co. Hereford. Blanche married Epiphany Haworth, and had the White House, where her father had always lived. This was occupied by descendants of hers till about fifty years ago, when it changed hands. Some chairs, which had belonged to Queen Elizabeth, and which she is said to have given to Henry Parry of New Court, Rowland's grandfather ; and a portrait of a lady in Welsh dress, bearing inscription, \"Blanche Parry, 1590,\" were bought at the sale by, and still belong to, Dr. Jenkins of the Copelands, Hereford. As to the original of the portrait, the greatest authorities dis agree. It was long thought to be the cele brated lady of the Bedchamber, but as she died very old, and blind, in 1589, that is impossible. Mr. Parry of Harewood con-"], [37, "XXIX INTRODUCTION siders it to have been Blanche Haworth herself, though I cannot see why it should then be called Blanche Parry. I think it is of her sister's mother-in-law, who was Blanche Parry both as maid and wife, though I own I cannot account for its presence at the White House, unless Jane and Stephen did not care to move it with them to Arkeston. Herefordshire is singularly unlucky in its county history. Duncombe, who was writing one to order, was not public-spirited enough to continue his work on the death of his patron ; and though other hands have con tinued his work with the help of his notes, the Hundred of Webtree is altogether omit ted, while the Hundred of EAvyas is very sketchily done, and contains no mention of Rowland or his works. That they were the sight and talk of the neighbourhood, is evident from the fact that open table was kept for visitors to the commonwealth, whose coming was notified by a watchman by beat of drum or blair of trumpet, according to the condition of the approaching guess, \" whether he be horseman or footman.\" In 1801 Mrs. Burton, the wife of the then vicar of Atcham, in Shropshire, and herself"], [38, "XXX INTRODUCTION one of the Parry family, pilgrimaged to Bacton and New Court, and describes the latter place as being a dreary, ruinous farm house. It had once been moated, according to the custom of our ancestors. In two of the rooms, which seemed to have been bed rooms, were remains of carved oak wains cotting, and an old carved staircase betrayed evident traces of the splendours of past times. An upper room had been curiously painted, some of the figures yet remaining on the walls. The ceiling appeared to have been arched ; the Gothic window remained to determine the architectural character of the old mansion. Mrs. Burton speaks with en thusiasm of a magnificent variegated oak, and describes the remains of the terraced gardens, with its ruined summer-house. The old farmhouse was replaced by a modern build ing shortly after this visit ; and NeAv Court and Moorhampton are now farmhouses of the most ordinary (I mean commonplace) description. The absolute disappearance of all traces of Rowland's irrigation works, and of the great buildings necessary for the housing and employing of his community, can only be attributed to the civil wars, which raged"], [39, "XXXI INTRODUCTION with great fury in Herefordshire, a most obstinate stronghold of the Royalists.

The -reason why I planted so many within the length of two miles, was this : the river being thirty foote broad, and ten-foote deepe, my Trench -roy all beeing but ten-foote broad, and foure-foote deepe, it received no more water then the breadth and depth would give leave. Not-with-standing the quantity o.water my Trench-royall received, I did not find the want of any in the maine-river ; which caused me to raise those two other sluces: grieving so commodious an Element, so rich and substantiall, should fall into the Bowels of the sea, with-out profit.

I call that a counter-trench, where part of the river is stolne in by the rising of the flood to the levell of the banke with-out sluce.
