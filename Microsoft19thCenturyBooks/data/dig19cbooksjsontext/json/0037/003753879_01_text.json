CHAPTER I. I make up my mind to go to Monte-Carlo\u2014 I find an unex- pected travelling- companion in Frank Spelfield. It was about the middle of February of last year that I made up my mind to go to Monte-Carlo. Six or seven weeks of uninterrupted practice of the British virtue of hospitality to sundry country friends, nieces and nephews, had physically, morally and mentally undermined my constitution. But it was the advice of an eminent London physician which virtually added the last straw to the already overburdened back. I give his diagnosis and the remedies suggested textually. \" There is nothing much the matter with youj my dear sir,\" he said paternally. \" I am afraid you have overworked yourself, taken your meals irre gularly and hurriedly, and above all not varied them enough. Though I am not an advocate of a too highly-seasoned cuisine, I think the opposite error is quite as bad. I mean plain chops and B"], [12, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. -1 steaks and boiled and roast. Above all you have been poring too much over your books, not gone out enough. Why not try the theatres, a few dinner-parties, a dance now and then. You seem to suffer from insomnia. What you want chiefly is a little excitement. That will put you all right/' Up till then I had always considered that clever tale about Deburau, the famous French harlequin going to consult the physician, and the latter tell ing him to go and see Deburau a myth. I now believe it to be Gospel truth. Here had I been not doing a stroke of work for weeks, except correct some proofs. Here had I been sitting through luncheons and dinners of two and three hours' duration, cramming myself with entrees and entremets, and longing for an unsophisticated chop or steak, and that man was telling me to avoid plain food. I had pored over no books except over those containing the words of the pantomimes, which I almost knew by heart, and that man was telling me to go to the theatres. Here had I been falling asleep amidst the most gorgeous trans formation scenes and during the most harrowing episodes of the Adelphi melodrama. Here had I been having row upon row with my housekeeper for not waking me in the morning, and she reply ing that it wanted a foghorn and not a human voice to accomplish the task, and there was that man telling me that I was suffering from want of sleep. Ye gods, ye gods ! I felt like the applewoman must have felt when"], [13, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 3 Daniel O'Connell called her a parallelogram. I rose in silence, in silence I put down my fee, in silence I left the inner sanctum of the great man's house. I felt inclined to ask the sable-clad butler who showed me out what undertaker he was touting for, but I didn't. I was afraid that his answer, if truthfully given, might compel me to indict him and his master for conspiracy against the lives of her Majesty's lieges. There was, however, one sentence of the great man's little speech that clung persistently to my mind. He had said what I chiefly wanted was a little excitement. Of course he could have only meant pleasant excitement, for had he not men tioned the theatres and dances in the same breath ? He was not bound to know that the nightly suffer ings of Mr. Terriss and other stage heroes and heroines do not bring a tear to my eyes, that their ultimate happiness at the fall of the curtain leaves me perfectly apathetic. He was not bound to know that I had left off dancing a quarter of a century ago, when I was still very young. There are men who dance till they are old. I have seen them myself \u2014 mostly in the illustrations of the Christmas numbers, now and then at the Police Ball, and at the Licensed Victuallers'. We are not told the exact age of David when he danced before the ark, but we are plainly given to understand that Michal, Saul's daughter, despised him. As I object to being despised by anything in petticoats \u2014 be it a daughter or a mother \u2014 I no longer dance. B 2"], [14, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 4 It was very evident, then, that the excitement could not be got out of theatres and dances. There was the alternative of trying to fall in love with one of my numerous fair acquaintances, but it was a ticklish experiment at best. I had tried it before, to my own discomfiture and that of my lawyers, a most respectable firm, who hinted that they did not care to have their name connected in the papers with breach of promise cases and such like. Up to this day I am profoundly ignorant of what they meant by \" such like.\" I was once on the point of inquiring, but was interrupted by the head of the firm telling one of the clerks to send the deed boxes of Lord Cantabile to Messrs. Simeon and Simeon. Next day I read in the Society papers that a petition had been filed in the Divorce Court, in which Lord Cantabile was cited as the co-respondent. I am certain that his lord ship was as innocent of the charge as a newborn babe, but since then I have 'a salutary fear of being taxed with having caused a simple or com pound fracture of the seventh commandment. Still, I am reluctant to think that the \" such like \" of my legal advisers referred to a like possibility in my case. While pondering where the excitement was to come from, I had got as far as the Piccadilly end of Bond Street. When there I stopped and like the becalmed mariner scanned the horizon to discover the quarter whence the exciting breeze was to blow, because with the perverseness of human"], [15, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 5 nature I was by this time fully agreed as to the urgent necessity of carrying out that part of the physician's programme. At the same moment a parcel van of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway drew up at the kerbstone, and a large bil! setting forth the attractions of the Carnival at Nice caught my eye. I felt like Moses must have felt when he was shown a glimpse of the Promised Land, for to me the country flowing with milk and honey was not the old Italian town with its illumi- nations, piazzas, masqueraders, battles of flowers and confetti, balls and processions, but a sunny rock a few -miles beyond, yclept Monte-Carlo. Still, the idea had struck root there and then. I made a mental calculation of my available resources, and found that they amounted to seventy-five pounds, fifteen of which, in the shape of three 5/. notes, were in my breastpocket. How I regretted that guinea spent an hour ago. It meant five chances on the red or black at roulette, it meant at least twenty minutes of excitement, it meant 160 fr. if successful. The reader may conclude from this that I am a desperate gambler, if so, the reader knows nothing of desperate gamblers who would stake their 25 fr. on one turn of the wheel. If I were a \" drinkist\" I should pray for the throat of a giraffe in order to make the sensation of \" sinking the liquor \" last the longer. Seventy-five pounds would land me with a clear sixty at Monte-Carlo, and my return ticket available for four weeks in my pocket. It would leave me"], [16, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 6 thirty pounds to try my luck, which thirty pounds properly spread over the allotted time meant five chances a day, because one can live for a pound per diem even at the H6tel de Paris, if one knows how, and happens to be a journalist besides. The managers are always ready to make some conces sions to one of the fraternity, especially if he be English. The foreigner who is willing to apply the axiom of \" I'll tickle you and you'll tickle me,\" to the British scribe nearly always finds that he gets more tickling than he gives. The manager of the H6tel de Paris, which is situated in the grounds of the Casino itself, has only had cause once to regret his generosity in that respect. He entertained an angel unawares. In return for the tickling, the angel bared the flaming sword of denunciation of the gaming-tables and all that pertains thereto. The angel was the editor of a quasi-religious paper, subsidized by some pseudo society for the suppression of well-mannered, well bred, and well-dressed recreation. The angel pocketed the expenses allowed to him by his principals, and fell foul of everything. No wonder, the angel had been gambling all the while, and had finally made a pretty round sum, when the night previous to his departure he fell in with a fair-haired sister angel, hailing from the Quartier de l'Europe in Paris. She robbed him of the whole, and he was afraid of having his name in the papers.

The bill of the Chatham and Dover, with its irresistible invitation still further enhanced by the rapid calculation just mentioned, had virtually settled the question. By the time I got to Sack ville Street my mind was fully made up to go to Monte-Carlo. I stood looking for a moment or so at the sporting prints in Messrs. Fore's windows, when I felt a hand gently laid on my shoulder. I turned round and found my chum, Frank Spelfield, standing by my side. \" Studying the bank on which to break your neck ? \" asked Frank, smiling. \" No ; simply studying the knack by which to break the bank,\" I replied, yielding to the fatal temptation of perpetrating an atrocious pun. I was sorry immediately afterwards, so sorry, in fact, as to feel bound to explain. But Frank had caught the meaning at once. \" Hurrah ! going to Monte-Carlo,\" he exclaimed. \" So am I. Let us go and take our tickets at once.\" I looked at Frank with blank amazement. This was Saturday morning. When I left him on the Tuesday night he had not broached a syllable of his intention to go to Monte-Carlo. What had happened since then ? \"You CToing to Monte-Carlo, and all of a"], [18, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 8 sudden?\" I said. \"You did not mention it on Tuesday night ? \" \" No more did you,\" he laughed ; but there seemed to me something constrained in his laughter. \" That's true,\" I answered. \" But then, I have no one to consult, while you have Martha, and above all Lady Crimson. What does she think of it ? \" \" I'll tell you all about it on our journey ; let us go and take our tickets first,\" he said, hurrying me along, and before I knew where I was I found myself standing in Cook's office opposite St. James' Church. \" For how long are we going ? \" asked Frank. \" For four weeks,\" I replied. \" We had better go for six. I have made arrangements with Jarvis to do the work for six, and the boss is quite agreeable as long as I send some stuff from the Riviera.\" \"But my money won't hold out so long,\" I objected, laughing. \" Bother the money,\" said Frank. \" I have got enough for both ; besides, we'll make some over there.\" But for the first part of the sentence, the last would have sounded ominous to me. Surely Frank Spelfield had not been bitten by the mania of making a fortune at Monte-Carlo ? Whatever were my misgivings in that respect, they vanished at the sight of what was to me a still greater"], [19, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 9 cause for astonishment \u2014 I will not say uneasiness. If I had been fairly amazed at Frank's suddenly announced resolution of accompanying me, I was absolutely staggered at the appearance of a brand new pocket-book and its contents, which he took out to pay for the tickets \u2014 he insisted that we should settle up afterwards. The Russian leather case was positively stuffed with crisp bank-notes. At a rough guess there must have been seven or eight hundred pounds' worth of them. I noticed that much when he tendered three 10I. ones in exchange for the tickets. Such a sum in the possession of Frank Spel field, who, apart from a moderate allowance from his father, a physician in good practice in one of the northern towns, had no resources but those of his pen, who furthermore was the most impro vident creature on earth, who, pecuniarily, was nearly always \" on his beam ends,\" as he ex pressed it , who in fact had adopted a motto to that effect, \" In the midst of life we are in debt ; \" such a sum in his possession was not only a marvel, but, as I said before, a somewhat disquiet ing marvel. Whether Frank noticed my perplexity or not I cannot say, but after the transaction at Cook's office had been concluded, he seemed very anxious to get away. \" I have an appointment to lunch with Martha and Lady Crimson,\" he said ; \" so I must rush.

Good-bye, old man.\" And he jumped into a hansom, while I stood in the middle of the pavement, puzzled, worrying my brain as to how he got hold of seven or eight hundred pounds. What was the mystery con nected with this sudden wealth \u2014 the crime, perhaps ?"], [21, "CHAPTER II. I remain in the dark with regard to the mystery\u2014 The late Franijois Blanc of Homburg and Monte-Carlo. We only stopped two days in Paris, the guileless inhabitants of which hospitable city were rehearsing the effects of a new version of their hospitality as they intended to perform it at the forthcoming exhibition. As a matter of course the best pro perties to be used in the new play, including furniture and hangings at the hotels, had gone to be cleaned and done up ; the rehearsals were conducted with the shabbiest they could find, and we were relegated to bare rooms on the fourth floor. On the other hand, lest they should not be letter perfect in their dialogue when the curtain rose, shop-keepers, hotel-keepers, and restaurateurs alike \u2014 to say nothing of Jehu and his delectable fellow-extortioner, the cafe waiter, were repeating whole sentences of it, before there was any occa sion \u2014 to our minds. \" Everything, monsieur, is already thrice as dear as it used to be, and we do not know what the consequences will be,\" they said constantly. \" I know,\" said Frank, who speaks French very"], [22, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 12 well, to a restaurateur whom he knew and who saluted him with the same lament. \" For the present we'll not dine here, we'll come back this time next year, when prices are down. Au revotr until then.\" Frank had been in capital spirits ever since we started, but the promised explanation of his suddenly acquired wealth had not been forth coming. That there was some mystery con nected with the money as well as with the impulsively undertaken journey I felt confident, the nature of it baffled my powers of divination. The money was there, and as usual, spent with a lavish hand. Whence had it come ? I was unable to guess. Less difficult was it to fathom, unaided, the purpose of the journey. Though Frank was careful enough to conceal his hand, it was evident to me that he was cocksure of making a coup. This naturally led me to watch for a hint on his part of having a system, for I have before now seen men like Frank, who had scarcely touched a card in their lives, becoming victims to that kind of hallucination. But no such hint came, and still Frank seemed to me perfectly at ease with regard to the final upshot of his trip to Monte-Carlo. He betrayed as much not only by his conversation, but by his acts. He even talked of starting a weekly on his return to London, though I knew \u2014 in fact he confessed it \u2014 that the sum of money he had upon him was all he had in the world. Once"], [23, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 13 more ; it was certain that he felt confident ol success. Personally I felt neither confident nor the reverse. If on my return to town I had the necessary cab fare for conveying me and my belongings home, I would look upon the whole thing as a matter of course. Nor would it surprise me, if in addition to the sum taken with me I brought back a hundred or a hundred and fifty pounds. I had no system, merely a quiet way of putting small stakes on columns and dozens at random but at the same time, which had often proved profitable. For my acquaintance with the roulette tables and their late presiding genius, M. Francois Blanc, was of long standing. It dates from long before the Franco-German War. It was at Baden-Baden in the sixties that I saw M. Blanc for the first time, on the very day that Emperor (then King) William and Napoleon III. had their interview. I was having a chat with a superannuated croupier, who had been appointed inspector of the gaming rooms, on the steps of the Kursaal. Martin was a kind, nice, courteous sexagenarian, always ready to give the journalist a bit of anecdotal gossip about the celebrated personages with whom in the course of his career he had come in contact, and whose private history he had at his fingers' ends. For the croupier does come in contact with them. In the excitement of the game, prince, peer and peasant disappear, the punter alone remains. I was standing on the steps of the Kursaal then"], [24, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 14 previous to going to the Lichtenthal Allee, whither the crowd had gone to see the sovereigns pass ; there were few people inside. \" Aren't you going to the Lichtenthal Allee, Monsieur Martin?\" I asked. The old man shrugged his shoulders. \" The sight of King William is no novelty to us. He comes here pretty well every year.\" \"True; but what about Emperor Napoleon ? \" \" The Emperor Napoleon,\" quoth Martin, ponder ing as it were. \" I saw the first one when quite a lad. This one is the third son of Queen Hortense, the one who used to travel about a good deal. If I am not mistaken \u2014 \" \" You are not mistaken, Martin ;\" came a voice from behind us. \" He still owes twenty-five louis to the bank.\" I looked round and saw a thin, wizened, shrivelled old man, below rather than above the middle height. Though it was very warm he wore a long overcoat reaching to his heels and hanging on his angular limbs as it would have hung on a clothes-prop. I am positive that he would not have turned the scales at 9 st., yet he seemed to move ponderously ; but it was neither ill-health nor weight that impeded his locomotion, as I found out afterwards, I have never had the sensation of meeting with a live snake in a wood, but from what I have read, I should imagine that its slow movement towards one, the sudden rear ing of the head when close to its intended victim,"], [25, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 15 and the putting forth of its fangs, were something like M. Blanc's manner of approach. M. Blanc's fangs consisted of a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles, which by the mere play of the facial muscles he moved up and down his nose, lowering them as far as the tip and then arresting their further descent like a Japanese acrobat gliding down a pole. Then there would be disclosed a pair of deep-set grey eyes that could assume an infinite variety of expression, ranging from the most benign kindness to the hardest callousness, but at all times piercing the very soul of his interlocutor. When Francois Blanc lowered his spectacles, it was tantamount to the knight of old lowering his vizor, he was ready for battle. The rest of the face was remarkable enough in all conscience, firmly set lips, the upper one furnished with a few scanty, bristly grey hairs, chevaux de frise as it were to a cynical mouth, a not unshapely nose, with nostrils ever on the quiver, sniffing moral and mental corruption from afar. Still with all this, a generous man at times. I have only seen one face like it in my life, that of Count von Moltke. The likeness may be a purely imaginary one on my part, but the intense and concentrated power of the features was the same. \"You are not mistaken, Martin,\" he chuckled once more. \" He still owes twenty-five louis to the bank ; \" and then he slowly walked away, leaning heavily on his gold-knobbed walking-stick."], [26, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 16 I had no need to ask his name. I instinctively knew this to be Francois Blanc. No man has been more systematically abused than Francois Blanc. Of no man did and does, the world \u2014 the glib leader-write/ included \u2014 know so little. The exploits of a Napoleon I., a Bismarck, and a Cavour, the motives that impelled them, have been recorded in \" Memoirs \" and \" Histories :'' people were fairly asked to judge from facts put before them. The exploits of Francois Blanc have never had their historian ; to the world at large he was nothing more than a successful speculator on the vices of others. Well, at the risk of being contradicted I beg to maintain that Blanc was more, a great deal more than that. In his own line he displayed as much genius as any of the three men just named, if by genius we mean a capacity for reading the human heart, the faculty of foreseeing events, and to apply the knowledge to his own profit by catering for the amusement of the better classes. He has benefited a certain section of the world's \" society \" a great deal more than did either Napoleon, Bismarck, or Cavour, and his benefits have left a far less bitter taste, a far less rankling hatred among the nations. I have not been deputed to white wash the memory of the king of roulette and trente et-quarante \u2014 if whitewashing be necessary \u2014 but in making Monte-Carlo what it is, he has done eminent service to Europe on the whole.

Blanc's system than under those thrust upon people by the advertisements of public com panies, shady stock-brokers, and shadier book makers in the daily papers. The roulette tables at Monte-Carlo have not bred embezzling clerks, pilfering shopmen, fraudulent trustees, absconding cashiers, and the like. Lord Brougham's discovery of the Riviera would at best have but provided a health-resort to a comparatively small number of valetudinarians ; the latter, no more than the devil, are entitled to a monopoly of all the good tunes. Yet, until the Spelugues Hill became Monte-Carlo, they, the valetudinarians kept away all those who delighted not in the diurnal con sumption of bronchial troches, whose conversation aimed at something more catholic than the discussion of the respective merits of chest protec tors and respirators, they made a fellow ashamed of being sound in limb and lung. They have been relegated to Cannes, Mentone, Roquebrune ; even Nice knows them no more. The few asthmatical, gouty, and consumptive loungers to be met with on the Promenade des Anglais in the latter town are there for a little show, the Nice municipality is suspected of keeping them as a kind of exculpatory puff; nay, it is even whispered that there is nothing the matter with them, that they are merely super annuated actors who utilize their talents that way. To return for a moment to M. Blanc and to the C"], [28, "18 We Two at Monte-Carlo. history of his roulette tables. In 1863 trente-et- quarante and roulette seemed a great deal more firmly established at Homburg and Baden-Baden than they appear at Monaco now ; the concession transferred from Benazet to Blanc had another ten years to run. To the ordinary observer there was not the slightest indication that at the end of the decade Prussia would be too great a power to accept the profits accruing from the gaming-tables ; the Schleswig-Holstein War had not been fought, the humiliation of Austria, let alone the crushing defeat of France, had no consistency in any one's brain, except, perhaps, in that of Bismarck and oi Von Moltke. We may be pretty well certain that neither of these, nor Cavour, had made Francois Blanc the confidant of their schemes for the unification and aggrandizement of their countries, yet Francois foresaw not only the possibility but the probability ofboth. Proof whereof the following : \u2014 The Monaco concession dates from 1856. It was, however, not granted to Francois Blanc, but to Langlois and Aubert. Florestan I., Prince of Monaco, and the immediate predecessor of the delectable Charles III . who died last year, and whose virtues had better be left undiscussed, would have preferred dealing with a man of substance like Blanc to dealing with men of straw like Langlois and Aubert, who at the time were little more than that. But Blanc kept coy, he would not hear of it. Nor did he attempt to make an offer in the early part of '60, when"], [29, "We Two at Monte- Carlo. 19 Langlois and Aubert negotiated with Lefebvre, who became their successor. The Bismarck that was to be had scarcely dawned upon the poli tical horizon, and Blanc felt perfectly secure where he was. Different was it in '63, not with regard to the outer world, but with regard to Blanc. He had had a peep at the monster, probably at Frankfort, and he took the measure of his potentiality at once. It will be remembered that Prince (then Count) von Bismarck was recalled from Paris in the end of July, 1862, to take the direction of affairs in Berlin. Before a twelvemonth had elapsed Blanc bought out Lefebvre. Before any statesman in Europe he foresaw what was coming. I once saw Count Beust in Paris, and he positively told me that Francois Blanc in the beginning of '63 said to him, \" L'Empire allemand est une chose accomplie d'aiijcurd'hui, je n'ai qua me caser ailleurs \" (The German Empire is as good as an accomplished fact to-day, the best thing I can do is to find a shop elsewhere). The reader must bear with me a little longer, for I wish to give him an idea of the man to whom he owes such enjoyment as he happens to derive from a stay at Monte-Carlo. The world has been pestered with biographies of all kinds, why not a short sketch of Francois Blanc ? Should the reader be bored he can easily skip the chapter. In 1871 the concession originally granted to Langlois and Aubert by Charles III. had still fifteen years to run, and the present occupant of C 2"], [30, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 20 the throne of Monaco had not announced his intention of suppressing the gaming-tables in his State the moment he had the chance. If he had, Francois Blanc would have probably laughed at him, for he knew petty rulers in general, and the Grimaldis in particular, too well not to know that they do not quarrel with their bread and butter, especially if the dispensers of the latter are not mere ignorant, down-trodden subjects. Still, in 1 87 1 Blanc already foresaw what in all probability will happen before we are many years older, namely, a war between Italy and France, when the principality of Monaco will be annexed to the territories of the victor and the gaming-tables swept away. Between the surrender of Paris (28th Jan., 1871), and the outbreak of the Commune (18th March) I happened to be first at Cologne, afterwards in Homburg. A description of the encampment of the French prisoners of war outside the former city does not come within the scope of this little book. With the Mark Tapleyian capacity of their nation for making the best of things, they had, among other amusements, established a roulette-table with the maximum of fifty centimes on even chances. At the Hotel du Nord, where I was staying, I met Count Barsowsky, whom I had known in Paris, where we had become very friendly. Barsowsky was and is very rich, but a gambler to the back bone. He was a frequent visitor to the camp, and it was amusing to see the man to whom a thousand"], [31, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 21 pounds was a flea-bite, gamble for coppers with just as much zest as if the stakes had been pounds. Not for long, however, his craving got more voracious, and he flitted to Homburg, whither I accompanied him. The most brilliant season on the Riviera of the present day is flat and dull compared to that winter season in Homburg. People seemed to vie with one another in proving the truth of the Rochefoucauldian maxim about bearing the mis fortunes of others with resignation and cheerfulness. The hotels were crowded mostly with \" patriotic \" Frenchmen, who would have shed their blood for their country but for the fact of her being governed at the time by \" the grocer's son from Cahors.\" That was how Gambetta was generally designated at the tables-d'hote and in the conversations in Homburg. The elegant villas were tenanted by wealthy Russians, who, while sincerely regretting the reverses suffered by France, were somewhat angry at having been baulked of their winter entertainments on the banks of the Seine ; by rich German families who had been forcibly driven from Paris ; by nondescripts and adventurers of all nations, who were almost thankful for the calamity, seeing that it afforded them the opportunity of making harvest at a time when as a rule their talents in that respect lay fallow, for be it remem bered that in their halcyon days Pau and Biarritz were but a limited Tom Tiddler's ground to them ; and that the Monte-Carlo of to-day was undreamt"], [32, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 22 of, notwithstanding the reforms and improvements already inaugurated then by Francois Blanc. But the place chiefly swarmed with Frenchmen, officers of all grades at large on parole, non-com- missioned officers also, because there were several encampments of prisoners not very far off. One heard nothing but French, even the Marseillaise fell now and then upon the ear ; the German authorities evidently taking a leaf in that respect from the book of Frederick the Great, who speak- ing of his subjects opined that they might say and write and sing what they liked, provided they let him do what he liked. The lesson of Mazarin, given three centuries before then was distinctly lost upon the French, for they continued to sing and they continued to pay, so the Marseillaise was frequently entoned with great vigour. \" The day of glory,\" which according to the first verse, \" had dawned \" was generally spent, not in knocking down \" the gory standard of tyranny,\" but in the hectx-kneipe where French wines were advertised for sale, the same that in every tobacconist window there was a label inscribed with the magic words, \" Caporal Francais ;\" French newspapers were to be found at the corner of every street ; Chevet's stewpans never grew cold ; Homburg, in fact, was for the time being, a miniature Paris.

On the occasion referred to above, he could scarcely have caught more than a passing glimpse of my face, yet, such"], [33, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 23 was the marvellous memory of the man that he not only remembered it at once, but the circumstances connected with our first meeting. We were stroll ing through the rooms when we came upon him. Count Barsowsky was an old acquaintance, so they shook hands ; then he turned to me. For a mo ment and for one moment only he hesitated, one could plainly see the working of his brain, as from its recesses he brought to the top the recollection of me. \" I am afraid, I may draw my pen through that debt of five-and-twenty louis now,\" he said with a smile and holding out his hand. If that is not marvellous, I do not know what is. As for his appearance it had not altered a bit, nor did it alter until the very last. He insisted upon our going home to dinner with him. He was a bachelor for the time being, Ma- dame Blanc and his two daughters, who became respectively Princesses Roland Bonaparte and Radziwill, were staying at Frankfort for a little while. As a matter of course the war, which had just reached its denouement, but the epilogue to which was still a matter of conjecture, provided the principal topic for conversation. Both the Count and M. Blanc were strongly sympathetic to the French ; still M. Blanc's remarks on his country's misfortunes were by no means of the utterly de- spondent kind, it was only when we got to the smoking-room that he drew a deep, long sigh, while sipping his coffee and puffing at his cigar. \" What a dreadful misfortune, this war;\" he moaned."], [34, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 24 \" Of course it's dreadful, but you have no cause for complaint,\" remarked the Count. \" You have never had a winter season like it.\" \" Yes, it is like the last piece of fireworks at a fete, the best but the last. The chances of the re newal of my concession were small enough before the war, they are absolutely nil now,\" lamented M. Blanc. \" They have been fought at Reichshofen and Mars-la-Tour, as Waterloo was said to be fought at Eton. And there will be no end to the fighting. Monaco will come next. If I could but find a kitchen, a stable, a garret where to establish another bank.\" \" I could give you all three, but unfortunately there's no railway to them, but I have got an idea for all that. Why not sound Prince Lichtenstein. He has not made his peace with Prussia, and is not likely to do so for a long while. He may establish as many tables as he likes in his principality and Vaduz is by no means an ugly spot.\" Up till now I do not know whether Count Bar sowsky was in jest or in earnest. One thing I do know that Blanc decided there and then to act upon his advice. A few months later the Austrian papers teemed with comments on M. Blanc's pro jects. He had offered to contribute a million francs per annum to the St. Peter's Pence-Fund for every table established; in addition to this he would undertake to build a Vatican for Pio Nono, in the event of the latter or his successor being driven from Rome by the Italians. Prince Lich-"], [35, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 25 tenstein, though a fervent Catholic, was highly in dignant at Blanc's proposals, and in the end of '72, Monaco was the only resource left to him. Now, one thing is very certain. Though he became in his latter days somewhat close-fisted with regard to his private expenses, Francois Blanc was neither a miser nor a spendthrift. If the former, he would not have lavished the millions he did on Monte-Carlo. The spot itself was beau tiful enough to have dispensed with all the em bellishments carried out since then, and Blanc himself had gauged the temper of the gambler well enough when he said that he, the gambler, would play in a barn. If the latter, he had enough and to spare to live on the most extravagant footing. Seeing that when he died in '79, his personal estate, exclusive of his interest in the Monaco concern, was proved to amount to two millions and a half sterling, we may take it for granted that, at the time he was lamenting to us, he was worth close upon two millions. To a man who makes a note of every penny spent , who has a battle royal with his womankind when oneofthem wants an extra dress, but who, for all that, has not the greed for gold, in the sense of the ordinary miser, two millions sterling are surely enough. And to show that the extra dress was not granted without a row, but that he was not a miser in the accepted term of the word for all that, the following story will serve admirably. One day when he and his wife were at Wies-"], [36, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 26 baden, it became suddenly very hot. Madame Blanc had forgotten her sunshade and said she wanted a new one. \"They always want something, women do,\" growled Blanc. Nevertheless he went into the shop with her and paid the eighty francs for the hand some parasol she had chosen. He was, however, grumbling all the while, fumbling with his gold in his pocket. Suddenly he rushed up the steps of the Kursaal and entered the rooms. To the amazement of the employes he went up to the trente-et-quarante table and put two louis on the black. A n attendant came up with a chair. \" No necessity, I am not going to stay ; I only want to win eighty francs I have just paid for a sunshade,\" said Blanc, remaining standing. The black turned up, he had already won the handle of the sunshade back. He left the four louis and lost them. He repeated the same tactics five or six times and always with the same result. The first coup was right, the second missed fire. He was already 280 francs out of pocket, besides the money for the ill-fated sunshade. Seeing which he put four louis at once. He had not even the satisfaction of two shows for his money this time. It was swept up immediately. Then he put eight, then sixteen, but without avail ; the luck had turned against him. He had lost seven hundred francs. Thereupon he called for a chair and took out his pocket-book. One note of a thousand francs went, a second, a third, in the twinkling of an eye"], [37, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 27 almost. At the expiration of a quarter of an hour he was close upon four thousand francs to the bad. Then he sent for money to the office and began a serious battle, neither budging nor wincing, only mopping his face with his capacious bandana now and then. He never stirred until eleven o'clock, the dinner hour was .forgotteq, and when he rose from his chair at the last stroke of the clock, Madame Blanc's sunshade had cost him ninety-one thousand and odd francs. He had been fighting his own shadow, as it were ; but in the heat of the battle had taken no notice of that. It was only when he came to his senses that he felt thoroughly ashamed, and left Wiesbaden early next morning. The explanation of the man's whole character, of his despondency at the prospect of not having a colossal gambling establishment, is contained in that one story. Francois Blanc was a desperate gambler, a gambler to his finger-nails, and it was to indulge his mania that he continued to extend his enterprise wherever it was possible. Because his was not the gambling spirit that launches into stock-exchange combinations, cotton and other corners, railway speculations, or even horse-racing. He would only confront one adversary, no matter by whom represented, that adversary was pure and simple chance. The moment the slightest element of certainty entered into the affair, gambling was no longer gambling to him ; the issue of the battle"], [38, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 28 had to be decided by the revolution of a wheel, the throw of the dice, the turn of a card, by nothing else. When a man is such a gambler, and when he has besides two millions sterling at his back, he naturally wants a foeman worthy of his steel, and these cannot be found every day. Failing which he is obliged to pit himself against a whole army, like another Goliath, but like him not disdaining single combat when it is offered, though by a mere David, who mistakes the system he has evolved from his inner consciousness as a call from Providence \u2014 his providence, the goddess of chance. That there uprose many such Davids in the long career of Francois Blanc is certain. Person ally I have heard of two or three, and in each case the gauntlet flung down by them was taken up with alacrity by M. Blanc. The story of one will be sufficient, for they are all alike in their essentials, and in the upshot, namely ; the defeat of the challenger. At the time it happened, Garcia, the hero of it, had already obtained the reputation of the most audacious punter the gambling world had seen for many a day, but his fame had until then been confined to the gaming hells of Lisbon and Madrid, the gambling clubs of Paris \u2014 the distinction may prove a com fort to these respective institutions, probably to the former. Well ; Garcia came to Homburg in the latter end of the sixties with drums beating and colours"], [39, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 29 flying, determined to conquer \u2014 the alternative of dying had no place in his vocabulary at the time. He looked like carrying everything before him, for in less than a fortnight he was absolutely fifty or sixty thousand pounds to the good. Of course Garcia swaggered tremendously, for two twos he would have seated himself on some magnificently decorated platform, and bidden M. Blanc and his croupiers march past him, shouting : \"Ave C\u00e6sar, morituri te salutant,\" as the gladiators of old hailed the emperors before entering the arena to die. Doubtful, however, of M. Blanc's consent to such a procession he made another proposal. Deeming a stake of twelve thousand francs (the maximum on equal chances) too petty, he asked to have it increased to sixty thousand. M. Blanc acquiesced. Next day Garcia hit upon a series, and won about five-and twenty thousand pounds. But while every one stood awestruck at so much luck, M. Blanc did not move a muscle, and made his usual tour through the rooms, as if nothing extraordinary had happened. He even stopped for a little while at the table where Garcia was waging such a terrible battle against him. The Spaniard caught sight of him. \"Well, Monsieur Blanc,\" he exclaimed, \"you do not seem to feel very comfortable. Of course, of course. But you must make up your mind to one thing ; one of us two will have to bite the dust, and I have got a notion that it will not be Senor Garcia.\""], [40, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 30 \" Monsieur Garcia,\" replied the old man quietly, lowering his spectacles to the tip of his nose, and looking the. other straight in the face ; I've got an annual income of three thousand francs invested in the French Consolidated Fund, and I am certain that you will not win that.\" Having said which, he slowly turned on his heel and left the rooms. Six weeks later Garcia was obliged to ask a loan of the bank in order to get back to Paris. M. Blanc granted it courteously, only giving Garcia a little bit of advice. \" The next time you obtain a victory, do not encamp on your position.\" It was in fact the advice of Mr. Punch : \" He that fights and runs away,\" &c, in other words. M. Blanc might have gone further still than the humpbacked sage of Fleet Street, and counselled Garcia and his like not even to fight another day, but apart from the fact that the endeavour to instil such wisdom would have been tantamount to providing a rod for his own back, M. Blanc knew that it would be absolutely so much breath wasted ! Old Papa Martin, whom I have already quoted, and who before being in M. Blanc's employ was croupier or tailleur (the latter appella tion applies to the dealer of the cards at trente et-quarante) at Frascati in Paris (the present site of the Cafe Cardinal at the angle of the Boulevard des Italiens and the Rue de Richelieu) used to tell a dozen stories, all tending to show that the gambler fatally returns to the scene of his triumphs ; that it is, not next to impossible, but utterly im-"], [41, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 31 possible for him to keep the money won at the gaming-table. \"In fact,\" Martin added; \"therein lies the strength of the bank. However much the gambler may take away with him, the bank need only consider it as a temporary loan, with the difference that it comes back minus instead of plus the interest. The most extraordinary case under my notice was that of an American who came to Frascati one night with his last ten-franc piece. He put it on the number of the cab which brought him, twenty -seven. It came out four times in ten. Then he left off and punted on another tack. Before two in the morning he had cleared two hundred and twelve thousand francs.\" \" And did he keep them ? \" asked his inter locutor. \" Yes,\" replied Martin, significantly ; \" yes, he kept them \u2014 for at least two years.\" The \" for at least two years \" of the veteran croupier is worth a whole metaphysical treatise on the irresistible fascination of the gaming table. This sketch of M. Blanc would be incomplete without a few words about the superstitions of the gambler, of his belief in omens, tokens and fetishes. Here are two of the most noteworthy ones. With the exception of the winter we saw him at Homburg, he generally spent that season at Monaco, after Lefebvre had made his concession over to him. Seeing that the former bank remained"], [42, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 32 open all the year round, he had three telegraphic despatches per day informing him of the fluctua tions in the play at the German Spa. Contrary to his custom when at Homburg and Wiesbaden, he was very seldom seen outside on the Riviera. He received his friends and visitors in a modestly furnished room, pertaining to the administration of the casino, which room he scarcely ever left. One day one of the former, having been told that he was inside, went in, having knocked first. He noticed that as he opened the door, Blanc looked rather confused, and hid something beneath a news paper. He paid no further attention, and after a few minutes' chat went out again. He had scarcely been gone a quarter of an hour when he remembered having forgotten to tell Blanc something, and this time he went in without knocking. There was no time on Blanc's part to hide \" the something \" beneath the newspaper, and \" the something \" was nothing more nor less than a pack of cards, spread out before him in rows. The friend did not understand, and asked an ex planation of another friend. \" You do not under stand what he is doing,\" said the latter. \" He is simply telling his own fortune, trying to find out whether the bank at Homburg is losing or winning, before he gets the news.\" This matchless financier, possessing millions upon millions, was simply resorting to the silly tactics of a young girl or an old concierge to see whether a fair or dark man was going to be lucky"], [43, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 33 to him, or whether he would receive money from some unexpected quarter. But the belief in the tangible fetish as productive of luck was more remarkable still. I have just now spoken of Garcia and of the issue of his combat with M. Blanc. Garcia, notwithstanding his previous swagger, took his defeat like a gentleman. Not so a certain French count, whose name I do not care to mention, seeing that I believe him still to be alive. One evening at Homburg finding himself comparatively cleaned out, he went to Blanc's private residence. \" At what time can I see M. Blanc the first thing in the morning,\" he asked of the servant. \" Not before ten, monsieur,\" replied the man. \" M. Blanc never gets up before that hour.\" \" That would be too late. I am obliged to go by the first train, and want to tell him something very important that will please him very much. I will call about half-past eight, and you must show me into his bedroom. He won't mind it, nor will I.\" \" But, monsieur,\" objected the other, \" it is posi tively more than my place is worth to do such a thing.\" \" I will make it all right with your master. Meanwhile take this.\" And he put a louis in the man's hand. Next morning a little after eight the herculean Count was shown into Blanc's bedroom. Blanc was asleep, but the sound of the intruder turning the key in the lock awoke him. Blanc looked at D"], [44, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 34 him in surprise the more that he saw the key dis appear in his pocket. \" Good morning, M. le Comte,\" said Blanc, feel ing that he must say something, seeing that the visitor had taken a chair by the foot of the bed and did not speak. \" Good morning, M. le Comte, to what do I owe the honour of this early visit ? \" \" My dear Blanc, I am in urgent want of ten thousand francs, and I have come to ask you for them.\" \" But, my dear Count, I cannot give you ten thousand francs all in a minute. You must allow me time to consider. I am not the sole master. I must speak to the Board. Let me see you again in the course of the day.\" \" I am very sorry, my dear Blanc, that I cannot give you as much as an hour, let alone part of the day. Your writing-table is in this corner, you have only to take the amount from it. Will you or won't you.\" \" I am very sorry, but I can't.' \" Very well, I won't force you to do a thing you don't like.\" Saying which he rose from his seat, took a tremendous nail and a small hammer from his pocket and began to knock the former into the wall, slowly and perfectly unconcerned. Blanc got frightened. \" What are you doing, Count ? I beg you to go or else I'll call my servant.\" \"You try, my dear Blanc ; at the very first move ment or sound, I pledge you my word that I'll"], [45, "We Two at Monte-Carlo 35 strangle you before they can break the door open.\" \" But what are you doing ? \" The count went on hammering. \" What am I doing? I am knocking in a nail to hang you by.\" Blanc sat up in bed, this time thoroughly fright ened. \" Will you give me the ten thousand francs ? No ; very well.\" And he went on hammering with the greatest unconcern. \" Your behaviour is simply contemptible, Count \" ventured Blanc. \"I suppose it isj\" replied the other, giving a final knock to the nail and testing its solidity. \" Now we are ready.\" Blanc saw that he meant what he said. He jumped out of bed, opened his writing-table and gave him a bundle of notes. \" Here's the money, monsieur, but you had better make yourself scarce, because ...\" The Count burst out laughing. \" You might have saved yourself that advice. Well, good-bye, and don't be vindictive.\" With this he opened the door and disappeared. Half an hour later he was on his way to Frankfort. One would have thought that Blanc would not have let him leave the house without raising a hue and cry, but the door had scarcely closed behind the Count when a sudden idea struck his victim. That nail would surely bring luck, and thinking of D 2 4"], [46, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 36 nothing else but to get possession of it, he jumped on a chair and pulled at it with all his might until he did get it. That very day, to the great surprise of every one, Blanc took a regular seat at the trente et-quarante table. People noticed that he was fingering a large new nail all the while. When he rose he was the winner of between thirty and forty thousand francs. But as he was determined not to gamble in that way he offered to sell the fetish for the price it originally cost him. Intending purchasers wanted to know the story connected with it, but he refused to reveal his own humiliation. So the nail was kept to the end of his days. I have got the story from the servant, who was dismissed for having let the Count get an entrance into his master's bed room, and who afterwards became a famous punter like Dick Bourchier, the Earl of Mulgrave's foot man, in the reign of William III. I think I was right in saying that Francois Blanc was a desperate gambler."], [47, "CHAPTER III. I am told part of the secret \u2014 Frank's dream. WE had been away for nearly a week, and at Nice for four days, and still I had no inkling as to the nature of Frank's secret. At times I felt in clined to ask myself whether there was a secret at all, because if there was he bore the burden of it with remarkable fortitude and cheerfulness. But there was the money. How had he become possessed of that ? Borrowed it. On what security? \"On his simple note of hand,\" as the advertisements and circulars of the money-lenders say. I knew better. I had tried it more than once and failed. Frank was not a whit better situated than myself with regard to the worth of his own signature \u2014 from the money-lender's point of view. Besides, 'though my junior by fifteen years or so, Frank was not exactly a young man, and if he had wanted to resort to such practices in order to go to Monte-Carlo he could, and would have done so long ago ; at any rate, he would have tried. But though fond of travelling, he had always professed a profound indifference for the Riviera. \"The Riviera is but the fashion's"], [48, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 38 stamp, Monte-Carlo is the spot for all that,\" he had said ; \" and Monte-Carlo means gambling, and candidly speaking, I don't care for gambling.\" And all at once he had changed, though even now he did not seem anxious to proceed beyond Nice. \" Time enough when the Carnival is over, to lose or win our pile,\" he remarked. The tone of his words, however, coupled with his somewhat lavish way of spending proved to me that he not only meant winning, but was certain of winning. I repeat, I could not make it out. Frank and I had met with several friends and acquaintances, and life passed very pleasantly. Frank had taken a great liking to Count Barsowsky, who had introduced us to the \" Cercle de la M^diterranee,\" where high play was going on, but not roulette, and Frank had evidently made up his mind to risk no money except on the latter game. This much he said, but no more when invited to play baccara. Frank is an early riser. He still believes in part of the mendacious old saw; I don't. I lived for some years in a purely agricultural district where they went to bed with the fowls and got up with the lark. Ninety-nine per cent, of the population were about as ignorant as if they had been blessed with a board school in their midst for years, as poor as Job, and racked with gout, rheumatism and so forth ; the squire was a pompous idiot, the parson a prig, both had all their work to do to keep the wolf from the door, and were always going up to town"], [49, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 39 to see their physician ; the only rational people in the place and well-to-do besides, were the doctor and the lawyer who used to sit up till far into the night over their toddy, and used to lie abed till a reasonable hour. I forgot ; there were a couple of rural constables on horseback, thorough sensible and healthy fellows, who as a rule began their night's work at 9 p.m. and finished' at 6 a.m. If there be one thing I dislike more than the idea of going to bed, it is that of getting up, so Frank was always dressed and astir while I was sleeping away, as if paid by the hour. The fourth morning after our arrival proved, however, an exception. He had been out late with Barsowsky and a Major Castergell, a friend of his father ; I was taken with an alarming fit of sleeplessness just after ten in the morning, against which I felt it impossible to contend, so I made the best of a wasted night and got into my clothes. Frank not having put in an appearance by then, I went into his room, which was next to mine. It was the first time I did so since we started. He was fast asleep, but on his coverlet lay a collection of books whose sight took the breath out of me. There were about six or seven yellow-covered, stitched pamphlets, dream-books every one of them. Why in the name of all that was good were they there ? I left the room on tiptoe, and puzzled and puzzled till I could puzzle no longer. I smoked ever so many cigarettes in the garden of the Grand Hotel, but could not get"], [50, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 40 nearer the solution. In about an hour Frank came down, bright and cheerful as usual ; but I must have looked the reverse, for he remarked upon it. \" Anything the matter, old fellow ? \" he asked. \" You don't seem yourself this morning. No bad news, I hope ? \" \" No ! I'll tell you all about it after breakfast.\" \" That's right. Don't spoil my appetite and yours if it's anything disagreeable ; \" laughed Frank. \"You know the answer of Clearchus, the disciple of Aristotle, when the Persian envoys asked him to intercede with the Greeks for an armistice. It is quoted by Xenophon. ' It is no use talking to the Greeks about armistices without first offering them a jolly good breakfast.' I don't know that Clearchus made use of the word 'jolly,' but I am sure that he and the Greeks were very clever fellows.\" I did not give Frank much respite. He had barely swallowed his last mouthful of food, when I took him by the arm and led him downstairs. When I got him outside, I went straight to the mark. \" What are those dream-books for, you have got in your room ?\" I said. \" Those dream-books ; \" echoed Frank, trying to look unconcerned. \" Well, I suppose they are to explain dreams.\" \" Whose dreams ? \" \"Anybody's dreams.\""], [51, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 41 \" That won't do. There is something behind all this, Frank, and I shall not stir before you have told me.\" \" Then you had better sit down, for the story is a long one, and seeing that you will know, I had better make a clean breast of it. We are both here in obedience to a dream.\" I looked at Frank, but did not say a word, and we sat down in the garden. \"You remember,\" he went on, \"the Tuesday afternoon before we started, when I left you at Piccadilly Circus?\" I nodded my head. \" I strolled up Regent Street with no more idea of going to Monte-Carlo than of going to Kam schatka ; in fact thinking of nothing in particular, when, just after passing Beak1 Street, I caught sight of the prettiest pair of feet I have ever seen in my life. The feet made me want to see the head, for I have often observed that girls do not shine at both ends at the same time, so I walked a little quicker to get a side glance at the face.\" \" Complimentary to Miss Martha Crimson,\" I said in a kind of grumble. \" Well, it isn't,\" replied Frank ; \" though I am bound to admit that Martha's head is as pretty as her feet, and I don't mind telling you that I should be very wretched if I thought that she was not going to be my wife ; still I am bound to admit that the idea of marrying her with Lady Crimson"], [52, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 42 thrown into the bargain makes me almost equally wretched.\" \" In real life a man does not marry his mother in-law, especially if his mother-in-law be only a stepmother. That is all very well in adaptations of plays from the French. In England that kind of mother-in-law does not exist.\" \"That's all you know about it,\" said Frank; \" but let us return for a moment to Regent Street and to the girl whose face I wanted to see. She was stepping out briskly, the pavement was absolutely crowded, and without being downright rude there was not the smallest chance of getting my wish. That, of course, was out of the question. A pretty woman in the street has been compared to a picture in a gallery, at whom every one has the right to look. I for one do not hold that opinion ; I certainly quickened my pace also, but was just giving it up as a bad job when she suddenly stopped at Louise, the milliner's. I was just as badly off as before, because I could not go and stare at the bonnets, so I pulled up a bit and had got as far as Cremer's toyshop, when behold, impeding my progress, there appeared in the middle of the footway Lady Crimson and Martha. They were looking for a four-wheeler, because among other items Lady Crimson thinks hansoms fast. At that moment there was not a single growler in sight. They did not go to the edge of the pavement like sensible beings and wait there ; they kept standing in the middle of it, not side by side, but each front-"], [53, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 43 ing a different way so that there was no possibility of my passing unperceived. I did not want to be seen. I had had such a dose of Lady Crimson on the Sunday that I told Martha in the evening that I was going home for three or four days. I made myself as small as possible, and managed to sidle into Cremer's. I knew I was safe there. But for the life of me I did not know what to ask for when I got inside. I was aware that it had to be some thing that took time to select and to discuss, for they might remain in the position they had taken up for ever so long, and I did not dare put my head outside to reconnoitre. The straw I clutched at like a drowning man was a roulette-board, it was the first thing that caught my eye. I pretended to be very anxious to have everything explained to me ; a male attendant, or perhaps it was Mr. Cremer himself, undertook the task, unfolding the cloth on a counter, showing me how to spin the ball, &c, &c, and after half an hour of careful coaching I left the shop minus several sovereigns and plus a gambling instrument for which I had not the slightest use. The coast was perfectly clear by then, so I walked away with a parcel, the weight of which fairly made me stagger. I was determined to spend no more money, and I man fully trudged up Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, grudging even the penny that would have landed me at Ampthill Square with my load. But \"when I got opposite Shoolbred's I could go no further, my legs bent under me. A hansom"], [54, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 44 came rattling up, and not noticing that there was any one in it, I hailed it. ' Is this Luck's Wedding Cake shop ? ' I heard a sweet voice say from the inside, and before I had time to look round whether it was Luck's Wedding Cake shop, the girl with the pretty feet, who had caused the purchase of the roulette-board, stepped out of the cab. \" ' May I have the cab to send a parcel home ? ' I asked, for I made up my mind there and then to go into Luck's too. \" ' Oh, yes ; I shall not want it any more,' she said with a charming smile. \" To take the man's number, to give him the ad dress and a shilling was the work of a moment, then I went in after her. The place was very full,. neither of us could find a seat, but at last we were accommodated at a small table in a corner opposite one another. The waitress evidently took it for granted that we were together, and I took care not to undeceive her.\" I had sat listening very quietly, wondering what all this had to do with Frank's journey to Monte- Carlo. Seeing which, Frank said, \u2014 \" I told you it was a long story, but I am coming to it.\" Then he waxed eloquent. \"My dear boy, if ever a head matched a pair of feet, it was that girl's. She was unmistakably a lady, and my apology for sitting down at the same table was answered in a winning way : ' I don't mind it in the least.' Then we fell to chatting in quite a friendly way, and in the course of the conversation"], [55, "45 We Two at Monte-Carlo. I learnt that she had come to order a wedding cake which was to be sent to Monte-Carlo by the ioth of March, to the address of Mr. Smith, the banker. Would you believe it,\" added Frank apologetically, \" I had not the courage to ask her whether it was for her own marriage, though I found out quite casually that she would be there.\" This time I stared Frank straight in the face, but before I could put the question which was on my lips, he forestalled me. \" I know what you are going to say. I am en gaged to Martha Crimson, and I am head over ears in love with a girl whose name I do not even know. Let me tell you that I am not. I am head over ears in love with Martha Crimson, but unless I can get rid of Lady Crimson, I shall not marry her ; at any rate, not yet awhile. But if polygamy were permissible in England I should like to begin by marrying both girls ! \" he added ruefully. I burst out laughing. \" But that is not to the point,\" went on Frank. \" Of one thing you may be certain, that I did not come as far as this in pursuit of the girl, who for all I know may be a married woman, or may have been ordering her own wedding cake, though as a rule people do not do that, any more than they compose their own epitaph. I am going to Monte- Carlo in obedience to a dream which I dreamt the night after I met the girl, after I bought the rou lette-board.\""], [56, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 46 \" You do not mean to tell me that you are super stitious enough to believe in a dream ? \" I said. \"I mean to tell you that I am superstitious enough for that, and so would you be, if you found the first part of the dream realized before you opened your eyes next morning.\" This time I became all attention. \" I could no more give you an exact description of the principal scene, or rather of the series of scenes of which the dream was composed than I could fly. There was a church, the ' rose windows ' of which were composed of roulette-boards. It was not a Protestant church, nor a Catholic one ; the bride and bridegroom were not Martha and myself, though I was there and Lady Crimson, coming out of a mist and the girl I met. Like Von Munchausen, I saw people's words issue from their lips and take shape in the air ; there was, however, but one word on all their lips, ' Luck,' ' luck,' and nothing but ' luck.' The bride and bridegroom, whom curiously enough I seemed to see through a mist also, were being pelted with gold pieces instead of flowers ; it was a strange jumble altogether, its scenes shifting like revolving views, but the last, the very last was as clear and distinct as a well-painted picture. It was I and Martha, returning from our wedding tour, and being welcomed to our new home by my father and mother, and, thank God, Lady Crimson was not there.\" \" The ' luck ' and the ' roulette-board ' are easily explained,\" I remarked."], [57, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. \u25a017 \" I know, and I attach not the slightest import ance to them, or at any rate I should not but for what happened on the Wednesday morning before I was out of bed.

That is why I put down my pen for a little while. Extract from Frank's Articles. Monte-Carlo, February, 1889. Almost every civilized country owes the prosper ity, the grandeur it enjoys, to the industry \u2014 if not to the virtue \u2014 of its inhabitants ; Monaco owes its material welfare and such reputation as it happens to boast, to the supposed vices of other nations. The natives, though their appearance fails to remind one of the lilies of the field, are in one respect like them, insomuch that they neither toil nor spin. Why should they ? They have to pay E 2"], [62, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 52 neither rates nor taxes ; they have a capital free hospital in case they are too ill to bear the fatigue of lying idle and supine in the sun ; there are four or five doctors who attend absolutely gra tuitously to their less serious ailments in the shape of wounds and bruises contracted in their engage ments with their spouses or horses \u2014 generally with the latter. In fact, the turbulent element in the principality is chiefly made up of the equine species, though it is scarcely fair to tax any animal, whether human or otherwise, with turbulence when its chief aim seems to be rest. And the struggle between capital and labour, as represented here by the horse and its master, appears to the outsider like a paradox, seeing that the latter insists upon progress and the former upon more than old-fashioned Tory-like immobility. The Monagasquan youth is exceedingly well looked after in the matter of education, which of course is entirely eleemosynary and confided to a congregation of Jesuit brothers, who deservedly enjoy a great reputation in that respect. Their scholastic establishment stands in the old town of Monaco, on a rock overlooking the Bay of Her cules. I do not know whether the higher curricu lum includes mathematics and algebra, and perhaps a \" Theory of Chances,\" according to Huyghens, Pascal, Moivre and others. I doubt, however, whether the latter works form part of their studies, because the knowledge gained from them would be utterly useless. No subject of Prince Charles, or"], [63, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 53 of his successors, not even a resident tradesman, though a foreigner, is or will be allowed to enter the gaming-rooms. The prohibition nominally extends to the inhabitants of the Departement of the Alpes Maritimes, in which departement Nice is situated, but seeing that Molicre wrote : \" There is always a means of arranging matters with heaven,\" it would be surprising indeed if the other power proved less amenable. Consequently, members of the various clubs established at Nice, Mentone and elsewhere are exempt from this pro- hibition. The argument on which this decision is based is calculated to puzzle one a bit ; but only at first. It is an open secret that every club in France is only a gaming-house under another name. The most conversational nation in Europe, the most sociable one \u2014 reputedly \u2014 is the least clubbable, as we understand the term. Prince Charles, who has not his equal for an eye to the main chance, probably thought that he might just as well have his part of the profits accruing from the mania for gambling ; that, as people played in Nice, they might just as well come to play at Monte-Carlo, so the regulations were framed accordingly. It is virtually the theory enunciated by Carlyle : \" If people are bent upon going to hell, let us provide them with an express train.\" The express train is a pure metaphor as far as the conveyance from Nice to Monte-Carlo is concerned, for nothing could be slower, not even a suburban express on the South-Eastern, which is saying a good deal."], [64, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 54 Still, one gets therein time, and it is then and then only that one fully understands the magnetism that attracts so many thousands thither every year. Saint-Bernard appears to have passed Monaco in the first half of the twelfth century, forLremember that in one of his letters he calls it Veris speculum \" Spring's Mirror.\" It is many years since I read \"The Lives of the Saints,\" and my memory may play me false, but there is, as far as I can recollect, no mention of a gaming-table then, so we may take it for granted that the Abbot of Clairvaux had no opportunity of punting, let alone of losing any money. People who do are not quite so en thusiastic about the beauties of the landscape after wards, so I thought I would speak about it before I have had my temper tried in that way. Monte- Carlo is the bourne whence no traveller returns \u2014 in the same mind as he went. It is not the fault of Monte-Carlo itself. To paraphrase two lines of Blake's \"Songs of Expe rience,\" \" They built a hell in heaven's despite.\" \" It is a heaven in hell's despair.\" And both heaven and hell are very attractive. It is doubt ful whether, with regard to the former, that King of Portugal who opined that he could have given the Creator a hint or two, if He had consulted him, could have suggested any improvement. There is probably no spot on earth so naturally picturesque. Neither the painter of the realistic school nor that of the idealistic one could detract from or add to the irresistible charm of it. A Ruysdael would have to fling his sobriety to the winds when dealing with"], [65, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 55 the atmosphere ; a Turner would find his art power less to heighten the effect. Nay more. While the latter's \" Covent Garden \" was still on the easel, he invited a lady to come and see it. \"It's no doubt very lovely, Mr. Turner,\" quoth she ; \" nevertheless I have been to Covent Garden, and I cannot see it as you do.\" \" Don't you wish you could, madam ? \" came the answer. I am almost certain that such differential vision vanishes \u2014 temporarily at any rate \u2014 when face to face with nature at Monte-Carlo. Podsnap and Gadgrind become \u2014 luckily \u2014 mute Wordsworths. Even the scribes of the Tract Societies, whose im pertinent emissaries worry you here as elsewhere, are compelled to make concessions to the beauties of the place. \" It is a beautiful place truly,\" they write ; \" but so was the plain of Sodom, which was even as the garden of the Lord.\" I have made up my mind to say nothing of these pro ductions and the producers thereof. They are too impertinent ; but impertinence allied to wit or humour may lay claim to a certain measure of criticism. Their idiocy and platitudes are beneath contempt. Here is a small sample of it, and I have done. \"The Gaming Tables of Monte-Carlo.\" \"Do not go to Monte-Carlo ; or, if you are there, leave at once.\" Now I wonder whether these tracta rians, on my consenting to follow their advice \" at once,\" would have consented to refund me the price of my return ticket. I wot not."], [66, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 56 But I remain, thankful for getting for once in a way my fill of sunshine, rejoicing in the almost tropical vegetation, feasting my eyes with the sight of the aloe, the date-palm, the cedar, the pine, sniffing the breeze laden with the perfume of the orange and citron and the rose, revelling in the loveliness of the whole, and blessing the memory of Paley for having provided me with an excuse for coming and for staying in his axiom, that : \"A man who is not sometimes a fool is always one.\" It is true that as yet I have not staked a single five- franc piece. It will not be long before I do. It is impossible to resist the temptation. Talk about the magnetism of the poet's eye in fine frenzy rolling. What is the poet's eyeball compared to the ivory roulette-ball spinning, and spinning, and rolling with half a thousand eyes hanging upon its movements ? Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing. The poet may go and hide his dimin ished eye. We have been here three days, and I have not stirred from the irregular quadrangle, one side of which is occupied by the Hotel de Paris, the other by the\" Cercle des Etrangers,\" the official name of the Temple dedicated to the Goddess of Luck. Because let me remind the reader that the successors of the lateM. Blanc do not compel one to play. To say that one is as free in that respect as one is free not to take any refreshment at a London music-hall or prome nade concert, or to decline buying anything at a fancy bazaar, would be unfair to the administration"], [67, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 57 of the Monte-Carlo establishment. Though one has paid one's admission at the former entertain ments, waiters will worry when one looks like sitting down, and kittenish damsels will pester, whether one sits down or stands up. At Monte- Carlo, albeit that you do not pay a cent to enter, albeit that the reading and writing room and even the concert-hall be gratuitously thrown open to you, there is not a single hint thrown out. I go further still. The management of the Monte-Carlo rooms pay part of your luncheons and dinners, provided you stay at the frequently mentioned Hotel de Paris, and they ask for .nothing in return. I ex plain. The Company allow the management of the hotel a franc for every person who sits down to a luncheon at the table-d'hote, two francs to every person who sits down to dinner. Liberality could assuredly no further go. Of course I hear people remark about a sprat to catch a herring. There have been herrings that swallowed the sprat, and not been caught for all that. The courtesy of the officials is simply astonish ing considering how near they are to France, if they be not Frenchmen themselves. The Com missary of Police, before whom you are bound to present yourself to get your ticket, must be an angel of patience. He is chaffed out of his wits, mostly by funny Frenchmen. \" Have you no other documents, monsieur, to prove your identity ? \" he asked one who merely tendered his card. \" No, monsieur,\" replied the other. \"Your"], [68, "58 We Two at Monte- Carlo. permis de ckasse, perhaps,\" came the remark. \" Je ne chasse que les femntes, monsieur,\" came the answer. It was very clever, but it was a piece of impertinence which the Commissary, who is decidedly a gentleman, had to put up with. Your ticket once delivered to you \u2014 for a week, a month or a day as the case may be \u2014 you are free to roam wherever you like, provided you leave your stick or umbrella at the cloak-room in the hall. Most people leave their overcoats and hats, that is, when they mean business, for the latter especially are inconvenient when wanting to get near the tables, because, I am sorry to say, the courtesy and good temper of the officials is not contagious as far as the majority of the visitors are concerned. The rooms and the grand hall are no doubt very gorgeously decorated, but beyond the fact of the Moorish style apparenly prevailing in both, I cannot tell you much. Those curious in these matters had better consult \" Baedeker \" or \" Murray.\" I have got a notion that both these respective publishers would sell the stock of publications referring to Monaco very cheap, for, unless I am mistaken, there cannot be a good demand for them. At any rate since I have been here I have not seen a single individual with one of them. As a rule the Briton or American on his travels conscientiously consults his guide-book, perhaps to see that no one of the momuments or sites or public buildings mentioned therein arc missing. I am open to lay a wager that not one of every"], [69, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 59 thousand visitors who come here yearly have been to old Monaco ; that not one will be able to tell the colour or the decorations of the walls inside the Casino. They might, if they had looked, but they never did. They never give these things a thought. They go straight to the tables, even if they do not play, and stare at the little ball spinning, at the piles of gold and silver pieces placed on the thirty-six or thirty-seven numbers, for zero is not barred, divided into columns and sections, and when they are tired they sit down for a little while on the plush-covered seats around the walls, chatting or dreaming to the chinking of the money, to the rattling of the little ball, which never ceases rattling from II a.m. till n p.m. all the year round. They, the non-players, are just as interesting a study as the players. When the tract-mongers compare Monte-Carlo to the garden of the Lord, they little dream how near the mark they are with regard to the mental nudity of the temporary inhabitants. Adam and Eve were not half so nude physically as they the inhabitants are with regard to their thoughts, which one may absolutely read on their faces without the aid of spectacles. So far Frank for the present. Though I did not see the above communication until many months afterwards, I am bound to confess that in the beginning, at any rate, the sobriety of his con duct was not at variance with the tone of his writings. It was perfectly true that we had been"], [70, "60 We Two at Monte-Carlo. at Monte-Carlo three days, and that as yet he had not staked a five-franc piece. Like a good general he was calmly surveying the field before going into battle. I am sorry to say I had not been equally cool-headed, though the results of my impetuousness had by no means been disastrous. In less than two hours after our arrival I had won 700 fr. I had staked on the date of our departure from London, sixteen ; on the number of my room at Nice, thirty-three ; on the date of our arrival at Monte-Carlo twenty-five ; on the number of my room at the Hotel de Paris, which happened to be in a dark corridor on the ground floor, seven. In every case it had come up, and I was 28/. to the good. If instead of venturing 5 fr. each time I had had pluck enough to put the maximum allowed on a single number, viz. nine louis (180 fr.) I should have been the possessor of 1000/. I have often to work for two years before earning such a sum, and all the cant notwithstanding, about the satisfaction, the consciousness of having earned it honestly and by my industry, I do not think that the sight of it would give me more pleasure than the sight of a thousand sovereigns pocketed at one swoop, even if in the other case I could rejoice my orbs with the spectacle, which I cannot, seeing that before I finger the last fifty, the previous nine hundred and fifty pounds are spent. The gambler's superstition had fully got hold of me by this time. I firmly believe that from the moment I heard the sequel to Frank's dream in"], [71, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 61 the shape of the legacy of Miss Dorothy Crawford, I considered myself not only the instrument of realizing that dream, but for my own benefit. Frank said as much laughing. \" You are in a bad way, old fellow,\" he remarked. \" Remember that I did not even catch a glimpse of you in my vision. Then how can you participate in the realization ?\" Logically, if logic had anything to do with all this, the question was a settler, but I would not look upon it in that way, so I continued to live in a fool's paradise."], [72, "CHAPTER V.

The next two days were scarcely calculated to dispel my illusions, seeing that I increased my winnings by about 50/., though at no time had I staked more than five francs on a number or ten on a column or a dozen. I have made it a habit never to play on the colours. The game, if you are a small punter without much pluck, is not worth the candle. For, in despite of my hallucination, I remained what I have always been, a small and careful punter, and, as I have already observed, I began to cal culate how long it would take me to realize the small fortune that I had dreamt of. I found that it would want about eighteen months, provided the luck j continued, to realize an income of five hundred a year, but I also became conscious that by that time I should have been working for the proprietor of some private lunatic asylum ; so I went to the English banker, asked him for a cheque for 75/., despatched it to London by the afternoon mail of the third day, and thanked my stars for having escaped from \" the valley of mad ness.\""], [73, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 63 The following may be accepted as a general maxim. Roulette being the most fascinating of all games of chance by reason of the multiplicity of its combinations, it absolutely gains upon a man to a degree such that nine out of every ten players may be said to suffer from incipient lunacy. It is, in fact, difficult to believe that you are among sane people when seeing a hundred or two well-dressed men and women rush up the heights from the railway station to the casino. Yet these people in the ordinary circumstances of life are intelligent enough ; but in the constant struggle against an enemy who perpetually eludes their grasp, who they know, though they will not admit it, will finally conquer them, they lose their reason, their minds revolt against proofs positive, and they say and do things which would simply make the head physician of Bedlam stand aghast. But the chances are ten to one that this same physician would become as mad as his patients if he himself were to play for any length of time ; that in the end he would endeavour to purloin the gold-topped smelling-bottle, containing a live beetle or something of the kind, with which that Italian Marchioness is toying, and without which fetish she would not stake a red cent. She is staying at Cannes, a friend of mine who has been here for a fortnight, told me. It takes an hour and a half from Monte-Carlo to the latter place. The other day, on reaching the rooms, she finds on opening her bag that her maid has forgotten to put said"], [74, "64 We Two at Monte-Carlo. bottle into it. She takes the next train back, returns by the next, and finally on leaving off at night wins 240 fr. She's worth something like 40,000/. a year, the proceeds of vineyards. When at home she's too indolent to stir a step. She has had six hours' railway journey in one day for the sake of potting less than two hours' income, not to mention the railway fares and the fatigue of being hoisted up to the Prince of Wales' Hotel at Cannes in a shandredan. \" She who scarcely puts her foot to the ground when in Rome, absolutely flew up the slope when coming back,\" added my informant. Nevertheless she neither | budges nor winces, however severe her losses may be, and she is con sequently a greater object of curiosity to me even than that Russian grand seigneur who invariably throws up the game after twenty minutes of bad luck. Had I the space at my disposal, I would devote a whole chapter to him. From what Count Barsowsky told me once, the story of his life would prove interesting ; as it is, I must confine myself to a few main facts. They are absolutely authentic, though little known outside the circle of Russian society. As he sits there with io.oco/. arranged in piles of twenty louis before him, his magnificent white head towering above every other, he looks the perfection of the patrician. At the first glance it strikes one that no amount of scratching would lay bare the Tartar beneath, but at the first glance only. The error arises, first, from the veneer being of a"], [75, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 65 much superior quality; secondly, from the suc cessive coats of it having been laid on much thicker than usual. Yet this accomplished man of the world, this charming courtier, this Lauzun and Chesterfield in one, gambled away his wife. Gambled her away, not figuratively, but literally. It happened in the days of Nicholas I., and shortly before the Crimean War, when the now sexagenarian was an officer in the Guards. The winner, who had been in love with the lady previous to her marriage, was supposed to have encompassed the ruin of his successful rival, who in less than two years gambled away an immense fortune, and two or three estates, then he ventured his last stake. The wife, indignant at the hus band's want of heart \u2014 she called it want of love \u2014 acquiesced in the arrangement. The reader may know that in Russia a divorce can be obtained by mutual consent, butwhatthe reader in all probability does not know, is that as long as a man confines his divorces to half-a-dozen, he is still considered an excellent Christian. After that he is looked upon as not having exercised the Christian virtues of forbearance and constancy. \" Excuses du peu\" as our neighbours across the Channel would say. When the Crimean War broke out, our erstwhile Benedick was almost penniless, and conscience stricken besides, for he happened to love the woman he had gambled away, by whom he had a daughter whom he loved still more. He courted death on the battle-field, not once, but a score of F"], [76, "66 We Two at Monte-Carlo. times ; he did not get so much as a scratch, but an uncle and two or three cousins lost their lives, and when Sebastopol surrendered he found himself twice as rich as he had been at starting. He offered to redeem the wife he had put away, he offered to play for her at four times the stake for which he had lost her, the offer was declined. He never married again. But he gambles with a portrait of the wife and daughter before him, to remind him of the crime of his youth ; and when things look like going wrong, he beckcns a servant, who is always in attendance, the gold is put away in a leathern bag, our magnate takes a turn outside, a cigarette and a bottle of Bass's pale ale. If the liquor poured out by himself with all due care\u2014 he never allows a waiter to touch it, nor to uncork it \u2014 if the liquor poured out is ever so little cloudy, he plays no more for that day. Signora Palavero whose husband, though com paratively young, occupies the chair of moral philosophy at one of the Italian Universities, and to whom I told the tale, was inexpressibly shocked at its immorality. I did not mean to shock her, I meant to console her, for she had just lost her little boy, an only child. I meant gently to convey that after all it was better to lose one's nearest and dearest through death, than to see them bartered or gamed away for gold. \"You are right,\" said the signor, \"for in the first case their memory remains sacred. I am perhaps a gambler, but I could not have staked"], [77, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 67 my wife and child on the throw of the dice, or the turn of the wheel.\" Then he turned to his spouse. \" Do you think I could, Mia Cara ? \" he asked. \" How can you ask me such a question ? \" said the bereaved lady, bursting into tears, and almost indignant. I must confess to having felt like Falstaff's tailor, who wanted better security than Bardolph's for the satin of the burly knight's short cloak and slops. I wanted better assurance of Palavero's scrupulous ness in that respect than even his worthy spouse's testimony. I am not generally inclined to evil thoughts with regard to my fellow-men, but my first meeting with Palavero five or six days previous to the con versation recorded, justified my want of faith. I had not seen him for a couple of years. I was standing watching very intently the man\u0153uvres of another temporary lunatic, an American this time, who, after flinging a 500 fr. note on the red or black, rushed away half a dozen yards, putting both hands to his ears, in order not to hear the colour called out, but keeping an eye on his stake for all that \u2014 I was watching that Yankee with all my might, when I felt a hand laid gently on my shoulder. I turned round and saw Palavero standing by my side. I noticed at once that he was in deep mourning, and that he looked very sad. \"Ah, my dear friend, I am delighted to see you 1 \" F 2"], [78, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 68 \" So am I, my dear Palavero, but what brings you here at this time of the year ? \" \" Don't talk of it, friend, we have had a terrible misfortune, we have lost our only child, a darling boy, his mother's only joy.\" \" I am truly sorry to hear this. And how is Madame Palavero ? \" \" Of course, you may imagine how she is. She talked of never going out any more, of shutting herself up. But I prevailed upon her to come here for a month or so.

I had no doubt about the thirty, that was the middle number. As a rule I consult the wife when I am in doubt upon anything. But in this case, you understand, the wound was still bleeding, so I tried to keep my perplexity to myself. But seeing me so preoccupied, she wanted to know.

' My poor angel's age first,' she said, choking with sobs.\" \" And you did as she told you ? \" I asked, keep ing my countenance as well as I could. \"Yes, and they came up as if the poor darling had directed the ball from heaven. I was almost heartbroken after I had done it. I was sitting behind the croupier, and I told him what he had done. It did not seem to affect him in the least.\" Saying which, tears, and I am certain they were honest tears, started to Palavero 's eyes, for I am sure he was fond of his child, and, as he left me, he surreptitiously took out his handkerchief. I was still looking after Palavero when all of a sudden a gentleman rushed into my arms, and fell upon my neck, shouting at the top of his voice, \u2014 \" Ah, monsieur, monsieur, twenty-four blacks in succession ! I am sure the roulette is bewitched.\" I did not know him from Adam, but I let him have his embrace out. In another moment he quietly walked up to the table and put a hundred franc note on the red. It came up. \" I was sure of it,\" he said to me, pointing to my tie. \" Merci, monsieur, bien merci.\" Verily \"a mad world, my masters,\" and the attempt at method appears to be the primary cause of the madness prevalent. The red scarf which I wore that day by the merest accident had, however, unknown to me, inspired more than one player. Frank, who fought his first engagement that same morning, had"], [80, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 70 taken his cue from it. While still watching the gentleman who had so effusively confided his troubles to me in connection with the black turn ing up when he had backed the other colour, and who had at last been brought to see the error of his ways by my neckcloth, I was almost violently clutched by the arm. I expected nothing less than another maniac, and turned round somewhat impatiently, but it was Frank. He looked very pale, and could scarcely speak. \" Come away, come away ! \" he gasped. \" Come away, or I shall yell. I have been playing.\" I made sure he had lost all his money, which would not have affected me very much, seeing that in expectation of such a calamity, I had settled our hotel bill every night, and that we had our return tickets in our pockets. Still, I followed him, without saying a word, out of the rooms into the large open hall, where he sank down upon one of the couches. He gave me no time to inquire. \" See what I have done,\" he said, pulling his handkerchief from his jacket pocket, and opening it. It contained, besides a great deal of gold, four notes of 500 fr. each. \" This is the result of one louis.\" I confess to having drawn a sigh of relief, but I failed to understand the cause of Frank's excite ment.

My poor Frank was catching the contagion. \" What was the matter with the roulette-wheel ? \" I said. \" The matter with it,\" he exclaimed. \" It turned up red nineteen times in succession, and I should think that with the exception of myself every one must have lost. The bank must have raked in a few thousand pounds at least. When I rushed away it was still at the red.\" \"But that kind of thing often happens,\" I said, not wishing to increase his evident agitation. \" Of course it does, but that I should have known of it,\" he answered. \" How did you know of it ? \" \"You came down this morning in that tie,\" pointing to my neck. ' It is Martha's birthday to-day. She is twenty-two. I had made up my mind to play to-day. I was casting about for some sign when I saw you come down the stairs, and at the same time a porter from the hotel put a letter in my hand, forwarded from Paris. It is from Martha, but I have not read it yet. That was enough for me, and it was on that I played.\""], [82, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 72 \" But the red only came up nineteen times according to your own statement, so there can't be much in that,\" I objected, trying to talk him out of his strange faith. \" I made no such statement, by boy,\" was the answer in a despondent rather than elated tone. \" I told you it had come up nineteen times when I ran away frightened at my own luck. Let us go back and see whether there was really anything in it.\" I thought it better not to thwart him, knowing full well that if I did not go he would maintain to the last that the red had come up twenty-two times. There was an estimable baker's widow who married her foreman, and who swore that her first husband appeared every night to her in his Sunday clothes. The second spouse simply sold the suit for what it would fetch, and the nocturnal visits of number one came to an end. So we went into the room once more. The table at which Frank had played was at the far end, between the two trente et quarante tables. I edged my way to behind the croupier, where there generally sits a colleague either to replace him or to lend a hand in a difficulty. \" How much was that series of the red just now, monsieur ? \" I asked. \" Twenty-two, monsieur,\" was the answer. \" I have not seen such a thing for at least six months.\" Frank had heard what he said, but neither of us"], [83, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 73 made any comment, and we lest the room in silence. After the lapse of a twelvemonth, all this seems very absurd, but at the time Frank and I were inclined to take the matter somewhat tragically. There is no doubt that we were both more or less influenced by his dream. Our boasted nine teenth century civilization contains a good deal of paganism, but we have a different name for it. The modern Pagan, when assailed by doubts, does not, however, consult an oracle. If a female, she has a cup of tea ; if a male, he has a cigarette or a pipe and a drink. That was the remedy I suggested, so we sat down outside the Cafe de Paris. \" The red is likely to make you, Frank,\" I observed, after a few minutes, during which he had been reading Miss Crimson's letter. \" Or break me if a particular shade of it inter feres,\" he said quietly, holding out the document to me. \" Just cast your eye over this.\" I give the page of it immediately concerning my story textually. \" Elder Hall, Stamford Hill, N. \" Sunday night. \" My dear Frank, \" Thank you very much for your good wishes on my forthcoming birthday, also for the books, which came last night, so that I have scarcely had time to look at anything but their outsides.

So I went into partnership with him to the tune of 2000 marks. A hundred pounds will not break me, still I should not like to lose them. Before I left that day he had made the hundred into a hundred and fifty. I suggested taking my share of the first day's profits, but he said we had better put it in the common stock.

As luck would have it, the second day the telegram fell into her own hands, and then there was a devil of a scene, for she said it was no use trying to make her think that a woman could arrive from Germany two days in succession.

Years ago, at Wiesbaden, I saw a Cambridge wrangler amongst them who had absolutely never gambled away a pound of his own. When of age, he came into about 300/. a year. He had it when I saw him ; he had it when he died ; and more than that, because for the last forty years of his life he had never spent a farthing of it. It had accumulated, and went to a nephew. He had simply thought out a system, and went about experimenting for others, taking a small percentage of the profits, not sharing the losses. The professor settles at Monaco as he used to settle at Homburg and WTiesbaden ; but they are not all so honest as the former Cambridge student. Some of the money entrusted to them sticks to their fingers. They always change the notes handed to them at once into gold, which they put into a heap before them, and when they have done, apart from the acknowledged results, a dozen louis have found their way into their waistcoat pockets. The trick is simple enough. Their pencil on its way to and fro carries a louis with it, or else it is the snuff-box. That is their gain, what ever happens. That is what they live upon ; and when one knows the way, life at Monaco and Condamine is cheap enough.

And seeing that the latter pay neither rates nor taxes, that such rooms as they have at their disposal would not meet the requirements of visitors, they have them for a mere song. So they live modestly, and manage to save money. Formerly, in the halcyon Wiesbaden and Horn burg days, they used to operate upon a grander scale, risking some of their own funds, though not in play. They travelled about to the fashionable watering-places, staying at the best hotels, as does the quasi-swell, who is nothing more than the tout for some St. James's Street money-lender, does now-a-days. There was a great deal more false pretence about their tactics than there is now. They were supposed to have just returned from the gaming-tables, where, of course, they had won a pot of money, and equally, of course, by a system. The young fledgling or the middle-aged gull fell into the trap. He, the professor, went back with him just for friendship sake. At some of the smaller gaming-tables of Germany, and, I believe, even during the Benazet regime at Homburg and Wiesbaden, he had a kind of commission. I cannot say how it was calculated ; perhaps it was a lump fee when he brought a stranger. The reader must not infer from this that there was any cheating.

I shall deal with him presently. I must first introduce his master, Kleber, as he was called from his likeness to Bonaparte's general. No one ever knew his real name. He suddenly disappeared from the scene, and was supposed to have married an Italian countess, for whom he had won close upon thirty thousand pounds. He would never allow her to touch another card, and report has it that he threatened to put her into a lunatic asylum if she as much as attempted to go to Homburg or Wies baden. That particular story I give for what it is worth ; for the other I can absolutely vouch, though it is much stranger than the first. It is well known, though it may be new to the reader It is ancient history, because Kleber flourished in the forties ; still, it is worth telling. Railways were scarce, and one night, close to the Bavarian frontier, Kleber had to seek shelter at a vicarage. The priest, a simple-minded creature, if ever there was one, quite fascinated by the jovial guest, confided his troubles to him. The holy man's sole ambition in life was to have a splendid steeple to his otherwise homely church. But it would cost at least fifty thousand francs, and notwithstanding his many efforts for long, long years, notwithstanding his appeals for help, he had only managed to scrape half of the sum together. The surrounding country was a poor one, and the few wealthy proprietors were so"], [97, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 87 lukewarm with regard to the glory of the Highest. Kleber had a magnificent flash of inspiration. That steeple might be got at trente et quarante or roulette. History does not say which of the two games presented itself to his mind as the more efficacious for the purpose. Kleber had not seen the church, consequently could not determine whether a squat or a slender tower would be the more appropriate to the sacred building. Kleber was a man of imagination, and it may possibly have struck him that the mode of venture should be determined by the architectonic require ments ; for instance, that if the steeple were to be a slender one, uprising like a tall, graceful thing, it should be gambled for quickly with a few fell swoops at trente et quarante ; if, on the contrary, it was to be more stumpy, plodding at roulette might lead to the wished-for goal. At any rate, the main line of the plan of campaign was con ceived spontaneously ; the steeple might, nay should be, got at the gaming-tables. Kleber was a good Catholic, however, and in another moment the enormity of the conception, the wickedness, filled him with grief. He hesitated. . . . Not for long, though. It is on record that some fourteen or fifteen years ago, Mr. Spurgeon was reproached by various members of his flock for having been seen smoking a cigar on Sunday morning on his wray to the tabernacle. \" Perfectly"], [98, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 88 correct,\" answered the great preacher. \" I smoked that cigar to the glory of God.\" The reply silenced the qualms of conscience of his parishioners. Even in the domain of fantastic theology there is nothing new. Long before that Kleber had silenced his own conscience by the reply, \"A gamble to the glory of God.\" But what if the results should prove disastrous ? Kleber's soul was at peace even in that respect. He was like the Australian sheep-farmer who had given ten thousand pounds to build a church in a district where there was none. When finished, the edifice had no lightning conductors, and every farthing was spent. The builder spoke of ten pounds more. \" I shall not give another cent,'' replied the donor. \" If Providence sees fit to destroy the work erected in His honour, His will be done.\" Kleber piously and mentally exclaimed, \" If Providence sees fit to nip this thing in the bud, by making us lose the money, His will be done ! \" He, however, kept all his thoughts on the subject to himself for the moment. He laid his plans carefully, not wishing to startle his simple minded host. He was in no hurry to proceed. Next morning he professed to be so delighted with the beauty of the neighbourhood, that the ecclesi astic insisted upon his staying for a little while. Kleber reluctantly consented, attended Mass regularly, and always brought back the conversa tion to the wished-for steeple. Of course there was a means of getting it, but he dared not tell so"], [99, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 89 good, so pious a man. The latter insisted, and then the system was unfolded. Of course it was a dreadful thing to do, a wicked thing ; but did not the end justify the means, and, after all, was it not for the glory of God. He would influence no one, and least of all his worthy host. He left it to his own conscience to carefully weigh the fault to be committed against the good to be accomplished, and so forth. In a fortnight he had converted the guileless priest, who doffed his gown and shovel hat, and provided with the five and twenty thousand francs accompanied Kleber to Homburg. The steeple was to be a slender one, so Kleber decided to go in for trente et quarante. Nevertheless, he wculd play carefully. The worthy priest was allowed to speak to no one. Kleber never left his side, and proved himself as solicitous for his comforts as a mother. Kleber began the struggle, and though his composure never forsook him, those who knew him fancied that there was more than usual intensity in his mode of proceedings. A few habitues had got wind of the story, it was never known how ; but they made inquiries about the progress of the steeple, and some of the croupiers and employes averred that the good priest came every morning the moment the rooms were open to bless the various packs of cards. This may have been so much playful exaggeration on their part. Be this as it may, the steeple did not progress"], [100, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 90 apace. At the end of a fortnight the dear, good clergyman felt the necessity of saying Mass, and confided his want to his good and faithful Kleber. The latter did not look in the least surprised. \" I can well understand it,\" he said, in an unctuous tone. \" I think I can manage it. A few miles from here there is a small village called Waldenfels ; we'll go and breakfast with the vicar to-morrow, and I am sure that he will only be too pleased to let you say Mass.\" So said, so done. Next morning the two re paired to Waldenfels, and called upon the priest. They told him that they had come to drink the waters in Germany for their health. After a few moments conversation, the worthy French ecclesi astic stated the real purpose of his visit, his German colleague accedingtohis request with great alacrity. On the day appointed (the Sunday following), there was no need to borrow a congregation, the whole personel of the gaming-tables, besides a great many of the habitues, crowded the small church. Kleber had purposely selected nine o'clock, so as to give them ample time to be back by eleven ; but what was more to the point, he took an active part in the ceremony \u2014 he assisted the good priest in the capacity of acolyte, having previously, to be thoroughly within his part, made the sacrifice of his magnificent whiskers. What was more wonderful still, Kleber, notwith standing the daily abstraction of a heavy percent-"], [101, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 91 age on the gains, managed to get the steeple within a week after the religious ceremony. It is on record that Frederic Lemaitre invari ably attended Mass on the eve of \"creating\" a new part. As we do not suspect Mr. Spurgeon to have imitated Kleber, we will mete out the same justice to the latter ; but it is certain that Kleber repaired to church with every new client before commencing operations. His religious tolerance was so great as not even to mind attending Protestant worship in the case of an Englishman or German. Frank, to whom I told the tale exactly as I have written it down, stared at me open-mouthed when I had concluded. \" I have got a notion,\" he remarked, \" that there is another steeple being gambled for.\" \" What do you mean ? \" \"Yesterday morning, before you were down, I saw a priest walking to and fro in the garden ; he was evidently waiting for the rooms to be opened.\" \" No, he was not.

He was never known to have \" bred a winner,\" to use a sporting term, and unlike the majority of his fellow-professors, he died miserably poor. The administration of the Casino paid for his funeral, and kept him during his last illness. The modern professor acts altogether differently. As I have already said he never stirs from Monte- Carlo, and manages to put something by for a rainy day. His mode of baiting varies very little, so when I have described one, I have pretty well described them all. The bait is as a rule a greasy, dog-eared note-book, covered from the first page to the last with figures, numbers, hieroglyphic signs It is dangled before the victim's eyes for an hour or more. Of course the latter must be an absolute novice. A three days' old is of no use whatsoever, for the chances are ten to one that he has had the hook in his jaws, and only wrenched himself loose after considerable damage. As a rule, however, our professor knows every new face, and is sometimes assisted by his better-half as a beater. The other day one of the fraternity got a bite, and in less than an hour and a half made away with the funds placed at his disposal. When the last louis was gone \u2014 exclusive of those that had found their way into his waistcoat pocket \u2014 he led his victim out into the hall, where the professor's spouse was waiting for him.

The notion that I was to benefit by the realization of Frank's dream had pretty well vanished by then. Frank's state of mind with regard to the same dream was more difficult to gauge. He did not disguise from himself that 250/. did not constitute the fortune \" which the vision gave him a right to expect \" \u2014 I use his own words. And even admitting that he had still something like twenty or twenty-five clear days before him wherein to try his luck, he would have to play a much bolder game than he had hitherto done, to secure anything like an independ ency for life. And if his dream did not mean that, it meant nothing at all. He did not for a moment entertain the idea that luck could come to him in any other shape than that of money, and of money won at the gaming-tables. I pointed out to him"], [106, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 96 that one phase of his dream represented a church in which a marriage was celebrated. \"True,\" he said, \"but you must also remember that there was no sign of Martha in that church. I have heard before now of an American taking his honeymoon trip by himself, on the ground that times were too bad to afford the expense of taking his bride, but I have never heard of a man getting married by himself. Besides, I am certain that the couple at the altar did not include myself.\" \" What about the last scene of all ; your return from your wedding tour ? \" I asked. \"With regard to that, my boy, I feel as you felt with regard to the legacy of Miss Dorothy Craw ford. But for the absence of Lady Crimson in that scene, I should look upon it as the most natural thing in the world ; because it is almost certain that I shall marry Martha Crimson one of these days- The puzzling part of the affair is that Lady Crimson was not there to receive us on our coming home, and that she was in the church, for be you certain that she will be at our home if she be alive. She will be like Eccles in ' Caste ; ' she will come often.\" \" Unless she's got rid of like Eccles. We may find a Captain Hawtree to effect her removal.\" \" There is something in what you say, and like the drowning man clinging to a spar, I cling to that part of the vision which showed her to me during the marriage ceremony, and not at my own coming home. That is, if I cling to anything at all.\""], [107, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 97 In spite of this disclaimer I knew full well that Frank did cling to something, that, strange as it may sound to modern ears, he expected a kind of miracle. But I felt equally certain that he had no preconception as to the nature of it, or of the way it would effect the realization of his vision. But there was no opportunity of arguing the matter, for the train steamed into the Nice station. Almost the first man of our acquaintance we met at the Grand Hotel was Major Castergell. It is not very difficult to describe him. He is every inch a gentleman, the perfect type of the old cavalry officer, absolutely incapable of a mean or dishonest thought, let alone of a doubtful act, deservedly proud of his social position, hand some, faultlessly dressed ; in short, a man who has the entree to any and every drawing-room in London, who is a member of two or three of the best clubs, and who has above all an instinctive dislike to shoddy parvenus and questionable society when in England. Yet this very man associates with scarcely anything else abroad ; where he becomes like that Roman Emperor, whom it was averred that he was strictly virtuous at home, and the very reverse when out. The moment he caught sight of Frank and me he was up in the air. He had taken tickets for us for the Bal Blanc on Sunday evening, he wanted us to come to the Cercle de la Mediterranee when ever we could, he had secured seats on a drag for H"], [108, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 98 the Corso on Monday evening, a box for the ball at the Opera on Tuesday, and last but not least we were to accompany him to another ball at Mrs. Maltmarsh on Wednesday. Of course the latter entertainment was strictly in accordance with Pro testant traditions ; for as he added, \" We are not supposed not to dance on Ash Wednesday ; though there will be a good many foreigners there also.\" \" It seems to me,\" observed Frank, \"that foreign Catholics are not unlike Mousqueton's father in ' Twenty Years After.' That gentleman robbed Hugenots and Catholics alike under the pretext of religion. When he met a Papist on the highway, he became for the nonce a staunch Calvinist. When, on the contrary, he sighted a heretic, his admiration of the Church of Rome got the better of him.\" \"Be sure they will be served like Mousqueton's father was in the end. They will be caught betwixt two fires,\" laughed Castergell. \" By-the-bye,\" inquired Frank, \" have you seen anything of Count Barsowsky ? He has not been at Monte-Carlo since we came, though he said he would be there.\" \" I have not,\" says Castergell. \" He went to Cannes on Tuesday to see some friends, and was to be back on Wednesday night. He has not beer back since. A woman in it, no doubt.\" \" Nonsense,\" protested Frank, \" Barsowsky is too old and too wise for that kind of thing.\""], [109, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 99 \" He may be too old, but he is not too wise. Wisdom rarely comes before age, but it does not always come with age. Remember my words, there is a petticoat in it. It is the only thing on earth that will keep him away from the gaming tables, if he is within a hundred miles of them.\" \" Of course love is like the measles, dangerous when it attacks the old,\" said Frank, looking wise. '\u25a0 I have got a notion his outbreaks are more like nettle-rash, to some extent in the blood, but neither dangerous nor of long duration. But I am certain there is a petticoat somewhere.\" With which he left us, saying that he would call after dinner to take us to the club. The results of that and several other visits are embodied in an article by Frank from which, for reasons stated in the beginning of this little, book, I give an extract. In compliance with his wish, I beg to add, that most of the information contained in it was sup plied by Major Castergell. Extracts from Frank's Articles. A friend has introduced me to the first and fore most club in Nice. The whole of the establishment is more than comfortable, but what impressed me most after a few visits was the magnificence of the furniture and table appointments, the valuable dinner service, the napery, the plate, a great d:al of which is real silver. II 2"], [110, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 100 \" How often is all this renewed during the year ?\" I asked. \"Renewed?\" echoed my companion. \"But it is scarcely ever renewed. As far as I remember the same things have been in use for the last five years.\" \" In that case,\" I remarked, \"every one of those attendants and servants around us is simply a splendid incarnation of virtue. I should not at all have been surprised to hear that the place was stripped once a month. Vice and dishonesty can not be so contagious as philosophers make out.\" My friend laughed. \" I see what you mean,\" he said ; \" but you must remember that spoliation of that kind would land the despoiler into the Assize Court and that a man's conscience alone rarely lands him there. The shady gentry you have seen here, the professional punters, the sham counts and barons, the blacklegs have only to reckon with that, and ' the still small voice ' lulls them to sleep instead of keeping them awake after a good haul.\" The above conversation took place on the morning after a signal execution. The reader need not shudder ; the culprit was neither hanged nor strangled, he was simply and politely expelled the club. If one of his victims or one of the spectators had taken it into his head to kick him, he, the kicker, would have been voted bad form, and probably been informed in a manner less polite than that of the expulsion, that the doors of the"], [111, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 101 club would henceforth be closed to him. For we are a very polite gathering indeed. So polite, in fact, that enormities the mere whisper of which in any other place would expose the sayer of them to a pair of black eyes, are uttered and listened to here without wincing, nay with a smile. A case in point which happened not later than the day before yesterday. My friend, who is a retired English officer \u2014 a genuine one \u2014 numbers among his acquaintances a young Frenchman, very wealthy, belonging to one of the best families. He has only one fault, he is a most inveterate gambler, and rather than not play at all, he would sit down to dcarte or baccara with a footman. Not long ago, he was caught in one of the most infamous dens in Paris. The Commissary of Police, who knew him well, did not think fit to arrest him, merely asked him to ac company him, and in going downstairs presumed to read him a lesson. He might have wasted his breath on a deaf man. Paul de Verneuil \u2014 of course, I am not giving his real name \u2014 was furious at having had his game interrupted ; he was losing between eight and nine thousand francs. The moment he got into the street he jumped into a cab, closed the door upon himself, and then open ing the window, shouted to the official : \" I don't care a snap for all your moralizing. You want to prevent my gambling. I have just lost about nine thousand francs ; 1 have got another ten thousand upon me, and I am going to lose them"], [112, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 102 there and then, I shan't tell you where, and I defy you to find it out.\" With which he disappeared. In the afternoon of next day a neatly tied parcel was brought to the Commissary with the following letter. The former contained a very handsome cigarette case and matchbox. \" Monsieur le Commissaire, \u2014 I am much obliged for your intervention. It brought me luck. I not only did not lose my ten thousand francs, but won the other nine back again and something besides. Herewith a token of appreciation of your kind conduct. I would ask you, if it be not incon sistent with your duty to interfere often in that way, and if we could come to an arrangement to that effect, I should let you know by telephone where I am playing. But whether or no, believe me, \"Yours very sincerely, \" Paul de Verneuil.\" There is no need, I think, to add another trait to the portrait of that gambler. To come back for a moment to the theme with which I started ; the excruciating politeness with which the most scathing insults are bandied about in the Nice club. Paul de Verneuil, then, was having a game of with a comparative stranger, when my friend entered. De Verneuil's opponent looked respect able enough, he was evidently a Mexican or a Brazilian, to judge by his complexion only, for he"], [113, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 103 said very little ; in fact, he was remarkably un demonstrative for a native of those regions. Nevertheless, after watching two or three games my friend noticed that the stranger was cheating as hard as he could, and as the game was for ten louis the five points, he thought it best to warn De Verneuil. \" In London or even in Paris,\" said my friend, \" I should have simply waited to take him redhanded and spoken out without much ado. If you did that kind of thing here, you would find that you had the whole of the club, not to say the municipality of Nice against you, for what they want above all is to keep the town, and consequently the first and foremost social institution in it, above suspicion to the uninitiated. They are exceedingly anxious to tacitly institute a comparison between the Monte-Carlo establishment, where de facto every one is admitted, and the club where some kind of introduction is necessary.\" So he quietly told De Verneuil that he wished to speak to him on a matter of importance. The latter was rather hipped at being interrupted, but after apologizing to his vis-a-vis, rose. \" What is it ? \" he asked abruptly. My friend took him aside, told him what he had seen, and recommended him to leave off as soon as possible. \" Is that all ? \" says De Verneuil in aloud voice, notwithstanding my friend's repeated \" hush, hush.\" \" Is that all, monsieur cheats. But I am well aware that monsieur cheats. Only we have agreed that each time I catch him at it, I mark a point. Isn't that it, monsieur ? \" The"], [114, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 104 stranger simply bowed affirmatively, and the game went on as before \u2014 \"and,\" said my friend, \"as if nothing unusual had happened.\" From what I have seen since I have been here, De Verneuil's tolerance is only singular in one or two respects. First, that he should have sat down with a man whom he knew to be a blackleg to gamble for important stakes ; secondly, that he himself played fair throughout, and only confined himself to mark the point in his favour when he managed to trip up his opponent. Perhaps, both the tolerance and the recklessness on his part were provoked by the fact of the cheating presenting a certain element of good faith. This may seem a paradox, but it is not. The man was known to be a cheat and virtually consented to be treated as such. His operations were conducted generally on a small scale, his contrivances were transparent indeed. He commanded as such the pity, if nothing else, of the seasoned gambler, who knew or guessed that the same being had started in life as a pigeon and become a rook, but a rook with very little pluck and no genius. \" The gambler is half a hero,\" said Lamartine ; and the hero has more than one way of giving quarter to the adver sary defeated. If the latter stands up manfully, he will treat him like an honoured guest and equal, if he plays foul and admits as much, he will not stain his heroic sword with his blood, especially if from the beginning he perceived the treacherous intent and confronted him nevertheless. That, in"], [115, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 105 my humble opinion, is the philosophy which guides De Verneuil, and I have had occasion to see several instances of the same. Different is it with the pseudo-champion who resorts to unfair means, pretending all the while to be without fear and without reproach. Such a one was \" executed \" the other night. No mercy was shown to him, of course figuratively. The individual in question was a German baron of Jewish origin, and had had a fortnight of uninter rupted luck at baccara. His winnings were com puted at more than a hundred thousand francs. On the night he met with his fate, his .star was still in the ascendant, when in an evil moment he left the room to get his cigar-case, meanwhile depositing his spectacles on the pack of cards \u2014 he was bank ing himself. A wag, practical joker and good mimic to boot, bethought himself of giving the members a taste of his powers by imitating the Hebrew nobleman, and to that effect \" got into the spectacles\" as Rabelais would have said. The performance, however, never got beyond the initial stage, for no sooner had he got the glasses on his nose, no sooner had he bent over the paste boards, toying with and caressing them as did the original of his portrait, no sOoner had he done all this than his features assumed a look of blank amazement. And no wonder ; the innocent look ing lenses were nothing less than strong magnifying ones, enabling their wearer to detect every small spot on the surface of the cards' backs, and the"], [116, "106 We Two at Monte-Carlo. spots, absolutely imperceptible to the naked eye, were there in great profusion, in too great pro fusion. To acquaint the president of the club, who happened to be standing by, with his discovery; to let several of the players judge for themselves was the work of a moment, for all this took less time in the act than in the description of it. But the scene reached its climax only with the entrance of the baron, who endeavoured to put a brazen face upon the matter. It did not do though, and ten minutes later he was like Satan in the third canto of \" Paradise Lost,\" looking at the lights shining through the windows of the club. Of course it is still a debatable question whether our German friend used what in gambler's parlance is called la portee, or whether he marked the cards supplied by the club by some contrivance of his own. The committee were inclined to institute an inquiry, but a more practical member nipped the project in the bud, much as Jack Poyntz in \" School \" cut short the discussion as to who killed cow, by observing that it did not matter to the cow, seeing that she was killed. The members had been cheated for two or three weeks. What did it matter how they were cheated, seeing that they were cheated. So there the matter rests. The chances are a hundred to one against such an inquiry revealing any new facts, because la portee, that is, a pack of cards or part of a pack being hidden in the coat-tail or breast-pocket of the operator, and being skilfully mixed with the"], [117, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 107 other cards, is a trick as old as the hills, especially in baccara, where three or four packs are used. Who supplies this pack ? Echo answers, \" Who ? \" The gorgeous creature in silk stock- ings and plush breeches is suspected, and perhaps not altogether wrongly ; but there is no evidence against him. The scandal in the foremost Parisian club about five years ago proved that well enough. Are there no means of having a special pattern manufactured for a special club. Perfectly. But, at the same time, the manufacturer must be sure of his employes, and the supervision would cost too much money; and if the money were spent the result would be the same, unless every pack used during the evening were burnt in the presence of the president or secretary the same night. Pro- vided a miracle of preservation did not intervene, as it intervened with many of the books burned by the hangman or other functionaries during the Middle Ages, and half a hundred copies of which books are still scattered through the libraries of Europe, \" though not a single copy left the pub lisher,\" before the hangman got hold of them. Once more, la portee is the oldest and easiest trick, and beats all the more complicated ones, such as the marking with pencil, or with gum, or with the pointed finger-nail dipped beforehand in some special pigment. That is why the most clumsy, as well as the most skilful, the most timid, as well as the most audacious resort to it by pre ference ; that is why it gives rise every now and"], [118, "108 We Two at Monte-Carlo. then to the most comic complications. Here is one of these. I give it textually according to my informant already quoted. \" About a twelvemonth ago,\" he said, \" we had an honorary member here, of whom absolutely nothing was known. The member who introduced him had met him at the Hotel Continental, and at the Hotel Beausejourin Cannes. At both hostelries he paid his bills without grumbling and to the minute, which in enlightened regions here is tantamount to being a gentleman, according to ' club-law.' He wasn't a gentleman, but he wasn't unlike one. It was the very superior paste, that looked like the real diamond to all but the expert. The Countess de Chevreuse, on being asked at a ball, at the Tuileries by Napoleon I., whether all her diamonds were real, replied : ' No, not all, but they are good enough for here.' The man might have replied the same. He was good enough for here. Faultlessly dressed, an equable temper, a quiet player, though not a high one, he came nearly every night, taking one or two, never more than three hands at chemin de fer, pocketing from five-and-twenty to fifty louis. There was nothing very formidable in that, so he aroused no suspicion. One evening, he had already taken the bank twice, his turn comes the third time. He seldom kept it for more than four deals, the first he wins with an eight, the second with a nine \u2014 there are forty louis in the bank. The third deal he looks at his cards, and says to his vis-a-vis, a Viennese"], [119, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 109 gentleman, 'fen donne;' holding out a card. 'sen prends,' says the latter, and at the same time an eight of clubs is displayed to view, which makes all the spectators stare with surprise. An eight of clubs, dirty and greasy, dog-eared, and right across it in black stencil-marks, Thedtre-Frangais de Nice. Our man had been to the play, they had given him a check between the acts, which he had dropped into his tail-pocket, where it had got mixed with his port/e. \" ' Serves him right for going away in the middle of a play by my son,' said Victorien Sardou's father, who lives at Grasse, and to whom the story was told. The piece that night happened to be one of Sardou's best, ' Patries \" Short of employing a confederate to stand be hind your opponent, there appears to be no other trick available than the introduction of an extra pack of cards ; but a confederate is at best a risky thing. His splitting upon his fellow-cheat is the least danger to be apprehended ; the latter is well aware that expulsion must come sooner or later, but to be expelled after having been cleaned-out thoroughly through his mate having leagued himself with some one else, and giving him false signals, is the great blow against which the cheat has to be constantly on his guard. For, notwithstanding the proverb of honour among thieves, that kind of thing occurs frequently, and the victim has no chance of reprisal, his lips being fatally closed.

He meets with social death on the green cloth just as the greater part cf the \" six hundred \" met with physical death at Balaklava ; but the world stands and wonders. The memory of such a one lives in the annals of this club, though his extinction took place at Vienna. He was a Bohemian, and not a fiddler, consequently a thief. His mode of operating was simple in the extreme, the discovery of his fraud due to the merest accident. He rarely played chemin defer, he preferred \" baccara without spasms,\" as some one called the uninterrupted game. It gave him the means of settling himself comfortably in the banker's armchair, of taking out his cigarette case and his tobacco box, which were the wonder if not the envy of all beholders from their size, for he was a great smoker. They were made of solid blocks of silver almost, polished to a matchless degree of brilliancy. He dealt very slowly, seem- ing to examine each card as he dealt it with pain- ful scrutiny, and hardly ever looking up. The cigarette case was on his left, the tobacco box on his right, and both were nothing less than a couple of mirrors, reflecting the cards as he dealt them. He operated for more than four months at the Nice club, and left on the best of terms with all the members, nearly every one of whom he had fleeced, \" even M. Carrard,\" added my informant, \"which after all is an extenuating circumstance, or ought to be.\""], [121, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 111 \" Why, ' even M. Carrard ' ? \" I asked. \" I do not wish to quote Scripture profanely, else I should remind you of the verse, 'Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these, etc., etc' Only Carrard happens to be not one of the least, but one of the foremost among the knowing ones.\" \" Is he among the tricksters ? \" \" He is the mute, inglorious Milton of them, though in reality the most formidable of the lot.\" \" Does he use la portee, pencil, gum or pig ment?\" \" Neither ; his villainy is like Thompson's loveli ness \u2014 it needs not the aid of foreign ornament.

Indulgence is the motto of society here, as long as a man keeps on his financial, a woman on her moral legs. Both may be artificial, but that is not society's concern. And to misquote Carlyle, ' It is wonderful \"how long the artificial will hold together, provided it be not too roughly handled.' The wearers of these artificial limbs are careful not to stumble, for they know that once down, it is all up with them. But here is M.

Carrard had taken the bank with three or four hundred louis, I don't know exactly which. I had been in the room about five minutes, and was watching a tall, powerful, apoplectic-looking individual, ap parently a Provencal, who was smoking his cigar, not quietly like some one at peace, but evi dently under the influence of deep excitement.

Though they knew it to be perfectly useless, they hustled one another to undo his neckcloth ; some shouted for a doctor; they were trying to get him near an open window, and then and then only Carrard rose, and with exasperating calmness, said, ' One moment, gentlemen, let us look at his cards first.' \" You will agree with me that the deepest dyed scoundrel and blackleg, who had changed the cards during the excitement for his own benefit, would be deserving of more respect.\" \" What did the members say to it ? \" I asked. \" For a moment they stood aghast at the utter callousness of the fellow, for a moment only, and then they burst out laughing.

No doubt there is play, and very high play, going on at Cannes at the Cercle de la Marine, but he has been known to travel for six months or so in countries where there is no opportunity for gambling.

He says there is too much social ' gallivant ing ' in Paris among the men of the present day to do that sort of thing there, and a propos of this, a delightful story is told of him. It was before he left Paris six years ago. The Grand Prix had been run, and as usual De Parolles got to his club in the Rue Royale about three o'clock in the afternoon. There was not a single soul to take a hand with, and he went away grumbling. The following is supposed to be the invention of a wag, but the latter part of the affair is absolutely authentic. It is said that in going down the Place de la Concorde, he yielded to the solicitations of a cabman to take a drive in the Bois de Boulogne, where he had not been for years, and that on his return he played Jehu, for his two hours' fare, a game of piquet on the cushions of the victoria in his own (Parolles') courtyard, being ashamed to take him into the house. What is certain, is that he made his re-ap pearance at nine in the evening at the Rue Royale, and that he found the baccara-table covered up and put awray into a corner.

Then the old man got angry, took up his hat and stick, saying, ' The country, the country ; the country is only fit for little birds.' \" Next morning he left Paris for Nice, and he has never been back since. \"You'll agree with me,\" my friend went on, \" that De Parolles is an inveterate gambler if ever there was one. Well, to come back to what you said about gambling making a savage brute of a man. I can vouch for the contrary in this case. De Parolles is exceedingly kind-hearted and charitable. I have often met him in the street, and never known him to pass by a poor man. In the morning you can find a dozen pensioners at the door of his apartment, and, mind you, for seven mornings in the week.\" \" Perhaps he is an exception.\" \" I don't think so. I have known gamblers to be capable of very genuine acts of friendship.\" We moved away from the window, and after what I had been told, I could not help looking at M. de Parolles with a certain kind of interest. Ninety years of age, and two-thirds of these, per haps more, spent at the card-table. M. de Parolles had evidently been unable to make up a whist party, for he was playing ecarte with Count Herbestall. They were playingfor pastime merely, for they kept chattering all the while. \" By-the-bye, M. de Parolles,\" said Herbestall, \" your old friend Chardin has not been here for"], [129, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 119 four or five days. I heard that he was ill. Do you know whether he is any better ? \" \" I don't think he is ill,\" replied the old gentle man, \" for I think he would have let me know. How many cards ? \" \"Three. You have known him a long while, have not you ? \" \" I have known him all my life. We were at college together. We afterwards belonged to the same club. He was at my wedding ; I was at his. We very seldom lost sight of one another for more than a month or so. Old fogies, you know. In fact I don't know what I should do without him. I mark the king. Hearts.\" \"Well, I should advise you to go and see him. Doctor Barre told me yesterday that he did not at all like the symptoms.\" \" Trumps. Doctor Barre is somewhat of an alarmist. Chardin is younger than I am ; he has a better constitution. I suppose he has caught a chill, nothing dangerous I am sure. My deal, I think. Still I fancy I'd better call on my way to dinner and see Chardin.\" At that moment the president of the club entered the room and stepped up to the table. Herbestall had dealt the cards. \" I don't think you'll see Chardin any more,\" said the new comer, \" for he died an hour ago.\" The old man looked up at the speaker, put down his cards, and dropped his head upon the table as if dazed by the sudden blow. He uttered a low"], [130, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 120 moan, and remained in that position for full three minutes. I ran for a glass of water, frightened at this exhibition of sudden grief. When I came back he had recovered his composure, and was just picking up his cards. \" Poor Chardin,\" he sighed, \" he was the younger of the two. Well, we must all die. I'll take your cards, Herbestall.\" I put my arm in that of my guide and friend. As we walked downstairs he turned to me and said, \" I am afraid you were right, the gambler is very near the savage brute.\" So far Frank's article."], [131, "CHAPTER VIII. A plot. On the Sunday morning when I came down to breakfast, I found Frank in the garden with an open letter in his hand. \" Lady Crimson went straight through to Cannes,\" he said, \" and Martha tells me that she received a telegram from her, saying that she would remain there and not go on to Nice. So I am safe. Martha thinks I am still in Paris.\" \" Do you really mean to say that Martha has no suspicion of your whereabouts ? \" \" Certainly not. I told you before that it would not have done to let her know. She is a good girl, but cannot keep her own secrets from that woman, let alone other people's. Safe so far, my boy, and I am going to enjoy myself to-night. I am going to get a costume directly. It must be all white. What a pity I did not bring my flan nels.\" \" Yes ; and if you had, people might have asked you why you did not bring your boat, as"], [132, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 122 Beau Nash asked the fellow at Bath who came in a boating dress.\" \"Never mind, your chaff won't spoil my pleasure.

You know it must be all white ; and I must confess that I should not like to make a fool of myself by going in fancy dress.\" \" Nobody does like to make a fool of himself deliberately. In that respect it is the fools who fear to tread where the angels rush. I am going to be an angel.\" \" Perhaps you have chosen your dress already, you were up very early this morning.\""], [133, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 123 \" Well, to tell you the truth, I went out with that intent, but I did not accomplish it, as the classics would say.\" \" What prevented you ? \" \" Barsowsky.\" \" Barsowsky ? But Barsowsky is at Cannes.\" \"He was not just now. Pie was in the costumier's place, selecting costumes ; and what is more, selecting costumes for a lady.\" \" Then Castergell is right, there is a petticoat at the bottom of it.\" \" It would appear so ; but I have got a notion that the petticoat is not of the usual texture.\" \" What do you mean ? \" \" I mean that it is not an ordinary adventure this time. I happened to come in very softly, and he had his back turned towards me, looking at some dresses near the window. I heard him say that the dresses had to be sent to the Prince of Wales Hotel at Cannes this very afternoon to be tried on, that those not wanted would be returned to-morrow, and that the lady herself would see to the alterations if any were necessary. It is there fore evidently a lady in society \u2014 the new flame.\" \" Nothing surprising in that. Barsowsky moves in the best society in St. Petersburg, Vienna, and Paris. Some Russian countess or princess, per haps.\" \"It may be, but I don't think so. I have always heard that Russian women of the world are pretty frank in their doings, that there is nothing"], [134, "We Two at Monte- Carlo. 124 shamefaced about their friendships and liaisons. When Barsowsky saw me, he stopped short, just as he was going to give the name. Hence I come to the conclusion that it is some American widow or girl trying to hook a title.\" \" Yours is not only a very inductive, but very deductive philosophy, deai boy ; but you may be right.\" \" I am sure I am. He was not so cordial as he had been during the few days I knew him here. He looked sheepish, like a man who is going to do something of which he is ashamed, and from what you told me of Barsowsky, that can only mean one thing.\" \"And what may that be ? \" I asked. \" That he has allowed himself to become suffi ciently infatuated to get married.\" I could not help laughing. Marriage to Bar sowsky would certainly mean a recantation of his life-long principles, he who had always said that matrimony to love was as vinegar to wine. \" Never mind, old fellow,\" I said, trying to divert his thoughts, for Frank was evidently pondering over Barsowsky's behaviour, \" he will perhaps invite us to his wedding, and then part of your dream will come true, for you may be sure that Barsowsky will not get married either in a Protestant or in a Catholic church, but in a Greek one.\" \" Great Scott ! I never thought of that,\" gasped Frank, turning pale. \"Then the rest of my"], [135, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 125 dream may come true also, and I shall marry Martha.\" \" Of course you'll marry Martha. Did you ever intend doing anything else ? \" \" I didn't, and I don't, nor does Martha ; but there are other people that would like to put a spoke in our wheel, and are trying fair and foul means to that effect. Look here, old fellow, I have not been so candid with you as I might have been, but I did not like to worry you with my affairs. When you heard me speak of my dislike to Lady Crimson, you probably ascribed it to my impatience of religious humbug, as distinct from true religion. It is more than that. I am sure that the woman is a bitter enemy who would at all costs prevent my marriage with her stepdaughter. In how far the suspicion of my knowing part of her antecedents influences her, I cannot say ; but this much I do know, that she is moving heaven and earth to entrap Martha into marrying some one else before she is twenty-three.\" Here he tapped lightly on the open letter in his hand. I looked at Frank in surprise. He had become very serious indeed. Hitherto I had not thought his affection for Martha Crimson such a deep seated one. \" I did not think you were so far gone, dear boy,\" I said sympathetically. \"/did,\" was the answer; \" but I do not wear my heart upon my sleeve, as a rule. I should not be a broken-hearted man, perhaps, if I did not marry Martha Crimson, but my purpose in life"], [136, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 126 would be gone. And now let me read you a few lines of her letter, and then you will see how much reason I have to fear. \" I had a telegram from Lady Crimson last night telling me of her arrival in Cannes. She does not intend to stir from there, she says. I am rather puzzled why she should have gone at all, because Dr. Walderson, whom I happened to meet this morning, plainly hints that there is nothing the matter with her. You know, dear Frank, that I am not clever at putting two and two together, and that I am the least likely person to see farther than my nose, which, not being a very long one, is not very useful ' as a guide to detection,' that is how you would put it. Still I have an inkling why this journey to Cannes was so suddenly un- dertaken. For it was very sudden. On the Mon- day morning after you started for Paris, mamma had certainly no intention of going to Cannes, though the Candleburys had announced theirs to that effect weeks ago. On that morning she said she had to go into the City to see her solicitor, and when she came back, she told Mrs. Monckton to get her things ready for the following Tuesday. At the same time, it appears, Ephraim Candlebury, I do not mean Sir Ephraim, but the son, abandoned his plan of joining his father and mother, and announced his intention of taking up his quarters at Stamford Hill with his sisters, to keep them company. Lovely company he is. I prefer Nero in his most silent and grumpy moods. He at any rate lies down on the"], [137, "W7e Two at Monte-Carlo. 127 hearth-rug and goes to sleep right off. His slumbers are peaceful, Ephraim sleeps aloud. However, I was to benefit by the company, in other words, I was to go and stay with Jane and Sophie. But for once I put down my foot firmly, though I like the girls. I said I should be pleased to have them with me, but I would not leave Elder Hall. But do you see the cleverness of it ? Mr. Ephraim would have made the running \u2014 that is a horribly slangy phrase, but it just explains what I mean. My dear Frank, I shall be glad when another twelvemonth is over our heads, because I am rather tired of being thrown at the head of every young \" elect of Zion,\" lest I should marry \" a poor Fleet Street scribbler,\" as you are denominated. I so much prefer the scribbler ; but really, Lady Crimson is making my life a burden to me, and I wish you would ask the Queen to let you marry me before I come of age. Is it the Queen, or the Com- mander-in-chief of the British army, or the Arch- bishop of Canterbury ? It cannot be the latter, seeing that papa was never tired of talking about \" the pampered dignitaries of the Church.\" I am stupid, dear Frank, for I remember now, it is the Speaker of the House of Commons. I recollect being taken before him after papa died, and I recognized him afterwards by his wig, which I saw in a picture in the illustrated papers. Write soon to yours affectionately, ' Martha.'"], [138, "128 We Two at Monte- Carlo. \" Well, what do you think of it ? \" asked Frank. \" I think ? I think that if I were your age I would sooner have a letter like that written to me than be Prime Minister of England.\" \" Yes, I know,\" said Frank, beaming with pleasure ; \" but I didn't mean that. I meant what do you think of Lady Crimson ?\" \" I don't think you have much to fear from her ; but I am sorry that you did not tell Miss Crimson of your journey to Monte-Carlo. If that were found out, it would be used as a weapon against you.\" Frank's face fell. \" Had not I better go back ? \" he said. \" Certainly not ! \" I replied very emphatically ; but I am bound to confess that my emphasis was meant to hide my irresolution. Though, as the reader already knows, I had by no means in stigated Frank's journey to Monte-Carlo, I felt that I was in the same boat with him, especially as regards the dream. A moment's careful reflection would have convinced one how foolish this feeling was ; but I did not reflect. Had he gone back, I would have considered myself bound to accompany him. I had given up all hopes of making a fortune at Monte-Carlo ; but I had not given up all hopes of making a little more money after the Carnival, hence my \" certainly not.\" \" Certainly not,\" I repeated. \" If the worst comes to the worst, I will take the blame of your journey to Monte-Carlo upon myself; I will say"], [139, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 129 that we met accidentally in Paris, and that I pre vailed upon you to come.\" \" That will not mend matters much,\" observed Frank ruefully. \"It will only provide Lady Crimson with another weapon against me by point ing out what nice friends I have got.\" \"Never mind. Neither the Candleburys nor Lady Crimson are likely to come to Nice during this Paganish Carnival. The erstwhile Lottie Lola would cover her eyes at the sight of the cancan, and stop her ears at the sound of the chaliut, unless the old Adam, or rather Eve, got the better of her and made her join in both. She will certainly not come to Monte-Carlo afterwards, and we will flit the first thing on Wednesday morning.\" \" What about the dance at Mrs. Maltmarsh's, to which Castergell wants to take us ? \" \" We'll let that slide ; and, to show you that I mean to stand by you through thick and thin, we will both go to the costumier's by-and-by to select our dresses.\" Frank's handsome face brightened, and if every one on that morning was charged the same for breakfast at the Grand Hotel, there was a distinct wrong done in favour of an individual appetite. After our coffee, we sallied forth into the bright, sunlit streets, already thronged with people, and Frank's spirits rose still higher at his first glimpse of a really enjoyable scene. Just as we were turning the corner of the Quai Jean-Baptiste by the Casino, some one lifted his hat to Frank. K"], [140, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 130 \" Who is that, Frank ? \" \" That's Carrard, the man I told you about last night \u2014 the man who makes about three thousand a year by gambling in Nice, by never going to Monte-Carlo.\" \" What a vulgar villain he looks ! \" \" Yes ; if he be honest, he should bring an action for libel against his face ; but I ought not to say it, for he seems to have taken an unaccountable fancy to me. He sat talking to me for full two hours. I never heard a foreigner, especially a Frenchman, speak such marvellous English, and what is more, he is exceedingly well-informed.\" \" He has lived in England, I suppose ?\" \" Yes ; he told me in the York Road, Waterloo Road.\" \" A curious place for an ordinary Frenchman to live in. They generally foregather in Soho.\" \" Carrard is no ordinary Frenchman, if he be a Frenchman at all, of which I have got my doubts, apart from his wonderful grasp of English. But Frenchman or Englishman, and villain though he may be, and no doubt is, that man is something out of the common. Ungainly and vulgar, he is built like a Hercules. Do you know of what he puts me in mind ? No ? Well he puts me in mind of Balzac's Vautrain.\" \" In other words, of a desperado of genius ? \" \" Exactly.\" \" Castergell has been putting your head full ot silly stories.\""], [141, "We Two at Monte- Carlo. 131 \" That may be ; but I am sure that even Caster gell has no idea what the man could do, given the opportunity.\" By this time we had reached the costumiers in the old town, close to the Opera, and the subject dropped. As a matter of course, Frank was very particular about his dress, though it had to be worn that night only, we both having decided not to repeat the experiment on the Tuesday at the Opera. I should not at all mind being dressed in gorgeous colours, and in more attractive garments than our modern ones all the days of my life, but to have to wear them on special occasions only, makes one feel awkward. The philosophy of clothes, how ever, is not one within the scope of this little book. I chose a white serge friar's gown, in which I knew I was safe. Frank selected a magnificent white satin costume of the Elizabethan period, in which he looked very well indeed, though the search for a pair of shoes to match the same made me very tired. Frank did not mind it ; the whole affair was abso lutely new to him, and he enjoyed it thoroughly. I should have much preferred leaving the Casino at about two, but as Frank and Castergell had made the acquaintance of two or three Duchesses, and as many Countesses in disguise, which members of the Continencal aristocracy avowed a preference for going home with the milk in the morning, I stayed with them. I am bound to say K 2"], [142, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 132 that the milk did not suffer in consequence of their escort. They carefully abstained from touching it. I have observed that people given to return to their homes at that early hour are generally very conscious custodians of the lacteal fluid. Frank's misgivings as to being discovered by Lady Crimson had wholly vanished, and by mid- night on Tuesday he was in the highest of spirits. The ceaseless animation and gaiety of the last few days had produced their effect, and he vowed that he would dance a quadrille at the Opera ball with the most reckless danseuse he could find. Caster- gell backed him up, and offered to be his vis-a-vis. The man who would not have made himself con- spicuous for ever so much in Piccadilly or St. James's Street, deliberately planned an exhibition of himself, in common with a class which at home he would have given a wide berth indeed, especi- ally at a public ball, provided kindred entertain- ments existed in England, for even Frenchmen of certain standing fight shy of dancing at opera balls now-a-days, and leave that kind of thing to the young provincial, the counter-jumper, the rowdy \" sucking artist \" from Montmartre. The harum- scarum student from the Quartier Latin, who will kick up his heels at Bullier and the Elys^e Mont martre during the year, will not dance in M. Charles Garnier's splendid building in Carnival time. Justice compels me to admit that the company is not quite so bad at Nice ; still, gentlemen and gentlewomen should only be lookers-on there, as"], [143, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 133 well as in the capital. Castergell was bent upon a little spree, and Frank partly supplied the excuse for indulging in it. Frank little dreamt that his plan would be nipped in the bud. But what Frank seemed more anxious for than \" his fling,\" as he called it, was to get a sight of Bar- sowsky, or to speak by the card of Barsowsky's inna- morata. It is doubtful whether he could have given a valid explanation of this anxiety, but it was there, I am sure. The stir, the bustle, the glitter of the Nice Opera house, which is a very handsome one, did not impress him half as much as I expected it would have done. There was no pretence on his part of not being impressed, on the contrary ; but he seemed preoccupied. We had a large box on the ground tier, it was silled with friends of Castergell's, two or three men of different nationalities, and as many women (American), who made themselves thoroughly agreeable ; but Frank was restless. He wandered in and out, along the corridors, among the dancers, upstairs, everywhere. If I had not known better, I might have fancied that he was bitten with the mania of the Parisian counter jumper, who, notwithstanding his many years of experience to the contrary, is still firmly convinced that the Bal de I'Opera is the Tom Tiddler's ground for adventures. Not for vulgar adventures, blossoming and coming to maturity in the space of twenty-four hours, but for adventures having their denouements at the Mairie and the church, where the wealthy widow or heiress bestows her hand on"], [144, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 134 the poor but fascinating cavalier, who has saved her from insult. Frank was not such an idiot as that, yet he kept peering beneath every woman's hood, scanning every woman's chin, and so much of the features as were left uncovered by the mask, as if his very life depended upon his finding some one. He had got it into his head that he must find Barsowsky and his companion. In vain I remonstrated with him. \" First of all, we do not know that Barsowsky is here. There may be some private ball at Cannes for which he wanted the dresses. Secondly, if he be here with a companion whom he wishes to remain unknown, neither you nor I can discover them in this crowd. Barsowsky is not a striking figure, and he is quite experienced enough to disguise himself beyond the possibility of recognition. But why are you so anxious about Barsowsky ? \" \" I don't know,\" said Frank, \"but ever since you spoke about his wedding, I have got a presentiment that he is mixed up with the realization of my dream.\" \" Then you still believe that we will make our fortunes ?\" I asked. \" I have got a notion that part, if not the whole, of my dream will come true.\" \" I am afraid, old fellow, that you are beginning to make an idiot of yourself. Up till now you have behaved very sensibly with regard to that dream, but you are getting silly about it. You have had an unexpected legacy which enables you"], [145, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 135 to take a few weeks' holiday. In addition to this, you have won a nice little sum of money, which eventually leaves that legacy intact. Why not be satisfied and not worry your brain. Look at your pal M. Carrard ; he is standing over there ; he toils not, he spins not, and he looks perfectly at peace with every one. Go and ask him what he thinks of dreams.\" Curiously enough, between the Sunday when we caught sight of Carrard at the corner of the Quai Jean-Baptiste and the night in question Frank had introduced me to him, I myself had be come interested in the man. Notwithstanding all I had heard, notwithstanding his unprepossess ing face, I fancied he was not as black as he was painted. I have got that much in common with St. Paul, that \" I do not take to fools gladly.\" Carrard was decidedly not one. From his knavery I had nothing to fear, and from a purely intellec tual view he was worth studying. I had had two or three long gossips with him, and found him a wonderful mine of information. Our conversation turned mainly upon London and Paris, and I felt positive that there was not a single man either in the English or French capital who had their histories at his fingers' ends as he had. I ex pressed as much to him, and asked him why he had not turned his talents to account in the way of journalism. \"When you find me a paper that is absolutely honest, that does not truckle to party, to advertis-"], [146, "136 We Two at Monte-Carlo. ing interest, that bows down neither before the aristocracy nor the democracy, I shall be glad to do so,\" he answered. Carrard had caught sight of us, and we went up to him. Just for the sake of dispelling Frank's melancholy, I asked casually, \u2014 \" Do you believe in dreams, M. Carrard ?\" Carrard slightly started, and answered my question by another one. \" Why do you ask ? \" \" Only for fun ; Mr. Spelfield does.\" \" Well,\" he said, \" if it be for fun, it is very funny indeed. Strange as it may seem, and as far as I can recollect, I never in my life had a dream until last night, and then I dreamt of Mr. Spel field, and of some one who can have no possible connection with him, and who, for all I know, may be dead.\" \" Who was the person,\" asked Frank eagerly. \" It would take me too long to tell you now. She was intimately bound up with my life. But I mean to come to Monte- Carlo in a few days, and you shall hear a bit of my history. You who know so many people in the theatrical world in London may help me, perhaps. I have not been to Monte- Carlo for four years. I shall come over and have lunch.\" Frank became restless again, and wandered away, while we stood talking, leaning against one of the boxes. \" I'll join you presently,\" he said. \" Nice young fellow that friend of yours,\" re marked Carrard when he was gone, \" but very im-"], [147, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 137 pressionable \u2014 excitable I should say,\" he correct ed himself. \" When he gets an idea in his head, all the others vanish to make room for that one. What think you of going to sit down in the supper room ? there is an infernal din here, and I am not young enough to like it. Carrard was right ; the din was infernal, and there was not the mother-wit of the Parisian 'Arry to redeem it from mere blatant bathos. The French provincial of any but the highest class is, with a few exceptions, the most dreadful creature in his hours of relaxation and recreation. He is to the Parisian what a cheap German chromo or oleograph is to a good original oil-painting. He is the terror of the obscure but conscientious actor and singer. He pretends to have an opinion of his own in matters of art and literature, which opinion is generally made manifest by either hooting and howling everything down that met with the approval of the Metropolis \u2014 just to show \" who's which,\" as the funny man of the Christy's says \u2014 or else to frantically applaud a production debatable and debated in Paris with moderation and taste. He calls this the emancipation from artistic thraldom imposed by the capital. Yet this very being slavishly imitates the Paris masher, the Paris counter-jumper in his dress, in his slangy voca- bulary, in his affectation of \"go\" on public occasions, and never more so than at a masked ball. In Paris, though not so frequently as of yore, one may hear a \" wit-combat\" worth listening"], [148, "138 We Two at Monte-Carlo. to ; one may see a quadrille, the originality of which compensates to a certain extent for its less commendable features ; in the provinces one rarely, very rarely, gets such a treat. Such wit or humour as one meets with at the Nice Opera ball is nearly always imported, and is confined to the \" swell dom \" from Paris, who condescend to enter the arena \" on this special occasion,\" disguised to such a degree that their own fathers and mothers would not know them. When the wine is in, they will condescend to figure in a quadrille now and then, though they take care to select their partners, not from their own society, but from the crowd. They, as it were, dance to their friends in the boxes, not to the gallery. But it was as yet too early for all this, so Carrard and myself made our way with a sigh of relief to the crush-room at the back of the boxes, where refreshments were served. We had been sitting there for more than an hour, sipping some cooling drink and chatting away on a variety of topics, when I saw Frank coming across the room. He looked very pale, as pale as his shirt-front, and he did not walk very steadily ; in fact he sank into a chair at our table as if overcome with drink. \" Anything the matter, old fellow ? \" I asked. \" No ; but it is stifling inside, and I feel quite faint. Just order something for me. No, not what you are having \u2014 some brandy and a bottle of seltzer.\" I did as he told me, and the waiter brought one"], [149, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 139 of those small flagons of brandy with the number of glasses it contains marked on it. To my great surprise \u2014 for Frank was at all times of abstemious habits \u2014 he poured out a goodly dose, and leaving the seltzer untouched, swallowed it at a draught. Then the colour returned to his cheeks ; but I knew there was something wrong. I did not care, though, to ask questions in presence of Carrard. Whether the latter noticed my anxiety to talk to Frank by myself, I cannot say, but in a few moments he got up and looked at his watch. \" I shall see you again,\" he said. \"They tell me they have got some cancan dancers from Paris here, who are going to dance at about two. I am rather interested in that kind of thing, and want to find them before they begin.\" Then he went away. Pic had scarcely turned his back when I was at Frank. \" What has upset you, old man ? \" I asked. \" I have had my fortune told, \" he said with an unsuccessful attempt at a smile. \" You mean to say that you have been mystified by some clever mask,\" I remarked. \" There is no doubt about her being clever,\" answered Frank. \" Whether I have been mysti fied remains to be seen.\" \" Tell us all about it.\" \" She was dressed like a Spanish gipsy, but she spoke very pretty English, though with a strong foreign accent.\""], [150, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 140 \" Which may have been assumed.\" \"Which may have been assumed, as you say. When I left you and Carrard, she seemed to be following me. In fact I had noticed her before in the lobbies.\" \" Was she alone ? \" \" No ; she was leaning on the arm of a toreador, who conveniently stood by while she was telling my fortune without, however, uttering a syllable.\" \" Did she ask you to tell you your fortune ?\" \" No ; but as I stood talking to a very pretty Normandy peasant-girl with Castergell, she edged past us, and said in a whisper, ' There is a young lady in London who would not like these goings on.'\" \" There is not much in that. It is not very difficult to see that you are an Englishman, and there is not an Englishman, or, for that matter, any man here to-night but who has a young or elderly lady at home, who would not like his ' goings on.' You know what the French say, ' One is always more or less married.' \" \" I know. It was not that which puzzled me, though I confess to not having seen it in that light at the moment. Still, I left the Normandy peasant-girl and followed the gipsy.\" \" What was she like ? \" \" Not at all bad ; as far as I could judge, rather tall, and very pretty hair, hair that reminds me of some one's, though I cannot say who's.

In fact he seemed to look upon the whole affair as a matter of course, not as a joke, but as a serious thing, for he heard her speak to me as she passed us.

' I did not win so much as all that at Monte-Carlo,' I said. And what do you think the answer was ? \" \" I don't know.\" \" The answer was, ' I am not speaking of the money you won at Monte- Carlo, but of the legacy you had left to you.' \" \" The Devil it was ! \" I said, for to my knowledge Frank had not said a word of Miss Crawford's money to any one except myself, not even to Martha Crimson. I was fairly taken aback, and must have shown it."], [152, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 142 \" Her last words took the breath out of me,\" Frank went on ; \" but I tried to remain calm, and held up a touts instead of the five-franc piece I had previously offered.

' I suppose it must,' she answered with a slight toss of her head, and to look at her you would have thought her a genuine gipsy, anxious for money.\" \" Who told you she isn't ? \" \" She is about as much of a gipsy as you or I, though she played the part very well. But some one wrote the part for her, and that some one is no one else than Lady Crimson. She was, to use a legal phrase, instructed from Cannes.\" \" How should she have known you ? \" \" That's not very difficult,\" said Frank. \" I am rather tall for my age, am I not ? \" \" You are not the only tall man here.\" \" No ; but there's not one as tall as I,\" was the reply with a touch of pride. \" But what makes you think that she is instructed by Lady Crimson ? \" \" She told me things that no one but Martha or Lady Crimson could know, little things about the beginning of our courtship. Then she gave, as usual, a hint about another fair man being in my way, and to leave no doubt, furnished a pretty accurate de scription of Ephraim Candlebury. I must say that if it was furnished by Lady Crimson, she is a capital hand at a verbal sketch, and the good young man in question has no reason to feel flattered."], [153, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 143 Besides, do you think I should have attached much weight to a masked ball adventure if in what the supposed gipsy said I did not plainly read a declaration of war on Lady Crimson's part.? \" \" How is that ? \" \" Well, after telling me several matters which could only be known to Martha, Lady Crimson, and myself, she wound up by saying that I should not marry the girl I am engaged to, because a dark woman stood between me and her.\" \" That's the usual thing.\" \" That's what I remarked to her, and then she answered, ' You make a mistake; the dark woman does not want you for herself \u2014 she is going to marry another man ; but she will prevent your marriage with the girl you care for.' And as she said it, there was the same toss of the head I had noticed before, and which, like the hair, seemed familiar to me, and a sort of sign passed between her and the man, for I saw him grin beneath his mask. What is more, I believe that Lady Crimson is in the house, if it was not Lady Crimson that played the gipsy to me.\" \" But you said that she spoke in broken English to you.\" \" No I didn't ; I said English with a slight foreign accent, which would have done credit to a good actress. It was perfect English, and English like Carrard speaks.\" \" Did you recognize the voice at all ? \""], [154, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 144 \" I don't think I did, though I've got a notion that it was not altogether a natural one.\" \" Why didn't you follow her ? If she be an emis sary of Lady Crimson, and if her principal be here, she is sure to join her.\" \" I am not so sure of that ; but on the off-chance, I did follow. I couldn't manage for long though, because there was such a crowd \u2014 she and her com panion disappeared in one of the boxes on the ground tier. Quick as lightning I made for the floor of the house, but there was no gipsy in a single one of the boxes. I am certain the fat is in the fire.\" \" Did she address you by your name at all ? \" \" Not once ; that's where she played her part so well. She was bent upon hoodwinking me into the belief that she was a real gipsy. No ; I look upon the whole of this as an absolute declaration of war on the part of that horrid woman, and if she can convince Martha of the enormity of my offence in going to Monte-Carlo, and what is worse, of going there in secret, I'll have a hard tussle of it.\" \" Nonsense ; Martha will forgive you if you tell her the reason why you kept it a secret. You know what Henri Heine said when the priest came to confess him on his deathbed, ' There is no need to trouble yourself, father, God will forgive me ; it's His business to do so.'

But there was no trace of the gipsy, though once or twice Frank fancied he caught a glimpse of her. All of a sudden he turned round to me and said, \" Old fellow, I have got an idea.\" \"What idea?\" \" If we could find Barsowsky, we'd find the gipsy.\" \"What makes you think so ?\" I"], [156, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 146 \" I don't know ; but why did not Barsowsky turn up here to-night ? \" \" You'll drive yourself silly with Barsowsky.

But how should Barsowsky know anything of your courtship of Martha Crimson. You did not tell him, did you ? \" Frank's face, which had cleared up at my first words, drooped again. At that moment the orchestra struck up a few bars of a quadrille, and at the same there was a cry of several hundred voices, \"Les voild, un peu de place, messieurs et dames.\" The promised cancan dancers from Paris had entered upon the scene."], [157, "CHAPTER IX. The Cancan, and what came of it. As if touched by a magic wand, the crowd divided and made, as it were, a lane for the procession to pass along. For it was nothing less than that. First came two gentlemen dressed in faultless black and white cravats, then a deputation from the Parisian jeunesse doree, at whose invitation the dancers had consented to appear, then the dancers themselves, four couples, each of whose costumes was a masterpiece of either grotesque or more sober fantasy, while the cortege was closed by another group of mashers, equally in evening garb. The moment the principal performers had taken up their positions, the crowd gathered around ; there was not as much as an attempt to make up another quadrille. The provincial dancers tacitly acknowledged the superiority of the stars from the Metropolis by abstaining from all effort at rivalry.

I don't mean to lose sight of Barsowsky.\" \" Where's Barsowsky ? \" \" In front. It was he who, with the manager. opened the procession. He has turned showman, it seems. I suppose the costumes selected with so much care were for one of the ladies of the quadrille. I shall join you in the box.\" Whether it was my fancy or not, but Frank's voice, usually so pleasant, sounded harsh. The why or wherefore I could not make out, but he had evidently a grudge against Barsowsky, because he suspected him \u2014 very illogically \u2014 of being impli cated in the mystification practised upon him by the gipsy.\" \" Don't get into a row, old fellow,\" I shouted, and wedged my way through the serried mass to the lobbies. \" Don't you worry yourself,\" I heard him say, \" I'll take care of myself.\" In a few moments I had reached our box ; the quadrille had just begun. \"Dancing is praying with one's feet,\" wrote Henri Heine. He could not have meant ordinary drawing-room dancing, such as we see it now-a days. He must have had in view the poetry of motion such as our fathers witnessed it when a Taglioni, a Fanny Essler held them spellbound"], [159, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 149 He may even have had in his mind the Terpsicho rean exploits of the Greeks \u2014 as distinct from their Bacchanalian revels. But he would unhesitatingly have approved of the performance we witnessed from our box on the Shrove Tuesday of 1889. In my youthful days I saw Rigolboche (otherwise Marguerite la Hugenotte), Nini aux Belles Dents, and Georgette la Provencale dance in Paris, what was then and what is now the much decried cancan. These young women were great artists, though they knew it not, perhaps. They danced with conviction. The eight per formers we saw that night were equal to the three just named. There was not the slightest sus picion of indecency or even suggestiveness about any of their figures. The much vaunted Goulue and Grille d'Egout were not among them. Who the dancers were I have never been able to find out, except with regard to one. I have a notion that they did not belong to the class from which the dancer at the Bal de l'Opera is recruited, but that is all I know. Their costumes were perfect, and the whole of their representation as masterly, that for a moment or two after they had finished there was absolute silence on the part of the spectators. Then a deafening shout of applause rent the house, and all was chaos. The dancers were carried away in triumph, and I beheld Frank, of whom I had not lost sight, struggling wildly to keep close to them. I could only guess part of his purpose \u2014 to get to speak to Barsowsky."], [160, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 150 I did not altogether feel comfortable, though I remembered Frank's last words : \" Don't you worry yourself; I'll take care of myself.\" He would not be so foolish as to provoke a scene without rhyme or reason, and simply because he suspected Barsowsky \u2014 on scarcely tenable grounds \u2014 of having had a hand in a joke frequently indulged at masked balls. Barsowsky was not to know that Frank's love affairs did not run smooth. No ; Frank would not be such a fool as to make a row. Somewhat comforted at the thought, I strolled leisurely through the corridors, when I met Caster gell. He looked very pleased. \" Well, my boy, that's something like dancing, if you like. I have never seen the famous Rigol boche ; you have, for I know that you spent part of your early manhood in Paris. What do you think of it ? \" \" It was very fine indeed, and, upon the whole, much more refined than anything Rigolboche ever did. It reminds me of the eight dancers that came to London once ; they were called ' Les Clodoches,' though their grotesque steps were coarser.\" \" Yes, I remember them ; but I remember also about fourteen years ago a young woman, both in Paris and in London.

I had all my work to do not to tell him, but I didn't. \" She was wonderful,\" Castergell went on, and that one dancer in the lovely crimson velvet debardeuse reminded me of her. There was the same swing, the same go, and something more. Tottie used to pretend to check herself when she was about to break out in her wildest pas, and to assume .a kind of puritanical, demure air, which was afterwards imitated, but very imperfectly, by a couple of music-hall performers known by the name of \"The Cures,\" who danced in quaker dress. This young woman has the same trick, but very much more finished. I wonder whether it is Tottie ? \" \" You say it was fourteen years ago that you saw her. It couldn't be Tottie. She must be an old woman by now.\" \"Not exactly an old woman, for she wasn't above eighteen when I saw her. At any rate, that girl in the crimson velvet reminds me of her. I should like to have seen her without her mask. I must go and look after my guests.\" With this he left me. I was glad Frank was not with me. In his present mood he would not have liked Lady Crimson mentioned even in terms of praise.

The keen sharp eyes were staring into space ; he was perfectly motionless. I have perhaps an uncomfortable knack of \"cottoning\" to the wrong people, but I had taken a liking to Carrard, so I shook his arm slightly. \"Aren't you well, Monsieur Carrard ? \" I asked. He started as if awakened from his sleep. Nevertheless, he had heard my question well enough, for he answered to the point. \" As well as a man can be who fancies he has just seen a ghost.\" \" A ghost ? \" I echoed in surprise, for Carrard was the last man I credited with indulging in such fancies. He noticed the tone of my voice. \" The ghost of a girl,\" he said with a wan smile. \" Of a pretty girl ? \" I asked, trying to cheer him up. He nodded wearily, and the tears started to his eyes. \" Too pretty for my peace of mind, whether as a living, breathing being, or as an apparition,\" he moaned. I saw that the man was terribly affected, that he could scarcely keep on his legs, so I took the matter seriously also. \" Let me give you a glass of champagne in the supper-room, that will put you right.\" And I offered him my arm."], [163, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 153 \"It is very kind of you,\" he said, ;ibut I would sooner, if you don't mind, drive home.

Two, perhaps three hours afterwards I was awak ened, and on opening my eyes, I saw Frank standing by my bedside.

Plenty of trains to Monte-Carlo,\" I muttered peevishly, turning round on to the other side, and preparing to resume the thread of my slumbers. \" I don't mean to Monte-Carlo, I mean to London.\" This time I was wide awake, and sat upright in bed. I stared at him with all my might. There were traces of grief and anxiety in his face, none of incipient madness. So I got excited instead. \" What do you want to go to London for ? \" I almost shouted. \" To forestall Lady Crimson's letter and machi nations with Martha,\" he said quietly."], [165, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 155 \" I don't understand,\" I remarked doggedly. \" Then you are more dense than I thought you were,\" retorted Frank, taking a chair by the bed side. \" Don't you know that the woman who was with Barsowsky is Lady Crimson, that it was she who enacted the gipsy, that it was he who was the toreador ! \" \" No, I don't,\" I answered somewhat more mildly. \" Nor do you.\" But while I was speaking, my admiration for Frank's powers of perception in creased.

As we were not in a desperate hurry, I hesitated to resort to such heroic measures, and we were about to retreat from the contest, when an unmistakably British, cheery voice hailed Frank. \" Hallo, Spelfield, we'll make room for you and your friend.\" We positively bundled in, notwithstanding the remarks of one or two Frenchmen that the English were treating the Alpes Maritimes as a conquered country. \" With this difference, monsieur,\" said Frank, \" that the conquerors this time pay the piper.\" The Gauls \" dried up,\" and we had time to look around us. \"Awfully obliged to you, Twentyman,\" said Frank to our deliverer in distress, and then I was introduced. \" Mary,\" said Mr. Twentyman, \" this is my old schoolfellow Frank Spelfield, of whom you have heard me speak so often.

But we often hear from one another indirectly, for we are bad correspondents both.\" The ice was broken, the train moved out of the station, and we sat down to a comfortable chat.

That the girl who had been partly the cause of Frank's journey should prove to be the sister of a school-fellow of his was sufficiently startling in itself, but that she should happen to be a friend of Miss Crimson also, and turn up at the crisis, was more startling still. \" How far are you going, Fred ? \" asked Frank. \"We are going to Monte-Carlo, where my intended wife is staying with her parents, who have taken a villa for the season.\" \" Then will you be married at Monte-Carlo ? \" \" No; at Mentone, at the English church ; but the wedding breakfast is to be at Monte-Carlo, and then my father and mother-in-law vaGate the villa in favour of us.

But before he could put it into words, the train entered the station, for we had been travelling fast \u2014 for that part of the world. The bride elect and her parents were there to welcome our companions, and we discreetly made ourselves scarce, after having appointed to meet that night after dinner on the terrace of the Hotel de Paris. To my great surprise Frank seemed not in the least anxious to go to the tables. Though we had still several hours to spare before dinner, he sat sipping some iced lemonade and smoking cigar ettes. He was very silent indeed. \" Aren't you going to win some of those carpets and things for your new house ? \" I said at last. \" I shouldn't win as much as a hearth-rug or a saucepan if I were to try now ; I'll ask Miss Twentyman to get the lot, and she will get it, you may be sure,\" came the answer. \" What do you mean ? \" \" What I say ; I'll ask her to play for me to morrow ; to-night there will be too much of a crowd, and you'll see if I am wrong or right.

I by no means approved of Frank's idea to ask Miss Twentyman to play for him. Like Captain Hawtree, I am not a particularly good sort of fellow, nor a particularly bad sort of fellow ; but with regard to women, I believe myself to be a great deal more of the former than of the latter. I should be sorry to curtail their enjoyment of certain small vices they have in common with us, such as, for instance, the ambition to become members of the School Boards, or of the County Councils, or of the House of Commons. I am even willing to look upon the axiom of Michelet : \" That which distinguishes man from woman, is tobacco,\" as a piece of old fogeyism ; but I draw the line at seltzer and brandy and gambling. I have never seen a woman at the tables in Monte-Carlo, Homburg, or elsewhere, whom I would willingly call mother, sister, wife, or sweetheart. Of course I am speaking of those who deliberately sit down or stand up to play.

Of course, they were my old acquaintances from the Journal A musant, and the Journal pour Rire, and the Vie Parisienne, my acquaintances from the Nouveau Cirque, in the Rue St. Honore, and the Eden Theatre in Paris, and similar establishments in London, my ac quaintances from Ouida's novels, and there was Lena Despard, who after all was not dead, but who had played a trick upon her husband, just to give Mr. Phillips an opportunity for a dramatic de nouement a la Victor Hugo.

They are all punting and watching their chances with a dogged perseverance that would have evoked the admiration of the late Mr. Smiles. Sycorax has evidently, in years gone by, tried to be less hideous than nature made her, for she wears a fair wig, albeit that she is past sixty. But the wig is all awry, and the rouge and pearl powder have been laid on with a carelessness that makes the wrinkled face look like a map, with the various frontiers washed in with elementary pink. She watches more than she punts, and notes every number of the roulette for hours before she ventures a five-franc piece. She has for years supported herself by play. It is true she lives in a small boarding-house, where she pays ten francs a day. Her dressmaker's, milliner's, and laundress's bills would I imagine, make the authoress of the pam phlet \" How to dress on 15/. a year like a lady,\" stare with envy. Compared to Sycorax's behaviour, that of Xantippe is kittenish, but she is more tidily put together. She also watches, but not for numbers. She lies in wait for novices, not to impose her system like the professors of whom I have already spoken\u2014 she has no system\u2014 but to"], [176, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 166 gamble on their hands. It is one of the supersti tions of the habitual punter, that the novice is sure to win at the outset. And , strange to say, he gene rally does, so Xantippe makes her little pile that way, for she rarely backs him the second, never the third day. But woe betide the novice should he disappoint Xantippe at the start. She does not for a moment hesitate to make a scene, which unless the novice be strong-minded, will fairly drive him from the rooms for the time being. He is her Socrates of the hour, and the way she goes for him makes people think that he is her legalized victim. Of course, if the man be a gentleman, he is utterly confused, and beats a retreat. He might apply to the attendants to remove her, but that would be making himself even more conspicuous than he is already, and he wisely abstains. On the face of it, the picking out of the novice from among a thousand players, argues a good deal of perspicuity on the part of Xantippe. Only on the face of it, almost any habitue of the rooms will do the same. But even Xantippe is mistaken now and then, as the following story will show. It happened a day or two after our return to Monte- Carlo, for I cannot observe a strictly chronological order in the record of my facts. A gentleman who had evidently come from a long journey \u2014 from Australia, probably \u2014 was walking round the tables ; the first glance revealed the man who had not only never been at Monte-Carlo, but probably never in Europe. He was bearded like the pard,"], [177, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 167 and his loose-fitting clothes betokened an utter disregard of appearances. He was scrupulously clean and tidy, but his garments were the reverse of fashionable and new. He had evidently just arrived. Our Xantippe fastened upon and clung to him like a barnacle to a ship, and verily she had her reward, for the stranger must have won six or seven thousand francs, and she must have made three or four hundred, which means a month's keep, and something above ; because though Xantippe is less slovenly than Sycorax, she does not waste her substance on silks and purple and fine linen. Xantippe had not had such a haul for weeks, and she made sure the luck would not extend over another day ; besides, her living fetish was not conversational, so at the stroke of eleven that evening she settled in her own mind to leave him alone next day. She did not, however, keep away from the rooms. I have known five or six of these women who have been at Monte-Carlo for ten or fifteen years, and who have positively never set foot at Monaco, and never taken a drive to the Corniche. Their Mecca and Medina in one is the Casino. The Talmud ists are never tired of vaunting the wisdom of Solomon, in imposing the penalty of staying in Jerusalem on Shimei. But for this warning, say they, Shimei would have never thought of leaving it. The perverseness of human nature, though, is such, that from that moment Shimei was mad to make an excursion. He might very well have"], [178, "168 We Two at Monte-Carlo. sent some one else after his runaway servants, but he did not, and so he perished. Solomon was not to blame. If Albert, Prince of Monaco, took it into his head to forbid these women to leave the principality, on the penalty of a heavy fine in case of their return, he would never gain a cent that way. The perverseness of human nature in their case is powerless against the attraction of the roulette-table. To return to the Xantippe in question, who, as usual, went to her avocations, promising herself not to be beguiled into backing the hirsute one. She did not even feel tempted, for almost the very mo ment she entered the rooms she caught sight of a new fanal \u2014 anglice^, beacon, and the consecrated term for the novice among the sisterhood to which Xantippe belongs. There was no more mistaking this one than the one of yesterday ; but what a difference between the two. Xantippe would have quoted Shakespeare to that effect, had she been as conversant with him as is Sycorax, who happens to be connected \u2014 no matter how \u2014 with the English theatrical profession. But Xantippe felt the differ ence if she did not express it, as she sidled up to the handsome, clean-shaven tyro in his perfect-fitting grey suit, his shapely boots and dazzling white linen. If Xantippe had been susceptible to the tender pas sions, her fate would have been sealed there and then, for the newcomer even smiled at her. Un fortunately he was standing not at the roulette table, but at a trente et quarante one. And he"], [179, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 169 looked like playing. The reader may or may not know that the smallest stake at the latter game is a louis, and Xantippe's trust in the vicarious reve lations of the goddess of fortune is, as a rule, not equal to that amount. Still she had a hundred francs of her gains in her small handbag, and to paraphrase Lady Macbeth, that which had made her drunk the day previous, made her bold to-day. The tailleur was droning \" Le jeu est fait, mes sieurs, faites votre jeu ;\" the stranger had taken a handful of gold from his pocket and had put it on the red, Xantippe added her quota in the shape of a louis, and the black came up. Aghast Xantippe stared. Was the world coming to an end ! She was about to speak when her \" beacon \" took out his note-case to get change. Oh, horror ! it was the note-book of the bearded one who had shaved and had taken to his London-made clothes, arrived that morning. \" The brute has let me in ; he shaved his beard off,\" she said loud enough for every one to hear. She did not make a scene, but the rooms knew her no more that day. Juno, Lai's, and Theodora play \"on their own hook,\" and probably without much of a system. When they state their losses to you, you should reduce the amount by two-thirds, their winnings you may reduce by seven-eighths, and by this means you will get an approximate idea of their opera tions. They do not go in for large risks one way or the other, though they will venture much further when losing than when winning. Of course"], [180, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 170 there are exceptions, but the rule holds good in nine hundred and ninety-nine cases out of a thou sand. M. Blanc's successors may say of them what Canrobert said of the English soldier, \" It is a good thing there are so few of them.\" There is no doubt about it, if female punters were more numerous than they are, they would constitute a serious danger to the bank. This weaker vessel, excitable, highly strung as she may be at ordinary times, is a great deal more fit to cope with the goddess of luck than the so-called lord of creation. She does not lose her head, nor is she discouraged, and her patience is marvellous. System or no system, she is, when face to face with the roulette-wheel, like Pope, \" She lisps in num bers, for the numbers come.\" I have seen thou sands of men, inveterate gamblers, who never use that small card, to be had for the asking at Monte- Carlo, by which one can see at a glance how the game has gone for the last few hours, provided one takes the trouble to keep a pen or pencil in hand. I have rarely seen a woman punter do without. When she loses, she takes things quietly ; she neither worries nor caresses wayward and fickle fortune, but like the knight in the Norse saga did with his bride \u2014 deals her a decisive blow at the opportune moment. And when once she is on the winning side, she carefully piles up her gold and silver piece by piece until the sum she means to realize be complete. After that, no power on earth could induce her to"], [181, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 171 stake another penny that day. On the other hand, she frequently stakes her last silver piece to arrive at the result she has set herself; butche is rarely, if ever, cleaned out. Why ? Because she has left some of her hoard at home. In the discussions that are of almost daily occur rence around the gaming-tables, women are seldom mixed up. When they are, the scene becomes a downright pandemonium, and knowing this, the most audacious \" money-snatcher\" will scarcely ever venture to stretch forth his hand for their stakes. They themselves, to their credit be it said, fight hard; but most of them \u2014 I might say all \u2014 are honest and straightforward. Pilfering and purloining form no part of their programme. Monsieur Wa gatha, the late Francois Blanc's brother-in-law, once assured me that during his many years' experience he had never caught a female thief. Nay more ; however hard up they may be, they never beg \u2014 they leave that kind of thing exclusively to Gret chen, flanked by Martha. But the gaming-room prowler, half thief, half punter, in his habit as he lives, deserves more than the fag end of a chapter."], [182, "CHAPTER XI. Autolycus. \u2014 The Croupier. \u2014 Cleaned out. The first thing that strikes the observant visitor is the apparent incongruity of having a vast apart ment like the gaming-rooms lighted by lamps instead of by gas or electricity, like the rest of the building. He puzzles over it, but rarely finds the real cause of this deviation from the rule. Lamps have been substituted at Monte-Carlo for gas, as a precaution against thieves. Civilization, which hailed Lebon, Winsor, and Murdoch, as benefactors to humanity for giving additional security to the belated wayfarer by means of their invention, had to confess years ago at Homburg that gas was a two-edged sword for the prevention of robbery. After two or three unsuccessful attempts, a certain Count de Montvilliers suc ceeded in tampering with the meter (he had a confederate), and one night the whole of the room was wrapt in Stygian darkness during more than a quarter ofan hour. He made a rush for the till in front of the croupier, and got away with a bundle of notes. Next day gas was discarded both at Wiesbaden, Baden-Baden, and Homburg, and was"], [183, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 173 never lighted again during Blanc's tenancy. In Monte-Carlo, I believe, the gas is not even laid on in the gaming-rooms. Of course the thing could not be brought home to him, so De Mont villiers strutted more than ever in his magnificently embroidered uniform, supposed to represent the undress regimentals of a Mexican general officer. Not at Homburg, though. Montvilliers intended to repeat the experiment, but the telegraph was too quick for him. When he got to Baden-Baden, he found old lamps for new ones, and not liking that version of the magi cian's bargain, he decamped after a few days, and made himself scarce for more than a twelvemonth. When he reappeared at Homburg, his own mother would not have known him. At any rate, Francois Blanc and his satellites did not. Then he be thought himself of a different combination. It was never known how he managed it, but one night he hid himself under a couch. When every one was gone and the rooms locked, he lighted a bull's-eye, and provided with a pair of pinchers, tightened all the reds. Having done which, he quietly made his exit by a window and awaited the dawn of what was to be his Austerlitz. It proved a Marengo reversed. During the whole of the day, scarcely a red turned up ; the chief superintendent of the game was surprised, and it takes a good deal to surprise a gentleman like that. Before eleven o'clock had struck he had found out the secret of this plethora of blacks, but he wisely held his"], [184, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 174 tongue, for it wjuld not have done to raise an alarm. The weakness of any director of a Kursaal when face to face with such shady gentry as De Montvilliers, lies in his (the director's) anxiety to prevent a scandal. The fraternity know this, and act accordingly. The greatest mishap that can befall them is to be ignominiously ejected. To gentlemen this would be a terrible thing, to them it means little or nothing. It never transpired whether M. Blanc was com municated with at the moment of the discovery, and whether the subsequent revenge was of his suggestion. The presumption, as I shall point out directly, is the other way. De Montvilliers had won fifty thousand francs that day. Contrary to Blanc's oft-repeated advice, he encamped on his position and returned to the charge next morning. He had four looks for his money ; in less than a quarter of an hour he was cleared out, having staked the maximum (twelve thousand francs) each time. Then he began to look about him, and discovered that he had absolutely been hoist with his own petard. The blacks had all been tightened. It has already been stated that the chief super intendent of the game, astonished at the wonderful series of blacks, had discovered the fraud before the stroke of eleven o'clock on the previous night At the same time he had recognized De Mont villiers. When the rooms were closed, he remained"], [185, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 175 and did for tbe blacks what the cheat had done for the reds. Did he consult his principal ? I think not. If he had, the chances would have been a thousand to one against Blanc discoun tenancing such a proceeding. To have done other wise would have been tantamount to placing him self in the power of his employes. Apart from the risk of their splitting upon him, what would prevent them from tampering with the roulette wheel a second time, and for their own benefit, by having a confederate among the crowd. We have heard before now cleaned-out punters cast a doubt upon the strict accuracy of the wheel. We may take those ravings for what they are worth. The roulette-wheel is adjusted on abso lute symmetrical principles. There is not the slightest deviation possible. While on the sub ject, I may add that those grumblers and accusers invariably belong to one nation \u2014 the one which in 1870-71 made Europe resound with the cries, \"We have been betrayed ; we have been sold.\" We may go further still and unhesitatingly affirm, that if among the employes there was one with sufficient skill to direct the ball to any ap proximate point, that employe would be dismissed. Once for all, the thing is not worth discussing. We will not be so positive about trente et quarante. Doubtless manipulation of the cards might be resorted to. But is it likely that the director of a Kursaal commanding a wonderful enterprise for coining money, wonderful in that the"], [186, "176 We Two at Monte-Carlo. results are mathematically in his favour, would condescend to make an accomplice of a mere subordinate ? No ; the honesty of the principals and the em ployes at Monte-Carlo is above suspicion, as it was at Homburg, Wiesbaden, and elsewhere. There are romantic legends about ruined gamblers having taken their seats at the same tables that encom passed their downfall, as croupiers and tailleurs. The late Bishop Wllberforce propagated similar legends once with regard to unfrocked Catholic priests having taken their seats on the boxes of the Paris hackney cabs. Monsignor Rogerson took a good deal of trouble to contradict his Grace, and with the aid of irrefutable statistics, it was proved that during a quarter of a century there had been one individual who had exchanged the cassock and shovel hat for the glazed headgearand many-caped coat of Jehu. The late Davelouis (of Spa), B^nazet, Blanc would have simply roared at the idea of putting a ruined gambler into such a position of trust, and their successors have as yet not dis covered that the nature of the ruineu gambler has changed sufficiently to admit of their disregarding their predecessor's caution in that respect. To the historian or poet, a Napoleon, a Crom well, a C\u00e6sar is a hero, a demi-god or a monster; to a Cuvier or an Owen he is merely a vertebrate animal. To the outer world the banknotes and gold piled up in the tills in front of the croupiers represent so much wealth, pleasure, ease, freedom"], [187, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 177 from care, to the latter they represent so much dross. The liveried attendant in the gaming-rooms, who is in receipt of the magnificent salary of 150/. a year, finds a thousand-franc note in a corner, dropped in his haste or excitement by a lucky gambler. He merely hands it to the superinten dent of the rooms, who puts it aside until it is claimed, and if not claimed by eleven at night, reports the find to the general manager. Because, first of all the thing has no value to him or the finder in the sense we attach to it. Familiarity with money has absolutely bred contempt for it. Secondly, they are by no means sure but that it may have been dropped purposely by an emissary of the management, while two or three or perhaps half a dozen other emissaries have been set to watch as to how it will be ultimately dealt with. I have it on the highest authority, however, that during the whole of M. Blanc's regime at Monte- Carlo there has not been a single dismissal among the higher or lower employes for dishonesty. And it should be remembered that the croupiers and tailleurs, with whom I am chiefly dealing here, handle for several hours each day sums which in the aggregate amount to more than a hundred thousand pounds a week, that there is not, that there cannot be a system of checking them, that the whole of this money is entrusted to the unquestionable, unquestioned sense of honour of themselves and of their superintendents. A story supplied to me by an unquestionable N"], [188, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 178 authority will illustrate how justified is the faith of the management in their uprightness. A few years ago a celebrated conjuror gave several per formances at the Casino at Nice. Two of M. Blanc's employes happened to be on a holiday and witnessed a representation, which in the matter of slight of hand was truly marvellous. When they came home, they forbade their wives to take the children, and furthermore, waited upon M. Wagatha next day, requesting him to issue an order for bidding any and every croupier, or their sons, going to see the wizard. M. Blanc's brother-in-law looked puzzled. \" I cannot see the harm of being amused in that way,\" he remarked. \" To ordinary people there is not,\" was the answer ; \" but we do not wish our sons or our colleagues to become more deft in the manipulation of money or cards than is necessary for our duty.\" The whole of the staff applauded the step taken by their brethren. There are one hundred and sixty of them, and with one or two exceptions, perhaps, they are the sons, nephews, or younger brothers of croupiers, whose names were household words amongst the habitues of Frascati, Homburg, Spa, and Wies baden. \" Their sons and nephews will be croupiers after them,\" I was going to write. I have just seen on the London hoardings the announcement of a terrible war to be waged by the righteous against the ungodly, as predicted by Holy Scripture. It is to take place in '94. If the"], [189, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 179 former are victorious, there may be an end ot all croupiers. My faith is in the Providence of big battalions, as such I fancy that there will be a great demand for croupiers ; but I will not prophecy on the strength of my faith. At present, however, there are eight score of them living at La Condamine, whence they are conveyed in carriages to Monte-Carlo at half-past ten a.m. every day. They constitute not one, but two castes, though not to the outer world. The best paid and enjoying the greatest consideration among themselves are the tailleurs at trente et quarante. Even the management observes a certain distinction between them. They are desig nated by them as les Messieurs du trente et quarante, while the others are simply les Hommes de la roulette. They are the best of friends. The tailleur will go and smoke a pipe with the croupier ; but the former's \" lady\" does not visit the latter 's spouse. Each table is presided over by six croupiers or tailleurs, superintended and assisted by a chef de partie, who generally sits behind the one who turns the wheel or deals the cards. It is the chef de partie who verifies each morning the sums of money allotted to each table : 50,000 frs. for roulette ; 200,000 frs. for trente et quarante. He is, moreover, consulted in all misunderstandings between the bank and the gamblers, difficulties not of their own making, but provoked by the irrepressible \" Vincent de Paul.\" The founder of the order of the Lazarists who roamed about the N 2"], [190, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 180 streets of Paris in search of lost children, has lent his name to the individual who prowls round the gaming tables in search of momentarily forgotten stakes. With this difference, that the latter often insists upon taking the money from the rightful owner against his will, in which case the chef de partie is called upon to interfere. As a rule he settles the contention by looking at both claimants, and gives his decision in favour of the party whose face is unknown to him. Vincent de Paul knows this to his profound sorrow, and for many years he has been puzzling over Shakespeare's sentence, \" God gave them one face, and they made themselves another.\" He thinks that the bard of Avon was utterly lacking in truth and humour in this instance, because he has not succeeded as yet in accomplishing that transforma tion. The other day there was a difference of opinion with regard to the ownership of a dozen louis. A gentleman, an unmistakable gentleman had put three louis on black ; it turned up, and he left them. Black turned up a second time, and he was preparing to leave them once mere, when a hand was stretched forth towards them. The rightful owner of the money stopped the hand in mid-air. \" I beg pardon, this money belongs to me,\" he said. \" Not at all, monsieur, you are mistaken ; it is mine,\" was the answer. \"There can be no mistake about it, monsieur. I am certain that it is mine.\""], [191, "We Two at Monte- Carlo. 181 \" But I am certain also, and I think it somewhat strange that \u2014 '' At that moment the chef de partie turned round. \" That will do, monsieur,\" he said to Vincent de Paul, \" every one knows that the money belongs to this gentleman.\" It reminds me of a story recently told by Mr. Montagu Williams in his book. Justice Lindley, the first day he took his seat on the bench, was worried by a turbulent counsel raising objection after objection. \" Overrule them,\" said a brother judge. \" I always do.\" After luncheon the tur bulent one returned to the charge. \" I overrule your objection, and I shall overrule every one you may make,\" was the quiet remark of the chairman. If the chef de partie could shut up the Vincent de Paul as easily as that, his life would be more pleasant ; but he cannot. The latter is as full of tricks as an egg is of meat, though he avoids coming in contact with the chef if possible. He attacks an outpost improperly defended, by which I mean a player standing, not seated, between the foot or head of the table and the centre, con- sequently removed from the immediate watchful care of the chef. Nor does he always attack violently or for any large amount. The big stake is absolutely the cynosure of all eyes, and is furthermore specially kept in view by the croupier. It would not do to snatch at that. If the rightful owner did not intercept the hand, the croupier would."], [192, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 182 I may give an illustration of Vincent's proceed ing by what I saw one day. The individual in question had been watching a big punter who staked handfuls of louis on the colours, and successfully. In gathering up his stakes, not a single gold piece got astray. This went on for more than twenty minutes \u2014 the punter was having a good time of it. Rendered careless by his success, he at last allowed two of his louis to roll from the red on to the impair (odd) in gathering up his money. Vincent's eyes almost started from their sockets, but he did not budge. He merely bent over the table and took up a rake. Up comes twenty- seven, and the two louis grow into four. The punter is absolutely ignorant of what has occurred, but the croupier at the foot of the table has his eye on Vincent, who still does not stir. The next time the revolution of the wheel brings a nine, and the four louis grow into eight. Not a hand is stretched out towards them, though the croupier locks significantly at their owner, who has no notion that there is some property of his going a-begging. Up comes fifteen, and the eight louis are increased to sixteen. Then Vincent can hold out no longer, and while the croupier s eye is averted for a moment, he stretches out his rake . . . No, not at all, he simply whispers something to the punter who smiled and gathers up the money. The croupier smiles also at the thought that this brand has at any rate been plucked from the burning. Five"], [193, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 183 minutes afterwards punter and Vincent retire into a corner, and in two minutes more I see Vincent shake hands effusively with punter, and leave the rooms with a light and elastic step. Punter is an Englishman, and I do not mind accosting him. So when he comes back to the table, I say, \u2014 \" Do you know the individual you were speak ing to just now ? \" \" No. He felt inclined to play, but his wife, to whom he had promised not to do so, came into the room when he least expected it, so he asked me to pick up his winnings and give them to him on the quiet, and I did.\" I confess I had not the heart to enlighten the unsophisticated Briton. Besides, genius like that deserves reward. Of course I ought to have left this story to the last, for I have absolutely nothing to cap it with ; still one or two of the minor tricks are worth recording, such as, for instance, that employed by the prowling professor of palmistry. He operates only when the roulette is in full swing, when pretty well every number, every square, and every colour is covered with heaps of notes and gold. He appears to be debating on which number to place his five franc piece, which he turns over and over again in his hand until the ball is fairly set spinning. His mind is not made up yet, for he glides his coin along the numbers in the sight of every one. At last it is planted somewhere, at the top if his hand travelled from the bottom, at the bottom if his"], [194, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 184 palm proceeded in the opposite direction. If his number comes up, which is thirty-six chances to one, he is all right, if it does not, he curses his bad luck aloud, and walks away. No one has noticed that his palm is covered with some sticky substance, and that in its journey along the line two or three louis have adhered to it. The most common or garden trick requires neither skill nor ingenuity, merely a certain a mount of \"cheek,\" and a tremendous amount of patience. Autolycus has to watch for hours \"wisdom and blood combating\" in his body, wisdom councelling abstention, blood urging him to strike one blow for gold. He is waiting for some lucky punter to leave a fraction of his win nings on the board through sheer carelessness, or for an inexperienced one to neglect picking up the whole of his, having mistaken the number or colour announced by the croupier. He timidly extends his rake, he puts out his antennae, as it were, sweeps the coins into a little heap, looking around all the while, and if this tentative assertion of ownership provokes no counter-claim, he gathers up the money and his day's work is done. Thus far those who work in the dark, who at tack the bank or the player by stratagem. There are others who deliver their assaults openly, such as for instance the Italian who the other day put a thousand-franc note on the red at trente et qua rante. The tailleur deals thirty-one to the black, but he has barely announced the point, when"], [195, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 185 quick as lightning our punter snatches back his note, saying as loud as he can, \" I never play on that accursed point,\" and runs away. Of course they let him go. Neither the croupier nor the chef de partie cares to make a disturbance. The latter simply reports the thing at headquarters, and if the man returns and is recognized, he is politely requested to retire, but not while he is standing at the table. An attendant will come up and tell him that there is some one at the other end of the room who wishes to speak to him, but who does not want to leave his seat lest he should lose it. Our man falls generally into the trap. If he does not, two of the doorkeepers to be on duty during the evening and next morning, are quietly called in, and he is pointed out to them within his hearing. That has generally the desired effect. The standing order for croupiers, tailleurs, and chefs de partie is de ne pas faire du colon, in other words, \" to raise no dust,\" and there is literally no instance on record of their having disobeyed instructions. This statement not only applies to their behaviour when the interests of the bank or of its patrons are at stake, but equally when they are personally insulted, as happens frequently. I have heard curses showered upon them, heard them compared to every villain under the sun. For the unlucky punter often holds the croupier or tailleur directly responsible for his ill-luck, the same as the lucky one beams upon him and sends him little presents in the shape of a dozen or so of cham-"], [196, "186 We Two at Monte-Carlo. pagne, or a box of cigars. Barsowsky used to be great at sending champagne. I only found this out casually one day ten years ago, when I was watch ing his play at trente et quarante. The banknotes were disappearing with frightful rapidity and mo notony. The tailleur, a nice, honest-looking old fellow, seemed very much concerned, and every now and then I saw him shake his head, as much as to say, \" Don't play on my hand to-day, I have got a terrible fit of bad luck.\" In about an hour Barsow sky was completely cleaned out, for the time being. It did not make much difference to him. As it was about four o'clock ; we had some tea and cigarettes in the quadrangle. \" If it be any consolation to you, I must say that the tailleur seemed very sorry to see you lose.\" , \" Yes,\" said Barsowsky, \" I had a lucky day a week ago when he was dealing, and I sent him two dozen of champagne.\" I am certain that the old fellow was grateful, but that it was neither gratitude, as we understand, nor as Johnson defined, it, which made him so dis consolate at Barsowsky dropping his money. He had merely become Barsowsky's friend, and a \" sympathetic attendant upon his fortunes,\" though he was virtually on the other side. It reminds one of Chodric-Ducos, an ardent legitimist, who in the Revolution of '30 scaled the barricades to teach the republicans how to fire. \"You are aiming so confoundedly bad,\" he said, taking up a rifle."], [197, "We Two at Monte- Carlo. 187 \" That's the way to do it,\" he went on, bringing down a linesman, and a second, and a third, and a fourth. The republicans applauded, and begged him to go on. \" No, I can't very well,\" was the answer, \" I merely wanted to show you. You see, I am on the other side.\" The croupier and tailleur, there is no doubt about it, must have bought up the stock in trade of Griselda, for in many cases there is an absolute contempt, on the gambler's part, for their finer feelings. It is no uncommon thing to hear one punter say to another, and not in a whisper, \" Don't play when that animal is dealing, he is sure to bring you bad luck.\" But though equally patient and polite, there are croupiers and croupiers, tailleurs and tailleurs. None, we may be certain, have any enmity to the gambler upon whom, on the contrary, they invari ably look as a species of half lunatic worthy of commiseration rather than of contumely. But they are not equally sympathetic, for all that. The most pleasant croupier to the public at large is the steady, composed middle-aged one, who isa respecter of all persons, who is neither stolid nor effusive ; the least likeable is the Don Juanesque one, who poses for the female gallery, who is curled and pommaded, and wears a diamond ring on his finger, who toys with the cards or with the ball, who ogles the women, who uses his wiles upon her Grace, though she be sixty, in preference to using them upon Gretchen (such a Gretchen as we mentioned"], [198, "188 We Two at Monte-Carlo. already), though she be twenty. But if there be no Grace, he will put up with Gretchen, and Gret chen has no fear of compromising herself. Should Martha object to her being seen with such a Faust in public, the answer will be ; \" Find me such another Faust ; he made me win ten thousand francs yesterday.\" For Gretchen also believes in the occult power of the croupier to make or mar her financially."], [199, "CHAPTER XII.

We had just finished dinner on the night of our return to Monte-Carlo, and were going downto that nice, cool, marble-flagged gallery to have our coffee and to keep our appointment with the Twentymans, when all of a sudden there was a general stampede. There was a rumour that some one had hanged himself at an adjacent hotel, the name of which, for various reasons, I prefer to keep to myself. I do not think it fair to blame Monte- Carlo for the suicides committed there, and least of all to reflect upon the hotel-keepers because madmen damage their furniture and walls by tak ing their own lives in the rooms put at their dis posal. I hold no brief for or against Monte-Carlo and its hostelries, and I am not like the solicitor who refused to defend a friend, but offered the next best thing to it, to prosecute him. The report turned out to be only partially true. When they entered the room, attracted by an un usual noise, they found the would-be suicide sitting on the floor, the rope still round his neck, and the staple attached to the rope. The fellow had come"], [200, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 190 to the conclusion that life was still worth living after he had kicked away the chair, and in his frantic struggle, the staple had come out of the partition. Some amateur coroner returned a ver dict of \" Wilful resurrection whilst in a state of unsound mind.\" Most of the company returned, disappointment written on their faces. Not at the fool's life having been spared, but at the fact of the rope proving useless as a fetish. They had not rushed away to be in at the death, but to secure a bit of the rope for a consideration, of course, for luck, because it is a well-known fact that hotel proprietors do retail the ropes with which people have hanged them selves. I advisedly say \"retail,\" seeing that they have evidently no ambition to become wholesale dealers in that article, and invariably refuse to allow a discount for taking the thing in bulk. In fact there is a story on record of a hotel-manager at Ems entering the room of a fellow who had hanged himself, and exclaiming, \" Thank goodness the rope is a long one.\" Not that the fellow owed him anything, or that he meant to keep the proceeds of the sale to himself. He conscientiously remitted the same to the sorrowing relations minus a commission, and it is said that he wound up his letter by, \" Your future favours are respectfully solicited.\" As it happened, the idiot who had given us this after-dinner sensation was not at all cleaned out. He had won a goodish sum in the afternoon, and"], [201, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 191 had between 5000 and 6oco francs upon him. The story is so utterly absurd, that I hesitate to tell it, lest I should be accused of exaggeration. Nevertheless, religious excitement had something to do with it. He had been told by some kind clergyman \u2014 and this is an absolute fact \u2014 that Providence especially marks out the successful gambler for perdition. He could not withstand the temptation of trying to fathom Providence's intention with regard to himself. I abstain from further comment. While on the subject, I may endeavour to give the reader a notion of the different species of \" cleaned out \" gamblers that have come within my ken. They are by no means all alike, either as regards their behaviour or their plans for recouping themselves. The following may, how ever, be taken as a general rule, with scarcely a single exception. The professional gambler, when cleaned out, does not attempt his life. He knows that to-morrow, or the day after, or in a week there will be a chance of borrowing a few louis of an exceptionally lucky punter, and curiously enough his landlord or landlady shares this faith with him \u2014 I am speaking exclusively o the landlord or landlady at Monte-Carlo. They do not worry him for his bill, and they have their reward. When their lodger manages to borrow or to beg a few gold pieces, he religiously puts aside the amount of their claim ; if there be anything over, he tempts fortune at the other end of the"], [202, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 192 room. If there be not, he goes home first and pays up to the last cent \u2014 and then borrows a louis for luck. What is more wonderful still, the borrowed louis generally proves lucky, and the lender gets his share in the shape of a little present. Seeing that he or she is debarred from entering the rooms. there is a kind of satisfaction in getting a small percentage of the spoil. A gambler of that kind was once pointed out to me ; he had been in an intermittent state of im pecuniosity for the last ten years. All the employes knew him, and what is more, they knew when he was going to play. He had a special suit of clothes, of which he was very careful, and which he never wore except on those occasions. I made use just now of the words borrow or beg. It was a slip of the pen as far as the form of the application is concerned. The habitually impe cunious punter does not beg, he borrows. The formula is invariably the same : \" I expect some money to-day or to-morrow. In fact, I cannot un derstand the delay, and I have wired to that effect. There must be something wrong. I'll feel obliged if you will lend me half a dozen louis until I get my remittance.\" Eight times out of ten he fails to get the temporary accommodation, but he succeeds now and again. Dives and Lazarus at the gaming tables are not as Dives and Lazarus elsewhere. To the successful punter, who, moreover, is not a professional one, a few gold pieces are of very little"], [203, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 193 moment at that particular time, in fact money has an altogether fictitious value at Monte-Carlo. The following is authentic, and told to me by a friend. A few days after his arrival at Monte- Carlo, there was something the matter with his watch. While waiting to have it attended to, a gentleman entered the shop. He had evidently seen the proprietor before, because he nodded to him with a certain familiarity. The tradesman, however, seemed reluctant to acknowledge the acquaintance, and looked a perfect blank. Seeing which, the gentleman took from his pocket a large watch, elaborately engraved, and apparently very heavy. No wonder ; it not only recorded the hours and minutes, but the month, the day thereof, and a number of other things. \"You do not remember me,\" said the gentleman, noticing that the tradesman was still staring. \" I bought this watch here a few days ago, and I find I shall have no use for it. I should like you to take it back again.\" The tradesman's face got harder and harder. He thought he remembered, but was not certain, &c, &c. At any rate, he did not care to buy things back again. The gentleman insisted ; he was evidently very hard up \u2014 cleaned out, probably. \" Well, if I do so, it is simply to oblige you,\" said the tradesman, beginning to handle the time piece. \" I can give you a hundred francs for it.\" \" A hundred francs ! \" exclaimed the other. \" You 0"], [204, "We Tw0 at Monte-Carlo. 194 charged me twelve times that amount for it a few days ago.\" \" Possibly, monsieur,\" was the answer. \" But you see this watch records so many things, and people get worried with it.\" The gentleman took the money. I must plead guilty to an oversight. I have never ascertained whether there is a pawnshop conducted either on the Continental or English system at Monte-Carlo, but \" Attenborough, thy name be blessed \" under any circumstances. No ; money has but a fictitious value to the lucky punter, especially if, as I observed, he is not a habitual gambler. He gives magnificent dinners in the hour of his prosperity, treats friends and acquaintances, and even strangers. Lazarus is not left at the gate, but is invited inside, and at the dessert there is generally a little scene which I recommend to the daring playwright. \" I can't make out how you manage to be always losing,\" says the successful one. \"You must be playing very carelessly. I have not lost a single day since I came, and I am sure that with a little bit of method . . . .\" As a rule the other does not answer. He merely looks his interlocutor straight in the face, and smiles. He remembers the story of a sailor being stuck in the saddle in a small steeplechase on the Continent. He managed to win the race, though he had never been astride a horse in his life. Next day all the amateur jockeys took out"], [205, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 195 boats ; not one of them returned alive to read the burial service over the others. It is generally at the end of the dinner that the successful one is appealed to for the loan, which he grants, though he fosters no illusions as to the recovery of the money. Truth compels me to state that the borrower has illusions as to its repayment. There is not a soul in the wide world who would send him a remittance, still he expects it. If the reader does not believe me, let him interview one of the post-office employes at Monte-Carlo. He will tell him that not one, but a score of those poor wretches come down everyday as regularly as clockwork to ask for their letters. Of course there never are any. Such relations as they happen to possess have given up corre sponding with them long ago. Still, they go to the post-office, and when the usual answer is given to, or rather snapped at, them, they depart with drooping heads, muttering to themselves, \" Strange ; there must be something amiss. I can't understand it.\" They have got to believe in their own hallucinations. Assuredly, truth is stranger than fiction, and once in a blue moon there does come a letter. The reaction at the news is simply terrible. In some parts of the Continent a registered letter has still to be fetched from the general post office a notice to that effect being sent to the residence of the person to whom it is addressed. Until lately, the regulation obtained at Monte- Carlo. O 2"], [206, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 196 About five years ago there was such a letter for one of the most persistent and ever-disappointed inquirers, and the postman, who had known him for ever so long, meeting him in the street, handed him the slip of paper without any pre amble. The man stared for a moment or so at the official, then he dropped down, and before help could be got, died. There was more than sufficient money to bury him. The more tragic episodes in connection with the habitually stranded one are, however, rare enough. As I have already stated, he does not commit suicide, but generally dies in the hospital, and as he has had no enemy but himself, as he is thoroughly honest and inoffensive, in contradis tinction to the professor and the prowling money snatcher, he is not altogether without friends to soothe his last moments, to bring him creature comforts, and to give him a few francs for his other small wants. The croupiers themselves are frequent visitors to those veterans and invalids of the field of cloth, and give them such news as may interest them. Not long ago one of the latter was dying, the doctor had given him a fortnight, three weeks at the utmost. He had managed to scrape together about fifty francs. His disease was not a painful one, but he was doomed, and he was not afraid of death. \" Three weeks, three weeks,\" he muttered. \" I shall not live as many days. Before midnight I shall be gone.\" Then he turned to his visitor, who happened to be an inspector of the"], [207, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 197 gaming-rooms, \" Are you on duty to-night ?\" he asked. \" Yes ; but why ? \" \" I wish you to do me a favour. I know you are not allowed to play yourself. Here are fifty francs ; get some one to put them a cheval between ten and eleven at half past ten exactly. I know one of the two will come up. You need not bring me the money, for I shall be gone. Take it to the marble mason, and have a stone put over my grave. There will be nine hundred francs ; it will not cost so much. The rest may be spent in a monthly mass for the repose of my soul. Wait a minute. I will tell you what I want on it. Ci-git le Chevalier de Kersa?ig, un blanc, que le rouge a perdu. Rien ne va plus.\" The request of the dying man was complied with, and the eleven did come up. He breathed his last about twelve o'clock that night, murmuring : \" Rien ne va plus.\" For the benefit of such readers as are not familiar with French, I may explain that un blanc means a legitimist, un rouge a communard, or something like it. De Kersang had followed the fortunes of Charles X., and never went back to France alive. A royalist gentleman who heard the story, had the body transported to St. Brieuc, in Brittany, De Kersang's native town, where the stone may be seen in the grave-yard. The comic sides to the vagaries of the \" cleaned out\" one are generally supplied by the mere novice, though I am bound to confess that even"], [208, "We Tsvo at Monte-Carlo. 198 there the laughter provoked leaves a bitter taste. I gave a hint just now to the enterprising play wright for the subject of a scene. I would recom mend some of our best actors, who so often go to Monte-Carlo, to study from nature the effect of being ruined, temporarily or irretrievably. As a matter of course, the manifestations and ex pressions vary according to the moral, mental, and even bodily constitution of the victim. The most amusing of all, perhaps, is the would be stoic, who is generally a bad imitation of the grand seigneur of no matter what nationality. The latter takes his losses quietly, because from his very infancy he has been taught not to make himself conspicuous in public. Sham stoicism, however, is in practice the reverse of evil ways. It is not the first but the last step that is most difficult. The sham stoic will for a long while remain taciturn, apparently unmoved. Apparently only, for those who watch him carefully will not fail to notice a twitching of the lips, a quivering of the nostrils, a clenching of the hands. Speak he will not, provided one leaves him severely alone ; but woe betide you at the most casual and innocent remark. He will turn round upon you like a savage, and positively swamp you with half an hour's talk, amidst which there is the ever re curring sentence : \" I never say a word when I am losing, I wish other people would do the same.\" The above is the more or less comic collapse of"], [209, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 199 the sham stoic ; then there is the \"cleaned out\" gambler, whom I cannot class, not being sufficient of a psychologist. He has remained perfectly calm throughout, not a muscle of his face has moved until the rake of the croupier has swept up his last note. He has been thoroughly wide awake all the while ; of a sudden he seems to fall into a trance. He walks away, staring vacantly into space ; he claims neither hat, coat, nor umbrella at the cloak-room, but marches straight before him. That is the kind of gambler whom the door-keepers and employes are specially told to watch, for unless the reaction sets in in a very few hours, there is an end of him, either mentally and morally, or else bodily. In other words, he goes mad if he be of a sluggish temperament, he commits suicide if he be of a nervous one. Consequently, if he be noticed, he is taken care of, accompanied to his hotel, and given in charge of the manager. If needs be, his bill is paid, and a return ticket provided for him, no matter how much, or rather how little he may have lost. Both the management of the Kursaal and the hotel keepers are anxious to keep their names out of the papers, and especially out of the English ones, in connection with such accidents, though the former no longer pursues its erstwhile system with regard to suicides. M. Blanc, who invented it, was obliged to confess at last that it was too expen sive, and what was worse, that it did not prevent scandal."], [210, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 200 It was at Homburg that he invented it. There had been a positive epidemic of suicides. It is impossible to say in how far the splendid forest at about a mile and a half from the town had con tributed to the spread of it, but there is no doubt that it was a most poetical spot to die in. At the beginning of this century there was a staple em bedded in one of the vaulted passages of the Hotel des Invalides (the French Chelsea Hospital). In less than a month seventeen veterans suspended themselves from that staple. The authorities had it removed, and the epidemic ceased. Be this as it may, the suicides in the wood at Homburg were very frequent, and M. Blanc felt worried about them, for the papers said that these people had killed themselves because they had lost everything at the tables. At last Blanc set some one to perambulate the glades and the thickets, and when an individual was found with a hempen cravat round his neck, or a bullet through his heart, the watchman quickly reported the affair to the management, who, towards nightfall, sent some one with five hundred francs in gold to slip into the pocket of the suicide. In that way people could not say that he had killed himself because he was \" cleaned out.\" They attributed the thing to disappointed love, to family trouble, not to ruin at the gaming tables. All went well for a week or so ; but Autolycus and \" Vincent de Paul \" got wind of the stratagem,"], [211, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 201 and began watching too, so that in a very short time the same stories got abroad. They merely rifled the pockets of the deceased, for it often happened, especially later on, that there were three or four to share the spoil, which they loyally did. Still, M. Blanc would not give in. He not only continued to provide the money, but set some of his people to watch the bodies, from a distance, of course. One morning, not only the money, but the body was missing. It had been found with its waistcoat open, its shirt stained with blood, and a pistol by its side. The money had been slipped in the pocket of the overcoat. The fellow had not as much as a scratch, and had simply walked away. Then M. Blanc saw the folly of the proceedings. To return for a moment to the different species of gamblers. There is the cynical gambler who, when his last louis is gone, utters a long, low whistle, turns upon his heel, smiling at everybody. It is a very bitter smile, though, which I should not like to see on any one's lips I care for. There is the other one who does not smile, but sneers, lights a cigarette, puts his hands in his pocket, and surveys the whole world, from the steps of the Kursaal, a la Rochefoucauld without possessing the genius of the latter to coin maxims. The management is always willing to provide him with his return ticket ; they are more frightened of him than of any other species. He will trump up some story and get hold of some shady journalist to publish it."], [212, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 202 Enough, there is an almost infinite variety, and it was among these that Frank seriously contem plated asking Miss Twentyman to sit down and gamble for him."], [213, "CHAPTER XIII. We get the furniture for Frank's house. Frank kept his word, and notwithstanding my entreaties, asked Miss Twentyman that same night to play for him on the morrow. Neither her brother nor she herself seemed to mind doing so ; and she promised to be at the Hotel de Paris at a quarter to eleven, in order to commence operations the moment the rooms opened. All, Fred Twentyman's bride included, seemed to look upon the experiment as a vast joke, though it was arranged that both the men should remain behind the girl's chair all the while. They all abstained from play that night, though they wandered through the rooms watching the players, Miss Twentyman and her brother, to whom the scene was absolutely new, feeling particularly interested. Twentyman's bride being an American, had long before this tried her luck, and was going to expound a little system of her own for the guidance of her sister-in-law, but Frank begged her not to do so, he having decided upon giving Miss Twentyman his own instructions next morning."], [214, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 204 As for myself, I confess to having felt oppressed, uncomfortable, foolishly uncomfortable. If the worst came to the worst, there would be not much harm done, seeing that Frank had, before we started from London even, apparently made up his mind to lose everything, or to \" go a buster,\" as he expressed it. As it was, he had considerably more than the sum with which he embarked upon his journey, for though we had been away for nearly three weeks, and had by no means stinted ourselves, we had spent but little over 70/. between us, including our tickets. Frank had close upon 1000/. in his pocket, while I had sent my first winnings to London, and had still hardly broken in upon my capital. Consequently it was not the possible loss of the money that worried me, though I could not help asking myself why Frank could not be satisfied with the sum he had already, which would have been amply sufficient to furnish a house, even if Miss Crimson had not possessed a penny of her own. Such was by no means the case. Though I had never asked the question, I had heard that her income was something over a thousand a year, which she could not very well forfeit whether she married Frank with or without the Lord Chan cellor's and Lady Crimson's consent. There might be a deal of litigation ; Frank might be imprisoned for having abducted a ward in Chan cery, or something of that sort, but nothing of all this was the cause of my uneasiness. Curiously"], [215, "We Two at Monte-CArlo. 205 enough I felt at the same time that if I had been in Frank's position, I should have done exactly as he did ; that, having gone to Monte-Carlo in obedience to a dream, I would have tried my utmost to realize it \u2014 or have failed ignominiously. The 250/. he had won, constituted neither failure nor success, there was little doubt about that, and with regard to his engagement with Miss Crimson, he was in a worse position than when we left London, if what he surmised was true, namely, that Lady Crimson had discovered his journey to Monte-Carlo, and was moving heaven and earth to estrange the young people. Could she do this, albeit only temporarily ? I did not know the woman, but I felt instinctively that she would have tried, and perhaps succeeded under ordinary circumstances ; that she might have coerced the girl into marrying some one else, and that notwithstanding Frank's pretended apathy, this would have been a severe blow, from which he might have recovered in the end, but which would have left him stranded for many years. From the very beginning of our acquaint ance I had taken a great liking to Frank. Two or three years of almost daily intercourse had changed the liking into a sincere and heartfelt, albeit not very demonstrative friendship. There are men who, however much attached to one another, are apt to look upon love troubles as not worth sympathizing with. They will stand by one another in commercial and financial collapse ;"], [216, "206 We Two at Monte-Carlo. the loss of a near relative or a parent by their friend will call forth the warmest proofs of affection, they will tend and comfort him on his bed of sickness ; but should this same friend be jilted by the girl for whom he cares most on earth, should his wife give him cause for jealousy and make a wreck of his life, they will scarcely conceal their apathy about the whole matter. To them love should be a l.ors d\u0153uvre in man's existence. I am not one of those that think so. I fully agree with the great German thinker who said : \" There is but one joy in this world \u2014 love. Who soever misses that, misses everything.\" Hence the moment Frank confided his troubles to me, the moment I perceived that beneath the husk of his assumed indifference there was a deep-seated affection for Martha Crimson, I, as it were, made his cause my own. Lady Crimson became as much my personal foe as if I, and not Frank had wanted to marry her step-daughter. And when on the morning of the Opera ball, fate or accident \u2014 call it what you will \u2014 seemed to point me out as the Deus ex machina of this imbroglio, I ac cepted the call eagerly, determined to fight my friend's battle without troubling him with the preparations for the struggle. I had felt confident enough since then ; I knew I should be able to strike the decisive blow when the time came, that I had the power to defeat any and every conspiracy of Lady Crimson and the Candleburys against my"], [217, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 207 friend's marriage. Almost from the commence ment of our journey I had looked upon myself as an instrument in the pecuniary realization of Frank's dream ; nay, as the destined participator in its benefits. But up till Ash Wednesday morning I had laughed at myself in my soberer moments for this presumption ; after that I laughed no more, albeit that I felt certain that that part of my aspirations might be dismissed. The meeting with Miss Twentyman in the train, and her turning out to be a schoolfellow of Martha Crimson, only strengthened my confidence in the other part I was to play, and by the time we arrived at Monte-Cailo, my plan of action was settled. We should not merely be on the defen sive, but on the bold offensive. Unknown to Frank, I had sent two telegrams to London. I was awaiting the answers to both, and the sus pense added to my discomfort, though it was not its main cause. It was the anxiety before the battle that made me fidgety. At half past nine I slipped away from my companions for a few moments and went back to the hotel. The tele grams had been sent at two. The order conveyed in one would take some time to execute, the reply of the second was to a certain extent dependent upon the execution of that order. Both replies were there, and I breathed more freely, aibeit that the most difficult part of my task was as yet to come. I am not clever at disguising my feelings, and"], [218, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 208 Frank noticed my anxious look when the Twenty mans were gone. \" Anything the matter, old fellow ? \" he asked- I had a kind of inspiration. \"Yes,\" I said, \" some unexpected claim upon me which I thought was done with ; but it is not. I must find five hundred pounds in about a week.\" \" Why in a week, when they are in my pocket ? \" said Frank, opening his note-case, and handing me the amount. I did not want five hundred pence, but I pre tended to be overwhelmed with gratitude, and took the money. I remembered M. Blanc's word to Garcia, \" I have got three thousand francs,\" &c. That money was safe from the vicissitudes of the roulette wheel. Besides, it might be wanted if Lady Crimson showed fight. We were up betimes in the morning, and at a quarter past ten, stood waiting for Miss Twenty man and her brother. Then I found how sensible my precaution had been in getting possession of the 500/. Frank was madly anxious to venture the whole of his remaining capital, within a few pounds as much as he had given me the night before. But I prevailed upon him at last to give Miss Twentyman 5000 francs in gold wherewith to tempt fortune. I accordingly went to the banker, and changed notes to that amount, putting the newly-coined louis in a bag. I had my reasons for this also. I have before now seen a snatch made at the piles in front of the player,"], [219, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 209 and by preference, of the female player. Of course the thief is arrested, for the fear of provoking a scandal does not deter the authorities in such a case. But nine times out of ten they catch the thief, while the confederate escapes with the spoil amidst the hurly-burly. When I came back, the Twentymans had arrived. Frank's instructions were very brief: \" This is the capital with which you are to get me the lease of a nice little house in one of the suburbs, and its furniture. Never put more than one gold piece on a number, and no more than two on a column or a dozen. On the even chances you may put as much as you like. When the bag is empty we leave off, because the winnings are not to go into it. The only other thing I will ask you is to put two louis on number twenty to begin with. I believe in you and your luck.\" We tried to laugh, but somehow we all felt very serious ; perhaps I felt more serious than the rest, though I did not show it as much. There was scarcely any one in the room, conse quently no difficulty in getting a seat. I need not recapitulate all the incidents of that four hours' gamble, for that was its duration. I will only recount the start, the putting of the two louis on number twenty. I have had many moments of excitement in my life, but they were mild in comparison with that one, during which I watched the little ivory ball spinning round and round. When the croupier announced \"twenty,\" 13"], [220, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 210 I felt ready to shriek, and I went away un perceived by Twentyman or Frank. At the same time I felt certain that Frank would get his house and furniture. The thought to use Miss Twenty man as a \" beacon \" for my own benefit never entered my mind ; if it had, I should not have dared to act upon it. I have already told how women gamble, and it appears that Miss Twentyman was no exception to her sex. Instinctively she fought the enemy inch by inch, when once she had taken his measure. At one o'clock I cast a glance at the table in ques tion, and saw that she was still seated there, conse quently the two hundred and fifty louis were not gone, though from the conditions Frank had arranged, it might mean nothing, seeing that I did not know how much he had gathered in, or whether he had gathered in anything at all beyond the first seventy louis won on number twenty. I had not the pluck to inquire. For he was not only to take the winnings, but the original stakes that had produced them. I went away and ate my luncheon in solitude, had my coffee on the terrace, and made a pretence of looking at the papers, though I am afraid I understood very little of what was in them. I could not possibly say how often I glanced at my watch during the next two hours ; but tt'hen the clock stood at five minutes to three, I could hold out no longer, and crossed the quadrangle in search of the trio. They were still in their"], [221, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 211 original position, and it seemed to me that the two hundred and fifty louis had held out a long while. I stole very softly to Frank's side, and nudged him in the ribs. He merely turned round, and said, \" Hush, we are at our last two louis.\" I noticed that the empty bag was in Miss Twenty man's hand. Then there was that particular whirring sound of the little ball. I did not know where the two louis had been put, but in another moment I saw Frank rake up a heap of gold and notes. The croupier had called out twenty. Miss Twentyman got up without saying a word, and we three followed her out of the room in silence. She was perfectly composed, and I rapidly calculated that out of the two hundred and fifty louis a hundred and forty-four had found their way back to Frank's pocket. So I was scarcely prepared for her solemn, \" I shall never play any more at roulette.\" The girl was evidently frightened. I thought the tension had been too much for her. We slowly went down the steps, silent still. It was Frank who spoke first. \" You had better have a glass of champagne, Miss Twentyman. You are tired, and it will revive you.\" \" I think I had better,\" she said, attempting to smile, \" for I feel as if I shall faint.\" We sat down on the terrace of the hotel. I ordered the champagne, for they all seemed as if in a trance. I was dying to know the results, and I dared not ask. P 2"], [222, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 212 When the wine was uncorked, and the waiter gone, Frank, who saw my anxiety, said, \u2014 \" It's all right, old fellow, but I am afraid it is too much all right. It is my own fault that the dream is not realized, for if I had had the pluck I might by now have something like seven or eight hundred a year. As it is, I do not suppose that there ever was such a run of luck. From eleven till on the stroke of three, when you came in, there were seventy-three coups played. With the exception of five, they were all in the middle dozen, and there was not a single one by which we lost. Number twenty came up eight times. The first and the last, both of which you saw, brought a hundred and forty louis ; the six others which we also backed, two hundred and ten ; so that makes three hundred and fifty louis clear gain. Miss Twenty man played very carefully ; she often backed a transversale, or a quarre, and it invariably proved right. Even her little ventures of half a louis on pair, and impair, manque z.no\\ passe were successful. I do not know what I have won, but we will look. Fred has got the notes, I have the gold in my trousers' pocket. Fred, how much have you got ? \" \" I have got two notes of 1000 francs, six of 500, and a whole bundle of 100 franc ones,\" answered Twentyman. \" That's part of the proceeds of number twenty turning up,\" said Frank, rising from his chair and carefully turning both his trousers' pockets inside out on the marble table. The chink of the gold"], [223, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 213 made some of the people look round, but they are used to that kind of thing, and took no further notice. Fred Twentyman's \" whole bundle \" consisted of ninety-two notes of 100 francs each. Frank's store of gold, when he had emptied his waistcoat and breast pockets, amounted to seven hundred lotus, and I wondered how he had borne the strain of the weight. In round numbers Frank was 900/. to the good on the day. When we had done counting, Frank said solemnly, \" I shall play no more while we are here. I will not stake so much as a five-franc piece.\" There was no mistaking the tone of Frank's voice, the sincerity of his resolution. Success had done for him what failure does for others. He looked utterly crestfallen. Foolish as it may seem, he was firmly convinced that some occult power \u2014 and not in the sense that people generally apply to the term \u2014 was intervening specially in his affairs. If I had doubted this, his next sentence would have dissipated my doubts. \" Lucky in play, &c, &c,\" he said, \" you know the rest ; and honestly I should like to see the end of all this.\". Miss Twentyman and her brother looked at him in surprise. They knew nothing of the machina tions of Lady Crimson, of her attempts to estrange Frank from his sweetheart. I felt particularly anxious to enlighten them, and Frank gave me an unexpected opportunity."], [224, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 214 \" If you will excuse me,\" he said, \"I have some letters to write, and after that I will lie down a bit. I feel worn out with this excitement.\" With this he rose. \" I do not thank you for your share in the proceedings,\" he said, turning to Miss Twentyman. \" I have only one more favour to ask, namely, that you will be Martha's bridesmaid, if she marries me ; that is, if you are not married long before then.\" And he walked wearily inside. Miss Twentyman looked puzzled, and glanced at me inquiringly. I left her no time to ask a question. \" I will tell you everything, or if not everything, as much as I can. You have got Frank his house and his furniture. You will have to help him get Ids wife.\" \" His wife? \" echoed the girl. Then, without divulging Lady Crimson's pedi gree, I told them how she was trying to force Martha into a marriage with young Ephraim Candlebury by making the most of Frank's journey to Monte-Carlo, and so forth ; how utterly alone Martha stood, because she was surrounded by a lot of canting zealots, with whom she had nothing in common, and who professed to object to Frank because he was a man of the world, but who, in reality, wanted Martha for their son because she was an heiress. The girl was shocked beyond expression. \" I tell you what, Fred,\" she said, turning to her brother, \" I will leave for London on Sundav morn-"], [225, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 215 ing, and go to Martha myself. Mr. Spelfield is a gentleman, and she shall marry no one else if I can help it.\" I had gauged Mary Twentyman's character aright. \" There is no need for you to go London, Miss Twentyman. Martha will be here to-morrow afternoon, together with your father and mother, to whom I took the liberty of wiring. If you can give her shelter for a few days until the storm is over, the sky will be clear afterwards, and for ever as far as Lady Crimson and her fellow-conspirators are concerned. But Frank is not to know.\" \" Is she not a ward in Chancery ? \" asked Twentyman. \" That is just it. Frank is not to be implicated. I have taken the responsibility upon myself, and you may be sure that I shall not expose you or yours to any danger or unpleasantness.\""], [226, "CHAPTER XIV. I get the wise for Frank's home. The events of the next few days need not be told at length. Martha arrived at Monte-Carlo on the Friday afternoon in company with Mr. and Mrs. Twentyman. We had taken care to get Frank out of the way, which was not difficult, seeing that I had written to Carrard and Major Cas tergell to come and join us. Bohemian as was the latter, he kicked a little bit at first at Carrard's society, but I managed to convince him that the Frenchman was not as bad as he was painted, and I furthermore told him that his presence might be necessary to me in my scheme for furthering Frank's happiness. That decided him, though I told him no more. Castergell is a thorough good fellow and would have consented to almost anything \" for the son of Frank Spelfield's father,\" as he put it. My greatest difficulty lay with Miss Crimson, who would insist upon seeing Frank, until I pointed out to her that if it were possible to prove in a court of justice that Frank was aware of her coming to Monte-Carlo, it might mean two years'"], [227, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 217 imprisonment for him. She turned very pale and dropped the subject. After that, she promised to remain virtually a prisoner in her rooms until I liberated her, and I took Mr. and Miss Twentyman in my confidence to a certain extent. There was, after all, a kind of romantic glamour over the whole thing which eminently interested this charming old couple, who fancied they were enacting parts in a comedy in real life. Of course, Martha went neither to Mentone to see Fred Twentyman's wedding, nor was she present at the breakfast afterwards, which took place at Monte- Carlo. I consigned her to the care of Castergell, who showed her the gaming-rooms and took her for a drive while Frank was proposing \" the health of his college chum and his charming bride.\" I had calculated to an hour almost the bursting of the storm cloud, and I was not mistaken. The first thunderclap came about nine on Saturday night in the shape of a telegram addressed to Frank, and worded as follows : \u2014 \" Lady Crimson wishes to see Mr. Frank Spelfield on urgent business, and will call upon him at twelve on Sunday. Reply, Prince of Wales Hotel, Cannes.\" \" What am I to say ? \" asked Frank, significantly handing me the slip of blue paper. I sent for a form and wrote : ' Mr. Spelfield will be pleased to see Lady Crimson at the hour mentioned.\""], [228, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 218 \" That means war,\" said Frank \" Perhaps,\" I replied. \" I have got a notion that you will have a bloodless victory, if you will let me fight by your side.\" \" What can you do ? \" \" A good deal, probably ; but at any rate, promise me that you will let me be present at the inter view.\" \" If you wish it, with all my heart.\" I prepared for the battle by engaging a private room next to our bedrooms. At ten minutes past twelve next morning while Castergell and Carrard were talking to us, two cards were brought up ; those of Lady Crimson and Sir Ephraim Candle bury. Castergell and Carrard wanted to leave, I pre vailed upon them to go into my bedroom, which led out of the sitting-room, and locked the door upon them. I did not want Carrard to overhear anything, which he might have done by accident, if he had been alone. I put the key into my pocket, and carefully lowered the little porcelain shield over the aperture. On the other side of the door I had done the very reverse early in the morning. One glance at Lady Crimson's face showed me that she meant fight. I was unable to read Sir Ephraim's intentions in his features. The wealthy City Knight had best be described by the Scotch boy's answer when he was asked what sort of man Adam was, \" I guess he was like any other man.\""], [229, "We Two at Monte- Carlo. 219 I had posted Frank in what he was to say with regard to my presence at the interview, but had said no more. Lady Crimson accepted the ex planation with perfect composure. \"Your friend's presence,\" she said, \"will make no difference to what I have got to say finally. But before I say this, you will perhaps be kind enough to inform me where Miss Crimson is ? \" Frank turned pale. \" Miss Crimson is at Stamford Hill, I suppose,\" he stammered. \" Miss Crimson is not at Stamford Hill. She left there on Thursday morning, ostensibly to join me, and in spite of my express commands that she should not come to Cannes. She has not joined me. Where is she ? \" This time I answered, \u2014 \" Miss Crimson is with friends, and it is at my advice that she left Lady Crimson's house.\" \" At your advice ! And pray what gives you the right to interfere ? \" shouted Lady Crimson. \" I must ask you not to shout,\" I remarked gently. \" There are two gentlemen in the next room, M. Francis Carrard, who, though a French man, understands English as well as we do, and Major Castergell, an old friend of Mr. Spelfield. My words had produced their effect ; Lady Crimson turned ghastly pale and began to tremble in every limb. Frank stood like a statue, looking at me and at Lady Crimson in turns. Sir Ephraim was the first to speak."], [230, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 220 \" Of course,\" he said, turning to me, \" you know the risk of the step you have taken ; the removal of a ward in Chancery out of the jurisdiction of the Court without the Chancellor's consent.\" \" I know all about that, Sir Ephraim,\" I answered, \" even if Miss Crimson's solicitor has failed to make the application, which he is not likely to do, after what I wrote to him.\" I was telling a deliberate falsehood, but Lady Crimson fell into the trap. \" And what did you write to him ? \" she gasped. \" I would sooner read you a copy of the letter by yourself, if Sir Ephraim does not mind taking a stroll with Mr. Spelfield for a few minutes.\" Lady Crimson guessed part of what was coming, though not all, and when her companion looked to her for his cue, she merely bowed her head. Frank had almost become an automaton, but he had just sufficient sense left to see that I was on the winning side. When the door was closed behind the two, I drew up a chair opposite Lady Crimson's, took out my pocket-book, and ostentatiously put down a faded photograph on the table, face upwards, but she was too far away to be able to recognize it. \" I am afraid,\" I began, \" that I was guilty of an untruth just now. The letter to the solicitor has not been written yet, but it will be written, or, if"], [231, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 221 not, the main facts it would have contained will be used by me in my defence for having removed a ward in Chancery from under your roof.\" She seemed to breathe more freely. \" I have no idea,\" she said, \"what you could bring forward to justify your enticing away Miss Crimson from under my roof.\" \" I could plead that the lady who goes to a masked ball with a strange gentleman, and who indulges in the most outrageous cancan, is not the fit custodian of a young girl.\" \" You found that out,\" she sneered. \" You would have to prove the dancing, and the accusa tion with regard to the strange gentleman would miss fire, if the strange gentleman happened to be the lady's intended husband.\" \" Not if the lady were married already.\" \" What do you mean ? Every one knows that Sir Joshua Crimson is dead.\" \" You were married before that.\" \"There is no more doubt about Samuel Mel ford's death than there is about Sir Joshua's.\" \" You were married before that.\" \" No, I was not.\" \" Yes, you were. You were married before that to Francois Carrard on the 17th of July, 1875, in the church in the Waterloo Road.\" \"It is a lie!\" \" It is the perfect truth,\" I said, taking up the photograph and showing it to her, though I held it"], [232, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 222 firmly fixed in my hand. \" That is your portrait, and, though I do not wish to flatter you, thirteen years have dealt very leniently with you.\" Then turning it over, \"'Jessie Lincoln (Tottie Lola), to her dearly-beloved husband, Francois Carrard, on the first anniversary of their wedding (17th July, 1876).' It will be difficult to deny this in a Court of Justice, especially if we prove that you married Samuel Melford and Joshua Crimson under the same name. The Court will not be hard on one who took a young girl from the custody of a woman who committed bigamy, who went through the form of a third marriage, and who was ready to go through the mockery a fourth time, if we had not stopped her.\" The woman would not give in. \" My first husband is dead. There are more Carrards than one. It may be his brother,\" was the defiant cry. \" Would you like to be confronted with him ? He is in the next room. There may be a mistake on my part.\" And I rose as if to open the door. \" For God's sake, don't ! I give in. Make your own conditions. But save me from that brute ! \" was the wail. I offered her my arm, and led her softly down stairs, where we joined Frank and Sir Ephraim. Her first words to the worthy knight settled the question."], [233, "We Two at Monte-Carlo. 223 \" I am afraid, Sir Ephraim, that these young people love one another so much that it would be wicked to interfere.\" Frank and Martha and Lady Crimson left that same afternoon for Cannes, leaving me alone in my glory. On the title-page of my little book will be found the ticket I took out the following day for myself. Frank's dream has come true in every detail. A month later Lady Crimson married Count Bar sowsky at the Russian church in St. Petersburg Place, Bayswater, and Frank was present, together with Miss Twentyman. I kept Lady Crimson's secret faithfully. I had not the slightest com punction about sacrificing Barsowsky and Carrard. Between a scandal and the enlightening oi Bar sowsky, which might have meant the reinstatement of Carrard as the rightful spouse, I did not hesitate for a moment. For three months afterwards I had frequent letters from Carrard inquiring whether I had found any traces of his wife. My conscience smote me a little now and again. Then I received an invitation to Carrard's wedding. He has married a Brazilian or Mexican countess, and they started immediately for the bride's native land. There is a smart rat-tat as I write these last lines. It is Mr. and Mrs. Frank Spelfield's cab. They have just come back from their honeymoon.

Dr. Spelfield was smiling a moment ago as he read over my shoulder. Old Mrs. Spelfield cried, and kissed me on my forehead. And Frank gave me such a grip that I could not offer my hand to his young wife, and could certainly not defend myself against being embraced by her on both cheeks. THE END.
