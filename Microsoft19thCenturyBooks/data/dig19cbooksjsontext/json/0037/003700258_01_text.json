Sandy, Mr. Stewart the minister of Clovenford's only son, was to be a minister like his father and grandfather, who had both wagged their heads in pulpits before him. Second sight had seen him in a Geneva gown and pair of bands from the time he wore long-clothes and bibs. With this great end in view, many a day Sandy came in fear and trembling from making bour-tree mills on the Hare Water, and playing shinty with his sister Jess and the neighbouring farmers' sons on the country roads, to construe his C\u00e6sar or his Sallust in the minister's little brown bedroom. Fifty years ago, Mr. Stewart was a Tory and an autocrat in rusty black, walking over his parish, not unlike Dr. Johnson, in snuff-brown, taking a turn down Fleet Street. The minister had made a love marriage. Mrs. Stewart had been an orphan, with a very slender patrimony \u2014 a parlour boarder of the Miss Allardyces, the old ladies who from time immemorial had kept the boarding-school in the neighbouring town of Woodend. Mr. Stewart had met his fate at a Woodend subscription ball, when it was B"], [14, "2 A SPRIG OF HEATHER. customary for ministers to carry to balls their white neck cloths and silver shoe-buckles as a testimony in favour of innocent enjoyment, and as a protest against Dissent and Jacobinism. There he succumbed in a single evening to Miss Jean Clephane's dancing, though he did not dance a step himself. The marriage was a happy one. Mrs. Stewart paid the minister loving homage as the greatest and best of men, and called him lord and master to the extent of keeping her bedroom scrupulously free for his study, and spending the choicest of her accomplishments in needlework on the plaited frills of his shirts and the openwork of his bands. In his turn, Mr. Stewart was tender to his wife, brought home what he supposed her taste in gaudy caps and spencers, as connubial gifts, on the striking of the fiars and the meetings of Presbytery, Synod, and Assembly ; took notice of her pets, her flowers, her work \u2014 for Mrs. Stewart was almost as great in knitted bed-covers, tent-stitch worked chairs, and cambric flowers, as Mrs. Delany. He also humoured her in her habits, squiring her three even ings a week in summer, when she walked with her shawl over her head to the Kames, to see the sun set behind the Beld Law, until the servants and the country people called the beaten footpath through the corn and the clover, \"the Minister and the Leddy's Walk.\" The manse children consisted of Sandy and Jess ; and it was a common remark with regard to the two, that Sandy should have been Jess, and Jess Sandy. Sandy was not a scapegrace and a numskull. He was a bonnie laddie, very like his mother both in her sweet, fair, sunshiny face, and her sanguine, sensitive, imaginative temperament. He was a shade thoughtless as regarded a divinity student in prospective, with a greater bent for drawing on the margins of his books and copies, and every scrap of paper he could come by, wonderfully faithful tran scripts of \" the hills, and woods, and streams around \" Clovenford, and clever comical likenesses of the master his schoolfellows, and his acquaintances, than for severe reading. But his father was persuaded that sedateness and appli cation would come to Sandy with riper years ; and except in one instance, when he punished the lad with austerity for"], [15, "WHAT SANDY WAS TO BE. 3 depicting the manse cat with a pair of bands round its neck, holding forth from a water-stoup to the cocks and hens, and the rats peeping from the stacks in the glebe yard, calling the sketch a profane and scurrilous jest, he did not trouble himself much about Sandy's shortcomings. Sandy was the apple of the minister's eye, secretly ; while, openly, the father addressed the son by the comprehensively disparaging corruption \"min\" \u2014 a term which, in Scotland, with the alteration of one letter, converts the honourable appellation \"man\" into an ostentatiously condescending and slightly contemptuous soubriquet. \" Oh, min, is that all you're good for ? \" \" There was more lost at Flodden, min.\" It was true Sandy would have worked a more wonderful sampler, and proved a meeker and more gracious woman than Jess, for whom, with a spice of chivalry, all Mr. Stewart's outward favour was reserved. As for Jess Stewart, she would have responded splendidly to her father's wishes but for the trifling accident of having been born a girl, coupled with the Apostle Paul's prohibition to a woman. She would, with grace, have made a fine min ister \u2014 frank, straightforward, imperative, with a passionate tongue when she was roused ; having a real relish for the solid study of history and geography, in opposition to the practice of the spinnet and the execution of satin pieces in the Miss Allardyces' course of instruction. But there was nothing unwomanly or repulsive in Jess ; on the contrary, as she outgrew the boisterousness of her childhood \u2014 wherein she distressed her mother by playing more uniformly at boys' games (Sandy in his tender years took up with an old-fashioned, hard-featured doll, Jess's rejected property), and destroying three times as many clothes as Sandy \u2014 there was the prospect of her growing up a woman of noble proportions. There was a charm in Jess's fresh, candid, intelligent face \u2014 her short, thick, black curls in a crop about her brow and neck ; her tall, broad shouldered, firm, erect figure \u2014 at least equal to that of Sandy's bright blue eyes, sanguine complexion, and slight but active, long, elegant limbs. Jess was the young queen of the parish, and the position lent her an ease, a power, an air of born authority and command which became the girl, and which did not leave her when she passed from"], [16, "4 A SPRIG OF HEATHER. the yeomen's houses to those of the gentry, where she could claim no precedence of birth and breeding, and where, on the other hand, her best cloth mantle and white muslin frock were homely and out of date. Young Adam Spottiswoode, of Birkholm, his own master, who opened the balls at Woodend, would rather dance a reel with the minister's than a minuet with the member's daughter. Jess could dance minuets, too ; a little French dancing master, a poor emigre, had imported the true Minuets de la Cour, and put them at the service of the public of Wood end ; but Jess's reels were something inspiriting. Again, Jess, with the few old and ailing men and women who were \"on the box\" (that is, parish paupers), with bairns, with her mother's endless train of calves, chickens, dogs, cats, pigeons, laverocks, linties, was also \"beyond com pare.\" Jess, carrying a stray lamb in her arms, or a broken winged bird in her bosom, showed unmistakably whether she was womanly \u2014 that is, motherly \u2014 or no. Clovenford kirk and manse, with moss, lichen, and weather-stain doing something to redeem the barn and bothy order of architecture, lay in a nest of wooded and bare hills. The parish did not have the grander and more distinctive features of Scottish landscape \u2014 neither the height nor the breadth of savage mountains and moors, where the eagle rears her bloody-beaked young, and \"the whaup cries dreary.\" But it had the Fir Tap and the Beld Law, the Hare Water and the Den of blackthorns and whitethorns, crabs and geans, ending in the feathery birks and stiff dark-green boxes and hollies round the old white house of Birkholm. The fields were all heights and hol lows, sunshine and shade, like dimpled faces. There were hedges tedded with dogroses and honeysuckles ; water courses yellow with_ kingcups ; seal-dykes nodding with harebells, and twittering with the swallows nestlino- beneath their eaves. At Clovenford manse the servant lasses still span and sang ballants every afternoon, on the bink by the kitchen-fire in winter, and at the back-door in summer. Andro Cornfoot, the minister's man, lived with his deaf wife and his catecheesed laddie, the minister's herd, in the thatched cottage at the manse offices, came to the house every evening, and was present with the family at \" the worship,\" when the minister commended his house, people"], [17, "5 WHAT SANDY WAS TO BE. kirk, country, and the world to the care of the Great Creator. Andro came again at sunrise to awaken the lasses, and to speak in at the minister's window and tell him what the weather was like, never thinking to avert his light grey-green fishy eyes from the nightcap, broad-bordered, and with a large bow right over the forehead, which bore the picturesque Kilmarnock cowl loving company on the pillow. The cloud, the size of a man's hand, in the Clovenford sky began with the expenses of Sandy's college terms ; notwithstanding they were met without flinching, bravely borne, and that every member of the family took a part in defraying them. The minister trudged many a long and weary mile to do duty at neighbouring kirks and canonical meetings, in . place of hiring a gig from the Crown in Woodend. Mrs. Stewart gave up much of her visiting, for the reason that she was delicate and unable to accom pany the minister in his long walks. Jess could walk with the best, and thought nothing of crossing the parish, six miles from one end to the other, and dancing half the night afterwards ; but Jess was called on to resign all the little advantages and enjoyments such as even the farmers' daughters could claim. These were her going to Edin burgh and lodging with her Auntie Peggy, the writer to the signet's widow, in the High Street, and there learn ing to bake pastry and cut out patterns for her gowns ; and her attending the dancing and singing classes for grown-up ladies and gentlemen, opened every winter in Woodend. The very table at the manse was rendered plainer aud more frugal on Sandy's account. The box which travelled every fortnight with the carrier to Edin burgh, seemed to carry away all the dainties. Mrs. Stewart relinquished her little cup of tea in the morning, pro testing she found it bad for her nerves, and made a fashion of supping porridge along with the minister and Jess. The minister denied himself his bit of Stilton cheese and glass of Edinburgh ale after dinner, pretending they made him sleepy. Jess had to be more sparing in preserv ing the fruit, though it was hanging in abundance in the garden, and the whole cost was the sugar ; and to substi tute for the old home-brewed wines, the currant, ginger, <_der-flower, and elder-berrv \u2014 welcome cordials to the sick"], [18, "6 A SPRIG OF HEATHER. of narrow means, who knew no better \u2014 the still humbler beverage of treacle beer. At first all these sacrifices, regarded as temporary in their nature, were made light of. But as sessions came and went, and Sandy brought home no honours, got no bursary to ease the burden, no private teaching, except once a summer tutorship, they pressed more heavily. The fact was, that young Sandy Stewart, in the most critical years of his life, in place of settling down to hard head work, was flightier and more prone to trifling \u2014 as it was regarded at Clovenford \u2014 than ever. He showed him self addicted to company ; not bad company \u2014 a true son of the manse could not at once have degraded himself so far without great moral corruption \u2014 but to free mixed com pany, the company at harvest-homes, fairs, and the clubs, in which Woodend aped more famous places. Gentlemen of higher degree than the minister's Sandy \u2014 the young Laird of Birkholm, for instance \u2014 and even ladies, the eccentric old dowagers and spinsters of the period, fre quented these scenes blamelessly ; but no one of them was to be a minister \u2014 a Presbyterian divine, whom a single breath of scandal was sufficient to blast. The word was not widely applied then, but Sandy was tainted with Bohemianism. And the lad was still fonder of making facsimiles of the rural and genial life, inani mate and animate, he loved ; the very materials a waste of money, and the practice, which might have been amusing enough to his family in other circumstances, miserable child's play in a lacking divinity student. Lines of care began to be drawn on Mr. Stewart's full massive face. He left off, with scornful magnanimity, inquiring into his son's progress in his classes, when the result was invariably disappointment ; but he suffered his tongue to scoff bitterly at the degeneracy of the times, and the effeminate puppyism of \" birkies \" who put their pride in tying up their hair with ribands, and sporting tights and silk stockings. The ribands at least were cheap, and the stockings were a fond transfer of the last pair of six-and-thirty shillings' worth \u2014 a present to Mrs. Stewart, in handsome discount from the gallant old bachelor, the true kirk man, in his snuff-brown wig and purple rig-and-fur stockings, whom"], [19, "WHAT SANDY WAS TO BE. 7 she called genteelly her \" merchant \" in Woodend. Mrs. Stewart would ten times rather see the stockings on Sandy's legs than on her own, that for once she might have the pleasure of looking on her bonnie laddie in the guise of a fine gentleman, as gentlemen at the Queen's levees and State footmen still figure. It was neither just nor generous in Mr. Stewart to taunt Sandy with his mother's silk stockings, and to add the gratuitous reflection that puppies neither cared where their indulgences came from nor to what they led ; but the minister's big heart was sore. On the other side, Sandy had a hasty as well as an affectionate temper, and was in constant danger of rebut ting unfair aspersions, and speaking back to his father words ill-considered and in the circumstances unjustifiable. Mrs. Stewart, moving gently about in her little apple green shawl, filled in with what manufacturers and women call \"pines,\" and the cap of her own netting as fine as gossamer, a light cloud about a face still fair and delicate \u2014 too fair and delicate for her years \u2014 was kept with both body and mind on the rack, acting as a piteous mediator between her two sovereigns. Tet, Mr. Stewart had not swerved for a moment from his purpose, and never supposed that Sandy had com mitted any grave offence to forfeit what was in a sort his inheritance. Mr. Stewart knew full well that many a distinguished divine and good man had begun Use by sow ing a crop of wild oats. Could the minister have been aware of it, his heart might have been comforted by the seeming coincidence that grey old St. Regulus was ringing at that moment with the characteristic exploits of \" Mad Tarn Chaumers,\" as Scotland was yet to ring with the virtues and renown of her great orator and philanthropist. And the minister would spare his bread as well as his cheese ; he would take off his coat, and break stones by a dyke side for day's wages, if the laws of the kirk and his parishioners would suffer it, sooner than Sandy should miss his natural call to do his family, his parish, it might be his country and the world, credit. It was Jess who came to a different conclusion. It was Jess who declared plainly in her secret chamber, \"I don't believe our Sandy will ever be a minister. Better he"], [20, "8 A SPRIG OF HEATHER. should not, if he do not put more heart into his work, or he will cover himself and us with disgrace, and bring down his father's and mother's grey hairs with sorrow to the grave. It is not so long since Mr. Home was put out of the kirk for writing a play ; and Sandy has songs, though he has not sermons, flying loose about his room when I go in to make up his bed ; it is well it is not one of the lasses who sees them. He brags of going every night to the theatre when Mrs. Siddons is in Embro' (I wonder where the price of his tickets comes from) ; and I am sure, if the Assembly put out one man for writing a play, they could not in honesty keep in another whose pencil is never out of his hand. I catched him drawing the bethel and Miss Mysie Wedderburn below the book-board at the very sum ming up of the ' heads ' last Sabbath, and his excuse was, he must have their heads out of his head to be at peace to listen. He cares a deal more for the glint of a sunny shower, or the gloom of a thunder-storm, or the crook of a scrug of a tree, or the red of a gipsy's torn cloak, than ever I could see he cared for the bearing of a doctrine. What about the minister of Duddingstone ? I would like anybody to tell me whether he was not licensed, presented, called, and placed, before he was known, to gentle and simple, as a drawing-master ? If Sandy would but mind his own business. I have no faith in a man, however quick, who does not mind his own business. There is Birkholm, as good a judge of a straight rig, or a round stack, or a head of nowt, as ever a farmer in the country ; yet he kept his terms at an English university, and he is a member of the Hunt, and well his red coat sets him ! \" It was Jess who grew to grudge, almost fiercely, every shilling spent on Sandy. Yet deal gently with Jess's memory, for she was no miser, and she was the chief suf ferer. She had her father's sense of justice outraged without any of the blindness which accompanies a beset ting desire ; and Jess was sensible that Sandy's idleness and extravagance were fatally depressing the balance in which hung the fortunes of her life. Adam Spottiswoode of Birkholm liked Jess, and there was no constraint on his will beyond the influence of his three sisters, whom he could shake off or bring round to"], [21, "9 WHAT SANDY WAS TO BE. submission at his pleasure. Jess Stewart would be a poor but not an unsuitable mate for the Laird of Birkholm ; and far beyond the consideration of the white house at Birkholm's being a grand down-setting for a portionless bride, Jess liked the comely, courteous, frank young laird \u2014 not half so clever as Jess herself, or Sandy, but attrac tive by the goodly glamour of his superior birth and breeding, with the manly, honourable character corre sponding to it. Adam Sp'ottiswoode and Jess Stewart had a kindness for each other ; but so long as it was no more than a kindness, or tender fancy, it was no stigma on their liking to say that if the couple had no opportunity of meeting, it would die the death of starvation \u2014 gradually on the woman's part, more rapidly on the man's. There should be a middle ground for the liking to wax into love. There was no middle ground left to the couple ; for the kirk, where Birkholm took his seat in the Birkholm loft, fronting the minister's bucht, where he and Jess were not always so engrossed with the sermon (in spite of Jess's despotism to other people with regard to their treatment of the \" heads \" ) as they should have been, was scarcely a middle ground. Poor Jess had no longer gloves, shoes, sashes, to go to the subscription balls in Woodend and the parties in the country houses : and when the manse family had to dismiss one of the servants, and Jess's hands got red and her face blowsy with continued house-work and garden work, she felt more and more that, without the commonest finishes to her toilette, she was no longer fit to appear in refined society and be Birkholm's chosen partner. Birkholm attempted one great advance. Spas were then the height of fashion \u2014 not foreign spas, but native \u2014 and not so much as fountains of health but as favourite resorts, where men and women saw the world, met every morning in the pump-room, drove together every afternoon, two by two, in high-pitched gigs, to all the show-houses and breezy views in the neighbourhood, and danced together a couple of long country dances without sitting down, under the countenance of a master of the ceremonies in pumps, and with the powder in his hair not blown away by the tempest of the French Revolution. Birkholm bribed an accommodating married cousin and one of his sisters, by"], [22, "10 A SPRIG OF HEATHER. their share of the gaiety, to invite Jess Stewart to accom pany them for a fortnight to one of the Wells. The excursion would have been hke an admission to the Elysian fields, with the temple of Hymen at the end of the principal vista, to Jess. It would have been the gala of the girl's life, and she would assuredly have come home from it engaged to Birkholm, and counting herself, with reason, the happiest woman in the world. But noblesse oblige prevails in all noble ranks. The project had become simply out of the question. Mr. and Mrs. Stewart, and Jess herself, would not submit to Birk holm's paying Jess's share of the travelling expenses, which, in the days of travelling post, were a serious cal culation to families with moderate incomes. But the Stewarts could and would have made a push to afford the necessary sum had not Sandy's delay at college and want of success rendered it impossible. And Mr. and Mrs. Stewart were deficient in their duty to their daughter, and made no account of Birkholm's attentions to her, because they had forgotten similar passages in their youth in the trouble of their middle age. Jess said to herself she did not want anybody's regrets, and told the world she did not care for jaunting \u2014 she found too much to do among the spring calves and chickens at the manse \u2014 and carried her high head as high, and looked as strong, stately, and blooming as ever. And the worst of it was, Birkholm believed her, and was as much piqued as the slightness of the relation between them permitted. The prosperous young laird could not altogether comprehend the straitness of the manse finances, and draw his inferences from them. He went off in a huff to enjoy himself at the Wells without the hard-hearted mistress for whose sake he had planned the holiday \u2014 not so much to enjoy himself either, as to prove to Jess that he could be foolish to the top of his bent without her. So Jess was cut to the heart by hearing rumours pre sently, now that Birkholm was on the eve of his marriage with a beauty and fortune he had been introduced to at the Wells ; now that he and other young men had indulged in frolics for which the licence of the time offered some apology, but which were far more culpable than any follies of Sandy's, and, to put the matter on the lowest footing,"], [23, "11 WHAT SANDY WAS. were far from becoming in the young man who aspired to the honour of being the minister's son-in-law. And if Birkholm were utterly lost to Jess, or if he should turn out wild and come to grief, would not Jess lay that to Sandy's charge as the heaviest portion of the debt he owed her ? CHAPTER II. WHAT SANDY WAS \" To desert his post and renounce the highest commis sion a man can bear \u2014 to starve or feed off the great as a painter of false faces, an idolater of stocks and stones \u2014 give me patience.\" The minister had need of patience when he received the letter with the tidings that Sandy, after passing through four of his years at college, with what effort the family knew, had abandoned the ministry, and adopted the pro fession of a painter. Mrs. Stewart and Jess were amazed and appalled beyond presuming to say a word. It is difficult to measure at present the headlong down fall of Sandy in those good people's estimation. Though they were familiar with his passion from his earliest years, they had not once contemplated the probability of his taking to painting as a calling. It was not that Mr. Stewart had any puritanical scruples as to the lawfulness of art. But Mr. Stewart had no scruple as to the lawfulness of dancing, and that would not have reconciled him greatly to Sandy's becoming a dancing-master. Yet actually, old M. Le Roy, the dancing master, had a far more accredited and dignified position, both socially and morally, at Woodend, than any of the poor portrait-painters who had found their way there. And it was not the poverty of the trade that was its crowning drawback. The minister, like all wise, honest men \u2014 Scotchmen particularly \u2014 had a due respect for wealth and its power ; but the ministers of the Kirk of Scotland had also need to be disinterested, and their hardy habits of mind and body were not much affected by the"], [24, "12 A SPRIG OF HEATHER. prospect of poverty. But while the minister had httle doubt that Sandy would starve, or lead a life of miserable dependence, perhaps vicious compromise, it would not have made a material difference in this case had he even been acquainted with the changes in the world which put a moderate competence within Sandy's reach, and caused the step he had taken to be within the bounds of right reason. Sandy was right that, in the Edinburgh of the day, not only was there a wonderful and glorious maiden literature, among \"the writer lads,\" whom the minister classed together rather contemptuously, but painting, as an art, for the first time coyly blushed and smiled as a true sister of the belles lettres, which Mr. Stewart's cloth did not alto gether despise when Robertson wrote history and Blair rhetoric. Runciman's painting of the Clerks of Penicuik's house seemed to promise a new era never attained, such as prevailed in Venice when Tintorretto and Paul Veronese painted marble palaces both within and without. Better still, a national academy was ready to confer status and impart instruction where youthful genius was concerned. But what was the struggling infancy of art to the minister, who indulged in the pictorial faculty in his own, and that quite another way, by drawing Sandy, as he had fondly hoped, standing up severe in youthful beauty, not unlike one of Milton's archangels, swaying by the breath of his mouth for their salvation multitudes in simple country kirks, or in what the Reformation had spared of rich abbeys and cathedrals in towns and cities; and, again, Sandy, haggard, sordid, and soiled, haggling with Jewish dealers, whom Mr. Stewart confounded with pawn brokers ; or journeying wearily from town to town, taking in scanty orders, and flattering obsequiously the owners of the puffed-up, vulgar, mean faces which he copied with secret disgust ? Mr. Stewart did not absolutely forbid Sandy his course, or threaten him with utter reprobation if he pursued it, because the minister's reasonable soul, in the middle of his wrath and mortification, revolted at violenee. He wrote to his son in stern reproach and rebuke. Sandy defended himself like a creature at bay, and refused to force himself into the priesthood, for which Providence could not"], [25, "WHAT SANDY WAS. 13 have designed him, since he had not the necessary qualifications. Mr. Stewart, beside himself, accused Sandy of going nigh to blaspheming \u2014 of proposing to take Providence into his own hands. Afterwards, Sandy came home for a few days ; a wretched visit, when his father never ad dressed him directly beyond helping him at table, and his mother \"lookit in his face\" as if her gaze would melt stone. Sandy was now as stone to his father ; for the sweet temper of the lad had been goaded and driven to the point when sweet tempers steel themselves to doggedness, less hopeful and tractable in its despair than any amount of original arrogance and perversity. Sandy saw that he had broken the family circle and rendered himself an alien from it. He said to his mother and Jess that he had better go away and fight his battle for himself ; and it would be best that they should not hear the accounts, because these would only cause fresh strife and condemnation. Some day they might see he had not been so far wrong. Sandy watched his opportunity ; and one fine harvest day, when the minister, the servants, and Andro Cornfoot, who had borne \" the young minister \" on his back many a sunny morning lang-syne, were all abroad engaged in the ingathering of the glebe corn, he kissed his mother and shook hands with Jess, and departed without other leave taking or blessing out into the world (which is generally cold enough for a penniless painter), taking no more with him than the stick and the wallet of one of the wandering apprentices of the kindly land of Wilhelm Meister. When the minister returned and found his son's place vacant, he must have guessed that Sandy was gone ; but he made no sign. Wandering apprentices are generally good pedestrians, and wonderfully endowed with friends ; but when the first touch of frost nipped Mrs. Stewart's gillyflowers that night, Sandy's mother dreamt of him as lying down like Jacob, with a stone for a pillow ; but, unlike Jacob, the heir of the promises, under the serene sky of Palestine \u2014 rather hke an Esau, getting his death of cold, shivering under the grey clouds and the bleak wind, by the bare Scottish roadside."], [26, "14 A SPRIG OF HEATHER. The door of the manse was thenceforth shut against Sandy; his name became a forbidden sound, not only as that of \"a stickit minister \"\u2014and the Scotch, with grim humour, deride a failure in proportion as they applaud an achievement in a favourite line \u2014 but as an ill-doer. Neigh bours carefully avoided mentioning Sandy to his family, while they talked loudly among themselves, and pitied the poor Stewarts for the sore hearts they had got by the pro digality and ingratitude of their only son. The minister strove manfully not to visit his pain on the blameless women-folk. He was so far left to himself as to call Andro \"a pompous idiot,\" and the herd \"an impudent blackguard ; \" but they were of the same sex as the delin quent, and in that light fair game. He refrained from ebullitions of temper to his wife and daughter, and was considerate, forbearing, almost caressing, to poor Mrs. Stewart. She, in her coming and going about her house, was for ever coming in contact with the empty kist which had passed to and fro for many happy years, as they looked now, stored with her choicest provisions for Sandy, and bringing back Sandy's clothes to his mother's care ; while in her drawer upstairs lay the pair of silk stockings which in the pride of her heart she had made Sandy sport when he was the escort of his sister and the darling of the young people at the Woodend parties \u2014 far before Birkholm in his mother's estimation. To Jess the minister turned with open arms, saying nothing to admit that he had overlooked and injured her, but with something almost pathetic in his dumb determi nation to make up by every species of indulgence for the irrevocable past. But with all this courage and kindness, the minister's disappointment sat stiffly on him. To escape from its in fluence he busied himself in his studies, and became more polemical and dogmatic. He shrank from meeting his brethren of the Presbytery, over whom he had reigned supreme, and to some of whom, with sons of their own, he had allowed himself, in the fullness of his heart, to boast of the career he had carved for his son, and before whom Sandy had humbled him in the dust \u2014 for none of their sons had turned fiddlers, the only vocation to which Mr. Stewart could compare that of a painter. He shrank from"], [27, "WHAT SANDY WAS. 15 his very parishioners unless in the way of duty as a clergy man, discontinuing largely his share of the old pleasant neighbourly visiting. Peace was restored to Clovenford, but the heartache there was acute and incessant. Almost the only event \u2014 and it was never spoken of \u2014 was the arrival of one or two foreign newspapers, with foreign postmarks, addressed to Mrs. Stewart in Sandy's handwriting, which proved that Sandy had managed to go abroad to follow his studies, possibly as a travelling tutor ; but his family knew nothing about him. Mr. Stewart could not have interdicted the newspapers, and he did not throw them into the fire ; but he never looked at them, though he alone could have read any part of their contents. To Mrs. Stewart and Jess the newspapers were a dead letter ; but the moment the minister had gone to his books Mrs. Stewart unfolded them, spread them out on her knee, regarded them wistfully, as if their hieroglyphics could tell her something of Sandy ; and had they only anticipated modern improvements, and conveyed to her woodcuts, they might have spoken to her in appropriate language of her boy. At last she folded them up and deposited them care fully where they were all found one day, in the drawer with her best gown and the silk stockings, as if she waited for the arrival of a scholar at Clovenford who would bring the key and unlock the mystery occasioned by the confu sion of tongues. Sandy went away in the harvest ; and towards the close of the next spring, Birkholm, who had been in Edinburgh all the winter with his sisters, came back to his own house, and called afterwards at the manse to announce the mar riage of his eldest sister to a gallant naval captain, who had been fortunate in obtaining prize money, was on shore only for a couple of months, and as he was already posted to another ship, with no time to lose, had so expedited matters that he wanted Mr. Stewart to tie the knot at once at Birkholm. It is said that one marriage lightly turns a roving fancy to the thought of another ; and with more of shyness to cover his anxiety, the young laird alluded to his sister's expectation that Miss Stewart would pay her the compli-"], [28, "16 A SPRIG OF HEATHER. ment of being present at the ceremony, and would remain a few days at Birkholm as company for his youngest sister Nancy, because Effie was to accompany Chirsty, the bride, in the capacity of bridesmaid. Mr. and Mrs. Stewart were altogether propitious, and very glad that Jess, who .had lived a dull life for a long time, should have the grand entertainment. To their astonishment Jess declined the invitation for herself with the greatest promptness and decision, wished Miss Spottis woode every happiness, hoped to see her before she left the country, but regretted that she had engagements at home which would prevent her having the honour and pleasure of being one of the company at the wedding, and staying behind the other guests to console Miss Nancy \u2014 thus sending off the laird with another flea in his ear, and vowing vehemently to have nothing more to say to \" a haughty hizzie,\" though she was his early flame, Jess Stewart, ten times over. \" Jess, my woman, why did you give Birkholm the cold shoulder when he came on so kind an errand ? If it is for the purpose of making yourself of consequence, and if the lad be of my mind, he will not put himself in your power again, madam,\" observed the minister with affected light ness. \" He need not try it,\" answered Jess, shortly. \" And you are not like your mother,\" persisted the minister, changing his cue ; \" for if I know her, she would be wild to this day to dance at a wedding, and have the chance of walking every day in Birkholm Den, when the birks are shaking out their buds and smelling like balm, and there are more primroses on a single bank than in the whole of her garden beds.\" \" My dancing days are over, minister,\" Mrs. Stewart told him, with a shake of the head, but a smile ; \" still a wedding is a bonnie sight, and I should like very well to walk down the Den again and fill my lap full of primroses, and sit and rest, and get a drink, and gather the hyacinths round the Lady Well, and listen to the throstle in the thorn, if I were as good a walker as I have been. I cannot think what has come over our Jess.\" Jess made no reply till the minister was gone, and her mother began to press her gently for an explanation of her"], [29, "17 WHAT SANDY WAS. conduct. Then she raised a pair of bent black brows, and opened her lips. \"Mother, do you think I have no feeling? Do you think, because I first stood up against Sandy, that I have no regard for my own brother ? Would I go and enjoy myself, and not know what has become of our Sandy, or what he may have to bear ? Adam Spottiswoode used to be Sandy's friend : he might have more sense than ask me such a gate.\" Mrs. Stewart said not another word. But the minister was troubled at Jess's reticence, cast about in his mind for a cause or a cure, and stumbled on one of his old acts of lavish generosity, and extraordinary misconception of his daughter's taste and of the laws of harmony. He surprised her by the arrival from her mother's merchant's shop in Woodend of a gown of yellow crape, with a pink silk scarf to match. After Jess had overcome the shock at the sight of the articles, and her resolution to find that they were not for her, she took them up in her arms and went straight with them into the minister's study. \" Well, Jess, what is in the wind now ? Have you changed your mind about going to the marriage at Birk holm ? \" he demanded, looking up from \" Campbell on Miracles,\" and pretending ignorance and innocence. To the minister's consternation, Jess's tears, kept for special occasions, began suddenly to fall hke rain. \"Father, do not think that I do not value your presents. I shall wear the one or the other at the kirk whenever the weather will permit, and as long as two threads hang together. But I cannot go to Birkholm : it is not fit that I should go and show off among the fine folk there, when somebody who has as good a right to your favour as I have, and wants it far more, has to hve without it.\" \" Jess, is it a fit return for my kindness that you should be so bold as to question my judgment ? I forbid you to speak another word to me on the subject of your brother.\" The minister dared her with flashing eyes, and conquered her so far as to drive her from his presence to burst out to her mother \u2014 \" Mother, my father is cruel to Sandy ; we have all been cruel to him. And what has he done to lose a son's place ? It is we who have brought reproach upon him. Where is c"], [30, "18 A SPRIG OF HEATHER. the righteousness and the mercy of laying burdens on other men's backs ? I do not care whether he ever be a fine painter ; I am not sure that I have seen a fine painting in my life ; but he was free to be a painter if he liked. I never thought more of Sandy than when he walked out at the gate, with his stick in his hand, last harvest ; he was a petted lad before, but he was a proud man then. If I catch any mortal man, save my father, looking down on Sandy, I will never speak to him again. And for my father, I say he is hard on Sandy. He need not think that I will take my pleasure, and Sandy cast off for a lad's madness (I wonder why they profess that ' to the pure all things are pure,' if Sandy was not as innocent as a bairn) \u2014 or that I will flaunt like a butterfly, when, for aught I can tell, my brother Sandy, who was a hundred times more dutiful and pleasant than I have ever been, may be pining in a garret or perishing in the streets.\" \" Oh ! whist, Jess, whist,\" implored Mrs. Stewart. \"Why do you bid me 'whist,' mother ; why do you not interfere ? \" cried Jess, worked into a noble passion, sweep ing backwards and forwards through the confined space of the manse parlour, herself hke a mother robbed of her young. \"Why do you not stand up for Sandy? He is your son, and you loved him, and with reason, twice as well as your daughter. I would not suffer my father's tyranny.\" \" Jess, Jess, you do not know what you are saying. I could not rebel against the minister. And do not you mis judge your father : he groans in his sleep : and think how good a man he is. And oh, Jess ! you cannot mind, but I can, how he took the candle and held it over Sandy in the cradle. And when your little sister died, and your father was at the Glenork preachings, and I sent the nearest elder to meet him to break to him the distress at home, he guessed it before Mr. Allan could get out the words. He was always a sharp man, your father, and he just put up his hand and pled with the messenger, ' Not Sandy ; tell me it is not Sandy.' It was not that he was not fond of his lasses, Jess, you know ; but they could not bear his name and uphold his Master's credit as his lad would do.\" Though Mrs. Stewart did nothing \u2014 could do nothing, when Jess came to think of it, sobbing in her own room in"], [31, "WHAT SANDY WAS. 19 the reaction after her recantation, both for Sandy and for Birkholm, from that day's confidence mother and daughter were knit together as they had not been before. In the beginning Jess had been a little too vigorous and energetic for her mild, tender mother ; but Mrs. Stewart clung to Jess in the end with mingled fond respect, deep gratitude, and yearning affection. On Sabbath days, when the minister left his wife in the kirk porch to go into the session-room, it was on Jess's arm that Mrs. Stewart now leant for the short distance up the aisle to the minister's bucht, on the right hand of the pulpit. On the few other occasions when she crossed her threshold, while she was able to move about among her flowers, or stroll to the Kames for the spectacle of the setting of the sun, which shone on other lands besides Scotland, she sought to have Jess on the one side of her and the minister on the other. Another peculiarity of Mrs. Stewart's this summer was her struggle against her feebleness, her efforts to convince herself and others that she was gaining strength, the eager ness with which she applied every means for the resto ration of her health \u2014 new milk, port wine, even to the homely, uncouth superstitions of a stocking from the minister's foot wrapped round her throat at night, and the breath of the cows in the cow-house the first thing of a morning. It was as if something had happened which would not let her die when her time came. It was well for Jess that she was much with her mother during the summer, and that their communion was that of perfect love ; for before the season was ended Mrs. Stew art was attacked by a sudden increase of illness, and after a week's suffering was gone where she might have clear intelligence of Sandy, to which all the knowledge of this world would have been no more than the discordant words of an unknown tongue. There could have been no time to write for Sandy, even had the minister and Jess known where he was to be found ; and Mrs. Stewart had not asked for her son. No immediate danger had been anticipated by the doctor, or apprehended by the patient and her relations, until within a few hours of her death, and then speech and in part con sciousness had failed her. Unless the look of the eyes,"], [32, "20 A SPRIG OF HEATHER. which, heavy with their last long slumber, roused them selves to search round the room, once and again, referred to the absence of Sandy, Mrs. Stewart passed away with her love, perhaps like most great love, silent. But when all was over, Jess thought with a breaking heart of the ignorance of him who had most cause to mourn, and of his place filled by others less entitled to be there on the day when the wife and mother was borne to her grave. She was laid beside her baby who had passed from its mother's bosom to the bosom of the second mother of us all, the earth, and who, if it had lived, would have been an older woman than Jess ; and beside the old divines who had filled the minister's pulpit, and their faithful wives, of centuries back, in the grassy kirkyard within sight of the windows of Mrs. Stewart's old home, where a stormy wind might carry the leaves from her garden and scatter them on the mound. That mound, whether white with May gowans or December snows, would never be out of the minister's and Jess's minds, and near it distance-divided families and former neighbours would still meet and \" be glad to have their crack in the kirkyard,\" and not forget to say softly in her praise what a fine gentlewoman the minister's wife had been, and how the minister, poor man, missed her. If Adam Spottiswoode had been at Birkholm, Jess might have applied to him in her desperation to learn if he had heard anything of Sandy, and to beg of him to intercede with her father for his son. But Birkholm was absent at the moors, and Jess had respect for her father's affliction, and would not torture him to no end. Therefore Mr. Stew art and Jess bore the brunt of that dark day \u2014 the darker that it was in the height of summer, the prime and pride of the year \u2014 alone, but for sorrowing neighbours and dependants. When Mr. Stewart returned to the manse after the funeral party was dispersed, and retired to his room, Jess could not intrude on him. It was the room to which he had brought her a bride, and she had died in it. It was her room now while his time of the manse lasted, though she had vacated it humbly during her hfe. Jess had too much fellow-feeling with her father not to divine that no hand but his own would be suffered to dispose of its mis-"], [33, "21 WHAT SANDY WAS. tress's little shawl and cap, which in the hnrry of her last illness had been put on the side-table among his books. He would see them there, sitting in the gloaming at his meditations, and half believe that her light foot \u2014 at her feeblest it was a light one \u2014 would be heard again on the threshold, and her fair faded face, which had been to him as none other but Sandy's, would look in upon him, smiling, while she asked some simple kindly question \u2014 Why was he sitting without a light ? Was he sure he had shifted his feet on coming in from christening the bairn at the Cotton Bog ? Was he ready to ask a blessing on the sowens for supper ? Jess had her own sorrows, but they were a little lightened when, the long afternoon over, her father re-entered, the sleeves of his coat looking conspicu ous with their white cuffs, with which she would grow so familiar that they would seem more than any other details of his dress \u2014 white neckcloth and black vest \u2014 a part of the man, as he would come to her every second day and stand patiently while she removed and replaced them for him. The minister wanted his tea, and tried to speak on indif ferent subjects \u2014 on the long drought and the burned-up pasture \u2014 but stopped abruptly because he could not put back the thought, and he knew that Jess shared it, that Mrs. Stewart not ten days ago had been lamenting the drought in that room, and had been making her arrange ments to send out the servants every evening with their hooks to cut grass at the ditch-sides, and bring back their aprons full of a fresh green supper for her beasts. He walked to the window and looked out beyond the flowery garden to where the evening wind soughed sadly in the grass of the kirkyard. Then he turned and said emphatically, \" Our wound is deep, though we need not let it be seen. But, Jess, it is not by a gloomy token hke yon that she would hke us to mind her ; not that it is not good in its way \u2014 everything is good or changed to good, even parting and death, when they are but a stage to meeting and everlasting life. But, Jess, we must take care of her beasts and birds and flowers, that they may never miss her as we shall do, always \u2014 though we troubled the last of her days with our discord. We must keep up her habits, that every day may have its trace of her.\" He went on speaking with unusual openness for a strong,"], [34, "22 A SPRIG OF HEATHER. reserved man, on the sweet and winning morning light which had lingered with his wife and Jess's mother amidst the dust and clouds of the heat of the day ; on her love of animals and plants, quaint books, plaintive old songs, primitive sayings ; her walks to the Kames to see the sun set; her reveries looking into the blazing coals on the winter hearth. And Jess knew she was her father's trusted friend, and that he saw in her one who compre hended and shared his life-long loss and sorrow. CHAPTER III. THE PICTURE. For some time after her mother's death, Jess was thrilled with a nervous expectation that Sandy would \" cast up,\" as she expressed it, in the gloaming or the dawning, any day, to take his part in their mourning. The .news of his mother's death would reach him through friends or the announcement in the newspapers. But as months passed, Jess was forced to renounce the expectation, and submit to the obscurity which hung over Sandy's fate. The minister and Jess hved together in strict seclusion, until the sharp edge was worn off their sorrow ; and then the minister had grown a quiet, absorbed, grey student, whom Jess could only wile from his household gods \u2014 the books \u2014 for the benefit of his health, by ingenious strata gems and unremitting pains. And Jess was a fine-looking, composed woman, with the eye and the hand of a mother, and the carriage of a duchess. It was summer again at Clovenford, and the whole place and people were pervaded with a grave, shaded, softened brightness, not wanting in flashes of mirth, relieving what was pensive in domestic life \u2014 for both Jess and the minis ter possessed the composite quality of humour, and not only raised the laugh in others, but were subject them selves to sudden ringing peals of laughter ; the wisdom of the mirth being as old and common as sin and misery, and which the wit of Grizel Baillie set in one memorable line \" Werena my heart licht I would dee.\""], [35, "THE PICTURE. 23 The month of May, with its lilac \u2014 lily-oak they called it at Clovenford \u2014 and hawthorn, was about its close, and the General Assembly of the Kirk of Scotland was about to conclude for the season its time-honoured, pious, bene volent, virulent squabbles. The minister of Clovenford was not a member this year, but he took it into his head late one evening that he would like to be present at a certain debate next night, and, with constitutional rapidity, fixed that he would go to Edin burgh next morning by the early coach which passed through Woodend, take Jess with him for a treat, be pre sent in the gallery of the Assembly, spend what was left of the night at Jess's Auntie Peggy's, and return by the late coach the next night to Clovenford. \" For there will be nobody sitting up for us at home,\" he put in, with an involuntary touch of pathos, when he found how easy the scheme was. But the minister had not been in such good spirits for a long time, and it was with something of his old animation that he entered into details, congratulated Jess that she would have an opportunity of seeing the Lord High Commissioner, and graphically detailed the marks by which she might distinguish the leaders of the kirk. Jess was glad that her father should feel able for the excursion, and soberly pleased with it on her own account. She had been in Edinburgh just once before, and had seen the Castle, Holyrood, Princes Street, George Street, and St. Andrew's Square already. Days in Edinburgh were of such rarity and importance that few country-women of her circle, after finishing their education, attained them more than once in their lives, and then it was on such momentous occasions as the celebration of their marriages in the capital, or the scarcely less serious step of going with bridegrooms, mothers, and matronly friends, to buy their \" marriage things \" out of metropolitan shops, thus gloriously com bining love and adventure, pleasure and profit. Jess, though far behind in other respects, felt a little elated at the double feat. The minister and Jess were on foot by five o'clock next morning, and found even the end of May rather raw on the top of a coach at that early hour ; they spent the greater part of the day on the road, indefatigably enjoying the"], [36, "24 A SPRIG OF HEATHER. scenery, and sheltering themselves under cloak and mantle from pelting showers. They alighted, and swallowed slices of salt beef from perennial rounds, and glasses of sherry and tumblers of porter, leisurely, while the coach was changing horses in the inn yards of country towns ; and, after in quisitively scrutinising and formally addressing fellow travellers, ended by establishing fast friendships with them before the coach a'nd its burden rolled up the High Street of that Auld Reekie which, whether in ancient or modem guise, is one of the most picturesque of cities. The journey, which occupies so large an amount of old travellers' tales, safely and creditably performed, the rest of the play remains to be played out. Auntie Peggy received her unexpected visitors with a cordial recollection of summer weeks spent by her and her old maiden servant in country quarters at Clovenford, and attended them to the Assembly, where the minister pro cured the party's admission. And Jess saw his Grace the Commissioner ; was duly impressed by his throne ; heard, with all the interest a minister's daughter ought to feel, the question of \" teinds \" amply discussed ; and just as her high head, with its gipsy bonnet, was beginning to nod in a manner the most undignified and unlike Jess, and when she was thinking she could not keep her eyes open a moment longer, though the Commissioner asked it of her as a personal favour, or threatened to turn her out by his usher if he caught her napping, the vote was taken, and Jess was released, to repair to Auntie Peggy's and her bed. The next morning the minister and Jess' were abroad betimes, while Auntie Peggy gave herself wholly to solemn preparations for the mid-day dinner. The walk was for Jess's pleasure, that she might see again the more remote rugged lion couchant, Arthur's Seat, and the nearer, smooth, polished lions, the shops and the passengers. Among the fellow-passengers of Jess and the minister, while there were some women who ridiculed the country cut of Jess's black silk pelisse, there was more than one man who turned to look after the pair, and remark what a noble-looking lass that was with the grey, stout, old black-coat. The minister had fully discharged his obligations as a cicerone. He had pointed out the \" White Hart,\" at which Dr. Johnson alighted on his way to his tour in the He-"], [37, "THE PICTURE. 25 brides ; the bookseller's shop where Robbie Barns, in boots and tops, with a riding-whip dangling over his arm, once corrected the proof-sheets of his songs ; Richardson's, frequented by young Mr. Scott, the author of the poem of \" Marmion ; \" the houses of Professors Dugald Stewart and Sir John Hall \u2014 Captain Basil, the great traveller's father ; and the Flesh Market Close, where the best beefsteaks in the kingdom were to be eaten. And Jess had wondered, but found it impossible to ask, whether they were near the street where she remembered Sandy's lodgings had been, and where it was just within nature he might be. \" Father,\" said Jess suddenly, with a rush of colour into her face,\" I would like to go in here.\" Mr. Stewart and Jess had been proceeding on the plan of a fair division of labour and recreation. The minister's part performed, he had been walking along abstractedly, only waking up occasionally at the distant glimpse of a book-stall, where Jess stood quietly beside him, as he stood quietly beside Jess when the attraction was a linendraper's or a jeweller's window. The minister had inquired of Jess whether she wanted anything, and Jess, after a few modest purchases, had answered in the negative ; but he supposed that now she had met with an irresistible temptation, or recalled a for gotten commission. He followed her into the entrance of what looked more hke a museum than a shop, and yielding up his stick, not without an inclination to resist the demand, to the porter, while Jess was hurriedly getting two tickets. The minister stopped short in the doorway of another room, aggrieved and ireful ; but he had never turneS back in his life \u2014 never refused to face an annoyance or a dif ficulty \u2014 and his hesitation terminated in his marching sulkily at the heels of Jess into one of the Royal Society's earliest exhibitions. The minister and Jess entered into no explanation and offered no comment as they walked slowly up the room, literally dazzled by the display on the walls. However connoisseurs might have disdained the crude attempts of Wilkie, Allan, and Thomson, these were marvels to the country-folk, who were only acquainted with the simpering or scowling representations of ladies, like full-blown roses"], [38, "26 A SPRIG OF HEATHER. in their own persons, clasping rose-buds between their fingers and thumbs, and gentlemen with fierce tops of hair breaking the seals of letters with as much cruel satis faction as if they had been crushing beetles. But all at once both Jess's and the minister's eyes were fixed, while their feet were drawn to a picture some yards in advance of them, which they could distinguish through the scanty sprinkling of visitors at that hour in the room. It was not one of the classic pieces, which were the stock-pieces then, nor of the battle-fields, nor of the land scapes, but a little family group which was strangely well known to them. They had seen the round table, the straight-backed chairs, the very ivory netting-box, many a time before ; and even these dumb pieces of furniture, so far from home, awoke a thousand associations. Then what of the figures, with living eyes looking out at them ? The elderly man putting down his book to ponder its contents ; the young man with his face half hidden by his hands, as if weary or sad ; the girl entering the room on some household errand ; and she was there, sitting in the centre of them as she would sit no more, looking not as she had looked when she was passing away, not as Mr. Stewart with a backward bound of the memory had been given to see her lately, the innocent, ingenuous, lovely girl who had come to the manse of Clovenford, bringing with her sunshine, poetry, and the first tremulous dewy bloom of life, but Sandy and Jess's mother, whose presence \u2014 weak woman as she was \u2014 had been like a shelter and a stay, full of the security and serenity of experience, and the sweetness of household content. The drawing might be faulty, the colouring streaky, but there again was the family \u2014 those of them who were still going about the streets, and one who on this earth was not. It was a God-given faculty and a loving heart which had thus reproduced and preserved the past. The minister and Jess stood as if spell-bound among the unheeding spectators, and gazed at the image of what they had lost as if it were at that moment given back to them, with inexpressible longing ; when, at a start from Jess, the minister turned round and saw his wife's dead face in Sandy's living one, gazing at them in agitation as they were gazing at the picture. He was in mourning hke"], [39, "THE PICTURE. 27 themselves, but except that he looked older, his brown hair darker, and that his blue eyes were dimmed for the moment, he was not altered \u2014 had as much the air of a gentleman as ever, and had emerged from a knot of gentle men who were making the circuit of the room and an examination of the pictures with the ease and freemasonry of privileged, professional frequenters of the place. Jess scarcely noticed this at first. Her heart leaped to greet her brother, and at the same time she was terrified lest her father should think there had been an appoint ment, perhaps through Auntie Peggy, and that she had deliberately betrayed him into a meeting with his son. Jess had known nothing even of the picture, had been as much struck by the sight of it as the minister, and had only entered the exhibition on the impulse of the moment when she read its name, determined to pay that mark of respect to Sandy ; and with what lurking notion of establishing a communication or provoking an encounter between them she had not dared to tell herself. Jess was in dread of how the minister would behave to Sandy ; she might have known her father better, in his sound sense and old-fashioned code of politeness. \" How are you, Sandy ? \" the minister asked, holding out his hand to his son as if nothing had happened. Sandy was a great deal more put out as he took the offered hand and shook it, and said in a breath \u2014 \" I am glad to see you looking so well, father ; and Jess ; when did you come to town ? \" Mr. Stewart satisfied his son's curiosity with a word, and then it was in entire keeping with the man that his next words were in indignant reprobation : \" Sandy, how dared you make your family a gazing stock on the walls of a public exhibition, without even asking their leave ? \" \" I did not think you would dislike it so much, sir,\" stammered Sandy. \"There are many portraits here. I have not put the names, and I did not fancy that the originals would be generally recognized. The picture is sold to a friend.\" \" Sold ! \" exclaimed Mr. Stewart, with a great increase of anger and a quaver of consternation in his voice ; \" How could you do such a thing ? Who is the buyer ? \""], [40, "28 A SPRIG OF HEATHER. \" I meant to take a copy, as I could not afford to keep what I believe is the best thing I have done, though I have sold some other subjects readily enough since my return. I daresay I should have altered this had not the buyer been an old friend. He bought it at my own price the first morning he saw it,\" Sandy expatiated, with pardonable pride. \"He should be a judge of the like nesses, since he is one of your own parishioners. He was here to-day, and yonder he is finding you out \u2014 Birkholm.\" Misfortunes do not come alone, nor do old friends meet singly. Adam Spottiswoode was delighted to come in this manner upon the Stewarts and to share the pledge of reconciliation which the group implied \u2014 to take it boldly as an omen of other alliances. For Birkholm still hankered after Jess with an inextinguishable hankering, which was beginning to deepen into the glow of true love. In all his experience of life for the last year or two, he had seen nobody yet to come up to Jess Stewart. People from the same parish of Clovenford, the Stewarts and the laird, encountering each other in the wilderness of a city, were like one family already. The laird improved the occasion by attaching himself assiduously to the Stewarts, as he could not have had the confidence to do in the Den of Birkholm, acting on the principle that it would be disrespects ul to his minister not to join his ranks when he turned up in a public place among strangers ; and that in these circumstances he, Birkholm, had as good a right to investigate narrowly when the minister and Jess had come, where they were staying, and when they were going home, as if he were as minutely acquainted with the daily routine of their lives when he was at Birkholm and they at Clovenford. And without doubt Birkholm's comely, manly, gentleman-like presence was like a \"kind, kenned face \" to the minister and Jess in Edinburgh, how ever lightly they might regard it in their own parish. Jess opened her eyes a little at his attention, but she did not repulse him, and the minister only staggered him for a moment : \u2014 \" Birkholm, you'll give up that picture ; it is mine by a double right ? \" The next instant Birkholm was eagerly assuring the minister,\u2014\" It is yours, Mr. Stewart ; do not say another"], [41, "29 THE PICTURE. word about it,\" and accrediting with a throb of triumph that he had earned the minister's gratitude. The picture was not Mr. Stewart's, however, in the sense which Birkholm intended at first. The minister would pay him back every pound of his money for it, though it should stint his small purse ; and tho laird had the wit' to see, soon, that if he would stand well with the high-spirited old man, he must refrain from offering him a gift of his wife's and children's portraits (as for the minister's own, the minister might not have minded that). Until Birkholm had a title to be painted on the same canvas, he had better be modest in proposing to confer his favours. Mr. Stewart took another lingering look at the picture after it was his own, and examined Sandy strictly on its removal and packing, a httle nettled that it was at the service of the Academy for a week or two longer. After wards the minister made the rest of the round of the room on Sandy's arm, freely availing himself of his son's in formation, and making pertinent remarks, which were honourable to the shrewd criticism of an old prejudiced ignoramus. Before a picture of \" John Knox Preaching to the Regent,\" not without corresponding fire in the handling, Mr. Stewart stood still again, and commended it warmly. He finished it by a more personal admission, worthy of the minister, a half-smile playing over his powerful features : \" Sandy, your art is far below the cure of souls, yet I own there is something in it, after all. But it was your mother's face that beat me.\" Birkholm accompanied Jess, and saw no necessity for concealing from her what had been his intention regarding the picture ; and Jess was not offended, but thanked him softly even when he spoke of a copy, and of his project of hanging it opposite the pictures of his father and mother in the dining-room at Birkholm. And if that was not a broad hint, the laird did not know what was. Jess was so happy \u2014 and humble in her happiness \u2014 that she could not find it in her heart to contradict Birkholm ; and the young laird, not being at all used to his own way with Jess Stewart, and finding it intoxicating, went on at a fine pace. But first he had the grace to tell her how well"], [42, "30 A SPRIG OF HEATHER. Sandy was spoken of among artists, of what promise he was held, and to point out some of Sandy's friends who were not like the portrait painters Jess had seen at Wood- end. Finally the laird said that the picture of the family had excited a sensation, and that if Jess and the minister were doubly recognized as two of the originals, and as the sister and the father of the artist, they would have to bear some staring for Sandy's sake. Here Jess's credulity broke down. This statement was more than she could swallow, though she had been devouring the rest \u2014 the notion that though Sandy should be the greatest painter in the land, the minister would be pointed at as Sandy's father ! Next, Birkholm's tongue wagged wildly on his own affairs. There was word of his sister Effie's marriage \u2014 \u25a0 indeed, he might say, it was as good as settled \u2014 with one of the Edinburgh writers ; and Chirsty's captain was with his ship, and Chirsty, who was not sailing with him on his present station, was delicate, and wanted Nancy to keep her company in her lodgings at an English seaport, and he would be left all by himself at Birkholm. It seemed he thought no shame of appealing to the charity of a friend, and arrived speedily at direct insinuations that Jess might visit Edinburgh again with him and the minister in a month or two \u2014 after harvest and before the hunting season \u2014 or even might make the present visit serve two purposes, as, where people were of one mind, the sooner \" these things \" were done the better. Jess was forced to interpose and put a check on the honest, gallant laird, lest he should come to the point of affronting her by proposing plainly that her stay in town should extend over the Sabbath ; and then there would be time to send word to the session clerk and precentor of Clovenford to have their names cried in the kirk, while the minister might celebrate the ceremony on the Monday, without the trouble of wedding clothes or wedding guests, or \"riding the broose.\" \"These things,\" as the laird called them with agreeable, self-conscious vagueness, were thus performed frequently. The world had awakened to perceive a want of delicacy in the old ostentatious parade and riotous rejoicings at marriages, and had run into the opposite extreme by en couraging couples to steal off and be married in secret"], [43, "THE PICTURE. 31 fine ladies at Richmond, their maids at Chelsea. Half of Jess's acquaintances quitted their homes, not in the accom plishment of elopements, but with the full consent of friends and relatives, and posted in the all but universal white gowns and yellow buckskins, affording no other clue to their design, to Edinburgh or to some other large town, to be married in the privacy of a crowd. But Jess Stewart was not so minded. If Birkholm had penetrated her secret, she had arrived at her conclusion with the swiftness of lightning, while mechanically review ing the specimens of early Scotch art in the Exhibition. Women are seldom at fault when they stumble unawares on the leading transaction of their lives \u2014 they have re hearsed it too often in imagination \u2014 and women hke Jess Stewart, never. \" I may be back in Edinburgh in the spring,\" said Jess, composedly, glancing at her black silk pelisse; \" I think my Auntie Peggie wants me over at that time,\" she added, with the duplicity which even a woman like Jess could not resist being guilty of, in the strait. Had she been clear as crystal in this as in other matters, she would farther have comforted the laird ; \" and then, Birkholm, after I have accustomed my father to the thought of not seeing me every day in my mother's place, and have made every pro vision for his comfort, we will be wed \u2014 but I think it will be on a bonnie April afternoon, in the Clovenford dining room, where the sound of the healths and the cheering will reach to the kirkyard, as far as my mother's grave. You and me have spirit enough not to be feared at the ringing and firing; we would rather give the folk the ploy.\" As to Birkholm, he took the comfort for granted, and did not need it expressed in words. Birkholm dined with the family at Auntie Peggy's on the dainty early lamb and the mythically-sounding forced potatoes and strawberries \u2014 the stereotyped luxuries of the Assembly weeks in Edinburgh. Auntie Peggy, that estim able and convenient kinswoman, though she had never been in the same room with the laird and her niece before \u2014 her eyes probably opened by her hospitality and its good cheer, followed Jess when she retired to prepare for her homeward journey, and folded her in her arms as soon as they were in the best bedroom ; called her a fine lass, who"], [44, "32 A SPRIG OF HEATHER. had done her duty by father and mother and brother, and enthusiastically predicted her reward. For Auntie Peggy's part, she had always promised that she would give Jess her tea china, and she would take care that Jess had a set which would not disgrace the brass-mounted tea-table of old Lady Birkholm. She would not say but that, all things considered, Jess might count on her tea trays forbye. Jess and the minister hied home to Clovenford, well supported. They had the willing convoy of both the young men \u2014 Sandy to remain for a month's holiday. He was to inaugurate his picture, and to be a witness to all the parish coming to see and admire it, and to the minister never tiring of showing it off till he succeeded in discover ing subtle touches which the painter had never laid on. \" My hand is closed on my spectacles. Jess is bringing in the eggs. She is copying a leaf from her rose-tree in her work. She had the first China rose in Clovenford, and she was very ingenious. It is from his mother he takes his talent.\" But beforehand, when Mr. Stewart and the young people returned late in the summer night to Clovenford, and the latter delayed for a moment at the manse gate to take leave of Birkholm and to enter into an appointment with him for the next day, the minister walked up the garden path alone to the door. \"It is all dark,\" he thought, looking up in the purple gloom at the quiet little house and the neighbouring kirk and kirkyard, on which the morning would soon dawn in midsummer gladness, \"where her light should have shone, and she would have hked well to have seen the two lads and the lass come home, and to have got her picture by her son's hand, though she had behoved to admit for once that I had been in the wrong. But who says she's blind ? She has gone where faith is sight, and where they know the end from the beginning, and she has her share of the knowledge. I warrant she sees farther than any of us \u2014 to having us all round her again, and her, bonnie Jean Clephane, restored to immortal youth. I cannot rightly understand how the lass and the wife and mother can be one and the same ; but I am sure it shall be, and that will be perfection. And oh ! Jean, woman, when I've sorted and settled the bairns, and done something more for my Master, I will be blythe to go home to my old friend and my young wife.\""], [45, "A SCOTCH THISTLE. (ADAM AND MALLY.) CHAPTER I. TWO AGREE. Mally Gilhaize was a bride undergoing the ordeal of being cried (proclaimed) with her fellow-servant, Adam Urquhart, on three successive Sabbaths in their parish kirk. In the meantime, bride and bridegroom continued in their places at farm service on the same farm, and did their duty as custom and a sense of right enabled them, httle moved by the jeers and gibes of their fellow-servants. Mally Gilhaize's history will tell her character as it grew : one has only to describe her person as she hved and worked \u2014 for to Mally, in the noon of her hfe, to hve was to work \u2014 rest, save so much of it as was inevitable, was self indulgent, weak, unworthy. Mally would have \" thought shame \" to rest when she could work, unless on the Sab bath day, and then it was not so much rest as worship. Mally was a big woman, square for her height. Her fore head was low and not broad ; she was well, almost richly, coloured, dark-haired and dark-browed, with grey eyes fully opened, and looking you full in the face, but having a certain fixedness in their gaze. She had a firm mouth, showing, when she spoke, even, broad, white teeth. Her ordinary dress was scrupulously clean and whole, and scrupulously unbrightened by adornment. It consisted of D"], [46, "34 A SCOTCH THISTLE. a linen jacket, a dark petticoat, a coarse, wide apron, thrown on or off as was required or not. Her clean-made feet and ankles remained bare, save in winter, when they were invested in large and hideous hairy woollen stockings and clamping shoes. Her abundant hair was covered always with a close yet voluminous white cap. Her extraordinary dress was Quaker-like in severe simplicity ; a dark woollen or cahco gown with tight high body and tight sleeves to the wrist, a neckerchief to the chin, the same white cap \u2014 it might be of finer material \u2014 in the house and on every out-of-doors expedition, except to the kirk, when Mally wore a coarse straw bonnet with a deep-toned ribbon strap ping it down, which lasted for years. Mally's wardrobe, whether for summer or winter, admitted only of a single variation from this rule, and it was not made on the occasion of kirn, New-Year's feast, christening, wedding \u2014 no, not of her own. Mally would be wed, if she ever should be wed, in a pea-bloom or earth-brown woollen gown. But on the Sacrament Sabbaths, when she was \"going forward\" to the Lord's Table, Mally walked a vestal in white from head to foot. There was little grace or graciousness about Mally, she was too set and stiff for either, but she had an air of homely dignity and beneficence. She bore a distant resem blance to Goethe's Dorothea. In her early days, Mally was not a singular person of her age and class. She was a douce lass where others were glaikit (giddy), but there were many douce lasses to be seen then at kirk and market, as there were giants among the sons of men in the time of Anak. Adam Urquhart \u2014 Adam of the bothy \u2014 by whom Mally had been courted, and with whom she had gone so far as to be cried, was five years older than she, a man of thirty, rather advanced in years for a bachelor ploughman, but he had waited discreetly till he should attain the rank of fore man before he changed his estate. He was scarcely a comely man, unless to those who accept the outward ex pression of rough sincerity and vigour for comeliness. His fifteen years of holding a plough and driving a cart had bowed and rounded his back till his height was lost, and he looked short for a man beside Mally for a woman. He was swarthy in complexion, with great growing bristles"], [47, "TWO AGREE. 35 rendering coarse his cheeks and chin for six days out of seven, fiis jaw was too marked, his eyes were too sunken, yet the eyes were honest eyes when one could look into them, and could gleam with a man's repressed ardour ; and the mouth, while it was not a sensual mouth, could smile with a man's kindness. There was nothing treacherous, nothing essentially cruel in Adam's physiognomy. He was a sturdy fellow, and to be relied on, though he was difficult to deal with, and needed a light, firm hold on him ; not that he was vioious \u2014 looking at him in the light of a horse, but he was desperately opinionative, like most one sided, self-made beasts and men ; and without question, as stubborn as ten mules. His dress was the ordinary plough man's dress, on which the modern alterations are only in a few details. His corduroy breeches were knee-breeches, and were met by long \" rig-and-f ur \" (ridge and furrow) blue worsted stockings ; his bonnet was the original broad. blue bonnet, and he was addicted to enormous owerlays (cravats). How Adam and Mally, two mortals self-contained, self sufficing, stuck-up (allow them one grievous, perilous fail ing in common ; they had also in common many great virtues, as their master and mistress, neighbours and kin dred, could have testified), condescended to hanker after each other, to yield to each other's influence, to promise them selves to each other, is a mystery. There is no explanation of it save in that other mystery and mixture of law and frowardness \u2014 human nature. Possibly, even at the old farm of Hayston \u2014 an Arcadia of simplicity, frugality, and disciplined self-denial to a Lycurgus or a Johannes Cal vinus \u2014 there was something missing which awoke a yearning in these two hearts \u2014 quiet, calm, stout in their fervour \u2014 a fervour of faith and duty. There had been needs in which Mally, capable and contented as she was, could not do all for herself, and could not leave anything undone without a sigh and a sniff of dissatisfaction. There had been wants which Adam, Stoic as he was, and dex terous with the hardly acquired skill of a man driven to his own resources, could neither supply nor deny without a groan and a grunt of disgust. Mally must have milked wicked cows which would not be \" gentle to her,\" and which, in spite of her courage for"], [48, "36 A SCOTCH THISTLE. a woman, caused her woman's heart to quail when there was no all-powerful, undaunted \" man body \" to take up his station in the straw or the grass, and hold the head ever ready to butt and the hoof ever prone to fling. Mally must have gone morning and evening in summer to do her milking in the pasture fields, and when she carried home the \" race\" of brimming pails, though she used a gird or hoop and had muscular arms, still these arms must have ached again for a man's strength to help her on with her burden along the weary road of half a mile. Mally must have stripped the cherry tree and the pear tree in their seasons, must have climbed ladders and scrambled across open, half-rotten couples or joists, on to hay stacks, and into barns, after erratic hens' nests. Mally must have walked on errands to the next village past kirk and kirk yard on dark winter no less than gloaming summer nights, and Mally was as superstitious as she was godly. Mally must also have attended, if she would not get the cold shoulder for being unsocial, little festivities in her circle, and been pursued and persecuted as fair game by the hghter men and women whom her reserve and discretion rebuked, when she had not a formidable champion and protector \u2014 and Mally was intensely proud, though she hid the disposition jealously from herself and others, for it is not only a deadly sin in a Christian, but a tremendous blunder and crime in a peasant to peasants. As for Adam, he dropped the buttons off his sark and boggled horribly in sewing them on again. His stockings, which his mother knitted for him, became riddles in the intervals between the old and the new instalments. Darn his best, he darned such knots and lumps on the heels and toes, that the pilgrims with the unboiled peas in their shoes had an easy progress compared to Adam. Unluckily men could not go barefooted to the plough, as women \"linked \" about the kitchen, the poultry yard, the bleaching green, in their trifling avocations. Adam was as hardy and tough a fellow as any in the parish, but he was exposed in its full brunt to a calendar the changes of which are rung in the proverb : \" The first day it was wind and weet, The second day it was snaw and sleet, The third day it was sic a freeze It stack the birds' nebs to the trees.\""], [49, "TWO AGREE. 37 In addition, Adam was scorched by wli\u00bbt sun was going between whiles. He was nourished and housed like an ancient, with the constitution of a modern, Briton. One might defy a Hercules in the same circumstances not to have ailments now and again. Adam's head ached, and his mother was four parishes off from caring for and com- forting him. He had a feverish cold, and a rebellion against his coarse fare, and he had no man or woman either to mind his shivering or to boil, bake, brew, with fond anxiety to feed him with the food convenient for him, and for which his sorely-strained body was craving. There was a greater trial in store for Adam's philosophy. His pair of horses, his two familiar friends \u2014 not servants \u2014 the trust he had been proud to hold since he was a haflin (half boy, half man), the pride of his proud heart, very nearly what an Arab's horse is to a child of the desert, what a Red Indian's dog is to the wild hunter, Adam's horses \u2014 Diamond and Bab-at-the-Bowster \u2014 were liable to sickness, even as Adam was, lost their sleekness, hung their heads, pawed and stamped with unrest, shook, and went from their oats in turn. Adam was reduced to distress verging on despair. In such an extremity woman was revenged; for Adam, with all his will and all the skill of a fair amount of practice, could not concoct drinks and mashes for his patients with the perfection of consistency and temperature that a silly woman could attain by sheer instinct. The old. foreman's house was joined to the old farm- house of Hayston, and formed with it one of the sides of the loan. On the opposite side were the rude offices, flanked by the round tower of the pigeon-house, while the double row of stacks served as a grand avenue or mall. In her maiden service Mally hved next door to her future home. She might personally overlook every addition and improvement which Adam, always bent on making the best of his possessions, was instituting even now \"after hours,\" with the necessary permission, but exposed to the somewhat sardonic contemplation and comment of the present tenants, vice whom, as transferred to another farm and master, Adam and Mally were to be promoted. Adam's efforts at an increase of convenience were not all for his own benefit. He did contrive a stand behind the door for his chest, and knocked up a shelf above the fire"], [50, "38 A SCOTCH THISTLE. for his books \u2014 his old, well-cared-for school Bible and a few more volumes. He held these books in high esteem, more out of a respect for knowledge in the abstract, and as rehgious elements and tokens of respectability, than as means of study. Adam could read, write, and cipher tolerably well as became a parish school boy, but he was no genius of a student in hodden grey. Reading in the concrete beyond \" a chapter,\" a roup bill, an old newspaper account of an accident or a crime \u2014 the last more difficult to compas3 because he did not know what was coming \u2014 sent this son of the soil soundly to sleep. But Mally might also feast her eyes, and did shyly regale them by watching, so short a way off, her bride groom measuring, with his corduroy-clad arm for an ell wand and his thumb for one of its inches, the space of the wall in order that he might select the best spot for her wheel, in the era of domestic spinning. She prized still more than this planning, or that of a second ledge for her water stoup and solitary specimens of pot and pan, since Mally, though practical, was not utterly prosaic, a nail which Adam knocked into the plaster just over the little window, to be ready for Mally's bird cage. Mally had a partiality for birds, while Adam's speciality in the matter of taste lay in flowers. ' The gruff, taciturn man loved, while he blushed for his love, a flower. Mally's wheel and stoup were in the glory of new wood at the wheelwright's and cooper's. She had been occupied in the evenings for weeks making and marking the sheets and blankets which she had first spun. The master of Hayston had undertaken to fill her girnel, doubling for that purpose Adam's allowance of meal and potatoes. The mistress had presented her favourite servant with her wedding gown ; the young mistress, the thirteen years old daughter of the house, had danced about Mally with Mally's wedding cap. The farm servants, Sandy and Geordie, Mysie and Girzie, were coming forward with their respective offerings of mousetraps and pincushions. Mally and Adam were not immensely popular, but it would have boded ill, both to giver and receiver, to prove churlish, not to do as one would be done by in pouring into the lap of the bride the customary gifts when marriage, like death, hushed discord."], [51, "TWO FALL OUT. 39 It was Adam's privilege and duty to bestow the crimson plaid, worked (that is, with the pattern woven into the tex ture), which was thenceforth to enwrap Mally's matronly shoulders, that as maidenly shoulders had been ignorant of further protection than the \" body \" of her gown. Mally acknowledged gratefully that Adam had not spared her, or rather himself, when he spent thus a portion of the savings of his wages. Adam was a hard-fisted man in general ; it was a mercy that he knew how to open his hand on occasions, so that Mally's filled-in plaid was the admiration and envy of her gossips. In no woman was the love of dress, other than suitable, substantial dress, less ingrained ; still Mally had the feelings of her kind, and loved Adam the better for his bounty and for the sacrifice which the bounty had cost him. It was within a fortnight and an odd day or two of Mally's marriage and of Martinmas. The blended dowi ness and mirth of the final ingathering of the crop, and the first slaughter of a mart (\"head \" of cattle), were stamped this year at Hayston with the inevitable heartiness, the important consciousness of an approaching wedding at the farm town. Every introductory act of the drama had been played out happily. The grey Martinmas sky did not threaten the humble, valiant pair, and the peasant home sure and safe in its lowliness. Adam and Mally were in high health and in the prime of their years ; and all their relations \u2014 \" still,\" sensible people, hke the couple them selves \u2014 were consenting to the union. CHAPTER II. TWO FALL OUT. Love is a charm, and led the lovers \u2014 led the whole world of Hayston,a charmed life during the firstweek after Adam and Mally had publicly proclaimed by the melodious mouth of the precentor that there was a purpose of marriage between them, \" for the first time\" \u2014 the first time being that of the proclamation, and not of the purpose. A second time the"], [52, "40 A SCOTCH THISTLE. round and rosy man of psalms and paraphrases, and of ancient ballants and Allan Ramsay's songs in the harvest field and the barn and his own meal mill, shouted forth what rebounded like spent shot, a certain waste of words within the whitewashed walls of the kirk, information which had become \" stale, flat, and unprofitable \" news to the congregation. Only the wild lassie Jeannie Fernie was as ready as ever to draw down on herself a rebuke by giggling irrepressibly, facing right round and poking her bare head into the bucht behind, where those self-con tained, pragmatic sheep of the fold, Adam Urquhart and Mally Gilhaize, were in their places among the other Hay ston servants. According to strictest Presbyterian usage, they kept the Sabbath by waiting on the acts of public worship, singing in a growling bass and a piping treble, praying and listening to the sermon as they best might, while they sat out doggedly the crying of their marriage. Then the first obstacle to the marriage arose in the tiniest httle tiff between two big, reasonable, attached creatures. One night Adam had carried Mally's lantern and milk pails, though it was only from the byre aslant the loan, when the kye were in the house. Mally had not demurred, although the distance was so short that the aid was no re lief worth speaking of to her, while the lending of it afforded an opportunity for broad, roaring laughter to the remaining company of servants loitering about and coming up behind the couple. These women were not so devotedly squired ; those men were simply in search of the measures of milk to be apportioned for their supper, or were in condescending acceptance of the mixed gossip of the byre, before they should retire to a purely masculine conclave, like their higher-born brethren of billiard and smoking rooms, in the gossip of the stable. But Mally, though she was a little calculating and had a false horror of being spoken of and laughed at (the only false thing about her), was also fond of Adam, so she walked an idle lady, suffering Adam to be a little fussy and oppressive in his attentions. Doubtless she was cognisant of the truth, and took comfort from it, that the offence was the result of an abnormal condition on the part of Adam, and was by no means likely to prove in veterate, so as to render the couple permanently ridiculous."], [53, "TWO FALL OUT. 41 But Adam was daft that night, as a bridegroom twice cried may well be. After the horse suppering and his own suppering, hardly daintier than that of his charge, when douce folk were in bed or on their way to that result, he tapped at the kitchen window, the doors being bolted and barred by this time, with a modest request, Would Mally admit him to sit with her for an hour, and bring in the night by the fire gathered and \"happed\" (tucked in and patted on the back as a mother \" haps \" her children) ? or, as the night was fine and not too frosty, would Mally open the door and stand in the doorway for the same space of time with him, watching till the moon rose ? There was the excuse for Adam that the custom to which he wished to conform was universal in his class ; Mally's compliance with his requirement involved no impropriety or imprudence according to the common standard ; nay, Mally had watched and brought in the night with Adam at the hearth and by the door before now without a dream of harm. But Mally did not choose to watch with Adam this night, although he had, or supposed he had, something particular to say to her. Where was the use, she asked herself, of the two waking and watching yet again, when they were to belong to each other so soon ? It would be a culpable waste of a peat fire and an oil lamp, and Mally was no more wasteful of her master and mistress's fuel and light than of her own property. The doorway was draughty, and standing in it for so much as ten minutes at night might cost Mally a stiff neck and a swollen face (as if Mally were not stiff-necked and swollen enough with conceit), so shortly before her marriage, too. And where was the need for the risk ? Mally did not beheve in the need. No, Mally could not, would not grant the prayer of Adam's petition. She was just going to say her prayers and go to bed, like a sober-minded maiden, and she coun selled Adam to do the same. And Adam complied with the counsel, after some parleying and remonstrating \u2014 Adam complied in dudgeon, and what was worse, with a wounded, aggrieved feeling against Mally. The dudgeon was gone by the sunrise, for Adam was slow"], [54, "42 A SCOTCH THISTLE. to wrath, and all the more frightfully implacable in wrath when it came ; but the wounded, aggrieved feeling lingered and rankled. There was a something \u2014 the shadow of a shade of difference in the peace and sunshine of the footing on which the lovers stood towards each other from that night. Mally was sensible of the difference, and resented rather than regretted it, whether she had the right or not. However, Adam was passionately in love with Mally; there was plenty of passion in the man, curbed and stamped down as it was ; and by the close of the second week which saw Mally and Adam bride and bridegroom, the gossamer cobweb that had come between them had aU but vanished in air. On the morning of the third proclamation Sabbath, Adam and Mally, holding their heads so erect, stumbled into another pitfall more rugged, deeper, worse to get out of than what had preceded it. It was not the bride's and the bridegroom's Sabbath out, but there were accommodating neighbours at such a crisis, and Adam, without previous consultation, had ordained bull-headedly that he and Mally should get up at day break, set out on the support of the lightest of breakfasts, and walk till far on in the afternoon to reach his mother's particular \" cotton \" (row of cottages), from which 4hey could not return till the small hours of the following morning. Mally opened her great grey eyes, hardened all over her square height, and distinctly declined the expedition. It was Sabbath-breaking in her eyes. She did not desire to throw the necessary work of her last Sabbath in service on a neighbour whom she could not hope to pay back in kind, though Adam might still have it in his power to relieve the man who fed the beasts and looked after the doors in Adam's stead. Mally's own mother, who lived near Hays ton, had promised to look in upon her daughter after kirk time, to give her good advice, perhaps silently to look at her, though certainly not to kiss or cry over her. The long road to travel, which Adam was so regardless as not to think of, even if the weather were still fine \u2014 and who could depend on a fair day at Martinmas ? (besides, the cat was washing her face and the peacock had screamed) \u2014"], [55, "TWO FALL OUT. 43 would be very injurious to Mally's good clothes. Mally could not go to see Adam's folk in other than good clothes. Adam argued, urged, scolded after the fashion of a turbulent sea furiously attacking and sullenly retreating from a rock. No man likes to be repeatedly thwarted by the very person whose pleasure it should be to please him. It added a thousand-fold to Adam's provocation, that he had committed himself to others before he consulted Mally. He had sent by a chance messenger word of his intention to his mother, he had appointed his fellow ploughman, Geordie, to occupy his \u2014 Adam's \u2014 post. After all, was Adam to give in and submit to Mally's disobliging starchedness and obduracy ? Was he to dis appoint his mother and the friends whom she would have called together to welcome him and his bride ? Was he to be laughed at by the entire town of Hayston ? The moment Mally's rebellion sprouted out, Adam received a dig in the ribs from Geordie. \" Tak' tent, Adam, that the grey mear dinna prove the better horse. Nae doubt Mally will rin nane but a gude gate, wi' the bit atween her teeth, but some men would prefer a less masterfu' mear \u2014 and wife.\" Mally ought to have had regard for Adam's credit ; and her own involved in his, ought to have built them up instead of casting them down. Adam spoke some bitter words and departed alone to his mother's. Mally kept house at Hayston, with a heart that knew its own soreness and was not without its chill dismay. Notwithstanding Mally was a bride, nothing could alter that fact, and by this recurring Sabbath a week nearer to being a wife. The precentor would cry the couple sonorously the third time though Adam and Mally were not there to hear, and before the next Sabbath would be the Sabbath of Mally's kirking in Adam's crimson plaid, the kirking of her life. But what if Adam would not speak to Mally when he came back on Monday ? It was the faintest, most foolish qualm arising out of Mally's own heart, for she did not say a word to her mother, yet it cost the bride, who rarely shed tears, a brief shower of crystal drops surreptitiously shed, and wiped away with her apron as soon as shed. Mally might shed"], [56, "44 A SCOTCH THISTLE. these tears, they were the last she would shed for Adam Urquhart. There were but four days between Monday and Adam and Mally's wedding day, which like that of any other working man and woman was pushed to the extreme verge of the week that it might be celebrated on the half holiday of a Saturday. It was therefore pressingly incumbent on Adam that he should speak to Mally on his return, and he did speak to her the first time he saw her, while he still looked soiled, jaded, and to tell the truth, cankered in temper. To Mally's amazement and indignation Adam made a late, abrupt announcement that he had settled their wedding should be a penny wedding. Penny weddings, or weddings where volunteer guests brought each his or her contribution to the entertainment, instead of its expense being defrayed jointly by the bride groom and the bride, were still customary and still reckoned respectable. But it may be guessed how unpalatable penny weddings were to Mally Gilhaize, and how she resented as next to an unpardonable affront, the proposal of a penny wedding in her own case. The idea had been three-fourths bred in Adam's brain by ill-humour, and the fourth share in it owed its origin to the niggardliness latent in him, and farther developed in his folk with whom he had been in consultation. Mally refused point-blank to be a party to Adam's plan ; refused with such scorn and acrimony as she had not expressed for his ill-judged scheme of visiting his mother. If Adam had taken no pains to dress up his ungraceful amendment to the celebration of their marriage, Mally did not soften her rejection of it and her disgust at its nature. \" You may be married ony way you like, Adam Urqu hart ; but I'll never stand up at a penny wedding, and gin I were to demean mysell, my folk wouldna hear o't.\" Adam was no liberal-minded, temperate, and tolerant man to balance nice questions of authority before and after marriage. It was with him Mally would not stand up, it was with him that she spoke of demeaning herself. If she cared for anybody save herself, it was for her folk, and she put them in the balance against him, and made him go down before them, while the manner of her recep-"], [57, "45 TWO FALL OUT. tion of his will was the summing-up of a lengthened list of slights and indignities. All Adam's worst traits were strongly acted upon and rendered dominant. The savage in the man was seen in the black gloom of his brow and the fierce set of his teeth. \" You are a haughty hizzie,\" he said hoarsely ; \" you are no' the wife for a poor man hke me ; you may marry how or when you like for me, from this day.\" Mally met his defiant gaze with an answering glare from those fixed grey eyes of hers, and the two turned away. It was not till Mally was behind the haystack that she wrung her hands in consternation, and uttered a short, sharp cry, \" Wae's me.\" \"Mally,\" said the mistress of Hayston the same night, \" your master and me ha'e come to the conclusion as you and Adam ha'e been twa gude servants, and as Adam is to continue in our service (and I'm sure you'U aye be ready to lend me a helping hand wi' the sheet and the blanket washings, and the carpet shakings \u2014 you ken me well enough to be aware you'll no lose a' by that, Mally), we'll give you and Adam for being gude bairns, and your friends on your account, your marriage tea and supper \u2014 that is, if you choose to \u25a0 be married in this house, and will accept the compliment at our hands.\" \" Thank you, mem,\" answered Mally briefly, shutting her eyes in giddy sickness for once in her life. The motherly mistress was a httle disappointed, and could not help thinking that Mally was not very grateful for so distinguished a mark of favour. Mally was writhing under the pang which comes from the despairing conviction \"too late,\" and with the remem brance of how she had conveyed back that very afternoon to Adam, to the sepulchre of his kist, the brave crimson plaid. CHAPTER in. WHO WILL SPEAK THE FOREMOST WORD ? The quarrel which was talked of by more than one genera tion, had broken out, blazed up, and, unlike most fires, continued to smoulder for nearly a quarter of a century."], [58, "46 A SCOTCH THISTLE. Adam and Mally had made themselves a marvel, the gazing-stocks of the country side in the beginning. That might be a reason why the couple stayed on servants on the same farm at Hayston, not only failing to lose sight of each other, but coming perpetually in contact. . Their stubbornness and selfishness might be mixed up with the fact. Neither would give the other the satisfaction of thinking that he or she had cost him or her a good place \u2014 which good servants were wont to cling to tenaciously so long as they were in service. It was a boast then of many a resolute and patient ploughman and maid servant that their first place had been their last, until they had learnt to care for children, animals, land, as if these had been the servants' own. Yet another motive might lurk under the persistency with which the pair kept alive the association that linked them together, by not separating as wide apart as the poles, and putting sea and shore and crowds of strange faces between them. In the love to hatred turned it is possible there was a morbid appetite for the sight and the sound of each other. But only a Yorkshire, a Cumberland, ora Scotch lad and lass could have endured the experience, and perhaps not many besides Adam and Mally. At Hayston, Adam Urquhart and Mally Gilhaize abode month after month and year after year, serving each other when their faithful service to their master and mistress demanded the sacrifice, silently. Their companions whis pered and glanced, but from the first they laid no trains and played no tricks to break the deathlike silence between Adam and Mally, or to draw them, in any untoward fashion for their circumstances, together again. The weight of resentment, the depth of sullenness which the man and the woman evolved fairly awed their blustering, rattling, half-childish neighbours. Adam and Mally were let alone \u2014 that last fearful sentence pronounced on un repentant transgressors. Not even Mrs. Fernie dared to speak of the one to the other. As for Jeannie, passing from thoughtless girlhood into thoughtful womanhood, the spectacle of such enmity, so provoked, positively scared her. \"It is fearsome, mother,\" Jeannie would say, stopping her sewing and indulging in day dreams by the window or the fire ; \" they liked each other once ;"], [59, "WHO WILL SPEAK THE FOREMOST WORD ? 47 they'll like each other again if they ever get to heaven ; or will they stand aloof there, think you ? \" If all the inhabitants of Hayston had been as imagina tive as Jeannie Fernie had grown, the two unreconciled foes might have been able to cast a repellant gloom over the open, wholesome day of rural life. But the agricul tural race, superiors and inferiors, proved largely practical, and even Jeannie in her youthful fancies was ordinarily very much occupied with her own important concerns. The Hayston world could exist, flourish, and become hardened to, and to a certain extent unconscious of, a constant night mare in its presence. The punishment fell justly on the offenders \u2014 and how among other galling elements, the flouting notoriety which light women crave, ate like rust into the soul of the proudest of proud peasant women ! Adam's and Mally's \" sticks,\" as Mrs. Fernie had named their pieces of furniture, without any intention of dis paraging them, had been taken back by the mechanics who had furnished the articles, unaccustomed as wheel wright or cooper was to such bride and bridegroom's vagaries, on the payment of a small forfeit. Adam's folk and Mally's folk had alike looked on the proceedings aghast and aggrieved, but had not ventured to interfere with their formidable relatives. The mousetrap, pin cushion, etc., had been returned to their respective donors \u2014 a process which had moved a soft-hearted woman or two to tears. Mally had retained her wedding gown and cap, because they were of no moment to Mrs. Fernie and Miss Jeannie, neither would it be acceptable to Mally's old and young mistress to have their gifts back. The former bade Mally put the unlucky apparel by, and Mally laid it shrouded in a towel at the foot of her kist, as Adam had stuffed the crimson plaid to the bottom of his, where their fingers rarely fell on them. The foreman's house had to be \" wared,\" with a grudge from Mrs. Fernie on Adam because he was the foreman ; but he lived in it as he had hved in the bothy, more ascetically and austerely indeed, for it was a lonely as well as a sordid life with no end in view. Adam might have married to spite Mally : he was a hard-working, sober man, and a good worldly match in his degree."], [60, "48 A SCOTCH THISTLE. Mally might have married to get out her malice on Adam, for she would have made a good wife notwith standing her pride, which she had so closely disguised that her neighbours called it temper, and did not avoid and rail at her for it. Adam and Mally might have married another bride and bridegroom, but they did not so marry. In the bustle of Mally's active duties, going about the house, going about the yard, she was never out of sight of the home which should have been hers, not a day out of sight of the man who in quaint Scotch and German phrase was to have been her \"man.\" She saw the fore man's house with the February snows drifting up its httle window, summoning before the mind, by dint of contrast, the cosie hearth beside which there had once been found a place for Mally's wheel \u2014 Mally could have pointed to within half an inch of the spot selected \u2014 while above the snowed-up window was still fastened the nail for the cage of a bird which had moulted and replumed itself, and sung in season and out of season till it had died a bird's natural sudden death. Mally saw the same house glittering in the golden June and July mornings, when cocks were crowing, larks carolling, and white convolvuluses hanging their trumpets over the hedge of Adam's yaird. Mally fed the fanners with Adam when the roar of the March wind silenced the beat of the machine, and rushing in below the closed door and by the keyhole, caused the chaff to dance on the barn floor. Adam bound to Mally's shearing, as the best bandster to the best shearer, during the long day, among the white here and the yellow oats of the harvest fields. At the shearers' 'leven hours and four hours the two sat in the same social ring, and if Adam did not reach parched corn to Mally as Boaz did to Ruth, this couple ate of the same pile of scones, and touched with their lips the rim of the same cog of ale. A little later in the season, when the September air had a touch of keenness in it, bringing out the scent of the mint in the stubble, and the sound of the crack of guns, and the whirr of partridges' and pheasants' wings flying before the lairds and their sons and guests, Adam built the stacks in the yard, and Mally, in her robust womanhood, equal on a pinch to a man's work, often stood on the height of the full corn cart and forked sheaves to him. After-"], [61, "WHO WILL SPEAK THE FOREMOST WORD ? 49 wards, when her share of the work was done, while her sinews were all strained, her muscles all quivering and throbbing with the toil, Mally would walk out of the house with a straight back and an unflinching gait, and hand up to Adam the pitcher with his draught, which it was her duty to brew for him \u2014 a pitcher given without a benison and returned without thanks. At the milking, summer and winter, Mally now carried her pails unrelieved ; her arms were more mature and more trained to their load ; she could cross the long gloaming fields without a halt. It was well, since she had no longer reason to fear delay in her progress, or the chaffing (\"jawing,\" Mally named it) of the other lads and lasses on out-of-character, ill-timed aid. But when Adam was in the field or the byre with the other men to get the chief sauce to his meals, if any of the kye were restive \u2014 and Mally as the head woman-servant on the farm always milked such kye \u2014 Adam, the leader next to the master, still came forward and held each unruly cow's head or foot, to keep her from doing Mally harm. Mally was not simply his master's servant, and so like the rest of Mr. Fernie's goods and chattels to be guarded from injury under Adam's care ; she was a woman to be defended by a man. Mally had a mighty control over her nature, but her hatred was hke fire in her bones at such a moment, as Adam's was when she held up to him the stack-builder's pitcher. She would rather that the brutal horns and hoofs had tossed and kicked her. He would have preferred if the draught, which tasted like gall to his parched palate, had been manifest poison, that he might have poured it without challenge on the regardless ground. The man and the woman were present in company at every feast at Hayston year after year. Other neighbours changed places, married, died ; Adam and Mally appeared as if they had been petrified in their seats. They con tinued to sit in the same kirk where they had been cried and should have been kirked, and in whose moulder ing corners the echoes of the three cryings lingered and came back tauntingly to the ears which the aging bride groom and bride strove to close against the words. In the same servant's bucht, sometimes side by side, E"], [62, "50 A SCOTCH THISTLE. Adam and Mally sat or stood listening to words of heavenly amnesty and Divine forgiveness. They went forward when there were set in the kirk the tables of the Lord, who bade a man when he would come to God's altar, and had anything against his brother, to leave there his gift before the altar, and go and first be reconciled to his brother and then come and offer his gift. Instead, approached this man and this woman, having their hearts consumed with the grudge which they bore each other, did not fear to eat the Master's bread, and did not fall down and give up the ghost in the act of daring impiety. Changes supplied their test to the faithfulness of the love to hatred turned. In the course of years there came to pass a day on which Adam, perched on the highest step of a high ladder repairing the thatch on the roof of an outhouse, missed his footing, fell to the ground, and suffered a sufficient concussion of the brain to keep him insensible for a period of hours. During his interval of unconsciousness Adam did not lack the attendance of women. Among them was Mally, experienced and sedate, but blanched in her ruddiness as Adam was in his swarthi ness, yet quite as much to be depended upon in the matter of basin, sponge, and bandage as though she were not in a waking dream. According to most novels, Adam, shut in as he was from the outer world, ought to have recognized Mally through his closed eyelids, and while his powers of observation were still in abeyance detected her presence by some subtle instinct ; but Adam was only a coarse and dull fellow of a ploughman, and he had not this inscrutable second sight. On his recovery he must have guessed that there were women folk about him when he was lying helpless, and he might wonder in the sullen recesses of his soul whether Mally were one of these women, but he never asked in order to make himself sure. As for Mally, leaping at a conclusion in her woman's way, she credited that he had asked, been answered, and made no sign; so hated yet the more for his inflexible sternness the man of whom she had thought at odd moments, when he was stretched white and still before her, that she could have taken his place and died in his room to raise him up to rude health and long life ao-ain."], [63, "WHO WILL SPEAK THE FOREMOST WORD ? 51 It was Jeannie Fernie's turn to be married, and in the expanding, infinitely gentle sympathies which belong to great happiness (else happiness is not much worth, either to the possessor or to the world at large), Jeannie bethought her tenderly of the last marriage which had been in preparation at Hayston, and how it had ended with a man and a woman's lives marred. In the light and satisfaction of her own heart Jeannie read the curse of blight and barrenness on two other hearts, and comprehended how the mere joyful talk of another wedding at Hayston must sound to them. She trembled and yearned \u2014 not lest dire discord should break in on all the harmonies of her own life, for, knowing her lover kind in his truth, and herself meek in her loyalty, she could not conceive of such desolation as their portion, but Jeannie panted to play the peace-maker. Mally had been ironing a big washing of Miss Jeannie's pretty new clothes and dainty fine muslins, and was still engaged in ironing, when Jeannie crept behind her. \" Mally,\" she said nervously, \" do you mind your fine lace cap which I gave you when I was a saucy lassie eight years ago ! Oh ! Mally, Mally,\" cried Jeannie, holding Mally fast by throwing her arms round Mally's waist, and braving the hazard of the scorching iron, \"will you never wear that cap ? Is there nothing that I can say or do for you and Adam ? Would he mind if my Wilhe spoke to him ? I think I could persuade Willie to try, and Willie is a lawyer with a wise and winning tongue. The minister is nothing to Willie. Then we might be married on the same day, Mally, and that would break the deed and cover your story with ours.\" \"Never, Miss Jeannie! \" forbade Mally so furiously, as she freed herself, that Jeannie recoiled. \" Me to be spoken for to Adam Urquhart by another man, be he servant or master ? I would ha'e the mools heaped upon my head sooner.\" The warm breath of change had no effect on that black frost of hate. Ten, fifteen years elapsed \u2014 Jeannie Fernie's children were running about her knees ; the master and the mistress of Hayston became superannuated in their in firmity. Mally was a middle-aged woman of forty, Adam an elderly man of forty-five."], [64, "52 A SCOTCH THISTLE. Among peasants the married women age faster than the men, but in compensation the reverse is the case with the unmarried women. Mally was still firm and vigorous down to teeth and hair, with much work in her, though there was a weather-worn look about her, and hard lines in her full-fleshed, fresh-coloured face ; but, notwithstand ing that her dress remained nearly the same, no one would have mistaken her for a much younger woman than she was. Yet if Mally had been a happy woman, in her scrupulously-fitting, well-preserved clothes, her staid fresh ness and comeliness, which had never depended to any great extent on youthful bloom and lightness, might have been little impaired. A proud, honest woman must lose more than happiness, she must lose self-respect, before she can become a haggard slattern in rags. Happiness \u2014 or let it be called peace \u2014 however, if it is not the foundation, is the copestone of the good looks of a woman of forty. Mally had the air of a woman who was trusted and was worthy of trust: at the same time she looked what she was, a soured, exacting, what the Scotch call \"forbidding,\" woman \u2014 a woman who would neither ask nor grant favour \u2014 a woman before whom the younger maidservants at Hay ston either cowered or broke into revolt ; flying or flounc ing to their tottering old mistress, who might sometimes be unreasonable and fretful in her dotage, yet by whose decision her subjects would sooner abide than by that of the beggar made a porter, who was Mrs. Fernie's premier. But Adam was bent and half lame with rheumatism ; it was only by an effort that he was able for a full man's work. His hair was quite grizzled \u2014 indeed, ho looked grey all over. If he were a moneyed man, as it was re ported Adam was, rich enough in his assiduous persevering parsimony to have leased and stocked a little farm of his own, he was far from showing 'it in his person or habits. His jacket was faded and patched, his shoes clouted, his blue bonnet discoloured into green, with the cherry in the crown and the tartan belt frayed into no possibility of knowing what they had represented. His bachelor fore man's house was as cold and comfortless a den as any rustic Timon of Athens ever took refuge in. He showed that a man's self-respect may exist on bare uncouth decency of garment and dwelling. He was a morose, saturnine"], [65, "\"OUT OF DEATH \u2014 LIFE.\" 53 man, who, although he was a good servant, a pure hver, a regular church-goer, was rightly named by Scotch shrewdness \"an auld sinner,\" and was shunned as men shun a famine. The one thing which Adam cherished in addition to his sturdy faithful fostering of his old master's possessions was his yaird. Adam continued to cultivate his yaird, and not only to plant, \" fur,\" and dig potatoes, but to rear in his border a flower or two, which he looked at with grim, dim, shy satisfaction \u2014 did not pull or give away. CHAPTER IV. \"OUT OF DEATH\u2014 LIFE.\" Death, which had long spared Hayston, came at last not for a single visit. The old master and mistress died within a few weeks of each other, in the last year of what had been their father's ninety-nine years' lease. Their death happened opportunely for the entrance of a new tenant. This new tenant was a man of new hghts in everything, holding undoubtingly to the proverb that \" new brooms sweep clean.\" He had been permitted to enter on the farm in spring time, just after the old couple, whose day was over, had passed with the lengthening day and the broadening light \u2014 let good people trust to a longer day that should have no night, and to a hght which as it did not depend on sun or moon should know no setting. The new tenant's first act was to dismiss every old servant at Whit- Sunday. It was the best season of the year for getting field work, if it was not the great hiring term; and as compensation was given to those servants who were engaged for the year, none of them had a right to complain. None of them did complain, and the younger men and women, though they might spend a sigh on their old master and mistress, rather liked the compulsory flitting, for the love of change had awakened among them. But there were two to whom quitting Hayston for ever and a day, was like breaking up the foundation of their hves and tearing up the roots of their being. Adam Urquhart and Mally Gilhaize had come to Hay-"], [66, "54 A SCOTCH THISTLE. ston a strapping lad and lass ; they were leaving it well nigh a carle and carline, faded, so far as they could fade, furrowed, with heavy hearts and tempers, from which the elasticity was all departed. They had dreamt their dream of love and hatred there, and what was to become of the life that was left them, when they should no longer see each other daily, so as to procure fresh supplies of the bitter morsel between their teeth ? The couple might, indeed, take other places on one farm, but that would only happen by an unlikely coincidence. Christian man and woman could not be so heathenish, so devoured by absorbing malice, as to pre meditate and carry out such an arrangement by design. No, there was to be no more glancing from beneath the brows at what should have been her home by Mally ; no more dark looks interchanged at milking time ; no more mocking aid proffered by the one to the other; no more sitting, bound by unhallowed spell, in the same bucht in the kirk, and going forward having hands foul with the blood of each other's souls, to handle and taste the memo rials of spotless Innocence and unfailing Love. The winter snow might fall, the summer sun might glint on the foreman's house at Hayston ; it would be the scene of another life history, viewed by stranger eyes that knew nothing and cared nothing for Mally and Adam. Mally might toil and trudge, Adam limp and grind ; it would be miles and miles apart, and without the knowledge of each other. In the listlessness and depression produced by the con viction, Mally did not take another place, but resolved to go home to a widowed sister (Mally's mother was dead), and work with her for her board. The situation would be mere idleness to Mally, in which she might for the first time in her active, robust life, sicken of a vague disease, or where her craving energies would plague the indifferent, scornful nephews and nieces to whom she would be the tyrannous, crabbed Auntie Mally. Adam, too, though there was no collusion between the pair, would not hire himself to another master. He took a vacant cottage in the vicinity, proposing to live there and work at odd jobs till he could rent a field or two, such as his own powers and those of a yoking of horses might labour, and thus attain the object of peasant ambition \u2014"], [67, "\"OUT OF DEATH \u2014 LIFE.-' 55 be cotter-farmer on his own account. But with no dili gent, careful gude-wife to be perpetually looking after house economies, and to keep his home so as to render it a restorer for a breaking- down man, or to take her share in field work ; with no young, vigorous son or daughter to help to hold the plough-stock or the sowing-sheet when stiffening hands were grown more feckless, the chances were against Adam. Industrious and sagacious in his own hne, painfully saving as Adam was, he could not fight the battle single-handed like a younger, abler-bodied man ; he would lose his hard- won, tightly-griped siller ; he might come on the parish at last a savage pauper, if he did not prefer to starve and die alone \u2014 a beast's death. It was the night before the term. Adam and Mally had withdrawn betimes from the \" soy \" or farewell supper held in the farm-house kitchen, and had left their neighbours at liberty to linger and enjoy the slightly sentimental hilarity, while the two old stagers worked up what remained to be worked before the household slept and waked in their final night at Hayston. The kye, what was left of them, were in the field; but Mally had a light burden to bear compared with what she had often borne over the red and white heads of the clover; and the May gloaming was not dusk enough in its sweet ness and serenity to admit of a fear of bogles. Yet, though Mally had ceased to be haunted by these tormentors, there was danger that even the hard, middle-aged woman might be assailed by ghosts this night \u2014 by the ghost of her own not untender, true-as-steel young womanhood, and the ghost of a man capable of kindness in his severity, and passionately fond in the contracted, gorged channel of his manhood, whom she had gone halves in destroying. By a small circumstance enough Mally was delivered from these importunate, troublesome bogles. As she passed what was still Adam's house and yaird, she saw him delaying the little horse-snppering which he had to do, possibly loth to flash up his solitary lantern for a parting gleam on the all but empty stalls, bins, hooks for martingales and bridles, which he had known so well, and to shake down the fodder for the sole descendants and successors of Diamond and Bab-at-the-Bowster \u2014 fearing bogles in his turn. Adam was in his yaird among the"], [68, "56 A SCOTCH THISTLE. dews, and by the evening star gathering all the flowers which an early season had brought into blossom in his border, London pride, thrift, polyanthuses, white lilies, with branches of budding lilac from his bush and of haw thorn from his hedge. Somehow the sight of Adam gathering flowers and making a nosegay tickled and tormented Mally, and drove other thoughts out of her mind. What would the dour, sour carle do with a flower ? stick it in a broken jug, and set it as, a relic of his garden to adorn the first shelf he should put up in his miserable cottage ? A \" fell \" hke place for a posie, and a fell like man for posies ! Mally would not miss the gowans on the sward ; as for her last bird, it was dead \u2014 better dead, \" poor genty, sing ing thing,\" than beset by her sister's cruel cat and mis chievous, heedless bairns. But what had Adam Urquhart to do with flowers ? and how could he pretend to be taken up with them when he had not so much as said he was sorry to give up everything besides ? Adam was there to answer Mally's question ; as she rose up from her sitting posture, in milking, with her back to the farm-town, she saw Adam standing at a few paces' distance from her and the kye in the field. He looked grey in the paling light, old and wan in his roughness, and, as she had decided, very unlike the fresh, fragrant flowers which he held in his hand. Nevertheless he clutched them, till, as by an impulse, he held them out towards her. \" Will you have them, Mally ? \" he asked, the voice which broke the long silence sounding hollow as a voice from the dead ; \"they will help to keep you in mind o' Hayston.\" Mally might have said that she did not wish to be kept in mind of Hayston, and least of all by him. She might have said, that, as she was not a lover of flowers for the flowers' sake, they would encumber her with a milk-pail in her hand, and what was she to do with them when she should flit the next day ? But she only stood staring at him till the ebbing tide of his blood was rushing in a raging flood to his face. Then her eyes flickered and fell, and Mally held out a hand and took the flowers, without a word either of thanks or re proach. Adam drew a long gusty sigh as though his breast were"], [69, "\" OUT OF DEATH \u2014 LIFE.\" 57 rid of some perilous stuff. \" It's a pity they're no summer flowers,\" he remarked, apologetically, almost pleadingly, \" for then, more by token gin they had been roses, they would ha'e kept their scent \u2014 the scent o' Hayston \u2014 after they were nae mair than a wheen dry, shrivelled blades. But I put some sprigs o' balm among them, and they'll keep pressed in a book.\" \"Why should they keep, Adam, when everything else has gane ? \" inquired Mally, sharply. He glanced at her, and then he offered to take her pitcher. \"I'll carry it,\" he said stoutly. \" It's no ill to carry,\" she protested, but she did not resist farther, or tell him that the strength of his arm compared to hers was not what it had been. There were no longer jeering companions to cry out and affront Hercules and Omphale : Mysie and Geordie, Sandy and Girzie, were at their own firesides, speaking anxious words to haflin' laddies and gilpies of lassies starting at the coming term on their entrance into the world, or rock ing sick bairns' cradles, or pining on sick beds themselves. As for their successors, who were celebrating their soy in the farm-house kitchen, they would about as soon have expected, and would have looked little less aghast, to see the two solid green lows (single hills) \u2014 the opposite boundaries on the different sides of Hayston \u2014 march across and meet amicably and confidentially, as to see Mally and Adam make up to each other on their last night, and break the seal of fifteen years on their lips. These innocent youngsters were still bragging and blustering, drinking toasts and healths, singing each his or her solitary identi fying song, and lighting pipes. \"It's no ill to carry,\" echoed Adam, as he put down the pitcher and wiped the perspiration from his brow, midway in the field, \"but it's long since I've carried anything for you, lass.\" If he choked on these significant words, Mally's heart swelled when he resigned the pitcher, thrusting it into the hand which held the flowers, at the corner of the house. This was the upshot. Well, what else could it be ? and was it not a mercy that not an eye had seen the weak moment of relenting ? The flowers might stand unnoticed amonar the basins in the dairv, amidst the confusion."], [70, "58 A SCOTCH THISTLE. Excited and out of order as Hayston was, the hubbub died out at length, and man and woman were at rest, sleeping soundly after their fatigue and excitement, and in preparation for the fresh fatigue and excitement of the term day. But when Mally laid on the great slab of peat for the gathering of the kitchen fire, she started to hear a tap at the window. The sound was not uncommon of nights where farm servants lodge, only every countryman, far and near, was aware that the Hayston folk would flit next day, and might be seen and spoken with in the course of their flitting ; every younger countryman was occupied more or less this night, if not with his own flitting, with that of his immediate neighbour; none of the women sleeping so sweetly had reason to be restless in anticipation of a visitor. Mally's heart leapt to her throat. She thought she knew the tap, yet how could she after so wide an interval ? Her fancy was playing a trick on her ; she was \" a daft auld maid,\" she said with indignation and scorn, to credit that because one act had been reproduced of the play which had been played out before Miss Jeannie was wed or the auld mistress grew auld (the old figures, every one, had been coming to life again, and moving around her during these dreamy, dreary, bonnie May days), all the acts were to be repeated. The tap came again, causing Mally to shake as she had not shaken in her life before, and Adam's voice reached her in a loud whisper through the window-pane. \"Mally, will you wait and watch wi' me the nicht ? It is an odds from the nicht I socht you before.\" Mally went to the door, though she walked as if her feet were loaded with lead. She unlocked and unlatched bolt and latch bunglingly, saying faintly, with a woman's jealous excuse for herself, to the shadowy figure without, \" It's a balmy nicht \u2014 it's no as gin it were winter.

The sentence was disparaging in every light, yet Mally assented to the condemnation mildly, \" Sae ha'e we, my man.\" Adam brightened the next moment, as men will brighten when their opponents show symptoms of giving in, cheered at the same time by a welcome recoUection. \"Folk may laugh,\" he said, \"let them laugh, Mally, we may do't the morn.

Andrew and David Auchinleck, sons of the parish school master of Auldacres, were about to keep their terms at Oxford. This result was the consequence of Scotch ambi tion and love of learning. The dominie and his wife had both devoted themselves to the object. There had been something pathetic in the spectacle of the couple, in the middle of the birchwood and drugget of their httle parlour, sticking fast to their resolution. The dominie had no fancy for shop after shop hours, yet he denied himself his uninterrupted perusal of his penny paper or his \" daunder \" with his pipe to look at his bees, that he might sit in readiness to help the laddies with an obscure case or an involved construction. Mrs. Auchinleck closed her mouth tightly on her tit-bits of gossip, and nodded dumbly over her knitting needles, sooner than break the thread of Andrew and David's studies. Whatever had been grudged in the thrifty household, nothing had been spared on its sons' education. Andrew and David, two gaunt, uncouth students with fine talents, had shown them selves worthy of the lengthened sacrifice, had worked at home and at coUege and won bursaries and \" grants,\" which had enabled them to aspire to the goal of youug Scotland's ambition, Oxford or Cambridge."], [73, "CURTIUS. 61 So proposed the Auchinlecks, but not so disposed the Ruler of strong men. The week before the young men were to leave for Oxford the schoolmaster was seized with a sudden illness, and within twenty-four hours it was unmistakably evident, even without the doctor's confirma tion, that though the final stroke might be delayed, the sick man would never return to the active duties of his caUing. Dumb consternation fell on the school-house of Auld acres at the doctor's sentence. Mrs. Auchinleck was the first who broke the startled, dismal silence. She spoke querulously in her despair. \" You'll no leave us, you twa callants. Your father yonder has laid out on your learn ing every penny he might ha'e put by. Now ane o' you maun take his place ; ane o' you, gin it be na baith o' you, maun bide at hame \u2014 a' maun be keepit now for drugs and dainties. You're gude lads, you'll not grudge it to your father, who grudged nocht to you, but scrimped himsell that you micht rise in the warld. In saying that, mind, I'm far from saying that you havena done his wull and gladdened his heart. A proud and a pleased man you've made him mony a day, and you've your mither's thanks for 't. But bear wi' me, laddies, for I'm torn and wachted in my mind, and stiU a' that I can see is, that ane o' you maun bide at hame and take the maister's place, and we may do weel enough yet.\" It was but a day or two before that the mother had explained with some heat to her chief friend Mrs. Rymer, the widow of a minister, too poor and of too humble extraction to be raised above a schoolmaster's wife, that to be a tutor or a master at the great University of Oxford was entirely another thing from being a tutor in the best laird's or lord's family in Scotland, such as Mr. Rymer had been in his day, or from being master \u2014 not to say of Auldacres school, but of the biggest town academy. It was more like being a laird or lord himself, Mrs. Auchinleck had declared, and then had gone on to illustrate her text. \" They wear gowns, woman,\" Mrs. Auchinleck had pro ceeded, \"no like the duds o' some o' our student lads, but ministers' gowns wi' leddies' coloured hudes hinging down their backs. I'm no thinking that my lads will like them sair, for they dinna affect fine claithes, at least no Andrew;"], [74, "62 A LAMMAS LILY. Davie has mair o' a turn that way; but they maun be neebour-like. The warst thing is that meddling folk may pretend that sic dress has mair to do wi' prelacy even than the minister's lailac gloves up by; but since we've no thocht the now o' our lads taking orders as they ca't, or having ony thing to do wi' the English kirk (though wi'' their abilities they micht weel win to be bishops gin they cared, or gin it was athegither becoming in Scotchmen and a maister's sons), the gowns and the hudes are just a set aff to the outward man.\" For her own part Mrs. Auchinleck would still have stitched her fingers to the bone and lived on oatmeal and water that Andrew and David might have their fine chance ; but conjugal love and fidelity bade her forget everything save what would lighten her husband's trial. Her two sons did not blame their mother, but thought sUently which of the two was to be the giver, and what was to be the extent of the gift. David, who had been going restlessly out and in all day, now accompanied Andrew as if for a brotherly consulta tion ; but after a few casual, half-idle words on the state of the weather, as well as on their father's condition, he strolled away along the road and through the bare fields, leaving his brother. Andrew went no farther than the foot of the little garden, and sat down on the wall in a familiar half -boyish attitude, to think over what had befallen him, and make up his mind what he should do. But the first thing Andrew did was to look about him and to take in half inadvertently, yet with a kind of morbid vividness, every weU-known feature of the scene. The chief feature was the shabby, narrow, two-storeyed house, the two stereotyped windows below and the three above on each side of the door answering to the kitchen and the parlour, the room which Andrew shared with David, and his father and mother's room with its window unwontedly shaded long before sundown. A few yards apart from the unadorned dwelling was the even barer and more soiled and battered school-room. Across the road appeared the comparatively sheltered and ornate manse and kirk, which had drifted apart in the social scale during a century and more from their old allies"], [75, "63 CURTIUS. the school and schoolmaster's house. There flourished the dazzling drawing-room, in which Andrew and David Auchinleck had been entertained as exemplary lads who did the parish credit, by the minister, a slim man, with a face bearing no small resemblance to that of a skull. The minister's wife, Mrs. Templeton, retained the well-preserved remains of a fair-haired, blue-eyed beauty, and was scru pulously in the fashion. The minister's youngest son, Cosmo Templeton, was like his father, with more flesh on his face as yet. He had been sent away and educated at an English private school, and had been successful in getting a Government appointment. The minister's many daughters were like their mother, but with less pretensions to beauty than she had possessed. They were the single specimens of elegant girlhood that had come into close contact with the Auchinleck lads, for their old playfellow Cecy Rymer, in her faded patched frocks and highly-un fashionable straw hats, would not bear that definition. The whole dramatis person\u00e6 of the manse passed before Andrew as he sat there. He heard once more Mr. Temple ton's mangled quotations from Homer and Virgil, got up for the benefit of Andrew and David, at which the two scholarly young prigs had laughed sardonically in their sleeves. He received anew Cosmo's off-hand, exultant account of his satisfactory examination, which had im pressed Andrew and David with the cool conviction that they could have met and surmounted it with ease any day. All the same it had been a fact that they could not meet and answer, without supreme mortification at their clownish slowness, Mrs. Templeton's light, conde scending, but not unkindly speeches (for she too was the proud mother of a successful son), and the stUl airier flights, for the purpose of interesting and amusing the clever louts, on the part of the young ladies. There had been no fault to find with the minister's wife and daughters in their passing intercourse with the dominie's sons, save that Mrs. Templeton might have been a trifle too suave, and the Misses Templeton too affable. The girls in their pretty fearlessness, graciousness, and gracefulness were dazzling to the youthful hermits, and the manse drawing room a kind of half-pleasing purgatory to the shy, proud brothers."], [76, "64 A LAMMAS LILY. Over the whole of these near objects, with their swift, deadly-lively suggestions, as well as over the dimmer, vaguer, more remote features of the landscape, the scarcely broken stubble and turnip fields, merging into the shoreless waves of the moor, \" casting up,\" as yet, no purple flush on its sombre surface, there brooded an unrelieved pale, misty autumn sky. It was one of those skies in which there is neither clear light nor darkness, and below which gossamers with their clinging haze wrap and veil every branch and leaf. Andrew gazed about him mechanically, till there rose before him in a flash, with a pang of comparison, the stately pile upon pile of noble college and hall, such as they had appeared when he and David paid them a passing, charmed visit to enter their names on the list of students. Fleeting as had been Andrew Auchinleck's experience of Oxford \u2014 the Christ-church meadows, the Isis, the cloistei'3 of St. John's, the tower of Merton, the dome of the Rad clyffe, the galleries of the Bodleian Library, returned to him as if he had seen them but yesterday. With these there came the keen expectations of learned leisure, im proving companionship, rivalries and rewards, which would open to the aspirants courses not unworthy of such training, clothing them with the simple dignity and fine freemasonry of gentlemen. If either Andrew or David Auchinleck resigned Oxford for the present and took Auldacres parish school instead, neither of them had the slightest hope of recalling their decision and reaching the university at a more distant date. It could not be. It would be impossible for the brothers to recover the lapsed bursaries and grants which would have enabled them at present to keep their terms. As Andrew sat there pondering on the garden wall, David returned from his stroU. David betrayed more traces of disorder and vexation than Andrew. It was with heat and passion stirring every feature of his long-lipped, wide-nostriled, drooping-eyebrowed face that David directly addressed Andrew on the question. \" I don't mean to blame my mother, Andrew. Of course she is to be pitied next to my father, but this proposal that one of us should throw up our long-formed plans and take"], [77, "CURTIUS. 65 the school is unreasonable. Think of the waste it would be of all we have done. Of course a person must be found to fill my father's place.\" \"No, Davie; even if we could find such a person,\" denied Andrew positively, \" my father has not retained the means to pay him, and neither you nor I could ensure it. For that matter you are well aware,\" continued poor Andrew, in a dry and surly protest, \" that in any case we should have had to scrape and pinch, and it would have been a close shave for us to keep our terms at Oxford. Then, if we proposed a third party there would most likely be bother from the Presbytery, jealous of its privileges ; but I don't think there would be any objection to one of us filling my father's office.\" As Andrew said this with a tremendous effort at stolid common sense and stony indifference, there rose up before his mental eyes Auldacres parish school on a summer or a winter day. He heard the dull drone of peasant children painfully climbing the first steps to knowledge in their tattered, scrawled over, \"first\" and \"second books,\" with the murder of syntax and pronunciation in the scant and rude fifth form. He fancied himself seated in the master's uneasy wooden chair at the common deal desk, overlooking the long hacked and blotted desk of the writing scholars. While in sharp aud glowing contrast rose in his mental vision the historical and aristocratic common rooms, lec ture rooms, and chapels, rich in carved oak aud stained glass, infinitely richer in their memories, where great English statesmen, lawyers, and ecclesiastics, were nur tured, with their crowd of polished \u2014 for the most part pleasant, even in their exclusiveness and idle dissipation \u2014 \u25a0 gentlemen commoners, and their dons, courteous in their severest curtness. There met and mingled wonderful com panies of gifted men ; there waged vigorous and subtle intellectual contests ; there shone the pure glory of scho larly \" honours.\" \" I dare say not,\" burst out David Auchinleck, indig nantly, in answer to Andrew's dogged statement that the presbytery to which Auldacres, with its kirk and school, belonged, would not object to him or his brother in the room of their father superannuated. \" It is easy for you to speak, Andrew ; no doubt you are the eldest and you F"], [78, "66 A LAMMAS LILY. claim the right of choice, but think what you are dooming me to, how you are blasting my prospects. By Heaven I cannot do it ! \" and the lad broke off in a quivering frenzy of despair. \" fiold on,\" growled Andrew, with a man's growl, in reply to what sounded like a woman's cry. \" I mean to stay and take the school.\" David stepped back, calmed down in an instant. It was some seconds more till he recovered voice to exclaim and argue, and till the colour which had retreated from his cheeks, leaving them blank and white at the immense relief and yet the great rebuke of his brother's announce ment, returned to his face. \" Are you serious, Andrew ? Do you really intend it ? Have you thought what it will cost you?\" and he pressed up to his brother with greater freedom and closer attach ment than the two young men, stiff and almost frigid in their intercourse, and each full of his own difficulties and aims, had lately expressed. \" What is the use of thinking ? \" protested Andrew, gruffly, leaping down from the wall and walking towards the house. \" There is no other way if one of us is stUl to go to Oxford.\" But it might have been so arranged that neither of the Auchinlecks should have gone to Oxford then or after wards, and neither of them kept the school. They might both have continued at one of the Scotch universities, where students of slender means could have lived more chpaply, where clever steady young men already known could have got teaching at once, and spared money either to have paid a competent assistant for their father, or in case of his retiring to have supplemented his retiring pittance, and maintained him and their mother. There Andrew and David could still have qualified themselves for a less ambitious future indeed, but for gentlemen's professions. There was that third resource, and it had occurred to Andrew ; though it is bare justice to state that in the excitement and confusion of David's mind it did not suggest itself to him till Andrew had already dismissed this last alternative with the short conclusion, \" I'll stay. If one of us may make a spoon or spoil a horn at Oxford, it would be a pity he should not have the opportunity.\""], [79, "67 CECY. \" You are the finest fellow in the world, Andrew,\" ex claimed David, incoherent in his agitation. \" None can tell so well as I what you are doing.\" \"Never mind,\" said Andrew, more as if he were ag grieved and annoyed than gratified by his brother's praise. \" I am the elder son, as you said,\" he added, with a touch of bitter irony, which brought David a little more to his senses. \"I ought not to allow the sacrifice,\" David began, with his colour coming and going. \" If I thought I could stand the reverse \" \"No, you could not, Davie,\" Andrew put his brother down summarily, squaring his own shoulders, \" it will take me to do it. And now, if you please, I'd rather say no more about it.\" CHAPTER II. CECY. Six years later Mrs. Auchinleck sat in the same Auldacres school-house parlour, presiding over the early tea of her son the master, as she had presided over that of her husband the master. The lean, active mother was little altered, though she wore a widow's cap of some years' standing, and when she put it on had mourned keenly. The son was in a measure changed. The ill-balanced, awkward student who had taken his father's school had grown into a blunt, somewhat heavy-looking young man, with a threatening of still greater harshness and heaviness in his indifferent-looking bulky comeliness. \"Andrew,\" said Mrs. Auchinleck, \" you'll give yonrsel' a brush up for your brither.\" She did not speak dicta torially, but neither did she speak deferentially. She used the tone employed between equals \u2014 in addition, equals who are agreed to differ, and accustomed to have many a friendly dispute and trial of strength together. \" Not I, mother,\" answered Andrew, glancing carelessly at the sleeve of his shabby school-coat, and speaking in flat contradiction, like a man who had a habit of contradic tion in trifles. \" If Davie would thank me for making"], [80, "68 A LAMMAS LILY. any difference on his account, he is no brother of mine. Besides, you know, I would not put myself about for the Queen's coming to Auldacres.\" \" I do not want to argue with you,\" announced Mrs. Auchinleck, with some dignity ; \" I ken what arguing with a man comes to, though your father was a hantle less thrawn and dour than you are, Andrew. But, any way, you'll not go over to Upper Muirend to look after your craps in this weary allotment system, when your brother is expected to arrive on the first visit that has not been a fleeing ane, because of his reading parties and foreign tours, since your father's death.\" \"I'm ready to start,\" declared Andrew, doggedly; \"I have working-men to pay and working-women to hire, else I'll lose the harvest, and I leave yon to judge whether I can afford that. If you're not content with giving up your room to Davie, making it so fine that he will not know it again, while yon sleep in the kitchen, and if you cannot entertain him yourself for an hour should he come before eight o'clock, you must just send him across the moor to meet me. He knows the road, and the walk will be fine exercise for him after travelling by railway.\" Mrs. Auchinleck fidgeted on her chair and pulled the strings of her white cap ; but though she groaned and sniffed a little she said no more. She was aware by experience that mere words would be of no avail here. She was not a foolish woman. All at once, as Andrew was rising leisurely from the table, his mother, looking out of the window, exclaimed impatiently, \" If there is not Mrs. Rymer bringing Cecy to see us ! When she hears that Davie is coming, she'll never be so senseless as to bide still and be in his way.\" \" Women never mind being in folk's way ; it is my opinion they try to be in it,\" proclaimed the young master in nngallant testiness, as he had to submit to give up his evening's business for the time. \" Good evening, Mrs. Auchinleck and Mr. Andrew. This is my daughter Cecil, if you please,\" said a voice deprecatingly, yet with mild boastfulness, as Mrs. Rymer quietly trotted into the Auchinlecks' parlour, ushered in by the school-house little maid. Mrs. Rymer was a soft, round little woman in black"], [81, "69 CECY. drapery, with an old-fashioned habit of curtsying like the dipping down of a pigeon. Men never bore malice long against so canny a woman as Mrs. Rymer \u2014 a creature who appealed to their pro tection. But Andrew kept his hands in his pockets, remained standing with his back against the tea table, and contented himself with nodding ,to his familiar guest, till somebody else came into the room \u2014 somebody so com pletely different, so widely opposed to all the surroundings, that Andrew was fairly startled out of his shell. Andrew had been souring aud hardening into increasing churlishness ever since the time when, resigning his worldly aim in life, he had thought it best to turn his back on all the pursuits which he had followed for its sake, as well as loved for their own. What would you have ? The sight of his books beyond the hackneyed text-books of his father's school stung and wrung his hidden sen sibility; the touch of his mathematical instruments sickened him. Therefore poor Andrew was not able to pay the debt of his sonship and brotherhood without becoming in several lights, spiritually as well as socially, an impoverished man. He had not completed his offering as the heroes of romance complete theirs \u2014 with cheerful grace, coming off, after all, with little loss. He had taken refuge as far as he could in what belongs to the bodily man, and developed only too much of the brawny rather than muscular Chris tian. He had resorted to gardening \u2014 of the delving and vegetable rearing kind, to farming, carrying out his operations on a batch of the strips of moorland that an enterprising laird had allotted to agricultural labourers ; and he pursued such sports as golf on the golf ground, and curling when there was any ice on the moorland lochs. Andrew Auchinleck was less chary in bestowing his company on his neighbours of every description than his father and mother had been, though he was not actually a very social man. His quick-witted, shrewd mother dreaded in her secret soul, with reason, to what coarseness and excess the reactionary hcense of sociality might lead and betray her son. It was before such a foiled, restive man, still on this side of the Rubicon, ere he had in his manliness stumbled into the slough of sensuality, and defiled himself with vice, that"], [82, "70 A LAMMAS LILY. there appeared in the poor, plain little school-house par lour, not an honest, kindly, half-hoydenish Cecy Rymer, but a living, breathing St. Cecilia\u2014 a brown-haired, liquid eyed, Madonna-faced woman, tall and handsome, serenely beautiful and gracious. The effect was in the air, the gait, and the perfect bloom of womanhood. It was not in the uniqueness or expen siveness of the dress ; for \u2014 except that Cecy's linen gown was fresh and unrepaired, and was made with some amount of quaint, outlandish plaiting and braiding, and that her hat, though it had seen a sea voyage, looked, by com parison with Cecy's shockingly bad old hats, a bran new silver-grey hat, with a silver-grey band \u2014 the dress had hardly cost more than that of the old Cecy Rymer. What had come to Cecy Rymer, who had gone away a rosy round-faced girl, to change her so, in addition to her natural growth ? Hints had travelled to Auldacres in Cecy's letters, but they had been so slightly apprehended that nobody, not even her mother, had compassed their full import. The late dominie of Auldacres had designed that Cecy, his favourite girl pupil, should become his female assistant in the school, since female assistants had come into vogue. When that scheme fell to the ground with Andrew's acces sion to the post of schoolmaster, a distant relative of the Rymers had sent Cecy to Germany to qualify her for the higher order of governess. \" Word \" had come back again and again to the Whins of Auldacres that Cecy was doing exceedingly well in foreign class rooms and under strange lime trees, breakfasting off cherries, supping off pear and plum soup, and lying down to rest under an eider down quUt, with a cuckoo clock at her elbow sounding her reveillee for morning practice and early lecture. Cecy had stayed on abroad, first teaching in her academy, and then filling a good situation in a private family, at salaries which had enabled her to keep her mother \" hke a queen,\" as Mrs. Rymer had declared. Mrs. Rymer had been latterly inclined to cap Mrs. Auchinleck's crowing over her son David, his honours at Oxford and the company he kept there, with tiny crows over her daughter \u2014 the rank of the famUy in which she"], [83, "71 CECY. was established, and with which she saw a great deal of the Continental world, the favour that her employers showed Cecy, and the friendly terms which existed between the governess and her grown-up pupils. \" Poor silly, curtshying body,\" reflected Mrs. Auchinleck in imperious disdain, \" to think of speaking of her royd lassie, granting she's tamed now, a mere gouvernante looked down upon by butlers and futmen, housekeepers and leddies' maids, in the same breath wi' our Davie, a Felly o' his college, in the society o' the grandest in the land, who are proud to be Fellies along with him \u2014 our Davie, who micht be a member o' Parliament or sic like ony day his sel' ! The woman's demented ! \" Notwithstanding Mrs. Auchinleck's scornful incredulity, however, the process of \" like \" drawing to \" like \" had gone on. To a fine, frank, naturally generous nature there is no insuperable difficulty (granted the model is provided) in the growth from a good, ingenuous, bright girl, to a good, considerate, in everything delicate-minded lady. Now that the work was complete and open to inspection, Andrew Auchinleck's first experience was a mixture of consternation and intense, entire approbation. He in stinctively took off the cap which he had put on to go and visit his leased land and its crops, and wished a passing wish for which he would have derided himself had he had time to reflect on its nature, that he had attended to his mother's suggestion, and given himself \" a brush up,\" though not for the benefit of the college Fellow. Not that Cecy Rymer showed any hostile perception of Andrew's rumpled grey coat with traces of ink on the sleeves, his coloured morning shirt, his faded neck tie, which were not calculated to set off the massive, somewhat statuesque, figure and face of a man who looked old for his years, serious, a little saturnine \u2014 truculent, his enemies might call it. Cecy did not appear disposed to be critical on the costume and bearing of her old companion. She seemed inclined to be a vast deal pleasanter and a world less pert than in the days of her non-age. She only looked as if she admired his progress in stature and responsibility, while she advanced, holding out a willing hand to clasp his. \" I should have known you anywhere, Mr. Andrew,\" she said quite eagerly, \" though you are become a big man who can keep authority.\""], [84, "72 A LAMMAS LILY. \" A schoolmaster had need to keep authority \u2014 but I should never have known you, Miss Cecy,\" returned Andrew ; yet he grasped her hand, and the relations established between the two, difficult man as he was to deal with, were at once friendly relations. Mrs. Rymer and her daughter did not remain long at the school-house. Mrs. Auchinleck took care to let the elder visitor know the coincidence of the expected arrival of Mrs. Auchinleck's distinguished son. The unobtrusive widow was not only persuaded that the family reunion would be better without the presence of witnesses ; she was, whatever Mrs. Auchinleck might think to the con trary, deeply impressed by the superior distinction of \" Davie Auchinleck.\" Bonnie and sweet, and altogether prettily behaved, like the privileged friend of ladies and gentlemen, as her daugh ter had come back, filling Mrs. Rymer 's heart with pride and gladness, still Davie Auchinleck was far beyond any of them \u2014 beyond Mr. Templeton and his son Cosmo, who was home from Canada, for health and a wife. Mrs. Rymer must \"mind \" to call Davie \"Mr. Dauvet,\" as Cecy had given her the example in saying Mr. to his brother, whom Mrs. Rymer had never thought of calling anything save Andrew. He was the master and had been so for the last half-dozen years, but he had come much about her house as a callant, and though he was gruff to other folk, he had aye had a canny enough word to her. Yet no doubt it was proper that Cecy should say Mr. to Andrew, as everything Cecy did was proper. While the mother and the daughter did stay, Cecy and Andrew found no lack of words to say to each other. She told him voluntarily that she had just come home on a visit. She was going back to the Thornycrofts. What excellent people they were, and how happy they made her \u2014 Cecy \u2014 as happy as she could be, save for the separation from her mother ! There were old Mr. and Mrs. Thorny croft and their three daughters, each of whom had been, and one of them still was Cecy's pupil. The family hoped that the Squire would soon get clear of his embarrassments \u25a0 \u2014 he was so kind an old man, only too kind \u2014 which had condemned them to live abroad for the family's education, so as to enable them to return and hve at the Hall in"], [85, "73 CECY. another year at farthest. That would be nice, for North umberland was but a step from Auldacres after Germany. Had not she \u2014 Cecy \u2014 been fortunate ? Andrew shook himself half awake from the sluggish apathy which had possessed his mind while his body was having the pre-eminence, and talked of foreign literature, which he knew passably well, and of foreign places, with which, though he had never seen them, he was familiar by reflected hght, until, before Cecy left, he had gone so far as to agree to accept the loan of a new German book of note from her, and to vouchsafe a half promise that he would rub up his German and read it. Andrew had not done so much since he had been schoolmaster of Auldacres. \" That lassie of Mrs. Rymer's is no that braw,\" said Mrs. Auchinleck, in a puzzled but candid tone to Andrew, \" yet somehow she is turned into a leddy, as fair a leddy as Miss Templeton or Miss May. Will Cecy Rymer no be unco out o' place now at the Whins ? \" \"Are ladies ever out of place?\" counter-questioned Andrew. \" I thought it was their mission to walk up hill and down dale, refining if not reforming the world. Did you feel Cecy Rymer out of place the few moments she was here ? \" \" This is a fell different place,\" Mrs. Auchinleck took up the cudgels indignantly. \" A scule-house is surely no like a widow woman's little better than cot-house, though Cecy has paid the wage of a servant to her mother this twa year come Martinmas. Cecy has been a dutiful dachter, I do not deny that. But the humblest scule-house, be it at tached to a charity or a free \u2014 not to say a richt auld parish scule, is the next thing to a seat o' learning. The time was,\" Mrs. Auchinleck continued, with an ostentatious flourish, \" as your father often telled me, that it rankit with the manse in a parish.\" \" The time has gone by, then,\" corrected Andrew, with a man's provoking composure. \"May be,\" acknowledged Mrs. Auchinleck, impatiently; \"but, my word,\" she continued, swelling into wrath, \"the place that is going to welcome Davie Auchinleck, Felly o' his college, may weel be fit to receive Cecy Rymer \u2014 neither more nor less, however honourably tret, than a gouver nante.\""], [86, "74 A LAMMAS LILY. \" Mother,\" said Cecy Rymer, abruptly, as she and her mother paced home in the twilight, deliriously balmy on this June evening, along the unsheltered field road, and the pathway across the uncultivated moor, \" is Andrew Auchinleck so much changed, or is the change in me ? \" \" Bairn,\" remonstrated Mrs. Rymer, with mild wonder, \" didna you say you would have kenned him ony where ? \" \" Ah ! yes, as I should ken that cry of the corn-craik and now of the plover. But poor Andrew ! \u2014 it was not his birthright which he sold for a mess of pottage \u2014 no, it was the intellectual and social pottage he gave up because of his birthright.\" \" My dear,\" objected Mrs. Rymer again, this time more uneasily, though with even greater mildness than before, \" I dinna like newfangled remarks on Scripter. I dare say I'm auld-fashioned and prejudiced, but, if you please, we'll keep frae sic remarks. The minister has aye been cautioning me against the wild opinions and the religious unsoun'ness of Germany, till he has made my hair stand on end for your best interests, Cecy, and you a godly minister's bairn.\" \" The minister might have more charity to spare for the true, kind Germans, the truest, kindest folk in the world,\" exclaimed Cecy, in hasty indignation ; but she calmed down in a moment, in order to reassure her mother. \" Mr. Templeton thinks only of my good ; I know that, and I hope I am right, as you and he would have me to be. So you will take my arm, dearie, for your step is getting a little slower now that we have walked half a mile. How Mrs. Auchinleck talks ! I know our sharp friend is worthy and sterling \u2014 a good, good mother, but why does she speak so much of Davie and so little of Andrew ? \" Andrew Auchinleck was softened by some subtle in fluence from the revival of his acquaintance with Cecy Rymer \u2014 the new Cecy Rymer. He had been tempted, even while, poor fellow, he had been sufficiently pleased with and proud of his brother's acquisitions, to meet David cavalierly \u2014 rather to ignore the contrast which had arisen between the two, and to take nothing off his successful relative's hand, should the latter be so left to himself as to attempt to come over Andrew with patronizing counsel or fault-finding."], [87, "75 CECY. After all Andrew smoothed down his rising temper, and was, to his mother's satisfaction, free and gentle with David when the hero stepped at last on the old stage of the school-house. David Auchinleck in the outward man was ill-knit, irregularly featured, but he was at the same time not only well dressed, but seen in the fine setting of good breeding, and high intelligence. Farther, the comparatively mature scholar was fifty times more at ease and simpler withal than when he was a raw student. \" It maun be his grand education and the rank he has risen to which makes Davie so pleasant,\" concluded his delighted mother; \" for I canna say that he takes it either frae me or frae his poor father, who hasna lived to see these days. Davie is a hantle pleasanter than Andrew, and I shouldna wonder though Davie were easier to serve for a' the dainties and fikes he has been accustomed to ; no but that Andrew's bark is waur than his bite, poor cheild.\" When David the FeUow took Andrew the schoolmaster's measure after the two had come to closer quarters, in more prolonged and interested intercourse than the brothers had held since they were boys together, Andrew little guessed how favourable was David's estimate. David might have got his surfeit of superficial advantages so as to end by sinking them to their due level or below their level, and by turning back to and exalting the primitive qualities ; or he might have had a lurking inextinguishable regret, and borne his brother a yearning grudge -because he, David, had allowed Andrew to play the part of Curtius, and not interposed and himself taken the leap. David said to himself, as they parted for the night, \" A grand old fellow Andrew, sagacious and original ! no boorishness in him can be more than skin-deep.\""], [88, "76 A LAMMAS LILY. CHAPTER III. THE WINNER. The novelty as well as the undreamt-of lustre of Cecy's reappearance in her limited home-circle had its results. ln consideration of the temporary character of her stay, and of the manner in which she had returned, as it were, franked and superscribed by her patrons and friends the Thornycrofts, and further verified by her artistic German music, her feats in water-colours and illumination, and her familiarity with German literature, the four or five Misses Templeton called on Cecy. They had not, save in a pro fessional minister's daughters' way, called on her mother, but they extended to Cecy the actual right hand of fellow ship, which was only to be taken for two months. During these long summer days in the dull country neighbourhood, two of Cecy Rymer's admirers were birds of passage like herself, and were in that dangerous condi tion of idleness which is highly favourable to the growth of a flirtation. It must be admitted that one of these admirers enter tained for her as she knew, and was content to know, a purely Platonic regard. Cosmo Templeton, who was so fond of escorting and waiting upon his sisters' friend, was publicly pledged to another friend of his family who was not then in his vicinity. He was not a bad sort of fellow as men go : a quick, gay, good-humoured, smartish man of the world. He was the last man to be guilty of \u2014 not to say a breach of his word, but of the worldly folly of an imprudent mar riage. Cosmo's father, mother, and sisters, and the young lady whom he was going to marry, if it reached her ears, could remain quite tranquil on Cosmo's fancy for Cecy Rymer: admitting that, Cecy was peerless as a Lammas lily. More than that, the other one of Cecy's admirers with whom had run up in a trice a conveniently agreeable intimacy, was not in an appreciable degree jealous of the Colonial Government official, and of his fair income ready-made to marry on."], [89, "77 THE WINNER. But David Auchinleck's case was different from Cosmo's. \" Scratch the Russian, and you will find the Tartar.\" In spite of David's elaborate culture, he betrayed in this matter a B\u0153otian brutality of earnestness which might yet war successfully, in all the crises of his life, with his acquired dilettanteism. David was very soon very far gone indeed in a violent attachment to the witch, Cecy Rymer. In the teeth of his Fellowship, in reckless disregard of ways and means, he shocked and affronted his mother, half flattered and wholly terrified timid Mrs. Rymer, while he but slightly touched and hugely provoked his mistress. Cecy had returned, in the case of David Auchinleck, to the sauciness of her youth, and was indignant at being besieged, in her own mother's house, by the most aggres sive Fellow who could forfeit a Fellowship for her sake. David Auchinleck, from whose knowledge and manners, as his mother reflected bitterly, more might have been expected, threw discretion to the winds, and pursued Cecy Rymer perseveringly, wherever he could hope to meet her, during these June and July weeks. Poor Mrs. Auchinleck's pride was laid in the dust, and she had great trouble to keep from groaning aloud under the reverse. The little rural world of Auldacres had not accepted with entire complacency the schoolmaster's wife and widow's conceit in her sons. It grinned when human nature returned at a gallop in David Auchinleck. The men at the manse shrugged their shoulders. The women there, especially Amelia and May, and Bab and Harriet, who no longer treated David de haut en bas on their own account, were a little scandalized by his prompt and pointed selection of Cecy Rymer. They were forced to remind each other that gutter blood has along course to run before it waxes blue. But the passing flavour of sour grapes did not prevent the girls from feeling secretly attracted to, amused by, and inclined to promote in a womanly way the College Fellow's devotion to the gover ness at home for her holidays. Mrs. Auchinleck tried her hand at arresting David, on what she held, his road to ruin, without avail, and was reduced to pouring her grievances into Andrew's ear. At first, after David and Cecy Rymer returned, Andrew"], [90, "78 A LAMMAS LILT. did something to redeem his position as their comrade. He roused himself from his wilful mental torpor. He resumed with fresh relish the tastes and habits of his earlier youth, criticised new editions of the classics, and plunged deeper into metaphysics with David. He read Cecy's Freiligrath and Auerbach, listened, edified and entertained by the woman's quick, delicate opinions on characters and senti ments, or he had the evil spirit charmed away from him by Cecy's music, for it was Andrew and not David who had a soul for music. All that was before Cecy was drawn away to speak German or gossip about art or botanise with David ; and then was driven to escape from such engagements and take refuge in helping to form the Tempi etons' croquet party at the manse, though David Auchinleck was also of the party. The croquet players played and jested in the company of their kind, amidst the bright sights and sweet sounds of a summer garden, while Andrew Auchinleck toiled for his own and his mother's daily bread, and taught the young idea how to shoot, in the baked and buzzing atmosphere of the school. Andrew listened to the groans with which his mother relieved herself in his ear, and turned towards her a still, impassive face, white from exhaustion under the burden and heat of the day. He rarely spoke back or remon strated unless the incensed woman slandered Cecy Rymer or accused her of beguiling David. Andrew Auchinleck had always been a just man, and when his mother was glaringly unjust to Cecy Rymer, or even to David, Andrew fired up and came down upon the speaker in not the most filial terms, though he was sorry for his rough words and sought to atone for them in his shy, dogged manner, the moment after they were spoken. It was by no means the fault of Andrew (who kept his mother back from the undignified and useless retaliation so long as he was able, and was very angry and disgusted when he failed as a moral policeman) that Mrs. Auchin leck \u2014 to whom the summer had brought a sore trial instead of the unbroken felicity which she had anticipated \u2014 at last assailed Mrs. Rymer as a secondary cause of the mis fortune which had befallen David Auchinleck. Mrs. Rymer had been unswervingly loyal to Mrs. Anch-"], [91, "79 THE WINNER. inleck for a large part of both their lives, but now she was bewildered, hurt, and resentful : she flew, in tears, in trembling, and in anger, to her natural protector. Cecy in her turn was, to begin with, what she called \"furiously angry,\" then unavoidably struck with a sense of the ludicrous, and at last simply vexed. \" I wonder Mrs. Auchinleck does not get so dangerous and wicked a person as I put out of the parish, since she cannot shut up her distinguished son ! Never mind Mrs. Auchinleck, mother ; she is nearly mad about Davie, and I am afraid she must lead Andrew a sad life.\" But as for poor Mrs. Auchinleck, she had already dis covered that her son Andrew also had come under the spell of the enchantress Cecy Rymer. When the second blow struck Mrs. Auchinleck, and she knew her two sons to be rivals, she crossed her arms, interlaced her work-worn hands, drooped her poor mother's vain, energetic head, and sat for hours unprecedentedly, ominously silent. She was indignant with her younger son ; she deeply pitied her elder, and longed to help him or to console him. One evening, after Cecy's two months had dwindled down to two weeks, and David Auchinleck's vacation to exactly the same period, the manse became so generous in its hospitality as to contemplate a party which should include Andrew as well as David in the list of its guests. \" An important functionary, the parish schoolmaster,\" explained Mr. Templeton. \" Mr. Andrew Auchinleck is a respectable, talented young man, besides his connection with his brother. Ah ! he is a very clever fellow, David, in addition to having his heart in the right place. But he is astoundingly soft, for a college man of standing, on a girl like Cecy Rymer. They say his brother the school master is also smitten with her.\" \" It is delightfully romantic,\" said Amelia Templeton. \" It is an awkward chance,\" the minister pursued, \" but not likely to lead to anything very disastrous with a praise worthy familv such as the Auchinlecks. Fortunately there is no old family here to have their pride outraged by David's choice of a wife.\" \" Oh dear no,\" assented Mrs. Templeton emphatically. \"Mr. Andrew, as well as David, is a kind of old school-"], [92, "80 A LAMMAS LILT. fellow of Cosmo's,\" Mr. Templeton still excused himself. \" You remember we had both brothers some evenings, years ago, before the elder was schoolmaster, when we wanted to recognize them as a couple of exemplary lads.\" \"We remember,\" said May, shaking her head, \"and dreary evenings we had of it \u2014 how David Auchinleck is changed since then ! \" Andrew was invited, and went, after he had nearly renounced the party, at the last moment, in consequence of the irritation caused by his mother's taking it upon her to superintend his evening toilet, while she cast wistful glances at David's faultless tie, boots, and studs. \"You are a braw man in girth and stature, Andrew,\" Mrs. Auchinleck took to complimenting her much tried son. \" Gin you would hold yourself up, and bear a bauld front like your neighbours \u2014 you are an inch taller in your stocking-soles than ever your father was, and that makes a majestic man.\" \" You'll better tell me at once I am an Adonis,\" scouted Andrew. \" My mother is right, old fellow ; you really are a well built Colossus,\" chimed in gracious David. But Andrew was little grateful for the compliment, and more exaspe rated than soothed by his brother's smooth tones. It had so happened, on the morning of the same day, that, as if in the wantonness of idleness and prosperity, Cosmo Templeton and his sisters, Cecy Rymer and David Auchinleck, having met each other accidentally near the spot, had looked into the school upon Andrew among his reading-books, writing copies, and peasant scholars. Andrew had received the company very shortly, and on their lingering had threatened to turn them out and lock the door upon them for disturbing his pupils. David had tried ineffectually to smooth down his brother; Cosmo Templeton and his sisters had slightly telegraphed to each other their opinion of the master's rudeness ; while Cecy Rymer, after having received a sudden violent impression of the seriousness and strain of Andrew's life, had hung her fair, wise head, and felt dreadfully ashamed of having been induced to join in the intrusion. But Andrew knew nothing of Cecy's penitence ; he only knew how inauspicious the visit had been, and felt also with"], [93, "THE WINNER. 81 how little of the coolness of a man of the world, and with how little of the courtesy of a gentleman, he had met the visitors. When Andrew was installed in the manse drawing. -room, and seated on a remote sofa, the scene recalled forcibly that former dubious reward for being exemplary lads which his brother had completely forgotten. David was as one at home on the hearth-rug, impressing the minister himself, who had not gone south of the Tweed for his humanities, by talking of Baliol, the last year's examinations, the Bampton lectures, &c. But Andrew felt anything save an exemplary lad to night. Certainly he told himself that he was the most morbid, malicious brute in creation. He did not free his neighbours altogether from the charge of aggravating self satisfaction and veiled arrogance. But what could you expect of them ? If he were as well armed and equipped for society, with as fair prospects as \u2014 say Davie or Cosmo Templeton, and were not a soured, morose, solitary school master, doomed to drudge in obscurity to his dying day, no doubt he would have been as light and careless as Davie or Cosmo Templeton, now buoyantly exuberant, now refresh ingly tranquil. All was much the same iu the pleasant, slightly showy room, from its profusion of flowers contemporaneously with its cosy fire, to its mixture of dainty fragile china (to which Cosmo had added fur skins, models of canoes, and specimens of mocassins) and its homely Dorcas work, little coats and muffatees, on which the ladies bestowed a portion of their leisure. There was Mrs. Templeton, still sitting in easy state behind her old-fashioned glittering urn. Here was Andrew's superior dominie, the minister, loving to tackle Andrew, as of yore, with musty classics and false quantities, which he was not at liberty to correct. Yonder were the Misses Templeton, not apparently six years older, still in airy floating garments, still with won derfully got up heads ; though the young ladies had changed their style of hair-dressing, and what had once constituted smooth shining rolls and plaits formed now massed chignons and ruffled waves. The Misses Temtile ton remained impressed with their duties as hostesses, G"], [94, "82 A LAMMAS LILT. consulting together, he thought, on his impracticability as a guest, and preparing to show him over again, he verily believed, the old photographs, and to sing to him the old Scotch songs. And Andrew was still blunt to Mr. Templeton, and blundering to the ladies, though he was no longer quite so thin-skinned as of old to pin-pricks of annoyance. How could he be, when his skin bore the scars of serious wounds ? He did not think that he would now have minded much either the good folks' patronising or his own stammering and stumbling, had site not been there to witness his uncouthness. As if for the purpose of contrast, she was surely supremely beautiful and bright to-night, with not only David and Cosmo Templeton and the minister hovering about her steps and hanging on her looks, but the very women, in a tide of honourable enthusiasm which swept away rivalry, combining to exalt and make much of her. Andrew Auchinleck kept aloof from the queen, con vinced that she would not miss his homage, and not wish ing to trespass on old friendly regard and sympathy, though he gave the feelings their due from Cecy Rymer, and did not writhe under the expression of the last on her part. Amelia and May, Bab and Harriet, in spite of some acquired tact, in their resolution to do their duty as their father's daughters, pestered Andrew with attentions, until Cecy Rymer interposed in his behalf. She was eager to hide the object of her interposition, and so she became voluble, discursive, saucy to Andrew for the first time since they had resumed their relations after he was the parish schoolmaster. Then Amelia Templeton, wrapped up in the tradition that Scotch songs were the only songs adapted to Andrew's taste, carried out the programme by singing, to suit his supposed capacity, one of the most stilted, wishy-washy of modern imitations of old Scotch songs. Immediately afterwards Cecy Rymer sat down in the place which Amelia had vacated, and proceeded to sing with fine power and art her grand German \"Adelaide,\" Andrew's favourite song, as she knew. David Auchinleck and Cosmo Templeton stepped noise-"], [95, "THE WINNER. 83 lessly to Cecy's side to drink in more fully melody in its passion ; and Andrew, the ungrateful man, came lumber ingly, and as it were unwillingly, drawn by an irresistible attraction, face to face with the singer. But he failed to answer the unspoken appeal of her lustrous eyes. Cecy Rymer was entreated to sing again. She occupied herself with the pages of a piece of music, trying to steady it on the stand before her. \" Why don't you help me ? \" she enquired of Andrew, almost with pettishness. \" I am neither useful nor ornamental here,\" half grumbled, half lamented Andrew, puzzled, hurt because she was hurt, and with a dubious approach to a smile ; \" you had better get Davie or Mr. Cosmo to help you.\" \" I don't want them.\" The answer broke forth quickly and sadly, and the accent supplied what the words kept back. \" If I cannot have you,\" it said, \" I will have none of them.\" The intimation was not the heartless deception of a coquette who would not be content unless she had all kinds of spoil in her net \u2014 it was the generous abandonment of a woman who is fit to break her heart because she is not permitted to lift up the man who has chosen her, and whom she has chosen, from his mistaken, unmerited humiliation. Andrew Auchinleck would have been a dolt and fool if he had not understood the words. \" If you want me, I'll do what I can,\" he answered with a low laugh, bending over and adjusting what was amiss. His eyes were opened to a flood of light which rendered his unpractised fingers dexterous, and inspired him to hold himself up as his mother had recommended, the most towering figure with the boldest front in the room. The knowledge electrified Andrew; it melted and subdued him. In addition it shrivelled up and consumed arbitrary, acci dental distinctions, and proclaimed him to all whom it might concern by sheer virtue of his manhood with its defects, and of her tender-hearted, magnanimous election, the winner of a woman whose price was far above rubies. Andrew went home in the soft falling rain with Cecy Rymer, and when he returned to the school-house he found his mother waiting for him. \" I ken where you've been, and it's all richt,\" she said to him, meaningly clapping him on the shoulder. \" As for"], [96, "84 A LAMMAS LILT. Davie, he has been hame an hour syne, and he has been rummaging among his boxes and books \u2014 what you might expect, let it be mid-nicht, in a grand scholar.\" Andrew was aware that his mother had leapt to and approved of the end. Moreover she had returned instantly to her allegiance to Davie, her highest risen and still rising son. \" I am going, Andrew,\" said David next day, following Andrew when he went out after breakfast to the school. \" No,\" protested Andrew, in default of anything better to say. \" Yes,\" insisted David, \" I have nothing to stay for ; and for that matter, I have stayed a deal too long already.\" After a moment's silence, he added vaguely, with a shrug of his shoulders, \" 1 believe it is as it ought to be.\" Though David spoke calmly, his face showed haggard after a sleepless night, in the summer morning. He had been as unsophisticatedly in earnest \u2014 it might be because of that peasant blood of his \u2014 in his love as in his ambition. \" I shall probably join Evans and Ingledew in their reading party in Normandy, as they wished me,\" explained David, striving feverishly to be commonplace and cheer fully communicative, and naturally ending the struggle, gentleman as he was, by bordering on bravado. \" After that I shall be prepared to wish you and her every blessing, and stick to my college for the rest of my days.\" \" They are early days yet,\" Andrew reminded him, gently ; \" you'll be our scholar, Davie, as our folk intended that you and I should be ; whom we shall be proud of, whom the world may be proud of \u2014 who knows ? \" ex claimed Andrew, with a fondness which he had never shown to his brother before. It was Cecy Rymer's task to reconcile her mother to her beautiful, accomplished, admired daughter's marrying no better than a parish^ schoolmaster; but Cecy represented to Mrs. Rymer, first, that if Cecy had married Mr. Cosmo Templeton (who had never thought of asking her to marry him, but was bespoken ever so long ago in another quarter), Cecy would have had to go out to Canada, while the minister might never have spoken to Mrs. Rymer again."], [97, "85 THE WINNER. \" I could never have stood that,\" ejaculated Mrs. Rymer, speaking as if even now guilty, judged, and condemned. And if Cecy had had Davie, she would have cost him his Fellowship and his living, the two would have been on the world without a certain bite to put in their mouths, for all his learning, and Mrs. Rymer's old friend Mrs. Auchin leck would never have spoken to Mrs. Rymer again. \" An' that could not have been tholed, and hiz sae near connec'et, and me wanting to consult her \u2014 for she was aye a fell smart woman, Mrs. Auchinleck \u2014 where to win bread for my bairn,\" acknowledged Mrs. Rymer gravely. But since Cecy was so happy as to be going to marry Andrew Auchinleck, all was plainest and smoothest sailing in delectable sunshine. A living was provided, Auldacres was next door, Mrs. Auchinleck was propitious. Then teaching was Cecy's business as well as Andrew's ; she could help him as it had been projected she should help his father. \" Demean herself by teaching in a parish school ! \" Demean herself by doing what her \"man\" did! Her Andrew had said a lady's mission was to go up hill and down dale, refining the world ; and she, if she had any pretensions to be a lady, would refine Auldacres parish school. Would she lose her grand friends ? Let her lose them, if they could be so lost. Her Andrew and her mother were her best friends, and she wanted none if she had them. Cecy's dear mother must and did believe in her daughter's great good fortune and unclouded happiness."], [98, "A TIGER LTLY; A GOLDEN ROD. (A LOST MAN.) CHAPTER I. THE TWO GROUPS. \" Come here, Lauderdale, and see the miserable creature.\" \" A pitiful object, Gregory.\" \" She is sending him back to fetch her dog, \u2014 a dog to fetch a dog.\" \" He does look as if he had been whipped and bidden keep to heel.\" \" There goes the taunting tyranny of woman.\" \" There goes the abject, loathsome mammon- worship of man.\" The two speakers were brother and sister ; though at the first glance of the heads and the shoulders thrust forward at the gable of a high-pitched glass house, which commanded the dale of the Roan and the road to the mineral spring of St. Boville's, situated where Scotland merges into England, it would have been a little hard to distinguish the brother from the sister. The upper gar ments \u2014 linen blouses, considerably stained and splashed \u2014 of the couple, were the same, and the faces were at once very peculiar and very like. They were quaintly ugly, with the physical ugliness which sometimes exists along with highly intelligent and benevolent expressions ; and which, unique and characteristic in itself, when irradiated by gleams of genius and melted and remoulded for"], [99, "87 THE TWO GROUPS. moments by sudden touches of tenderness, becomes often as good as beauty of form and colour ; nay, beats beauty ignominiously in its own walk. The personal speciality of the Wainwrights was a loose limbed, ill-jointed speciality \u2014 shambling in the man, un gainly in the woman. The family complexion was almost picturesque and pictorial \u2014 it was of so warm an orange sallowness \u2014 if it had been anywhere save in the human face, where it had a flavour, false in this instance, of jaundice and yellow fever. The features were of that bumpy order, which must have something intrinsically gifted and benign in them ; for it does not need the recollection of the face of Tom Pinch in mentioning them to remind the world of half the most manlike, womanlike, childlike people they know. The forehead was a very prominent bump, indeed, like a large Swedish turnip, so heavy that had it not been for the cordial twinkle of the eyes \u2014 which it is scarcely necessary to say, under such a penthouse, were contracted by short sight \u2014 and the pacific character of the full mouth, it would have been lowering. The nose was another knob, much smaller but almost equally round, honest, innocent, and comical among noses. The chin formed a third knob in due proportion. The hair was the great point of difference between the man and the woman ; while it was the plainest evidence in both how ill time had dealt with them. Origi nally the hair had been of a muddy buff colour, trying even to a complexion of lilies and roses ; but though neither brother nor sister had reached middle life, in the man it had fallen off, save in fluffy tufts at the sides, giving him another huge bump as a climax, by leaving the main body of his head to the cuff of his neck in unvarnished \u2014 or rather literally, highly varnished \u2014 baldness ; in the woman, it was still a full crop, but so profusely sprinkled with grey, as to have paled from buff to straw colour. Only a peculiar nurture and culture could have developed such unity in disparity with its gains and its losses ; and Lauderdale and Gregory Wainwright had been reared and disciplined peculiarly to their mutual wealth and mutual poverty. They were two well-born, well-educated photographic artists on equal terms ; not that Gregory took the photo-"], [100, "88 A TIGER LILT; A GOLDEN ROD. graphs and Lauderdale printed them ; but that they were partners as well as brother and sister, who had reached considerable eminence in their profession, were somewhat eccentric from protracted combined isolation and knocking about in the world, and had inherited a right to occupy rooms in old St. Boville's House every summer if they chose. They were there now for the benefit of the scenery in the neighbourhood and the country air, with their glass house erected in St. Boville's House grounds, and the St. Boville's House servants fuming, and turning up their noses at the degenerate scions of the ancient family of Wainwright. Lauderdale and Gregory's trade had not been without its effect in making them arrant gossips. From their post in their itinerant castle, pitched in the shadow of the borrowed dignity of St. Boville's, with their three-legged apparatus and their long boxes like Punch properties among the crags, woods, and waters, Lauderdale and Gregory soon knew every face of the company frequenting St. Boville's this summer, quite as well as the woman at the well-spring knew it. They picked up the names and fragments of the owners' histories, discussing the last with as much zest as the most accomplished spinster who attended church for the good of her soul on Sundays, and solaced her taste and fancy by accompanying friends to the weekly concerts given by Ludovic Sutcliffe, Miss Lucy Hyndford, and Miss Clara Mortimer, pretty regularly every Saturday evening, and by taking out the fastest novels in the circulating library to which she subscribed, on the plea, \" They are all nonsense and not at all improving, my dear; but a sojourn at a watering place is an idle interval, and if I am to be excused for indulging in a little light reading to pass the time, I may as well stretch my tether to its utmost extent and indulge in what I feel to be improbable, improper, and exciting in the highest degree.\" Lauderdale and Gregory knew all about the rich young widow who flaunted her youthful bloom and sprightliness, and was at the same time overgrown and lazy ; who would allow no one to contradict her desperate heathens of children, yet led an openly cat and dog life with them herself ; who kept a tame young man hanging about her, a poor, drowned-in-debt, shrunk-with- dissipation, wreck"], [101, "89 THE TWO GROUPS. of a handsome, frivolous, good-for-nothing, good-natured, ci-devant gentleman, whom she would neither marry nor let go, whom she baited and played with for her convenience and delectation, with the false, fugitive attraction of some day soon marrying him and so relieving him from his mountain load of debt, and providing for his helpless, dreary future. And she cared nothing, though the world of St. Boville's, and the great world beyond the little watering place between its heathery hills, commented in strong terms on the liberty \u2014 censured her, cut her. Was she not a rich young widow who was beyond control and answerable to nobody ; who could ride rampant over all the unfortunates in her power, tyrannise over them, abuse them, grind and defraud them, while she indulged herself in a coarsely sensual life, without scruple and without concealment ? Lauderdale and Gregory were watching the bold, fussy progress of the widow with her coerced, hard-driven captive in her train climbing the path among the mountain ashes and broom bushes, rapidly changing into waving bracken and nodding ling, to the well. They were incon gruous wayfarers on such a road, as incongruous as the nauseous, sulphureous fumes of the clear sparkling water at the spring, or as the crowd of omnibuses and cabs, jaded conductors and cabbies, pompous, jaunty, chattering men, women, and children, for the most part showing off their airs, and gabbling flippantly, when they met in the fresh mornings, in that lovely, and, by nature, lonely dell, where a fountain of health was supposed to play for the public's benefit. The brother and the sister were passing their comments and chaffing each other. As they did so, the man's face was puckered and crumpled into more wilful lines and hollows of humour; but in the woman's battered, yet still quite womanly face, there were more indications of linger ing youthful impulsiveness and passionate faith, hope, and charity. Gregory turned away from his glass gable whistling to his work, summarily dismissing from his mind the spectacle which the two had been contemplating, unless he had an idea of recalling it and trying to fix it as an illustration of the lust of the flesh."], [102, "90 A TIGER LILT; A GOLDEN ROD. Lauderdale continued pondering on the distasteful pair caught in each other's traps, for if ever the widow lost sigsht of her cunning1 and married her minion, the world might trust him to pay his debts in two senses \u2014 like all crushed, degraded slaves, to retaliate when his day of vengeance came, in brutal frenzy and devilish cruelty. Yet Lauderdale had some remorse where he was con cerned ; she was suddenly reminded by his effeminate, half effete traits of a young Captain Featherstone, of whom she and Gregory used to know something, and of whose graces, weaknesses, and follies they had taken ample interest in jests and laughter up to the day of his regiment's march out of a garrison town, the first stage of its campaign on active service, in which, at an early date, in a nameless skirmish with the crouching, savage Maories, the dandy captain was shot dead in the scrub. Lauderdale could never again think of his locket on his breast, his glass in his eye, his drawl and his strut, without having another vision of him, stripped of his elegancies and affectations, a poor, simple young fellow of no more than three or four and-twenty, rolling on the bloody earth, clutching at the thorny bushes for lack of friendly hands to hold by, and with nothing but the night wind over a wilderness to dry the sweat breaking upon his brow and the froth bubbling from his lips. And that wide, yet close, wonderfully tender saying on hard Scotch lips, \"aye somebody's body,\" would hover before her imagination. Lauderdale drew a great sigh. \" Greg,\" she apostro phised her companion abruptly, \" surely there is no yoke so base, no bondage so bitter, no toil so hard, as that to which a man bows who thinks to get a vain, selfish woman's goods to endow himself withal, by wooing her idle pleasure.\" Gregory looked round, and raised his bushy eyebrows and hunched his round shoulders in a little surprise. It was not often that Lauderdale's staid and crushed-down woman's nature rose so vehemently to the surface. \" Laud, my daughter,\" Gregory addressed his two years younger sister, \" don't you go in for fallen men. The next thing you will be setting up a follower yourself, breaking him in as your helper and successor on a new and approved plan, just to show other independent women the"], [103, "91 THE TWO GROUPS. proper method, kicking him, and getting kicked in turn, and that would not suit my book at all, at all. Two are company, three none. There's room for a pair of us, but there ain't room for an interloper, my chum.\" Lauderdale laughed with a whole heart and a clear conscience, and shook off the cloud shapes of vague yearn ing and incipient discontent and indignation which had beset her fancy. The artists were not to get rid so easily of the ram pageous, rollicking widow and her pitiful prey \u2014 nor to be rid of them at all till they had cost them dear. It was afternoon at St. Boville's House \u2014 the hereditary great house \u2014 stern and narrow, dark and dismal in its hard, cold stone square, with its court and its pillars bear ing urns, looking as if they held in perpetuity the ashes of the old Wainwrights of St. Boville's, and its walls bursting into a dank dew and flushing into a darker red of lichens, as though in horror and contempt of the strag gling masses of rickety, garish, fantastically- shaped shells of flowery villas springing up like dragon's teeth, in a night, all round it. At St. Boville's House, dry David Hume had speculated acutely, summed up caustically, touched formally the dead bones of history, himself in wig and ruffles, paying homage to a great lady of the old quality. Home had ranted gran diloquent tragedy, taken lightly his deposition from the priestly office by his Presbyterian fathers, and been bear leader to the bravest boy and man, the tenderest, most faithful heart \u2014 which would not lie in Westminster Abbey as Lord Lynedoch, but would lie as Thomas Graham of Balgowan in Methven Kirkyard by the bride dead for half a century \u2014 in broad Scotland. St. Boville's House retained a faint flavour of those wonderful people. Gregory and Lauderdale Wainwright had dined, to the scandal of the snappish, overbearing servants, at the ante diluvian hour of noon, and repaired not to the gaunt, white, dimity shrouded drawing-room, but \u2014 taking advan tage of the very best part of old St. Boville's, its capa bilities for life in the open air \u2014 to the terraced garden and green grassy slopes studded and bordered by big umbrageous trees descending to the Roan water. There word was brought to the brother and sister that a party"], [104, "92 A TIGER LILT; A GOLDEN ROD. were at the photographic establishment wanting to be taken on the spot, demanding the instant attendance of the performers, and impatient and indignant that such small folks as photographers should have bodily wants and think of relieving them by dinners, while such great folks as distinguished sitters were kept waiting. So Gregory and Lauderdale turned to walk back, Gregory insisting that he would take his own time to put himself in harness, and Lauderdale expediting him by all the means in her power. Arrived at the glass house, Lauderdale and Gregory found the widow, Mrs. Somer, flying about like a caged magpie (for already there were little bits of white let in here and there, to relieve the sombreness of her rustling crape and silk), stopping short to deliver audibly her decided opinion upon the personal appearance of the pho tographers \u2014 \"What a scarecrow! What a tabby! \" She had with her the aspirant to her heart, hand, and income, Mr. Hopkins, trying to cool and compose her ; and so heated and ruffled was he in the fruitless effort, that he was constantly fluttering his white handkerchief out of his coat-pocket like an ineffectual flag of truce, and lifting and replacing his hat on his head, the silky brown hair of which was worn and getting thin on the temples \u2014 but not with thought \u2014 as if it were a safety-valve for his feverish unrest and deadly weariness. And there were Mrs. Somer's promising progeny, four in number, the queerest, most repulsive nondescripts of three long-limbed boys (if the widow were only thirty-six, as she gave out, she must have married from the school-room), in frock-like kilts with braided jackets, which might have been made for their sister, by the same dressmaker, showing long drawn out bare throats decked with crinkling neck-ribbons, and surmounted by heads having the hair divided up the centre, and curled in rows ; and of one girl wearing navvy boots, long white trowsers, a regular little coat with pockets, and a small sailor's hat above short-clipped hair \u2014 the only boy among them. They had dispersed to mis chief the moment they had entered the room ; had already smashed a jar and evolved an awfully Plutonic smell, and were then engaged in hunting an unhappy, long-haired little dog, which was their property, and that had grown"], [105, "93 THE TWO GROUPS. querulous by much human worrying, round cameras and tables, in among half-dried plates, prepared to dip it bodily in a pail of strong acid with which they were liberally sprinkling, and burning the matting. \"Hallo!\" cried Gregory, without restraint, standing still on his threshold ; \"I cannot understand this.\" Mrs. Somer, in defence of herself and her young, attacked him with the loud volubility of a common, brawling scold : \" I read an advertisement in the well room ; and I came here, like a fool, I may say, to patronize you, and found nobody.\" \" Some patronage is so overwhelming,\" suggested Gregory, coolly. \" The advertisement was of specimens of landscape photography to be had here,\" put in Lauderdale ; \" and the hours appointed for any sitters were from four to six.\" \" Oh ! I daresay ; but who minds hours in attending to business, I should like to know ? I can tell you anything else won't do, if you wish to get on. What I wish is to be back at my house \u2014 Ivy Lodge \u2014 for tiffin at three, so you will make haste and take us at once. Charley, don't untie your riband, you slovenly hobbledehoy. Missy, put on your gloves this minute, you nasty, naughty girl ! you have smeared your hands as black as a native's. Mr. Hop kins, I wonder at you, that you don't look after the children, and prevent them making frights of themselves, when you pretended you wished our likenesses.\" There was a simper brought in here. Certainly the widow had been a wife in Her Majesty's oriental possessions. It reads like a libel on the land of great, gentle elephants, gliding, salaaming Hindoos, even of flower-strewn heathen temples, but all such women do come from India, as all such baited, forlorn men, like her admirer, are found in some learned profession \u2014 advocates without briefs, doctors without patients, priests without cures. Mr. Hopkins lifted his hat, and replaced it more help lessly then ever ; glanced at Lauderdale and Gregory furtive looks from eyes wandering slightly, glazed, sur rounded by crows'-toes, though, assuredly, he was not older than Mrs. Somer said she was."], [106, "94 A TIGER LILT; A GOLDEN ROD. \" Upon my word, Mrs. Somer, I cannot help them ; they will not attend to me. Freddy, let that slide alone ; Missy, put on your gloves when your mamma bids you. \" You're a muff, Mr. Hopkins, not to touch what you like,\" shouted Master Freddy. \" You're an impudent, rude wretch to meddle with me,\" protested the still more demonstrative young lady. \" They don't attend to you, naturally,\" explained Mrs. Somer; \"for they don't attend to me, not one word. There never were such children, nor a woman so tried. I know they will live to break my heart, and bring my grey hairs in sorrow to the grave, where the grass on their angel of a father's is not green, and he has left me alone to fight with them,\" cried Mrs. Somer, sinking into a chair in the most astounding paroxysm, actually raging, panting, quivering, whimpering in one breath ; while of the cul prits, two turned their backs not to see mamma in one of her tantrums, and two looked on in stolid indifference. One of Mrs. Somer's idiosyncrasies was this rapid, violent change of mood. She was a creature who lived in scenes, whose native air was squalls, all the more degrading because of their petty origin. \" You are too sensitive ; you must not agitate yourself. Pray try to swallow a glassful of water,\" pressed Mr. Hopkins, handing the oppressed lady a glass from the table. \"What ! with that horrid stuff in it ? \" demanded Mrs. Somer, bouncing up, and upsetting the glass in the act of pointing furiously to a sediment in its contents, which her anxious attendant had overlooked. \" Do you want to poison me, Mr. Hopkins ? Oh, what a world ! \" \" Forgive me ; pray do forgive me. It was shockingly stupid and careless, but I was so engrossed with your little nervous attack. Why do you keep such things standing about ? \" backing out fiercely on Lauderdale and Gregory, who had been put in the background, as Mrs. Somer, with her inimitable conceit and brazen audacity, would have put the Queen at her own drawing-room, in the background, had Mrs. Somer been admitted to kiss hands. But in the lull of the lady's angrily shaking her dripping silks, and of her sulky resistance to the offender striving to make his peace, Gregory cleared his throat sonorously \u2014"], [107, "95 THE TWO GROUPS. he thought of leaping on the top of his camera, if it would have borne him, and using it as a rostrum to secure a hear ing \u2014 and addressed the audience: \u2014 \"Ladies and gentle men, I am sorry to intrude upon you, but photography is dabbling in chemicals ; and I am forced to warn you for your own safety. If you don't keep your hands and your feet to yourselves \" (the progeny were starting anew to ransack destructively drawers and cases, and to hunt the unhappy dog to its doom), \"for the protection of human beings and a dumb animal, we \u2014 I and my partner \u2014 will be forced to show you out, as we keep no servant to perform the ceremony ; otherwise we shall undoubtedly be all blown up, or burnt to a cinder, or come to. great grief in some other way or ways unsuspected as yet. If we survive, we shall be compelled, as we are men \u2014 that is, a man and a woman \u2014 who live in a measure by the tools of our trade, to charge all the additional expenses, including, of course, the coroner's \u2014 no, we have no coroner's inquests in Scot land, and the country provides for them where they do occur \u2014 but the necessary burial fees to your account.\" \" Good gracious ! What does the man mean ? Is he mad ? \" asked Mrs. Somer candidly. But though offended and disgusted, being notably obstinate, and having come that day to the glass house to have her likeness taken, she intended to stay till she had attained her object. Without a selfish end in view, she would have fled, the first clamor ous coward, at the dimmest smoke wreath, the remotest report of danger. Lauderdale spoke a little aside to Gregory, \" Have nothing to do with them, Greg, they are odious subjects, and I foresee, though she has the cards of terms in her hand, she will try to beat us down and fight a battle with us before she pays us.\" They were odious subjects. Mrs. Somer was plump with a puffed up, gorged plumpness, crammed into a paletot fitting tight to the back here, and bulging out there at the blown-up, vibrating skirt. Her face was encircled, not shaded, by a diminutive, quasi-mourning bonnet. The face itself was of an ugly, gross comeliness, smooth as fat, good living, and incarnate selfishness could make it ; the same elements were visible in the Flemish red and white of the colour, speaking of an ample allowance of beef and"], [108, "96 A TIGER LILT; A GOLDEN ROD. bread, tempered by good ale and wine; the white, glancing, prominent, modified boar's teeth seen through the full animal red lips ; and the equally animal straight, small nose, the light, round, utterly, unreasoning, slightly \"raised\" eyes; the glossy, bright brown hair carefully trained into the smoothest of round braids on the forehead and cheek, and falling down in wanton, waving curls on the shoulder \u2014 those curls which hang so innocently on girls' shoulders, as frank speeches fall guilelessly from girls' lips, but which can be so immodest an adornment elsewhere. This was the central figure to the nondes cript, grimacing, lowering-faced boys and girl, and the poor, degraded swell, fain to sell himself for a mess of pottage, and very likely unable to resist lifting his hat and nourishing his handkerchief at the critical moment of the operation. But Gregory judged otherwise. \" Not at all, Laud ; I am persuaded that I have a decided Hogarthian bias, and I have often projected a Hogarthian series of photographs. Here is a fine beginning for a modern set of Marriage a la mode.\" \" But the widow does not propose to figure in a tableau. There, then, if they are to be taken, let us divide them and have done with them. Do you fix the man, if you can steady him, and leave the widow to me,\" for at that moment, influenced by the contradictory feelings which he recalled with regard to the old popinjay, Captain Feather stone, Lauderdale felt more averse to the man. Mrs. Somer negatived the suggestion flatly. \" If I am to pay a first-class price for my carte, it is not to have it taken by a woman. How absurd ! I never heard of such a thing. I am always accustomed to have the first and the best of everything. If your husband, or master, or whoever he may be, has not time for all of us, the children and Mr. Hopkins can wait till another day \u2014 can't you, Mr. Hopkins ? \" \" With all my heart, Mrs. Somer, if you get justice done to you ; but I am afraid in such a case, not even the sun can be fair.\" There followed a great bustle of placing the widow and adjusting her drapery, her satellite lending himself to fulfil her exactions, caprices, and vulgar inclinations to"], [109, "97 THE TWO GROUPS. whatever was artificial, affected, ostentatious, though not without affording indications that he had been one of the thousand and one amateur photographers, whose dabbling through all its superficiality had been of promise, and whose original better taste, as well as his greater culture, disposed him to different results. Lauderdale kept aloof from the sitting, only near enough to restrain Gregory's effrontery in quizzing the egregiousness of the folly before him, though Mrs. Somer was too obtuse to suspect the offence, and Mr. Hopkins too weak to resent it. Twice Gregory was catching the lady in an attitude and expression of ineffable vanity and arrogance, not without its hoidenishness at the height of its pomposity, when she disappointed his hopes and overturned his arrangements by the most irrelevant interruptions. \" Horatio, you lout, haven't I told you a thousand times not to stand loafing with your hands in your pockets ? \" \" Missy \u2014 Madam, mind your upper lip. If you pull it out as you are doing, I'd as soon have the lowest Coolie's face in my album, as yours.\" \" The woman is a fantastic idiot ; stark, staring mad: I believe,\" muttered Gregory between his teeth, for his punishment. He made another speech aloud : \" My chemicals are ticklish affairs, I am afraid they won't stand being trifled with much longer. My time, though it is the better part of my capital, counts for nothing. I'm at your service, ma'am, till dark, or we can try the moon if you like : rather a vague impression, but unique. Put me out of the reckoning ; but pray consider the chemicals. I cannot answer for their behaviour. I fully expect them to fizz up and burst from their confinement presently.\" Mrs. Somer stared, tossed her head, gave it as her opinion that the announcement was horribly disagreeable, and the trade which could justify it a shocking bore and detestable nuisance ; but she sat still for three minutes, and the desired impression was obtained. At the first glimpse, Mrs. Somer announced herself extremely dissatisfied with the work. It was not a good view of her face \u2014 it damaged her profile \u2014 it spoilt her expression; for that sly, sullen look was not hers. She would appeal to Mr. Hopkins if she were sly or sullen : if she had faults, slyness and sullenness were not among n"], [110, "98 A TIGER LILT; A GOLDEN ROD. them. Why were her hands so large ? She had a plump hand, but not a hand like her cook's. Why did they not prevent her from putting them out before her, if that was what did it ? She might have had feet like a ploughman's, too ; for what could she know of such trumpery rules ? It was dreadful to find people with so Httle consideration in their own business. If Charley put his finger on the plate to rub it in the least particular, she would box his ears soundly for him on the spot. Mr. Hopkins, in the character of a hapless echo, assented to every one of her contradictory assertions, and endorsed all her objections, notwithstanding the widow would have been better pleased if he had praised the likeness without stint. She grew pettish and cross, as well as unbearably, brutally self-satisfied and despotic. She flounced away to put on her bonnet, and began to complain loudly and bitterly of the imposition which had been practised upon her by the charge for what was, after all, photography not at all out of the common \u2014 really second-rate, inferior to what she had been familiar with, though it was done by people who set up their establishment in St. Boville's House, and went through the form of implying that they were exclusive in their sitters, as well as in their charges (there had been the attraction to the vain, grasping harpy). But if they did not let down their rate to her after their negligence in keeping her waiting, to begin with, and the imperfections which she had taken the trouble to point out in the carte, she should be obliged to call them \u2014 well, it had an odd look, a man and a woman engaged in a trade on an equality with their superiors, as they affected to be \u2014 little better than impostors. \" Call us what you please, ma'am,\" Gregory assured the widow, gruffly, getting tired of the scene, \"we shan't be at all put out; I do not even think that we shall inquire whether the names are actionable, and carry them into a court of law.\" When the last attack was begun by Mrs. Somer, Mr. Hopkins had fidgeted dreadfully, his wan face had flushed crimson, he had approached a cabman's refuge of slapping his breast, biting his nails, and scratching his head. But he dared not oppose his English Begum. His mortifica tion and misery at the misconduct of the woman whom he"], [111, "99 THE TWO GROUPS. was urgently soliciting to allow him to bestow on her his name, and to give him her irksome, intolerable company for life, \u2014 in return for letting herself be decoyed and betrayed into becoming liable for his load of debt, which had been contracted so long ago now that he scarcely remembered having been a free man, but had always had the load looming more heavily and darkly over him, and of pledging herself to support him for the rest of his bartered, dishonoured days, \u2014 must find another vent. Shame and vexation took the turn of goading and spurring on the naturally easy-tempered, free-handed reprobate to out- Herod Herod, fie blustered to and bullied the artist brother and sister, on Mrs. Somer's rank, influence, know ledge, and on the unheard-of confidence and presumption of their claiming from her greater remuneration than she was inclined to give, until even Mrs. Somer stared at the fury of her companion. She connected it erroneously with certain data she had meanly scraped together and hoarded up, of former habits and humours of Mr. Hopkins, which he had not dared to give way to on late occasions, for the trembling chance of success in his aim at fat, fair and forty, comfortable widowhood \u2014 in juxtaposition with un bridled worldliness, violence, levity, and ignorance. Mrs. Somer was diverted from her purpose by a new and more engrossing personal interest \u2014 to sift her groundless and unjust suspicion to the bottom. She actually yielded her point with a very bad grace, paid Gregory his due with only an additional protest and defiance, and walked off with her man. Gregory twisted his hands in what was left to him of hair, and stamped up and down to feel himself rid of the incubus. \" Faugh ! Marriage a, la mode, like love in a cottage, looks best at a distance, and has its disadvantages when one is brought to close quarters with the actors. Upon my word, Laud, I am sorry for the poor, incapable, imbecile candidate who showed fight at last \u2014 poor beggar ! \" \"You have very little to do with your pity,\" said Lauderdale, fairly outraged on this occasion. \"A being with the name of man to associate himself voluntarily with such a woman, in such a life, and to come into other men and women's company and listen to and back up her coarse, delirious tirades ! The singers at the Saturday"], [112, "100 A TIGER LILT; A GOLDEN ROD. evening concerts, Ludovic Sutcliffe, Miss Lucy Hyndford, and Miss Clara Mortimer, are patterns of modesty and respectability in comparison.\" Lauderdale stopped short awkwardly : while the words were on her lips, the door of the glass house to which Gregory had his back, swung open with an impressive swing, and Ludovic Sutcliffe, Miss Lucy Hyndford, and Miss Clara Mortimer stood in the doorway. The Wainwrights knew the singers quite well by sight, though the brother and sister had only been to one concert (indeed, were not the style of people who frequent Satur day evening concerts), for not merely were there cartes of the originals in a variety of characters displayed pro minently in the booksellers' windows, but in the dearth of public personages at St. Boville's these formed its staple lions. The singers were regarded by the visitors at the wells, particularly by the very young people and the maiden ladies among them, with lively interest, and invested with a halo of pinchbeck romantic adventure and peril, so that a stranger could not walk abroad without hearing it whispered on all sides with a thrill of excite ment, \" Ludovic Sutcliffe is mounting the Bunch of Grapes omnibus \u2014 a fact, I assure you. Look, up there beside the driver.\" \"Did you pass Miss Lucy Hyndford at the well this morning ? Her complexion is rather chalky by day light, but her fine profile told so last concert night when she turned it towards the audience as she was singing ' Thou art so near and yet so far.' \" \" Well, I think Miss Lucy Hyndford is the more elegant of the two, but Miss Clara Mortimer is my favourite. Of course, I mean in the Rooms, for the worst of them, poor things, is that nobody but gentlemen can know people of their profession in private. When she gave 'Within a Mile of Edinburgh Town' her nods and dimples were irresistible.\" Ludovic Sutcliffe came into the photographic saloon (pro tempore) as if he were taking a step on the boards, made a professional bow, and spoke in a rich baritone as he introduced himself and party : \" Ludovic Sutcliffe, Miss Hyndford, Miss Clara Mortimer, \u2014 Mr. and Miss Wainwright, I presume. Artists ought to know each other. We have come to ask you to give us a new examj>le of your art \""], [113, "THE TWO GROUPS. 101 Ludovic Sutcliffe was a thick-set, heavy-featured, tallowy complexioned man, between thirty and forty. His white vest and white gloves on concert nights, and the abundance of jewellery in pins and rings which he indulged in, even of a morning, only rendered more hopelessly inelegant and unrefined his personal traits. He looked a grave, down right, retiring, rather surly fellow; but from the exigencies of art and the compass of his voice, it had fallen to his lot to represent, in combination, what may be entitled the popular brigand and rover, and the comic singer of the party, and his resounding mellow voice carried him, in St. Boville's opinion, in triumph through the forced flash ing, dashing attributes of the one, and the clumsy, rollick ing gambols of the other. Miss Lucy Hyndford, in a picturesque red and black shawl and rustic straw hat, with her sallow, thin, regular featured face, and her naturally languishing, die-away air, was much better fitted for a tragic soprano; and it was generally said by her admirers that she was studying for, and coming out in, at some 'happy epoch of her life, what they regarded her as singularly gifted for \u2014 the regular opera. Miss Clara Mortimer, in a dingy white gown and faded blue ribands, was several shades less successful in the character of the buxom alto who is for ever rallying, teasing, and distancing her lovers. Such a role suits best with budding, frolicsome, care-free girlhood ; and Miss Clara Mortimer's bloom was the blowsy bloom with the unmistakable realization of drought, damp, dust, and early frost, of a mature prime. Her stout figure and loud, often grumbling, tongue were more appropriate \u2014 where, indeed, they were to be met with every morning \u2014 in the market, driving bargains for the household provisions, than ex changing badinage with a lover over a honeysuckle barrier, under the evening star, when her strong arm bore no load more cumbrous than a new wicker basket full of balls of white cotton for eggs, or a brightly burnished empty milk-pail. But the three artists, as they called themselves, with as good a right as that of many other claimants to the name, contributed, for the salary which was their daily bread, in no small degree, to the entertainment of the sojourners at"], [114, "102 A TIGER LILT; A GOLDEN ROD. St. Boville's, at other times than on Saturday evenings. When they were supposed to retire into private they carried the plague of popularity with them, not resenting it, on the contrary accepting it in a simple enough fashion as a tribute to their talents, and an indemnification for their sacrifices. They dwelt together in a moderately expensive lodging, quietly and inoffensively, so far as the St. Boville's world knew. The one thing in their arrangements which troubled the world's nice sense of propriety was that the two unmarried women had no matron to chaperon them, and that a pro fessional connection was all they recognized with Ludovic Sutcliffe, who walked with them, doubtless ate his meals in their company, and was heard speaking to them in the authoritative, unceremonious tone of a male relative. The varying, shifting world of professional men's and merchants' families, retired officers and professors with their households, come to spend their summer holidays at St. Boville's, had two readings of the riddle. One (for the most part the men's) was the rational conclusion that as Miss Clara Mortimer was no girl except by courtesy, and when she was executing \" Kate of Coleraine \" and \" Coming through the Rye \" before the footlights, she was to all intents a matron, in so far as being able to take care of herself and her companion was concerned. The other reading had its origin in the fact that St. Boville's was a mystery and an incident-loving world, and had therefore been so good as to add to the fascination with which it invested the party by inventing a nice little unaccountable, incredible story that Ludovic Sutcliffe was privately married to Miss Lucy Hyndford, and only waited the death or repentance of some hostile mother, or vaguely influential friend, to proclaim the union. A private mar riage was in the artists' line, and their pinchbeck halo would not have been complete without a suspicion of its heart-throbbings and dangers. The theory hardly agreed with Ludovic's slenderly veiled impatience of Miss Hynd ford's vocal ornaments and flourishes when they sang together in duets, or his occasional sulky jealousy of her encores. But having had the genius to create a fiction, the St. Boville's world did not dream of stooping to the drudgery of making the fiction accord with the proba bilities."], [115, "103 THE TWO GROUPS. At another season, Gregory Wainwright might have been tempted to feel nettled at the assumption of dignity, and, at the same time, the \" Hail fellow, well met \" of the comic singer ; but coming as it did, it pleased and amused him. He nodded shortly but cordially in reply to the introduction, and said brusquely, but in a friendly fashion, \" We are obliged to you for your good intentions. We'll do the best we can for you. What do you want from us?\" The company of singers wanted to be taken together, as a memorial of their St. Boville's engagement, and sepa rately, for their individual delectation and profit. They were very punctilious in the relative prominence of their position, in the group, and very anxious (though Miss Lucy Hyndford began by speaking slightingly of her care for how she should come out of the trying \u2014 sometimes treach erous \u2014 ordeal) with regard to each showing his or her traditional attitude and expression, as well as on other points. \" You may put me as you hke ; you need not trouble about how I look. Looks are the least of my concern. Ah, I wish I were so well off as to be able to mind about my mouth and eyes, and have good kind friends to mind about them for my sake,\" prefaced Miss Lucy Hyndford, dulcetly, with one of her stage glances at Ludovic Sutcliffe. It was done for stage practice \u2014 at least it did not afford any but the most tottering foundation for the cock and bull private marriage which St. Boville's had celebrated, to its great satisfaction, either at Gretna or Lamberton, though from both parties being Scotch by birth, there was really no necessity even for the localities, only the localities helped to round off the tale. But very soon Miss Hynd ford forgot her declaration of indifference, and was as anxious on various questions, as frank in stipulating for their observance, as Miss Clara Mortimer was. \" I must have my arm seen. Everybody acknowledges that I have a good arm ; it comes out in all my parts ; it is one of my advantages for recitative,\" urged Miss Lucy Hyndford, exposing, and flourishing gently, a somewhat skinny but lithe and pliant arm. \" I should just like to betray a bit of ankle, Miss What's your-name,\" enjoined Miss Clara Mortimer, familiarly \u2014 not objecting to be taken by a woman, but not giving her hint"], [116, "104 A TIGER LILT; A GOLDEN ROD. sotto voce \u2014 as she looked down complacently at a neat ankle for her stout figure. \" No more than a little bit, you know \u2014 perfectly decorous, as well as decent \u2014 merely to remind people that I go on in pages' and youths' parts.\" \"Had not I better tip you a stave of one of my crack songs just before the thing goes off?\" proposed Ludovic Sutcliffe, in perfect sincerity, seeking to make assurance doubly sure, and speaking of the photographic process as if it were a blunderbuss. \" It is of consequence that I should be taken in the act. I believe I can establish my forte in a considerable variety of songs \u2014 sea, hunting, patriotic, devil-may-care, besides comic ; but I am told that my tout ensemble \u2014 unless when I am laying myself out to make fun and bring down roars of laughter \u2014 is more military than anything else.\" They were all in deep earnest, and all profoundly con- vinced of a reward of renown in addition to their wages ; and all the three had so much of the genuine artist in them that they were capable of sinking their personalities in their careers. They were particular about the work done for them, especially as it respected the idiosyncrasies which they had dwelt upon ; but when it was executed, Ludovic Sutcliffe pulled out the common purse and paid like a prince for a gross of the prints, without cheapening a copy, or asking back discount for a set. \" They are innocents,\" Gregory pronounced in strong commendation, as soon as they had departed, \"and more original than I had supposed.

TOUCH AND GO. Among the perpetually recurring racier interludes in the ordinary St. Boville's life, were the continual arrivals and departures \u2014 generally unexpected, where everybody knew every other body by sight, but only detached cliques knew their members to speak .to."], [117, "TOUCH AND GO. 105 \" Two insides \u2014 an old gentleman in a clerical choker and an advanced young lady in spectacles, father and daughter probably \u2014 were dropped by the Bunch of Grapes omnibus at the lodging to let in Fern Row ; and three outsides \u2014 a solemn old man-servant and two mere boys in Glengarries, with loads of cricket-bats and fishing-rods, from a private school, swung down from the great omnibus at the large new house with the tufts of stiff yews, where the fat lady and so many children on donkeys and in perambulators are already.\" These and similar arrivals' -were sure to be announced by the observant member of a family at a breakfast table ; and the notice was generally followed up at dinner by the sobering balance of additionas information \u2014 \" There is a complete clearance of the family at Clematis Villa to-day. We have seen the last of the long man with the crushed wide-awake, and the short woman who jingled her keys in her carriage-bag. They have all gone \u2014 nursery governess and her charge, saucy maids in white aprons, towsy dog with the bead-worked collar \u2014 in both the omni buses, groaning under four tall black leather travelling trunks, two old hair trunks, five square boxes with linen covers, three hampers, a few tin cases, and two band-boxes tied in pocket-handkerchiefs.\" Rarely a day passed in the height of the season without an example of the exceeding transitoriness and brevity of human life at a watering-place. Just so the Wainwrights were roused by getting a glimpse of the final flight of the widow Somer, in one of the omnibuses for the train, laden with her goods. She was evidently keeping up her exemption from the restraints and obligations of society to the last, by screaming to her amphibious boys, who were choosing to flounder in the mud, and hold on by the bar behind, in company with the grinning, manly, ragged St. Boville's gamins, in place of riding on the knifeboard, like little masters, and by holding the impatient, indignant omnibus freight imprisoned behind her, while she filled up the doorway, remaining planted on the steps, wrangling fiercely with the conductor for an odd fourpenny. But she was unattended by her captive man ; from whatever cause, he was left out from her travelling train. Lauderdale Wainwright had set out on a solitary"], [118, "106 A TIGER LILT; A GOLDEN ROD. exploring expedition to Heathery Haugh, to try whether she could not find a few untried views in the recesses of the glen. It was a hot, brooding August afternoon ; there was a thin mist-veil paling the dim azure of the sky with its western bank of gold, even over these high uplands and fresh moors. Lauderdale walked leisurely up the hollow, rough bridle road through pastures and patches of plantation to her destination. The path was not much frequented, though it was open to a host of idlers. Heathery Haugh, with its bare pastoral glen, did not take the popular fancy like the falls of the Roan and the woods of Oakburn, so Lauder dale was easily arrested as well as a little surprised by foot steps pattering after her, and an agitated, exhausted voice calling, \" Miss Wainwright ! Oh ! please, pray, Miss Wainwright, stop.\" To Lauderdale's bewilderment, her pursuer was Miss Lucy Hyndford, with her picturesque red and black shawl pulled awry, entangled and torn iu the fringes by her forcing her way through blackthorn and bramble bushes, and her hat flapping backwards instead of forwards, more like a mushroom than it had ever looked before. \" For pity's sake, Miss Wainwright, turn aside and keep your eye on a poor man, until I run back to St. Boville's, and send up Ludovic Sutcliffe, or any other person I can find. I know it is no business of ours, but a life to be lost, a life at stake, think of that ! \" panted the singer, not very coherently, but very humanely. \"It is the gentleman who went about with the rich young widow. They had an explanation, and she dismissed him last night. I heard it from our washerwoman. But I must not detain you if you are to save him. I met him a moment ago \u2014 as I was gathering blaeberries, which I used to find when I was a child \u2014 away like the wind, in such oppressive weather, to the Stoney Bog, with a gun in his hand, where there is not a living thing to shoot except himself. I rose up and cleared my throat (my heart had leapt into it, I assure you, Miss Wainwright), and he turned his head and looked me blankly in the face ; I am sure he did not see me. I never was in such a situation out of a song, and there it is all love and madness ; and I am sure there is little love here, however much madness there may be. But I know how"], [119, "TOUCH AND GO. 107 low Ludovic Sutcliffe looks when he does not get an engagement : men take nothing to heart now-a-days but being in fixes, and blown, and gone up the spout, as they call it. Dear, dear ! I am gossiping as badly as Clara. Do look after the wretched fellow, ' by all the world forsaken.' They say he has never paid his lodgings, and his landlord has held off, thinking the marriage would be declared, and the widow would clear scores ; but instead she has broken with him, and gone off, and his blood will be at her door. But I suppose she don't mind ; some women never mind. If you will go after him, Miss Wainwright, I will send his landlord or somebody. I should stay myself, but it is Saturday, and I have not too much time. If I ran home I should get hoarse, and put out Ludovic Sutcliffe, who always insists that business is business, and should be attended to first, honour bright, whatever happens.\" \" Certainly,\" Lauderdale promptly endorsed the senti ment; \"but,\" she added, in her cool matter-of-fact tones, though she had turned and was walking in the direction indicated by Miss Lucy Hyndford, \" I think you must be nervous, and exaggerating an accidental coincidence. And I don't know what good I can do ; I have never acted as a policeman.\" \"Oh! no, no! do not say so, Miss Wainwright,\" in sisted Miss Lucy Hyndford, administering a sweeping negative to Lauderdale's half- ironical objections. \"Don't bring the man's blood to our doors. We have not got brazen faces, and hearts of stone. However could she do it, sealing a man's doom and sending him to despair, with a woman's heart in her ? How I wish she had not got her abominable noisy boys into the concert-room at half-price on my benefit night ! Oh, yonder he is,\" as they came in sight of a pedestrian \u2014 a man with a stick or gun on his arm \u2014 before them ; \" the rejected suitor, that is a more correct name for him than the slighted swain, though it is not so touching ; but it may be quite as distressing in certain circumstances. He will not do any harm to him self with you looking on ; men have always so much respect for their neighbours' feelings. You have only to let him see you, and keep him in sight ; you will easily overtake him, for he has slackened his speed already. He could never continue at the pace at which he was going"], [120, "108 A TIGER LILT; A GOLDEN EOD. when he passed me, as he is used up. And I observe yon are a good walker. Good-bye, for the present, my dear Miss Wainwright. Thank you, thank you very much in deed, for not compelling me to feel consenting to a man's death, or else disappointing the public by failing to appear in my part in the concert, without the excuse of illness, and so risking the cancelling of my engagement, which would be fatal to me as a business woman, if not as an artiste, otherwise I should not have failed you ; I should have stood by you in this dreadfully interesting, distracting contretemps. But I am sure you understand it all, and I shall make all the haste I can, and relieve you as soon as possible.\" Miss Lucy Hyndford had as great a flow, once it was elicited, of half-educated, sentimental, silly, kind hearted, womanly words as Miss Clara Mortimer of bound ing statements. When the prattle had died away with the retreating steps of the artiste, Lauderdale began to regard her own dilemma, half comically, half irefully, somewhat as a man might have done. \" A fine commission ! The fortune-hunt ing scapegrace has most probably come out to shoot pigeons and taken the wrong road. He may shoot me if I dog him; but I need not pretend to nerves. Penniless debtor, disre putable bankrupt, coward fearing to face his claims, rather liking the sensation of frightening ignorant, simple, soft hearted people out of their wits with his antics, and the apprehension that he will have recourse to the last weak, unworthy subterfuge of blowing his brains out \u2014 if it has come to that, what use or good will there be in preserving him ? \" The thread of Lauderdale's hasty reflections was broken short by the action of the man preceding her by a few yards. All at once he sank down in the close, stiff under growth of blaeberries among which Miss Lucy Hyndford had been ruralizing, and raised his hand with the weapon which he held to his head. Had he aimed steadily, had he fired without hesitation, the strength of Latiderdale's nerves would have been tried by a dead or dying man, the image of Captain Featherstone, biting the dust, with a horrible flood staining his well-fitting grey morning suit and delicate linen, while he had not so many shillings in his pocket \u2014 and those forfeited \u2014 as to buy him a pauper's coffin."], [121, "109 TOUCH AND GO. But this man had never aimed steadily or acted without hesitation in his life, so that at a bound the firm, resolute woman was at his side arresting his intention, forcibly turning aside his arm, and dragging it down till the muzzle of the gun was pointed to the ground, which receives all injuries and keeps all secrets without retaliation and with out betrayal. Lauderdale had not time to think of the policy of feign ing not to apprehend his purpose, if such policy had been possible. \"What were you going to do, sir? How could you be guilty of so great a sin and shame ? \" she demanded sharply. She had mastered him for the moment, and he remained still, and only turned and stared at her in a stupefied way, as he had stared at Miss Hyndford. \" And what have you to do with it ? \" he muttered at last, in counter question. \"I have nothing else left me to do.\" \" Is the world not wide enough to hold you ? Is there nothing else left you to do, save to come out and commit murder \u2014 spot the bonnie blooming heather with the hideous stain of your blood ? \" With that the smothered-down, grown-over woman of Lauderdale broke forth unexpectedly and got the better of her. She sat down, wrung her hands, and sobbed hard \u2014 as the bravest woman will sob in the grisly face of an execution, or at the sudden revelation of a shocking accident, for the wrong and the suffering of others. Lauderdale could not have done a better thing to recall and get the better of the reprobate. He had been a man who might have caused angels to weep for his irretrievable ruin, but he had been always ludicrously overcome by the tears of women and children, any time he had encountered them in his life. He was a poor, despicable weakling of a fallen gentleman. \" Don't cry, I beg, I implore you, don't cry ; I shan't harm you.\" She laughed a little hysterical laugh at the absurdity of the assurance, which frightened him still more ; and the man who had been on his knees to plunge darkly into eternity, flung down his gun, and remained kneeling, labouring to soothe the excited humour of a homely, elderly woman, who was a stranger to him. \" I shan't harm myself, then, before you, to hurt your"], [122, "110 A TIGER LILT; A GOLDEN ROD. feelings ; never think it. Do come round and compose yourself, I beseech you, like a good soul. Let me see you home, I think I know the way ; you are the photographic artist's sister. I am so sorry for having frightened you in this lonely place. Upon my honour I had no idea that there was anybody, especially any woman, behind me.\" \"Why should you do it at all? \" asked Lauderdale, with asperity, turning upon him, and charging at him with all her might, her short-sighted eyes blazing at him under their frowning brows. \" To kill yourself is an abominable crime against your fellow-creatures as well as against God. Every man, woman, and child has a human right, not only to interfere and prevent the wicked deed, but to challenge and upbraid you for its cruel licentiousness.\" \" I assure you I did not see it in that light,\" protested Mr. Hopkins, by comparison meek and crestfallen, lifting his hat to give himself air and a moment's breathing space, as he found himself driven to the wall, beaten and badgered by another woman. \" I really thought I had nothing else to do. I can tell you, what with the heat of the weather, the darkness before me, and what I remembered of any ghostly counsel, or any friend who was ever kind to me \u2014 whom I ever heeded or credited, it was not very pleasant work.\" \" Nothing else to do but to slay yourself, really ! \" re peated Lauderdale with imperious irony. \" Slaying is one thing, and starving another,\" explained Mr. Hopkins, rising to his feet, and kicking away the gun, but speaking with growing sullenness. \" And, by Jove, starving is not the worst ; no, nor begging, nor stealing, neither ; but to be worked like a hack, and treated like a dog, taunted and cast off after all ; \" his wan face grew cadaverous, and he quivered and ground his teeth with mingled rage and desperation. \" Why should you starve or lead a dog's lot ? you are a man, capable, able-bodied, even highly educated as men count; in your prime\u2014 as to years.\" She added the three last words in a lower key, for she was forced to own that the hand which had thrown down the gun and was raising the hat again, shook like an aspen, and the whole man's figure was scorched, blasted, cowering, as if sin in the form of a simoom had passed over it, and withered it to"], [123, "TOUCH AND GO. 111 the root. She was forced to see it and own it, while she hated the spectacle. It was little to say her flesh crept at it: it all but set her off again, strong, wise, virtuous woman, fellow-artist of Gregory Wainwright, crying bit terly in another paroxysm of pain and indignation. \" How much better off are you than I who am a woman, \u2014 not young, or beautiful, or a genius, or rich \u2014 anything but any of these ; with Gregory, to be sure, but who may marry and leave me any day ; yet I do not fret, or rise up in defiance of my Maker, but manage to keep myself in bread and water and something more, and to use and enjoy hfe.\" \" It is little a woman knows of it. I suppose you have not got a mill-stone of debt, which has been accumulating steadily, the only steady thing about you since you were a confoundedly neglected, misguided, witless lad, and is hanging round your neck, ready to drown you any moment \u2014 well, it does not signify when.\" He said it vapouringly and sneeringly. And there was the free, peaceful moor around them. The brooding blessing of the fruitful heat was ripening the very heather bells and the wild berries. The young grouse, which Miss Lucy Hyndford had not taken into consideration when she said that there was no living thing there for him to kill save himself \u2014 with the 12th of August still in the future, and the warrant for their killing not gone out \u2014 were forgetting each alien presence, and rising, with a cheery crow and clap of rapid wings, from their close covert. \" I have not a penny of debt save such as I can pay,\" answered the honest woman severely ; \" but if I had, in place of seeking to die and escape it, 1 should guard every channel of life jealously, till I could go away, make money, fulfil my obligations, and owe no man anything but to love one another.\" He stared at her, shrugging his bowed shoulders, and grimacing with his haggard face, before he replied : \" I believe some women are of a poetic temperament, though I have not come across many of them ; and it may be easy to dream of paying debt, but I could no more make money than I could fly. I wish I could do either the one or the other. It would be extremely convenient, when a man is on the eve of being put out of his lodging, where there are no cabs to drive about and sleep in, according to the"], [124, "112 A TIGER LILT; A GOLDEN ROD. great actor's dodge. To be frank with you, since we have come so oddly to close quarters, and it does not matter who knows now that the whole affair is so nearly done with, I never was any good. I think I might not have gone so fast and certainly to the bad, or come to such out-and-out grief, if I had not been cumbered with the education you mentioned, and if my thews and sinews had got a chance among the mob of working men, if I had been a soldier or a sailor ; not that I am much of a man, and I grant you it is hard to believe, without the proof. Standing to be shot may even be more difficult than draw ing the trigger for one's own business, and the enemy may be more energetic and irresistible than Miss \u2014 Miss, the photographic artist's sister. Never mind that. I was bred to the bar, without any taste or capacity for the law, or for anything else that I can think of, unless, by all the world, for your line of photography, in which I once came it strong for a little while, merely for my own amusement ; of course, anything else was inadmissible. I never got a brief save one or two, and never did the name of any one credit when I got so much. My father \u2014 I am not going to speak ill of the old gentleman at this time of the day ; but, poor old fellow, he first dipped me in his own mess, and then, as my mother was dead and gone, gave me up, disgusted at the consequences of his work. My sister Jane \u2014 poor, dear Janey \u2014 the only human being who was not too wise and nice to care for me for my own sake, who had set her heart on getting me on my feet and pulling me through, died \u2014 I am thankful for it \u2014 before I had done her simple business, and broken her fond, foolish heart; and a she-devil polished me off.\" All at once he passed from the rambling, reckless, unrighteous, soft-hearted, dawdling way in which he was confessing himself to Lauderdale for her enlightenment, into the white heat of concentrated wrath and malice. \" I beg your pardon for talking so of a woman to a lady ; but she was not a woman \u2014 she was a hyena, a wolf. What she made a poor lost devil do for her and her inso lent cubs of children ! What she made me suffer to leave me to a debtors' jail, a whitewashing which is no white washing, but a tar and feathering in a bankruptcy court, to the lowest shabbiness, want, vice, an outcast's death"], [125, "113 TOUCH AND GO. after all.\" He clenched his hands as he thought of her. \" See,\" he cried huskily, \" I don't care though you know, she induced me to take lodgings here on her account, and she has left me \u2014 and she knows it, but she does not mind so long as the law does not make her answerable \u2014 without a pound to pay for them. My landlord has his eye on my traps, and is keeping watch at the railway station ; but he may spare himself the trouble, I have not the shillings to pay for a third-class ticket to London or Edinburgh, and if I attempted to walk the distance, I should drop down at the end of the first ten miles, for my landlady has grown saucy, and did not prepare a breakfast for me which I could eat to-day, though she is aware I have gone with out dinner once or twice within the last week. If you please \u2014 you, madam, the photographic artist's sister,\" he pleaded half wildly, \" I had rather make short work of it among the shy game creatures here, with the gun I've borrowed, than drag myself into the shelter of a hedge and die by inches, snapped at by carters' dogs, and punched and pulled about by the carters themselves on a public road. As to your having any dependence on the penny post, and trust in appeals to friends, dismiss the notion at once. I have tired out all the friends I ever had, an age ago. I have no near relations to be scandalized by the melodramatic mode of exit from the world which I take the liberty to prefer. My death in any way will be the gladdest news of me which my friends have heard for a long time ; and as for her, I shall haunt and torment her if I can.\" Lauderdale had been looking and listening with her whole original sagacious face and earnest heart. She con tinued to gaze at him, with her eyes getting larger and larger, and her mouth more spasmodically contracted and tremulous, in spite of herself. \"No, you shall not,\" she for bade him, positively; \"you shall not kill yourself, when there was One killed for you eighteen hundred years ago. Is He no more than a dead man to you ? I tell you that you are not your own, to kill yourself, or another. Do you not believe that, though you may have slept over the words in many a matter-of-course, drowsy, decent, infidel church attendance ? \" \"Now you are coming it strong again,\" protested Mr. Hopkins. i"], [126, "114 A TIGER LILT; A GOLDEN ROD. Even as he spoke, Lauderdale gave a writhe and start of sudden pain. \" I think I have hurt myself against a stone,\" she said confusedly in explanation, stooping and putting her hand to her foot. He thrust her hand back, pulled her up, dragged her aside and caught up his gun. \"You are bitten by an adder,\" he cried; \"I got a glimpse of its snake's head. There it is,\" as a glistening coil rustled and slid with marvellous rapidity through the heather at a few paces' distance. \" I shall despatch it in a moment, but don't stir from that spot till I look for its fellow ; adders always hunt in couples.\" He destroyed the first gruesome reptile with a blow, and detected and killed the other after a few minutes' search, while Lauderdale stood smarting with pain, and shivering, in spite of her defiance of nerves, at the unexpected contact with the shiny coat and trail, the prismatic hues, and the subtlety of motion of the serpent breed. Mr. Hopkins was not effeminate in the matter of destruction, it seemed ; and as if it were the peculiar line of vagabonds, in the dearth of all other tastes and interests, he had developed a sporting element. It was part of a gentleman's education, to be sure, like a scientific know ledge of cookery and skill in billiards. \" Does it hurt much ? \" asked the scamp, kindly. \" We must make haste and get down before the swelling begins and stiffens the limb. It will be no more than a trifle after all, I assure you ; you know adders' bites are only sharp flea-bites compared with the serpents' bites of tropical countries, but it may pain you and incapacitate you from walking in the mean time. Do me the favour to take my arm, till we come in sight of St. Boville's, at least. Fancy I am your brother for a few minutes, or, though it is a preposterous supposition, that I am old enough or you are old enough for us to be father and daughter, or mother and son. Why is it that I am always thinking of you in a family light, madam, I wonder, unless there is a virtue in necessity ? \" He actually forgot what he had come to Heathery Haugh to do \u2014 to take that leap into a gulf from which no man has come up to tell what ground he has found \u2014 to dare to face his Judge at the great assize with all his sins unrecalled,"], [127, "115 TOUCH AND GO. unrepented of, unatoned for; if faith in an awful Judge and great assize survived in his hazy, shaken mind, or if his desperate purpose lingered in his facile memory, it was but as the murky and lurid background of a hideous dream. He conducted her carefully and gently, far more gently than Gregory would have done. If Gregory had not been alarmed for his sister's safety \u2014 and he was very far from being easily alarmed \u2014 he would have been tempted either to crow over her in his superior hardihood, or to twit her with her imagined terrors. But this man was solicitous to soothe her, even to divert her mind from her accident. With this end he talked fluently on various subjects. \" And what do you think of negatives on talc ? I used to have a hand in them,\" he said, with a brightening up which was almost more piteous than anything that had gone before ; it seemed to bear reference to such a far-off time, when life had had hope and heart in it, Near to the town the couple encountered Mr. Hopkins's wary, pursy landlord panting out the Heathery Haugh road. He paused when he saw them, wiped his face, and drew a sigh of relief. He was a man with a constant eye to the main chance, but he had not calculated on having anything to do with so staggering a subject as death. He looked hard at the walkers, walked by them without speak ing, then turned and followed them at a respectful distance. Close to St. Boville's, Lauderdale did not dismiss her companion. She said a little awkwardly, like one unac customed to give invitations, \"Mr. Hopkins, would you mind coming in and seeing my brother, and telling me what to do with my foot ? I do not care to have much to do with doctors, particularly of the watering-place type. If you will give me any simple directions, I shall follow them.\" Mr. Hopkins raised his hat, as he had not found time to do lately (but Richard was himself again), his eyebrows also, at being expected to act the quack to a hard-favoured, eccentric, aging artist, but his good nature, which had served him in bad stead many a day, seemed to awaken to remorse for its evil deeds, and served him in good stead now."], [128, "116 A TIGER LILT; A GOLDEN ROD. CHAPTER III. REDEEMED WITH A PRICE. Lauderdale told Gregory faithfully every particular, sit ting on the single lobby chair in one of the bare, echoing, chill-even-in-summer-time lobbies of old St. Boville's House, while Mr. Hopkins reclined, much at his ease \u2014 in one sense, if not in another \u2014 on one of the hard couches in the great drawing-room. \" What might have been expected,\" commented Gregory, bending his brows and drawing together his short-sighted eyes till his screwed-up chrome-yellow face was uncom monly like the figure-head of a gurgoyle. \" These weak sinners are always the fools to go at last, and make a sounding report by letting out the little life that has ever been in them in a splutter of fire and fury. You ain't much hurt, Laud ? \" \" No, Greg ; but couldn't you speak to his landlord not to molest him for a few days ? Resources might cast up for a human being, don't you think ? Couldn't you allow him to come here, and let him see some of the tricks of the trade, which are not secret works, since he has not a trade of his own that he can put his hand to ? You remember he showed some notion of chemicals, and grouping, when he came with the woman and her children ; and he spoke to-day as if he had been familiar with the earlier experi ments, and with good models. He may not consent, but since I saved the man's hfe as I did (and you need not try to put it out of my head), you have no idea how queer it feels to let him go out again into the darkness, as he said.\" \" Good heavens, Laud, you are not going to adopt the man, the widow's relict?\" remonstrated Gregory in the liveliest manner. \" All the appropriate stories I ever read took their rise from the opposite starting-point. A man saves a woman from a foaming torrent, a crackling fire, or a roaring bull, and she is grateful to him, and adores him for ever afterwards, naturally. But I should not wonder though there is something to be said on the contrary side of the question, particularly where such odd fish as women are concerned. I trust the old superstition against res-"], [129, "117 REDEEMED WITH A PRICE. cuing drowning men was a superstition, that's all ; and Coleridge's Ghristabel a poetical figment. For mercy's sake, Laud, be reasonable ; pause, and think what an in cumbrance even a reformed rake would be on our hands, and how we might be raising up a stick to break our own heads. There are secret lights and shades even in the fair, ingenuous face of my mistress art \u2014 God bless her \u2014 and the knave might steal them, first, and our sitters afterwards.\" But, in the end, the Wainwrights, poor artists as they were, played the rare part of good Samaritans to Mr. Hopkins ; and some people may think it was a special interposition of Providence on their behalf that they did not warm a serpent in their bosoms ; that the only serpents in the business were the adders slain by the slim, frail Hercules at Heathery Haugh. The Wainwrights were sufficiently known, and sufficiently esteemed at St. Boville's, to be able to free Mr. Hopkins temporarily and partially from his extremity of difficulties ; to countenance him ; to offer him another chance, and a way of doing. And it was hard enough lines for the poor gentleman, who was as ill to break of his superciliousness, lounging, swaggering \u2014 by way of variety \u2014 his utter thriftlessness, his miserable habit of dissipation, as any rogue and criminal of his darker frauds and crimes. To frequent the Wainwrights' establishment at old St. Boville's, and behave himself with some regard to steadiness, attention, activity ; to hear and reply to sentiments which, couched in whatever language of chaffing and mockery, were vigorous, dauntless, high-hearted, generous, and pure senti ments as were ever breathed ; to learn to assist the artists in their work, and to work for himself ; \u2014 well, it was a light yoke compared to the gyves of the widow's vulgar insolence and grinding tyranny ; it was wholesome air to the atmosphere of brutal self-indulgence and ignorant, un reasonable contempt for her neighbour in which she Hved. But it was like breathing the air of a higher latitude, Hke climbing the steep ascent to that latitude. There was a constant strain both of body and mind on the poor man, under which he half cracked his jaws with yawning ; shrank from staining his fingers, and looked ruefully at the stains when they were incurred ; ached all over his relaxed, spent body \u2014 to his little finger, on anything like"], [130, "118 A TIGER LILT; A GOLDEN ROD. continued exertion ; and felt dismally weary and hopeless of ever being worthy, industrious, enterprising, distin guished, like that other poor man, who could not contem plate the possibility of being pious a whole day. The worst came last, that the Wainwrights, though they were very good to him, could not sympathize with his trials. Still Fred Hopkins held on, creeping like a whining schoolboy to the glass house, sitting down and dumbly nursing his elbow, when he struck it and caused it to tingle in his man\u0153uvres; seldom coming near to animation and alacrity, save when he could fling himself away from focuses and shadows, and indulge in his beloved smoke \u2014 withal the most patient, harmless, sweet-mannered of half reformed prodigals. And the Wainwrights did not let him go, though Gregory revived the sensational myth of the glass house with all its contents being blown into mid air one day by Hopkins's carelessness and recklessness, and whistled loudly at some of Mr. Hopkins's performances, over which Lauderdale frowned. To turn back and begin again far on in life, is a terrible humiliation and drudgery of recantation and renewal \u2014 a desperate, almost childishly mad undertaking. But Gregory and Lauderdale Wainwright encouraged and paid Mr. Hopkins for assisting them to the liberal limit of their means : the first fee he had ever worked for, which the wretched, egotistical fellow's false pride and sentiment was ashamed, not elated, to take. Some stray, long-suffering friends turned up when they heard that Mr. Hopkins was making a faint attempt at an honest shift, and freed him from his more pressing claims, so that he had not been so easy in his circumstances, or so fresh for the campaign of life, since he came to man's estate. Had it not been for a heavy bill coming due with no provision to meet it, Fred Hopkins would have been too comfortable and independent; he would not have known himself. Not that he troubled himself about that bill, or any other bill, with its day of doom, its days of grace, its inexorable crasliing fall on him and his faintly dawning prospects of better days and better things. He had been so long accustomed to bills in their ostentatious, often audacious promises and threats, sneaking renewals, and gradual havoc in paying themselves over and over again,"], [131, "REDEEMED WITH A PRICE. 119 before they are returned or protested, that a vulgarly facetious man might have said he had been brought up among people of a decidedly bilious temperament, fie had become a fatalist where bills were concerned ; he was a fatahst with regard to most events, as wasters, wanters, and ruined men of every stamp are wont to be. Lauderdale Wainwright, to whom, in her growing cha racter of confidant, Fred Hopkins had mentioned his bill, was much more taken up about its approach than its signer. Over and over again she anticipated the day it represented, and counted what sum would satisfy its demand. She had a delicacy in consulting with Gregory on the subject, because it was discussing another man's private affairs, and though Mr. Hopkins might have given her liberty, Gregory himself was too manly to like it ; and he had jeers and technicaHties, and overwhelming state ments of the infectious nature of debt, and of the danger of starting leaks which could not be stopped, by so much as touching liabilities. There was no use in seeking to arouse Mr. Hopkins's anxiety on a subject which might have been supposed supremely interesting to him. To the Bohemian the evil day is always far off, till its doom descends, and the Bohemian is far less honest and less capable of reflection on the im portant question of bills than he is likely to be on that of entering a bank as clerk at nine hours a day and a small fixed salary, or of converting the Fijji islanders. Mr. Hopkins was a great way from being cured to the extent of desisting from banishing the most distant idea of a bill's becoming due till he could get somebody to sign or dis count another for him. There was a curious fascination for Lauderdale Wain wright in Fred Hopkins, and what had been his egregious, incorrigible folly, all the more egregious and incorrigible as folly, that it was not the vicious depravity, the deliberate treachery, the vindictiveness, the revenge of some men. The charm did not He in the faded good looks \u2014 not utterly rubbed off \u2014 and the lingering polish which had caught the widow. Lauderdale cared for none of these things. A man might be a very Adonis, and she would only notice the fact as furnishing a good specimen of a head ; she was homely and rustic herself, had hardly ever minded it, and"], [132, "120 A TIGER LILT; A GOLDEN ROD. had long ceased to mind it. Neither was it that she was for a moment deceived in Fred Hopkins, or trusted him beyond the breadth of a straw, or mistook her relation to him. But she was fascinated by the protection which she afforded him, the dependence he had upon her. Some one has written that all good women may not be destined or fitted for wives, but that all may be mothers \u2014 mothers in the sense of cherishing, ministering to, and caring for heedless children of all ages. To some women \u2014 and these the best \u2014 there is a greater necessity to pro tect than to be protected ; they want sons and daughters more than husbands. Lauderdale had missed hers tiU\"now. The hard obligation of earning a livelihood had occupied her ; and her brother Gregory, with his wise saws, his stoical powers, his gipsy training, was a thoroughly inde pendent person. \" There is only one way in which I can help him,\" said Lauderdale to herself, taking upon her the bill which has been the end of many a poor woman \u2014 \" I cannot make a run over with Greg to see the cathedrals, town-halls, and gateways of Belgium as we promised ourselves. But if I work up the series of views which the old St. Boville man ordered, and Gregory surrendered to me, and get them finished in time, I may lend Mr. Hopkins what will wipe off enough of this score to give him another chance of final release and new adventure, if he is ever to be able to take it.\" Lauderdale made good her words by working steadfastly, with feverish intentness and engrossment, on serried ridges of hills, table-lands of moors, billowy seas of corn, sur rounded by hanging \" shaws,\" where the rusting of the bracken, and the reddening of wild cherry, oak, and beech, showed the finger-marks of autumn. Lauderdale worked irrespective of early hoarfrost, of shower and blast ; she disdained the bad cold and hard cough which she caught in the process, and continued to go out to compete, as she said, with the washerwomen, still standing with half -frozen feet, washing Parisian fashion in the Roan. \"Call a halt, Laud,\" Gregory objected \u2014 \"you must digest your subjects. You will miss the finest touches by galloping over the course at this rate.\" \"You make us feel so dead boat, Miss Wainwri\"-ht,\""], [133, "121 REDEEMED WITH A PRICE. suggested Fred Hopkins, pathetically, lifting his hat, in despair, clean off his elegantly-formed, light head. \"You take away our breath by going ahead like a Yankee. Have some respect for our nerves.\" But Lauderdale had no respect for their nerves, or her own health, or any other right reason. Like most of us when we set our hearts on a thing, her eagerness fed on itself, and grew and gathered unnatural spasmodic strength and power as she approached her goal. Her single idea mastered her, tyrannized over her, broke her with its violence. And Fred Hopkins, who had not the remotest suspicion of her object, who was more easily blinded than a child or a dog, began to complain of her to himself as a fearfully tiresome, hobby-riding, trampling onward, quaintly ugly amazon ; weU intentioned, certainly, oh ! very weU in tentioned ; but getting more and more of an intolerable bore every day. At last Lauderdale put up her packet of views, wonder fully well done, as if something of the fire and the devo tion of their motive had entered into them, sent them off to their destination, gave a long sigh of relief, and let her arms faU by her side in utter weariness. The next day she kept the house, submitting to take a holiday, and hung over the fire, the lighting and the piling up of which Mr. Hopkins had presided over as a protection against the autumn cold, in damp, draughty old St. Boville's House. Two days afterwards she took to bed. Her cough was so bad and shook her so, that it pained and sickened her when she moved about ; not that she would hear of calling in a doctor. She was quite able to be eager about post-time \u2014 \u25a0 whether it had brought some remittance for her, and was interested in ascertaining how the others were getting on in the glass house without her, and in enjoining Gregory to bear with Mr. Hopkins's infirmities, and to initiate him as far as possible into the sleight-of-hand of photography \u2014 so that Gregory thought that there was not much the matter with her, and assured his easy fellow workman that such was the case when he inquired for his friend. The St. BoviUe's post was one of its eccentricities. It came in betimes in the evening; but though the letters were sorted then, they were not delivered, for the con-"], [134, "122 A TIGER LILT; A GOLDEN ROD. venience of the letter carrier, till daylight and morning sunshine. People who would not have borne an hour s unnecessary delay without an outcry and a fight for it at home, submitted meekly to twelve hours' delay from home at St. Boville's. Mr. Hopkins, hearing something of Lauderdale's excitement about the post, offered, with his obliging temper \u2014 which was part of the man's graciously, dangerously pliant nature \u2014 to go out of the way to his lodging, call for the St. Boville's House letters, and bring them back with him, before he went into quarters for the night. \" As little as he can do,\" argued Gregory to himself, cheerfully ; \" when he is smoking and lounging about in the dusk, for he won't go into his lodgings, and take a book in his hand, so long as he can help it. He had better make himself useful by humouring a sick woman's fancy. She would do more for him any day.\" At once, Lauderdale knocked the proposal on the head. Fred Hopkins heard her do it when he was waiting in the drawings-room, more forlorn than ever, now that there was not even the clever, kind caricature of a woman to welcome a man, while Gregory was speaking of it to his sister, as he made his brief sojourn with her, sitting on the front of her bed. Fred heard Lauderdale say, in the middle of her fits of coughing, \" Greg, I'm very much obliged to you and him, but I'd rather wait. Don't you remember the post-office is next one of the hotels ? It is not right to throw a man into temptation, and it is very hard to pull up full-grown weeds by the roots. He owned to me a week ago that he could never pass such a place, with money in his pocket particularly, without turning in to have one game at billiards, and a couple of glasses of wine. All right : we would not stint a man in his pleasures, but it would not be a dozen of games of billiards or a bottle of wine Fred Hopkins might rise under, for he must drown care. He was late of coming this morning. He could not eat any breakfast with you ; and he said very politely he was afraid he was feeling seedy, and was sorry to have to send out for soda-water. I was lying listening to it all ; so be you sure and thank him, but say he need not trouble, the letters can wait.\" Fred Hopkins went directly home that night and"], [135, "123 REDEEMED WITH A PRICE. covered his face with his hands, and took them away wet, after saying a prayer for his benighted soul, \" God be merci ful to me a sinner. God, what makes that woman care so much for me, who have only been a grievance to her ? \" Lauderdale's letter came at last, and was seized upon by her, though she was as unwell as ever. But all at once she announced that the pain in her chest was gone ; and though she coughed still, the cough no longer distressed her. She got up and wrote a little, notwithstanding that she was unaccountably weak \u2014 certainly, she was not accus tomed to be an invalid \u2014 and then she came and lay con tentedly on the hard drawing-room sofa on which Fred Hopkins used to groan. When Gregory and Mr. Hopkins saw Lauderdale there, they started, looked at each other, aghast with concerned, frightened gravity, while they spoke to her with forced gaiety, and took the first opportunity to snatch a word with each other apart. \"A doctor? \" whispered Hopkins. \" Slap bang,\" consented poor Gregory, unconsciously speaking slang, with parched lips. \" Any of the tribe. If one is not at home, go for another. Fetch a couple if you think fit.\" A doctor came, to Lauderdale's surprise, and a little to her vexation. The busy woman had never had a doctor to attend her in her life, and she was conscious of looking very grotesque in her nightcap; but she was so weary and sleepy she could not feel so indignant as she ought to have felt. The doctor found the case too serious to be one of triumph in the dignity of physics being acknowledged at last, though he persisted in regarding it as an instance of retribution. It was a case of inflammation in the lungs, aggravated, neglected, and allowed to run on to its last hopeless stage. Nothing could be done for Miss Wainwright, strong woman as she had been till a fortnight ago ; no power on earth, not all the riches of all its kingdoms, could save her, or pay the forfeit. She might suffer no more, except from oppression of breathing ; but twelve hours would probably end the struggle \u2014 no more time than she had waited for the post's bringing the golden fruit of the toil in which she had sacrificed her life."], [136, "124 A TIGER LILT; A GOLDEN ROD. No one had told her. She had gone back to bed, and slept in ignorance, since the doctor's visit. She was startled when she awoke and saw Gregory standing beside her, idle, and looking old and grim, and Fred Hopkins through a half-open door, idle too, looking young with a wasted youths ulness, and sad with the infinite sadness of the fabled dryads and fauns of the old myths, those whose half-awakened souls could comprehend and bow before sorrow, but could not compass repentance and resistance to fate. Then when Gregory said to her wistfuUy, \" Laudie \" \u2014 using an old caressing, childish name which he had not applied to her for thirty years \u2014 \"can I do nothing more to make you comfortable ? \" there was no need to tell her. She had dragged herself up that morning with a vision of fresh work before her \u2014 now all work was done, and nothing was left for her but to go home and take her wages. Her work was done : in that she could resign herself, take courage, and even rejoice faintly in the far-off heavenly echo, \" AU is well.\" \" Greg,\" she said, in feeble mockery of what was wont to be their chaffing, and with her plainness pathetic in its last light, \" you wiU miss me, old fellow, and the glass house will look blank for a while without me ; but that will force you to form other and closer ties, better for you in the end. You will miss me, too, Fred Hopkins, but I have helped you, and Greg will do the best he can for you, and you will manage to get yourself on your feet, as you told me your sister tried to get you, lest she and I should not rest in our graves. Kiss me, Greg, and you too, Fred Hopkins ; you have both a better Friend than I, to whom I am going, and to whom I shall say a word for you, if I may. But we cannot speak of these things ; only comfort each other, dears.\" When Lauderdale was gone, it was found that she had left thc draft of a will, written so lately as in the begin ning of her illness, bequeathing the bulk of her little property in artists' tools and impressions to her brother ; but the last sum of money that she had worked for \u2014 a considerable sum for a woman to earn, in return for a large and troublesome commission \u2014 to Frederick Hopkins, to be laid past till the 20th October, which date, with its reference, he would understand."], [137, "REDEEMED WITH A PRICE. 125 Gregory not only paid the proposed legacy readily, but religiously fulfilled the obhgation which Lauderdale had transferred to him ; when pith in backbone seemed to have been restored to Fred Hopkins by the very depth of the sacrifice made for him. The two men did not swear friend ship and dwell together in all time to come, with their antecedents and inclinations as widely removed as the poles. But Gregory recommended Mr. Hopkins to a studio where he could be thoroughly instructed in a photo grapher's art, and obtain scope for his natural talents and taste, and Gregory aided Fred Hopkins with experience, influence, even what little money he could lend, on the first opening for a new artist. Thus it happened that when Mr. Hopkins was a fashion able photographer who piqued the world into showing him favour by the gentleman-like \u2014 not imperious and not fawning, but perfectly easy \u2014 manner in which he solicited its votes, he was in the habit of sending to Gregory Wain wright copies of his finest achievements, and Gregory was in the habit of sending to Mr. Hopkins, in return, ex amples of his rarer walk in the higher field of pure gems of nature \u2014 animated and stdl life \u2014 in antiquity and arch\u00e6 ology. These gifts were a small attempt at the magni ficent, after the fashion of Raffaelle Sanzio and Albrecht Durer, but they were not too small to be a kindly, friendly interchange of compliments of some value. More than that, in Mr. Hopkins's studio, before all his \u00e6sthetical studies, hung the bizarre head of an irregular featured woman, aged with work and care, bearing the legible inscription, \" Lauderdale Wainwright, my dear friend and benefactress.\" When any visitor took it upon him to remark on the preference given to this likeness, Mr. Hopkins always roused himself from his insouciance to say eagerly and earnestly, \" No wonder I put her there ; she was the best woman I ever knew.\" \" Is Mrs. Hopkins not jealous ? \" you say. \" Not at aU. Mrs. Hopkins knows that I should not be here this day had it not been for a disinterested, charitable soul, whose memory she loves and cherishes, and whose name we have given to one of our children. Good and noble Lauderdale Wainwright ! She made a man of me ; and she taught me to reverence womankind.\" \u25a0"], [138, "A SCOTCH ROSE (TWO SALUTATIONS.) \"GOOD MORROW, MT PRETTY MAID.\" Once upon a time, on a summer morning, three regiments of soldiers marched through an old burgh town, known to its inhabitants as emphatically \" the town,\" \u2014 one of those towns, like blue-white oysters hanging from brown and green seaweed, which fringe the coast of the frith, known in its young days as Scotland Water. The town was not dilapidated then. It was the resort of skippers gently born, who did a little in the privateering business, and left their mark in the shape of two-storied, wind-swept, sea washed houses, with back doors and main doors \u2014 a coping above the last, and a square stone above the coping, bear ing an anchor or a coat of arms, or two pairs of initials \u2014 those of husband and wife \u2014 united in stone if disunited in the flesh. The town had its population, but what the soldiers saw of them consisted solely of women, unless children, dogs, hens, and ducks be taken into account. And these were not women in their normal state either, running out, fine or slatternly, rejoicing in the sight of the red coats, bless ing the bonnie faces of the Southern; but lowering women, scowling and scolding, and where they could not scowl and scold, sore-hearted and wet-eyed. When they held up their children, it was not to laugh and crow to the strangers, but to threaten them : \u2014 \" Look at them, bairn ; ken them again ; and if your father saUs, laddie, grow a man and be their deaths.\""], [139, "\" GOOD MORROW, MT PRETTT MAID.\" 127 The old skipper town, hating the Union, and loving its former privdeges in malt and salt and trade with HoUand, was Jacobite to the heart's core, and these were soldiers of Cumberland, whom Englishmen called Bluff Bill, and Scotchmen, the Butcher. The townsmen were away with the Jacobite leaders ; the women were left behind to witness the desolation and degradation of the town \u2014 as the Hanoverian troops crossed the ferry, quartered themselves on their enemies, or marched in pursuit of \" Charlie and his men,\" \u2014 to wait for the news of encounters and engage ments, and to sigh for the return of their men folk. And the echo of the women's sighs soughs still on the bleak Scotch breezes, among the swaying thistles and harebells in snatches of old songs : \u2014 \" Oh ! send Lewie Gordon home.\" \" A' wonld be right again, Gin Jamie were come baek.': A strange, deserted, sad, and sullen world these English gentlemen, yeomen, and grooms passed through in the hostile districts, like crossing Styx, and wandering among the shades of the dead, as the Hessians called the Northern pass \"the mouth of Hell.\" But these were mostly practical men, thinking of the glories of Bath in the season, or the comforts of country-houses, of shot and shoulder-belts, of boots and tops and aching limbs within them, of grudged nights' quarters and \"sweer\" kail and porridge, or, if imaginations were discursive, of hillside ambushes and the slogan of Highland savages. The bitter jibes and muttered curses of the women fell on the soldiers Hke smaU stones on coats of mail ; they were not worth resenting so long as a war of words was all which the viragos ventured to wage. Yet they were strong women these Scotch wenches \u2014 some of them thc terror of the yellow harvest field in their snoods or curches, some of them the violent fishwives of the white sandy shore. Most of them had drunk in Scripture with then- Scotch blood and their mothers' milk, and were well read in the stories of Jael and Sisera, and the mother in Israel who threw down a piece of a millstone on the head of Abimelech, the son of Jerubbaal. The red coats had need to march warily through the steep narrow streets of the town."], [140, "128 A SCOTCH ROSE. A few of the spectators were of higher rank and gentler breeding, but not of opposite faith ; these were at the windows, expressing their wrath by silent, stately scorn. One young woman of this class filled a narrow window with her hoop and her ruffles ; while at the other window of the same taU, grey house, women and children, ladies and servants, clustered and hung by each other Hke frightened sheep or pigeons. But the girl set herself forth alone as a mark for the carbines should, there be skirmish ing in the streets, or should there be volleys of insolent triumph, in voluntary testimony \u2014 knitting her smooth brow and setting her white teeth \u2014 to her hatred of the Whigs. She had thrown the window up and leant on the sill, and there, framed by the window-frame in a setting of diamonds, the small window-panes glistening and spark ling behind her head, she was a conspicuous object and a striking contrast to the general forlornness and disarray, \u2014 the studied neglect and squalor. Not that it was a pro pitious face, for not one there gloomed more determinedly ; but it was the gloom of a summer shower shrined in a rainbow: the pout of a girl, and a lovely girl \u2014 a rustic' beauty growing up spontaneously like the convolvulus on the sea braes, with the same wonderful combination of delicacy and wildness. A throat like a swan's, a head like a fawn's, eyes like the shy beautiful eyes of a game bird, and a mouth that spoke frank, rash, froward words of love and hate \u2014 a delightful, bold, fearless, trusting, and tempt ing child's mouth, which, even as she frowned, burst apart, and showed the glistening teeth in their half appreciation and whole marvel at a. grand spectacle, a rare show in the town. The entire figure was in holiday array, as Montrose was dressed for his execution, in silk gown, worked apron, and gold chain with keys dangling at the side, lace stomacher, and a little lace cap laid flat \u2014 like the cap of the Christ Church boys \u2014 on the top of the over flowing, crisp, girlish dark hair. A young officer with a light step, a roving glance, and a gay, thoughtless heart, looked up and caught sight of the peerless picture, the one pleasant picture which the town presented. \" Good morrow, my pretty maid ; will you go with me?\" he called out of the undisciplined ranks, giving a scrape and a swagger."], [141, "\"GOOD MORROW, MT PRETTT MAID.\" 129 The blood rushed like fire over the beautiful young face ; but as the other women screamed and fell back, she stretched farther forward, and facing the audacious man, she drew her two arched brows into one straight black Hne, pressed her red Hps together, and uttered the bare monosyllable \"No,\" with an energetic rudeness that caused a hoarse laugh to rise and ring among the old rough John Bull soldiers. The young officer was a man of rank (as they say), and could linger and parley at will though he kept his comrades waiting. \" And why not ? \" he demanded in explanation. \" Because you are no an honest man,\" asserted the daring, confiding red lips, the wild eyes looking without winking at his dangling sword and silver-mounted pistols, the white throat swelling with fondness for and fidelity to his foe ; while a murmur and rustle of fear \u2014 an \" Oh, Mause, tak' tent and dinna brag the sodger,\" shook like wind among sHni willows and birches, and the group just beyond her. The officer reddened a shade in approach to the hue, \" angry and brave,\" of his coat, but he put the best face he could on the sharp retort. \" How do you know that, my pretty maid ? \" he went on, in mock defiance. \" By the colour of your coat,\" she answered, shortly ; \" no honest man wears siccan a coat on his back,\" \u2014 and she shut the window with a bang and ran from it in sudden panic, as the commanding officer behind cried \"Forward!\" and the loiterers advanced in double-quick time. Not before Captain Bernard, of Bernard's Court, in the wolds of Yorkshire, hailed a passer-by \u2014 \" Who was that lass that answered me from the window ? \" (He had learnt the term \" lass \" like the poor gallant Frenchified lad who, with the two words \" bonnie lass,\" won the woman's heart of Scotland.) \"Lass ! \" grumbled the pawky gangrel, \"she's nane of a lass; she's the young leddy of Legs-my-lea \" (Scottice for the Ecclesia Maria, of Church lands rechristened at the Reformation), \" Mistress Mause Mailin of Watergate that was ; the Laird of Legs-my-lea wedded her and brought her hame a month syne ; for him, you can speer word at her if ye want him, for he's gane like the lave of the men to the coals, or the peats, or the hay, or \u2014 aweel, the deil and their wives ken whaur.\" K"], [142, "130 A SCOTCH ROSE. It happened that Captain Bernard was left, much against his will, to hold the town with two scores of his men ; and before night the news was brought to him that the Laird of Legs-my-lea had been engaged in a tussle with the loyal militia of a landward town, at some miles' distance, had been wounded in the shoulder, had traded himself home Hke a wounded dog, and was lying hid in his house in the town at that very moment. \" Legs-my-lea ! \" cried the captain ; \" by George, that's the husband of the saucy jade who spurned me ! \" \"TOUR WORSHIPFUL SERVANT, MADAM.\" The Laird of Legs-my-lea's house in the town was scant of room. People did not require either space or privacy in those days, but did the most exciting deeds, elbowing each other, in the centre of well-informed, interested spectators. But there was trouble in the house, which makes a house smaller. Last month a bride had been brought home by a wildfire of a laird, who did not think \" going out \" and risking his head was sufficient business on his hands, but must marry a wife and risk her tender heart into the bargain. Now, a wounded man lay, boots and all, on the top of the qudt which Mause had patched, in the box-bed, that was not yet discarded from its position as a convenient article of furni ture in a private sitting-room. It was highly convenient for Magnus the laird \u2014 the comely, despotic, generous young giant, who was not so much injured that he could not raise himself on his elbow, see what was going on in the domestic economy, and put in his word when affairs went against his will, and in the fever and irritation of his wound he put in his word per petually. It was horribly inconvenient for Mause the lady, the laird's mother and his sister, and the lady's mother and her sister \u2014 all of whom had taken refuge in the one house of Legs-my-lea for comfort and company to each other, deserted as they were by their natural rulers and pro tectors."], [143, "\"TOUR WORSHIPFUL SERVANT, MADAM.\" 131 The women had business of their own, to which they did not want the man over whose unexpected return they had laughed and cried three hours before, to be a witness. Besides, Mause was fretted in the nursing of her husband by the interference of so many other nurses tendering their advice unasked, as a right of kindred, though Magnus turned his back upon them and would allow no one to put a finger on him, not even his old mother, none save his seventeen years' old wife of six weeks. In the mean time these good people took their ease in the erroneous impression that Cumberland's soldiers had marched through the town, and over the hills and far away, before Legs-my-lea's arrival. Engrossed by their own matter, they had not heard of Captain Bernard and his forty men having cooUy ensconced themselves in the town-house. It was a low-roofed, white-panelled room in which the family commotion prevailed, full of the mingled simplicity and mystery which our ancestors loved. Unsophisticated as the room looked, it was choke full of secrets. The box-bed opened like a cupboard. The cupboard itself was entered by a movable panel. Try to open it in the legiti mate way, and a man would require an axe to split the wood asunder ; but press a panel in one direction, and it slid away iu a trice, leaving to view an innocent enough thing, in its uselessness \u2014 a carved buffet, whittled into curves and scallops, not worth the man\u0153uvre of getting at it, unless that it bore poor Mause's blue-and-gold starred china, one cup of which was broken already. (And Mause could have sat down and cried when the fracture took place, ere she knew what she was about, had not Legs-my lea been still at her elbow to kiss the first big bright drop away ; and had she not promised herself never again to trust the egg-shell cups in clumsy, irresponsible fingers, but to wash them night and morning, like a good house wife, with her own' dainty hands, and dry them with her satin damask napkins.) The very window to the garden was not a window, but a door \u2014 half glass, half paneUed wood \u2014 which opened with so low a step to the flower border, that, lift the latch, and wreaths of green and white periwinkle, purple and green clematis, and single \" red, red \" roses leapt straight in and wove a shifting, fading,"], [144, "132 A SCOTCH ROSE. exquisite summer carpet on the coarse home-spun floor cloth. In this room the somewhat ominous gathering of the couple's relations sat, Hke a bench of judges, masquerading in damask gowns, pinners, and top-knots, and mumbled and mowed and skirled their sentences on the improper behaviour of the inexperienced heads of the house of Legs my-lea ; took Mause to task sharply, and spoke out their minds indirectly at the chained laird. \" What for did you don your best silk gown, my dochter ? \" insinuated old Lady Legs-my-lea, in a cracked voice, \"that suld have been kept for the king's coronation or for the butter-saps at least.\" \"And you have torn your negligee that cost me ever so many punds Scots, you wastrife bairn : \" old Lady Water gates, who was thrown so far off her guard as to confess to a price, flouted the youthful matron in another quavering pipe. \"All the town was thereto see,\" pleaded Mause, in sensitive vanity ; \" was Legs-my-lea's wife to appear like a common woman or like no wife at all, but an unspeered lass ? \" \" You are a bauld wife of two months \u2014 no out, that a strange man suld mint to address you, madam,\" her sister in-law, Mistress Littlejohn, whose husband was only the town clerk, and who was in her own person lank, with high cheek-bones, warned Mause austerely. \"And what garred ye answer the man, you cutty ? He'll think you a Hght woman ; but you were aye a for ward lass, or you would not be where you are,\" cried Peggy, the bride's unmarried elder sister, who had red hair and many freckles, and who tossed her uncovered maiden head scornfully, and gulped down an indignant sigh. \"I couldna help it,\" urged Mause irrelevantly ; \"my heart just came into my mouth.\" Legs-my-lea had lain there like a lion that has been hit, with his yellow hair so tumbled free from its powder and pomatum that it was flying loose as a mane and brushing Mause's soft cheek (much as it had done when she had sat at her wheel during the lono1 nights of the past stirring winter, and Legs-my-lea had gone a-courting to Watergates), wooed by the caressing touch, and uniting,"], [145, "\"TOUR WORSHIPFUL SERVANT, MADAM.\" 133 as amber draws straws, with Mause's dark curls, which had not yet taken the \"sit\" of the curch, but were still clustering in rich rings as under the light tie of the snood. But at this point Legs-my-lea started up against his own flesh and blood, and against Mause's, like a tyrant of the first water, and swore that nobody should \" confer \" (Anglice, contradict) Mause but him, and Mause was to do what she liked, and Mause's pleasure was his pleasure, and he should like to hear who would flyte on Mause after he said that ; but \" let them flyte ; \" and \" Mause, my joe, never mind the fules flytin.\" Legs-my-lea fell back exhausted ; the famdy storm died away in scared silence, till Mause, who had listened to her own condemnation with dry eyes, and an erect little head fairly sobbed at his defence. He had burst the bandage on his wound, and it was bleeding afresh, and that was what the cruel people had made by their work. At that very moment a friendly scout rushed in with an awful compHcation of evil tidings. The English were lying biUeted in the town : the English captain had word that Legs-my-lea had come to be cured of his hurt by the Hands of his young wife under his own roof-tree ; and the roystering blade of a captain having swallowed his dinner and swilled a bottle of claret under his belt, was tramping along the streets, breathing fire and smoke, and bringing a magistrate's warrant and a dozen of his men at his heels to apprehend the defenceless man, squatted Hke a hare by his own hearthstone. The report raised a frenzied rout, and above aU sounded the shriU accents of Magnus's mother. \" You see what you have done, Mause ; you have slain your ain gude man and my dear bairn by your glaiket pride and fule's passion.\" And Mause's despairing protest \u2014 \" Mother, I would dee for him ; I wiH dee for him.\" And Magnus's tender reassurance \u2014 \" Never heed my mother, Mause ; never heed man nor woman of them ; and you, mother, be silent, I command you. I tell you, my sweetheart, you have not harmed a hair of my head.\" No time was to be lost. After a short consultation, Magnus was hurried, sorely against the grain, through the glass door to try for an escape by the garden ; while young"], [146, "134 A SCOTCH ROSE. Mause, as his wife and representative, stayed behind, stiff with horror, yet straining all her powers of body and mind to meet the dreaded visitor. Mause was one of those girls ever put forward by nature and fortune. The youngest of her family, she was courted and wedded the first. She was the head of Legs-my-lea's household \u2014 over mother and maids and all. She was the woman who was challenged by, and who answered the challenge of Cumberland's wild officer. She was the wife left to keep the house, vindicate the honour, and cover the escape of her husband. When the quaking old mothers and wailing sisters shrank in their love into holes and corners out of sight, this girl of seventeen came to the front. She had not yet attained her full growth ; her endurance was only for a time ; her constancy failed after a struggle; but of her temper \u2014 tried and matured \u2014 heroines are made. Mause stood in her brave attire in the middle of the low roofed, white-walled room, with its secrets, her eyes wandering in agony to the glass door as Captain Bernard's firm step sounded on the threshold. The soldier came in with his cocked hat under his arm, bowed so low that he shook the powder from his hair, fixed on Mause his falcon blue eyes, as if he had never beheld her before, and said with covert irony, \" Your worshipful servant, madam.\" Mause responded with a throbbing heart, as if she had never till that moment set eyes on Cumberland's officer in his high collar, his stiff cravat, with his keen eyes and curl ing lips. \" What is your pleasure, sir ? \" she asked, curtsying \u2014 not to be beat in polite hypocrisy \u2014 so deep a curtsy that she concealed for whole three seconds the buckles in her high-heeled shoon ; at the same time she kept her untrained eyes on the floor-cloth, that she might not be tempted to look again at that dreadful glass door, before which the clematis stirred, though there was not a breath of wind in the sultry summer afternoon. \" Will you do me the favour to tell me, madam, when you last saw the Laird of Legs-my-lea ? \" inquired the Englishman, mincingly patting his cocked hat. \"Legs-my-lea left the town on the 3rd of July,\" said the girl, with whitening lips, checking off the number with her"], [147, "\"TOUB WORSHIPFUL SERVANT, MADAM.\" 135 third finger on her rosy palm, and falling into that equivo cating language in which an honest tongue invariably takes its first stumbHng step in deceit. \" Madam, the substance of your communication is false,\" observed Captain Bernard, rather pleasantly than other wise, dropping his hat, drawing out his jewelled snuff-box, and refreshing himself with a pinch of snuff in the most elegant manner imaginable. \"Sir,\" cried the rustic Mause, starting violently, \"how dare you say so ? \" \" I judge by the colour of your sleeve, madam. No honest woman wears such a sign on her arm,\" he replied, with a taunt ; and he snatched up one of poor Mause's cambric ruffles, on which was a foul stain of blood, not yet dry, from Legs-my-lea's sword-cut. Mause gave a loud dismal shriek, and fell at the Hanoverian's feet, praying \" Mercy ! mercy ! \" clinging to his knees, and almost dragging him round with his back to the glass door, where, at the moment he touched her, she had seen Legs-my-lea's inflamed face glaring through the panes. But in another instant the glass was broken with a crash, the door flung open, and Legs-my-lea staggered in. \" I am your prisoner, captain. Get up, Mause, you quean, and do not beg grace of any loon. Hands off my wife, sir! I surrender.\" In the doting passion of his honeymoon, Legs-my-lea was half-furious that Mause should abjectly crave even his life and liberty from another mac He would prefer to have the English officer's hand clapped on his shoulder, though that gripe should lead him to the Tolbooth, with the dark Tower of London and its purple block in the dis tance, than that the white-ringed fingers should ruffle the plumage and brush the bloom of his darling. Captain Bernard looked from one to the other with his rapid glance. He arranged the \" top \" of his hair fop pishly ; but as he did so he exposed to view above the jeering lip and the thin nostril that quivered excitedly, a frank, open brow. \" You are my prisoner, Legs-my-lea,\" he said plainly, \" but it may be better for you than if you had fallen into our hands later in the day (as you assuredly would unless"], [148, "136 A SCOTCH ROSE. you had fled forth of Scotland), when I might have had less power to protect you. Now, all that I insist on is, that you lie still in your own house in the town untd your wounds be healed, and afterwards that you hold yourself bound not to bear arms against King George for a year and a day, when, as I think, there will be no other prince or standard left in Scotland for you to fight for. As for you, madam,\"\u2014 and the soldier smiled on Mause with the sweetness of a brave man's smile, \u2014 \" on some summer day to come, either here in your own house, or in my house of Bernard's Court, in England, I trust you will take back your hard words, and grant that there are honest men and pitiful men, as well as knaves, bulhes, and cut-throats, who wear my uniform.\" Not on one summer day alone, but on days of snow and frost, at home and abroad, Mause admitted it humbly, and thanked God on her bended knees for the husband of her youth and the father of her bairns, that in the ranks she had condemned the wheat grew strong-stemmed and full-eared with the tares. In proof of the statement Scotchmen still tell how James Wolfe raised his sickly, stern head and defied Bluff Bill to the face, when he received the order to stab the prisoners and the wounded men, lying thick as faHen leaves on the black spring heather of Drummossie Moor. \"I ama soldier,\" answered the future hero of Quebec, \" not an executioner.\""], [149, "FROM ENGLISH GARDEN PLOTS."], [150, ""], [151, "A SWEET PEA. (TID'S OLD RED RAG OF A SHAWL.) \" Mt poor mother always said, if there was a thing in the world that you might keep seven years, and find a use for at last, it was a red shawl \u2014 a shawl that had been a respectable shawl in its day. While two threads hang together, it will keep you warm ; while a shade of the glorious scarlet remains, it will make you stylish.\" And Tid screwed round her shoulders, and craned her neck to see her heels, her old red rag of a shawl, come originally from a hand-loom of Hindustan \u2014 thin at some places, crimson not scarlet at others, with the silk fringe like eye lashes rapidly moulting away. \" Come along, do, Miss Farren, have done with your lecture, and go on with the play,\" urged an impatient voice from behind a clothes-screen. \" Dear, dear, yes,\" chimed in another, issuing from a cupboard ; \" we're not in class now, and we have not mastered the first part.

The man or woman who describes the junior governess, even in hard lines, as habitually moody and mournful, has never studied the genus. Time may tell, work may tell, but while aU the world is young, the junior governess is young too, and young with all her heart. Matilda, Tilda, Tid Farren was preparing to act pro verbs, charades, tableaux vivants, with the pupils a few years older than herself, at the Miss Hibberds', Lavender Lane, Richmond, for the coming holidays. Tid was indis pensable, and if anything, her shawl was still more indis pensable. They went on the boards, Tid and her shawl, side by side, in capability and popularity. Their powers of the dramatic and the comical were far beyond rivalry, and were the themes of universal admiration. Nothing could be done without them. What Tom Thumb geraniums are in a garden, Tid and her shawl were on the school-room stage : they were the brilliant, salient points in the green ness, pinkness, flatness, cloy sugarness and general milk and-wateriness of the rest. Tid and her shawl had already been \" on \" in Red Riding Hood foreshortened, in Abd-el- Kader with a superb sash, in Lady Macbeth with a gorgeous turban ; and they made a final and crowning coup, and drew down such rounds of applause that the Miss Hibberds rung their bell and stopped the performance, in the smartest, nattiest little Duke of Wellington, in full field marshal's uniform. CHAPTER I. THE MISS HIBBERDS IN COUNCIL, OPEN AND CLOSE. The Miss Hibberds were holding a court-martial, attended by all the officers in their service, in the dining-room of their school, Lavender Lane, Richmond. The Miss Hibberds were of a certain age. Miss Hibberd was tall, had a small fine head, like a greyhound's which set off her velvet head-dress with lace lappets. She wore"], [153, "THE MISS HIBBERDS IN COUNCIL, OPEN AND CLOSE. 141 hoop-rings on china hands, cambric cuffs on spare wrists, a narrow neck-ribbon, like a dog's coUar, fastening a deli cate little brooch beneath the skinny bag under the pointed chin, and always looked as if she put herself fully dressed into a safe band-box at night, and took herself out as fresh as paint in the morning. Miss Charlotte Hibberd was short and stout, with a solid neck, a big head, and much strong grizzled hair, so as to render it difficult for her, in the very same costume as Miss Hibberd, to make the most distant approach to elegance. Miss Blount, the senior English governess, had turned the old maid's corner of thirty, and had clothed herself in a lavender woollen gown, with a ruche of the same material round the neck, without any other adornment, in the heat of summer. Her complexion was too muddled to suffer from the wear and tear of life ; but the leonine cast of her mouth was deeply dented by high spirit, strong sense, a few crotchets on the social science movement, and con siderable experience of grim care. Mdlle. De la Rue was twenty-eight, and dressed elaborately. She had ringlets, a gilt comb, a knot of ribbon, a nosegay, a general rustle of silk and aroma of perfume. Her sallow face was sharp in contour and expression, even when it languished, in accompaniment to words of mock heroism and stage sentiment, and quotations from French classics, from Les Horaces, Athalie, and the Ruy Bias. Fraulein Kester was about the same age as her French sister. She put up the broad chin of a broad face in a white worked cravat, and wore a net drawn almost to her in visible eyebrows over her sandy hair, finished by a row of Httle tassels like Httle bells aU round her head, and a pair of large tassels with loops of cord Hke bell-pulls above her left ear. Fraulein Kester was a specimen of good living and phlegmatic philosophy. Miss Farren, the junior EngHsh governess, at eighteen had been put, with her own consent, into a lavender gown, in imitation of Miss Blount ; but the Quaker colour could not quench blushes, erase dimples, or dim eyes \u2014 only mor tification and vexation did that. Miss Farren possessed a round-browed, soft-cheeked, cleft-chinned face ; but at this"], [154, "142 A SWEET PEA. moment she was not acting charades \u2014 it was tear-stained out of the last remnant of pure complexion, and the accom panying nice brown hair and the nice collar and sleeves were like the feathers of the most ruffled little bird in the world. The court-martial sat on a culprit, and if mercy were not * found in the breasts of the members there was little in the court-room to call forth the tender emotions. The dining- room at No. 2, Lavender Lane was not a spacious room, whose rich, warm mahogany is redolent of the lingering fumes of aldermanic feasts, and whose sideboard makes a brave display of plate and crystal ; neither was it a snug family-room, where papa's pet is cockered up in a high chair at his elbow for the dessert at least, and clamours vociferously after ruddy grapes and russet apples. It was the barest, dullest room in Lavender Lane, where the sight of maps and dictionaries, scratches in pencil-drawing, or splashes in sepia, would have been a relief, as the girls said. It was like an hospital hall, a prison board, supposing prisoners ate in company. Long table, long benches, no rests for growing spines, urgent necessity for slim ankles being crooked round each other, till slippers, balanced on toe-tips, dropped and betrayed the unlady-like practice ; faint memories of milk-soup, mince, rice-pudding. Though called the dining-room, all the meals at No. 2, Lavender Lane, with a preponderance of weak tea and untoasted bread in the victuals, were served there \u2014 Miss Hibberd at the head of the table, Miss Charlotte at the foot, Miss Blount with her eye on the big girls, Miss Farren dodging the small fry, Mdlle. De la Rue turning up her eyes at the ragout, Fraulein Kester aiming at a second spoonful of the salad : not a shred of conversation, unless when Miss Hibberd addressed a sentence in a company voice to Miss Charlotte, or when one of two incidents happened. First incident : Miss Anna Maria or Miss Lucy Jane caught with her knife in her mouth threatening suicide, or her spoon grasped close to the spoon's mouth by her whole four fingers and thumb in imminent danger of messing her frock ; or when a shrill little voice called out with its tears, that its owner could not eat fat, or crust, or Jamaica pepper, and its owner was assured, with solemn dogmatism, that good little girls \u2014 lady-like little girls \u2014 could eat any-"], [155, "143 THE MISS HIBBERDS IN COUNCIL, OPEN AND CLOSE. thing. (N.B. \u2014 Virtue and gentdity are so fast wedded in girls' schools that it is a wonder that women ever succeed in dissevering them.) Second incident : when Miss Main waring was detected crumbling down her bread in process of coming to want, or Miss Finch eating mustard, and rendering herself inadmissible at Almack's when Almack's existed, and was summarHy pounced upon and brought to justice. Miss Hibberd herself gave a sigh of relief when school meals were ended, and Miss Farren could have gone out into the laurel walk \u2014 there is always a laurel walk at a school \u2014 and chirped Hke a linnet. Miss Farren was not chirping now \u2014 she was crying bitterly, ruffling her brown hair as crying ruffles hair when little hands press it from the brow, and clasp themselves tightly over the shrinking face. Miss Farren was ar raigned before the authorities, accused of misdemeanour in the presence of her fellows, unmistakably found guilty, and only awaiting her sentence. She was not attempting to prevaricate or defend herself, but collapsing with shame and distress, willing to creep into a mouse's hole. No marvel that Miss Farren was overcome to listen to the big words hurled at the girl's devoted head. \" Evd example,\" \"trust abused,\" \"ingratitude,\" \"giddiness,\" \"unworthy yielding to an unworthy young man's advances.\" At the last ex pression Miss Farren looked up and spoke up a little. \" No, please, Miss Hibberd, don't say so ; Mr. Bishop did not mean to do me harm \u2014 he only meant to be kind.\" And there Tid broke down worse than ever. \" You are an excellent judge, Miss Farren,\" said Miss Hibberd, with irony. \" Very dignified, delicate-minded, brotherly kindness in Mr. Bishop to write notes to Miss Farren, and hand them to her along with the poor dear deceived girls' exercises \u2014 notes making appointments for half-holidays ; and one of the notes was found and whis pered about, so that the affair cannot be hushed up even if Miss Charlotte and myself would consent to such a breach of truth. Miss Farren to receive the notes and keep the appointments, and wear particular dresses for the occa sions \" \u2014 bringing herself up short in summing up the main offences, and leaving herself out of breath \u2014 \" Oh ! Miss Farren ! \" \" Oh ! Miss Farren ! \" echoed Miss Charlotte, in so deep"], [156, "144 A SWEET PEA. a voice from her bulk as to have something sepulchral in its tones. \"Ah, ciel! \" cried Mdlle. De la Rue, clasping her bony hands, thinking at the same time : \" Quelle sottise ! If that cold, shy monsieur had had taste for the tournure, if he had made eyes at me, ma foi ! he should have been mon preux chevalier all the seasons, without these viedles demoiseUes, or any one else, being the wiser.\" \" So, so ! \" Fraulein Kester testified in condemnation, raising her net by an elevation of her light eyebrows, and dechning it again, all the tassels shaking simultaneously like so many dumb-bells, while she considered : \" Es bedeutete nichts die Briefe, die zusammenkommen, when they might have loved as philosophers, and not have risked the Butterbrod ! \" Miss Blount said plainly: \"I am surprised that you could be so foolish, Miss Farren, though you are a girl of eighteen.\" \" He only wrote to me thrice,\" pleaded the girl, at bay ; \" and once was about Miss Martin's bad spelling in her dictation. I wore no particular dress, but my red shawl, that he might see me coming. He only took me to Hamp ton Court, and we went and came early by the 'bus. The chestnuts were in flower at Bushy, and I saw the real picture, the copy of which I was copying ; and he thought I was looking ill, and that a change would do me good.\" And here there was a most deplorable departure from the model of the Iron Duke. \" Enough, Miss Farren ! \" Miss Hibberd ended the sit ting austerely. \" Thrice or three hundred times, what does it matter ? To Hampton Court, where the cook and the housemaid's young men, if they are so left to them selves as to have these unnecessary appendages, wish to take them of a Sunday ! but they know it is as much as their places are worth to consent. Poor ignorant women ! they have some sense of propriety and obedience. I wonder it was not Hampton Court on a Sunday, Miss Farren ! I need not say you must both resign your situa tions ; and I cannot tell you whether I am glad or sorry that it is the eve of the Midsummer holidays, and you may be spared disgrace, or that society will lose a warning. But I should like to know how could the upper classes"], [157, "145 THE MISS HIBBERDS IN COUNCIL, OPEN AND CLOSE. trust Miss Charlotte and me with the rearing and training of young ladies, if they knew that such iniquitous con- tempt of duty occurred actually within the shelter of our walls ? You'll keep your room, Miss Farren ; you are not sit to be seen, and you will not be guilty of any further folly in my house. Miss Blount, Mdlle., and Fraulein, I shall feel obliged by your overlooking the young ladies' packing. It is fortunate for the poor innocent young things that they are too much occupied with going home, to discover and be corrupted by this disgraceful precedent. Miss Charlotte, you will be so good as to accompany me to our sitting-room.\" Miss Hibberd sailed out, Miss Charlotte stumped out, Mademoiselle shrugged her shoulders with that incompar- able French shrug, Fraulein repeated her \" So \u2014 so ! \" with an entirely different note of meaning. Miss Farren believed she was ruined, and, what was a great deal harder to bear, had ruined young Mr. Bishop, the English and classical master, and only wished she could make it up to him, and run away for ever. Miss Blount set off gruffly to do as she was bid, throwing over her shoulder \u2014 \"If you don't dry your eyes, Miss Farren, you'll bave one of your styes. You know you are not enough of a woman to have left off styes.\" Miss Hibberd and Miss Charlotte were in their own room, not in the drawing-room, with its narrow mirrors and attenuated alabaster vases with wax flowers, where the girls occasionally appeared in low-necked white dresses, and made believe they were attending an evening party, and playing their pieces and singing their duets in public, without gentlemen or supper, and the wilder girls com- pared the performance to eating lamb without mint-sauce, or cold beef without pickled walnuts. The Miss Hib- berds' private parlour was a little hole, the floor covered with a faded old carpet, and where neither rickety work- table nor hideous silhouettes could have been kept for effect. Miss Hibberd dropped into the nearest chair and put her elbows on the table ; Miss Charlotte seated herself inconveniently on a high ancient music-stool and set it twirling round, balancing herself on one exposed foot, as if that foot were not flat to begin with, and did not have its remaining symmetry destroyed by bunions. L"], [158, "146 A SWEET PEA. \" Clandestine correspondence ! the omnibus ! Hampton! very heedless and low ! I'm disgusted. At the same time I'm as sorry as can be, Lot.\" \"I'm the same, Kitty; and what is to become of the creature Tid ? \" What would you have ? The Miss Hibberds were not ogres \u2014 they. were schoolmistresses. They could put off their armour of politeness and savageness, and sit in their easy buff coats of familiarity and charity, and enjoy their plum-cake and green tea, their roast pheasant and glass of Madeira, as well and a good deal better than their neigh bours. The very girls, except the bad ones, who cheat and hate schoolmistresses, saw through them. They had a language and bearing of the school, as there is a language and bearing of the law, the camp, the church ; but every body took it for what it was worth, unless, indeed, an unlucky Tid Farren, in matters of conscience. Tid had carried off all the head prizes at Miss Hibberds', and been quite a crack hand and show-card from the time that she came a little orphan pupil, educated at half-price, up through the stages of pupil-teacher and junior governess, until she was the most spirited actress of charades, as we have seen ; but she was at the same time the most easily put down, the most confiding, scrupulous little goose. Yet Tid had come to grief, doubtless, because, \"frailty, thy name is woman.\" \" Who could have thought it of Tid ! \" groaned Miss Charlotte. \" But there was always a silliness about that child, though the Doctor declared her verses were worthy of a Cantab. She would let herself be cheated out of house and home in calico \u2014 twilled and plain \u2014 and needles, blunts and square-eyes. The more shame to Mr. Bishop ! \" \" Not at all,\" contradicted Miss Hibberd, getting vicious. \"Mr. Bishop would not have looked twice at Tid if she had not looked at him,\" Miss Hibberd assured her con founded sister. \" It is my principle, Lot, that any well educated girl can keep the most presumptuous young man in the kingdom at a distance, if she chooses. Bishop indeed ! a soft, mooning fellow, who cannot manage the girls without help.\" Observe the pride or the magnanimity of the sexss. A man would have said that it was Bishops blame, the block-"], [159, "147 THE MISS HIBBERDS IN COUNCIL, OPEN AND CLOSE. head ought to have thought what he was about before he led astray the girl, and got her into a row; while Miss Hibberd maintained that it was the girl who led the fellow astray. And such contradictory judgments are in force all the world over. \" I shall speak to Mr. Bishop when he comes for his fees, and have nothing more to do with him,\" ended Miss Hibberd. \" Miss Blount is to set up a school over against the Park \u2014 her aunt's old school, you know, dear \u2014 in August,\" suggests Miss Charlotte, hesitatingly. \" Might not she try Mr. Bishop ? He has been very painstaking, and he is a scholar and a university man, only he has not got too much to do. 1 see that, not only by his being in a hurry, but bv his hat's being brushed to the last hair of the nap ; and I think sometimes that he turns down his wristbands to hide his gloves \u2014 he could not mend them himself, I suppose : I could find it in my heart to offer, only it would not be proper. Dear me ! I don't mean because he is a gentleman, Kitty \u2014 when he might be my son, and none knowing my age better than yourself, only you look a great deal younger \u2014 but because of our position. There is no such thing yet as iron gloves \u2014 I don't mean the old gauntlets, of course,\" explained Miss Charlotte ; \" but Hke the collars and bands that one reads of in the papers. Might not Miss Blount do something for Tid also, when they have agreed so well together ? Mademoiselle and Fraulein have both got engagements in the country, and so, for all you said, Kitty, this vexatious business might be hushed up. I am sure Mr. Bishop and Tid would never be so foolish and wrong again. It is dreadful to think of turning off two inexperienced, unprotected young persons; it must feel so bad when we come to say our prayers,\" entreated Miss Charlotte, piteously. \" A work of necessity \" \u2014 Miss Hibberd laid down the law relentlessly. \" Miss Blount told me that she was to keep on the former teachers, and quite right too. Can't you comprehend, Lot,\" Miss Hibberd continued drily, \" Miss Blount, who is a remarkably sensible woman, keep her off air and water, would be an idiot to take the two of them ? There would be the English master kissing the governess behind the school-room doors next ! Monstrous! \""], [160, "148 A SWEET PEA. \" What will become of Tid if she can't procure another situation ? \" mused Miss Charlotte, in the deepest depres sion. \" Situations ain't as plentiful as blackberries, and you will be obliged to tell the reason you dismissed her when people come to ask a recommendation.\" \" Why, that is her business ! \" exclaimed Miss Hibberd, losing patience. \"And I'll tell you what, Lot \u2014 you are not to be so intolerable as to go into low spirits about this affair, as you did when that fool Miss Ludlow refused to put out the girls' lights, and called it menial. I have quite enough on my hands without that. I shall speak to Mr. Bishop, on the ground that he did not think fit to speak to me before taking notice of one of our teachers. I shall do no more than point out to the mistaken young man his dishonourable, ungentlemanlike behaviour.\" CHAPTER n. MR. BISHOP ON DUTT, AND UNDER CROSS-EXAMINATION. Mr. Bishop was the most modest of men: he blushed after he knocked at a door ; he was ready to drop down when he presented his card and stated his business. There was no want of capacity in his broad, fair forehead, serene when it was not pink with agitation ; but there was great want of assurance. How so modest a man and Tid, likewise a sensitive girl, found courage to pick up a particular acquaintance and advance to what Miss Hibberd would have called philandering, was one of the puzzles which occur in society every day. Mr. Bishop, besides his constitutional shyness, laboured under the constraint of a sense of wrong-doing, with its call for concealment, \u2014 not in the affair with Tid. Mr. Bishop was so infatuated that he saw no culpability there : he felt in the seventh heaven, he glorified himself on his intercourse with Tid ; but Mr. Bishop had a vice\u2014 not dogs or horses\u2014 to which he was addicted; he smoked- he smoked pretty considerably. A reckless, dissipated young man he was, more particular about the 'quality of his Havannahs and Manillas than the texture of his kids \u2022 and"], [161, "MR. BISHOP . N DUTT, AND UNDER CROSS-EXAMINATION. 149 he could not resist the desire or deny himself its gratifica tion. His long trudges on foot, his jolting rides in 'busses, his irregular meals \u2014 he had neither mother nor sister to live with him \u2014 his wearying, worrying profession, his soli tary life, might be slight excuses. Notwithstanding, to enter No. 2, Lavender Lane, or any other virgin's bower, with an odour of stale tobacco, even in the refined guise of the best cheroots, impregnating and oozing from his person, was a privilege that Mr. Bishop was sufficiently open to reason to recognize, could only be accorded to Fraulein Kester's huge, tranquil countryman, Herr Schneider, who never doubted that everybody, Frau and Fraulein, approved of his meerschaum and its enchant ment \u2014 a privilege absolutely refused to a young English and classical master, though it was his only solace, and though he had accustomed himself to smoke half the nights when he sported his oak at college. Mr. Bishop was constantly sniffing his own air guiltily, unfurling his frayed-out handkerchief, with its overdone, atrocious odour of patchouli, drawing his fingers through his soft, lank hair. In his agonizing apprehensions of accusation and remonstrance from teachers like the Miss Hibberds and the female heads of families, Mr. Bishop ran up a serious score at a hairdresser's for aromatic pomades and perfumes, and he bought and paid for as many bouquets, like a dandy on the steps of his club, as he spent on rolls, every morning from March to November ; he had such slavish dependence on a bunch of violets, or a cluster of roses, a sprig of mignonette or of heliotrope, to refresh his seedy young person, that he could not venture abroad to play his part for the day without a flower in his button. In mid-winter he trusted that a hard frost broke scent to human as to canine noses. Mr. Bishop was the youngest unmarried master at No. 2, Lavender Lane. He stood five feet eight in his boots : he had a tolerable nose, and almond-shaped grey eyes ; he was weak in whisker, but was not in consequence so far left to himself as to set up a straggling beard : he was strong in forehead even when it was pink, and there was a charm in the reverential distance that he kept from the girls \u2014 the kind of chivalry with which he invested them, though, being girls, they were not capable of appreciating"], [162, "150 A SWEET PEA. the treatment \u2014 they were more susceptible to the vagrant aroma of tobacco, which supplied the young man to them with the zest that the thorn gives to the rose. Bishop was a great favourite with the girls ; many of them doted on him, styled him in confidence, \" Dear Bishop,\" \" sweet Bishop,\" \" that duck Bishop \" \u2014 surrepti- tously hoarded the pencils he dropped, the bits of paper he had occasion to write upon, particularly the ends of the cigars he lost, dreamt of him, plaited their hair at him, made dreadful allusions to him in their verses, which would have thrown Bishop into fits, and caused him to bolt in shame and dismay, had he understood them, as he corrected the halting lines. On the other hand, they all bullied him, tormented him, and barefacedly cheated him. This day Bishop was merely in class to give them their places and return them their papers ; but even to-day Miss Bewcastle popped in with her bonnet on her head, giggling and causing the rest to giggle at the liberty. \" Please, madam, do me the favour to remove that bonnet, I cannot see your face. I shall make a mistake,\" implored Mr. Bishop. Being the man he was, it is need- less to say that Bishop was near-sighted. \" Oh, please, Mr. Bishop,\" responded Miss Bewcastle, joyously lifting up her head, and glancing out from beneath her turned-back curls, \" it won't come off. I tried it on to see how it would do to travel in ; it has just come from the milliner, and the string has run into a knot, and it won't come off \u2014 you can try it yourself if you like \u2014 unless I cut it, the new string, Mr. Bishop.

What do you say? Sit here only one day and the Miss Hibberds and the rest see me ? No, I won't, sir, I tell you plainly. I should not mind it if I were not below that cunning, spiteful dwarf Rhoda Turner, and I the head and shoulders taller ; and Mr. Vallance says I am the best artist in the school now.

BISHOP ON DUTT, AND UNDER CROSS-EXAMINATION. 151 heart within to melt behind the muslin Garibaldi \u2014 \"ever since \" \u2014 sob \u2014 \" I gave you \" \u2014 sob, sob \u2014 \" a lozenge for your cough \" \" Miss Yates, you were very kind, but I am a man of honour,\" protested Mr. Bishop. \" You are all women of honour, young gentlewomen, for whom I have the most thorough respect and regard. You have all done well, at least I have made no complaint. If any one of you is the best artist in the school, I protest I am proud to hear it ; but that excellence does not qualify you to sit highest in the English and rudimentary Latin class. Indeed, I think I would be content with one distinction if I were you, Miss Yates.\" \"But, Mr. Bishop \" \u2014 and big rebellious Miss Yates drew a gusty sigh \u2014 \" Rhoda Turner has a distinction too.\" \"And it is my due when you are allowed to gain one, and when you do not know adverbs from adjectives, and wrote in your essay that Roger Bacon was Lord Chancellor of England,\" cried little Rhoda defiantly. Mr. Bishop was no more fit to control girls than he was to put babies in their cradles, or to embroider pincushions. He could be firm with boys : the fact was, they called him a contradictory, obstinate pig; but, in his present develop ment, he dealt with the girls in so gingerly a fashion, was so frightened at being hard or harsh to them, so much more affronted than they were at the idea of taking liberties with them, that it was necessary Tid should sit, finishing up school-work, with a womanly, home-like air, in the room with his class, positively to prevent the girls copying each other's exercises under Mr. Bishop's well formed nose, or repeating their lessons, which ought to have been said by heart, off neatly written slips of paper, neatly pinned inside their wide sleeves or under their fancy aprons. But evil came of that precaution in its turn. Mr. Bishop passed on to his last interview for the season with Miss Hibberd. He had only to call himself back and correct himself for wrong names and numbers, for first cheating himself and then Miss Hibberd, and assure her, in penitent pertnrbation, that he had added up the whole correctly in his lodgings last night, and that he could not tell, with all his mathematics, why the sums would come out wrong in her drawing-room next day."], [164, "152 A SWEET PEA. Miss Charlotte entered, ducked to Mr. Bishop, and dropped down on a chair, with her whole drapery, crino line and all, swathed round her in the most inexplicable manner. Miss Hibberd shook out her own dress, smoothed her gloved hands with a significant frown at Miss Charlotte, and said, stiffly, \" I have a few words more to say to you, Mr. Bishop. I am exceedingly sorry, I am shocked by the cause of them.\" \"It is the smoking at last,\" thought the young man. \" I had out my match on Wednesday before I was beyond the shrubbery. I was thinking of Tid, and I might have been in the drawing-room, or in a first-class carriage, it would have been all the same.\" But he answered hypo critically, the perspiration starting at every pore : \" I am very sorry, madam, I am at a loss- \" and there stopped for the crisis. \"Mr. Bishop, I believe you have become acquainted, under our roof, with our governess, Miss Farren ? \" \" Madam, I have the honour,\" gasped Mr. Bishop, his former flush, in the unexpected shock, paling to a girl's \u2014 to Tid's \u2014 paleness. \" The honour! \" Miss Hibberd could not help repeating in a high key. \" The honour which could be shown in writing notes \u2014 and such notes ! in a ladies' school, and in going in 'busses to Hampton, and \u2014 and other places on half-holidays.\" \"Madam, madam!\" \u2014 stammered Mr. Bishop, more faintly, clasping his shabby hat to his heart. \" We had reason to expect more consideration. Having conducted ourselves with unblemished propriety all our lives, we were justified in imagining that a young lady and gentleman would respect our roof, and the confidence we placed in them, and not indulge in the most reprehensible associations and appointments. We have been mistaken : temptations have been presented, deceit has been practised. Our young people \u2014 the numerous household of young ladies of the highest character \u2014 who have been livino under our care and profiting by the instructions given under the direction of Miss Charlotte and myself, have been exposed to the most unsettling, the most demoralizing influences.\""], [165, "MR. BISHOP ON DUTT, AND UNDER CROSS-EXAMINATION. 153 Miss Hibberd delivered her harangue with great state liness. Miss Charlotte listened, much impressed. \" Miss Hibberd, I beg your pardon,\" burst out Mr. Bishop. \"I had no conception you would regard any little approach that I made to Tid, to Miss Farren, in so dark a light. I should have asked your permission \u2014 I mean about Hampton Court : I know now I ought not to have written the notes, but I was so accustomed to writing \u2014 no, to correcting things, imaginary letters along with her \u2014 that I could not resist the inclination \u2014 though I should have controlled myself \u2014 to have one of her own composition all to myself. But, about Hampton Court, I should have asked permission, only asking is such hard work to me, Miss Hibberd ; and then you know \u2014 you know, you might have refused.\" \" I should most undoubtedly have refused, Mr. Bishop,\" Miss Hibberd assured him. \" I should have been very much annoyed ; but my faith in you would not have been destroyed. I might not have felt under the painful necessity of informing you that your services will not be required, under any circumstances, next session in Lavender Lane.\" \" Very well, Miss Hibberd,\" assented young Bishop, so quietly, that he might have had an engagement at the Due d'Aumale's, or been free to dine at the Star and Garter, and moved towards the door. The sudden manliness touched Miss Hibberd more than any apology or display of ignorance of the world, rashness, and single-heartedness \u2014 Mr. Bishop looking so young all the time. \" I have no fault to find with your teaching or with your conduct in other respects,\" conceded Miss Hibberd. \" In spite of your imprudence, I will stretch a point and let you have a testimonial, if you wish it, Mr. Bishop.\" \" Thank you \" \u2014 Mr. Bishop still expressed himself with unusual self-control and with a little bitterness. \" I am a young strong fellow ; I have had a good education, thanks to my poor father. I believe there is nothing against my character ; but I cannot afford to dispense with the favour.\" Miss Hibberd drew her desk towards her while Miss Charlotte blew her nose. Miss Hibberd paused, and said again, in her mania for being just, \" I feel for any member"], [166, "154 A SWEET PEA. of my sex ; I would shield her from blame, except where fairness must be compromised. I think it is but fair to tell you that I do not believe you would have been so foolish if Miss Farren had not been equally, nay still more foolish \u2014 for a woman's discretion should never be off its guard, and ought to inform and confirm a man's. Miss Farren has forfeited my good opinion for perfect judgment and propriety. I am very much disappointed in Miss Farren ; she cannot continue in Lavender Lane, and be Miss Blount's successor, as I intended.\" \"Miss Hibberd!\" \u2014 Miss Hibberd started, Miss Charlotte stumbled to her feet; the voice was so resolute, so eager, so full of a true man's longing hope and gladness \u2014 \" if you say that, it may be worth my while to offer to Miss Farren what I have not had the face to offer her before. It may be worth a destitute young girl like Tid's while to accept me. I am young, strong, with the most available weapon, that of a good education. Bless you ! I'm learned beside Tid, clever and bright as she is : I'm a thousand times better qualified to keep the wolf from the door than a tender young girl is qualified. I have my last quarter's salary, and I don't owe more than a trifle. I'll restrict myself to a cheroot a day, or I'll give them up altogether. If I don't get more teaching I can turn book-keeper, copying-clerk, reporter, prompter. I'm young and strong, and thank God, He has kept me honest. What should hinder me from marrying Tid, and working for her and with her ? She'll help, if I am forced to let her. She is not useless, nervous, proud : she's an earnest, energetic, simple little darling. I know she's simple, but I prefer the woman with heart and brain, courage and resource, to the helpless, haughty, suspicious woman, though the first has the guilelessness to be cheated. We'll both be cheated ! \" raved Mr. Bishop, like an inspired young mad man, \" and look grave for a moment, and then laugh and grow wiser. I durst not have taken Tid from the security and prosperity of a father's house ; but she has told me that she is a penniless orphan, and you have told me you can have nothing more to do with her. What is to hinder me from marrying Tid Farren, and finding room for her, and strength with her, and bliss in her, in my lodging at Clapham ? You cannot say I have not told you this time, Miss Hibberd.\""], [167, "155 MR. BISHOP ON DUTT, AND UNDER CROSS-EXAMINATION. \"My dear Mr. Bishop,\" Miss Hibberd was remonstrating, literally, her handsome old face looking young again ; Miss Charlotte was patting the modest, fervent young man on the back, as if he were her son ; and Tid, in the back ground, was prepared to find the poorest marriage with him infinitely before going off in a carriage-and-four with a millionaire Tid was married in a country church, not very far off, in Kent, where the Misses Hibberd were spending their holidays. You may be sure that her wedding-gown was a very plain one, and as it threatened rain, she was thankful to have her old red shawl tucked round her as she ran from the porch to the cab. The Misses Hibberd were there without ostentation, and without putting down their names in the register, but in orthodox silks and white bonnets \u2014 that on Miss Charlotte's broad head falling obstinately back to the nape of her neck, and exposing her wild natural fronts. Miss Blount walked up the aisle in exact time for the ceremony, in her ordinary lavender woollen gown and mantle \u2014 come in the third class, and never was better seated in her life ; a trifle of dust, but nothing to choke her, and the company of an intelligent market-woman and two day-labourers, who listened atten- tively to her reasons for opening all the windows, and were much struck when she described a canary bird, hung within the closed curtains of a four-post bed, found dead in the morning. Miss Blount carried in her hand a present for Tid \u2014 not a card-case, or a fish-knife and fork, or a toilet bottle ; but a thermometer for testing the heat of her sitting-room at Clapham, and printed directions for ascertaining the mineral qualities of the water which she drank there \u2014 warranting Tid that if she were careful to breathe fresh air and drink pure water, she need not mind much besides : she would thrive, and she might make Bishop thrive. \" But no narcotics \u2014 mind, Tid, not a nar- cotic any more than an alcohol, on pain of a gradual stupe- faction of the brain. Break your husband's pipe, Tid ; fling away his cherished weed ; never mind though he be as restless as a whirlwind and as cross as two straws. No narcotics, else you will have him dull, and grey, and sodden, and imbecile in no time.\""], [168, "156 A SWEET PEA. CHAPTER III. TID AND HER HUSBAND TO THE RESCUE. Tid was the wife of Mr. Bishop, in the lodging at Clap ham, and by the express favour of the Miss Hibberds, came and went with the train, and acted as day governess at No. 2, Lavender Lane. It was a dangerous precedent which the Miss Hibberds established, and they had a great many consultations before granting it ; but grant it they did. Tid told Bishop she liked it. It would be different when she had a house of her own to manage, but now she preferred bustling about and \" breaking herself by degrees of classes, tasks, and school-girls.\" It was a remarkably fine autumn, and when it was wet she had her waterproof cloak and 'goloshes. Everybody knew her, and was kind to her, and she lunched with the Miss Hibberds at least twice a week \u2014 in confidence, she believed that it was every time the dear old things had anything particularly nice to themselves. The evenings were sufficient, as yet, for Tid's shopping, her adventures in housekeeping, her enterprises on Bishop's shirts and handkerchiefs, gloves and stockings, her new wristbanding and collaring, and darning, and clearstarch ing and ironing. Bishop was at home then to run in and chatter to, to help through with his pupils' themes, to ask reading from, if he wanted to be asked, and stroll out with and \"have a smoke with,\" as Bishop called it, putting a force on language, and build castles in the air with, and have searches for bats and beetles on earth, and constella tions in the sky, like a pair of Cockneys, clever, slightly pedantic and scientific, and attached to each other. In the process Tid was always taking care of Bishop, bringing him in to supper, getting him up to breakfast, inciting him to courage and constancy in his profession. Tid soon lost her childishness \u2014 not her child-likeness, that was indestructible \u2014 and learned to distinguish between sloe leaves and the Chinese herb, and sdk ribands or ribands three-fourths cotton. Bishop, on his part, grew more composed and more in-"], [169, "157 TID AND HER HUSBAND TO THE RESCUE. different to smoking, as a representative man, representing Tid as well as himself, and as used to Tid's indulgence. By the time Bishop should wreath curls of smoke over a cradle, shoulder a baby, and be impelled to take the com mand of a nursery-maid and a perambulator, he would be as steady as a rock under so much ballast, and the next thing to defiant, under so much immunity, until he rallied girls like a brother, and rebuked them like a father. It was a fine autumn down at Richmond to those who did not consider that there might be too much of a good thing. Miss Blount, who leant to strong-minded teaching in galleries and museums, and above all, to great draughts of fresh air on Richmond Hill, Hounslow Heath, and Wimbledon Common, came often to tell Tid what Bishop's smoking would bring him to, and to beg her to join the feast on the heath, or the common, or the hill, where Miss Blount allowed the girls their fill of berries or cresses to their bread and milk ; but no narcotics, under pain of her vengeance, not even tea or coffee. Miss Blount was constantly preaching that, unless they had thunder and rain soon, there would be influenza \u2014 that British version of cholera in the spring. But no one minded Miss Blount any more than the Government Commission or Common Council mind the Jeremiahs who forbode that we shall have black or yellow death at home one of these days, if we won't look sharp and clean filthy Father Thames. It was a fine autumn, with huge walnuts and the tawny-leaved grapes bearing purple clusters on open air brick walls, when there arose a sough of people laid down with sore throat, an un-English sore throat, under which the strength sank almost without pain in a night, or held out for days and weeks with the strange leather like fungus, growing, spreading, unbroken by all the doctor's efforts, until the death-rattle sounded, and the patient was gone where there was no need of healing. In one day both Miss Hibberd and Miss Charlotte were seized with the epidemic. Miss Hibberd acknowledged to falling ill, and predicted the nature of the ailment. Miss Charlotte wandered about trying to obey orders and look ing for more, with feverish distended eyes, till Miss Hibberd stopped in the middle of a speech, stared at her sister, said directly, \" Miss Charlotte has got the sore"], [170, "158 A SWEET PEA. throat also, look at it, doctor.\" And Miss Charlotte's throat was found the more fungus-grown of the two. Then the sisters faltered for a moment till it occurred to Miss Hibberd that it might be better there should be no survivor ; the two had so long done their work in company, there was some comfort in dying together. The school was the first thing to be thought of in their grow ing helplessness \u2014 the children, and other people's children, committed to them : of course they must be sent home immediately. There would be a difficulty in gathering the school together again, and they were not rich, Miss Hibberd reflected with a sigh ; but sufficient for the day was the evil thereof : it was probable there would be no more need of collecting the girls so far as the Miss Hibberds were concerned. The greatest difficulty was about the children from India, and those whose residences were at a distance : while the winter day was shortening, and Miss Hibberd was feeling more and more poorly, and Miss Charlotte was forced to lie down already ! Miss Hibberd could not be too thankful that Tid was there, with Mr. Bishop coming presently, they would not mind seeing the girls to the railway station ; Miss Blount called also, and came in for a second, though it was an infected house. \" My dear Miss Hibberd, I have no fear of infection, I never had, you know. I believe it is a delusion ; at least, it is nothing save bad air, and that is pretty general over the country. Read Florence Nightingale's ' Notes on Nursing,' if you don't credit me. Let me take the girls. Where is the use of sending them home, spreading infec tion, if there is infection ? Catching their deaths of sudden panic, fatigue, and cold, a great deal more likely. I have been so particular about space and air in Park Terrace that I can accommodate double my number upon a pinch with open windows \u2014 open windows, Miss Hibberd.\" \" Miss Blount, yon are a lady, you are a good woman, and a friend in need,\" said Miss fiibberd huskily throuo-h her poor throat. \" But who is to teach all the girls ? You have thirty, twenty of mine would be fifty. Fifty girls without teaching and discipline, like fifty soldiers without fighting or drill, they would get into harm or fall ill at once.\""], [171, "TID AND HER HUSBAND TO THE RESCUE. 159 \" I will teach them if Miss Blount will permit me,\" said Mr. Bishop, stepping forward. \" I will get up in the morning and take them before and after my filled-up hours : I can manage girls without help since I have been obliged to manage Tid.\" Tid did not smile as he had expected, standing close to him, and stealing a cold shaking hand into his ; her round dimpled face was very pale, her dewy Hps dry. \" Good heavens, Tid, you are not ill ! \" he cried, putting out his hand to puU her to the door, and betraying panic instantaneously. \" Not at all,\" said Tid, rousing herself ; \" and I will stay with the Miss Hibberds.\" \" Out of the question, child,\" Miss Hibberd was quite fit to proclaim ; \" you must go with your husband, and besides there can be no communication between my house and Miss Blount's.\" \"For myself, I should not mind as to communication,\" protested Miss Blount ; \" but I am afraid if we are to have any peace we must yield a Httle to the popular pre judice.\" \" I cannot allow it, Tid,\" said Bishop in a loud voice, dying away as he ended and caught Tid's eye. \"Yes, you will allow me, Bishop,\" she said, resolutely. \" Come and speak to me,\" and she took him aside. \" Are you tired of life, Tid \u2014 are you tired of me ? \" he cried, distractedly. \" You are not in a fit state to under take the sacrifice, and it is not required.\" \" No, it is voluntary,\" she said. \" Would it keep me safe from death to refuse to enter the dark valley when my friends pass through ? I tell you I must go with them, Bishop, and if I have a double life I shall have double care. Oh ! Bishop, Bishop, were they idle words spoken eighteen centuries ago, about loving father or mother, husband or wife, or child, more than Him, and not being worthy of Him ? \" \"We have been so happy, Tid,\" groaned Bishop. Oh! the mortal misery, the tender human misery of that groan. \" Now, Bishop, hear me. I am not going to wander, I am not light in the head, but I have been thinking of one of the girls' Scotch songs which the papas like better than the operas ; and this is it \u2014"], [172, "160 A SWEET PEA. ' She's gi'en me meat, she's gi'en me claes, She's been my comfort a' my days, I dare na leave my mammy.' The Miss Hibberds gave me meat and claes when I could hardly earn them, they helped us, or we could not have come together, or having come together, you, poor fellow, would have been harassed to death with care. Though we are in a Protestant country, we are not fond of married women in situations in England, yet the Miss Hibberds have kept me on in my situation. So, Bishop, I dare not leave the poor, good Miss Hibberds after aU they have done for you and me.\" \" But how can I be separated from you, Tid ? I cannot bear it.\" \" Yes, dear Bishop, I'll tell you how I will help you. Come night and morning to the end of Lavender Lane, where you will see the house and Miss Hibberd's window. I shall hang out my red shawl, the shawl you used to know me by at a distance, you remember ? That will show you I am well. If ever you do not see the shawl, then you have my leave to come on and enter the house, and stay with me and take care of me, my dear, dear fellow. I know you would not mind giving up your classes, letting everything take its chance, and running any risk yourself ; and neither Miss Blount, nor the Miss Hibberds would wish to separate man and wife in these circumstances. But I will not be smitten ; you heard what Miss Blount said about infection, and people Hke me are never smitten.\" There was heroism in the poor girl's hysterical speech (she was as calm as a judge the moment her husband left her). There was heroism in Bishop's going with his heart clutched by terror and leaving Tid to do her duty in the jaws of death. It must have warmed the old hearts and nerved the old frames in the danger that they were running. There were few things more touching than Tid's watch ing by her old friends' sick beds, giving them their medicines and cordials, carrying inquiries and messao-es from the one to the other, reading to them, writinc for them, solacing them in every way. She restored the courage of the frightened servants ; the fat cook and the"], [173, "161 TID AND HER HUSBAND TO THE RESCUE. grenadiers of housemaids and laundry-maids, who had not a tithe of the moral endurance of small-sized Tid. The domestics had been nearly beside themselves, and they one and all declared that, though they would not have deserted their mistresses and left them to \" them hospital nurses,\" they would have begun each one to feel a lump in her own throat as big as an egg and as black as a plum, if it had not been for \" that 'ere dear, clever, pretty young Mrs. Bishop,\" whom they had all known, \" Miss Farren as was,' and who stayed with them, and went so softly up and down stairs, and spoke so cheerily, and came out and took her meals as religiously, and sensibly, and thankfully as an old woman, bless her dear heart ! and she a young wife in a delicate situation, separated from her husband as doted on the ground she walked on, and confined to the dismalest sick-rooms in the world. If there was a thing more than another that went to the heart like a clasp knife, as the fat cook, who loved a figure of speech, ex pressed it, it was to see young Mrs. Bishop hanging out that old red shawl of hers as a sign to her husband. That old red shawl of Tid's which had figured gloriously in Christmas charades, which had been familiar to Bishop as a lover, how little she had dreamt that it would serve as a flag of hope to Bishop when they were quite an old married couple ! She had imagined that she might wrap her baby in it in default of something less venerable, and had said to herself that her baby would be none the worse for being carried about in a shawl that had belonged to its grandmother ; but never that it should be a signal of life and health, and of a fair day on the morrow, like the red in the summer sunset, to the baby's father. Tid would unfurl the shawl and stand for a few minutes at the half open window, with the wind blowing her hair, straining her eyes, as if she could see Bishop yonder, beyond the acacias, where the lamps began to twinkle, and then she would clasp her hands, and whether she prayed for the Miss Hibberds, or herself, or Bishop, or her unborn baby \u2014 for women have strange fancies and gleams of second sight \u2014 it was a sweet soul that prayed, and Heaven heard. Poor Bishop's heart would be thumping like a steam engine, so that he could not smoke a single puff after the day's hard routine, when he reached the end of Lavender M"], [174, "162 A SWEET PEA. Lane, and came in sight of the banner, blood-red, like that of the Moravian nuns of Bethlehem. He would take off his hat when he caught the first glimpse of it ; he might be praying, too : the prayer of as honest and brave a heart as ever beat in a breast exposed to shot and steel. Poor Bishop did more than venture his own heart, he ventured his heart's darling, and his heart's peace for the future. \" Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have give I thee.\" Once he was there full three minutes before the red shawl was shaken out, and he got so sick, blind, and dizzy that he had to lean against an area railing. When he came to himself, the shawl was blushing, like the warm blood of life and the roses of June against the old yellow brick house, and a policeman's hand was on his arm. \" Young man,\" said the guardian of society, \" this here behavour is more than I can put up with. I have seen you awatching of that same house every night I have come upon my beat this week. If you are only a moon shiny lovyer, such as one reads of or sees at the Surrey, it is no business of mine ; but you must have done with the trick, because if you happens to have burglarious intentions, I'm blowed if I'm not answerable for allowing all this spying, without reporting you to my inspector, and having you up at the office.\" The red shawl was now fluttering freely, and Bishop, who was wont to tremble before school-girls, smiled broadly in the stern face of his captor. \" Policeman X.,\" he said, \" I am looking out for a token from my wife, and there it is. She is yonder, and I cannot get near her, for she is nursing two sick ladies ill with diphtheria, a disease as infectious as the typhus, and we dare not come together to compromise other lives besides our own.\" Policeman X.'s grasp relaxed, and his countenance changed from that of a man of stone to that of a man of flesh and blood, a family-man himself, with a pet little daughter. \"I beg your pardon, sir; that is a different matter. If you are coming down upon me with a story,\" he said the next moment, to make up for his weakness, \" I'll come down upon you, swift and sure, before we drop our acquaintance. But I believe you are speakinc. the truth,\" relenting a second time, \" and I wish your wife and her friends well through their sickness. Good evening, sir.\""], [175, "163 TID AND HER HUSBAND TO THE RESCUE. The epidemic had exhausted itself. The Miss Hibberds lived, and did not die. Tid was a true prophet, and never took the diphtheria, and probably, by her kind constancy, saved her neighbours from the infliction. It is needless to say how blissful was the reunion between husband and wife in the lodging at Clapham ; how cordial were Miss Blount, the Miss Hibberds, Bishop, and Tid, when they all met again ; how Bishop and Tid were promoted to the most honourable posts ; and how Bishop's name and fame as a capital fellow and an excellent teacher rose, till Tid taught no more unless when she taught her little chddren, but stayed at home, and was fully occupied in taking care of her bright suburban house and garden, and of her friends, young and old, rich and poor ; and lastly, how Bishop and Tid could never look at that old red rag of a shawl without the water coming into their eyes, to their dying day."], [176, "LONDON PRIDE. (EM'S FIRST AND LAST LODGER.) CHAPTER I. SET A THIEF TO CATCH A THIEF. Em was the niece of the vicar of Dutton-on-the-Hill, and the daughter of the late master of the grammar-school of Friar's Lynn, so that she and her mother had come des perately down in the world when they started to let lodg ings in the wilderness of London. They had been warned against the proceeding, too, and impressed with the fact that to go up among the lodging-letters and takers of the capital of Christian England, the metropolis of British industry, integrity, and police arrangements, was more infallibly to fall among thieves than ever had been a journey between Jerusalem and Jericho. But an obliga tion was upon the women to make money at this time ; they knew no other way of making it, and they were rash and headstrong \u2014 woman-like. Up to London travelled Mrs. Rashleigh and her daughter Em, a little staggered and daunted, to confess the truth by the very exercise of their independence, but they outgrew the strange feeling, and outgrew the terrible bewilderment and whirl of the first transfer from the ingenuous, conceited, deliberate march of life at Friar's Lynn, to the reticent, unscrupulous rush of life in Lon don. They boldly hired a house in quite the genteel rural locality of Camden Town to one class of Londoners, but"], [177, "165 SET A THIEF TO CATCH A THIEF. to a Friar's Lynnian in her primitive freshness, a district very brick-and-mortary and railway-ridden, with the names of Primrose Hill and of St. John's Wood beyond \u2014 special satires. The Rashleighs fitted themselves with a strapping servant of all work, so wise in London life compared to themselves, that she was an object of mystery and awe even to Em, who had a pretty little spirit of her own. They put into their windows cards of lodgings to let, and sat down breathlessly to await the lodger that fate would send them. He came in a few days, taking away what breath they had left by his promptness. He was a tall, brown, erect young man, with a broad frowning forehead, a mouth so hidden by a moustache that it was lost to expression, and shining, challenging, imperative eyes. He alighted from a cab, but kept it prudently at the door, with his luggage \u2014 a large travelling trunk, marked with a number in addi tion to the initials of a name, and a strong dressing-case. He walked over the two bright clean little rooms on the first floor, where the smoke-flecks and dust-motes con tinually gathering already filled Mrs. Rashleigh with dis may, in three minutes, asked the terms, and cut short Mrs. Rashleigh in extending them endlessly, \" I will take the lodgings ; bid the man bring up my things,\" \u2014 and within half an hour he was seated before a writing-case on the table in the parlour, with the door shut on him. In the mean time Mrs. Rashleigh went into a succession of tremors \u2014 about the lodger's being a man, aud about their being unprotected females, and the man at the tavern opposite not looking for customers in them and not over friendly ; a young man, and her Em not over twenty ; above all, about her having neglected, in the excitement of the moment, to give and require references. Her agitation threatened to spoil her share of the relief and congratulation expressed by Em at their having made so soon a beginning, and secured a lodger \u2014 the nucleus of innumerable, inoffensive, solvent, permanent lodgers ; she did not want to spoil Em's satisfaction, and being a woman who always needed to be led by the nose, she consulted her grenadier servant Sarah Anne on her qualms. \" Lawks, ma'am, you mustn't be so petiklar,\" was Sarah Anne's encouragement, \" petiklariness ain't the quality to"], [178, "166 LONDON PRIDE. make the cart go in London \" (and in practical illustra tion of her maxim Sarah Anne was caught making up to the dog's meat man, not to say coquetting outrageously with the vendor of the penny Times, the Mo-o-ning Star, and the Chronicle, as well as receiving attentions at un lawful hours from a soldier in undress uniform at her window). \"I takes it, they won't ax his name and nation at any of the lodgings over the way. My last missus had one of the swell mob in her rooms for six months, a quiet gentleman, and very civil ; paid his money reglar ; when he went out at nights was supposed to be at his club ; and when he was caught and had to appear at the Old Bailey and get transported, was as sorry as a gentleman could be to hinjure the character of our house \u2014 though I allurs said that were his misfortune not his fault, leastways, the being taken weren't.\" An enlightenment which caused the spikes of Mrs. Rashleigh's hair to stand on end under her false braids. Thus, therefore, were Mrs. Rashleigh and Em started with a lodger whose very name they did not know, for he had not given it, and they, poor creatures, did not like to ask it, particularly when Sarah Anne horrified them farther by suggesting, with a knowing nod, that he was conceaHng it for a purpose ; he was come to lie quiet for a while, no doubt, and least said soonest mended. \" If they knowed nothing, in course nothing could come out when they were taken to the court and badgered by them horrid brutes of lawyers ; \" which had been Sarah Anne's experience more than once in her eventful life. The Rashleighs did not know their lodger's name, nor did they know his profession, or if he had a profession, though they felt that he ought to be a radway gentleman, or a teacher in St. John's Wood, or a clerk in a lawyer's office. He busied himself with books and papers during the short space in the twenty-four hours that he was in his lodging. But the books Mrs. Rashleigh classed in surprised contempt with children's books, containing plates of the \" Hundred Animals \" and hundreds added to them, such as she would have put out of her Cuthbert's reach for distracting his attention from his Latin and Greek, and so angering her poor father, from the time that her son was a little lad of twelve. As for the writing, it did not look Hke school exer-"], [179, "167 SET A THIEF TO CATCH A THIEF. cises or lawyers' papers, with which Mrs. Rashleigh fancied that she was equally familiar in the shape of themes from advanced pupils, and valuation lists and deeds of lease. The stranger wore clean linen and used a tooth-brush. He rang for his coffee (he needed no shaving water) before the rest of the street was stirring, and if it were not taken up to him instantly he rang again with a quick, sharp reverberation which caused Mrs. Rashleigh to jump in her own room. He was not troublesome, except in this matter of immediate attendance. He struck Mrs. Rashleigh at once, from the way in which he stowed away his small property, set to rights the gas-jet and the window-blind, and put out of the way and drew out for his convenience the leaves of the table, as an extremely handy man con trasted with the dreamy, helpless, irritable scholar she had been accustomed to. But he appeared to expect, as Em described it, to be served by Genii, would brook not the smallest delay, and gave his orders in a style brief, electric, thrilling, as if he had been used to send them by a telegraph wire and to have them met with implicit, unquestioning obedience. As far as his landladies knew, their lodger lived temperately, even sparingly, breakfasting on coffee and toast, sometimes telling them over night to prepare a steak or a cutlet for him ; but rejecting bacon, eggs \u2014 above all, Sarah Anne's prawns and shrimps, gene rally stale, flat, and unprofitable, before they reached the fishmonger's in the Rashleighs' street \u2014 with a single, once for all, blank shot of \"No.\" He had tea at an hour unheard-of for lateness down at Friar's Lynn, tea pure and simple, and he dispensed with supper. The smallness of his appetite launched Mrs. Rashleigh on a new sea of apprehension. Was it the effect of conscience, or of galloping consumption ? Should she find him dead in bed one morning, a prey to remorse, or to an empty stomach, and be forced to suffer a coroner's inquest in her house ? But Sarah Anne was ready with the consolation that he dined abroad, where he might lay in a stock of meat and drink of the best to last him for the next twelve hours, as it was well known that men were Hke dogs, and only cared for one meal a day, and went and took it by themselves behind women's backs, that they might \" stuff and swill like swines.\""], [180, "168 LONDON PE1DE. Sarah Anne had the most communication with the lodger, as she waited upon him ; and when she continued to give out that he was a \" deep un,\" and that the least said was soonest mended, even Mrs. Rashleigh compre hended that he had proved too much for their experienced, armed-at-all-points maid of all work. Sarah Anne had only made out two trifling details. The stranger's linen was marked \" B. H.,\" \" and I lays a week's wages,\" commented Sarah Anne on this item, \"the B is for Bill or Ben, and the H may stand for Hummins, or Hogarty, or Hair, since I have knowed men of them names.\" But here Mrs. Rashleigh had the satisfaction of refuting the assertion of her accomplished handmaid. \" No, Sarah Anne, it is for Hatchard \u2014 Mr. Basil Hatchard, I had it from himself ; that is to say he signed it to the week's bill which Miss Rashleigh made out, so there is no mistake.\" \" No, marm, not on your part,\" replied Sarah Anne readily, \" a halias could not come from you.\" The second point was that he walked away of a morning and returned of an evening, keeping the same direction to and from Regent's Park. A private detective could not have made more of Mr. Hatchard's habits without dogging his footsteps ; and to have dogged the erect, athletic, ex tremely in earnest, with no-nonsense-about-him young man, minus a warrant, would have demanded a little con fidence and courage. Mr. Hatchard, alias or not, brought to his lodging no friend or acquaintance who might have supplied the miss ing clue to his pursuits. On the one or two occasions when he was out in the evenings he announced previously, with no show of carii_\u00a3 whether it scandalized his land ladies or not, that he would be absent till late in the night. And when Sarah Anne, ignoring his latch-key, was pointed in sitting up for him, it struck that excellent jttdge that the most ominous particular in the circumstance was that he always returned in good condition. \" He took care never to forget hisself.\" However, Mrs. Rashleigh and Em were incapable of weighing the momentum of this sentence. In their un sophisticated ignorance they cast it into the opposite scale when they considered that the remaining out once in three"], [181, "169 SET A THIEF TO CATCH A THIEF. weeks or so was the only suspicious irregularity which occurred in their lodger's unexceptional conduct \u2014 that and his wearing on these occasions when the evenings were dark and cold, a somewhat outre (for a civilian) picturesque cloak or cape, lined with red, and a cap with a faded gold band. Mr. Hatchard never put a single inquiry to the Rash leighs having a local reference, or looked at a solitary time-table, or alluded to a 'bus honoured with his patron age, which could afford an indication of his engagements. He acted as if he knew London ten thousand times better than they did ; which was highly probable. There was no doubt that the speedy acquisition of their lodger, like the immediate fulfilment of many wishes, was not a good to the Rashleighs without its alloy. The women, who knew everybody not only in Friar's Lynn but in the neighbouring parish of Dutton-on-the-Hill, had admitted an unknown man under their roof. In the early stage of their connection he infected them with the small- ness of his appetite without the compensation of private dinners at eating-houses, where only waiters beheld, kept their own counsel, and never turned king's evidence. He robbed them of sleep, so that they might, without incon- venience, have sat up and watched the locked door of the room where he slept the sleep of the just, or the hardened. The minds of Mrs. Rashleigh and Em were worked on to the degree that they could have wished him, sooner than anything worse, an actor in the Marylebone (a supposition \u25a0 obtaining a colouring from his air, and his cloak ; but then he did not speak to himself, and the Marylebone must be open oftener than once in three weeks \u2014 rather he had need to belong to the troop of some extraordinarily early and intermittent circus), or a gentleman connected with the Foundling. But if he were a doctor, no patients called him out, and he kept no drugs on the premises. But where does familiarity not breed contempt ? Mrs. Rashleigh and Em, finding in time that their lodger neither robbed nor murdered them nor their neighbours, waxed familiar with then' danger \u2014 prophesied to them before they had quitted Friar's Lynn. They accepted their position ; grew reconciled to Mr. Hatchard and his incognito ; and rapidly progressed into putting entire faith"], [182, "170 LONDON PRIDE. in him, though really they knew no more of him than at the beginning. Sarah Anne, indeed, preferred to retain her dark surmises \u2014 not dark, merely high-coloured to her ; but her mistresses no longer paid heed to her. Mrs. Rashleigh and Em had settled between them that \" he \"\u25a0 \u2014 the he of their retired, concentrated life \u2014 was in a Government office. What could make him wander so far from Somerset House or the Post Office as Camden Street, or what department of the public service he presided over, they left conveniently vague. But Em could almost see the tall, athletic, stiffish figure nailed to a high stool, look ing down on and dictating, in briefest words, to a staff of deferential junior clerks. Em even began to think the scarlet-lined cloak becoming, and to recall that Basil was an ancient saint's name and the name of a fragrant herb sure to bring good luck. Only two additional bits of evidence \u2014 one of them, cer tainly, of a nature so tremendously sensational on the first blush, as to produce, for an interval, a new panic equal to, rather greater than the first \u2014 shook their recovered faith and disturbed their happy serenity. Mr. Hatchard persisted in not only entertaining himself with the modern edition of the \" Hundred Animals,\" and in poring over those unmanly studies, but in executing care ful drawings and water-colour paintings of bird and beast, and of organs of bird and beast, of all descriptions, from an eagle's beak to a wild cat's claw. Mrs. Rashleigh and Em could not realize a drawing master who confined him self to teaching animal drawing ; besides, Mr. Hatchard's productions did not go, even to uninitiated eyes, beyond bold rudimentary attempts. But the really appalling discovery had its rise in a habit of Mrs. Rashleigh's. Like many people capable of spend ing magnificently on occasions, the widow was full of small savings. One of her infinitude of harmless economies was to gather and hoard the waste paper of the household, in order to tear it up and twirl it round into matches at odd twilight moments, employing herself profitably, as she fondly flattered herself, when other people were idle, and turning to use what other people had cast away \u2014 killing two birds with one stone. She was thus occupied when she ought to have been keeping blind man's holiday with"], [183, "SET A THIEF TO CATCH A THIEF. 171 Em, sitting by the parlour fire, when Em took up one of the slips of paper arranged elaborately on her mother's lap, and with a careless observation, \" That is not from one of our Cuthbert's letters, mamma,\" read the line of large, strong, legible handwriting, altogether distinct from Cuthbert's uncertain, unstable scrawl. Em opened her clear eyes wide as she read ; winked ; emphatically re-opened her eyes, and re-read the slip, with a rush and retreat of colour from her rounded, rose-tinted face. Then she panted, and burst out with the exclama tion before she had thought whether it might not be ex pedient to conceal the revelation from her widowed mother, who was timid, and a little given to reminding Em that she was a widowed mother : \"Why, where on earth did you get this writing, mamma ? \" She was forced to read it aloud after that question ; and when she had delivered, in a quavering voice, the terrible communication, \" he tore his mate limb from limb,\" and had turned over the paper and found that it formed part of a letter addressed in another hand to \" B. Hatchard, Esq.,\" mother and daughter looked at each other aghast. \" What shall we do with it, Em ? \" inquired Mrs. Rashleigh faintly, wringing her hands as she leapt to a conclusion. \"Is it possible that we shall be taken to a court, as Sarah Anne says ? Oh dear, dear ! your uncle Jeremy will never forget or forgive it ; but I shall not be here to see, for I know I shall not survive the exposure. But if we keep this terrible morsel of paper out of sight \u2014 goodness, gracious me ! I wish I had not picked it out of the dust-box this morning \u2014 we may become art and part in a murder, if we are not part already by harbouring an accomplice. It wdl ruin my boy Cuthbert's prospects, after all we have done, and all your father looked forward to. Ah ! poor, poor papa ! to think that his wife and his little Em should come to such grief at last.\" \"Mamma,\" said Em, after knitting her forehead hard for a few minutes in profound meditation, looking up with a lightened face, \" I should not wonder if we are frighten ing and vexing ourselves without the shadow of a cause, and we shall be laughing at ourselves to-morrow. Of course, it would be absurd to credit anything else. Think how efficient the police are, and how openly he lives. Mate"], [184, "172 LONDON PRIDE. is a seafaring phrase,\" Em argued, arbitrarily ignoring the primary meaning of the word, \" and I am convinced that he has not been a sailor ; he does not roll in his gait, or chew tobacco, or tie his neckerchief like Tom Greene. If the worst were to come to the worst, it is ' he,' not ' I,' of whom he has written down that he tore his mate limb from limb. No, do not shudder, mamma ; though the expres-ion is horribly suggestive, depend upon it he has only been copying the account of some shocking mutiny, or encounter of sailors and South Sea Islanders before they were converted, such as Uncle Jeremy lectured upon in the Dutton-on-the-Hill school-house last year. There is really no ground for suspicion ; it is very wrong to suspect a man on such a trifle,\" dogmatized Em, all the more severe in youthful righteousness, because it was she who had first aroused the suspicion. \" We have never seen anything in him but what suits with the behaviour of a respectable member of society, and a well conducted young man. And don't you remember, mamma, you said that he was as gentleman-like as the young barristers who were wont, in your day, to come over at the assize time from Middlefield to Friar's Lynn ? I take shame to myself for having put such a cruelly scandalous, ridiculous notion into your head.\" \" I rather think notions, as you call them, come into your mother's head without your help ; I rather think that they came there before you were here \u2014 in this world, I mean,\" Mrs. Rashleigh objected with irony, highly and huffily, in the middle of her distress. \" Notion or no notion, it is a fine thing for us two, including Sarah Anne, to be shut up, without a word against it, every night of our lives, in the house with a man about whom there is so awful a doubt \u2014 Cuthbert's not knowing a word about it, and Sarah Anne, perhaps, not knowing how to spring a police man's rattle for us, clever as she is, if there were such a thing about.\" \" Of course you know best, mamma,\" submitted Em, more considerately ; \" but if I were you I would not say anything about this bit of writing, which we ought not to have seen, to Sarah Anne. She is sufficiently set up and flighty, what you call hoighty-toighty, you understand, mamma, as it is ; and I would not tell Cub, and cost him"], [185, "173 SET A THIEF TO CATCH A THIEF. the expense of coming up to town, and the breaking in on his preparations for the examination, what he describes as 'going in for the little go.' I would venture, with neigh bours all around, coming and going at all hours of the dark night (there are such queer hours of work, and such queer trades to serve at in London) \u2014 I don't imagine it is much of a venture, \u2014 rather than speak away a man's character for a scrap of paper picked up out of a dust-box. How should we like it were our Cuthbert the man, mamma ? I am sure he often writes wild enough stories about other men's boating, boxing, riding after harriers, holding vermin parties, and having street rows. I declare, mamma, we could be taken before a court for this very thing \u2014 defama tion of character ; and serve us right, too, if Mr. Hatchard is innocent.\" Under the mingled inducements set forth so urgently, Mrs. Rashleigh consented with difficulty to forego further investigation of the fragment which had come to light, \" so Hke a Providence,\" as the old lady would have it. But not only her heart, but the much more reasonable heart of Em, palpitated fast and thick of nights for a week to come at every unexpected movement which was made in Mr. Hatchard's quarter of the house, and at every stranger who pulled the door-bell. Still, when nothing came of the discovery, the impres sion of it died out in nine diys, and it had no effect on the Rashleighs' estimation of their lodger, unless in a secret sense of shame for their fears on Mrs. Rashleigh's and Em's minds, which wedded them more stubbornly to their previous opinion. Men, and particularly women, do not do things by halves ; Mrs. Rashleigh and Em were now very nearly as firmly convinced of Mr. Hatchard's rank and respectability as a Government clerk, as that Cub would take a double first, in his university, at last. The Rashleighs' next trouble had an origin somewhat varied. Sarah Anne, that Admirable Crichton among maids of all work, had to do with it. Sarah Anne's morals could not stand the temptation of having two mistresses, who, however notable as a housekeeper and however intelligent and quick-witted as a young girl in the country, were totally ignorant of the wdes of Satan among maids of all work in London."], [186, "174 LONDON PRIDE. Sarah Anne had broken down, not in having followers and giving away the cold mutton, which might have happened in the most rural district, but in making sundry whimsical, irrelevant purchases, on her own account, in the family's name at the shops where Mrs. Rashleigh had her small accounts, and paid them religiously and fearfully every month, \u2014 an antediluvian, premature anticipation of the quarter, which brought about the summary detection of Sarah Anne's little liberty. Mrs. Rashleigh would have paid the imposition, and positively and in horror refused the intervention of the law, supposing Sarah Anne had refused to go away peace ably ; but it had not come to that, since Sarah Anne had left, with a little effusion, on the very morning before the explanation. That was on a Monday ; and on the Sunday preceding Sarah Anne had stayed out so far beyond the bounds of propriety, that had it not been for Em, Mrs. Rashleigh would have been guilty of the enormity of ask ing the first floor to open the area gate for the delinquent. For somehow Sarah Anne had mislaid her key, and was so conspicuous and noisy, with her sky-blue shawl all awry, and her pale pink feather nodding irregularly, lamenting her loss, that she had collected a crowd of small boys on the pavement, whom it was dreadful for ladies from the country to face on a Sunday evening, even before it was patent to the most unsuspicious spectators, as well as to the grinning master of the tavern over the way, that Sarah Anne was in a state of helpless intoxication. Yet, in justice to Sarah Anne, it must be said that she showed a sense of self-respect, and some regard for her mistresses' feelings. She was not outrageous in her cups, she stumbled to bed and hid her weakness almost as fast as could be desired. In the morning she was not impudent in vociferating that she had been falsely accused, and in indulging in unlimited railing. She was resigned and imperturbable, and departed on the payment of her wages without waiting for the exposure of her peculations. She only said coolly that she counted on her mistresses defend ing her against the spiteful lies of \" them mean screws of shopkeepers,\" and on their giving her a character when she applied for it, and that it went to her heart to be forced to quit a couple of innocents and to have to turn them over a prey to \" wicious parties.\""], [187, "175 SET A THIEF TO CATCH A THIEF. Notwithstanding Sarah Anne's obliging thoughtfulness for the Rashleighs, the smartness with which she had to walk off the stage at Camden Town involved her mistresses in one of those minor fretting worries which women Hke them \u2014 domestic, sensitive, haunted by traditions \u2014 scared by men's claims to superiority, suffer from, often, more than from great stunning worldly trials. An uninitiated person would have been apt to dispose of the difficulty and its solution in a trice, as : Given Sarah Anne gone \u2014 to find another Sarah Anne. But the real question was where to find her, or into what slough might not Mrs. Rashleigh and Em fall by another unlucky choice ? They did cherish a hope of bringing up an unsophisticated, un corrupted Sarah Anne from the fresh green fields of Friar's Lynn \u2014 a Sarah Anne all but faultless, seeing that a charity-school girl's most heinous enormities were picking at muffins, dabbing at tea-cakes, and imprinting black fingers on white table-linen. But even if Mrs. Rashleigh and Em could feel themselves justifiable in seducing a lamb from the safe fold of Friar's Lynn, to which they themselves looked back yearningly from the smoky outskirts of that furnace in which solitary, self-dependent men and women are melted and remoulded as in a crucible, the act would be a work of time, and of elaborate calculation of expenses. The Friar's Lynn charity-school Sarah Anne could not be brought up to London at a moment's notice by a wag of the finger. Then Mrs. Rashleigh's finances were not in a flourishing condition. The promising advent of the first floor had not, as had been rashly counted on, proved the immediate precursor of back parlours and second floors. All things considered, with many pangs and misgivings, the Rashleighs determined to try and do with a charwoman for the present, Mr. Hatchard needed so little attendance beyond what that accommodating irresponsible matron could render ; and for the rest, Mrs. Rashleigh and Em could wait on themselves. But great was the mortification \u2014 all the sorer to the widow of sixty, that she was as sensitive as a girl of fifteen, and the qualm lest after all she should be letting her Cuthbert down while she was spending every penny that she had, and humiliating herself, and what was worse. Em, to earn more to serve him, by his mother's sinking into"], [188, "176 LONDON PRIDE. a menial capacity. On that first morning Mrs. Rashleigh threw her silk shawl round her shoulders, and drew on her old-fashioned black mittens, as if to qualify matters, and in reply to Mr. Hatchard's ring for breakfast, took the tray with his coffee and toast from Em, where Em had con veyed it to the very threshold of his door. She carried it in to the sultan, wished him good morning, and hoped that he had slept well, with no more encouragement than an astonished abrupt \"Yes.\" She arranged the window blinds, which he had wrenched up so as to flood the room with light and glare, fetched his letters and newspapers, and requested him to mention the hour at which he would be in to tea (of course he could not tell) lest his tea should be too much drawn. And all the time the poor woman was thinking, with a choking in her throat, how she had done the same things for the late master of Friar's Lynn, thousands of times, and how she would do the same for Cuthbert with the greatest pride in the deed, but to do them for a strange man for money, not love, was something different. Mrs. Rashleigh came out of the ordeal flurried and overcome. That was only natural, seeing that she was a nervous woman liable to feel low after any effort for which she had braced herself. But when she had shed a few tears and begged Em not to speak of what she had had to do ; they were all made of dust, miserable sinners, and deserved to have falls, and to be humbled, as her uncle Jeremy had often told her \u2014 no, let them speak of dear kind peaceful old Friar's Lynn and be comforted \u2014 it did seem a little unnatural that Em could not bring her mother round to the subject again. It was impossible, even after Mrs. Rashleigh was calmed down ; Em could not draw from her mother the particulars which Em was pricked with curiosity to learn, in the dearth of incident and intercourse in these women's lives hovering on the brink of the great eventful London, where they did not know a soul save the curate of their parish, and he was a busy man, and could only afford them a call once in three months. Then in place of its being \"but the first step which cost \" in Mrs. Rashleigh's experience, the next day she was still hotter and colder, and shakier and more depressed by her exertions, and remained altogether unwillin\"- to enter"], [189, "SET A THIEF TO CATCH A THIEF. 177 into the details of her interview with her lodger. The third day her courage and constancy broke down, and out it all came in a rush \u2014 the latent insult, the wounded feel ings, the bootless resentment of the late master of the grammar-school of Friar's Lynn's widow, as she sank down in a chair in her parlour and sobbed back to the soothing caresses and eager kisses of her daughter, \" The man thinks me a thief, Em, he thinks us all thieves ; I saw it in the way that he turned his shoulder, and told me he wanted no extras when I proposed mushroom sauce to his steak. I heard it in the tone of his voice when he bade me let alone his tea-caddy, he preferred to lock the cabinet, and keep the key himself. Oh ! Em, Em, if he misses any thing, or makes the smallest mistake in his housekeeping \u2014 and men, the cleverest of them, are such wretched house keepers \u2014 he will think that we took it, and blame us. I wish, I wish I had never entered on this dreadful way of life. How could Mrs. Stapleton, who has always the curates at Friar's Lynn, deceive me and tell me that it was a Hght genteel mode of making one's bread ? \u2014 but they must have treated her civilly, for one of the curates married her daughter Alexa. And you were a great deal better educated than Alexa Stapleton, Em, child, and might have gone out as a governess if you would have left your poor mother. In that case, I dare say your uncle Jeremy might have had interest to help you, had he chosen to exert it; and there was Sir William Baker, whose youngest son, little Dolph, was with your father for a short while, and Lady Baker always called for me very affably, and had me once to Brooklands to dine with your uncle and Dr. Jones, the family doctor, and his wife. I have often' told you of it, Em, and that I wore my olive-green corded silk, which was made down for you, and which you wore so long with a white jacket at church, and to little parties.

My boy Cuthbert, you little know what your mother has to bear for you.

He is gruff and ungracious, but he is a gentleman, and least of all would a gentleman insult you, serving him in your own house.\" \"I don't know, Em,\" argued Mrs. Rashleigh, shaking her head in a woe-begone manner at the youthful pride and incredulity of her daughter. \" I begin to be afraid that there are many people calling themselves ladies and gentlemen who would see no insult and no shame in suspecting for nothing a London lodging-house keeper. It is only considered knowing, looking sharp, and circum venting sharpers. I cannot tell if the regular lodging house keepers have deserved it, and if they are a class of complete swindlers, but it is very hard to suffer when you have come down in the world, and always borne the highest character with boarders' parents, and when your son is in the course of taking orders, and you have not done or dreamt of doing anything wrong.\" \"I don't believe it \u2014 I won't believe it. Mr. Hatchard must know better. We are trustworthy-looking women, I am sure : even a poor unprincipled girl Hke Sarah Anne recognized it.\" Em stood out stoutly. She asked nothing more than an opportunity of satisfying herself of the morbidness of her mother's sense of honour to persuade Mrs. Rashleigh that the offence was groundless. The opportunity was not long of presenting itself. Once in a fortnight Mrs. Rashleigh was in the habit of being prostrated with a sick headache ; and when this common event occurred in due time, not only was Mrs. Rashleigh incapable of waiting upon her enemy and the assailant of her integrity \u2014 she had to be waited upon herself. Then Em insisted that what her mother had done she could do without impropriety or degradation, nay, that she was glad to be allowed to do it that she might spy the land of their lodger's bearing, and prove her mother wrong. Thus Em, feeling proud, humble, dutiful, awkward, a little suspicious, a little tickled too, as lads and girls wiU be tickled in the midst of struggle, tribulation, and despair \u2014 Em, in obedience to the twanging tingle of Mr. Hatchard's beU, walked to his door, executed a precise little knock \u2014 slightly tremulous, and entered Mr. Hatchard's sitting-"], [191, "179 SET A THIEF TO CATCH A THIEF. room with his tray. She was a wonderfully pleasant, Hebe sort of figure (in spite of her black calico gown), which mourning, care, contest with the world, and London air, had not yet robbed of its health, its hope, its innate, aU pervading purity and blossoming-over simple cultivation and intelligence. The lodger with the frowning brow, the brown cheeks, the big beard, and the morning coat rougher than was customary in town, but which Em recognized as similar to the coats of squires and gentlemen farmers far away among the hayfields and the June roses of Friar's Lynn, was standing with his back to the empty grate, his draw ings of eastern elephants and tigers, and southern oxen with curiously twisted horns, arranged methodically on the side-table at his elbow. He stared as Em entered, not rudely in one sense, but with the unconcealed air of a person surprised and not well pleased. He went through no form of greeting before he asked, in his dry, short manner, without moving, \" Where is the landlady ? \" \" Mamma \u2014 Mrs. Rashleigh is ill, and I am her daughter,\" blundered and stammered Em, hating herself for blun dering and stammering, but unable to help feeling a little frightened, and with her heart rising into her throat, a weakness for which she hated herself still more fervently. She placed the tray, arranged cup, plate, and napkin. She would not fail in a single particular for the world. \" Do you want anything more, sir ? \" She made assurance doubly sure. \" No.\" He fired the negative at her so sharply, and she turned so quickly to the door, that the word might have struck her and be expediting her flight. \" Stop ! \" She stood still, arrested instantaneously, with the colour rush ing into her face and wavering there like the effect of shifting shadows of fast flitting clouds over a sunny land scape. \" When I ring again come back and clear the table. I shall work here to-day.\" He ended with an impatient gesture, as if he felt it an idle, unsuitable con fidence to mention his intentions. Em assented, though she did not think that he either expected or listened to her \" Yes,\" and she got out of the room. She was his servant, bound to obey his summons,"], [192, "180 LONDON PRIDE. and he had only given her his orders as plainly as possible. It was an unfortunate and silly assumption on the part of a lodging-house keeper that a lodger should distinguish when his landlady had seen better days', and had a son coming out for the Church still, and should go through the farce of regarding her as a poor lady, and of dealing gently with a dear, touchy, tender, broken-down old woman. It might sound chivalrous aud Christian, but then it was impracti cable. It must be a great trial on a lodger's patience to find himself in a famdy who reckoned themselves in reduced circumstances, and reproached him for not con sidering their fine feelings. Lodging-house keepers had no business with feelings, and all the world should conde scend to their trade. Em told herself these home truths with great candour, vigour, and volubility, as she busied herself during the quarter of an hour which sufficed Mr. Hatchard for his morning meal, and as she scorched her face toasting her mother's half-slice of bread to the most admirable crisp ness. It would not do to sit down and look at contrasts, and be sore and sulky. It would not do at all to be senti mental, it would never do to carry a report to her mother which would confirm Mrs. Rashleigh's distress and aggra vate her head to the last degree. Em must rate herself roundly, and scorn herself, and laugh at herself if she could ; then she would not be beaten by circumstances and by an ungenerous man, and make a fool of herself, but would behave like a rational creature and a genuine woman in service. Em was successful. When the ring of the bell, which tingled through her nerves and made her delicate ears get crimson (as if she were an actress summoned before the foot-lights and before a few thousand spectators on the rising of a curtain), sounded over the house, she answered the appeal with a composed face, a quick, light step, and a steady, skilful hand. She was glad, however, that he turned his back upon her as she removed and folded up the table-cloth, put back one leaf of the table and pulled forward another. She was thankful, though the feeling was purely preposterous, like her other feelings on the subject, that in his hatred of delay, he did not accuse her of bungling with the heavy leaves of the old-fashioned"], [193, "181 SET A THIEF TO CATCH A THIEF. table, and without saying \" by your leave \" add his man's strength to her weakness in disposing of them. If Em had guessed it, in that lay the most cruel injurv done to her. For even while the man's better judgment, better heart, all his gentlemanly instincts, rebelled against the coarse inference, he was forcing himself to believe that Em \u2014 the modest-spirited girl, the infatuatedly attached sister, the fond and faithful daughter \u2014 was a creature set upon him by a die-away, conceited, foolish mother, to angle for his familiar notice and his besotted trust, since the elder woman's endeavours had failed. He was con straining himself to think that the hesitation, and at the same time the originality shining through the girl's clever adaptations of herself to her part \u2014 as of a girl untrained and unaccustomed to her position \u2014 were only so many sly ruses and snares to be followed by the bold airs of the stereotyped lodging-house keeper's daughter. He was per suaded that she was bent on preying upon him, attacking him at all hours, watching craftily and unweariedly till he was off his guard, and till his man's weakness, or rashness, or superciliousness, or indolence, or low animal passions, might yet render him at once her victim and prize. Fortunately for Em's peace of mind, for her maidenly self-respect, she could not conceive the degrading associa tion in which she figured, else she might have been tempted to bid her mother send the door-key to the house agent, and leave their furniture in pledge for the rent, while they begged their way to Cuthbert, or Uncle Jeremy, and hid their diminished heads, vanquished, reduced to be an incumbrance and a drag on the men connected with them to the end of their days. It was bad enough as it was for Em to pacify her mother, and profess excitedly that she liked an experiment in service, that it was good for her, and did not harm her at all ; and when Mrs. Rashleigh refused to be hoodwinked and went on bemoaning herself, to take a high hand over her, and pledge herself solemnly, almost haughtily, that what her mother had done, she, Em, was fit to do, and would not be baulked of her right to do \u2014 and so to rule the elder woman as the stronger will always rule the weaker. Yet Em's life, in all senses, was a mortification to the"], [194, "182 LONDON PRIDE. girl's flesh. In one Hght there is no experience of summer in London so arid and mocking to a native of the country as the experience of one of the modern suburbs. In the city, town and country are so far removed that the one cannot recall the other, and the interests of the one rival those of the other. But the suburbs, unless aristocratic Hke Richmond, or wealthy civilized old bourgeoise suburbs like Hampstead or Blackheath \u2014 the more modern suburbs, with their myriads of blocks of houses, all of one family, then' constant new building operations, combined with their waste places, giving them the air of ambitiously planned, never filled in, petty St. Petersburgs, or of lots in a paper town in the American backwoods ; their in effable dustiness, their fields of cabbages instead of corn and hawthorns with brown flowers, and leaves shrivelling as early as July, are deadly baked, stale, flat, and unprofit able. The very removal of the din and smoke of London to a little distance only gives the imagination room to play, and the aching heart to feel oppressed, till the lurid cloud, constantly rising sky-ward in one direction, pierced occa sionally by the faint rattle of the neighbouring battle of life, may be blasts wreathed into shape from Pande monium. The blazing red geraniums, and the pea-green trailing plant over the vintner's door, represented gardens, fields, and woods, in the little street where Em Hved. And when the sickly green was fast getting yellow, and the glaring red petals were shed in shrivelled orange flakes on all sides, leaving seedy prominent calyces and dwindling flower-stalks, she was fain to think the more of Friar's Lynn, in the dewy dimness and glittering freshness of its mornings and evenings, the blended tenderness and flush of colour, and depth of verdure of its noons ; the mellow, hale, frosty, good old age of its autumns. Em had been a petted girl in her way. An only daughter and sister, she had been taught Latin, to pique Cub into greater application, by her father, and natural history, with no necessity, but con amore, by Cuthbert. She had learnt French and music also from outside masters, like other well brought-up young ladies. She had visited the girls of her age, as an equal, in most of the best houses of the little town \u2014 those of the rich"], [195, "SET A THIEF TO CATCH A THTEF. 183 attorney, and the doctor, and the retired naval officer. She had been visited by the girls in return, even where their respective fathers and mothers did not visit, because she was a respectably connected young girl of the place, and with a view to her brother's future rank as a clergy man in succession to her uncle. Everybody had known her and held that she was well educated, and prettdy behaved. Bearish old bachelor as Uncle Jeremy was, hugging a chronic misunderstanding with her father as he had done, Em had presided at his school feasts, and been the young lady of the house when he underwent visitations from the womenkind of his parish. She had drawn back indig nantly from the sneaking kindness of the young yeomen, even when they aspired to be gentleman farmers ; she who was now replacing a lodging-house servant, and reckoned no better than a lodging-house servant herself, in Lon don! Moreover, in lodging-house service there was such drudgery, slipshodness, and elements of levity, that she felt it aU but contaminated the woman who undertook it. The service was in the hands of the Bohemian Sarah Annes. Girls from the country who had any capability or intelli gence, who had been in good places and had good characters, refused to subject themselves to its burden, exposure, and insult. Well, Em would not be beaten even in treading this hard road. She would pay in his own coin the man who, however good his carriage and pure in accent his speech (and Em had an angry admiration of these advantages), could not conduct himself with courtesy and kindliness even to a servant girl ; a man whom she designated, in her passionate woman's way, a brute of a gentleman. She would be a servant girl to him, a good servant, who should serve him perfectly. He should never have it in his power to say that she failed in her obligations to him, or that she appealed to his pity and indulgence as a fallen down lady, a tyro, and an amateur. He had seen in her no more than the commonest servant girl, and had been imperious and \" short\" to her, as no gentle-tempered man would have been to a servant girl ; she would deprive him of the right to find fault with her whde she was a servant girl to him, and no more."], [196, "184 LONDON PRIDE. The last sentence seems to imply Em had a lurking con viction that, when brought into daily near relation with her, the lodger must discover that she was above the trade which she followed, and wish, perhaps try, to amend his blunder. Em went in to Mr. Hatchard every morning and evening, not like a queen, but like the most complete of dainty housemaids, dressed in the simplest manner. She did not seek to compromise facts as her mother had sought, by the display of silk shawls and mittens, the inappropriate designs of a former and different day, but came as close as she dared to the model housemaid's conventional costume, the clear black cahco with the single small, far-apart sprig of white on the black, made high at the throat and with sleeves fitting tight to the little wrists ; the mourning collar fastened by its tiny bow of black riband. She would have liked to put on a fly-cap, but that was impossible without an amount of outcry and affliction from Mrs. Rashleigh beyond what the experiment was worth. She could only tuck up her fair hair in tight, demure braids, and show a plain muslin apron (\"just to keep me clean, mamma \") instead. An accomplished author has described to perfection the becoming, womanly effect of such a costume on the unprincipled intriguante, Magdalen Vanstone, and made it easier to be supposed what it could be on an honest, dutiful, innocent girl like Em Rashleigh. Em was an agreeable waitress to look upon, and in an incredibly short time she rid herself of the town-bred habits which had been creeping over the old habits more a part of her being. She was the first up in the street, and was never behindhand even with the martinet who sum moned her and expected her to appear in the twinkling of an eye. She learned to wait with beautiful celerity, quiet ness, and precision. \" I should despise my education if it did not do something for me here as elsewhere, qualify me to rise sooner after the lark, when need was, poise a tray more exactly, and brush away crumbs and dust without making a greater mess than any obtuse, uncouth country woman,\" Em boasted to herself, in a faint blush of triumph, a dawning reward for her determination. She taught herself to say, \" Please, sir,\" very soberly"], [197, "SET A THIEF TO CATCH A THIEF. 185 and respectfully, and was pointed in using the phrase when she addressed the autocrat, or was compelled to require an occasional note appended to his succinct, sweeping orders. Her knees were tempted to bend in a curtsey, but that would have been too much of a joke, too nigh to turning the situation into ridicule and mockery. Now, Em was most solemnly in earnest in forcing the man to respect her as a lodging-house keeper's daughter, by asking no favour or forbearance at his domineering, grind- ing hand. If her sense of humour got the better of her occasionally, it was because she was young and her heart was light yet in spite of everything. Em's part was well done, very wed done ; a shade ex- aggerated, but perhaps that was inevitable even in a talented young performer. As it was, it would have brought down thunders of applause from the most difficult audience at private theatricals. Mr. Hatchard had some experience of human nature, a bitter experience personally, without doubt, prompting him to trample on the good side of it ; but he was human him- self, in spite of his frowning sternness. He could not help seeing that Em was playing a part, though he did not wish to see it, and indicated with haughty rudeness that he would not be played with in it, or implicated in it. He had come to this pass, that he could not help admiring the pluck and the instinctive defiance of him with which the girl played, and having some sympathy with the player \u2014 for was it not a copy in miniature of his own game ? He bit his lips at some of her \" Please, sirs,\" and indemnified himself for the provocation by the accusa tion, false and craven though it was, made to his own heart, that here were more airs to attract him \u2014 little as he had laid himself out for them \u2014 blank as he was in the matrimonial lottery, here was coquetry, granting that it was of the subtlest kind. He was more provoked than amused by the conclusion, and was restless under his show of imperturbability in sustaining the infliction."], [198, "186 LONDON PRIDE. CHAPTER II. SWEET ARE THE USES OF ADVERSITT. On a rainy evening, going out to post letters, Mr. Hatchard encountered Em in her shabbiest bonnet \u2014 for she never wore hats now, these would not have been in character unless for a French waiting-woman \u2014 bent on the same errand. Em was sallying forth under an umbrella, the bearer of an urgent missive to thoughtless, impulsive Cuthbert, bidding him write oftener, and let Em and her mother know what class he was likely to take at last ; an innocent question enough, but apt to put an extinguisher on Cuthbert's letters for the next month. Mr. Hatchard made way for Em as any gentleman would make way for a woman ; and he stopped, and hesitated \u2014 he to whom hesitation was foreign \u2014 \" I am going to post letters ; I can take yours,\" he offered. \"No, thank you, sir ; there is no occasion for your giving yourself the trouble,\" Em answered, with civd sincerity and decision. He let her pass ; he was at the post-office before her, walking with his quick step, and he went on the opposite side of the street, so that when her umbrella was caught by another umbrella and was spiked at a corner, he was beyond observing the accident and coming to her rescue. The next overture which Mr. Hatchard made towards recognizing Em as a human creature as well as a lodging house keeper's daughter \u2014 a bright, vivacious, child-like human creature, too \u2014 it was Em whose imprudence in duced the impropriety, and she could have whipped herself smartly afterwards for being guilty of forgetting herself during the space of five minutes. One afternoon the lodger arrived accompanied by a labouring man, carrying what looked like a squirrel in a cage. Mr. Hatchard took the cage from the porter at the door, installed beast and cage on a side-table in his room, and proceeded to feed the little animal with a store of foreign food which he had procured for its consumption. A regular London landlady might have reasonably ob-"], [199, "SWEET ARE THE USES OF ADVERSITT. 187 jected to the intruder \u2014 its noise, the danger of its escaping and gnawing the legs of her chairs and the cornices of hei room. Em might have screeched that the creature would bite her to the bone, and that she would not cross the threshold where an outlandish creature, like a rat but for its tail, might fly over her head, \u2014 for this squirrel could fly as well as leap, as Em, who had once been in the room when its master had it out of its cage, could bear testimony by the evidence of her own marvelling eyes. But not only did Mrs. Rashleigh's lodger keep her under splendid dis cipline ; Mrs. Rashleigh could not find it in her heart to censure the man's more unpardonable offence, which re minded her vividly of the boyish scrapes of her son Cuth bert, to which distance lent enchantment. As for Em, she was enchanted in the present. This creature, though Em knew it was outlandish, with outlandish ways, and not a native, unsophisticated squirrel, was to her the im personation of the country and of all the country pets in which she had revelled with Cub before he had reached the years of care and the Latin grammar. What such an impersonation was to a country-bred woman pining among the unconscious, unheeding hordes of the stone and lime wilderness of the metropolitan world, only she could have told. Like the Ranz des Vaches to poor Swiss exiles \u2014 mercenary soldiers in the pleasant plains of France and Flanders \u2014 like the pibrochs of High land pipers groaning and sobbing out their last breath to Scotch emigrants in the leafy depths of the backwoods of a new world, were the glimpses of the lithe, lawless, funny little fellow who still made a boa of his tail, as she had charged him with doing when she was a little girl, and wished her ruff was as constantly at hand ; who performed rounds of somersaults for his private diversion, and held his nuts between his front paws and grimaced over them, while he ate them as if he were twin brother to a monkey. She could not keep from calling him \" Jack,\" after a lost squirrel, the soul of which seemed to have crossed to another hemisphere and entered into this little grey kins man, in order to come back and mock his old mistress. So great did the fascination become, that to Em's over whelming shame Mr. Hatchard caught her hanging over the cage, prattling to and coaxing her Jack \u2014 her Jack"], [200, "188 LONDON PRIDE. waxed grey-haired ; and no wonder when everything was so changed with Cub and Em \u2014 not minding even if he should bite her sharply with his needle-like teeth, for the sake of preserving the illusion, in what was little better than a clandestine correspondence. The lodger appeared blind and deaf to the group which his entrance spoilt. It was days afterwards that he looked up as Em was leaving the room one morning, and briefly offered to let her have the squirrel in her own room in his absence, prefacing the offer by an absolutely frank and friendly admission from an overbearing, reserved man. \" Perhaps I should have asked liberty before I brought him here. I wish to study his structure and habits, and to try whether he cannot be rendered tamer. You may have him with you if you care for squirrels ; he will tame the sooner for not always being kept on parade.\" Em resisted with indignation a weak yearning to profit by the proposal. \" You are very good, sir ; but I have so many duties to attend to. And then, I could not incur the responsibility.\" \"Very well,\" he acquiesced, in his beard, far from press ing the attention upon her, and without looking up again. And Em quitted the room to boast to herself of not losing sight of her place, and not letting herself down a peg from her eminence as a lodging-house keeper's daughter and an attendant on his majesty, by being beholden to him for a plaything of a squirrel in the dreary matter-of factness and narrowness of a lodging-house keeper's life. Of course, Em forgot, as a murderer is sure to neglect some trifling precaution in his disguise, that it was a blot on her dignity to prove spiteful and vindictive. No more passages-at-arms, except those which belonged to lodger and attendant, occurred between Em and Mr. Hatchard for several weeks. It seemed as if he had accepted as final his second repulse for venturing ever so slightly out of his armour of offence and defence, and had fixed not to break down the distinctions of grades, and the laws of etiquette, in future. It happened that some acquaintances from Friar's Lynn found their way to London and to the Rashleighs. The Rashleighs pricked themselves up, as good blood pricks itself, to put the best face on their adventure (they could"], [201, "SWEET ARE THE USES OF ADVERSITT. 189 barely subsist by the support of their single lodger), in order to send a favourable report of their doing in the world down to Friar's Lynn and Dutton-on-the-Hill. They only asked for news of the old house and of the old friends in a carelessly cordial tone, and not as if they were dying to hear of them. Camden Town was fortunately too far out of the great routes for the surprises of visits at all hours, because Mrs. Rashleigh and Em could certainly have been convicted of the small duplicity of concealing from their old neighbours ' with the retribution of being tormented by the suspicion that the concealment was ineffectual) that they were keep ing a lodger, and that without a servant, and that therefore gadding abroad was highly inconvenient for them. Uncle Jeremy had said that he would come up to London and bury what was left of them decently, after their bones had been picked clean in that great den of thieves and mur derers ; but it should not be through them, if they could help it, that Uncle Jeremy would hear that the bones were in process of picking. Besides, their present life would have involved grievous loss of caste at Friar's Lynn. Mrs. Rashleigh, a poor walker at all times, was not able to lionize the Friar's Lynnians. But Em scraped together and economized to the last moment the fragments of her time, and left her mother alone, for the first time since they came up to London, to go sight-seeing with those who were not so much friends as familiars, friends of her friends, faces to which her heart warmed because known in better days. No longer in the restraint of her chamber maid's character and dress, she was fluttering lightly in old turned-out foolery of Friar's Lynn, with black riband sash and sombre streamers at the back of her muslin cloak. The whole was furbished up, who knows how, by the ingenuity of women on an emergency, in transforming lilac into lavender, while black ribands and a black ved touched up with sad suggestions the disused hat. Em made appointments with her friends among the Assyrian bulls in the British Museum, or the shops in St. Paul's Churchyard. She accompanied the party, amidst troops of demonstrative foreigners, and knowing, mis chievous Christ's Hospital boys let loose for the holidays \u2014 the tourists of London in August \u2014 to the empty chapels"], [202, "190 LONDON PRCDE. of Westminster Abbey, the benches of St. Stephen's, Wren's dome, Paxton's Crystal Palace ; the deserted, burnt-up parks ; the cool, resounding Thames Tunnel ; thc Tower, which was no more a single citadel, but might have stood for Tower Hamlets, that seated two members in her Majesty's Parliament. At last the sight-seers arrived, in the course of their labours, in the Rashleighs' vicinity, at Regent's Park and the Zoological Gardens. Em had never seen the Gardens before, and aviaries and aquavivariums, bear-pit and monkey-house, were con genial ground for her, framed as she had been in Cub's tastes. She was longing for Cuthbert from his classics and metaphysics, or what ought to have been his classics and metaphysics, when just as the company turned towards the Carnivora Terrace, Em distinguished Mr. Hatchard, in his squire's rough coat, pacing along by the dens. If he had time to leave his office in the middle of the day, in order to pamper his boyish predilection \u2014 as Friar's Lynn would have ranked it \u2014 for beasts, wild and tame, in Regent's Park Gardens, then a clerk's office under Govern ment must be a nice sinecure, and its holder a vast deal better off than an Oxonian, or than poor people who keep lodgers. Em had her observation seduced from its lawful food \u2014 honest as was her lively admiration of the islands full of wild ducks, and her gleeful anticipation of the parrots' room \u2014 by the coincidence of meeting with her lodger. She watched him for some time before he observed her, and she judged by the air of being at home with which he was walking about and looking in at the animals, that he must be a frequent visitor at the Gardens. When he came close to her and his eyes lit upon her, following him covertly with her eyes, he touched his hat slightly, and, what amazed Em, reddened manifestly through the brown of his complexion, as he moved on. Perhaps he was annoyed at having to acknowledge her by a greeting ever so slight in public. What a pity that he had not spared the greeting ! Perhaps he thought that it was a liberty in her to look at him. He could not feel more affronted than she herself did at her having fallen into the child's ill-breeding of staring."], [203, "SWEET ARE THE USES OF ADVERSITT. 191 \" Who is that gentleman-like, I should say distinguished looking, man who bowed to you, dear ? \" inquired one of Em's companions inquisitively, aggrieved that the commu nication was only a bow, and not a stoppage, possibly an introduction and amalgamation with the party, for manners were comparatively primitive down at Friar's Lynn. \" His name is Hatchard ; I know very Httle about him,\" replied Em, evasively. But in a few minutes she had cause to regret her concealment. Em had barely time to hear a quick, firm step behind her which she was sure that she recognized, when her mother's lodger joined her and accosted her. \" Allow me to walk through this department with you, Miss Rashleigh.\" He spoke ceremoniously, but with all his promptness and with an accent of command, and not solicitation. Em was perplexed, annoyed, and angry, to an extent that she could not account for. She availed herself of the companionship of a son and brother of the Friar's Lynn ladies, a good-natured, heavy young man, who, as an old schoolfellow of Cuthbert's, and as an old pupil of her father's, had his own claim on her regard, and had found his head a little turned with the claim and with its acknow ledgment during the last five days. She said, with a pre tence of understanding his meaning Hterally, \" I have a protector already, Mr. Hatchard.\" In addition, Em could not resist bestowing on him roguishly such a bit of house maid flippancy as he expected from her, doubtless, \" My mother knows I'm out, sir.\" He did not give up his purpose ; he only said, per sistently, with the ghost of a smile hovering on his Hps beneath his beard, but with the frown on his brow deepen ing, \" You had better. I am a sub-manager here, and I am at your service, as well as at that of the public in general.\" It was as if he had said, \" You do your duty to the letter in waiting upon me in my lodging. Permit me to do my duty in waiting upon you here.\" Em fairly gaped. Her Government official a manager in the Zoological Gardens ! Her mother's despotic, dis trustful lodger no better than they were themselves ! No better ? A thousand times worse \u2014 only a little removed from a showman !"], [204, "192 LONDON PRIDE. And there was one of the Friar's Lynnians pinching her arm, and whispering, in trepidation, \" My goodness, Em Rashleigh, come away ; how could you get acquainted with a wild-beast keeper ! I see now that his air is that of a circus man ; \" ana the friend dragged Em forward, leaving her no opportunity to say more than a repetition of her negative to Hatchard. Em was confounded, and breathlessly engrossed, with the shock which she had received, so that in spite of the superior knowledge that she had acquired second-hand from many an eager narrative of the boy Cub, she was so culpably negligent of what her companions were doing, that she did not interfere to prevent the young man from Friar's Lynn, who was fond of a sly practical joke, con triving, when the nearest keeper's back was turned, to push his stick through an aperture, and poke a sulky leopardess. With a sudden roar like thunder, the splendid spotted Terror responded to tbe stupid and rash aggression by springing up and spreading out her claws, lashing her tail, and passing from side to side of her limited boundaries, with wild and baffled leaps. The ladies shrieked and ran, all but Em, who remained arrested by the spectacle. The offender, though consider ably discomfited and alarmed by the effect of his trick, stood his ground like a true Briton. Several keepers came hurrying to spot. The first arrival, a grey old soldier, with clasps and a medal on his breast, called to the next, \" Edwards, fetch the Captain.\" In the mean time, the moustache grise, heartily detesting all civilians and interlopers, turned to express his just indigna tion at the cool proceeding of the visitor. \" What do you mean by that 'ere behaviour, my master ? Ain't you told by the placards to leave the animals alone ? Now, she has been in a ticklish humour ever since her dead cub was taken away from her, and you have just been and gone and done it when her own keeper \u2014 him as she has a regard for \u2014 is out for a half -holiday.\" \"What a rampageous beast ! \" protested Tom Booth, in an accent of injured innocence ; \" but though she bellows like ten bulls, she can't do any harm ; she is tio-ht enough surely. \" Well, you may pray that those bars have been forged"], [205, "193 SWEET ARE THE USES OF ADVERSITT. on honour and on the strongest principle, before you are 'anded over to a beak ; else you may look to it. But the 'ard thing is, that you may have lost more wallable lives than yours with your cussed impudence. Edwards, is there any sight of the Captain ? \" The flying women of the Booths were still within ear- shot of the grim insinuation, and it not only caused them to start anew, with redoubled speed, but to beseech in an agony, \" Oh, Tom, come with us this minute. Take us out of this horrid place. You hear what the man says ? If we do not get beyond the gate instantly, we shall faint or die,\" \u2014 compelling Tom to run after them, catching at Em's hand, and calling on her, in his turn, to follow the others. But Em resisted, and lingered the more that her lodger was walking rapidly up. He tried the door, and pushed against the bars of the cage : \" I think there is no danger. There is no need to form cordon, or to resort to any violence, at present. Keep out of her sight, and don't attempt to quiet her, unless Jones should come back. I shall watch her myself till feeding-time, and if she is not calmed down then, I shall remain all night. Oh, Miss Rashleigh, be so good as to follow your companions.\" Em retreated at last, thoroughly abashed ; after the mischief that her party had done, it was a great deal too much for her to stay and be in the way. She could not recover herself after she had overtaken the Booths. They were far out of the way in the refreshment room, eating and drinking away their panic. And they made the occasion of it out to be nothing more than an abominable snarl of the old keeper's, who had wanted to get rid of them, and who had not hesitated to practise on the deli cate nerves of sensitive females. They finally settled that Tom ought to write a letter against the abuse of place by understrappers, and send it, like S. G. O.'s letters, to the Times. Em framed an excuse to part from her friends and return home. She was almost callous to the great pro bability that they would observe upon her the moment her back was turned, \" how much Em Rashleigh was altering for the worse, learning smart, fast London manners, seek ing to monopolize and make a cat's-paw of Tom, betraying that she kept dreadfully low company in being accosted 0"], [206, "194 LONDON PRIDE. by one of the keepers in a menagerie, or the Zoological Gardens. What a disheartening report for old Mr. Rash leigh of Dutton-on-the-Hill.\" Mrs. Rashleigh was stunned, as Em had been, by Em's news. \" To think that we were so sure he was a gentle man ! Make a beggar a porter, indeed ! But he paid for his lodging ; never a gentleman paid more honestly. I am glad that Sarah Anne is not here to twit us with her prognostications, though you and I have to wait on a genteel wild-beast man. He don't smell of them, Em, and he never brought any beast near us except the squirrel which you were so silly about. If he bring any more, grey or green, or like the creature and its mate that he wrote of as plain as paint, he shall have his leave. 1 am afraid, Em, that we cannot put him out on the spur of the moment. Oh, I am so thankful that the Booths are to return to Friar's Lynn to-morrow (cannot people stay comfortably at home ? I never could abide wandering Jews), and that they will never identify him as our lodger, since you were so discreet as not to let it out on the spot. When I think of it again, Em, I believe he has been a gentleman originally ; we could not be so far mistaken. Well-a-day, what a downcome has been there ! Why your father had an aversion to Cuthbert's traffic in beasts, lest it should send him to sea to get a glimpse of them in foreign parts, or tempt him to emigrate, or to sink into a farmer at home ; but he never contemplated such a degradation as this. I wonder how it came about, seeing that he has been as steady as a judge, and as industrious with his animal drawing as if it were something worth while, since he came to us,\" pondered Mrs. Rashleigh. Em could not enlighten her mother, but she saw her so far through her mystifications, and at rest for the night ; then Em slipped down to the parlour and gave herself up to her own musings. Mr. Hatchard's airs of command had been an assump tion, yet how well he had carried it out when the exposure came, for that matter he had leant himself to the exposure. When Em came to think of it, she could not say that he had been a party to the deception which she and her mother had practised on themselves beyond be.no- silent, and he was taciturn on every subject."], [207, "SWEET ARE THE USES OF ADVERSITT. 195 Keeper or no keeper \u2014 sub-manager he had called it \u2014 she and her mother were, to all intents and purposes, his lodging keepers ; the relation between them was neither an imposition nor was it altered in the slightest degree. Were all upper keepers in Zoological Gardens addressed as Captain, Hke captains of police and of fire-brigades ? He had never looked more like a head man, a commander, than when he gave his charges to the other keepers appealing to him and deferring to him, as he stood leaning against the wild beast's cage, shaken with the struggles of the fierce, powerful creature to get free and to spend its fury on its prey. Was he there now in the chill and dusk of the night, lit up with gleams of wild beasts' eyes \u2014 a horrid light, out of place in the haunts of men ? Was his enemy's rest lessness become more ungovernable until it had roused the wild-beast sleeplessness of the other occupants of the Gardens, and all was maddening uproar and rebellion ? Could it be that the iron bars might yield and the brave man be exposed in the van of a deadly conflict until his strong and stately form was \" torn,\" as the words re curred to her with mocking significance and irony, \" limb from limb ? \" Like broken shifting lights, these wandering thoughts came and went in the girl's mind. At last Em woke up shuddering and hoping that God would forgive her for her past malice, and defend him who was doing his duty at his post hke a man, just as his latch-key turned in the lock of the front door. Her heart bounded in relief and thankfulness, and then, like a woman, she hastily put out her light, that he might not see she had been sitting up watching for him; and ended by creeping to bed smarting under a mortifying per ception of her folly in the very act of putting out her light at the moment of his return, so as to express most intelligibly what had been the motive of her vigil. Em and Mr. Hatchard met the next morning without the most distant hint of the Zoological Gardens ; without an inquiry on Em's side for the interestingly savage mourner \u2014 the leopardess, or a regret on his for the fright and expulsion of her and her friends from the Carnivora Terrace."], [208, "196 LONDON PRIDE. If there were a grain of difference in the intercourse between the two, Em was more respectful in her homage, and more exact in her services than ever, for was he not still their lodger, and in that light, though he were ten times a keeper in the Zoological Gardens, should he not be waited on like a king ? But in the repressed reluctance and anuoyance at receiving some of her offices which had for a long time now been visible on the man's side, there suddenly rose to the surface and began to prevail an amount of quiet resignation. In the evening the postman's knock diverted Em's thoughts from Mr. Hatchard and the Zoological Gardens by bringing her a letter from Oxford and Cuthbert. It had been long in coming, it had been much wished for. In one of those flashes of erroneous assurance that \" long waited for come at last \" must repay its cost and contain good news, great news, news not yet too late, Em, in ex cited spirits at any rate, incautiously carried the letter straight to her mother and began to read it aloud, glee fully, triumphantly, without any previous examination of its contents. She read it ere long with sinking, breaking voice, with whitening lips, and with swelling heart \u2014 to the mother, with her hand upon her heart, and her trem bling lips pressed together, calling out in unusually firm, authoritative tones, as one who had a first, an indisputable right to hear these tidings, \" Read on, Em, read out, child, read to the end.\" \"Dearest mother and darling Em,\" wrote poor Cub, deprecatingly, remorsefully, but still accusingly, in his remorse, \" there is no go for me, either Httle or great. I have been plucked again. It is hard for me to write it and for you to read it ; but I don't know that it is not hardest of all upon me to have been sent here, when I never had any capacity for scholarship in me. I don't mean to pretend that I might not have done better ; gone and been coached for other professions ; worked with my hands at night, to keep myself from being a burden on you poor souls of women, eating you up ; and not have let myself be set upon, tooth and nail, by rats, ferrets, dogs, horses \u2014 any prospect of vermin or name of animal \u2014 and been bled by them, I am sorry to confess, with more loss of blood than either you or I have to shed. But that"], [209, "197 SWEET ARE THE USES OF ADVERSITT. loss will not come upon you. I could go down on my knees in acknowledgment of so much absolution. Dolph Baker \u2014 you remember little Dolph, at least I am sure my mother does \u2014 with the making of a gentleman, and a reading man in him (he is a trump !), stands between me and the screws till I can pay him \u2014 and I shall, as I am an honest ne'er-do-well, though not a gentleman or a reading man. He has succeeded to his mother's fortune, so he has that grandest endowment which we never had, and which, to my knowledge, is power \u2014 loose cash. He is able to do me a good turn, without personal inconvenience, which, of course, I could not hear of, though I had to sell myself, body and soul, like Faust \u2014 Gounod's Faust \u2014 to such low, disreputable money-lenders as take in hand with rubbish of clipped men of the lower ranks Hke me. But you must allow me to break my terms and cut the whole con cern here ; the poor governor is gone from the sense of waste and failure which the step might have been to him. Dolph has a cousin setting out to rear herds of cattle on the pampas and llanos of South America, and he has made so small a book in agriculture, either bucolic or georgie, that I am actually the most practical man he knows, since he wants somebody that he has spoken to to accompany him. If I go, I enter on a jolly salary at once, and cease to be a drag upon you ; and I carry my wooden head and, hitherto, useless thews and sinews out of your sight. Of course, I shall send home all the tin I can spare, and I shall be able to spare lots out there for my debts and everything. And I promise to send my mother a specimen of Paraguay tea, and you a Brazil parrot ; \u2014 only think of a Polly to chatter and swear over you, if the sadors in the home-bound ships ain't saints. \" The worst of it is, that I must leave immediately, for Dolph's cousin is for an impromptu outfit and an expedi tion in a ship which sails from Bristol in ten days ; and I shall only come up to town for a day, just to see you, and bid you good-bye. If it were not that I don't think you would stand it, I believe that it would be better to combine the good-byes with the welcome homes, as I shall do in Uncle Jeremy's case.

Rather forgive and forget till I return, with a right to be remem bered. \u2014 Faithfully yours, Cuthbert Rashleigh.\" Em broke the silence in passionate rejection of the claim to independence and oblivion. \" Cuthbert is selfish ; he might have done better, mother.\" \"I don't know what you say, child,\" exclaimed Mrs. Rashleigh, pushing her cap from her ears, and fumbling for her spectacles, as if smitten with sudden deafness and blindness, and as if the recovery of the use of her senses would deliver her from her trouble. \" He has done his best. Did he not say that he had done his best ? And he knew little or nothing, all along, of the sacrifices which were made for his education. He was always kept in the dark, lest he should be turned away from and disgusted at the course that he had but half a mind to. I don't know that it was acting quite fair, after all, by my boy. And he is in trouble, Em, though I cannot tell why he should write in parables about teeth and nails, reminding me of the bites, and scratches, and bruises, that I was always doctor ing for him when he was a foolhardy little fellow, and would be handling strange dogs, and cats, and squirrels \u2014 like the grey beast in the other room \u2014 and even oxen brought in to the Friar's Lynn butcher, and horses to the farrier, let his father or who would, try to prevent him. And what does he mean by calling himself rubbish of the lower rank, when he is as good as anybody at Friar's Lynn? It does not signify so very much, after all, his not being a clergyman, and his leaving off his studies, though it was his father's ambition for him ; and we have pinched for it all these years, and changed our prospects in Hfe for it within these twelve months, if he has set his heart on some other way of doing \u2014 and it has driven him to this alternative. But he must not go abroad and leave us, Em; we have only one man belonging to us, and we cannot spare him out of the country. What could we two lone women do without a head of the house \u2014 a man, in whose"], [211, "SWEET ARE THE USES OF ADVERSITT. 199 very name there is shelter and cherishing ? Go and see what money there is in the house, child, and count it up ; we must draw out more \u2014 all that we have ; we must borrow from Mr. Hatchard, and tell him that we are called away all of a sudden. We must make a journey to Oxford, where we never saw the colleges and the halls that he had some pride in at the first. We were always to have gone when he passed, or was ordained, or something, in Whitsun week \u2014 such a pleasant time of the year for a bit of plea- sure. But our change of plans cannot be helped. I dare say that we can manage in the third class in the railway. We must prevent Cuthbert's thinking of going out of the country. It was very naughty of little Dolph Baker to put it into his head ; I should not have thought it of him. An only son and brother \u2014 such a fine strong young man for his five-and-twenty years. How could we get on with- out him, my dear ? How could he ever suppose such a thing ? \" Em did not say that it would be a scandal and a disgrace for Cuthbert to delay longer at the university, now that he knew he could not carry off its barest credentials ; that it had been a scandal of boyish irresponsibility, weakness of will, and recklessness for him to have delayed so long. She did not hint that he might not be able to do better now than go abroad, as he proposed ; that he might be in danger of losing an opening, rare and precious to a man of his fatal mental bluntness, and useless physical ability, by not availing himself of Mr. Baker's cousin's offer. Nay, that he might mortally offend the Squire's friendly son, and cause his debts \u2014 those dishonouring debts, incurred in very weakness and facile self-indulgence, to a man in Cuthbert's position \u2014 to fall back on her and her mother, forcing them to sell every stick of their furniture, and stitch of their clothes, and throwing them into a debtor's prison, without relieving Cuthbert. For Em, like ninety- nine out of a hundred clever young women, was profoundly ignorant of the laws of legal responsibility, and debtor and creditor. She said nothing of all this to Mrs. I_ashleigh, but on the contrary, she laboured to soothe her mother by count- ing over every shilling of the Httle stock of money which they had on hand, finding it more than sufficient for the"], [212, "200 LONDON PRIDE. journey to Oxford, third class, and by procuring a time table and calculating the trains and stages. Em trusted that to-morrow would provide a resource after she had reflected for a night what they had better do \u2014 very likely the most feasible thing would be to humble themselves by applying to Uncle Jeremy, who was sure to take her view of the subject, and to drive her mother to despair. For a time Em was successful in her efforts, and Mrs. Rashleigh was comforted by the near prospect of repairing to Cuthbert, laying hold of him, and preventing what she regarded as his involuntary heart-breaking desertion of them, and sacrifice of himself, the direst misfortune that could befall them all. But in the middle of Mrs. Rashleigh's incoherent plans as to what Em and she should wear, and about the sand wich bag which they ought to prepare, she began to com plain of coldness and sickness and of sudden dizziness and blindness, and to put out her hands and grope with them, as if the world were slipping away from her grasp. Em's consternation was not that of entire ignorance and inexperience of the symptoms. She had seen her mother attacked in a similar manner before, more than once, so that she, her mother, and the Friar's Lynn doctor, were in the habit of distinguishing the seizures as those of Mrs. Rashleigh's \" old complaint.\" But Em suspected also that the seizures themselves were not without danger, and she was aware that they left behind them utter prostration and long-continuing weakness. Neither had she ever seen her mother so near unconsciousness \u2014 that sad, significant stage in human maladies. The two, mother and daughter, wore lone women in the unconcerned crowd of London. Em was at her wits' end, but preserved her outward self-control like a brave, true, loving woman. She remembered what remedies had been resorted to before, and applied them with a natural gift and taet of nursing, so that Mrs. Rashleigh was recovering before Mr. Hatchard was heard coming in for the evening. But his step sounded to Em now not Hke that of the lodger who had begun by establishing his distance from them, but like that of the friend in need, who must sympa thize with them, whose man's strength and judgment would cast out evil and bring them dehverance."], [213, "SWEET ARE THE USES OF ADVERSITT. 201 Em had slipped on her bonnet and cloak, and was ready to intercept him. She could leave her mother now, and she would run out and fetch a doctor, if Mr. Hatchard could tell her where she might soonest find one, and if he would be so good as to remain within call of the sick woman in her absence. \" What are you thinking of, Miss Rashleigh ? \" he interrupted her, in amazement that was not only sharp, but indignant. \" I shall bring a doctor in five minutes. It is not fit for you to go out alone, on that or any other errand, in a London suburb after nightfall. Why do your friends permit it ? What are men made for ? \" Em did not decline to be obliged to him this night. In the middle of her distress she shrank back abashed at the implication that she had been about to do something im- prudent and wrong, and that a man had needed to read her a lesson on propriety. He had taken up his hat again, and was passing her, when he was struck with the crest- fallen attitude, in addition to her dejected face, and he stopped short and addressed her. \" I am very much con- cerned to hear that Mrs. Rashleigh is so poorly,\" he said gravely ; and the man had such a manly way with him, that, haughty as he had been, and wild-beast keeper as he had constituted himself, Em felt herself bowing her head in grateful acknowledgment of his kindness. A doctor came in immediate response to the summons of such an applicant. He reassured Em so far by confirm- ing her impression that the worst of the illness was over for the present. But he filled her with dismay by his warnings that great care must be taken of the patient, every exertion must be avoided, all excitement interdicted, though it was easy to comply with the charge to-night, when Mrs. Rashleigh was still spent by her illness and still stupefied by the treatment which it had received. Em watched her lulled into sleep within an hour of the doctor's departure. But then she stole out, leaving the door ajar, and took refuge in the parlour. There was more need of thinking than ever, more call not to break down. What was to come out of to-morrow with its awaking to anxiety and grief ? Oh, Cuthbert ! oh, mother ! Would he be the death of her, affectionate son as he had always been, in"], [214, "202 LONDON PRIDE. spite of his easiness of temper and his heedlessness ; and then be a wanderer and a vagabond in all the miserable years of his future life ? And she was not able to lift a finger to prevent it. In the great world of London were there thousands more of poor girls who could not help the wrong and the suffering, who had acted for the best, done what they could, yet on whose heads \u2014 ah ! what was far worse, on the heads of those dearest to them \u2014 the suffering was about to fall crushingly ? Em raised her head, startled by a subdued and softened tap at the parlour door. To her fresh surprise, Mr. Hatchard obeyed her permission to come in, and made particular, earnest inquiries for Mrs. Rashleigh. While Em was composing herself to reply to them, there appeared to be that in her white, agitated, and tear stained face and her ruffled, drooping girl's head, which entitled and induced him to prevent her rising from her seat, to come and stand near her, speaking to her \u2014 a reversal of the parts which they had been accustomed to play together. Yet, to a worldly mind, the circumstances might have appeared to render it only the more unsuitable and in decorous that he should be there, where he had never been before \u2014 there alone with Em in the evening while her poor invalided, incapable mother, the only other person in the house, was confined to her room in a state of helpless unconsciousness. But Em would never have dreamt that their proud, self sufficing, self-restrained lodger could be guilty of abusing his advantage, if he had been a hundred times a man, young, handsome, and imperious, and she a girl attractive and simple. She knew herself better; she knew him better after all. If she could ever have dreamt of such baseness, she would not have consented that he should come into the house with her and her mother ; she would have begged or starved rather than waited on him. As it was, her part in the small proprieties of life fell off from her in the height of her tribulation, as the despotism of circumstances, the restraints of custom, and thc infirmities and burden of the flesh will fad from us all one day, and fetter and impede us no more."], [215, "203 SWEET ARE THE USES OF ADVERSITT. No, Em did not trouble herself much with personal vanities and scruples at that moment. She only felt in her new doubts and weakness that it was good to be sup ported. She wished that Cub had been strong, for it must be good for any girl who was gifted with a strong father, or brother, or husband, to have her own perplexed weary being absorbed in that of another. It must be not without its sweetness to be ruled over and cared for and petted, as she half suspected that this frowning-browed, big-bearded man, who had been mindful and careful of his squirrel, would wrap in the mantle of his accountability, capability, and secret fondness, any woman connected with him. Mr. Hatchard roused Em by his confident assertion, \" There is no occasion for fear, take good care of your mother, hope the best, and let things take their course.\" Em gave way at the thought of how little he knew what he was saying, and what might be the result of things taking their course, and of how powerless she was to stem the current of events and turn their course. Her crying disturbed and vexed him, she could see that ; but he did not go away and leave her, and when he spoke to her next it was to rally her with a good humour and a gentleness which sat upon his sternness and wdfulness in complete contrast to them, yet with nothing discordant in the mutual relations, like a rough rock's harsh outline softened graciously by tufts of moss and hare-bells, or like a big man's impatience with a patient side turned to little children. \" Come, I did not look for this from you : I thought that you were so sensible and so satirical. Ah ! that is not the word ; I beg your pardon for it. But shall I go after the doctor, and bid him send a regular nurse to attend upon Mrs. Rashleigh, because you are too shaken and nervous for the duty ? \" \"Not at all. No, no.\" He had expected to stimulate her into an immediate rejection of the proposal, into an effort to recover her calm ness, and prove to him that she was fit for her post. What he had not expected was the piteous cry succeeding the rejection. \" It is not that. But we ought to be at Oxford to morrow ; at least, if we do not do something to keep him,"], [216, "204 LONDON PRIDE. Cuthbert will have made all his preparations to sad for South America, and the loss of him will kill mamma. It is dreadfully foolish of me to cry when I ought to be better employed. Pray, Mr. Hatchard, can I telegraph at any hour, and which is the nearest telegraph office ? I do not mean that I shall go there to-night ; \" and she blushed as she referred to his late censure on her rashness. \"But there can be no harm in my going early in the morning.\" He was frowning again. \"Yes, to telegraph is the way to do what you wish, so far as I understand you ; and you may do it without waste of time, if you can trust me.\" He finished a little stiffly. \"I have no one but you,\" said Em simply, and when she had said it, she was conscious of the mingled ungracious ness and awkwardness of the confession ; she stammered on, trying to say something better and more appropriate. \" You have been very kind, there is no objection to your knowing the truth.\" She was blundering more and more, and in desperation she drew Cuthbert's letter from her pocket and offered it to her mother's lodger. \" But, remember, yon must not think any harm of Cuthbert,\" she exclaimed, in alarm, and with some return of her former spirit. \" He is a dear unlucky, careless, sport-loving boy \u2014 I am afraid too careless and sport-loving for a clergyman \u2014 but there never wae anything in him save a warm heart, a guileless temper, and, I suppose, too good a digestion. A dear fellow ! I believe there are few clergymen so good as he is, and not such another darling son and brother.\" Mr. Hatchard read Cuthbert's letter in confirmation of his sister's defence \u2014 a defence so womanly that it was not a defence but a panegyric, unbending farther into curiosity, anxiety, and half-amused, half-provoked cordiality. \" Well, at least, it is an honest letter, I should say. I conclude that the mischief is not more than might have been expected ? \" he observed inquiringly, as he ended. Em was not offended ; though the commendation had a sardonic flavour, it sounded fair enough from their manly rigid neighbour. \" If Cuthbert would only stay at home something might turn up for him,\" she pleaded; \"the debt is bad, but I don't think it can be much ; Cuthbert always talks bic in the best sense, of his errors \u2014 that is, when he is conscience-"], [217, "SWEET ARE THE USES OF ADVERSITT. 205 stricken. That generous young Mr. Baker, a friend in deed, papa's old pupil,\" Em explained, holding up her head once more, \" helps Cuthbert till he can discharge his obligations. We were set upon his taking orders, and he complied with our wishes to please those who had a right to be pleased. But the university is so expensive, and there were men with full purses on every side of him, courting Cuthbert's society, no doubt, for he is so frank and nice and bright, at everything save his books ; only he was never careful to count every penny he possessed. Then he had not the heart to be careful when he was so dashed by being refused his degree, time after time,\" explained Em, with a piteous deprecating glance at the strong man before her. \" My poor boy, my dear brother! \" \" Why were you set on his being a university man against the grain ? \" \" Papa was set \u2014 he was a scholar.\" \" And his son's inclinations were not a sufficient reason for his not enlisting an unwilling recruit ? \" Em winced at the blunt reflection on papa, and reminded Mr. Hatchard, gravely, \" Papa died before he could see any serious obstacle to his desire.\" \" Then what kept Mr. Cuthbert stdl at the university? \" \" Of course we kept him,\" declared Em, a little petu lantly ; \" we were not going to give up the object of papa's life without a fight for it, though Uncle Jeremy pretended that Cuthbert could never be justified in signing the Articles, for he would never be able to understand the drift of them.\" \" So you sacrificed the living to the dead ? \" Em stared. \" To the dead whose partialities and prejudices, we can trust, have passed away, so that they can see clearly at last.\" Em winked away hot, rebellious, but doubting and scared tears. \" Is your brother good for anything else, since he has come short of a smattering of scholarship ? \" \"For anything,\" repeated Em, with jealois emphasis, \" for a thousand things.\" \" For what then ? \" \"I am not prepared to say in a moment,\" said Em,"], [218, "206 LONDON PRIDE. almost crying again. \" He might not do for a public office, since he is too old to learn the routine, and he would take ill with the confinement among papers and figures, which are as uncongenial to him as books. He is too old to begin studying medicine, and though he would not mind the hardest blow himself, I have seen him run out of the house ducking his head with his hands over his ears, after he was a great boy, when our old Friar's Lynn doctor pulled out one of my teeth. He has no capital to set up a shop, yet I am sure he would not mind its coming between the wind and his gentility. He ought to have been a squire, with game to preserve, vermin to destroy, and horses and dogs to ride and rear, and train and foster ; he ought to have commanded opportunities of fishing in Norway, and shooting at the Cape, without bringing down on him the ban of exile. Now, I believe it is too late for him even to sink into a farmer, and become engrossed with his bullocks and his cocks and hens. Oh ! Mr. Hatchard, is there no way left except that Cuth bert must go away from us, across the seas, into the wilds, when mamma wid pine and die for his face, and I shall be left alone ? \" \" Would you care for me fetching him up to town, then, and having him into the Gardens, on trial ? I think I could manage it, and in my opinion it would be better worth his trouble than herding sheep \u2014 or cattle in his case \u2014 and breaking in horses on the other side of the Atlantic, while it would save him, as you say, from lying under the ban of exile.\" Em remained silent, and grew first red, and then white. Was this what Cuthbert had come to, after all ? Would her mother not feel it worse than his expatriation, and would she not consent to the one before the other ? Mr. Hatchard did not resent Em's discomfiture and what was under it. It was something peculiar in this man's despotism and jealousy that there was no meanness, and no personality in them. He even took pains to reconcile her to his proposal. \"A post in the Gardens is all that having been a Cantab has brought me to \u2014 an argument which, perhaps, comes to nothing. But these squires, into whose ranks you would elect your brother by natural affinity, who are masters of"], [219, "207 SWEET ARE THE USES OF ADVERSITT. fox-hounds and of stables of horses, and who throw open to tbe public exhibitions of the spoils of their hunts abroad, \u2014 do not hold the living spoils so much cheaper than the dead, nor esteem such a situation so lightly. It was partly through their influence that I was appointed to mine. But I would have broken stones on the high road, or opened and shut the locks of a canal. Yes, I think I should have preferred these occupations to becoming a billiard marker, a traditional class destination \u2014 not that I have any puritanical objection to billiards in the abstract, \u2014 but I rather object to class limitations ; and this post was more congenial. You spoke of congeniality : don't you think it is hard that there should be no field for those addicted to animals like your brother and myself, short of that of the trappers in the Hudson's Bay Company settle ments ? There is an Acclimatisation Society forming here, which promises something in the future, and for the pre sent the Regent's Park Gardens are not so bad. The wage is a decent pittance, a good deal surer than that derived from being a noble director of shaky and fraudu lent public companies, not to speak of its being more decently gained. The work for the higher men, who ought to be educated, calls forth energy, resource, and tact, and is a thousand times more interesting than smear ing sheep and driving bullock waggons \u2014 say in Australia \u2014 unless the sheep and the waggons happen to be one's own property. Of course it is the hope of advantage in the end which sends us to Colonies, British or Spanish ; but I hear everywhere that the chances of a university man without the smallest capital are, on the whole, nearer nil abroad than at home. I suppose I ought to warn you that the great bores with us are the vulgar sight-seer and the last marvellous sensational animal which has never been seen in this country before. But you describe your brother as popular, so probably he would relish the chaff ing, both of the booby and the beast, and they would like it at his hand. Altogether it strikes me that Mr. Rash leigh may choose a spell at our service until he has had time to look about him, without doing anything derogatory to his honour. It need not be lost time, and useless to him, though he made up his mind to go abroad eventually. We have cattle and sheep, as well as opossums and sloths,"], [220, "208 LONDON PRIDE. and it may be in his favour to get intimately acquainted with all the species.\" \"You are right and I am wrong, Mr. Hatchard,\" admitted Em, frankly and without reservation. \"But believe me, Cub is not stuck up ; and it would let the poor fellow have a taste of the desire of his heart. If he take my advice now, he will have done with rank and etiquette, if we have ever had anything to do with them \u2014 and indulge himself with his inclination, since there is no law, divine or human, which forbids it to him. Cuthbert will be heartily obliged to you, aud so wdl mamma, when she understands everything ; she may be grateful, for you will have pre served her son to her. Perhaps you and he will allow mamma and me to come to the Gardens with the rest of the public, and if we solemnly promise never, never to poke fun at sulky leopardesses, then you may keep us behind the uninitiated world on half-holidays, and give us the honour of a private introduction to your particular studies and pets.\" \" Shan't we ? \" responded Mr. Hatchard so cordially that Em was sorry that she had made the last remark by way of a small atonement. She wished, for the first time in their interview, that he would consider his good offices ended, and leave her. At the same time, Em did not know what to make of her own sudden acquisition of shyness, and was angry with herself for so school-girlish an impor tation. \" On such an occasion, too,\" Em reflected on her self wrathfully, \"when I might have had more in my head.\" But still the lodger Hngered, as if, now that he had crossed the Rubicon, he could not go back ; as d she possessed bird-lime to hold his frowning brow, big beard, and athletic, well-trained limbs fixed beside her. He was frowning so heavily again, that in spite of her late enlightenment with regard to his character, Em was a little frightened ; yet he only wanted to tell her that he thought it was but right that she should have some communications from him in return for what he had received from her, if she would be so good as to listen to them. \" Mine is not a pleasant story ; it is a hundred times more unpleasant than yours.

A connec tion of the family took me when I was very young and tried to rear and save me, his plan being to impress upon me betimes that ad men and women were sharpers as well as sinners, and that the only way to escape from them, was for each to keep his own, and give no quarter. But his deeds were better than his words. He put me into a pro fession, where I did well enough. I did not dislike the discipline, and I had an opportunity of seeing the world. It was a life among men, for I had been brought up by a man and felt like a stranger among women ; and my seniors who had wives and families, were mostly men of the old school, who had two lives, the one social and the other domestic, and they did not care to admit the young men who shared the first to become witnesses to the shifts and drawbacks of the second. I shall disgust you, I dare say, but I found the lde endurable then, though active duty and promotion came, by comparison, rarely. I should have got on in time, because I can credit \u2014 though it may sound like brag, and it may be a mistake \u2014 that the stuff was in me for getting on. At the same time the bent of those squires, to whom you said your brother ought to belong, was in me too, and I was tempted to squander my time and my means on horseflesh, setters, terriers, rabbits, wild-duck, and pigeon shooting, down to the unearthing of moles, when I was hard up for the society of my friends the beasts, because I had the nature in me that should have made me their master and owner. But when the last crash came to my people, \u2014 I have said they had been going wrong for generations, \u2014 I did not see that my safety and scathelessness were the first and the only things to be looked to in the bad business, notwithstanding that it might be quite true my patch would serve little purpose, except to make the rent worse. My opinion caused me to quarrel with my old benefactor when I did what I could not help doing, and so there was nothing for it but that I should begin life anew, apart from those with whom I had nothing in common, save the poor ties of kindred \u2014 poor indeed when they are all. I had to take care to blot out of my memory associations and ante cedents which it could not be an advantage, and which it was certainly not a pleasure, for me to remember under p"], [222, "210 LONDON PRIDE. the altered circumstances. That is about my story, Miss Rashleigh.\" Em was half adrift, and could not possibly follow him to any clear comprehension of his story in this curtailed state ment, without names of persons and places, and without dates. But of the pain of the narrative she had so keen a consciousness that she seemed to share the mortification of the proud, reserved man, who could never have brought himself to say so much to a man, but would say it to her because she had trusted him, and he wanted to justify her trust in her own eyes, by showing her that trust, like love, begets itself. Here was a generous man in his severity. Em was more agitated than he was while he spoke, and she had no idea how softly and sympathetically she said, when he had done, \" It must have been hard upon you. Life seems full of trials, but you are living down yours.\" She could only recall the scope of her words when he was gone. Mrs. Rashleigh awoke next morning to caresses, smiles, and hopeful, reassuring words. \" Cuthbert is coming, mamma ; it is good that we had not gone to him ; I should not wonder though he were here to-night.\" Mrs. Rashleigh was only half roused to recoUection, but she expressed her relief and gratitude by little pathetic half-gasps, half-sobs, and by feeble foldings of her hands. She accepted the reprieve and compensation eagerly, with out reservation. She asked no questions to expose its sandy foundation. She did not demand to see the letter this morning ; she had got enough of letters last night. She shrank from a renewal of the disappointment and anguish with a child's ignoring of deeper influences and broader results, \u2014 a touching indication of her own weak ness and weariness. When Cuthbert brought his curly-headed, bright-eyed presence on the family stage, and showed himself, distressed rather than shamed, and dutiful and loving as ever, the moment that he had escaped from his false, and was restored to his true position, and when he whispered, \" Mother, dear, I have thrown up my emigration scheme, or grand tour to the Andes, whatever you like to call it ; I am going to stay at home instead and have you and Em to take care of me,\" she pressed his hand and looked up at"], [223, "211 SWEET ARE THE USES OF ADVERSITT. him in blissful content. She put away from her the evil day, leaving Providence to provide for the rest. \" Oh ! yes, my dear, and I am sure we have much need to look after your buttons \u2014 my eyes are failing, but are there not two hanging loose, Cub ? \u2014 and to see that you lose no more studs, boy.\" How on earth did you and my mother fall on your feet in getting so jolly a lodger, since you were to keep lodgers?\" inquired Cuthbert when he had recovered his cheerfulness, and he and Em were chatting together by the parlour fire. \" Jolly ! \" exclaimed Em, in deprecation. \" Oh ! bother, Em, don't pick up a fellow's words like a schoolmaster. Of course, not jolly in the sense of singing comic songs and wearing flash waistcoats \u2014 nothing so low as that \u2014 but a fine fellow and a gentleman. How could he get up an interest in me and come down to Oxford to look me up and communicate the old lady's state to me ? She's a great deal better, isn't she, Em ? She'll come round in no time, won't she ? \u2014 now that I am with you to plague your hearts out of you, and brighten you up \u2014 that's what you women like. Captain Hatchard knows Baker and Monckton, and ever so many of the best set at Brazennose, though I observed that he did not care to renew the acquaintance. They said that he was a good fellow and should not be cut, though his half-brother did something rascally on the turf, and his father is at Hom burg out of the reach of his creditors, proposing to break the bank of the rouge-et-noir table in. the Kiirsaal, I could swear. Your Hatchard was of a different sort and mortally ashamed of the others. He sold his commission to dis charge some of the worst claims \u2014 those of old servants and tradespeople connected with the family \u2014 and then he cut the whole concern. But in place of going round with his hat in his hand to every accommodating individual in his grade to beg a secretaryship or a diplomatic office, for which he was outrageously untrained, reared as he had been by an old misanthropist and misogynist, and dis posed of by an ensigncy in a regiment, he went at once to the lower spokes of the wheel and advertised for a stewardship, and duties such as he thought he could undertake without being guilty of presumption or dis-"], [224, "212 LONDON PRIDE. honesty. No such situation turned up, and he applied to have himself recommended for a sub-managership in the Zoological Gardens which was vacant. He was nominated immediately, for he had always occupied himself with natural history, had gone a good deal about similar gardens abroad when they fell in his way, and had kept up a con nection with them. He told me some of these particulars himself, and I heard the rest \u2014 what related to his family \u2014 when I was speaking of him to Baker and Monckton. They approve highly of his notion for me, and won't fail me, good fellows that they are. They don't look down on a man for filling such a berth, besides their class are good to stand by any member of it when his back is at the wall, like sticking to the crown though it lie in a bush. The Gardens are in the cause of science, there is nothing unworthy in a post in them, it is decidedly unique, besides no better opening offers for me. My men are to come and see me the first time they . are in town, and Monckton promises me no end of rare specimens of white hares and ashen eagles from his next expedition to the Arctic regions. I expect that he will make my fortune with the Society. \" But seriously, Cuthbert, wHl you be able to bring yourself to accept such a strange calling, so different from the career that we had chalked out for you, dear? \" \" I take it that it is different,\" Cuthbert remarked composedly; \"but haven't we had enough of humbug, Em ? \u2014 profane humbug in this case, where I was to be put into a white choker without either head or ballast to wear it. I never came up to town without visiting the Gardens and looking after that old fellow of a hip popotamus; he is quite a respectable fogie now. The last time, when I found on my way back that I had missed the Australian devil and the earless sheep, I could have gone out at the next station and done the journey over again to remedy the accident. Why do you call it a strange calling ? Is it not good enough for a brick like Hatchard ? Don't even Uncle Jeremy preach about sub duing the beasts of the earth ? And I should like to know whether subduing is to be read exter mina tin o- or under standing them from tooth to claw, from hair to cellular tissue, turning them to our purposes, and introducing new varieties into these old exhausted skies and fields of ours ?"], [225, "213 SWEET ARE THE USES OF ADVERSITT. Did the man who brought in the merino sheep deserve no good of his kind ? Why, when Ij was a little fellow my greatest ambition was to grow up and own a menagerie, \" Mr. Cuthbert Rashleigh's Menagerie ! \" You must remember it, Em. My heart warms to the thought of going about among the strong and the weak, the savage and the gentle creatures which seem fresher from God's hand than we seem. I shall enjoy arranging for them, and winning their confidence^ till a lion growls to me about its Libyan wastes of sand, and the tamarind tree which sprang from the cleft of the rock and hid so long the hole into its den, and a humming bird chirps in a genteel whisper in my ear the secret of the cochineal bug at the heart of the cactus.\" Cuthbert was easily cheered, and easily depressed, but he was in earnest in his persuasion of the perfect honourable ness of the pursuit aud of the prospect of simple indepen dence which had come to him. He had never been ambitious, and the fact that Captain Hatchard shared his predilections and put them to some use, was exceedingly gratifying to Cuthbert. It served to vindicate the snubbed, derided, ruling passion of his youth, with its faithfully and fondly remembered snatches of indulgence and attainment. It freed him from the peculiarly depress ing, galhng, and demoralizing sense of incapacity and failure, of becoming a burden on his mother and sister, which had tortured him of late. That was good, yet as Cuthbert ran on in his half-forced, half-spontaneous contentment with his release and his promotion, Em's mind ceased to accompany him. Her attention wandered, she could feel disquieted and depressed on her own account, though it was no matter, and it was light-minded in her to care about it. But she had known for just twenty-four hours that she could never serve Captain Hatchard again in demure, defiant recognition of their relative positions. Yet she had thought to serve him, as she would serve Cuthbert \u2014 with her best, from pure good-will and respectful affectionate regard; to that at least he was entitled from her. Now somehow, it fell dampingly on her good intentions to be told plainly, and to have it deeply impressed upon her, that he had been far better born and bred in a worldly"], [226, "214 LONDON PRIDE. sense than she had been ; to hear that he had been an officer in the army, which was innocently held as quite an imposing rank at Friar's Lynn. What a fool Em had been all along to think of a captain in a fire-brigade when she had heard him addressed by his old title in the Gardens ! How stupid she had been not to read the signs of his old foraging cloak and cap, and of tbe keeper who had been an old soldier like his master and had come to the house with a message and announced his identity as \" The Captain's orderly, marm. Oh, dash it, his keeper now it is, though he is no more moonstruck than he ever was.\" To think that Basd Hatchard was duly acknowledged as an equal by the chivalrous Moncktons and Bakers. What value would be put on her poor offering of admiration and devotion for Cuthbert's deliverer, guardian, and model ? Contemporaneously with her self-humiliation, she was certain that he would rise above the cloud which had enveloped him, and lay the foundation of a new career, and a new house, either as a distinguished naturalist, in a new professorship when the world should adopt Thomas Carlyle's views of education, or as an explorer and pioneer sent abroad by new societies, advocating new branches of physiology, and new discoveries in and employment of the animal kingdom. But though Mr. Hatchard might be Cuthbert's friend and the making of Cuthbert, it was absurd to think that Mr. Hatchard would follow up the promptings of humanity in a strong, straights orward nature which had driven him to side with them in their distress, by being her friend. The better to cause this conviction to fulfil itself, unless its hero were as persevering as he was resolute, Em began to avoid him \u2014 now that he and Cuthbert had agreed to share the first floor \u2014 as she had not done when she was his solitary attendant. In place of going with the public in the attraction of a private interest to the Gardens, Em had determined never to set her foot within the Park; until one day, Mr. Hatchard intercepted and arrested her alone, and asked her point-blank and full of unconcealed vexation, \" Have I done anything which you object to, Miss Rashleigh ? Are you disappointed in the result of my interference on your brother's account? \""], [227, "SWEET ARE THE USES OF ADVERSITT. 215 \" Surely, no,\" Em answered him quickly, thrown off her guard. \" Even Uncle Jeremy (as we say), who has heard of it, writes that he is glad that we have recovered our wits ; he has some hope now for all of us, and Cub may go down and see him whenever he can get away. Little thanks to Uncle Jeremy, \u2014 it was you who were Cuthbert's friend, Mr. Hatchard.\" \"Your friend first,\" he said, with determination. \"I don't care to take credit for what I don't deserve. Cuth bert is a capital fellow, and I should be glad to act a friend's part by him now that I know him. I feel heartily ashamed of not having considered your mother sooner ; but it was you who opened my eyes, and proved to me, not only my harshness, but the injustice from which I had hoped that my character was free. If it had not been for you I should have gone on from bad to worse, and I should have done nothing for your famdv that I have done.\" Em contrived to escape from the speaker at this point, and so was saved from the awkwardness of arguing with him on what would have been, without certain conditions, his probable demorahzation, and on his general or indi vidual benevolence. After that conversation, however, properly supplemented as it was by Mr. Hatchard's solicitude to avad himself of Em's society, by the smoothing of the knit on his brow and the gleaming of a smile through his beard, when his eye rested upon her or his ear heard her, \u2014 Em wisely ceased to harass herself about her lodger's superior extrac tion,\" his renounced rank, his persistent friends among the Bakers and Moncktons. On the contrary her own glance beamed brightly and bonnily, her voice sang and laughed in ordinary speech, her foot tripped as she went about the business of the household, dividing her service between Mr. Hatchard and Cuthbert, being their careful clever housekeeper, their constant confidant and adviser, and an interested unwearied auditor of the annals of the Gardens, with their wild, terrible, beautiful, curious, far-gathered charge. In October, when unfashionable London had long ago returned from its sea-side and country lodgings, and fashionable London in public offices was only then claim-"], [228, "216 LONDON PRIDE. ing its holidays, fain to spend them in pacing stubble and turnip-fields and beating brushwood, Mr. Hatchard was nominated to the staff of the Acclimatization Society, and Cuthbert stepped into his friend's old shoes. Then the Rashleighs' lodger sought to persuade Mrs. Rashleigh that to join together two purses and two households would be a great deal better than continuing to play at the farce of lodging-house keeper and lodger. If she would give him the title of son-in-law she need not fear that either Em or herself would fail to be provided for, so long as he was strong in body and in mind, and could work and plan for their maintenance and comfort. That was saying nothing of Cuthbert, who was now a Httle jealous of anybody but himself doing anything to support his mother, at least, and who contributed his proportion of the family funds with a half -boyish pride and exultation, after what he styled his dead lock and awful mess at Oxford. Basil Hatchard no more dreaded to connect himsed with a poor family, and to help to carry them to safety, with the filial fidelity of the old heathen, on his broad shoulders, than he had dreaded to come out of his rank on the down fall of his own family. He had scorned to haunt like a dismal repining ghost the scenes of old traditional con ventional station, scorned to be dependent on any man, by becoming a hanger-on and parasite (these were the only situations, by the by, which the stern man did scorn) \u2014 but had availed himself of the gdt which he possessed to be the founder of a new family, and the architect of new fortunes. With such an end in view, and with other inclinations and attainments, this man would not have hesitated to become fencing, drawing, or singing master, master on board a yacht, gamekeeper, or gardener, counting that revolutions in families, like revolutions in nations, are sent to awaken men to their shortcomings, by forcing them to resign their class immunities and to return to primitive obligations \u2014 practising in earnest what they have learnt as amateurs \u2014 and earning their bread in the sweat of their brows. Em's mother, timid as she was, had implicit trust in their lodger at last, and readily promised not to fear for the future when she had his heavy brow and square jaw at"], [229, "217 SWEET ARE THE USES OF ADVERSITT. her back. She agreed to see in him not only a bride groom for Em, who should elevate her early into the blessedness and honour of the marriage state, and shed upon her mother reflected lustre, but the most gallant and trustworthy of gently born bridegrooms, who had come scatheless out of the fire \u2014 only tempered by it \u2014 and converted his adversity into the beginning of the most enduring of prosperities. Had not Basil Hatchard helped to make a man of Mrs. Rashleigh's Cuthbert, by showing the world that there had been meaning in his strong steadfast loves and hates, which had brought the boy such eager joy and dull trouble, by streams and hedge rows, and at school desks and on college floors ? Had he not brought the lad out of the slough of idleness and hope lessness into which he was sinking, and saved him from the selfish expatriation to which he, the widow's only son and Em's only brother, the natural manly head, and shield of the f amdy, had in despair doomed himself ? Em did not refuse her consent to the contract, for the very good reason that her consent was already pledged and sealed, and that she would sooner die now than dis avow her allegiance to her old mystery, bugbear, and tyrant of a lodger."], [230, "LOVE LIES BLEEDING. (ABIGAIL.) CHAPTER I. THE MURDERER. The distinction of the Howes' drawing-room was its old fashioned rosiness : wreaths of rose-buds, with a border of tiny rose leaves on a white ground for the paper on the walls ; little groups of roses in imitation moss for the design of the carpet ; rose-coloured damask, and rosewood furniture, and dried rose leaves in pink china bowls on the card-tables. It was a drawing-room where \" I'd be a butterfly\" might have been sung appropriately, as Hke our grandmother's pretty hacknied idea of a rose bower as possible. There was a little reflection of the rosiness, full-blown and of the cabbage-rose variety (but the rose by the name of cabbage does not fad to smell sweet, in fact smells sweetest of all), on Mrs. Howe's matron cheeks ; and the olive moire gown which she wore on the occasion of a dinner-party, given by the principal attorney in Ashley to a newly married couple, stood for the green leaves. There was no rosiness about Mr. Howe, who stood dis played on the hearth-rug \u2014 like the carpet, a mass of roses \u2014 composing his mind to his fate as host, except that he was just the bald, bent-headed, pale-complexioned business man in irreproachable black broad-cloth, watered silk vest, neat pearl pin, and large white cornelian seal at his watch guard, to own such a rosy drawing-room."], [231, "THE MURDERER. 219 The girl in the black lace dress \u2014 one of those happily chosen dresses which have a simple, graceful character in any situation, with the little refined, intelligent face, delicate nostrils, sensitive mouth, fine low brow, and brightly bronzed hair (the one thing bright about her), was also the girl, by several steps more advanced in cultivation than her father and mother, likely to be the daughter of a rosy drawing-room. One might as soon have expected to find a grave in a flower-garden as the trace of a tragedy on such a stage, and among the dramatis person\u0153 of a harmless, respectable family group. But there are social tragedies performed in honest circles, from the queen's court to the cook's kitchen. A poor little woman's happiness had been murdered in that rosy drawing-room as certainly as ever hapless elderly gentleman was knocked on the head in a radway carriage. More than that, the breathless corpse was buried in the familiar haunt; and the three persons present were treating the fact which was no secret, according to their natural instincts. Mrs. Howe was covering the grave and pretending that it had never been, as a daisy will perk up its head on the turf by a path no longer trodden, and a kettle sing by a hearth when other songs are silent. Mr. Howe, whom Mrs. Howe had lived with in the nearest relation for five-and-twenty years, and knew no better at the end of them than to declare of him that Mr. Howe, like all other married, middle-aged men of business, had not a particle of sentiment (it is to be con jectured that Mrs. Howe associated sentiment with down on the upper lip, fancy straw hats, shooting and yachting jackets, and mutinous assertions of \" I won't go home till morning\"), planted his square-toed, glossy black shoes, doggedly on the trampled down, withered spot. He had never praised his daughter to her face in his life, hardly ever behind her back ; but he had rated his girl so highly in the shrine of his thoughts, that he would have had it an honour for the first man in the country to win her regard. He would have had her stand so far above every man that she should have shown favour to none except upon a humble and assiduous suit. He had been in his gruffness sdently, austerely chivalrous on the points of"], [232, "220 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. women and love affairs ; and he had not wished his only child, for whom he had provided, and who was the Hght of his eyes, married away from him. But the customs of society and women were against him. Now he stood there prepared to shake the hand, and share his bread and salt with the man who had wronged him in the tenderest quarter, and that not with any feeling of forgiveness, but in self-defence and to prevent gossip, like the coarse hand ling of a wound. He had never mentioned the subject to his daughter, hardly ever to his wife \u2014 to his mind there was degradation in the idea ; but as he stood there in his plain quiet pride and bitterness, he whom Mrs. Howe would no more have suspected of match-making than the judge on the circuit, or the bishop come for a confirmation, was turning over impatiently in his thoughts whether there were any young fellow about Ashley who had ever shown incipient symptoms of admiration for Abigail, which might be fostered and developed, if the young fellow were only manly and upright, though his worldly position was but tolerable, into a grand passion and a declaration of marriage. A speedy marriage with a man who could love and cherish her, was the thing the most to be desired for Abigail and for them all, and he had lived long enough to welcome it. For Abigail Howe, the girl in the black lace dress, with the little refined face, she sat and listened to her mother remarking how well she was looking, running over the names of the young people who were expected along with the married couples, and foretelling how much they would enjoy themselves. She ignored the grave which concerned her so nearly, but sat and looked at it nevertheless, with a keen intensity of vision, like an additional sense, while she was professing to draw on her gloves ; and at the same time she felt inconsistently as d the corpse that grave contained were again led out alive to be shot or stabbed. The first ring at the door-bell brought not the Bing hams from the Hanger \u2014 Humphrey used to be first \u2014 but Humphrey Bingham's partner in the factory. Tom Prior was a man thirty-three years by the register, but much younger-looking, the son of an old confidential clerk of the Binghams, with a great, honest admiration for Humphrey. He had frank and genial qualities of his own when he was"], [233, "THE MURDERER. 221 quite at his ease ; but he was seldom at his ease in com pany, otherwise he was a quiet gentlemanlike fellow when his shyness did not get the better of him, and when he did not make a desperate, unsuccessful, unbecoming effort to conceal it by being noisy, doing his mind an injustice as he habitually did his body, tall and swinging, by dressing half in a shabby, half in an outre fashion, and by wearing a tremendous black beard and whiskers \u2014 one of these hairy adornments being more than sufficient for his dark, thin, persistently boyish face, with its gentle mouth and pair of earnest, eager eyes. After paying his respects incoherently to Mr. and Mrs. Howe, Tom Prior drifted rather wildly towards Abigad and settled down beside her, giving her the trouble of making conversation for him, while she saw him already putting forth his restless, uncanonical hand and dis arranging the dahHas and ferns which she had grouped in the flower-glass. He answered her in monosyUables, till all at once he dashed into extravagant encomiums on Mrs. Humphrey Bingham, and called on Abigail to second his admiration and confirm his opinion that Mrs. Humphrey was the very wife for Humphrey, worthy of Humphrey, and Humphrey worthy of her. Abigail did not attribute her companion's talk to maHce ; she was aware, with aU Ashley, that Tom Prior was the greatest blunderer as well as the cleverest fellow in the town ; extraordinarily obtuse on some points, exceedingly simple on others, liable to obstinate delusions and odd vagaries. She did not take it dl in Tom Prior that he should thus taunt her. She knew that he saw nothing wrong that Humphrey did, that Tom was content to be the working partner in the factory, and had a genuine pride in the country-gentleman pursuits and accomplish ments which came as naturally to Humphrey Bingham, as if he had been born to them. \" Have you seen Humphrey's bay horse, Miss Howe ? \" Tom used to ask, breathlessly, before Humphrey had a wife to be praised ; \" weU, did you ever see such an animal ? Steps as high as my head, and Humphrey manages it as if it were a donkey.\" Abigail was not angry ; she answered Tom in a soft, gracious manner, which brought a dusky flush into aU that"], [234, "222 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. was seen of Tom's cheek, caused him to champ the ends of his whiskers and beard fiercely, and sent his wistful eyes to the toes of his worn boots, that had a trick of protruding in an ungainly manner from his dress trousers. These trousers, with his coat, had been so ingeniously ill-folded, that they were creased from wrist to heel ; he might have been sleeping in them for a week ; they might as well have been out at the elbows and frayed at the feet, for any effect, either of a fine income or a careful toilette, that they were calculated to produce on the public. Tom had brought the conversation to an abrupt full stop as impulsively as he had begun it. The next ring ushered in the three Miss Mainwarings \u2014 old friends of Mrs. Howe's \u2014 ladies of a certain, or rather an uncertain, age. They had been kind to Abigail from childhood, and were without reservation excellent women. It was not their fault that the established costume of the day would not suffer them to cover their poor, bald, and grey heads decently, and that their single state and narrow income forced them to have many masculine cares, as well as small worries, and yet shut them out from wide interests, bright, breezy, crowded prospects in Hfe. But the result was that their voices had now a sharp, now a thin tone, and their chat was of Ashley \u2014 mostly of what could be seen of it from the Miss Mainwarings' windows \u2014 dribbles of chronicles local and domestic, such as that Mrs. Leech's sister had arrived by the train that afternoon after all, and not put off her visit another week as Mrs. Leech had feared ; and it was to be apprehended that old Mr. Reeve's cough was worse, for his little boy was heard ringing Dr. Lewis's surgery-bell as early as seven o'clock that morning. Blameless, contented woman ! yet it recurred to Abigail's mind with invincible repugnance that one of the Miss Mainwarings was said to have met with a \" disappoint ment\" in her youth. Leaping to a conclusion, Abigail speculated in the the intervals of her halting conversa tion with Tom Prior, whether she too would draw down and drag in her upper lip, or put up her handkerchief to her month every time that she laughed to hide two false teeth, like Miss Bella Mainwaring. Would she stiffen her front fingers past the second joints with the hereditary rings of the Mainwarings, and feel as confident that the"], [235, "THE MURDERER. 223 rings compensated for, and cast a distinguished lustre over, a second-rate, ill-made, drab poplin gown, as Miss Main waring did. The Miss Mainwarings were followed in quick succession by Mr. and Mrs. Porteous \u2014 a rich couple, who had come to Ashley Lodge and grumbled loudly because they had more money than they could spend and no children to spend it. Then came little Mrs. Dudgeon and her husband, who occupied Ashley Cottage until old Mr. Dudgeon should die and vacate the Bank House, and who groaned deeply because they had not enough money to live upon and no end of children to make away with it, but did not think of presenting any of the olive-branches to the Porteouses, as the world sardonically suggested. After the Dudgeons walked Mr. Bellairs, the scrupulous vicar, thin-lipped, weak-eyed, white-eyelashed \u2014 so engrossed with the anise and cumin of minor forms and creeds that it was morally impossible \u2014 reckoning by the average age of man and not by the centuries of the patriarchs \u2014 he could, in the course of one life, arrive at the weightier matters of the law. After Mr. BeUairs sauntered Mrs. Vallance, the rich widow without an encumbrance, whom everybody in Ashley barefacedly and unblushingly courted by a kind of super stitious idolatry, expecting no gain from her spare cash (those were most attentive who needed her money least), since she was neither hospitable, handsome, witty, nor amiable, but was oppressively pompous and drearily slow both in body and mind. The two Lewis girls, Abigail's companions, whose father, the old plodding doctor, had been called to the country as usual, were nearly last of all. Abigail felt most uncomfortable with respect to the Mainwarings and the Lewises. When Miss Margy Main waring, the fat, sympathetic sister of the spinsters, sat close to Mrs. Howe and whispered confidentially to her, glancing significantly at Abigail, how could Abigail tell that Miss Margery was only observing that dear Abigail was looking lovely to-night. That black lace dress never got a bit worse. Then she was hinting, with preventive caution, that Mr. Tom Prior seemed much struck by her ; he would not get up from his seat by the young lady of the"], [236, "224 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. house ; he had not offered to relinquish his chair to either of them. If Mr. and Mrs. Howe did not approve of attentions in that quarter \u2014 though Miss Margery was dis posed to regard Mr. Tom with favour as a very fair rising fish, particularly now that other fish were out of the sea \u2014 the present was the time to nip them in the bud. Abigail was terrified lest Miss Margery should be taking advantage of old friendship to presume to pity her and to dare to abuse him with, \"How well she is keeping up, poor dear ! \" and, \" and I wonder what the fellow wdl think ? \" The Lewises were in reality principally taken up with the bride \u2014 what she would wear; it was said she had brought over the most recherche gowns from Paris, but perhaps she would think them too good for an Ashley dinner ; whether she would be frank and good-natured as well as beautdul and wealthy, and have people at the Hanger, and chaperon Ashley girls occasionally to assize balls and breakfasts ? If Abigail had been able to call all her wits about her, she might have judged that the story of Humphrey Bing ham and Abigail Howe was already out of date to girls who had their own destinies to settle, and their own fortunes hanging in the balance. If they had been jilted they would either have refused to meet the jilter, fallen dl and had the diversion of being ordered away from Ashley for change of air and scene, or they would have paraded their carelessness and made a dead set with their hearts on the rebound at Humphrey Bingham's partner. But though Tom Prior was unheroically fond of being made up to, drawn out, and met half way \u2014 it saved him such laborious exertion and agonies of nervousness \u2014 and was in danger of being boisterous with accommodating girls in Swiss bodices and Jenny Lind curls, like the Lewises, he did not respond to any advances to-night, but hung back, and, as the Miss Mainwarings expressed it, would not give up his seat by the young lady of the house, and his opportunity, if Mr. Howe did not name another man, of taking her down to dinner. It would have been well for Abigail's self-respect if she had been able to forget how the Lewises had been given to teasing her about Humphrey Bingham. They had been in the habit of coming to her with intelligence that they had"], [237, "225 THE MURDERER. met Humphrey Bingham with his skates over his shoulder, or his cricket-bat in his hand, and he had stopped them to inquire whether there would be any ladies on the pond or in the field, and they had replied that they were going to Church Street and they would speak of it to Miss Howe, and he had charged them to do so, and that he would be on the look-out to take them on the ice or into the Gate. The Lewises had been sure that the news would be accept able, and it had been acceptable. Abigail had been angry at first, and she had never felt inclined to tell the Lewises her secrets, but she had ended by liking nothing better than such idle, half-jesting communications. She had been so foolishly fond of Humphrey Bingham, that the mere sound of his name \u2014 and she could detect it across the hum of a crowded room \u2014 had been welcome. It had been pleasant, however idiotically pleasant \u2014 pleasanter than anything would ever be in the world again, \u2014 to hear Criss or Sophy Lewis so much as wind up their rambling descriptions of places that they had been at with, \" and your friend Humphrey Bingham was there.\" And in the end it would have been a blessing if Abigail's memory had been as short as Humphrey's and the Lewises. At last came the carriage from the Hanger, and the couple were half-way up the staircase. Criss Lewis was commenting that new masters \u2014 or mistresses in this case \u25a0 \u2014 made new laws. Tom Prior was springing up to do honour to Mr. and Mrs. Humphrey Bingham, as if their host and hostess were not sufficient. Mr. and Mrs. Howe were coming forward \u2014 Mr. Howe ceremoniously, Mrs. Howe really cordially \u2014 she could not be anything but cordial, as the cabbage-rose could not do anything, save smell sweet. And Abigad was rising, with her head swimming, her hands growing cold as ice, her very lips feeling cold as they whitened. But it was a wise stanch little head, which she must hold high and carry bravely, though the Spartan boy's wolf was in her woman's breast, under the folds of the black lace ; and there were two mocking voices, one at each ear, teUing her in different tones, \" Oh fie, Abigail, to fear to meet a married man ! \" and \" he never said in so many words, ' Abigad, wid you be my wife ? ' \" Humphrey, with his wde on his arm, unchanged, only"], [238, "226 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. blushing a little as he caught Abigail's eye ; big, broad shouldered Humphrey, who made Tom Prior look like a lath beside him; Humphrey, with his masses of tawny hair and beard, sunlit like Abigail's, and which had set the fashion to Tom Prior, but which caused Tom's facial forest to look grim by comparison, was a great blue-eyed fellow. He had a presence full of strength, frankness, and kindness, and of the inconsiderateness of a child. He owned plenty of sense and of an intellect not without a heavy trenchant power, but in his case reflection and penetration were, except by instinct, nil. There was the murderer with his murder sitting lightly upon him, as may be the case with most murderers, remorse being probably a popular fiction, like poetic justice ; and certainly, if having had no evil intent could bring down the accusation against him to manslaughter, Humphrey was entitled to an acquittal. It was trying \u2014 that first shaking hands with Abigad Howe : when the last time that he had clasped the cold fingers he had detained them in his broad palm, in that rosy drawing-room too, under the impression that he would hold them thus, figuratively, through life, and he was sure Abigail had known what was in his mind. But if so, why had she done nothing to detain him ? A straw would have kept him by Her side then, a word would have caused him to commit himself ; or why had she not gone on that visit which he had wished her to pay to the Southcotes \u2014 friends of both of them \u2014 when he would have joined her, and would have almost to a certainty declared himself, beyond recall, before following his mother and sisters into Greenshire ? Instead of that, she had allowed him to go away among influences confessedly hostile to her, well aware all the time that he was an easy going fellow, who would do anything for peace. Some women were so cold and prudish, and they must take the consequences. Then he had met Alice, his beautiful high spirited Alice, who had made no bones of bringing him to her feet, and there was the end of it. He supposed that most men found it awkward to meet some girls after marriage : for his part, there were other girls in different parts of the country whom he would not care to see for an interval, any more than Abigail Howe ;"], [239, "THE MURDERER. 227 though he was thankful that there was no one else who could somehow cut him up in the middle of his happiness, and cost him a horrid disagreeable incomprehensible feeling as if he regretted what he had done, and yearned for something different, when he had been very proud and glad to win Alice, and when she suited him perfectly ; en abled him, too, to quit the Factory any day, and go in for no end of improvements on the dear old Hanger. He was a fool for his pains. Abigail Howe was far too strait laced, too delicate-minded, too good and guileless, poor soul, to waste regrets upon a married man ; she had never cared much for him, or she might have had him, that was the fact ; he was willing to acknowledge it, mortifying as it was to his vanity. She had been too good for him \u2014 not that AHce was not good, but Alice's goodness was more like his own, more in the way of the world. There was Humphrey's manly, comely figure and face lighting up Abigad's eyes, and his ringing voice making music in her ears, as they had been wont to do ; and Abigail's crown of sorrow was that they could not darken to her gaze and make discord of sound, or cause her to hate him. For what ? There had been no deliberate treachery. It had been in the essence of Humphrey's con stitution to be light and fickle, to forget and amuse him self, to desert and replace her by another. He was the same Humphrey whom Abigail had all along known and loved ; it was her own fault if she had loved him, being unworthy : and how could she begin hating him now simply because the defects of his character had been directed against her and had reduced her to despair ? In place of hating him, it gave her exquisite pain, as a con sideration by itself, that Humphrey should be vexed and abashed to come to Church Street, that he should keep away from her, and dislike to encounter her ; that he should begin to hate her, when she would do anything in the world at this moment to spare him pain, even to save his little finger from aching. Neither could one little ceremony, however sacred and fatal, reverse the tide in which her nature had been flowing for many months, and efface all accumulated influences and associations. He would have been Humphrey Bing ham to Abigail all the same though he had become a Tur_c,"], [240, "228 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. and been privileged to appear with a hundred wives \u2014 the man Abigail had thought of and dreamt of, and been foolishly glad to meet with, and foolishly sad to part from, during two of her twenty years of lde. There was Humphrey, and there on his strong caressing arm was the woman who had supplanted Abigail, she who filled the proud and happy place from which Abigail was shut out, to continue the much-thought-of daughter in the dull stifling house in Church Street, and grow in time old, narrow, a great deal more to be pitied than the Miss Main- warings \u2014 for there were three of them. Mrs. Humphrey had thought it worth while to dress well. She wore a pink silk gown trimmed with black velvet, and had a set of topazes on her neck and arms. The soft pink, so much more delicate than the rosiness of Mrs. Howe's drawing-room, and the black velvet, became her beauty admirably. She was a beautiful woman of one and twenty, with the silkiest black hair, large, well-opened, dark-grey eyes, and a rich creamy white and pure pale pink complexion. She had a tall, elegant figure, rounded and undulating in its slenderness, and was a handsome creature, even to those daintiest tapering hands and those arched and fairy feet. She was lively ; the waiting com- pany could hear her voice chattering and laughing with Humphrey before the door was opened, and she soon showed a habit of arching and depressing her somewhat marked black brows, and shrugging her sloping shoulders, which the Ashley people in their primitiveness called French- looking. But there was no affectation about her ; there might be a Httle air of self-satisfaction, an anticipation of the sensation which she would create when she entered the room, as if she claimed it as a right \u2014 nothing more. She was very self-possessed for so young a married woman, more so than Humphrey was for a married man \u2014 but then there were drawbacks where Humphrey was \"concerned, \u2014 \u25a0 and she was very affable for a beauty, an heiress, well born as she was wealthy. There was no haughtiness about Mrs. Humphrey, she intended to make herself agreeable : per haps the intention was a shade too apparent, but that was an amiable weakness ; and all the eyes upon her noted that she was particularly friendly to her husband's partner, Tom Prior, as he made reverent salaams before her, and betrayed"], [241, "THE MURDERER. 229 an ardent desire to kiss the ground which she and Humphrey trod upon. In short, young Mrs. Humphrey Bingham came, saw, and conquered the little circle which she chose, Hke an acute young woman, to conquer. Abigail Howe was ready to gratify Tom Prior by assent ing with quiet conviction to his fervent and exulting protestations that Mrs. Humphrey, take her aU in all, was the most charming woman he had ever come across, and Mrs. Humphrey was Humphrey's. Mrs. Humphrey had no objection to being Humphrey's. In her conversation \u2014 and she talked a great deal in return for Mr. Howe's polite monosyllables on the one side of her, and Miss Mainwaring's little speeches on the beauty of the neighbourhood, the convenience of the markets, and Dr. Lewis's disinclination to be questioned about his patients, on the other \u2014 there were incessant allusions to Humphrey, or \" my husband,\" or the Hanger. She appealed more than once to Humphrey as to an authority at her com mand. \" Humphrey, please tell Mr. Howe how they dredge for oysters on the French coast.\" \"Humphrey, you remember the name of the gentleman connected with Ashley who crossed the Simplon along with us ? \" Abigail had it dinned into her ears that Humphrey belonged to another ; but it was the strangest thing of all to hear the favoured stranger alluding to persons and places about Ashley of which Humphrey had told her, and making garbled statements of the events of the past year which Abigail knew a thousand times better than she knew them. \" That Aberwich road where Mr. Bingham met his fall following the hounds.\" Po >h ! it was not the Aber wich but the Haverton road which it had turned Abigail sick to pass for weeks after the accident. \" The week my sister Millicent spent at the Hanger last winter.\" It was not Humphrey's sister Millicent, but Fanny, who had stayed ten days at Bachelor's Hall, as Humphrey had called it, and had begged Abigail to keep her company part of the time, and who had professed to like Abigail very much as her friend, though she had opposed her with all her might when there was a chance of Abigail's being her sister. And it had not been that Fanny and the women of the family were in any way dependent on"], [242, "230 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. Humphrey, but because the match with Abigail Howe was not one projected by Humphrey's sisters, Fanny and Co., and because he might do a great deal better \u2014 and he had done a great deal better as they would reflect triumphantly. Abigail wondered with a vague wonder whether she would have thus publicly asserted her possession of Humphrey, and if by any chance she could have as glibly mangled similar carelessly picked-up details. There were two particulars which Abigail discovered with regard to Mrs. Humphrey before the company rose from the dinner-table. First, the young wife had a great deal to say which was not very much worth hearing, unless because it was the generally inoffensive and occa sionally airy gossip of a pretty, pleasant, cultivated woman. Secondly, although her dialect was refined and her articulation correct, there was something slightly harsh in the tones of her voice, which were bass like a man's, and might form a good second in a song, but were a little startling and not without a strain of coarseness in the beautiful, elegant young woman, who was so insensible to her own gifts except as means to an end, yet who enjoyed with a keen appreciation being a bride, \u2014 Humphrey Bing ham, the handsome, well-to-do, cordial young squire of the Hanger's envied bride. As the dinner wore on, the constraint of the principal persons in the party lessened. Even Abigail felt as if she had grown accustomed to the scene, and as if it were not only a necessity, but the natural order of things, that she should be sitting there answering intelligibly, now and then, to Tom Prior's eccentric spurts of conversation on factories, Shakspeare, or fieldfares ; attending as far as she could manage it to the entertainment of the guests ; venturing to draw Miss Bella Mainwaring and the scru pulous curate into a nearer approach to social intercourse ; gently arousing Tom Prior to the knowledge that he was turning his back on Sophy Lewis, who was pouting and eating her pheasant behind that section of him, sufficient to throw her into the shade. Abigail felt that she ought to be flattered when Mrs. Humphrey selected her as her companion in the drawing room and poured into Abigail's ears all her good-humoured,"], [243, "THE MURDERER. 231 complacent, half-girlish, half-womanly stories. If Abigail was not angry with Humphrey, far less was she angry with Mrs. Humphrey. She had even a pitiful sense of Mrs. Humphrey's ignorance of the pain which she was inflicting, at the very moment that Abigail was experi encing that there are worse deaths than those of shoot ing or stabbing, namely, those of being pricked and probed by inches, or tickled into convulsions, as Mrs. Humphrey ran on about her home at the Hanger, with which Abigail's imagination was familiar as with Paradise, the gate of which had been shut on the first woman. (But she had had a great compensation, for Adam had gone out with Eve.) Mrs. Humphrey questioned Abigail on the capabilities of Ashley for gaiety, and then there followed rapidly, \" Humphrey told me that he gave a ball last year. Oh, you must have been at it ; tell me all about it.\" What a vivid comprehension Abigail had of the im possibdity of complying with the request and of the astounding and endless information which she should have had to give ! It was then that Abigail had been staying with Fanny Bingham, to help her with the pre parations ; and Humphrey, too, had helped so zealously, that Fanny was constantly scolding him away from depart ments in which he could have had no experience, and where his presence could be of no possible use. Even after the company were ready to assemble, he would not let the ladies go away to dress, or get up himself from what Fanny described as a gipsy tea in the library, until she employed sisterly dihgence on him ; and after that he came and knocked at Abigail's door with her bouquet. (Was it wrong of her to keep some of the white American primroses pressed and dried yet ?) \"It was a very successful ball,\" Abigail answered, dis creetly; \" Miss Pierrepoint was the beauty.\" \"And Humphrey danced a great deal with her? I know he has a weakness for beauties,\" exclaimed Mrs. Humphrey, with a little conscious laugh. \" He was always admiring the pretty women whom we met; but I would not pay him the compliment of being jealous.\" No, Humphrey had not shown his weakness on the night in question. In spite of his duties as a host, he had"], [244, "232 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. danced oftenest with a girl who was better than a beauty to those who could read her little delicate face, but who was not an acknowledged beauty amongst other girls. Mrs. Humphrey's chat went off upon her wedding tour in foreign countries, which Abigail had craved to visit when her heart was a living, craving heart, and of which Humphrey had told her much ; for he had been fond of making rushes to the Continent as Tom Prior had afforded him leisure to do. How familiar the names sounded !\u2014 the Louvre, Versailles, Strasburg, the Drachenfels, the Castle of Heidelberg, Lausanne, Geneva. How familiar, yet with what an altered signification, since Humphrey had spoken of them with a decided implication that they two should one day visit them together ! Never, now, never ! Mrs. Humphrey going back \u2014 with words in which there was a weary murmur of other times \u2014 not so distant in space, but so wide apart in sensation, arrived at length at the great event of her Hfe, her wedding, and was pro ceeding on more and more dangerous ground, with Abigail quite incapable of stopping her, when Humphrey and the other gentlemen came into the drawing-room. Even the most independent young wives of the most gallant hus bands look a little put out when they are caught in their favourite narrative within three months of the event. It was an unspeakable relief to Abigail when Mrs. Humphrey said hastily, \" I'll tell you all about it another time, Miss Howe,\" blushed, and was actually silent for three minutes, turning over a book of engravings. Humphrey had got up his spirits. It is only the first step which costs, and to him the first step was taken. All the torment of reminiscences were over and done for him, when they commenced afresh, with redoubled force, for Abigail. For it was in the rosy drawing-room \u2014 when the rosiness now so artificial seemed natural, but was neither of that of earth nor sky, and certainly not of the mock pastoral sort, as displayed in antiquated upholstery \u2014 that he had spent most time when he was courting her. There he had leant against the work-table, and looked at her making believe to work for an hour at a time. Some of the books were on the book-tray which he had so often turned over as an excuse to detain him a little longer ; but"], [245, "233 THE MURDERER. Humphrey was not a book-man, and had doubtless for gotten their names and covers. Among the flowers in the stand was the very wavy-leafed fern, which he had sought and brought for her all the way from the Irish lakes. What a happy evening that had been, when he had gone straight to Church Street, brown and travel-soiled, in place of going home to the Hanger ; and the two had planted the fern, and he had stayed to supper and returned to his own house and his housekeeper, after his three weeks' absence, at twelve o'clock at night ! Well, the poor wavy leafed fern was not to blame, and Abigail had never found it in her heart to cast it from her stand. Mrs. Humphrey had everything : might not Abigail have a fern and a few withered primroses ? But Humphrey remembered none of these things. He was frank and accessible by nature ; and, as a rolling stone going about the world, he was constantly making friends, and constantly making use of their friendship. Good hearted as Humphrey was, perhaps the bloom of his heart had been rubbed off in the friction of many slight ties \u2014 perhaps his heart had never really had any bloom so sing as to be rubbed off. Without doubt he had passed through a crowd of impressions. The only perfectly fresh ones which he had received since he grew up, and which were inevi tably of greater depth and importance than any that he had received for a long time previously, had been made within the last six months. So there Humphrey was addressing Abigail and his wife in the same breath, forbidding Mrs. Humphrey to sing any more because her chest had not been strong since she had caught a bad cold at Munich. \" You know, Alice, I can't have you ill again.\" \" Nonsense, Humphrey,\" Alice pro tested, in comical indignation, \"it was the merest touch of bronchitis ; why, auntie herself would not have been frightened. Could you have guessed that a great big fellow like him would have got nervous, and plagued three people, himself, the doctor, and me, for six coughs ? \" fiumphrey was too much of a gentleman and a man of sense to make a fool of himself and his wife, and to affront the company by a display of matrimonial felicity. But straws show how the wind blows, and showed his feelings naturally to demonstrativeness. It might have been patent"], [246, "234 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. to the most indifferent observer that Mrs. Humphrey's fortune had been the least of her attractions in her hus band's eyes. He was both proud and fond of his wife, and was triumphant in his success. Abigail, who said to herself that she had a hundred eyes and ears to-night, noticed that he applied with his eyes to his wife some of the songs which Tom Prior insisted on Abigail's singing, standing by her and neglecting to turn over the pages of her music, whde Humphrey lounged against the piano, his side to Abigail, and his face to his wife. Mrs. Humphrey put a stop to the proceeding by instituting a parallel between herself and Abigad. She took up the sheets of music. \" My name begins with A too, Miss Howe, and I write it short also, ' A. Bingham,' as Humphrey writes ' H. Bingham.' I don't see why I should be at the trouble of writing 'Alice,' when he does not put 'Humphrey,' although he says it is as if the A stood for Alick or Antony, and I were his brother ; and he scolded me before we were married for not signing my full name at the end of my notes \u2014 do you remember Humphrey ? I see you write ' A. Howe ' in the same way.\" Not quite in the same way. Alice and Abigail were very different names (to Abigail it seemed that the differ ence was significant), and she had learned to make Abigail A., not in merry mischief or to copy a favourite example, not even to save trouble, but when as a foolish girl she had been a little ashamed of David's wife's name, appropriated as it had been by Mrs. Masham and the entire class of waiting-maids. Abigail felt as if her very name had been against her, yet it had not sounded amiss \u2014 not in its quaint American form when Humphrey had audaciously shortened it to Miss Abby, and she had fancied once that it would have had a redeeming glory as A. Bingham. Alice had robbed her of her very name. The last glimpse which Abigail had of Humphrey was bending forward to the laughing face, so lovely in its scarlet hood, while he wrapped Mrs. Humphrey in her rugs as the carriage drove off and disappeared in the dusky darkness of the September night. Paradise vanished with the couple to Abigail. The Miss Mainwarings walked home under the wing of"], [247, "THE MURDERER. 235 Tom Prior, their little maid walking demurely behind them. The Lewises pulled each an arm of their patient father, \u2014 turned up from his last country call. Mrs. Vallance deliberately composed her share of the one solemn sentence which she was to exchange with the Vicar in two streets' length. Mrs. Porteous and Mrs. Dudgeon strove in vain to enlighten darkened minds (each working on her friend's husband) on the respective burdens of childless ease and many-childed struggles, and entered the lodge and the cottage, Mrs. Porteous to discover that the evening post had brought her the overwhelming disappointment of an apology from the friends whose visit she had counted upon for helping her and Porteous to get rid of the burden of their autumn; and little Mrs. Dudgeon, that her absence had put the head sheaf on her stack of worries \u2014 so disproportioned to the size of the woman ; since her fourth boy, Algernon, had taken the liberty of falling down a flight of stairs, and little Charlotte had been so lost to consideration as to swallow a pin. Abigail's strength failed her in an instant, and she crept with slow, lagging steps, without saying a word, to her room for the night. The terrible ordeal of forming the target to be shot at by the flights of arrows of common curiosity, commiseration, and a little contempt, and of the silent, single, more deadly darts of retrospection, longing, and despair, was over. But Abigail had lived long enough to know that the worst was to come. Woman's griefs are like ghosts, which wait for the dark night or the grey morning to troop round her soul. They drove Abigail from her sleepless pillow, and compelled her to pace up and down restlessly, but stealthdy, lest she should disturb her father and mother, first huddling on her dressing-gown and slippers, because she must not on any account be iU at this period of her life, and then, \"walking up and pacing down,\" living all the purgatory of the evening over again with a tenfold life. She, the pure, tender girl, reproaching her self, hating herself because of her human nature, praying to God to forgive her, rocking herself wearily, wringing her hands in anguish, writhing with shame, crying dumbly, \" Oh ! Humphrey, Humphrey ; neither in this world, nor beyond the stars. Given up by you, of your own free"], [248, "236 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. will, another woman your love, your wife ; and I loved and love you, Humphrey, \u2014 how much \u2014 your mother, who hated me without a cause, might \u2014 no other woman, not the happy woman you love, could fathom.\" As for Humphrey, he was sleeping the sound sleep of health, content, and an easy conscience. And Tom Prior was walking up and down before the door of his lodgings, puffing smoke into the early morning air, recklessly risking his character as an irreproachable young man, by staying abroad till his footsteps might be heard contemporaneously with the cock-crow, restless like Abigail Howe, only restless not with misery but bliss, such as had not yet exalted and humbled his fervid soul. CHAPTER II. THE VICTIM BROUGHT TO LIFE AGAIN. The rosy drawing-room was rosier than ever on a long day in June ; but the tables and chairs were literally loaded with drapers' parcels, milliners' band-boxes, ornamental bits of china, and small pieces of silver plate, with string entanghng the hands and feet everywhere. Abigail Howe stood in the centre in profound calcula tion, with long streamers of white ribbon on one arm, and her hands full' of little sprigs of artificial flowers \u2014 white flowers, jessamine. Her dress was in contrast to her occu pation. She wore a faded muslin gown, two summers old, ready to be laid aside, like the worn-out garment of her maiden Hfe. Her bronzed hair was tucked tightly out of the way, back from her little thin face, as if she had dressed it in the preoccupation of much to do, with no thought but to dispose of it so as to lighten the temples and give the least trouble to preserve the glory in order. But she did not fail to have the lace at her throat gathered together by a little cluster of leaves in dead and glittering gold, and to wear on one of her fingers a chang-ino- coloured opal ring, both trinkets indicating the taste of a man whose untutored artistic fancy went beyond his means, and his appreciation of the money value of ornaments."], [249, "237 THE VICTIM BROUGHT TO LIFE AGAIN. Mrs. Howe entered the room, her cabbage-rose face beaming with dehght. Though it was evening, she wore a white apron over her gown, white cuffs drawn up to her elbows, and the strings of her cap were pinned carefully over her shoulders, in order to hang behind her. She never trusted any one but herself with her jeUies, and this was an epoch for the most anxious experiments with her confectionery. \" My love, I have been making a trial of a few of these moulds, as there must be some additions to the dinner to morrow, on your aunts' and uncles' account at any rate. I think, let cook say what she will about pyramids being newer, I prefer my old turtle-dove. She has come out to the life, only with her beak broken, which wid never be observed, and I am just going to supply the cloves for eyes. I declare, when the jelly shakes, you would think she was shaking her wings to rise and fly off.\" \"I don't think that would be a desirable effect, mamma.\" \"No. But you will know better what the weight of jellies is on one's mind, when you come to give your first dinner. To be sure you will have me to apply to for many a long year, I hope ; and I dare say you wdl take in a jobbing cook, as so many of the young housekeepers do now-a-days. But I trust you will never put your dinners into the hands of the hotel-keepers, dr confectioners \u2014 such disgracefully extravagant, lazy, indifferent behaviour, I could never countenance it, Abigad.\" \" I wish you would wait till I give a dinner, mamma.\" \" Of course you will give dinners, chdd. Where would be the use of your best dinner china, if you did not give dinners ? I warrant he wiU care for such things, then ; all married men do.\" \" I must have faith in my good stars that he will not.\" \" And if he do not care for dinners, which is not to be thought of, you will put your pride in them.\" \"My pride in dinners!\" ejaculated the bride, still in half-amused incredulity. \" You might put your pride in worse. You wdl not go gadding about to dancing parties and picnics after you are a married woman. Not that you ever were a gadder,\" taking back her words penitently, \" but as good and quiet a girl as ever I saw. But where would your bit of pleasure be then, Abigad ? \""], [250, "238 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. \" I am sure I don't know,\" answered Abigail, in a staid, tired tone. \" Don't stay any longer poking about here, my pet,\" her mother enjoined her hastily. \" Brides should leave all trouble to ordinary mortals ; it is not lucky to do other wise. Go aud be happy and admired and adored while your day lasts. He will be here presently, I suppose, and yon will be too late to dress for him. We are going to have an early tea in the dining-room to-night, that Sarah may clear out this room, the last tea papa and you and I will take together, before your uncles and aunts arrive. There, I ought not to have said that, to tempt you to break down.\" However, Abigail did not break down. She merely said, with a wistfulness which took away the ungraciousness of the words, \" Then I wish he would keep away when it is to be our last tea. He would have done it, if I had only asked him.\" \" No, we could not expect that,\" Mrs. Howe warned her daughter. \" Were you looking out for him ? \" \" No. I never look out for him,\" confessed Abigail, candidly, \" because he comes at all times ; so that looking out for him would be no sinecure. And I am dressed already if you please, mamma. I am not going to do any more in the way of dressing to-night.\" \" It is not as I please,\" hesitated Mrs. Howe, a troubled expression stealing over the bright roundness of her face, \" but as he pleases.\" \" Oh, I need not dress for him,\" Abigail assured her mother, with a little nervous laugh, the first she had given. \" I am certain he never sees what I wear ; I might put a helmet on my head, Hke Minerva, or a coal-scuttle, it would be all the same to him if it were I who wore it. Queer, is it not, mamma ? \" An event was about to happen in the domestic economy of the Howes which was sufficient to overturn even the simpering, decorous, rosy affectation of the drawing-room. Abigail Howe was to be married in a few days to Tom Prior. Everything in the household was exceedingly un comfortable, and everybody much put about ; but from Mr. Howe to the under kitchen-maid, who was given to pounding sand to apply to her floors and tables at aU"], [251, "THE VICTIM BROUGHT TO LIFE AGAIN. 239 hours, as an apothecary's boy pounds his drugs, and was hurt in her feelings (as an apothecary's boy rarely is) when she was stopped and taken away to less serious and urgent occupations ; everybody was mild and complacent in the chaos, under the reflected honour of a marriage in the family. The gain to Mr. Howe was very small and entirely honorary, and was counterbalanced by the loss of his only child, by the paying down of half of her portion (with the precaution of settling it on herself), and the liberal furnish ing of his grateful son-in-law's house \u2014 the old house in Mill Street which the elder Binghams had occupied in the good old days of cotton-spinning before they grew grand and went out to the Hanger. The old house had always been thought a good family house, though it was venerable and shady, and stood alone in its grade in old-fashioned dignity and usefulness near its factory ; and it was as Mr. Howe was furnishing it, a handsome house for a young couple, the head of whom was only the junior partner in the factory. Mr. Howe gave his full consent to the marriage ; and Mrs. Howe, kind woman, was infinitely more elated than the bride herself at having her daughter married as she deserved to be before the Lewises, and not long after Mrs. Leech's sister \u2014 that lady had come to Ashley for a fort night's visit and had snapped up the scrupulous Vicar, who either laid aside his scruples under the pressure of circumstances, or found that he had so much to do in controlling the outer courts of men's consciences, that he was obliged to slur over the important step, to himself, of his own marriage. But Mrs. Howe did not blame Mr. Bellairs, it was Mrs. Leech's sister whom she, generally the most indulgent of women, could not forgive for being so grasping. As if marrying men were as abundant as acorns in an oak coppice at Ashley, and as if Mrs. Leech's sister had not come from a large town where she might have had a choice of men ten years younger and a great deal better off than the Vicar ; but she had a mind, like the old Romans, to abandon the palaces of Rome for the huts of Britain out of sheer fickleness and love of conquest. Mrs. Howe went so far as to liken the benighted Vicar \u2014 be nighted where the interests of the single ladies of his"], [252, "240 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. parish were concerned \u2014 to the ewe lamb, and Mrs. Leech's sister to the rich man of the same parable. But the aggressor would repent at leisure and be punished for her unprincipled poaching on her neighbour's preserves, Mrs. Howe reflected with acrimony, not that she had ever enter tained an idea of the Vicar for Abigail, only she was a true Ashley woman, and Mrs. Leech's sister, an interloper, had no business to marry Mrs. Howe's Vicar. Of course Abigail's marriage would have been a far more splendid affair had Humphrey Bingham been the bridegroom, and the Hanger the bride's destination, as Mrs. Howe had once had good reason to expect; but it was a wise fisher's adage, \" better small fish than none ; \" and a girl was liable to go off better in her looks and in the public estimation after she had been notoriously jilted as poor Abigad had been by that half-innocent, spoilt scamp, Humphrey Bingham \u2014 though Mrs. Howe dared not make the most distant allusion to the fact, not even to Mr. Howe. Therefore the other partner (Mrs. Howe always called Tom Prior \"the other partner\" now, as if there were equality between the two, though Tom Prior would have been the last man to acknowledge such a thing), having come on promptly was a stroke of com pensation and good fortune of which Abigail was worthy. And Mr. Prior was passionately in love with Abigail \u2014 there was no mistake there ; and Abigail had undormly expressed a great esteem for Mr. Prior, and insisted that he would get on in the world, sly puss ! Then there was the pleasure of having her daughter settled near her. Altogether Mrs. Howe was very happy herself, and con vinced that the young couple had a fair prospect of happiness. Abigail was very still about her marriage. She knew that she was not over wise, though she had been counted a clever girl, nor over strong, though she had a woman's power of endurance. She had longed for any change after the violence of the blow which she had received had sub sided into a dull ache, any interlude on the monotony of a life which was crushed and deprived of colour and fragrance ; something different from the small gaieties of Ashley, over which, whenever they were of a lively descrip tion, the Binghams of the Hanger presided. She had felt"], [253, "241 THE VICTIM BROUGHT TO LIFE AGAIN. her wounded pride soothed by Tom Prior's blind passion ; she thought that it was blind in Tom. She would rather that he had not been Humphrey's partner, but Humphrey was nothing to her except in the past, and he would be less than nothing when she was Tom Prior's wde ; neither need she see any more of him in Tom Prior's house than in her father's : the men met when Humphrey went to the factory, in their counting-house, their wives would be at the head of very different establishments. Humphrey had sent his partner's bride a goodly wedding gift (the sdver tea vase on which Mrs. Howe set such store), but he was not to be at the wedding- \u2014 he and his wde were up in London. It might be weak in Abigail, but marrying Tom Prior seemed less hard than being a lonely old woman like the Miss Mainwarings, or songht after for her poor little fortune like Mrs. Vallance. These terminations might be far in the distance ; but with the principal chapter of her life written, read, and closed, it seemed to Abigail as d the rest of the volume must be compressed into small bulk and speedy accomplishment. It was like a certain chapter in Genesis, in which the old man Jacob sums up his life to his favourite son in the two events \u2014 God met him at Bethel ; and he buried Rachel on the way to Bethlehem. Abigail had buried her Rachel ; and the rest, be it short or long, would be easily summed up and was near at hand. Her father and mother were pleased, and she thought she could make Tom Prior happy. To do Abigail justice, her greatest doubt had been for Tom's sake. But he was an unexacting, single-hearted, generous fellow, who regarded her with romantic devotion, and was enchanted at her accepting the offer of his lde. Poor Tom ! Yet she really liked him. She had always Hked his clever impulsive sayings and doings, though she had laughed at their drollness ; and since they were engaged she had been more interested and amused by him than ever \u2014 it was something now to be interested and amused. At the same time Abigail had a strong suspicion that she had always looked forward as to the goal of her Hfe to being married and having a home of her own, and to receiving her father and mother there as honoured guests, R"], [254, "242 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. without continuing in leading-strings to them to ripe middle age. And so far she had not been wrong to look forward to the white moire and floating lace of her marriage dress, and to the twenty or thirty-guinea shawl in her trousseau to be worn on occasions for the rest of her life \u2014 such a shawl as few girls in the middle class, however well off, wear. It was not the dress or the shawl, but what they represented, that Abigail cared for. She would have minded little though the moire had been muslin, and the shawl had dwindled to plaid ; but she wished to gather the blossoms and fruit of a complete Hfe, to claim the grace of her maiden innocence, and the dignity of a matron, with a man's honour and happiness, and a family's well-being in her trusted and safe keeping. Abigail did not question herself whether it were right or wrong to stretch out her hand to what was left her of these gifts, and whether she were not more grasping than Mrs. Leech's sister. The question was a hard one, but may resolve itself into the problem \u2014 Abigail had been badly hurt, and all who loved her suffered from her hurt. How many had a right to suffer, and was she at liberty to give the right to any one who begged and pleaded for it ? Abigail had tried to say to Tom Prior, \" Tom, do you know I once cared for Humphrey Bingham when I had reason to think Humphrey cared for me ? \" And Tom had stopped her with the eager assurance, \" Yes, dear, and it was natural \u2014 he is a fine fellow, Humphrey. It was very natural in Humphrey ; but then his mother and sisters came over him ; he was always a great family man, with all his spirit ; and their groundless opposition would have been disagreeable for you : besides, he was too generous to take everything. You care for and trust me a Httle \u2014 it is better as it is, Abigail, a world better for me.\" There was a confusion in Tom's mind whether or not he seriously believed that Humphrey had resigned Abigail with an ulterior view to his \u2014 Tom's \u2014 benefit, at least he managed to preserve his allegiance both to his mistress and his friend, because it would have been great pain, in some respects hardly possible, to him to give either up. He continued to combine the contradictory dogmas, that"], [255, "THE VICTIM BROUGHT TO LIFE AGAIN. 243 Abigail was perfect, and that Humphrey had not sinned beyond forgiveness. The man who paid his visits so pertinaciously, and would not have heeded though his mistress had hid her head in a coal-scuttle, came this evening, and laughed with almost childish glee at the disorder of the house. He laid himself out to bestow excellent advice in the arrangements for the collation and the packing, \u2014 to Mrs. Howe's mingled edification and scandal. He lifted some of the heavy articles of furniture with his own hands, and took down and re-hung the Howes' family pictures to make room for the large photograph of Abigail, which she was to leave a shadow on the wall, above her empty place, as the house's daughter \u2014 doing it with a hundred times the neatness of an upholsterer's man, Abigail smiling quietly at him the while. He was entitled to rest and be thankful and be waited on afterwards ; but he scarcely took time to drink tea, though he could have come triumphantly through that ordeal of sceptical matrons. He only failed on one point, he let his cups get cold. He would toss off as many as Mrs. Howe could conscientiously fill out ; more, indeed, for she had held back the last till she had made a Httle deprecating, defensive speech. \" I am afraid, Mr. Prior, it is a little pale in the colour, not quite so good as the first. The \u2014 ahem \u2014 third rarelv is.\" But Tom put aside the objection in the politest, best tempered manner. \" Don't speak of it, Mrs. Howe,\" and plunged afresh into the milk-and-water stream, and into the conversation, while Mrs. Howe folded her hands behind the teapot, and assured herself, \" What a treasure that man is ! what will he not be content with on a washing-day, \u2014 boiled rice and cold pie (now Humphrey Bingham was nice in his eating) ; but Tom Prior will spoil Abigad, that is certain.\" Tom was speaking of the Scotch Highlands, which Abigail and he were to see during their fortnight's holiday, dwelling with boyish spirit on the northern routes, the unpronounceable Gaelic names, the purple mountains to be climbed, the golden oat-fields to be strolled through, the blue lochs to be rowed upon \u2014 his keen face flushed, his"], [256, "244 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. very hands full of action, until the details were rich and luminous with a young fellow's genius, and his gladness. Mr. Howe, under his stoical bearing, was impressed and a little uneasy. \" He is wonderful, after all, that lad Prior \u2014 I hope he is not going to turn out anything miraculous \u2014 an inventor, an author in the bud, with an awful development before him. No, he is simply crazed, and happy as a king. I wish he would take his happiness quietly, though. Does the young fool think no one ever married his first desperate fancy before, and never repented it afterwards ? \" However, Mr. Howe did not glance at the sweet cabbage- rose, Mrs. Howe, as d she had been his first fancy, and at the same time he had never repented his choice. But the women were touched without reservation by Tom's happiness \u2014 all good women are touched by the sight of great happiness, and the happiness of a bridegroom is a special compliment to themselves. Mrs. Howe and Abigail could have petted Tom Prior with all the experi- mental dainties of the marriage coUation, if he had cared for them, or patted him on the back and stroked his messed mass of sombre hair \u2014 through which he thrust whole hands and did not draw single fingers, after the careful, elaborate fashion of the \"Roman generalissimo and im- perator C\u00e6sar\" \u2014 if it had been permissible to do so. As it was, they were flatteringly and sympathetically affected by his eloquence ; and laughed and prattled, even Abigail, however much of her heart was reduced to ashes. Tom's inspired speech kindled some sparks on the cold altar ; and the briefest sojourn in the Scotch Highlands had been a favourite vision with Abigail as a girl, when many a time she had exhausted all her girlish weapons on her father to procure its realization. Even Mrs. Howe wished that she could have laid aside thirty years of her life, with their corresponding weight and stiffness, and run away to scramble among scenes of which she had read in her youth, when Ashley had heard of the poems of Mr. Scott, and of the novels of the Great Unknown. If Tom were to write his business letters at all that night (Tom, like most fellows fertile in resource, was desultory in his habits) he must go. He lingered to the last, alone with Abigail, after the two had subsided into quietness in the"], [257, "THE VICTIM BROUGHT TO LIFE AGAIN. 245 twilight of the long June day, as if they also felt that \"rest is sweet \" at the very height of their jubdee. Abigad had been carried away in spirit by her willing bridegroom, but now she was relapsing into the dreaminess of the last week \u2014 not the sunny mist of the most ordinary young bride, loving and loved, who is standing with her foot on so radiant a threshold that she looks round amazed and uncertain, to ask can the old world of sin and sorrow go on creaking and groaning in its old irreparable ruts, when she is to be married to her lover in three days ? but the bewildered breaking up of apathy, the smarting of old wounds, the tardy gathering of clouds of doubt and dismay. Tom Prior spoke at that moment with a pathetic min gling of humility and vanity which is so intensely human. He had asked no profession of regard from her before, he had been satisfied with her bare \" yes \" to the generous ardour of his wooing, her simplest declaration of good-will. His eyes had sparkled and his heart had leapt on the faintest suspicion that she admired him, and was drawn to him. But now, on the spur of the moment, impelled by an irresistible longing, he put it to her, \" You like me better than you liked him \u2014 fine fedow as he is \u2014 now, to- Dight, Abigail ? \" Abigail shrank back, and her voice was low and trem bled when she answered him. \" I was never going to be married to him in three days, Tom. He never stood with his arm round me as you are standing. He once clasped me in his arms, when we neither of us thought what he was about, but it was only for a moment \u2014 never again. I am to be your wde in three days, by my own free will, with \u2014 yes \u2014 with ad my heart. But I warn you, Tom, I don't think I have so much heart as you have. The only thing that frightens me about you, sir, is your big, noble, warm heart, which I don't half deserve.\" She cried for a moment on his breast, where she had been laughing just before. \" Of course I could never feel in the same way to Humphrey Bingham that I feel to my dear, good, clever lover and bridegroom, Tom.\" Such was the gentle answer for which the manly, gentle fellow was grateful ; but was he satisfied ? He had the unerring intuition of love, could he be satisfied ?"], [258, "246 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. CHAPTER III. TEN TEARS AFTER. In Tom Prior's drawing-room, surrounded by the modern chaste elegance of white, watered walls, ebony-wood, and sea-green damask, more like a marine cave than a rose bower, Mrs. Prior, a ten years' old wife, sat in a low chair reading by the fire, which competed successfully with the April sunshine and spring wind without. Her hankering after matronly shawls had been rewarded, or punished, by having a shawl to wear in perpetuity \u2014 at her hearth as well as in the streets or on the roads round Ashley. Mrs. Prior was an invalid, and was enveloped in a soft, warm shawl, \u2014 white, from a lurking, lingering, womanly inclination to what was most becoming. Her face had stdl the nameless sweetness and charm which remains in some faces when the beauty of form and colour is gone or going ; but it was a worn, slightly pinched face for a woman of thirty, and the effect of time or sickness was increased by the old bright adornment of her hair being put quite away under a half handkerchief of lace, as if the hands were too weary to dress it and had done with the vanities of life. Something curious and subtle might be written on the connection between the health and sickness of a woman's mind and her treatment of what St. Paul calls her glory. It was not as a mere phrase that the maidens of the old tragic baHads so often sang \u2014 Nae mair I'll kaim my yellow hair. About Mrs. Prior's invalidism her native town of Ashley was comfortably agreed. Mrs. Prior had sunk into a poor, selfish, sickly creature. Tom Prior was a lost man. He was a poor, young-looking \u2014 in spite of his grey hairs \u2014 slim fellow, who slaved for his family. He put a good face on his fate before the world, and was always assuring his acquaint ances that Mrs. Prior was getting stronger. He walked to and from the factory with his great boys hanging upon him as if he were the mother, while the mother dawdled and nursed herself at home with her two idle and spoiled servants, when everybody knew that Tom Prior could not"], [259, "TEN TEARS AFTER. 247 afford to keep even those two. And it might be aU very well for Humphrey Bingham to speak of the factory as a bagatelle, and to propose throwing it up ; but badly paying as it was it must be a matter of life and death to Tom Prior, who was too manly to live dependent on his wde's smdl fortune, and who had nothing else between him and a manager's situation, or a situation of any kind, which he might have to go abroad to seek. At the same time the Ashley public were in a great hurry to kill off Mrs. Prior, and had even appointed her successor. This was not a second wife with a great deal more money or a great deal more energy, \u2014 but Mrs. Prior's nother, Mrs. Howe, whose husband was dead, and who bad already removed with all the rosiness which she could carry with her from Church Street, to a small snug house nearer her daughter. She was much attached, not only to her two grandchildren, but to Tom Prior \u2014 more like his own mother than his mother-in-law \u2014 a cheerful, hale old lady who would count it no sacrifice to keep her son-in law's house, while her independent income would be a windfall to poor Tom Prior. Tom Prior had never contemplated the advantages of his wife's death, neither was there any reason why Mrs. Tom should die just yet, except her general air of fading and wearing away. Nevertheless, the Ashley public showed sound judgment, as it generally did when it was not dealing with the numerous cases of exceptions, in drawing the conclusion that though there was no violent disorder there must be great poverty of system in the young woman who caught every influenza which passed over the place, and had soon to shut herself up for the depth of winter and for the sharpness of spring, and who adopted shawls and caps like a grandmother (grandmothers had a vast deal more spirit). The little world was correct in the conclusion that the poverty tended surely, though it might be graduaUy, to decay. Without being troubled either by Ashley's verdict on her character or by its future arrangements for her family, Abigail stayed by the fire and read, worked, and thought. She was reading one of those excellent brooding, classifying works, slightly unwholesome, on silver hairs and evening clouds \u2014 more acceptable than invigorating to their sub-"], [260, "248 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. jects, with their estimation of middle Hfe in women singu larly opposed to the rich fruitfulness and mellow brillianse of autumn in the natural world. These books are ad dress, d for the most part to single women, but some married women appropriate them. She was working at the embroidery of a jacket :or herself, now that Jack and Joe were too big for tunics, and she was feeling an old woman, \u2014 twice as old as Mrs. Hove, and that might be the reason why age, which sat so Hghily on grandmamma, depressed her daughter. She was thinking of the journey into Lancashire whith Tom had left her that morning to take. He had parted from her in the most off-hand manner ; he was engrossed with the new machinery which he desired to introduce into the factory ; he was more and more wedded to his trade : worldliness must be inseparable from elderly married Englishmen, when it had so crept and encroached on Tom that he was the most zealous business man in Ashley. She was thinking of the boys ; and glancing round her, she saw for the first time that they had left a litter of chips of wood and bits of string (what did boys always find to do with string ?), on the carpet since the morning, and she rang for Dorothy \u2014 Dorothy taking her own time to answer the bell, to remove it. Since Jack and Joe had gone to the grammar-school they had grown rough and rude ; and though they came to her yet with all their grievances, they seemed to consider, justly, their enjoy ments out of her way. They carried the eager chronicles of their games and exploits to their harrassed, busy father ; and she knew that this would increase year by year till she should sit apart from her sons, unless God sent them suffering and weakness, which, might He in His mercy forbid ! It was altogether natural, innocent, inevitable that they should go amongst boys and grow Hke boys, but she could have wished that they had continued longer babies. They were so much her own then, and had been such pretty, attractive little darlings. Their walks, their frocks, their diet, their play, had been such thorough occu pations. \u25a0 She had been happier and busier then, and not so often ailing. But, of course, their babyhood could not last for ever \u2014 their progress could not be delayed ; she was not so miserable a mother as to have sought it really, though"], [261, "249 TEN TEARS AFTER. the lads now belonged so much more to their papa and the rector of the grammar-school, and to cook and Dorothy for the nursery dinners and the todet. But if the boys had been girls their influence and com panionship would have endured a lifetime. Mrs. Hum phrey Bingham had girls as well as boys \u2014 one wise, arch little woman, who already sat with precocious demureness and restrained vivacity by her mother in the carriage, tripped out with messages to shops, delivering them far more intelligently than the footmen, and would soon save her mother a wonderful proportion of the burden of a great house and the entertainment of guests \u2014 though a great house and guests were no burden to Mrs. Humphrey. And there was another little girl at the Hanger, one of those gentle, guileless, fair little children, the likeliest angels, who would long follow her mother's footsteps, look up to her, and lean upon her, with a faith and devotion which create what they believe in. Abigail read, worked, and thought, and occasionally coughed, so that had Tom Prior been as sensitive as Humphrey Bingham to a cough, or had he not been accustomed to the sound, that cough unformed as it was yet, would have spodt the comfort of his Hfe. Abigail was surprised to hear Mr. Prior's knock at the door, followed by his voice in the hall, when he had left her in the morning with the intention of taking the down train to Lancashire. There was no need for her rising and going to the- door to investigate the reason of his return, when she had an incipient cold on her, by a succession of premonitory shivers \u2014 one of her very bad colds, pro bably, bronchitis or pleurisy. Some trifle might have made him change his mind and come back ; he was always forgetful and slightly Bohemian in his ways, though a steady, hard-working fellow after his kind. Presently, he turned the door-handle and looked in without entering immediately. \" Please, Tom, come in at once, and don't keep me in the draught,\" said Abigail plaintively. \"I have been sneezing all the morning.\" Tom came in directly, and shut the door. \" I did not feel very well myself, Abigail. As you are sneezing, perhaps the weather has something to do with"], [262, "250 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. it,\" he added with an involuntary shiver; \"but I thought I had better put off the journey for a day. You see there is very Httle the matter with me, for I have walked back and carried my bag from the station.\" Abigail got up instantly, it was strange news to hear Tom Prior say that he did not feel very well, and there he was white and weary, through his screen of hair, leaning against the door. She had no reason to suppose that there was anything far wrong with him, though he tacitly admitted that he was not fit for business, and allowed her to send for Dr. Winkworth to put him to rights, while he was explaining away his illness, as if he were apologizing for disturbing her with it. But it struck her curiously that she would repent all her life that small matter of how she had received him. Before night Tom Prior lay flushed, panting, and ram bling in his talk in a high fever. Abigail, in her thirty years of Hfe, had never nursed a patient in serious illness ; it happens so with some women. Her boys had been healthy, her father had died just after the younger child was born, and his case had been such as to preclude the alternations of hope and fear. Mr. Howe had been struck down speechless, and after a few hours' struggle against the deadly torpor, he had been mercifully spared farther suffering. Abigail might be thankful that her husband's illness was of a different character ; but as she sat and gazed in blank consternation at the active, independent figure suddenly stopped in its activity, and laid down in the humiliation of helplessness, and heard first with the pang, which the pang of no other calamity save that of death itself can surpass, the reason able voice unreasonably disclosing to the idlest ears its jealously guarded secrets, she did not know how to be thankful for anything. Mrs. Howe arrived, hurrying to be of use, and to ascer tain the extent of the evil. She was taken aback by the spectacle which she met, and as Tom was dozing and did not see her, the tears poured down her cheeks. \" Poor fellow, he has worked so hard and been so worried. I would give every shilling I have in the world to relieve him and see him well again. Yes, Abigail, your Tom has been a good husband, and a good son to me.\""], [263, "251 TEN TEARS AFTER. \" What did you mean, mamma, about Tom's having been worried, and about giving every shilling you had in the world to relieve him ? \" Abigail roused herself and questioned her mother in the course of the long night. \" I had my own pocket-money, and the supplies for the house never failed ; he was always ready with them. What did you mean ? \" Mrs. Howe only comprehended in part, and desired to repair what she considered her mistake. When Abigail was likely to have an anxious time with her husband's illness, it was not the season to fret her with worldly cares. \" Oh, my dear, I meant nothing particular, except that no doubt poor Tom has business trials like other men, which men like our Tom bear on their own broad backs \u2014 not that his back was ever very broad, poor fellow \u2014 and don't shift on their wives' weak shoulders, especially if they are ailing shoulders.\" \" Do they not ? Is that right ? \" inqud-ed Abigail, with sharp pain, awakening out of a dream. \" Oh, my dear, don't distress yourself. I did not mean that he had run into debt, nothing of the kind. I never heard of such a thing.\" \" Never mind, mamma ; I have more to distress myself about.\" Abigail had got the sum of the information which she had expected, and it served to make her husband's uncon scious speech plain to her. He spoke incessantly of his business, working away at his accounts, going over and over again the accustomed ground in the factory with an earnestness and eagerness which contrasted broadly with his incapacity and inertness. His raving was as pure as the prattle of a child, he never said a word which could hurt a human being except that he broke her heart by running up accounts, comparing invoices, weighing bales, examining frames, arranging that a place should be kept for an old woman who had been a worker in her young days ; and that Bill Cobb should have his full wages, for a man's child must be buried, and the scapegrace was in real trouble this time, well, it might sober him. Sometimes he referred to his father's expe rience in the office, which had established a hereditary connection with the factory."], [264, "252 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. He said it all in a matter-of-fact, cheerful voice, only waxing hoarse and husky with much speaking and with failing strength. He never alluded to disappointment or anxiety, smothering and stranghng them to the last. He had his work to do, and he did it, lying there, as busily as ever he had done it in the counting-house or the factory. If he were to die, Abigail could say of him, that he had died as truly at his post as a sador at the helm, or a soldier on the breach. For sitting there, watching Tom Prior's looks and words, the knowledge came irresistibly to Abigail, that they contained the reflection of a devoted career, the essence of manliness. He did not say one directly religious word, though Abigail knew him to be a reverent, believing man ; but the whole tenour of his business talk was religious, the evidence of a life spent in aiming at duty, a com mentary on the text, \"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with all thy might.\" Tom Prior was not always unconscious, he would recog nise Abigail, Mrs. Howe, and the nurse provided for him. On these occasions he announced that he was better, they were only making a fuss about him ; were they looking after the children ? bid Abigail lie down ! Bad as it was to hear this when he was no better, and when Abigail could no more have rested than she could have danced, it was not so bad as to have him toiling man fully and self -forgetfully on his sick-bed, perhaps his death bed. The very little boys felt this ; and Joe confided to his mother, with a girlish burst of tears which smeared his bold, chubby face almost as black as his hands, that he wished papa would only cry oh dear ! and say that he could not bear it, and roar as he and Jack did when they had chilblains, and nurse put the stuff in the bottle on them, or when they had gum-boil, and not go on working for them and the factory people and he lying so sick in bed. Could not mamma stop him, and tell him that Jack and Joe had .made up their minds to spend all the Saturday afternoon in the factory, and were prepared to help the manager to pay the hands if he would allow them ? \" We must let papa alone just now, my dears ; he cannot bear to be meddled with.\" Abigad tried to comfort the children and herself. \"When he is well again, as Jack and Joe will pray to God to make him, we will do all we can to get papa to let us share in his work.\""], [265, "253 TEN TEARS AFTER. Dr. Winkworth, and the other doctors who saw Tom at the worst \u2014 and were the signal to Ashley that poor Tom Prior, with a wife and a young family, was dangerously ill, so that the Miss Mainwarings could send their Httle maid to the back area gate, with their comphments, and please how was Mr. Prior ? twice a day \u2014 were hopeful of his recovery, though the symptoms were formidable. But Dr. Winkworth was not Hke cautious old Dr. Lewis, he was an uncompromising man, and told all whom it might, concern, flatly, \" Mr. Prior has not been using himself well ; he has been overdoing himself, and he has not been taking sufficient rest and refreshment ; the consequence is, that he has made our office ten times more difficult and doubtful.\" Abigail looked back \u2014 that aching looking back, to ascertain all the recklessness of which he and she had been guilty. Tom had been absorbed in business, she had known that, but she had always thought that it was the love of business which comes to a man with years, when he has done with the fancies and follies of youth ; and some envy of Humphrey Bingham's prosperity had mingled with the fact that it rendered Humphrey more of a sleeping partner. Lately Tom had gone to the office after dinner, thus certainly curtailing his rest and refreshment, and he had sometimes worked by himself far on into the night. When he was very busy he had not come home to dinner, near as his house was, but had ordered a sandwich to be sent to the office. Abigail had never prevented it. If Tom chose to give himself up to business it was his own affair. She had never dreamt of injury to his health (as if she had held a monopoly of illness). Mrs. Howe had occasionally remonstrated, but Abigail had joined Tom in saying that the remonstrance was stuff, and in laughing at it. Very likely, though Abigail had resisted Tom's mal- practices, Tom, with his horror of milksops, and his doggedness where his own ease and comfort were con- cerned, would have resisted and overcome her; but Abigad had not resisted him, she had aided and abetted him in his carelessness. Abigail had not had any con- ception of such sudden and terrible disorder of func tions and faculties as had punished Tom for his ignorance and imprudence, well-informed, sensible fellow as he was."], [266, "254 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. Her own illnesses had all consisted of weakness and irri tation of the chest, prostrating aud ominous in their way, but so bearable, above all to a retiring, languid woman, that now and then, when she was taking herself to task, she had accused herself of making pets of her illnesses. Now she witnessed in grief and terror an dlness which struck root and branch, and clutched its victim \u2014 the head of the family, its natural stay and crown \u2014 of whom no prophet had forboded the remote decay, far less of the crashing fall. \" If Tom die, I have helped to dig the grave of the only man who would have killed himself, and who has killed himself for me,\" Abigail told herself in her despair, deal ing to herself the hard lines which noble natures take as their portion, when their eyes are opened and when they have come to their right minds. At last the fever slackened and the disorder yielded. Dr. Winkworth pronounced that Mr. Prior had turned over a new leaf, and that he expected his patient would be sensible when he awoke next morning. \" But you must be very careful, Mrs. Prior; you are not to expect that he is to come out of this attack a stronc man, and you are not to encourage him to make exertions. He will begin to worry about his business presently \u2014 men are bad patients in that respect. If you can tell him any thing that will set his mind at ease, do so ; but tell him nothing that can vex him. Say that I distinctly forbid it.\" And the Doctor, exceedingly shrewd in his physical line, walked off with as silly a speech, morally, as if he had for bidden the tides to obey the moon ; but as he observed to himself shortly, \" It is not my business but hers to find a way to keep her husband quiet.\" Abigail stood and looked at her husband before he awoke next morning. The little solid flesh that he had ever possessed had melted away like the wax of the figures which witches placed before slow fires. All his tangled hair and growth of beard, fast growing grey, could not conceal the hollows in his face. But Abigail, for the first time in her life, thought Tom Prior handsome \u2014 all coarse ness refined away from the haggard face, a certain stern ness lent by its spareness to its pleasantness, but the most manly, the truest of faces."], [267, "255 TEN TEARS AFTER. \"What holes papa has got in his cheeks,\" remarked one of the boys with something like awe, stealing on tiptoe into the room after his mother. \" Papa had always holes in his cheeks, boy, only they used to look more like dimples,\" his mamma explained softly. \" We must make them look like dimples again.\" She went and chatted cheerfully with the boys when Mrs. Howe had gone to sit with Mr. Prior. The boys had taken to their mother since they were scared by the atmo sphere of pain and fear in the house ; and now that she made them parties to her reviving hopes, and was merry with them, they were enchanted with her as with a new acquisition, and were loth to part from her. \" Don't go, mamma ; it is so nice to hear you laugh \u2014 almost as jolly as having papa downstairs again. Why do you laugh so seldom ? \" \" You don't know what you are saying, child. I laugh as often as my neighbours \u2014 my grown-up neighbours, I mean. I must go now; don't detain me, you two rogues, for I am going out. I have not been out since poor papa was ill.\" They were so perverse, that they wished to walk with her, though a fortnight ago they would have resented it as an approach to the insult of walking with their nurse. \" This is a wonderful accession of gallantry. I see that if I am not to be pestered by the attentions of two young men, I must exert a little lawful authority. So off with you to school, Jack and Joe, and be sure that you take a message from me to the Rector, that I hope the usher canes you when you are late.\" Mrs. Howe was delighted that Abigail should think of breathing the fresh air, and was quite certain that she could keep Mr. Prior from fretting while his wife was out. \" But though Tom is amazingly better, don't stay away long, dear, on your own account, for this is a most deceitful day ; there is a great deal of May sun, but the wind is in the east, and you know this is the time of the year when you are particularly liable to your influenzas.\" Abigail smiled and sighed, and begged her mother not to weary for her. But she did not say that she was going to stay away two or three hours at the shortest computa tion. She was going to take a drive of six miles and back."], [268, "256 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. She was going to hire a cab from the Royal Hotel, and drive to the Hanger to see Humphrey Bingham. He had sent regularly, and had even come personally to the house more than once to inquire for his partner, but he had never asked to go up to Tom ; kind-hearted as Humphrey was, he was not fond of witnessing scenes of distress, and the feeling was growing upon him ; but his old mistress was going out to the Hanger to see him. Abigail had been very seldom, and for mere short ceremonious visits, at the Hanger since Humphrey's marriage and her own ; so that in thinking of it at any time, and in seeing it again now, her mind recurred to the time when she had known it best \u2014 the days which she had spent there with Fanny Bingham, in the year when she had regarded it as her future home. It was what its name implied, a prettily-situated country- house, on the slope of a wooded hill now green and fragrant in early summer. Humphrey had added to the building ; until wbat with its colonnade, which carried off the mono- tony of the long line of the billiard-room ; what with its clock-tower, which contained only a smoking-room, it had become quite a mansion : it was in keeping with Hum- phrey's fortune, which had increased, as wealth begets wealth, by the death of Mrs. Humphrey's sister and co- heiress, and by a rich old uncle of Humphrey's having appointed him his chief heir and residuary legatee. Abigail thought less of the extensive building than of the hyacinths which made the sides of the avenue blue, the crimson tassels which tipped the feathery foliage of the larch, the chorus of birds' songs almost overpower- ing her with their gaiety and sweetness \u2014 after the old shady house in Mill Street, to which children would only return for meals and bed if they had their wiU ; and after Tom's dark sick-room, with its smell of vinegar and its muffled footfalls. The servant who opened the door was not an Ashley man, and did not know Mrs. Prior, so that when she asked to speak with Mr. Bingham he showed her into the library, which his master used as a business room, and told her that the family were at luncheon in the dining-room but as soon as they had finished he would tell the Squire. The library was the room in which Humphrey, his sister, and"], [269, "257 TEN TEARS AFTER. the young lady staying in the house had taken the gipsy tea on the night of the ball. But what was of more con sequence now, it formed one in a suite with the dining room, and there was a door between them standing a little ajar, so that Abigail sitting down in the first study chair, had but to turn her head to catch a gHmpse of the party at luncheon, and to hear as much of their conversation as she cared to listen to, while they were too well employed, and were making too much noise with plates, glasses, and conversation to notice her entrance. They were a large party, including not only Humphrey, his wde, and their elder children, with their governess, but a specimen of the constant succession of visitors who stayed with the Binghams when they were at the Hanger. The Binghams had been absorbed into the county set, for which their means and manners qualified them. But Ashley people blamed Mrs. Humphrey for Humphrey's desertion of the town. Affable as she had shown herself on her introduction to it, she had found no difficulty in giving up her Ashley acquaintances when it suited her, not with offensive slights and cuts, but with sufficient decision. Mrs. Humphrey was so led by the gentry that she assumed their very failings. She had an eye-glass fixed to the end of her driving- whip, like Lady Metcalfe, though Mrs. Humphrey's short-sightedness had not been heard of at an earlier date. And, as the Miss Mainwarings observed, while old age did not come alone, nobody sported it at the end of a driving-whip, and it was absurd to mention old age in the same breath with a young creature like Mrs. Humphrey \u2014 notwithstanding Mrs. Humphrey's memory had failed her where the Miss Mainwarings were con cerned. Mrs. Humphrey made greater concessions to rank than that of losing her full power of vision, \u2014 she dropped her girlish, well-bred periods of speech, and adopted whatever expressions were slangy and horsey, though her ears had not been early trained to the language of blacklegs and grooms, like those of poor Lady Antonia Vesey. The Vicar had spoken to Mr. Bingham on the racket which was suffered to go on at the Hanger on Sundays, yet Mrs. Bingham, in place of having been educated in a foreign convent Hke the young countess at s"], [270, "258 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. Oakdale, had been brought up by an aunt who was Low Church and Evangelical. There was a report that Humphrey would stand for the county at the end of the present session, when it was expected that the old member would retire ; and it was understood that Mrs. Humphrey was so zealous for her husband's election that that motive would induce her, if anything could, to renew her connection with Ashley, though no doubt on a different footing. But Mrs. Hum phrey was a good wife to Humphrey Bingham in her own way, and though she did not remain at home from the county races to nurse her children through the measles, saying audaciously that she had no fear for them \u2014 she was sure that they had inherited good constitutions and would recover splendidly \u2014 she did remain at home and nurse Humphrey affectionately when he stood hours in the wet, duck shooting, and had an aggravated quinsy afterwards. Some excursion for which there was little time, was in prospect for the family and the visitors at the Hanger, and the ladies were lunching without ceremony in their bonnets and hats, while the gentlemen attended to them with the little stir and glee of a cause for despatch, and a whet for wit as well as for appetite. Mrs. Humphrey was conspicuous among her chddren and her guests. She was a beautiful woman still, with her tall, slender figure grown a little too large, and her delicate complexion lost \u2014 perhaps her deep voice not sounding softer and lower \u2014 and with not more repose though with more style in her gestures. But she was a handsome, brilliant matron, on whom Humphrey had never ceased to cast his eyes in admiration and fondness as she sat opposite him, with the ample folds of her cashmere falling about her fine shoulders and bust, and a youthful \u2014 not too youthful-looking \u2014 velvet hat, with its curling white feather turned up above her plump, bonnie, blithe face. Humphrey's back \u2014 and it had grown a very broad back \u2014 was towards Abigail, but she could hear the old ringing, familiar tones of his voice rising above, and giving cheer to every other. \" No, no, Eddy, lobster salad is not for a puss Hke you.\" \" Just one bit, papa.\" \" Let it be but one then, you little gourmand.\""], [271, "259 TEN TEARS AFTER. Abigail could fancy the group : Humphrey's far-forward, arch, demure little daughter \u2014 dark-haired Hke her mother \u2014 perched on one side of him, and on the other his fair daughter, with a dash of her father's tawniness, which insured a balsam complexion and sapphire eyes. Hum phrey named the little girls Rouge et Noir teasingly, and then consoled them by bidding them fly and find their hats, and he would beg Miss Bertram to grant them a half holiday, and ask mamma to stuff them under the seats of the waggonette. But what would become of Humpty Dumpty, the last baby brother, in their absence ? Was he to sit on a wall till they all returned, and if he got a great fall should they bargain that he was to break no bones ? \" Now get along, Humphrey, and don't chaff the chil dren when you know that they don't understand it. You'll have Minnie crying and not able to say whether she will go or stay, if she thinks that baby is to come to grief in her absence \u2014 though, indeed, there is no occasion for the little girls going with us. They wdl be too late for the school room tea, and Miss Bertram \u2014 now that she is out of the room \u2014 don't like kicking her heels, though I never mind it. It is high time that you were up in town sitting in Parlia ment, or anywhere else, and not spoiling your family down here.\" \"Are you to keep up two establishments, Bingham ? \" asked one of the men \u2014 the poor representative of one of King Charles's baronets. \"Two or three or half-a-dozen, Sir Charles, if Mrs. Bingham is to go to Brighton in autumn, Rome in winter, and Paris or Vienna in spring, as she obligingly suggests.\" \" Of course I shall,\" Mrs. Humphrey affirmed lightly and coolly. \"All the world goes to grass some time or other.\" \" I think I had better try coining the blessed coin of the realm here at the Hanger, rather than the used-up device of spinning cotton over at Ashley.\" \" I think that big boy of mine had better look after the traps,\" Mrs. Humphrey appealed to the company generally : she did not encourage allusions to the factory, though she had the nouse to see that Humphrey's nonchalance on his origin spared him a few aristocratic sneers. Abigad had been obliged to overhear these scraps of the"], [272, "260 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. conversation, and to wait in patience till the party rose from table, and then she could distinguish the sound of the carriages coming round to the door and taking the place of her cab. The very horses were throwing up their heads at their hack brother and his hired vehicle. At last Humphrey was told that some person wanted him in the Hbrary, and he remained behind, after the rest of the company had trooped to the front door ; even then, when he had taken some steps towards the Hbrary, he stopped and turned back to speak to the servant who was preparing to clear the table. \" Tell cook her hunter's stew to-day was a masterpiece. It is one of her best dishes. She may send it up for breakfast to-morrow.\" No need to tell whence Miss Edith got her gourmand propensities. At last Humphrey came into the library, filling up the doorway, for his stately figure was becoming portly. He was still what in the west of Scotland is emphatically termed \" a braw man.\" But a certain unwieldiness was creeping over him, and his face was considerably fuller and redder than when it smiled brightly on Abigail on that far-away night of the ball. These were the effects which even gentlemenlike and respectable self-indulgence \u2014 in cluding the pursuit of field-sports \u2014 will produce on a man; and the portliness and floridness were not unbecoming in their present stage, though they foreshadowed heavier and coarser traits. The contrast between Humphrey Bingham and his partner's wife, the delicate pinched woman, in the winter gown and jacket of grey woollen stuff and the Ashley everyday bonnet of black chip, was striking \u2014 but not so extreme as the difference between Humphrey and the wan, hollow-cheeked, silver-headed man at home, working, in dreams, of whom Abigail thought intently, as she looked in Humphrey Bingham's face. He was so much surprised that he said her maiden name out loud, \" Abigail Howe ! \" but he recovered him self immediately, and shook hands with a cordial running fire. \" How do you do, Mrs. Prior ? Glad to see you, trust Prior is no worse ; shall fetch back Alice \u2014 come into the dining-room. Have some luncheon, a glass of wine at"], [273, "TEN TEARS AFTER. 261 least. Why did they show you in here ? \" When he found that Abigail would not have Mrs. Bingham recalled, or consent to eat and drink, his good nature helped her instantly. He assured her that his going with the others was of no consequence. He was to ride, and he could easily make up to them ; if she would permit him to send to the party to set out without him, he should be at her service, fie despatched his message, made Abigad sit down again, and took a seat opposite her. \"You are sure Prior is no worse ? \" \" Oh no, he is a great deal better ; the Doctor is very well pleased with him this morning, if we can keep him from meddling with business. That is what I came here to speak to you about.\" \" Does Prior know that you are here ? \" asked Hum phrey, with an inadvertent dryness stealing into his voice. \" Odd enough,\" he thought, clasping his knee, \" if Prior try to come over me with his wife. By-the-by, how faded the poor little woman is : I am shocked to see her.\" \"No, he was asleep when I left. It is entirely my own idea.\" \"You do me honour, Mrs. Prior,\" declared Humphrey with his old gallantry. \" May I ask, have you heard that I propose \u2014 I think,\" \u2014 he hesitated slightly, and played with the tassel of the bell-rope, though he felt that he must plunge into his communication, \" of giving up the factory, as I have not time to look near it, and it is too much for Mr. Prior.\" \" I do not think so,\" interposed Abigail eagerly. \"I am sure that his heart is in it ; if you had only listened to him for the last fortnight, you would think so too.\" \" It is not worth his pains,\" protested Humphrey, abruptly dropping the tassel ; \"he is wasting his time and my means \u2014 along with his own, of course.\" \"lam aware that he has very little of his own,\" said Abigad, in her quiet ingenuous voice. \"But as far as I could follow him, he wishes to try an improvement on the machinery, which would insure the work's being more quickly and cheaply done.\" \"Not to any extent,\" exclaimed Humphrey, impatiently. Then he checked himself, and took the trouble to explain"], [274, "262 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. to her gravely, \" I repeat that I believe it would only be the waste of more time and means ; Lbut of course you ought not to speak of it to him at present. I thought it right to anticipate any proposal which you might make, and it can be broken to him by degrees when he is stronger.\" Abigail's heart sank. The factory had waned into an irksome trifle to Humphrey Bingham, while it [had waxed into a matter of life and death to Tom Prior. But she would not be baulked of her proposal, the drift of which was beyond Humphrey Bingham's liveliest imagination, though he had a guess that women were, at once, the meanest and the most generous of created beings. \" Mr. Bingham, when you say that the improvement expected from the new machinery would not be to any extent, you mean relatively in connection with the cost and your income, don't you ? \" \" I admit that I do, Mrs. Prior. It might pay Prior, but only in a small way, and I really consider he might do better. Pray remember that I do not reflect on him in the least,\" he added, kindly. \" I should know Tom Prior \u2014 old Tom \u2014 and I say a more honourable, devoted mechanical genius, if he had the tools to work with, does not exist.\" \"I am sure you are right.\" Abigail set her seal to the statement earnestly, never thinking of deprecating a com pliment. \"And he has been brought up a manufacturer, as the Ashley people have been brought up to the factory. No doubt they could get other work, or go elsewhere for work, and it would be kinder to let them do so, hard as it would be for them at first, than to keep on the factory if it could not be made to pay. I understand all that, but Tom does not think it cannot pay. Will you tell me, Mr. Bingham, what the improvement would cost ? \" Certainly. To introduce the change properly, which would be the only chance, might cost five or six thousand pounds. But you do not think that I should grudge the sum i\u00a3 I saw my way clearly ? \" he asked, putting his hands into his pockets unable to help appearing nettled. \" No,\" answered Abigail slowly, as if she were reflecting. \"Papa left me five thousand pounds ; will you take that as Tom's share ? You know business so much better than I,"], [275, "TEN TEARS AFTER. 263 you wid be able to tell exactly what I have only a vague notion of \u2014 I mean that though I have not the money entirely at my own disposal, I can borrow upon it or sell my life rent in it, you know.\" He was leaning back in his chair more astonished than when he had seen her there first. \" Borrow upon your fortune ! sell your Hfe rent in it ! What are you thinking of, Abigail ? Excuse me, but you are speaking arrant treason \u2014 shocking nonsense,\" he re peated, with his eyes stid opened wide but with a smile playing about his mouth. \" Your fortune is the only thing that you have to depend upon should the firm be dissolved to-morrow, and should Prior not get into another, or only be able to procure a subordinate situation. If he were so left to himself as to consent to so rash and reckless a venture, it could not be allowed for a moment in your interest and in that of your children.\" \" If Tom had the money of his own, do you think he would not risk it ? \" \" I cannot say that he would not, because the man is possessed by the spirit of improvement ; but that would alter the case entirely.\" \" I do not think so. Supposing I had happened to have no money, and he were spending all our worldly goods, would it not come to much the same thing ? for what is mine is Tom's, to use according to his judgment, whether you and he think so or no. I desire you to take the money, Mr. Bingham,\" she urged, with a dawning of indignation. \"I will not, Mrs. Prior. I beg your pardon, I could not without his knowledge and consent : there would be neither law nor honesty in the proceeding.\" He had risen and was walking up and down the room. He stopped and looked at the thin, pleading, passionate face. \" But at least you are a good wife to him.\" \"No,\" denied Abigail, with the tears for the first time starting to her eyes. \" That is not it, but he is my dear husband.\" Humphrey stood gazing upon her, and twirling his watch-guard. She had a very sweet face, though she was not by a long chalk so handsome a woman as Alice ; but he did not wonder now at her old attraction for him. Would Alice have done as much for him \u2014 AHce, who set"], [276, "264 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. so much store on her dignities, and required so many indulgences as her right ? Stuff ! was he, so weU off, jealous lest poor Tom Prior could command more loyal duty, purer affection ? Alice had suited him perfectly, made him an excellent wife, and she had never been tried, as he should be thankful. But he would try Tom Prior's wde, Abigail Howe, a grain more, and see if the additional straw could break the camel's back, though he had always known her as an unworldly, enthusiastic woman. \" But, Mrs. Prior, supposing that the improvement on the looms should fail, and you have no warrant against it, what would you do then ? \" And he glanced his eyes involuntarily round the library, with its marble busts, carved oak, and calf-skin, which he was sensible were more in Tom Prior's and Abigad's way than in his and Alice's, but which more than any room in the house indicated the power and the refinement which belonged to the affluence of the owners. \" I cannot tell ; but we should still have Tom to work for us, as I dared not think we should a week ago,\" Abigail said, with undaunted courage. \" Mamma would do what she could for us, and take us in, till we were established elsewhere.\" \" Mrs. Prior, I see that you have made up your mind,\" broke in Humphrey, afraid to trust himself to hear any thing further; \" you are a dear, good little soul \u2014 -the most regular brick. You have fairly conquered me. We will say no more about business just now, if you please. Only mind, that I authorize the new machinery ; you may tell Prior so whenever you like ; and who knows, but it may be a spoke in my wheel if I try for the county ? At least many a smaller cotton spinner and calico printer than Cobden and Bright has sat under the roof of St. Stephen's.\" Tom was well enough to begin and groan over his business. \" If Bingham would look in and let me say a word to him on a change in the looms.\" \"Humphrey Bingham has been here often,\" said Abi gail, in an undertone. \" I saw him yesterday ; and by the bye, Tom, he desded me to ted you that he agrees to the improvements you wish.\" Tom drew a long sigh of relief, turned to the wall, and"], [277, "TEN TEARS AFTER. 265 puUed up the bed-clothes to shade his face ; perhaps he was overcome at the gaining of his heart's desire, and of another chance in the world, for he was weak, poor fellow ; perhaps he wanted to thank his Maker for His boundless goodness. When he spoke again, it was to say gently \u2014 \" My dear, if you had known what it was to me to hear that word, you would have spoken it at once. Humphrey was always a noble fellow, and see how he has got on. He has prospered as he deserved. I hope that I shall be per- mitted to make this up to him.\" Abigail pondered if Tom lying there wasted and low, with much upon his mind, much drudgery and anxiety before him yet, and with a weak pining wife all these years, could think that he had got what he had deserved ; but she offered no remark, and the next speech of Tom's was in a very cheerful key. \" I should not wonder though you got your green-house after all, Abigail,\" he said, looking up brightly. \"Mrs. Prior,\" said Dr. Winkworth, bluntly, turning from his patient to his patient's wife, \" you are in for one of your chest colds ; I have been expecting it for some time, and now you are loaded with it. How could you be so imprudent as to sit in a draught yesterday ? \" Abigail rebutted the attack with a twinkle in her eyes. \" I assure you, Doctor, that I did not sit much on any- thing. I was out : I was busy yesterday, and I am not going to have a cold ; do not say so.\" \" I think Mrs. Prior is looking very weU,\" asserted Tom, from where he was laid on his back, manfully standing up with weak but willing valour for his wife. \" To my mind, nursing a sick man does very well with her.\" \" Once on a time, Tom, for a change. After all your bullying of me, it is a treat to have you in my power,\" answered Abigail, with a fall in her voice. Abigail had nursed her husband unweariedly, indefatig- ably, with stores of tenderness, which had not till now been set free in the bosom of the daughter, wife, and mother. What had become of her bronchitis, pleurisy ? Vanished in smoke, Not that Abigad was a monomaniac, though something of a valetudinarian. Most people have seen or heard of the effeots of a shock on an invalid sometimes : how such a one will rise from a"], [278, "266 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. sofa or even a sick bed, and minister to the strong man or woman who has taken her place, to be ministered to instead of to minister ; will perform the most trying duties ; wdl keep the most exhausting watch, while the world looks out for the break-down of the forced strength, till it is compelled to cry \" A miracle ! \" Sometimes it is great Death which is the shock, and the sufferer who was mourned over as bereft, indeed, when the friend on whom he or she leant, is removed, is restored to lde and the world by the stroke \u2014 having only one regret left \u2014 that the eyes which would have shone brightest to witness the resuscitation are closed in this world. But what if spirit eyes beam from the stars on the last Lazarus ? \" His ways are not as our ways.\" Abigail cast disgrace on Dr. Winkworth, after all his attention to her husband, by not taking his cold ; and the strenuous exertions which she employed against it, were hardly fair play. She snuffed camphor, she painted herself like a red Indian with iodine, she gargled, she steamed, she had recourse to hot water, she had recourse to cold, she turned out, to the delight of her little boys, in masquerade, and they found mamma made a pretty guy with a coal-scuttle of an old opera-hood on her head, and a royal fur tippet, like that of the King Edwards, round her shoulders. And when she did not take her cold, Abigail smiled and sighed again. When Tom was able to go to the factory again, he came home and took to studying why his wife gave him so many furtive, inquisitive glances, whether they were all on ac count of his health, or whether they had any other origin. It was a luxury for him to study Abigad in a new light. Notwithstanding her nervousness, her late fatigue and arrested cold, and the important circumstance that she was a woman over thirty, Abigail was looking prettier than she had done since she was a girl of nineteen, and Humphrey Bingham had been in love with her. Tom fancied her ten times prettier than he had ever seen her. It might be because in laying aside the last alternative of the opera hood and the fur tippet, she had taken the opportunity of discarding her shawl and lace cap along with them, and appeared in her fresh summer gown, with her pulled-out bronze hair. It might be because she had made a great escape, and a new spring had been given to her lde."], [279, "TEN TEARS AFTER. 267 Jack and Joe had told their father that first when he had been ill, mamma had been miserable, and then when he grew better she had grown funny, and she had promised to continue funny if they would be good boys, and not tease papa to draw for them, and to go down on all fours to be the umpire in their games of marbles \u2014 instead mamma had cut out in paper, girls' things, to be sure \u2014 but such jolly rows of dolls dancing arm-in-arm, and flowers in flower-pots. Abigail had become more interested in her housekeeping since she was under the necessity of exerting herself, and walked about cogitating profoundly, with keys in her hands, or sat dipping into house-keeping manuals and cookery-books, in place of into wise discussions on silver hairs and evening clouds. With the extravagance and im- petuosity of woman, she had tied round her still slim waist a bran new black silk apron, as if there lurked sovereign virtue in that terribly democratical, determinedly middle- class, and unflinchingly practical piece of wearing apparel. It amused Tom immensely, to an extent that no superior person could conceive, to note these innocent preparations. At last Abigail stepped up to him one evening, when he was standing idle by the window, and impressed upon him solemnly that she believed it was true what Ashley said about the housemaid Dorothy, she was getting spoilt with too little work, so Dorothy's mistress had come to the conclusion that she ought to part with her domestic. \" But I thought you had a Hking for Dorothy, Abigail,\" remonstrated Tom, checking an inclination to cry out, \" You little humbug ! \" Abigail was taken aback, and smitten in her conscience. Yes, of course she had a liking for Dorothy, who was an honest, warm-hearted girl, though a little wilful, and had been very attentive and concerned when her master was lying ill. She had cried and declared that he had never spoken a rough word to her, and that however engrossed, he had always found time for a smde, and a \" Is that you, Dorothy ? \" when he met her abroad. \" Ah, Tom, you did not know how much you were thought of,\" said Abigail in parenthesis. But it was a losing of Dorothy to keep her there and not give her work to do. There was not sufficient work since"], [280, "268 LOVE LIES BLEEDING. the boys were all day at school, and Mrs. Prior was so weU that she meant to take more management of the house. There was no one like the lady of the house in looking after it : she was persuaded it would be good for her now that she was strong enough for it. There was a young sister of Dorothy's, who could come and help when they washed, and with the doing up of the boys' clothes. Would he not believe her ? Abigail at last besought Tom, getting desperate at the stony look in his face, while he resorted to the old dangerous habit of tugging whiskers, ragged, and as if sprinkled with ashes. She could do like other women with one experienced servant, and a little assistance now and then. Poor Mrs. Leech had to do with less since she had lost poor Captain Leech ; so had the new curate's young wife ; and she was better connected than Abigad : would he not listen to reason ? \" No, I won't,\" Tom declined stoutly. \" I never heard a more preposterous proposal in my life. It may do for poor Mrs. Leech, who cannot help hersed; or for the curate's wife, with love in a cottage for the honeymoon ; but you have not lost your husband, though you have been near to it, and we are an old married couple, with two great boys.

Humphrey Bingham advances the money ; he can very well afford to do it, and the venture will pay him more or less. He said that his eldest boy flattered himself he would die a field-marshal ; but, for aught Humphrey him self knew, clothing, not killing the enemy, might be the thing before Wakefield or little Humphrey were ready to leave Rugby, and either of them might have a greater mania for usefulness than ever their father had had.

Abigail was agitated also. \"You are not angry with me for interfering, Tom? \" Now, however Abigail might have erred, she had cer tainly not been meddlesome or domineering ; so Tom pro tested that her self-condemned whisper was \" the most unkindest cut of all.\" \" I am thinking of the first Abigail, who rode out on her ass to meet King David among the palm-trees, with the loaves and the bunches of raisins ; but she was in terror for her life, and was bound for the captivation of her second husband, \u2014 was not that it ?

Angry because my wife was good and romantic ! \" Tom was playing all manner of wild pranks ; the fever might have returned and gone to his brain, as he stroked the bronze hair, even the flag of an apron, and blessed his wde. Yet Abigail felt a spasm of disappointment and a little sense of failure. She was an unworldly enthusiastic woman. Ten years and more ago, the moral backbone of her innocent, happy, girhsh nature, had sustained a hor rible injury, and although it had been set with splints very soon \u2014 perhaps too soon afterwards \u2014 it had never recovered its vitality and elasticity until Tom Prior's dlness and Tom Prior's wife's knowledge of his silent, self-ignoring cares and toils. To bring back Abigail, like Eurydice, from the brink of Hades, Tom had to play Orpheus and go down himself, without grudging, among the shades.

Abigail was still struggling with the sense of discourage ment and with the conviction that she was an ungrateful woman, next day, after Tom had gone to the factory, when she was roused by her mother nodding joyously to her as she rang the door bell. \" My dear, I cannot stop a moment ; I met Mr. Prior at the end of the street looking so much improved since Wed nesday ; but I took the precaution of hoping that he was able to go back and forwards and eat a good dinner after it. ' Come and see, grandmamma ; we have not dined together since I was on beef tea, and now I eat beef like a grazier, and trot on my beat like a postman.' \" Of course I am delighted to come ; I only looked in to tell you that I had sent in a pair of spring chickens with asparagus, and a cut of salmon and oysters for the occasion.

She was wed off \u2014 she knew it now ; she would not change grey Tom and the rough boys for all the florid Humphrey Binghams and caressing girls in the world. It was fitter, too, that Tom should go on and win the battle for himself, having the credit and the reward, and only giving Abigail her due share. It was far kinder to Humphrey, to let him be generous to his old friend, and to let him retain the consciousness as a cool green spot in the blaze of that unmingled prosperity, which is apt to scorch and harden God's garden of man's soul, till it is an arid wilderness.

THE FIRST MEETING. Between fifty and sixty years ago Tunbridge Wells was still in the sunset of its glory. It might be, nay, it had always been, a cockney paradise, but the cockneyism con tinued more or less aristocratic so long as royal dukes paid flying visits to the Pantiles and the Assembly Rooms, and princesses tarried for weeks enjoying the benefit of the waters. Tunbridge was found the proper combination of nature and art, of chalked boards and grey rocks, green tables and green fields, early and late hours, which the gay world of a former generation took to mean rural felicity \u2014 supposing rural felicity existed. The impression lasted after the master of the ceremonies had become a mere decorous cipher in comparison with the half gallant, half brutal tyrant of former days. Parties of ladies of quality drove out still on the pleasant country roads to Frant or to Southburgh in the state of a barouche-and-four, though they had ceased to masquerade in the guise of orange-girls and farmers' daughters, when courtiers chaffered with buxom, red-cheeked wenches at the fair on Tunbridge Common. So late as 1807 a young lady of fortune eloped with a player from Tunbridge Wells. Hostile meetings continued to be held among the more remote golden gorse of Rusthall, by gentlemen in"], [285, "273 THE FIRST MEETING. high-necked, short-waisted coats, and plaited shirt-frills, like that held by Castlereagh and Canning nearer town, where the least that could be apprehended was a flesh wound or a shot in the thigh, not counted dangerous. The Kent Fencibles were in great favour with the whole country, as who could tell when their services might not be required, to repel an invasion, from the news at home and abroad of the sailing of ships and the marching of armies. The great Walcheren expedition had gone out, and come back again, minus the victims of ague. Sir Sydney Smith was heard of here and Sir Arthur Wellesley there; and the word from Germany was bitterly bad, though the tidings from Russia were highly cheering. The old world had not lost its gay and strong, no, nor its coarse, tints. During one autumn, between fifty and sixty years ago, there arrived at Tunbridge Wells, under the guardianship of her grandmother, Lady Stukely, Lady Catherine For tescue, of Oxham. Lady Catherine was a young orphan of rank, fortune, and beauty, whose parents had both died in her infancy ; while the estates of the earl, her father, had descended, by the terms of its entail, to Lady Catherine, separate from the earldom, which had passed to the heir male. Lady Stukely and Lady Catherine lodged in a house, already old-fashioned, on the Parade, with its gable front ing the street, its red roof, and its balcony, commanding a fine view of the early and late promenaders (though national and world-wide lions were no longer so obliging as to stalk and roar in packs below), and of the charmed fountain in the centre of the street, where the merchants of the four seasons in flowers, vegetables, and fruit, were wont to congregate on the steps amidst splendid, luscious bits of Flemish colouring \u2014 made up of tiger HUes and creamy white roses, of radishes and cucumbers, of crimson strawberries, or of amber and amethyst plums. The same accommodating balcony commanded the con stant tide of company going to and coming from the principal hotel opposite, and, in addition, had a view of restful glimpses of quiet parklike woods and pastures, by comparison, far away. The Tunbridge assemblies began at so primitive an hour that Lady Catherine, seated T"], [286, "274 RUE before her high, narrow mirror, could glance out, while all was still barred with sunshine and shadow, at the busy outer world, in which she took a lively interest, where, to promenade with her grandmother and her grandmother's friends to the music of the band, to watch the general company, to do a little shopping, were treats only next in order to this long-looked-forward-to, eagerly-anticipated ball. Of course Lady Catherine was very foolish and ignorant, though she was supposed to be solidly instructed in the information and accomplishments of her rank and era, and she had been put through a good deal of reading \u2014 such as it was \u2014 English, French and Italian, thanks to which she could accompany herself, tunefully, on the harp when she sang, \"Di Tanti Palpiti \" and \"Said a Smile to a Tear.\" But she was charmingly natural, and charmingly lovely at this period of her life, with a loveliness which is difficult to describe ; it was at once so fresh and so dainty, like that of a lady's smock out in the Tunbridge meadows ; but the lady's smocks were to be found in thousands, and Lady Catherine, taking her all in all, was unique. She had a very fair, shell-pink tinted complexion, contrasting, plea santly, with chestnut-brown hair, small delicate features belonging to a little oval face, and cheerful grey eyes, opening in a mixture of wonder and trust on what seemed to her a happy world where, orphan as she was, and with out brother or sister, she had never wanted friends. Lady Catherine's ball dress was of dim pearly-white crape, with a border worked in silver shells, and looped up with silver cords and tassels. She wore on her shapely girlish head a small white satin hat, inclining a little over one temple, with a single Prince of Wales' feather fastened in its band by the Oxham cluster of diamond wheat-ears which Lady Catherine's mother had worn on her presenta tion to young Queen Charlotte. The little hat alone might have made its wearer look like an Arcadian shepherdess, but its combination with the single wavy white feather standing up in front of the tiny ear, as the finishing stroke of the taste of the day to the dress of a young lady in Lady Catherine's position, constituted the fairy princess who was starting to meet the prince. The hat and feather took nothing from the youthfulness of the aspirant, while"], [287, "275 THE FIRST MEETING. it added to that youthfulness an indescribable element of maidenly dignity and stateliness perfectly compatible with modesty and sprightliness. Lady Catherine looked at herself with innocent com placency, and in her trepidation arranged a fold here and a knot there, beat time with eager foot to imaginary dance airs, drew on her gloves to try and beguile the interval which must elapse before Lady Stukely, who had been anxiously overlooking her granddaughter's toilette, should have completed her own. Lady Catherine had pledged herself to sit as steady as a rock, not rise and run about and plume herself like a restless bird deranging its fine feathers in the pluming. But the restlessness was getting the better of her, and even healthy young Lady Catherine was in danger of becoming nervous over her debut. Her fleeting glances out of the window were fixed by an arrival at the hotel opposite, and she seized on the diversion. \" Sally, what is going on ? what do you see there ? \" Lady Catherine called to her elderly maid, who, now that she had discharged the most onerous functions that her office was ever likely to bring her \u2014 unless it should be on Lady Catherine's wedding morning, had retired to a seat at the window and resumed her work methodically, only intermitting it to keep a watchful, admiring eye on her young mistress. This Sally, with regard to whom Lady Catherine did not fall into the hard unfeminine habit, just coming into practice, of dropping the Christian name and employing merely the surname, was a link between the picturesque Abigails of Pope's \" Betty \" type and the com monplace or tawdry soubrettes represented by \"Jenkins,\" or \" Dawson,\" \" Dupont,\" or \" Schmidt.\" Sally Judd was not a dame de compagnie as imperious, whimsical and saucy as her mistress, neither was she an enterprising hair dresser's or milhner's assistant, whose merit lay in her fingers, or, at farthest, in her eyes. Sally could not only say her church catechism and the responses in her prayer book by heart, read and write and cast up accounts, she could bake and brew, and distil scents and medicine, besides bein_: an adept at plain sewing. She had some experience of human life ; she was trustworthy and sen sible ; though not a dame de compagnie, she was a com panionable woman."], [288, "276 RUE Sally, sitting in her good, sober gown, white apron and cap, sewing busily, responded to her mistress's appeal. \" There is a travelling chariot just entering the inn yard, Lady Catherine, and a party of five officers alighting.\" \" Oh, dear, how late they will be,\" Lady Catherine clasped her hands and regretted, disinterestedly ; \" they will miss the opening by the Master and her Grace and all the earlier sets.\" \" But you will not miss 'em, my lady.\" Sally comforted her mistress with a short, half-bashful compliment. \"Who, I? I dare say I shall not notice the naughty men who come late. I shall have more to do.\" Lady Catherine pretended to give herself airs, laughing joyously at the pretence. But Lady Catherine did notice these late-comers in spite of everything \u2014 her own tri umphant success, among other impediments, \u2014 partly be cause the strangers were worthy of notice, partly because there is a fate and a Providence in men and women's des tinies. Lady Stukely joined Lady Catherine, as desirable a chaperon as could be got by wisdom, reputation, the hoary crown of a high head, the splendour of the brocade, lace, and jewels, \u2014 above all the finish of the manners of the old regime, and individually by the innate truth and tenderness of a staunch old spirit, which no long appren ticeship to worldly ways could render more than super ficially worldly. The ladies walked as the evening was fine, in the lingering inadvertent homeliness of the artificial world on this side of the Channel, which capped the mock simplicity maintained by a violent effort on the revolutionized shores of France. Lady Stukely and her granddaughter were attended by a couple of men-servants, to prevent their being too pressingly waited on by a crowd of respectable admirers among the townspeople, whom such a spectacle entranced \" mightily,\" to the doors of the Assembly Rooms. Later in the evening, the same townspeople would not think it beneath their dignity to get up, on the Pantiles, rival country dances to those of the nobility and gentry within, but jigged blithely to the music, floating through the open windows, of the one instrumental band. Was it not a social world, though it was also a world of extrava-"], [289, "THE FIRST MEETING. 277 gance and excess, sometimes of vile debauchery, on which the setting sun shone between fifty and sixty years ao-o ? The due buzz of admiration had been given on Lady Catherine's entrance, the due throng of solicitations for the honour of an introduction, and the felicity of being her partner, had followed. Other stars of the season \u2014 the beautiful Miss Heathcotes, understood to be penniless adventuresses, but so much the rage, and so likely to wed, in unwary moments, enamoured dukes, or earls at least, that rash squires could not refrain from singeing then- wings ; Miss Larkins, the great city heiress, for when were city heiresses not in the field ? and they were more con- spicuous, more marked by mammon ugliness in a former than in the present generation \u2014 subsided discreetly, or with a little unavailing angry twinkle gave way to the unmistakable rising sun. Lady Stukely, after having taken care to do a little severe weeding to the candidates for her granddaughter's notice, saw her present task in a manner happily ended, and her goal attained. She delegated its slight remaining duties to qualified allies, and in consideration of her own years and honourable labours, adowed herself to be seated at the principal card table. There Lady Stukely arranged her cards like a high-bred connoisseur in card playing, who had played at the loo table of the late Princess Emily, and was elegant rather than offensive in taking snuff after the fashion of Queen Charlotte herself, while she received a more fragrant incense to sweeten the tit-bits of scandal between the deals, in the assurance of this night's establish- ment of her granddaughter's prospects. Now and then Lady Stukely turned her glass lovingly on her charge, and there was Lady Catherine, fair as a lily, and fresh as a rose, with that feather of hers nodding and beckoning in fine majesty and harmony. The gdl was really dancing, not walking, with tripping, bounding feet, by the aid of an interminable succession of happy, gallant, and \u2014 as Lady Stukely took care \u2014 fitting partners down the central alleys and up the side vistas of double performances of the Triumph and the White Cockade, the genuine English country-dances still holding their ground against the mongrel quadrille which had displaced the courtly minuet. Waltzing had been brought over into England before the"], [290, "278 RUE. wane of the Great Empire, and of the first famous waltzers at Almacks, there was one at least, who, like Sir Chris topher Hatton of Elizabethan memories, whatever he might owe to his heels, was not to risk his whole fame on them. But such ladies as Lady Stukely were slow to award their patronage, in the persons of their young daughters and granddaughters, to round dances. Lady Catherine did not weary. She was so naive as to admire the chalked boards and the decoration of the ceiling, as well as the company ; the increasing smell of white soup and negus did not disgust her, but she was never too engrossed to notice the various entrances into the rooms down to the last \u2014 that of a party of officers, no doubt the same whom Sally Judd had seen alighting in the inn-yard. The group was made up of several marked men of rank and fashion, imposing, from their easy, nonchalant, critical air, if from nothing else ; advanced as the evening was, their progress up the crowded room created a new sensa tion. Soon Lady Catherine experienced that she had a formidable rival as the observed of all observers, not only in the group where union is strength, but in its central figure, a dark, bold, gay-looking young man, wearing gracefully enough the uniform of a staff officer. Who was he ? What had he done, to be on the staff at his age ? Was he indeed Lord Robert Luttrell, a son of the Duke of Salop's ? \u2014 the same son who had done so dashing a thing in the course of the taking and burning of Copenhagen last year, and he, a mere boy, from his mother's apron string ? Yes ; and it was said that he was a favourite of Sir Arthur's, and now he had come across from Portugal, only ten days ago, with despatches. He was fresh from the seat of war and from the glorious victory of Vimiera, he was the supposed bearer of news of friend and foe \u2014 private and political \u2014 of the rival kings, Ferdinand and Joseph ; of Wellesley, Crawford, and Hill ; of Junot, Kellermann, and Murat, though he might well have been many a league from those worthies. What was any heroine \u2014 any lovely, young lady Catherine, heiress of Oxham, even, to such a hero ? It ought to have been hard to have her honours snatched from her, and more than divided with another, on the very first nio-ht of"], [291, "279 THE FIRST MEETING. her reign : but Lady Catherine, though accustomed to be made much of, and delighted to confer favour and afford delight, had a magnanimous soul at seventeen. With but the most infinitesimal and transient pang, at which she laughed and blushed the next moment, she fell unresist ingly into the background, as her neighbours had done before her ; nay, she went before them in hurrying with the hurrying multitude to offer her gracious homage to the king, in whose honour she was a deposed queen. Lady Catherine suffered from the scarlet-fever epidemic of the period. She had imbibed the infection from so mature a patient as Lady Stukely, who, discreet in all else, was a red-hot patriot \u2014 as warlike in her proclivities as if she had been the aged widow of a fighting baron of the eleventh or twelfth century, and not of a peaceful, turnip growing, road-mending viscount, who had belonged pro perly to the eighteenth century ere it was convulsed by the French Revolution. Lord Robert was the first real Hve hero that Lady Catherine's lustrous eyes had rested and feasted on; and she discovered, within a very few minutes of viewing his perfections, that it was far better to have found a hero than to be a heroine, to give glory than to receive it. What ! had that sunburnt eager face, not above four or five years older than her own, looked bravely and without blanching on scenes of horror and affright, while the slim, almost boyish figure had stood unwavering the brunt of hail-storms of shot, and charges of bayonets, keeping his post and rallying the troops behind, till a commanding officer, who had received his death-wound, was dragged out of fire, to die in the shelter of the stack of wood which had served for house and bed, and for the last fainting memories of home ? Lady Catherine's eyes grew larger, her face rosier, and then her generous sympathy had its reward. After strolling a little up and down, staring merrily \u2014 not impudently \u2014 in return for the stares he got, chatting frankly with those who were presented to him, only elevat ing his eyebrows occasionally at the questions addressed to him, and being guilty of but a few dresistible canards. Lord Robert's eye was caught by the face and figure of Lady Catherine Fortescue. He stopped short, smitten like"], [292, "280 RUE. an impulsive boy, not knowing who she was, like a bar barian from the wars, bent on improving his opportunity, Hke the spoilt child of fortune that he had been. \" Who is that lovely girl \u2014 that divine creature ? \" \"Lady Catherine Fortescue \u2014 young beauty \u2014 high rank \u2014 great fortune \u2014 just come out; \u2014 Tunbridge had the honour of her bursting bloom ; \u2014 first appearance in the rooms this very night \u2014 tremendous impression \u2014 nothing like it since the Gunnings \u2014 Maulesdale, Sir Raaf, Five-bar Meredith, greatest catches here \u2014 all been attracted, flutter ing in her train \u2014 all caught, who knows ? \" was the information communicated in emphatic fragments to the inquirer. \"By George!\" protested the hero \u2014 it was uncertain whether he swore by the king or the saint ; considering everything, one would have said by the king \u2014 \"I must dance with her.\" \" Im \u2014 possible ; engaged three, six, nine deep.

In the first glow of his herodom, and of the satellites' hero-worship, to thwart and vex Lord Robert as if he were an ordinary mortal was not to be thought of. The Duke of Salop's son \u2014 this son the fighter of his country's battles, the conquering hero, or at least the hero who would conquer in the end \u2014 deserved better at the hands of his grateful admirers. One obliging fellow flew to the master of the ceremonies to make known to him the dilemma ; another, an elderly enthusiast, a friend of Lady Stukely's, apprized her of the laurels which she and Lady Catherine were in danger of losing, and whispered to the guardian and grandmother that Lord Robert, though a younger son, inherited a good estate in Sussex from his maternal grand father ; a third, the shrewdest helper of all, observed that one of Lady Catherine's promised partners had forgotten himself and her, and was incapable of profiting by his good fortune (a casualty not unheard-of in those days), having in the meantime indulged in such rash potations in the refreshment-room that he had been carried senseless from"], [293, "281 THE FIRST MEETING. the field to his lodgings, along with other vanquished men overtaken by the same evil hap. What so easy as for Lord Robert, by these combined forces,, to step into the vacant shoes of his unconscious predecessor hors de combat ? Lord Robert danced with Lady Catherine, certainly with- out shirking a couple of the two overflowing sets. Then he stood beside her looking down at her, leaning over her, talking to her, till all the other couples had danced loyally and exultingly after the couple of the night. In the advantage of establishing innocent familiarity in rational intercourse, these old-fashioned country-dances were, in comparison with modern dances, what the stage-coach was to railway travelling. In evidence, recall how fienry Tilney had the opportunity to amuse himself and full in love with the tastes of Catherine Morland, and how Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett discussed and disputed principles, all between the \" cross hands and down the middle and up again.\" Next, by another stroke of a benign destiny, that dance concluded just as tbe signal was given for supper, and Lord Robert had the supreme happiness of escorting Lady Catherine to the supper-room, of serving her with chicken and claret cup, and of convincing himself, more and more to his own undoing and enslavement, how perfect his com- panion was in more than her young beauty or her gifts of fortune. How unaffected, how ingenuous, what a good listener he found her ! She did not compel him to rack his brains and go back to last year's topic- \u2014 what she thought of Catalani's singing and Young's playing \u2014 for the great Yorkshire election and Sir Francis Burdett's triumphal car would not have been much in a young lady's way. He might have stumbled on the Duchess of Brunswick's arrival in the country, and what effect the event would have on the differences in a certain royal household, for all women, young and old, were interested in a man and wife's quarrels. But he was saved the trouble. Lady Catherine was prepared to hang breathless on his stories of transports, disembarkations, marches, and bivouacs among cork trees and vineyards ; above all, on his description of a pitched battle. She put quick, intelligent questions in the sweetest of voices, laughed melodiously, turned away her graceful head in its hat and feather, to hide the tender moisture"], [294, "282 RUE, which dimmed her bright eyes, when he knew his own were wet, as he entered into the tragic spirit of some of his narratives, and talked with a Httle faltering in his simple eloquence. Lady Catherine came back from her first ball with a head as nearly turned and a heart as nearly lost as ever Lady Catherine's or young beauty's head and heart were, and in danger of capitulation on the first summons. Why, even Lady Stukely had not been proof against the spell ! Her own old head and heart were not quite in her keeping after all she had greedily swallowed of \" the handsomest, best matched young couple that eyes were ever set on; \" of \" the old fascinating romance in love at first sight warming one's heart ; \" of \" Dan Cupid's being worth all the heralds and gentlemen-ushers in the world, at the same time when they and Dan shook hands and walked in good-fellowship, it was a sight for an admiring universe \u2014 a sight almost more than this great human quality-world could stand without dying of envy: \" of \"none but the brave deserv ing the fair, from the days of Alexander downwards.\" But Lady Stukely was old, and a little worn out with all this success and unexpected excitement. She retired to rest as soon as she had reached her lodging. Lady Catherine, too young to feel fatigue, or to entertain a doubt, all palpitating with emotion \u2014 very naturally, but very suddenly and swiftly, awakened, could not go to bed and to sleep immediately, and wished to talk over her adventures, and to recount what she could of her impres sions. In her brotherless, sisterless state she had none to talk to but Sally Judd, and so to Sally, considerably over come with sleep, yet with patience and interest to spare, as she unfastened Lady Catherine's dress and brushed her hair, Lady Catherine sat and prattled about the ball. And Sally was sharp enough to remark how perpetually the name of Lord Robert Luttrel \u2014 \" the gallant young soldier from the Peninsula, you know, Sally \" \u2014 slipped out, and late as had been Lord Robert's attendance at the rooms, how his figure superseded and overshadowed every other figure, and how Lady Catherine's cheeks and eyes burned and glowed as she mentioned him. Sally said to herself, in her plain way, \" The business is done.

It's like he'll consent, for Lady Catherine and Oxham are not gifts to be east away. Shouldn't I like to get a look at him ! but that will come in good time.\" Even after Sally had been dismissed, Lady Catherine could not come down from her giddy height of happiness, but flitted about in her white dressing-gown with her twinkling bare feet, reproaching herself for not settling to say her prayers, peeping out at the stars, and opening the window an inch for a Httle air. It was at that moment when, retreating hastily from the sound of the last feet of the ball-goers on the Pantiles below, that Lady Catherine detected a quick step, which all at once lingered. At the same time she distinguished a well-remembered voice that had thrilled her not two hours before, in the pauses of the interminable dance, and amidst the clatter of knives and forks and tongues in the supper-room. The voice said now (could she forgive its loud openness and vehement asser tion ?), \" Is this where she lives ? By George ! I will never rest till I have secured her for my wife.\" CHAPTER II. ANOTHER MEETING. Vert little more was called for in order that Lord Robert might redeem his pledge. A few promenades on the Pantiles, a punctual attendance at the Assemblies, a morn ing service at church, a bewitching gipsy tea among the frowning, yawning, tangled beauties of the High Rocks, a delightful dreamy ride through the oak and birch coppice, and the high green hollies to the ruins at Bayham, were all the occasions on which Lady Catherine and Lord Robert saw each other, before the two promised to become one, and to be true to each other for life and death. Lord Robert rejoined the army ; Lady Catherine was presented at Court, where she was rallied by royal lips on her interest in the war, as she went through her first season. Four or five years of lovers' separation followed."], [296, "284 RUE Then, like a thunder-clap in a summer sky, unclouded as it had been the moment before, the blow fell \u2014 so simple a blow, yet so grievous and manifold in its consequences, and a trial so difficult to realize in our days of merciful modifi cations and compensations. Fifty or sixty years since sounds so short a time for us to go back and regard with wonder and pity troubles which hardly come near the present generation, working on natures which were not trained as ours have been. Yet not more than sixty years ago the entire colony of New South Wales was in danger of perishing from a single sailing vessel's not arriving in time to supply the colonists with a fresh store of provision to replace their last ounces of musty flour and salt pork. Jenner had lived to receive a vote of thirty thousand pounds from Parliament ere this, but small-pox was still, what God forbid it should be again, one of the scourges of the human race. This scourge met Lady Catherine face to face, waiting in her youth, bloom, and happiness for her lover, whom she was persuaded \u2014 not in audacity and arro gance, but in sheer inexperience \u2014 that Heaven must spare. The small-pox spared her life and sight, but took every thing besides, save what belonged to that immortal part of her which neither plague nor pestilence could reach ; the small-pox branded her as St. Dunstan is said to have seared with hot irons the face of the Saxon maiden, Elgitha, before risking an encounter with her royal lover. At twenty-one, Lady Catherine Fortescue was a bodily wreck, sickly, emaciated, her exquisite complexion irre trievably ruined, her delicate features coarsely blurred, her fine eyes heavy and dim : at her age, in her circumstances, belonging to a class and to a stage of civilization in which personal advantages were very potent, the sentence of reverse was frightful. Lady Catherine rose so far to meet it. The first time that she was able, her trembling hand caught up her gold pen. She had often twirled it happily in her white fingers, considering what pretty, bashfully restrained, but trans parently-loving phrases she should use to her absent lover, whose effusions, however debatable in grammar and orthography, never failed in passionate recollections of her beauty, and anticipations of its perfection, with fervent"], [297, "ANOTHER MEETING. 285 vows of allegiance to the balsam cheek, the dove-grey eyes, the rosebud of a mouth, the soft warm cloud of brown hair \u2014 all of which had suffered eclipse and transformation down to the drawn purple lips, and the thinned locks. Now Lady Catherine wrote straight to the point : \u2014 \" I have had the small-pox, to my great grief, for your sake, as well as for my own, since, though I have recovered, I am quite altered \u2014 I doubt, even, if you would know me again. At least, you would never more call me your little beauty. I have become a very plain girl. My mirror told me so whenever I was allowed to look into it, and my friends could not deny the evidence. In addition, I fear that my health is shattered, I continue so weak and to have so many ailments. I know you are very sorry for me, as I am sorry for you in your disappointment, but since neither you nor I could have anticipated the melancholy end to our plans, I do not think it is right \u2014 believe me, I recoil from binding you to a marred lot which God, who sent it to me, will give me strength to bear alone. But at your age, and in our rank, with its obligations, to persist in tying your self to a disfigured, dull, and fretful invalid (for I am all that, Lord Robert), would not only be very foolish, it would be unsuitable and injurious. Don't let your generosity mislead you. Take back your word, and I shall take back mine. I shall never blame you, even in thought. I shall always take the deepest interest in your welfare, and perhaps one day we may meet as friends. I am not fit to write more, except that I pray God to bless you now, and ever. Catherine Fortescue.\" If there is anything hard, stiff, and unnatural in this letter, remember that it was written by a creature not only stricken, but gagged. Lord Robert realized that, when he replied in gallant indignation \u2014 not resentment \u2014 that no change in his Catherine could make any change in him. He should only hold her dearer for what the world and she might err and esteem her loss. He would not restore her her word, though she restore him his twenty times. Had such a proposal come from a man, though he had been Lord Robert's commander-in-chief, Lord Robert would have considered it so heavy a reflection on him as a man"], [298, "286 RUE and gentleman that he would have had the proposer \" out \" before the day was done, risking a court-martial. But to stop Lady Catherine's dear mouth, he would move heaven and earth to get leave, or he would be tempted to take French leave and share the fate of Sir Home Popham and his squadron. He would marry her out of hand, and carry her off with him to recruit in a mild climate, at Lisbon, or nearer the forces, where many English ladies ventured to take up their abode and make English colonies, to be within reach of their husbands. Poor young Lady Catherine in her twenty-second year was comforted a little by that warm, swaggering letter which she read, till it was so wasted by severe wear and tear that she had to encase it in two tiny boards, bound with blue ribbon, in order that it might be preserved to be buried with her. (Was it buried with her, after all ?) But in the meantime she began to look up faintly, and to have some heart in her recovery, and some hope in her life. There was reviving trust, struggling successfully with despair in her pathetic question to her faithful Sally. \" Do you think Lord Robert will be able to bear the sight of me, Sally ? He cared so much for my looks ; men put so much weight on looks. They were all that he had time or perhaps inclination to see in me. But if he never thought of Oxham, and you know he was too noble and true to do that, don't you think it is just possible that he may not heed my ugliness, and care only for me \u2014 that part of me which is left to love him so ? \" Lady Stukely was pleased, though she was also dubious and nervous. Then Lord Robert sent a courier express to announce that he had got leave, he would sail in a few days, and if his packet were not caught by the enemy, he would be in England at the heels of his messenger before February was ended. But as he must be out in Spain again early in April, he urged that every preparation should be made in the meantime, and that his bride should be ready to marry on a moment's warning, and start like a soldier's wife with her husband on his campaigning. Lady Stukely and Lady Catherine were gone with the first breath of spring to Tunbridge Wells to try what the waters would do to retrieve the desolation of disease, as people had recourse then to mineral wells for aH trivial and"], [299, "287 ANOTHER MEETING. all fatal complaints of the most widely varied type \u2014 for vapours, consumption, gout, atrophy, crediting the waters with miraculous power which only an angel coming down and troubling them could have conferred. Tunbridge Wells out of season was as good a locality as another for the celebration of a marriage, which, even without regard to its history, was to be consummated quietly and speedily in the temporary reaction of fashion from the splendid coach-and-six, twelve best men and twelve best maids, troops of friends and heaps of livery of the Grandisonian era. But Tunbridge Wells in spring, \u2014 before primroses were thick as daisies on every grassy bank, blue-bells gemming each dingle, cuckoos calling in the Penshurst and the Erridge woods, \u2014 was another place from Tunbridge in the bounty of autumn. It was bare as its hop poles, and bleak as its common. Yet marriage was never so abridged of joyous honour and festivity, never so clogged with drawbacks, and the scene of it was never so ungenial as to prevent its being the one marriage in the world to its own particular bride. Let it be ever so shorn and spoiled, it will serve to occupy and interest her in all its details for days and weeks beforehand. This peculiarly feminine fascination was a boon to Lady Catherine, above all at the date when Lord Robert an nounced himself so near as Dover, where he was to sleep and recruit from a stormy voyage, purposing to post to Tunbridge Wells so as to reach it two days before the wedding-day, and one day before their graces of Salop, with sundry lords and ladies Luttrel, travelling in the family coach, arrived for the same happy event. Lady Catherine was fain to tax to the uttermost her slight strength, with the choice arrangement of pelisses and morning gowns, and wraps, and of the mails which con tained them. She was driven to interest herself in the procuring of the special license, the reading of the marriage settlement, the bridal chariot, the hotels where it was to stop, the accommodation for Sally Judd, (how Lady Cathe rine clung to Sally) and Lord Robert's man in the rumble, the letters which were to be written to Lady Stukely from ship-board, and at the moment of landing in a foreign city. It was all to escape the thought of the imminent meeting which had been imagined in every way except the one way"], [300, "288 RUE in which it came about, and which had been longed for till the longing had died out in sick reluctance. By a species of instinct and unspoken sense of fitness, such as belongs to a sensitive temperament, Lady Catherine had dressed herself for the occasion in a costume as far removed as possible from that of the soft white crape and shining white satin hat with its nodding feather in which she had danced before Lord Robert at his first ball. The cold spring winds and her feeble health, together with the hour just after noon, afforded excuse for the poor young woman's shrouding her defects in what was then called a great coat of dark bottle-green cloth, trimmed with black fur, to which belonged a plaited frid tied by a neckerchief up to her ears, and a round cap drawn down to her nose. In this guise Lady Catherine looked like a living mummy when she rose cold and trembling at the sound of carriage wheels dashing up and stopping at the door. Lady Catherine had proffered an irresistible request to her grandmother that the interview with her bridegroom should be private. Thus alone and unsupported \u2014 not hurrying with flying feet and panting breath, but standing nailed to the floor of the artificial, flimsy, lodging-house drawing-room, Lady Catherine heard again with sharpened, strained sense, after all that had come and gone, his voice with its mellowness roughened by anxiety and eagerness, his step spurning the space between them, resounding and drawing nearer, till he burst into the room \u2014 a man in the first flush of manhood, radiant with strength, power, grace, and warm passion, all the more radiant, as it seemed, for the glow of agitation in which he presented himself. That glow of agitation blinded Lord Robert for a moment, as he sprang forward open armed to the solitary shrinking figure. Then his sun-burnt colour waned to a dusky pallor, his eyes opened wide, his lips dropped apart as he stopped short for a second, Hke a man who had received a revelation and had been stunned and confused by it as by a staggering blow, before he clasped and wrung the damp, shivering hands extended towards him. \" My God ! \" he groaned aloud in the moment of stopping, \" I did not think it had been so bad as this.\" He could have bitten his tongue out the next moment for that speech. It had escaped him unawares on the impulse"], [301, "289 ANOTHER MEETING. of the minute, according to the nature of tbe man, exactly as he had cried out on that autumn night, \" By George ! I wdl never rest tiU I have secured her for my wife.\" His was no unkindly, though neither was it a self-contained, delicately sensitive nature. He did all that a man miserably constrained and awkward, and at the same time with a young man's restiveness under an utterly new and strange experience of dismay and anguish, could do to efface the recollection of the words from the blighted, chill woman beside him during the rest of the interview, and in the company of their friends in the course of the evening and the following day. He discussed his plans with vehement fluency, he galloped furiously through the spirit-stirring accounts of the war, and still he was able to enter keenly into home news, never flagging in his questions, bitten with insatiable curiosity whether it referred to chronic riots in the manufacturing districts, to the rebuilding of Covent Garden Theatre, or to fresh walking feats on the part of the renowned Captain Barclay. He kept up the ball, and he permitted no dangerous pause either to himself or his neighbours, no moment for intolerable comparison and reflection. He was hoarse with feverish speaking; he was dead tired by unaccustomed mental effort. He had contrived to be even wildly gay,, yet he had not succeeded in deceiving, not to say himself, but Lady Catherine, or any living being deeply interested in the drama, after it was too late to refrain from playing it out. Above aU, it was much too late for the bride, who, not- withstanding the quick ageing of the tribulation of a few months, was still too timid and docile a young woman to stand forward singly, outraging all authority and precedent, and to break off the marriage with all its preparations com- pleted, ready to be solemnized within twenty-four hours. Lady Catherine could not tear up the marriage settlements, burn the special license, dismiss in dudgeon their Graces of Salop and the branches of the Luttrel famdy accommo- dated in the Salop coach, and scandahze Lady Stukely by Bending back to the wars from which he had been torn, to play his part and get his portion of this world's goods \u2014 however burdened \u2014 the innocent bridegroom who, in the circumstances of the case, would be exposed to the chief blame and mortification of the miserable fadure. 0"], [302, "290 RUE No, however Lord Robert might have been brought to welcome the release had he been fully enlightened and con vinced at an earlier stage of the proceedings, he would never consent to accept the alternative at this date. Like most hot-headed, simple-hearted, blustering men, he was vain and arrogant, and, though not rendered thin-skinned by excessive, and essential refinement, he was very much alive to the scorn and laughter of his fellows. He had written chivalrously in his first dim glimpse of Lady Catherine's misfortune, that he would not hesitate to call out every man who should suggest his giving her up. If she gave him up at the eleventh hour he would grind his teeth and prepare to fight, all round, the whole world whom he suspected of grinning and sneering at his discom fiture. No final breaking-off of the marriage could be thought of in those days, to those people \u2014 not with Lady Catherine cut to the quick with her pride \u2014 and the young, gracious, kindly girl had, without knowing it, been proud in her own way \u2014 laid in the very dust, and her moral nature frozen in its very vitals. The rupture was impossible, though the Duke of Salop was moved to elevate his chin, let fall his eyeglass, and murmur to his congenial first born, \" Heavens ! what a pill it is for a boy like poor Bob to swallow, though he has Oxham to gild it.\" Though Lady Stukely, in the retirement of her darkened room and great bed, Heat her hands together and cried weakly by way of comforting herself, too, out of the treasure-house of her experience, \" the lad was a fine lad, and he is staunch, at least he will not rob or beat my Kitty.\" CHAPTER HI. THE LAST MEETING. Complete change of scene and the climate of Portugal and Spain did not benefit Lady Catherine. The crushed and wounded woman was far from popular among the half Bohemian military set to which, while morbidly shrinking from strangers, she was introduced. Even the pity excited"], [303, "291 THE LAST MEETING. by the sad story written on her young face, together with the honour due to her rank, rapidly passed into the care- less contempt which coarse minds feel when they are con- strained to pity, and when, at the same time, the privileges which they would respect, remain unclaimed. Lord Robert, on the contrary, was exceedingly popular as a frank, high- spirited young man, who had kept his word at all hazards, aud the skeleton at whose feast was keenly appreciated. His gentlemanlike forbearance with his wife's peculiarities was loudly commended, while the avoidance of and repug- nance to Lady Catherine, which underlay the indulgence, was overlooked and escaped remark. Within a year, by mutual consent, and quite as much by her will as by Lord Robert's, Lady Catherine returned with Sally Judd to England. Lady Catherine was not without a call of duty summon- ing her home, for Lady Stukely was on her death-bed, the lingering, painless, pathetically peaceful death-bed, in all the centuries, of honest Christian old age which has long been reconciled to its adversaries. Lady Catherine waited dutifully and lovingly by the bed to which, day and night, summer and winter, came without the prospect of change to the aged woman, save the great change through death and the grave. Like all such watchers by such beds, Lady Catherine found the noise, the strife, and the very bitter- ness of life, stilled and sweetened in the half-solemn, half- sweet, wholly human, and famihar calmness. There came another of the turning-points in Lady Catherine's life \u2014 one of those turning-points silent in proportion to their importance, and which are, for the most part, better left in silence. After Lady Stukely's death Lady Catherine began to cultivate her privileges, duties and tastes, languidly and fitfully at first, always more steadily and successfully. These duties included returning to Society, to which her rank and fortune gave her an unforfeited passport, and exchanging civilities with the Salop family, for nothing had happened which could legally dissolve Lady Catherine's marriage, and she was still to be considered and coveted by Lord Robert's family as a rich, childless wde, who, if Oxham must eventually go back to a Fortescue, had yet enough in her power to render desdable the bridging"], [304, "292 RUE over the gulf of incompatibility between her and Lord Robert. Lady Catherine improved greatly in health and bright ened altogether \u2014 she was still under five-and-twenty \u2014 until she attained the neutral tint in reference to which she became regarded as a high-bred example in the right ordering of a great establishment, a judge and ally in the church services established to convert the heathenness of the land, and especially in the elementary schools which Hannah More was employed in setting a-going to inform the people's dense ignorance, in cottage aids, in simple literature and art, in flowers and needle-work. Lady Catherine took younger unmarried women under her chaperonage to county and town balls, to the play, to an auction, or an archery meeting \u2014 at the last she would distribute the prizes and be spoken of as pleasant looking in her ladyhood and her good nature, in spite of her plainness. She resided chiefly at her own country house of Oxham, which had never received its master. There Lady Catherine's rooms were not only stately but cheerful and animated with their pleasant home and country view, with her birds, her pug, her Angola cat, her plants, her books, and her worsted work. These rooms were as different as possible from Lady Catherine's cheerless, foreign apartments \u2014 empty of occupation, devoid of ornament \u2014 where she had lodged with her husband, and where he had paid her freezing, goading visits of ceremony. For outward interests, at Oxham Lady Catherine had her friendly neighbours in general, and her rector in par ticular ; her poultry, her pet little cows and ponies, as well as her pet village maids and lads, old men and women, all the innocent kindly ties of an innocent, kindly woman. Time wore on. Lady Catherine heard the public news from rumour and from the newspapers. Lord Robert was marching and picquetting under broiling suns and rainy moons, reconnoitring by hedges and in ditches, faring on chance fare, playing his part in bloody battles and des perate assaults, having the shine taken out of the man as well as out of his uniform. The peace of 1814 came, and the allies were in Paris, where Lord Robert tarried with other disengaged gentlemen."], [305, "THE LAST MEETING. 293 Another whirlwind broke over the world when the Hon was loose again, and the destiny of a quarter of the world to be settled once more. The battle of Waterloo followed, with the hurrying of frantic couriers east and west, north and south, to Russia, Italy, England and America, and with one little quaintly, coldly formal, yet familiar, school-boy note to Lady Catherine beginning \" Dear Lady Catherine,\" and ending \" Your obedient servant, Robert Luttrel \"\u2014 certifying that a great battle had been fought and won, that peace was about to be established at last, and that Lord Robert Luttrel, whose name Lady Catherine bore, was among the triumphant survivors. A throb of duty and dignity, perhaps born of discipline, despatched that letter ; a throb of duty and dignity acknowledged it fitly. Nay, more, when Lord Robert was safe back in England only to find that his agent, from having indulged freely in the land mania and other manias which collapsed with the peace, had spent the money which Lord Robert, not being a gambler who could gamble anywhere and at any odd moment, had been too continuously and busily engaged on active service to fail to spare, he was persuaded to apply through his agent and his wife's agent for help from Lady Catherine ! Why not ? He had not robbed \u2014 not to say beaten her \u2014 even to the extent that marriage might have permitted him to do. He had never wronged her wilfully. Destiny had been against them \u2014 a great mutual misfortune had separated them \u2014 he thought. And he only proposed to borrow from Lady Catherine a loan to which she would have been heartily welcome from him, had she required or sought it, at any time during all these years. Lady Catherine did not hesitate for a moment over this request. She wrote a generous letter ; she sent immediate and imperative orders to her agent to do what he could for Lord Robert in his embarrassments incurred while he was serving his country. Lord Robert's circumstances were righted, and more years \u2014 a decade, two decades \u2014 sHpped by rapidly, as the years gather momentum and speed, in multiplying, till they reach the appointed span of each man and woman. During the interval Lord Robert and Lady Catherine had not once met again even in public, for they were not hke a state couple who were compelled of necessity to parade their"], [306, "294 RUE misery and make a mock show of polite greetings in high places and thoroughfares. Both lived mostly in the country at their different seats, where there were several shires linked together to form a barrier between them. When the lady and the gentleman were in town, naturally they were in different sets. They heard of each other \u2014 shyly \u2014 and a little curiously. Lord Robert heard of Lady Catherine, as a good plain woman, who might have grown twaddling and bigoted in his eyes, but who could be trusted not to disgrace the shred of con- nection between them. Lady Catherine heard of Lord Robert, as roughened and louder (since even a Lord Robert may roughen and wax louder by campaigning), and as offering a rnder version of a lordly bearing \u2014 a man some- what given to violent exercise even of his lawful power, to excesses of temper in public and private. He was said to be addicted to the society of those who might be stigma- tized as boon companions in his man's fastness of Cheving- ton Friars, but still he was not by any means regarded as a man beyond the pale of society and of social esteem. Sometimes comically petty details floated to the husband and wife of their respective ways and doings. Lady Catherine would not consent to adopt a wig, but wore her own silvering hair under her turban or cap. Lord Robert had shown the fiercest grizzled mutton-chop whiskers at the nearest assizes and assize ball. Lady Catherine had founded a home for incurables, including the blind victims of small-pox. Lord Robert had knocked down a refractory postboy \u2014 to be sure the postboy had been brutal to his horses as well as insolent to his employer \u2014 and after teach- ing the man a lesson in humanity and civility, Lord Robert had promptly administered a solatium in current coin of the realm. Then there came a time when Lord Robert, visiting within the county in which Oxham was situated, and hardened by long immunity to the chance of a painful, accidental encounter, ventured to follow the hunt so near to his wife's gates, that when he was badly thrown, hers happened to be the nearest house within several miles. The members of the hunt who were on the spot, and who knew the gentleman and his story, consulted together and fidgeted a good deal before they arranged that he should be"], [307, "295 THE LAST MEETING. carried to Oxham. They did not apprehend the fall to be fatal, though ribs were broken, and unknown internal injuries loomed in the background, but delay aud such insufficient accommodation as any of the neighbouring farm-houses could afford, might well have the worst con sequences in the case of a heavy elderly man, whose con stitution had been tried by active foreign service. It was quite within men's memories how the late Duke of Dorset had met with his accident when hunting with Lord Powerscourt's harriers over in Ireland, and had risen without assistance, and run half a dozen yards across the furrows before he staggered and fed to rise no more. In the meantime Lord Robert had recovered his senses, and was fit to be told what was the most Hkely place for a gentleman hurt on the hunting-field to be taken to, and could enter his objections d his alienation from his wife were of such a nature that he could not seek shelter under her roof in circumstances when a man would not turn his enemy's dog from the door. Lord Robert made no objection. Perhaps his head was not clear yet, perhaps he was conscious of greater injuries than men guessed at, and judged that he might as well die at Oxham as elsewhere, if there were not a certain pro priety in its master drawing his last breath there, though he had never crossed the threshold before. Whatever the reason, after a moment's consideration, Lord Robert gave a gruff assent to the movement. Lady Catherine was from home for the day, gone to superintend her hospital for incurables, when the anxious group with Lord Robert borne on men's shoulders in their centre, arrived, but the servants were ready to do the honours of the house in Lady Catherine's absence, and to render every assistance. Sally Judd, a sagacious, responsible old woman, in her black silk gown and white silk shawl, came forward to help and relieve an old master and acquaintance. Lord Robert recognized Sally as she plied him with restoratives. \" Wed, how are you Sally ? How has the world gone with you ? \" he inquired faintly, not proving himself abashed or overcome by more than pain and giddiness."], [308, "296 RUE \" Middling well, my lord ; but I'm main sorry that you've met with this toss,\" answered Sally, discreetly. \" The old man,\" was her verdict when she turned away, \" I'll warrant his conscience feels none the guiltier nor the tenderer.\" Sally, like many people, confounded conscience with capacity of feeling, and then, as if aware of her injustice, she added emphatically, \"Which I never said Lord Robert was either a very bad man, or a very bad master, but he was found wanting when he had to deal with himself and my lady, after they were pulled up and brought to book for what had brought and what kep' 'em together ; and when they were like to go clean distraught with the beggary which the small-pox had left behind it for their portion. Lady Catherine has lived it down, and grown a well-to-do woman again \u2014 why should she not ? But the two are crossing each other's paths afresh when \u2014 as sure as I ever seed it in a man's eyes \u2014 there's death in his path, let them doctors say what they will. Ay, it must be no less than death that sends Lord Robert here at this hour of the day. What will my lady think ? daisy me knows the upshot ! \" finished Sally, appealing to a mysterious and yet familiar oracle. The doctors, soon summoned, saw cause to dread such irreparable evil that they did not dare to precipitate matters by removing Lord Robert from the couch in the morning-room \u2014 Lady Catherine's own room, to which he had been first taken in the confusion and consternation. There he dozed for the rest of the short autumn day, occasionally roused to take what medicines were tried by the assiduous watchers, occasionally ronsing himself with a start of fitful recollection to the scene and the circum stances. How different this room was from other rooms he recollected ! He was so fond of animals that the ruling passion strong in death made him have a perception of the presence of Lady Catherine's pets, and transported his half wandering imagination to her out-of-door favourites, which would have been his favourites too, or brothers and sisters to his favourites. He had entertained a boyish admiration for bright colours and pleasant outlines, though he had not known"], [309, "297 THE LAST MEETING. how, in amending the stiff, bare details of his single-man's house at Chevington Friars, to put in practice the taste which was now instinctively, and with an absence of the reasoning faculty, gratified. \" By George ! it's nice \u2014 I have not seen so nice a room for a long time,\" he muttered gently. In one of his waking moments Lord Robert's eyes fell on the handwriting of a letter lying on the little table close to his couch, and it roused him by a sense of familiarity with the spider-legged characters. Surely that was his sister Jane's handwriting ? How long was it since she had written to him ? Yet he and Jenny used to be good friends long ago. In his selfish bachelor and widower habits he had grown out of knowledge of the old place and the old people. Lady Catherine seemed to know more about them now than he knew. Thus lde and consciousness ebbed and flowed, and was sinking lower and lower, before Lady Catherine at last returned from her \" home,\" and was told of who had been brought to her door, and in what state he came. After a great effort, she entered the room where he lay, while the doctors and attendants drew off to the farthest window, whispered and shrugged their shoulders imperceptibly \u2014 the men of them because they could not allow themselves any other display of feeling as a pendant to that of the women, who shook their heads and wiped their eyes, men and women alike turning their backs on the couple's last meeting, which was to be so quickly succeeded by a last parting. A final flash of intelligence sprang into Lord Robert's eyes with Lady Catherine's presence, and enabled him to take it in, in its entireness, for a brief moment. Lady Catherine was still in the dimity gown and garden bonnet in which she had gone out on her accustomed morn ing avocations. Her face was simply what it would be in her coffin \u2014 a face deeply scarred and blemished by small pox, but the blurredness of the features, the blearedness of the eyes, and the scantiness of the hair, were gone with the recentness of the attack and with the weak health which had helped to occasion them. Age had softened the destruction worked by disease as it softens most destruc tions, and, like the grey Hchens and mosses which cling to"], [310, "298 RUE and surmount ruins, Lady Catherine's white hair served as powder to touch tenderly and even to crown lovingly the wreck of her beauty. Her expression had passed from the intuitive gladness, and then the boundless despair of the girl, to the peace and freedom of the old woman who has learnt self-forgetfulness and with it self-respect, patience, and sympathy. If Lord Robert had possessed the strength he could have rubbed his eyes at the contrast. He had but to shut them in order to recad the hopeless, forlorn girl in the neglected, ugly invalid dress who had been an intolerable offence to all his perceptions when she had been out with him in the Peninsula. Lady Catherine gazed down with brimming eyes and quivering lips on the prostrate figure of her once gallant bridegroom, on the helpless bulk, the swollen, discoloured face, the iron-grey hair damp and in disorder, and the breathing becoming always more laboured and stertorous. \" I am very, very sorry for your accident, Lord Robert,\" she said tremulously, touching him lightly in token of reconciliation, with an open, friendly, shaking old ivory hand. He answered her irrelevantly, and with a groan. \"Lady Catherine,\" he said, striving to keep steady the heavy eyes fixed upon her, \" if you had been spared as you were when I knew you first (by heavens ! you were the loveliest, sweetest creature), you would have been the happiest as well as the finest woman in England.\" He spoke in a high strained key, as if he sought to make her believe so much in their mutual justification. \" Ah ! never mind ; that is all past,\" she said, hastily. \" Past,\" he repeated in the same key ; \" and I am dead beat, but I wish that, knowing everything, I had it all to begin and do over again.\" '.' The first thing that you have to do over again, is to get well and be about once more.\" She tried to speak encouragingly while humouring his fancy. But Lord Robert had ceased to see or hear her. His beginning and doing all over again was not to be in this world !"], [311, "A LENT LILY. (RAE GIFFORD.) CHAPTER I. Linton was an old-fashioned white house, with an air of old-fashioned, narrow respectability. It was situated in a paddock kept trim but unornamented. The door of the house opened into a small hall barely sufficient to hold hat pins, an umbrella-stand, and a clock-case, and to let a man or a woman pass without an accident. The windows of the rooms were small ; the rooms themselves were low roofed and dark ; and the furniture was black in colour and out of date in shape. The Giffords of Linton were not above caring for these things. They were proud of them \u2014 proud of Linton having been two hundred years in the family \u2014 prouder than the next squire was of his acres six times the bounds of Linton. But he went into the world and measured himself by bigger squires, earls, and dukes, and knew, after all, that he was nobody except at the Grange, or in the town of Clouds. The Giffords never subjected them selves to such an experience ; they had lived, generation after generation of the heads of the house, at home, farming their three grassy farms, and so had grown more and more satisfied of their own dignity and unaccount ability. The present Gifford of Linton, who had been a younger son, had given up, on his inheiiting the property, his"], [312, "300 A LENT LILT. practice as a country lawyer of good standing, that he might enjoy to the full the independence and leisure tra ditional in the heads of the house. He had married the druggist's daughter at Clouds, to show that he did not need to look out for rank or wealth in a wife, and that he did not care for being cut by the community ; in fact, he pre ferred it, sure as he was of retaining the countenance of his one equal \u2014 his sister, Miss Gifford of Linton. Miss Gifford forgave her brother's low marriage, and tolerated Mrs. Gifford, because a Gifford of Linton could not do wrong ; and she continued to stay at Linton because nobody could arrange its household and order its domestic economy perfectly, as it had always been ordered, save a born Gifford or somebody very near a Gifford. As for the opinion of the world, Eunice Gifford did not mind it much more than her brother did. Mrs. and Miss Gifford, the sisters-in-law, were sitting at work together among the grim imitation-ebony chairs, and before the crazy work-table of the drawing-room at Linton. It was not five o'clock in the afternoon, but the table was set for tea \u2014 not the women's five o'clock tea, in the antici pation of the six or seven o'clock dinner of the present generation \u2014 but the family tea of the past. The Giffords had not yet given in their adherence to late hours. The cows allowed to feed in the paddock (the garden was pro tected by the formality of a high wall, glass a-top, with a stout door having a big rusty key in the lock), on coming home to their supper or their bed, might cross the sweep and look in at the window on the meal, as cows had done in Miss Gifford's grandmother's time. The two women were both young \u2014 about one age \u2014 three or four-and-twenty, and were ten or twelve years Chris topher Gifford's juniors. They were dressed alike \u2014 in grey silk gowns, with little collars and cuffs ; they were working at the same piece of work \u2014 two cotton squares for one crotchet-quilt ; but nothing could make them like sisters. All that was reached was the look of two entirely different soldiers in one uniform. Eunice was the elder. She was a handsome woman, with the clear-cut face of the Giffords. She did not look older than she was, or careworn or unhappy, or even pettish ; she looked fully aHve, energetic, and cheerful."], [313, "RAE GIFFORD. 301 But the colour of her dress did not become her, for she wanted complexion \u2014 having an ivory whiteness of skin, extending even to her lips, accompanied by light-brown hair of that dead light-brown in which there is neither oil nor wine. She failed in every gleam of warmth and ray of sunshine. Still, she was a handsome woman, with nothing girlish about her, but much that was womanly. Sitting there, with an easy carriage and a Hght rapid finger, an observer might read that she was not an dliterate woman ; that she was clear-headed and firm- willed ; that she kept the best accounts and trained the best servants in her own proud, old-fashioned way in the country ; and that there was possibly some branch of science or art in which she was an unpretending skilful proficient. Mrs. Gifford (Rae, or Rachael Corbet, that had been) was another order of woman ; she was low in stature, and exaggerated the defect by stooping, or rather slouching over her work : had she raised herself it would have been seen that her neck, shoulders, and bust were fine. She was low-browed, with an olive complexion that clears to a glowing brown or gets thick aud sodden, according to health of body and mind. The features of the face, in their present outline, were good but heavy, with a relaxed looseness in the lines ; the Hps, particularly, hung half apart, and exposed the naturally small teeth. The hair should have redeemed other\" disadvantages. At first sight, or on a casual glance, it was black. In reality it was auburn, dark to blackness ; but it was ill arranged, in a poor copy of Eunice Gifford's braids, and not very smooth on the rippled-over surface. The eyes had the same deceptive darkness from the hue of the lashes ; they were blue-grey eyes \u2014 the only clear thing about her, \u2014 somewhat cold for the dash of red in the hair \u2014 shrinking, introverted eyes, which kept back something, and held a story frozen in their depths. These eyes of Rae Gifford's were not often seen, they were bent on her work as at present ; at church, the only place where she appeared in public, she never lifted them from her prayer-book. Nobody could say that she displayed elation at her rise in society, or challenged observation on her fine clothes. When she walked about the paddock, or took country rambles with her husband and Eunice, she was wont to"], [314, "302 A LENT LILT. fall a step behind, and go on looking at the ground, not joining in the conversation unless she was directly addressed, and not caring to lift up her eyes to the elms and beeches fringing the paddock-hedge on the side of the high-road, or to the fields and wooded hangers of the general landscape. She had some awkward attitudes aud movements out of which Eunice could not break her, finding more difficulty there than in the set lessons which she did not scruple to bestow, and which Mrs. Gifford did not refuse to accept. She would sit, her feet drawn below her chair, slouching over her work as described, creep behind people when they walked, and muffle her hands in her apron, her handkerchief, or her shawl. \" Rae, what are you doing with that square ? \" cried Eunice, suddenly ; \" don't you see that the sides are not even ? It is out of shape ; it wdl never fit.\" \"I did not notice : shall I pull it down ? \" asked Mrs. Gifford, raising those frozen eyes helplessly. She spoke correctly, but with a heavy provincial articulation, as if she had difficulty in moving her tongue, and were too listless in her nature to get rid of the slow drawl. \" Of course ; you don't grudge the additional work, Rae; it would make an ugly blunder in the quilt,\" exclaimed Eunice, condescendingly. \" Oh, no ; I had as lief pull down as put up,\" answered Mrs. Gifford, stolidly, beginning to tug at the cotton. \"Not 'as lief,' as soon : the one is as easily said as the other. And take care, Rae, or you will have the whole square down : you know you can stop at the row which is amiss.\" Eunice did her teaching gently, as a wise woman guides her child ; and, taking the work from her sister-in-law's hand, put it right for her. When it was returned, Mrs. Gifford said, \" Thank you,\" let it hang dangling from her fingers for a minute, and then began again to pick, pick at the loops, as if she had been set on a treadmill for crotchet ing cotton, and, after a pause, authorised by her gaoler, had gone on again. Eunice had the full privilege of'looking at her brother's wife as she sat at work, for she never by any chance caught Mrs. Gifford's eye ; it never wandered : it had nothing to wander for. As for Eunice, she could work"], [315, "RAE GIFFORD. 303 without staring by the hour at her work, and she had quick, sharp eyes, which took in everything, did not appre ciate catholically, but what they appreciated, appreciated thoroughly. \" She is little short of an idiot in practical matters, though she can learn theories well enough,\" meditated Eunice. \" What would poor Christopher have done with out me ? What would become of the child, if it be spared ? I wonder what he saw in her, a common, igno rant girl, very rustic, d not altogether vulgar \u2014 not even a beauty ? a blurred face and slovenly figure, which repulse me. The lad Penn, her father's apprentice, gave her up, after keeping company with her, when he went away and got on in the world. Yet they called her ' taking,' at Clouds : in the town's phrase \u2014 ' a wonderful taking girl was Joe Corbet's daughter : took strangers, took Penn, who was a young genius, took Mr. Gifford of Linton.' Ah ! that was the great take, and the Giffords have been accustomed to please themselves. I suppose she has fallen off ; but it is a mercy that I am here to care for the com fort and respectability of the family. And I mean never to marry \u2014 never to leave Linton.\" Eunice broke off the thread of her reflections at this interesting and important point, on the entrance of her brother, and the punctual appearance of the urn for tea. Christopher Gifford was a gaunt man, with marked features, fine teeth standing apart, and a brushed-up top of light hair, where grey could not be seen. He wore clothes made from the wool of his own sheep, spun, woven, cut and stitched at Clouds ; and, in consequence, rather coarse in their texture, dingy in their mixture of purple and brown, and clumsy in their form. But he was not un gentlemanlike. There was a little air of noblesse oblige and cultivation about him ; and he loved study in itself, though he loved his own attainments better. \" Rae,\" Eunice reminded the mistress of the house, \"we are waiting for you.\" And Rae shuffled to the tray. The meal, though primitive and a Httle formal, was yet snug and attractive, with its bright copper urn on a genuine tripod, its rose-leaf china, its country home-made bread and butter, its dish of savoury trout from the Clouds trout-stream. But there was something unsuitable and"], [316, "304 A LENT LILT. inimical to the harmony of the scene in the uncouth, absent-minded figure at the head of the table. Eunice would not on any account have sat there ; but she sat next Mrs. Gifford, and helped her, and overlooked her perform ance, with a running fire of \u2014 \" a little more sugar to Mr. Gifford, Rae ; no, not so much cream ; allow me to pour out the water,\" all the time Eunice was drinking her own tea. Mr. Gifford had good spirits and was talkative. His own family, with one member to sympathize with and reply to him, was quite enough of an audience for him. \" I have been looking over the right-hand book-case, Eunice,\" he remarked, as a subject of lively concern. \" I think the books had better be shifted. I have all the Roman men there ; they are valuable editions ; I should not like them to suffer, and it is damp at that window. Indeed, I began to do a little ; but I opened Virgil where my old friend was leaving Carthage, and here I have just quitted his ship's company.\" \" I am aware Virgil is a favourite of yours, Christopher, since you used to translate him for me. You have not done it this long while.\" \"Wait till the winter nights come,\" answered Mr. Gifford, much gratified : flattered both in his love of con sequence and his love of study. His library was one of his hobbies. He regarded it as beyond improvement, and despised those who would pretend to literature by modern byways and back-doors, without the trouble of Latin grammar and Greek lexicon, or the cost of calf-skin. \" I hope we shall not send you to sleep, Rae ? \" he added. \" Have another trout ? No ? Try the brown bread ? \" \" No, thank you ; and I never sleep on a chair.\" \" That is scarcely complimentary,\" retorted her husband, dryly ; but only a little dryly. \" You remember something about \u00c6neas. Come, tell us, Rae.\" Awaiting the inform ation. \"He founded a city,\" said Rae, briefly. \" So he did. So the Romans say he did,\" acknowledged Mr. Gifford, with a nod of modified commendation; \"but not Carthage, of course, not Carthage. Anything more ?\" \" He was blind.\" \" But not when he wooed queen Dido.\""], [317, "305 RAE GIFFORD. \" That would be a shocking anachronism,\" said Eunice, with a laugh. And then a pause ensued. \" I found the silene quinquevulnera to-day, Christopher,\" announced his sister, shortly afterwards. \" Ah ! did you ? \" he exclaimed, with interest, putting down his cup ; \" a sufficient specimen ? \" \" Yes, I think so ; and I am inclined to maintain, in spite of the authorities, that it is a distinct genus. Not only are the petals marked, but the styles differ. I bade Rae notice it, as it was a good study for her, and she thinks her father used to gather it.\" \" Indeed, I wish you could be particular, Rae,\" he said. \" Precision in details is absolutely necessary in botany, and in everything else, d you would have a well-ordered mind,\" he counselled her. \" I cannot be sure. I forget the most of the plants ; but it struck me father picked the Hke when we went to the pond near the upper Grange gate to get sun-dews,\" she stated supinely. And Christopher Gifford turned from his wife to discuss floral localities with his sister. Unless, in its supreme patronage, there was no fault to be found with Christopher Gifford's treatment of his wife. He had been disappointed in her ; not that he over estimated the social sacrifices which he had made for her, or that they began to gall him. But after being \"taken \" with Rachael Corbet, according to the saying of which Eunice had been thinking, he had reckoned on moulding Rachel to his tastes and habits. He had talked in a high-flown way to Eunice, who had not agreed with him, but who had not failed him, of employ ing the retirement which he loved in the fascinating task of educating his wde up to his standard of feminine learning and accomplishments. He had desired her to be a cultivated man's companion, and on a level with Eunice. He had meant to work on the foundation of reading, writing, doing a few accounts, and sewing, which had served for the druggist's girl. But although Eunice aided and abetted him ; although, as Eunice had admitted, there was no incapacity for theory, and the intellectual instrument was there complete in all its parts, either some secret, vital spring was want ing, or Christopher Gifford's was not the hand which could x"], [318, "306 A LENT LILT. play on it and draw from it choice melody. Rae Gifford was a submissive wife : she never asked for company, or objected to her entire withdrawal from her former associ ates (her father and his remaining family had emigrated shortly after her marriage), or rebelled against any of the time-honoured institutions of Linton, including the in fluence and authority of Miss Gifford ; but she was a spiritless creature, whom her very servants ceased to envy. Christopher Gifford did not take his mistake too deeply to heart. He was accountable to nobody, and in the seclusion of his life few witnessed his failure. Besides, he was too much of a man and a gentleman to visit any chagrin which he felt by harshness and unkindness to Rae; and the hope of an heir filled him with pride and gentle ness. CHAPTER II. Christopher Gifford had returned to his library, and Eunice was in her own room, when she heard the postman's ring, without its being followed by any business letters to her or to Christopher, whose sanctum was next door to hers. Servants were always getting letters now ; she wished they were always profitable letters, Eunice said to herself, and continued an inventory that she was engaged in, until the blue of the afternoon sky had deepened to its evening purple, and the last cow had left the paddock for the yard. Then she went, with her light, swdt, assured step, downstairs, and entered the drawing-room ; but stopped after the first step across the threshold. Mrs. Gifford was there, seated in the window-seat, catching the last beams of the failing light, with an open letter on her knee. It was not the letter which struck Eunice \u2014 for her sister-in-law, at intervals few and far between, got letters from Australia. It was something that she could not on the instant fix upon, strange in the aspect of the orderly room. The next moment she saw that a chair and foot-stool were pushed out of their places, and that the piece of the quilt Rae bad been poring over was thrown down on the floor, with the cotton warped"], [319, "RAE GIFFORD. 307 backwards and forwards, as if somebody had passed blindly across the room, dragging it from chair to chair. \" Rae, you have dropped your work, and let the cotton get into a tangle : you should, take better care of it. The square will not look nice when it is so often pulled down, or when the thread is broken and joined ; and it is far from nice to work it, when it is soiled.\" Eunice advanced, after stopping to pick up the work, then she stood still again and spoke abruptly, \" Rae, what is it ? What have you heard ? What has happened ? \" Eunice, in her ignorance of Rae's antecedents, was utterly at a loss to account for the alteration in her sister in-law. There was a great alteration. Rae sat up, grasp ing the letter in her hands ; her face was a ruddy brown ; her eyes \u2014 those cold, blue-grey eyes \u2014 were bright and glistening, and were looking straight into Eunice's face, piercing it with their intelligence. \" Mat Penn has written, Miss Gifford,\" gasped Rae, going back with a jerk of the body, and a fevered step to the old table. \" He never thought to give me up. He did not pass the first examination, and he could not bear to write that he had lost. He waited till he had gained. He was always a proud lad.\" Eunice remained standing, and looking down on her brother's wife without a shade of a blush reflected on the ivory whiteness of her cheek. Her mouth, always straight and thin-lipped, closed hard, and narrowed to a faint red line. \" Why do you teU me this, Rae ? What do I know of Matthew Penn, except that he served me once or twice in your father's shop ? He may have written to you not knowing the event that has taken place.\" Eunice turned to the back of the letter without opposition. Sure enough it was addressed, \" Rachel Corbet, Joseph Corbet, Druggist, Clouds.\" \" But what is it to you?\" Eunice spoke in a tone of low, cold, wondering remonstrance. She touched Rae on the arm ; and the very touch, though light, fell on the fevered, thrilling flesh, chill, unimpressionable, and unyielding as iron. \u2022 Rae's fully opened eyes waxed wider, and at the same time a film descended over them, and a moaning quiver ran through her body."], [320, "308 A LENT LILT. \" I had forgotten. I had a mind that I could have just risen and gone to him,\" she said, in a high-strained key. \" I thought it were all as one when I wedded, whether I obeyed father and mother, and took Mr. Gifford at his word, or went away across the sea beyond the reach of Mat's repentance; but, oh ! I see it is an awful difference.\" \" I am shocked,\" Eunice interposed sternly. \" But say no more, and I will not mention your foolish words to my brother. I could not repeat them to him, and yet you could say them to me ! You must compose yoursed, Rae\" \u2014 as Mrs. Gifford began to rock herself with a feeble, crushed, wailing sound \u2014 \" or else I cannot conceal this exposure. You will hurt yourself. Think of your state, think of your child.\" Rae cried out at that word a short sharp cry, as if Eunice had stabbed her, and fell back, trembling in every limb, with a horrified, scared expression, blotting out the pain in her face, and replacing it by other and deeper suffering. Eunice was not easily frightened, but she was frightened now, too frightened to rebuke and protest any more. After a whde, when Mrs. Gifford remained still, except for a feeble effort to draw up the apron, which she was in the habit of muffling her hands in, to cover her face, Eunice asked whether she would not go to her room. Taking silence as consent, Eunice put her arm round Rae \u2014 a dead weight on Eunice's hands \u2014 and assisted her to rise and proceed to the dark, frigid room, with the heavy stuff bed. Eunice helped her to bed, and sat beside her there till she saw the eyes \u2014 dull with more than tked old despair \u2014 the secret they had held petrified at their source \u2014 close like lead, and not till then quitted her. \"Poor, impulsive, outrageous woman,\" Eunice said to herself, as she shut the door softly. \" I did not know she had so much in her. I never guessed that anything ailed her. Her class generally have but one idea, and they are wretchedly wanting in self-control. She must be guarded' now for all our sakes ; though, to give Rae her due, I believe that any inclination to evil .lies in her weakness. I have no reason to suppose that she did not intend to do her duty. That druggist lad \u2014 I hope Christopher will never know, it is too humiliating,\" muttered Eunice, red-"], [321, "309 RAE GIFFORD. dening for the first time, as if humiliation were the chief pang, and the Giffords of Linton the sole sufferers. \" 1 think she may not betray herself again ; although she has no self-command, she has little self-assertion. Of course, I shall not allude to what has passed to keep it before her mind ; I will banish it from my own mind as far as possible. I have heard Matthew Penn was seeking for a Government appointment. His name and his destination will be in the list. He does not seem to keep up much communication with Clouds ; but I wdl take care that he shall have one of the file of newspapers which Christopher procured and laid aside on the occasion of the last marriage at Linton.\" The next day, to Eunice's relief, Mrs. Gifford wandered into the drawing-room as usual, and began anew \u2014 with her half-closed eyes, and her half-apart lips, and a little shiver now and then, as if she felt colder than formerly \u2014 like another Sisyphus, to roll her stones of rows, up her mountain of white crochet cotton-work. CHAPTER III. Linton was always a staid, dud place ; but early this October morning there was a stillness about it that was not of life. Death had crossed the threshold with the first nip of frost which turned the green of some of the trees hectic red, and had fixed his bony clutch where it is most felt, on the head of the house : he who has the right and the wdl to rule, defend, and keep together the rest. Christopher Gifford had rusted in his cherished leisure, aged before his time, and died in his place by a stroke, as such men are apt to die, leaving some to mourn, but few to miss him. The house was lying in the chill, decent repose of a house of death ; the very cows were not turned out in the paddock to browse on the autumn mints, but leaned their broad necks over the hedge, and lowed at the passers-by. The death had taken place the previous night, and as yet no preparations for the funeral broke the arrest of every day work and animation."], [322, "310 A LENT LILT. One person besides the servants was stirring. The new made widow, worn with fatigue and awed by the blow which had fallen, was standing at one of the curtained windows with her three-years' old child in her arms. The window was open by that quarter of an inch which country housemaids consider sufficient for the airing of a room. Every now and then the sharp, fresh wind stirred the long, blank blind \u2014 blank like the eyes of the dead man lying upstairs \u2014 and let in a glimpse of the paddock, with the grass whitening, the elms and lime yellowing, the leaves dropping disconsolately, the very thistles and burdock ragged and brown as they are in October. But the whole was covered with the dense pearl setting of a thick October dew, glistening as the sun rose higher in the grey-veiled blue sky, aud was reflected with a ruddy reflection as of fire from the reddest of the fallen leaves. A longing arose in the widow's heart \u2014 impulsive as Eunice had called it, but with all its impulses, long ice bound \u2014 to go out with her child and breathe the cold, keen air, and traverse the wasted, frost-touched October pad dock. Rae got her ordinary bonnet and her little girl's prim hood, and walked abroad \u2014 with small remark from the servants, who had come to regard her as an \" out-of-the way kind of body,\" rather beneath their notice \u2014 into the watery sunshine, and along by the hedge where webs of spun film were hanging from the dank, crimson-tipped leaves, and a robin was singing its solitary song. Rae had no thought of irreverence to the dead. She was an unconventional being, to whom manners could not easily be taught. And both she and the child wanted air and light, space and freedom, after close confinement; for Rae had watched during the last fortnight with little inter mission, at Eunice's side, by her husband's pillow. She was mourning, too, in a stunned, self-reproachful, simple way for her husband, from whom she had never known anything but friendly dictation, and who had cherished much affection for their child. But as Rae paced along in the sober decline of the year, and listened to the robin when all the birds were gone, there came pressing upon her a longing for space and freedom. It would be something, in the dearth of all other hopes, to go and come without telling, to speak without being called"], [323, "311 RAE GIFFORD. back, to do with Delia as she would. Rae loitered and clasped her hands aghast at the daring of the thought, as little Delia crowed in her arms, clutched at the dripping boughs, and stammered out, \" Nice walk ; wo-a-wo ; gee up, mother,\" treating her mother as her beast of burden, for Rae perceived not that moment that her freedom was within her grasp. \" Miss Gifford has sent me for you and the child,\" said a servant, advancing, and recalling Mrs. Gifford to the house. Rae returned immediately, and met Eunice at the draw ing-room door. She was the same neat, exemplary Eunice throughout all her attention at a sick-bed, ending in the baffling mystery of death, with only her eyelids red for the brother, whom she had clung to, her sole kindred, save the child in Rae's arms. \" You must stay within doors, Rae, for the present,\" said Eunice, with the tone of mdd decision which she had always used to her sister-in-law. \" If baby frets, Barbara or Hannah can carry her out.\" Rae obeyed as implicitly as in the days when she was a wife, and she had even a more frightened look in her face now ; while Eunice summoned up composure to meet her late brother's lawyer, and to give thought to her own and the widow's mourning. The Giffords of Linton had always mourned in deep and long-continued crape, and Eunice contemplated the very child Delia, in a black mantle and black hat, rosette and shoulder-knots, till she was well through her childhood. Rae did not offer an opinion or raise an objection, but those around her, and her sister-in-law among them, who glanced once or twice at her, saw her afterwards sitting stitching at her widow's weeds as she had climbed the mountain of white crochet cotton, only with a pale doubt ful light in her resigned face. Mr. Gifford's will was to the general mind a reasonable will. He left Linton, burdened with an inconsiderable annuity to his widow in life-rent, to his sister, to pass on her death to his only child. Miss Gifford was a very superior woman, getting mature in years and able for the business intrusted to her. Mrs. Gifford was nobody and nothing."], [324, "312 A LENT LILT. The public had become apprised of Mr. Gifford's failure, quiet as he had kept it. The wonderfully taking girl, who had been deemed bright and original as she played about the streets of Clouds, and as she walked in the twilight hours with Matt Penn, the genius who was raising himself and was going to raise her, had proved in the sudden lift in life which had appeared to realize the anticipation in another way, a poor-spirited, inapt, incapable woman. If she was not a beacon to warn vain, ignorant girls against worldly ambition, she was nothing. Without Miss Gifford, Mrs. Gifford and Delia would have been certain to become the prey of designing persons. Mr. Gifford had done well by his household to leave it under the care of his sister. Miss Gifford accepted the trust willingly ; she had no positive dislike to her sister-in-law, if at first there had been some natural repugnance never broadly displayed, existing in the two towards each other. She was fond of Delia, and had already taken a great deal of trouble with the child, though her sex \u2014 which kept in view the end of the male line of the Giffords of Linton, who had not done anything except serve themselves in a small way all these years \u2014 had been a mortification to Eunice, only second to what it had been to Christopher. It was a greater mortification to the unworldly pair than Christo pher's stooping in his marriage had been to his sister. Eunice would do her duty and preserve the prosperity and credit of the little property of Linton intact, and would train up Delia in the way that she should go, to manage her kingdom after her. It never entered Eunice's head, nor the head of anybody connected with the business, that the account would not be required of her; that her pupils would slip out of their bonds, steal a march on her, and leave her with her king dom. Eunice could hardly believe it, when a week after the funeral, without apprising anybody of her intention, Mrs. Gifford left on another misty morning, before even the farm people were about, walking and carrying Delia, after having placed a letter on the hall table for Miss Gifford. The letter, in the handwriting which Eunice had taught the penwoman, and which she could never get her to reform altogether from the slim, slanting, runaway letters, to a formed legible hand, said \u2014"], [325, "RAE GIFFORD. 313 \" I know you will be angry with me, Miss Gifford ; but I cannot help it. I thank you for all you have done for me, and more you have intended to do, as I would thank Mr. Gifford if he were here still. I have taken nothing belonging to you and Mr. Gifford but Delia. I know she is not all mine, I know you have a share in her, and you have been very good to her ; but I must have my child to myself, though it is not quite fair. Think of a mother's heart and forgive me. At the same time, I shall not do anything to disgrace Delia; I will try to grow a fitter mother for her ; I will, indeed. Linton is all yours. Taking away Delia, I mean to give it up for her, and to make her my child entirely. I had never anything to do with a place like Linton. I was brought up to work for myself, I am quite able to work for my child. I wish you to know that it was nothing in Mr. Gifford's will which made me act as I am doing. He did quite right, only he could not know ; and I should have done it anyhow as soon as my marriage vow was loosed. , You know that I cannot express myself as you would, but you will under stand that I beg your pardon and pray to God to bless you, Eunice Gifford. Rachael Gifford.\" Eunice was slow to believe her own eyes ; she had never suspected that Rae was discontented, never thought her unhappy. Amazement was Eunice's first sentiment. Yet it was like Rae \u2014 that singularly unpractical woman, who had only been well off because she had been in good hands \u2014 the whole eccentric proceeding was like Rae, and so was the absurd supposition that she could renounce the future inheritance of Linton for Christopher Gifford's daughter. Eunice did not much mind the ingratitude towards herself, neither had she for some time any great fear of the conse quences of the foolish act. Running away \u2014 successful running away, at least \u2014 was as out of date as feudal hatred, in the modern world of expediency and universal intercourse. Eunice was an eminently matter-of-fact, self-satisfied woman ; she was fully persuaded that Rae would not only soon be found, but that she would also soon repent of her rash departure."], [326, "314 A LENT LILT. All the same, Eunice was ashamed of her sister-in-law's childish outbreak. She made up her mind that the best thing which could be done was to say no more than that Mrs. Gifford had gone away with the child for a change. Rae's behaviour admitted of this favourable construction. She had gone away in the morning, instead of at night ; she had dressed herself and her child in their morning walking dresses, packed up their luggage, and got a farm boy to carry it openly to the nearest railway station. For aught that the servants knew, Eunice might be acquainted with their destination. She would wait and ascertain it quietly, without exposing to the world \u2014 the fact notorious to Eunice herself \u2014 that Rae in practical matters was little better than an idiot. There was only one objection to this line of conduct : and Miss Gifford's man of business, whom she was forced to take into her confidence, did not fail to point it out to her. In case of any difficulty in tracing Mrs. Gifford, that difficulty would be multiplied indefinitely by the present inactivity and delay. \" Nonsense,\" scouted Eunice ; \" Mrs. Gifford and the child cannot disappear. They will soon turn up again.\" And she remained firm in her opinion. It was with consternation, instead of satisfaction, that Eunice \u2014 growing gradually alarmed at, the continued absence of any tidings of Rae and Delia \u2014 learned that, after the direct resort to the railway station and a journey of twenty miles beyond Clouds, all trace of the couple vanished. It could not, after such a lapse of time, be recovered, even with the utmost pains. Eunice had to suffer the nine days' scandal, and \u2014 what was a great deal worse to the independent, self-sustained woman with her family loyalty \u2014 to admit, as months passed, that she had lost sight of her brother's child and representative, little Delia. She had to reflect, with a pang which had long mingled gall and wormwood with her own diet, that while she dwelt in the peace and respectability of Linton, these poor creatures might be faring badly in their weakness."], [327, "315 RAE GIFFORD. CHAPTER IV. \" Dr. Penn, Miss Gifford ; Miss Gifford, Dr. Penn.\" The man and the woman introduced, on one of the rare occasions when Eunice went into company, looked at each other with interest. There was cause of controversy between them, and there was ground for sympathy. Eunice Gifford had some fellow-feeling with this man. He had been too proud to fear his past, after eight years' work as a professional man ; after some share in Eastern wars, rebellions, and lootings, and one piece of service which had made his fortune ; with an honourable reputation, even in his own country, as a man wise, benevolent, and trustworthy, he had returned to Clouds. Eunice admired Dr. Penn's knowledge, so much more simply held than Christopher's had been ; his manly power and a certain breadth in his conclusions. She was enough of a woman to be pleased with his person, that had out grown the traits of the plain, precocious lad, who had ground not only at a pestle and mortar, but at hard words, classes, and genera, except during the charmed moments that he had lingered with Rachael Corbet. He was a man now, with the seal of nature's nobility stamped on his irregular features ; and few Adonises have the same dis tinction. Eunice wondered how such a one, even as a druggist's lad, could have had an infatuation for Rae Gifford. Dr. Penn, on his part, could not help valuing Eunice Gifford's clear head, her application and perseverance, the species of single-heartedness and gallantry which had made and kept her a student of solid old books, a naturalist who knew bugle from ground ivy and a tomtit from a wren, all alone in her tastes since her brother died, among the fussy, pretentious, and milk-and-water ladies about Clouds. Eunice, too, was of a type which improves with a certain number of years. She had passed the time when one expects glow and brightness. Her well-defined features were rather mellowed than become shrewish. She was a"], [328, "316 A LENT LILT. handsome woman of a certain age, bearing the traces of a sensible, equable, occupied, and healthy temperament. Perhaps Dr. Penn, in his superiority, held also the Clouds' traditional respect for Miss Gifford. Eunice asked Dr. Penn what he had thought of Indian life ; what he had thought of Clouds on his return. Dr. Penn, in answer, gave a short page of his individual experience, and a longer welcome tribute to Clouds, which led to a reference to common pursuits ; and after half-an hour's conversation, Dr. Penn and Miss Gifford parted more than civilly, almost cordially. A week later Dr. Penn met Miss Gifford on one of the quiet field roads, showed her the yellow fumitory, and a relative of the purple emperor \u2014 rare in these parts, and offered to send or bring their fellows, and the last books which treated of the like, to Linton. Within a few months Dr. Penn visited freely at Linton as an intimate friend, and the country neighbours settled that Eunice Gifford would at last change her state, and pronounced the match a fair one. Certainly, in Eunice's acquaintance with the clever, enlightened, unassuming Doctor, there had come new life and animation to Linton. Linton had a fascination to Dr. Penn, which might have been a repulsion to another man. The man liked the bitter sweet of recollection. He liked to sit there, and ponder on all that he knew of the sad story of Rae Gifford : how she had been defeated by his silence, made a hasty marriage, disagreed with her sister-in-law, and gone away, nobody knew whither \u2014 out of sight and forgotten by the world more than half a dozen years ago. He could fancy the Hghts in which these two women \u2014 between whose cha racters his own formed a link, and whose natures he could gauge without animosity, forgiving as he wanted forgive ness \u2014 had served as fire and water to each other. Dr. Penn was sitting in his study at Clouds ; and so courageous or careless was he in facing his antecedents, that he had bought the very shabby, tumble-down house which he had inhabited with the rest of the family, as an apprentice to Joe Corbet the druggist. He had thrown out additions and improvements ; laid out a garden ; and settled himself with his man, who had been an orderly ; his horse, which had seen other fire than volunteers' ; and"], [329, "RAE GIFFORD. 317 his housekeeper, who was a Clouds woman. He was not there to poach on the established doctor's practice, but to help him when he needed help, to mature his talents in the the high-hearted hope of making some attainment which should have the faintest glimmer of the splendour of the attainments of Harvey and Jenner. The room which Dr. Penn had fitted up for his books, specimens, and experiments, was a very learned-looking room to the unitiated ; and it was handsome for Clouds \u2014 with its oak-root chairs, in irksome rows, and its table, bleak and bare, for the convenience of bearing his solitary meals. But in this spring season, when even townspeople thought of primroses and bluebells, and began to have wild anticipations of hay-making and roses, the Doctor's study remained dry, anatomical, and \u2014 for the doctor photo graphed \u2014 horribly pungent. The drawing-room at Linton, with its old, stained ebony, and Eunice for the sole occupant, was social and home-like in comparison. Dr. Penn was conscious of this, so much so that he indulged in fallacious memories of Joe Corbet's threadbare, noisy parlour, and the corner where a girl's frippery of snips of common riband, and sprigs of common flowers, had possessed something ady, delicate, and tender, to the ugly, manful, enterprising, and slaving apprentice. The glamour was still before his eyes when he thought of it. The doctor was reading in the early forenoon. He was a black-haired, pale-faced man, with a mouth slightly working still under moustache and beard, as passionate mouths wid work to the end, and with eyes having some thing wistful in their lustre, a glance which propitiates in clever, successful men, saying, as it does, \" I have not found everything in my great luck. I have missed something, which you, my common-place, obscure, even stranded friend, may have found and may set lightly by.\" A ring came to the door bell, and the Doctor's servant interrupted him with the vague communication, \" A person wants to see you, sir.\" \"What sort of a person ? \" inquired Dr. Penn, mindful of a brother practitioner's rights. \"A better sort of a person, sir; a woman; and she has a little gdl with her ; and she said, ' Is Dr. Penn at home ? Can I see Dr. Penn ? * \""], [330, "318 A LENT LILT. \" There is no mistake \u2014 there, show her in.\" The Doctor had only to wait a moment, when \u2014 under the full light of the April sun, casting golden motes on her black dress, striking the hair under her bonnet and bring ing out its auburn woof \u2014 Rae Gifford walked into her old home, Matthew Penn's house, leading her daughter Delia. \" Rae ! Mrs. Gifford ! \" stammered the Doctor, starting up and bowing his visitor to a seat. He was much excited, and his heart was beating tumultuously. Rae, whom he had known as a girl, touched by a straw and transparent as crystal, was composed and self-controlled in comparison. \" 1 have come to you, sir, to ask your help for my little girl. I was sure you would help her if you could.\" Then Dr. Penn recognized the old Rae, in the unbounded faith in his abilities, and the unqualified devotion to the object of her affection, which could bring her back to Clouds and Linton, to him and Eunice ; which could cure her stubbornness, and cause her to destroy by her own doing, the one independent plot and act of her life, in order to rescue Delia from real or imaginary evil. He looked at Rae. Time had dealt harder with her than with him and Eunice Gifford, and her widow's dress made her look still darker aud thinner. But the face remained a unique face, with the changing light of the hair, the steel blue eyes, which could give out clear, warm sparks like steel, and the mouth which he still saw tender and mobile as a child's now that it was still. \" Right.\" Matthew Penn had the comfort of telling himself that he and the little town of Clouds and pompous Christopher Gifford had all been right ; he had not seen such another face over land and sea. \"Thank you, Mrs. Gifford,\" he was saying, formally; \" I will do all in my power for your daughter ; I am sorry she should need my help,\" And with that he looked at Delia. The rosy, bold, frank child of two or three had grown into a pale, shy little girl of nine, with her head dangling very much on one side, the only analogy that remained between her and her mock shepherdess' name. Rae began eagerly to detail the child's symptoms of weakness, passing over her own information of Matthew Penn's return from India, and her trick of trust in him"], [331, "RAE GIFFORD. 319 which had been the lure to draw her back to Clouds, as if she had lost all consciousnes of him in her care for her darling. Not a man in a thousand, however faithless and forget ful in himself, but would have been mortified by this oblivion, sacred as it was in its cause. But Matthew Penn was a humane man and somewhat of an enthusiast in his beneficent calling. He bent his mind to see a little patient \u2014 not Rae's child, with features of Christopher Gifford's, which it stung him yet to acknow ledge \u2014 and to understand the case, treating it strictly as a case of suffering childhood. When he had mastered tbe account and formed his judgment, he drew Rae a little aside, and spoke gravely and abstractedly, like a simple physician. \" I think I can help her \u2014 I hope so ; but it can only be after a long trial. It is my duty to tell you that she is suffering from what is always a lingering complaint, but not incurable. If I am to do her any good I must attend her for weeks and months.\" Here the Doctor broke down, and the man spoke out short, sharp, and decisive. \" Rae, she must go to her natural home, to her own house of Linton, and to her aunt, Miss Gifford. It is impossible that she can stay here under other circumstances.\" He had expected Rae to break out in tears and trembling as she had done when a girl, after he proposed to try for an appointment abroad. But she was better schooled now, and the springs of her nature lay deeper. She regarded him with those old tenacious eyes which looked to him as H they had kept all that had ever passed before them, and held it somewhere far down in their depths, and which yet had no reminding and no reproach in their glance, and with her mouth close, contrary to its old slackness. \" I will go over to Linton if Eunice will take me in to wait upon my little girl. I know she will receive Delia, and I think she will let me in to see to the child,\" said Rae, resolutely. Dr. Penn gave Rae no assurance, but he turned to his desk and wrote \u2014 \" Dear Miss Gifford, \u2014 Mrs. Gifford and her child have just come to me. The child is in a bad state of health,"], [332, "320 A LENT LILT. and the mother has a fancy, a superstition, that I could cure her. You had better come and fetch them away immediately, in case of any change of mind on Mrs. Gifford's part. Yours faithfully, \"M. Penn.\" Eunice answered the appeal at once in person, to the great glorification of the Clouds gossips. \" So you have come at last, Rae ; let me see my brother's child,\" was all the reproach Eunice made before she con veyed the two to Linton. Eunice did not deal in re proaches, they were not in her line : they were things that belonged to the past \u2014 useless things ; and Eunice could no more be wantonly than she could be deliberately cruel. Rae had not shown any of the great impracticability which Eunice had liberally attributed to her when thrown on her own resources. The moment that she was her own mistress Rae had conducted herself very like other people, and tolerably discreet people too, in everything save what had referred to Linton. Rae had possessed one relation in this country, an aunt, a childless widow, in an old-established lace trade in an old established town seventy miles from Clouds, and which only changed its fashions in a mdd way and did not often change its tradespeople. This kinswoman had been fond of Rae and had coveted her, in spite of Miss Gifford's experience, to assist her in her trade. Rae had known she would be welcome at Oatley, and there would be no ques tion made of her story that her husband was dead and that she could not live with his sister. Rae had gone aside from the direct road to leave her baggage with an old cheap carrier whom she had once employed before, and thus had unconsciously doubled upon her late pursuers. She had remained on at Oatley until Delia got sickly and until Rae heard, through a succession of third persons, that Matt Penn, the hero and magician of her girlhood, had arrived at his goal and settled at Clouds."], [333, "RAE GIFFORD. 321 CHAPTER V. Rae was back at Linton as if she had never left it, as if she had never laid down a new track for herself, after shrinking and cowering in subserviency and bondage, under \" the burden of an honour,\" which had threatened the individual woman with annihdation. Eunice, without meaning to be unkind, took far less notice of Rae than of Delia. However Eunice's mind might have been diverted from its abiding care, she was much taken up with the child, and that not only with her health, in which she could not credit that there was any thing far wrong. The Giffords, though not long livers, had enjoyed stout, serviceable constitutions while they lasted. This ailment was nothing worse than a temporary disorder brought about by the mismanagement of the ignorant mother. There were many other things to be looked to \u2014 Delia's mind, manners, habits ; everything was to be done over again to fit her for growing up such a girl as Eunice would have her. Rae had a struggle with her suffering child which wrung her own heart, and was part of her punishment to compel the little girl \u2014 accustomed, in the isolated life that they had led, to depend upon her mother for everything, and to look up to her beyond any other human being \u2014 to separate herself from her, and to rely upon and obey a stranger Hke Miss Gifford. \" You must go to your aunt, Deha; your aunt knows best,\" the poor woman had to say meekly every day, in Dr. Penn's hearing, in answer to thc mute, bewddered, disconcerted expression, sometimes to the open, angry, resistance with which poor, ailing little Delia was shaken from her old foundations. When Eunice had got sufficiently acquainted with her niece, she was too honest a woman not to own candidly that she was agreeably surprised by the state in which she found her. \" I suppose that she must have her father's taste for reading,\" observed Eunice complacently; \"but reaUy sho has been carefully taught so far. She understands what I"], [334, "322 A LENT LILT. she reads, and she has paid a little attention to natural history. Her powers of observation have been called forth, and I have no doubt reflection will follow.\" \" I did the best I could for her,\" replied Rae. Eunice faced round on her sister-in-law. \"You don't mean that you taught DeHa, Rae? How could you spare time ? and you had never any turn for study.\" \"I had to prepare mysed for being Delia's companion,\" Rae explained simply ; \" and Aunt Kitty always allowed me to sit in the empty work-room at night with a book, when she had a friend with her in the back parlour.\" Eunice learnt something which she had not dreamt of in her philosophy. Rae had done more than keep up the hard-won knowledge with which she had been crammed at Linton, done more than read on at meaner editions of the old dry histories. Spurred by a woman's motive, she Had procured for herself new volumes and sought other knowledge \u2014 knowledge more pertaining to the heart than the brain, more in keeping with her own nature, more Hke what Mat Penn had taught her \u2014 when she was bright and original herself \u2014 by the druggist's mean hearth, or out under the glorious starlight of the Clouds lanes. Another thing that Eunice remarked with amazement, was that Rae had lost the crouching, slovenly gait of a slave. No longer gagged by restraint and smitten with hopeless con fusion, but forgetting everything in one fond purpose, she now held herself up and moved alert and self-possessed in all the offices of life. \" A prodigy has come under my notice,\" confessed mag nanimous Eunice to her friend the doctor. \" I am very glad of it, but it is not the less a prodigy. My sister-in law, who left me the emptiest, most tiresome, awkward woman, has gone and served an apprenticeship to an old lace-worker, and come back almost well-informed, interest ing, and graceful. It is quite wonderful how she has fitted herself to associate with Delia.\" \" Quite wonderful,\" repeated Dr. Penn stiffly. Perhaps the doctor was thinking that the poor mother's labour was in vain; for it was his painful part to tell Miss Gifford that his penetration had been at fault \u2014 he had been mis taken in his medical verdict \u2014 and that his skill could do"], [335, "323 RAE GIFFORD. nothing to save little Delia, the only child of the Giffords of Linton, not although she were ten Delias and there were ten Lintons hanging on his breath. Just when the cowslips were nodding in golden tufts in the paddock for the little girl to pluck and dry in pedantic play, since she was too old to toss them in cowslip baUs ; and when streams of new milk were flowing for her to bathe in, if need were for the waste ; when her Aunt Eunice was ready to employ for her private benefit all her sound, wed-digested theories of early hours, and mingled exercise, and study ; Delia was fast bound for the narrow house of her father's grave. It was not easy to convince the energetic, strong-wiUed woman that there was nothing but premature decay and death for Delia, nothing but submission and loss for Eunice ; that the little niece and successor, on whom she had originally set such store, and who had been stolen away from her, was only found again to be resigned for ever in this world ; and that Linton might go to a far-away cousin who did not even bear the name of Gifford. Poor Dr. Penn had a more trying task to fulfil. He had to warn Rae that her pet was not hers to keep, that he could not stay Delia's departure, and that the departure was so near at hand he dared not defer the misery of the warning. He did not shrink from this duty, he even appropriated it, as d to prevent its falling into Eunice's hands, either to spare Eunice or Rae. \" When may Delia be able to sit up again, Dr. Penn ? This lying on her back does not seem to agree with her. I half think she grows weaker every day,\" Rae said to the doctor one May morning, when she had followed him to the drawing-room, where he was consulting sadly with Eunice. Rae was trying to read his face with eyes strain ing themselves, yet recoiling in anguish from what they should read there. \"Yes, she is a great deal weaker,\" said Dr. Penn, very curtly and gravely. \" Should you like me to bring another doctor, Mrs. Gifford ? \" \"No ; why should I ? \" She set her mouth to repel the suggestion. Dr. Penn was very white, and he put his hand up to his quivering mouth."], [336, "324 A LENT LILT. \"Because I am very sorry \u2014 I am afraid \" \"Don't say it, Matthew Penn! How can you be so cruel ? Oh ! spare me, spare me \u2014 don't tell me that ! '\" cried Rae, putting out her hands to stop him. \" I came to you to cure her, because I believed in you after all ; and you will kill me also, if you tell me that I must give up my child, my little ewe lamb, the only one thing on earth I have to care for. How can you expect me to bear it ? \" Rae resisted madly. \" Rae, these are most improper words. This is most unbecoming conduct to Dr. Penn. Do you think that no one suffers with you in your selfish sorrow?\" cried Eunice, more harshly than she had ever before spoken to her sister in-law. But Dr. Penn put her aside quickly, and caught Mrs. Gifford by the arm. \"Rae,\" he said, piteously, \"I could do no more. Don't give way thus. While there is life there is hope. Do you hear me, Rae ? \u2014 you used to heed me. Heaven may interpose.\" While he was speaking nearly as desperate words as Rae's, the mother thought that she heard a call from Delia. Rae changed in a second from striving in love's fury to smiling in its sublime despair, as she broke away from him to go back and stand by her child's bed. \" Oh, God ! \" he said low, looking after her, \" I wish I could comfort her.\" Eunice Gifford gazed on the two. Her pale face grew a shade paler. Her firm lips were compressed almost painfully. There was a gathering intelligence in her eyes which blighted everything they looked upon in the old familiar beloved house, even more than the news of poor little Delia's fate. Eunice, whom nobody was watching, of whom nobody was thinking, quitted the room with a step goaded on by what she left behind. She went and locked herself in her room, and withdrew for the time from all charge and nursing of the dying child. When Eunice reappeared, it was because Delia, flinging out every tendril of her heart, in a way common to the dying, summoned her. Even then Eunice came reluctantly, and with her clear ivory features all drawn and tremulous from recent conflict. Delia had that divine maturity, or that inspiration, which"], [337, "RAE GIFFORD. 325 -sometimes precedes a Httle child's death. The senseless little one had received unspoken notice of her condition ; the shy, loving child was timid no longer, and was calm in her affection, while those who had been her older, wiser friends were awed into restraining their shivering, sobbing grief. DeHa sat supported by her pdlows like a little woman, or rather like a tiny angel who somehow had had its wings soiled, and trailing with this world's sin and sorrow, but who had shaken them free. She told her mother not to be too sorry for her. She said that she was going to a better home. She thanked Dr. Penn, and bade him kiss her and say good-bye ; and then she turned and cast her eyes on Eunice, with a little break in her perfect composure. \" How vexed Aunt Eunice must be to part with me, to make her look like that,\" said DeHa, in a perplexed tone. And Eunice bowed her stiff neck and hid her assured face. \"Don't be so vexed, Aunt Eunice,\" the child commanded, recovering herself ; \"be friends with mother, be friends with her without me.\" And then she died. Another spring's grass was green over DeHa's grave. Rae still lived on at Linton, and Dr. Penn continued to come there, with full permission from Eunice. \" I see it all,\" said Eunice to Dr. Penn when they were alone together one day. She spoke frankly, and not with out friendliness, yet a shade of condescension had come into her tone which had not been always there when Dr. Penn was concerned. \" You must speak to her.\" And then she added, with a stretch of fancy for Eunice Gifford, who was softer and more indulgent since her own ramparts had been broken down ever so little, for ever so short a time, \" I believe you two have been designed for each other. I don't mean to say that she is worthy of you, Dr. Penn ; I don't pretend that any more than I pretended it to Christopher ; but you have never got over your sepa ration, and will never be happy till you come together.\" Dr. Penn took advantage of Rae's pensive custom of strolling in the paddock, where she had carried her baby, and spoke to the purpose. He reminded her of his own false pride which had first tried her beyond her strength. He assured her that while he might have been indignant .and resentful, unjustly, indeed, he had never yet been able"], [338, "326 A LENT LILT. in the worldly triumph of his life to forget the loveliest and most devoted woman he had known. The words were foolishness to Rae, but she was not resentful \u2014 had never been resentful, and it was in self depreciation that she implored him, \u2014 \" Don't ask me to forget my darling, Matthew Penn.\" \"Ah! Rae, you know nothing of it,\" the doctor ex claimed, with sorrowful passion. \" You women are alt egotists. Your darling was yours while you had her. Think what it must be to have a darling who was another's, and who has forgotten you ? \" His words wrung from Rae a great and bitter cry. \" I never forgot you, Mat ; I tried, and it half broke my heart ; but I could not do it, forgetfulness was not in me. But when I got my child, I could Hve for her and I could die for her. When I came back and heard you were courting Eunice Gifford, I thought that it was something more I had got to do for little Delia, and I could have done it \u2014 I, who would have died for her \u2014 to brook to see you and Eunice man and wrife.\" Doctor Penn said no more of women's egotism. \" Come home, Rae, to your own old home, which I have occupied for you \u2014 which I have prepared for you.\" And his eyes shone, for he knew that she could not choose but come. The doctor's prosperity was no longer hodow, nor his study cheerless. Clouds had reason to declare afresh that Joe Corbet's girl was a wonderfully taking girl \u2014 a wonder fully taking woman and lady. Eunice cried, another prodigy ! Her old drag, Rae, was at once sagacious and bright as her husband. Little children, with Delia's face, clasped the long-suffering doctor's neck, and heard from him, as from their mother, of the little sister who had clasped it before them, and bidden him good-bye, and who had helped to bring their father and mother together."], [339, "FROM A PARIS JARDINIERE"], [340, ""], [341, "A FRENCH HONEYSUCKLE. (LORLOTTE AND THE CAPITAINE.) CHAPTER I. THE BEE AND THE BUTTERFLY\u2014 MADAME DUPONT'S BENEVOLENT INSTITUTIONS\u2014 THE CAPITAINE AGREES TO THE SUMMONING OF LORLOTTE. The Duponts rented a great perfumery shop in the Rue des Magasins, Paris, and lived in the entresol, with the whole ad so penetrated and saturated with the sweet fumes of lavender, orange, and millefleurs, that the city home recalled vividly to one sense the barren cliffs, aromatic pastures, and sea-views of Provence. Madame Dupont's orange-tubs and violet-pots in her window were supernumeraries and purely \u00e6sthetical in thed end. Madame was the presiding genius of the whole place \u2014 entresol and shop \u2014 a born tradeswoman and manager, ugly, vivacious, lynx-eyed, but not wasting her powers in unnecessary irritability or acts of oppression to the bargain as it were, but calculating their value closely, and putting them out to interest as carefully as the rest of her stock. She regarded M. Dupont as a desirable adjunct to her business and family, was faithful to him in both lights, and even sharply indulgent to him ; but she never dreamt of regarding him as anything but an adjunct and an inferior. M. Dupont, on his part, was quite content with his position. It saved him an infinite deal of trouble ; it"], [342, "330 A FRENCH HONETSUCKLE. suited his debonnaire pleasure-loving disposition. M. Dupont was a dapper little man, with white teeth, a very pretty figure, and a very small foot, all of which personal advantages madame had taken into consideration, and valued rather above than below their value in making her aUiance with monsieur, qualified and skilled as she was in business transactions. But the strongest fortress has a weak point in its battlements, and the wisest woman's heart has the flaw of a folly. For' the rest, monsieur was idiotically vain, exceedingly good-natured, kind-hearted, and a good deal addicted to lying \u2014 not the lie malicious and spiteful, but the purely gasconading lie, to glorify himself and all belonging to him. Madame and monsieur got on together admirably : he did the ornamental and madame the useful in their married life, and the only fault to be found with the per formance was, that the traditional cast of characters in the play suffered a reversal. The couple had no children, but one of madame's dis tinctive traits was that she was a great family woman, and acknowledged, brought forward, marshalled, and marched off the carpet, so far as settling them in Hfe was concerned, the kinsmen and kinswomen of hersed and monsieur to the remotest degree of consanguinity, with the greatest impartiality. She could afford herself the luxury, for the Duponts were of the substantial and affluent order of tradespeople, and she took the best plan to be successful in such operations by carrying them on summarily, and without hesitation. Madame had come upstairs from keeping shop on a fine afternoon in May, after the best hours for sales and for fashionable customers were over. She was in her invariable black gown and jacket, and black head-dress ; the last brightened by a yellow rose, which summer and winter, in spite of decades of different head-dresses, never faded or died out of madame's head. When she replaced the lace of the coiffure with fresh lace, she took out the immortal rose, pinched and shook it, and restored it in all its original crispness and yellowness to its niche over her right temple. By way of rest, madame was sewing steadily and with astonishing rapidity, \u2014 mending, patching, turning upside"], [343, "LORLOTTE AND THE CAPITAINE. 331 down, and inside out, some mysterious portion of her wardrobe, while monsieur, who had done nothing all day save saunter from the entresol to the shop and back again, smoke cigarettes, read Galignani and the play-bills, lay in a chintz dressing-gown and a Greek cap, on a leopard-skin couch, amidst the white paint, marble, plate-glass, and gilding, with which madame had not failed to furnish and garnish, as the French have it properly, her little salon, in which she never sat, except for an hour, as a ceremony requded of her by etiquette, every afternoon, or when she was receiving company. Monsieur lay with his eyes shut, except at intervals, when he opened those orbs, round, black, and twinkling, to their full extent, enlarging them, indeed, as far as he was able, to contemplate with intense interest and satisfaction in the mirror opposite him, the curl of his sleek moustache, or to regard with perfect approbation the general symmetry of his tiny foot, which he exerted himself to kick up at a right angle, in order to afford him a finer opportunity of inspection. \"Louis,\" exclaimed madame, brusquely \u2014 (she had none of the catlike ways of some of her countrywomen, \u2014 no slyness, no stealthy approach to her aim, and feint of retreat when she was about to attack ; had she been an English woman, she would have been called blunt ; being- French, she was now and then stigmatized as brutal) \u2014 \" I shall have your cousin Lorlotte up from her English school at Boulogne next week, since she is idle, with the scarlet fever among the children.\" \" My dear Paulette, you are an angel as usual, but you startle me a little, to the jarring of my teeth,\" replied monsieur, with a delicate suggestion that madame's abrupt ness was too much for him. \"Why should you have Lorlotte for the present ? Her great vacations are not till June, when she must come here or board herself, and the little one has no salary to spare after she has gowned, hatted, gloved, and shod herself. I believe she has in herited a slight weakness in the last respect. Never mind, in the mean time the school is obliged to keep her, and she has had the scarlet fever already. Pardon me for my dul ness, my friend, but I do not comprehend your invitation,\" observed monsieur, innocently. The fact was, that good family woman as madame was,"], [344, "332 A FRENCH HONETSUCKLE. she was by no means in the habit of treating her relations to bed and board a la discretion and at all seasons. \" Bah ! \" ejaculated madame, coolly, \" you never see beyond the end of your nose, and you have no end of the nose to speak of, to turn the corner.\" She intermitted her stitching for a second to tap, by way of emphatic contrast, her own prominent, self-asserting, broadly-rooted nose, of which monsieur's smart pug was but a small edition. '\u2022 Then help my short sight, madame ; you owe it to me,\" pleaded monsieur, not at all offended. \" My cousin the capitaine is with his regiment on duty at Fontainebleau ; next month he will be gone to Cherbourg, or he may be ordered to Algerie. Do you understand? \" Monsieur leapt up so as to sit upright and stamp his foot on the parquetted floor. \" Voild / this is the scarlet fever in Paris which is to supersede that at Boulogne.\" Madame did not acknowledge the witticism, but she did not affect a shade of concealment : she nodded the yellow rose, and looked monsieur somewhat stolidly in the face with her green-gray eyes. \" I have fixed that Lorlotte is the partie for the capitaine, and the capitaine for Lorlotte. They meet here next week, are introduced, affianced, and she gets her trousseau without trouble, and they are married without delay. She does not return to her tasks as an instructress ; he does not need to waste any more money as a bachelor, or to go to Algerie. Her dot, which has been out at nurse, will suffice for the requirements of the service ; his pay will match the interest of her dot. It would have been otherwise had it been Lorlotte's cousin Agathe and her dot. Agathe must look higher. But this marriage is good, excellent for both our cousins ; therefore, my child, the affair is fixed unalterably in my mind ; it is all but a fact accomplished, and we have only the details to attend to.\" Her \" child,\" who served her as well as a child and a great deal better than a parrot or a dog, great or small, credited her statement implicitly ; still he had his doubts and objec tions, and adjunct as monsieur was, he was in as full possession of the liberty of speech as any free-born Briton. \" But the capitaine has fifty years, and Lorlotte only twenty-two.\""], [345, "333 LORLOTTE AND THE CAPITAINE. \" Ah, well, so much the richer the capitaine ! \" madame distanced the objector with grim, disdainful humour. \" The capitaine is not a beau gorgon. He is grey headed. He looks as if he had swallowed his own sword without breaking it, and was not able to bend throughout its length. Lorlotte is gentille, as gay as a chaffinch, and her English mistresses and pupils have rendered her wild.\" \" The capitaine is a very good example of a militaire : I should be proud of so warlike a husband,\" declared madame, in sudden parenthesis, with a strange suspicion of a spice of coquetry, like the most daring and presuming of fadies, lurking within the folds of the black jacket, and underneath the petals of the yellow rose. \" And if Lorlotte is a little spoilt, tho more reason that she should be re moved from these romantic, reckless English she is with. It is not possible that the child can have lost her morals in a year and a half's time. She got a dispensation from her cure, I know, for her Catholic religion, but she got no dispensation that I heard of from her morals ; I should not have permitted such a thing.\" \" fiave you never heard, my dear, that the capitaine is a lion when he is roused ; that he falls into the rage like an Englishman when he is provoked ? \" \" Chansons ! we can take care of all that. The Hon is the most generous of animals ; does not La Fontaine say so ? And you know she is used to those English \u2014 one of whom hanged himself because they had served him tea without sugar.\" \" The capitaine could never keep a sou of his pay since I had thc honour of his acquaintance. He is not at all a mauvais sujet, agreed, madame. On the contrary, he is a father to the boys of his regiment since he entered it a simple soldier; 'but he spends on beer and pipes, and flowers and children, on relieving his comrades from the Mont de Piete, and on charity to the poor, like a mauvais sujet.\" \" Ten thousand reasons why the poor man should marry and give his purse to another. When Lorlotte is mistress of his menage all that is changed.\" Monsieur shrugged his shoulders expressively, as if with a lively realization of that obligation. \" Ah ! Well, also, Paulette, you are a charming intriguante, a Princess dc"], [346, "334 A FRENCH HONETSUCKLE. Benvenuto ; my wife, I felicitate you upon it. It is necessary that it is quite equal to me, to Lorlotte, and to the capitaine, since you wish it.\" \"Without doubt,\" acquiesced madame, quietly, and with entire conviction, \" and I have need that you bring the capitaine to me to-morrow in order that he may be made au fait to my views.\" \" Certainly, madame ; I shall seek him out at his cafe or his cremerie, if he is not in funds. We shall take a little turn on the Boulevards : our styles suit : there are never so many dames look aside at me, flash a glance of approval at \u2014 my boot, shall I say, Paulette ? as when I walk with a moustache grise, putting forth the paw of a polar bear. Ah ! there was such a grand dame descending from her carriage in La Rue Lepelletier yesterday, who gave me a smile ; but that I am your devoted servant, that smde would have drawn down an angel on his knees. But you are not jealous, ma belle ; the foot is yours to run your errands, and I shall sound the capitaine as we take our turn on the Boulevards.\" \"By no means,\" negatived madame decidedly and im peratively, but without impatience or ill-humour, nay, she was specially gracious. \" Make your foot as pretty as you please, Louis ; that is your forte. I am not so bete as to quarrel with it. More than that I know it is my foot, and, of course, other women envy me the possession of it. What did I marry for ? But don't meddle in my matter of proposing his marriage to the capitaine. Mind your own affairs, my son. Hark ! There is my beU.\" And madame gathered up her work and descended like a bee to hum over the decanting of whole jars of heliotrope and attar of roses, the filling of little flagons, the mere waftings \u2022of perfume on handkerchiefs and gloves, doing all with conscious, consummate address, the exercise of which was in itself happiness ; whde monsieur, like a butterfly, caught up his embroidered cap, exchanged his dressing-gown for his dress coat, and sauntered out to flutter and flaunt and -show off his pretty face aud figure, which were part of madame's investments, and served her after their kind, by appearing in any public garden, or at any spectacle, or bourgeois ball, which might be worthy of their presence. At thc same hour next afternoon the capitaine reported"], [347, "335 LORLOTTE AND THE CAPITAINE. himself duly in the boudoir at the entresol in obedience to the summons of his cousin, for whom he had much respect and some fear. The capitaine was just such a military man as M. Dupont had described, the antipodes of the popular English idea of a Frenchman : unmistakably elderly, heavy, yet gaunt, so accustomed to face dangers and disagreeables in a long life of discipline, that he did everything, good and bad. with almost the same imperturbability of mien ; stiff and stark in his dark blue uniform and high collar like the effigy of a man, unless when he blazed out in a Gadic childishness of passion, during which he was as dangerous to himself as to his neighbours. Madame was the capitaine's junior by five years, as one counts the years of a man's life, but she was his senior by a century in worldly wisdom. She knew him well, took a family pride in his rank, his red ribbon, his distinctions, his courage and simplicity ; as in her catholicity of nature she took a pride in the good looks and bonhomie of her butterfly husband. She had helped the capitaine, Denis le Froy, before now, got him out of his spendthrift scrapes, and made a clear way for his soldier's tramp through the thicket of difficulties which hedge in a man whose very sous burn his pocket, until she had a right to counsel and direct him, and the capitaine, honest and honourable, admitted the right. Madame, without persiflage and in strong terms, made out her case and her point. She did not spare the capi- taine, while she did not omit the capabilities and good qualities of Lorlotte. She convicted the poor capitaine, standing at attention on her own parquetted floor, disconcerted, troubled, all but shamed \u2014 he was too good a man to be out and out shamed before her \u2014 of mature age, of want of provision for the future. For example, he would need a nurse some day, perhaps soon, for he had suffered from yellow fever at Guadaloupe, cholera at Berbice, frost-bite in the Crimea, and ague near Sols erino, and not without leaving their traces behind them ; and unless he went permanently into thc hospital, or depended on one of the blessed sisters, who was to look after him? His mother had died when he was a little fellow, his sisters were long married, and not having had"], [348, "336 A FRENCH HONETSUCKLE. the benefit of madame's advice in marriage, had wedded a couple of roturiers, needy and disreputable, and cared little for him, save to accept his gifts and strip him of as much of his pension as he was foolish enough to give them. Would the capitaine not like to have two little apart ments which he could call his own after all his wanderings, to which he could retire when he was not in spirits for the barrack company, where he could rear his flowers on trel lises in boxes in the windows or on his stove \u2014 a stove of his own, by which he might smoke and study his treatises on fortification and military memoirs without molestation ? Would he not like to have a boy and girl of his own to bear his name \u2014 the one to enter the regiment as he had done, and rise to be a general, and the other to be dutiful to him, fond of him, and to mend his collars and sew on his buttons, and play ecarte with him, and smooth the way to his seeing the priest, when her mother's eyes had grown dim and her memory failed ? In thc mean time Lorlotte would be as gay as a bird, fluttering under his wing ; and in the summer, when madame took her holiday, her one holiday in the year, they would all go together, monsieur and she, the capitaine and Lorlotte, to spend the day at Versailles or at St. Cloud, to see the gardens or the manufactory of porcelain, and to dine in the forest or the meadows. The capitaine heard his life in its landmarks pulled up and laid down afresh without resistance ; he even assented submissively, \" Oui, oui, that is true ; \" and warmed into a sudden ruddy glow which seemed out of proportion to the occasion, at the cunning mention of the flowers and the children. Still he said candidly, \" But, madame, will Mademoiselle Lorlotte put up with the pipe, and the com rades, and with certain rough phrases, that we've grown into the use of ? I could not give them up at once ; there are some of them I might not give up \u2014 ever.\" \"My dear cousin, Lorlotte is an obedient, affectionate child, more liberal than most girls, though she is also con firmed, and believes and worships as a good Catholic,\" Madame assured him. \" It is understood that all bachelors reform and become family men and Christians when they marry; but you have so little to reform by comparison, that the reformation may be made by degrees.\""], [349, "337 LORLOTTE AND TOE CAPITAINE. \" But, madame my cousin, will Lorlotte bear with me when I am a madman ? You know that I do not mean it, and I do not think that I would harm her ; but I might frighten the poor child beside herself, notwithstanding.\" And the big, grey fellow fumbled with his belt, moved to being stonily abashed and distressed. Madame smiled her superior smile, and waved her hand, dismissing the Quixotic scruple. \" Lorlotte has been accustomed to the English moods like the English fogs ; do you think that she will mind your thunderstorms, my old boy? And although it were so, she is out in the world alone, earning her bread. Say, do you not think that there is more in the world, you who have seen its vices and crimes from east to west, to hurt an unprotected orphan girl, body and soul, than the idle blast, soon spent, of a few furious words and acts ? \" \" I believe it, I believe it, my good madame, and I thank you with all my heart.\" The capitaine took the propitia tion gratefully, and with manifest relief. \" You trust me ; I hope that I may never abuse your trust, and I think that I might make it up to her. But again, will not made moiselle expect more than I can give her? You know that I am as poor as a rat, and that I have not made hoards. Sacre ! I can barely afford her food and clothes. Where aU the fine cashmeres and sdks, mirrors, and consoles like those around me, are to come from, for my Hfe I cannot tell. We can have no better menage than a student's den. \"To begin with, my capitaine,\" madame premised her anxious kinsman, \" Lorlotte will mend all that in the cracking of the joint of a fore-finger. She is as sensible as a grandmother, that cricket of a girl. I should not wonder though you were to end the rich man of the family, and to leave behind you a hundred thousand francs to endow a military college when you are done with your fortune, and have provided for your chddren.\" The capitaine laughed at this climax a hoarse laugh, and the interview terminated in madame's having her will, and getting carte blanche from the capitaine to bring Lorlotte to Paris to marry him. z"], [350, "338 A FRENCH HONETSUCKLE. CHAPTER II. THE INGRATITUDE OF THE WORLD AND THE CONTUMACY OF LORLOTTE\u2014 MONSIEUR HYACINTHE STEPS UPON THE SCENE AND AMAZES MADAME AND HER WORLD. Lorlotte was come. And without so much as a private conversation with madame, Lorlotte knew that she had been brought to Paris for a purpose ; the first time the capitaine's name was mentioned she guessed the purpose, and alas ! for madame's pet scheme and the capitaine's matri monial prospects, she made up her mind to have nothing to say to him ; so far had English communication corrupted French good manners. But Lorlotte was too wise, and, poor child, she was too dependent, to fly in the face of the great woman, Madame Dupont. Lorlotte would keep her own couned and enjoy the season, the sweetest of the four, well expressed by the \" grown green again \" of its French description, reverderies \u2014 and reverderies in Paris. Without committing herself, Lorlotte was not quite ingenuous, dis interested, and regardless of consequences ; but what will you have, though she had Hved eighteen months in an English school ? Lorlotte was happy in having a face and figure which in a degree interpreted the spdit within. She was a dark, bright, espiegle child, with a child's naivete, contending with a woman's consciousness. Her figure was small, Hght, ex quisitely dainty, even elegant in her spring muslins, and hats and bonnets trimmed and manufactured by her own lissome fingers, and always anticipating the season in then' adornment of a single wild rose, a spray of hawthorn, a little plume of lilac. Her face was small too, and dregu lar-featured in its youthful roundness, but with delicate, slightly contracted, very expressive brown brows over violet eyes, a tinge of poppy red in the clear brown of her cheeks, and a dimpled cleft cherry for a mouth, with its stone cleft for teeth. Let us observe that Madame Dupont had said not a word of Lorlotte's personal attractions to the capitaine. In the first place, they had nothing to do with the advan-"], [351, "339 lorlotte and the capitaine. tages of the match in madame's eyes ; in the second, if they weighed at all in a man's foolish fancy, they would weigh with double weight coming upon him unexpectedly. The effect which Lorlotte 's attractions reaUy had on the \u2022capitaine when the two were formally presented to each other, and Lorlotte had executed her school-girl bow in return for the capitaine's salute, was not only that the capitaine was enslaved, but struck dumb in his slavery ; while Lorlotte, the heedless, hard-hearted girl, \u2014 for young girls have at once the kindest and the most cruel of hearts in their inexperience and ignorance, laughed at him, turned up her fine little nose at him, set herself cooUy to mock and make a cat's-paw of him, and as if that were not bad enough, privately to tease and vex him. Not only was there nothing in the capitaine to catch a girl's eye at first sight ; there was not even anything to make him respectable to the sharp eyes of her cupidity. \" The man is as poor as a Franciscan,\" Lorlotte exclaimed to hersed in derision. \" I heard him borrow a five-franc piece from madame the other day, and she told him to see that he made a note of it and paid her. I should have to work for him and cook for him. Perhaps I should have to take pupils again, when he went on half-pay or lost his month's income at a lottery. I suppose I am intended to serve as his bread-winner in his old age and infirmities,\" meditated Lorlotte saucily. \" No, thank you, madame, I would rather not. I should prefer at least the hope of a strong arm to work for me and to lean upon, d not a heavy purse for me to empty, or I should choose the sympathies of a grand passion Hke what the English are not ashamed to speak of as coming even before marriage and lasting all the life afterwards.\" But Lorlotte was not rebellious in the preliminaries, \"before the capitaine's shyness had yielded to more ener getic impulses, and caused him to empower madame to cross the rubicon and make his proposal, which was quite an understood thing, in form for him. Such behaviour on Lorlotte's part would have been regarded as \u25a0an outrage on a young girl's sense of propriety, almost of decency, and would have been sufficient provocation to cause her to be packed off in dire disgrace back to her verbs and her scales at Boulogne. And Lorlotte dearly loved a"], [352, "340 FRENCH HONEYSUCKLE. holiday, above all a holiday in Paris in May ; had a natural distaste to the comparative isolation, self-restraint, and drudgery of her school-room (though she was a favourite both with principals and pupils), and shrank above all from disgrace. So Lorlotte finessed, laughed, sparkled all over, protested, \u2014 and permitted the capitaine daily to stand sentry at her elbow. She accepted his daily bouquets in neatly cut paper bouquetiers, inscribed in a stiff hand writing with fine flourishes, \"the sweetest to the most sweet,\" and walked abroad with him and madame to church and market. But madame was a shrewd woman, and far-sighted. She saw through Lorlotte's pretended demureness and real evasions. She did not altogether like the look of matters. The capitaine in his humility and blindness might be satisfied ; madame was not content, and she had made known her wishes and so far staked her credit on the event. Madame delivered many a stinging stricture on the contumacy of girls, and the ingratitude of the world, in the ear of M. Dupont, who tried to reassure her, in his light confident line, that Lorlotte must do her duty. When was such an enormity, absurdity, and indelicacy ever heard of as a young girl's having a mind of her own, and resist ing the intentions of her best friends in her disposal in marriage ? At the same time madame acted warily; she was not double, but she was not rash. She did not want to come to close quarters with Lorlotte too soon, to push the per verted gdl into the heinousness of defiance of righteous authority; and madame was a merciful woman, particularly when it would serve no purpose save the worst to be harsh. She would prefer to draw the lines of her strong tenacious will contrasted with Lorlotte's youthful frivolity and help lessness, more and more tightly round the girl, till she was caught beyond escape, let her flutter ever so wildly. Madame's displeasure and indignation were reserved in the background, not altogether concealed, yet not pounc ing on their victim. For the present madame kept the peace with Lorlotte because there was no time to be lost. Within three weeks the capitaine's regiment would have quitted Fontainebleau, and madame had fixed vmalterably that within that brief space the capitaine should have"], [353, "LORLOTTE AND THE CAPITAINE. 341 taken to himself a wife, retired from active service, and pitched his tent \u2014 that is, rented and filled a suite of rooms in a convenient quarter \u2014 -which should be home to him for the rest of his days. A coup-de-main was called for. Madame, in her philan thropy and family devotion, antedated her annual holiday. Every summer madame was in the habit of laying aside her black jacket, cap, and rose jaune, and of arraying her sed in an imposing \u2014 what monsieur caded a sublime \u2014 black silk gown, with innumerable flounces (which passed the most of its existence in sdver paper), a lace shawl, and a wonderful white capote, with a compliment of grand asters and nodding wheat ears \u2014 in a single stroke, airy and magnificent. Thus attded she went, attended by her joli garcon, the most amiable of coxcombs, and provided with a huge hamper of simple dainty eatables by way of luggage, along with other pleasure-seekers, by an excursion train to the country, to pay her respects to nature for thc season. Everybody knows that the most fossihferous of lovers will burst into Hfe and greenness under the influence of a holiday in the country. Madame afforded the capitaine the opportunity of liming a twig for Lorlotte. There was madame, in the sublimely flounced sdk gown and capote, seated with dignity, yet with more fervour in her very pursuit of an excursion than lingers in a middle- aged tradeswoman out of Paris, making the most of her ticket and her day abroad. There was Lorlotte, in her simplest and most bewitching toilette \u2014 a buff nankin cotton skirt, and jacket which would not crush, braided like a child's dress, and a garden hat with a dark green ribbon and a little knot of violets that could be thrown down with impunity among the long grass, and heaped up with the most poetically named of daisies, \u2014 the marguerites of May. There was the capitaine, in his horribly unbecoming tight uniform, with its high collar, his short, grizzled hair in the regimental cut, covered by a small comical casquette, with a leather strap over his white bearded chin, moving his legs \u2014 right, left, right, left \u2014 in strides, \u2022exactly as a child can draw out the legs of a whole platoon of toy wooden soldiers, guarding the women."], [354, "342 A FRENCH HONETSUCKLE. The three formed a suggestive group, among noisy ouvriers, long-haired students and clerks, picturesque farmers' wives and peasant-women of the country, and smart grisettes of the city, their fellow pleasure-seekers.. But monsieur should have formed the fourth, and he did not find his way to the platform tUl the last moment. Punctuality is not the virtue of petits maitres, and neither is discretion. When monsieur did turn up in his outre dandy costume \u2014 hunting boots (when monsieur had never so much as seen a hunt in his days), vest striped a la jockey, pin in the mould of a genuine fox's head \u2014 he merely exhausted the toleration which madame was wont to show to his shortcomings. He was not alone : he had a friend on his arm ; a bachelor, a student from a neigh bouring quarter. He introduced him volubly all round ; he proposed him easily as a volunteer addition to the party. Madame was one of the most catholic-minded of bees. It has been seen that she did not quarrel with butterflies, and she did not even quarrel in the abstract with dragon flies. But the contretemps was cruel. She had arranged a partie carree, which could easily fall into two couples, and: here were five people, an utterly unmanageable number, and the fifth, to say the least, more than a foil to tho capitaine. M. Hyacinthe Masses was a handsome, dashing young man of four-and-twenty \u2014 one year older thau Lorlotte. She had heard of him already as the beau garcon; not only so \u2014 but as the witty and wild misguiding star,. and chief lure of all the bachelors of his quarter, who wrote the cleverest feuilletons in the most reckless journals,. and danced tho hardest and the longest the most furious galop at the fastest dancing-hall. Possibly, if you were very near him, you might get a coarse whiff of the strong smoke with which he and all his belongings were impreg nated; you might detect that his linen had been frayed, rent, and darned several times \u2014 and that his jaunty hat was napless. In the some way a subtle mind might dis cover that there were windy fumes in his eloquence, holes repaired as best might be in his philosophy, and a general baldness and hollowness in his assumption of universal learn ing, general accomplishments, and knowledge of the world. But a subtle mind was needed for the last discovery. IV"], [355, "343 LORLOTTE AND THE CAPITAINE. an inexperienced Httle girl, conceited on her own account, M. Hyacinthe was the pride and flower of the manliness, genius, and good looks of young France. And there was M. Hyacinthe, bowing to Lorlotte with marked deferential gaUantry, and staring at her admiringly with his great black eyes till her violet eyes sank before his in pretty confusion, while the poor capitaine was keeping guard in vain. M. Dupont's betise was so monstrous, and he was so unconscious of it, that it was piquante ; but madame could not enjoy it as she enjoyed many of his betises. The Duponts and their friends were going with the rest of the holiday world to Montmorenci, where there was a fete ; but though they took advantage of the cheap trains there for the day, they considered themselves above dis porting themselves with the multitude about the stalls, shows, and open-ad lotteries. Madame Dupont and her cousin the capitaine were too erect and serious, because of their responsibilities and obligations. M. Dupont was too refined, notwithstanding that he was dying to show off his airs and graces, his boots, and the silk lining of his pale tot, his rings and charms \u2014 with which madame supplied him liberally \u2014 to the gaping throng. M. Hyacinthe and Mademoiselle Lorlotte were too intellectual when they happened to be, as in the present instance, in rarely con genial company ; out of it, Lorlotte could head a village dance joyously, and Hyacinthe could prove the veriest mountebank of a fair. The Dupont party strolled away from the hubbub of the shooting at a mark and the merry-go-rounds, to the natural attractions of Montmorenci on a May-day. They sought out a little path past the lake, through vineyards, through a fragrant vista of walnut-trees and feathery acacias, to a natural orchard, enamelled with jonquills below and apple-blossoms above, enough to make any cockney of London or Paris cry out to be allowed to \" pick \" on all sides. There the party took possession of the enchanting dining-room, seated themselves on the turf like a bourgeois version of a group by Watteau or Wouver mann, minus the horses and dogs, and were not so senti mental as to despise madame's provision basket, with its pates and spiced bread, its humble eau de groseille, and"], [356, "344 A FRENCH HONETSUCKLE. more pretentious sparkling Burgundy, which two gamins from the railway-station had carried in triumph behind them. But there was a disadvantage in going a-Maying even when the weather was unexceptionable, with an end in view, and when you were not sure of all your company. Although thc Duponts kept themselves distinct and apart from the lower orders, they could not altogether escape the freedom of tone implied in the association. Just when madame wished to be most stringent in the enforcement of her bourgeoise etiquette, the student, M. Hyacinthe, set her at nought and defied her, as he could not have done in her own house or in that of an acquaintance. He attached himself to Lorlotte, devoted himself to her, and constituted himself her partner in place of the capitaine, unwarrant ably and unceremoniously jostling aside the antique awkward warrior, as d Lorlotte was not a young bourgeoise under a married friend's wing, who ought not to have a word to say unless to her fiance till she was married out of hand at least ; \u2014 as if Lorlotte were no better than a workgirl, and he one of the workmen who had come to have a day's jollity and desperate flirtation with her, un mindful of the consequences, like so many of the visitors to Montmorenci. The truth was, both Hyacinthe and Lorlotte foigot themselves in an abandonment of youthful sentiment and gaiety : harangued and prattled, moralized and laughed, as if they had known each other all their lives, and had been brother's or sister's children at least. French men and women \u2014 the most artificial race on earth \u2014 are more en raptured and intoxicated with their glimpses of nature, perhaps by reason of its freshness and novelty to them, than English, Germans, or Italians allow themselves to be. Positively M. Hyacinthe became eloquent in his rhodo montades on primitive arcadia, truth, tenderness, and by a youthful analogy, death. His pale, large-eyed face, with its cloud of long hair and its traces of excess in all things, rather than of dry addiction to law or physic, was lit up, not with passion, but with spirituality. On her side, Lorlotte's vivacity was softened and melted, and acquired a new grace without losing its spontaneous naivete."], [357, "345 LORLOTTE AND THE CAPITAINE. It was not all to nature, either in the fields of Mont morenci or of young humanity, that these bewitching effects were due. If Lorlotte had known it, there was a fooHsh fond little face which had once bloomed as fair as Lor lotte's \u2014 the remembrance of which, unsought by M. Hyacinthe, unacknowledged even to himself, blended with his May-day pleasure, and lent a wild pathos to his random talk and to the expression of his great eyes as they dwelt on Lorlotte. Strange mortal that Frenchman who can extract a pungent sweetness from his own follies and their individual punishment, and can indulge a Bohemian gene rosity in the fidelity which in a small measure redeems his \u25a0errors and shields his victims ! If M. Hyacinthe had known it, Lorlotte was puffing out and pluming itself as a little bird plumes itself for a grand flight. \" I am no longer behind the English girls,\" she was saying to herself. \" I have got a disinterested adorer, and oh ! such a splendid young lover of my own, far before Miss Emma Herbert's sous-lieutenant, and Miss Clara Brown's curate. I have scorned my ancient admirer as they scorned the old general and the great merchant who Hved to buy them with their rank and their bags of gold. But my capitaine has only a little rank and no money, and I am a poor girl myself, and this is France \u2014 not England.\" Madame saw it all, and still did not interfere much ; too wise a woman to waste her artillery or to bring it into disrepute by failure. She did not so much as rebuke her Louis. \" fie does not comprehend,\" she decided magnani mously, \" and there is no use in trying to make him, for it is not in the boy.\" With large even-handed justice she dealt the blame to herself principally. \" I ought to have apprehended all the chances of a fete and not have risked them. M. Hyacinthe is a gay young bachelor, a vaurien, .and Lorlotte, \u2014 ouf ! all girls are babies or hypocrites. They have been exposed to each other, they shall be exposed no more until after the marriage, and then the capitaine can see to it. For the rest, my poor dear capitaine, who has been slighted and made a fool of, is long-suffering and modest when he does not happen to have his rages. I must not let him get into one of the rages, and he will make allowance for a couple of silly young people in the woods, where, it is true, a silly old"], [358, "346 A FRENCH HONEYSUCKLE. woman took them. It is an age since I read St. Pierre's- Paid et Virginie, and bah! I believe there is something immoral in trees and water.\" Having mentally originated this atrocious sentiment, madame set herself to pay much flattering attention to the capitaine, in order to dissipate the glumness and the spasmodic restlessness which were becoming ominously visible in the worthy officer ; at the same time she kept a sharp eye on her two troublesome young people, and did not permit them to stray a couple of yards from her till she had them again safe in the oblivion of the crowd at the station. But madame, sagacious and not to be surprised and put out as she was, did open her eyes when M. Hyacinthe in the course of their little journey to Paris, with deliberate assurance and desperate earnestness asked permission to visit at the entresol above the shop in the Rue des Magasins. He accompanied his request by so pointed' a reference to Mdlle. Lorlotte's then favouring it with her presence, and to his vehement desire for the honour and the delight of a prosecution of their acquaintance thus auspiciously begun, with the countenance of her friends, that, however hasty and iH-timed, it was from a French man, little short of a proposal of marriage to Lorlotte. And that heroine, whether from being so much in request, whether from believing that her rash little heart had been won in a flash to hang on madame's answer, blushed and trembled in her corner of the carriage, and waited breathlessly for the sovereign decree of open or closed doors. It was quite on the cards that madame might have civilly or haughtily declined M. Hyacinthe's overture. She might have said plainly, or hinted with high-flown but quite comprehensible ambiguity, that the ground had been already walked over, and that, besides, M. Hyacinthe was too fast in his approach. He ought to have been pro vided with credentials from his relations expressing their approval, and informing her what they intended to do for their son, or nephew, or even their favourite protege, with statements of his present funds and future prospects, with sure pledges that he was ready to relinquish his bachelor habits, reform, and be a steady family man, before he crossed"], [359, "LORLOTTE AND THE CAPITAINE. 347 her doorstep with an eye to her kinswoman \u2014 the ci-devant teacher Lorlotte. Ah ! but madame was wise, and she was only baffled, not beaten, as the last step would have confessed her to be. She said to herself, \" If M. Hyacinthe has fallen so madly in love with Lorlotte, Hke Abelard and Heloise, in one day, as to shoot himself, or propose for her hand on the spot, no prohibition of mine would restrain a clever, imprudent, extravagant young fellow, and the child, with her loose English notions, might be decoyed and dragged to ruin. I consent and I receive him, and have the two players under my forefinger, and see their cards, as I like to do when I mean to win the game. And I explain everything and keep the peace with my capitaine ; he is not English, but he is a modern Bayard, ' sans peur et sans reproche.' I tell him so, and that it is neither honest nor honourable not to give the girl a choice ; that he, a brave soldier, can not object to an antagonist. It would be no compliment to Lorlotte if there were none. And I shall take care that there is a fair field for both. But I cannot divine it. I have always heard that M. Hyacinthe was poor ; I have always understood that he had brains. If Lorlotte had been her cousin Agathe, with thousands in place of hun dreds of francs for her dowry, to sweep away his debts and to pay a premium for a business or a journal to him, the whole affair would have been clear ; but as it is, I declare I shall have to borrow spectacles to see to the end of the affair.\" It is sufficient to write that madame did as she said, and within three days the whole quarter of the Duponts \u2014 all the houses and their occupants, from the comparative aristocrats on the ground floors to the mechanics and workwomen in the garrets \u2014 were ready to explode with the strange story of the mad romantic attachment of M. Hyacinthe Masses, in contention with the persevering ardour and noble neutrality of the capitaine. M. Hya cinthe's folly excited the greatest sensation. True, he was. to a certain extent a stranger among them, having come up, like other students, from the provinces, an utter stranger, to his lodging in his quarter two years before ; and he might, for all that the little world knew, be a prinee in disguise, who could afford to make a love marriage with"], [360, "348 A FRENCH HONETSUCKLE. a Cinderella of a pretty, all but penniless young teacher from Boulogne. But disinterested love matrimonial, even felt by princes in disguise, was a marvel in that surging, sparkling, calculating, low-minded, kindly Parisian Hfe. CHAPTER III. M. HYACINTHE A TRAITOR. Lorlotte was in the seventh heaven : she adored her young handsome literary Bohemian lover \u2014 adored him with the silly, ignorant hankering after forbidden fruit \u2014 all the more for what she could fancy had been his Bohe mianism ; adored him most of all for the sacrifice which she was persuaded he was willing to make for her sake. It was a girl's first love in all its hair-brained enthusiasm and fanaticism. Lorlotte viewed M. Hyacinthe's somewhat haggard and sallow young face as the face, not merely of an Adonis and an Apollo, but of a hero \u2014 a saint to be, one day, in spite of his license and hardly veiled infidelity. She prized his languors, his distrait fits, \u2014 even his slight but not uncandid revelations of perversity, cynicism, and tyranny, which madame was careful to point out to her and compare with another lover's unreserved homage, gen tleness, generous concessions, and lavish silent compliments. Lorlotte was so entranced, so besotted, so beside herself, that it was a wonder that she did not suspect she was in a raging fever, a delirious dream, and dread the awakening ; \u2014 that she could credit that such bliss could last in a world of care. In the mean time, M. Hyacinthe did what he could to maintain the delusion by his unmistakable suit, his handsome face and his tongue winning in its very caprice and tragic ads. And, alas ! the poor capitaine did what he could to enable the enemy to scale the fortress, not only by being unable in his old-fashioned tactics to do more than bristle up beside his lady-love, grin Hke a ghastly opposing bastion in her face, and bombard her like a performer at the carnival with a shower of flowers, so costly and exotic in their specimens as to dip him deep in his next instalment"], [361, "349 LORLOTTE AND THE CAPITAINE. of pay, and the incessant fall of which grew monotonous and wearisome to a girl who loved flowers after all twenty times less than the moustache grise loved them. He allowed M. Hyacinthe \u2014 more in mischief than iu malice \u2014 to put him into one of his towering passions by vilifying the Zouaves and impugning the tactics of the great emperor. The capitaine was provoked to splutter and sacre, stamp up and down in his boots, rattle his sword, and wax purple in the face. So great was the uproar that madame stood up, large, raw-boned and threatening, and looked as if sho would have seized the poker had her stove furnished her with such a weapon ; M. Dupont sprang nimbly behind a cup board-door, M. Hyacinthe desisted from drawing his fingers through his hair, and looked not gay, or melancholy, or defiant, as he was apt to do, but astounded. As for Lorlotte, she uttered a gasping cry of terror lest the capitaine should draw cold steel on Hyacinthe, and then fall down, convulsed and foaming, in a fit at her feet. But the capitaine only stormed out of the company, and returned next day, self-condemned and shamed, with the ashes of penitence not the less thick on his grizzled head that he held it bolt upright in its military collar. Madame was not conquered. She was not come to the last of her resources. She acquainted herself with some particulars in M. Hyacintho's student's life, and taking advantage of her afternoon's snatch of womanly retirement and needlework in her salon tete-a-tete with Lorlotte, con veyed the gossip to the girl listening with greedy ears, and not foreseeing the consequences. M. Hyacinthe had lodged for years in a house which had a grenier occupied by a young couturiere. She was a good girl, but she was an orphan, and, although her parents had been alive, she belonged to a class which had not etiquette (Madame made this explanation speaking de haut en bas with perfect sincerity.) M. Hyacinthe made the acquaint ance of his fellow-lodger \u2014 the young couturiere ; he became on friendly terms with her ; he showed her petits soins ; he escorted her on fete days to public places \u2014 such as Mont morenci. There had even been a report that he was going to throw up all his prospects and marry her. But M. Hyacinthe had not been so far lost to himself or to his friends. He had altered all that ; he had taken another"], [362, "350 A FRENCH HONETSUCKLE. lodging ; he was going to marry in his own rank of life ; still he had not given up the girl. \" You slander him to me, madame, who will beHeve in him ! What do such words signify ? \" exclaimed Lorlotte, in a grand, vague triumph of faith. \" To see is to believe with the greatest infidel ; is it not so, Lorlotte ? I work no miracle, but I can convince you. He has not parted from the grisette to this day. That young man has a heart somewhere,\" declared madame, \u2014 forced to do so by clear, impartial instinct, \u2014 \" though [not for you. No, I cannot tell what he means by paying his addresses to you ; I am lost there,\" continued madame, frankly, staring into vacancy, and shaking her yellow rose in a state of prostration at being puzzled. \"All the same he goes to see the grisette in her lodging near St. Denis. He takes her out for a turn on the nearest boulevard, when he is gone from us, or before he comes to us, when he is certain that wo are out of the way. He will be there to-night within this hour, since Notre Dame has struck five. If you like, I'll give up the shop to the shopmen and women, and I'll make believe to stay at home to receive and entertain the capitaine. Ah, there is a valiant and true heart for you, naughty girl ; without a thought for so much as a vivandicre, save as a sister, since he quitted his mother's side. But are you brave and honest, Lor lotte ? You doubt my information ; will you come with me, and see and believe ? \" \" I will come to prove that the words which you have repeated are false, madame. You ought to be undeceived ; you are too true a woman, you have been too good to me,\" \u2014 with a quick, quivering, girlish sob in the middle of her fiery heroics, \u2014 \" to act as a spy and a scandal-monger.\" Madame did not stay even to shrug her shoulders, but went promptly to procure shawls and bonnets, \u2014 plain shrouding shawls and bonnets, such as were worn in general by poorer tradeswomen out on errands, \u2014 with a thick veil for Lorlotte, and took the girl on her arm, but neither drooping nor clutching at her support, to the boulevard. There, at the gayest hour of gay spring Paris, \u2014 when the world is out on evening airings and diversions, \u2014 when the air is balmy, not with cigars alone, but full of thc"], [363, "351 LORLOTTE AND THE CAPITAINE. 'bitter sweetness, the lusciousness, and the langour of tho scent of sheaves of late wallflower, hyacinths, narcissuses, contesting the field of the air with the fresher, more delicate, and honeyed fragrance of early blushing roses on budding rose-trees, and blossoming over boxes of lioht \u2022green feathery mignonette, \u2014 at the season when the bril liant boulevards form the most brilliant mosaic of gorgeous shops and tender green leaves, among the well-pleased loungers and animated domino players, madame and Lorlotte passed. With a great start, as if her heart had given a mighty throb, from Lorlotte, \u2014 and even a little thrill from the calm, philanthropic heart of madame, \u2014 \u2022the two watchers descried the couple whom they sought a few yards before them on the qeuiter side of the way, beside the railings. These two were strolling apart, and engrossed as if they were the only pair in the thronged world. The tall figure of the man was bending down to the woman, whose little band-box he was carrying openly, almost ostentatiously, and he was occasionally touching her shoulder with his disengaged hand familiarly and caressingly. The woman was walking close to him for protection from the carriages which drove close by, and from other assailants, and was reaching up to him to hear and answer his continued speech. There was no mistaking M. Hyacinthe's step, air, profile ; and the woman with him was in a grisette's working dress, with her cap, neckerchief, and apron, clean, but not smart ; she had a face which might have been pretty when it was round and dimpled, but which had no more attraction now than the pitiful interest of the con- trast between its youthfulness and its thinness. It was no older a face yet than Lorlotte's ; and its eyes still retained the arch habit of continually lifting up and letting fall their glances, though it remained no more than a mechani- cal trick of the eyelids, red and swollen. After the first terrible throb of Lorlotte's heart, which madame both saw and felt, and which frightened her a little, lest the girl should become ill, have to be carried into a shop, and cause an esclandre, Lorlotte turned of her own accord and walked home so fast that madame had difficulty in keeping up with her. When they reached the shop in the Rue des Magasins, Lorlotte took no notice of"], [364, "352 A FRENCH nONETSUCKLE. M. Dupont, who was in the confidence of madame, and. had prepared an extravagant pantomime of sympathy. She made no inquiry after the capitaine, but proceeded straight to her little bed-room, locked herself in, and remained deaf and dumb to all invitations to join the family at supper, and all requests to see whether she was ailing, or what comfort of chocolate or coffee with milk she could receive under the circumstances. It was chddish behaviour, and madame left the offend ing child to herself, notwithstanding monsieur's horrified insinuations that Lorlotte might have a chafing dish and charcoal in her private possession, or that she might steal out in the course of the evening, before the doors were locked, and have recourse to the Seine. Think of the little man's utter discomfiture and strange misery d he should be called upon to go to the Morgue and identify the drowned draggled body of the wayward little cousin, instead of filling the office of young father in giving her away to a husband old enough to be her father \u2014 the trusty capitaine. But for that matter, all who liked to go with \" the steps of a fox,\" and listen outside Lorlotte's chamber door, could assure themselves quietly of the baselessness of the charcoal and the Seine visions by the muffled sounds of the impulsive sobs and simple wads with which the Gallic nature of the girl asserted itself. Madame considered that she had administered to Lorlotte bitter medicine, which could not be swallowed without a grimace, but which would begin very soon \u2014 next morning, perhaps \u2014 to work its cure. Madame was once more mistaken. In the marrying of Lorlotte she had to endure not one alone, but a series of surprises and checks. Lorlotte came down to the second breakfast with shining eyes and flaming cheeks, and announced to madame, as soon as monsieur had strutted out on his daily round of enjoyments, that M. Hyacinthe was the victim of a wicked conspiracy \u2014 that she, Lorlotte, was sure of it. He was the prey of an intriguante, a monster of iniquity, seeking to lure him to his destruction. Of course she, Lorlotte, would no more give him up than she would surrender without a thought of saving him, a friend who was slip ping within the bars of a cage to encounter the claws and the teeth of the fiercest tigress in the Jardin des Plantes,"], [365, "LORLOTTE AND THE CAPITAINE. 353 or who was crossing a threshold to meet the scorching air and crushing beams of a house on fire. Madame had a little qualm that Lorlotte's flights were getting beyond parallel, except in the cells in Bicetre ; but she bethought herself of the unlucky Enghsh association and mania, and condescended to remonstrate. \" M. Hya cinthe is not a Httle boy ; he is five-and-twenty, and has seen the world.\" \" Some men are never spoilt by worldly wisdom, are always guileless enough to be deceived, especially by a woman. Madame has heard his beautdul sentiments.\" Madame slightly raised her straight, thick eyebrows, and sniffed with her powerful nose. \"Yes, heard and forgotten. I do not give a sniff of eau-de-cologne for beautiful sentiments ; they are like the essence of the flowers, here this moment, gone the next \u2014 except musk, and that is not made of flowers, but of rats' tails and of the debris of great fishes ; and it is vulgar, bourgeoise, I suppose, like plain vdtues and menages. But, Lorlotte, one ought not to be unjust and cruel, even to a hated rival, a poor unhappy young girl. Did I not tell you that M. Hyacinthe's Mimie is a good girl ? that he has had the thought of marrying her ? There has never been a whisper against her, except for letting him follow her. Mimie is younger than M. Hyacinthe, ma foi! as young as you. It is she who is misled, by the bold, clever, scoffing, sentimentalizing young man, according to all the laws of nature and reason. Besides, it is certain, and you are a fool d you cannot see it, that he would have no difficulty in parting from her if she had not been good as wed as faithful to him ; he would not be torn in two and tor tured as you see he is, no, nor so grossly imprudent, d they had not loved each other truly, and if he had found any hole, however smad, in her conduct, out of which he could have cast in a heap his old regard, kindness, and constancy.\" \"It is not true,\" persisted Lorlotte, had sullenly, had passionately. \" There is some great mistake. Why does he come to me if it is so ? He can make no horrible, sordid mariage de convenance with me, as you would have me make with your stupid, raging old man, \u2014 your kins man, the capitaine. M. Hyacinthe loves me, \u2014 poor, 2 A"], [366, "354 A FRENCH HONEYSUCKLE. obscure, ignorant, silly gdl that I am; and he is mine, a moi, my beautiful, gifted, noble young lover. Ordinary minds cannot understand him, but I can understand him. I stand by him, he has not trusted me in vain.\" \" Truly, mademoiselle, you had better be sure whom you trust,\" commented madame, with a sneer. \" I pass over that you are disobedient, insolent, and ungrateful \u2014 I say nothing of it ; but I remind you, though M. Hyacinthe has asked permission to visit here while you are with us, he does not advance in his suit. Ma foi, there may be double treachery.\" The warning only drove Lorlotte wild. \" You insult me, madame ; you insult both him and me. I believe that you too are in a conspdacy against us ; but I wdl not give him up for anything you have told me, nor for the little that I have seen. He cannot care for that Mimie \u2014 that girl of the people \u2014 as he cares for me. What could she ever be to him ? What could she do for him ? I tell you that he would not care for her at all d he knew how I love him.\" \"Lorlotte, you are a mad, wicked girl,\" madame con tinued, her eyes looming large and grim as she pronounced the sentence, \" to talk of loving a man who is not your husband, not eveu your fiance. You are not worthy of my cousin the capitaine, and I shall have nothing more to do with you to get disgraced by you. If you do not repent and submit to your superiors like a modest girl, I send you back in eight little days, my outrageous made moiselle, to Boulogne, to your school dormitories and your livres de version. I refuse on principle ever to see your kitten's face again.\" \" Very well, madame ; I go back to Boulogne in a moment, and you and I bid each other an eternal adieu,\" assented Lorlotte as proud as a countess who had a chateau and a provincial court to go to. And had she not Hya cinthe, her student, and his garret-lodging and Spartan fare to share ? Was not that better than all the chateaux in and out of Spain, and aU the courts in the holy Roman Empire ? So a matrimonial scheme of madame's was for the first time in her experience to fall ignominiously to the ground, its wreck damaging in place of benefiting its subject. But"], [367, "355 LORLOTTE AND THE CAPITAINE. madame had a week to come and go upon, and there was stiU the chapter of accidents. She found herself compelled, however, to break to the capitaine what remained to be broken to him of the fact that the peaceful home and the blessed family Hfe which had been in store for him, were fading and crumbling away before the levity and obstinacy of a girl, an orphan teacher in a school. The intimation did not put the capitaine in one of his rages \u2014 it was trifling contradictions which overcame him in that disagreeable manner. He bore great misfortunes like a man, like a good man, meekly as well as mournfully. The capitaine even interposed and interceded for the incor rigible culprit Lorlotte. He alleged that, since he had consented to allow an open field and to do battle with an other combatant, for his bride, he, the vanquished man, must conform to the rules of civilized warfare, and surrender and withdraw his claim, without complaint or molestation either of the victor or of the prize he had won. During the days that Lorlotte stood at bay after the glaring impropriety of her resistance to circumstances and madame, the capitaine not only did not reproach her and urge her, but was so studiously and wistfully polite to her, that the rigidity of his bearing took a specially tender inclination towards her ; which, though she wilfully misnamed it hypocritical assumption, and of a piece with the stratagem that was to have married her off-hand to the elderly, thrift less, turbulent-tempered soldier, unconsciously soothed her wounded spirit and tempted the troubled aggrieved gdl to fly for refuge to the honour and humanity of her natural enemy. Madame's hawk's eyes detected and darted on tho single favourable symptoms. \" I do not give it up yet. I do not forbid the patterns of the trousseau. My capitaine has not departed from Fon tainebleau. My cat of a mademoiselle is not packed off to Boulogne again. Perhaps \u2014 who knows ? \u2014 I may shrug my shoulders at the whole set when Denis does not go to Algerie after aU.\""], [368, "356 A FRENCH HONETSUCKLE. CHAPTER IV. LORLOTTE MAD, THE CAPITAINE HER KEEPER. There was a crisis at the door more imminent and conclu sive than madame could have hoped for. In that merry month of May, so fertile in revolutions in Paris, M. Hyacinthe suddenly vanished from the entresol in the Rue des Magasins to the last hair of his beard, and made no sign at the very moment when Lorlotte was in tribula tion because of him, and when as a preux chevalier he should have stood by her to death and marriage. For three whole days M. Hyacinthe did not show himself at the Duponts', and did not send explanation or apology. He was no longer visible in the streets or the gardens ; was no longer to be heard of as seen or spoken to in any company. Jt looked as if he had dissolved in thin air, and become impalpable as any ghost, ancient or modern. Madame vouchsafed no remark on the secession from her society ; but there was a repressed gleam in her eyes which told its tale. Monsieur chattered his wonder, called him self back, and swallowed his words a dozen times a day. Lorlotte was staggered, stunned, scared ; but she would not be affronted. She stared at madame as if she would look her through and through. Had she done this thing ? But no ; madame was honest in her bluntness, downright ness, and imperiousness, and madame's face was that of an innocent ignorant woman. Lorlotte was looking out of one of the windows of madame's salon which had a back view, somewhat of a Savoyard's view of roofs and chimneys ; but the window also commanded an ancient grand house in a court, long abandoned by the quality, and used as a warehouse. Desolation reigned in the old court and garden ; bent, withered, moss-grown trees, which no summer would make young again, plants falling from the walls, and tiger-cats watching Jean Jacques' sparrows, were all the life to be seen there. The profound forlornness and decay of the hotel contrasted with the bourgeoise glitter and lacquer of madame's salon, and something in the contrast made"], [369, "357 LORLOTTE AND THE CAPITAINE. Lorlotte clench her small hands and whisper to the capi taine to speak with her in the window. \"Will you see what has come to him ? There is only you who has still any regard for me, and that I can ask to serve me ; if yon refuse, I must find some other mes senger.\" He did not refuse ; his brick-red colour rose to the roots of his close-clipped grizzled hair, but he saluted her with his hand to his forehead, accepted her commission in had military phrase, \u2014 \"Yes, my mademoiselle, without fail,\" \u2014 and went away on the instant. He came back in the evening much hotter than could be accounted for from his march in double quick time to and from M. Hyacinthe's lodgings. He was perturbed, dis tressed. He knew that he was going to hurt, shame, and break the heart of the little girl who had been proposed to him as his wife. It would be saying little to assert that the capitaine would rather have marched up to the cannon's mouth, for he had seen smoke with the stern joy of a brave man and of a born soldier ; he would sooner have retreated, with borne down colours and trailing pikes, before the foe. But mademoiselle had elected him to the duty of relieving her devouring anxiety, and he would relieve it, though she would hate'him for ever afterwards. \"Where is M. Hyacinthe?\" demanded Lorlotte, laying aside all her coyness in her bewilderment and apprehension. \" Why is he not here ? Has he been interdicted, insulted ? \" pressed Lorlotte, her questions following each other like successive flashes of lightning, her bright cheeks stained and dyed like poppies, no longer like June roses, but flushed and heavy with passion, her violet eyes distended, and her nostrils quivering. \" M. Hyacinthe is particularly engaged, mademoiselle,\" growled the capitaine, low and slow, and hanging his head in spite of the stiffness of his collar. \" But how ? I wdl know,\" cried Lorlotte, beating her hands together, and stamping her foot. \" Mon Dieu ! he is ill, he is dead.\" \"Oh, not at all, mademoiselle; anything but that,\" exclaimed the capitaine, blowing his nose sonorously. \" Did he not bid you tell me, then ? \" \" I did not wait for his bidding. I am afraid that he"], [370, "358 A FRENCH HONETSUCKLE. was too much occupied to think of it ; but I said I should inform you that \u2014 that M. Hyacinthe Masses was married at noon this day at the bureau of the district mayor, and immediately afterwards at the nearest church \u2014 for Made moiselle Mimie is a good Catholic \u2014 to Mademoiselle Mimie Vdien, late sewing-girl at an outfit shop in some quarter or other \u2014 tete bleu ! I forget the name,\" blustered the capitaine, in a clumsy effort to conceal his consciousness. \"You are like the rest,\" cried the poor girl, turning upon him with blind, random blows of her tongue, in her agony resisting and fighting to the last. \" You are hired to deceive and betray me.\" \" My mademoiselle, hear me,\" he pleaded. He did not heed her ingratitude and recklessness, he could no more have been incensed by her words than he could have been enraged by a poor dog which had licked his hand an hour before, but was now snapping at him as he strove to pluck a knife from its side. He was only eager to disabuse her, to open her eyes, though she might be shocked, driven to despair. \" M. Hyacinthe was arrested for debt in bed on the morning of the 17th, three days ago. He has been in prison ever since till this morning. He knew what was coming, and, pardon me, mademoiselle, he sought to save himself with your fortune. He thought that it was thou sands, not hundreds. M. Dupont made a mistake in stating the number the day he brought him to the railway-station, when he proposed to accompany you to Montmorenci, and M. Hyacinthe had heard a rumour of Mademoiselle Agathe's dot, and stranger as he was, confused the relations.\" Lorlotte was subdued now ; she was shrinking down and hiding ber face with her hands. \" Treacherous,\" she muttered bitterly, \"from first to last.\" But the capitaine, though his heart bled for her, did not know what it was to leave a tale unfinished, or to kick a man with his back at the wall, and to trample on the fallen. \"M. Hyacinthe was a desperate man,\" he continued, \"and M. Hyacinthe is arrested \u2014 the 17th, as I said \u2014 and is taken away without any noise. It goes without saying that he desires to keep the mystery as quiet as possible, and to pass off the officers in plain clothes as friends from the country, as we all do, mademoiselle ; but the quieter he"], [371, "359 LORLOTTE AND THE CAPITAINE. keeps it, the longer he is likely to be of getting his release. Now, what does that brave girl Mimie do ? \" went on the capitaine, warming with his subject, and forgetting for a moment the interest of his auditor. \" She is acquainted with the accident ; she gives up work, food, rest, every thing, for the next three days and nights. The faithful girl flies about \u2014 doing it by stealth, keeping his secret all the time \u2014 you comprehend ? \u2014 to all the journal offices that owe money to M. Hyacinthe, and to all the friends who have borrowed of him, and must pay him before his day of reckoning. She adds her Httle store to it ; she has a sale of the small effects in her garret, and adds that also, till she makes up the requisite sum, and has out her friend, a free man again, in triumph this morning : onlv there is nothing but bare walls to go to, for his creditors have taken away his bed, his chairs. It is to her equal, more than equal ; she has not even bare walls to go to, and she may beg in the streets, because she has been dismissed by her employers for him.\" \" Stop there, monsieur the capitaine,\" commanded Lor lotte, putting down her hands, and looking at the speaker with a white, contracted face. \" She has done all for him. He would have been a brute if he had not done what he could for her in return. Ah ! she has the best right to him ; and she may take him,\" added Lorlotte, with a hysterical laugh, passing swift as an arrow-flight to the painful process called trying to \" pluck up a spirit.\" \" Much good may he do her.\" The capitaine did not admire and applaud the process ; he rebuked it in the simple gravity and persistence with which he pursued his narrative and gave its sequel. \" They are sitting hand in hand within the bare walls, she is fainting on his breast with hunger and with the bliss of being his wife. He is feeding her with the only crust and drop of wine that he can procure, and crying over her, and vowing to cherish her and live for her. fie begs you to forgive and forget him utterly ; and you forgive the poor young fools. You bless, not curse them, mon enfant,\" implored the capitaine. But Lorlotte broke away from him with a wild \" Moi! I have nothing to forgive and forget. But there is one person to whom I owe something. I shall not forget you,"], [372, "360 A FRENCH HONETSUCKLE. my capitaine. I care for you.\" A perverse, regardless, unblushing speech, but one which caused the capitaine's brain to reel as if a mine had been sprung beneath it. Lorlotte did not fall id on the demolition of her romance, she was of too healthy a nature. Neither did she run away back to Boulogne to escape lectures, blame, condo lence, and fresh schemes for her establishment. She was too matter-of-fact, in spite of her spice of romance and her rebellious adventure, and too dependent. She accepted the situation, and lived on in the Rue des Magasins, though she was listless and heartsick to begin with. She did not care what became of her, and who talked of or to her. It was nothing to her that the capitaine had not suspended his visits to the entresol, when he was off duty, for a single day, or intermitted a single bouquet ; and that madame was as pointed as ever in presenting Lorlotte with the largest and the choicest of the flowers. But what will the world think when it is informed that in about seven days Lorlotte began to recover a little from her mortal malady of a broken heart ? Before condemn ing Lorlotte for fickleness and levity, reflect that she had only known M. Hyacinthe for a wonderful fortnight ; now the girl's heart which is broken by the startling, sad, and mortifying end of even the rapture of a fortnight, must be fragile indeed. Lorlotte's heart was made of stouter stuff. In seven more days of judicious neglect from madame, inconsequent mercurialism from monsieur, and old-world loyalty of homage from the capitaine, seven more days of May and of Paris, Lorlotte arrived at looking up and looking about her again, at shaking out her flowing muslin skirts, and twdling her waves of glossy hair, at lingering over the arrangement of the capitaine's great stars of Cape jessa mine, coral fuchsias, and moss rosebuds, even at being guilty of something like delight when the capitaine brought the ladies the family tickets for a popular vaude ville. Lorlotte was but a bigger child, and a French child ; she had rejected monsieur's sugar almonds, but she grasped at the vaudeville, though she recollected herself in time to relapse the next moment into the gloom befitting the blighted heroine of a tragedy. The wounds of the young heal fast ; but the month of"], [373, "361 LORLOTTE AND THE CAPITAINE. May was ending as fast as Lorlotte's mourning for her short-lived dream ; and so was the term of the capitaine's regiment's sojourn at Fontainebleau. Before Lorlotte had time to think of it, the capitaine, looking graver and gaunter than usual, approached her where she sat among madame's flowers in the background of the salon, while madame played propriety, stitched, and went through the part of consulting M. Dupont on domestic affairs in the foreground, and thus addressed her, \u2014 \" I have come to take my leave, my good mademoiselle. We have the route in twenty-four hours, and I shall be very busy in the interval.\" Lorlotte looked up, taken by surprise. She was forced to stand aghast and feel forlorn, seeing not the capitaine gone alone, but her holidays gone, and herself back at Boulogne, presiding over the milk-soup in the refectory, and setting copies in the school-room, teased by the little girls, snubbed by some of the big girls, without the old light heart to keep her own among them. The realization supplied her with becoming sympathy for the capitaine's position. Tears gathered quickly, and dimmed the bright- ness of the violet eyes, and the corners of the mouth dropped disconsolately. \" I am very sorry, M. le Capitaine, I am going to lose one who has been my friend.\" She said it with breaks, and oh, with such a long, deep, flutter* ing sigh from the bottom of her girlish heart. \"Mademoiselle has many friends,\" suggested the capi- taine, pulling his wiry, straight moustache a la Empereur. \"I do not know that,\" replied Lorlotte, briskly and naively. \" I have offended madame beyond redemption, and I dare say I shall offend my Boulogne friends too. These strong, self-restrained English, when they find that I have grown cross and wretched, and subject to migraine (I know I shall slap and shake the little ones, and have hysteria), will preach to me, and doctor me every hour of the day, and when they find it does not answer, I shall per- haps be turned off Hke that silly girl Mimie. Oh, it will be triste, horrible,\" ended Lorlotte, letting her head fall as low as her arms, for she had not intended to say so much, and she would fain stay before they were seen \u2014 those tears which had broken all bounds, and were dropping in a heavy shower on her lap."], [374, "362 A FRENCH HONETSUCKLE. \" Mademoiselle Lorlotte, promise to tell me \u2014 to send me word directly,\" stammered the capitaine. She shook her head, smding faintly like the sun through a shower. \" I wish that I had no more than M. Hyacinthe's years, or had not been a foolish old spendthrift, but had saved my pay. I would that I were anything save a brawling dog whose bark is worse than his bite, maybe, but who disturbs the quarter with his growling all the same,\" regretted the capitaine idly. Lorlotte stopped crying on the instant, and looked up with tears like dewdrops hanging on her cheeks, and with her lips Hke the cleft cherry parted in breathless expecta tion, so that he could not choose but finish his speech. \" For then I might have been able to protect and pet my little darling.\" \" Do you mean it, my capitaine ? \" cried Lorlotte with a quaver in the clear treble of her voice. \" Without doubt, mademoiselle.\" The old soldier con firmed his words, much struck by his own boldness. \"Ah! I am so glad \u2014 so grateful I would say,\" explained Lorlotte, nodding and flushing violently at the indiscreet slip of her nimble tongue. \" I was not so ungrateful as people thought, when you were so noble even to sinners, and bore with me and pitied me in the punishment of my naughtiness. I am tired of the young people, and of the communion of sentiment ; I shall have nothing more to say to them. I want only a brave, kind man, whom I can reverence and be fond of, to take good care of me, and I shall take good care of him and his menage, if he wiU let me. As for his rages, I have no fear of them when I know that though he would think nothing of shooting a Russian or stabbing an Austrian when it was necessary, he would not willingly harm a fly ; and as for unwillingly, if he is to go mad and hurt anybody when he does not intend it,\" concluded Lorlotte with the utmost gravity, \" say, is it not fitter that he should hurt his own wife, who will understand it and take it in good part, than a stranger, who might say that he did it on purpose ? \" So madame mounted the breach at last a conqueror, and the capitaine did not march to Algedie.

(PRINCE PAUL'S BETROTHAL.) CHAPTER I. THE FATHERLAND'S DEMAND. Kurzheim was a tiny Principality, but it does not seem that its natives were less alive to its excellences, and less devoted to its interests, on account of its small size. Statesmancraft, manufactures, and arts \u2014 all had a certain rural simplicity about them in the midst of great excel lence ; for it need hardly be said that every Kurzheimer was born an advanced politician, cunning trader, and enthusiastic, transcendental musician, poet, or painter. The duchy next to Kurzheim was Grossheim. Gross heim, as its name indicated, was twice as large as Kurz heim, which was not saying much after all ; but Grossheim's size and strength were aggravating and alarming to the soul of Kurzheim. Like many near neighbours, the two \" heims \" were at bitter, dogged feud. It was the pet panic of Kurzheim that Grossheim was constantly enter taining designs to efface the little lozenge of a Principality from the map of Germany, and its name from among the names of nations. The Kurzheimer had strong patriotism and an equally \u2014 no matter however contradictory \u2014 strong attachment to his Grand Ducal family. The last institution was so near him, and he saw so much of it, that it became in a measure his own family. He was as proud of the young"], [380, "368 A BALSAM, Princess Pauline's personal charms, and had as great a twinge of anxiety when she had the shght touch of lame ness in the left knee, and was sent to the nearest Princi pality which supplied baths, from which she returned triumphantly cured \u2014 as d she had been his own daughter Magda or Lotchen. Everything about Kurzheim seemed a slice of a greater thing. The country proper presented a portion of poorish corn and pasture land, with specimens of country-houses and cottages, and a larger portion of forest. The capital looked like a long linden-shaded street or two, abstracted from another German town, and containing bits of what ever is essential to a town and capital \u2014 bits of councillors' courts, of pastors' churches, of carefully kept, cheerfuUy frequented God's acres, of boys' and girls' gymnasiums, of regimental barracks. Kurzheim was not so fortunate or unfortunate as to be on a track beaten by travellers, or to possess lively histori cal and literary interest, except for its natives. It did not offer attractions of scenery beyond what never palled upon its own people, and had even been known to win upon a few easily pleased and crotchety foreigners ; in the lightness and freshness \u2014 in the very absence of fatness \u2014 of its gaily flower-studded, short and thin grass, wheat and rye, con trasting with the cool shady depths of its forest. The heart of Kurzheim was its palace. In that minia ture square building, enthusiastically sentinelled, royalty reigned \u2014 not only in its lower elements of pettiest bed chamber cabals and tambour squabbles, but in its higher element of heroism. Royalty played its part as royally in the little palace of Kurzheim, with as unwavering a con sciousness, as lofty a sense of responsibility and obhgation, and as patient and faithful a self-abnegation, as ever in Windsor or the Tuilcries. Whatever of change, be it glad or sad, common or uncommon, befell the Grand Ducal family in the palace, their humbler brethren and children of the surrounding: barracks, bureaux; shops \u2014 not to speak of the rural popu lation \u2014 looked on at dutifully and affectionately, with absorbing interest and keenest sympathy. To begin with, there had been a worshipful company in the palace. There was his Serene Highness the Grand"], [381, "THE FATHERLAND'S DEMAND. 369 Duke, already ageing and infirm, and after seeing out two Grand Duchesses, capable of doing little beyond assenting to and setting his seal to the proposals of his ministers, and going out to hunt on a fine day. There were the Grand Duke's son by his first Grand Duchess, the Hereditary Grand Duke Karl, an ailing man, in middle Hfe, whom no baths could cure, no anxious inquiries find better, and his Grand Duchess Karl, rather a bouncing young Princess, whom he had married in haste the other year, as a provision against dying without heirs. There was also the Princess Pauline, the child of the Grand Duke's old age and of his second Grand Duchess, in the dewy bloom and brightness of eighteen summers. This was all the Kurzheim royal family, strictly speak ing ; but there was an outlying Prince Paul, an open hearted, pleasant, comely young prince, of some three or four and twenty years, in the early flower of his age, as Princess Pauline was in the early flower of hers. He was the chief representative of a family of royal cousins that had, time immemorial with Kurzheim mankind, been an offshoot of the Grand Ducal family, and inhabited, in the person of their head, with dignity and enjoyment, unim paired by thed being maintained on the minimum of State allowances, the rural shooting-lodge of Distelhof in the Kurzheim forest. The Prince Paul branch of the house existed as a kindred reserve and stop-gap, a sort of wind ing- up-and-coda of the Grand Ducal family. One of the Prince Pauls' useful offices had been to provide respectably royal husbands for such of the Grand Ducal princesses as had not attained those appendages in more independent and powerful quarters. But the heads of the Grand Ducal house were too honourable to be simply exacting in their relationship. Every now and then a budding, blushing young princess, an only daughter and heiress, was deliberately and by express choice assigned, with her dowry, to gladden the heart and replenish the ex chequer of a Prince Paul. The present Princess Pauline and Prince Paul had been so well fitted for each other in more than name, and the old Grand Duke had been so fain to keep his daughter as near him as Distelhof, that he had, while he was still a man of some decision, arranged that alliance. 2 B"], [382, "370 A BALSAM. The announcement had been received with the usual cordial concurrence of the Kurzheimers in what was bene ficial for and agreeable to their Grand Ducal family. Thenceforth, not only the matronly and maidenly gossips, the sentimental boys and gdls, and the poets whose profes sion was sentiment, but the most serious statesman, and the most solid and stolid burgher, took the greatest delight in contemplating the lovers. These enraptured spectators applauded to the skies the pretty sight which the couple made when they publicly drove, rode (Princess Pauline was not, from etiquette, aUowed much walking), or danced together, and arranged, more completely than the light hearted pair themselves had done, the corbeille of Princess Line, as the motherly folk loved to call her in her youth, and the household and housekeeping of Prince and Princess Paul. Then, just when the ceremony of betrothal was settled and about to take place, a new and earnestly longed-for event came to pass, which usurped public attention and rejoicing, and for a time pushed out of notice the much talked of betrothal and marriage even of so favourite a princess as Princess Line. The Hereditary Grand Duchess Karl gave birth to a son and hed. But, alas ! for the security of human and royal fortunes. The most up right, courageous, and skilful of the Court physicians declared sadly a truth which could not be long concealed. From the conformation of the royal child's misshapen head, the little Prince Fritz was surely destined, d he sur vived, to be an idiot. After the first brunt of the national affliction, resignation succeeded to submission, and heart and hope returned. The inevitable ordinary forms of the court, its churching and state-dinner giving, nay, its attendance in the height of stiff dress at the miniature exquisite Kurzheim opera ; its unbroken winter sojourn in its capital, and its summer frank and frugal borrowing of Prince Paul's hunting-lodge, and transplantation thither for a few weeks to enact an idyl in the forest, went on as before. But the betrothal of the Princess and her cousin, which had been put off, continued to be postponed week after week and month after month. The old Grand Duke was depressed and out of sorts. The lovers must wait."], [383, "THE FATHERLAND'S DEMAND. 371 Prince Paul was a little weary and cross with unsatisfied longing and hope deferred, but Princess Line was very good and kind. She would not press and torment her father. She soothed and coaxed Prince Paul back to his normal condition of good-will and good-humour, verging on boisterous hilarity, towards all the world, and of ardent love to his Princess Line. Still the betrothal was deferred ; and now again there was a likelihood that the Kurzheimers' hopes would be accomplished. A brother might be born to Prince Fritz, as vigorous and capable in mind and body as the other was diseased and helpless. But two strokes of destiny arrived simultaneously. The invalid Hereditary Grand Duke Karl died suddenly and unexpectedly at last, previous to the accouchement of his wife ; and when that happened, the second child, sound in brain, wind and limb certainly, was \u2014 only a princess. The double disappointment carried with it the one atone ment that it might have been worse : the Hereditary Grand Duchess Karl's second child might have been a another idiot, as these hapless burdens are apt to recur in families, or it might have been dead born. Yes, the Kurzheimers had something left to be thankful for in the midst of the calamities heavdy showered for the common chastening on the honoured Grand Ducal house ; and being reverent and pious throughout all their heresies, as well as wonderfully cheerful in their tempers, the Kurz heimers accepted their lot, and set themselves speedily to the endeavour of making the best, under Providence, of that lot. The first thing to be thought of was Grossheim. Gross heim would be craftily on the look-out to profit by the losses of Kurzheim. Kurzheim must be equally crafty in order to anticipate and prevent the gain of its mortal enemy. The apprehended march to be stolen on Kurz heim was this : \u2014 Grossheim had a Grand Ducal family as well as Kurzheim, luckier in that it was amply provided with sons and heirs. One of these sons and heirs would, without fail, by force or fraud, whisk in and whip off, so soon as she was grown to marriageable years, the single daughter of the late Hereditary Grand Duke Karl of Kurzheim, and become, on the reigning Grand Duke's"], [384, "372 A BALSAM. death, as the husband of Prince Fritz's sister, his nearest relative and guardian, governing Kurzheim in his name. Thus Kurzheim would be gradually but surely incorpor ated with and made subservient to Grossheim, until the long prepared and deeply-laid plot of the latter was brought about, and the humiliation and demolition of Kurzheim attained. The readiest precaution of wrath and terror was to pro vide another suitor on the spot and at the instant for the baby princess, and to bespeak him for her from the cradle. A cabinet meeting of ministers (some of them still wearing turned-over collars and long hair), assembled. There were open-ad informal gatherings, in knots and clusters, of burghers in dressing-gowns, and peasants from the adjacent districts in steeple-crowned hats. It was discovered that no suitor was to be had on a moment's notice, save Prince Paul. The service was what he of all others was bound to render to the old Grand Duke and to the Principality which was his division of the Fatherland. The urgency of the case cancelled all former contracts, even if Prince Paul and Princess Line had been actuaUy troth-plighted. Prince Paul would be forty-one years of age \u2014 an excellent age for a royal bridegroom \u2014 when the infant in the royal cradle should be a maiden of eighteen. The post of honour and of power assigned to Prince Paul, so desirable to the ambition and so welcome to the patriotism of every true Kurzheimer and German, was sufficient solatium for any present deprivation and injury. The old Grand Duke, who heard the proposal eloquently stated and tabled amidst thunders of applause by a Kurz heim orator, was too much shattered to enter more than a feeble protest in his daughter aud darling's behalf. Besides, the most active feeling which lingered in him beyond his clinging fondness for his child, was his old, stout, chronic hatred, with his equally chronic dread, of Grossheim. He was not able to start any other effectual measure of defence against the formidable foe, and he soon withdrew his languid opposition. No doubt it was hard on Line to have to relinquish her promised husband and home ; but it was also hard on him, the old Grand Duke, who had to call on Line for the relinquishment. The"], [385, "THE FATHERLAND'S DEMAND. 373 Grand Ducal palace, moreover, in the principal, and indeed only gay and spruce, square and market-place of Kurzheim, was infinitely superior to the rough, tumble-down, wooden shooting-lodge of Distelhof, buried in the forest, only bearable in the height of summer, and no longer altogether bearable then, since the increasing chill of age caused the Grand Duke to tremble and fret lest he should experience the now congealing, now burning, finger of ague, bred in those damp glades and among that decaying vegetation. The Grand Duke made little fight for his daughter, and the Cabinet Council's all but unanimous resolution was carried. Prince Paul, in place of being betrothed and married to Princess Line, was ordered to reserve himself for a higher destiny. He was to keep himself single, with the express and announced intention of his becoming, at the earliest desdable period, the husband of the late Here ditary Grand Duke Karl's daughter, that he might become still further the future guardian of Prince Fritz, and the administrator of the weighty laws of the Principality of Kurzheim. Princess Line never dreamed of the turn that her history was taking, or of the strange, pitiless blight which threat- ened her womanhood. She was at ease and peace in her own little suite of rooms in the palace, occupied with the trivial, set list of her duties and pleasures. She was feed- ing her birds, counting the contents of her purse, and thinking of her little purchases and charities, or chatting with the gracious lady who waited on her. She was practising a new Kurzheim song, which she was to sing to Prince Paul, and embroidering a smoking-cap for the same hero. She was breaking off from all these agreeable engagements to visit the Hereditary Grand Duchess Karl, and nurse and praise her sister-in-law's fatherless baby \u2014 to look into the forlorn royal nursery of poor little Prince Fritz, with his lack-lustre eyes and pithless limbs. She was watching and waiting with no guess of what news was coming to her, that she might obey the first summons of the Grand Duke on his return from the tiresome council, and supersede his gentlemen-in-waiting in handing him his gown and slippers, being his cup-bearer and plate holder, and his slow, clear, untiring reader, till the old man dropped asleep."], [386, "374 A BALSAM. Prince Paul was still at Distelhof, for though he had heard the last casualty, the birth of the baby princess, he had not attached the least peculiar and personal interest to it. To tell the truth, it was the height of the shooting season, and at this time of his lde Prince Paul's inclinations and energies tended greatly to the slaughter of pheasants and roe-deer. Prince Paul had not arrived at any ambition for the government of men, to be prosecuted in dark, close rooms, over moth-eaten green tables heaped with musty parch ments, among reverent but heavy and tedious associates, before whom he should have to smother his yawns and hide his restlessness, and who would look distrustfully and reproachfully on his lightest movement. There were no laurels to be won for him there in this stage of his existence, except the dubious ones attendant on his holding his tongue and doing as he was bidden. Too soon lover and mistress, prince and princess, were roused from their false security, and told of their decreed separation, that a trusty, stout bridegroom might be in store for a feeble child not a week old. Princess Line listened with whitening lips and staring eyes, incredulous, refusing, strictly disciplined and naturally docile as she was, to believe her ears for the moment. What ! part her from her own Prince Paul ; for whom she had been brought up, who could not do without her any more than she could do without him \u2014 for what scrapes would he not 'get into with that slight mental dulness of his and his hasty temper \u2014 and she not there to explain everything and calm him down ! Prince Paul, to whom she was all but married ! Had not the betrothal rings at least been bought and fitted on ? No one, not even His Serene Highness her father, need tell her so. Was it uufilial and a great sin in her to suggest that the Grand Duke must be doting? As for the Hereditary Grand Duchess Karl, of course she could not be disturbed or excited, but she had always been a wilful, fanciful woman. Bring forward to rival Princess Line with her single-hearted, warm-hearted Prince Paul, Princess Line's baby niece \u2014 that little, senseless, crumpled, coral-red thing ! why the story was too preposterous for the most stupidly scandalous coffee sisterhood ; and Princess Line laughed a"], [387, "THE FATHERLAND'S DEMAND. 375 high, quavering, scornful laugh, which died away in the low weeping of grief and dismay. Prince Paul came clattering into the town, sending the sparks from the hoofs of his horse, and thundering at the risk of his life over the wooden bridge, across the tributary of the Weder on which Kurzheim was budt, into the palace-yard. He outraged petrified sentinels, sdenced martinets of servants and ladies-in-waiting, and penetrated through the corridors to Princess Line's rooms, to refuse to receive the instructions which had reached him, and in place of consenting, to take his answer, should it prove unfavourable, from her lips \u2014 not to suffer for a second the bewildering sentence of the instant dismissal of his suit to Princess Line and its transfer to a wretched baby. The little German palace rooms were quite homely and very like those of the wealthier councillors, with their grand piano, white porcelain stove, and natural show of myrtles, India-rubber trees and tea-roses. The royal furni ture was somewhat quaint and tarnished, in the shape of old mirrors, gilded tables, velvet couches, and Turkey floor-cloths. There was Princess Line, startled from her untasted coffee and crumbled down roll. Princess Line was sandy haired, like so many of her compatriots, and rather colour less, but of a healthy freshness. She was of the second type of German womanhood. In place of being square built and broad-visaged, she was slender as one of the Kurzheim birch-trees, with a delicately pointed face \u2014 such as one finds in the old traditional portraiture of Madonnas and vdgin saints, and a slightly high aquihne nose. She had an open, peaceful forehead, with modest, reasonable eyes, and a soft, sweet mouth. Her throat was a lovely, round, swelling little throat ; her hands deft, her feet nimble, so far as it was permitted to a princess's hands and feet to be deft and nimble. Princess Line was dressed in the French fashion of a morning. She wore a loose light dressing-gown and a small lace cap on her head. The style suited her meek and maidenly domestic traits. She was not a stately or a bridiant, but she was an intensely feminine woman, whose true kingdom was her home. And there was Prince Paul in his hunting-coat and riding-boots. He was a big, florid, comely young man, not"], [388, "376 A BALSAM. so much sandy as russet haired, who held himself like a prince, and yet lost nothing of the man, and who looked what he was \u2014 vehement, unreasoning, and cordial to the core. \"What farce is this, Line ? \" Prince Paul cried, bursting in through aU etiquette, where his mistress and cousin was going through the form of eating her breakfast, and causing the lady-in-waiting to retreat precipitately to a respectful distance in the ante-room. Princess Line had also caUed the State arrangement a farce to herself, and had struggled to keep herself up to the pitch of incredulity and scorn ; but the moment that she saw Prince Paul, she felt the farce to be a dismal tragedy both for herself and him, and she threw herself despair- ingly on his breast, clinging to him as nothing but the direst tragedy would have made her do. \"You will not give me up, Line,\" cried Paul, stamping his foot. He said \"thou\" to her as she did to him, but there is no need to give a Quaker-tone to thed speech in English. \"The Grand Duke and the Council will it, my Paul,\" groaned Line ; she did not add \u2014 for Prince Paul knew it as well as she \u2014 that for a Kurzheim Madchen and, above all, a Kurzheim princess, to dispute the will of the Grand Duke and the Council, and to act in the teeth of it, was simply impossible. \"It is monstrous, Line,\" protested Prince Paul. \"How can the Grand Duke, or any human-hearted, sane-minded man require it of us ? What obligation is there upon us to fulfil such a sacrifice ? \" The two were standing near one of the windows. Prin cess Line raised herself on her Prince's shoulder, and looked out with her piteous eyes into the square. It was a busy square that day in the interests of its humbler inhabi tants. The lots of wood from the forest were being brouo-ht in winter faggots, and deposited at each door, and many of the population were engaged in carrying in and storing up the welcome billets. Among the toilers there were totterinc old house-mothers and weakly children. Princess Line, in her famdarity with the people, and her keen interest in the calendar of their lives, had often watched the operation \u2014 had often longed to go out and take her turn at the work."], [389, "THE FATHERLAND'S DEMAND. 377 \" There is the obligation, Paul,\" she answered him, pointing out of the window. \" It is ours- \u2014 yours and mine. I shall never be proud again. But yet I would not be base. I would take my precedence in suffering as in rank. If one or other must suffer, better I than they, better even you than poor burghers and peasants.\" \" I acknowledge nothing of the kind,\" cried Paul vehe mently ; \" and where is the need ? A fancy, a delusion ! What harm is Grossheim going to do us ? what harm has it ever done, that we should snap bonds and plunge into gulfs to avoid a union with it ? If it should seek a union, let it : Grossheim is the larger and more prosperous State.\" Prince Paul was one of the very few men in Kurzheim supine on the Grossheim question, but his supineness was much increased in the present instance by passion and self-interest. \" Paul, I wonder to hear you,\" exclaimed Princess Line, a narrow, heroic little Kurzheimer all over ; for if the Kurzheim men were fanatic heroes, to be sure the gentle women were ten times more fanatic heroines. She broke away from him altogether, and went and stood, an inspired pohtical enthusiast, beneath her grandfather's sword, which was hung up on the opposite wall. She looked up at the sword, as if in her slenderness and domesticity she were another Pucelle, panting to wield and sheath it in the hearts of the national enemy. \" That sword was drawn by the Grand Duke Wilhelm against the Grossheimers, in the wars of Napoleon, when the Grossheimers \u2014 like them then, and always \" (she put up her lip and reared her head) \" ranked themselves with the invader ; but the Kurzheimers formed a regiment of their own to resist the foreigner and to revenge the Fatherland on its traitors. Grossheim made atonement and did obeisance in time, and so got off, as it is the way of such nations, escaping aU save dishonour.\" \"Pooh!\" Prince Paul interrupted her carelessly. \" There is another than the ordinary Kurzheim reading of the story.\" (Prince Paul, though a little thick-headed, had, in all except personal matters, a man's superior coolness and impartiality.) \" Napoleon compelled the submission of many States, and I dare say it was the best pohcy \u2014 though"], [390, "378 A BALSAM. it was certainly mortifying \u2014 in Grossheim to submit and bide its time.\" \" I wonder to hear you, Prince,\" was all that Princess Line could repeat at first, reddening with indignation ; then when she had recovered words, she told him roundly, \" It is because Grossheim is so much larger and more prosper ous that we ought not to yield it a hair's breadth. Rather than that one of our poorest Kurzheimers \u2014 a cowherd or a goose girl \u2014 should have to bow and crouch to a great fat Grossheimer, I would consent to cut off my right hand, to die unmarried \u2014 I think I could consent never to see your face again, Paul,\" proclaimed Line loudly, though her voice sank and died away at the last asseveration. He had not the wit to understand her hyperbole ; besides, he was sorely wounded and frightened already. \" Then, I'll ted you what, there is a right heavy load of love lost between us, for you can never have loved me at all, Line,\" Paul accused her bitterly. Line said nothing in denial ; but there was a trembling through all her birch- tree of a figure, and she only raised her eyes and looked at him, and the poor fellow was at her feet. \"No, I cannot, will not, give you up, my beloved, my princess, my wife ! And how do I know \u2014 though I remained a bachelor these twenty vain, barren years, driven to desperation, too, by the sight of you given to another man for his wife \u2014 what, after all, would be the mind of this pernicious monkey ? By the time that the last brat of the Grand Duchess Karl (I always hated her \u2014 yes I did, Line,\" he insisted obstinately, in answer to a gesture of disapprobation from his friend, \" a restless, meddling magpie, though she is a widow, and all that) \u2014 by the time this precious child is a big girl, you may depend upon it, my dear, that she will have a will of her own, and take it, too, in the matter of a husband, in spite of Grand Duke and Cabinet Council, and the united press and pulpit of Kurzheim. And I don't say the mite will be wrong \" (Prince Paul defended his little cousin, pacing up and down the room with his hands in his pockets), \" though a dogmatic, domineering woman is not to my liking. Only, Line,\" he shook his head in wistful reproach, \" you are too dutiful and obedient, too much made to be brow-beaten.\""], [391, "EIGHTEEN TEARS LATER AUNT AND NIECE. 379 \" I shall not be brow-beaten into marrying any other man than you, Paul.\" She fell back on her old office of comfort ing and encouraging him. \" I will sooner be the sourest and sharpest of coffee sisters,\" she promised with a wan smile. \" As to my niece's not having you, my Paul \u2014 alas ! \u2014 can she help it ? \" But with the fond, sad question, the faintest beam of hope dawned on the wreck of Princess Line's torn and bruised heart. \" You must wait till you hear what the dumb one has to say.\" Princess Line wound up her speech hastdy, too timid to open her eyes readily to the spark of hope. \" I wid wait, let it be a thousand years, but it will be for you \u2014 not her,\" vowed Prince Paul in his impetuous mood. CHAPTER II. EIGHTEEN YEARS LATER\u2014 AUNT AND NIECE. Prince Paul had to wait, not the thousand years, but the eighteen, which saw the little princess a big princess \u2014 at least, big enough to marry ; and so also waited Princess Pauline. She was, by degrees, Pauline, and no longer Line, not even on Prince Paul's lips, for her niece was Princess Louise \u2014 familiarized into Lise \u2014 a name so like that of Line that the latter was fitly dropped in the dis parity between aunt and niece. Princess Pauline waited, with her poor devoted soul kept from starving by the merest crumbs of hope. With hope clean gone, she might possibly \u2014 and that without falseness \u2014 have been able so to lay the very ghost of the remembrance of her cousin in the light of lover and husband as to lend a languidly interested ear and at last to bestow a reviving heart and a willing hand on one of the minor German princes who at various dates paid suit to her. On the contrary, she uniformly rejected them absolutely, the representations of the Kurzheim Cabinet, unsupported by the old Grand Duke, proving without avail here. It was but two hours' journey to the boundary of the principality, beyond which and its rigid peddling nation-"], [392, "380 A BALSAM. ahty, its pathetic mock heroism, all unconscious of the mockery, there was no law, human or divine, to keep asunder inhumanly, for the fancied good of a small section of humanity and of one Grand Ducal family, two pledged and loving hearts. But of what service would have been the brief two hours of flight \u2014 all that was necessary for fugitives, who must have carried with them a mountain load of filial and national transgression and disgrace ? Prince Paul kicked very much at his fate, to begin with ; then he sulked, as the next stage in his condition. A little later he got leave to travel, and remained abroad for a. time. On his return he resided largely at Distelhof, where the Court had ceased to sojourn for the heat of summer, occupying himself with its hunting and shooting grounds and with a farm which he had within the forest. He came little to Court, and led, one regrets to confess, a rude life, with a few congenial companions, in his fastness. However, Prince Paul had his share of manliness and sense, which are no small virtues \u2014 sufficient to cause him to pull himself up before he became a bad bargain for the young Princess Lise and fairly broke the heart of Princess Pauline \u2014 not living so altogether retired that she was beyond the rumours of his reckless doings. Prince Paul steadied himself in time, and returned to the more active life of a citizen and to the greater restraints of polished society. He took his seat at the Council board, no longer as a mere young princely supernumerary impatient to be gone, but as an influential and interested member, in fine training for becoming an authoritative ruler of State affairs. Prince Paul was seen in the palace again, not so often as in the early days when he had been fain to come court ing Princess Line, but quite often enough to support his pretensions as the elected suitor for the hand of Princess Lise and for the guardianship of the grown-up child Prince Fritz. When Prince Paul reappeared in the capital and at the Court, he was a slightly overgrown, over-coloured man, a shade hectoring where he had only been impetuous of old, bluff, as a young man's frankness often develops into bluff ness when he approaches middle age. He was still a trifle thickheaded maugre the increased expansion of his fore-"], [393, "EIGHTEEN TEARS LATER AUNT AND NIECE. 381 head produced by the hair wearing away from the temples, but he had a certain weight and wisdom of experience written impressively on the originally over-smooth white material. He was a goodly prince withal, and sweet tempered, notwithstanding his hectoring, when he was not too much tried and provoked. With regard to Princess PauHne, it was significant that her intimate ladies could not do without an affec tionate abbreviation of her name. Now that the diminu tive Line was abolished \u2014 Princess Lise, having stolen, among other things, a bit of her aunt's name \u2014 the gracious ladies, for very affectionateness as well as for shortness, when they were not on ceremony, called their mistress Princess Paule. The most careful and considerate of them forgot how near the title was to that other which their princess had thought to claim in the joy and confidence of her youth. Princess Pauline, who had remained always in the same place, turning on the same pivot among her tarnished mirrors and velvet couches, grand piano, porcelain stove, myrtle and India-rubber trees, was as much changed as d she were another woman. She was still good, true, and tender \u2014 nothing could change her there \u2014 still showing the traditional type of sainthood, but it was the sainthood of the cloister now, and no longer of the warm, stirring hearth, or of the open, bustling market-place. Even her very sweet face had grown pinched and bloodless, as her character was becoming morbidly austere towards herself, and spasmodic and mystical in the expression of her charity and piety. She was getting a Httle hopeless of others, and more and more startled and scared by them, as a creature dwelling in dim shady places is depressed and fluttered when it passes into the rude, open light. Already, at nearly forty, Princess PauHne was a shadowy nervous ghost of a woman from whose individual existence and very constitu tion all lingering brightness and bravery were graduaUy being pressed out. Princess Pauline had to watch Princess Lise through every stage of her life ; to watch and wonder, with throbs of vain jealousy and fruitless anguish in the formerly con tented, patient heart, whether this trait or that would please and allure Prince Paul (she had known so well what"], [394, "382 A BALSAM. would please and allure him), or would repel and disgust him ? whether the fat rosy chdd would grow up into a pretty girl ? whether she would be cured of the tom-boy tricks incorrigible in maiden hands ? whether the incipient airs and affectation of the girl were signs favourable or un favourable of the dawning womanhood ? All the while there was an almost ghastly serio-comic element in the situation, like the patches and daubs of paint on the face of a clown whose heart is breaking. To think that Princess Pauline should reward her little niece with a slice of cake and a handful of cherries, charging her not to fill her mouth too full and not to choke upon the stones, and at the same time to be tempted to hate the child for usurping the woman's place ! To hear that Prince Paul had sent his little princess a doll, and to hear it with a pang ! How it covered Princess Pauline with shame as well as with sorrow ; how it wrung and tortured her noble, gentle heart ! The first time that Prince Paul saw his cousin Princess Pauline at the termination of his self-banishment, he looked at her fixedly, and then he turned away his head ; and he had always an inclination to turn away his head when he stumbled upon her afterwards. \" I should never have known her again, never,\" he said emphatically, half to himself. Prince Paul held stoutly that Princess Pauline had given him up long ago, while it was equally true that he had given her up. But he was not so utterly indifferent to her but that he would avoid her, and would be grave and cross for half a day after chancing to meet her. She did not throw herself in his way, but she came back from these casual meetings in a burning fever. She would pass a sleepless night afterwards, pray the more fervently, and be out by daybreak, or as soon as the early Court hours permitted her, in the heat and in the cold, tiring out her most attached lady-in-waiting by her endless deeds of benevolence to the beloved Kurzheimers. Verily the tongues of the people blessed Princess Pauline, so that, catching their grateful murmurs, she was impelled to say piteously, \" Surely God will hear them, and the day will come that, having afflicted me, He will afflict me no more.\" The next moment she would accuse herself harshly of pre-"], [395, "EIGHTEEN TEARS LATER \u2014 AUNT AND NIECE. 383 sumption, self-righteousness, unsubdued worldliness, and an evil nature. It was a fact that the poorest of the people, the very old, and a few of her own contemporaries, made a saint outright of Princess Pauline, and, in spite of thed Pro testantism, worshipped her. They maintained that the attractions of young Princess Lise were nothing to the early graces of Princess Pauline. But the mass of her own Kurzheimers, for whom, in mistaken devotion, she had declared, amidst her heart throes, that she was willing to sacrifice herself, shelved Princess Pauline \u2014 \" old Princess Pauline\" the young, bold, and irreverent spirits began to cad her, with her \" slow \" quietness and goodness \u2014 and gave their allegiance to the broad lustre of a new queen. While spring had dragged out its promise, and summer its perfection, to the over-ripeness of autumn and the hoariness of winter these eighteen times, the fresh changes in the Grand Ducal family had been far fewer and slighter than during the one or two eventful years after Princess Pauline grew up. The old Grand Duke still lived at that great age at which the Hving may be already so far withdrawn from thed fellows that only the faint echo of the clash and struggle of life still going on, as loudly and fiercely as ever, can reach the aged combatant where he sits waiting to be gone. Prince Fritz still lived his Hving death. He was an inoffensive idiot, as destitute of malice as of mind ; like a gaunt, creaking-jointed, ponderous-headed creature, whom some Frankenstein had succeeded in making, but had not been able to animate with the vital spark. One agreeable change in the palace of Kurzheim was that the Hereditary Grand Duchess Karl had married again among her own people at the other end of Germany, and in place of peace going with her, she had left it behind her. Of course she could not take her daughter \u2014 of so much importance to the Kurzheim nation \u2014 any more than her son. But one troublesome consequence of Princess Lise's mother's marriage and her removal from her daughter was, that the ci-devant Hereditary Grand Duchess Karl was"], [396, "384 A BALSAM. constantly sending from that other end of Germany spies to see after the welfare of Princess Lise, and report pro gress to her interested mother. These envoys were young and old princely kinsmen and kinswomen : and after all it was only just and fit that, in spite of the conventual and slightly inhospitable character of the Court, Princess Lise, a high-spirited young girl, should see her kindred, make some acquaintance with the world through them, and enjoy a little subdued merry-making, d she were not to be reduced to witlessness like her brother, or to be rendered a premature Protestant nun like Princess Pauline. Princess Lise was one of those girls who are quite women at eighteen. She was in some things more thoroughly matured than her middle-aged aunt. Princess Lise was in character like her mother, with a difference \u2014 more honest and affectionate. In person Princess Lise had an exuber ance of life and vivacity in her laughing eyes, her dimpled red and white cheeks, her pouting Hps, her chin adeady inclining to double itself, the profusion of her auburn hair, the fine sweep of her shoulders, and the freedom and firm ness of her gait. Princess Lise did more- than tolerate Tante PauHne ; the niece had a liking for the aunt, which was a considerable concession from a determined thoughtless girl, disposed to refuse to be in leading strings to a staid, reserved, formal aunt \u2014 (for her life Princess Pauline could not help being formal to Princess Lise) \u2014 an aunt who had striven \u2014 God knew how she had striven \u2014 to do what was right by her niece, to bear her no grudge, and to love her for another's sake, as well as her own and her family's, even to train her into being a model wife to Prince Paul. But Princess Lise's mind was full of a commonplace girl's shallow, conceited notions. While she liked her aunt, the girl, in the arrogance and intolerance of her youth, held the woman cheap, pitied her with a flavour of contempt in the pity, slighted her in heedless moments, which were tolerably numerous, and sometimes attempted to carry it with a high hand and to snub her aunt when that relative contradicted her. Princess Lise only rebuked herself, and was sorry for her misbehaviour when even her careless eyes could not avoid being struck by Princess Pauline's worn looks, and"], [397, "EIGHTEEN TEARS LATER AUNT AND NIECE. 385 when her light, sanguine mind received a passing impres sion of what her aunt had done and suffered for her family \u2014 Princess Lise's family as well as Princess Pauline's. As to taking into account how Prince Paul had been spoken of for Princess Pauline before he was set apart for her niece, the story had gone in at tho one ear and out at the other. The bare idea of a love affair of which Princess Pauline had been the heroine was supremely ridiculous to a commonplace mind which had never known love. The same commonplace mind was quick to claim and tenacious to hold its dues. Prince Paul was a brave and burly suitor, whom his promised bride by no means undervalued in tbe abstract. She was vain of his manliness and of the dignity of his very years. She delighted, like a child, to have so proper a man in her power, as she believed ; to tyrannise over him by playing off, against his bearded majesty and wrath, some one of the beardless kinsmen with whom her mother kept her well supplied. If Princess Lise did not always succeed in plaguing Prince Paul \u2014 who, as a rule, did not condescend to mind her fun much, and did not stop to harass himself with a doubt of his bride, or of stepping into the first place in the government of Kurzheim, a pros pect that had become dear to his middle-aged pride and ambition \u2014 she had the immense triumph of awakening trepidation in the Cabinet of her country. It did not approve of the outsiders who danced attendance on its princess. Might they not, for all the Kurzheim counseHors knew, be usurping Grossheimers in disguise ? But Princess Lise's flouts and vagaries principally per plexed her aunt, Princess Pauline. What headaches and heartaches such naughtiness gave to the woman who had never been naughty since she was a had-shy, half-sparkling Httle child ! The last importation to the Kurzheim court, on Princess Lise's account, was a pacific student, Prince Wilhelm, so innocent and sensitive-looking in his gdlishly fair beauty, so grave and thoughtful and learned, that the council dis missed all fear of him as a dangerous acquaintance for its not very manageable princess. It was some excuse for Princess Lise that her maiden days were fast approaching their termination. It wanted 2 c"], [398, "386 A BALSAM. little more than three months to the date when her grand father and the cabinet council of her alarmed countrymen had appointed, while she was yet in her fatherless cradle, that she should be disposed of in marriage, and pass into the safe hands of Prince Paul. NaturaUy Princess Lise desired to make the most of the little that was left her of her freedom, so she was particu larly provoking in wiling Prince Wilhelm from his pipe, and his Greek myths, in entangling him reluctantly in flirtations which were not at all in the quiet, steady lad's way, and in holding off Prince Paul when he grew at last nettled and disturbed. But Princess Lise was good as well as mirthful on the last gala evening in the Kurzheim palace that winter. A favourite girl-friend of Princess Lise was about to anticipate her princess by marrying a raw but sufficiently endowed officer of the Kurzheim Guards. Princess Lise would have the kindly child's-play which distinguishes the eve of a German wedding celebrated in the palace, and being an active-minded, pertinacious young woman, as well as a princess, she had her way, collected a large audience, and included in it, countenancing the sport, her elderly bridegroom, Prince Paul, and her maiden aunt, Princess Paudne. The quaint, homely masquerade is like a domestic nine teenth-century version of the moral plays of the Middle Ages. It is full of family jokes and nicknames, remini scences of the past and visions of the future, with personi fications of good and bad qualities. Thus, as Baroness Ida von Bach, the bride had been in her nonage notoriously an arrant coward in the matter of ghosts, sheeted figures glided, and cowled heads wagged among the palace guests on every side of her. As she had been beset by a not singular youthful weakness of strutting and crowing over every girlish success, to correct which her family had employed the wholesome satire of compar ing her in their annals \"to a certain famiUar barn-yard fowl,\" figures wrapped in great feather tippets, with their heads surmounted by magnificent scarlet silk crests, now hopped behind and scraped before Baroness Ida. As Baroness Ida's bridegroom was so fortunate as to possess"], [399, "387 EIGHTEEN YEARS LATER \u2014 AUNT AND NIECE. a venerable grand-aunt, whose hed he was, and to whom it was sanguinely proposed that Baroness Ida should be the best and dearest of daughters, she was perpetually encoun tering by anticipation old ladies in mittens, neckerchiefs, and helmet caps, with trains drawn through their pocket holes, and peaked shoes, who insisted on bestowing thed blessing and their grandmotherly caresses in the most pubHc way. Princess Lise to her great exultation supported many characters ; and in every character which she assumed she was constantly glancing over to Prince Paul as if she were solicitous of his approbation. Between every change of characters she came to his side, and looked up at him to be praised and petted. It would have been scarcely possible for a much harder and less susceptible man than Prince Paul not to be pleased and touched by the implied homage, not to be caught for the hour by the girl and princess in the pride and charm of her youth and the height of her happiness. Young Prince Wdhelm took no part in the mummery. He was too much of a stranger to be intrusted with a part ; and whether he moped under his exclusion from a large proportion of the juniors, whether his intimacy with stately Greek choruses caused noisy childish babble to be intolerable to him \u2014 he looked tired and dispirited in his velvet coat and ruffles. Princess Pauline, in the weariness of her heartache, labouring to be entertained herself and to entertain others, sought feebly to cheer the disconsolate boy, Prince Wilhelm, who would by no means respond to her promptings \u2014 on the contrary, who looked askance at her now and then with curious indignation, as though she had done him a great wrong in some former state of existence. Prince Paul wanted no cheering this night. He was in high feather, though he had not been coaxed by bis gay young mistress to condescend to wear a mask. The Groszschatzmeister, and the Hofmeister, indeed, in official recognition of what was Princess Lise's as well as Baroness Ida von Bach's pantomine, appeared, the one as a peasant of the province in which Baron von Bach's estate was situated, the other as a well-known and eccentric Herr"], [400, "388 A BALSAM. Professor in the famous university in which Baroness Ida's bridegroom had studied. But Prince Paul, as an in fluential highness, only wore his uniform as a general in the regiment of which Baroness Ida's bridegroom was a lieutenant. With reference to that uniform, Princess Lise told her bridegroom to his face \u2014 unblushingly on her side, though she absolutely made a flattered blush (the honest man was very open to flattery) burn through the forty and one years' bronze and bristles of Prince Paul's face \u2014 that he should not have required an extraordinary inducement to put on his gold-seamed and braided coat, and to hold a plumed hat in his hand, when he was so evidently formed for them and they for him. Any straggling anxieties and apprehensions which had of late puckered Prdice Paul's forehead and soured his good temper were completely set at rest this evening. Princess Lise had never been so markedly kind and deferential, with a shade of coy demureness which robbed her manner of pertness and lent it a Httle of the subdued grace that one was apt to miss in it. For more than one fleeting moment this night Princess Lise recalled to Prince Paul, for the first and last time in their lives, not her aunt Princess Pauline, but a happy loving maiden, whom ho had known in the long past and whom he had called his Princess Line. Princess Paul was carried out of himself; he clapped his hands at the game till he clapped his gloves to tatters ; he cried \"Bravo ! \" till his mellow voice grew hoarse; ho smiled broadly on his young princess ; his ruddy face flushed crimson with delight and affection. Prince Wilhelm put an abrupt end to Princess Pauline's charitable attentions by announcing, with lugubrious dignity, at a moment when Princess Lise had stepped within hearing, that he must retire and make preparations for his departure next day. Princess Lise received the news thus indirectly with a Httle laugh and toss of tho head, as if she considered Prince Wilhelm excessively foolish, and as if she had, moreover, grown rather tded of his companionship, so as neither to feel nor feign sorrow when his back was about to be turned."], [401, "389 EIGHTEEN TEARS LATER AUNT AND NIECE. Princess Pauline's court dress of brocade was most un becoming to her. It happened to be ashen-coloured, and the tint or absence of tint coincided with the wanness of her complexion, while the unbending folds of the material stood out in angular drapery that exaggerated the meagre ness of her figure. Princess Pauline's hair was also in full -dress, while it showed the silver threads glancing in its sandy locks, the only thing gleaming about her, and had over all a drooping green crown with a painful resemblance to cypress boughs. That is a true and faithful description of Princess PauHne at this period of her life, and on this night, to a cursory, superficial observer. But to an enlightened gazer who should study her, she was still like a priceless, low toned picture, like a ravishing air in a minor key, like the row of pearls which hung on her breast \u2014 a true lady, a tender woman, and a tried saint. Prince Paul's rapture went to his head Hke strong drink ; he could not pick and choose a listener, any more than an intoxicated man could select a confidant. He threw himself down on a chair near Princess Pauline, and broke out to her, of all persons in the world, in enthusiastic eulogies of Princess Lise, and in glad pro phecies of his happiness. \" Princess Lise is just what I want,\" concluded Prince Paul, with blissful assurance and oblivionsness ; \" a quieter woman would not have suited me in the end.\" \" Indeed, Prince, is it so ? \" inquired his listener with dry Hps and not knowing what she said, with her heart stabbed to the core, and with the words of another sentence ringing in her ears, \" I will wait \u2014 let it be a thousand years.\" The waiting had been for this, that she should be rejected and lightly esteemed to her face \u2014 and not merely as she now was, withered, pined away, and sore broken in spirit, but as she had been when she had given and never taken back of her best \u2014 her best, compared to which she had a swift, sure, indignant conviction in the middle of her humiliation, and of her humility and perpetual penances, that Princess Lise's gifts were coarse, common dross. AH had been thrown away on this ungrateful, forsworn man."], [402, "390 A BALSAM. The sound of Princess Pauline's husky voice, and the sight of the manner in which her shaking hand worked her fan, sobered Prince Paul and brought him back to himself and to certain facts in his history. He rose up as precipitately as his stature and state would admit of and retreated into a remote corner of the banquet-room, where for five minutes he could have knocked his head against the wall, or torn his hair like a mad middle-aged country man of Werter's, he was so remorseful in his genuine kindliness for the blow which he had dealt in his abominable candour. But soou Prince Paul's natural phlegm and complacency came to his aid. He ceased to call himself \" a cruel block head.\" He told himsed that she must have known the truth of what he had said \u2014 it was not far to seek, it was no secret. Princess Pauline was a woman come to the years of discretion, besides having been always wise. He persuaded himself that she would rather like to hear his content from his own lips. Nothing could so convince her that he bore no malice, that he had ceased to regret what she had done, and that he regarded her altogether as his friend. CHAPTER III. BINDING UP HIS WOUNDS. The next forenoon Princess PauHne sat cowering over her stove in the dazzling yet cold winter sunshine, fier hands and her handiwork had alike fallen into her lap, while she asked herself whether everything which she had regarded as rendering life not merely bearable, but grand in its littleness and sweet in its bitterness \u2014 ad truth, devotion, hope, and trust, were no better than the ashes before her. At that moment a gracious lady and lively grig of a noble woman burst in with the bare ceremony of knockino at the door. \"Oh! your highness \u2014 I beg your highness's pardon for"], [403, "391 BINDING UP HIS WOUNDS. intruding. No, it is nothing about the Grand Duke, nor the Hereditary Grand Duke Fritz. Compose yourself, dear Princess Pauline, for you are shaking like a leaf. It is about Princess Lise. Such a thing has come to pass ! Your highness remembers how Prince Wilhelm said last night he was going to-day, and stalked off the moment he had uttered the words, and without so much as wishing the iUustrious company good-night. Ah ! these scholars, though they are princes, are so rude- \u2014 only Prince Wilhelm looked so nice and blonde. Well ! what do you think ? \u2014 I do not know how I am to tell your highness. Youth, even in the members of royal families, is so dreadfullv regardless \u2014 only your youth was never regardless, dear Princess.\" \" But let us hear your news, dear lady,\" said Princess Pauline. \" Well, madam, Prince Wilhelm, instead of going away respectably this morning, according to his word \u2014 but I must say one of the carriages was ordered to the palace gate, and I ought to add in fairness, begging humbly that your highness will overlook my seeming to cast reflections on any member of the Grand Ducal family, that I do not think Prince Wilhelm, who was a modest young fellow and book-worm when he came, would have taken the steps which he did take had he not received encouragement.\" \" You owe me no apologies, Baroness,\" protested Princess Pauline with an impatient sigh. \"What has Prince Wilhelm done ? \" \" It must have been put into his head, in fact, by \u2014 I dare not say whom. Prince Wilhelm managed to have a private interview, against all the proprieties and the Court rules, with \u2014 with the Princess Lise. As for the interview, it did not matter so much after all, for it was cut short by the arrival of a deputation from the Cabinet, consisting of Count Von Bach and the Prince of Oesterthurm, to wait upon the Princess (I suppose she had forgotten the day \u2014 if she were not our princess I should say, she has such a memory !).\" \" Bad memories are the fashion,\" murmured Princess Pauline. \" Count Von Bach and the Prince Oesterthurm came,"], [404, "392 A BALSAM. as your highness will guess, to call upon Princess Lise to comply with the arrangement by which his Serene Highness the Grand Duke, the Cabinet, and the country have given her to Prince Paul, and to beg her to do him and the nation the honour of fixing the day for the grand festival of the wedding.\" \"Well, well,\" cried Princess Pauline, beating her thin hands together as if that would hurry the speaker. \"And now, what does Princess Lise say to the honour able councillors ? Gracious Princess, you will never guess. She will have nothing to say, after all that has come and gone, to Prince Paul \u2014 or to any other stout, purple, middle-aged man, old enough to be her father, no, nor to any young prince, save Prince Wilhelm, because they two are a pair of lovers \u2014 pardon the word, Princess Pauline, I die with the shame of having to utter it \u2014 but Princess Lise was so left to herself as to use it without any qualm, popping it out quite plain, I do assure you. Ach ! ach ! what are we all coming to ? \" \" To what the councillors said,\" prayed Princess Pauline urgently. \" If your highness will give me time,\" responded the informant in an injured tone. \" Princess Lise added that she and Prince Wilhelm had had a quarrel yesterday, but they had made it up to-day, and in the place of his going away this morning the two were never to part again. And what does my innocent little prince do but back Princess Lise as swaggeringly as auy Ritter of them all, and end by pulling out of his blessed pocket a paper containing the consent of the Hereditary Grand Duchess Karl to his pre tensions to the hand of our young princess, with which he had come ready furnished in case it should be wanted ! \" \" My gracious sister-in-law must have had her hand in everything,\" reflected Princess Pauline, striving to shake off a sense of stupefaction. \" Princess Lise maintains that she has done no wrong. She argues that she does well to resist usurped authority, and to assert her own freedom of choice within certain limits of royal blood. If it were not Princess Lise who said so, we should declare the speaker guilty of high treason.\""], [405, "BINDING UP HIS WOUNDS. 393 \"Princess Lise is right,\" said Princess PauHne, rising slowly to Her feet. As she did so she found light and strength to trample down old phantoms, and with them aU the stern barriers and rigid precedents of her life. \"Princess Lise is right,\" she repeated with firmness and fervour, \" to stand up for herself and Prince Wilhelm, if they love one another.\" \"How good you are, Tante Pauline, to take my part! \" Princess Lise confessed with effusion later in the day. \" I never counted on it from you. Had I known how kind and warm-hearted you were with ad your discretion and excellence, I should have taken example by you, and not have vexed you by my hoydenish ways ; above all, I should not have been just a little bit deceitful. I wish I had never teased you, Tante Pauline, because,\" finished Princess Lise with great solemnity, \" since this morning, I know what you have had to suffer.\" She know ! In the first flush of her love and its opposi tion, standing out for and with her lover, and he at her side, and in the act of taking his pledge that he would wait for her a thousand years, how little did the young Princess Lise know ! Happily for her, not to say for Prince Wilhelm, she had not to learn those further lessons so grievous to her prede cessor. Times and men had gradually changed, and old feuds and animosities had grown weaker. Prince Wilhelm presented no weighty disqualifications to be overcome. Indeed with his youth agreeing with Princess Lise's youth, his fair face suiting her bloom, his neutradty, his freedom from assumption, and his learning, he was a better prince consort than the most among the minor princes who would have been likely to offer themselves as candidates for Princess Lise's hand. The great objection to Prince Wilhelm was that he was not Prince Paul, who had been bidden to give up his own modest prospects and Princess Pauline, and had given them up, after a protest, and kept himself for Princess Lise these eighteen years, teaching himself, in the mean time, political ambition, and what was now, to him, the useless art of conducting state affairs. But as Princess Lise had already lifted her voice loudly"], [406, "394 A BALSAM. for Prince Wilhelm and against Prince Paul, the Cabinet Council of Kurzheim, assembled in full body, arrived a. the gallant and magnanimous conclusion that Princess Lise's widul voice turned the scales. There was nothing left for them to do but to cancel their former resolution, endorse Princess Lise's selection of a husband, and cause it to take effect. Nobody need mind Prince Paul very much \u2014 he was the victim of circumstances, and of a political mistake which might occur any day to the most conscientious and cautious of cabinet councils and principalities. Prince Paul had still Distelhof, its farm aud forest privileges, and, by the bye, he might still have \" old Princess Pauline.\" Prince Paul was not disposed to take his dismissal so easdy. Prince Paul was for a second time in his life wild with rage, pain, and mortification, when his horse clattered anew over the wooden bridge across the Weder, and into the palace court. But he did not seek Princess Lise's suite of rooms on this occasion, any more than he sought a second time those of Princess Pauline, nor did he go to the hushed, isolated apartment of the old Grand Duke. Prince Paul stamped into the council room, and up to the council-board, challenging the members to answer this fraud committed upon him as a prince and a man. But the most dogged man fights vainly one against a crowd. Princess Lise told Prince Paul frankly, by deputy, that she could not be said to have jilted him, since she had been no party to the ministerial arrangement, and had never wished to marry him \u2014 at least not after she had seen Prince Wilhelm. Prince Paul's former colleagues did no more than bear with his wrath \u2014 not resenting it, merely shrugging their shoulders behind his back. The old Grand Duke and thc- Hereditary Grand Duke Fritz were beyond the reach of appeal. Even a dull man saw that he had no chance \u2014 he was thrown over, and might as well give up a lost game. Fiercely putting away from him all suggestions of apology or compensation, refusing to see any one after he had seen the council, with the Furies behind him spurring him on, Prince Paul prepared to rush home to Distelhof and to arrange to shoot himself or Prince Wil-"], [407, "BINDING UP HIS WOUNDS. 395 helm. But his savagely spurred horse, plunging as it was lashed out of the palace gate, threw its master, and he was carried back senseless into the palace. Princess Lise grew quite white and chattered forth her terror. Prince Wilhelm sent for the court physician. He arrived quickly, but found a skilful nurse already at the patient's side \u2014 the Princess Pauline. Prince Paul was neither mortally nor dangerously injured, unless he himsed created the danger, fie was not even permanently crippled, he was only disabled for a period of weeks \u2014 a prisoner and a pensioner on the mercy of those whom he denounced as his greatest enemies. He might grind his teeth and rage at the galling restraint, the last humiliation ; he might sulk and he might storm \u2014 Prince Paul's right arm was fractured, and his left leg sprained, and he was a heavy, full-blooded man. Tho Herr Doctor would not permit his patient \u2014 were he twice a Prince Paul and thrice a middle-aged bachelor and despot \u2014 to move under a month's interval. Prince Paul lay like a log, ate and drank like a coerced barbarian, and closed his eyes tightly every time a faded, light-footed, low-voiced lady came near him. She did not cease to come every time the Grand Duke could spare her for that unprincely and thankless employment. She came after the prince had recovered some strength, recalled his good breeding, and was decently civil and gracious. She did not weary in her good offices when the month lengthened into two \u2014 not from any miscalculation in tho court physician's reckoning, but because of rheumatism laying hold of those heavy limbs of Prince Paul's, which were at present at a disadvantage. The profoundness of Prince Paul's mortification, the soreness of his tough heart began to yield in the sanguine, accommodating man after two month's time, especially when two months brought clearer skies and more balmy breezes. Princess Lise had gone on a farewell visit before her marriage to her mother, escorted under proper chaperonage by Prince Wilhelm. The cousins Princess PauHne and Prince Paul had the palace very much to themselves, and were again among"], [408, "396 A BALSAM. the principal persons in it, as they had been in their youth. Prince Paul began to think that since it had been ordained that he was to be laid up, it was better that it should be in the palace of Kurzheim, where he was still of some importance, and had as cheerful society as an invalid could avail himself of, than away in the crumbling lodge in a wilderness of Distelhof, where he was doomed to abide and relaj.se into a half -savage life. Princess Pauline tried hard to be cheerful with him and to cheer him, catering for him in collecting and spreading out before him all the scraps of news which he cared to hear. As spring brightened and broadened she drew his atten tion to the horn of the herdsman or the tinkling of the cows' bells in the streets when they went to and came from their pasture. She talked of the sowing of the seed and of crow and pigeon shooting and trout fishing ; graduady reviving in the human hearted prince his unsophisticated country tastes and pursuits \u2014 those which had been born with him and would latest die in him. Then she would delicately hint to Prince Paul, soothing his poor, vexed, single-hearted vanity, and at the same time drawing forth his manliness, that with his rank, his years, his honesty, and his solid sense and discretion, he would be sorely missed at the council board, where no stranger could take his place. She would simply suggest that it would be only right and princely and noble in him to continue his work there, though it might no longer be pleasure but pain to him to render it. Lying in enforced idleness and stillness, listening to Princess Pauline, the old charm began to work afresh, and to hold Prince Paul once more in a closer, firmer grasp than ever, so close and firm that it pained him at first. As he listened, he began to look at Princess Pauline and to detect in her more and more traces of Princess Line. Certainly Princess Pauline in her light, fresh morning gown, in a sick room, before a much stronger likeness to Princess Line than Princess PauHne in a court dress at a court festival had been able to do. Looking, recalling, dreaming, one day Prince Paul by a slip of the tongue called his cousin Princess Line. She"], [409, "397 BINDING UP HIS WOUNDS. winced, but said nothing. He repeated thc offence with aggravations \u2014 \"Line,\" he said, \"you are alwavs Line to me.\" Princess Pauline chose to forget that she had not been always Line to him \u2014 not when he had told her that a quieter woman than Princess Lise would not have suited him in the end. She looked away, but it was only to hide that she was crying with happiness, the more exquisitely sweet to her that it had been long delayed and came after bitter trial. \"Will you have me yet, Line ? Can I ask it of you ? \" \"You could not help it, Paul,\" she replied to his un spoken charge, and defended him eagerly against himself. \"I gave you up.\" \" Who let you give me up ? Who consented to give himself and did give himself \u2014 the baser part of him \u2014 to another ? \" he asked sadly. \" You only did what was required of you. No German prince would have done otherwise,\" she maintained warmly. \" I hope some princes would. I hope that there are men better than I, Line.\" \" I do not know them, Paul. It is I who am too old, worn, and spiritless now to be fit for you and Distelhof.\" \" Ah ! Well, Line, if you are capable of thinking poor Distelhof a Paradise, it is not for me to contradict you ; I am only too grateful, too blessed in your delusion.\" And Prince Paul put his restored limbs to their earliest use in hobbling from his couch to the side of Princess Pauline's chair in order to kiss her lips, cheeks, and hands, and stroke her hair, and call her young and fair for ever \u2014 to him. Prince Wilhelm and Princess Lise proved a tolerably happy couple, and he made the best of her that could be made. But if one wanted to see a supremely happy couple, any Kurzheimer (and the Kurzheimers took a par ticular pride in this couple) would have directed you to go out to rustic Distelhof, and contemplate the serene cheer fulness, the genuine kindliness and usefulness of Prince Paul with his Princess Pauline \u2014 growing stout in her serenitv, the most bountiful as well as the most benign of matrons."], [410, "398 A BALSAM. By a satire on far-sighted political precautions, Princess Lise and Prince Wilhelm, Prince Paul and Princess Pau line had not been married a year, when not only the old Crand Duke was gathered quietly to his fathers, but thc young Prince Fritz quickly followed him. Kurzheim, according to one of the unaccountable settlements of royal houses, passed over the Prince Paul branch, and went to another race of sovereigns altogether : thus it became not of the smallest consequence, so far as the pubhc welfare was concerned, to whom the baby Princess Lise had been prospectively betrothed, or whom the girl Princess Line had married.
