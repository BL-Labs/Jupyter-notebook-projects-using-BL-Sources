HIDING THEIR HEADS. As soon as Georgie got it into her practical little head that it was an as tonishing fact, and no fancy, a solemn reality and no bad joke, that the whole family were to start that night for the Continent, she wasted no more precious time on the why and the wherefore. Inquiries and speculations might intrude themselves urgently on her preoccupied mind, but they could wait greater leisure for their solution. What she and every body else had to do at the present mo ment was to get ready to go, if they must go on the expedition. It was VOL. II. 15"], [14, "2 SAPPHIRA. strange and unaccountable that they must, but the strangeness and unaccount ability must also wait for an explanation. So must the undreamt-of wrong-doing and retribution \u2014 of which, somehow, Mrs. Baldwin knew as well as Pat, the mere distant, vague conception of which burned, nevertheless, with a painful burning crimson on Georgie's cheeks as she ran up and down stairs, lugging out trunks, emptying drawers, folding up dresses. Her ungrudging, unmurmuring activity was a reproach to Agnes. She was no longer thinking of resisting or of withdrawing from the others and taking no part hi their flight. As Pat had said, when his mother consented, Agnes must yield. And what she minded was not the going, the break ing up in an instant of her whole previous life, with its cherished associations and one engrossing occupation. It was the fatal admission, that by some disastrous departure from the straight path of or-"], [15, "HIDING THEIR HEADS. 3 dinary humanity, her mother was in danger and had to flee. There had been at the very least some cowardly failure, and still more cowardly evasion, where truth and righteousness come into play. There had been some great destructive flaw in what Agnes had fondly judged flawless, which rendered such an unusual step called for, that the household should gather up their goods and decamp, like evil-doers and outcasts. She had been warned, it is true ; but the very warning still lingered in her mind as a wild fancy, a glaring insult, the distorted imagery of a horrible dream, any glimmering con firmation of which in her mother's habits and in the faint recollection of childhood, she had been fighting against gloomily. Agnes rose up languidly and tried to get her papers and a few of her books and clothes in order, though with regard to the former, she had the strongest con- viction that she would never write again. 15\u20142"], [16, "4 SAPPHIRA. Hoav could she when the whole universe was crumbling about her head, when the household goddess she had enthroned and ardently worshipped was dethroned, covered with some mysterious disgrace, and as it were sitting abjectly in the dust ? For the first time in her life, Agnes occupied herself entirely with herself and her own concerns. She did not offer to assist anybody ; she left her mother to Georgie. Mrs. Baldwin marked the change, and looked with a curious timidity and wistfulness at Agnes, who did not meet her mother's eyes or return her look. Then the mother made as if she would do her own packing, at which Georgie cried out loudly as at the greatest absurdity which had been proposed for many a day. She took Mrs. Baldwin's knitting out of her hands and was about to put it up with other effects which could not be done without, but the elder woman interposed : \" Don't trouble,"], [17, "HIDING THEIR HEADS. 5 Georgie ; I beheve I shall not want it ever agam,\" she said with a long sigh. \" I think I have come to hate it. I be lieve I should shudder at the sight of it if it were brought out in new surround - mgs. Again Georgie collapsed for a second and stood looking incredulously at her mother, till she took herself to task with the rousing, usurping reminder that they were all going abroad this very night and that there was, of course, an immense deal to do, and hardly anybody save her self to do it. For Agnes, who had hitherto been a pillar of strength in difficulties, was somehow stricken down and walk- ing about as if in a bad dream. Mother could not be suffered to exert herself with so much fatigue before her. Pat, who had suddenly superseded Agnes as head of the house, had enough to do in other respects, while he looked dead in earnest and fully determined on this unheard-of"], [18, "6 SAPPHIRA. proceeding. He paid the aggrieved Selina wages and board for a month in advance. He did not stop to hear her protest that in all her families with whom she had lived she had never heard of such a doing as this here. But what was to be expected from a missus as sat, month in, month out, like a pillar of salt or Lot's wife, and only bestirred herself to receive a crazy old serving-man. Or what was to be expected from a miss as was always a-scribbling, scribbling, when she was not running all over London. \" Books,\" Miss Georgie said, very hke. Then was it books that gave her an other name ? Selma could take her Bible oath that when the postman brought a letter, not directed as it ought to have been to \" Miss Baldwin,\" but to a \" Miss Judith Westmoreland,\" or some such play-acting title, and asked, civil enough, if a lady as answered to the name lived there, just when she, Selina, was in the act of saying \"no\" positively \u2014 for what had they"], [19, "HIDING THEIR HEADS. 7 or other respectable females to do with any \" Miss Judith Westmoreland ? \" \u2014 out darted Miss Baldwin. Though her nose was mostly in her ink bottle, she had heard every word that was said. \" Stop, Selina ; stop, postman,\" she says ; \" that letter is for me,\" as cock-sure and as bold as brass. No good comes of ways unlike other people's, and least of all of made names and moonlight flirtings. Selina's last family were a queer lot and she was well quit of them. By the time she came to this conclusion, Selina devoted the moments that were left to changing her dress, making a minute inventory of her wardrobe and packing her box. She dis dained to lend a helping hand to such objectionable employers. \" Little Baldwin \" in his new capacity did wonders, besides stuffing his port manteaus. He looked up the keys and locked the outer premises. He wrote addresses. He communicated his ap-"], [20, "8 SAPPHIRA. proaching departure to the dispensary and to the house agent \u2014 referring the latter to Sam Scrope. He summoned a caretaker who had once before been hi the house for a week ; ah ! that was in such different circumstances, when Agnes had insisted on taking the family for a flying visit to the seaside, in order that Georgie might the sooner recover from an attack of influenza. Then, not to say the patient, everybody, including even Mrs. Baldwin, had been sensible of a mild elation. There was no elation in anybody's spirits to-day when Pat, as the last occu pant, drew down the sitting-room window blinds after he had sent the caretaker to fetch a cab. It was a slight consolation to Georgie, in the middle of her share in the family trouble, to be conscious how much de pended on her, and that the precipitate act which Pat had inaugurated, and her mother authorized, could not have been"], [21, "HIDING THEIR HEADS. 9 carried through, even at the last moment, but for her, Georgie's, faithful efforts to promote the inevitable. For the Baldwins, who had, as a rule, been notably domestic and methodical hi their performances, did, to the mystification of their neighbours, their dependants, nay, to some of them- selves, start in a body for the Continent that same night. Nobody came to help and see them away, and what was more wonderful, perhaps, nobody sought to in- terfere with them or stay them ; though no doubt Pat and Sam Scrope together could have explained the supineness of the agent. The house bills had been paid weekly, with admirable punctuality, by Georgie. No tradesman felt warranted, as yet, in doubting the family credit, though the sudden swift exodus was both suspicious and alarming. There is always something which sa vours of mystery and adventure in a night train and a night voyage, which"], [22, "10 SAPPHIRA. fitted in with the peculiar circumstances of the Baldwins, and caused all the young people to fall under the spell and be partly carried away by it. Georgie with her matter-of-factness and Pat with his familiarity with the route might not have been so susceptible to the influence, had their nerves not been already tingling from a recent shock. Agnes would al ways have been keenly alive to the influences of the hour and the situation. Now, cast down as she was from her spiritual heights and writhing in the depths of utter disappointment akin to despair, she was aware of a certain dead ening, enthralling sense of novelty and of an overwhelming destiny which it was vain for her to resist. She felt delivered from the bondage of former habits and customs, and launched whether she would or not into an unknown life, as the train rushed on in the dim darkness of the summer night, and the"], [23, "HIDING THEIR HEADS. 11 boat ploughed its way over the unseen waters. Possibly Mrs. Baldwin was also at once aided and stirred in the new crisis of her fate, by the same consciousness of mys tery and of a fresh departure in her history. But when the boat arrived at Calais, and there was a gradual subsiding of the first natural excitement, unknown before to the three women \u2014 mother as well as daughters, of landing in a foreign country, amidst a httle crowd of foreign men and women, in aspect and dress vary ing in sundry small but striking details from the aspect and dress of English sailors, custom-house officers, porters, fisher men and women, it was plain to see what a belated little party were there in the silvery morning hght. They re mained dumb in answer to the clamour of foreign tongues. They refused to be borne along bv the small rush of their fellow-passengers, to swallow cups of"], [24, "12 SAPPHIRA. coffee, glasses of cogniac, and what food they could find at the railway buffet. The Baldwins sat huddled together, as it seemed, in the compartment of the French railway carriage to which Pat had taken them, his mother on his arm, Agnes and Georgie following close at their heels, as if the sisters would be lost if they strayed a hair's-breadth or lingered a second. It was a singular proof how stunned and prostrated the women were that speech failed among the whole three. Nobody asked, till Pat vouchsafed the information, in what direction they were going, what part of France, or it might be Italy or Turkey, was to be their ultimate destination, any more than those who did not know demanded why they had come there. Why, the whole framework of their ex istence had been shattered and its story as it were brought to an end. True, two of the travellers did know more or less clearly, with the knowledge burnt"], [25, "HIDING THEIR HEADS. 13 into their consciousness, the reason why this inconceivable transformation of their lives had come to pass within twenty four hours. A third member of the company had had the veil partially torn from her eyes, enough, even while she vehemently shut them against the betray ing light, to make her \u2014 high-spirited and courageous by original constitution\u2014 cling desperately to the rags of concealment which were yet left her, and dread with a sickening apprehension the stripping off of the last shred of bandage, the overthrow of the last tottering crumbling defence which ignorance could maintain against the withering shameful truth. Georgie, the youngest and simplest of the group, had been taken by surprise without being further enlightened. But she was too wise and smgle-minded in her very simplicity not to put two and two together. She had been more with her mother than the others had been"], [26, "14 SAPPHIRA. for years. To her unimaginative straight forward mind, her mother's withdrawal from the world, her self-absorption and settled gloom, were more incomprehen sible, unnatural and unhealthy, than they had ever appeared to Agnes, or even to Pat. Georgie had also been better ac quainted with the episode of the old ser vant who haunted and harassed Mrs. Baldwin with his visits, and though the girl hated to cast blame on anybody, above all on her mother, she had arrived, by her unaided shrewdness, at the conclu sion that Mrs. Baldwin was, or believed herself to be, in some odd manner, under a great obligation to Tweedside Johnnie, and thus far in his power. Georgie had not confided her opinion to Pat or Agnes, partly because she could not bear to reflect upon their mother, partly be cause, if she so much as hinted at such a disparaging idea to her sister, Agnes would not listen and would indignantly"], [27, "HIDING THEIR HEADS. 15 silence the speaker. Georgie, ungifted with that higher faculty which is apt to deal for the most part inconveniently and always dangerously with beloved ob jects, did not idolize her dearest friends. Loving her mother honestly in her own reasonable affectionate way, she yet saw in her an erring mortal, who must al ways have been capable, like Georgie's self for instance, of doing wrong and foohsh things hi the course of her life. In her clear-sighted acuteness, Georgie was inclined to hold that her mother's obstinate avoidance of social intercourse, and the fashion in which she gave her self up to habitual depression, were in themselves foohsh and wrong. Still, with filial instinct she shrank from the ex- posure of any error which her mother had committed, while she was sure in her inno cence and kindness that it could not have been a great error. It could only have been some careless or reckless infringement of"], [28, "16 SAPPHIRA. rule and precedent, some offence against the letter of the law, for which she was thus, late in the day, by Tweedside Johnnie's folly and faithlessness, doubt less called to account and persecuted. Georgie's spirit rose in defence of her mother. Agam, it was not altogether prostra tion of spirit which prevented Georgie from cross-questioning Pat as to their destination. Long ago Agnes had appointed Georgie the family housekeeper and purveyor for everybody's comfort and well-being. She had rebelled against the appointment as not giving a healthy, well-disposed young woman, who was not a genius certainly, enough to do in the matter of contributing to the support of the family, an obligation which, in Pat's absence, Agnes had the audacity to take on her slim shoulders and on the sharp point of her pen. Though Georgie was not a genius, she had a great ambition,"], [29, "HIDING THEIR HEADS. 17 in the circumstances, to be self-support ing and useful ; but in spite of her protest she took kindly to the office imposed upon her, far more kindly than to the ignis fatuus of becoming a great painter which Agnes had also dangled before her sister's eyes. The fact was, Georgie was a born housekeeper, helpmeet and nurse, instead of a painter ; she might perfectly well have been both, but not being the one she was certainly the other. At the present moment she had it on her mind that her mother must be cared for, and Agnes seen to, and not allowed to neglect her bodily wants. Pat might be trusted to find out when he was tired, hungry and thirsty, but neither of the others could be left to themselves. The crossing had been a good one, and Mrs. Baldwin had as yet stood the hurried journey very well, marvellously so, considering the absolutely sedentary life which she had led for many years. VOL. II. 16"], [30, "18 SAPPHIRA, But Georgie, watching her mother leaning back in the corner of the carriage, with her dull eyes half closed, a faint red spot on each ashen cheek, her gloved fingers occasionally moving with a little involuntary action, as if they missed the accustomed knitting, felt that she, Georgie, must keep a vigilant eye on the elder traveller, lest she should break down all at once. Pat, in his double capacity of attentive son and learned physician, was alive to the same possibility. When he had seen his charges seated hi their places, he ran back and fetched a waiter with a tray of refreshments from the buffet. His mother took what he told her to take, as she had risen and left her home, at his bidding. Georgie herself was guilty of an appetite which she was not ashamed to satisfy, just as Pat felt bound to eat and drink without apolooy, like a man. But Agnes put everything away from her as if food would choke"], [31, "HIDING THEIR HEADS. 19 her. To the best of Georgie's belief, she had not swallowed enough to keep a sparrow in life for the last two days. This was a serious weight on Georgie's conscience, usurping her attention. It was in vain that she remonstrated in eager whispers : \" You must take some thing, Agnes, now that you are here. You must avail yourself of what there is to eat ; it seems wholesome enough and not out of the way. It is quite silly of you not to force yourself to drink a cup of coffee and eat a bit of cake. What good will it do for you to make yourself ill ? \" Agnes only shook her head in a piteous negative ; her heart-sickness had made her body sick. Georgie had to rest her faith on the broken reed of the biscuits which she took the precaution to buy and store, and the flask which Pat filled. 1C-2"], [32, "CHAPTER II. A REFUGE. WHAT'S IN A NAME ? There was still nobody in the Baldwins' third-class carriage at so early an hour. They were at liberty to speak freely. \" We are going to Normandy,\" Pat volunteered the information which nobody had sought. \" I thought that quarter would do as well as any other, and it would not be too far for the mother.\" Nobody spoke for a moment, nobody seemed to care where they went. Then Georgie, who was not in the habit of making quotations and indulging hi far fetched references \u2014 solemn or grotesque, in her excitement, worry about her mother and Agnes, and generally unsettled frame of mind, struck in with the doggrel : \" ' There came four dukes from Normandy, To court uiy daughter Jane.'"], [33, "A REFUGE. WHAT'S IN A NAME ? 21 How fond you were of playing at that game when we were children, Agnes. I did not care for it, but you told long stories about each of the dukes, and about ' the pound ' which ' my daughter Jane ' carried away in her pocket for her dowry, which was not there when she returned.\" (The truth was, the Baldwins' proceeding in the present stage was not unlike a fantastic, incoherent play or game). \"Nor mandy,\" repeated Georgie, who seemed doomed to be the speaker ; \"we shall see the pippins au naturel, and as we shall be near Brittany I may take it for granted that we shall not want for butter.\" \" That's right, Georgie, make the best of things,\" answered Pat, with a laugh out of tune, to kill care as he would have said. \" Quatr'eaux, for which we are bound, is not a show place, though it has a decent cathedral, I believe. It is not on the coast and it is not on a river of"], [34, "22 SAPPHIRA. any consequence, though its name gives it the credit of four streams. It is out of the main line to places of greater importance and has been left to its own resources. It has not more than seven or eight thousand inhabitants, and they are principally engaged in the linen trade. I do not give you these valuable statistics from personal experience, but from Baedecker and a little hearsay evidence I chanced to pick up some months ago, which I have just called to mind. Let me tell you that Quatr'eaux has the distinction of being, beyond dispute, the cheapest little town in France. That is a consideration of paramount moment to us, since we, you two girls and I, must look out immediately for something to do, and make our earnings go as far as possible.\" Pat had deliberately and advisedly been bringing round the conversation to the question of ways and means to which he"], [35, "A REFUGE. WHAT'S IN A NAME ? 23 was certain it would soon tend. In tlie hurry of startmg, his family had, some- Avhat to his surprise, accepted his assurance that he was provided with money for the journey, without further question. But they would not long continue so passive, and the discussion of funds could not come too soon, par ticularly as it might divert reflection from more painful considerations. \" A little money will come to us,\" Pat pursued the subject, still asserting his natural su premacy as the man in the group and for that conventional reason its leader. \" There will be something from the sale of the furniture, which a broker is likely to take at a valuation.\" This was truly to scuttle the ship in their rear. \" The furniture ! \" shrieked Georgie, tak ing the alarm ; \" mother's furniture, the last remnant of what she brought from Brackengill ? Why, we shall have nothing to go back to. How could you take it"], [36, "24 SAPPHIRA. upon you to dispose of mother's furniture without her knowledge and consent ? \" Pat bent his brows. \" It would have been impossible to bring it with us, Georgie. It would be still more foolish to have it sent after us. It will be time enough to think of what we have to go back to, when we are going back. Mother, you do not mind letting the furniture go ? \" he turned to her, with the same anxious, pitying, protecting gentleness with which he had behaved to her for the last fourteen hours. \" No,\" she said with an effort ; \" I have no wish ever to see it agam.\" Georgie was silenced. There was a rustle from Agnes's corner as she turned her face still farther out of sight. Even Pat was quenched for a moment. But it was part of his difficult duty to keep up his sisters' spirits as far as he could, and to launch their thoughts on a new train of calculation and enterprise. \" There will"], [37, "A REFUGE. WHAT'S IN A NAME ? 25 be a little money sent over to us,\" he said again ; \" but I think you will all agree with me that, even if we have to take the use of it in the meantime, it ought to be put back and told off, as soon as may be, to pay the loan which I have been forced to contract from a friend.\" \" Of course,\" said Georgie promptly. Mrs. Baldwin bestirred herself to make some acquiescence. But all that Agnes did was to wince anew. \" At least we cannot be much worse off, in respect to worldly goods, than the generality of emigrants \u2014 than the old French emigres were who came to England without a sou, with their fives in their hands, a century ago,\" resumed Pat, drum ming with his fingers on the window pane by which he sat. \" They contrived to make a living, so why should not we ? They had pubhc sympathy on their sides, to be sure, while we camiot count on that,\" he wound up his sentence rapidly. \" But,"], [38, "26 SAPPHIRA. I say, you girls,\" he began again with renewed animation, \" I have been think ing that I have something in my favour \u2014 the fact that I have studied medicine in France, and taken a French degree. That ought to entitle me to practise my re spectable calling of 'sawbones' in any town in France. I may not get a single patient, especially as we shall be wide of the track of English and American tourists, and national prejudice may be against me, but that is quite another matter. It is something to be qualified to work at one's lawful trade, Avhether the working be to profit or not. I might get a little dis pensary work there as at Barnes, or I might take a turn in a chemist's shop ; it would be an honest enough shift, and I ain't proud, let us be thankful. As for you, Georgie, you were to witch the world Avith noble painting ; you shall attack the Cathedral : if it is comparatively small it is not hackneyed. You shall paint it"], [39, "A REFUGE.

It will always be a genteel calling, you may thank your stars ; and some of the natives ought to give you a few francs for your sketches.\" \" They Avill not be such fools,\" said Georgie ruefully ; \"but I haA*e always had an idea that I could teach draAAung. I have had such good teaching, and plenty of it, thanks to Agnes's too flattering estimate of my abilities. Though I have neA*er had much hope that the good teach ing was not thrown away upon me, it might enable me to get drawing pupils ; and I know English fairly \u2014 of course. Mother pinched herself to provide us with tolerable governesses, and I could undertake to impart the rudiments of my mother tongue. I wish I had not heard, or that there was no foundation for the report, which represented the mass of httle French girls as getting their education in convents.\" The young Baldwins had been brought"], [40, "28 SAPPHIRA. up so far to earn their living ; but to set about it as two of them now proposed, in a moment, in a strange place, sounded very like a wild-goose chase. Both Pat and Georgie were too quick-witted not to be aware of the huge obstacles to their success, Avhich, on the whole, they felt it better to ignore. Pat's next suggestion had a more reasonable, feasible ring about it. \" As for Agnes,\" said Pat, \" she will be able to concoct her romances as well in France as in England, at Quatr'eaux as at Barnes. They will haA*e a new setting, that is all. Publishers are within reach of the post. Let us be thankful Agnes has elected to be our bread-winner for months past ; she must hold on a little longer till Georgie and I find a footing. Happily for e\\*ery body our move is, if anything, in her fa\\*our, opening up for her pen fresh fields and pastures new and that style of thing. It will make no further difference to her.\""], [41, "A REFUGE. AVHAT'S IN A NAME ? 29 How strange Pat's speech sounded ! He did not mean to be unkind, far from it. He was paying Agnes the highest compliment he knew of, with gratifying sincerity and really warm affectionateness. He was turning to her with a half-stifled sigh of relief, as still the mainstay of the family, the member whose resources, now as eA*er, could be depended upon. Irony or cruelty was the A*ery last thing he was thinking of, yet Agnes felt as if she were mocked and taunted. Would the eA*ents of to-day and yesterday make no difference to her ? What did the speaker take her for ? She remembered Avith a pang that she had asked the same question of Sam Scrope. But could Georgie and Pat not guess that the events of to-day and yesterday had made all the difference hi the world to her ? With her heart wrung, her faith slain, her peace poisoned, how could her imagina tion escape the universal blight which had fallen upon her world ? Oh ! how little"], [42, "30 SAPPHIRA. they understood, even while they shared in this awful calamity, what it was to her. How could they be beginning already to look forward and make plans ? She smiled a faint woe-begone smile and slightly shook her head. Yet she did not wish to fail them, or to dispirit the very persons whom she had been wont to stimulate and support. She tried to say something which would meet the circum stances. \"I do not know about writing.

She wrung her glo\\*ed hands impotently. \" Oh ! my poor children, I am to be such a trouble to you,\" she moaned ; \"I thought to shield you, and I shall be your bane.

And I, if I live to hear it, will rejoice. Am I not her mother hi my misery \u2014 the mother of all you children ? \" The listeners were taken by surprise. It was so unheard of for their mother to rouse herself and share in their discus- sions, to give as it were a personal revelation of herself, even to make so"], [45, "A REFUGE.

Sad and standing apart as they had always known her, letting them go their own way and interfering little with them, she had never coiweyed to them the idea of being set aside, as far as they were concerned ; she had not been regarded either by herself or them as unfit to claim the pre-eminence which she had voluntarily resigned. She had been a proud, dignified woman naturally, and the very manner in which she had \u2014 what- ever sorrow she endured, sufficed for herself, wrapping herself up in an impene- trable reser\\*e, had lent her a kind of melancholy exaltation, as far removed from weakness and worthlessness as from cheerfulness. It was inexpressibly pitiful to her children to have her thus abase herself before them. \" Hush ! mother,\" said Pat, speaking with the impatience, well-nigh resent ment, under a show of which a man is fain to mask a very different emotion. VOL. II. 17"], [46, "34 SAPPHIRA. \" Of course you are my charge, say no more about it.\" \" Oh ! what nonsense, mother,\" chimed in Georgie, and then it was on the tip of her honest tongue to implore : \" But tell us all about it ; trust us, your children, and it will be better for you and everybody.\" But a warning glance from Pat stopped her. This was no time or place to press for her mother's confidence. Instead, she continued her rallying tone while, as she did so, she employed one of those terms of endearment which were not frequent in the Baldwins' mouths. \" Dear, how could you imagine that we should leave you behind us ? Why, we should not know ourseh*es without you.\" Agnes 's tongue clave to the roof of her mouth, while her mother looked at her in an agony of expectation. More even than on her only son, Mrs. Baldwin's heart had been set on her elder daughter. The girl's untiring energy, her dauntless"], [47, "A REFUGE. AVHAT'S IN A NAME ? 35 courage, her unbounded faith, the touch of genius which marked her out from other girls, had fascinated and held fast her mother's tenderest, strongest affections ; she had been proud of Agnes from her childhood. The one ray of happiness, of hopeful association with the outer world, which Mrs. Baldwin had allowed herself to retain was in watching Agnes' s progress as an author and in listening to her songs. The mother had read and re-read every line of her daughter's Avhich had appeared in prhit, and it need hardly he added that, though a woman of good judgment originally, she had exaggerated their merit and importance ; she had learned to attach an undue weight to everything Agnes said and did, or failed to say and do.

Quatr'eaux was not unlike many French and a few English towns of its size. The Cathedral with its chapels and towers, fretwork and pinnacles \u2014 the solitary archi tectural boast of the place, stood in the middle of the older part of the town, the centre of a labyrinth of old-fashioned, narrow, somewhat squalid streets of tall houses with high-pitched roofs. There was a tolerably quaint market-place among the houses, presided over by the statue of a medi\u00e6val bishop of Quatr'eaux, who wore a breast-plate instead of a lace"], [49, "A REFUGE.

In spite of the breast-plate and sAvord of the church militant, it was said that he had been hunted from his bishopric and narrowly escaped murder at the hands of the revolted wolfish sheep of his fold. In this provincial market, regu lated by the mayor, who enforced strict primitiA*e market laws of buying and selling, were stalls of flowers and fruit, interspersed with stalls of yard-long French bread, meat and poultry cut and trussed French fashion, shoes and sabots, earthen ware pots-au-feu and pipkins, and yet other stalls which vindicated the ecclesias- tical side of the town. These last displayed long rows of what Georgie at first sight cried were \" images\" of saints or monks and nuns, with halo-encircled or hooded and cowled heads, relieA*ed against little plantations of floridly carved and gilded crucifixes, garlanded with rosaries. On three sides of the town stretched"], [50, "SAPPHIRA. 38 the suburbs of semi-genteel and wholly genteel modern terraces and squares and villa-like houses, of which the portes cocheres and the jalousies were the most conspicuous attributes. These formed the residences of the richer linen manufac turers and professional men of Quatr'eaux. On the fourth side of the tOA-m, though there was no riArer to speak of and all the travelling and traffic of the inhabi tants were maintained by diligences and carriers' carts communicating with the terminus of a branch line of railway, there still remained one of the minor streams and brooklets of which there had apparently once been four. The sole survivor had much the look of a more or less stagnant ditch encircling this quarter of the town. Beyond the trick ling channels and green pools lay a little bit of a great dark changeless forest. The knowledge of its vicinity stirred the pulses, though in reality there was not"], [51, "A REFUGE. WHAT'S IN A NAME ? 39 even a tree of respectable size to be seen, simply a belt of brushwood with a spindly young elm or poplar rising at intervals to break the monotony, because the towns people of Quatr'eaux had the right of bringing in firewood from the forest. But Pat was prepared to say there was a veritable forest, and that if you pursued any of its woodland paths long enough you would find the scene stately and solemn, lonesome, bewildering and weird, as all true forests are. Withm the memory of living men, not merely rabbits, hares, roebuck, and foxes hi abundance, but white-fanged wolves had emerged in hard winters from its dim recesses. The wedge of forest beyond the brooklet, so lazy and overgrown with water-ranunculus that the washerwomen could not beat their linen white in its scanty waters, was the most foreign, the nearest to a poetic element hi Quatr'eaux.

Pat scarcely gave the weary women time to rest in the old inn near the Cathedral, where there were garcons for wraiting-maids, before he hurried them mto the greater privacy of quiet lodgings in a side street. Pat's familiarity with colloquial French was far removed from the girls' insular schoolroom acquaintance with the language, which they would have brought forward, had they been without him, with justifiable dubiousness and shyness.

He had found no difficulty in look ing up and securing the modest little suite of rooms in a locality not too airless for life to be lived in them, which w?as all that he ventured to eng*ao*e. The apartments were above the shop of a man milliner and his wife, who made various lively gestures and grimaces in signifying that the band-box rooms were not only all they should be, the famille anglaise would find them charming, ravishing, be yond any etage they had ever known, and a ridiculous bagatelle where expense was in question. The man-milliner was pre pared with gay pohteness to act as con cierge, madame his wife wrould see that the cooking, serving and scouring were done to a wish by old Suzanne, their own incomparable, trustworthy domestic. When Pat had learnt for himself that the polished wooden floors, the brilliant cretonne curtams, the gorgeous rugs, the high-piled beds, the superabundance of"], [54, "42 SAPPHIRA. glass and gilding were intact and reason ably clean, he was satisfied. What did it matter that the most imposmg article of furniture in the sitting-room was a glit tering steel stove, and that its ornaments consisted of one of the \"images\" which Georgie's rampant Protestantism objected to \u2014 that of Marguerite Marie a la Coque on a small pedestal above the chimney piece \u2014 a rosary blessed by his Holiness the Pope suspended on a wall opposite, and on one of the little side tables, piles on piles of books of French fashions, more frivolous, one was tempted to suppose, than their English copies. In this incongruous little room the women of the party were destined to receive a new shock. Pat thought fit to mention his name and calling: to his landlord, and Georgie, for one, could not believe her ears when she found that her brother had forgotten his surname though not his calling.

Georgie glanced at Agnes ; she seemed fit to sink into the ground with shame and misery. Oh ! the degradation of a feigned name, a disguised personality, the glib resource of rogues and vagabonds. Georgie"], [56, "44 SAPPHIRA. read the truth in her sister's face and was startled and staggered ; she grew scarlet and hung her head. The next moment she recalled that it might be a necessary precaution in their strange position, which was yet to be accounted for. Pat must feel bound to take the precaution, yet he had not the appearance of a fugitive from law and justice, or of a swindler of his neighbours, in taking it. It was with a defiant rather than a furtive glance around that he uttered what was neither more nor less than an assumed name. If Pat was \" Dr. Raimes,\" then, to maintain the harmony of his narrative without elaborate mis -statements, which Georgie could not help calling \" more lies,\" she and Agnes and their mother must all be Raimeses, though the women could not even claim the title as a middle name.

It was awkward, of course, and disturbing to one's dignity to be thus verbally masquerading and losing one's nominal identity ; w*hat was a great deal worse, it was not true : that was the sum and substance of the obnoxious offence in Georgie's eyes, but it had to be done sometimes, without doubt. Surely Agnes was exaggerating when she made so much of it \u2014 Agnes, who had taken a nom de plume and called herself as an author \" Judith Westmoreland \" without the smallest scruple.

Mother, mother, what have you done ? \""], [59, "CHAPTER III. \" HIS WIFE ALSO BEING PRIVY TO IT. The question, \" What had Mrs. Baldwin done ? \" could not remain unanswered much longer. Agnes's torturing doubts and suspicions, Georgie's practical common sense, alike demanded an explanation. What happened took place on the even ing of the first Sunday which the family spent at Quatr'eaux, where they arrived on a Friday. The intervening Saturday had been passed in a futile effort to settle down where all were so much out of their element. Pat had walked about pioneering Georgie to the market and the nearest shops, and interpreting between her and the natives. Georgie had unpacked as far as it was possible, after she dis covered to her dismay that there were only"], [60, "48 SAPPHIRA. the smallest cupboards and the tiniest chests of drawers in which to bestow three grow*n-up women's entire suits of wearing apparel, for all the four seasons. She had further exerted herself in the most praisew*orthy manner to lend a habit able, homelike air, to what were to her the gimcrack Frenchified rooms. Happy Georgie, who could occupy and forget her self thus profitably. Agnes had sought to follow Georgie's example as if she were in a dream and did not really know what she did, so that every few minutes she, who had never owned to fatigue, who had been so endless in resource, was fain to fall into a seat, fold her hands in weary wretchedness and look helplessly to Georgie in order to gather what she, Agnes, was to do next. Mrs. Baldwin sat motionless by the un lit stove, as she had been accustomed to sit by the fire generally kept burning for her benefit, even in the summer time, in"], [61, "\"HIS WIFE ALSO BEING PRIVY TO IT.\" 49 the drawing-room at Barnes. She never touched the piece of knitting which Georgie had rather ostentatiously brought in and placed at her mother's elbow. Mrs. Baldwin hardly looked up at all the novelty around her, unless when Agnes w*ent out and in, and then the mother followed the daughter with eyes in whose depths were fathomless depreca tion and longing. Then came Sunday with another variety of strangeness of aspect. All the world of Quatr'eaux, as it seemed to the Bald- Avins, went early to confession and mass, and then spread themselves abroad, im partially, for the purpose of enjoying themselves. The streets were full of people in holiday attire, country people as w*ell as townspeople, come in for their weekly holiday. The restaurants and the wine shops were doing a brisk trade. As the season was summer, httle tables were grouped under the awnings for the accom- VOL. II. 18"], [62, "SAPPHIKA. 50 modation of men who read the newspapers, argued vociferously, drank harmless drinks, smoked and played dominoes. So far as posters could proclaim the fact, the night was going to be a gala one at the little theatre. There was no English church in a town where few English were to be seen. The Baldwins talked of seeking out \" the Temple,\" where, as they understood, the modern representatives of the old Hugue nots continued to worship in more than Puritan plainness and sombreness ; but the strangers had not the spirit to make the move to-day. As the afternoon wore on to evening, a certain hush fell on the merry-makers without, and a corresponding stillness descended on the family party within ; even Pat, who had been fidgeting about after the manner of a young man with nothing to do, gradually sank down into a seat in a window, and lying back, with"], [63, "\"HIS WIFE ALSO BEING PRIVY TO IT.\" 51 his arms folded above his head \u2014 an old attitude of his, listlessly contemplated the passers-by. Georgie, who was the soul of orderly duty, suddenly proposed to read aloud for the edification of the company. \" It will give us more of the feeling of a Sunday, don't you think ? \" she suggested. \" It seems too queer and Bohemian to have no church, no service, and all that stir in the street. I declare there is a brass band coming ; I must wait till it is gone.\" As nobody objected, Georgie read the evening lessons, apparently with satis faction to others as well as to herself, for when she closed her prayer-book, Mrs. Baldwin asked her abruptly to read a chapter in the Bible, naming the 5th chapter of Acts. Georgie turned it up obediently. \" Oh, it is such a dismal chapter,\" she made a httle protest when she saw what she was to read. \" Read it,\" said Mrs. Baldwin briefly. 18\u20142"], [64, "52 SAPPHIRA.

After she had read to the 11th verse, \"And great fear came upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things,\" Mrs. Baldwin agam interposed. \" That will do, Georgie,\" her mother said hi a low tone. She added in a higher key, \" Now* I must speak to you, children, once and for all. I must tell you my temptation and my sin, how I lied like Sapphira and committed a fraud. Oh, God ! If I could but put the memory away from me for ever.\" It was as if a bombshell had fallen into the quiet room, though all present had been waiting, almost wishing, for such an opening. Pat had let his arms drop"], [65, "\"HIS WIFE ALSO BEING PRIVY TO IT.\" 53 during the reading ; he now sat bolt up right and opened his mouth to keep his mother from saying another word. But on second thoughts he forbore. \" Better it should come from herself after all, poor woman ; better for her and for everybody,\" he reasoned to himself. Georgie sat aghast with the Bible on her knee and her finger inadvertently pointed to the words, \" and great fear came upon all.\" Agnes shivered and drew as much as she could out of sight behind the cretonne hangings. Mrs. Baldwin did not flinch from the task she had undertaken. She sat in the midst of them in her widow's weeds, and lifted up her pale face to meet their shrink- ing gaze. \" I must begin at the beginning,\" she said, \" or you will not be able to under stand me, or to make allowance for me, if there is any allowance to be made.

My father's family were poor, though well born, and in my young days it was not held creditable for a gentlewoman to work for her living, as many people now hold it to be. Girls were not glad and proud to do it, as I think the wisest and best of them are in your generation. Besides, I could not have done it ; my accomplish ments were of the flimsiest description. I had been taught nothing useful and nothing thoroughly, for it was supposed that I had not a strong: constitution. Marriage was my one resource, as it was of most girls like me. At least I broke no vows and played no man false, in order to marry Dick Baldwin. It was all the other way. I mean a man had broken his vows to me and played me false \u2014 but I do not wash to rake up the ashes of a past wrong, they are nothing but dead ashes to-day,\" she declared in the same dreary monotone in which she had first spoken, which she"], [67, "\"HIS WIFE ALSO BEING PRIVY TO IT.\" 55 preserved for the most part throughout her statement. \" Your father knew that I had no heart to give him, yet he was will ing to make me his wife, and I consented since he did not ask or desire much from me ; I do not think it was in his nature. He liked my person, approved of my manners, and fancied that I should discharge the duties of the mistress of his establish- ment as well as most women. I married him in order to secure a provision and shelter for the years which were to come. I never doubted that he knew it and did not object to the terms of our contract. He never required more from me than I gave him as his due ; he never accused me of failing him. We were not at all alike in character and tastes ; we were not much together except in company. We fell apart naturally ; but there w*as no wrang ling or quarelling between us, such as one might have found between more closely attached couples, or couples that have"], [68, "SAPPHIRA. 56 begun their wedded life more closely at tached.

It is commonly held that it is so, and it may be true in some cases. But your father was not fond of children. He had a certain pride and pleasure in you, I will not deny that, especially in Pat as his son and heir. I used to thmk his preference for the boy was unjust to Agnes, who was the first-born, and was always very fond of her father.\" \" Don't, mother, don't ! \" cried Agnes passionately.

She put up her trembling hands as if to stop her ears, and the signet ring would have slipped from her finger had she not caught it and"], [69, "\"HIS WIFE ALSO BEING PRIVY TO IT.\" 57 held it fast. Her mother's heavy sigh was the only notice which she took of the interruption. \" Your father left you very much to me, who could not have too much of you. I was happy then, yes, I can honestly say I was happy, when you were all young,\" she said Avith a softening of her mask of a face and one yearning backward look, as if from wintry skies, at the perished summer of her life. \" Then your father's affairs fell into disorder,\" she began again with dogged resolution. \" The great firm in which he was a partner were in straits, and I knew it. I began to fear, night and day, not that I should be robbed of the safety, ease and luxury which I had bought at the highest price I could pay, but that you, my children, whom I had loved better than myself \u2014 I can say that also, after I have disgraced and ruined you \u2014 whom I had born as I believed to a liberal competence, if not to vast wealth,"], [70, "58 SAPPHIRA. to the bright and bountiful lot of those who are regarded as the favourites of fortune, because they are independent of her smiles and frowns \u2014 should be cast on the charity of a cold world, driven to struggle and fight for a bare subsistence, very likely trampled down in the fight. It half maddened me to think of that. I had looked forward to such a different destiny for you. Yet I could spare pity for your poor father ; I think I was never so near caring for him as when I saw him beaten by cruel odds, borne down by the terrible unrelieved pressure. He was soon beyond my pity \u2014 so far as desiring it or prizing it went. He had been fast growing old before the full weight of his misfortunes came upon him, and it turned the balance ; he became imbecile where he had before been infirm.

Straggling rays of the sun were piercing their way through such a mist as we often have on a fine morning, and were falling on torn sedges and trodden-down grass, on the oars flung about anywhere, on Tweedside Johnnie standing as if he were bereft of his senses, looking down fixedly at a dripping figure in w*et, dis ordered clothes, lying motionless at his feet.

While she spoke she rose up hastily in the gathering twilight, came towards Mrs. Baldwin, and put her hand gently on the other's shoulder. \" Poor mother ! you were hard beset and taken unawares ; you cared so much for your children, who were not able to help you then, who w*ere only a burden to you.

The mother Agnes Baldwin had adored was a devoted, unworldly woman, living under the shadow of a great sorrow\u2014 so sacred in its character that its very presence \u2014 while it had sub dued, had exalted the atmosphere of the house in wdiich she dwelt. This was a woman who had shrunk in craven fear, under the shadow* of a base sin and the chance of its detection, whose neighbour hood could bring nj blessing with it, either for herself or others. She had been cold-blooded and calculating from the be ginning. She had sold herself to a love less marriage and a luxurious home, secure and safe from change ; she had so dreaded poverty for herself and her children that she had preferred to stain herself with the g;uilt of a common har and thief. Ct It was well-nigh incredible to Agnes that any woman should so have quailed and sunk before the bare anticipation of that poverty which Agnes, in her tender"], [90, "78 SAPPHIRA. girlhood, had defied and scorned, which she had taken a high-hearted pleasure . in holding at bay, and fighting off, in a hand to-hand fight, by her unaided exertions. It was not to be thought that she could realize that there was another poverty in finitely more grievous than any she had known, which she had encountered at once so loftily and lightly in the gifts of her youth, health, strength, and unusual mental endowments. What had she experienced of the bondage of debt, the pinch of ab solute want, the misery of witnessing the sufferings of her nearest and dearest with out the power of helping them ? And what she had not seen she could not in this instance conceive. This mother of hers who was not her mother, had come under the iron arm of the law which was a protection against evil-doers.

The story w*as not so horrible as Sam Scrope had surmised when Agnes spurned his surmises, but it was more sordid, more repellant in its callous mercenariness. Agnes's righteous soul, righteous over much, sickened at the audacious un righteousness of the deed. o \" There must be no more of this,\" Pat was enjoining as he struck a hght. He was speaking in the new authoritative tones, which he had only begun to exer cise lately, of the natural protector and champion of the women around him. \" It is idle and worse than useless to dwell on w*hat had much better be forgotten.

She bustled about obeying Pat's orders, and carried off their mother, spent and unresisting, to her room.

It caused Pat, who had taken, in his uncer tainty how to set about seeking for an employment, to haunt the principal chem ist's shop in Quatr'eaux, to hurry home and burst into the little sitting-room above the milliner's shop with an alacrity which startled but did not alarm the occupants. The animation was not out of keeping with the manliness which had matured in a day, while it was very different from any frame of mind its owner had displayed recently. \" Here's a lucky coincidence !

This Dr. Hubert is a queer customer \u2014 that is, he is highly re spected and reckoned very skilful, but he does not much care for his profession, except as a means of scientific research. He is a greater chemist than he is a doc tor, and a still greater botanist and en tomologist. He has a passion for hunting, which sounds odd in a Frenchman, and hunts twice a week in the season, in spite of his patients, to whom never theless, and to the poor especially, he is very kind and liberal, or else you may be sure they would dismiss him for some nincompoop of a doctor who would be always at their beck and call. Dr. de Vitre is a man about forty, unmarried, living in a big, empty-looking house, in one of the oldest, best courtyards, near the Cathedral.

It seems he also remarked me with a similar impression, and when I went to Colline's shop this morning I found this note awaiting me. Did you ever see such small fine hand-"], [97, "PAT AND GEORGIE COME TO THE FRONT. 85 writing \u2014 and from the fist of a mighty hunter ? Colline had told him I w^as likely to settle for the present at Quatr'- eaux and that I was looking out for em- ployment in the medical profession. Dr. de Vitre said he knew my face when he saw it again. He had been in Paris and had filled the place of one of the exam- iners \u2014 who was called away for the day, w*hen I took my degree. Dr. de Vitre was good enough to say that he was pleased with the manner in which I had passed my examination, and as he re- quired an assistant, since he could not be tied down by the drudgery of the pro- fession, he was willing to engage my services on trial, if I could produce testimonials of character and if we agreed as to terms.

'It is good news,\" pronounced Georgie excitedly. \" Isn't it, Agnes ? \" \" Of course,\" said Agnes, seeking to rid herself of the dispirited languor which was weighing her down. She was look ing at the others with sad and w*ondering eyes. It was bad enough to have sur vived such a blow as they had sustained, but it was incredible that the rest of them \u2014 even her mother, wdiose eyes Agnes had never yet dared to meet since Mrs. Baldwin had told them all \u2014 should be pre pared to enter with zest on what mattered so httle as an engagement for Pat. \" He must be a nice man,\" speculated Georgie confidently."], [99, "PAT AND GEORGIE COME TO THE FRONT. 87 \" I hke that,\" cried Pat, with the first genuine laugh which they had heard \u2014 for an age as it seemed, and the sound struck so strangely on the ears of the hearers that they looked deprecatingly first at him and then at each other. \" I can tell you he is not at all a lady's man. Colline, who is a dapper, dandified wretch, like the husband of the milliner in the lower regions, says the doctor never goes into ladies' company at home, and not often into men's, unless in the pursuit of sport. He is afflicted with mauvaise honte, and is half a boor, half a bear. At the same time he is supposed to be very much under the thumb of madame, his widowed sister, and he makes spoiled puppets of his httle nieces, her daughters.\" \" And is not that nice ? \" demanded Georgie. \" For the rest,\" said Pat, paying no heed to the interruption, \"he is a man of science and a philosopher.\""], [100, "88 SAPPHIRA. \"A little awful, no doubt, to poor stupid women, but it ought to be nice to a student just off the irons, like you,\" insisted Georgie. \" I should expect you to appreciate that.\" \" So I do most heartily,\" Pat assured her. \" But look here, Georgie, you must not run off with the idea that the ' medecin malgre lui ' is going to endow me with a thumping salary \u2014 nothing of the kind.

It flashed upon him in an instant what she was thinking of. and he acknowledged she had good reason for her dismay. \" I did not remember that,\" he said quickly, in an undertone, in answer to her look ; then he added more slowly : \" Though he knew my face I am not aware that he recalled my name.

She did not interpose ; she had forfeited her right, many a year before, to counsel her children. The brother and sister stood apart for a moment, during w*hich Pat's mobile face grew set and stern. \" I cannot publish her error and endanger her safety,\" he muttered in abrupt sentences ; \"no one could ask it of me, while there is not any reason, that I know of, why he should betray us. He looked a gentleman, if a queer one, and he bears a high character in the town.

Yet something in her words or her look displeased him. He unloosed the clasp of the hand which she had laid on his arm. \" You forget,\" he said coldly, \"that there may be danger to her in our thus appeasing our consciences and being consoled \u2014 so far at her expense. We are bound not to lose sight of her in whatever we say or do. I cannot believe there is much danger, else I would bite my tongue out before I said anything. But if this Dr. de Vitre should turn out an inquisitive gossip he might ferret out more than I choose to tell of the tale which she has thought fit to conceal all these years. Mind, I still think it well for her and all to make the admission I"], [104, "92 SAPPHIRA. am prepared to make. But it strikes me, Agnes, you lose sight of her and forget what is owing to her, when all is said and done.\" She fell back at his rebuke. Was it true that she lost sight of her mother, that she forgot what was due to her motherhood in condemning her lament able lapse from truth and womanliness ? If so she could not help it, her whole nature was in revolt \u2014 but what a miserable girl she was to be harsh and pitiless to her own mother. \"It is only right and natural that madame as well as monsieur the doctor should see you before he engages you,\" Georgie told him when he turned back from his consultation with Agnes in the window. \" I should have no objection for madame to look me over also if that would be any use.\" \" Not the slightest,\" asserted Pat a little sarcastically ; \" she w^ould simply be"], [105, "PAT AND GEORGIE COME TO THE FRONT. 93 tempted to regard you as a forward, strong minded English girl.\" Pat reported himself at Dr. de Vitre's house, but of what passed privately be tween him and the doctor Pat did not speak even to Agnes. She could only judge of the result from the fact that the engagement was concluded, and her brother was in fairly good spirits and more like himself again. He was quite ready to talk of what he called \" the barracks of a house \" in the quaint court, with trees in the background, a flower border and a draw w*ell. The floors of the rooms were painfully pohshed and dangerously slippery, but the staircase \u2014 he wished Georgie could see the stairs.

For her restless fingers were at rest ; there was no further call for the incessant motion which had formed at once a safety valve and a veil for the troubled spirit, behind the working hands and clicking needles. It appeared as if Quatr'eaux wrould have been a stony desert to Georgie, without a weekly glimpse of Pat and an opportunity to chatter to him. But she w*as soon to have another resource. When she was out on her marketing expeditions she was fond of just taking a look at Pat's quar ters. She would slacken her steps and watch surreptitiously for the chance open ing of the great gates and the revelation of the cool spacious court with its gum cistus bushes, sunflowers and tubs with aloes, which she was sure Madame Para dol cherished as a mark of gentility, and its dog couch for the doctor's huge mastiff"], [108, "96 SAPPHIRA. \" Lion,\" which Pat said wras to keep away tramps like Georgie.

To serve for an excuse to pass the place daily, no less than to attempt something on her own account, Georgie collected all the drawing and paint ing materials among her luggage, and boldly attacked the Cathedral. She intrepidly sketched and worked up little views upon views of the sculptured front, the grey towers round w*hich the ivy clung and the rooks circled, the rose window, the cleristory, the baptistery, the chapter house,"], [109, "PAT AND GEORGIE COME TO THE FRONT. 97 the pilgrims' tombs.

Her sun might have set, her spirit be broken, but it would be something to have Pat and Georgie fulfil her expectations. It was intolerable to have Georgie continue to talk mock-modest affected nonsense about not being a painter. \" I know best,\" said Georgie with decision, shaking her comely head philo sophically over the washing of her brushes : \" I tell you I am not the real article, but I know it when I see it.

The out-of-door occupation superseded for the moment the household cares, and was at least a fine promoter of the worker's health of body and peace of mind.

He suspected there was danger of her getting more and more absorbed in her special grievance, and drifting farther and farther from general interests. She was not her mother's daughter for nothing. He came one Sunday evening to lend himself to a proposal of Madame Paradol's, which he thought might be good for his sister. Madame had asked him, after the most polite fashion, whether his sister, who drew and painted and consented to dis pose of her work, might not be induced to give madame's little girls lessons daily, in English and music more particularly. Madame had heard of the thoroughness of an English education, so she had no"], [121, "ALTERED RELATIONS. 109 doubt that the young lady who painted to a marvel also knew how to play and sing, while it went without saying that she must be well acquainted with her mother tongue. Madame would be charmed to have the benefit of an English instructress for her daughters, and she ventured to trust the benefit might be mutual. She would do every thing in her power to make the young lady happy and to render her stay in a foreign town, where she knew no body out of the circle of her estimable family, less triste than it must other wise be. \" In short,\" Pat announced to the estimable family, \" madame is so greedy of any advantage for those mites of hers that she is willing to include their governess in those Paradol-de-Vitre gaieties from which I, wretched mortal, have been hitherto banished.\" \" But how can I go to madame's,"], [122, "110 SAPPHIRA. Pat,\" objected Georgie, \" when I have all these commissions on my hands ? \" In spite of the objection it was clear that she had no disinclination to accept the overture.

She says she cannot write since she came abroad ; don't you say so, Agnes ? \" appeahng to her sister, who had hardly roused herself from the silent sorrowful abstraction becoming habitual to her. \" You have not even attempted to put down the verses of a song to set to music, such as you used to knock off \u2014 in Pat's phrase \u2014 in a couple of hours ; you have not so much as opened the piano"], [123, "ALTERED RELATIONS. 111 which I took it upon me to hire, to try if it would inspire you.

Mrs. Baldwin looked up quickly with a rare flash of indignation in her eyes. \" AVhy set Agnes to a task which is so unworthy of her ? \" she asked sharply. \" Because she needs the task,\" said Pat quietly, and his mother said no more, though it wras plain she groaned in spirit. \" Between you and me, Geo,\" Pat"], [124, "112 SAPPHIRA. told his younger sister the next time they were alone together, \" if Agnes is not roused she will go the wray of the poor mater.

Its clear ringing notes were grown hoarse and husky. Still, these Englishwomen have consciences, and this one had her value as a teacher. Another thing to be noted, Agnes without her enthusiasm, her radiant faith in God and man, was but a dull, wdiite-faced, red haired girl, singularly without charm in Madame Paradol's estimation, and there fore, as madame congratulated herself, a perfectly safe person to be introduced into the household the head of which was an eccentric bachelor. Then it fell on a week-day when Pat was not expected in the Httle side street in which the family lodged, that he wralked in, mounting the stair two steps at a time, though the weather was very hot. He had a light in\" his eye and a colour in his cheek which indicated that he brought news for them ; something out"], [129, "ALTERED RELATIONS. 117 of what was rapidly becoming their com mon round of duties and obligations had happened. \" What is it ? \" inquired Georgie, look ing up from the bit of pillow-lace she was learning to weave.

On the contrary Mrs. Baldwin and Agnes, who had come in a little before Pat, sat staring in silence with a scared look on their faces, which brought out the latent Hkeness between them start- lingly for an histant. \" Mother,\" said Pat, standing before Mrs. Baldwin, \" there was one topic which I thought never to revive between us, no, nor in anybody else's hearing.

As for Agnes she was thinking of things of which there could be no undoing, no restitution. Could the silence of law and justice for evermore give her back the tender, ad miring thoughts of her mother which she had cherished six months ago ? \" The question is,\" said Pat rapidly, almost blusteringly, as if he were in haste to finish the discussion, \" are we to return to England with the next train and steamer ? Are we to forego all the advantages we have painfully scraped together in our expatriation ? \" \" It must be as you and the girls will, Pat,\" said Mrs. Baldwin. \"It is suffi cient for me to be with my children \u2014 that they do not cast me off.\" \" No, indeed,\" said Georgie emphati cally, \" and I for one don't wish to go back to England.

So England sank down beneath the Baldwins' horizon, and all they heard of it was in an occasional friendly letter from"], [133, "ALTERED RELATIONS. 121 Sam Scrope to Pat. Once or twice Sam inclosed a letter from one or other of his good-natured sisters to Georgie, but they were letters difficult to answer, because they were evidently written in a state of bewilderment, on the writer's part, as to wrhat had taken the Baldwins to Nor- mandy and what was keeping them there. But though Pat did not return to Eng land he w*as shrewd enough and courageous enough to take a step, which should render his staying away, thenceforth, entirely a matter of choice and not of compulsion. He promptly resumed the latter half of his name, candidly telling all whom the change could concern that he had merely dropped the Baldwin half, for a purpose and a season. He was Baldwin, and of course his mother and sisters were Bald- wins likewise \u2014 an assertion which they ratified, Mrs. Baldwin with her new sense of thankfulness, Georgie joyfully shaking herself, as if to get rid of false impressions"], [134, "122 SAPPHIRA. and re-establish her identity, even Agnes brightening a httle as she glanced at her signet ring.

For that matter some of the inhabitants \u2014 including the man milliner and his wife \u2014 cheerfully adapted themselves to the situation, and looked and spoke as if it was the natural and usual arrangement for English residents to try living in France under aliases. Madame was the most disturbed by the transformation ; it shook her faith in the rampant respectability of \" these English,\" though it did not cause her to have no farther need for Agnes's services as gover ness to madame's daughters. But as for Dr. de Vitre, he received and adopted the correction in the address of his assistant with the greatest serenity.

Nothing of greater importance had taken place quite recently than that Georgie had received an additional commission or two for choice bits of the Cathedral ; Pat had been introduced by Dr. de Vitre \u2014 a mark of attention which \" little Baldwin \" had the grace and per ception to regard as a high compliment\u2014 to some congenial spirits where the doctor was concerned, one or two savants and natura-"], [136, "124 SAPPHIRA. lists, as devoted and single-hearted as him self, established in the neighbourhood ; Agnes had appeared occasionally in madame's salon, or gone with her and the children on their excursions into the forest, or to the country houses in the vicinity, without deriving a tithe of the pleasure \u2014 she who had once been so receptive of impressions \u2014 which Georgie would have experienced in similar circumstances. Mrs. Baldwin was out of count as she had been for many a day \u2014 nay, with the second crisis of her life past, with nothing more to fear, as there was nothing more to hope, the grey of the coming night was fast descending on her. Mrs. Baldwin and her daughter were together in their httle salon, Mrs. Baldwin quiescent in her chair, her thin blanched hands resting passively in the lap of her black gown, her dim eyes looking up into the unfathomable twilight sky. Georgie, who had set up a miniature jardiniere, was employing a few spare"], [137, "\"LET ME DIE FOR MY LITTLE AGNES.\" 125 moments in snipping off dead leaves and blossoms, poking up the earth between, watering from her tiny watering-pan and generally tidying and refreshing her lili putian parterre. Agnes was correcting a handful of exercises in half-text, the fruit of the Demoiselles Paradol's labours. In order to help her in her task in the twilight, she had lit the lamp on a little round table by her side, and the light was falling not on the exercises alone but also on her tall slight figure and bent head. She was not dressed according to her inclinations, which might have pointed to heavy black, if not to sackcloth and ashes. She wore a white mushn frock in honour of a half- holiday and a reunion at madame's, from which Agnes had just been liberated. One moment all was apparently cheerful content or despairing resignation, peace and industry in the httle room, the next all wras wild confusion and terror."], [138, "126 SAPPHIRA. By an involuntary movement Agnes knocked over the rickety table and dashed the lamp to the ground. There was the clash of the fall, half lost in the stunning report of an explosive spirit, and the dazzling flash and strong fumes of a pyramid of flame, where Agnes had been thrown down by the shock. Georgie started round to fly to her sister's aid, snatching up the woollen table cover and calling for help as she did so. But before she could reach Agnes, Mrs. Baldwin was by her daughter, dragging her aside, folding her close in the mother's arms, wrapping the mother's dress round her to extinguish the fire which was catch ing the girl's clothes. In another instant the man-milliner and his partner in his business and his affections rushed upon the scene, summoned by Georgie's screams, and by means of poker and shovel and wet blankets beat and stamped and stifled the enemy, till nothing was left of his crest of"], [139, "\"LET ME DIE FOR MY LITTLE AGNES.\" 127 flame save a tall column of dense white smoke which continued for some time to rise mysteriously from the floor, out of which an Arabian geni might have been expected to step at any moment. Mademoi selle was saved, the house and business were saved, the man-milliner continued to cry triumphantly. Georgie stopped him and begged him to fetch her brother or Dr. de Vitre if Dr. Baldwin was not at hand, without loss of time. Agnes wras absolutely unscorched, though the skirt of her dress was singed and shrivelled up, yet she lay insensible with a face like marble, and half open, unseeing eyes. Mrs. Baldwin's woollen gown was posi tively charred and her hands and wrists were badly burned, as Georgie could see to her dismay, but her mother uttered no com plaint and gave no sign of pain ; there was even the faintest smile of self devotion hovering about her parted lips,"], [140, "128 SAPPHIRA. while she kept muttering, \"Let me die for her, yes, let me die for my little Agnes,\" as she hung over her daughter. Pat came immediately, accompanied by Dr. de Vitre, because of the imperative, alarming nature of the summons. Neither of the men made hght of the accident, or said there was no call for the presence of both of them. Pat was as serious as a judge, though he overcame his natural distress. Dr. de Vitre lost his shyness and discomfiture at intruding on com- parative strangers. He was all alertness and interest as when he was carried along in the spirit of the chase, or absorbed in the solution of some scientific puzzle. \" Did you ever see your sister hke this before, Baldwin ? \" he inquired briskly. \" Never,\" answered Pat briefly. \" Has she suffered from any illness, or sus tained any shock previous to this accident, which might intensify its effects ? \" To hear him one would not have supposed that"], [141, "\"LET ME DIE FOR MY LITTLE AGNES.\" 129 he had been in the habit of seeing Agnes almost every day for a period of weeks. But his nieces' governess, even his assist ant's sister, was somebody very different from an interesting patient. \" No illness, but I have feared the gradual continuous lowering of her system after a family trial which she had to face,\" said Pat with an effort. \" Oh ! \" exclaimed the older man, re- membering something, while a flash of his black eyes took in Mrs. Baldwin's bowed, arrested figure. \" But that, though it is to be regretted in itself, like any other misadventure, is rather a hopeful element in the present case, it may account for the extreme prostration, even for the pro- longed insensibility.

She had only once before obeyed Pat, without stopping to talk the matter over and dis pute his inferences, but now she deferred to him implicitly and treated him, not to say Dr. de Vitre, as if he were a Solon. It was about Agnes clearly that the doctors were most concerned, and it was to her that they devoted then* chief at tention. Indeed, Mrs. Baldwin would hardly allow them to do otherwise ; she suffered her burns to be dressed with scarcely subdued impatience, and did not"], [143, "\"LET ME DIE FOR MY LITTLE AGNES.\" 131 take time to express any relief she felt, so intent was she on transferring all the care to Agnes. \" Go to your sister, Pat. Dr. de Vitre, it is my daughter who needs you,\" was her constant cry. For even after Agnes had partially recovered, her breath came in such little trembling gasps, her pulse was so weak and flutter ing, she had such a far-away look in her blue-grey eyes, her consciousness con tinued so obscured, that it seemed for many hours as if she were still hovering on the border-land between hfe and death ; as if the least untoward touch would precipitate her over the brink, and the greatest efforts and precautions were wanted to fan the life which had ebbed so low.

It was on Mrs. Baldwin's case that the two doctors' energies were bent after all, and bent in vain. She grew worse in stead of better, and so rapidly that her medical attendants recognized her constitution had been breaking up before hand, and that her condition, whether overlooked as it had been, or perceived from the first, would have been to a great extent hopeless. She was in no pain and she was happy, for the first time for many a year, Pat could assure poor Georgie ; in fact the sick woman's own words often murmured were all to the same effect : \"I am so glad to be let die for little Agnes.

None but you, mother, could have done it ; I might have been burnt to death but for you, though Georgie would have done her best ; still none but you would have forgotten every thing for me, and I \u2014 I have caused you so much pain.\" \" Agnes ! \" cried her mother doubtfully."], [149, "\"LET ME DIE FOR MY LITTLE AGNES.\" 137 \" Why, how big you have grown, and you are not like yourself. It is not only that you are thin, you look so sad, and you are hardly ever sad, and never, never dull.\" Then as if a gleam of intelligence recalled all to her for a momentary space, \" I have been dreaming,\" she said, \" but I am awake now.\" She smiled again and re peated with a difference : \" Let me die for my big Agnes, my grown-up girl, my eldest daughter, who is so good and so clever, the stay and bread-winner of the family.\" \" No, no, mother, it is all changed,\" said Agnes sorrowfully. \" It is Pat and Georgie who are doing almost everything now.

She saw more clearly than Agnes saw, in that light, which is neither piercingly clear nor bewilderingly dark, that prevails where the world of sense and the world of spirit meet. Death, and only such a death, could give back to Agnes the mother of her youth. \" Sing something to me, Agnes,\" said Mrs. Baldwin wistfully, rous ing herself once, and only once again, from the billows and depths of unconsciousness which were closing over her. Agnes hesi tated, and had nearly broken down. Then with a great effort she sang, and her voice sounded through the httle room with something of its old penetrating sweetness : Faint and weary, lone and dreary, Through the desert Thou did'st go.\" In the company of One who carried our"], [152, "140 SAPPHIRA. griefs and bore our sorrows, and was bruised for our iniquities, the traveller departed on her far journey. When all was over, though the very flood-gates of Agnes's nature were opened and she wept till she could wreep no more, she was at peace. The thought of her mother who had died to rescue her effaced the memory of that other woman w*ho had looked down on the drowned body of her husband, and calculated how the conceal ment of the nature of his death might secure to her and her children ease and comfort, instead of the abject poverty she shrank from. The ugly phantom w*hich had pursued Agnes, the horror and re pugnancy which had haunted and crushed her, were gone never to return. Her mother's errors were indeed blotted out so far as Agnes Baldwin was concerned.

And when time, the healer, had done his work, Agnes's voice broke forth agam, clear and full, with a pathos which it had not held before, in \"psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.\" Her pen ran rapidly over the paper once more, working for bread, but still eager as ever"], [154, "142 SAPPHIRA. to express her conceptions of the true and the beautiful \u2014 which are one and the same.

Fortunately she had suspected its ephemeral nature from the beginning. The furore for her pretty wishy-washy httle sketches had passed away with the old bishop's jubilee.

The truth was, she feared, to begin with, that she would lose altogether the unusual advantage in Quatr'eaux of being able to secure, at a very moderate salary, the services of a well-trained English day governess for her daughters. A httle later, to demur would simply have been to pre cipitate an appalling catastrophe, which as yet only lurked in the background, and madame was far too politic to ruin herself in this silly, rash way. Dr. de Vitre had from the first approved of Georgie as Agnes's successor.

He took to Georgie as he had taken to Pat, at the first glance. He was pleased with her method of teaching his nieces, and when he had overcome his shyness in addressing her he found her a wonderfully clear-headed available auxiliary, during her brother's inevitable absence, in the doctor's innumerable scientific experi ments. Madame, the experimenter's sister, was of little use in this respect, and detested the job, while Felice and Nicole w*ere too young to act as her substitutes. It was decidedly against madame's judg ment that her daughters' instructress should also be her brother's assistant. However, the servants bungled, and now and then the outwardly gruff but inwardly mild savant stood at bay and defied his tyrant's authority, especially on any question which had to do with his beloved science.

He showed himself master of his pro fession in parrying all her attempts to get at the bottom of such mystery as still attached to the Baldwins, who had begun by being Raimes at Quatr'eaux and had offered no explanation of their change of name. Though madame was baffled hi her investigations, she was quite ready to institute special festivities in the baffler's honour, as soon as she learnt that he was not only an avocat in London, but the owner of an estate in the country. What benefit was to accrue to madame from the discovery it would be hard to dis cover.

Certainly she inaugurated half days in the forest, when it was glorious in its gloom under the magic of early summer, and evenings round Dr. de Vitre' s microscope, when the doctor was half badgered, half coaxed into ex pounding the world of wonders which the little instrument had brought to light. Such attractions, though they were not much to madame's mind hi themselves, did not fail even in Quatr'eaux to secure very respectable gatherings, scientific and otherwise.

She went with her brother and sister, lionizing him and doing what they could of sight- seeing in the Cathedral and other old churches, to every quaint noticeable point in the market and the streets, and to the promenade with seats, a couple of fountains and three statues on the edge of the forest.

Since Agnes was the person in the little family group who, if not the least engaged, had the most command of her hours and occupations, the duty devolved mainly on her, somewhat to the scandal of the man milliner and his wife, of bearing Sam Scrope company and rendering his stay at Quatr'eaux as pleasant to him as possible.

Agnes alone continued so httle ahve to what was in the air that it was a considerable shock to her when Sam Scrope told her, one day, in a few words, that he had come across the Channel to ask her whether she would be his wife. Her first impulse was to recoil from the proposal. \" No, no,\" she cried, covering her face with her hands for an instant, since there was nobody by where the pair sat, on the farthest seat on the promenade, by the edge of the"], [168, "156 SAPPHIRA. forest. \"Do you think that I could ever bear to carry her pitiful story into another household ? \" Then he remonstrated with her in his strong direct man's way. \" Agnes, if I and my suit are distasteful to you, that is one thing, and there is no more to be said.

The value of land had so fallen at home that the greater part of the income he derived from Scrope Hall, subject to the usual deductions, went to furnish his mother's jointure and his sisters' portions.

He continued re solute in pushing his fortune as a barrister ; but pleading at the bar was slow work, unless where there were stupendous talents or overwhelming influence.

At the same time he began to fear it would be long \u2014 longer than he had rashly hoped, before he would be able to offer any woman he cared for a share hi such a home, as he could honestly say was worth her acceptance.

He was enamoured of the sciences of which physiology and anatomy were handmaids instead of the sciences being their hand maids. He had no great fancy for bourgeois provincial society, bristling with small etiquettes and pretensions and keen rivalries, in wdiich Madame Paradol loved to take the lead. But he had the greatest respect and regard for several of the local savants with their families to whom he had been privileged to receive introductions. He could not say enough in praise of the learning and sagacity of the savants, which were as profound as their menages were simple, with an almost patriarchal simplicity.

It might be that he bartered them all the more cheerfully because a poor \" saw bones\" was not likely to have sumptuous feasts pressed upon him, and Scrope must have attained the bench at least before their relationship was a carte blanche to rich men's tables. He left these and other good things to Brother Sam. He protested it was not because the grapes were sour,. but on account of a certain Gallic levity which had got into his blood, that he con nected aldermanic turtle with vulgarity and heaviness, and bread and cheese with divine philosophy.

As far as her small experience w*ent, men and women were very much the same in every chmate and under every variety of condi tion. She had no objection to savants, indeed she had the deepest veneration for them, though she was not learned herself, but she thought the family of the principal notaire \u2014 in which there were no learned gentlemen, and for that matter no learned ladies with ill- made bodices, clumsy bottines, and mismanaged hair, was very nice indeed.

She should not be surprised to hear that Pat had forgotten something in his dinner or sup per of herbs \u2014 a basin of excellent soup, or trout cutlets, or a fricassee fowl and mushrooms. But that was neither here nor there. What was more to the purpose was that Dr. de Vitre himself was not such a barbarian as Pat proposed to become. The doctor had a great deal to do, and his favourite relaxation was sport, still he was generally present at his sister's recep tions. He had even gone out a little"], [180, "168 SAPPHIRA. lately \u2014 to the ball at the notaire's and to more than one pic-nic in the forest ; she had heard him say that Ahx Surenne and Marie Meudon were pretty girls.

That meant doctors of medicine like him and Dr. Pierre, who should in time relieve him of his practice and leave him at liberty to hunt foxes, hares and rabbits, and chase butterflies and beetles, every hour of the twenty-four.

Agnes was ever so much cleverer in other things, but she could not be trusted in dress and such trifles. It was not to be supposed that Sam Scrope, though he might blossom into the most erudite and astute of judges, could direct his wife \u2014 as some men were said to do in books, in her selection of frocks and disposal of furniture. Agnes listened to the two, earnestly striving after impartiality in judging what was best for them, and in not being biassed by her natural longing to have them near her. Then the announcement of Georgie's approaching departure in company with her sister for England for a time, produced a great storm and positive upheaval of the very foundations of the family hi the Maison de Vitre. The storm was by no means confined to the youthful bosoms of Felicite and Nicolaise, yet they were much"], [182, "170 SAPPHIRA. more disconsolate at being separated for a few months from their lively English friend, than they had been when they had stolen about on tip-toe and whispered in awe-struck voices that the English made moiselle \u2014 the first English mademoiselle, who was so gentle and triste \u2014 had set herself and madame her mother on fire (their mother had said nobody could ever tell what these English, the quietest, most decorous of them, would do) and both were going to die as a result of the con flagration. It w*as among the elders of the household that the tempest raged most violently. Madame Paradol wept passion ately where her httle girls only sighed; and the deep voice of Dr. de Vitre was distin guished, raised in wrathful protest, as it had seldom been heard in his sister's company. The sequel to the disturbance wras that Madame Paradol suddenly set off with her children to a sea-bathing resort within half a day's journey. She was the soul"], [183, "PAT AND GEORGIE'S AFFAIRS. 171 of politeness as a rule, notwithstanding she failed to call on the demoiselles Bald win before starting, in order to take leave of both sisters and to offer her final felici- tations to the elder. The next scene in the drama was the arrival of Pat, convulsed with silent laughter and also not without a sense of personal importance. \" I never expected to be sent on such an errand,\" he told Agnes and Georgie in confidence the moment he entered. The former was in the pleasant flutter of looking out for Sam Scrope, who was expected to arrive that morning, after having arranged the pre hminaries of the wedding. Georgie, mak ing a virtue of necessity, was examining a small pile of articles belonging to Agnes's trousseau, which had just been sent up from the shop below, preparatory to their being deposited in her trunk. \" What is it, Pat ? who is sending you on an errand ? wiiere are you going ? \""], [184, "172 SAPPHIRA. inquired Agnes, just half turning round from the window by which she wTas standing, and sparing him only a portion of her attention. But Georgie sprang up from her task of spreading out gloves, unfolding ribbons and patting lace like an expert.

Agnes stood listening to her sister, open eyed and open-mouthed as Georgie herself used to stand when anything happened to astonish her. Agnes actually forgot that Sam Scrope might be turning into the street at that moment. Pat, who was more behind the scenes, was taking stock of the situation, and enjoying it without reservations. \" You do not mean to say, Georgie \u25a0\" began Agnes. \" I do mean to say, Agnes.\" Georgie turned the tables, her whole face again dimpling over with fun. \" Georgie thinks you think there ought to be only one marriage in the family, and that yours,\" said Pat mischievously.

I don't mean by that assertion,\" she con tinued in a relenting tone, \" to question the north country saying that ' good gear is made up in httle bundles,' or to deny the fact that many of the greatest men in the w*orld have not been giants in stature.\""], [194, "182 SAPPHIRA. \" Pigmies, rather \u2014 but you had better not,\" remarked Pat gloomily. \" Do you, Agnes,\" Georgie returned to her sister, \"wish me to proclaim that I adore Dr. de Vitre, with Pat there grin ning till I'm out of countenance ? \" \" Oh, don't mind me,\" said Pat modestly. \" You are aware I am not here in my own character. I am simply the friend of my principal, presenting my credentials, laying before you his proposals, of which, by the way, you will not suffer me to give you the details \u2014 how he spurns the national habit of requiring a dot with the future Madame de Vitr^ \u2014 what settlements he is willing to make on her.\" \" Oh ! never mind them,\" cried Georgie ; \" we can take them on trust,\" an incon sistent speech on the part of so practical a young woman, which perhaps as much as anything staggered Agnes in her precon ceived opinion of the state of Georgie's feelings."], [195, "PAT'S BLUSHES. 183 \" I want to say how good I mean to be to this unfortunate man whom I am not supposed to be able to love. He is to get his fill of hunting in the season ; so you may look out, Pat, for you will have to do double work on these occasions. He is to have the most expensive of books and instruments in prosecuting his interesting,. invaluable investigations ; you cannot think how stingy and grasping Madame Paradol can be in insinuating to him that he cannot afford this or that help to his studies, that it is selfish of him \u2014 of him, the most generous man, who says the least in the world about his generosity \u2014 to indulge himself in such things, when a httle self denial on her part would make the matter perfectly simple. His assistant in his ex periments is never to be out of the way, or engaged, or weary. He is not to be bored with company he does not care for.

He is to retire to his room, and reappear in the salon just when he likes. The carriage and horses are to be kept for his use more than for any other person's. When he goes into the forest, it is that he may stroll and rest at will, and search for plants and insects, without being forced to return at set hours, or without having guests to attend to all the time. The master of the house is to liave a good time of it, when the house has a new mistress. He is to be the first person instead of the last to be thought of in the estabhshment \u2014 which is the fruit of his honourable exertions.\" Georgie's eyes were sparkling and her breast heaving. It was hardly possible to remain any longer sceptical as to the nature of the emotions w*hich inspired her \" Bravo, Georgie ! \" Pat applauded. \" The boss will be a spoilt man and ruined philosopher in the course of three months ; nevertheless, I hope my wife \u2014"], [197, "PAT'S BLUSHES. 185 w*hen I am in possession of that ticklish commodity \u2014 will go and do hkewise.

Are you going to marry any man hi the teeth of his family's violent objection to the marriage ? \" \" His family consists for the most part of his sister and his nieces, of whom he is the chief support.

I shall dread her rendering you miserable.\" \" She will do nothing of the kind,\" said Georgie with triumphant conviction. \" I am not going to marry madame, I am gohig to marry her brother.

They will be swallowed down for Sam's sake and yours, and perhaps a little for mine, since we were all friends. Mrs. Scrope is a kind woman and the S.'s are good natured girls. You will soon be a first favourite with them ; they will be proud of your writing, too.

But I am not an author or an artist, as I said ; I am nothing out of the common. I have no right to count on people's immediately throwing down their arms or prejudices before my claims.\" Pat had been silent for some time ; he had not even laughed at Georgie's allu sion to only sons and brothers. He was graver than he had looked at any moment during the discussion. \" Perhaps I ought to tell you, girls,\" he said with some hesitation, \" that there really w*as a tre mendous row between Madame Paradol and her brother about this business before she left. They wrere hi the salon with the windows open, and I was in the court fastening up Lion, after I had taken him out for a walk.

I need not say I did what I could to make my vicinity as audible to the lady and gen tleman within, as their conversation was to me. I coughed and hummed a tune, I even tried to make the dog growl or bark, in vain. The speakers were far too much engaged to notice me, and strive as I might I could not help hear ing a part of wrhat they said ; my ears in spite of me seemed to grov? prefer naturally sharp in the fix. I could not shut them to his emphatic statement that he was old enough to judge for hhnself, and knew the woman who could make him happy when he had the good luck to meet her at last.\" \" My dear Pat, there was no occasion for your hearing that against your will, and then repeating it as if you ought to be ashamed of yourself,\" said Georgie"], [202, "190 SAPPHIRA. cheerfully. \" But there is one good thing, you have given me a warning. I have always liked the court immensely. You cannot imagine how I used to break the ninth commandment in connection with the Doctor's court, when the gates were open and I ventured to peep in at its gum-cistus bushes as white as snow of a morning, though the snow had all fled by night, and at the sun flowers which went on in full force without so much as winking their great eyes, first when we came to Quatr'eaux and you had just been en gaged as an assistant to Dr. de Vitre. Now there are magnolias with their mag nificent buds bursting into blossom where there were dainty rosebuds in May. I am as fond of the court as ever, and it is going to be mine \u2014 mine and my husband's \u2014 but I must not forget when we quarrel with the windows open, what capabilities it has for an audience of more"], [203, "PAT'S BLUSHES. 191 than Lion and the blackbirds and night ingales. As for what you were condemned to hear, we can guess it perfectly.\" \" But there was more than what I have told you, Georgie,\" said her brother, shaking his head and looking at her a httle sadly. \" It w*as true also, but none of us would care to guess it. Madame told her brother that he was not only degrading himself by proposing to marry an Englishwoman, a girl without a sou, whose brother had been glad to become his assistant at a paltry salary, while the girl herself had been only too thankful to be governess to madame's children for a still more miserable sum. What was far worse she belonged to a family who by their own showing, from their passing under a false name, were under a dis graceful cloud when they sought refuge at Quatr'eaux.\" \" Oh ! did she say that ? \" exclaimed both the poor girls, hanging their heads."], [204, "192 SAPPHIRA. Georgie's glee and pride in her conquest were summarily extinguished. Agnes was w*ounded to the quick. \" Yes,\" said Pat with more spirit, \" and he told her\u2014 I never heard him in such a passion; I could not have believed him capable of it \u2014 that if she said such a thing agam, he must ask her to leave his house and never to return to it.\" \" He does not know,\" said Georgie faintly ; \"I know he ought to be \u2014 told, and,\" she added more firmly, raising her head and looking at her brother with truthful eyes, \" some day, before he marries me, he shall be.\" \" There will be no need ; he does know,\" said Pat quietly. \"When I saw what might happen, I thought it was only fair to speak out, however hard it might be to say a wrord on the subject, to make him acquainted with the facts, in a confidential moment. I argued with my self that the poor mother w*ould have"], [205, "PAT'S BLUSHES, 193 preferred it so, rather than that there should be any farther misleading and deception, or that the innocent should be blamed.\" Agnes quivered in every nerve. It was she who had urged Pat, long before, not to suffer Dr. de Vitre to engage him under an assumed name without taking the doctor so far into his confidence, though it were at the imminent risk of the gentleman's having nothing farther to say to his would-be assistant. But she had not, up to this moment, laid it to heart that there could be anything be tween Dr. de Vitre and Georgie. There fore it sounded dreadful for Pat or any person concerned to speak of their dead mother's sin and sorrow to a stranger. As if Dr. de Vitre were a stranger in Georgie's eyes ! They had recovered all their courage and confidence, while she leant her elbows on the table and her face on her hands, in order to see and VOL.

He pulled his moustache slowly and muttered softly, ' Poor mother ! poor children ! ' Then he looked me full in the face, and threw out his hand, flinging away the remnant of his cigar. ' Allons, my young comrade, what is that to us ? ' he protested. ' We have nothing to do with it, unless it read us the lesson that the fortunate should, for that very reason, be the more tender to the un fortunate.' \" \" That was like him,\" cried Georgie proudly, clasping her hands ; \" my brave Doctor \u2014 my good honest man.\" When they were all calmed down again, Agnes, struggling still with an elder sister's responsibility, tried to remind Georgie that Madame Paradol, having been"], [207, "PAT'S BLUSHES. 195 left early a widow, had been her brother's companion for a number of years. She had had his ear for all that length of time. She knew his ways. It was not possible that a single rupture, however violent, should destroy the associations and habits of years ; and there was she, bitterly hostile to Georgie, with a power ful weapon to use against her. \" Say no more, Agnes,\" Georgie forbade her impatiently. \" Do you think I would not trust him though a legion of such sisters were drawn up in armed array against me ? As to knowing his ways, I have learnt more of them hi the course of eighteen months, than madame has mastered during their respective hves \u2014 not that she does not care for him in her way, only she cares for herself a great deal more. She has the utmost respect for the family \u2014 the de Vitre family \u2014 and when I am one of them she will not permit any one else to assail me. She 27 2"], [208, "196 SAPPHIRA. will uphold my smallest virtue hi the eyes of the public, till she will begin to see it herself. She is not a fool. She is a very clever woman, in another way from that of her brother. When she finds that the marriage will go on, whatever she says and does, she will make up her mind to it, as to other arrangements which are not entirely to her wishes.\" \" I hope she will, Georgie, since you will put yourself hi her power,\" said Agnes, still speaking dolefully. \" I shall be in nobody's power except my Doctor's, and you do not dare to doubt him ? Besides, madame is not an ill-conditioned person, as you have had an opportunity of judging. She can be a very agreeable companion, and she will be all the more so, when she. consents to occupy her proper place hi her brother's house. She is not a demon, such as one encounters in novels. She is well principled and upright, according to her"], [209, "PAT'S BLUSHES. 197 standard. I only hope I am as conscien tious according to mine. She would no more conspire to murder my character or myself, than I would plot to kill any part of her.\" \" Is she not all the more dangerous for this reason ? \" Agnes ventured to suggest. \" A righteous woman, beyond suspicion, may be the hardest, most vin dictive of any.\" \" She has one very soft spot in her,\" de clared Georgie. \" She is fond, really fond as well as proud of her children. When she discovers that they are as dear to their uncle as ever, and that their new aunt does not fail to love her httle nieces, as madame knows their old governess loved her pupils, Felice and Nicole will be a strong bond between their mother and the English ' ingrate ' and ' traitresses as she may be calling me, hi private, for a week or two. She is not the woman to bear malice where malice is useless, or"], [210, "198 SAPPHIRA. to decline overtures of peace, wdien they will serve her nearest and dearest as well as herself. I mean soon to be on very good terms with madame my sister-in law. I mean more than that,\" cried Georgie with a dash of Agnes's old radiant faith and hope. \" I mean to vanquish her by sheer good-will, to constrain her to be honestly my friend, no less than my re lative by marriage.\" \" You ought to succeed,\" said Agnes admiringly ; \" but there is another obstacle \u25a0there is the difference of creed.\" \" Oh, Agnes, you are not such a bigot as to make that an insuperable objec tion,\" remonstrated Georgie. \" Of course I am sorry we are not of the same mind on that as on other thhigs ; still, surely it is infinitely better that he should be a good Catholic, than that he should be an Agnostic, or an absolute unbeliever, like many men of science.\" Georgie did not wait to let Agnes"], [211, "PAT'S BLUSHES. 199 object that it was not incumbent on her sister to select for her husband a man of science, who must be either a good Catholic or an unbeliever. She went on to say : \" He is as liberal and tolerant as he is reverent and devout ; he wall allow me perfect freedom in the practice of my Protestantism \u2014 Pat is empowered to say that \u2014 I am sure he is.\" Pat nodded. \" And only think of the help and com fort I shall be to Pat, as Dr. de Vitre's wife,\" Georgie ran on exultingly. \" I wonder you, who have been so concerned about his welfare and mine, since we were children, do not take that into account.\" \" I beg you will not sacrifice yourself for me, Georgie,\" said Pat, holding up his hands in deprecation. \" I could not accept such self-renunciation ; and pray be careful how you commit yourself and me.
