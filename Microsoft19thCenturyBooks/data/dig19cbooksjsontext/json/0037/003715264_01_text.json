Naturally our National Guard presented itself at once as the speediest means to bring about this result. The government of the State of New York, through its military head, Major General Charles F. Roe, issued an order to the various military organi-"], [26, "History of Troop \"A\" 14 zations of the State demanding an immediate report of the men available to form such an army of volun teers. Accordingly, the Commander of Squadron \"A,\" Major Avery D. Andrews, promptly tele graphed to all of its members to meet at the armory, and vote by troops as to whether they were willing to go: out as an organization in defence of the coun try. The result was reported in less than twenty-four hours after receiving the order, and it was \"That the Squadron volunteered its services to a man if the State chose to call upon it for duty in or out of the country.\" Then, with the excitement of the situation before us, we awaited further developments. Finally, toward the latter part of April, after war had been officially declared, the Federal government called upon New York State to furnish as its quota of men about twelve thousand of its National Guard, and among that number demanded two troops of cavalry, consisting of eighty-one men and three officers each. To the bitter disappointment of the entire Squadron, the State insisted that one troop should come from New York city and the other from Brooklyn. On the evening of Wednesday, April 27, we were again ordered to assemble at the armory to decide upon the men who should compose a repre sentative troop from the organization. It seemed best, after careful consideration, that they should be"], [27, "Ordered 'Out 15 chosen by lot, an equal number coming from each of the three troops, and the excitement ran high. So intense was the desire of some men to be counted among the number chosen that non-commissioned officers resigned their positions to join the ranks as privates, and even accepted the duties of saddler rather than lose an opportunity to be with their fel low troopers. At last, with a feeling of pride and happiness on the part of the lucky members, the re quired quota was secured. During the next few days the men were kept busy ; horses had to be procured and passed upon by the examining board; the Quartermaster's Department was rushed to its utmost capacity in equipping the outgoing troopers, and each man hurried to- collect his personal kit and arrange his business for a long absence. On Sunday, the day before our departure, the armory was the scene of intense excitement. Up stairs in the locker room men were already rolling their packs, while in the ring the sound of the anvil mingled with the tramping and neighing of each new consignment of horses as they dashed around the tan bark for inspection by the veterinarian. That night most of the men stayed at the Armory, and were up before daylight in their anxiety to be ready at the appointed hour. At last the rush subsided, and promptly at nine o'clock on Monday morning, May"], [28, "History of Troop \"A\" 16 2, the troop was formed and, with Captain Howard G.

The reception accorded the troop throughout the line of march down Fifth avenue was most gratifying, but with it came a feeling of sadness as we realized that, on its return, some must surely be missing from the ranks. The ferry crossed, the troop soon left the city limits, and with the command \"Route Order!\" every one settled down for the long trip over the country roads. We arrived at Jamaica at noon, where a halt was made at Pettit's Hotel for lunch. At two o'clock we were again in the saddle, and by six the tents at Camp Black were sighted.

The guard formed the ring, and out of the blackness in the centre came the horse like a bolt from Heaven and disappeared in the blackness out side ; and no one knew aught of the manner of his go ing, except the man through whom he went, and all he knew was that he had barely escaped being killed.

How many things there were we lined up for and took! Each man took the first horse he came to, unless, unobserved, he could sneak down the line and grab his own.

How often, in those long bare-back rides to water, we had cause to \"Remember the Mane!\" How quick we were to learn the art of taking a bath with only two quarts of water, and that stolen from the barrel of boiled water (so called) reserved solely for drinking.

How"], [33, "Camp Black 19 difficult was the counting of horses in the dark especially the ones that lay down so often you couldn't count them. How fond of authority were the sergeants and corporals, and the acting cor porals; and how cocksure was each private of just the way in which each thing should have been done. We were a troop of generals then. Such are the vague impressions. Let us try, how ever, to recall a few facts in something like chrono logical order. On Monday, May 2nd, 1898, with the farewells of Fifth avenue in our ears, and ham sandwiches of Ja maica in our throats, after a long and dreary march we emerged from the trees of Garden City upon the broad plain of Hempstead. There on the left were the white tents of the Sixty ninth, and on the knoll at the right the General's Headquarters, while beyond stretched the long white lines of the other regiments. It was nearly sunset. The clouds hung low over the plain. Bleak and autumnal, rather than springlike, was the scene. At last, on the further side of the camp, we reached the spot selected for us. Here Sergeant Patterson, who had been sent ahead with the im pedimenta and a detail consisting of Saddler Throop, Private Barry, two colored cooks and a lot of Dutch teamsters, had a fire already burning and mess well"], [34, "History of Troop \"A\" 20 under way. \"On right into line!

In the gathering darkness we worked quickly, and, although new to the business, the eleven Sibley tents were soon up, the poles almost straight and sides well pegged down. To be sure we had to take them down again next day, in order to get the door ways all in the same straight line and the proper dis tance apart. There were few things that came right the first time. It was dark before \"mess call\" came, and we gathered around the kitchen fire (built close behind the tents on that site afterward famous as Hoening haus Park) and greedily made way with pork and beans and coffee. We could not see what we were eating, but we were hungry, and it tasted very good. Later it came on to rain, and it was a long, wet, weary night for that first guard. The others were so tired that the sudden change from the comfort able bed of the night before to the cold straw cov ered ground inside the tents could not prevent sleep.

The hated evening parade was mercifully omitted. And yet it seemed that almost every min ute of the day was taken up. No sooner was one thing over than the next be gan, and there were many things to be done not ob vious from simply reading the list of calls. Terry realized this very early in the game, as was shown by this sage remark: \"Say \u2014 say \u2014 I always make it an invariable \u2014 an invariable rule to keep behind \u2014 behind the tents, for if you don't a sergeant \u2014 a ser geant is sure to come out \u2014 and pinch you.\" Five minutes were given in which to wake up and dress yourself. Then, if you were not sick (and al most no one was sick at Camp Black, in spite of all the cold and wet), came half an hour in which to wash, but little good was that with no water to wash with. How astonished the inhabitants of that little tumble down house a quarter of a mile away were the first morning to see their front yard full of troopers waiting for the next basin full of water from the well, and rich in soap* boxes, sponges and tooth brushes (Riker's violet water was an afterthought of Alger and did not appear at Camp Black). Later, through the kindness of Henry Payne Whitney, a large watering cart refilled at least twice a day stood"], [39, "Camp Black 23 close behind our tents, and we could each draw a pailful for a morning bath. Later still, the last week of our stay, the government water pipes reached us, and in the mud by the watering trough many baths were taken in the few morning hours available; for though we rose at half-past five A. M., the female sightseer (on bicycle or in 'bus) always happened on the horizon at a marvellously early hour. As if to discourage all attempts at cleanliness, no sooner had one washed than came the \"stable call\" and cleaning horses on that muddy picket line. The industrious man who cleaned his horse quickly and well (and no horse is well cleaned unless quickly cleaned) was invariably rewarded by the sergeant by being assigned to clean another horse. In fact, it was only the man who made a fine art of shirking (and few there were, be it said,) who escaped clean ing two- horses, for about half the men each morning were exempt because of guard or new guard or orderly detail. With \"mess call,\" at seven, there was a prompt rush for the right of the line, and off we were marched in single file, hungry enough to eat any thing. We were on State rations then (much more liberal than Uncle Sam's) and Sergeant Pellew on that old white charger scoured the country in an attempt to get the lowest quotation for milk from"], [40, "History of Troop \"A\" 24 the shrewd Long Island farmers. We had fresh baker's bread instead of hard tack, and, take it all in all, good, plain, wholesome food, cooked by Tom and Walter. At breakfast we usually confined our selves to the rations provided, but the other meals were largely supplemented by chicken, roast beef and pate de fois gras, cake and jam, oranges and apples, whiskey, beer and rum, not to speak of apollinaris, from the hampers inside the tents sent down by kind friends and relatives. The Long Island Express was almost overworked. Soon after mess came the change of guard. The evolution of \"guard mount\" was curious to watch. At first it was not called \"guard mount,\" but a mere change of guard in an informal manner, and each morning there was something different and some added trifle of formality until finally it blossomed out in its full glory as \"guard mount.\" But at Camp Black there was one question for the guard that was never settled, and that was overcoats. About 7:30 an order would be shouted down the street that the new guard would wear overcoats, or else that they would not, and which ever way it was, it was invari ably reversed at least once before the final note of the assembly had sounded.

Camp Black was the day of the Easy Boss. The sergeants had not then learned to be the slave drivers into which they developed at Alger, and the mud on the picket line was so deep that little could be done to it in the way of cleaning. At this time of day great was the hurrying of or derlies \u2014 polishing boots and bridles, and always five minutes late in saddling up and reporting to the first sergeant. Many were the tales brought back in the evening by these same orderlies of private tips from Holly and Hurry, and gossip of the camp. The duty was new, and at first amusing as well as tiresome. Perhaps its chief compensation was the interest and excitement always caused by a mounted orderly dashing up with formidable looking despatches sticking through his belt. The command to the colonel of which the orders were addressed always imagined the formal looking documents to be an order from Washington for an instant advance upon Havana or Cadiz. Watering horses gave us a long journey twice a day. \"Water, water, everywhere, and not a drop to drink,\" for man or beast, was our early experience in the immediate neighborhood of the camp. It was a mile or more to one farm where we went to water,"], [44, "History of Troop \"A\" 26 and almost two miles to the other. The horses were green, the men were green, and riding one horse bareback and leading another (both pulling hard and pulling apart), was not always a pleasure. Then, when we reached the farm, watering was a slow proc ess. It was at one of these farms that Ernie Thomp son was kicked in the chest by one of our horses that stormy night when we took them to the barns for shelter. He was taken in and well cared for for several days by the farmer's wife. Morning drill was usually bareback. The after noon drills were a more formal matter; and good, sharp and rattling they were \u2014 trotting and gallop ing over that broad plain. Early in the afternoon the crowds from New York began to arrive, and the inside of a tent, not to speak of the haystack, after recall from drill resembled an afternoon tea. The fair ones often stayed till six o'clock mess and looked with dainty curiosity and slightly shocked surprise at the partial return of man to the eating habits of his early ancestors. Some of them were even eager to eat from the soldier's tin dish and sip coffee from his cup. In the evening, snug in the tents, the rain driving against the canvas, we sat on boxes and sang songs and told tales and smoked and took a drink and were"], [45, "Camp Black 27 merry until taps. And after that we slept and shiv ered in our sleep. Meanwhile, the night provost patrol scoured the country and the surrounding villages to pick up wandering soldiers, and came back after midnight and woke up the tents, and next morning told of ad ventures and daring captures. There were mounted patrols by day also, who pur sued unlicensed hucksters and preserved the bound aries of the camp. Their doings even got into the daily papers, one of which immortalized forever the exploit of Private \"Antonio\" Terry, who, putting spurs to his favorite charger \"Tanglefoot,\" overtook and captured a doughboy deserter. One afternoon we were invited to attend the horse show at the Mineola Fair Grounds, to give an exhi bition drill, which we did in the middle of the ring, and felt rather out of place while the \"county fam ilies\" in the grand stand looked on coldly. We all felt better when Bill Cammann went into a race with the local talent and carried off the prize hands down. Those same fair grounds we were to know again, when we took the horses there to spend the night in the sheds during one of the worst of the north easters. It was a long walk back to camp through the mud. Not until we reached Camp Alger were we in"], [46, "History of Troop \"A\" 28 close quarters with Troop \"C.\" Between us at Camp Black was a great gulf fixed in the shape of a sunken road, from each side of which the sentries eyed one another with some curiosity, until one afternoon the first sergeants of the two troops somehow ran afoul of each other, and the result was beer and clay pipes that night around the \"C\" camp fire, until a pelting rain sent us scurrying to the tents. Afterward came the \"A\" \"at home,\" with the Squadron band and songs and punch and fire. We had a calling ac quaintance then. About this time the two troops first marched to gether \u2014 the occasion on which we rode to the sta tion to meet and escort Governor Black and after ward took part in the review. The magnificent spectacle of a hundred superb cavalrymen drawn up troop front at the railway station, awaiting, with glittering sabres at the carry, the advent of the commander-in-chief of the State forces, filled the surrounding crowds with proper awe. The Gov ernor came at last, and the command \"Present sabres \" was executed as by one man. The only thing marring the impressive ceremony was that our heavy weight champion, Bruce, whose well known \"Moose\" subsequently contracted such a habit of straying from the picket as to become proverbial, in the excitement of the moment leaned to one side,"], [47, "Camp Black 29 thereby causing his saddle to describe an arc of one hundred and eighty degrees.

But the regiments made a brave showing and were proud; and the Governor was, after all, only an excuse for the review. Take it all in all a trooper's day was a full one and all absorbing. It was wonderful how the rest of the world faded out of sight. We read the papers in a perfunctory way. Even Dewey's victory made little real impression on us.

My canteen and cup took wings and in sifting the tent straw a pair of spurs was found, marked with the number of a man who was never known to be without his full quota. No questions were asked, however, and he who got anything back esteemed himself fortunate. Just before it was time to start our old com mander, Major \u2014 now Major General \u2014 Roe, came over to see us, and shaking hands with each wished good luck to all. It was an affecting scene. \"Prepare to Mount! Mount!\" the trumpet rings out, and we are off, the post band marching ahead, playing \"The Girl I Left Behind Me,\" \"Auld Lang Syne\" and other melodies calculated to cheer. The doughboys break their guard lines to rush out and bid us godspeed; we pass the headquarters and are reviewed by the dear old General, whom we cheer loudly. Our band stands aside and plays us past. Then they march back, and we march on; cut loose from the secure moorings of the past, we are afloat on the storm threatening seas of the future. A bright May Sunday, clear and warmish, and the roads exceedingly dusty. As we ride through the"], [59, "Camp Alger 37 country we are everywhere greeted with enthusiasm. Flags wave from every house, and all sorts and con ditions of men, women and children shout a hearty \"Good luck to you, boys!\" as we go by. It is a long, hard march, and it is well into the afternoon when we reach the outskirts of the city. Here we proceed along a parklike avenue, trotting most of the time, for it is late, and we have still far to go. A little way back on the road we had stopped at a house and were entertained royally. Tables were spread under the trees, and ladies and gentlemen dressed in their Sunday best vied with each other in dispensing grateful refreshments, alcoholic and otherwise, to as tough a looking outfit of travel stained troopers as can well be imagined. It seemed like an echo from some former existence. On we went through the great city, and at each point of vantage a howling, cheering crowd had sta tioned themselves. It was exhilarating to the last degree, but the steady roar soon got on the nerves and made one feel bewildered and dreamy.

We flitted in, ghostlike, for a few hours, and were gone. I remember looking at my bed and wondering when I would sleep in one again, if ever. We reported for duty at half-past four in the morning. In crossing the river we fell in with a boatswain's mate from the U. S. S. Cincinnati, who was invalided. He was blessed with a voice like a siren whistle, and turned out to be something of a prophet. I asked him concerning the naval operations what was going to be done.

In 1898 we greet you as brother citizens of a reunited country!\" Arriving at the little station of Dunn Loring, a few miles beyond Washington, we disembarked and took up the march for Camp Alger, some miles away. It was quite dark, and one of our wagons got stuck in the mud for a time, which seemed to us like an echo of the civil war. We were hailed by voices out of the darkness here and there saying, \"What's this? Cav alry? Where are you from?\" To which we would answer, \"New York!\" \"Good work!\" would come the reply; \"We're from Indiana!\" or whatever the State might be. Our chance acquaintances told us stories of Span ish spies who had been caught poisoning the wells, together with other grewsome tales, which, heard when riding through a Virginia wood in the dark ness after two days and a night of great fatigue, made one realize that war was no picnic.

By the light of flaring gasoline torches, hundreds of soldiers were lounging"], [62, "History of Troop \"A\" 40 around a long line of sutlers' booths. This was the \"Midway Plaisance\" of the camp and the centre of its social life. The infantrymen were much interested in the cavalry, and greeted us with great warmth, express ing a decided opinion, in fact, that we were \"all right.\" After some difficulty we found the headquarters hill, and established a rough sort of camp there. The General had not yet arrived, so that we had the hill to ourselves. About eleven o'clock supper was cooked, which was very acceptable, particularly as regards the coffee. If a soldier can get coffee, he is well off. We were encamped under great chest nut trees, and the picture of the blue uniformed troopers thrown into relief by the firelight, and the dark line of horses in the background, was one to which the reality of the occasion added a depth which might otherwise have been absent. There was a line of empty tents near by, to which we were assigned, two squads to a small tent.

After watering the horses at a meagre stream, dis tant one mile and a half, we pitched our tents in a weed grown, ploughed field, and each man carried his saddle, packs and equipments from the hill to our new camp. The place was deeply covered with rank, tough undergrowth, and the troopers devoted the remain der of the day to clearing the space on which the tents actually rested by pulling the weeds out by their roots and grazing their horses over the rest of of the troop street. Shovels were in demand, and failing these, hatchets were used to level the furrows where we were to sleep, as well as to cut a ditch sur rounding the wall of the tent. Guard duty now became less frequent, owing to the combination of the two troops into a squadron. It became more rigorous, however, and our prox imity to headquarters made the turning out of the guard an every day affair. But as soon as the Gen eral discovered that we knew the etiquette, and were at all times ready to carry it out, he took pains to avoid passing the guard tent during the daytime.

They are re quired to do no other duty during the day, and as there are only twenty-four working hours it is for tunate that they are not. The stable police begin their day at morning stables while the horses are at water. With rake and fork they shake over the bedding and pile it in neat little heaps at the rear of the line.

Immediately afterward the sun is too hot for the horses, so they must be led to the woods near by. \"Stable police!\" roars the sergeant, and off we go, with five horses tied together, leading them along, and to add zest to the amusement jumping them over a four foot ditch which must be passed. This operation is a delicate one, and as three jump and two balk alternately, you are somewhat at a loss what to do about it. You jolly them and swear at them, and then just as the jumpers decide to go back to the balkers the latter essay to join the former, and a general mix up ensues which is to the last degree interesting.

Then at eleven o'clock we hay down. Some new forage comes in, and both street and stable police unload it. If the stable sergeant is a late creation or overzealous, we clean out the picket line once again. Then we fill the nosebags for evening stables, and while the horses are at water we bed down.

Each tent places a box filled with its waste articles in front of the door as the police approach, and one of the detail makes a round of the tent to see that nothing remains to be policed between the ropes and pegs. Then the street is raked and swept clean, and by the time that is finished a wagonful of heavy express packages or ammunition or whatever has arrived from the station has to be unloaded. Any odd job which arises in the course of the day is put in their hands, and any time that the stable police require assistance, \"Street police, turn out!\" is the cry. When on the march the street police put up the officers' tent, take it down, ditch it, and generally make themselves useful.

On Sunday morning, May 20th, we underwent our first inspection, and the same is an invention of the devil. All your belongings are spread out on your poncho in front of the tent, and the captain takes note of them and comments upon their condition, yours, and anything else which happens to be on his mind at the time. Before he comes the first sergeant has selected some outlandish and absurd arrangement for your kit, as the one to be followed. And when with in finite pains you have changed yours to conform, to the immolation of all true art, he promulgates a new model just as the captain starts down the line. \"Why was I born a slave?\" remarked Terry on such an occasion. It is hot as tophet, but when all is over most of the troop are able to obtain passes to Washington, and all is forgotten. Dressed in our best uniform we present ourselves to the first sergeant. He looks us over and says that we will do, so off we go, after having our passes countersigned. We hail an an cient wagon and step aboard. It once was a surrey and is drawn by the remains of a horse.

All be ing well we reach the trolley car terminus and pay our driver a quarter. The pandemonium here is something frightful. Tickets are purchased in the store across the track, while lemonade, soda water and candy venders combine with colored bootblack and clothes brush boys, not to mention the hack men, to raise a rumpus which is absolutely unfor gettable.

If your friends ask you to lunch they offer you the use of a bathtub. This is highly appreciated, for water is scarce in Camp Alger, and the fact is well known in Washington \u2014 unofficially.

Mounted officers, hospital orderlies and ambulances pass us and disappear in the darkness.

The cavalry are to act as his escort, so we deck ourselves out in our best and march to the station over the dustiest road in the United States. While we are waiting we brush up as well as we can; then the train comes in and the President steps out, attended by a number of staff officers and civil dignitaries with their wives. They get into carriages, and the troops move out ahead of them. In short order, however, we are stopped, as the dust, which prevents our seeing the horses next in front of us as we trot along, is rolling back in vast clouds on the Presidential party, to"], [76, "48 History of Troop \"A\" which they naturally object. We then draw off to the side of the road, and the carriages take the lead. Then all trot out, unable to see or breathe any thing but dust, varying the performance by those absolutely short stops which seem inseparable from escort work, when all hands go up, signifying \"Halt!\" and your horse plants his feet, and you pull him up by intuition. Up hill and down dale, through the woods and out again, then to the right into the great parade ground over a narrow bridge, which we are warned to look out for by voices beyond the clouds. Over the springy grass we trot (there was a little left there at that early date), and up to a high open stand, where the President takes his post, while we trot to the rear and rest. Fifteen thousand troops in brigade formation break from the right and march past; a glorious sight to see. After the review we escorted the President all over the camp, the infantry cheering him very heartily. He thoughtfully dismissed us when we reached our own camp, and we retired to free our selves of some forty-seven acres of Virginia soil finely powdered. It is but fitting, at this point, that I should do justice to the genius in an Ohio band who set \"O"], [77, "TOM ' ' PEEKSKILL \" \" COBBLESKILL ' ' WALTER THE CULINARY DEPARTMENT\u2014 CAMP ALGER."], [78, ""], [79, "Camp Alger 49 Promise Me\" to march, or rather jig, time with which to regale the President and rouse the martial ardor of the rude soldiery. His punishment is not provided for by the Military Code, probably because such a contingency was beyond the limit of human foresight. This was perhaps preferable, however, to the endless dead marches which the bands used to practise daily. Shortly after the review our captain, Howard G. Badgley, a thorough officer and gentleman, was taken ill with typhoid fever. We saw the ambulance take him off to the hospital with sorrow and anxiety in our hearts, and long months passed before he re turned to us. This was the first appearance of the ambulance, which afterward became an unfortu nately frequent visitor, although Troop \"A\" had fewer sick men than did many other commands, Cox and Bruce, Connor and Manning successively contracting this scourge of the camps. A change of commissaries took place about this time, and the genial Sergeant Pellew was succeeded by that veteran smooth talker and \"rough rider,\" good old \"Jim\" Price, the \"regular.\" The washing of mess kits had frozen the genial current of \"Jim's\" soul to the same extent that the beating of the Virginia sun on the ground floor of our natural mess hall had warmed his fertile brain,"], [80, "History of Troop \"A\" 50 so he took up a collection to buy a mess tent and outfit which could be used at all times except when actually in the field. Aided by a system of equalized taxation, we were thenceforth enabled to eat in the shade and to enjoy the best which the government provided, aug mented by the judicious disbursements of \"Jim\" from the troop's mess fund. These were palmy days, and Price's satellites, \"Peekskill,\" \"Fishkill\" and \"Cobbleskill,\" were at all times ready to assist, un less their services were required for some private din ner party from Washington. The mess tent was a great institution, and was useful in a variety of ways, including religious ser vices, meetings and entertainments. When General Roe was appointed brigadier we had a punch, by per mission, at which Ogilvie, of Troop \"C,\" sang \"Sue, Dear,\" to bring tears to your eyes, and Sergeant Cammann rendered \"The Irish Maid\" with enor mous success. An attempt was made to get Charlie Sharp, our colored mule driver, to sing, but after an unsuccessful essay at a song, which told something about \"jingle bells,\" Sharp fell flat through shyness. He was a most extraordinary negro, and was very amusing to talk to. He had driven a wagon in the civil war, prior to which time he had been a slave. He was a great dog fancier, and had a fine collection"], [81, "Camp Alger 51 back of the wagon park. If any one driving to Dunn Loring with him espied a good looking dog and called attention to him, \"Put him in the wagon\" was Charlie's word. One of us remonstrated with him on the grounds of honesty. \"I don't never steal no dog,\" said Charlie indignantly, \"but if a dog wants to follow me I ain't required to be cruel to him and beat him back.\" We now settled down to a regular routine of duty, drilling morning and afternoon, doing guard, polic ing camp, acting as headquarters or telegraph order lies or as mounted provost, with evening parade to top off with. The morning drill consisted of a skirmish through the woods, mounted or fighting on foot, according to the necessities of the occasion. There was one hill in particular, covered with woods and very steep, just back of headquarters, and this we were in the habit of attacking daily. Riding down hill among trees, with carbine advanced, furnishes good cause for vigilance, to say the least. Then would come the order to fight on foot. A skirmish line would form, tearing their way through brambles and underbrush, scrambling over a small canal, advancing by rushes over a ploughed field, and ending up by taking the opposite woods in a desper ate charge."], [82, "History of Troop \"A\" 52 Then \"To horse!\" would sound, and the mounted men would tow the led horses up to the troop, and the troop would start for their horses, and in short order we were up and away. It was wonderful to see in how many different ways four horses could surround a tree, and no less surprising to note how quickly they were straight ened out. It will live in the memory of all that a ploughed field can find more places to deposit itself in a carbine than any human being would believe. In the afternoon the Squadron, composed of Troops \"A\" and \"C,\" under command of Captain Clayton, of \"C,\" would drill. This was usually in squadron formation, but on several occasions we had glorious mounted skirmish drills, with charges, raillies and so on, in a field loaned to us by an old Confederate officer who had served with Stuart. \"A\" troop was to make a grand attack on Falls Church. The second lieutenant was to command, and it was to be the real thing and no mistake. They started out with the \"point,\" \"support\" and all the rest of it thrown out; everything complete, but no blank cartridges, so that the villagers might not sup pose that the civil war had recommenced. The old guard, who had just finished their tour of duty under Sergeant Phelps, obtaining permission to take their horses and go swimming, several miles"], [83, "FIGHTING ON FOOT \u2014 CAMP ALGER"], [84, ""], [85, "Camp Alger 53 away. The curious might have wondered why they needed so many blank cartridges, but they did their work secretly, and nobody noticed. Shortly after the troop started, out marched Phelps and his merry men. By a rapid flanking movement they succeeded in reaching Falls Church before the troop did, and they proceeded to conceal themselves in a barnyard. Some minutes later the advance guard were amazed to find themselves surrounded by a party of apparent comrades, who esteemed it their duty as well as pleasure to inform the \"advance\" that they were prisoners and lead them gently into the seclu sion of their pastoral fastness. Hearing some trouble ahead the \"support\" came around the corner, and were gobbled up by a spirited sabre charge, which they were at a loss to under stand. And the main body, who were very few in number, became involved in an exceedingly lively engagement, in which blank cartridges were freely used by the guerillas and the troop could only use clubbed carbines or sabres, not to mention Billings gate. The second lieutenant was the most disgusted man in Virginia, and, although a prisoner he promptly placed Sergeant \"Mosby\" Phelps under"], [86, "History of Troop \"A\" 54 arrest, remarking, with some felicity, that \"Phelps had spoiled the drill.\" Permission had been obtained for this demonstra tion, however, from the commanding officer, so that even if the lieutenant had been disposed to make any trouble about it, which he was not, the distinguished successor to \"Mosby,\" the guerilla, was safe. This incident had the effect of teaching our men to be vigilant at all times and at all places, and also impressed upon them the fact that all are not friends who seem friends. Water now became scarce and typhoid fever plentiful. Furthermore, a plague of flies settled over the camp. Every well in the neighborhood had sentries posted near by to see that the water was well husbanded. Our horses had to be taken to a stream nearly two miles away twice a day. A well was sunk near our camp which was good enough for horses and bathing for a while, although always yellow from the clay soil. Even this became too bad to be used, and our beautiful evergreen bath house near by, with its board floor, went out of our lives, except as a golden memory. A box had been placed for bathing in what remained of a neighbor ing stream, but this was never an attractive arrange ment, and soon fell into well merited disuse.

In the midst of this Sahara, where doughboys and others were suffering for drinking water and being made ill by lack of chances to wash, a board of in spection came out from Washington, drove through the kilnlike camp and gave a report that \"the water supply was ample and of excellent quality.\" May they be supplied with either brains or consciences, for one or the other was noticeably absent from their makeup. The long line of ambulances winding over the hills each evening was the best evidence as to the conditions which prevailed, and at that, it was only the very ill who were carried into the post hospital at Fort Myer. The squads of the troops were assigned to conical wall tents, and numbered from nine to eleven mem bers each. There was Hoyt's, afterward Leigh's, Tent 3, noted for its success in getting to Washing ton; Tent 4, the Kindergarten, where Corporal Haight gave sound advice on the beauty of work performed. Some think this referred to some achievement of Sidney's in the days \"before the war,\" but more likelv it was intended to cheer on his"], [90, "History of Troop \"A\" 56 squad to renewed efforts. Ruland succeeded to the command of Tent 4, and the rights of men were dis cussed less fervently therein than formerly. Valen tine jollied everybody, and the world went merrily enough. The crowning gem and glory of the troop, how ever, was Erving's famous Tent 5, noted for its par liamentary discussions and language, and its high average of soldierly ability. Indeed not a doubt existed (within) as to the competency of any of us to sill any position from captain up. This is about the only tent which furnished no officers to the volun teer army, which fact is largely responsible for the great dissatisfaction arising from the conduct of the war. Tent 6 said what was necessary and sawed wood, varying the performance by stealing delicacies for their horses. They were chiefly noted for being the proud possessors of our beloved and lamented mas cot, \"Rosie O'Grady.\" Lack of space prevents a detailed account of each tent. All are worthy of notice, and each contained a good lot of fellows. James Terry's happy home was in Tent 10, and there discoursed the oracle. Occasionally he paid parochial visits to other tents to gladden the hearts of the listening troopers.

Indeed, the sergeant's tent, next to the officers', was a good place to avoid. \"Out of sight out of mind\" is a good proverb, and it is always best to let sleeping dogs lie. The names of the horses went with the tents, and had considerable character, as a few may show: the Moose, the Cow, the Crusader, named after a yacht on which the trooper had arranged to spend the sum mer; Cubeb, on account of his unsavory character; all these from Tent 7, noted for its commissions and workers; Riker's Expectorant, famous among horses; the Sainted Lobster, and a host of others. We were now introduced to a new feature of army life \u2014 namely, the practice march, and our first ex perience came near being the last for some of us. Our route was from Falls Church to the Maryland side of the Chain Bridge, across the Potomac, to give the men a swim, each brigade being sent in turn. Advance guard out and flankers scouring the neigh boring fields, we marched on, and finally halted for a rest on a steep hill, at the bottom of which was a bridge. A turn in the road cut off the view to the rear, and the road was bounded by a precipice above and one below. The ledge was just wide enough to give good room for two wagons to pass, but not much to spare."], [94, "58 History of Troop \"A\" Suddenly we heard a roaring of wheels around the bend. The noise grew louder, and the word was passed along that the mules were running away. Each trooper took his horse as far to one side of the road as he could go, climbing the steep bank for a few feet and making the horse continue the climb ing motion. Around the bend came the mules, and for about a quarter of a mile we could see them galloping madly straight at us. It did not look as if there would be room enough for us all, but there was no way of in creasing it, so we waited. Ahead rode Sergeants Bowne, of \"A,\" and Debevoise, of \"C,\" at top speed, warning the men. The colored driver guided his team through the narrow lane left for them with consummate skill, and as they came by me I could see Walter, our black cook, an old navy man, hanging on to the leaders' reins with all his heart, soul and weight. The mules gradually yielded to this combination and were stopped about one hundred yards further on. Too much credit cannot be given to Sam, the driver, and Walter Johnson, the cook, for their skilful and heady work in averting what might otherwise have been a serious disaster.

Starting for home early in the afternoon we arrived there in the cool of the evening without fur ther adventure.

It was a picturesque affair, with the plunging horses, the old fashioned canal, and the tents on the green meadow under the great trees.

The two troops must have made an impressive appearance, as the leaders, followed by the moving cloud, thundered down the steep hills with their weapons clashing, and the drawn sabres gleaming in the moonlight at intervals through the dust. The reports of the battles of San Juan and El Ca ney had just arrived and filled our souls with envy, and we longed for a chance. We were not called upon, however, for Falls Church was quiet as the grave, and the road down which I was sent as a flanker showed no signs of life whatever. At the trolley station we met some of the provost, and they explained that the Sixth Pennsylvania were running the foot guard by companies and battalions.

Never at a loss, he formed them in line under a sergeant who was among the prisoners, made them call off, count fours and then marched them ahead of him some three miles or more, in first class form. In scouring all over the countryside Corporal Cromwell went through a field full of haycocks. Just for practice he cut at one of them with his sabre, when a voice of horror exclaimed from within: \"Don't do that again; I'll come out.\" With that the field seemed alive with bluecoats, and twelve or fifteen doughboys surrendered at discretion. Detaching guards for the prisoners as we went, the few that were left arrived at the Aqueduct Bridge after the hardest kind of riding.

A stubble field sloped down to a little wood fringed stream, a descent of several hundred yards. Green and golden hills were all around us, while in the distance, grim and grand, rose the stately peaks of the Blue Ridge Mountains. An old Mosby man came into camp that night and regaled us with tales of the Civil War. His best advice was to throw away the sabre and carry two revolvers to a man. He told us that Mosby's men had done this with excellent results, and as regards buying an extra revolver many of us followed his counsel. Late in the next afternoon we halted for the night in a pretty meadow at some distance from water. The grazing was excellent, and some of the men herded the horses and let them browse on a hill near the camp. All went well until stable call. The herders claim"], [126, "76 History of Troop \"A\" that then they drove the horses back purposely, but there was an elan about the returning steeds which reminded us of the wild coursers of the desert and gave us a deep insight into the business end of a cavalry charge.

Off we went again after watering at the town pump, the road being almost dustier than usual, for we were out of the pleasant hill country and had en tered the parched malarial district in which Camp Alger was situated, probably in the hope of getting the men acclimated.

We were sorry to hear that some of the Sixth Pennsylvania \u2014 about two hundred, I believe \u2014 learning that only sixteen men were left in the New York cavalry camp, had come over and black guarded our sentries. The corporal in charge, Iselin, had walked out and talked with them, but they had withdrawn very sul lenly.

We were still marching when I went to sleep and woke just in time to catch myself. I started to tell the man alongside of me that I had been asleep, but he made no answer \u2014 he was asleep too. In order to keep awake we sang, not necessarily different songs, but each man had some song he had a grudge against, and he sang it for half an hour on a stretch.

We took train to Upperville, stopped over night with our friend Law, and proceeded to finish up his honey and corn pone crop at breakfast.

This was Sunday afternoon, the 24th of July. For two days we enjoyed the novelty of a new camp; but disquieting rumors were once more around to disturb our peace. A combination of cir- cumstances might still arise by which Troop \"A\" would be left behind. It was said that of the five troops of cavalry at Newport News only two* were to be taken, and the choice would probably fall between three troops: The City Troop, of Philadelphia: Troop \"C,\" of Brooklyn, and ourselves. Which of these three would have to stay at home? Nobody knew very much of what was going on behind the scenes, but evidently there was a good deal. How- ever, speculation was cut short on Wednesday morn- ing, July 27, by orders for all three troops to board Transport No. 22, Q. M. D., which was the official name for the cattle steamship Massachusetts, of the Atlantic Transport Line, and the question as to who"], [162, "History of Troop \"A\" 96 should stay behind was now solved by all three troops squeezing themselves into the boat. Loading a troop on to a transport with forty days' rations for man and beast was no pipe dream. There were hundreds of boxes of hard tack and canned goods, sides of bacon and bags of sugar, flour, coffee, potatoes, onions, &c, besides Buzzacott ovens, boil ers, kettles, pots and pans and the odds and ends of a kitchen outfit. Then there were the hay and oats, bales and bags of them, and the tentage and other Q. M. necessities. All this impedimenta was put on board by our selves, now turned into a gang of stevedores, armed with the proper two wheeled truck, and working in a manner that we had little dreamed of when we had strolled about the pier of an ocean liner and watched the similar process of loading. Finally the mule wagons, and last, but not least, the mules themselves. Now, the mule is a noble creature, but the placing of this worthy and saga cious animal in any given position requires patience, tactical skill, diplomacy, a modicum of persuasive ness, and considerable force. He is phlegmatic, at least tO' all outward appearances; surrounding condi tions possess no- interest for him. The war with Spain was a bagatelle in comparison to the fly on his left hind leg.

A month later, when, leaving Camp Black, with our faces really turned toward the front, we marched past General Roe and his wife and daughter, there was hardly a dry eye in the crowd; but now it seemed more like a picnic.

Every available spot was filled, and many that were unfit for any living thing. The two upper decks were occupied by the animals, packed in like sardines, every two being separated by a rough board. The sufferings of these patient beasts must have been awful. Space was so wanting that they had to be crowded in close to the engines and boilers in a temperature that even under the best of conditions kept them in a constant sweat, and when the boat ran aground in the harbor of Ponce and all circulation of air ceased many of them came near dying. It is marvellous that only one succumbed during the four or five days that elapsed before they could be unloaded. As to the men, they were also very crowded, but the accommodations were fairly comfortable. The quarters were in the cellar.

When it is consid ered that all the equipment and kit, saddles, tents, blankets, arms and accoutrements of each man had to be accommodated in the small space that thus fell to his lot, and also that no such things as passage ways had been left, one can imagine the scene when some man who lived in the furthest corner started to turn in. He always came last of all, of course, usually with a wet poncho on, after having been driven from the piazza by rain. Imagine him diving over hammocks and under others, falling on saddles, kicking down carbines and tripping over sabres. Imagine him showering every one with water, but don't imagine the language that was used; though some of the remarks made by Frank Bowne and Morty Ward were worthy of preservation as class ics. However, most of us slept on the roof garden, which was much more comfortable, despite the dan ger of rolling overboard while asleep, as there was no protection around the edge. And just here is a fitting place to record the sad death of one of our most loved companions, the best of mascots, Sweet Rosie O'Grady, who we called \"Rosie\" for short. One day while she was playing tag with \"Watty\" Leigh she fell overboard, and our"], [171, "MESS ON THE \"MASSACHUSETTS\""], [172, ""], [173, "From Camp Alger to Porto Rico 101 last sight of her was the pathetic wiggle of her little tail as she sank into a watery grave. As regards the mess, it was a great change from what we had been having. The government travel ration which is arranged for troops when they are not supposed to do any cooking, consists of canned beef (corned), canned beans, canned tomatoes once in fours days, sugar, coffee, salt, etc., and a few other things, such as soap and candles, these last being of little help in varying the menu. If coffee cannot be cooked, each man is allowed \"coffee money\" (as when travelling on railroads) to the extent of twen ty-one cents per day, which represents three pints of coffee at seven cents per pint. On the trans ports, however, arrangements had been made for making coffee, that is to say there were two cal drons that would make enough for some four hun dred men, which meant that the other seven hundred had to change their hours for mess till such times as they could get hold of the boilers. That Troop \"A\" never had to wait was due entirely to the energies of our head cook, Walter Johnson, to whom all praise is due for his untiring labors throughout the entire campaign. He was up early and late, and no amount of work was too much for him. Apparently the only reason for not providing the men with something hot once a day besides the"], [174, "History of Troop \"A\" 102 coffee, was the lack of time (or forethought), as the arrangements on the transport coming home were most satisfactory in this respect. As it was, after some \"persuasion,\" a soup was cooked for us in the ship's galley on two or three occasions. Mess was at first served in the quarters, but this cramped and stuffy locality was soon changed for a more commodious one on deck ; for even if it had no greater area horizontally, its dimensions vertically reached to infinity, and the ventilation was excellent. It needed to' be, for it was surrounded by mules whose salient gray faces in bas relief might have served (to quote Laury Lee) as a family portrait gal lery to various people not unconnected with military affairs. No water was obtainable to wash the kits, and cold canned beans are insoluble in hay; but one got used to anything after a while. If, however, there were no skittles, there was still beer, good and cold and plenty of it. At first this was sold by the ship's steward, who owned the monopoly, at twen ty-five cents a bottle; but this trust was \"investi gated\" by the officers and ordered to liquidate. After that the Commissary Department was able to obtain it in wholesale quantities at fifteen cents a bottle and retail it at the same price, with or with out a sandwich, or even a license. Besides the government ration, there had been"], [175, "From Camp Alger to Porto Rico 103 bought a quantity of canned corn, peas, peaches, pears, &c, which relieved the monotony of the regulation diet. There was one man, though, E. Thomson by name, who was the joy of the Com missary Department. He needed no pate de fois gras and truffles to- keep up his appetite. When every one was making unkind remarks to the com missary, and thinking worse ones about the fare pro vided, Ernie would come around and cry for beans, just as though he had been brought up on them in stead of on Castoria; nor would he be happy till he had a whole can for himself. In the light of recent events it may be interesting to note that the canned corned beef was of most ex cellent quality and a delicious article of diet when not taken too often. No canned roast beef had been issued to the troops at Camp Alger, but by \"crossing the palm\" of the boss stevedore with a bottle of rye several cases of this commodity were obtained. The exchange was a poor one, for the substance in the cans was dry, tough and stringy, and apparently all nourishment had been taken out of it; and neither boiling, baking nor any other known process of cooking produced a change in the texture. It was during the voyage down that Arthur Brown, who had done valuable work as assistant in"], [176, "History of Troop \"A\" 104 the Commissary Department, was promoted to be the official cook of the troop, with the rank and pay of a corporal. He and little Bob Troescher, who had detailed himself to the kitchen, worked like horses in a way that few men knew about and still less appre ciated. They and Morty Ward, the most inde fatigable of stable sergeants, did more work than any dozen men you could pick out. The matter of supplying man and beast with water on the transport was one that should have had more attention from the proper authorities. The water we got was very dirty, very warm and, worst of all, very scarce; so much so that no one ever had anywhere near the amount he would have liked, and the poor horses were always on a very short allow ance, some of them at one time being without water for thirty hours. And the strange part of it all was that this scarcity seemed entirely unnecessary, for when the boat ran on the bar at Ponce two hundred tons of cool, clear water were pumped overboard to lighten the ship. A hogshead was placed on one of the decks to hold drinking water for the men, but it was more often empty than full. A sentry stood guard over it and allowed you only what you could swallow on the spot.

The water basin itself was deep and was sit uated in the extreme after-part of the ship, down two ladders from the stable; and, due to the oppor tune suggestion of Laurie Lee, a lariat was used to lower the buckets into the well.

T was a fitting conclusion for the voyage of the \"Mas- sachusetts\" that she should run aground at the very mouth of the harbor where we were expecting to land. If the mishap caused sur- prise, that emotion was quite swallowed up by the rage that followed it. Things were said of the captain, mates and men that may not be indicated even in a history of troopers. We seemed to have run aground so gently that"], [196, "History of Troop \"A\" 116 we hoped the frantic churning of the screw would soon back us off. As the afternoon waned our hopes faded with it; and they were not brightened much by the sight of a wretched side-wheeler, the famous \"Gussie,\" which finally came hesitatingly to help us. The poor red craft looked like a nickel-in the-slot steamboat. Her crew missed the rope we threw them, and, wheeling in a large circle that took her almost hull down on the horizon, she finally came alongside again. A hawser was made fast from our stern to hers, and she tugged feebly while our wheel tore the water furiously. We did not move an inch. All at once darkness was upon us, and we knew we were doomed to another night on the \"Massachusetts.\" It poured, of course, in the night, but the day dawned brightly, and the arrival of some steamers, sturdier looking than our red friend, made us hopeful again. Volunteers were asked for the perilous task of rowing officers ashore. Many were called, but few were chosen, and they were the envied of men. The excursion, however, was not all beer and skittles, for the hours were long and the lifeboat of the \"Massachusetts\" was not a pleasure craft. After a few hours they returned, and we overwhelmed them with questions in our eager curiosity about the island and the people, and the things to eat and"], [197, "The Camp at Ponce 117 drink. They had eaten mangoes, crackers and guava paste; they had drunk lime and soda with ice in it, and had heard vague tales of a hotel where food was to be had. In a word, the port of Ponce was most friendly \u2014 a place of pedlers of food and cigar ettes \u2014 and the enemy was far away in the hills. \"Sergeant Pat\" had been seen riding a tiny horse, his feet nearly touching the ground, and it had been learned that we were to have landed down the coast at Arroyo if we had not run aground. All day, off and on, steamers and tugs made fast now to our bow and now to our stern, trying to budge our beloved ship. Spray flew and heavy steel cables broke; but we moved not. Our hearts sank at the thought of another night on board; but in the afternoon the joyful order came to get saddles, packs and arms on deck. All the belong ings of the Troop (except the horses) were piled on the starboard hurricane deck, and we squatted in the midst of our possessions, waiting for the com mand to load them on the lighters. It came at last, and squad by squad we toiled around to port with our saddles, packs and arms and lowered them by ropes into the lighters alongside. Then we learned that we were not going ashore, but on board the cruiser \"Prairie\" for the night, our wretched craft having sprung a leak at last. We scrambled down"], [198, "History of Troop \"A\" 118 the side, some into the huge lifeboat of the \"Massa chusetts,\" the rest into lighters, and were merrily on our way to the \"Prairie.\" She lay a few hundred yards away, and was said to have been stationed there to guard against the Spanish torpedo boat \"Terror,\" which was still supposed to be at large. We were heartily welcomed on board by the crew (Naval Reserves from Massachusetts) ; and the good ship \"Prairie,\" with her clean wide decks and spick and span order \u2014 what a contrast she made to our lumbered up, foul smelling transport! The sailors gave us cool, clear water, hot tea, with milk, and hot ship biscuits. The earliest to arrive had mangoes and rice pudding! Our first ser geant exercised some secret influence, so that we had part of a deck to ourselves to sleep on. In the morning, after a breakfast of hardtack and coffee, we were towed ashore in a big lighter, and were in the enemy's country at last. We did not have to fight for a landing, alas! (as some said). Natives came out to pole us alongside the big pier, and as we scrambled ashore pedlers of mangoes and greasy little corn cakes, and boys with boards piled high with \"dulce coca,\" singing their melancholy song, plied us with their wares. We lingered on the pier for a while, and then marched to the square in front of the church, that was to be our camp until the"], [199, "SATTERLEE CORP.

The Philadelphians were already ensconced on the shady side of the church; some of them were trying to get picket line posts to hold in the soggy ground. In the afternoon we moved to the opposite side of the square to the cor ner, where our saddles were piled in cheerful con fusion. Here Frank Morse paid us a visit. He had come to Porto Ricoto join the\"Rough Riders ing none there he joined forces with Troop \"A,\" and afterward remained with us until we were mustered out. Some of those who were not on guard or on the detail to unload horses and stores, slept on the narrow piazzas of the houses, or wherever a patch of shade could be found. Others wandered through the little town and brought back stories of endless cheap cigars and cheaper meals of rice and beans and an occasional egg. Bread could be bought at greatly advanced prices \u2014 four centavos a small loaf \u2014 con scientiously haggling over the price, but ending by paying it. We spent the night lying where we could \u2014 under shelter when it was to be found, for rain was certain to fall. Many, however, were con tent with the pebbly road. The scuttling of land crabs and attack of mosquitoes made the night far from happy. Milkmen appeared at dawn, and the inevitable boy with his melancholy song of \"dulce coca.\""], [202, "History of Troop \"A\" 120 The milkmen milked the cows at the doorsteps directly into small necked bottles, a ring of in terested urchins and idle ox drivers watching the obviously virtuous process. (The milk we bought at our later camp must have reached the can of the pedler by a more devious and watery way.) Ox carts loaded with commissary stores soon silled the street \u2014 a slowly moving, patient procession. Those of the men who could get away invaded the dirty little restaurants for breakfast, as our commissary department was still clinging with patient affection to a combination of hardtack and canned tomatoes. Our horses began to come ashore as the day dragged along, and were picketed to the fence where the native washerwomen had been hanging their clothes. By nightfall about twenty horses were ashore, and Sergeant Emmet, with a detail of the lucky men whose horses had been landed, was sent to Ponce to make a camp. All turned out to help them root out their saddles, packs and arms from the mass of Troop \"A's\" belongings piled in utter confusion about the corner house; and, in cidentally, each man grasped his own as it came to view and piled it all together, thinking \u2014 foolish one! \u2014 that when he came to get his things, there they would be. Rain began to trickle as night fell, and all packs were ordered to be heaped under the"], [203, "The Camp at Ponce 121 eaves of the friendly house. Confusion reigned again, and swearing was heard in the morning. Horses came ashore steadily the next day, one lighterful being towed in by toiling horse marines of Troop \"A,\" other boatfuls by launches; so that by afternoon most of our cattle were ashore, and were led to Ponce and turned loose to graze in the inclosure where our camp was pitched. A running stream was near at hand, where horses could have water in plenty, and where we could bathe without stint. This abundance of water was real luxury \u2014 somewhat modified, perhaps, by the knowledge that dirty washerwomen, washing dirtier clothes, lined the banks above us. For it will be remem bered that, excepting on the short marches we made in Virginia, we had had scanty allowance of water for horse and man since we left New York. The encampment at Ponce was at first in shelter tents ranged along a barbed wire fence. The fence was soon hung from end to end with haversacks, canteens, blankets and underclothes of every size and color; ponchos and blankets were stretched from the tent-tops to the fence-posts to make larger the area protected from sun and rain. The tents and their additions, however, promised poor shelter from the storm that was always brooding darkly along the mountain-ridges beyond the city."], [204, "History of Troop \"A\" 122 All the tents were prudently ditched with what seemed sufficient trenches against floods as we had known them. In the first few storms they carried the water off. But one day the deluge came and the deepest ditches were as though they were not. Wide streams poured through the tents, soaking everything, and a saffron pond slowly crept from the picket line to the lowest of the tents. There was not a dry inch in camp. After the storm abated every one turned out to dig trenches that would defy Puerto Rico's worst. Deep into the fibrous soil they chopped and dug, leading wide channels to the ravine beyond the fence. Some even made raised floors of bamboo to make assurance doubly sure \u2014 and the next day the camp was moved. Cir cular tents were raised beyond the picket line, and they, after being well ditched, were proof against whatever came. Only three were needed at first, as the details under Lieutenant Frelinghuysen and Sergeant Cromwell had taken many men to the in terior. Some of us clung to the shelter tents, others swung hammocks from trees and posts and pro tected their beds from rain with various picturesque devices. Squads were no longer kept together \u2014 the men slept where they liked. \"B\" Troop, Second Cavalry, was camped in the field adjoining, and with it we were made into a"], [205, "DOG TENT CAMP \u2014 PONCE"], [206, ""], [207, "The Camp at Ponce 123 squadron under the command of Captain Hoppin, and were attached to the Headquarters of the Army. A running guard was now established, three pri vates, each to relieve the other, being enough to guard the camp. There was no corporal of the guard, which arrangement met with the unqualified approval of the non-coms. When \"B\" Troop left for the interior, the guard was increased to six men, and a corporal, and the heyday of the corporals was over. Details went each day aboard the \"Massachu setts\" till the medical, commissary and quartermas ter's stores were all ashore and in camp. The men who had this work to do found an hour now and then to sit in the corner store at the Playa and drink lime and soda with ice, or to get dinner \u2014 eggs, rice and beans, fried fish, perhaps, sour wine (if they wanted it), a kind of guava paste and coffee \u2014 at the little hotel around the corner, whose imperturbable, slowly moving proprietor nor prayers nor profanity could stir beyond his 'customed pace; or to smoke on his little balcony that overlooked the dreamy bay, where the black transports lay in sleepy calm, and natives lazily poled clumsy lighters ashore. The second day in camp we took the horses to the Playa to swim them in the sea. The water, warm as it was, freshened up men and horses wonderfully, and sev-"], [208, "History of Troop \"A\" 124 eral times afterward this excursion to the sea was repeated. The question that filled our minds these early days was whether we should be sent into action, and when, and where, and how. Attached to General Miles as his body-guard, we speculated upon what chance there would be of our getting on the firing line when Aibonito was stormed. Some said one thing and some said another, till one afternoon the familiar word was given around that \"there would be no more passes; no one could leave camp.\" Smiles were smiled, of course; but rumors of an attack to be made on the morrow (August 13th), though they were listened to lightly, gave a faint shade of serious ness to the familiar prohibition. Marching orders however, had come this time, and at dawn we were in the saddle, packed and equipped for the march to Coamo. Then came the command to loosen girths \u2014 we were not to march yet. The day wore along till finally we heard \"Unsaddle and place saddles in the rear of your horses and tie up to the picket line!\" Then rumor ran swiftly \u2014 peace had been declared. Some pooh-poohed; many cried, saying, \"I told you so.\" Later the rumor was confirmed \u2014 a Protocol had been signed. The first feeling that swept the camp was one of keen disappointment. To have waited so long and to have come so far and then to"], [209, "The Camp at Ponce 125 just miss the chance of a fight after all was irony of fate indeed. Cool reflection has since modified that disappointment. New speculations now seized upon us. What should we do now, and what next after that? Would there be patrol duty? Should we reach home before Thanksgiving? Would not the President send us to New York at once? In fine, the immediate des tiny of Troop \"A,\" N.Y.V., absorbed our entire attention. In the idle hours of waiting that followed, a taste for gaming developed with mushroom rapidity. There were no books or papers to read; with out, the sun was desperately hot, but under the friendly shade of the tents the poker games began to' go merrily. At first there was a game or two in the morning after stables, then perhaps one or two after midday mess, then all day long they lasted from stables till tattoo, with time out for morning water call and mess, and afternoon water call and mess, and evening parade. A bale of hay covered with a shelter tent for a table, seats of upturned pails (when one could find that luxury), very much used cards, and copper and silver coins of Puerto Rico, completed the outfit. Each contained its own measure of tor ture, but places in the games were at a premium. Then came the wheel to vary the monotony of the"], [210, "126 History of Troop \"A\" cards, and Troop \"A\" \u2014 warriors of renown \u2014 in the hour of peace returned to commercial pursuits. The Banos Minerales beyond the town were now filled every day, and the dining-room of the Hotel Francais every evening, with the troopers whose turn it was to go to town \u2014 and the turn came very often. We sat calmly at the same table with Briga diers, Colonels and Commanders in the Navy, and ate before their envious eyes the delicacies that the well-tipped waiter set before us in dyspepsia breed ing haste. Madame was very friendly. \"A\" troop ers were steady patrons, and kept the waiters good natured. Those whose day it was to stop in camp, the stern browed Commissary Sergeant Ward fed sumptu ously, now on hard kinds of things baked in rice, seasoned to the finest palate with curry; now on eggs scrambled with canned tomatoes, 'arf and 'arf ; sometimes with squash and yams and fried bananas; on grand occasions with fried fish and melons (no second helping). Bread he gave us, too, and to those who could not live without them, beans (\"meaning me,\" says Ernie Thomson). Then there were boiled milk and boiled eggs for the sick men and for those a little under the weather \u2014 and for anyone else who could wheedle the hard-eyed sa trap of the kettles. A dour man was he; but, allow-"], [211, "\"THE COMMERCIAL PURSUITS OF PEACE\" AT CAMP IN PONCE"], [212, ""], [213, "The Camp at Ponce 127 ing for circumstances, he fed us well. May he never plead in vain for a second helping! At break fast we could buy milk, as it was called, from milk venders who came to the border of the camp with their little cans, crying \"Leche! Leche!\" Nearly every day two women brought baskets of fruit, tiny strawberry bananas, the most delicious product of the island; mangoes, limes and, once, pineapples; and native men came with wooden trays of sweetish, insipid cakes and the same old \"dulce coca.\" In the hot noonday, as we came back from water, a softly smiling but very canny half-breed stood at the gate selling lime ice dipped from an undersized freezer with a funny little scoop \u2014 cinque centavos the glass, a large thimble. Always at mess times a row of na tives, old men and women, young ones, and children were ranged along the wire fence behind the kitchen, eager for any scrap of food that one might throw them. \"Look here!\" they cried in their pip ing voices, \"Look here! Look here!\" They balked at nothing. Even the hard black things in the rice didn't quench their enthusiasm, and bits of hard tack were gifts from heaven. When we had been in Porto Rico about two weeks it was found expedient to hire a small house in Ponce for the use of the sick of the Troop. Here the men were well cared for, receiving more atten-"], [214, "128 History of Troop \"A\" tion than would have been possible in the general hospital. Chic Childs and Jamie Clark were sent home on the Van Rensselaers' yacht, and Jack Iselin and Rob Barclay on the \"Lydia;\" H. Barclay, Line, Adee, Leigh, Bird, Cannon, Pinchot and Howard Kerner sailed later on the \"Relief.\" The days passed, one very like another. Lieu tenant Frelinghuysen and Sergeant Cromwell with their men were still in the interior; smaller details were scattered in various directions. Twelve men under Sergeant Phelps had just left camp for Utua do, and the rest of the Troop had hardly finished its world-famed midnight gallop to Santa Isabel, when word came that Troop \"A\" was ordered home. The various absentees were telegraphed for, and they lost no time in getting into camp, Sergeant Phelps' detail coming all the way from Utuado in twelve hours. But there was no need of such speed. We did not leave Porto Rico until a week later. Everyone was looking for mementos to take home \u2014 sabres, Mausers, machetes, trinkets, but tons; in fact, almost anything. Some got valuable relics \u2014 flags, guidons and beautiful decorations \u2014 for almost nothing. But the Porto Ricans were be ginning to understand the situation, and were soon peddling Spanish officers' hats, chevrons, swords, buttons and what-not at fabulous prices. What"], [215, "The Camp at Ponce 129 some men paid for buttons would have kept their throats moist at Sergeant Ward's Transport Bar Room and High Class Cafe all the way to New York. And as for the money paid for swords \u2014 it must have been pesos won at the gaming-bale. Cigars and cigarettes by the fifties and hundreds were bought; the factories were running overtime to fill orders. The purchases were packed in saddlebags and rolls. Many boxes were laid in the fine blue commissary chest. Of these some reached their owners, and others didn't. And thereby hangs a tale. One day a rumor drifted idly into camp that the horses were to be left in Porto Rico. To most of the men (the memory of the \"Massachusetts\" still rankling) it seemed too good to be true. In the bosoms of others, however, it pricked the core of vanity. To become doughboys, indeed! The gods forbid! As the rumor grew in strength, hot waxed the argument. Finally a vote was polled, to- take, or not to take the horses. The nays had it over whelmingly, and so, of course, the horses were taken, and the \"Just-like-the-regulars\" had their way after all. On the night of September 2nd we were told that the next day we were to embark on the \"Mississip pi,\" and that a start would be made at the peep o' dawn. At daybreak we were in the saddle, marching"], [216, "History of Troop \"A\" 130 down the familiar Playa road for the last time. We reached the wharf just ahead of \"C\" Troop, and after a delay loaded our horses on an enormous lighter and our saddles and packs and stores on a smaller one. Most of the men went on board in the after noon and chose snug places on deck to swing their hammocks. A detail of ten was left to load head quarters horses. Lucky ones \u2014 how pleased they were! At midnight, however, they, too, climbed on board, and slept where they fell. The next day they took what was left in the way of hammock room. Puerto Rico gave us a smiling farewell, as she had a smiling welcome. The sun sparkled as brightly on the water, and made as purple shadows on the lovely green hills; but we saw these things with different eyes. Our eager curiosity about the island, the people, the centipedes, the tarantulas, the rainy season, and all the other horrors enjoyably depicted in the Consular Report, not to mention the Spanish foe, had been more than satisfied. A few fortunate ones had, indeed, seen the swarthy Spaniard in his lair \u2014 and the Spaniard had seemed none the worse for the experience. All had learned that to be wet in Porto Rico is to be wet in a new way.

It is needless to say that those silver spoons with which, according to the press, we were all born, were not taken with us upon our glorious campaign. The knives of which I have spoken, forks of rude and simple construction, two oval tin plates, fitting one upon the other, one of them convertible into a miniature saucepan by means of an infolding handle, and a huge tin cup, big enough to serve as a wash basin, constituted the gas tronomic weapons by means of which we did cur awful execution.

They were not, to be sure, served with all the daintiness to which we were accustomed at St. Andrews coffee-stands, but they were palatable to hungry troopers and amply sustaining.

With what mingled feelings would they have observed the simple method of washing the dishes! With the passing 01 the troop from the service of the State to that of the nation, our rations, like our pay, became less liberal, and we fared as do the regulars. There is a fact not realized by our friends at home who try to supplement the soldier's bill of fare by donations of pies, cakes, candy, and even"], [224, "136 History of Troop \"A\" ice-cream, and that is that just as prize-fighters and football players must regulate their diet to get into condition for a contest, so must soldiers regu late theirs in order to be fit for the work before them. At home we should prefer crisp, tender wafers to hardtack, but for fitting us to endure soldiering the army biscuit is better; it makes us long for the fray, inspired by the hope that life will soon be over. Under the fostering care of the com missary, Walter Price, a canopy of barbaric splen dor was raised over our devoted heads, so that we and the flies might more comfortably enjoy the luxury of the mess. At the conclusion of our feasts slaves, led by one \"Peekskill,\" hastened to cleanse our exhausted dishes. Such was the ad ministration of this department that we flourished like the green bay tree.

The next morning, at 6.45, the detail fell in in heavy marching order. All extra clothing and equipment were left at Ponce in case the detail did not return. A quick march to the Playa to report to Headquarters was followed by a tedious wait; about noon, the cavalcade started guarding a car riage in which was about $50,000, it was rumored, to pay off the natives engaged in improving the road over the mountains. The road for several miles, or more than half the distance to Adjuntas, was finely macadamized and graded, and was built years ago by the Spaniards for military purposes. It led in a general northwesterly direction, winding around among the foothills and through sugar and coffee plantations. Presently there was an end of the good road, and from that point on there was no telling at what moment one's horse would stumble over a rock or mire in the treacherous-looking and innumerable mud puddles.

It took an endless amount of time to get Captain Evans' carriage past the ox teams, many of which were stalled in the narrow road. It took them three days to go from Ponce to Adjuntas.

Here the column was halted at the instance of Jamie Clark, one of the \"point\" that day, who came gallop ing furiously back to inform Captain Evans that the bridge was guarded by Spanish troops. After a brief survey of the situation the order \"Forward, March!\" was given, and the detail, every man with his hand on his pistol, advanced slowly down the road, only to find the supposed enemy to be two Puerto Rican policemen, with antiquated muskets, guarding the bridge and delirious with excitement and delight at the arrival of more Americanos. The same pleasure and excitement attended the march through the town, men throwing up their hats and running wildly through the streets shout ing \"Puerto Rico Americano !\" and women holding up their little naked brown babies to take in the sight. A rumor soon started to the effect that a force of Spanish troops were ambushed in the vi cinity and intended to attack the town that night. Utuado was held at this time by General Henry with a company of the Nineteenth Infantry under Captain Smith, a detachment of Troop \"B,\" Second Cavalry, and some Signal Corps men, and marked the limit of the American invasion in this part of the island."], [236, "History of Troop \"A\" 144 On account of the possibility of a night attack the detail was quartered in the old Spanish Civil Guard House, already comfortably filled by a de tachment of Troop \"B,\" Second Cavalry, and the picket line was stretched in the narrow street, on which the building faced. Of all the filthy, veno mous places to pass a night, that old guard-house was probably the worst encountered by Troop \"A\" anywhere in the tropics or elsewhere. The stable yard in the rear was a foot deep in a vile smelling compound of mud, manure and stagnant water, the odor from which pervaded the whole region, and must have fairly reeked with germs of all the dis eases that flesh is heir to. The men were allowed to take in the sights for a time after the horses were picketed and fed with the only kind of \"long green\" seen on the island. After mess, served, by the way, in the above men tioned court yard, the guard was detailed and the rest of the \"push\" lay down wherever they could find room, which was scarce. Lights were extin guished and snores beginning to be frequent, when Stillman was rudely brought out of the first stages of a heavy sleep by something on his face that seemed to cover it all at once. He made a pass at the thing in the dark, heard a dull, sickening thud against the opposite wall as \"it\" hit, and rose to in-"], [237, "The Frelinghuysen Lancers 145 vestigate, only to find the whole floor alive with big, shiny, brown cockroaches fully three inches long. At twelve a rumble like distant artillery was heard in the hills, accompanied by a severe shaking of the building. Pinchot, who was on guard in the street, rushed in and informed Lieutenant Frelinghuysen that the Spanish had opened fire in the hills. The latter, half dressed and hatless, rushed out into the street yelling \"To arms !\" In about ten seconds the whole street was alive with men armed to the teeth and looking for all sorts of trouble. The Lieutenant was presently informed that it was only an earth quake, and soon the men were sound asleep again. The incident was sufficiently exciting, however, for it was a midnight call to arms in the enemy's coun try, on the firing lines, so to speak, and furnished the imagination with plenty of material for the time being. Excitement began very early next day, for a crowd of patriots had unearthed a number of Spaniards in the hills, and brought them captive into town with the avowed intention of massacring them all. They were so bent on this, and so excited over it, that it was necessary to disarm captors, as well as captives, and put both under guard. While this was going on in the town a nervous individual appeared with a machete on the pasture where the horses were"], [238, "146 History of Troop \"A\" picketed and vowed that he owned the earth with a fence around it, and that no horse, by \"ginger blue,\" could be picketed on his ranch. After his wrath was spent from sheer fatigue it was gradually learned that a certain part of the field was not to be used for the horses by an agreement with the officers, and that one horse had overstepped the limit, and the error rectified, he at once became ex tremely affable and wanted to blow the whole crowd off to a drink. That night was spent in more comfortable quar ters at the telegraph station, where the detail fell in with Lieutenant Patterson, or more properly speak ing Lieutenant Patterson fell in with the detail, hav ing been sent by General Henry to countermand the order to return to Ponce, which, it seems, Lieu tenant Frelinghuysen had received; and August 13th orders came to saddle early and move out of town. Nobody knew our destination; some said home, others San Juan; but it was all guesswork. The de tail moved out across the bridge by which the town had been entered and then down a side road, where a halt was ordered. This lasted till afternoon, when orders came to pitch camp. The spot selected, near the banks of a rushing stream, overhung in places by enormous clumps of bamboo, was one of the prettiest on the whole trip. Of course, a bath was"], [239, "OUR HORSES PICKETED INSIDE THE BARRICADES THROWN UP BY THE SPANIARDS AROUND THE CATHEDRAL AT LARES."], [240, ""], [241, "The Frelinghuysen Lancers 147 in order after the horses were picketed with lariats and the tents were set up in a field of sensitive plant. The path left by a man in walking through it re minded one of that made by a mowing machine in a clover patch. Much comment on all sides was caused by the appearance that night of twinkling lights far up in the hills, suggesting signal-lights of the enemy, but it turned out afterwards that they came from native huts among the trees. Lieutenant Frelinghuysen had spent the afternoon construct ing an elaborate palm leaf and bamboo affair to keep off the night air, and retired in all the state of an African prince, having given up his cot to one of the men who was sick. About midnight the whole edifice collapsed about his ears, and the Lieutenant rushed out in a towering passion and pajamas just in time to see the offender, a white pack mule, disappear in the fog and gloom. Orders came early on Sunday morning, the 14th, requiring ten men to escort Lieutenant Preston, of the Ninth Cavalry, under a flag of truce to the town of Ciales, situated about fifteen miles north east of Utuado and then occupied by the Spanish. That meant that four men must be left in camp, and lots were drawn in fear and trembling. It fell to Adee, Clark, Henry and Stillman to hold the"], [242, "History of Troop \"A\" 148 fort at Utuado till the rest returned, and a more disgusted quartette can hardly be imagined. They sat around watching the others pack up and move out, and then retired to the shade of their respect ive tents, \"all wore down\" and cursing and sweat ing profusely. At about eleven that morning a troop of cavalry arrived on the scene and must have been sur prised to see an army camp composed of two dog tents and four troopers. The latter lay and watched the proceedings till a number of familiar gray shirts roused them to a closer inspection. It turned out to be the rest of Captain Hoppin's Troop \"B\" of the Second Cavalry, with one of the rapid fire gun details from Troop \"A.\" The men were Sergeant Cromwell, Lance Corporal Satter lee and Privates Smith, Crowell and Pierson. The troop had hardly unsaddled when a detail of four teen men was called for to escort Lieutenant Ervin L. Phillips, Sixth Cavalry, on an expedition to Lares, a town of 18,000 inhabitants, about seven teen miles northwest of Utuado, strongly fortified, and occupied by about eight hundred Spanish reg ulars. Captain Hoppin very kindly told Cromwell that our nine men could form a part of the detail if they wished. The others were quickly chosen from \"B\" Troop, and by one o'clock the detail, un-"], [243, "The Frelinghuysen Lancers 149 der the immediate command of Lieutenant Lock ridge, was ready to start. The trail struck off into the hills to the north west of Utuado, 'and soon became and stony or else covered with mud and water. In fact, Adee's horse fell, throwing its rider and covering them both from head to foot with a coat ing of red mud. The horse, that wall-eyed old brute known as \"Montana first,\" got up dead lame, and in consequence Adee was ordered back to Utuado, much to the regret of every one. As he was taken sick with typhoid two days later, his fall may be regarded as a dispensation of Providence, for he could never have been taken out over that trail alive. About sundown, after several halts to interview passing natives, the detail turned to the left from the trail and made camp in a grassy spot four miles from Lares. A compact had been made with the regulars by which they agreed to- do; the cooking and to water and feed the horses, while the \"A\" men were to do the guard duty. It was thought advisable to send a messenger to the Spanish Commander in Lares stating that under the terms of the Protocol the American troops were to occupy Puerto Rico and requesting him to evacu ate. The messenger, a native, mounted his pony and"], [244, "History of Troop \"A\" 150 disappeared in the dusk in the direction of Lares. About nine o'clock, someone with a voice like a fog horn began to yell from up in the hills \"America!\" \"America!\" It turned out to. be the messenger, who had not cared to run into the sentries and had taken the precaution of disturbing the peace of the sur rounding population before he made his appearance. Shortly after this Sergeant Ford, of Troop \"B,\" told the men that the Lieutenant wanted to see them up by the camp fire. The officer's words were brief and to the point: \u2014 \"The Spanish Commander refuses to recognize our flag of truce, and has not heard of any Protocol having been signed. I anticipate an attack to-night and wish you to sleep with your pistols and ammunition belts on and your carbines at your sides. In case a shot is fired I want you to join me instantly by that tree near my hammock.\" There wasn't much sleep left in the crowd. The Lieutenant posted a vidette guard, composed of Sergeant Cromwell, Smith, Henry and Pierson, in a clump of bushes a few hundred yards down the road, and a sentry posted in camp. Two men, with Sergeant Ford, shortened the horses' lariats and brought them closer to camp. The night was almost pitch dark and cloudy. A crowd of natives, who had followed along, were camped in the rear of the detail, and kept the sentry on the alert. The messenger"], [245, "G. S. WALLACE SMITH SGT. CROMWELL PIERSON SGT. E. M.

It was not what might be called a restful night. Satter lee's nerves were so wrought upon by Cromwell when the latter waked him up at one o'clock to go on guard that he went out and challenged one of the pack mules. The night passed entirely without incident, and with nothing except the unusual sensations to make it memorable. Soon after dawn orders were given to break camp, and by sunrise the detail was con- tinuing its journey toward Lares. This looked in- teresting in view of the attitude of the Spanish the night before. The trail, if anything, was worse than on the previous day, and the horses' feet were already in bad shape. Suddenly, through a rift in the foliage, the white buildings of Lares came in view, and, just as the detail arrived at the foot of a steep rock hill and emerged from the woods, something else came into view, namely, the Spanish trenches thrown up on a hill about eight hundred yards on the right. A halt seemed to be in order. The Spanish could be seen distinctly moving around inside their earth- works, some in white helmets and others in little green caps. Presently, a flag of truce was stuck up outside their trenches, and Lieutenant Lockridge and his interpreter, also with a flag of truce, went"], [248, "History of Troop \"A\" 152 ahead. He arrived at an understanding with the Spanish officer, who had received advices during the night from San Juan, and returned in about three hours. The detail now moved forward into the town. The Spanish had abandoned the trenches in which they had first been seen, and none were visible as the Americans, black and forbidding looking, in drip ping ponchos, crossed the bridge at the foot of a steep hill and entered the narrow streets. These for a few minutes were deathly quiet, and then swarmed with natives as soon as the latter became assured of the peaceful character of our intentions. Traces of the Spanish occupation, however, were numerous in the rifle pits and barbed wire fences by which every road and alley leading up to the summit of the hill was blockaded. The only road available was one which the natives had just opened. The arrival of the first \"Americanos\" occasioned a wild demonstration, for Lares had been the Span ish stronghold in that part of the island, and the natives had suffered accordingly. Nothing could exceed the enthusiasm which greeted the troopers on every side. The public school house, \"por ninos,\" adjoining the Cathedral in the centre of the town, had been cleaned and scrubbed out for the reception of the soldiers, and a private house just below placed"], [249, "ATHEDRAL AT LARES, SHOWING BARRICADES AND LOOPHOLES PUNCHED IN THE FRON WALL JUST ABOVE THE MAIN CORNICE."], [250, ""], [251, "The Frelinghuysen Lancers 153 at the disposal of Lieutenant Lockridge. The picket line was laid in the cathedral plaza, or terrace, and the tired beasts were soon knee deep in the long, fresh grass that a string of natives brought up and deposited there. The Cathedral, too, at the highest point and centre of the town, had been fortified as if for a last stand, and reminded one of a picture of Saragossa. The tiles of the plaza about the Cathedral had been torn from their places, piled up along the edge of the terrace and covered with sacks of earth and gravel, between which were left apertures for the Mausers; even the doors were protected by breastworks, and the towers were pierced with loopholes. The fellows lived on the fat of the land that day. It took some time, however, to get used to the sen sation of being regarded as an animal in a cage. The population hung around outside in droves, staring with eyes and mouths wide open. One would think they would tire of it after a while, but those dagos would stand by the hour, some of them in exactly the same position, taking in everything. All the lame, halt and blind from the surrounding boroughs were brought in and deposited on the doorstep of the barracks \u2014 horrible cases of elephantiasis, tumor, epilepsy and very likely leprosy \u2014 until finally Dr. \"Letch\" Smith drove them off as a health precan-"], [252, "History of Troop \"A\" 154 tion. It was fully two days before the crowd around the school-house diminished to any appreciable ex tent. A serenade by the most excruciating native band, which planted itself directly under our win dows, was the feature of the first evening; it was well meant, but made night hideous, and the intense enthusiasm excited among the natives by the wild airs made a riot or outbreak of some kind seem probable. The detail occupied the town for three days. Dur ing that time a patrol and sentry (\"A\" men exclu sively) were kept on guard day and night, the for mer to watch the natives and report any gathering, or put a stop to any demonstration that might be in process of organization. The feelings of the men, as they patrolled the dark, narrow streets at night in a town of that size, miles away from the American army, and not knowing whether or not treachery was at work behind the fast-closed shutters of those rickety old houses, can better be imagined than described. Pierson was accosted one night by an excited individual who stoutly maintained that a Spanish sympathizer was about to start on a tour of rapine and massacre, and demanded that he be taken out and shot. Pierson, with a great show of con cern, accompanied the native to his house and put a red chalk mark on his door, assuring him that the"], [253, "The Frelinghuysen Lancers 155 sign would protect him and his household from all troubles, and sent him on his way rejoicing. Several other false alarms of a like nature were given, but nothing serious happened within the patrol limits. Two Spanish sympathizers were killed in the sub urbs, however, which tended to increase the appre hension of trouble. The crowds about the barracks gradually diminished, and the people returned to their accustomed routine of life. A refreshing incident was the appearance in Lares of a Dr. Ascenjo, a Puerto Rican, who had grad uated at a medical school in Brooklyn and who was full of interesting information. The second day was marked by the arrival in town of the former alcalde of the place, who had been exiled by the Spanish. The whole population was at his heels, once more wild with delight. His more intimate friends crowded about, kissing him and vieing with each other for the honor of holding his horse. On the afternoon of the third day, Wednesday, August 17th, hurry orders were unexpectedly re ceived to saddle up and to keep all arms close at hand. The latter part of the order lent an air of distinct excitement to the occasion, and was quite a blow, for most of the men had made up their minds to a quiet stay in Lares till reinforcements arrived."], [254, "156 History of Troop \"A\" However, in fifteen minutes the detail was ready to move out, and took the trail back in the direction of Utuado. It looked like a night march, but less than a mile outside the town Lieutenant Lockridge turned sharp to the right and entered a grassy lot, where camp was to be made. Before giving orders to unsaddle he called the men to attention and said : \"I want you to know that the only reason we are leaving Lares is because I have received peremptory orders to go back to Utuado. I also want you to feel that I appreciate the excellent work you men have done on this trip, under most trying circum stances. No soldiers in the world could have done it any better.\" No tents were put up that night, for the time was taken up after supper by a musical seance over the camp-fire till taps. Each man slept where his saddle dropped, and was up bright and early, ready for anything. The return to Utuado was about half accom plished when at a turn in the road Lieutenant Fre linghuysen and the Ciales crowd rode up. They were on their way to Lares and other towns in the western part of the island as an escort to Lieutenant Preston, of the Ninth Cavalry.

The night was spent in Lares, and next morn ing, Friday, August 19th, the detail departed for Las Marias over the vilest trail yet en countered. It was \"by trooper\" all the way, and slow at that. At times the coffee-bushes hung so low over the trail that it was a question whether horse or man could make his way through. At one time the report of a gun brought a sharp order to prepare arms for instant service, and a halt was or dered until a reconnaissance revealed that it was some native shooting birds. The four men from \"B\" Troop had been left in Lares to garrison the town, but departed that morning by order of Lieu tenant Preston, who was overtaken by a courier and told that the Spanish were coming back to Lares and refused to enter if any American soldiers re mained. Las Marias was reached toward the middle of the afternoon, after fording a very deep and rapid stream, in which the pack mules had the worst of it. The banks of the stream on the farther side were strewn with band music, old helmets and other paraphernalia which the Spanish had abandoned on"], [258, "158 History of Troop \"A\" their retreat after the fight at Las Marias, and the battle-field, too, was suggestive of disaster, though it was several days after General Schwan's victory. Just outside of Las Marias the detail was halted by a provost guard of the Eleventh Infantry posted on a hill commanding the road, but the answer to the challenge, \"U. S. Troops, Lieutenant Preston and a scouting party,\" was satisfactory. No stop was made in the town, which differed, ex ternally, in no respect from all the others, and the detail halted at an abandoned camp, about four miles farther on, where the mud was deep and sticky from the tramp of men and horses, and the grass had become a memory. It rained nearly all night, and the whole place was afloat. The entire time of the sentries was occupied in keeping the camp fire lit. Altogether the morn ing dawned on as wet, dirty, cold and disgruntled a crowd as one would care to meet, and not till some hot coffee, served at a wayside inn, had gotten in its work and the sun had dried things up a little, did the spirits of the men begin to rise. The meeting with a battery of the Fifth Artillery struggling up a hill through six or eight inches of mud helped to make everybody feel things might be worse.

It was not an unmixed blessing, however, for it meant a steady trot for five miles down hill and through the town. Once there, troubles were at an end for the time being. The horses en- joyed their liberty in the back yard of an old ware- house, which the men shared with a guard detail of the First Kentucky. Horses and property were put in charge of one man, the rest being left to their own devices. That meant a bath in the old-fashioned cement bathtubs at the Hotel de Paris, or in the dilapidated showers at the Spanish barracks, and a dinner and long smoke on the front porch, where officers and men mingled freely without distinction of rank. \"Madame,\" who kept the hotel and spoke any language but English, showed an extraordinary amount of interest in the new arrivals and did much for their comfort.

M., and the seven mile trot that fol lowed, the halt for a cup of coffee in a country store, and the night ride till two A. M. through darkness, rain and mud will remain long in the memory of those who had to go through it. The village of San German was passed about midnight. Two hours later the detail arrived at Sabana Grande, where the local police station had to serve again as shelter, and the horses had the whole corral behind to themselves. It was weary work dragging one's wet heavy equip ment up those stairs and making a bed afterward at two A. M., but in fifteen minutes at most, every man was dead to the world, the guard duty being left to a couple of Puerto Rican policemen. Up again at eight o'clock, a hasty breakfast, sad dle up and forward, march! This time the trail struck up into the mountains from Sabana Grande, and the scenery was equal to any on the whole trip. As the top of the ridge was reached Playa de Ponce could be seen dimly, with the fleet of transports at anchor in the bay. On the summit the detail halted and interviewed a couple of Frenchmen who lived there in a hut, for God knows what reason, and whose sole offering in the way of refreshment on a hot day was some anisette strong enough to walk alone. They had not heard of the Protocol, knew"], [261, "CATHEDRAL AND STATUE OF COLUMBUS IN PLAZA OF MAYAGUEZ"], [262, ""], [263, "The Frelinghuysen Lancers 161 only vaguely that there had been a war and appar ently did not care. From the summit the trail wound down hill in frightful grades that used up the horses' feet fearfully. There will be horseshoes on that trail to arouse the wonder of the natives probably till the end of time, for it could not have been used more than twice a year. Getting the horses shod had caused no end of trouble during the whole trip, for few native blacksmiths had any thing but small shoes for their own horses, and when they had, were so afraid of the cavalry horses on account of their size that it took about six men to accomplish it. This was so marked at Mayaguez that Pierson turned the owner of the shop out of house and home and spent all Sunday shoeing up the whole fifteen, and he did it well, too, considering the limited facilities. Lieutenant Preston was anxious to reach Adjun tas that night, but we did not make it, and were forced to camp. The tents were pitched in a beauti ful grassy field adjoining an old hacienda, and the tiredest crowd that ever lived slept the sleep of the weary that night. They had covered in the twenty four hours since leaving Mayaguez what would be equivalent on the plains to a sixty mile march.

They were escorting Lieutenant Langhorne and guarding a large sum of money, which was being carried through to Utuado. It had been two weeks since we had seen any Troop \"A\" men, and it seemed like a meeting of long lost brothers. The night was spent in the old plaza in Adjuntas, where those who had enough energy left put up their dog-tents in the \"card-board garden.\" The next morning, August 24th, at about seven, our detachment left Adjuntas bound for Utuado. It was rather a disgusted crowd, for most of us had visions of Ponce and an occasional rest, but about half way over, a native overtook the detail with a message to Lieutenant Frelinghuysen. It contained orders to return to Ponce to take the transport home. After three cheers for Lieutenant Preston, who kept on to Utuado, the crowd set up a howl of delight that must have startled the natives, and there was no lagging the rest of the day.

T a very early hour the day after the Frelinghuy- sen Lancers had left Ponce I was awakened by some- one speaking my name. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and recognized my Lieu- tenant. \"Get on your clothes,\" he said. \"I have something for you to do.\" Little time was lost in obeying his order, and in a few moments I was out of the barracks, trudging behind him, carbine and sabre in hand. The lieu tenant left me at a small frame house, saying as he went away that I was wanted inside. I pulled down my blouse in the back, took off my hat, ran my fingers over my hair (more from habit than from any idea of improving its appear ance), mounted the steps and entered a small room. It was quite dark, but at first glance I took in a"], [270, "History of Troop \"A\" 166 small table in one corner at which sat a general offi cer busily engaged in writing by the aid of a candle stuck in a bottle. Stretched out on a sofa near him was a man sleeping, whom I surmised was one of the staff. It was several minutes before General Stone (for it was he) looked up from his work. When he did so I saluted, saying at the same time in a low tone, \"Orderly, sir.\" \"Step outside,\" he said, \"I will be ready for you in a minute.\" He soon appeared carrying in his hand several large envelopes, which he instructed me to care fully put away on my person and convey to General Miles with all haste. It was entirely too early to expect anything from the commissary, so I did the best I could in the way of breakfast by going over what was left from the night before, mounted my horse and headed for Headquarters. Several months had passed since I had been my own master, and to be once more free, so to speak, did not go unappreciated by me. When I got well into the country, however, an entirely new sen sation began to come over me. It seemed very wild and lonely, and several times I caught myself look ing back over my shoulder with more than common"], [271, "Special Delivery 167 interest when a twig snapped, or a bird suddenly flew up from the roadside. This very uncomfort able feeling soon passed away, however, and gave place to a much more happy condition of mind. I began to whistle and hum bits of song and, in fact, enjoyed life immensely. Since leaving Adjuntas I had been going on a fast trot and by noon had covered probably fourteen miles and was well into the mountains. Up to this time I had not seen anyone. Making a sharp turn in the road, however, I suddenly came upon two natives who were engaged in wood chopping, using, in place of axes, long, heavy machetes. I drew rein as I saw them, they being about one hundred feet from me. They seemed quite as interested in me as I was in them, and a spirited conversation sprang up between them, interspersed with many gestures. Finally, one dropped his knife and, jumping the low log fence that separated us, approached me, making as he came wild gestures down the road and appar ently much excited. To this day I have been unable to form any idea as to just what the trouble was, but the native's extraordinary behavior had a very apparent effect on me, for soon I discovered myself indulging in the most frantic gesticulations and facial motions, first pointing down the road, then at my carbine and finally at myself, ending up with"], [272, "168 History of Troop \"A\" the most furious noddings of my head \u2014 all of which the natives seemed to agree with perfectly. It soon occurred to me that nothing very definite could be gained by conversing with my newly made acquaintances, so I decided to ride on. Just before rounding a turn in the road I looked back and saw the men still gazing intently after me. The condi tion of affairs did not strike me as particularly pleas ing, but I could think of no way to improve them. After having gone about five hundred yards I de cided that something ought to be done; moreover, I was approaching a particularly gloomy turn in the road. So, dismounting, I tied my horse to a tree, took my carbine from the boot, and began climbing an almost perpendicular slope which rose above me. Finally, I reached a place, probably two hundred feet above the road, which offered an excellent view of the surrounding country, particularly in the di rection in which I was most interested; but, being unable to see anything, I again resumed my journey with very much the same feeling that one has when preparing for an ice-cold bath, and arrived without incident at Headquarters late that evening.

There were increased rumors of an attack, but nothing occurred. Lieutenant Pat terson, our own \"Pat,\" of General Henry's staff, came through with orders to await the General's arrival, and later, to the intense satisfaction of every man, due to the prospect of immediate active ser vice, we were transferred from General Miles's body guard to General Henry's headquarters. General Henry reached Utuado the next day, leaving the balance of his brigade strung out a num ber of miles back over the mountain road, and estab lished his headquarters. It was said he issued orders for the Troop \"A\" detachment to leave the follow ing morning to reconnoitre the Spaniards' position at the town of Lares, and it seemed that a few hours only would intervene before the Krag-Jorgensen carbines would have a chance at their outposts. That very afternoon, however, news of the protocol was received, and consequently the Lares scouting trip was abandoned. About the same time the na tives brought in stories to the effect that the Span iards at Ciales had shot down in the streets of that town a number of men, women and children upon almost no provocation whatever. General Henry immediately ordered that ten men from our detail proceed to Ciales under a flag of truce to notify the"], [281, "The Ciales Expedition 173 Spaniards of the protocol, present to them a copy of the proclamation which had been promulgated by General Henry and investigate as far as possible what foundation, if any, there was for these rumors. As at this time there were fourteen men in the detachment it became necessary to draw lots to see which four should remain. This was done, and \"Pete\" Stillman, George Adee, \"Jamie\" Clark and Horace Plenry drew the short straws. The trip was to last three days, and the two \"mule skinners,\" Jim Ross and Ed Anderson, were to go along with six pack mules to carry the tent-rolls, provisions for the men and feed for the horses. On the morning of August 14th the expedition got under way, consisting of First Lieutenant Pres ton, Ninth Cavalry, representing General Henry, Second Lieutenant Frelinghuysen, Sergeant Frank Bowne, Corporal \"Foxy\" Leigh, Corporal Arthur Brown and Privates Rowe Bradley, Gus Wallace, Amos Pinchot, Jack Grannis, \"Jimmie\" Beales, Ly man Dyer and George Redington. In addition to these were Ross and Anderson with the pack mules. We had proceeded about half way through Utua do when there came dashing up, mounted on fiery little native horses, eight or ten Puerto Ricans, one of whom was to act as our guide and interpreter. They immediately demanded a supply of arms that"], [282, "History of Troop \"A\" 174 they might assist in annihilating the large force of Spaniards holding Ciales. The interpreter looked at the handful of men behind Lieutenant Preston and asked if they were all he intended bringing, say ing they were insufficient for the purpose, but the interpreter was assured that no more men were needed, and was also informed that he and his com rades would not be furnished with arms. After a short confab the expedition finally got under way. Just outside of the town a halt was made, while a suitable pole was cut, to which was attached a large white towel belonging to \"Foxy\" Leigh; this served as a flag of truce. The march throughout the day was very severe on the horses, as we proceeded along a mere mountain trail, which was very rough and steep most of the time. It often became abso lutely necessary to dismount and assist the horses in scrambling up the more difficult places. During the afternoon the detachment passed through the town of Jayuya. Our reception was tremendous in its enthusiasm, and every step of the way was like that of a triumphant march. The peo ple crowded up to. the sides of our horses yelling at every other breath \"Viva los Americanos !\" \"Puerto Rico Americano !\" It was as though we had come to deliver them from slavery and the most oppressive bondage. The Alcalde and other authorities of the"], [283, "The Ciales Expedition 175 town urged that we remain and accept of their hos pitality, but Lieutenant Preston said that we must press on, and we did so. This town had but a few hundred population, but its people created a demon stration never to be forgotten. All along the trail it was the same story to a greater or less degree. We were the first Americans to pass through that region, and the natives' admiration and welcome appeared unlimited. They seemed to- think that our few men were going to drive the Spaniards to the north coast and into the sea with but a single effort, and that thereafter they were to be free from the hated Spanish. All through the mountains are scat tered squalid huts, in which live one or more families. The huts themselves are small thatched affairs, generally having one room, and only two or three at the most. They are furnished with barely more than a wooden table and a few rough chairs. Several generations seem to be represented in each hut, and what they do. for a living and how they exist is almost beyond comprehension; it would be hard to conceive of human beings in these modern times existing in a more primitive condition. Occasionally a profitable appearing coffee plantation or fruit farm will be seen, but these are few and far between, especially in this section of the island. Finally, just as it was growing dark, we camped"], [284, "History of Troop \"A\" 176 on the top of a high mountain, and, after a welcome mess of hardtack, bacon, coffee and fried green ban anas, we crawled into our \"dog\" tents, leaving one sentinel posted, with special instructions to see that the flag of truce did not blow down. In the morning as soon as it was light, all were up preparing to get an early start. The forenoon of the second day was practically a repetition of the first day's march. We were joined by a couple of hundred native men, women and children, who had fled from Ciales, and, as we pro ceeded, this number constantly increased. These people were anxious to return to their homes under our protection, and they all told incredible stories of killing and looting by the Spaniards. The trail was even worse than the day before, and on one occasion Lieutenant Preston, who has been all through the West, and who was on the recent government relief expedition to the Klondike, remarked, \"I have been on a great many trails in my day, but this beats any thing I have ever seen.\" We approached Ciales about one o'clock. By this time there were three or four hundred natives ac companying us on every side, some on the little horses, but the great majority on foot.

As we neared the town, Lieutenant Preston ordered the natives to maintain absolute silence, and he took the further precaution, which subsequent events proved to have been most fortunate, to send on a messenger to notify the Spaniards that we were coming under a flag of truce, and at the same time to deliver to them a copy of General Henry's proc lamation. This also gave the Spaniards an abun dance of time in which to prepare to meet us in any manner they might choose, an opportunity of which they took immediate advantage. At last, while descending a long, gradual hill, the sides of which rose up almost perpendicularly on either hand to a height of eight or ten feet, and just as we were within about a hundred yards of a curve in the road, we came upon two Spanish sentinels, who ordered us to halt and started running in our direction. We halted. Lieutenant Preston, who was in advance, called back, \"Get ready, boys; I think we are in for it!\" at the same time reaching for his pistol. However, he told the interpreter to inform them that we were under a flag of truce and were there to consult the Spanish officer. The men stopped, removed the bayonets from their rifles and put them in their belts, but their pieces were allowed to remain cocked. The soldiers then came up to within a convenient speaking distance. They were"], [288, "History of Troop \"A\" 178 very much excited. Lieutenant Preston, talking at all times through the interpreter, asked them who their officer was. One pointed to the sergeant's chevrons on his arm and said that their officer was not at hand. Lieutenant Preston said that he could not talk to the Sergeant, that he must go back and tell his commander to come and meet the American officer half way between the lines. This the man did, and shortly afterward Lieutenant Pedro Ladesma came riding around the curve in the road, accom panied by two civilians. Lieutenant Preston, with the interpreter at his side, and with Corporal Leigh directly behind him holding the flag of truce, rode forward and met the Spaniard about one hundred feet in front of our de tachment, and there held a consultation. The two civilians, who we afterward learned were soldiers in disguise, stood on either side of the road but a few feet away with cocked Remington rifles in their hands. Ladesma himself had drawn his pistol from its holster and had it cocked and thrust in the pommel roll near where his right hand rested. In addition to these men there were four soldiers, who advanced and stood near by. All had their pieces cocked. Back at the head of the road a half dozen others, fully armed, took position facing us."], [289, "The Ciales Expedition 179 After shaking hands with Ladesma, Lieutenant Preston delivered to him a copy of the prodamation and said that he was sent to inform them of the protocol and that hostilities had ceased. Ladesma stated that he had heard nothing of the protocol from his government, and could take no notice of it until he did. Lieutenant Preston asked if we could enter the town, and he said \"No.\" Lieuten ant Preston also asked suddenly what had happened two days before. At this question both the civilians, Ladesma and one of the men began talking very volubly and excitedly, during which the interpreter gathered that there had been some trouble between the Spaniards and the natives upon the re-entry of the former, they having left Ciales several days be fore and returned, and that a few inhabitants and soldiers had been hurt. Lieutenant Preston was finally informed that there had been some trouble, but nothing serious. When asked if anyone had been killed, they all shook their heads vehemently and said \"No.\" Lieu tenant Preston then wanted to know if the resi dents who had followed us back could be allowed to enter the town and return to their homes un molested. The Spanish officer said \"Certainly,\" and the interpreter informed the crowd that they could go in without us. None of the crowd, however,"], [290, "History of Troop \"A\" 180 showed any desire to take advantage of this per mission and none of them went. As a strange coincidence, while the consultation was taking place an orderly galloped up to the Span ish officer and handed him certain papers. Ladesma read them and shrugged his shoulders. In response to a question, he said they were nothing. Never theless a copy was given to Lieutenant Preston and the interpreter attempted to read them, but he did not seem able to make them out readily, and it was not until night by the camp-fire that they were read. They proved to be notice of the protocol and in structions to the Spaniards to turn in their arms within a certain time. Lieutenant Preston again requested that we be allowed to enter the town. Ladesma said that if we wanted to wait for five or six hours he would send to his superior officer and find out whether or not it could be allowed, but he could not take the responsibility personally. This ended the interview, Ladesma shaking hands with Lieutenants Preston and Frelinghuysen, the latter having ridden up meanwhile. The Spanish officer was a very disagreeable and treacherous looking man. The interpreter and others said that he had a very bad reputation throughout the island. During the conference our detachment was stand ing in column of twos, and we had been instructed"], [291, "The Ciales Expedition 181 what to do in case of an emergency. Lieutenant Frelinghuysen had ordered Ed Anderson to hold all the horses in the event of an order to dismount and fight on foot or deploy as skirmishers. This did not appeal to Anderson's fighting blood, and Jim Ross, his companion, came forward and said in a respect ful manner, \"Ed wants to know if the natives can't hold the horses, as if there is going to be any amuse ment he would like to be in it.\" These two \"mule skinners\" were true Western cowboys; they had served in the United States Cavalry against the In dians, had been \"cow-punchers\" a greater part of their lives and had been to the Klondike. Ross, in addition, was a good deal of a pugilist, having en countered nearly every one of note in the West, and at one time holding the championship of the Navy for several years. After Lieutenants Preston and Frelinghuysen had shaken hands with the Spanish officer the order was given, \"Twos, left about, march!\" and the re turn trip was begun. Sergeant Bowne and Private Beales acted as rear guard. At this point it was developed that during all this time the little detach ment had been thoroughly ambushed, for as we started back, and after the main body had gotten beyond a curve three or four hundred feet from the halting-place, the rear guard, in looking around, as"], [292, "182 History of Troop \"A\" they did continually for fear of treachery, saw a large number of Spaniards coming down from posi tions where they had been concealed on either side of the road. There had been ample time to arrange this ambuscade, as the messenger sent on ahead had preceded us by a full half hour. The holding up of the detail in a place that could not have been better adapted for an ambush, and the secret concealment of men where, at one volley, they could have completely wiped it out, were planned with sagacious cunning. There is no doubt that the least hostile move, or any other possible excuse, would have caused serious trouble for those few men a day and a half's march from the nearest American soldier. The whole treatment of the flag of truce was outrageous, and had there been a less cool and experienced officer than Lieutenant Pres ton to deal with the situation the outcome might have been very different. Nothing occurred throughout the balance of the day, and so far as we know the Spaniards did not follow us.

August 1 6th we returned to Utuado, arriving there early in the afternoon. Several miles out from the town we met Lieutenant Patterson and a detail of four regulars from Troop \"B\" on their way to Jayuya, General Henry having received reports that brigands were terrorizing the whole neighborhood. \"Pat\" was sent to investigate.

Captain Scott worked the deal so as to get a bed in the planter's house, and was very considerate of us (as most regular army officers are of their men), hav ing coffee made in the house and buying milk, sugar, eggs, bread, &c, for us.

These two roads form an acute angle of about eighty degrees, the military road skirting certain foot-hills on its western side, the other road bordering certain hills on its eastern side, the intervening territory for several miles south of Coamo being a comparatively open plain. On the morning of August nth, 1898, Major General James H. Wilson, commanding the First Division of the First Army Corps, was encamped with 3,000 infantry, a battery of artillery and a troop of cavalry, on the military road, about four miles south of Coamo. His general orders were to advance straight along this road, and, doubling up the Span iards in front of him, to continue until the grand objective point, San Juan, should be reached. The Spaniards occupied Coamo and had outposts thrown along the military road for several miles to the south, which was protected by hastily thrown up breast works. The other road was commanded by a block house, about a mile to the southeast of the town, and the two roads together effectually commanded the intervening plain. About two o'clock in the morning Colonel Biddle, of General Wilson's staff, following a carefully re connoitred route, led the Sixteenth Pennsylvania, by a wide detour, to the northwest, for the purpose of striking this military road a short distance to the"], [307, "The Capture of Coamo 191 north of Coamo and preventing any retreat from that place to the Spanish fortifications established on Assomanti Mountain. This move was made suc cessfully, and without giving warning to the Span iards encamped in and near Coamo. Several hours later the Second and Third Wiscon sin regiments, supported by the artillery, moved directly up the centre of the valley to a point about two miles south of Coamo. The plan was to force the Spaniards through the town of Coamo and under the guns of the Pennsylvanians, who were waiting above. The artillery, from a position on the right of the line, opened fire on the blockhouse on their right, which was only feebly returned, and after a few minutes the blockhouse was in flames, and the Spaniards were seen to be retreating hastily into the town. The infantry was then deployed substantially across the plain, and, preceded by a strong line of skirmishers, advanced cautiously toward the apex of the triangle, where the town itself is situated.

Shoving our horses over this, we became en thused with the excitement of the moment and broke into a gallop, until, suddenly, we rounded a curve and, jumping another breastwork, found our selves on the very outskirts of the town. It pre sented the appearance of being totally abandoned. The streets were torn up in several places, and great pipes were thrown across, as if hastily devised means of resistance had been attempted and abandoned.

This relationship, however, I am inclined to doubt, for I could discover in the national character no trace of affection whatever for a \"bit of a scrap.\" Immediately after our arrival we had to unload"], [317, "Baggage Detail to Coamo 199 the wagons, put up tents for General Miles's staff and get that portion of the enclosure assigned to us into proper military shape. Our duties after that were not onerous, though for a time one of them galled us sadly. This was work we had to do for the mule drivers. It would have amused, perhaps, some of our gentle society girls to have seen us slaving in the sun, perspiration running from every pore, while those lazy blackguards, the mule skinners, were ly ing in their hammocks in the shade, perhaps reading the only United States papers we had received in two weeks \u2014 one of them a big, burly negro, too. Three times a day we would scour the country for wood, which was very scarce and generally green when obtained, then by hard blowing and great persistence coax up a fire, haul water up the steep bank from the river, the muleteers the while look ing lazily on. When we had cooked the meal, from our own supply of rations too, then, and not till then, would these lazy gentlemen move and exert themselves only enough to get their share of the meal, retiring again to their hammocks to dispose of it and dreamily watch us clean up the cooking utensils. We fell back on the soldiers' prerogative and, by a well directed kick, threw the disgusted and disconsolate skinners back upon their own re- sources."], [318, "History of Troop \"A\" 200 The river just below our camp was very pictur esque and proved most attractive to the soldier boys. So much so that during the greater part of the day it was literally choked by a mass of laugh ing, chaffing, splashing, jolly fellows refreshing themselves or washing their clothes in the few inches of cool, clear water of the brook. The washing, moreover, of the whole town, as well as of the camp, was done here in a truly primitive style, and many were the pretty, little, naked native children that splashed in the pools while their mothers pounded the dirt out of the clothes on the stony bottom, with a delightful disregard for the future use of the arti cles being washed. We fared very well during our stay at Coamo, being treated with great courtesy by the officers with whom we came in contact. General Miles's own tent was turned over to us for our use until his ar rival, and all of his private commissary stores were put at our disposal, with permission to- take what ever we wished. Our work was very light, having little to do but attend to our own horses. These needed grass badly and we had to picket them out twice daily, with a detail on guard, as the field was only partially enclosed. One rainy afternoon, think ing nothing would be expected of us for the rest of the day, we were deep in the intricacies of an inter-"], [319, "Baggage Detail to Coamo 201 esting little game when, to our chagrin, we were ordered to turn out the horses. Excitement ran too high to stop just then, so we had recourse to the rather novel expedient of playing the rest of the afternoon on a poncho stretched upon the grass in the open field, only stopping now and again to round up some contrary horse. It was cold and wet, we were stiff and uncomfortable, the cards were sticky and damp, the horses were \"cussed\" and perverse, but such were the subtleties of \"the same old game\" that even under these adverse conditions it was far from devoid of interest and amusement. In addition to many other liberties and in spite of the very strict provost regulations, we were al lowed to ride about the country, the only require ment being that the squad should be in charge of the sergeant of the detail. Hearing of some famous baths, four or five miles off, we made up our minds to visit them. The bath-house, so called, was of pink stucco and resembled a large hotel, though dif fering very much in arrangement from any I have ever seen elsewhere. It was two stories high, each having its own piazza completely encircling the building. On to these piazzas opened all the bed rooms, the doors being of lattice, with air-spaces above and below, and through these were admitted the light as well as air, for there were no other win-"], [320, "History of Troop \"A\" 202 dows in the building A short hall, which was only a continuation of the piazza, ran through from front to rear, dividing the house in the middle; in these passages were placed the staircase, they apparently serving the additional duty of conventional public rooms, having rocking chairs, tables and horsehair sofas placed stiffly about. In the rear the view was most extended, the ground falling rapidly in steep terraces to a little river threading its way through a miniature canyon, while beyond this it rolled gently off to the great mountain-chain miles away. From the rear of the lower piazza we wrent along a covered brick runway, down, down, twisting and turning till I could not but recall \"Alice in Wonder land\" and her encounter with the white rabbit in the subterranean passage. Inside the bath, however, one received a shock, for the first room one entered, a sort of entresol, was of white and black marble with black bent-wood furniture, closely resembling the reception-room of a crematory, often euphoniously spoken of as \"a burial parlor.\" The bathrooms themselves, how ever, were more attractive, each room containing two huge marble tubs, set in the floor. The faucets were nearly two inches in diameter, and so arranged that one could let a stream of water fall from a con siderable height upon the body, thus obtaining a de-"], [321, "Baggage Detail to Coamo 203 lightful massage, most grateful and refreshing to our tired muscles. After the bath we repaired to the restaurant, and with keen appetites regaled ourselves sumptuous ly on the best of the land for seventy-five cents apiece. On August 17th, at 9:30 A. M., Captain Foltz, First United States Cavalry, directed the sergeant in command of the detail to report with two mount ed troopers in half an hour, to carry a flag of truce into the Spanish lines. There was great commotion when this order was reported to the detail, and im mediately there began a complicated system of matching, to decide who were to be the lucky troop ers. Lee and Hall were the fortunate ones. Captain Clayton, of Troop \"C,\" with a trumpeter, joined the party as we were starting out, bent apparently upon getting a view of the Spanish position. This party of six rode along the San Juan road some six miles to our outposts, passing several bridges which had been, more or less, demolished by the Spanish in their recent rapid retreat from Coamo. At our pickets, in order to avoid too large a party, Lee, Hall and the Troop \"C\" trumpeter were left behind, two captains and I advancing toward the Spanish lines, at a walk, under a flag of truce. Though the road to our outposts was very attrac-"], [322, "History of Troop \"A\" 204 tive, from this point about two and a half miles to the Spanish lines, it was simply superb. Smooth as a billiard-table, flanked on both sides with rows of locust-trees, gorgeous with their load of red blos soms, the military road gradually rose higher and higher as it twisted and turned and wound, in almost redundant folds around the beautiful hills. Through out almost the whole distance one could see the road miles ahead shining white against the green slopes and apparently gliding like some gigantic serpent across the country, disappearing beyond the great central mountain ridge just at the left of the Spanish position. These two miles and a half of road were in full view of the Spanish works, and a single file could hardly have covered the distance without being detected from the rifle pits. Though nearly three miles by road, it was scarcely three thousand yards as the crow flies. A well directed charge of dynamite could have made the road im passable, while an advance across country in such a contingency through the tangled underbrush would have been almost equally impossible. It was not, however, till we got to the Spanish outposts that we realized how strong their position was. Looking backward, almost every foot of the road for miles back was distinctly visible and, in fact, so was the greater part of its course, the whole"], [323, "Baggage Detail to Coamo 205 distance from Ponce; clear and blue we could see the sea in Ponce harbor and for miles up and down the coast; with a glass the number and character of ships in that harbor could also easily have been dis tinguished. In fact, if watchful, nothing of impor tance could have taken place between the Spanish position and the sea without their knowledge. Soon we were halted by a Spanish picket, who, immediately on challenging, took to his heels up the road to join a second sentry holding their two scrubby ponies. Both immediately mounted, one galloping on up the double S, appearing, disappear ing and reappearing again, each time a little higher up the mountain, ludicrously recalling to mind Sieg fried's climb on the operatic stage to free Brun hilde. Very soon down he came again on the gallop, joined his companion and both rode at full speed down upon us, pulling up short only a few feet away. With a most exaggerated show of friendship, they greeted and all but embraced Captains Foltz and Clayton, shaking hands with all the effusion and manner possible to the Latin race. They were dirty, insignificant, little rats, in filthy, white uniforms. They wore long white trousers, strapped under shoes which were of a cheap Bowery pattern of the Congress gaiter variety; the elastic sides were worn out, allowing the tugs and a part"], [324, "206 History of Troop \"A\" of the shoe to stick out fore and aft beyond wrinkled trousers, giving the soldier anything but a heroic and martial appearance. Their hats were the ordi nary panamas of straw with a red and yellow cockade on the side. They wore cross-belts of russet leather, one a carbine sling, hanging almost to the knee, and the other a support for the waist-belt, which held a row of little leather boxes closely packed with Mau ser clips and cartridges. Their chargers were of the starved, half-dead variety so much used and abused on the island; the saddles were of a mongrel English type, both they and the bridles being of the cheapest possible make. The carbines were in wretched con dition and covered with rust. They were swung to the saddles, the muzzles stuck in small leather sock ets, hanging low by the ponies' off elbow, while pommel straps were wrapped several times about the small of the stocks. This exposed the locks to dust and rain, and the sights to the danger of many knocks; with the further disadvantage that it would have taken nearly a minute to extricate the carbines from these clumsy contrivances. Machetes of Eng lish make completed this equipment \u2014 no, I forgot ! One had an old spur tied to his heel with a string. Shortly a little officer came galloping down to us. Unlike the men, he was personally clean and of very dignified manner, but, in common with them, his"], [325, "Baggage Detail to Coamo 207 pony showed no signs of ever having been groomed. After dignified salutations were exchanged, Captain Foltz explained to him that the firing which would be heard on that afternoon, would be salvos to General Miles, who was to visit our lines and out posts, and that the Spanish were not to interpret it as a breach of faith on our part and a violation of the truce. Then, with many graceful waves of the hand and profound bows, we withdrew, riding back to camp without further incident. Next day I again had the pleasure of meeting the same Spanish soldiers, and was amused at their method of approaching an enemy's outpost. The day before the two United States Captains had rid den in front; I followed, carrying a small stick (pulled from a sapling by the roadside), with Cap tain Foltz's silk handkerchief knotted to it. The Spaniards observed a different formality \u2014 one troop er rode some fifty yards ahead of their party of six, vigorously waving a huge white flag on a ten foot staff, the flag most closely resembling a cotton sheet. As they withdrew he fell in fifty yards in the rear, keeping his flag flying free by an occasional wave. Shortly after we reached camp General Miles rode in, followed by his escort, composed of the rest of our troop. We then immediately reported to Lieu tenant Coudert, and, as the troop had ridden so hard"], [326, "208 History of Troop \"A\" that their wagons were miles in the rear and it was well past noon, we volunteered to cook dinner for the whole troop. The way they enjoyed it amply repaid us for the additional work, events proving that they were ravenous after their hard ride. Thus ended a very pleasant little trip. Through out we were treated with the greatest consideration and kindness by the regular officers with whom we came in contact. This was carried to such a degree, and by men who knew nothing about any of us, nor perhaps ever expected to see us again, that it would have been an excellent object lesson to many volun teer officers in the service, who, being somewhat uncertain of their ability to command the respect of their men, considered boorishness and insolence necessary to make them appear the officer and the gentleman."], [327, ""], [328, "PACKING SADDLES FOR THE MARCH \u2014 CAMP ALGER."], [329, "A Little Journey in the World Harry J.

The abundant gray matter of our gallant band was sorely threatened with fatty degeneration while in the Isle of the Mango.

He was furthermore to take two hospital wagons of medicines and supplies to the headquar ters hospital, and to report fully on the situation and condition of affairs both there and along the route. The newspaper story that our detail in cluded an undertaker to investigate the condition of the meat is erroneous. The writer was assigned as armed orderly to the expedition and put in charge of the wagons, skin ners and mules. After receiving instructions to take the Major's horse as far as Yauco, whither he would journey by train, I corralled five days' ra tions from our bounteous commissary tent and rode proudly forth with my retinue, on Sergeant Em met's broken-down sorrel.

It was the work of a moment when, out of the town, to dump all my equipment into one of the wagons, gayly mount the Major's thoroughbred and allow Emmet's \"heirloom\" to shamble along un burdened and fancy free. That night we camped at the roadside, and around our modest bivouac one of the skinners \u2014 a dried-up old fellow, who"], [331, "A Little Journey in the World 211 would weigh about one hundred pounds \u2014 regaled us with stories of his prowess as a mule driver in the Civil War. He thoroughly convinced us that he could drive anything with four legs over any road that was passable for a mountain goat. We pulled into Yauco about noon the next day, where we hung around for the five o'clock train. About fifteen minutes before that time every man, woman and pickaninny in the town solemnly marched down to the station to witness the event of the day. The Major, with a vast amount of \"field equipment,\" and a body servant who answered to the name of Thomas, was quite the warmest thing on the train. The aforementioned Thomas had a command of both languages, but of the truth in neither. He might have held, with the advertis ing department of Pears' soap, that cleanliness is next to godliness, but if such was the case he was maturely advanced on the broad highway of the ungodly. That night we camped near the station, the Major occupying the top, and I the lower berth of one of the wagons, of which the cargo was safely stowed on the ground under rubber blankets. The drivers slept on top of the supplies in the other wagons, while the faithful Thomas reposed beneath our wagon. We turned in with the sky studded with"], [332, "History of Troop \"A\" 212 stars. The deluge came about midnight and I was aroused by the Major's inquiry : \"Thomas, is it damp down there?\" Upon learning that it was quite so. he modestly suggested that I share my quarters with the faithful henchman. Through lack of nerve or a tenderness of heart I acquiesced and spent the remainder of the night alongside of the dirtiest nigger the health officer ever winked at. Wall Street wasn't a circumstance to the trans ference of stock that occurred during those few hours, only my acquired wealth was purely live stock. Upon starting out the next morning, August 18th, in the steady downpour the Major relaxed dis cipline and made me a sort of travelling companion. Thus we jogged on ahead of the wagons, until it suddenly struck us that they had been out of sight for some time. What a doleful sight met our eyes as we retraced our steps to the first turn in the road! There was the hero of a hundred campaigns mournfully wring ing his hands on a slippery bank, while his mules were floundering in a ten foot ditch, and the wagon was helplessly reclining upside down.

After spending a day in regaling the inner man, for the most part at the French cafe, we set forth on the return trip, and it was with untold joy that I saw again the good old camp of Troop \"A\" cosily nestled among the barbed-wire fences on Sunday evening, August 22d."], [334, "Les Invalides John H.

It is hardly necessary to say that every ef fort was made to avoid this final catastrophe. First a day off duty or a luxurious (?) meal at one of the hotels in Ponce would be tried. Frank Huntington and I went together one day, both feeling particu larly wretched, on a quest for the latter description of relief. The Hotel Francais, the Delmonico's of Ponce, was crowded with its usual mob of unwashed officers, much-washed troopers, batterymen and motley war correspondents; so we determined to try our luck at the Inglaterra, a neighboring and rival hostelry that happened to be less popular with the \"Americanos\" at that time. We entered through a narrow passage connecting the street with what, in New York, would be the back yard, climbed a winding stone staircase brilliantly painted in blue and white after the native fashion, and found ourselves in a long bare dining-room. A group of men, apparently merchants, chatting volubly and, to our delight, in French, were the only occupants of this room. We seated ourselves at a table near them ;"], [338, "History of Troop \"A\" 216 a coffee-colored individual in a sad-looking apron poked his head through an adjacent doorway and surveyed us doubtfully; it evidently pierced his con sciousness after awhile that we were not \"caballe ros\" (gentlemen officers), but only enlisted men. Notwithstanding our stripes, he retreated in con temptuous silence. We were determined, however, to get what passes in Puerto Rico for a decent meal, and had no intention of allowing any such triviality as the snobbishness of a half-breed waiter to thwart our plans. As was the custom with many of us in the troop, we each had a few American gold pieces, which pass current anywhere in the world. When the waiter next protruded his woolly head, one of these caught his eye as it lay on the table cloth and he at once came toward us. Gold, and yet only \"serjentes !\" Stolen or not, he evidently decided that the gold was worth having and he promptly brought us a bill of fare. But now an other complication arose; he could not read and our Spanish, although limited in quantity, was of course too pure Castilian to be very comprehensible to any dialect-speaking native. For awhile it looked as if we had only the alternative of leaving the choice of what we should eat to him, or going without. But in this extremity our French-speaking neigh bors came to our rescue; a few words from them"], [339, ""], [340, "\" MADAME \" OF THE HOTEL FRANCAIS, PONCE"], [341, "Les Invalides 217 and our wants were in a fair way to be satisfied. We even secured a bottle of very fair champagne; so that the end made all well. Of course, I understood the waiter's hesitation at first \u2014 in fact, I sympa thized with him. When he first looked at us, Frank had not yet removed his hat. To men who have seen that hat, I feel I need say no more. After much suffering in camp, where the excel lent and self-sacrificing care the sick received at the hands of their comrades could not entirely compen sate for the lack of proper accommodation and food, a great change for the better took place, due to our discovery of the little hospital which Miss Chanler and Miss Bouligny had then just started in one of the side streets of Ponce. More dead than alive, I found myself at the Hotel Francais one evening with Harry Ward. Some what perplexed at my condition, the good Sergeant suggested that the ladies might be able to give me a shelter, and he promptly went to look for them, hearing that they were then dining in the hotel. In a few minutes he called to me to come into the cor ridor. I found him talking with a woman in the blue and white uniform of a trained nurse, with the Red Cross badge on her left arm and a half merry, half pitying, wholly capable and sympathetic ex pression on her face, that at once inspired a feeling"], [342, "218 History of Troop \"A\" of confidence and hope. That night for the first time in many months I enjoyed the luxury of a real bed, and the conviction that whether it were necessary for me to live or die I could now do either decently. Although intended only for officers, the little hospital stretched the mantle of its hospitality over such members of our troop, of the City Troop and of Battery \"A\" of Philadelphia, as were in seri ous need of nursing; and let me say here, in the name of the men of those different commands who profited by that generous hospitality, and who, per haps, in many instances owe their lives to it, that mere words cannot in anywise express our grati tude for, and our deep appreciation of, the con stant, tender care we received from those two noble women, when we were so ill in a hostile, half-bar barous country, far from those to whom we had a right to look for aid. Those alone who knew Ponce at the time of which I am writing will be able fully to understand what difficulties and dangers the only two American women in Puerto Rico had to face in the course of their errand of mercy. An incident occurred one day, when some patients were being transferred from the hospital to the hos pital-ship, which illustrates well Miss Chanler's cool headedness and force. All of the patients, but one, had been put in the ambulances, when the surgeon"], [343, "Les Invalides 219 in charge gave the order to start. Miss Chanler told him there was one more man to go. \" Can't help it,\" said the surgeon; \" can't wait.\" \" But, doctor, he must go,\" she said. \" He is all ready, has been dressed and given stimulants to help him stand the trip, and he must go.\" \" Can't wait,\" replied the surgeon again. (There was no earthly reason why he shouldn't wait.) \" He isn't here, and I can't wait.\" After a few more useless appeals, Miss Chanler turned to Sergeant Phelps, who was standing with her and the doctor, and said, in a voice which was distinctly audible to the latter, \" Sergeant, will you bring the man down, please; the doctor seems a trifle excited.\" The ambulance waited. The day after I was taken to the hospital, Rob Barclay and Chick Childs were brought there with varying degrees of fever and other ills at that time prevalent among us. The building that served as our shelter was an ordinary house, larger than the majority of its neighbors, single-storied and raised some feet from the ground on brick pillars; it was built of clapboards, painted a bluish gray, with white trimmings, and had a spacious yard or garden behind it in which convalescent patients could enjoy the fresh air. The interior was arranged as well as might be for hospital purposes. With some trouble"], [344, "History of Troop \"A\" 220 Miss Chanler had secured a number of cots, each with a mosquito-bar, and these were distributed through the three available rooms. In the \"ward\" with me there were a captain of artillery in the regu lar army and the medical officer of Battery \"A,\" ill respectively with sunstroke and typhoid fever. Chick and Rob had a room to themselves, into which, as the available space became more limited, I was afterwards transferred. No description of the hospital would be complete without some mention of its bogie or familiar imp. About twenty-five years old, of a light chocolate brown, tall, spare, and indescribably unneat in her negligee native costume, Saturnina was as uncanny a presiding genius as ever seconded the God of heal ing. Like many women of her race on the island, she had lost her two upper front teeth; the aperture thus formed she alternately used as the socket for her cigar or as a cleverly managed channel for ex pectoration. A dark skirt, a loose white shirt open at the throat, and a shawl of various colors around her shoulders, constituted her usual apparel. Her woolly hair was arranged in two stiff, hornlike ex crescences over either ear, and covered with a cloth or handkerchief secured by fancy pins, in guise of mantilla. This nightmare, bending over our cots with a steaming bowl of rice, gruel or milk, will sol-"], [345, "Les Invalides 221 low us for many a day through uneasy dreams. Yet Saturnina was kind of heart and would often tempt some ravenous convalescent, whom she liked, to stuff himself with forbidden food, against the strict orders of her mistress and to the subsequent despair of the unfortunate wretch himself. Her sense of the proprieties was entirely minus. Often did I curse my scanty knowledge of Spanish when Satur nina would come into our room and irrepressibly entertain us with remarks that would have made a Comanche blush. Not that there was any guile in her; her conversation was perpetrated with the ig norant carelessness of a two-year-old child; and all the lectures the ladies gave her on this head pro duced only blank non-understanding. Poor, black, hideous, kind-hearted Saturnina ! I trust she has prospered and has long since been able to afford a \"church marriage\" to that sneaky-eyed little \"hus band\" of whom she was, so proud.

Some of us she adorned with a regular Red Cross badge on the left arm, which"], [346, "History of Troop \"A\" 222 made a display against our yellow chevrons that we all agreed was unique, and it certainly served a prac tical purpose by securing us prompt attention when we had to execute various small commissions about the town, where the badge met with general respect. Soon after I was invested with these insignia, an incident happened that is perhaps worth recording. For some days previous there had been small riots in various parts of the town, caused by the native animosity against the Spanish residents who had re mained within our lines. Notwithstanding the strong military patrols that were stationed in every quarter, there had been some looting and violence. On the afternoon of which I write, Harold Barclay, our hospital steward, had come up from camp to see his brother. He was already suffering from the fever which later gave him so much trouble, and his face looked flushed and drawn as he stopped at the yard gate to speak to me before returning \"home.\" As we stood there chatting a great hubbub arose in the street outside. Hastily opening the gate we saw a throng of Puerto Ricans surging back and forth around the corner of a nearby thoroughfare. Afterwards we learned that they had broken into a neighboring store, the property of a Spaniard, and after sacking it, had fallen out over the division of their spoil. Loud yells and oaths came from the"], [347, "Les Invalides 223 maddened crowd as they struck at each other with machetes and long-naked branches of a species of palm that furnishes most efficient clubs. Apparent ly they had no firearms; at least they did not use them. \"Come on!\" cried Harold, and off he went on a run. I \"came on\" as fast as I could; being very weak, my course was somewhat erratic, and had anyone unacquainted with my condition followed up my tracks, he could have formed but a poor opinion of my sobriety. When I arrived on the actual scene of the conflict Harold was already shouldering his way through the mob, knocking the men out of his way with the ease of a bulldog walking over a litter of mongrel pups. The fighting ceased almost en tirely, as if by magic; some slunk away; others, as if from curiosity, stood shamefacedly watching to see what we would do. The two leaders of the opposing factions, however, too frenzied with rage to notice our approach, plied their blows with little skill but great determination, armed the one with a long knife, the other with a cudgel. Each was covered with blood, the loss of which seemed in nowise to have impaired his strength. Harold made straight for them. Perhaps it was the sight of the uniforms, perhaps it was the very \"cheek\" of our unarmed interference that cowed them. At"], [348, "History of Troop \"A\" 224 any rate, the moment Barclay's hand fell on the shoulder of the fellow with the club, the battle ceased. Both men dropped their weapons at our order, and we led them, unresisting, down the street toward the jail, while their comrades disappeared in all directions. Our little bluff had worked; a bluff it certainly was, however. We had hardly gone a block when we were overtaken by a corporal of one of the regular batteries, mounted and cantering along at a lively pace. Coming up with us and our blood-stained prisoners he reined in to inquire the trouble, and to him we turned over the men, he promising, with a twinkle in his eye as he drew his revolver, to deliver them, safely or the contrary, at the calaboose. \u2014 \"Move on, yez spalpeens !\" said he, and we went back to the hospital."], [349, ""], [350, "LIEUT.

Brooke's Division had started from"], [352, "226 History of Troop \"A\" Guayama to flank them on the east, the commands under Generals Schwan and Henry were to proceed from Adjuntas and Mayaguez against Areceibo, and General Miles was to start the next morning to join Wilson and there take command of the main attack; and we were going with him. The orders came late in the afternoon, and at sundown, as we lined up for a general inspection of arms and equipment, something unusual was in the air \u2014 we were going to the front. How well we all slept that night history may never tell, but the dreams of those who did sleep and the thoughts of those who didn't vanished alike in the morning air; shortly after \"boots and saddles,\" came the news that hostilities had ceased, and so our first and only chance of a fight dropped in its tracks. The next few days were the most disheartening of the whole campaign. What it all meant and how long it was to last nobody knew; for news from home, our only real source of information, came but seldom and told us little. Some letters, in deed, came with the sun, but they, I think, con tained more of love than war. Even rumors, gen erally so fertile, failed us now in our need. We only knew that things had come to an indefinite stand still, and we began to speculate whether we should hang our Christmas stockings on the Ponce palms."], [353, "With General Miles to Coamo 227 It was therefore welcome news when a few days after we again got word that General Miles would start in the morning for Coamo to visit the out posts there. It was a different proposition from the one of a week ago, but, under the present con ditions, quite attractive. We were only astonished when Lieutenant Coudert told the first sergeant that, in answer to his question as to how many men he would want, the General replied, \"As many as are able to stand the hardships of the march.\" But the General had a reputation for being death on cavalry, which, it was concluded, was the reason for this considerate precaution. We started the next morning about eight. It was a rather unique cavalcade to march to an ene my's outposts. A sergeant and three men were directed to ride ahead, apparently for the purpose of setting the pace, and perhaps with an idea of receiving the floral offering's and such other things as, judging from the past experience of our troops in Porto Rico, one of the General's exalted position might well expect would obstruct his pas sage. Following this advance guard came Mr. and Mrs. Van Rensselaer and Miss Fell, guests of the General, in a covered wagon drawn by two of the very best of army mules; then the General himself, in a very blue shirt and a very big hat, followed by"], [354, "History of Troop \"A\" 228 his staff, in many shades and varieties of khaki; and the Troop, in a column of fours, brought up the rear. l\u00bb As we rode through the town the natives came out to look at us and seemed much impressed, but as yet there were no bouquets. After crossing a ford on the outskirts of the town, where we struck the military road, an aide rode up and instructed the sergeant ahead that the General wanted to make time, so, when the road was good, to proceed at a good pace. The road was as good as any in Cen tral Park, so, excepting when we waded through the frequent fords, sometimes to our stirrups, the advance guard hit up so good a pace that before ten o'clock we arrived at Juana Dias, about eight miles from Ponce, and there made a halt. The road so far ran through the sugar fields and plantations that cover the stretch of lowland between the sea and the foothills of the mountains, which begin to rise about three miles from the coast. It is a pict uresque and most fertile part of the island, and a great source of its agricultural wealth. Like all Porto Rican towns, Juana Dias is built \"on the square,\" with a church at the head of it, two-storied houses about the other sides and a band stand in the middle.

On leaving Juana Dias the road, in a winding way, beautiful at every turn, rises into the hills, and you soon look down on the green sea of the cane fields fading away into the blue sea beyond. Still obe dient to orders, the sergeant ahead struck out again at a good pace, and the rest of the cavalcade for a time kept well up, but after a mile or two the Gen eral, seeming less anxious to make time, now and then dropped conspicuously to the rear, only the mules and covered wagon keeping in touch. About one o'clock we approached Coamo, where we were met by General Wilson and his staff, with an escort of Troop \"C.\" Compliments were ex changed and they then turned back to lead us into the town. It was triumphal in a sense, this ap proach of the commander of the conquering army into the conquered town \u2014 about a week late. It had an atmosphere of real war about it, and the sur roundings carried out the picture. Some three"], [356, "History of Troop \"A\" 230 miles this side of Coamo we passed over a tem porary structure put up in the place of a stone bridge which had been blown up a few days before and for some time had stopped the advance of our army, and as we rode into the town there were still the remains of trenches in the streets, and here and there the mark of a well directed shot. Wilson's headquarters were situated about half a mile the other side of the city and a few hundred yards beyond the camp of B, of the Fourth, and F. of the Third Artillery, which, as we passed, gave the Major-General's salute of thirteen guns that echoed uproariously through the hills and for a moment dis turbed the formation of the cavalcade and not a few military seats. Upon reaching the headquarters, situated very picturesquely in a little opening to the right of the highway, the troop was dismissed and directed to its camp, a few hundred yards beyond. During the afternoon we lay about the dog-tents when it didn't rain, and crept into them when it did, and enjoyed the surroundings. We realized we were really at the front.

One of the Pennsylvania boys who came to see us, and who was in the fight pointed out in a whisper the very spot where he or some one else had shot a Spanish officer, and he offered to show me the carcass of the officer's horse, but unfortunately when we went to look the horse was gone. Here also we heard from themselves the stories of Troop \"C's\" good work. One of them told us that in a fight in which he was, the bullets flew so thick that he could catch them in his hands! The wagons arrived before long, and after mess and evening stables we sat around the fire until nine o'clock, when we took the hint of a rather rusty \"taps\" (for Braith, having been left behind on account of a kick in the leg, the \"Baron\" and \"Vallie\" were taking turns at the horn) and were soon asleep.

The outposts were then about four miles beyond Coamo, in the hills; the white flags were plainly visible on every point, and with the aid of a glass you could distinguish the sentries at their posts. After stable and breakfast Lieutenant Cou dert and Dr. Leale, with four of us who were for tunate enough to be asked to go along, rode out to visit the outposts. After a three mile ride we came to our pickets, en camped alongside the road in shelter tents, which afforded little or no protection from the constant showers; they told us that they suffered greatly for food, being able to cook but very little on account of the rain. A little farther up the road we met a volunteer officer in a blue shirt, with his shoulder straps pinned on it. Seeming to be somewhat ex cited, he told us that two Spanish officers with a detail of soldiers were at our extreme outpost, about a hundred yards ahead, under a flag of truce, anx ious to. deliver a message; that an interpreter had been sent for, but had not arrived, and he asked if any of us spoke Spanish. The temptation was too strong for one of us, who very modestly asserted that he did, and the credulous officer then requested that we accompany him back to interview the Span iards.

They were all mounted on Porto Rican ponies not much bigger than Rocky Mountain goats, and their horse equip ment would not have paid for its weight in a junk shop. Their arms, however, were beyond criticism, for the Mauser is a good thing wherever you find it.

But, what ever it was, it apparently required an answer, and when none was forthcoming the Spaniards, awak ing to the fact that they had made a mistake, en gaged in a heated conversation among themselves, and then shut up like clams, and eyed us with an expression not at all encouraging.

They seemed disappointed that the negatives could not be developed immediately, and when we explained that it was not possible the captain very handsomely wrote on a leaf of his notebook his name and that of his lieutenant, and at the bottom a graceful request, and handed it to us.

It was a striking instance of what has been often reported during the war \u2014 the lack of animosity between the Spanish and Amer ican soldiers; for even after the fight at Santiago, they say, the men mixed together and traded souve nirs without the least sign of unfriendliness. From where we stood the Spaniards' position was easily seen. They were heavily intrenched on the highest of a range of hills across a valley about two thousand yards wide, every inch of which was cov ered by their guns, and from our present position, as had been demonstrated a few days before, when an attempt was made to dislodge them, we were at the mercy of their artillery and quick-firing pieces. Had the plan of attack as contemplated been car ried out it is difficult to say what the outcome would have been. During the afternoon we lazed about our camp, and those who wished to, got passes to ride around and see the sights of the place, the most important of which are the baths.

Soon after, when a number of horsemen arrived, and, making themselves very much at home, gave him to understand they had come to dine, he received them with great delight and respect, and so completely outdid himself in hospitality and good things to eat that they responded with a vim, and literally cleaned him out. When, an hour later, the General and his party arrived there was not an egg in the house. Whether the General appreciated this delicate attention of his body-guard of young gentlemen troopers in eating his dinner history does not tell. We returned to Ponce the next morning. Mrs. Van Rensselaer the day before, while riding through a ford, had met with an accident, which prevented her party's return with us.

The natives came running out of their huts to meet us, talking and gesticulating and pointing toward something in the hills about half a mile away, across the river to the left. We finally gathered that a body of Spaniards were in the hills and had been up there for two or three days, coming down occa sionally to water their horses and steal sheep and stock from the people around. Upon looking care fully we saw two white objects, which, with the glass, were unmistakably horsemen, in white uni forms and straw hats, coming down the trail on the side of the hill.

The trip to Coamo and one or two short rides braced us up for the time being, but on returning to the pasture at Ponce it did not take long for us all to fall back into the old restless spirit of con trolled discontent. Finally orders came for fifteen men to escort funds into the interior. We had not been paid since June, but there were"], [394, "256 History of Troop \"A\" large amounts of \"good will\" going to the natives, and I fancy Uncle Sam paid well and promptly for all damage, rental and just debts contracted with them. It was this that we were to see safely over the mountains. At retreat (August 22nd) the roster of the detail, headed by Sergeant Stowe Phelps, was read off, and we turned in shortly afterward, full of expectations for another move. About one o'clock in the morning I was awakened by a few scurrying footsteps and the flicker of a lan tern. Subdued voices in hurried conversation were soon entirely drowned by \"boots and saddles.\" I could not find out anything definite as to who was wanted, but there was a fire somewhere and a native riot which we were supposed to subdue. This was all very vague, and I was extremely sleepy, so, with the excuse of previous orders to satisfy my con science, I turned in once more to sleep out the re mainder of the night. Dawn came at last, with all the warmth and clear ness of the tropics, but there was only a small hand ful of men to answer roll call, most of our force hav ing left shortly after one, among them some of those just detailed for the trip to the interior. However, we had the required number and a few to leave be hind, so we filed out of our lot by half-past seven"], [395, "Detail to Utuado 257 A.M., the detail consisting of Sergeant Phelps, Ser geant E. M. Ward, Corporal Ruland, Farrier Muller and Privates Brown, Drake, Littell, Little, Lockett, McKinlay, Outerbridge, Troescher, Valentine and Wharton. Going a few blocks into town we were halted in front of the Hotel Francais and left to swelter, the approaching noonday sun beating down upon us as we were seated on the curbs of that narrow street, well protected from every breeze. It was eleven o'clock when the money was finally packed in two small boxes, loaded into an army wagon, and General Garretson and an aide, Lieu tenant Langhorne, of the First United States Cav alry, settled themselves in their carriage. We had soon left the alley-like streets of Ponce behind us, and took up a good trot on a fine broad macadamized road running directly north, and by a gradual ascent reached the first mountain range of the interior of Porto Rico. The good road did not continue far beyond the foot hills, and when fairly on the mountain side it became a mere trail, upward and tortuous. We had no shelter, and the sun was scorching. Our lunch was eaten in the saddle, and consisted of a sandwich, half warmed through, hav ing been carried in our saddle bags. Others had some chocolate, and a few cans of sardines were"], [396, "258 History of Troop \"A\" shared by the epicures. We were fortunate in being able to assuage our thirst at cool, crystal threads of water, which flowed from the rocks over a banana leaf for a spigot. By four o'clock we reached the first crest, from which we could see a plateau, like a great arena, in the centre of which was Ad juntas, and thither we descended. So far the road had been quite free from habita tions, but beyond the crest we came to scattered huts and small settlements, from which we received a curious and rather happy welcome. After a day in the sun and frequent showers, and a march of about twenty-two miles over the mountains, we de livered our charge to the store-room of Adjuntas at half-past five, and were glad to picket our horses alongside another detail from our troop, the Fre linghuysen Lancers and B Troop of the Second. Our camp was made on the gravel walks of a small public square filled with many flowering plants, and about which the poor town was built. Bacon and beans were served hot, and after that welcome re past few of us lingered longer than to smoke a cigar and take a cooling drink in one or other of two ho tels facing the square, before turning in, some under canvas, others on the porches of nearby buildings. The second day of our trip dawned very hot. The regulars and Lieutenant Frelinghuysen and Ser-"], [397, "Detail to Utuado 259 geant Cromwell, with their men, left us early, and our morning was spent counting over the money and hunting in the pawn-shops for souvenirs. Just as we were about to start for Utuado a telegram arrived ordering us back to Ponce at once to embark for home. This was joyful news, but nevertheless we did not want to give up our trip. Lieutenant Lang horne was told the situation, and so said he would \"order\" us to proceed with him, which took the responsibility off our hands. In the meantime the telegram had been sent ahead by messenger to Lieu tenant Frelinghuysen, and we shortly met him re turning. He suggested our immediate return, but Lieutenant Langhorne knew his part and replied that we were ordered to Utuado, and we went. Later General Guy Henry, and still later his as sistant adjutant-general, passed and inquired why we had not returned to Ponce; but they made no ob jection to our lieutenant's explanation, and we pro ceeded through the same sort of bold country as we had come through the day before. Early in the afternoon we were led off the main road to Senor Rivera's coffee \"hacienda.\" The house was a large wooden building, with cool verandas commanding an extensive panoramic view. Not only the entire menage, but the members of the family, set to work and served us coffee, cocoanuts and cake. We"], [398, "260 History of Troop \"A\" helped ourselves to most delicious oranges from the trees about the place, and while having a quiet smoke in easy-chairs Stowe Phelps and Senorita Carmencita enlivened our spirits by playing duets on a splendid tin-panny upright. Really, Stowe made quite an impression, not to speak of sundry pretty speeches translated into Spanish by means of his phrase book. The time was short and we made a start, but the ubiquitous camera fiend in the person of Irving Ruland held us up. I must confess the Senorita's blushes, when Stowe insisted on her standing beside him in the foreground, were well worth the delay. It was four o'clock when we rode through the outskirts of Utuado in as hard a tropical rain as we had yet seen, and crowded for shelter under the shed of one of the many abandoned sugar mills alongside the General's headquarters. The shower over, we looked about for a camping-ground, and finally de cided to go into town and join Captain Hoppin's troop. Our horses were tethered a mile out of the town, and we settled ourselves on the bare floor of an empty storehouse, which had been put at our dis posal by the owner. The regulars had their horses on a line in the court-yard of a large stone edifice, in which they were quartered, and which was also used"], [399, "Detail to Utuado 261 as a guard-house. Finding ourselves in good com pany, we posted a strong guard (?) and searched the town. The buildings were very pretentious, and the in habitants quite prosperous. The Cathedral was the finest we had yet seen, and was raised ten or fifteen steps above a large open park, laid out in extensive flower gardens. Most of us came to an early conclusion that the conditions were not quite identical with sight-seeing during a summer's vacation in Europe, and, after a hearty meal in the swell hotel we spent a short and quiet evening. Lieutenant Langhorne honored us with a call, and a small crowd, accompanied by Cap tain Hoppin's interpreter, a Cuban refugee, called on the swells of the town. The parlor doors opened directly on to the sidewalk, and into one we walked, drew out our phrase books, said \"Buenos tardes,\" and made ourselves comfortable. There were the father, mother and two daughters, and they seemed pleased to have such distinguished visitors. At all events, the youngest daughter, a really charming muchacha, sang to her own accom paniment on her guitar, until we felt the idea of an early start next morning resting upon our eyelids. We left the slaughter-house, bedecked with souve nirs, the next morning at seven. The cool, clear"], [400, "262 History of Troop \"A\" atmosphere of that high altitude had braced us, and our horses were game for the hardest ride they had yet been over. At the outskirts of the city we passed a cemetery on our left enclosed by a stone wall, which was completely loopholed, and on our right was a steep spur some fifty feet high. The cemetery had been converted into a fort, and the spur was mounted with a couple of Spanish guns, so as to completely cover an iron bridge and all roads from the north, west and south leading into Utuado. This was the last sight we had to remind us of the war, and from here our road was to retrace our steps of the past few days. Up one mountain, down into the arena of Adjuntas, up and out on the other side and the long road down to Ponce. That day's ride was not far from forty miles, and we covered it in ten hours' riding, arriving in our old field at six o'clock."], [401, ""], [402, "A PORTO RICAN FUNERAL THE REMAINS OF A SPANISH RESIDENCE AFTER THE FIRE AT COTO"], [403, "Detail to Coto John D.

In a few words, a detail means a small body of men under a lieutenant or a non-commissioned officer, picked either because of fitness for the particular work or because of being next in rotation on the roster, for some detached duty out of the regular routine of camp. We had been camping near that dream of a semi tropical city, Ponce, for a long, long time. We had"], [404, "264 History of Troop \"A\" heard of the signing of the Peace Protocol and were silently awaiting the orders for home. At parade on the evening of August 23rd we were told that three details were to be sent out on the following day. One of these was under command of Sergeant Cammann and was made up of the fol lowing men: Corporal Huntington, Privates Hill, Hildreth, Homer, Holt, Hoeninghaus, Knudsen, Lannon, Ledyard, Mills and Stevens. This was welcome news to the men, as camp rou tine had gotten wearisome, and something was needed to drag them from the lethargy that comes of idleness. The orders were for an early start in the morn ing. In such cases your wise trooper makes all his preparations the evening before \u2014 getting his stuff in readiness, packing loose articles and stowing away what grub can be found or stolen for that rainy day which is always imminent in the army.

Incidentally they didn't seem to be enjoying it particularly. Here we were halted and ordered to wait \u2014 wait ing takes up the greater part of one's time in the army. We waited for orders to take the field; we waited for a long time at Camp Black for orders to leave; we waited for orders at Camp Alger, and we waited for orders to go to the front; we waited for the train at Dunn Loring, and for the transport at Newport News. To add to our misery we ran aground outside of Ponce, and waited to be pulled off. Then we grew sick waiting at Ponce for the orders to- the front which never came, and when we heard that the Protocol was signed we commenced the hardest wait of all \u2014 the long wait for orders for home. It's good discipline, but hard to acquire as a habit. The orders were to- go under command of Captain Latrobe, of General Wilson's staff, to Coto, a small town about five miles from Ponce. This town had been burned by some renegades, either Spanish or"], [406, "266 History of Troop \"A\" native, out of pure maliciousness, or to bring the Americans into bad repute. We had passed it a few days before on one of our marches; it was a pretty little place, and seemed from the road to be quite the cleanest village we had seen on the island. Our further instructions were to discover, if pos sible, the incendiaries and arrest them, and to pub lish through the different plantations a proclama tion regarding the protection of property by the United States forces, and stating that the people would be held responsible for the maintenance of order. After receiving instructions we started, taking up again our march over the military road. The scenery along this road is beautiful. Now and then the sea can be seen two or three miles away to the right, and far out a huge rock, which rises majestically from the ocean like a grim sentinel. The peculiar charm of the tropics lies in its con trasts; everything runs to violent colors \u2014 nature and man \u2014 and everything is more accentuated than in other regions. Through such country we rode for six miles be fore we reached Coto. We camped in the yard of one of the burned buildings, an admirable camping place, or at least a very comfortable one, and we were not particularly fastidious at that stage of the game."], [407, "Detail to Coto 267 The burned building was immediately on the road, while in the yard behind it there were the remains of what had been a fountain, very well built, and behind this at some little distance was an old tum ble down shed which had been used as a stable, not lately, I am very glad to say. Some troughs ran along the rear of this shed and, as we afterward found out, made, when half filled with hay, excellent beds, much better than the ground. We brought the mule team into the yard, put up our conical tent near the fountain, stretched a picket line, made a fire and camp was ready. Behind the shed there was a large field, which we used as a grazing ground for our horses.

He then gave orders to assemble the people. This was done by ringing a huge bell or gong, and they came trooping in from the fields. When they were assembled, the major domo him self read the proclamation, and we could gather from the expressions of their faces that it was as un usual as it was pleasant to hear that they \u2014 the sov ereign people \u2014 would \"be held responsible for the preservation of order.\" The people on these plantations live most simply. Their food, consisting chiefly of bananas, cocoanuts and other fruits, comes from the untilled earth.

The few neces saries used which are not raised on the island are bought at the store at the refinery, run by the owner of the plantation, where he probably gets back all the money paid out in wages. We stayed at this plantation for a short time only, and incidentally had the pleasure of declining a drink of rum, which is the chief intoxicant of the island. That afternoon we witnessed a native funeral. Four men were carrying on their shoulders what seemed like a stretcher, and on this a small coffin, with a few wild flowers on top. The men evidently"], [412, "History of Troop \"A\" 270 were dressed in their best clothes and came down the road chatting and laughing away and all but roy stering as they carried their friend to his last resting place. Later on we raced the little native ponies, to the great delight of the islanders, though one had to hold one's feet up to keep them from hitting the ground. These ponies, though small, are remark able for their endurance. Their usual gait is what is known in \"Ole Kentucky\" as a \"rack,\" or \"single foot.\" The motion is exactly like that of a rocking chair, and to see a big Dago sitting calmly smoking a cigar on one of these rats is rather a ludicrous sight. That evening we had our mess at the usual hour, but it was not the usual mess. Our new chefs, Knudsen and Hoeninghaus, covered themselves with glory, and gave us the best meal we had on the island, not even excepting those of Madame of the Hotel Francais in Ponce. Bacon that before had been unpalatable, beans that no one would eat, became under their magic touch the most tempting and delicious of morsels, and when they had used up the army rations they went out into the highways and byways and procured delicacies of which we had never heard. They turned that sturdy article of diet \u2014 the hardtack \u2014 into a most palatable dainty by"], [413, "Detail to Coto 271 frying it in bacon grease and serving it under the regular army name. Just before mess Corporal Huntington, who had been through the different plantations reading the proclamation, returned. He had had some curious experiences, but none more unique than that at a plantation where no one could be found who could read except a small child of ten or eleven years. The big bell rang out the summons calling the people to gether, who came to hear from the lips of this child of ten or eleven, the words of the representative of the greatest nation in the world; and two dusty, tired troopers looked on, while the mother of the in fant prodigy fairly glowed with delight. After evening mess we sat around smoking and chatting, and just after night had fallen \u2014 there is no twilight in Puerto Rico \u2014 we were suddenly startled by firing, down the road; it seemed about half a mile away. We began to wonder if we were going to have a scrap, or if this was another of the many false alarms that we had been following for two months in the hope of a fight. Two of the men in their excitement jumped for their saddles and commenced saddling up, but the sergeant in command promptly called them down, inquiring in a very mild way if any orders had been given. He then took one of the men and went off down the road to find out the"], [414, "History of Troop \"A\" 272 trouble. Diligent inquiry among the natives elic ited no information, but by and by a man came along on horseback from that direction and said it was only a drunken wagon driver, shooting his pistol for fun. We turned in soon afterward, some in the tent and others in the trough. To do guard duty on such a night was a pleasure. The full moon shedding its light on the mountains behind us, the burned village at our feet, the horses picketed, and the men sleep ing made a very pretty picture, and in the silence of the night an impressive one. Too soon for the tired men the day came. A few more plantations were visited, and that part of our work was done. As to the first part of it, the dis covery of the incendiaries, nothing could be found out about them, and, judging from the stories of the people who were interviewed, the entire population of Coto, men, women and children, had spent the night of the fire away from home, mostly at Ponce. Captain Latrobe came back about ten o'clock and, after hearing the report of the sergeant, ordered us to go back to our main camp at our convenience during the day. The little natives were most interesting. They would talk to us in Spanish and in the few words of English they had picked up, and seemed to enjoy themselves immensely. One bright-eyed little fel-"], [415, "Detail to Coto 273 low in particular was interested in everything; he would sing out \"Viva Americanos!\" and then he acted a little farce by ridiculous comparison of the Spanish and American soldiers. \"Soldado Espanol,\" raising his hands about five feet three inches to show the height of the Spanish soldier. \"Soldado Amer icano,\" measuring as high as he could and puffing out his chest. \"Soldado Espanol mucho malo\" (no good), with a contemptuous shrug of his shoulders. \"Soldados Americanos mucho bueno (very fine). Soldados Americanos bing! bing! (the sound of a gun) ; Solda Espanoles fueran,\" and then he would make gestures to imitate Spanish soldiers running away as hard as they could. In many ways these urchins showed their con tempt for the Spaniards, but the thought kept recurring that perhaps they would make as much fun of the Americans to the Spaniards if the morrow had brought a Spanish detail to the burned town. They have probably changed by now, having learned the ways of the Americans, but the ways of the half-breed Puerto Rican natives will take a good deal of improving before they become model citizens of the United States.

However, all was settled the next morning, when we rode out of camp bristling with cartridges after the most approved form of bristle, and proceeded to General Wilson's headquarters, where our leaders left us to give that eminent officer the benefit of their opinions on war as such, while we smaller fry lined up and had our photographs taken in various artistic positions, according to the latest army methods, thereby showing that same thoughtful consideration for the girls we left behind us that, judging from the number of photographs taken un der similar circumstances now in existence, has char acterized the American volunteer throughout the whole of the late unpleasantness.

Proceeding by the military road over which we had recently chased General Miles's elusive figure for so many weary leagues, we came to the burned village of Coto, where we picked out those whose blood was most sluggish and least inclined to fero cious deeds, that the sight of its blackened walls might stir up and keep alive the necessary fire in their breasts.

We then took up the march again in the most cheerful frame of mind, it being announced that Santa Isabel was again to figure in history, and all of us cherishing pleasant memories of the pretty little village, with its flowery plaza, unfinished cathedral and hospitable Mayor and townspeople.

This polite language seemed to please the readers so much that they always pressed us to step in and dine, whether from hospitality or a desire to sandbag us we cannot say.

After supper the Alcalde and his interpreter vis ited our camp to give us a more impressive wel come than the hasty one accorded us on our arrival and to talk with our leader as to the reasons and purposes of our visit. He found the military dis trict of Santa Isabel in full working order, with Ser geant Moen as Military Governor, Corporal Wright as his Secretary of War (with particular instruc tions to protect Arthur Goadby and Crombie from the wiles of the fair muchachas to the best of his ability), and Sherman Hall in the onerous position of Commissary General, with Coyne and Benjamin as assistants. About this time Corporal Erving was taken ill, slung his hammock under the bell-tower and re tired to it for the balance of our stay, to his own great discomfort, but to the eternal admiration of the natives, who gazed open-mouthed upon his ma jestic reclining figure. He still contributed greatly to our comfort, since he allowed no choir-boy to"], [424, "280 History of Troop \"A\" climb the tower and ring the bell for vespers or any other service unless they previously promised to cut it short. At nightfall we established what we have since discovered from the \"Manual of Guard Duty\" was a running guard, but which in our ignorance at that time we hailed as a striking manifestation of genius on the part of Ren Moen, and the corporal of the guard having instructed his men how to challenge in the Spanish language any unexpected and im probable sight, from a guerilla to a trolley-car, we all retired to rest, or, rather, to the duty of giving the mosquitoes their daily nourishment, which takes the place of rest in Puerto Rico.

She also expressed her self as much taken by Ross Bayne's beard, Louis Gillespie's whiskers and Harry Batcheller's tout en semble, but it was evident that she considered Ren as head and shoulders above all.

Sergeant Moen had been making inquiries as to where he could pur chase a handsome machete as a souvenir of his war experiences, and about dusk the Alcalde waited upon us again, accompanied by a friend and the usual joyous villagers. After a long and flowery oration he produced a machete, which he handed to our gallant commander with a profound bow.

Indeed the work about the commissary was no joke. The nearest spring was more than one hun dred yards distant and, as may be imagined, we had at all times a tropical thirst.

It came through well enough for the first day, but after that the fil ters were so clogged that, except when the watchful eye of the inspecting officer was upon us, we poured the water direct from the boilers into these re ceptacles and doubtless many times the water did not go through even the purifying process of boiling. There was also a large water-barrel supposed to be reserved for water for cooking purposes, but many a time some thoughtless trooper would take advantage of its abundant supply to perform his per sonal ablutions and clean up such crockery and tableware as he had managed to retain from the marauders. We arrived at Puerto Rico with a superabundant supply of army rations of all sorts, but our experi ence of the transports and of the first few days before we had formed permanent camp, had made us all pretty thoroughly tired of a rotation of pork and beans, corned beef and hardtack, so it seemed a for tunate day when the commanding officer authorized the Commissary Department to draw upon the troop fund for the purpose of such supplies and lux uries as the native markets afforded. There was about $1,500 in the fund at this time and some $500 from the weekly assessment on the members of the"], [436, "History of Troop \"A\" 290 troop, so we started in with high hopes of an ample bill of fare. It was now part of the regular procedure for the Commissary Sergeant, two of the regular detail and one or more of the natives to take Howard's mule team and drive to the market in Ponce at an hour early enough to get in ahead of the other Commis saries, to say nothing of the tropical sun. This was one of the times when the Sergeant and Howard had an easy thing, for they sat on the high spring seat while all the rest tried by all expedients to keep themselves from shaking to pieces. Howard had one fast drawing mule which could beat anything on the road and used to incite her companion to his best efforts, and we banged along the stony streets at a great pace until we reached the market. There we were greeted by the comely and smiling black face of Floretta, a subject of her Britannic Majesty from St. Thomas, who gave us invaluable assistance and be came a most important auxiliary of the staff. Loading the native with three large empty bas kets we proceeded to inspect what the market af forded, but a sad disappointment awaited us.

So far as the writer knows, none of the American beef which was issued to us from the time we started until our return, whether canned or fresh, was in any way improper for use as food, except in some cases where, by our own negligence, cans had been left in the sun and their contents naturally ruined. The fresh beef which we had on the transport going back, which was issued roasted, was excellent, and considering the fact that it had been kept in cold storage for some three months before we used it, was remark ably good. To return to the muttons, we never saw a Puerto Rican sheep on the hoof, but in the market there were certain small joints of animals which Floretta assured us to be legs of mutton. When our jaws were weary with the stringiness of the so-called beef, we tried these for a change, but there was about as much sustenance in them as in a halter, while much unkind criticism has been uttered about the Com missary's attempt to enliven the monotony of boiled rice by the addition of certain articles which Floretta assured us were kidneys and liver."], [438, "History 01 Troop \"A\" 292 Of fish, the market had an abundant supply \u2014 fish to look at, that is, not to eat, for we had to buy some six hundred of the small red snappers to have enough for a meal for fifty men; and it was seldom indeed that a ten pound fish was to be seen.

Fortunately, eggs were abundant, and it is equally fortunate that we had the troop fund behind us to buy them with, for to feed one hundred men with bantam's eggs at four cents apiece so drained the treasury that the Commissary, in an evil hour, de vised the expedient of instituting Spanish scrambled eggs for breakfast.

Then we were given explicit orders that anyone who does not care for tomatoes need not eat eggs, and there will be enough breakfast for those who like the combination.

For vegetables, in addition to such of the Gov ernment potatoes as had not been spoiled by being first soaked in sea-water and then left in the hot sun for a few days, we had an abundance of yams, plantains, bananas and squash. There was an un failing supply of excellent rice, and occasionally the favored ones would be presented by Floretta and her friends, with pineapples and even oranges, which were as much better than those we eat here, as an apple stolen from an orchard is better than one served at dessert. Having filled the baskets and loaded the natives with such of these delicacies as the daily allowance of $30 enabled us to buy, we started on our home ward journey, usually favored with Floretta's com pany. The market itself was perhaps the most pict uresque of all the sights in Ponce. Its long stucco walls, pierced with arches; its roof of red tiles, the open courtyards in the middle and the wide brick pavements surrounding it, crowded with natives of all shades of color, from the full-blooded negroes of St. Thomas to the Spanish natives from the interior;"], [442, "History of Troop \"A\" 294 the picturesque variety of costumes and lack of costume, the black bare-legged women smoking their cheroots, the cackling fowls, the shouts of chil dren, with here and there the immaculate duck of some native officer, made a sight long to be re membered. On our way back our first duty was to gather in the loaves. We stopped at the bakery of the Three B's, whose proprietor combined the business of baker, wood merchant and chandler. Here we had a contract for two hundred rolls a day, and very good they were. Next we proceeded to the ice man, and all the tales we had heard of the cupidity of the New York iceman were quite put in the shade by his brother in Puerto Rico. The ice was $2.00 a hundred pounds, and the hundred pounds had less cooling capacity than would half that weight of good American ice. Still we had to have it, and any price would have been cheap for the relief it gave us and the comfort it was for those in the hospital. The great trouble in that portion of the tropics with which we had experience, was not that it was very hot, but that there never was anything, day in and day out, to brace one up and make one more able to bear the vagaries of the climate. It was hot in the sun and warm in the shade; it was warm at night. The water of the streams was warm, that"], [443, "Commissary Department Experiences 295 of the ocean was even warmer, the ground was warm, and ice was the only refuge from this uni versal tepidity. One day news reached us that the Commissary had opened a store at La Playa where we could buy American groceries at cost. Needless to say the swiftest team was called out and with the full Com missary detail we proceeded to take whatever we could lay our hands upon. At the Port we found in one of the large warehouses a corner set apart as a grocery store and here we could get everything in the way of canned goods that could be thought of. The first day we thought of many things and the next day we wished that we had thought of more, for orders came that what remained should be re served for officers of the various commands. On the arrival, however, of another transport a more abundant supply was forthcoming, and before we left we were able to lay in a large supply of the best Franco-American soups and all sorts of pre served and dried fruits, crackers, sardines, coffee and tea. Thanks are due to the Captain and Com missary in charge of this store, who, with unfailing courtesy and good-nature, acted as grocery clerk for us, opened boxes, weighed out supplies and chalked up our account. When the final orders to sail had arrived, the"], [444, "296 History of Troop \"A\" commanding officer intimated to the Commissary that no objections would be raised if we laid in an abundant supply of food, drinks and ice for our com fort on the transport. On going over to our stock we found some eighty boxes of hardtack, countless cans of tomatoes and beef, sacks of coffee and of sugar, all of the Government rations which we had not consumed, so we made a deal with one of the native marketmen and he gave us some $300 for the lot. With this money and a large part of what remained of the troop fund we bought out the native grocer and exhausted what little remained at the Commissary's store, while we placed our orders at the two ice factories for their whole output for the next three days. The next problem was to load all these supplies on the transport without loss by fire, perils of the sea, or the public enemy. By way of opening up preliminary negotiations the Commissary and the alien prisoner paid a long and satisfactory visit one evening to the officers of the ship. We were re ceived with great hospitality and the best of English and Scotch liquors were placed at our disposal. The steward extended the hospitalities of the cold stor age room for the safe keeping of our supplies, and we finally decided that we would bring them aboard at night and stow them there. So the next morn-"], [445, "Commissary Department Experiences 297 ing we had the day's output from one ice factory, amounting to some seven hundred pounds, put up in barrels with sawdust, obtained three or four hun dred pounds from the other, and, starting off in the evening, loaded the wagon with these and as many of the supplies as we had room for. We made our way to the Playa and hired a lighter, with two boat men. At this point Howard's former training as roustabout on a Mississippi steamer came in. He handled the five hundred pound barrels of ice with more ease than the rest of us handled the boxes, and our united efforts soon had all the stuff on the lighter. The natives then poled us out and in the course of time we came up alongside the \"Missis sippi.\" Steam was up and we soon had the barrels swinging in the air and lowered into the hold, and then rolled over to the aft starboard section of the cold storage room. This operation was repeated nightly until the last day, when we came down to the Playa with an unusually large load, the last of the supplies increased by the addition of several hundred bottles of beer, ginger-ale and wine of the country, not to mention several cages of Porto Rican canaries given us by Floretta as a parting token of her es teem. We called to our boatmen to bring us a light er and they started to obey when we were met with an order purporting to come from the commanding"], [446, "History of Troop \"A\" 298 General to the effect that no lighters should be used by anyone until the General's transport had been completely loaded. Looking about us we saw some forty lighters waiting about and no attempt being made to use any of them. So we all retired into the shade and held a council of war. We decided to \"lay low\" until about dusk and then see what could be done. So we repaired to the Hotel de la Playa and had the usual Porto Rican dinner, with fried fish as an introduction to dessert. This feast con cluded, we hailed our lightermen, brought the wagon down, loaded the lighter, took a rowboat as well, and started off, expecting each moment a peremp tory order to return. We took care, however, not to listen and not to. look toward headquarters, so finally we reached the ship and began unloading, when, to our consternation, we saw a rowboat pull ing out from the shore full of the General's Quar termasters. Although they boarded the ship they, however, did not ask any embarrassing questions, and when our load was well aboard, after visiting the ship's officers and sending back the lightermen, we took occasion to make ourselves as inconspicuous as possible and rowed off to the hospital ship \"Re lief\" where we were welcomed by Dr. Howland, and saw a number of the boys whom we had managed to place where they would be best looked after.

Once under way on the transport the Commis saries of the three commands forward, Battery \"A,\" the City Troop of Philadelphia, and our troop selected three places on the deck to set up their respective Commissary quarters and drew lots for them. We drew the forward port section and soon had an improvised lunch-counter and bar combined, which the ingenuity and thought of the alien de corated with a picture and appropriate mottoes. Finding that we had more ice, more tomatoes and less condensed milk than we needed, we agreed with Battery \"A\" and the City Troop to divide the ice up equally and to supply our deficiencies by trading our surplus supplies. This arrangement worked beauti fully for the first two days. We had an abundance of ice \u2014 enough to keep the various drinks as cold throughout the day as they were when we brought them up from the storage in the morning. Every day before reveille the various Commissaries, each with a detail, repaired to the aft hatchway, went down to the cold storage room with the steward and brought up such supplies as it was expected would be needed for the day. These supplies were all hoisted up by one of the donkey engines, and we"], [448, "History of Troop \"A\" 300 became quite expert in making the barrels dodge the various beams and stanchions which they encoun tered on the way up. After being landed on deck all the supplies had to be carried by hand forward to the upper deck and the whole detail earned their title to a hearty breakfast. By arrangement with the steward, we were able to have every morning not only hot coffee but a large boiler full of hominy, and this we helped out with canned fruit, bacon, hard tack and condensed milk. For dinner we had an ample issue of roast beef, cooked during the night, with potatoes or rice, some cans of Franco-American soup and guava jelly and cheese, by way of dessert. The bar was opened at eleven A. M. and con tinued open until as long after taps as possible, and not the least valuable part of our education was that gained in presiding there in the long afternoons. On the third day out the entire supply of ice on the transport, the great bulk of which belonged to us and had been purchased from the troop fund, was taken possession of by the Major commanding, and, by his orders, from that time on ice was issued every morning in seven equal portions, one for each of the commands aboard, the two troops of Pennsylvania cavalry, Troop \"C,\" of Brooklyn, Battery \"A,\" the City Troop, and for the officers and our troop.

In the cases of Lieutenant Coudert, Goadby and Gran nis it actually developed before we reached shore. Life at sea is monotonous at the best of times, and in our case it proved no exception.

When the quota to be furnished by the several States on the first call for volunteers were announced, great was our surprise to see that New York hadn't been called on for a cavalry brigade, nor a regiment. The Government didn't even want all the officers and men of the State's mounted forces who had been settling their business and saying good-by to their best girls.

The proximity of the camp to the National Capital, whence all military and other official blessings flow, contributed greatly to this result. Many of the troopers knew Senators and other persons in authority and having influence, who put ideas into their heads. The relatives of many men secured commissions for them and brought the strongest kind of pressure to make them accept. There were lots of officers at Camp Al ger, as at Camp Black, whom the men knew; some of whom they liked and some they didn't. Certain of the former used to come over and see us sometimes. They probably worked as many hours a day as we did, or more, but somebody else kept their clothes in order for them, and they didn't show it the same way. As regards those in the latter category, when one has been accustomed to regard a man as an inferior the reflection that the positions are reversed by the strongest kind of sanction is not a soothing one. Then there was the daily growing belief that the troop was never going to get any nearer that mysterious and ill-located region known in the debates of the \"War Club\" as \"THE FRONT\"; that we weren't needed there, and that some malign influence was working on the President to keep us at home.

Often \"Breck\" has been seen standing in front of the old Custom House at the Playa, about which the military world of Puerto Rico revolved in those days2 while superiors raved and subordinates pleaded.

He returned to the United States with General Wilson in September, and was honorably discharged November 30th, 1898. Sergeant Charles Edward Pellew, our highly esteemed acting commissary sergeant, was the next man to get in the way of a commission. We learned on the way down to Dunn Loring that we were to lose him, and the news didn't tend especially to enliven a journey that was dreary enough from other causes. Pellew was commissioned First Lieu tenant in the United States Volunteer Signal Corps, and was ordered to Tampa, but did not have the for tune to get off on either the Santiago or Puerto Rico expedition. He was finally ordered to Santiago in the early part of August, and was the only man on board of the transport (the \"Port Victor\") who set foot on Cuban soil. His stay there was short, General Shafter himself, with the genial suavity which that officer's name invariably suggests, recommending"], [482, "History of Troop \"A\" 322 him to leave the island.

As for Polk, the crowned heads at Washington naturally fell all over themselves to do him honor, and two prominent Senators secured him a cap taincy and fired it at him before he knew what was going on \u2014 he said so himself.

Reporting at Tampa on June 19th, he accompanied his chief to Cuba, sailing on the transport \"Comanche\" July 3rd, and landing at Daiquiri the 1 6th. He remained in camp near Santiago until General Randolph's departure for Montauk, which took place August 17th; and, after a week's stay at Camp Wikoff was granted leave, which continued until his final discharge from the service, December 8th. McKee was present during the most trying time of the Fifth Army Corps' occupation, when over half of that command was constantly on sick report, and sometimes eighty per cent, of the remainder ought to have been, and there is no doubt that he bore himself nobly through those dark times, when fever held undisputed sway over our forces, with no excitement of conflict to keep up men's hearts. But he is too modest to tell of it, and there was no one else there to chronicle his deeds. It is evident, however, that he quickly acquired the ways of the military profession. One of the other men, who happened to board the \"Comanche\" only two days after Dunn had left it, inquired about him of the Adjutant of the battalion to which General Ran dolph's brigade had suddenly become reduced by"], [486, "History of Troop \"A\" 324 the landing of headquarters and two batteries. This officer immediately broke out into a flow of language in which wrath and admiration were strangely blended; it transpiring that Lieutenant McKee, having drawn no tent of his own, and hav ing a commendable disinclination to being left shel terless in the somewhat moist climate of Cuba, had appropriated the Adjutant's when he went up to the lines. It was conceded on all sides that the young volunteer officer was certainly learning the game. Polk was commissioned Captain and Assistant Quartermaster of Volunteers, and assigned in due course to the First Brigade, First Division, First Army Corps, commanded by Brigadier-General Oswald H. Ernst. He joined at Camp Thomas, Chickamauga, and accompanied General Ernst to Puerto Rico, landing at Ponce and participating in the engagements about Coamo. Polk was rated as a most efficient man in his department, and his charitable disposition was never more clearly manifested than in breaking camp at Ponce, when he generously abandoned most of his forage in favor of those who were more in need of that very scarce commodity \u2014 none could have needed it worse than the outfit that succeeded to it, at any rate. His method of loading his wagons on the"], [487, "Commissions 325 same occasion, with the tent-poles and other heavy articles on top, also won expressions of wonder from observing bystanders, several regular officers of long service on the plains remarking that they had never in all their experience even thought of loading wagons that way. Captain Polk returned to the United States when his chief did, and subsequently tendered his resignation. Its acceptance was de layed for some time by reason of a shortage of forty undershirts in his accounts, but the deficiency hav ing been satisfactorily explained the gallant Captain returned to civil life, and the service lost a good officer. He was discharged November 30th, 1898. The next man to withdraw the light of his coun tenance from our troop street, now beginning to lose somewhat its resemblance to a series of parallel mountain ranges, was Private William Silas White head, Jr., of Tent 9, whose many wise sayings, couched in merry guise, had contributed in such large measure to the attractiveness of the hospitality dispensed so generously by its occupants. He was commissioned Second Lieutenant in the Third United States Volunteer Engineers, and assigned as aide-de-camp to Brigadier- General A. C. M. Pennington, U.S.V. This assignment gave him an other week at Camp Black. General Pennington"], [488, "326 History of Troop \"A\" was soon afterward ordered to command the De partment of the Gulf, with headquarters at Atlanta, Ga., which gave \"Bill Silas\" another opportunity of revisiting the scenes of former victories, at the Ara gon and the Capitol City Club. He served as engi neer officer of the department and aide-de-camp until his departure for home, November 6th, and was discharged November ioth. Private Allan Appleton Robbins was appointed and commissioned First Lieutenant in the First United States Volunteer Engineers shortly after ward. His first service with his new organization was at the old New York State camp at Peekskill, so closely associated in the minds of all National Guardsmen of the Empire State with all that par takes of pageantry and hilarity in military affairs. The regiment sailed away to Puerto Rico in the early part of August, and its officers created a great sensation when they began to frequent the Hotel Francais by their new uniforms and caps among those who had been in the field longer and'jwhose wardrobes showed it. Lieutenant Robbins assisted in repairing the bridges near Aibonito, blown up by the Spaniards, and remained in the island until his family organized an expedition of their own, swooped down upon him, and carried him home in triumph. He then applied for and received an hon-"], [489, "Commissions 327 orable discharge. The separation from \"Baby\" that service in a foot regiment entailed was a severe blow, although a report that he commanded his company from the tail of an ambulance on the march shows that the effect of his cavalry training survived. The ruthless government now began to make large drafts on our devoted band, eight men being requisitioned in a week or less. A batch of second lieutenancies in the regular army was passed around and we lost a sergeant, three corporals and two privates. Some of these we had anticipated losing, but some were surprises. One of the latter was gallant enough to insist that he had no idea even how he came to be appointed, though others thought they could guess. They spent some weeks or so going back to their school-days in preparation for examinations \u2014 physical, mental and moral \u2014 and all passed. There being no vacancies in the cavalry, the arm to which they naturally inclined, five of them finally elected to go into the infantry, and were accordingly assigned: Corporal Edwin C. Hoyt and Private James M. A. Darrach to the Eleventh, Sergeant Alfred B. Maclay and Corporal G. Beekman Hoppin to the Fifth, and Private Charles R. Hickox, Jr., to the Second. Corporal C. Sidney Haight went to the Fourth Artillery."], [490, "328 History of Troop \"A\" Hoyt and Darrach were in company throughout. Their regiment having been ordered from Tampa to Puerto Rico, they got on board the U. S. S. \"St. Paul,\" at Newport News, on which vessel were Brig- adier-General Peter C. Hains, U.S.V., and staff, with a portion of his brigade. On arrival at Ponce General Hains was ordered to proceed to Arroyo and join General Brooke. Hoyt and Darrach, having learned that the Eleventh Infantry had not yet arrived, sought his advice, with the result that he procured them to be attached to his staff. They landed at Arroyo, and were present at the fight on the road to Guayama and the entrance into that town, as well as in the subsequent operations of General Brooke's column. They were of the few of the Troop \"A\" men who ever got into action; and they handled themselves, according to the unanimous testimony of eye-witnesses, as we all think we should have done if we had had an opportunity, and all of their old comrades are proud of them. Both returned with General Hains to the United States in Septem ber as casually as they had gone to Puerto Rico, and shortly afterward resigned, never having seen the regiment they were assigned to. Hoppin and Maclay reported to the Fifth Infan try at Tampa. This regiment was a part of General Schwan's brigade, and, like the rest of that com-"], [491, "Commissions 329 mand, was originally destined for Puerto Rico, but was switched off and sent to Santiago instead. Mac lay did not accompany them, however, as he had the grievous misfortune of losing his father while at Tampa, which compelled him to resign from the army. Hoppin left Tampa for Santiago on August 19th, and acted as quartermaster and commissary of the transport \"Knickerbocker\" on the voyage, which terminated on the 28th. They brought four cases of yellow fever to Cuba with them, contrary to the usual course of business in that line, which gave them two weeks in an isolation camp. Beekman is another of these modest men from whom it is impos sible to get particulars, but those who know him and have read Mr. Kipling's \" Only a Subaltern \" can paint their own pictures of Lieutenant Hoppin in command of Company \"G,\" and draw their own conclusions as to whether he was equal to the situa tion. The regiment, after the expiration of its quar antine, was fully occupied with the care of garrison ing Santiago and more sickness, until the dry season brought relief, when Hoppin resigned and came home. One of his achievements was the discovery of a Spanish gun that the whole of Lawton's division couldn't locate during the investment of the town, according to the story, although they had ample reason to know it was somewhere about. While"], [492, "History of Troop \"A\" 330 riding one morning, his attention was called to a trench on the hillside, which, on further investiga tion, disclosed the Spanish field-piece in question, with a quantity of ammunition, which had been abandoned along with the gun. Charles R. Hickox, Jr., was assigned to the Sec ond Infantry, and joined his regiment at Santiago, July 31st, shortly before it came home to Montauk. He soon afterward tendered his resignation, and it was accepted in time for him to spend a pleasant vacation of some seven weeks in Roosevelt Hospital as a typhoid patient. Charles Sidney Haight, who was assigned to the Fourth Artillery, is the only one of our half dozen regulars who still wears the uniform of old Uncle Sam. He reported at Tampa for duty with the siege train designed to batter the walls of San Juan de Puerto Rico about the heads of the Dons, but those crafty persons heard about it in some way and spared us the trouble. So Sidney's battery was ordered to return to Fort McHenry, Maryland. He effected an exchange into the Fourth Cavalry, and went to Manila. His anguish and disappointment at missing the Puerto Rico expedition may be gathered from the following composition by his facile pen, written on the spot that inspired the au thor of \"The Star-Spangled Banner.\""], [493, "Commissions 331 ;' Alas for soldier, alas for maid, Alas for those who at Tampa stayed ; Alas for those for warfare wishing, But always, alack, delay in transmission \u2014 For of all sad words of tongue or typewriter The saddest are these: \u2014 ' I'm an unsought fighter. Private Francis Burton Harrison was another of the men who had no idea whatever that the Govern ment was wishful to thrust honor upon them. This appears from an assertion of his own made on a prac tice march from Camp Alger, only fifteen minutes before the morning newspapers arrived containing the announcement that his nomination to be Cap tain and Assistant Adjutant General had gone to the Senate. He left Washington for Chickamauga on the night of July 5th, with little conception of the duties of his new position, be it said; but there is abundance of testimony from the highest author ity that he knew pretty much all about them long before his resignation was handed in and accepted. He was assigned on arrival at Camp Thomas to the Second Brigade, First Division, Third Army Corps, and remained on that duty until the Third Corps was merged into the Fourth, under command of Major-General Joseph Wheeler, U.S.V., October 14th. Then he was assigned to the First Brigade, Second Division of that corps, commanded by Brigadier-General G. S. Carpenter, who, as Lieuten-"], [494, "History of Troop \"A\" 332 ant-Colonel of the Seventh Infantry, was prominent in the capture of Caney. On September 4th his command had been moved toAnniston, Ala., where he remained until his return home and resignation, January 31st, 1899. While Harrison didn't get out of the United States at all, he came nearer on several occasions to being shot than many people who did, as some of the troops at Anniston, having come out to fight and finding no Spaniards convenient, showed a ten dency at times to mix it up with each other. Bullets occasionally came near enough to his tent to make the situation highly realistic, and some miscreant celebrated Thanksgiving Day by shooting his clerk through the heart from behind. Private Townsend Lawrence was commissioned First Lieutenant in the Second United States Vol unteer Engineers at about the same time that Rob bins, Harrison and the regular contingent forsook us, and was assigned as aide-de-camp to General Ernst, where he had Captain Frank Polk as a tent mate. Lieutenant Lawrence received his commis sion and orders about the time that General Ernst's brigade was moved to Charleston to embark for Puerto Rico, and, after going all the way to Chicka mauga only to find the command gone, finally caught up with it at tidewater.

Then followed six long weary weeks of rain, with the sick report of the brigade touching the forty per cent, mark constantly, when orders to advance to San Juan came. Headquarters had reached Cayey, thirty-six miles from San Juan, when a tele gram came recalling the brigade to Ponce, whence they were brought home. In December General Ernst was assigned to the staff of Major-General Brooke, Military Governor of the Island of Cuba, as Inspector-General, and sailed early in January, taking Lawrence with him as his personal aid.

Having secured a pass and gone into town accordingly, he was in formed that he could have a commission in one of the New York volunteer regiments about to be recruited under the second call; also that Brigadier- General Guy V.

On the day fixed, hov ever, Santiago capitulated, and General Henry, be ing exceedingly wise in his generation, instead of rushing wildly back on shore to attend the ceremony of surrender, remained on board ship, and thereby contrived to get off with the Puerto Rico expedi tion. The latter sailed from Guantanamo July 21st, and arrived at Guanica on the 25th, where Henry's \"Provisional Division\" were landed on that and the following days. Ponce having surrendered to an other expedition, General Henry was ordered to move on to that city, where Patterson experienced the happiest moment of his life when he met Sey mour Cromwell and his squad on the road to the Playa.

Shortly afterward Lieutenant"], [500, "336 History of Troop \"A\" Patterson returned home, joined his regiment for a few minutes, and was discharged from the United States service October 12th. Private Edwin Olaf Holter's narrative is tersely related by himself as follows : \"During the first week in July, I left the troop, and after nervously watch ing the tape (red) in Washington for about a week, I obtained a commission as Second Lieutenant, United States Volunteer Signal Corps. At the re quest of Brigadier-General Adelbert Ames, of Mas sachusetts, I was assigned to duty as aide on his staff. The Assistant Adjutant -General, unable to longer resist, by reason of frequent personal visits from myself and friends, gave me an order to re port at Santiago de Cuba by the first ship leaving Charleston or Newport News, Va. After buying out a tailor shop and brass factory in Washington, I hastened to Charleston to catch the steamer 'Grand Duchess,' but her sailing orders were suddenly countermanded and I returned, after a very hot trip, to Newport News. After waiting nearly a week longer in daily expectation of getting away, I re ceived further orders to go to New York and take the steamship 'Olivette,' sailing about July 20th.

Upon ar riving I found the fever at its full height, and the army in a pitiful condition, owing to sickness and consequent scarcity of men and supplies. I sub sidized a Cuban hack and reported to General Ames, who was camped four miles outside of Santiago, in command of the Third Brigade [Kent's Division], consisting of the Ninth, Thirteenth and Twenty fourth Infantry.

He was among the first to land at Arroyo with the Brooke expedition, but missed the capture of Guayama through having been sent back to Ponce to hurry the cavalry assigned to General Brooke's command. He got under fire, however, on the occasion of a reconnaissance by Colonel Coit, of the Fourth Ohio, some days after ward, and conducted himself with distinguished gallantry, although he modestly disclaims credit for much of the part in the affair attributed to him by the press reports. He is warm in his praise of the conduct of Lieutenants Darrach and Hoyt during the operations about Guayama and toward Cayey. Subsequently he accompanied General Brooke and the other Peace Commissioners for Puerto Rico to San Juan, sailed from there on the U. S. cruiser \"Cincinnati\" to St. Thomas, and took steamer thence to New York, resigning his com mission October 15th, 1898. Private Nathan M. Flower obtained a commission"], [503, "CORPORAL BROWN FARRIER MULLER A HAIR-CUT WITH THE HORSE-CLIPPERS"], [504, ""], [505, "Commissions 341 as Captain and Quartermaster, and turned up in Ponce like almost everybody else in course of time. He was about to start for Arroyo in plenary com mand of two transports when some envious fate caused him to fall down a hatch and break an arm and two ribs \u2014 the only member of Troop \"A\" who was wounded in the war! This, of course, neces sitated his being invalided home, and he soon after ward resigned. The untimely end of his military career was most regrettable, as he undoubtedly had a great future before him. He was the sweetest little Captain of the whole lot; even Frank Harrison didn't look any prettier in his uniform. Last of the list of those who left is Private Will iam Williams, who was appointed Major and Com missary of Subsistence, United States Volunteers, July 20th, 1898. After a few days at Newport News he was ordered to New York to- prepare the trans port \"Chester\" for sea and take charge of her on the voyage to Ponce, whither she was destined to carry the First Volunteer Engineers. It was while he was occupied in this duty that Wall Street was thrown into a panic by the clash of arms, and pre parations were being made to defend the Sub-Treas ury to the last rampart of silver dollars, when it was discovered that the commander of the raiders was armed with a warrant for the specie he demanded,"], [506, "History of Troop \"A\" 342 and merely held the other force in reserve in case the custodian of the Government funds refused to honor it. Shortly after his arrival at Ponce, Williams was detailed as Chief Commissary in place of Major Black, of General Miles's staff. He turned to and discharged the very onerous and responsible duties of the position in a most exemplary manner, until ordered to return to New York in charge of the \"Chester,\" about September ist. Upon his return he was attacked by typhoid fever, and went on sick leave to Europe to recover from its effects. Williams was peculiarly fitted by his energy, conscientiousness and business experience for the position he filled, and in his knowledge of matters pertaining to water transportation he outclassed many regular officers in the Quartermaster's and Commissary Depart ments. His resignation was accepted March 12th, 1899. In conclusion, it may be said, without fear of contradiction, that while none of the men who left Troop \"A\" and accepted commissions attained to high command or achieved especial distinction, their record is a good one, and their comrades have every reason to feel gratified with it. And, on the other hand, Troop *A's\" graduates, if they may be so termed, should, and do, feel proud of and grateful for their connection with it. The fact of having"], [507, "Commissions 343 been a member of the New York Troop was a pass port with army men everywhere, and caused officers to show much more interest in one of our men than they would have taken in the average volunteer or \"fresh caught.\" And the feeling that the departing ones had that, while separated from their former associations, they none the less held the honor of Troop \"A\" in their hands equally with their old comrades in the ranks, did much to make them the successes that they were in their new fields of use fulness."], [508, "Hn flfcemoriam pbilip IReMngton slDufcge Ibilbretb Born at Flushing, N.

He had been a member of the squadron but a very short time when Troop \"A\" went to Camp Black, and was personally known to but few of his future comrades. But, under the conditions of camp life, a brief period suffices to reveal the stuff of which a man is made; and really to know Phil Hildreth was to love him. He was an earnest and seemingly tireless worker, thoroughly imbued with a soldierly spirit, unselfish and conscientious to a degree. His most conspicuous characteristic was his unvarying cheerfulness, which was such as to make almost incomprehensible the melancholy that settled upon him from the fever he contracted dur ing the campaign, and in the delirium of which the end came. \" Taps \" never sounded over the grave of a more loyal heart, and none of those who fell in the ex citement of battle gave their lives for the flag more truly than did \" dear old Phil.\""], [509, "Muster-Out Roll (First date after name is \"joined or enrolled.\" D.
