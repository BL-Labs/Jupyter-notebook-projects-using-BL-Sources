Head-quarters 2d Brigade Ruggles' Division, 2d Army Corps, Army of the Mississippi, Corinth, Miss., April 17, 1862. To Captain R. M. Hooe, A. A. General. Division Head-quarters : Captain : \u2014 I have the honor to make the following report of the part taken by my brigade in the actions of the 6th and 7th of April, at Shiloh, near the Tennessee river. On the night of the 4th, in his tent, near Meckey's house, Gen. Bragg developed to the division and brigade commanders the plan of the proposed attack upon the enemy's forces, encamped at and around Shiloh Church. By this plan, Ruggles' division was to form on the left of the second line of battle, its left resting upon Owl creek and its right on or near the Bark road. My brigade (the 2d) was to compose the reserve of this division, and occupy a position several hundred yards in rear of its centre, for the purpose of sup porting the right or left, as occasion might require. A sufficient interval was to be left between the 1st and 3d brigades to admit of my deploying forward into line, should such a movement be found necessary. The furious storm which raged during the greater portion of the night of the 4th, prevented the movement of the army from its biv ouac at Meckey's, until some time beyond the hour designated by Gen. Bragg, although my brigade was ready to march at 3 o'clock, a. m., of the 5th, and was so reported at the division head-quarters. At about 3 o'clock, p. m., of the 5th, my command took its position in the column on the Bark road, marching left in front, in the direc tion of Shiloh. The roads were much blocked up by the trains of wagons and artillery attached to the corps in front. In order to reach my position in the designated line of battle at the hour indi cated in the plan, I left the main road, taking a course through the woods parallel to the road, passing other trains and brigades, till the way was found open, only a short distance at the point at which I was to file off to the left, and form line at right angles, or nearly so, with the Bark road, on which the column was moving. This point was reached by the head of my column at about 4 p. m., on"], [10, "300 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. the 5th instant, Col. Pond, commanding the 3d brigade, Ruggles' division, having preceded me in the direction of Owl creek. After leaving the Bark road, and following Col. Pond's command about half a mile, I found his rear halted and his line being formed. Meet ing Gen. Bragg at this point, he gave me some directions as to the formation, rectifying in some measure the line formed by Col. Pond. Soon after this, I met Brig.-gen. Ruggles, commanding the division, who substantially reiterated Gen. Bragg's instructions, which I was in the act of carrying out. I formed the brigade two hundred and seventy yards in rear of the division, in column at half distance, doubled on the centre, my right and left respectively half masked by the left and right of the 1st and 3d brigades. After posting an adequate guard, arms were stacked, and the troops bivouacked on the lines. The night was clear, the air cool and bracing, quite in contrast with the previous one. At 4 a. h., on the 6th inst., the men were aroused without fife or drum, and silently, but promptly, resumed their arms, ready for the order to move forward. This order was soon received, and obeyed with alacrity. At this time, the second line of battle (of which my brigade composed a reserve on the left) was supposed to be about 1000 yards in rear of the 1st, or Gen. Hardee's line. We had not moved forward over half this distance, however, when I discovered that we were approaching within two or three hundred yards of it, having taken the step and direction from the 1st brigade (Col. Gib son's) on my right. I also discovered at this time that the right of Col. Pond's (the 3d brigade) had not yet taken up the line of march. A few moments previous, I had received an order from Gen. Bragg through one of his staff, to close the interval in front of me, by form ing on Col. Gibson's left. This had been executed before we halted a moment to allow Gen. Hardee's line to regain its proper interval. Both lines were soon in motion again, and before proceeding far a few scattering musket shots were heard, apparently about half a mile to our right, and after a short interval, one or two volleys suc ceeded, the sound coming in the same direction. Occasional reports were now heard along our right and centre, and seemed to be gradually extending towards our left. At this time my brigade was marching in line of battle, in the following order, from right to left viz.: The 17th regiment of Louisiana Volunteers, aggregate 326 commanded by Lieut.-col. Charles Jones ; the Confederate Guards Response battalion, aggregate 169, commanded by Major F. H. Clack ; the Florida battalion, about 250 aggregate, commanded by Major S. A. McDowell ; the 9th Texas infantry, 226 aggregate"], [11, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 301 commanded by Col. W. A. Stanley ; and the 20th regiment Louisi ana Volunteers, 507 aggregate, commanded by Col. Auguste Reichard. The 5th company Washington Artillery, 155 men, commanded by Capt. W. Irving Hodgson, following the centre as nearly as the nature of the ground would permit, ready to occupy an interval either between the Florida battalion and the 9th Texas, or between the 9th Texas and 20th Louisiana, as necessity or con venience might require ; the whole composing a force of 1634 men. The engagement had now fairly commenced on the right/, and that portion of Major-gen. Hardee's line, to which we were now moving up, by order of Gen. Bragg, was sharply engaging the enemy's skirmishers. The face of the country at this point, consisting of alternate hills and boggy ravines, overgrown with heavy timber and thick underbrush, presented features remarkably favorable for the operations of skilful skirmishers. Our impetuous volunteers charged them, however, wherever they appeared, and drove them from their cover back to their lines near the first camp met with on the Bark road, leading towards Pittsburg. Here the enemy, having greatly the advantage of position for both his infantry and artillery, made a more creditable stand. A battery of his field pieces was in posi tion on the height of a domineering hill, from four to six hundred yards in front of our lines, commanding his camp and the approaches to it. Immediately in our front, and between us and this battery, ran a boggy ravine, the narrow swamp of which was thickly over grown with various species of shrubs, saplings, and vines, so densely interwoven as to sometimes require the use of a knife to enable the footman to pass. Over this the enemy's battery had a full field to fire upon our whole lines. As we descended the declivity, termin ating in the swamp, and on the opposite skirts of the swamp, his infantry had all the advantages presented by such shelter on one side and obstacles on the other. This ravine and its accompanying obstacles could be avoided on the right, but my position in the line required a dislodgment of the enemy from his cover, before taking a movement in that direction, lest he should fall upon my flank and rear, before I could make the circuit of the swamp and hill, to reach him where he was. The most favorable position attainable by our field pieces was se lected, and Capt. Hodgson was directed to open fire upon the ene my's battery, (now playing vigorously upon us,) with solid shot and shrapnel, and when occasion offered, without danger to our own troops, to use canister upon his infantry. This order was obeyed with alacrity. Taking advantage of this diversion in our favor, the"], [12, "302 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. infantry was directed to pass through the swamp, and drive the enemy before it, until Capt. Hodgson could either silence his bat tery, or an opportunity presented of taking it with the bayonet. The movement was made with spirit and vigor. As my left reached the thicket at the ravine, a regiment on our left and front, which had been unable to cross the branch, came back in some con fusion, breaking the lines of the 20th Louisiana, and causing similar confusion in its ranks. Both were soon, however, reformed, and the 20th Louisiana (Col. Reichard) regained its proper position in line, and forced its way across the swamp under a heavy fire from the enemy. At this time the most of my right, the 17th Lousiana, the Confederate Guards, and the Florida battalion, had crossed the branch and made a charge up a hill into the edge of the enemy's camp, but his battery was playing upon them with such vigor that they fell back, in order, a short distance, to a point where they were sheltered by the brow of the hill. The perceptibly diminish ing fire from the enemy's battery was soon, by Capt. Hodgson's superior practice, entirely silenced. Our infantry, which, in the meantime had crossed the boggy ravine, pressed up the hill on the other side, driving the enemy from his camp, and reaching the bat tery in time to pour several rounds into the ranks of the fleeing cannoniers and their supports, both right and left. The action now became general, as was evidenced by the unremitting roll of small arms and artillery along the whole line. In the attack upon the camp first alluded to, and the taking of the battery, my command had assumed a position in the front line, availing itself, for this purpose, of an interval nearly in front of us, in our first line of battle. After passing their first battery, and being driven through their second and third camps into the fourth, the enemy made a more obstinate resistance, being favored in this by the nature of the ground. Once, and again, our volunteers nobly responded to the order to dislodge him. The odds in numbers were in his favor, as well as the advantage in position, but as com rade after comrade fell by his side, each Confederate seemed to be inspired with fresh courage and determination to win the fight, or lose his life. At one time the lines upon my right wavered, and seemed to give way for a moment, but a wave of the hat to my own brigade, (the voice could not be heard) seemed well under stood, and the command \" forward,\" which it implied, was most gal lantly executed. Again the lines of the enemy gave way, but a bat tery to our left and front now disclosed itself in heavy fire upon our centre and right. About this time each command in the brigade"], [13, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 303 lost several gallant officers and many not less gallant men. I dis patched an aid, Lieut. Davidson, to the rear to order up a battery, and withdrew the infantry a short distance to better shelter. The artillery gained a favorable position in a few minutes, perhaps before Lieut. Davidson had had time to deliver my order, and promptly opened fire upon its antagonist. The infantry was brought up again on the right of the battery, at supporting distance, held its fire till a favorable moment arrived, when a few well directed vol leys, followed by a shout and a charge to the front, caused the enemy again to give way in some confusion, leaving his battery behind. It is entirely out of my power to give a circumstantial account of all the operations of the command during the remainder of this day's wrork. Our movements were all onward. Meeting one of Gen. Bragg's aids about this time, I remarked to him, that \" from the position originally assigned me, that of a reserve, I had worked my way into the front line.\"' In a few moments he passed again and said, \" no difference, the general desires you to go wherever the fight is thickest.\" The enemy's fire in front and to our left was now evidently diminishing. Not so, however, on our right. I therefore determined to swing around on my right, and endeavor to press the enemy's right centre back upon his right, where Gen. Hardee's invincible columns were driving him towards the river. One of his batteries lay immediately in our front, concealed by un dergrowth and a sharp ravine. In approaching it, I met Col. Smith, of the Crescent regiment, who had become detached from his bri gade, and now proposed to unite with mine, to which I gladly con sented, and directed him to form on my left. After consulting together for a few moments, and making some inquiry of Gen. Gardner, who was passing at the moment, and who had recon noitered the ground in the vicinity of the battery which lay in our front, and which, by this time, was getting our range pretty well. I determined to move around my right a short distance, letting Col. Smith go to the lest, and, from the position thus gained, to make a simultaneous movement upon the infantry supporting the battery, while a section of our own field pieces engaged them in front. In moving forward through the thick underbrush before alluded to, I met a portion of a Louisiana regiment (13th, I think), return ing, and their officers informed me that I could not get through the brush. I pushed forward, however, and had crossed the ravine and commenced the ascent of the opposite slope, when a galling fire from"], [14, "304 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. infantry, and canister from howitzers, swept through my ranks with deadly effect. The thicket was so dense that it was impossible for a company officer to be seen at platoon distance. The enemy's canister was particularly well-directed, and the range, being that of musketry, was well calculated to test the pluck of the sternest. So far as I was able to observe, however, there was no consternation or dismay in our ranks. The 20th Louisiana suffered most, its gallant colonel having his horse shot, and many of its rank and file meeting soldiers' deaths. They fell back, fighting as they retired, to a point from fifty to a hundred yards in the rear, where the brow of a hill afforded shelter from the canister. A hurried reconnoisance revealed a point from which the enemy could be more advantageously assailed. Lieut. Davidson, of my staff, was dispatched to Gen. Ruggles, not far off, with a request that he would send up a few pieces of artil lery to a position indicated, whence a vigorous fire, I felt confident, would soon silence the battery, which was the main obstacle to our onward movement. Changing my position somewhat to suit the circumstances (several officers of the 20th Louisiana having reported to me their men were unable to make another charge, by reason of the complete state of exhaustion they were in), I determined to make another effort to dislodge the enemy from his position, with what of my command was left. Gen. Ruggles had now placed our battery in position. Col. Smith, of the Crescent regiment, had driven the enemy's sharpshooters from the cover of a log cabin and a few cotton bales on the extreme left and near the road, and the enemy was being sorely pressed upon the extreme right by our columns upon that flank, and I felt the importance of pressing for ward at this point. The troops, too, seemed to be inspired with the same feeling. Our battery opened rapidly, but every shot told. To the command \" forward,\" the infantry responded with a shout, and in less than five minutes after our artillery commenced playing, and before the infantry had advanced within shot range of the enemy's lines, we had the satisfaction of seeing his proud banner lowered, and a white one hoisted in its stead. Our troops on the right had been engaging a portion of his lines, unseen by us on account of an intervening hill, and when the white flag was run up, they reached it first. The sun was now near the western horizon; the battle around us had ceased to rage. I met Gen. Ruggles, who directed me to take a road, which was not far to my left, and to move down in the direction of the river. I had not proceeded far when, over taking me, he ordered a halt till some artillery could be taken to the front, when he would give me further directions. Soon after"], [15, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 305 halting, several brigades, composing portions of Gens. Polk and Hardee's commands, filed across the road in front of me, and moved off to the left, at a right angle to the road, and commenced forming line of battle in an open field and woods beyond. Several batteries passed down the road in the direction of Pittsburg. One soon re- turned, and filed off into the field where the infantry was forming. The enemy's gunboats now opened fire. Gen. Ruggles directed me to move forward a short distance, and'by inclining to the right to gain a little hollow, which would probably afford better protection for my men against shell than the position I then occupied. I gained the hollow and called a halt, ordering the men to take cover behind the hill, and near a little ravine which traversed the hollow. We occupied this position some ten or fifteen minutes, when one of Gen. Ruggles' staff directed me to retire to the enemy's camp, beyond the range of his floating guns. In filing off from this posi- tion several men were killed and many wounded by the exploding shells of the enemy. It was now twilight. As soon as we had placed a hill between us and the gunboats, the troops moved slowly and apparently with reluctance from the direction of the river. It was eight o'clock at night before we had reached a bivouac near Gen. Bragg's head-quarters, and in the darkness of the night the 20th Louisiana and portions of the 17th Louisiana and Confederate Guards, got separated from that portion of the command in which I was, and encamped on other ground. By the assistance of my staff, the whereabouts of the whole command was ascertained before we slept. I reported in person to Gen. Ruggles, who gave some directions in regard to collecting the stragglers, and requested that I should report to him again if any thing of importance occurred during the night. I retired to the bivouac, which was in an open field and apple orchard, near the Big spring. I had purposely avoided the enemy's tents, fearing the effect their rich spoils might produce upon hungry and exhausted troops. Before twelve o'clock one of those terrific rain storms, to which we had so frequently been exposed of late, set in with pitiless vehemence, which was scarcely abated till dawn of day. With my saddle for a seat, and \u2022 blanket thrown over my head, I sat all night at the root of an. apple tree. My staff and troops cheerfully partook of the same fare. Soon after daylight on Monday morning, the 7th, I received orders from both Gens. Bragg and Ruggles, through their staff officers, to hold myself in readiness to move out and meet the enemy. I hastened to make preparations accordingly. The command was marched off from its bivouac by the right flank, in the direction of 20"], [16, "306 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. Pittsburg, and after proceeding about a half of a mile, was formed in line of battle on the right of some Tennessee troops, believed to belong to Gen. Cheatham's command. Some delay was had at this point by the constant delay of troops in fragments of brigades, regiments, and companies. A portion of the 20th Louisiana, the Confederate Guards battalion, and 9th Texas regiment, had become detached from my immediate command, by permitting other troops to cut them out on the march, and in falling into line. A line of battle was, however, formed, and a forward movement commenced. By this time our skirmishers on the right had engaged those of the enemy, but no general action had begun. Our advance movement had not continued far, however, till the enemy's lines were disclosed in front. Our troops went into action with a spirit and alacrity scarcely to be expected after the fatigues and hardships of the previous days and nights. The enemy was evidently in large force, and his troops were fresh. The first onset was maintained with spirit by both armies, and for nearly an hour the conflict raged in this part of the field with doubtful results. Several times we pressed forward against the superior numbers of the enemy's fresh columns, but he stubbornly maintained his position. Our officers and men seemed resolved to drive him back, and sum moning every thing fof another struggle, we led the columns up with a volley and a shout from the whole line, which proved irresistible, and sent him flying back to his second line, which was strongly posted some two hundred yards in the rear. About this time Col. Campbell, commanding a Tennessee regiment (number not remem bered), attached himself to my brigade, and fought gallantly dur ing the day. I received an order about the same time to support a column then hotly engaged some half mile to my right, but before reaching the position, our column had fallen back to better ground, and I was directed to support a battery on our left in conjunction with Col. Trabue's Kentucky command. I filed off to the left, crossing a camp and the avenue under a heavy fire, and reached a ravine on Col. Trabue's right, with my right resting upon the bor der of the avenue. The enemy's battery was in position some four hundred yards to our front, and ours was about the same distance to my left, in a favorable position to silence it. Sharpshooters had been thrown forward, and taken position behind a line of logs that had been rolled out to one side of the avenue, and were now pick. ing off my men as they stood waiting for our battery to accomplish its work. I ordered forward a detachment of skirmishers to dis lodge the enemy's sharpshooters, who were posted behind the"], [17, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 307 breastwork of logs before alluded to. They accomplished their work in handsome style, and held the position from which they annoyed the cannoniers, who were playing upon our battery on the lest. Observing this advantage, I rode over to the battery to see the commanding officer of the infantry, posted on my left, and between me and the battery, to ascertain if he could spare me a force suf ficient to enable me to charge and take the enemy's pieces. I first met Major Monroe, of the 4th Kentucky, who referred me to Gen. Trabue, to whom I was soon introduced. Hurriedly explaining to him my strength and position, and urging the importance of taking the battery in question, adding my conviction that it could be done, he readily consented to furnish me two regiments for that purpose, and directed an officer near by to accompany me to where the regi ments were posted. I had not proceeded, however, beyond his sight, when he called to me, and approaching, said : \" Upon reflec tion, I think I had better not let those regiments leave their present position, since I am directed to support this battery, if attacked.\" I returned to my command, and found that the enemy had discov ered my position, obtained the range, and was shelling us at a rapid rate. Not having the force to take his battery, and being unable to obtain assistance in that part of the field, I withdrew to a position a short distance in the rear, and behind, the brow of the next hill. Here I found Gen. Cheatham, with a portion of his command, who bad fallen back from a point farther to the lest. I formed on his right, and the enemy now appearing on the lest, we encountered him again, and pushed him back a short distance to where more favorable ground enabled him to stand. We were in an open plain with a few scattering trees, but not enough to afford material shel ter. The opposing forces were strongly posted in superior numbers in a dense wood, affording excellent cover. Our troops stood and saw their comrades fall about them, but returned the tire with spirit for a length of time, till some detached commands on the extreme left gave way, when the whole line retired behind the brow of a hill, some hundred and fifty to two hundred yards in the rear. Here they rallied and formed again. Gen. Cheatham was particu larly active in effecting the re-formation, urging his troops to make a stand, and assuring them of their ability to repulse the enemy. Lieut. Sandidge, also of Gen. Ruggles' staff, did gallant service in the same way. I take pleasure in referring to a circumstance which came under my own observation, as none of his immediate superiors. were present to record it. When one of Gen. Cheatham's regi ments had been appealed to in vain to make a charge on the advanc-"], [18, "308 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. ing foe, Lieut. Sandidge, seizing its colors, and holding them high over head, calling upon the regiment to follow him, he spurred his horse to the front, and charged over the brow of the hill amidst a shower of leaden hail from the enemy. The effect was electrical. The regiment moved gallantly to the support of its colors, but su perior numbers soon pressed it back to its original position. Col. Stanley, of the 9th Texas, did the same thing with the same result. Large numbers of stragglers could now be seen in all directions, making their way to the rear. Officers of several regiments report ed to me that their commands were out of ammunition, and that the ammunition wagons had all retired to the rear. I detailed a non-commissioned officer and two men from the Florida battalion to go in search of ammunition. He soon returned, having succeed ed in finding a few boxes in a camp near by \u2014 whether left there by our wagons or by the enemy, I am unable to say. While the am munition was being distributed, one of Gen. Beauregard's staff came by and directed us to retire in order, in the direction of our hospit al. On reaching the brow of the next hill, in an open space, I halted the brigade and faced about, hoping with the assistance of two pieces of artillery, which I observed near by, that a check would be given to the enemy's advance, if indeed he could not be driven back. He had halted, evidently, in doubt whether to ad vance or not. I rode up to an officer who appeared to have charge of the pieces alluded to, and requested him to open fire upon a line which I pointed out. He informed me that he was out of ammu nition, had- no horses to draw off his pieces, and had just received orders to spike them and leave them on the ground. The enemy's lines were still at a halt. I moved on up the road till I met an officer, who told me it was Gen. Bragg's order, that the infantry should form on a certain ridge, which was pointed out. I formed there, but was soon directed by Col. Jordan, of Gen. Beauregard's staff, to fall back to another hill, which he designated, and there form at right angles with the road. I did as directed, and waited some time for further orders, or for the enemy to advance. A staff officer from Gen. Beauregard then came, and ordered the infantry to retire to Monterey, parallel with a road a short distance to my left. At a fork of the road, a portion of the command took the road to Meckey's. The balance proceeded to Monterey under their respective officers. I went to Meckey's, as did a portion of my staff, where I met Gen. Ruggles, and reported to him for furthei instructions. He directed me to proceed the next morning with my command to Corinth, and there resume our camps, the tents of which had been left standing when we started for Shiloh."], [19, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 309 It is not proper that I should close this report without bringing to the notice of the general commanding the names of such officers as made themselves conspicuous for their gallantry and efficiency in the field. Lieut.-col. Charles Jones, commanding the 17th regiment Louisiana volunteers, was wounded early in the action, and retired from the field. Major F. II. Clack, commanding Confederate Guards battalion, was ever where the conflict raged hottest, holding his command well in hand, cheering, encouraging and stimulating the men to deeds of valor and renown. Major Clack had two horses shot under him. Major McDowell, commanding the Florida bat- talion, wras borne wounded from the field, before the action had fairly begun. The command devolved upon Capt. Poole, who bore himself most gallantly throughout the two days' conflict. The skill with which he handled his command reflected the highest credit upon him as an officer, while the desperation with which his troops fought brings new lustre to the arms of the State they represented, and paints imperishable fame upon the colors they so proudly bore. Col. Stanley, of the 9th Texas regiment, has already been inciden- tally alluded to. The language of eulogy could scarcely do more than simple justice to the courage and determination of this officer and his valorous Texans. Ever in the thickest of the fight, they were always ready to respond to any demand upon their courage and endurance. Col. Reichard, commanding the 20th Louisiana regiment, deserves the highest commendation and praise for his in- defatigable valor, in leading his command wherever the foe was strongest. Col. Reichard's skill and efficiency as an officer are only excelled by his intrepidity and valor. Lieut.-col. Boyd, of the same regiment, did his whole duty, regardless of a painful wound in the arm, which he received in the first day's engagement. Major Von Zinker, also, performed well his part, having three horses shot under him during the conflict. Capt. W. Irving Hodgson, commanding the 5th company, Washington Artillery, added fresh lustre to the fame of this already renowned corps. It was his fine practice from the brow of the hill overlooking the enemy's first camp, that enabled our infantry to rout them in the outset, thus giving confidence to our troops, which was never afterwards once shaken. Although the nature of the ground over which my infantry fought was such as frequently to preclude the use of artillery, yet Capt. Hodgson was not idle. I could hear of his battery, whenever artillery was needed. On several occasions, I witnessed the effect which his can ister and round shot produced upon the enemy's masses, and once saw his cannoniers stand to their pieces under a deadly fire, when"], [20, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 310 there was no support at hand, and when to have retired would have left that part of the field to the enemy. When a full history of the bat tles of Shiloh shall have been written, the heroic deeds of the Wash ington Artillery will illustrate one of its brighest pages, and the names of Hodgson and Slocomb will be held in grateful remem brance by a free people, long after the sod has grown green upon the bloody hills of Shiloh ! Many other names deserve to be recorded as bright ornaments to the roll of the brave who fought at Shiloh, but the limits of my re port, already too extended, forbid it. Where all behaved so well, I would prefer not to omit a name from the list, but such a course is impracticble at this time. I take pleasure in referring to the reports of the regimental commanders for more minute detail in relation to the battle ; and for the names of many subalterns, non-commissioned officers, and privates, who deserve notice and commendation for gal lant conduct on the field. I beg leave to be permitted, in this connection, to record the names of my staff officers, to whom I am greatly indebted for their very active assistance throughout the battle. Capt. Wm. G. Barth, A. A. G. and Chief of Staff, rendered invaluable service in transmit ting orders and making perilous reconnoissances. I was deprived of his services during a portion of the time, by his horse being killed under' him, the place of which he found it difficult to supply, Lieut. Wm. M. Davidson, aid-de-camp, was constantly by my side, except when absent by my orders, all of which he delivered with promptitude and intelligence. While engaged in this, and passing from one portion of the field to another, he made many narrow es capes, having frequently to pass under most galling fires to reach his point of destination. Lieut. John W. Janes, 5th Georgia regi ment, acting aid-de-camp, also rendered useful service early in the action of the sixth (6th), but getting cut off during the day, by some means, from the command, I saw nothing more of him till late in the evening, when he rejoined me, and remained with me till we with drew from the field. Capt. Henry D. Bulkley, acting brigade com missary, also served on my personal staff on the occasion, and did good service till a minnie ball deprived him of his horse. As soon as he was able to supply himself again, he rejoined me and gave me his ready assistance. Lieut. Wm. McR. Jordan, 1st Florida regi ment, temporarily attached as an acting aid-de-camp, was always at his po^t, ready to perform any service required of him. A spent ball striking him in the loin, compelled him to retire for a while from the field, but he soon returned, having received no other injury"], [21, "311 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. than a severe contusion, which, though painful, did not disable him. Capt. John T. Sibley, brigade quarter-master, deserves the highest praise for his activity and promptitude in keeping up our supply of ammunition during the day's fight. He was ever present, ready to respond to any call for this indispensable want of the soldier on the battle-field. He was equally efficient in bringing off from the field all the ammunition not consumed, as well as his wagons, ambulances, mules, or other means ofi transportation, returning to Corinth with out the loss of any. Surgeon C. B. Gamble, Brigade Medical Director, was indefatigable in his labors throughout both days of the battle ; rendering, cheerfully and promptly, his professional services when ever and wherever needed. These were not pretermitted during the night of the 6th and 7th, after others, exhausted by the fatigues of the battle-field, had sought early repose. In the discharge of his duty, while endeavoring to alleviate the pains of our wounded, and to bring away as many of them as could be safely removed, he fell into the hands of the enemy after our rear guard had retired. Our army can illy spare, at this time, one whose private worth is so inestima ble, and whose professional skill is invaluable. For a detailed statement of the killed, wounded, and missing of my command, I refer to the reports and lists transmitted, by which it will appear, that I took into the field an aggregate of 1,636. The casualties were 434, a loss of a little over 26 per cent. Among 14 mounted officers, including my staff, eleven horses were killed under their riders.

I have the honor herewith to report the proceedings of my regiment in the battle of Shiloh, on the 6th and 7th of April,"], [22, "312 official reports of battles. 1862. On the morning of the 6th, we advanced in line of battle under a heavy fire of artillery and musketiy from the enemy's first encampment. Being ordered to charge the enemy with our bay onets, we made two successive attempts, but finding, as well as our comrades in arms on our right and left, it almost impossible to withstand the heavy fire directed at our ranks, we were compelled to withdraw for a short time, with considerable loss. Being then ordered, we proceeded immediately to the support of the Washing ton Artillery, which, from their battery's well directed fire, soon silenced the battery of the enemy. After which we immediately charged, routing the enemy from their first encampment, and con tinued a forward double-quick march until we passed through two other encampments of the enemy, where we found our troops again heavily engaged with a second battery and its supports, to the galling fire of which my regiment was openly exposed. At this 2)oint my horse wras shot from under me, and several of my bravest men were killed and wounded. We nevertheless succeeded in driving the enemy from their battery, killing a number and pur suing the remainder a considerable distance beyond. At this point, the supply of ammunition in the cartridge-boxes of my men being exhausted, I was compelled to resort to my ammunition wagon, a short distance off, for a fresh supply. In the meantime, firing con tinued incessantly on our right. We were then ordered to join the command in that direction, who were reported to have the enemy badly routed, and driving them towards their gunboats. After proceeding some distance, we found ourselves in the range of shell and shot fired from the boats and vicinity. At this point, night put a close to the action for the day of the 6th. We retired from this point to form our encampment for the night, our troops being more or less scattered, some having been completely exhausted from the fatigues of the day. We formed them in two groups, leaving one to encamp on the battle-field, the other near the gen eral hospital. On the morning of the 7th, I again formed my regiment, and proceeded to the battle-field. After arriving there, the enemy again opened sire on our left. We were ordered to the support of a bat tery stationed to defend that point, but our support not being required at the time we reached the battery, two companies of my regiment were deployed as skirmishers, while the remainder stood in line of battle in a hollow at a distance of two hundred yards from the breastworks of the enemy, our skirmishers returning and reporting the enemy advancing towards the breastworks. At this"], [23, "313 official reports of battles. moment the skirmishers of the enemy appeared at the breastworks, when we were ordered to charge them, which we did successfully, although under a heavy fire of both musketry and artillery, only one man being wounded in the charge. After their guns were silenced at this point, we were ordered to the right, where a heavy fire of small arms had commenced. On reaching the scene of action at this point, the enemy seemed to have been routed, having ceased firing. After being halted and formed in line of battle, firing again com menced on our left. We were ordered again to that point, and there became engaged with a strong force of the enemy's line. We advanced, and sustained our position for some time after the troops on our right and left had given way, but my regiment being small, and losing two among our bravest officers, Capt. J. J. Dick son, of company \" I,\" and Lieut. Hamil, of company \" F,\" they being killed at this point, with several of my men, I was compelled to fall back, though still keeping up our fire. We again rallied and formed in line, making a desperate struggle, causing the enemy to fall back for a short distance. The enemy then making a move to wards our right flank, we fell back in line, taking advantage of the cover of some rising ground to secure them, and there remained, the enemy retiring towards the woods on our right. We were then withdrawn from the field. The number taken into action was two hundred and twenty-six (226), including officers and enlisted men. The number killed in action, three (3) commissioned officers and eleven (11) enlisted. Woundedj two (2) commissioned and forty (40) enlisted. Missing, eleven (11) enlisted.

I am, general, very respectfully, Your obedient servant, S. S. HEARD, Colonel commanding 17th La. Volunteers. Report of Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Jones. Head-quarters 17th Regiment Louisiana Volunteers, Camp Coeinth, April 11, 1862. To W. G. Barth, Captain and Assistant Adjutant-general, C. S. Forces : Sir : I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken by the 17th regiment Louisiana volunteers, in the action of the 6th and 7th instant, near the Tennessee river. We were brought into action on the morning of the 6th, occupy ing the extreme right of the brigade, until we were exposed to the enemy's artillery, where we remained for some time, until we were ordered, with a portion of the line on our right and lest, to take a battery immediately in our front. A Tennessee regiment, the 22d, I think, was in front of us. We were delayed a moment by this regiment, when I gave the order to charge. When we reached the top of the hill, the enemy poured into us a murderous fire. The Tennessee regiment before referred to, retired by a flank through our lines, cutting their way through the centre of our fourth com pany, separating our right from our left, and throwing us into some confusion. We did not retire, however, until we had poured several volleys into the enemy. We lost several killed and wounded in this charge. We retired to the foot of the hill to re-form for a second attack. The right wing also retired further to the right, having been cut off from the colors by the Tennessee regiment. They charged the second time with, I think, the 20th Louisiana, on the enemy's left line of support, when the battery was secured. I"], [25, "official reports of battles. 315 charged with the left wing on the enemy's right, around the left of the hill, when I received a destructive flank fire from another of the enemy's batteries, as well as from his small arms. From this position we were compelled to fall back to our first. It was in this second charge that Capt. R. H. Curry, of company C, and Capt. W. A. Maddux, of company I, both fell severely wounded. It was now my object to unite the two wings which were acting separately, the right under command of Capt. Rogers, of company A. I found this impossible; and, with the left, which was much the larger portion, and to which the colors were attached, I advanced, by the lest flank, to take a position about 200 yards in front. In accomplishing this, we had to cross a ravine, where we were exposed to a raking fire of shot and shell, as well as from small arms. It was in passing this ravine that my sergeant-major, Thuron Stone, who had been of great service to me thus far in the action, fell at my side leading the column. He was shot through the thigh, though not dangerously. On reaching the hill, 1st Lieut. T O. Hines, of com pany K, had his left arm carried away by a cannon ball. Imme diately after, I received a very severe shock and bruise by being thrown from my horse. He was frightened by the bursting of a bomb. Having recovered from my fall and secured my horse, I hurried on to the action. I could not find my left wing, which I afterwards learned behaved gallantly, under command of Capt. Otterson, of company H. I found a portion of the right wing joined with the Confederate Guard and a portion of the 11th Louisiana. We charged upon a line of the enemy, and drove them from the field. We remained in this position for a considerable time, when Gen. Anderson arrived with the 20th Louisiana* and ordered the line forward. At this moment I was wounded in the arm by a minie ball, and retired. After having my wound dressed, I immediately returned to the field in search of my command. I fell in with Gen. Ruggles, and reported myself to him. He invited me to remain with him, as the action was drawing to a close. The enemy having retired and left us in possession of the field, and being unable to find more than about fifty of my command, I, with my adjutant, who had received a slight wound, retired with this small force to the ambulance depot to assist the wounded, and remain during the night. Our wounded suffered greatly, having nothing to protect them from the rain, which fell in torrents a greater por tion of the night. Many of them lay that night in pools of water two or three inches deep. On the morning of the 7th I sent my adjutant on to form the regiment, or such portions of it as he could"], [26, "316 official reports of battles. find near the Big Spring. When I came up with my small com mand, I found that my adjutant had joined some other brigade with what number he could find. I, with what few men I had managed to gather together (about 200 in all), composed of strag glers from different regiments, with the aid of Capt. Self, of com pany B, who had now for the first time appeared upon the field, and some other officers, managed to form a line, and keep it in place, until ordered by Gen. Ruggles to advance. The general, at this instant, rode in front of the lines, and seizing the flag from the hands of the color-bearer, gallantly led them to the charge. In this charge he was assisted by Col. S. S. Heard. Capt. Self, of company B, fell severely wounded. Our forces now began to retire from the field. The officers and soldiers under my command, so far as came under my observation, behaved with much gallantry. They went into action on the second day, however, with much less alacrity than on the day previous, which I attributed to the fatigue and exposure of the previous day and night. With great respect, Your obedient servant, CHARLES JONES, Lieut.-col. commanding 17th regiment Louisiana Volunteers. Report of Major Franklin H. Clack. Head-quarters Confederate Guards Response Battalion, Camp near Corinth, Mississippi, April 10th, 1862. To Brig.-gen. Patton Anderson, Commanding 2d Brigade, Ruggles' Division, 2d Grand Division, Army of the Miss., Camp near Corinth, Miss.: Sir : \u2014 I have the honor to report, that in obedience to your orders about 5 o'clock a. m. of the 6th instant, I drew up my command in column at half distance on the left of the 1 7th regiment Louisiana volunteers, which occupied the right of your brigade, at a point dis tant, as I was informed, about three miles from the enemy's nearest camp, and between Owl creek and Bark road, in McNairy county, Tenn. The position assigned the brigade at first, that of a reserve, to support the 1st and 2d brigades of Gen. Ruggles' division, having been changed, I formed my battalion in line of battle, under your orders, in the same relative position as at first, in the brigade, which"], [27, "official reports of battles. 317 at that time formed the left of Gen. Hardee's line. On arriving at the ridge nearest the enemy's first camp, owing to some accident, the 1 7th regiment Louisiana volunteers became for a time separated from my right, and the 1st Florida and the 9th Texas remained in their position on my left. The order was then given to advance, and I took up a position in a hollow immediately below a hill, on which was a camp of the enemy, and on the slope beyond which they had a battery in position. The charge was made by my bat- talion, supported on my right by a portion of a regiment which I was informed constituted a part of Gen. Polk's command. The enemy were being driven back with much effort, and stubbornly resisting, when some one in the force on the right gave the order to fall back, and, simultaneously, that force came rushing back, bear- ing my own men with them. I drew off my force to the hollow, from which we had charged. The second charge was successful, and we pursued the enemy through that and another camp, and were brought to a stand by discovering a considerable force of the enemy posted in a thick wood on a slope to our left. Having been separated from you, I consulted with Lieut.-col. Jones, of the 1 7th Louisiana, who, I found, had joined me on my left, and with Gen. Russell, and we deemed it advisable to pause. You then placed the brigade in line, and, if I am not mistaken in localities, led us to the successful attack of a camp on the left of our line. From this time, sir, until the close of the day, I am unable to describe the various localities in which you led us to the attack. We made several other successful charges, being ordered from one part of the field to others, where our services were most needed. Having bivouacked that night in a camp of the enemy, on the succeeding morning, at 5 a. m., in obedience to your orders, I formed my line, and we were placed as a reserve. Being ordered to the left, in advance, with the artillery on our left, the enemy were discovered in position, in our front, protected by log breastworks ; the order was given to charge, which was executed, and the enemy driven from their position. It was then discovered that they had a camp on the hill behind their breastworks, and after our flag had been planted in their camp, a battery, placed on a slope about 500 yards to our left, opened on us, and you ordered us to fall back to the ravine, whence we had cham-ed. The enemy still having our range, you ordered a further retiring beyond range. From this, to our final actions with the brigade, my ignorance of the geographical details of the localities of the battle-ground, and the numerous charges and changes made in our position, prevent my giving any specific details of operations,"], [28, "318 official reports of battles. except that I remember we were kept busy in moving and in at tack. Having arrived at that camp of the enemy on the lest of the large parade ground, you ordered an advance, to dislodge the enemy occupying a wood skirting the rear of this camp. I understood we were ordered to support an attack, to be made by quite a large force on our right, which I did not perceive, however. Having ad vanced, and engaged the enemy, it becoming apparent they were in great force, you ordered us to fall back. From this time I lost sight of you, and my command became somewhat scattered. I suc ceeded, however, in rallying them on the brow of the hill overlook ing the enemy's camps, and under the personal instructions of Gen. Beauregard, formed line of battle, incorporating in my command some fragments of the 9th Texas and 1st Florida. After futile en deavors on the part of several officers, myself among the number, to rally a sufficent number to renew the attack, I awaited orders. None came, and perceiving the two lines that were drawn up, os tensibly to support the advance of which we formed the right, diminishing by stragglers, and finally filing off, I drew off my com mand, flanking and filing to the right, immediately after troops on my left ; some few in number had broken from the line and filed to the left. Not having received any specific instructions, or orders, I led my command to my last encampment at this place. I regret, sir, that the irregular course of the engagement of the 6th and 7th instant renders it difficult for me to be specific, a difficulty njade almost absolute by the rapidity with which you changed the posi tions of your brigade, and the many points you were called on to attack, for while your command was intended as a reserve, I believe it never once occupied that position, or that of a support, or any other force than that of an attacking force. I cannot close this feeble report, sir, without calling your attention to a matter which my sense of duty impels me to mention, the strong immediate neces sity for the strictest moral and severe discipline. Had we but had this discipline, there would not now be an enemy's foot pressing the soil in the vicinity of our late battle. I am convinced that nothing but the daring courage exhibited by a large portion of our force enabled us to sustain ourselves. Deeming it a duty, also, to suggest any thing that, in my opinion, may tend to correct what I regard an evil, I must say that the volunteering system, as far as my experi ence goes, is an evil, the greater,, in an inverse ratio, as is the term of service short. Be assured, general, that we never can cope suc cessfully with our foe unless we discipline our forces, and that the discipline necessary should be perfect. Our military organization"], [29, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 319 can never be obtained under the volunteer system. We must have recourse to drafting or conscript. The scenes, sir, we both wit nessed on the 6th and 7th instant, when stragglers would fall from their own lines, and retiring under cover of another line, fire reck lessly to the front, must convince you of the justness of my remarks. Not in this alone, but the disorders resulting from want of proper discipline were numberless; the most fatal to the consummation of a success so gallantly begun, being the lawless spirit of plunder and pillage so recklessly indulgedain. While our foe throws down all the barriers of constitutional liberty in bis career of oppression and invasion, we are fatally lacking in the most important element of resistance, not that I would imitate his example, but our laws are amply sufficient to correct the evil, did we but enforce them. I regret to be compelled to report quite a severe loss in my com mand. It is as follows: five killed on the field five mortally wounded, one dangerously wounded, twenty severely wounded, fourteen slightly wounded, and one missing ; total casualties, forty five. My actual force in the field, was one hundred and forty-four muskets, and nine officers. To the gallant bearing of my officers, I cannot bear too high a tribute ; ever present until disabled, they rendered most efficient service. To Assistant Quarter-master Lieut. Monheimer, is due great credit for the efficient manner in which he kept the battalion supplied with ammunition and took off the wounded. In the death of 1st Lieut. Macbeth, of company B, I lost a most valuable officer, and his country a noble and brave son. Capt. Macmurdo, after conducting his company through both days, with singular coolness and bravery, was disabled in the last charge by a severe contusion in the breast by a spent ball. Capt. Fowler and Lieuts. Hyatt and Hardie were severely wounded while gallantly discharging their duty. Adjutant Price and Lieuts. Bouner and Browne rendered very efficient service. From the report of Capt. Macmurdo, of company A, I desire to call your attention to the gallant bearing of privates Harris and North, of his company, who, after the color-sergeant was wounded, bore the flag of the battalion gallantly in the front until severely wounded. Lieut. Price, in command of company B., mentions, with much ap probation, the brave conduct of color-sergeant Doyle and private Cuff, of that company. In conclusion, sir, when I reflect, that this command had never been under fire before, that they were called out to meet the enemy after a most fatiguing march, and that they were moved from one"], [30, "320 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. portion of the field to another very rapidly during both days, I will not be thought to express myself too strongly, when I say that they did their duty, as officers and men, gallantly, and I may well say efficiently. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, Your obedient servant, FRANKIN H. CLACK, Major Confederate Guards Response Battalion. Report of Col. Augustus Reichard, commanding Twen- tieth regiment Louisiana Volunteers. Head-quarters, 20th Regiment Louisiana Volunteers, Camp near Corinth, April 11, 1862. Capt. W. G. Booth, A. A. A. General 2d Brigade : Sir : \u2014 I beg leave to submit the following report in relation to the participation of my regiment in the battle of Shiloh, on the 6th and 7th instants : I took into the field three field, five staff, and twenty-seven com pany officers, with 472 rank and file, with whom, according to the disposition made, I occupied the extreme left of the brigade, some what in rear of the right of Col. Pond's brigade. Soon after the commencement of the battle, the brigade moved forward, and, as we approached the enemy, I was ordered to file off by the left, in the execution of which movement, the regiment pass ing through a dense undergrowth, in which it was impossible to see five paces ahead, I suddenly was informed that we were separated from the balance of the brigade. Just at the moment, when I was retracing my steps to rejoin the brigade, a Tennessee regiment, in full retreat, broke right through my line, causing much disorder. The regiment, however, soon rallied, regained its position, and gallantly fought during the whole day, side by side with the other regiments of the brigade. At the last charge, towards evening, when my regiment was severely cut up by a cross fire from rifle-pits and a battery, pouring fourth a hail storm of canister, my regiment was separated from the rest of the brigade, and, as night set in, I led the remnants of the regiment to our hospital, where we bivouacked. The next morning, having collected many of my men who bad"], [31, "321 official reports of battles. been scattered about, I put the regiment in movement, and, adding whatever stragglers I could gather on the road, reported to Gen. Beauregard for orders. He ordered me to reinforce Gen. Breckin ridge, who found himself hard pressed on our lest ; and, after re porting to him, took immediate part in the fight that was going on before us. The enemy having fallen back, Gen. Breckinridge or dered me to go to the support of a battery which had taken po sition to our right beyond an open field, sweeping an open passage, leading, I suppose, to the river. The enemy in front having been dislodged, and there being no further necessity to remain with the battery, I moved towards the left where the fight was hardest. On the way I met Gen. Breckinridge, and, asking for further orders, he directed me to join Gen. Cheatham's brigade, but, in case I should not be able to find him, to join any other brigade where I could make myself most useful. Not finding Gen. Cheatham's bri gade, and meeting my own commander, Gen. J. Patton Anderson, I of course joined his brigade, and kept up fighting under his com mand until the order for retreat was issued. My regiment fought this their first battle with the utmost bra very, and where, with very few exceptions, almost every one faith fully performed his duty, it is almost out of place to make distinc tions. I cannot, however, omit to mention 1st Lieut. Bishop, of company A, who, throughout both days, made himself conspicuous for his gallantry, and the cool, collected manner in which he was unremittedly occupied to keep his company well in hand. Lieut. col. Boyd was slightly wounded early in the first day's fight, but remained at his post until that evening. Major Von Zinker bravely led several attacks with the colors in his hand, but was disabled early on the second day by the fall of his horse, which was killed under him. The color-bearer, Sergeant Hoffmann, paid, with his life, the gallant manner in which he carried the colors always into the thickest of the fight. The annexed statement, A, gives a revised account of the killed, wounded, and missing. I remain, sir, your most obedient servant, AUGUSTUS REICHARD, Col. commanding 20th regiment La. Vols. 21"], [32, "322 official reports of battles. Report of Capt. W. G. Poole. Head-Quarters, Florida Battalion, April 12th, 1862. To Gen. Patton Anderson, Brig.-gen., commanding 2d Brigade, Ruggles' Division: General: \u2014 In accordance with your circular of the 11th of this month, I have the honor to make the following report : In the first place, it becomes a painful duty to record the fall of Major McDonald, being seriously wounded early in the action of the 6th, whereupon the command immediately devolved upon me. Pressing forward, we gained the valley opposite and close to the first camp of the enemy, and in the first charge lost several of my command in killed and wounded. I then joined the brigade at the second camp, and was ordered forward to support a portion of our advance columns. The advance having fallen back, placed us in front, where for some time we were exposed to a galling fire from the enemy. It was at this time that our battalion suffered most. 1st Lieut. L. M. Anderson, of company A (commanding), was shot in the forehead and instantly killed, and the company being without a commander, I ordered 2d Lieut. Stevens, of com pany B, to the command. In a very few minutes he was also se verely wounded. I then ordered 1st Lieut. Turner, of company C, to take command. . Capt. Means and 1st Lieut. Miller, of company B, and 2d Lieut. Turner, of company C, and Lieut. Hull, command ing company I, (since dead), were wounded. Several non-commis sioned officers and privates were also killed and wounded while under this fire. I then withdrew the battalion (by order) to the protection of a section of the Washington Artillery battery. Forming with the brigade, we again advanced and assisted in rout ing a portion of the enemy's forces that had taken position in an encampment on our left. My command then, with a portion of the brigade, proceeded forward as far as within range of the heavy guns on the Tennessee river, where we were for some time exposed to the enemy's shells. One or two of my command were either killed or mortally wounded while under this fire. We then fell back to the enemy's camp, and bivouacked during the night. On the morning of the 7th, being too hoarse to take command of the bat talion, I turned it over to Capt. W. C.

W. G. POOLE, Senior Captain, commanding Florida Battalion. Report of Captain Hodgson. Head-quarters 5th Company, Battalion Washington Artillery. Camp Moore, Corinth, Miss., April 9, 1862. To Brig.-gen. Patton Anderson, Commanding 2d brigade, Ruggles' Division, Army 3Iiss.,: General': In accordance with \" usage,\" I hereby report to you, the \" action \" of my battery in the battle of the 6th and 7th inst. My battery, consisting of 2 6-pounder smooth bore guns, 2 6-poun der rifled guns, and 2 12 pounder howitzers \u2014 total, 6 pieces fully equipped, with ammunition, horses, and men, entered the field just in the rear of the 20th Louisiana regiment (the right regiment of your brigade), on Sunday morning, the 6th inst., on the hill, over looking, from the south-west, the encampment of the enemy, imme diately to th'e front of it, and to the northeast, being the first camp attacked and taken by an army. At 7 ojclock a. m., we opened fire on their camp, with our full battery of six guns, firing shell and spherical case shot, soon silenc ing one of their batteries, and filling the enemy with consternation. After firing some forty (40) rounds thus, we were directed by Gen. RHggles to shell a camp immediately upon the left of the one just mentioned, and in which there was a battery, from which the shot and shell were thrown on all sides of us. With two howitzers, and two rifled guns, under Lieuts. Slocumb and Vaughn, assisted by two pieces from Capt. Sharp's battery, we soon silenced their guns, and had the extreme gratification of seeing our brave and gallant troops charge through these two camps, running the enemy before them at the point of the bayonet. At this point, I lost your command, and, on the order of Gen. Ruggles, to go where I heard the most firing, I passed over the first camp captured, through a third, and on to a fourth, in which your troops were doing sad havoc to the enemy. I formed in battery on your extreme lest, in the avenue of the camp, and commenced firing"], [34, "324 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. with canister from four (4) guns, into the tents of the enemy, only some 50 yards off. It was at this point I suffered most. The skir mishers of tbe enemy, lying in their tents, only a stone's throw from us, cut holes through their tents near the ground, and with \" white powder\" or some preparation which discharged their arms without report, played a deadly fire in among my cannoniers, killing three men, wounding 7 or 8, besides killing some of my most valuable horses, mine among the rest. As soon as we were well formed in battery, and got well to work, we saw them creeping from their tents and making for the woods, and immediately afterwards saw your column charge the whole of them in ambush, and put them to flisrht. A visit through that portion of their camp, at a subsequent hour, satisfied me, from the number of the dead and the nature of their wounds, that my battery had done its duty. Losing you again, at this point, on account of the heavy brushwood through which you charged, I was requested by Gen. Trudeau to plant two guns further down the avenue, say about two hundred yards off, to shell a fifth camp, further on, which I did, and after firing a dozen or more shell, had the satisfaction of seeing the cavalry charge the camp, putting the enemy to flight, killing many, and capturing many wounded prisoners. Being again without a commanding-general, and not knowing your exact position, I received and executed orders from Gen. Hardee, and his aid, Col. Kearney, also, from Col. Chisholm, of Gen. Beauregard's staff, and, in fact, from other aids, whose names I do not know, going to points threatened and exposed, and where firing was continual, rendering cheerfully all the assistance I could with my battery, and reduced in men and horses, all fatigued and hungry. At about 2 o'clock p. m., at the instance of Gen. Hardee, I opened from the 5th camp we had entered, fired upon a sixth camp, due north \u2014 silencing the battery and driving the enemy from their tents ; \u2014 -said portion of the army of the enemy were charged, and their battery captured, afterwards lost again, by the Guard Orleans and other troops on our left, under Col. Preston Pond, Jr. This was about the last firing of my battery on the sixth instant. Tak ing the main road to Pittsburg landing, we followed on the heels of our men, after a retreating and badly whipped army, until with in three-fourths of a mile of the Tennessee river, when the enemy began to shell the woods from their gunboats. Gen. Ruggles or dered us back to the enemy's camp, where we bivouacked for the night."], [35, "325 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. I received orders, on the morning of the 7th, at about 5 and a half o'clock, to follow your command with my battery, and at 6 o'clock, being ready to move, could not ascertain your position \u2014 so took position on the extreme right of our army, supported by the Crescent regiment, of Col. Pond's brigade in our rear, and an Ar kansas regiment on my front, and I think the 21st Tennessee regi ment on my left flank, all under Gen. Hardee, or, in fact, he seemed to be the master spirit, giving all orders and seeing that they were properly executed. At about 9 o'clock, Gen. Breckinridge's com mand on our extreme front had pushed the enemy up and on to within several hundred yards of our front, when we opened fire with shell and shot with our full battery. After firing some 70 rounds, we took position further on, just on the edge of the open space ahead, and with our full battery, assisted by two pieces of McClung's battery, we poured some 60 rounds into the enemy, who continued to advance upon us until within some 20 yards of us, when Col. Marshall J. Smith, of the Crescent regiment, gallantly came to our rescue \u2014 charging the enemy at the point of the bay onet, putting them to flight and saving our three extreme right pieces, which would have been captured but for them. It was at this point I again met with severe losses. Lieut. Slo cumb, Serg't Green, several privates, and many horses fell at this point, either killed or badly wounded. Aster the enemy had retreated well in the woods, I had my guns limbered and taken from the field. My men broken down, my horses nearly all slain, ammunition out, and sponges all broken and gone, I was in the act of making repairs, and preparing for another attack, when I was ordered by Gen. Beauregard to retire, in order, to Monterey, which I did that evening \u2014 and afterwards to this point, arriving last evening, with my battery all complete, with the exception of three caissons, a battery wagon, and forge, which I had to abandon on the road for want of fresh horses to draw them in. At the request of Gen. Beauregard, I detailed from my command twelve men under a non-commissioned officer, to remain and act with Capt. Byrne's (or Burns') battery on a prominent hill on the Pea Ridge road, overlooking the battle-field, to cover the retire ment of our army. They all came in to-day, safe and sound. We captured two stand of United States colors, which were handed over to Gen. Beauregard. We also captured several U. S. horses and mules, some of which we have now, others we have lost.

M., the following reports of the movements of the third brigade of his division, on Sunday and Monday, the 6th and 7th of April, 1862 : On the morning of the 6th, at daylight, the brigade was formed in the order of battle with columns doubled on the center at battal ion distance, the right resting on the left of Gen. Anderson's brig ade, with the left extended towards Owl creek, and covering the left of Gen. Hardee's line, about five hundred yards to the rear. At about eight o'clock an order was received from Gen. Ruggles to throw one regiment with one section of guns to the left towards Owl creek. In compliance with this order, Col. Looney's regi ment, 38th Tennessee, and one section of Capt. Ketchum's battery,"], [38, "328 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. were thrown about three-quarters of a mile to the lest, and the po sition assigned to them, covered on the front and flank with cavalry skirmishers. These dispositions were not quite completed, when an order was received from Gen. Ruggles to advance the whole of his line. The brigade moved forward, in double columns, over very difficult ground, endeavoring to preserve the proper interval between itself and Gen. Anderson's brigade, and, at the same time, to guard the flank of the line on Owl creek. After advancing some six hun dred yards, the brigade was halted near some small houses, with a large field on the left, and also with a similar field in front. Enemy's skirmishers being seen towards Owl creek, Col. Looney's regiment, with a section of Capt. Ketchum's battery, were again sent to the left to the distance of three-quarters of a mile and posted to com mand the Owl creek road. Information being received from Col. Looney that the enemy were ambushed in his front, the Crescent regiment, under Col. M. J. Smith, was detached to report to Col. Looney, and to support him. Shortly after, an order came from Gen. Hardee for the lest to advance. In resj>onse to this order, the 16th and 18th Louisiana Volunteers, and a battalion Orleans Guards, advanced until they reached the line occupied by the second brig ade, commanded by Gen. Anderson, which brigade was engaging the enamy in one of his camps, and which he was stubbornly con testing. This camp having been carried, the whole line advanced through a narrow strip of woods and across a wide field until we reached the main and last camp of the enemy, which was not occupied \u2014 this camp having, apparently, been abandoned without a contest, as there were no evidences of any struggle having taken place there. . As we approached this camp, a few of the enemy were seen on our left, who fired a few shots at us, but who were soon dis persed by one shot from Capt. Ketchum's battery. When we en tered the edge of the field in which this main camp was situated, we perceived the enemy in full retreat. The left of the brigade was immediately thrown forward, and the whole put in motion, at double-quick, to cut him off; and the movement would, without doubt, have been successful, but when nearly across the field a dreadful fire was received from our own forces on the right, killing and wounding several of the 18th regiment Louisiana Volunteers, under the command of Col. Monton. Not knowing at first from whence the fire was directed, and fearing that I might have passed some of the enemy's forces, the brigade was halted and thrown back about one hundred yards to the edge of the woods. Whet"], [39, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 329 our troops on the right advanced across the opening, this brigade ad vanced on the same line, passed through the main camp, and through a very deep ravine beyond it. At this time we were moving a little in advance of the front line, which was commanded by Gen. Har dee. Upon reaching the crest of the hill the command encountered a heavy fire of grape at a distance of about four hundred yards. The brigade was thrown back under the cover of the hill, and Capt. Ketchum's battery placed in position on the hills to the rear to silence the enemy's battery and disorganize its infantry supports. While waiting for Capt. Ketchum's battery to get into position, I reconnoitered and discovered the enemy posted in considerable numbers in a camp some two or three hundred yards to our front and left, and in a similar camp immediately to my front and right, from which the fire of the battery had been received and was still continued. At this time, about 4 p. m., Col. Ferguson brought peremptory orders to me to charge the battery with my brigade. Col. Ferguson was informed that there was a battery immediately in front, and said he would inform Gen. HardSe, and report to me. Immediately after Col. Ferguson lest me, the Washington Artillery was placed in battery to the right of the enemy's main camp, and made an effort to silence the enemy's battery in my front, but failed to do so. By orders, said by Col. Ferguson to be the orders of Gen. Hardee, my brigade was filed left in front up a deep ravine in a direction flanking the enemy's battery, and, while the head of column was some three hundred yards in front of the battery, by the direction of Col. Ferguson, speaking as for Gen. Hardee, I or dered the charge. This brought my troops under the tire of the enemy's battery and three of his regiments in an oblique column, instead of line of battle, aud the fire became so destructive that tbe troops recoiled under it. Tbe 18th Louisiana regiment suffered severely in this charge, also the Orleans Guards; the 16th Louisiana, less than either, being on the right, and, consequently, in what might be called the rear of the column. As my troops were advancing to this charge, we again received a severe fire from our own troops on the right, which, added to the fire of the enemy, almost disorganized the com mand. Iu order to reform, we were compelled to fall back about one hundred and fifty yards to the enemy's main camp, where we were rejoined by Col. Looney, with his regiment, he having re ceived orders to leave his position on Owl creek road, and unite with the brigade. The camp on my right was subsequently abandoned by the"], [40, "330 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. enemy and occupied by our troops \u2014 the enemy withdrawing his battery. I heard sharp firing from my right on that camp in which the 38th Tennessee was engaged before it united with the brigade. The camp to my left continued to be occupied in considerable force, and as the duty of guarding the left was placed in my hands, and being separated about a quarter of a mile from the forces immedi ately on my right, I felt that any rash or inconsiderate advance or engagement of our troops might result in the exposure of my left and rear, and, therefore, made no attack on it. The charge made on the enemy's battery, by which the 18th regiment suffered so severely, was not in accordance with my judgment. I did it reluc tantly, and in obedience to peremptory orders. If left to myself, I had the means of taking it, and would have taken it in twenty minutes after my battery had been brought into action. There was a wide gap between my left and Owl creek. I was alone with my brigade, without any thing to support my own rear on the left of the general line, and, therefore, felt it my duty to take every step with extreme caution, and to keep my force in hand to hold Owl creek against any and every contingency. In this I was act ing in strict accordance with the plan of battle communicated to * me by Gen. Bragg, on the evening of the 5th instant, and to this plan I rigidly adhered, no advice having reached me of change of plan. At night, after, the battle ceased, acting in obedience to orders received through the day from a great variety of sources, I formed my infantry line considerably in advance of our general front. I immediately fell back to this line, resting my right on the main camp of the enemy, and extending my left to Owl creek, es tablishing police guards round each regiment, with picket in rear and front, and to the left across Owl creek. My ranks were then opened, and the men caused to lie down on their arms. There was some picket firing during the night, but nothing important de veloped itself. I would mention that on Sunday evening, just after the firing ceased, I heard cheering on the river below me, evidently proceeding from a large force, to which my men responded, think ing it to be from their friends, and, when the cheering ceased, a band played the air of \" Hail Columbia\" from a boat that was as cending the river. My bivouac on Sunday night was within a mile of the river, and within four hundred yards of the enemy's lines. During the night our main line was thrown back about three-quarters of a mile with out the movement being communicated to me. On Monday morn ing, at daylight, a sharp skirmish took place between pickets, and"], [41, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 331 was immediately followed by a sharp engagement between my lines and those of the enemy. A battery was also opened against my right at a range of about four hundred yards. At this time I discovered that our main line had fallen back, and that my brigade was alone in the presence of the enemy, who was in strong force. I regarded the position as perilous, and should, no doubt, have been cut off or cut to pieces, but for the cool, intrepid, and gallant conduct of Capt. Ketchum, who brought his battery into position on my right, and maintainefl a spirited and effective fire against the enemy within infantry range, while my regiments were withdrawn under the lead of their respective commanders. I cannot speak too highly of the coolness and intrepidity of Col. Monton, Major Gober, Col. Looney, and Capt. Morton, manifested by the orderly manner in which they withdrew their respective com mands over the most difficult ground, and united themselves, with out disaster, with the main line. The infantry movement left Capt. Ketchum's battery exposed, but, as the whole was in great peril, I thought it better to sacrifice the pieces than the regiments, if any thing had to be lost. Capt. Ketchum, however, withdrew, covered by the regiment of Texas Rangers, exhibiting throughout the whole a degree of skill and courage, which mark him as an artillery officer of the highest merit. In fact, the safety of my command is due to him. Upon reaching the main line, the lest of which was at the enemy's first camp on the Savannah road, I was ordered by Gen. Ruggles to form on the extreme left, and rest my left on Owl creek. While proceeding to execute this order, I was ordered to move by the rear of the main line to support the extreme right of Gen. Har dee's line. I was again ordered by Gen. Beauregard to advance and occupy the crest of a ridge in the edge of an old field. My line was just formed in this position, when Gen. Polk ordered me forward to support his line. While moving to the support of Gen. Polk, an order reached me from Gen. Beauregard to report to him, with my command, at his head-quarters. This was on the extreme left, where my brigade became engaged in the fight which continued until the contest between the armies finally ceased. As Gen. Rug gles was present at this point, no report of particulars is necessary. My command was kept once in hand through the occurrences of both days, and brought off the field in as good order as it entered it under my immediate command. Col. Monton was wounded in the fight at the church, and Major was wounded in the knee, in the charge on the enemy's battery. The Crescent regiment was not seen by me during the engage-"], [42, "332 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. ment, but I received information, from various sources, that it wag in the fight on the right, and served with marked gallantry and effect.

Leaving this camp at about 3 p. m., On the 3d, I reached the line of battle on the 5th, at about 5 p. m. Early on the 6th, I was ordered to take position, facing tbe enemy in an eligible location, and await the arrival of the balance of the brigade. I advanced opposite to the enemy's camp, and halted in a field about 400 yards distant therefrom. My skirmishers ascended the slope of the hill, and exchanged shots with the enemy for about fifteen minutes, when the latter withdrew. I then pushed forward, and perceived about 500 of the enemy in retreat. Anxious to intercept them, I rushed on at double-quick, but unfortunately, our troops on the right, mistook us for the enemy, owing, I presume, to the blue uni form of a large number of my men, and opened on us with cannon and musket. This impeded my progress and brought me to a halt, until a staff officer signalled to our troops to cease firing. On the cessation of the firing, I moved on to the camp and captured 29 prisoners, who were placed in charge of Lieut. W. Prescott, com pany K, who transferred them to Col. Eli S. Shorter, 18th Alabama, on receipt. But for this unfortunate occurrence, the probability is, I would have captured the whole number of the enemy that was fleeing. Here one man was killed, and Capt. Huntington, company H, and three privates, were wounded by the fire of our friends. Thence we moved onward to a deep ravine under cover from the enemy's shells. Notwithstanding, company F had one private killed arfd another wounded. Thence, about 4 p. m., I moved by the left flank through the con tinuation of the same ravine, with the view of charging the battery which had been continuously firing on us. Before reaching a proper position, and while directly in front of the battery, distant from it about six or seven hundred yards, I received peremptory orders to move up the hill and charge the battery. The order was instantly obeyed. About four hundred yards from the battery, my line be came entirely uncovered, and thence my regiment rushed forward alone at double-quick, towards the battery, being all the time ex posed to an incessant fire, both from the battery and its supports. At about sixty or seventy yards from the battery, which then com menced moving from its position and began to retreat, the enemy had opposed to my regiment, then numbering about five hundred, three regiments of infantry, two of which kept up an incessant cross fire on my troops, and the third, as soon as unmasked by the bat tery, also opened upon us. Thus exposed, my men falling at every"], [44, "334 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. step, being unsupported, and unable to accomplish the capture of tbe battery, or the repulse of the enemy, I was compelled to retire, leaving my dead and wounded on the field. Here two hundred and seven officers and men fell either dead or wounded, and Lieut. col. Roman and I had our horses shot under us. I must add, that, in my opinion, the order to charge the battery was prematurely given ; that is, before our troops had taken proper position to act effectually and support one another, otherwise, I am inclined to believe the battery would have been captured. After rallying the regiment, I moved off to the left, and took posstion opposite the enemy's lines, distant about three hundred yards, which were covered by infantry and artillery. Throwing out pickets to protect my line, I bivouacked for the night. By this time, my men were completely exhausted, as they had neither slept nor eaten since the evening of the 4th, and had been continually on the march. On the night of the 6th, it rained almost constantly, and being without cover, by the morning of the 7th they were thoroughly drenched and worn out from lack of food and rest. At about half-past 6 on the 7th, the enemy, in large force, opened on us with cannon and musket. My troops being in full view from the battery, I fell back under cover from their shells. While in this position, orders were received at about 8 a. m. to move to the right of the line. From this hour, until about half-past 1 p. m., we were con stantly marching and countermarching ; the \" Orleans Guards \" in the meantime, having been attached to my command. About 2 p. m., we were ordered to move on the enemy, which was done'without energy or life, by the troops, twice in succession, notwithstanding the noble and daring efforts of Gens. Beauregard and Brago- to lead them on in the face of the enemy. The fact is, the men were com pletely exhausted from inanition and physical fatigue ; many drop ping in the attempt to move ownward. Here I was wounded in the face, and three privates remained on the field, either killed or wounded. I was then compelled by reason of my wound to abandon the field. Thence, by order, my troops fell back, about half past 3 p. m., to a line a little beyond Shiloh church, and about half-past 4 p. m., they moved by the left flank to the rear, and reached Corinth on the 8th, at about 3 p. m., as I have been informed by the lieut.-col. then in command. A complete field return has already been forwarded, and I beg leave to call attention to the number of killed and wounded officers! Allow me to add further, that my report of this morning, exhibits"], [45, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 335 only ten officers for duty, viz. : One captain, four first lieutenants, and five second lieutenants.

M., Near Corinth, April 9th, 1862. Capt. J. B. Cumming, Assistant Adjutant-general : Sir : \u2014 Inclosed, I have the honor to submit to you a report of the casualties that occurred to my regiment in the great historic battle at Shiloh Church, on Sunday, the 6th instant. The number of non-commissioned officers and privates, actually engaged in the first battle, was only four hundred and thirteen. During this long continued fight of about one hour and upwards, mj^men nearly ex hausted the fifty rounds of cartridges that had previously been dis tributed to them. A considerable number of the men had none whatever lest. By order of Gen. Jackson, after the enemy had been routed, and we were advancing, I sent back to the ammuni tion train and procured a new supply. The regiment was actively engaged in all the battles during that day in which the brigade participated. Our loss was very heavy, to wit: twenty killed, eighty wounded, and twenty missing. Most of those classed among the missing, doubtless were taken prisoners by the enemy, as they were with Dr. Barnett, our surgeon, who was captured on Monday, while attending to the wounded. It is reported to me on good authority, that the enemy fired on Dr. Barnett and his party, while under the yellow flag, and when the surgeon was actually engaged in dressing the wounds of one of the enemy. The officers (with but one exception) and the men of the regi ment conducted themselves throughout the several engagements with much gallantry and spirit. Lieut. Rogers, who was in com mand of company B, abandoned his company twice, and wholly dis-"], [46, "336 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. appeared from the field. He is here now in arrest, and proper charges will be filed against him. Lieut.-col. Holtzclaw was dan gerously wounded in the first engagement, while he was gallantly discharging his duty. Respectfully, &c, ELI S. SHORTER, Colonel 1 8th Alabama Regiment. Report of Colonel R. F. Looney. Regimental Head-quarters, 38th Tenn. Regiment, Camp near Corinth, Miss., April 26, 1862. To Brigadier-General Ruggles, Commanding Division : General : I have the honor to report the service rendered by the 38th Tennessee regiment, in the battle of Shiloh, on the 6th and 7th of April. Early on the morning of the 6th, we were ordered to move rapidly to the left as far as Owl creek, which position was promptly taken by the Crescent and 38th Tennessee regiments and Capt. Ketchum's batr^ry. This position was held until about 11 o'clock a. m., when we were ordered to move to the right. Under this order, at a double-quick, I moved my command in the neighborhood of, and to the right of, Shiloh church, and in front of a battery which was playing upon us. We advanced as we received orders, firing upon the enemy as we advanced. Shortly we approached a camp of the enemy, only an open field intervening. To the right, and in advance of the camp, we discovered the enemy in consider able force. We poured upon him a destructive fire, which caused him soon to begin to retire. Near the camp was a battery, all the while playing upon our forces. I received an order to charge the battery and camp un'der cover of the woods to the right, from Major-gen. Polk, through his son, Capt. Polk. I quickly examined the route as ordered, and saw the camp and battery could be reached, and the order carried out in effect, with but little more risk by moving rapidly through the open field. I ordered the charge, which was promptly and successfully executed, as to the camp and battery, and I suppose at least one thousand prisoners. After I reached the camp, some cavalry and Col. Cummins' Tennes-"], [47, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 337 see regiment came up. We were soon moved farther to the left. Night approached, and we lay down without fire and in the rain, about six hundred yards from the camp of the 77th Illinois, I think. On the morning of the 7th, at daylight, the 3d brigade of your division was drawn up in line of battle. Almost instantly we were fired upon by a battery brought up in the night, within a very short distance, and supported by a large force. I immediately ordered my regiment to fire, and three rounds were delivered at the enemy, with what effect I am unable to say. About this time our own battery in our rear opened, leaving us exposed to the shells of friend and foe, which caused us to take position to the rear of our guns. We were moved quickly from one point to another, to the support of brigade commanders unknown, until about 1 1 o'clock a. m. A short time after this, we were ordered to Shiloh church, in the direction of Pittsburg and near a camp occupied by the enemy. After having been held by Gen. Beauregard for about fifteen minutes, I received an order from him through Gov. Harris, of Ten nessee, to charge the camp and the enemy. My regiment was in the centre. There were, I suppose, two regiments on my right and three on the left. We drove the enemy far beyond his camp, my regiment being far in advance of any other troops, when we were ordered to retire. Three times did they charge the enemy and drive' him from his position at every point. I delivered the last volley at the enemy on Monday, and when we were withdrawn from this part of the field, I found the army drawn up in beautiful order to retire. For a list of the killed, wounded, and missing of my regiment, I refer to a report heretofore furnished. I deem it but just and proper that I should make mention of the gallant bearing of the officers and men of my command. Capt. John C. Carter deserves the highest praise for his great coolness and high courage displayed throughout the entire engage ment. At one time he took the flag, and urging his men forward, rendered me great assistance in moving forward the entire regiment. Capts. Cotler, Hardy, Umphleet, Thrasher, and Mayfield, for their gallant bearing, are entitled to great credit. They discharged their whole duty. Capt. Abington was with his company throughout the first day of the battle, and conducted himself handsomely, but, being in delicate health, was not able to be with his company on the 7th. Lieuts. Koen, March, Green, Hutchinson, Pugh, Chilcut, Ketchum, 22"], [48, "338 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. Loving, Jones, Wait, and Briggs, were at all times at their posts, and their gallantry was worthy of the cause for which they struggled. With but few exceptions, the men did their duty and fought bravely. To Adj. Sanford I am greatly indebted for assistance rendered me throughout the entire engagement, and for his gallant bearing and high courage too many praises cannot be given. Lieut. Haller, though feeble from ill health, was with his company and at his post all the while, and on Monday, in the absence of his captain, gallantly led his men through the fight. Respectfully submitted. R. F. LOONEY, Colonel 38<A Tennessee Regiment. Report of Major Daniel Gober, Commanding 16 th regiment Louisiana Volunteers. Headquarters 16th Louisiana Regiment, Camp near Corinth, Miss., April 26, 1862. To Brig.-gen. Ruggles, \u2022 Commanding Division : General : I respectfully submit the following report of the oper ations of the 16th regiment Louisiana volunteers, in the action at Shiloh, on the 6th and 7th inst., the command of which regiment had devolved upon me, in consequence of the absence, on duty, of Lieut.-col. Mason, and the assignment to Col. Preston Pond, Jr., of the command of the 3d brigade, Gen. Ruggles' division. The extraordinary degree of sickness prevalent in camp, and the absence of company B, lest for guard duty at Corinth, had dimin ished the effective force of the regiment, upon entering the engage ment, to 330 rank and file. The participation of the regiment in the action of Sunday the 6th, though it was frequently exposed to the fire of the enemy during the morning, and was subjected to occasional losses in consequence of its exposure, was not perhaps sufficiently important to justify a special notice of its movements until in the afternoon, when a por tion of the brigade, including the 16th regiment, was ordered to"], [49, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 339 charge one or more of the enemy's batteries, the position and strength of which were evidently unknown or gravely misappre hended. The accomplishment of this order proved to be imprac ticable, and the effort to execute it resulted in our repulse, with considerable loss of killed and wounded. Early in the morning ot the 7th, the battle was renewed by the opening of one of the enemy's batteries upon us from a concealed point in the woods near the grounds upon which the regiment had bivouacked during the previous night. Having retired to a more favorable position, where line of battle was formed, the regiment, in conjunction with the balance of the brigade, was immediately moved forward to meet the advancing columns of the enemy. Becoming thus engaged, at an early hour in tbe morning of the 7th, the regiment continued in action and efficient service until the cessation of hostilities in the afternoon \u2014 the locality of its operations varying but little during the day. The withdrawal of our forces having been ordered at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, the regiment, in exhausted and reduced condition, rejoined the brigade from which it had been temporarily separated, and fell back in the direction of Monterey. For the casualties of the regiment, reference is made to the report of the killed, wounded, and missing, rendered in conformity with order No. \u2014 . DANIEL GOBER, Major commanding 16th La.

Colonel*; \u2014 On Friday, 4th instant, we took up our line of inarch from Monterey, proceeding on the Savannah road, joining our brig ade (Col. Pond's) from whom we had been detached for several days. Nothing of interest oceuring this day, we encamped about five miles out. The next morning, taking our regular position in line, we ad vanced until about 5 p. m., forming in line of battle on the extreme lest, my battery masked by Capt. Jenkins' and Capt. Robins' cavalry companies. There having been some skirmishing in advance and on our right this day, and the enemy's camps nos being more than a"], [50, "340 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. mile in our front, distinctly hearing the tattoo from their different camps, I deemed it prudent to keep my horses in harness all night. At 6 o'clock the next morning (Sunday, 6th) the battle commenced, and we marched steadily to the front in line of battle, holding dif ferent positions as ordered, when an order reached me to place my battery in position, commanding the approach from Owl creek, where it was thought the enemy would attempt to get through on our flank. In this position I was supported by the 38th Tennessee and Crescent regiments. After remaining here in position for some little time, two sections of my battery were ordered to join Col. Pond immediately, who was in advance and on the right. I took charge of this battery of four pieces, leaving the 3d section, 2 pieces, with Lieut. Bond. On arriving where Col. Pond was with the bal ance of his brigade, we commenced an advance movement again through the woods, swamps, and old fields, without any regard to roads. The fighting from 6 a. m. up to this time had been very severe on our right. And until now in an open field we had not experi enced the whistling of tbe enemy's balls. And finding the enemy firing at us from a log-house, with a camp in rear, we fired our first round, which was a shell from a howitzer, at the house, throw ing it immediately in the house. This was about 10 a. m. The enemy leaving, we continued advancing through their deserted camps* until arriving at a camp where they were drawn up in line of battle, Col. Pond ordered me to advance, and shell them out. Moving up my four pieces, I opened on them with spherical case and shell, gradually advancing on the camp by half battery. In a short time, the enemy left their camp in double-quick for the woods on their right. At this moment, an aid from Gen. Hardee rode up, ordering me with my battery to the left, where he reported the enemy in force. On arriving at an eminence on the road command ing a camp on the right of the one we had just shelled, we found the enemy in large force, and the woods in the gorge below, be tween my battery and the camp, filled with sharpshooters. Some Texas rangers, who directed me, lost four or five of their men, from these sharpshooters, while pointing out the enemy's position. I opened fire on the camp, advising the rangers to dismount and enter the woods as skirmishers, which they nobly did, while we ef fectually shelled the camp. I think this was Col. Wharton's regi ment. They supported us gallantly in all our engagements with the enemy the balance of the day. Col. Pond's fine brigade was badly cut up in a charge on a battery in one of these camps, which"], [51, "341 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. I have always thought might have been avoided, had my battery not been withdrawn from the advance I was making on this camp. This same evening, we engaged one of the enemy's batteries, and silenced them after about one and a half hours' firing. Night com ing on, we placed our pieces in battery on their parade ground, adjoining a house on the right of their camp, where a number of our dead and wounded lay. This was at the instance of Col. Fergu son, of Gen. Beauregard's staff. On our lest in the woods was our infantry support, Col. Pond's command. A continual firing from the gunboats was kept up all night. Daylight in the morning found our teams hitched up, our men chilled through by the cold rain, sleeping without tents or much covering, still most manfully and cheerfully did they man their pieces, to reply to a battery which opened on us. In this position we fought them a half hour, and finding they had our range, and our situation being too much ex posed, losing some of our horses, I retired about one hundred yards, to a position which I desired the evening previous. Here we opened our pieces upon them rapidly, and having good command of their battery, succeeded in silencing them in a little more than a half hour's firing, and then opened on a body of infantry which appeared near the position occupied by Col. Pond the evening previous. During this engagement, Col. Wharton's rangers remained on our right in line of battle, witnessing the duello, and ready to charge any effort of the enemy to take my battery. At this time an order came from Col. Pond for me to fall back immediately, he being some distance in our rear. Limbering up, we retired, coming again into battery wherever we could be of service, engaging batteries and bodies of infantry at different points. And while engaged with a battery, we found Lieut. Bond with his section doing good execu tion a short distance to our right. We now came under Gen. Bragg's immediate orders, and our infantry were being hard pressed by the enemy. Advancing the battery in a gallop on a road bring ing us on the enemy 's left, we came into battery, discharging canister from our six pieces at. a distance of forty or fifty yards, checking his advance, and driving them back in the thicket, our troops rallying again. We remained in this position, using canister freely, until recalled by Gen. Bragg to some other position. We were joined here by an officer with one piece and three or four cannoniers, who asked permission to join my battery, so that we had seven pieces in position. In this fight we. lost one man and several wounded. One of our pieces got disabled here. The splinter bar broken, and the piece up to the hubs in mud, it was impossible"], [52, "342 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. to get it out. The firing from this time up to the close of the fight was unusually severe from musketry, and also artillery, in which we were constantly engaged, Gen. Bragg remaining with the bat tery up to the last moment of the fight, and aster our infantry had withdrawn from the field, he ordered me to withdraw by sections, in good order, covering the retreat, and taking position for any ad vance of the enemy. We encamped on the road that night, and made Corinth next evening, 8th instant, as ordered. My first section, commanded by First Lieut. Garrity, was man aged with remarkable coolness and ability, prompt in executing all orders, and firing with marked precision. The gunner to his how itzer, Corporal Ingalls, did great credit to himself in this respect. His pieces are brought back in good order. Second Lieut. Bond, 3d section, behaved gallantly when with me on Monday, which was our most severe fighting, and when detached from me on Sunday and part of Monday, the most flattering account of his section is given by those whom he was with. His guns are back in good order. Third Lieut. Carroll, 2d section, also behaved gallantly, cheering his men through the thickest of the fight. His section lost one piece and two caissons, which was unavoidable. To mention cases of individual merit might be most appropriately made, and could not be done without naming the whole command, with two or three exceptions. My loss in killed, 1 ; wounded, 12.

Head-quarters Crescent Regiment, Third Brigade, Ruggles' Division, Camp McPheeters', April 14, 1862. To Col. Preston Pond, Jr., Commanding 3d Brigade, Ruggles' Division, dc. : Colonel : I submit, herewith, a report of the operations of my regiment on the 6th and 7th instant, in the battle of Shiloh, near Pittsburg. In obedience to your order, on the morning of the 6th, I took position with my regiment on the right of Col. Looney's 38th Ten- nessee regiment, the left of the latter resting on Owl creek, to guard the road leading to the enemy's camp, and to prevent their turning our left, supported by two pieces from Ketchum's battery, com- manded by Lieut. Philip Bond. We remained in this position until about 1 1-2 o'clock, p. m., when we received orders through Col. Beard, aid to Gen. Bragg, to come immediately to the front. We moved both regiments by the right flank rapidly forward, and to the right. My own, throwing off their blankets and all incurnbran- ces, to facilitate their movements, passed through the enemy's camps, which appeared to have been the scene of severe conflict, towards the heavy firing in front, passing by the position occupied by Gen. Beauregard, who ordered us to \" go forward and drive the enemy into Tennessee.\" Advancing about three hundred yards further, through open woods, raked by shell from the enemy's bat- teries, we came up with Gens. Polk, Ruggles, and Anderson. The enemy's battery, sustained by sharpshooters, occupied a hill to the right of an open field, which contained a house, a cotton pen, some cotton bales, &c, behind which the sharpshooters were posted in considerable force. After consultation, Gen. Polk directed Gen. Anderson to the right, and Looney's and my regiment to the left. I found the fire so heavy from the battery and sharpshooters, that in my judgment, it became prudent to drive them from this strong- hold, before feeling to the left, which we did by a charge, driving them towards their battery and from the thicket in front of it. The -two pieces of Ketchum's battery came up and were assigned posit- ion by me. Lieut. Bond promptly responded to the heavy fire from the enemy's battery, and by his coolness and precision, in a short time succeeded in silencing them. I then filed my regiment around to the right through a heavy thicket, passing between two"], [54, "344 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. of our regiments, of what State, I am unable to say, and advancing under Jhe orders of Gen. Polk, took position in front of the ene my, who, retreating, had taken position behind fences and houses, to secure themselves from the fire of our forces, who were press ing them from the front. Our flank fire caused them to break and run to their quarters, where we opened a heavy fire upon them, and filing again to a more advanced position, surrounded them, when the surrender of a large number took place. I myself received the swords of many of them, among whom were Col. Morton, 23d Mo., and Capt. McMichael, Acting Adj.-gen. to Gen. Smith. Gen. Prentiss surrendered on the same spot, some fifteen minutes after, not to me, because I was engaged in preventing the escape of those already prisoners, but, I am told, to some private of Col. Freeman's Tennessee regiment ! That my regiment was in advance of the others at the surrender, and that I was ordered to receive the sur render by Gen. Polk, there is no room for doubt. A flag was surrendered at the same time, but being engaged in advancing on the enemy, I lost sight of it. We also captured at this place a fine bronze 18-pound howitzer. In the several charges incident to the final surrender of this camp, we had several brave men killed, and many wounded. The enemy again formed line of battle in the woods between tbe camp and Pittsburg, and we formed behind the batteries placed to oppose them, and after being shelled for some little time, the enemy broke, retreating towards Pittsburg. It is reported that the white flag was raised at this time, which was not so, as the stars and stripes were plainly visible. After their retreat, the gunboats opened a most destructive fire, which we endured for some time, not being able to reply, and under or ders, we retired in good order from the point gained, and took up our quarters for the night in one of the enemy's encampments. I received orders from Gen. Beauregard to be prepared for action at 6 o'clock a. m. the next morning, the 7th inst., and to move to wards the Bark road. When near Gen. Beauregard's head-quarters, I received orders to move to the support of Gen. Chalmers, who was then engaged with the enemy. We were formed in line by Gen. Withers, to move forward to the support of the advanced line, with the 19th Louisiana on our right. As the army advanced, the forces in front of us retired, and the Washington Artillery, Capt. Hodgson, forming his battery in front of us, we supported him. This battery gallantly maintained their position, dealing destruc tion upon the foe, until the artillery on their left retired, leaving them alone. At this moment the enemy advanced in heavy force,"], [55, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 345 and the artillery properly fearing such odds, limbered up and filed off to our left. We then advanced, covering the movement of the artillery, saving several of their pieces, and driving the enemy before us. Here fell Capts. Graham and Campbell, two of my best and most gallant officers, and in this same charge fell, killed and wounded, most of the gallant spirits whose loss we now deplore. The enemy being again reinforced, aster having been driven back, in order to prevent being flanked, we were forced to retire to the ravine. The 1st Missouri, lying under the brow of the hill, sent a volley into the enemy, which threw them into confusion, and my regiment, rallying again, charged the enemy. Here my color ser geant, Shilling, with three of the color guard, were shot down, and the flag was handed to Sergeant Lyons, of the Twiggs Guards, who bore it faithfully and fearlessly over the hill. This time, with another regiment on our left, we drove the enemy into a wheat field, and back to the undergrowth, when finding them supported by two regiments in ambush, we retired in good order to the ravine. Four times thus, we drove the enemy back, every time coming upon us with fresh troops. At about 3 o'clock, when the troops were or dered to retire, we did so by the orders of Gens. Hardee and Withers, being held, with other regiments, under command of Col. Wheeler of the Alabama regiment, to protect the withdrawal of the other troops of our army, until between five and six o'clock, p. m., when we proceeded to a point about three and a half miles from Monterey, where we encamped during the night, returning the next morning to this camp. My men were exhausted, and were absolutely sinking on the way from the effects of fatigue, want of food, sleep, and rest. We left the field of battle a half mile in ad vance of the point where we commenced the fight, and within that space lay those brave men who had fallen dead aud wounded, num bering one hundred and seven, a detailed report of which is an nexed. Lieut.-col. McPheeter's, Major Basworth, Capts. Hardenburg (Commissary), and Gribble (Quarter-master), and Adjutant Vena bles, behaved gallantly. Among the line officers, I have great satisfaction in mentioning the following as distinguished for coolness, braveiy, and the faithful discharge of their duty : Company A, Lieuts.

On the first day of the action, my company was attached as support to a section of Capt. Ketchum's battery on the left flank of Brig.-gen. Ruggles' division. In the afternoon of the same day, when the battery was ordered forward, my company, by order of Gen. Beauregard, dismounted to fight on foot. I advanced with the 27th regiment Tennessee, but did not have the gratification of exchanging shots with the enemy before their final retreat to the gunboats. Nothing of note occurred in the action of the 6th inst. On the morning of the 7th, I was ordered to the extreme left as flankers and skirmishers, and was advancing in that position when Major-gen. Bragg ordered me to join Col. Brewers' battalion in the charge upon one of the enemy's batterys on the left \u2014 but being ordered to retire before reaching the battery, did not succeed in its capture. The remainder of the day, we remained in rear of Gen. Ruggles' division, as support to Capt. Ketchum's battery. 2d Lieut. Mclntosh was attached as commander of Gen.

The remainder of the day and also the night was under the com mand of Capt. Cox. Monday morning I was ordered by Brig.-gen. Ruggles to form line of battle with a Tennessee battalion on the left. Soon orders came to assist in a charge with said battalion and Texas Rangers. The charge, from some cause, was not made, and we fell back, where my command remained, until ordered by Gen. Bragg to hasten to Corinth to overtake and aid the escort with the prisoners. I went on the field with three commissioned officers, six non-com missioned officers, and forty-eight privates. In the evening, private George W. McCurdy was shot by the enemy through the right hand with a musket ball. Same evening, corporal W. D. King was slightly wounded in the right arm. In the morning, sergeant John J. Cochran was thrown from his horse and his left shoulder was dis located. None missing. I had four horses killed and five wounded.

Captain : \u2014 Soon after my arrival at this post, I caused an exam ination to be made of the condition of the horses of the 1st regi ment Florida cavalryf with a view to ascertain their fitness to be marched to Tennessee. I regret to say, that owing to hard service, want of all food for days at a time, and an entire absence of long forage for nearly two months, all the horses, with but few excep tions, are so much reduced as to be entirely unfit for any service which would require that they should be used continually for three 23"], [64, "354 official reports of battles. days. I can use them for scouting within a distance of forty or fifty miles, where they are not ridden more than twenty or thirty miles a day, and often rested. Many of them could not do any duty, they are so much reduced. There are at least two hundred that ought to be condemned, or put into some wild pasture. I think if two-thirds were sent to Paine's prairie and put to pasture, the other third would be fit for such service as would be required of them here. The placing of the broken down horses in pasture would in six weeks put them all in good condition that are capable of being made serviceable. A number of the horses have died, some have been abandoned on the various marches. From this statement, the Colonel will perceive that the regiment is entirely unfit to proceed to Tennessee as a cavalry corps. If the govern ment will mount it in Tennessee, the men are well instructed and could render service. The horses as they are would not be worth what it would cost the government to feed them on the road, and the pay allowed for their use. As we have a complete new cavalry equipment, and have good men, who have learned the drill, it would be a matter of regret that the regiment should not be employed as cavalry. I am using about two hundred and fifty men as scouts, who are mounted on the best horses. You are aware that there are two hundred and fifty horses at Camp \" Mary Davis,\" belong ing to three companies now on duty here dismounted. These horses are all in good order, and capable of any service. Two hun dred of the horses here could be put in good condition if not used for one month, and would be fit for service in Tennessee. If we condemned all the rest, we should lack, to mount the command, about four hundred horses. The dismissal of the horses would be a great hardship upon the men, unless compensation was made by the Government. They have been rendered unserviceable by reason of the inability of the government to furnish forage, and by expo sure to the weather. The officers have become security for the men, who bought the horses on credit, and the pay now due would not indemnify them. I do not, therefore, recommend the con demnation of the horses, unless some compensation is made the men. I have the honor to request that the Colonel commanding will make such communication on the subject to the department as he may deem proper, that I may receive instructions.

Head-quarters Department No. 1, Vicksburg, 22d May, 1862. Gen. S. Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector-general, Richmond, Va. : Sir : \u2014 Herewith, I have the honor to transmit the reports of Brig.-gens. Duncan and Smith, with the accompanying documents, of the operations preceding and attendant upon the fall of New Or leans. The department is fully aware, from my official correspondence and telegraphic dispatches, of the exact nature of the defences erected for the protection of that city. Consisting in general terms of an exterior line of forts and earthworks, intended to prevent the entrance of the armed vessels of the enemy, and an interior line in the immediate vicinity of the city, which was constructed almost entirely with reference to repelling any attack made by land with infantry. Where this line crossed the river below the city, it was intended to have a battery of twelve 32 and ten 42-pounders, which it was considered would enable us to drive back any small number of ships that might succeed in passing the obstructions at the forts, under the fire ol\" their guns. But, whether sufficient or not, no more were to be had, and subsequently, at the earnest re quest of the naval authorities, I transferred the 42-pounders to the steamers \" Carondelet\" and \" Bienville,\" for service on Lake Pon chartrain, in connection with Forts Pike and Macomb. Immediately after I assumed command of the department, finding that there were no guns of the heaviest calibre, I applied to Richmond, Pensacola, and other points, for some 10-inch columbiads and sea coast mor tars, which I considered necessary to the defence of the lower river, but none could be spared ; the general impression being that New Orleans would not be attacked by the river, and I was therefore compelled to make the best possible defence with the guns at my disposal. Twelve 42-pounders were sent to Forts Jackson and St. Philip, together with a large additional quantity of powder, and"], [68, "358 official reports of battles. being convinced that with the guns of inferior calibre mounted there we could not hinder steamers from passing, unless they could be detained for some time under the fire of the works, I pushed for ward rapidly the construction of a raft, which offered a complete obstruction to the passage of vessels up the river, except through a small opening, and then only one at a time. The forts had seventy five or eighty guns that could be brought successively to bear upon the river, were manned by garrisons of well trained artillerists, af fording a double relief to each gun, and commanded by officers who had no superiors in any service. Under these circumstances, although I feared the high water in the Spring, with the accom panying drift, would carry away the raft, yet every confidence was felt that the river would remain closed until such time as the iron clad steamers, \" Mississippi\" and \" Louisiana,\" could be finished, which I was confidently informed would not be later than the 1st of February. The first raft constructed was not carried away by the high water and drift until the latter part of February. But with funds placed at my disposal by the citizens of New Orleans, another was placed in position in March, by the energetic labors ot Col. Higgins and others, and the position was again temporarily secure. No heavy guns had yet been received, although strenuous applications were made by me to get some from Pensacola, when that place was abandoned. The general impression of all those to whom I applied was, that the largest guns should be placed above New Orleans, not below, although I had notified the department on the 22d March, that in my judgment the fleet only awaited the ar rival of the mortar vessels to attempt to pass up the river from below. By means, however, of an energetic and persevering officer, Major W. P. Duncan, Commissary of Subsistence, three 10-inch columbiads and five mortars were finally procured and brought over just in time to be put up as the firing commenced. Thinking that the enemy's troops at Isle Breton were intended to land at Quarantine and act in rear of Fort St. Philip, I ordered Col. Sys mauski's regiment of ninety day's men, armed with shot guns, to that point as a protection. I had likewise organized two companies of sharpshooters and swamp hunters, under Capts. Mullen and Lar tique, which were sent down for operation upon the enemy's vessels from the banks of the river, but the high water, keeping the men day and night nearly waist deep iu water, soon compelled them to abandon their positions. I will here state that every Confederate soldier in New Orleans, with the exception of one company, had been ordered to Corinth to join Gen. Beauregard, in March,"], [69, "official reports of battles. 359 and the city was only garrisoned by about 3,000 ninety day troops, \u2014 called out by the Governor, at my request, \u2014 of whom about 1,200 had muskets, and the remainder shot guns of an indifferent description. The river rose rapidly in April, and soon drove out Sysmauski's regiment, which was removed to the west bank, about six miles above Fort Jackson. The whole country became one vast sheet of water, which rose in the forts and covered places heretofore safe from its encroachments. Under the tremendous pressure of this current and a storm of wind and rain, the second raft was broken away in the night of Friday, the 11th of April, two days before the enemy first opened fire. The fourteen vessels of Montgomery river defence expedition had been ordered by the department, when com pleted, to be sent up to Memphis and Fort Pillow, but believing the danger of attack to be greater from below, I detained six of them at New Orleans, of which change the department was fully advised. At my suggestion, Gov. Moore had also fitted up two steamers, which were sent to the forts below the city. A large .number of fire-rafts were also constructed and steered down, and two small steamers were employed for the special purpose of towing these rafts into position where they could be most effective, so as to leave the armed vessels free to operate against the enemy. I telegraphed Gen. Beauregard to send down the iron-clad ram Manassas, and when the Secretary of the Navy ordered the steamer Louisiana to be sent also up the river, I protested through the War Department, being satisfied that we required more heavy guns below. She was eventually permitted to go down the river on Sunday, the 20th of April, but not in a condition to use her motive power with effect. It was hoped that, notwithstanding this, she would be able to assume a position below Fort St. Philip, discovering the location of the mortar boats, and being herself proof against direct fire, dis lodge the enemy with her guns, which were of very heavy calibre. Knowing, also, that the incessant bombardment kept Gen. Duncan closely confined to Fort Jackson, so that he could give no orders to the river defence steamers, I placed the whole under the control of Capt. Mitchell, the armed steamers as well as the tugs intended to tow down the fire-rafts. I will here state, that the river defence fleet proved a failure, for the very reasons set forth in my letter to the department of the 15th ofAp.il. Unable to govern themselves, and unwilling to be governed by others, their almost total want of system, vigilance, and discipline, rendered them useless and helpless, when the enemy finally dashed upon them suddenly in a dark night."], [70, "360 official reports of battles. I regret very much that the department did not think it advisable to grant my request to place some competent head in charge of these steamers. Learning, subsequently, that the Louisiana was anchored above the forts and that the fire-rafts were not sent down, I telegraphed Capt. Mitchell, requesting him to attend to it, and afterwards called upon Commodore Whittle and entreated him to order the steamer to take the desired position below the forts. This he declined to do, but telegraphed Capt. Mitchell, telling him \" to strain a point to place the vessel there, if in his judgment it was advisable.\" No change, however, was made, and in the night of the 23d March, I went down myself in a steamboat to urge Capt. Mitchell to have the Louisiana anchored in the position indicated, also to ascertain why the fire-rafts were not sent down. A few moments after the attack commenced, and the enemy succeeded in passing with fourteen ships, as described in Gen. Duncan's report, and the battle of New Orleans, as against ships of war, was over. I returned at once to the city, narrowly escaping capture, and giving orders to Gen. Smith, in command of the interior lines, to prepare to make all possible resistance to the enemy's fleet at the earth-work batteries below the town, instructed Col. Lovell to have several steamers ready to remove, as far as possible, the commissary and ordnance stores, being satisfied that the low developmients at Chalmette could offer no protracted resistance to a powerful fleet, whose guns, owing to the high water, looked down upon the surface of the country, and could sweep away any num ber of infantry by an enfilading fire. These lines, as before remarked, were intended mainly to repel a land attack, but in a high stage of water were utterly untenable by infantry against guns afloat. It having been reported to me that a sufficient number of desvierately bold men could easily be got together \\o board the enemy's vessels and carry them by assault, I authorized Major James to seize such steamers as might be necessary for his purpose, and to attempt it. He called for one thousand men by public advertisement, but being able to find but about a hundred who would undertake it, he abandoned the project. On the morning of the 25th, the enemy's fleet ad vanced upon the batteries and opened fire, which was returned with spirit by the troops as long as their powder lasted, but with little apparent effect upon the enemy. The powder intended for this bat tery of 32-pounders, had been transferred by me to the steamer Louisiana a few days before, under the supposition that it would render much better service from her heavy rifles and shell guns than with a battery of light 32's. For the operations at these works, you"], [71, "official reports of battles. 361 are respectfully referred to Gen. Smith's report. The greater por tion of the ordnance stores, provisions, and quarantine property, were sent from the city by rail or steamer, and a portion of the volunteers also took the cars for Camp Moore, seventy-eight miles distant on the Jackson railroad. The greater part of the ninety days' troops disbanded and returned to their homes. There were two or three regiments and smaller bodies of men raised for Con federate service, in the city at the time, but being entirely without arms of any kind, they could be of no service, and were also ordered to Camp Moore. I adopted this course, recognizing the perfect absurdity of confronting more than a hundred guns afloat, of the largest calibre, well manned and served, and looking down upon the city, with less than three thousand militia, mostly aimed with indifferent shot guns. It would, in my judgment, have been a wanton and criminal waste of the blood of women and children, without the possibility of any good result, for the enemy had only to anchor one of his ships at Kenner to command the Jackson rail road, and he could have reduced the city to ashes at his leisure, without our being able to make any resistance whatever. Why he did he not occupy Kenner and cut off all exit from the the city immediately, I do not understand. Presuming that he would do so, as a matter of course, I had requested Capts. Poin dexter and Gwathney, of the Navy, to have all the steamers ready in Lake Pontchartrain, to carry the troops over to Madisonville, whence they could reach Camp Moore. A portion of them were taken over by this route. Knowing that the enemy would at once seize the Opelousas railroad, and thus cut off the troops occupying the works on the coast of west Louisiana, I sent orders to the dif ferent commanding officers at Ports Livingston, Guiorr, Quitman, Berwick and Chene, to destroy*their guns, and taking their small arms, provisions and ammunition, to rejoin me at Camp Moore. Major Joy brought away the troops at the two latter forts, in a very creditable manner, but those at the other works became de moralized, disbanded, and returned to New Orleans. I gave verbal instructions to Col. Fuller, to have the garrison of Forts Pike and Macomb, battery Bienvenu and Tower Dupre, ready to move at a moment's notice, as their posts were dependent on the city for pro visions, and frequently for water. It was understood that the naval steamers, in connection with other vessels in the lake, should bring away these garrisons when called upon to do so, and after my arrival at Camp Moore, orders were given on the 26th, to go for them, as I had been informed that Forts Jackson and St. Philip"], [72, "362 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. had been surrendered. Finding that this report was untrue, I im mediately countermanded the orders, giving instructions that they should be held until further notice, but before either could reach Madisonville, it was reported that the whole command was already at Covington. I advised Capt. Poindexter to make his way to Mobile, with his armed steamers, but he concluded to destroy them. We, however, procured from them some of the guns and ordnance stores, which I ordered immediately to Vicksburgh, to be put in position there. On the 25th, Capt. Bayley, of the Federal Navy, demanded the sur render of the city, and that the flags should be taken down, and the United States flag put up on the Mint, Custom-house, and other public buildings. To this demand I returned an unqualified refusal, de claiming that I would not surrender the city or any portion of my command, but added, that feeling unwilling to subject the city to bombardment, and recognizing the utter impossibility of removing the women and children, I should withdraw my troops and turn it over to the civil authorities. This I did in compliance with the openly expressed opinion of all the prominent citizens around me \u2014 that it would be a useless waste of blood, without being productive of any beneficial results to the cause, for the troops to remain. Capt. Bayley then returned to his ship, under escort through the city, at his own request, of two officers of my staff, Col. Lovell and Major James, and I then advised the Mayor not to surrender the city, nor to allow the flags to be taken down by any of our people, but to leave it to the enemy to take them down himself. This advice was followed by the city authorities; but the idea being held out, in their subsequent correspondence with the Federal officers, that they were placed in a defenceless condition, by the withdrawal of the troops, but for which a different course might have been pursued, I promptly telegraphed to Major James, of my staff, then in the city, offering to return at once with my whole command, if the citizens felt disposed to resist to the last extremity, and remain with them to the end. I had deliberately made up my mind, that although such a step would be entirely indefensible, in a military point of view, yet if the people of New Orleans were desirous of signalizing their patriotism and devotion to the cause by the bom bardment and burning of their city, I would return with my troops and not leave as long as one brick remained upon another. The only palliation for such an act would be that it would give unmis takable evidence to the world that our people were in deadly earnest. This determination, plainly expressed in my dispatches"], [73, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 363 to Major James (herewith transmitted, marked A), was read by him to the Mayor, and also to the city council, in presence of one or more prominent citizens. The opinion was generally and freely expressed by the Mayor and others, that the troops ought not to return. (See report of Major James, hereunto appended, marked B.) I went to the city myself, however, on the night of the 28th of April, and in order that there might be no mistake, made the same proposition in person to the Mayor. He said he did not think it advisable for the troops to return \u2014 that such a step would only be followed by a useless sacrifice of life, without any corresponding benefit, and urged decidedly that it be not done. I, however, ad dressed him a letter (herewith appended, marked C,) declaring my willingness to return and share a bombardment with them, and waited until the night of the 29th for an answer, but receiving none in writing, returned to Camp Moore. The same proposition was made by me, in the course of the day, to several prominent citizens, but was invariably discountenanced by them. For a week after the withdrawal of the troops, I had a number ot officers in the city, and kept trains running regularly, which brought out a large amount of government property and stores, as well as those of the State of Louisiana. Nearly every thing was brought away, except the heavy guns and some property which persons in their fright had destroyed, and every thing might have been saved, had not persons refused to work for my officers, fearing that they might be subjected to punishment by the enemy. Many, also, re fused to work for Confederate money, which occasioned some delay and difficulty in the removal of stores. I feel gratified, however, in being able to state that we brought away all the troops that would leave, and, including the property of the State, a greater amount in value than belonged to the government. What we failed to bring was from inability to get transportation. In this duty I was mainly assisted by Col. Lovell, Major James, Major Ball, Capt. Venables, and Lieut. McDonald, to whom the government is greatly indebted for the safety of much valuable property. It was a source of great distress to me, to see the result of months of toil and labor swept away in a few hours, but it was, in my opinion, mainly attributable to the following causes, which I could not by any possibility control. 1st. The want of a sufficient number of guns of heavy calibre, which every exertion was made to procure, without success. 2d. The failure, through inefficiency and want of energy of those who had charge of the construction of the iron-clad steamers Loui siana and Mississippi, to have them completed -in the time specified,"], [74, "364 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. so as to supply the place of obstructions ; and, finally, the declen sion of the officers in charge of the Louisiana to allow her (though not entirely ready) to be placed as a battery in the position indi cated by Gen. Duncan and myself. On these last points I could only advise and suggest, as they appertained to a separate and in dependent department, over which I had no control whatever. (See letter of Major James, hereunto appended, marked D). Open ed fire on the 13th of April, which was kept up, at intervals, for five days, when the mortars opened, and, from that time, with but a single interruption of a few hours, a bombardment was kept up for seven days and nights, which, for great rapidity and accuracy of range, has no parallel. More than twenty-five thousand shells were thrown, of which not less than one-third fell within the limits of Fort Jackson, yet the garrison held out, although wet, without change of clothing, and exhausted for want of rest and regular food, with a heroic endurance which is beyond all praise. That the enemy succeeded in passing a large portion of his fleet by the forts on a dark night, under a heavy fire, is due to no fault of the garrison of the forts. They did their whole duty, nobly and heroically, and had they been seconded, as they should have been by the defences afloat, we should not have to record the fall of New Orleans. To the officers of my staff, who underwent months of severe and arduous labor, collecting supplies, creating resources, with the most limited means, and preparing all sorts of materials and munitions of war by ingenious makeshifts, I return my thanks. Left in the city with a small force of badly armed militia, all opportunity for dis tinction or glory was out off, yet they never flagged in their zeal and devotion to the cause. When the country knows all that was done, and under what disadvantages it was accomplished, I feel con fident that their verdict will do ample justice to those who shared equally in the labors of preparation, while they were denied the glory of taking part in the defence. The battle for the defence of New Orleans was fought and lost at Forts Jackson and St. Philip. The extraordinary and remarkable conduct of the garrisons of these forts, in breaking out in open mutiny, after covering them selves with glory by their heroic defence, is one of those strange anomalies for which I do not pretend to account. The facts are re corded and speak for themseves. The causes will, probably, never be known in full. For the detailed accounts of the bombardment of the forts, and the engagements at the time of the passage of the fleets by them and the batteries at Chalmette, you are respectfully referred to the"], [75, "365 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. accompanying reports of Gens. Duncan and Smith. There were no batteries except at these two points, for the reason that no guns could be procured to place in them. I had frequent occasion to re gret that it was found impossible to give me control of the defences afloat as well as here. A single controlling head might have made all the resources more available and efficient in working out the desired result. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, M. LOVELL, Major-gen. Commanding.

Lovell: Sir :\u2014 I have the honor to report, that while I was in the city of New Orleans, on the 27th of April, executing your orders to assist in removing the Government and State property, and while the negotiations were going on between the city authorities and the Federal officers for the surrender, I was informed that the nature of the replies to the naval commander was such as to throw some cen sure upon yourself, for leaving them, as the mayor styled it, without military protection. I deemed it my duty to advise you of this immediately, the result, of which was the inclosed dispatches from you, offering to return with your troops, and afford them all the protection in your power, but that the responsibility of .any results that might ensue must rest upon the citizens themselves. I read your dispatches to the City Council, which was then in session, in presence of Mr. Pierre Soule, who\" happened to be there at the time. That gentleman, who seemed-to speak for the mayor and Council, most emphatically de clared that you ought not to return with your troops, as did also the mayor and members of the Council. Several of them, however, declared that they would be glad to have you return alone, and see matters for yourself, to which effect I telegraphed you. You came to the city that evening, with a single aid-de-camp, and went with me to the mayor's house, where you, in my presence, told him that the citizens should have no cause to say that they were obliged to submit for want of military protection ; that you were ready and willing to bring your whole command into the city within 24 hours, and undergo a bombardment with them, if that was their desire. That you had withdrawn, to enable the citizens to decide the matter for themselves, as it was they, and not you, Who had their families and property at stake. In reply, the mayor earnestly declined your offer, stating that you had done all in your power, and that it would be a useless waste of life to bring the troops into the city. He also urged you, by all means, to retire from the city for your own safety, and subsequently asked me to persuade you to leave as soon as pos sible, as he would be hung, if the United States authorities found you were at his house. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, L. L. JAMES, Volunteer Aid-de-camp."], [77, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 367 Head-quarters Dep't No. 1, New Orleans. Hon. John T. Monroe, Mayor of New Orleans : Sir: \u2014 When the enemy, having succeeded in passing our defences on the river with his fleet, anchored abreast the city, it was apparent that the infantry troops under my command could offer no effectual resistance, and their presence would only serve as a pretext and justification for them to open their guns upon a city crowded with women and children, whom it was impossible to remove. Under these circumstances, I determined at once to withdraw my troops, and leave it to the citizens themselves to agree upon the course of action to be pursued, in relation to the welfare of their families and property. I now beg leave to say, that if it is the determination of the people of the city to hold it at any and all hazards, I will return with my troops, and share the danger with them. That my return will be followed by bombardment, is, in my opinion, certain, but if that is the conclusion come to, I will afford all the protection in my power. Very respectfully, M. LOVELL, Major-gen. commanding. (D.) Camp Moore, April 30, 1862. To Gen. M. Lovell, Commanding Department No. 1.; General : \u2014 At your request, upon my return from Forts Jack son and St. Philip, I accompanied you to call upon Com. Whittle, of the navy, at his head-quarters in New Orleans, for the purpose of getting that officer, if possible, to place the iron-clad gunboat *' Lou isiana\" in a position below Forts Jackson and St. Philip, from which she could enfilade the position of the enemy's mortar fleet, and drive them from it, thereby relieving the forts, for a time at least, from the heavy bombardment then going on, which would allow Brig. gen. Duncan to make such repairs as were necessary, and what was equally necessary, give the garrison some rest. The position desig nated for the vessel to be placed in was in an eddy upon the Fort St. Philip side of the river, and under the protection of the guns of both forts, and entirely out of the line of the bombardment ; and, it"], [78, "368 official reports of battles. would require a change of position of the mortar fleet to enable them to strike the vessel with shell, if she could have been struck at all. All these facts were fully explained by yourself to Com. Whittle, and he was requested, by you, by all means, to place the vessel in said position, even if she was lost, as the maintaining the position then held by your troops in the forts, without this assistance, was merely a question of time. To this earnest appeal, upon your part, Com. Whittle telegraphed to Commander Mitchell, of the fleet sta tioned just above the forts, \" to strain a point, if in his judgment it was necessary, to comply with your request, and place the Louisiana in the position before spoken of.\" As the result shows, the request of Com. Whittle to Commander Mitchell was not complied with. I make this statement voluntarily, in order that, if ever the ques tion of the defences of New Orleans should arise, that you can have every evidence to show that it was not certainly the want of proper exertions on the part of the land forces which caused the fall of New Orleans. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, L. L. JAMES, Volunteer Aid-de-camp. Report of Brig.-gen. J. K. Duncan, commanding Coast Defences. New Orleans, La., April 30, 1862. Major J. G. Pickett, Aes't Adj't-general, Department No. 1, Camp Moore, La. : I have the honor to submit the following report of the bombard ment of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, La., from the 16th to the 24th of April, 1862. About the 27th of March, I was informed by Lieut.-col. E. Hig gins, commanding Forts Jackson and St. Philip, composing a part of the coast defences under my command, that the enemy's fleet was crossing the bars, and entering the Mississippi river in force. In consequence, I repaired at once to that post, to assume the general command of the threatened attack upon New Orleans, which I had always anticipated would be made from that quarter. Upon my arrival, I found that Fort Jackson was suffering severely from transpiration and backwater, occasioned by the excessive rise in the"], [79, "369 official reports of battles. river, and the continued prevalence of strong easterly winds. Not withstanding every effort which could be made, the water kept daily increasing upon us, partly owing to the sinking of the entire site, and to the natural lowness of the country around it, until the parade-plain and casemates were very generally submerged to the depth of from three to eighteen inches. It was with the utmost difficulty, and only then by isolating the magazines, and by pump ing day and night, that the water could be kept out of them. As the officers and men were all obliged to live in these open and submerged casemates, they were greatly exposed to discomfort and sickness, as their clothing and feet were always wet. The most of their clothing and blankets, besides, were lost by the fire hereinafter mentioned. Fort St. Philip, from the same causes, was in a similar condition, but to a lesser extent. No attention having been previously paid to the repeated requi sitions for guns of heavy calibre for these forts, it became necessary, in their present condition, to bring in and mount, and to build the platforms for the three 10 inch and three 8-inch columbiads, the ri fled 42-pounder, and the five 10-inch sea coast mortars, recently ob tained from Pensacola on the evacuation of that place, together with the two rifled 7-inch guns, temporarily borrowed from the naval authorities in New Orleans. It was also found necessary to prepare the old water battery to the rear of and below Fort Jackson, which had never been completed, for the reception of a portion of these guns, as well as to construct mortar proof magazines and shell rooms within the same. In consequence also of the character of the expected attack by heavy mortars, it was deemed advisable to cover all the main maga zines at both sorts with sand bags to a considerable depth, to pro tect them against a vertical fire. After great exertions, cheerfully made by both officers and men, and by working the garrisons by relief's night and day, this work was all accomplished by 13th of April. No sooner had the two rifled 7-inch navy guns been placed in- position, however, than orders arrived to dismount one of them immediately, and to send the same to the city at once, to be placed on board of the iron-clad steamer Louisiana. I strongly remonstrated against this removal, by tele graph, but was informed in reply that the orders were imperative, and that the gun must be sent without fail. It was accordingly sent, but with great difficulty, owing to the overflow and the other causes stated. The garrisons of both forts were greatly fatigued and worn out by these labors, performed as they were under pres- \u25a0Jl"], [80, "370 official reports of battles. sure, and within sight of the enemy, and owing to the many dis comforts and disadvantages we were laboring under, in consequence of high water. In the mean time, I had called upon the general commanding the department, for two regiments, to be stationed at the quarantine buildings, six miles above the forts, to act as a reserve force, and to co-operate with the forts, in case of a combined land and water attack. I also asked for Capt. W. G. Mullen's company of scouts and sharpshooters, to be stationed in the woods below Fort Jackson, on the right bank of the river, for the purpose of picking off the officers and men from the enemy's vessels, when assuming their several positions of attack. Capt. Mullen's company, of about 125 men, was sent down as requested, and stationed in part in the point of woods below Fort Jackson, and the remainder on the Fort St. Philip side, opposite the raft obstructing the river. The Chalmette regiment, consisting of about 500 men, Col. Sys mauskie commanding, was sent to the quarantine. A part of it was stationed there, and company detachments were placed at the head of the several canals, leading from the river into the back bays of the same, to guard against a land force being thrown in launches above us. Four steamers of the river fleet, protected, and to a certain ex tent made shot-proof with cotton bulk-heads, and prepared with iron prows to act as rams, viz : the Warrior, Stonewall Jackson, Defiance, and Resolute, commanded by Capts. Stephenson, Philips, McCoy, and Hooper, respectively, were sent down to report to and co-operate with me. The steamers Governor Moore and General Quitman, prepared as those before mentioned, and commanded by Capts. B. Kennon and A. Grant, were sent down in like manner to co-operate with the forts, and ram such vessels of the enemy as might succeed in passing. The naval authorities also sent down the C. S. steam ram Manassa, Capt. Warly, C. S. navy, commanding. She was stationed a short distance above Fort Jackson, with her steam up constantly, to act against the enemy as occasion might offer. Subsequently, also, Capt. F. B. Renshaw, C. S. Navy, arrived in command of the C. S. steamer Jackson. The raft of logs and chains, which had formerly been placed across the river, having proven a failure, upon the rise in the stream and the constant velocity of the drift-bearing current, a new obstruction had been placed across the river, opposite Fort Jackson, by Lieut.-col. E. Higgins, prior to his assumption of the command of the forts. This consisted of a line of schooners anchored at intervals, with bows up stream, and thoroughly chained together amidships, as well as stern and"], [81, "371 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. stem. The rigging, ratlines, and cable, were left to trail astern of thi;se schooners, as an additional impediment, to tangle in the pro peller wheels of the enemy. This schooner raft was seriously dam aged by the wind storm on the 10th and 11th of April, which parted the chains, scattered the schooners, and materially affected its character and effectiveness as an obstruction. In addition to the wind, the raft was also much damaged by allowing some of the fire barges to get loose and drift against it, through the carelessness of those having them in charge. A large number of these fire barges were tied to the banks above both forts, ready at all times to be towed into the current and against the enemy, for the double purpose of firing his ships, and to light up the river by night to insure the accuracy of our fire. My instruc tions to the river fleet, under Capt. Stephenson, (see attached docu ment A,) were, to be in the stream above the raft, with sueh boats as had stern guns, in order to assist the forts with their fire, in case the enemy should attempt the passage, as well as to turn in and ram, at all hazards, all such vessels as might succeed in getting above the raft. He was also required to take entire control of the fire barges, (see attached document B,) to reconnoitre the enemy above the head of the passes, and to keep a watch boat-below every night, near the point of woods, to signal the approach of the enemy. The accompanying diagram will illustrate all the points referred to in this report. The same instructions were given to Capts. Kennon and Grant, and, upon his arrival, Capt. Renshaw was duly informed of the ar rangements made, in which he promised heartily to co operate. While the enemy remained at the Head of the Passes, twenty-two and a half miles below the forts, and, subsequently, when he came up to the Jump, or Wilder's Bayou, the boats of the river fleet took turns in running down and watching his movements. For a few nights, also, at this time, one of them was kept below as a guard boat. We had telegraphic communication, besides, down to within half a mile of the Jumps, nine miles below the forts, which, together with scouts operating in the bays to the east aud west of the river, in skiffs and perognes, kept us duly posted, meanwhile, of the ene my's movements below as far down as the South-west Pass. The enemy was not, meanwhile, idle in the interim. His large vessels were worked over the South-west bar, after failing to make an en trance at Pass a l'Outre, and the mortar fleet was brought up as far as the S. W. Pilot Station, where the mortars were scaled and afterwards tested. From seven to thirteen steam sloops of war and"], [82, "372 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. gunboats were constantly kept at the Head of the Passes or at the Jump, to cover his operations below, and to prevent our observing his movements by way of the river. By gradual and regular ap proaches, he carefully closed up the forts, day by day, and opened the attack as hereinafter detailed. April 9. One of our reconnoitring steamers was chased and fol lowed up by two of the enemy's gunboats as far as the point of woods below Fort Jackson, but were soon forced to retire by a few shots from our batteries. This was his first reconnoissance, and our fire was not returned. April 13. Several of the hostile gunboats again came up to make observations. They would occasionally show themselves, singly or in pairs, above the point of woods, and exchange a few shots with the forts, and then retire again behind the point. Our sharpshooters obtained a few shots on this occasion, but with very partial result, owing to the lowness of the surrounding country and the extreme rise in the river. Many of the men were up to their waists in water, and, in consequence, sickness prevailed among them, and unfitted them for duty. The enemy spent the principal part of the day in firing grape and canister, and in shelling the woods to drive them out. This was repeated the following day, the enemy not coming within range or sight of the forts, but confining himself to shelling the woods below. The sharpshooters were all driyen out by this second day's firing. Our telegraphic communication below was also broken up, as the wires were removed and many of the posts cut and torn down by the enemy. There being no other point, above or belqjv, where the sharp shooters could profitably act in that capacity, and as many of them were unfit for duty from exposure, I deemed it advisable to dispense with their services and send them to the city, which was accordingly done. It being of the highest importance, however, to keep up the tele graphic communication below, Lieut. T. J. Royster's company, sap pers and miners, 22d regiment Louisiana volunteers, volunteered his services with fifteen men of his company, to act as sharpshooters in perogues, and cover the operator in repairing the line and re-estab lishing the connection with the forts above, as well as to annoy the enemy. This also failed, from the great difficulty of managing the perogues effectively in the dense undergrowth of the swampy woods below, and the telegraph and the sharpshooters had to be abandoned in consequence."], [83, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 373 April 15. The enemy brought up his whole fleet, extending the same from the Head of the Passes to the Point of Woods below the forts. Orders were repeatedly given to Capt. Stephenson, of the river fleet, to cause the fire-barges to be sent down nightly upon the enemy ; but every attempt seemed to prove a perfect abortion, the barges being cut adrift too soon, so that they drifted against the banks directly under the forts, firing our wharves and lighting us up, but obscuring the position of the enemy. In consequence, I turned the control of them, as well as the boats employed to tow them into the stream, over to Capt. Renshaw, the senior naval officer present. I also directed Capts. Kennon and Grant to report to him for orders, as I found great difficulty in communicating with or controlling the vessels afloat, and directed Capt. Stephenson, with his four boats, to co-operate with Capt. Renshaw in every possible way. These boats of the river fleet, it seemed, could not be turned over directly to the immediate command of naval officers, owing to certain conditions imposed by the Navy Department. April 16. From half-past seven o'clock a. m., the enemy's gun boats came round the point repeatedly for observation, but were in variably forced to retire by our fire. In the mean time, he was locating the position of the mortar flotilla, composed of twenty-one schooners, each mounting one 13-inch mortar and other guns, close against the bank on the Fort Jackson side, and behind the point of woods. At hahSpast four o'clock p. m., the enemy ran out a gunboat and fired upon the fort, under cover of which two mortar boats were brought out into the stream. These boats opened fire upon Fort Jackson at five p. m., which was continued for an hour and a half, the enemy, under our fire, retiring behind the point of woods. One fire-barge sent down successfully against the enemy at four o'clock a. m., which drifted in among his vessels and was fired upon by them, creating considerable movement and perturbation. During the day, Capts. Renshaw, Kennon, Seant, Stephenson, and Hooper, passed in turns with their boats below the raft, now very much dis connected and scattered, and exchanged a few shots with the hostile gunboats and mortar-boats. , Two more abortive attempts were made to send down fire-barges against the enemy during the night. April 18. At 9 o'clock a. m., the enemy opened upon Fort Jack son with his entire mortar-fleet of twenty-one vessels, and with rifled guns from his gunboats. Fifteen of them were concealed behind the point of woods, and the other six hauled out in the stream at an angle with them (see diagram), just at the extreme range of our"], [84, "374 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. heaviest guns. Our fire disabled one gunboat and one mortar-boat, causing those in the stream to retire behind the cover of the woods. Generally our shots fell short for lack of elevation, and in conse quence of the inferiority of our powder compared to that of the enemy. Even our nearest gun \u2014 a 10-inch sea-coast mortar \u2014 would not reach his boats with the heaviest charges. The enemy ceased firing at seven o'clock p. m., having fired this day 2,997 mortar shells. The quarters in the bastions were fired and burned down early in the day, as well as the quarters immediately without the fort. The citadel was set on fire and extinguished several times during the first part of the day, but later it became impossible to put out the flames, so that when the enemy ceased firing, it was one burning mass, greatly endangering the magazines, which, at the time, were reported to be on fire. Many of the men, and most of the officers, lost their bedding and clothing by these fires, which greatly added to the discomforts of the overflow. The mortar fire was accurate and terrible, many of the shells falling everywhere within the fort, and disabling some of our best guns. I endeavored to get the naval forces to carry down fire-barges against the enemy so as to disperse it, but they were all let go above the raft, and with such a lack of judgment, that they only lodged under the forts, and did not reach the enemy. (See attached document C.) None of the boats acted as a guard-boat below the raft at night, so that in consequence, the enemy sent up two launches to examine the character of the raft obstructing the river. April 19th. The mortar fleet again opened at 6 and a half o'clock a. m., and the fire was constantly kept up throughout the day. Gun boats constantly came above the point during the day to engage the forts, but were as constantly driven back by our fire. One of them we crippled, which was towed behind the point of woods. The enemy's fire was excellent, a large proportion of his shells falling within Fort Jackson. The terre-plein, parade-plain, parapets, and platforms were very much cut up, as well as much damage done to the casemates. The magazines were considerably threatened, and one shell passed through into the casemates containing fixed ammu nition. One 10-inch and one 8-inch columbiad, one 32 and one 24 pounder, and one 10-inch siege mortar, disabled in the main work. Also, two 32-pounders in the water battery. Bombardment continued very regularly and accurately all night. Failures again made in sending down fire barges."], [85, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 375 April 20. Some rain in the morning. Bombardment constant throughout the day with occasional shots from the gunboats around the point. Wind very high. No fire-barges sent down to light up the river or distract the attention of the enemy at night. In conse quence, between 11 and 12 o'clock p. m., under cover of the heaviest shelling during the bombardment thus far, one of the enemy's gun boats came up in the darkness and attempted to cut the chains of the raft and drag off the schooners. A heavy fire was opened upon her, which caused her to retire, but not until she had partially ac complished her purpose. The raft aster this could not be regarded as an obstruction. The fire continued uninterruptedly all night. April 21st. Firing continued all day and all night without inter ruption. Several guns disabled. Disabled guns were repaired, as far as* practicable, as often as accidents happened to them or their platforms. Fort Jackson by this time was in need of extensive re pairs almost everywhere, and it was with extreme pleasure that we learned of the arrival, during the night, of the iron-clad steamer Louisiana, under the cover of whose heavy guns we expected to make the necessary repairs. April 22d. By the direction of the major-general commanding the department, every thing afloat, including the towboats, and the entire control of the fire-barges, was turned over to Capt. John K. Mitchell, C. S. Navy, commanding the C. S. Naval Forces, Lower Mississippi river. I also gave^apt. Mitchell one hundred and fifty of our best men from Forts Jackson and St. Philip, under Lieuts. Dixon and Gandy, and Capt. Ryan, to serve a portion of the guns of the Louisiana, and to act as sharpshooters on the same vessel. In an interview with Capt. Mitchell, on the morning of this date, I learned that the motive power of the Louisiana was not likely to be completed within any reasonable time, and that in consequence it was not within the range of probabilities that she could be regarded as an aggressive steamer, or that she could be brought into the pending action in that character. As an iron-clad, invulnerable floating-battery, with sixteen guns of the heaviest calibre, however, she was then as complete as she would ever be. Fort Jackson had already undergone, and was still subjected to, a terrible fire of 13 inch mortar shells, which it was necessary to relieve at once, to prevent the disabling of all the best guns at that fort. And although Fort St. Philip partially opened out the point of woods concealing the enemy, and gallantly attempted to dislodge him or draw his fire, he nevertheless doggedly persisted in his one main object, of bat tering Fort Jackson. Under these circumstances I considered that"], [86, "376 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. the Louisiana could only be regarded as a battery, and that her best possible position would be below the raft, close in on the Fort St. Philip's shore, where her fire could dislodge the mortar boats from behind the point of woods, and give sufficient respite to Fort Jack son to repair in extenso. This positioii (X on the accompanying diagram), would give us three direct and cross-fires upon the enemy's approaches, and at the same time insure the Louisiana from a direct assault, as she would be-immediately under the guns of both forts. Accordingly, I earnestly and strongly urged these views upon Capt. Mitchell, in a letter of this date (copy lost), but without avail, as will be seen by his reply attached as document D. Being so deeply impressed myself with the importance of this position for the Louisiana, and of the necessity of prompt action, in order to insure the success of the impending struggle, I agaimirged this subject upon Capt. Mitchell during the latter part of the same day, as absolutely indispensable and imperative to the safety of New Orleans, and to the control of the lower Mississippi. My efforts were ineffectual to get him to move the boat from her original position above the forts. His reply is attached as document E, in which he is sustained by all the naval officers present having the command of vessels. I also addressed him two other notes through the day, the one in regard to sending fire-barges against the enemy, and the other relative to keeping a vigilant look out from all his vessels, and asking for co-operation, should the enteniy attempt to pass during the night. (See attached document F.) Bombardment continued during the day and night, being at times very heavy. During the day our fire was principally confined to shelling the point of woods from both forts, and with apparently good results, as the mortar-fire was slackened towards evening. The casemates were very much cut up by the enemy's fire, which was increased at night. There was little or no success in sending down fire-barges, as usual, owing in part to the condition of the towboats Mosher, Music, and Belle Algerine, in charge of the same, explained by attached document G. This does not excuse the neglect, how ever, as there were six boats of the river fleet available for this ser vice, independent of those alluded to, and fire-barges were plentiful. April 23d. The day broke warm, clear, and cloudless. No im mediate relief being looked for from our fleet, the entire command was turned out to repair damages under a very heavy fire of the enemy. The bombardment continued, without intermission, throughout the day, but slackened off about 12 o'clock h., at which hour there"], [87, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 377 was every indication of an exhaustion on the part of the mortar flotilla. Hence it became evident that the tactics of the enemy would necessarily be changed into an attack with broadsides by his larger vessels. In consequence, these views were laid before Capt. Mitchell, and he was again urged to place the Louisiana at the point before mentioned, below the raft and near the Fort St. Philip bank of the river, to meet the emergency. (See attached document H.) Capt. Mitchell's reply is attached in documents E, I, J, and K, wherein he positively declines again to assume the only position which offered us every possible chance of success, and Capts. Mcln tosh, Huger, and Warly sustain Capt. Mitchell in his views of the case. Just before sundown, under a very heavy mortar fire, the enemy sent up a small boat, and a series of white flags were planted on the Fort St. Philip bank of the river, commencing about 380 yards above the lone tree upon that shore. (See diagram.) This confirmed my previous views of an early and different attack from the usual mortar bombardment, especially as I presumed that these flags indicated the positions to be taken up by the several vessels in their new line of operation. As nothing was to be expected from the Louisiana, after the correspondence during the day, I could only inform Capt. Mitchell of this new movement of the enemy (see at tached document L), and particularly impress upon him the neces sity of keeping the river well lit up with fire-barges, to act as an impediment to the enemy, and assist the accuracy of our fire in a night attack. Lieut. Shyrock, C. S. N., Capt. Mitchell's aid, came on shore about 9 o'clock, p. m., to inform me that the Louisiana would be ready for service by the next evening \u2014 the evening of the 24th. I informed him that time was every thing to us, and that to-mor row would, in all probability, prove too late. Lieut.-col. Higgins warmly seconded my opinion, and warned Lieut. Shyrock that the final battle was imminent within a few hours. In regard to lighting the river, Lieut. Shyrock stated that fire barges would be regularly sent down throughout the night, every two hours ; and as none had been sent up to that hour (9| o'clock, p. m.), he left, informing me that this matter would be attended to as soon as he arrived on board. To my utter surprise, not one single fire-barge was sent down the river, notwithstanding, at any hour of this night. It was impossible for us to send them down, as every thing afloat had been turned over to Capt. Mitchell, by order of the Major-gen. commanding, and the fire-barges, and the boats to tow them into the stream, were"], [88, "378 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. exclusively under his control. In consequence of this criminal neg lect, the river remained in complete darkness throughout the entire night. The bombardment continued all night, and grew furious towards morning. April 24th. At 3| o clock, a. m., the larger vessels of the enemy were observed to be in motion, and, as we presumed, to take up the positions indicated by the small flags planted by them on the previous evening. I then made my last and final appeal to Capt. Mitchell, a copy of which is attached as document M. The Louisiana was still in her old position above Fort St. Philip, surrounded by her tenders, on board of which was the majority of her cannoniers and crew, \u2014 and the other boats of the fleet were generally at anchor above her, excepting the Jackson, Capt. Ren shaw, C. S. N., commanding, which had been sent the day before, at my suggestion, to prevent the landing of forces through the canals above. The McRae lay near and above the Louisiana, and the steam-ram Manassa, with her tender, remained in her constant position above Fort Jackson, both with steam up, and ready for im mediate action. The enemy evidently anticipated a strong demon stration to be made against him with fire-barges. Finding upon his approach, however, that no such demonstration was made, and that the only resistance offered to his passage was the expected fire of the forts \u2014 the broken and scattered raft being then no obstacle \u2014 I am satisfied that he was suddenly inspired, for the first time, to run the gauntlet at all hazards, although not a part of his original design. Be this as it may, a rapid rush was made by him, in columns of twos in echelon, so as not to interfere with each other's broadsides. The mortar fire was furiously increased upon Fort Jackson, and in dashing by, each of the vessels delivered broadside after broadside of shot, shell, grape, canister, and spherical case, to drive the men from our guns. Both the officers and men stood up manfully under this galling and fearful hail, and the batteries of both forts were promptlv opened at their longest range, with shot, shell, hot shot, and a little grape, and most gallantly and rapidly fought, until the enemy suc ceeded in getting above and beyond our range. The absence of light on the river, together with the smoke of the guns, made the obscurity so dense that scarcely a vessel was visible, and in consequence, the gunners were obliged to govern their firing entirely by the flashes of the enemy's guns. I am fully satisfied that the enemy's dash was successful, mainly owing to the cover of darkness, as a frigate and several gunboats were forced to retire as"], [89, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 379 day was breaking. Similar results had attended every previous at tempt made by the enemy to pass or to reconnoitre, when we had sufficient light to fire with accuracy and effect. The passage was of short duration, having been accomplished between 3J a. m. and daylight, under a very rapid and heavy pressure of steam. Of the part taken in this action by the Louisiana, Manassa, and the other vessels composing the co-operating naval forces, I cannot speak with any degree of certainty, excepting that the Louisiana is reported to have fired but twelve shots during the engagement. But to the heroic and gallant manner in which Capt. Huger handled and fought the McRae, we can all bear evidence. The Defiance, Capt. McCoy, commanding, was the only vessel saved out of the river fleet. Shortly after daylight, the Manassa was observed drifting down by the forts. She had been abandoned and fired, and was evident ly in a sinking condition. The McRae was considerably cut up in this action by shot and grape. The Resolute was run on shore about a mile above the sorts, where she hoisted a white flag, but, by the prompt action of the McRae, she was prevented from falling into the hands of the enemy. She was subsequently wrecked and burned. The Warrior was run ashore and fired on the pojnt just above Fort St. Philip. Nothing was known by us of the movements of the Stonewall Jackson, the Governor Moore, or the General Quitman. The steamers Mosher, Music, and Belle Algerine, in charge of the fire barges, were all destroyed. So was also the Star. The heroic courage displayed by the officers and men at both forts was deserv ing of a better success, especially after the fortitude which they constantly exhibited through the long tedium of a protracted bom bardment, unsurpassed for its terrible accuracy, constancy, and fury. Thirteen of the enemy's vessels, out of twenty-three, succeeded in getting by, viz. : the Hartford, Pensacola, Richmond, Brooklyn, Mississippi, Oneida, Iroquois, Cayuga, Wissahickon, Sciota, Kinco, Kallahdin and Pinola. In addition to the foregoing, and to Verona, and such other vessels as were sunk, there were six gunboats and one frigate engaged in this action, besides the mortar flotilla. Heavy chains were flaked along the sides of the most of these ves sels as an iron-proof protection. The extent of the damage which was done to the enemy, we had no means of ascertaining. The vessels which passed all came to an anchor at or below quarantine, six miles above the forts, where they remained until about 10"], [90, "380 OFFICIAL REPORT'S OF BATTLE8. o'clock a. m., when they all passed slowly up the river, with the exception of two gunboats left at the quarantine as a guard. Shortly after the fleet above got under weigh, a gunboat from below made her appearance with a flag of truce, and verbally de manded the surrender of the forts, in the name of Commander D. D. Porter, U. S. Navy, commanding the mortar flotilla, under the penalty of reopening the bombardment, which had ceased shortly after the passage, in case of refusal. The demand was rejected, and the bombardment was reopened about 12 o'clock m. It con tinued until near sundown, when it ceased altogether. The entire mortar fleet, and all the other vessels excepting six gunboats, then got under weigh and passed.down the river and out of sight, under full steam and sail. A vigilant look out was kept up above and below during the night, but all remained quiet. So long as the mortar fleet remained below, the position wherein the Louisiana could render the greatest assistance to the forts was the one below Fort St. Philip hereinbefore mentioned, where the fire from her batteries could dislodge the enemy from behind the point of woods. After the mortar fleet had left, however, and when the enemy had got in force above the forts, the question was materially chang ed, in consequence of the ,fact that all of our heavy guns at both forts had been mounted to bear upon the lower approaches, and not on those above. The most effective position which the Louisiana could then take as a battery, was in the bight above Fort Jackson, where her guns could protect our rear, and sweep the long reach of river above, towards the quarantine. This would still insure her safety, as she would be under the guns of both forts. This is evident by a refer ence to the point (XX) on the diagram. In several personal interviews, and by correspondence with Capt. Mitchell on this date, (see attached documents N, O, P, Q, and R,) I requested him, during the morning of the 24th, while the mortar fleet was below, to place the Louisiana below the raft and dislodge it ; and later in the day, when the mortar fire was nearly exhaust ed, to place her in the position (XX) above Fort Jackson, to assist in repelling an attack from the vessels above. During the day she was in an unfit condition to assume either position, for the reasons given by Capt. Mitchell in his letters to me. The intoxicated volunteers referred to were none of my men, nor did they get their liquor at the forts, as there was none on hand there during the bombardment, excepting the small supplies of hos pital stores in the medical department."], [91, "381 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. April 25th. No attack attempted during the day by the enemy, either from above or below. The gunboats from the quarantine and from the point of woods. below occasionally showed themselves for observation, but without firing. During the day all the princi pal guns that would admit of it at both forts were prepared at once so as to traverse in a full circle, and -bear above or below as neces sity might require. Some of the 24-pounder barbette guns at Fort Jackson were also replaced by guns of heavier calibre, to bear on the river above. Permission was granted by the enemy to the Confederate States Steamer McRae to proceed to New Orleans, under a flag of truce, with the wounded. Availing ourselves of the offer of Capt. Mitch ell, the seriously wounded of both forts were sent on board of her. As it was late when the wounded were all gotten on board, the Mcftae did not get off until the next morning. Still failed during the day in getting Capt. Mitchell to place the Louisiana in the bight above Fort Jackson, where she could act against the enemy from above. One of the raft schooners was burned during the night to light the river, and all remained quiet. April 26th. A gunboat with a white flag dropped down from the quarantine to escort the McRae on her mission. The McRae did not again return to the forts. Four of the enemy's steamers were in sight at the quarantine at dawn. A gunboat occasionally showed herself below to reconnoitre. In the direction of Bird Island, and back of the salt works, a large steam frigate and an ordinary river steamer appeared in sight, the latter working her way up the bay behind Fort St. Philip, apparently towards the quarantine. During the day, Capt. Mitchell communicated with the enemy above, under a flag of truce, and learned that the city had surrendered, and that the Confederate States steam ram Mississippi had been burned by our authorities. The wreck of the floating dock or battery drifted by the forts about 4 o'clock p. m. The Louisiana was not placed in the position required of her dur ing the day, Capt. Mitchell promising to put her there the next day, the 27th. Another raft-schooner burned for light, and all quiet during the night. No shots exchanged during the day. April 27. At daylight, the steamer which had been observed the day before, working her way up in the back bays, was in view, im mediately in the rear of Fort St. Philip, and near the mouth of the Fort Bayou. A frigate and five other vessels were also in sight to wards Bird Island, one of which was seen working her way up the bay. From ten to thirteen launches were visible near the boat back"], [92, "382 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. of Fort St. Philip, by means of which troops were being landed at the quarantine above us. About 12 o'clock m., one of the enemy's gunboats from below made her appearance, under a flag of truce, bearing a written demand for the surrender of the forts, signed by commander David D. Porter, U. S. N., commanding mortar flotilla. (See attached document S.) The forts refused to surrender. (See attached document T.) About 4 o'clock p. m., the French man-of war Milan, Capt. Clouet commanding, passed up to the city, after asking and obtaining permission to do so. The position of the Lou isiana still remained unchanged. So far, throughout the entire bombardment and final action, the spirit of the troops was cheerful, confident, and courageous. They were mostly foreign enlistments, without any great interests at stake in the ultimate success of the revolution. A reaction set in among them during the lull of the 25th, 26th, and 27th, when therewas no other excitement to arouse them than the fatigue duty of repair ing our damages, and when the rumor was current that the city had surrendered, and was in the hands of the enemy. No reply had been received from the city to my dispatches, sent by couriers, on the 24th and 25th, by means of which I could reassure them. They were still obedient, but not buoyant and cheerful. In consequence, I endeavored to revive their courage and patriotism, by publishing an order to both garrisons, attached hereto as document U. I re gret to state that it did not produce the desired effect. Every thing remained quiet, however, until midnight, when the garrison at Fort Jackson revolted en mass, seized upon the guard and posterns, re versed the field-pieces commanding the gates, and commenced to spike the guns, while many of the men were leaving the fort in the mean time, under arms. All this occurred as suddenly as it was un expected. The men were mostly drawn up under arms, and positively re fused to fight any longer, besides endeavoring by force to bring over the St. Mary's cannoniers, and such other few men as remained true to their cause and country. The mutineers stated that the of ficers intended to hold out as long as possible, or while the pro visions lasted, and then blow up the forts, and every thing in them ; that the city had surrendered, and that there was no further use in fighting ; that the enemy were about to attack by land and water, on three sides at once, and that a longer defence would only prove a butchery. Every endeavor was made by the officers to repress the revolt, and to bring the men to reason and order, but without avail. Officers upon the ramparts were fired upon by the mutineers. in attempting to put a stop to the spiking of the guns."], [93, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 383 I am greatly indebted to the Rev. Father Nachon, for his efforts to quell the mutineers, through some of whom he learned that the revolt had been discussed among them for two days, and yet there was no one man true enough to communicate the fact to his officers. Signals also were said to have been passed between the forts during the night, and while the mutiny was at its height. Being so general among the men, the officers were helpless and powerless to act. Under these circumstances, there was but one course left, viz. : to let those men go who wished to leave the fort, in order to see the number left, and to ascertain what reliance could be placed upon them. About one-half of the garrison left immediately, including men from every company, excepting the St. Mary's cannoniers, volunteers and regulars, non-commissioned officers and privates, and among them many of the very men who had stood last and best to their guns throughout the protracted bombardment and the final action when the enemy passed. It was soon evident that there was no fight in the men remaining behind, that they were completely demoralized, and that no faith or reliance could be placed in the broken detachments of companies left in the fort. In the mean time, we were totally ignorant of the condition of affairs in Fort St. Philip, and as all of our small boats had been car ried away by the mutineers, we could not communicate with that fort till the next morning. As the next attack upon the forts was likely to be a combined operation by land and water, and as Fort St. Philip was the point most threatened, from the nature of the country around it, and from the character of the work itself, with narrow and shallow ditches, and but little relief to the main work, it was self-evident that no reduction could be made in its garrison to strengthen that of Fort Jackson, even if all the men there re mained true. In fact, two additional regiments had been asked for at quarantine, in anticipation of such an attack, to act as a reserve to strengthen the garrisons of both forts. With the enemy above and below us, it will be apparent at once, to any one at all familiar with the surrounding country, that there was no chance of destroy ing the public property, blowing up the forts, and escaping with the remaining troops. Under all these humiliating circumstances, there seemed to be but one course open to us, viz. : to await the approach of daylight, communicate then with the gunboats of the mortar flotilla below, under a flag of truce, and negotiate for a surrender under the terms offered us by Commander Porter, on the 26th inst., and which had previously been declined. April 28th. A small boat was procured, and Lieut. Morse, Post-"], [94, "384 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. adjutant, sent over to convey the condition of affairs to Fort St, Philip, as well as to Capt. Mitchell, on the Louisiana. Capt Mitchell and Lieut. Shyrock, C. S. N., came on shore and discussed the whole question ; after which they left, remarking that they would go on board, and endeavor to attack the enemy above at the quarantine, notwithstanding that reasons had been given, from time to time, for not moving this vessel into her proper position, only a few hundred yards distant. Capts. Squires and Bond, Louisiana artillery, and Lieut. Dixon, commanding the company of C. S. regular recruits, came on shore shortly afterwards from Fort St. Philip, and con curred with us, that, under the circumstances, we could do nothing else than surrender, as they were not at all confident of the garrison there, after the unlooked for revolt at Fort Jackson, although none of their men had left, or openly revolted. \u00bb For these reasons, a flag of truce was sent down to communicate with the enemy below, and to carry a written offer of surrender under the terms offered on the 26th instant. (See attached Docu ment V.) This communication brought up the Harriet Lane and three other gunboats opposite the fort, with white flags at the fore, white flags being displayed from the yards of the flag-masts at both forts, while the confederate flags waved at the mast-heads. While negotiations were pending on the Harriet Lane, it was reported that the the steamer Louisiana, with her guns protruding, and on fire, was drifting down the river towards the fleet. As the wreck, in descending, kept close into the Fort St. Philip shore, the chances were taken by the enemy without changing the position of his boats. The guns of the Louisiana were discharged at random as she floated down, and the boat finally blew up near Fort St. Philip, scattering its fragments everywhere within and around the fort, killing one of our men and wounding three or four others. Capt. Mclntosh, C. S. N., who had been severely wounded in the discharge of his duty on the night of the enemy's passage, and who was then lying in a tent at that fort, was nearly killed also. As far as I could learn, however, the Louisiana was fired prior to the time that the enemy' s boats, with white flags, came to an anchor abreast of the forts to negotiate. She was fired in her first and original position, without any change of any kind since her arrival at the forts. The terms of capitulation are attached hereto as Document W, in addition to which Commander Porter verbally agreed not to haul"], [95, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 385 down the Confederate flag or hoist the Federal, until the officers should get away from the forts. The officers of Fort Jackson and the St. Mary's cannoniers left about 4 o'clock p. m., for the city, on board of the U. S. gunboat Kennebec, and arrived on the morning of the 29th in New Orleans. The officers of Fort St. Philip were sent up the next day, and all the men subsequently, within a few days, as transportation could be furnished, excepting the men who revolted on the night of the 27th, many of whom enlisted with the enemy. Upon my arrival in the city, I found the enemy's vessels were lying off the town, and that no flag, excepting that of the State of Louisiana, on the City Hall, was visible upon the shore. I also learned that flag officer Farra gut had directed it to be hauled down, and the U. S. flag hoisted in its stead, upon the penalty of shelling the city within forty-eight hours, if the demand was not complied with, and that he had warned the city authorities to remove the women and children within the time specified. I therefore deemed it my duty to call at once upon the mayor at the City Hall, and inform him of the fate of the sorts below, which I did accordingly. Learning there, from one of his aids, that the major-general commanding the department was still in the city, I called upon him in person, and verbally reported the main incidents of the bombardment, the passage of the enemy, and the capitulation of the forts. I have the honor to inclose herewith the report of Lieut.-col. E. Higgins, twenty-second regiment Louisiana volunteers, command ing Forts Jackson and St. Philip, and those of the different com pany and battery commanders, together with the surgeon's reports of the killed and wounded. The report of Colonel Sysmauski, commanding the Chalmette regiment at quarantine, has not been received by me, so that I am unable to report upon his operations. I fully indorse the just praise bestowed in the inclosed reports upon the officers at both forts, and warmly return them my thanks. They all distinguished themselves by cool courage, skill, and patriotism throughout the entire bombardment, and by the patient fortitude with which they bore the several trying ordeals of water, fire, and the energetic fury of the enemy's protracted and con tinuous fire. I must also bear testimony to the cheerful courage and prompt and willing obedience with which the men performed their duties throughout the bombardment, and up to the sad night when they took the rash and disgraceful step of rising against their officers, 25"], [96, "386 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. breaking through all discipline, and leading to such disastrous and fatal consequences. I can charitably account for.it only on the grounds of great reaction after the intense physical strain of many weary days and nights of terrible fire, during which they were necessarily subjected to every privation from circumstances beyond our control, but which they had not the moral courage to share and sustain with their officers, all of whom were subjected to the same hardships in every particular. To Lieut.-col. Higgins, commanding the forts, my thanks are especially due, for his indefatigable labors in preparing his heavy batteries, preparatory to the attack, almost in the face of the enemy, and for the quiet, skilful and judicious manner in which he caused them to be fought. He was present everywhere, and did his whole duty well and thoroughly. Capt. M. T. Squires, Louisiana regiment of artillery, as senior officer in charge of Fort St. Philip, under orders of Lieut.-col. Higgins, commanding, fully sustained every anticipation entertained of his gallantry, skill, and efficiency. During the first day's bombardment, when Capt. Anderson was wounded, my aid-de-camp, Lieut. William M. Bridges, Louisiana artillery, volunteered to command the ten-inch columbiads on the main work, and I return him my thanks for the gallant and efficient manner in which he fought them during the rest of the action. I take great pleasure in making personal mention of my volun teer aids, Capt. Wm. Y. Seymour and Capt. Y. R. Smith, for the valuable assistance which they rendered me at all times. My thanks are also due to Doctors Bradbury and Foster, who volun teered their services to assist Assistant Surgeons L. Burk and C. D. Lewis, at Forts Jackson and St. Philip respectively, and most effici ently did they aid in this department. Doctor Bradbury remained at Fort Jackson, until its fall, and was parolled. Doctor Foster, at my request, accompanied the wounded soldiers to the city on the C. S. steamer McRae. Messrs. Fulda, Stickney, and Sergeant Y. R. Poindexter, 4th Mis sissippi volunteers, telegraphic operators, rendered the most valu able services in keeping open our communication above and below, under the most dangerous and difficult circumstances. Although we have failed in our mission of keeping the enemy's fleet from passing the forts, and have been subjected to the deep humiliation of surrendering the charge intrusted to our keeping to the enemies of our country, I must nevertheless state, in common justice to my self and those under my command, that to the very best of our ability, with the means at our disposal, our whole duty was per-"], [97, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 387 formed faithfully, honestly, and fearlessly. If all had to be gone through with again, under similar events and circumstances, I know that we should be forced to the same results and consequences. Great as the disaster is, it is but the sheer result of that lack of cheerful and hearty co-operation from the defences afloat, which we had every right to expect, and to the criminal negligence of not lighting up the river at night, when the danger was imminent, and the movements of the enemy absolutely known, almost to the hour of the final attack. Except for the cover afforded by the obscurity of the darkness, I shall always remain satisfied that the enemy would never have succeeded in passing Forts Jackson and St. Philip. I am, very respectfully, Your obedient servant, J. K. DUNCAN, Brig.-gen., late commanding Coast Defences. New Orleans, La., May 13, 1862. Major J. G. Pickett, Assistant Adjutant-general, Department No. 1, Camp Moore, La. : Major : \u2014 In addition to the foregoing report, I wish to add, that upon the arrival of the paroled enlisted men from Forts Jackson and St. Philip in this city, I endeavored, to the best of my ability, to see that they were properly cared for, until such time as they could be sent out of town. As far as it could be done, they were paid in part for the time due, and arrangements were also made through the city safety committee to have them boarded and lodged temporarily, all with the view of preventing them from going over to the enemy through distress and starvation. In this I was very much assisted by Capt. M. T. Squires and 1st Lieut. L. B. Taylor, Louisiana regiment of artillery. Notwithstanding that they were thus amply provided for, scores of them have been daily going over to the enemy and enlisting since, until now there are but a very few left from either fort not in the ranks 'of the enemy. Although I really did think, at the time of the surrender, that some few of the men were loyal, the facts which have since come to light have perfectly satisfied me that nearly every man in both forts was thoroughly implicated and concerned in the revolt on the"], [98, "388 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. night of the 27th of April, with the exception of the company of St. Mary's cannoniers, composed mostly of planters.

Should any boat of the enemy by any means get above the raft, you must instantly ram it with determination and vigor, at all risks and at every sacrifice. All signal mast-head lights should be kept extinguished at night, or never hoisted.

This vessel was hurried away from New Orleans before the steam power and batteries were ready for service. Without a crew, and in many respects very incomplete, and this condition of things is but partially remedied now, she is not yet prepared to offer battle to the enemy ; but, should he attempt to pass the forts, we will do all we can to prevent it, and it was for this purpose only that she was placed in position where necessity might force her into action, inadequately prepared as she is at this moment."], [100, "390 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. We have now at work, on board, about fifty mechanics, as well as her own crew and those from other vessels, doing work essential to the preparation of the vessel for battle. Under these circumstances, it would, in my estimation, be hazarding too much to place her un der the fire of the enemy. Every effort is being made to prepare -her for the relief of Fort Jackson \u2014 the condition of which is fully felt by me ; and the very moment I can venture to face our enemy with any reasonable chance of success, be assured, general, I will do it, and trust that the result will show you that I am now pursuing the right course.

I feel the importance of affording relief to your command as soon as possible ; but, general, at the same time, I feel, and I know, the importance to the safety of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, and the city of New Orleans, of having this vessel in proper condition before seeking an encounter with the enemy.

One of the large vessels has already been brought up and placed in position. Should the above prove to be the case, it is imperatively and absolutely necessary that the batteries of the Louisiana should be brought into action, as well as those of Forts Jackson and St. Philip. A proper position for the Louisiana would be on the Fort St. Philip side, a short distance below the raft and close to the shore, which will give us three direct and cross fires upon the point of attack.

I trust that you will not lend yourself to the further injury of their interests, where it can only entail calamity and bloodshed, without any possible hope of success or relief to your forts.

S., which has been for some weeks in the river, making preparation for an attack on these forts, commenced the bombardment of Fort Jackson. Fire from their mortar fleet was opened at 9 o'lock a. m. The force employed by the enemy against us consisted of twenty-one mortar vessels and a fleet of about twenty-one steam vessels of war, carrying more than two hundred guns of the heaviest calibre. The mortar vessels, when they opened fire, were all concealed from our view save six, which took position in sight of the forts^ind within our ' longest range. These we soon forced to retire. They joined the"], [114, "404 official reports of battles. rest of their fleet behind the point of woods, and, concealed from view, renewed their fire. V1CVT, 1C1IC1VCU LMCII lilC. Orders had been issued to the officers and men of my command to retire to the casemates of the forts the moment the bombard ment commenced. The order being obeyed, nothing was left for us to do but receive the furious storm of shell which was hailed upon us. Our citadel was soon destroyed by fire. All the build ings around and in connection with the sort shared the same fate. From Friday morning until the following Thursday, we sustained this terrible battering. Several times during the bombardment the enemy's gunboats attempted to pass up the river, tinder cover of their mortar fire, and on each occasion our batteries were promptly manned, and the enemy's advance gallantly repelled. At half past three a. m., on Thursday, it was observed that the mortar fire was increased to an intensity of fury which had not been previously reached. At the same time a movement was ob served in the steam fleet below. Our batteries were instantly in readiness, and were at once epgaged in a most terrific conflict with the enemy's fleet of fourteen steamships, which, dashing by the fort in the darkness of the night, pouring in their broadsides of shot, shell, grape, canister, and shrapnel, succeeded in getting beyond our range and in our rear. During the forenoon a demand was made by Commodore Porter, commanding the mortar fleet, for a surrender of the forts. This proposition was promptly refused, and the bombardment was again commenced and continued until four p. m., when all firing ceased. I inclose you the reports of company and battery commanders, also the surgeon's report of killed and wounded. I fully indorse the encomiums of the company commanders upon the officers under their command, and feel myself bound to record my high admiration of the coolness, courage, and fortitude of all the officers of both sorts. Capt. J. B. Anderson, company \" G,\" Louisiana artillery, was wounded early in the conflict, while heroically fighting his guns. Notwithstanding his severe wound, he rendered the most gallant and efficient service to the last. Capt. W. B. Robertson, who commanded a detached work called the water battery, remained with his command during the whole of the protracted ordeal, without cover of any kind, although suffering from severe physical disease, and scarcely able, at times, to walk around his btttery. He was most ably and gallantly assisted -by Capt. R. J. Brnce, Louisiana artillery."], [115, "OFFICIAL reports of battles. 405 First Lieut. Eugene W. Baylor, who was in command of the 42 pounder barbette battery, and First Lieut. Richard Agar, of the same, battery, did all that gallant officers and men could do. The officers stationed at the heaviest batteries, on the river front, were, the greater part of the time, fatigued as they were, obbged to be constantly with their detachments at their guns to prevent surprise. Lieuts. A. N. Ogden, Bevuet Kennedy, and William T. Mumford, of the Louisiana artillery, particularly distinguished them. selves in this service. Although not under my immediate command, I cannot omit to mention the devoted conduct of your aid-de-camp, Lieut. Wm. M. Bridges, who, upon the disability of Capt. Anderson, immediately volunteered his services, and took charge of the two 10-inch colum biads, and fought them night and day with ceaseless energy. Lieut. J. U. Gains, in command of the 32-pounder battery, on the river front, assisted by Lieut. E. D. Woodlief, Capt. S. Jones, company \" I,\" Louisiana volunteers, Capt. F. Peter, company \" I,\" 22d regiment, Louisiana volunteers, fought their batteries gallantly and well. Lieut. Thomas K. Pierson, 23d Louisiana volunteers, was killed in the thickest of the fight, while gallantly fighting his guns. The St. Mary's Cannoniers, Capt. S. O. Comay, have my warmest gratitude and admiration for their whole conduct, both in face of the enemy, and in the severe and arduous fatigue duties, which they discharged, always and at all times, with alacrity and energy. They are an honor to the country, and well may their friends and relations be proud of them. The report of Capt. M. T. Squires, who was the senior officer at Fort St. Philip, is inclosed, with the reports of the other officers. Capt. Squires fought the batteries of Fort St. Philip most gallantly. He was in charge of that fort during the whole bombardment. The severe work at Fort Jackson required my constant presence there. I had every confidence in the coolness, courage, and skill of Capt. Squires and his officers, and most satisfactorily did they discharge their duties. I refer you to his report for the mention of the indi vidual conduct of his officers. The floating battery \" Louisiana,\" the steam ram Manassas, and the Confederate steamer McRae, together with a number of vessels which had been fitted up by the Confederate and State, Governments, were in the river above the forts at the time the enemy dashed by. I am unable to state what assistance, if any, was rendered by the greater portion of these. At daylight I observed the McRae gal lantly fighting, at terrible odds, contending, at close quarters, with"], [116, "406 official reports of battles. two of the enemy's powerful ships. Her gallant commander, Lieut. Thomas B. Huger, fell, during the conflict, severely, but, I trust, not mortally wounded. The Manassas I observed under weigh, apparently in pursuit of one of the vessels of the enemy, but I soon lost sight of her. I would here observe, that I think an investigation should be de manded into the conduct of the authorities afloat, whose neglect of our urgent entreaties to light up the river during this sad night contributed so much to the success of our enemies. My adjutant, Lieut. C. N. Morse, was indefatigable iu the discharge of his important duties, which required his constant presence near my person, and has my sincere thanks. Surgeon Sommerville Burke, C. S. A., and Dr. Bradbury (who kindly volunteered his services when he became aware of the attack on the forts), were unremitting in their attention to the wounded, fearlessly exposing themselves, at all time,s, in the discharge of their duties. Lieut. Charles Warmes, ordnance officer, distinguished himself by the self-sacrificing attention to' arduous and important duties. Day and night he was at his post, and, by his great exertions, our maga zine was saved from being flooded, the water having risen consider ably above the floor. Lieuts. Mann and Royster, of Capt. Ryan's company, rendered fearless and efficient service. Capt. Ryan was with a detachment of his company, on board the \"Louisiana,\" during a portion of the bombardment, and in the fight of Thursday morning. At all times his services were most promptly rendered. Mr. James Ward rendered me the most important services during the bombardment. In charge of the firemen, he made almost super human exertions during the burning of the citadel. He has my warmest gratitude.

Bridges, Aid-de-camp and A. A. A.-gen., Id Brigade : Sir : \u2014 I have the honor to report, that on the morning of the 27th April 1862, a formal demand for the surrender of Forts Jack son and St. Philip was made by Com. David D. Porter, commanding U. S. mortar fleet. The terms which were offered were of the most liberal nature ; but so strong was I in the belief that we could resist successfully any attack which could be made upon us, either by land or water, that the terms were at once refused. Our fort was still strong. Our damage had been, to some extent, repaired. Our men had behaved well, and all was hope and confidence- with the officers, when, suddenly, at midnight, I was aroused by the report that the garrison had revolted, had seized the guard, and were spiking the guns. Word was sent us, through the sergeants of companies, that the men would fight no longer. The company officers were immediately dispatched to their commands, but were driven back. Officers were fired upon when they appeared in sight upon the parapet. Signals were exchanged by the mutineers with Fort St. Philip. The mutiny was complete, and a general massacre of the officers, and a disgrace ful surrender of the fort, appeared inevitable. By great exertion, we succeeded, with your influence, in prevent ing this disgraceful blot upon our country, and were fortunate in keeping the passion of the men in check, until we could effect an honorable surrender of the forts, wThich was done by us, jointly, on the morning of the 28th inst. As the facts and documents relating to this matter are in your possession, it is unnecessary for me to dwell longer on this humiliat ing and unhappy affair. I wish to place on record here the noble conduct of Capt. Comay's company, the St. Mary's cannoniers \u2014 who alone stood true as steel, when every other company in Fort Jack son basely dishonored their country. I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, Your obedient servant, ED. HIGGINS, Lieut.-col. C. S. A., Late commander Forts Jackson and St. Philip."], [118, "408 official reports of battles. Report of Captain M. T. Squires. Fort St. Philip, April 27th, 1862. Lieut. Charles N. Morse, Post-adjutant, Fort Jackson, Louisiana : Sir : \u2014 I have the honor respectfully to submit the following re port: Early on the morning of Friday, the 18th instant, perceiving by the movements of the enemy, that they were about taking up their position, the heavy guns were ordered to open upon them, to annoy them in the execution of their purpose as much as possible ; but the distance being great, and the range extreme, with but very little success, the enemy taking little or no notice of our fire, only answer ing by a few rifle shells, at long invervals. The 1 3 -inch mortar after the 13th round became useless, the bed giving way under it, break ing in two, and the mortar coming upon the ground. The enemy retired from our sight at 8 o'clock p. m., and nothing more was heard of him that night. At an early hour of the morning of the 19th instant, the enemy again took up a position identical with that of the previous, except ing that no mortar boats were on this shore, all keeping close behind the point of woods, and opening fire upon Fort Jackson, which was allowed to continue without interruption from this side. Fearing the effect, and having ascertained the exact range and distances, determined to open upon them, and draw off some of the fire to this side, if possible. It was immediately done, and with partial success, three of the mortar boats opening upon us with but little effect. On the 20th, 21st, and 22d, the fire of the enemy still continued from their mortar boats, with an occasional shot from the gunboats. The only damage done, during these days, was the damaging the platform of the 24-pounder gun in salient near main magazine, the shell passing under, and throwing it up, but not rendering it use less. Our fire was slow and deliberate, with no visible results more than the driving back of two of the mortar boats, which were par tially exposed around the wooded point. The fire of the enemy, although warm, well-directed, and sustained, was, for the most part, either short or very much over. Up to this time, the only guns used were the columbiad battery in the main work, and the 1 3-inch"], [119, "official reports of battles. 409 mortar, disabled on the first day. In the lower water battery, one 8-inch columbiad and one 7-inch rifle gun, worked by Capt. R. C. Bond's company; four 10-inch sea coast mortars, by Capt. J. H. Lamon's company. On the 23d, the enemy still kept up a regular fire, to which we did not reply all day. At 3 1-2 o'clock of the morning of the 24th, the men were ready, and standing at their guns, having received information that there was a movement by the enemy. No vessels were to be seen, and the first notice of an enemy nearing us was the reply to the shots from Fort Jackson, and the gunners were ordered to fire by the flashes of the enemy's guns, which was done, but the fire was entirely too high, and passed over them. Immediately after this, a vessel came in sight, and they followed each other in rapid succession, seemingly in pairs, one of the two keeping back far enough to enable her to deliver her fire from her broadsides. The fire from our guns was rapid, and from the little that could be seen and heard, was accurate, but aster the first discharge, the smoke almost hid them from sight, and we were again compelled to judge by the flashes of their guns. As to the effect of the fire, it is impossible to state what it was, as the dark ness, aided by the smoke, rendered seeing out of the question. A three masted propeller ran ashore during, the engagement, above the upper water-battery, and remaining there several minutes with a fire-barge alongside, her rigging had caught fire, but was im mediately extinguished. We were not able to open upon her, as one of the columbiads had been previously dismounted, and the other could not be brought to bear, besides, their hands were full with other vessels coming up, and the 24-pounder in the salient of the upper water-battery, bearing directly upon her, had been broken in too near the trunnions. The vessels passed close under our guns, taking advantage of the eddy, which runs up with considerable force, and it was found impossible to get more than one or two shots at any one vessel, they passed with such rapidity. All our guns were worked with courage, energy and skill, except ing the upper water battery, where some confusion arose, caused by the men not being so thoroughly drilled as they should have been. Company C, of the Confederate Recruits, Lieut. J. K. Dixon, were fully prepared to work the guns of this battery, and would have done so with effect, but were two days before ordered on board the floating battery \" Louisiana,\" and their place was supplied by Capt. Assanheimer's Company B, 24th regiment Louisiana Volunteers, who had only been drilled a few times, and Capt. Massicott's com pany D, Chalmette regiment, who were raw undrilled, perfectly"], [120, "410 official reports of battles. ignorant even of the use of the shot guns with which they were armed, and had never been drilled at artillery. As soon as it was seen that the guns did not open, Lieut. A. J. Quigly, with such men as could be gathered, was sent to attend to them, which was done, so far as they were concerned, to the satisfaction of that officer. The company of Confederate recruits, under Lieuts. Dixon and Blow, were detailed to report to Capt. Mitchell, C. S. Navy, for duty on board the \" Louisiana,\" as per instructions dated head quarters Forts Jackson and St. Philip, April 21st, 1862, where they remained until the evening of the 24th instant. Capt. Lartigue's company did good service as scouts and sharpshooters, many of them being out at all times. On the night of the 23d, seven of them wrere sent to ascertain the movements of the enemy, and all returned without accomplishing any thing. Two other scouts, one from company K, and the other of company F, were out on the same mission, and had it not been from the failure of the rockets, which by an accident became wet, would have signalled their ap proach much sooner. As it was, the only intimation I received was the firing of one of their muskets. The following is the number of projectiles used, &c. : six hundred and seventy-five (675) 8-inch solid shot, one hundred and seventy-one (171) 8-inch shells, thirteen 13-inch from columbiad battery, &c, in main work; one hundred and forty-two 10-inch mortar shells from lower mortar battery,^four hundred and seventy shot, shell, and grape, lower water battery ; one hundred and twenty shot, grape, and canister, from upper water battery. Capt. R. C. Bond, assisted by 1st Lieuts. Carleton Hunt and Wm. E. Ellis, and his company K, Capt. J. H. Lamon, with the assistance of 1st Lieut. H. W. Fowler, with his company C, in the lower battery, manning the 42 and 32-pounders respectively ; Lieuts. Lewis B. Taylor and W. B. Jones, with company F, at the columbiad battery, and Lieut. A. J. Quigly, with supernumeraries of company F, taken from main work to man guns of upper water battery, behaved with gallantry, energy, coolness, and bravery, worthy of imitation ; and all, both officers and men, deserve the highest praise that could be given to anyone, for the honorable part they performed during the whole time since the commence ment of this trying conflict. Capt. Chas. Assanheimer's company B, did their best, both his officers and men. Individual acts of heroism are numerous, but where all did so well, it would appear invidious to mention names. Suffice it to say, that were every thing to be done again, or any thing else required to be performed, one could ask no other privilege than to have the same men to do it \u2014"], [121, "OFFICIAL REPORT8 OF BATTLES. 411 feeling satisfied it would be as well carried out as possible. The injury to the fort was slight. Of the guns, one banded 7-inch rifle was bursted by the explosion of a shell in its bore near the muzzle, and one 24-pounder gun was broken in two about 14 inches in front of the trunnions, by being struck by a solid shot. An 8-inch columbiad was dismounted, but only temporarily useless, the gun being uninjured and soon remounted. The platform of one 24 pounder gun was undermined by a shell, but not rendered entirely useless. One of the uprights of a 42-pounder gun-carriage was partially shot away, but can still be of service.

Ten 42-pounders, intended for this bat tery, were turned over to the navy for the defence of New Orleans by water. This has been considered as depending upon the forts men tioned, which are well constructed, permanent works, rather well armed, and far stronger than any other that could be hastily erected. With this view, all the available material, both of guns and ammu nition, had been concentrated there prior to the bombardment, and during its continuance was being added to in such quantities daily as the means of the department admitted of, it being evident that"], [124, "414 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. the decisive struggle was there to be made. As soon, therefore, as it became certain that the large vessels of the enemy had succeeded in passing, there no longer existed a chance of preventing them from reaching New Orleans, and the short resistance made by the few guns mounted in the two batteries of the interior lines was made through a sense of duty, but without any expectation of success, the enemy numbering as many vessels, less one, as we had guns. On the side of the river, where I was in person during the action, were stationed three companies of Lieut.-col. Pinckney's battalion of sharpshooters. With the five guns on the other side, were Capt. Patton's company of the 22d Louisiana volunteers, one company from Fort Pike, flnder Lieut. Butter, one company, Beauregard bat tery, besides two battalions of infantry collected in camp for in struction, as well as to guard the line in case of the enemy's landing and attacking by land \u2014 all under immediate command of Gen. Buisson. The enemy's vessels had approached to within about the fourth of a mile before we opened on them, the first gun being from Pinck ney's battery, and immediately followed by several from the battery on the opposide side, and as promptly replied to from the enemy's vessels. The engagement lasted until every round of ammunition on hand was fired, both officers and men displaying a coolness and intrepidity that was gratifying, especially as regards the men, who then for the first time in their lives discharged a heavy gun. The firing on our side was spirited, perhaps a little uncertain ; on the enemy's, heavy and well directed. During the engagement their vessels gradually lessened the dis tance, until near enough to open with grape and canister. The ammunition being expended, and every sense of duty satis fied, permission was given to Col. Pinckney to withdraw his com mand along the line of field works affording shelter, which was done deliberately, officers and men retiring together. The casualties were one killed and one wounded. The battery on the Chalmette side seemed well served, and no doubt was so, judging from the character of the officers present. The enemy, steaming up between us and the city, prevented the retreat of the troops to that point. They were accordingly direct ed to gain the Opelousas railroad and reach Camp Moore via La fourche, or such route as might be found best. Lieut.-col. Pinck ney has already reported with his command, but somewhat reduced in numbers. In concluding this report, I wish particularly to call attention to"], [125, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 415 the admirable assistance rendered by Lieuts. McDonald and B. M. Harrod, on engineer duty, both before and after the action. Their conduct could not have been better. Lieut. Frost, on special duty, was also of material assistance, but in carrying out some instruc tions, was accidently absent during the engagement. Having received no report from Gen. Buisson concerning the operations on his side of the river, I am unable to refer to them more particularly. Respectfully submitted. M. L. SMITH, Brig^gen. commanding 3rd Brigade. REPORT OF THE AFFAIR AT SOUTH MILLS REPORT OF MAJOR-GEN. HUGER. Head-quarters Department or Norfolk, Norfolk, Va., April 28, 1862. Gen. R. E. Lee, Commanding, etc. : General : \u2014 I have received through Brig.-gen. Blanchard, com manding 3d brigade, the reports of Col. A. R. Wright, and Col. Ferebee, commanding the drafted North Carolina militia, and Lieut. D. A. French, who succeeded to the command of the battery after the death of its gallant captain, McComas. I would forward these re ports to you at once, but there are some discrepancies and omissions in them which I desire first to have corrected, and will therefore try to make a brief statement from these reports, to give you and the War Department information concerning this severe and well-sought action, which was successful, inasmuch as the enemy failed to ac complish his object, and was obliged to retire to his vessels with great loss. I send herewith a sketch of the country between South Mills and Elizabeth City, showing the position of the battle. All the forces under the command of Col. Wright were the 3d regiment Georgia volunteers, some drafted militia, under Col. Fere bee, of North Carolina, (Col. Ferebee omits to state in his report how many he had on duty,) McComas' battery of arttllery, 1 1 rifled"], [126, "416 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. pieces and 3 bronze 6-pounders, and one company of cavalry \u2014 Capt. Gillette's Southampton company. On Friday, the 18th, I had or dered forward the 32d N. C. regiment, (Col. Brabbles,) and the 1st Louisiana regiment, (Col. Vincent's,) but they did not arrive until after the battle. On Friday, the 18th, Col. Wright occupied South Mills with three companies of his regiment, 160 strong, and the drafted North Corolina militia. Two companies at the intrenchments at Richard son's Mills, 125 effectives, and five companies, about 300 men, and McComas' battery of artillery at Elizabeth City. On Friday even ing, anticipating the enemy's advance, and in compliance with my instructions to concentrate his forces at or near South Mills, he ordered the companies at Elizabeth City to retire nine miles to Richardson's Mills. From some cause not yet explained, these companies did not leave Elizabeth City until after day-light on Satur day morning. The cavalry companies from Camden court-house reported at 8 1-2 o'clock on the 19th, the enemy approaching, hav ing then passed the court-house. Col. Wright moved forward with his three companies, and at 9 1-2 was met by Capt. McComas, with his battery. After advancing three miles from South Mills, the road emerged from the woods, and the fields on the right and left extended 160 to 180 yards to thick woods and swamp. On the edge of the woods on both sides of the road, and perpendicular to it, was a small ditch, the earth from which was thrown up on the south side in a ridge, upon which was a heavy rail fence. From this point the road led through a narrow lane (Sawyer's lane) for one mile, with cleared land on both sides of it. Here he deter mined to make his stand. About three hundred yards from the woods ran a deep, wide ditch, parallel with the one first mentioned, and extending to the woods on either side of the road, and a short distance beyond it were dwellings and outhouses which would give cover to the enemy. Col. Wright therefore ordered them burnt. The large ditch in his front he filled with fence rails and set them on fire, his , object being to have this ditch so hot by the time the enemy came up they could not occupy it. (A). This ditch is marked on sketch as \" roasted ditch.\" Two pieces of artillery (the road was too narrow for more) were placed in the road just where it emerged from the woods, which commanded the road with the range of the guns. He also threw down the fence for 300 yards in front of the guns, and tossed the rails into the road to destroy the effect of the enemy's ricochet fir ing, and to deprive him of the cover of the fences. The fences on"], [127, "417 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. the sides of the woods were taken down and laid in heaps on the embankment in front of his men. All these arrangements were made, and it was 11 o'clock before he was joined by Lieut.-col. Reed and the seven companies from below. Two of these, under Major Lee, were placed at River bridge, with one piece of McCo mas' artillery, with directions to destroy it and stop the enemy there if he should attempt to get into our rear by coming up the west side of the river. Lieut.-col. Read and three companies 3d Georgia, (and by Col. Ferebee's report, the North Carolina militia,) were placed about a mile in the rear at the meeting of an old road, to protect that passage and serve as a reserve. The remaining five companies were deployed in open order across the road on the right and lest of the artillery, protected by the ditch and fence rails on the banks. The smoke from the burning buildings and fences was rolled towards the enemy, thus masking the position. At fif teen minutes before 12 o'clock the front of a heavy column of the enemy was seen passing through the smoke, and Capt. McComas opened a destructive fire on them, which checked their advance for half an hour, when they again approached under the fire of a 12 pounder, but soon retired entirely out of sight in considerable cdn fusion. Up to three o'clock thrice had the heavy columns of the enemy been beaten back by the heavy fire of Capt. McComas' artil lery, and our only casualties one man wounded and one wheel injured. At 15 minutes after 3 p. m., the enemy again advanced and de ployed two regiments to their right, our left. Three regiments, after advancing towards us, were driven back by the well-directed fire of Capt. McComas' artillery, and Capts. Nesbitt's and Mus grove's companies. Capt. MoWhirter's fire also caused the Zouaves on our right to retire, and this attack ceased by 25 minutes before 4. Our loss up to this time was very slight, while that of the ene my was very severe, as we could plainly see them fall, and they had raised the hospital flag on a building in rear of their line. They soon advanced again, two regiments skirting the woods on our left, and approached near enough to engage the skirmishers. One com pany from the right was moved over, and Col. Reed ordered to send one company from the reserve. The enemy deployed in the open field, and bore down rapidly, but the heavy fire ofemusketry caused them to waver, and they fled back to the fence. Three regi- ments and a field piece were in the centre, and the 9th New York regiment on the right. The fire was now brisk from one end of the line to the other, and the enemy were held in check, when, just at this moment, Capt. McComas was killed by a minie ball, and his 27"], [128, "418 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. men, who, for four hours, had fought with most indomitable cour age, became panic-stricken, and left the field, taking their pieces with them. Col. Wright succeeded in rallying them and getting two pieces and a few men in position, and the enemy had advanced so close that canister was fired on them with effect, and they again fell back. The ammunition in the limber boxes was exhausted, and during the temporary absence of Col. Wright, the artillery left the field. The enemy made a charge upon our line, but the steady fire, at close distance, (Col. Wright estimates it at 50 yards,) caused them to break in confusion, and they fell back. Taking advantage of their confusion, Col. Wright now fell back in good order to intrenchments on Joy's creek, about two miles in his rear, and called in Lieut.-col. Read's and Major Lee's commands, and there awaited the enemy, who, it appears, were so badly injured, that they made no advance, but at about 8 p. m. began to retreat to their boats. At this time I am informed that several companies of the 32d North Carolina regiment joined Col. Wright, who, dur ing the night retired from this position to the N. W. Lock. Col. Wright states his loss at six killed, nineteen wounded, and three taken prisoners. The enemy's loss he estimates as very large, as high as 300. Col. Wright states that the regiments opposed to him were the 9th, 21st and 89th New York, and the 21st Massa chusetts, 6th New Hampshire, and 51st Pennsylvania regiments, (we have prisoners or wounded of five of these regiments,) the whole commanded by Brig.-gen. Reno. Among the killed he is grieved to announce the loss of Capt. McComas, an estimable gentleman, and brave and skilful officer, whose conduct throughout the action elicited the highest praise. All the command engaged behaved in the most gallant manner, standing firmly against overwhelming odds, until ordered to fall back to our intrenchments. They maintained their position over five hours, and killed and disabled more of the enemy than we had in action. On returning to the field next day, we recovered 1100 pounds powder, and the arms, accoutrements, tools, etc., left by the enemy. I have already reported his leaving such wounded as he could not remove, and I have sent them to Fortress Monroe on parole. Some ten or twelve stragglers were taken on the 20th, and held as prisoners of war. I will forward the original reports as soon as they are corrected, and meanwhile submit this as a summary.

Brig.-gen. Leadbetter, Commanding. Head-quarters 1st Brigade, East Tenn., Chattanooga, May 5, 1862. To Major H. L. Clay, Assistant Adjutant-general : Major : \u2014 I have the honor to report that the enemy, eleven or twelve hundred strong, advanced against Bridgeport on the 29th ult. My command, guarding the bridges at that place, consisted of 450 infantry of the newly raised regiments, the Georgia 39th and 43d, with 150 cavalry employed only as scouts. The infantry was posted on the heights in advance of the West bridge, about 500 yards distant, leaving a rear guard of 50 men near the bridge end and on either side of it, covered by musketry breastworks. Two iron six-pounders, old guns, had been placed in the position last named, but were withdrawn as soon as the enemy's advance had developed itself as an attack. You are aware that a defence of the place by a small force was very difficult. The two bridges, with the high railroad embank ment between them, were a mile and a quarter long, extending in one straight line towards the heights before mentioned, and these heights were of far too great extent to be properly occupied and held by our forces. The enemy could advance in any direction on our front and flanks, and cut off our troops from the bridge, or else drive them to a disastrous retreat, under a fire destructive to their only avenue of escape. To have placed our men at the bridge end and along the river bank, would have been to subject them to a plunging fire from the heights, together with the disadvantages be fore mentioned. On the island, or at the east shore of the river, they would have occupied low ground and been unable to protect the West bridge against surprise and destruction. Finding, at 5 p. m., that the enemy were near at hand, the two guns were removed on a platform car, and immediately after, the troops were defiled"], [134, "420 official reports of battles. across, the rear guard only remaining. At this time I crossed at the east end of the West bridge, in order to see that every thing was prepared for blowing up a span ; and while examining the magazine within the bridge, tiie enemy opened fire, apparently with a rifled gun and howitzer. Ascending to the roadway, I found the rear guard crossing the bridge at double-quick, and at the same time observed some ten or twelve of our scouts at six or eight hun dred yards south-west of the bridge end, hastening to cross. After waiting a reasonable time, and finding that they had apparently decided not to move, I ordered the fuse to be shortened and fired. This was done by Lieut. Margraves, of the sappers and miners, assisted by one man of his company. The charge which wa# ex ploded, consisted of two hundred pounds of powder in one mass, but from the difficulty of confining it, the effect was not such as had been hoped for, and the span did not fall. I determined, there fore, to carry out the spirit of your instructions, and to burn the East bridge. With the assistance of Capt. Kane, of the artillery, and Lieut. Margraves, it was soon in flames and impassable to the enemy. During the retreat of the rear guard and the burning of the bridge, the enemy kept up a warm fire of shells along the line of the track, but fortunately with little effect. Only two of our infantry were hit and slightly wounded by fragments. Finding that the enemy was advancing his guns upon the island, and direct ing his fire towards our encampment, which had never been removed to the west bank, the tents were ordered to be struck and be pre pared to move. This was an immediate necessity, and regarding the position there untenable, I determined to evacuate it. As the receipt of supplies depended on the integrity of the railroad track to Chattanooga, and the road at several points touches the river bank, it would have been easy for the enemy to cross above us, destroy the track or bridges, or else plant his guns on the opposite side so as to command the road, closing it to the passage of trains. We would thus have been compelled to retire, perhaps across the mountain eastward, leaving the road to Chattanooga open. I preferre*d to retire to Chattanooga, disembarrassing our selves of sick, wounded, and baggage, and then returning to a favorable point on the road, hold the enemy under observation, always hoping for reinforcements. If he advanced, it was reasonably expected it would be with his whole force of 5,000 men. Being unable to find the telegraph or the operator, removed from Bridge port in the retreat, and esteeming it my duty to communicate to you, at the earliest practicable moment, this movement of the"], [135, "official reports of battles. 421 enemy, I came up on the train of that evening, bringing up the sick, some men unfortunately wounded by railroad accident, and about half of the command. A train was sent down for the remainder as soon as possible, and it brought up also the baggage. Before the attack, two old iron 6-pounders of Kane's battery had been planted on the east bank, in the only place available, but very difficult of access, and were abandoned under the enemy's fire and the heat of the burning bridge. The dispositions made occupied the 30th, and as our whole force, 450 men, composed the brigade of Col. A. W. Reynolds, then serving on court martial, but naturally anxious to be in the field, I ordered him forward to Whiteside, a strong position fourteen miles towards Bridgeport, .on the 1st inst. He was directed to observe the enemy, and to retard his advance if practicable. In the mean time I had been advised by Col. Glenn, under date of the 30th, at Dalton, that he would bring on his un armed regiment as soon as transportation could be procured, and he was confidently expected on the 1st instant. It was necessary to collect the arms belonging to the sick of the 39th and 40th Georgia regiments, and with them to arm Col. Glenn's command. This I undertook, with the purpose of moving on promptly to Col. Rey nolds' support. Col. Glenn arrived on the 2d, and was soon armed and supjilied with ammunition, but the tenor of Col. Reynolds' dis patches during the day was such, as to lead me to think it judicious to hold the regiment disposable, lest the enemy should move up on the west side, and attempt to cross near Chattanooga. About 10 o'clock that night, I received from him the following dispatch : General Leadbetter : Scouts came in from Kelly's Ferry, reported on reliable informa tion that the enemy, five thousand strong, had crossed at Shell Mound. A. W. REYNOLDS, Colonel commanding. I answered : If you are satisfied your information is reliable, burn all the bridges on the railroad and country roads, and fall back with your command to Lookout Mountain. I will meet you there with Col. Glenn's regiment. W. LEADBETTER, Brigadier-general. The point indicated is close to the Tennesse river, where the rail road and all the country roads intersect each other. To this, dis patch, the Colonel replied that he would move accordingly. About"], [136, "422 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 4 o'clock A. m., of the 3d, we met there, and having selected the best line of defence, too extensive, however, for our force, I placed the men in position, and a bridge on the country road over Look out creek, in front, was burned. I also ordered the railroad bridge over the same creek to be burned, as soon as our pickets should have come in. Col. Reynolds then proceeded to town. This rail road bridge was actually not burned till late in the day, but I was on the mountain, and supposed it had been destroyed early. After receiving positive information, therefore, at 1 P. m., that the force of the enemy on this side of the river was small, the order for the destruction of the bridge was not countermanded. It will be restored by means of trestle work in a few days. The series of events, thus related, has excited the utmost indigna tion of a terrified people, and no abuse, whether of a personal or official bearing, has been spared me. Aware, as I am, that all the troops under your command were required at other points, and that yon expected the approach of the enemy to be retarded in this quarter, mainly by the destruction of the bridges, I shall endeavor to endure this storm of obloquy, with such equanimity as may be vouchsafed to me. On Saturday morning, the enemy set fire to the west bridge at Bridgeport, and it was wholly destroyed. Soon after, they evacu ated the place precipitately, and at the last advices from Stevenson, were hastening their departure from that point. I am, sir, very respectfully, Your obedient servant, D.

E. Lee, Commanding, <&c, Richmond: General : In my last letter I advised you that the opportune re- turn of Brig.-gen. Heth with his force to Dublin depot rendered it unnecessary for me to proceed in that direction. But I ventured to suggest to that officer, that a lateral movement, by me, cutting the line of the enemy's communication at Princeton, might assist him materially in clearing the country of the column which was en- deavoring to penetrate to the railroad. Gen. Heth approving the idea, I moved my whole force at once, via Saltville, towards this place, arriving here on the 12th instant. I took the responsibility of ordering to the field some skeleton companies, just recruited, and intended to form part of a new regiment, authorized by an order of the Secretary of War, of 9th April, issued to Major McMahon, formerly Gen. Floyd's Aid-de-camp. This corps, composed of seven companies, so called, did not number more than four hundred men, and none of them were trained at all. Under my order, they elected a lieutenant-colonel, for the time, only to lead them on this expedi- tion. I also took the responsibility of placing in their hands the old muskets turned in to Gen. Dimmock by Col. Trigg, which I found at Abingdon. I left Abingdon with a force composed of the 54th Virginia, six hundred men ; the 29th Virginia, four hundred and twenty men ; (four companies, wholly recruits, three raised by me this spring, and one by Lieut. March) ; the 5th Kentucky, five hun- dred men ; Dunn's battalion of recruits, four hundred men ; Brad ley's Mounted Kentucky Rifles, about two hundred and seventy-five men, making an aggregate of two thousand one hundred and nine ty-five men, to which, add Jeffree's battery of six pieces, manned by recruits almost entirely."], [138, "424 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. Gen. Heth desired a delay of a day or two to reorganize the com panies in Floyd's brigade, which were under his command. Having dispatched couriers to Col. Wharton, directing him to meet me in Princeton, on the night of the 16th, by advancing from Rocky Gap; and, having informed Gen. Heth (who was in position at the mouth of Wolf creek), that he should attack the enemy at the mouth of East river, on the morning of the 17th, I put my column in motion on the 15th, and reached Princeton on the night of the 16th. My advance was unexpected by Brig.-gen. Cox, who had his head-quarters and body guard at Princeton at the time, with a force variously estimated at from five hundred to twelve hundred men \u2014 the former probably nearer the truth than the latter. The pickets of the enemy were encountered by my advance guard about four miles from Princeton, and a skirmish continued from that place, through the woodlands and brushwood, to a point something over one mile from the court-house. This skirmish wTas conducted by the 5th Kentucky, from which I lost Capt. Leonidas Elliott, who fell mortally wounded (since dead) at the head of his company, while bravely beating the enemy back. In this skirmish the enemy lost some sixteen or twenty, who were left on the field. We had only four wounded, including Capt. Elliott. None killed. I directed Col. Trigg to move on the right of the 5th Kentucky and take the enemy in flank, and so to press on to Princeton. Arriving at the hill (subsequently occupied by me), from which the land drops into the level vale, in which Princeton stands, a halt was ordered by Brig.-gen. Williams, and a line of battle formed, with a view of bringing up the artillery to shell the town from that point. I thought it best to take the place by small arms, and though day light was now nearly gone, I ordered the battalions forward ; Trigg leading to the right ; May next ; Moore's and Bradley's men next, so as to move on the place through the meadows and by the road we had travelled. In half au hour, a sharp, hot fire on the right, an nounced Col. Trigg in contact with the enemy. Fire, from a regi ment, is seldom more steady than this I refer to. Succeeded by a general shout, and then by absolute silence, which lasted at least an hour and a half before I received any message from the troops in front, really, I did not know but that we had met a check, and that regimental' commanders were arranging for a new assault. As every thing had to be left to them, under such circumstances, I waited about half a mile from town, placing ray battery in position, at once, to command the town and our road. I supported the bat tery with Dunn's battalion. After a while I was informed that the"], [139, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 425 enemy had fled before us, leaving his tents, clothes, swords, officers' uniforms, and even the lights burning in his tents. It is probable had we not halted before nightfall, we might have captured many prisoners, possibly the General himself; for I was informed he did not leave town until twilight. But none of us could foresee, and so far as I know, every one acted for the best. The regiments went in with hearty good will and promptly. Major Bradley lost one of his men, Weeden, of Halladay's company^ Trigg had some six men wounded, one of whom, private Carter of company I, was mortally wounded. So the town of Princeton fell into my hands about 10 P. m., on the 16th of May ; the line of the enemy's communication with Raleigh was cut, and the head-quar ters of the \" Kanawa Division\" was abruptly stampeded. A mass of correspondence fell into my hands. Letters and orders, dated from the 10th down to the 16th of May, fully disclose the intentions of the enemy and his strength. I send you several of these for your perusal. I learned from the inhabitants of Princeton that on the morning of the 15th, the two regiments, about 900 men each, had passed through town towards East river, and that two regi ments had been expected to arrive at 8 p. m., from Raleigh, the very evening I came. I had a knowledge that one or more regi ments had passed on to the mouth of East river, by the road from Dunlap, without coming through Princeton. Combining the infor mation I had from the letters captured with the news I received from the people in Princeton, I learned that I was in the neighbor hood of at least four regiments, of which Gen. Heth had no knowl edge. My own position had suddenly become very critical. I had only heard from Col. Wharton that he had not passed East river mountain on the morning of the 15th. He had not arrived at Princeton on the night of the 16th, as I had directed and desired. I did not know the direction in which Gen. Coxhad retired, wheth er to East river or Raleigh ; but whether in the one or the other direction, I had no assurance but that the morrow would find me struggling with my force, more than half of whom were undrilled recruits, against largely superior numbers of well trained troops, of every arm. Gasting about as well as I could at night, to catch an idea of the topography, I found that the ruins of Princeton occu py a knoll in the centre of some open level meadows, entirely sur rounded by woodlands, with thick undergrowth, which fringe the open grounds, and that through the entire circuit about the town, the central position at the court-house can be commanded by the Enfield rifle. Roads lead in through these woods in several direc-"], [140, "426 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. tions. My men had marched 19 miles during the day, had slept none, and were scattered among the houses and tents, to discover what had been lest by the enemy. I at once determined to with draw from the ruins before dawn, and to take position within range of the town site, so as to cover the road by which I entered. This I effected, the dawn finding me in the act of completing the oper ation. My force was marched from the town. After daylight I received a dispatch from Col. Wharton, dated the 16th, at the cross roads, eleven miles from Princeton, promising to come to town by 9 a. m. on the 17th. Before he arrived, the enemy had re-entered the town, a force I could not estimate, but which was provided with artillery, and displayed more than two full regiments. Col. Whar ton arrived in the neighborhood by the road leading in from the cross roads, a little after 9 a. m. The enemy was at the time throw ing forward his skirmishers, to dispute with mine the woods and points overhanging the road, which led in from the cross roads to Princeton, which road ran nearly parallel to the one by which I had advanced. I had written to Col. Wharton to press on, and he would have the enemy in flank. The Col. opened with his single piece of artillery, a little after nine, upon my right, and the batter ies in town and at my position at once opened upon each other at long range. Col. Wharton soon came to me to report his position and force. The force was about 800 men. My estimate is, I now had some 2,800 men, of whom one-half were raw recruits. A regi ment of the enemy coming down from the direction of the cross roads to Princeton, about this time, appeared in the rear of Col. Wharton's command, and were attacked by it furiously. The struggle lasted but a short time. The havoc in the enemy's ranks was terrible. Col. W. reports to me'211 as the dead and wounded of the enemy. I understand that more than 80 bodies were buried on the field. The enemy appeared with a flag of truce, asking to bury their dead, and to remove their wounded. I refused, but hearing, after about an hour, that some officer had allowed it, and that the enemy were then engaged in burying, I directed Brig.-gen. Williams to permit the ambulances of the enemy to pass along my right, for the purpose of carrying away the wounded, also. There was no further battle. I waited for news from Brig.-gen. Heth, or to learn of his approach to Princeton, as the signal for a general engagement with the enemy. If Brig.-gen. Heth had successfully attacked at the mouth of East river iu the morning, as requested to do, he might be hourly expected to communicate his approach to Princeton, by his couriers or his artillery. If he had not attacked,"], [141, "427 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. but was still at the mouth of Wolf creek, it would be imprudent in me to assail the enemy, for the probability was strong that he would hazard the assault himself against any position, attempting to beat me, while he preserved his front against Hetb. If Gen. Heth could, by means of my diversion, get through the narrows of New river, our forces should join the night of the 17th, and then, combined, we could fight on the 18th the whole force of the enemy, and, if successful, could pursue his vanquished column to Raleigh, burn his stores, and press our advantage as far as we desired. This was my reasoning. I would not move upon the town in the evening of the 1 7th ; 1st, because the result would then be problematical, and that problem would likely be favorably solved on the arrival of Gen. Heth's command. A grand result would then be easily obtained. Had I attacked under the circumstances, and had I failed, nothing could have shielded me from condemna tion as a rash officer, who perilled all and lost all, when a few more hours would have doubled his force. I confidently expected at nightfall on the 17th, that the enemy, in superior force, would at tack me in the morning, or that a junction with Gen. Heth would enable me to attack his whole force, which was apparently concen trated around Princeton. He was in plain view under my glass \u2014 his wagons deliberately parked, his regiments exercising, and all the appearances given which indicate the purpose to give battle. My forces were masked to him. He could have no idea of its amount. In this fact was my safety, until Heth could come up. It seems Brig.-gen. Heth did advance to the mouth of the East river, and found the enemy had abandoned tents and camp equipage, both there and at French's, where he had been fortifying. The Gen. passed on until he came within four or five miles of Princeton, on the evening of the 17th, when, hearing in the country from some body that I had been repulsed and was retreating, he fell back in the night to the mouth of East river. His courier arrived at my position, (one mile from the court-house) about 9 a. m., on the 18th, conveying to me the information that Gen. Heth's force was now so required in another direction as to forbid further pursuit of the enemy, with a request to return Col. Wharton to a post in the dis trict of New river, indicated by the General commanding said district. The enemy had, during the night, vacated Princeton, taking the Raleigh road, his rear passing Blue Stone river abofit sun-rise. I ordered my battalion of Mounted-Rifles to follow him. I ascertained that on the night of the 18th he encamped about 10 miles from Princeton, in a very strong position, having some seven"], [142, "428 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. regiments with him in retreat, in all from five to seven thousand men. On the 19th I again sent forward on his line of retreat, and ascertained that he had passed the Flat Top mountains, had burned some of his caissons and gun-carriages, and had abandoned some of his wagons the preceding night. He was now twenty-five miles from Princeton. Nothing was now left to me but to return to the district whose interests are under my charge. I left a company of mounted men at Princeton, with orders to remain until Gen. Heth could relieve them, and with the rest of my command I returned to this point. I left 71 of the enemy wounded in hospital at Prince ton, too badly shot to be moved at all. His surgeons were left in attendance, and a chaplain was permitted to be with them. I re turn a list of 29 prisoners. The men themselves have been march ed to Abingdon, where three others from the same army have been confined, whose names you have already. My quarter-master has made return of our captures, among which I may mention about 35 miles of telegraph wire, horses, mules, saddles, pack-saddles, medical instruments, medicines in panniers, tents, a few stores, 18 head of cattle, a number of wagons, and some excellent muskets and rifles. These last have been taken in charge by my ordnance officers, and will be issued to my command, unless otherwise or dered. Reviewing the whole movement, I have only to regret that Brig. gen. Heth did not join me on the 17th, and did not communicate to me his whereabouts during the day or night. All was accomplished that I anticipated from the movement, except the capture of prisoners. The invasion has been signally repulsed, and the enemy has been demoralized and broken. The country he threatened so imminently has been relieved. It is a triumph of strategy merely, without loss on our part. My list of casualties will only exhibit two killed on the field, and two seriously wounded, who will die ; and some ten or twelve wounded, but not dangerously. The enemy has lost largely ; and indeed I should not be surprised if, in killed and wounded, his loss reaches four hundred. One of his regiments scattered in the woods, threw away guns and uniforms, and its members are daily picked up by the country people. Your obedient servant, H.

My Dear Parents : \u2014 I again sit down, pen in hand, to inform you of my wfiereabouts. I wrote you a letter while I was at Prince ton, inclosing you $10, and, I believe, informing you that the regi ment had left Princeton for Giles Court House, (or, as it is more properly called, Pearisburg.) I was left behind to take care of the tents and office, until the train could come back, and move us on. I left there on the 10th inst., and we had not proceeded but a few miles, when we met a courier with dispatches, saying that our regi ment had been attacked at Pearisburg, and driven back. He said they had retreated about five miles. The rebel force was about 4000, and 6 pieces of artillery. They drove in our pickets about daylight, and as our men had no artillery with them, were obliged to retreat. Therefore, Col. Hayes ordered the regiment to fall back, which was done in good order, our men fighting as they fell back, and fairly mowing the rebels down. As soon as they could get their cannon to bear on us, they commenced shelling us, but they were very poor artillerists, as most of their shells burst 30 feet over the boys' heads. As it was, there was only one man killed, and a number wounded. The regiment would never have been driven back, if our artillery had been sent up when it ought to have been. Our regiment is now encamped about 12 miles from Pearisburg. We will have a very strong force when we move forward again \u2014 enough to take Pearisburg, and go right on to Newbern. There are now here 3 regiments, viz. : 23d, 12th, and 30th, which form the 1st brigade, under Col. E. P. Scammon. There are 6 more regiments expected up here in a day or two, the 26th, 34th, 27th, 48th, 47th, and 25th, which will form the 2d and 3d brigades, besides, about 4 regiments of cavalry, and a num ber of batteries of artillery \u2014 in all, about 12,000 effective men, com manded by Brig.-gen. Cox. The 23d will have the post of honor \u2014 the advance. Our boys captured a quantity of secesh money \u2014 Jeff Davis' scrip, at Pearisburg, in the bank.

I will inclose you one of them. I received a letter from Helen, while at Princeton, the day after I had written one to her. I will write again, soon. Direct your next letter to Pearisburg, Va. Be sure and write the number of the regiment plain, as there are so many of us here, now, there will be a good many mistakes. Write as soon as you can.

Dear Sister : \u2014 I take my pen in hand, to write you a few lines, to let you know where, and how I am. I am well, aud I hope you are the same. I have received three letters from you since I have written one. The reason I don't write oftener is, that I don't have time. I am now in Princeton, Mercer county, Virginia. There are six thousand soldiers here. We expect to have a big battle in two or three days. The secesh are only ten miles from us, well fortified, and ten thousand strong, and they can be reinforced in twelve hours, while we can't get reinforced in twelve days. I think we will have a hard fight of it. If we take them, the fight may be over before you get this. We have marched fifty miles in two days. Our com pany ain't with the regiment now, but we will be to-morrow ; then we will march in on them. The regiments are the 34th, 37th, 28th, 30th, 23d, and 12th, and one battalion cavalry, and two batteries. Henry Secrist is in one of the batteries. I saw all the boys in com pany H ; they are all well. I haven't heard from Marcus or Andrew Griffiin, since I left Barboursville. I would like to hear from them, but I don't know where they are now.

Dear Friend Abner : \u2014 You will please pardon me for not writ ing to you sooner, in answer to yours trom Washington. I did not, however, get it till it was an old letter, as it was directed to Charles ton, and not in care of the regiment, and lay in the post office for some time before I got it. So I thought best to wait till we got on the march, and I might, perhaps, have more of interest to tell you. Well, here we are, within three miles of the enemy, in force, and strongly fortified, with a much larger force than we have now, from what we can learn, and can receive reinforcements at any time, by rail road from Richmond. They would only have to march about twenty-five miles, to get here from Newbern depot. Besides, we are without tents, and but very little provisions, and raining. So, you' see, we are in a deplorable fix, \" ain't we ?\" But we are active foragers, and as long as there is any thing in the mountains to eat, we are not going to starve. And we have got so used to the rain, that we can sleep about as well when tRe rain is pouring down upon us, as when it is clear star-light. So that, notwithstanding the dis- couraging appearance of things, we are in good spirits, and expect to be in Newbern in a few days, and then we will have plenty to eat, tents to sleep in, and ride on the railroad, \" perhaps.\" We left Charleston on the 3d, leaving every thing behind, except what we really had to have. The road, most of the way, is rather rough, being up one mountain side and down the other, the entire way. We found the country very poor, and but few inhabitants on the route ; the houses being of the very poorest description, and many of them being deserted, having been occupied by secesh. We came through Fayetteville, Berkley, and Princeton \u2014 the latter town had been burned by the rebels, on the approach of our advance, they having had several skirmishes on the way. The 23d O. V. I. were in advance, with the 2d battalion, V. V. M. R., and had advanced to Giles, the next county seat, aud had captured a large amount of provisions, etc., but being without artillery support, were driven out the day previous to our arrival, and had to fall back to this point, the mouth of East river, (that is, if I have been correctly in- formed as to the name of the stream, which empties into New river here.) We are within about eight miles of Giles, and we have to go through what is called the Narrows \u2014 a passage through a very high mountain range, through which New river runs \u2014 the road running with the river. At this place, the rebels are now fortified, 28"], [148, "434 official reports of battles. and receiving reinforcements, and seem determined to prevent our going through. But I guess we will not go back from here with- out a little fight, even should we not get to our destination (New- bern). The object of this expedition is to cut off the retreat of the enemy from Richmond. It is rather a dangerous undertaking, as the enemy can turn all the force against us, if they have a mind to, it being. their direct route southward by railroad. If we don't have to lay here too long waiting for our other force, I have no fear of our success. All depends upon our getting there before the rebels can reinforce sufficient to keep us back. I am fearful, how- ever, that we have been laying here too long now, but we were almost worn out on arriving here, having made a forced march of nearly a hundred and fifty miles in 8 days, and being destitute, as I before said, of every thing, it was impossible to go any further with an enemy, at the same time to drive him ahead of us, stronger than we were. I think we'll move to-night ; I dare not tell you what our force is till we get through. We are in Col. Scammon's brig- ade, and in Gen. Cox's division. I have no idea what is going on any where in the world but here. I am in hopes, however, that Richmond is in our possession by this time, and, also, the Mississippi valley, to the Gulf. If so, the rebellion is killed, and if there is any more fighting, it will be guerrilla warfare. But I must conclude this disconnected scrawl. I thought, per haps, I could write a letter when I undertook it, but I am in a wagon loaded with feed, and a little almost of every thing else, with horses hitched to it, and a lot of teamsters climbing in and out and gassing and cursing around me so, that it is impossible for me to write. I will try and do better next time, when I will try and find time to write when it ain't raining. My love to my folks at home, and everybody else. Please write soon.

BEAUREGARD, GENERAL COMMANDING, Head-quarters Western Department, Tupelo, Miss., June 13, 1862. General : \u2014 In relation to the recent military operations in this quarter, I have to submit the following for the information of the War Department : The purposes and ends for which I had held and occupied Corinth having been mainly accomplished by the last of May, and by the 25th of that month having ascertained definitely that the enemy had received large accessions to his already superior force, whilst ours had been reduced day by day by disease, resulting from bad water and inferior food, I felt it clearly my duty to evacuate that position without delay. I was further induced to this step by the fact that the enemy had declined my offer of battle, twice made him, outside of my intrenched lines, and sedulously avoided the separation of his corps, which he advanced with uncommon caution, under cover of heavy guns, strong intrenchments, constructed with unusual labor, and with singular delay, considering his strength, and our relative inferiority in numbers. The transparent object of the Federal commander had been to cut off my resources by destroying the Mobile and Ohio, and the Memphis and Charleston railroads. This was substantially foiled by the evacuation and withdrawal along the line of the former road ; and, if followed by the enemy, remote from his base, I confi dently anticipated opportunity for resumption of the offensive, with chances for signal success. Under these plain conditions, on the 26th ult., I issued verbally several orders, copies of which are herewith, marked A, B, and C, partially modified subsequently, as will be seen by the papers, etc., herewith, marked D, E, F, and G. These orders were executed, I"], [151, "437 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. am happy to say, with singular precision, as will be found full}- ad mitted in the correspondence, from the scene, of the Chicago \"Tri bune,\" herewith transmitted. At the time finally prescribed, the movement commenced, and was accomplished without the knowledge of the enemy, who only began to suspect the evacuation aster broad daylight on the morn ing of the 30th May, when, having opened on our lines from his formidable batteries of heavy and long range guns, erected the night previously, he received no answer from any direction. But as our cavalry pickets still maintained their positions of the previous day, he was not, apparently, fully satisfied of our movements, until some stores, of little value in the town, were burned, which could not be removed. It was then, to his surprise, the enemy became satisfied that a large army, approached and invested with such extraordinary pre parations, expense, labor, and timidity, had disappeared from his front, with all its munitions and heavy guns, leaving him without knowledge, as I am assured, whither it had gone ; for his scouts were scattered in all directions, as I have since ascertained, to in quire what directions our forces had taken. Even now, indeed, I have reason to believe, the Federal commander has little knowledge of the position and disposition of my main forces. But for the unfortunate and needless delay, on the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, of some five trains of box cars, (three miscel laneously freighted, and two empty,) in passing beyond the bridges over the Hatchie river and its branches, which in the plan of evacu ation had been directed to be destroyed, at a certain hour, on the morning of the 30th ultimo, not an incident would have marred, in the least, the success of the evacuation, in the face of a force so largely superior. It was, however, through a too rigid execution of orders that these bridges were burned, and we were obliged to destroy the trains, as far as practicable, and burn the stores, includ ing some valuable subsistence, to what extent will be more precisely reported as soon as practicable. The troops moved off in good spirits and order, prepared to give battle, if pursued, but no serious pursuit was attempted. Remain ing in rear of the Tuscumbia and its affluents, some six miles from Corinth, long enough to collect stragglers incident to new levies, my main forces resumed the march, and were concentrated on Bald win, with rear guards left to hold the bridges across the Tuscumbia and tributaries, which were not drawn back until the evening of the 2d instant."], [152, "438 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. Whilst at Rienzi, half way to Baldwin, I was informed that on the morning of the 30th ult., a detachment of the enemy's cavalry had penetrated to Boonville, eight miles south of Rienzi, and had captured and burned a railroad train of ammunition, baggage, and subsistence, delayed there forty-eight hours by some mismanage ment. I regret to add that the enemy also burned the railroad depot, in which were, at the moment, a number of dead bodies, and at least four sick soldiers of this army, who were consumed ; an act of barbarism scarcely credible, and without a precedent, to my knowledge, in civilized warfare. Upon the opportune appearance in a short time, however, of an inferior force of cavalry, the enemy left in great haste and confusion, after having received one volley. Only one of our men was carried away by him. Quite a considerable number of stragglers, and of our sick and convalescent, en route to southern hospitals, who for a few moments had fallen into the enemy's hands, were rescued. These are the 2,000 men untruthfully reported by Gens. Pope and Halleck to their War Department, as \" captured and parolled\" on that occasion. I desire to record that one Col. Elliott, of the Federal army, com manded in this raid, and is responsible for the cruel death of our sick. As for the 10,000 stand of small arms,\" also reported by these of ficers as destroyed, the truth is, that not to exceed 1,500, mostly in ferior muskets, were lost on that occasion. I had intimations of this expedition the day before the evacuation, and had detached immediately suitable commands of infantry and cavalry to foil its purposes, and to protect the bridges on the line of my march. Unfortunately the infantry passed through and south of Booneville, but a little while before the enemy made his descent ; the cavalry, as before said, reached there in time only to rescue our men who had been captured. Equally inaccurate, reckless, and unworthy are the statements of these Federal commanders in their several official reports by tele graph, bearing dates of the 30th and 31st of May, and of 1st, 2d and 4th of June, as published in Cincinnati and Chicago journals, touching the amount of property and stores destroyed by us at Corinth, and Gen. Pope's alleged pressing pursuit. Major-gen. Halleck's dispatch, of 4th June, may particularly be characterized as disgracefully untrue ; possibly, however, he was duped by his subordinate. Nothing, for example, can be wider from the truth than that 10,000 men and 15,000 small arms of this army"], [153, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 439 were captured or lost. In addition to those destroyed at Booneville, some 500 inferior small arms were accidentally left by convalescents in a camp, four miles south of Corinth. No artillery of any description was lost ; no clothing. No tents worth removal were left standing. In fine the letters of newspaper correspondents, inclosed, give a correct statement, both as to the conduct of the retreat, the scanty spoils of war left behind, the actual barrenness of substantial results to the enemy, and exhibit his doubt, perplexity, and ignorance, concerning the movements of this army. Baldwin was found to offer no advantages of a defensive charac ter, and being badly provided with water, I determined to fall back upon this point, some 20 miles south, 52 miles from Corinth, and here to await the developments of the enemy's plans and move ments. \u00bb Accordingly, leaving Baldwin on the 7th (see papers appended, marked H), the main body of my forces was assembled here on the 9th inst., leaving all the approaches from Corinth carefully guarded by a competent force of cavalry under an efficient officer, who occu pied a line 15 miles north of this place. Supported by my general officers, I am doing all practicable to organize for defensive operations, whensover any movement of the enemy may give the opportunity, which I anticipate as not remote. I feel authorized to say, by the evacuation, the plan of campaign of the enemy was utterly foiled, his delay of seven weeks, and vast expenditures, were of little value, and he has reached Corinth to find it a barren locality, which he must abandon as wholly worthless for his purposes.

All of these trains are to be accompanied by one pioneer company and two infantry companies, properly dis tributed per brigade. The brigade and regimental quarter-master must accompany and be responsible for their trains. 7th. The officers in charge of the baggage trains, will receive sealed orders as to their point of destination, which they will open at the first mentioned stopping place."], [156, "442 official reports of battles. 8th. As it may become necessary to take the offensive, the troops will take their position in the trenches, as soon as practicable, after disposing of their baggage in the wagon trains. One brigade per corps will be put in line of battle, in the best position for the offen sive, in front of the trenches. The reserve will remain in position as already indicated to its general commanding. These troops will all bivouac in position, and at 3 o'clock a. m., on the 29th inst., if not attacked by the enemy, will take up their line of march to Baldwin by the routes indicated in Article I, leaving properly dis tributed cavalry pickets in front of their lines, to guard and protect this retrograde movement. These pickets will remain in position until recalled by the chief of cavalry, who will remain in Corinth, for the purpose of directing the retrograde movement of cavalry, wrhen each regiment must follow the route taken by the corps to which it shall have been temporarily assigned, for the protection of its rear and flanks. 9th. Under no circumstance will these cavalry regiments abandon their position in front of the line (unless compelled by overpowering numbers), until the rear of the columns of the army of the Missis sippi shall have crossed the Tuscumbia ; when the general command ing each corps will communicate that fact to the chief of cavalry for his information and guidance. 10th. The cavalry pickets will continue the usual skirmishing with the enemy in front of the lines, and when retiring they will destroy the roads and bridges in their rear, as far as practicable ; and after having crossed the Tuscumbia, they will guard the crossings until recalled by the general commanding. 11th.

The baggage trains of his army must leave their position at daybreak on the 28th instant, by the road on the east of the Mobile and Ohio railroad, to stop temporarily at about six miles from his head-quarters, but with secret orders to the officers in charge of them to continue rapidly on the direct road to the vicinity of Bald win. The provision trains will follow the baggage trains. 2. The ammunition and ambulance trains must be parked at the most convenient point to their brigades, or near the general head quarters, where they will remain until the troops shall have been moved to the front to take up their line of battle, when these trains will be ordered to follow the provision trains. All of these trains must be accompanied by one pioneer company and two infantry companies (properly distributed) per brigade. The brigade and regimental quarter-masters must accompany and be responsible for their trains. The officers in charge of the baggage trains will receive sealed orders as to their point of destination, which they will open at the already mentioned stopping-place. 3. As it may become necessary to take the offensive, the troops will take their position in line of battle as soon as practicable after disposing of their baggage in the wagon trains. These troops will bivouac in position, and at 3 o'clock a. m. on the 29th instant, if not attacked by the enemy, will take up their line of march to Baldwin by the route indicated (Article I.), leaving pro perly distributed cavalry pickets in front of their lines to guard and protect this retrograde movement. These pickets shall remain in position until recalled by the chief of cavalry, who will remain in Corinth for the purpose of directing"], [158, "444 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. the retrograde movement of the cavalry, when each regiment will follow the route taken by the corps to which it shall have been tem porarily assigned, for the protection of its rear and flanks. 4. Under no circumstances will the cavalry regiments abandon their position in front of the lines (unless compelled by overpower ing numbers), until the rear of the column of the Army of the West shall have crossed Clear creek, when the generals commanding shall communicate the fact to the chief of cavalry for his information and guidance. 5. The cavalry pickets will continue the usual skirmishing with the enemy in front of the lines, and when retiring will destroy, as far as practicable, the roads and bridges in their rear, and after having crossed Clear creek, they will guard the crossing until recalled by the general commanding. 6. The chief of cavalry will order, if practicable, one regiment to report to Major-gen. Polk and one to Major-gen. Hardee, one to Gen. Bragg and one to Major-gen. Van Dorn, independently of the regiment now at Jacinto, already ordered to report to the latter officer. 7. After the departure of the troops from the intrenched lines, a sufficient number of drums from each brigade must be left to beat \" reveille\" at the usual hour, after which they can join their com mands. 8. The commanding officer of the Army of the West will leave, if necessary, on the south side of Clear creek, about five hundred infantry and two pieces of artillery, to defend the crossing of said stream, and to effectually destroy the bridges and obstruct the road after the passage of the cavalry. 9.

On the day the second division moved out, advances, with heavy cannonading, were made by Thomas on the right, and Pope on the left, but not a response in kind was elicited from the enemy. During the night, we could hear teams being driven off, and boxes being nailed, in the rebel camp. Deserters, however (I understand), reported that they were making \" a stand,\" and would fight the next day. 29"], [164, "450 OFFICIAL reports of battles. Considerable cannonading was done by our forces, and yet no response, and yesterday the same. Last night the same band sounded retreat, tattoo, and taps all along the rebel lines, moving from place to place, and this morning suspicion was ripened into certainty, when we saw dense columns of smoke arise in the direc tion of Corinth, and heard the report of an exploding maga zine. Corinth was evacuated ; Beauregard had achieved another \" triumph ! \" I do not know how the matter strikes abler military men, but I think we have been \" fooled.\" The works are far from being invul nerable ; and the old joke of quaker guns has been played off on us. They were real wooden guns, with stuffed \" paddies \" for gunners. I saw them. We approached clear from Shiloh, in fine of battle, and made preparations to defend ourselves, compared with which, the preparations of Beauregard sunk into insignificance. This morning we could have poured shot and shell from over three hundred guns into works that never saw the day, when Gen. McCook could not have taken his division into them. The indica tions are that the rebel force here did not exceed 60,000 men. With what light I had, I regarded the mode of our advance upon Corinth as deep wisdom ; with the light I now have, I do not. The 1st Ohio was among the first to mount the works ; but, I believe, the 24th Ohio was the very first; and their new flag,\"lately received from the 6th, was the first to wave in triumph over the now famous village of Corinth. When we got into Corinth, I sup pose the fires kindled by the rebels had destroyed all they meant to destroy, (which was every thing movable that they could not re move,) but much more damage would have been done but for our timely arrival.

HALLECK, Major-gen. commanding."], [167, "453 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. [Special Correspondence of the Chicago Tribune.] Pittsburg Landing, May 30th, 1862. Just after I had written my letter, dated this morning, a dispatch was received from Gen. Halleck's head-quarters, stating that our flag waved over the Court-House at Corinth. The news caused much surprise here, aa it was wholly unexpected, for the rebels had been disputing the ground with us, inch by inch, during the past few days, and with a stubbornness that indicated an intention to make a desperate resistance behind the main works of defence. Whether the reasons of the evacuation were merely strategical, or that the supply of provisions was running short, yet remains to be seen. I learn from a professed union man, a deserter from the reb els, that they had been for some time on short rations, the men getting only a quarter ration and the horses three ears of corn per day. Their animals are said to be in very bad condition. The water in and around Corinth is also very bad. It smells so offen sively that the men have to hold their noses while drinking it. As our men advanced, they found the water much deteriorated, and very difficult to obtain. When our forces entered the place about 7 a. m., after shelling it for some time, they found but two or three men and a few wo men and childre\u00bb in it. These were gathered around the little heaps of furniture they had snatched from the burning buildings. Whether the buildings were set on fire by our shells or the retreat ing rebels, is not known. During the night, our pickets, and indeed the entire advance of the army, heard repeated explosions, doubt less caused by the blowing up of the magazines. Nothing of any use to us, whatever, was found, not even a Quaker gun. These were of no use, however, at Corinth, as they could not have been seen by us. The retreat of the enemy was conducted in the best order. Be fore our men had entered the place, all had got off safely. Gen. Halleck has thus achieved one of the most barren triumphs of the war. In fact it is tantamount to a defeat. It gives the enemy an opportunity to select a new position as formidable as that at Corinth, and in which it will be far more difficult for us to attack him, on account of the distance our army will have to transport its supplies. Supposing the enemy take up their second position of defence at Grand Junction, about sixty miles from here, 4,000 additional wag ons will be required. At $113 each, this would involve an expense"], [168, "454 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. of nearly half a million of dollars, to say nothing of mules, pay of teamsters, forage, &c. Then there is the fatigue to our men, the attacks of guerilla parties in our rear, &c. I look upon the evacuation there as a victory to Beauregard, or, at least, as one of the most masterly pieces of strategy that has been displayed during this war. It prolongs the contest in the southwest for at least six months. It is rumored that the main body of the rebels is stationed at Kossuth, a few miles from Corinth, while some 25,000 have gone on to Grand Junction, which the enemy have been fortifying for some time past. Up to last night the enemy kept up a display of force along his whole line, thus completely deceiving our generals. I learn that the lines of fortification at Corinth are numerous and formidable, but I have no authentic statement of their real strength and condition. Gen. Halleck must feel deeply mortified at the evacuation. It clearly shows that he knew nothing of the position and strength of the enemy, and of his ulterior designs. This, in a great measure, arises from the exclusion of contrabands from camp. If this war is ever to be brought to a close, it must be by making use of the negro in every possible way. (Signed) F.

Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector-general : General : \u2014 I trust it will not be considered irrelevant in officially reporting the action of the 16th June, 1862, between our forces"], [170, "456 official reports of battles. and those of the United States, on James Island, to refer briefly to the connection which this affair had with certain alterations I had adopted in the plan of defence established prior to my assignment to the command of this department. After a thorough personal examination of Coles Island, its defences and approaches, I was con vinced that however desirable in many respects it might be to con tinue its occupation, there were disadvantages not to be overcome. With the means at my disposal, I deemed it therefore essential to the safety of Charleston, that the batteries on Coles battery island should be transferred to a more defensible position on the James Island side of the Stono river. This change would draw in our lines to the best supporting dis tance, and compel a land attack upon our intrenched position across James Island, flanked on the right by the proposed fort on the Stono, and on the left by the advanced work at Secessionville . This design was carried into execution. A strong and command ing work was erected on the Stono, completely controlling that river in the direction of the inlet of the same name, as well as the approach through North Edisto inlet, on the mouth of Wappoo cut. The intrenched lines to the east of James Island creek were also greatly strengthened by a system of interior redoubts and redans. Early in May, the guns were removed from Coles battery island. On the 13th of the same month, the abduction of the steamer Planter by her negro crew gave the enemy information of the abandonment of Coles island. The services of skilful pilots among these negroes were immediately availed of, and the enemy's gun boats entered the river about the 1 7th. Under cover of their fire, he commenced landing his troops on James Island on the 2d June. His force was gradually increased, until it was believed to have amounted to from ten to twelve thousand of all arms. Between the 2d and 15th June, several skirmishes occurred, the results of which were duly reported by the immediate commander, and the reports forwarded to the War Department. The enemy kept up at inter vals a heavy fire from his gunboats, varying from five to eight in number, against Secessionville, from positions on the Stono, and a branch of Folly river, as also from a land battery established under cover of his boats on a point distant about a mile from our own battery at Secessionville. No injury was, however, done to our works. One man was killed in his tent, and several wounded. A few shells were thrown in the direction of the new fort on the Stono at long range, but no attempt was made to engage at the fort a less distance than two and a half miles."], [171, "457 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. About 4 a. m. on the 16th, the enemy drove in or captured our pickets, some 800 yards in front of the battery at Secessionville, and advancing rapidly up\u00abn this work in line of battle, arrived within a few hundred yards of it before our guns could open upon him. To the culpable negligence of the pickets is to be attributed the near approach of the enemy before he was discovered. The men, however, were at their guns, which were at once well and rapid ly served. Lieut.-col. Gaillard's and Smith's battalions, (Charles ton and Pee Dee), were moved promptly into position under the orders of Col. J. C. Lamar, the heroic commander of the post. The enemy was driven back in confusion, and with great loss. A second attempt, after he had received reinforcements, met with a similar result, and a third was equally unsuccessful. A flank movement was then attempted against the right of the battery, but was repulsed by the Charleston battalion, aided by the Louisiana battalion, under Lieut.-col. McEnery, which had been promptly dispatched by Col. Johnson Hagood, the immediate com mander, to the support of Secessionville, on the first intimation of the enemy's advance upon that position, and which arrived in time to participate in the dangers and glory of this admirable repulse. On the evening of the 15th, I directed Brig.-gen. Evans to send suf ficient reinforcements to Secessionville to relieve the garrison of the arduous duties in which it had been engaged for a number of days previous. A detachment of four officers, (Capt. J. Jamison, com manding), and one hundred men of Col. Goodlet's 22d S. C. volun teers, came up just in time to meet the first onset of the enemy, performing most excellent service, and sustaining a loss of 1 0 killed and 7 wounded. For further details of the action immediately in front of Secessionville, I respectfully refer to the reports, (here with), of Brig.-gen. Evans, Col. J. G. Lamar, and his subordinate commanders ; and for those details resulting from the enemy's flank movement upon Secessionville, Brig.-gen. Evans' report, to that of Col. Johnson Hagood, 1st S. C. volunteers, who had been assigned to the command of an advanced corps, composed of his own regi ment ; the 24th S. C, Col. C. H. Stevens ; the Eutaw battalion, Lieut.-col. Simonton ; and the Louisiana battalion, Lieut.-col. Me Enery. The latter, as before stated, was early dispatched to the support of Secessionville ; the remaining corps greatly aiding in the final and complete defeat of the enemy. The report of each of the above named subordinate commanders is respectfully forwarded herewith. Not having been an eye-witness of this well-fought contest, it is"], [172, "458 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. impossible for me, perhaps, to commend where commendation is most due.

Green, Eutaw battalion, and 1st Sergeant James M. Baggott, who fell whilst serving his piece as No. 1, and was imme diately succeeded by his company commander, the gallant and lamented Reed. My estimation of the conduct of Col. J. G. Lamar, is fully ex pressed in my General Orders, No. \u2014 , of June 17th. His un daunted courage was an example well followed by those who sur rounded him. Lieut.-cols. P. C. Gaillard, A. D. Smith, and James McEnery. Major D. Ramsey, Captain J. Jamison, were each in command of their respective corps, during the whole, or a part of the action, and are highly commended in the report of Col. Lamar. I refer to his, and to the reports of the officers above-named, for records of further instances of individual gallantry. In like manner, I refer to the reports of Brig.-gen. Evans, to Col. C. H. Stevens, Lieut.-col. Simonton, and to Col. Hagood's, and to his subordinate commanders, and Col. Goodlet, who, all deserving high praise themselves, have doubtless bestowed it where it is best deserved. I inclose, herewith, a list of the killed, wounded, and missing \u2014 amounting in the aggregate to 204. Many of those reported as wounded, have been slightly so. I also inclose a list of those most highly commended by com manders. From the best information I have received, I estimate the loss of the enemy to have been between seven and eight hundred.

Head-quarters Second Military Division, S. C. Adams' Run, June 19, 1862 To Major J. R. Waddv, Assistant Adjutant-general, Charleston, S. C. : Major : \u2014 I have the honor to submit the following report of the action of the troops under my command on James Island on the 16th instant. On the afternoon of the 15th instant, I was informed by Col. T. G. Lamar, 1st artillery, that from his observation of the movements of the enemy, he was cor/vinced that Secessionville would, doubtless, be attacked either on that night or on the morning of the 16th. I directed him to hold his position, that he would be reinforced if necessary. At 2 o'clock on the morning of the 16th inst., I received a note from him, informing me that the enemy were advancing. I repaired to Clark's house as soon as possible, where I arrived at fifteen minutes past 4 o'clock, a. if., when I found Col. Johnson Hagood, 1st S. C. V., had, in his untiring vigilance, ordered three regiments to be in readiness for an immediate attack, and had already sent a detachment of Col. Goodlett's regiment to the sup port of Col. Lamar, watching closely the movements of the enemy in front of Secessionville. I determined to reinforce the place to two thousand strong, and immediately ordered the 4th Louisiana battalion and Col. Goodlett's regiment to repair at double-quick and report to Col. Lamar at Secessionville. Lieut.-col. McEnery, with his battalion, arrived just in time to receive the second assault of the enemy and to materially aid in repulsing him. At this time, I received a message from Col. Hagood, that the enemy were ap proaching on our right, and asking reinforcements. I directed him to attack the enemy, and immediately ordered the 51st Georgia and Col. Williams' regiment to repair to his assistance. The en gagement now became general on both wings. Col. C. H. Stevens, who was with Col. Hagood, seeing that the 24-pound battery, near Clarke's house, was not being fired, directed Lieut.-col. Capers, of his regiment, to take command of his battery and to fire on the enemy, with which, though one piece was dismounted, he did gal lant and effective service, firing constantly into the flank of the enemy. On the third assault of the enemy, Lieut.-col. Capers was very successful with his piece, piercing the columns of the enemy eleven times."], [174, "460 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. For the details of the gallant defence of the works at Secession ville, I would respectfully refer the major-general commanding to the official reports of the immediate commanders herewith submitted. Three times did that heroic band repulse (often at the point of the bayonet) a force thrice their strength, under the fire of three gun boats and four stationary or land batteries. About 10 o'clock, the enemy retreated in great confusion, leaving their dead and wounded on the field, a number lying in our trenches. The loss of the enemy I have been unable to ascertain, but, from what I saw, was at least four hundred in killed, wounded, and prisoners. The dead of the ene my immediately in front of the Secessionville works, numbered one hundred and sixty-eight, while forty-two wounded had been brought within the works. The dead I directed to be immediately buried, and the wounded to be removed to the hospital. A considerable number of arms and accoutrements were captured, a partial return of which will be found in the paper marked \" G.\" A full report of these arms I directed Capt. Reary, ordnance officer, to make to the chief of ordnance in Charleston. At 12 o'clock m., I received a note from the major-general commanding, that he was at Brig.-gen. Gist's head-quarters, asking if I wished reinforcements, that they were ready. I replied, through my aid-de-camp, that I thought the enemy was leaving his position, as he was burning the houses he had first occupied. I then joined the major-general commanding and accompanied him to Secessionville, to inspect the works as well as to ascertain our loss, and the situation and condition of our troops. After giving instructions relative to the wounded and dead, also as to the arms captured, I returned to my head-quarters, and, in ac cordance with instructions from the major-general commanding, or dered Col. P. P. Colquitt to repair with his regiment of Georgia volunteers as soon as possible, and relieve Col. Goodlett, in com mand of Secessionville. Col. Goodlett and his command were com pletely worn down and exhausted. I would here state that I had before directed Col. Lamar to send all of his exhausted men to the rear on the arrival of Col. Goodlett's command, which order left him but one hundred and fifty men for duty. The troops at Secessionville, on the morning of the 16th, were much fatigued, as they had been engaged at work in the intrench ments during the entire night, and many were entirely worn out when the action commenced in the morning. In reference to the action on our right, I would respectfully refer for particulars to the reports of Cols. Hagood and C. H. Stevens, herewith inclosed."], [175, "461 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. To my personal staff, 1st Lieut. W. H. Rodgers, special aid-de camp, Capts. R. E. Elliott and Samuel J. Come, and H. W. Carr, I am much indebted for their untiring exertions in transmitting my orders under fire. Assistant Surgeon James Evans, of my staff, rendered material aid to the wounded, who were brought to the rear. In conclusion, I would add that, at 8 o'clock a. m., Brig.-gen. W. D. Smith joined me at Clarke's house, where I directed him to take command of the right wing, and attack the enemy vigorously. I have received no report from him, but take it for granted the re ports of Cols. Hagood and Stevens cover the action of the troops on the right. To the dauntless Lamar and the troops under his command, at the commencement of the assault, the Charleston battery, Lieut.-col. Gaillard, Lieut.-col. Smith's battalion, and companies of Lamar's regiment engaged, the country, and South Carolina in particular, owe a debt of gratitude and thanks, which I know a grateful people will acknowledge. For the gallant dead, the country will ever mourn. The intrepid Reed fell whilst cheering his men to victory, just as the enemy was repulsed. The reports herewith inclosed will give casualties on our side, thirty-nine killed, ninety-three wounded and two missing. Total, one hundred and thirty-four. No report has been received from Lieut.-col. Smith's battalion. Col. T. G. Lamar's report will be forwarded as soon as received. Herewith I also inclose you a copy of a letter from Brig.-gen. Stevens, commanding the Federal forces, and also a copy of my reply. Very respectfully, Your obedient servant, N. G. EVANS, Brig.-gen. commanding. Report of Colonel Lamar. To Major-General J. C. Pemberton, Commanding Department of S. Carolina and Georgia : General : Through the interposition of Providence, it became my duty to report to you that the forces under my command gained a complete victory over the enemy on the 16th instant, at Secession ville Neck."], [176, "462 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. On the morning of the 16th of June, about four o'clock, my pickets were driven in, and reported to me that the enemy were advancing in force, and had already passed Rives' house, distant from my bat teries about three-fourths of a mile. I immediately dispatched a courier to Lieut.-cols. Gaillard and Smith, ordering them to move up their battalions at once ; and to Gen. Evans, to inform him of the advance of the foe, and I then proceeded to my batteries, where I found a detachment at each gun, having ordered such to be -the case day and night. When I arrived at the batteries, I found that the enemy were within seven hundred yards, in fine of battle, and advancing on me at the double-quick. I ordered the 8-inch columbiad to be loaded with grape, which order was promptly obeyed by Lieut. Mosely, of company I, whom I found at the battery on my arrival. I mounted the chassis, and pointed the gun myself. In the mean time, Sergeant James M. Baggott, of Capt. Reed's company B, fired upon the ad vancing line from the rifled 24-pound gun, to the left of the colum biad, and of which he was the gunner. My reason for pointing the columbiad myself, was to fire at the centre of the line, and thereby break it, in order to cause confusion and delay, so that I might get my infantry into position previous to their reaching my lines. The shot had the desired effect ; they immediately flanked to the right and left. I then ordered the columbiad to be loaded witb canister, which was promptly done, and I again pointed it. I then left the battery to get my infantry into position. On leaving the battery I met Lieut. Humbert, of company I (under whose command the colum biad was), within two or three paces of the battery, and directed him to give them canister freely, which he did. I then ordered Capt. T. Y. Simons to go to Lieut.-cols. Gaillard and Smith, and tell them to hurry up their battalions. * Lieut.-col. Smith, of the Pee Dee battalion, first attracted my attention, whereupon I ordered him to take position on the left. Although the enemy had then reached the left flank, and were pour ing in a murderous fire on my men at the guns, Lieut.-col. Smith obeyed with promptness, and soon drove them from their position. I then ordered Lieut.-col. Gaillard to take position on my right and centre, which was promptly done. It was not long after getting my infantry into position, that the enemy were driven back in con fusion. They were soon, however, reinforced, and made another desperate charge, when I again drove them back ; a third time they came, but only to meet with a most determined repulse."], [177, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 463 They then made a flank movement on my right on the west of Secessionville, and on the other side of the creek, where they were gallantly met by the Charleston battalion, which was soon reinforced by the Louisiana battalion, commanded by Lieut.-col. McEnery, who also gallantly met them with a cheer. At this time I was so much exhausted from loss of blood, from having been wounded in the head by a minie ball on the second charge, that the command was turned over to Lieut.-col. Gaillard, and afterwards to Lieut.-col. Wagner, although I never ceased to give orders to my batteries. We achieved a great victory, yet it was at a considerable loss, both in numbers and personal worth. Capt. Samuel J. Reed, of Barnwell district, and commanding company B, fell while gallantly fighting at his gun. I may safely say that his place cannot be filled. He was every thing that could be desired in an officer, and as brave, true, and gallant a man as ever sacrificed his life on a field of battle. Peace to his ashes ! Lieuts. Lancaster and Johnson, of company B, who were in com mand of the two rifled 24-pounders, did great execution, although not having grape or canister. Lieut. Bellinger, of the same com pany, who commanded the 18-pounder, poured a murderous fire into the approaching line, and, in connection with the columbiad, did more than any thing else for the fortunes of the day. These gallant officers deserve the thanks of the country, and I commend them to your notice. Capt. G. D. Keitt, and Lieuts. Humbert, Barton, Oliver, and Mosely, all acted with great bravery and deter mination. I cannot close this report without bringing to further notice, Senior First Lieut. J. B. Humbert, of company I, who acted with so much gallantry and determination in managing his gun, to which may be mainly attributed the fortunes of the day, not only on account of its calibre and weight of metal, but to its well-directed fire, and to the skill with which it was managed ; and also Second Lieuts. T. P. Oliver and J. W. Mosely, of the same company, who rendered valuable assistance to Lieut. Humbert. First Lieut. Barton, of the same company, displayed great skill and coolness in the management of the mortar, which had considerable effect upon the enemy. Too much praise cannot be given to these gallant officers, and to the detachments under their command. . Capt. F. T. Miles, of the Calhoun Guard, Charleston battalion, who was stationed at my batteries during the previous night, and whose command was the first placed in position, has my sincere thanks. He and his men fought like heroes, and did all that men could do."], [178, "464 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. Lieut.-col. P. C. Gaillard, and Major David Ramsey, conducted themselves with the utmost coolness, and were as gallant as officers could be. They both, as well as their entire command, acted with commendable courage and determination, and deserve the thanks of the country. Lieut.-col. A. D. Smith, commanding the Pee Dee battalion, and a most gallant officer, was the first that attracted my attention when the infantry were coming up to the engagement, and to him I am indebted for having relieved my left flank at a very critical time. I noticed that several of his men were shot down before he could get into position, and that, after the enemy had been driven back the first time, and while they were on their second charge, Lieut. col. Smith went out upon the field in front of the battery, gathered up as many of the small arms of the enemy as he could carry, and gave them to his own men, whose guns had refused to fire. I com mend him to your favorable notice. His command acted with great courage. My thanks are also due to Major Hudson, who acted with decided gallantry. I must also speak in high terms of the ac tions of Lieut. W. H. Etchings, of company H, who was in com mand of the Reed battery at Clark's house, which battery consisted of two smooth bore 24-pound guns, and also of my adjutant, Lieut. E. J. Frederick, who, seeing that the enemy's sharpshooters were concealed on my right flank, over the marsh, and were picking off my men, proceeded immediately to the above battery, when he and Lieut. Etchings soon dislodged them, and poured well-directed shots into them as they retreated. To Capt. McCreery, of the ordnance department, as well as to Capt. Bonneau, and Lieuts. Matthews and Hall, of our gunboat, I return my sincere thanks, for their valuable service at the columbiad battery. The casualties in the two companies of my regiment that were engaged, are as follows : Company B, Barnwell district. Killed \u2014 Capt. S. J. Reed, 2d Sergeant James M. Baggott.

BECAPITUXATION : Killed 15 Since dead 2 Wounded 37 Missing 1 Total 55 I estimate the loss of the enemy, as near as I can, at from six to eight hundred; '341 of their dead are buried in front of my bat teries; 107 were taken prisoners, many wounded, and who have since died, and I conjecture that some were drowned. Large quan tities of their wounded were carried off by their ambulances. About 400 stand of small arms fell into our hands, together with one horse wounded in the mouth, and numerous smaller articles. For the casualties in the Charleston battalion, Lieut.-col. Gaillard, and the Pee Dee battalion, Lieut.-col. Smith, together with their reports concerning the behavior of officers and men, I beg leave to refer you to the accompanying documents, marked respectively A andB. It is proper to state, that the forces under my command did not amount to more than 500 men, until the arrival of the Louisiana battalion. But this small force manfully stood their ground against an assaulting force of from one to five thousand men, among whom were the picked regiments of the enemy\u2014 the 79th New York Highlanders, and the 8th Michigan\u2014 notwithstanding that they had for fourteen days and nights been subjected to the most arduous duties. B0"], [180, "466 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. On Sunday night, the 15th inst., I received orders from Brig.-gen. Evans, to the effect, that although it might require superhuman ex ertions, he expected me to take the guns off the gunboat, and place them in battery on land. This was impossible, unless I had had a force and the means under my control that were necessary to move these guns. I therefore had to have the gunboat moved up to Se cessionville, where there was a wharf. In the mean time, I, with the two companies of my own regiment, proceeded to throw up the earthworks of the batteries, which were not completed until 3 o'clock the next morning. My men were so much fatigued, not only from the night work, but from a very spirited engagement the day previous, which lasted several hours, against the gunboats and land batteries of the enemy, that I allowed them to lay down to rest. They had hardly fallen asleep when the alarm was given, and this was the first time that any man was allowed to sleep without his arms in his hand, and at the spot that he would have to use them, during the time that I had been in command of the post. In conclusion, I would state that the great victory achieved on the 16th June, over such a superior force of the enemy, is owing entirely to the patriotism, love of freedom, and indomitable courage of the officers and men under my command.

Volunteers, Head-quarters Advanced Forces, James Island, June 18, 1862. Capt Mallort P. King, A. A. -general : Captain : I am required to report the operations of the troops under my command on the 16th inst. Some days previously, I had had the honor to be placed in com mand of a corps, composed of the 1st and 24th South Carolina volunteers, the Eutaw battalion, and McEnery's Louisiana battalion, to which were assigned the duties of the advanced guard. The force at Secessionville, however, continued to keep out in front of that position its own outposts, which were not under my command, and made no direct report to me. This has since been changed. On the night of the 15th and 16th, the troops on outpost duty, under my command, consisted of seven companies of Stevens' 24th S. C. regiment, six companies of Hagood's 1st S. C. volunteers, and one company of the 47th Georgia volunteers (Col. Williams,), all under the immediate charge of Col. Stevens. They covered the whole front of our lines, from Secessionville road to New Town cut. The pickets from Secessionville covered the space from the Seces sionville road to the marsh on the left of our lines. At 4.30 a. m. on the 16th, I received a dispatch from Col. Stevens, that the Secessionville pickets had been driven in, and that the enemy was in force upon that position. I immediately ordered under arms the portion of the 1st regiment not on picket, and Col. Simonton's Eutaw battalion, directing them to proceed down the Battery Island road, in front of our intrenchments, to the flank of the enemy's advance, and ordered Col. McEnery's Louisi ana battalion to proceed in rear by the bridge to Secessionville, de livering these orders in person. Proceeding in advance down the Battery Island road, I ordered forward one of the two 6-pounders of Boyce's battery, stationed at the crossing of the Fort Johnson road, and, arriving at the scene of action, found the enemy making their second advance upon the post at Secessionville. A thicket of felled trees ran parallel with their fine of advance, and about four hundred yards west of it, on the"], [184, "470 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. edge of which, next the enemy, Col. Stevens had deployed about one hundred men, who had been on picket duty near that point. These men were from the companies of Capts. Tompkins, Pearson, (Lieut. Hammeter, commanding,) and Gooding, (Lieut. Beckham, commanding,) of the 24th regiment S. C. volunteers. The Battery Island road, so obstructed, as to be impassable by troops or vehicles, ran between this felled thicket and a dense wood, stretching towards Grimball's, on the Stono. Simonton's battalion, coming up, was placed behind the felled thicket in line of battle, its right resting near the Battery Island road, and the detachment of the 1st regi ment S. C. volunteers was placed in reserve in the Battery Island road, throwing a strong line of skirmishers toward the Stono, which runs nearly parallel with this road, to guard against an advance from that point. Boyce's piece, under Lieut. Jeter, was placed on Simon ton's left, at the extremity of the felled thicket. The object of this disposition was chiefly defensive, as a general advance upon our lines seemed imminent. Three regiments of infantry advanced in front of us, but beyond musket range, to attack the west flank of the work at Secessionville, being supported by a battery of field artillery, near the Battery Island road, iu front, and beyond Simon ton's right. Lieut. Jeter was directed to open upon these regi ments, which he did with effect. I immediately sent to the general commanding, asking to be supported in making an attack upon the rear and flank of these regiments. When the permission to attack, and the assurance of support arrived, the enemy had retreated. In the mean while, the fire of Jeter's piece drew upon us a heavy fire from the enemy's field battery, which, from the sheltered position of our troops, did but little damage, and four companies of the 3d Rhode Island regiment were sent as skirmishers to seize the felled woods, and capture the piece. Stevens' skirmishers gallantly re pelled them. A portion of the enemy, however, penetrated to Simonton's line of battle, and one of his companies, and a platoon of another, were for a few minutes engaged in driving them back. A few casualties in other portions of his line occurred from the random fire of the enemy engaged with our skirmishers, and one man in the detachment from the 1st regiment was wounded in the same way. The enemy, in retiring, were seen carrying off their wounded. Six men were left dead in front of our skirmishers, twelve were left dead further on toward Secessionville, where the three regiments spoken of were fired upon by Lieut. Jeter, making their loss in this part of the field eighteen killed. Eleven prisoners were captured, of whom eight were wounded.

Seven companies of the 24th regiment S. C. volunteers, with six companies of the 1st regiment S. C. volunteers, and one from the 47th Georgia regiment, constituted the picket force placed under my command, and with which I went on duty on Sunday, 15th instant. This force covered our whole picket line, except that in front of Secessionville, which was guarded by pickets from the force stationed at that post. All remained quiet along the line during the day and night, and at day-light I rode to New Town cut, with a view to visit and inspect the pickets. On reaching that point, I distinctly heard the guns of the enemy in front of Secessionville, and started on my return to that point. On my way, I encountered a courier with the intelligence that the enemy had advanced in large force to storm our works at Secessionville. This information I immediately forwarded to yourself and to the head-quarters of the brigadier general commanding, proceeding myself to the front to verify the statement. In passing I took portions of four companies of my regiment, which happened to be on duty in that vicinity, and moved them in the direction of the abatis of felled timber, extending on the left of the Battery Island road. I ordered Capt. Weaver, company I, to occupy this abatis, to"], [186, "472 official reports of battles. prevent the enemy from penetrating it with his skirmishers. The detachments of my other three companies, viz. : company D, Capt. Gooding ; company G, Lieut. Hammeter, and company K, Capt. Tompkins, numbering less than one hundred men, were posted in a heavy thicket, extending from the abatis to the marsh on the left. On taking this position, I found the enemy drawn up in line of battle at Hill's house, to my right and front. With my weak force this position could only be defensive, and I rode back to ask for artillery and support, which were brought up by you. As all of the subsequent events passed under your own observation, it is unneces sary to report them, except that I would especially mention Capt. Tompkins, company K, and Lieut. Beckham, of company G, and the detachments from these two companies, who held their position gallantly in the front and did excellent service, until ordered to withdraw. Lieut.-col. Capers, my second in command, having been sent by you to order fire to be opened from the new twenty-four pounder battery, in advance of our lines, was retained by Gen. Evans at that post, and directed the fire of the battery with his usual gal lantry and efficiency. Major Hammond remained at his post in charge of the pickets on the hill road and New Town cut.

A.-general: Captain : \u2014 I have the honor to make the following report of the results of the engagement of yesterday to my regiment. Having been ordered to move at reveille, I formed and marched my regiment to the field in rear of Hill's house, and having there reported to Col. Hagood, was placed by him in position behind a hedge. Upon being placed in position, I was informed that CoL Stevens had a portion of his regiment deployed as skirmishers in our front, and was ordered to take all precautions to prevent our men firing into them. Shortly after we took position, we were put under a heavy fire of small arms, directed principally against my left wing. In obedience to orders, I kept my men under restraint, and prevented any firing, until feeling satisfied that the enemy were actually in my front. I then gave orders to fire. After a brisk fire of about a half hour, they were driven off. During their retreat, we were exposed to an enfilading fire from a field battery on our flank. Below, I append a list of casualties. The behavior of my regi ment was such as I could have wished. Lieut. Blum, of the Washingtonton Light Infantry, company B, whose company was chiefly under fire, distinguished himself by his extreme coolness, encouraging his men. He rendered most efficient aid in restraining their natural desire to return the fire of the enemy. The conduct of his men could not be surpassed. They were under my eye all the time.

Ha good, commanding 1st regiment, S. C. V., came in person to my quarters, about two miles and a half distant from this place, and ordered me to have my battalion under arms and march immediately to the Secessionville battery, at which place an engagement with the enemy was being had. With promptness the battalion was formed, and the march, at double-quick, was begun in the direction of Secessionville. When arrived at the first cross roads, some little delay ensued, arising from my ignorance of the road leading to Secessionville. After the lapse of a few moments I was assured'as to the right road, and instantly the battalion was moved off at double-quick for the scene of action. Arriving at Secessionville, I was informed that the enemy in force were advancing on the right of the battery on the opposite side of the marsh, directly up the marsh to the bridge. I hastened my command, at a run, through an open ground to the woods on the marsh. In crossing this open marsh, and while placing the battalion in position in the outer edge of the woods, it was exposed to a terrific fire from the enemy's gun boats, siege battery, field batteries, and small arms. I then ordered the men to advance in the skirt of woods, the better to view the enemy, and afford it protection from the incessant fire of the enemy. At this point, for half an hour, the fire on both sides was indeed terrific. Finally, the enemy waned, fell back, and there begun his precipitate retreat on the right in front. The gallant Lamar being struck down, and being the senior officer present, I caused an inces sant volley of grape and canister to be poured into the broken and retreating columns of the enemy, until they passed beyond view. Col. Goodlett, my senior officer, arriving about 12 m., assumed com mand. I cannot speak in terms of too high praise of the coolness, bravery, and gallantry of the officers and men of my little command. I went into the action with two hundred and fifty men, and succeeded in putting to rout twice that force of the enemy on the right. I think that the force of the enemy would undoubtedly have completely flanked the battery but for our timely arrival. The small band of brave men in the fort, exhausted and broken down in their almost superhuman exertions in repelling the foe in front, must have been unequal to the task of successfully engaging the enemy in front and on the right. It is impossible to arrive at a correct list of the slain and wounded of the enemy, as in his retreat he bore off the field many of his dead and wounded. One hundred and sixty-eight of the enemy were"], [192, "478 OFFICIAL REPORT'S OF BATTLES. buried on the field. My battalion brought from the battle-field in front the following arms and accoutrements, which have been de- livered to the ordnance office, viz. : Enfield rifles (in good condition), 27 \" (damaged), 4 Rifled muskets (in good condition), 83 Springfield muskets (in good condition), 62 a \" ( damaged), 6 * Total, 182 Cartridge boxes, 78 Saddles, 2 These are arms and accoutrements we gathered on that part of the field in front.

C. : General: \u2014 I have the honor to make the following report of the casualties in my command, originating from the fight of the 16th instant : In obedience to an order from head-quarters, I detailed one hun dred picket men, ten from each company, to go as a fatigue party about 1 o'clock a. m., of the 16th instant, to Secessionville. I placed Capt. Joshua Jamison in command of the detail, and Lieuts. L. S. Hill, H. H. Sally, and J. B. Cobb, were detailed as Lieuts., thus completing a command as one company. This detail arrived at Secessionville in time to meet the first onset of the enemy. Capt. Jamison, and Lieuts. Hill, Sally, and Cobb, acted with great coolness, courage, and determination, and sustained and supported Capt. Reid's battery to the last. The ranks of this detail, as will be seen by the exhibit \"A,\" accompanying this, were decimated. Killed ten, wounded seven. The balance of my command were ordered to support the battery to the right of Secessionville, when a galling fire was opened upon us from the enemy's artillery, without damage. We were then ordered to the support of Secessionville, and ar rived there at the close of the engagement. I am happy to state that my command throughout acted with coolness and determination ; and that too much praise cannot be bestowed upon Capt. Jamison and the lieutenants and detail before alluded to, for the manner in which they demeaned themselves in the fight. I would state one fact, before bringing this report to a close, that according to the number actively engaged, that the detail of one hundred men made from my command, under Capt. Jamison, suf fered more in proportion than any of the forces on our side. I have the honor to be, sir, Your obedient servant, S. D. GOODLETT, Col. commanding 22d regiment S. C.

BRIGADIER-GENERAL MORGAN COMMANDING. Head-quarters Morgan's Command, Knoxville, Tenn., July 30, 1862. To R. A. Allston, Assistant Adjutant-general : General : I have the honor to report, that upon the day of the engagement at Tomkinsville, a full report of which I have already sent you, I moved my command, consisting of my own regiment, the Georgia regiment of Partizan Rangers, commanded by Col. A. A. Hunt, and Major Gano's Texas squadron, to which was attached two companies of Tennessee cavalry, in the direction of Glasgow, which place I reached at 12 o'clock that night. There were but few troops in the town, who fled at our approach. The commissary stores, clothing, tfcc, together with a large supply of medical stores, found in Glasgow, were burned, and the guns were distributed among my command, about two hundred of which were unarmed when I left Knoxville. From Glasgow, I proceeded along the main Lexington road to Barren river, halting for a short time at a point near Cave city, my object being to induce the belief that I intended destroying the railroad bridge between Bowling Green and Woodsonville. I caused wires connecting with the port able battery that I carried with me to be attached to the telegraph line near Horse cave, and intercepted a number of dispatches. At Barren river, I detached three companies under Capt. Jack Allen, to move forward rapidly and destroy the Salt river bridge, that the"], [208, "490 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. troops along the line of railroad might be prevented from returning to Louisville. On the following morning I moved on towards Lebanon, distant thirty-five miles from Barren river. At 11 o'clock at night I reached the bridge over Rolling Fork, six miles from Lebanon. The enemy had received information of my approach from their spies, and my advance guard was fired upon at the bridge. After a short fight the force at the bridge was dispersed, and the planks which had been torn up having been replaced, the command moved forward to Lebanon. About two miles from the town, a skirmish commenced between two companies I caused to dismount and deploy, and a force of the enemy posted upon the road, which was soon ended by its disper sion and capture. Lieut.-col. A. Y. Johnson, commanding the troops in the town, surrendered, and I entered the place. The prisoners taken, in number about sixty-five, were parolled. I took immediate possession of the telegraph, and intercepted a dispatch to Col. John son, informing him that Col. Owens, with the 60th Indiana regiment, had been ordered to his assistance. So I at once- dispatched a com pany of Texas rangers, under Major Gano, to destroy the railroad bridge on the Lebanon branch, which he successfully accomplished in time to prevent the arrival of the troops. I burned two long buildings full of commissary stores, consisting of upwards of five hundred sacks of coffee and a large amount of all other supplies in bulk, marked for the army at Cumberland Gap. I also destroyed a very large amount of clothing, boots, &o. I burned the hospital buildings, which appeared to have been recently erected and fitted up, together with about thirty-five wagons and fifty-three new ambulances. I found in the place a large store of medicines, five thousand stand of arms, with accoutrements, about two thousand sabres, and an immense quantity of ammunition, shells, &c. I dis tributed the best arms among my command, and loaded one wagon with them, to be given to recruits that I expected to join me. I also loaded a wagon with ammunition. The remainder of the arms, ammunition, and the hospital and medical stores, I destroyed. While in Lebanon, I ascertained from telegraphic dispatches that I intercepted, that the force which had been started from Lebanon junction to reinforce Lieut.-col. Jonnson, had met and driven back the force under Capt. Jack Allen, killing one of the men, and pre venting him from accomplishing the purpose for which he had been detached. I proceeded from Lebanon on the following day, through Springfield to Macksville, at which point I was attacked by home guards. Two of my men were taken prisoners, and one severely"], [209, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 491 wounded. I remained at Macksville that night to recover the prisoners, which I did the next morning. I then left for Harrods burg, capturing a Federal captain and lieutenant on the road. Reached Harrodsburg at half-past twelve o'clock ; found that the home guard of all that portion of country had fled to Lexington. A force was also stationed on the bridge where the Lexington road crosses the Kentucky river. My reception at this place was very encouraging; the whole population appeared to turn out and vie with each other as to who should show us most attention. I left Harrodsburg at six o'clock the same evening, and moved to Law renceburg, twenty miles distant, threatening Frankfort, in order to draw off the troops from Georgetown. I remained there until the return of the courier from Frankfort, who brought the information that there was a force in Frankfort of two or three thousand men, consisting of home guards collected from the adjacent counties, and a few regular troops. From Lawrenceburg I proceeded to Shrykes' ferry, on the Kentucky river, raised the boat which had been sunken, and crossed that evening, reaching Versailles at seven o'clock. I found this place abandoned by its defenders, who had fled to Lex ington. Remained there that night, and on the next morning matched towards Georgetown. While at Varsailles, I took about three hundred Government horses and mules. I passed through Midway on the way to George town, and was informed, just before reaching the place, that a train from Frankfort was nearly due, with two regiments of Federals. I tore up the track, and posted the howitzers to command it, and formed my command along the line of the road, but the train was warned of our presence, and returned to Frankfort. Having taken possession of the telegraph office, I intercepted a dispatch, asking if the road was clear, and if it would be safe to start the train from Lexington. I replied to send the train, and made prepara tions to receive it, but it was also turned back and escaped. I reached Georgetown, 12 miles from Lexington, that evening. Just before entering the town, I was informed that a small force of home guards had mustered to oppose us. I sent them word to surrender their arms, and they should not be molested, but they fled. The people of Georgetown also welcomed us with gladness, and provided my troops with every thing they needed. I remained at Georgetown two days, during which time I sent out a company, under Capt. McMillan, to destroy the track between Midway and Lexington, and Midway and Frankfort, and to blow up the stone bridge on that road, which he successfully accomplished. Hearing"], [210, "492 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. that a company of home guard were encamped at Stamping grounds, thirteen miles distant, I dispatched a company, under Capt. Hamilton, to break up their encampment, burn the tents and stores, and destroy the guns. This was also accomplished, Capt. Hamilton taking fifteen prisoners and all their guns, and destroy ing a large amount of medical and commissary stores. I also, while at Georgetown, sent Capt. Castleman, with his company, to destroy the railroad bridges between Paris and Lexington, and report to me at Winchester. This was done. Determining to move on Paris, with a view of returning, and hearing that the place was being rapidly reinforced from Cincin nati, I deemed it of great importance to cut off the communication from that place, while I drew off the troops that were already there by a feint on Lexington. I therefore dispatched a portion of two companies towards Lexington, with instructions to drive the pickets to the very entrance of the city, while I moved the command towards Cynthiana. When I arrived within three miles of this place, I learned that it was defended by a considerable force of infantry, cavalry and artillery. I dispatched the Texas squad ron, under Major Gano, to enter the town on the right, the Georgia regiment to cross the river and get in the rear, while I moved 4my own regiment, with the artillery, under the command of Lieut. J. E. Harris, down the Georgetown pike. A severe engagement took place, which lasted about an hour and a half before the enemy were driven into the town and compelled to surrender. I took four hundred and twenty prisoners, including about seventy home guard. I regret to have to mention the loss of eight of my men in killed, and twenty-nine wounded. The enemy's loss was 194 in killed and wounded, according to their own account. Their excess in killed and wounded is remarkable, as they fought us from behind stone fences, and fired at us from buildings as we charged through the town. We captured a very fine 12-pounder brass piece of ar tillery, together with a large number of small arms, and about three hundred Government horses. I found a very large supply of commissary and medical stores, tents, guns, and ammunition at this place, which I destroyed. The parolled prisoners were sent under an escort to Falmouth, where they took the train for Cincinnati. I proceeded the next morning towards Paris, and was met on the road by the bearer of a flag of truce, offering the unconditional surrender of the place. I reached Paris at 6 o'clock, remained there that night, and started towards Winchester the next morning. As my command was filing out of Park on the Winchester pike, I"], [211, "493 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. discovered a large force of Federals coming towards the town from the direction of Lexington. They immediately counter-marched, supposing, no doubt, that my intention was to get in their rear. This enabled me to bring off my entire command without molesta tion, with the exception of two of my pickets, who were probably surprised. Reached Winchester that day at 12 o'clock, remained until 4 o'clock, when I proceeded towards Richmond. At Win chester I found a number of arms, which were destroyed. I arriv ed at Richmond at 12 o'clock that night, and remained until the next afternoon, when I proceeded to Crab Orchard. I had deter mined to make a stand at Richmond, and await reinforcements, as the whole people appeared ready to rise and join me, but I received information that large bodies of cavalry, under Gen. Clay Smith and Cols. Woolford, Metcalf, Mundy, and Wynkop, were endeavoring to surround me at this place, so I moved on to Crab Orchard. There I attached my portable battery to the telegraph leading from Stanford to Louisville, and learned the exact position of the ene my's forces, and directed my movements accordingly. Leaving Crab Orchard at 11 o'clock, I arrived at Somerset, distant 28 miles, at sun-down. I took possession of the telegraph, and counter manded all the previous orders that had been given by Gen. Boyle to pursue me, and remained here in perfect security all night. I found a very large supply of commissary stores, clothing, blankets, shoes, hats, &c, at this place, which were destroyed. I also sound the arms that had been taken from Gen. Zollicoffer, together with large quantities of shell and ammunition, all of which were destroy ed. I also burned at this place and Crab Orchard about one hundred and twenty government wagons. From Somerset, I proceeded to Monticello, and from thence to a point between Lexington and Sparta, where my command is now encamped. I left Knoxville on the 4th day of this month, with about nine hundred men, and returned to Lexington on the 28th inst., with nearly twelve hundred, having been absent just twenty four days, during which time I travelled over a thousand miles, cap tured seventeen towns, destroyed all the Government supplies and arms in them, dispersed about fisteeen hundred home guard, and parolled nearly twelve hundred regular troops. I lost in killed, wounded, and missing, of the number that I carried into Kentucky, about ninety. I take great pleasure in testifying to the gallant bravery and efficiency of my whole command. There were indi vidual instances of daring so conspicuous that I must beg the privi lege of referring to them. Private Moore, of Louisiana, a member"], [212, "494 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. of company A, of my regiment, particularly distinguished himself by leading a charge, which had an important effect in winning the battle. The report of the regimental commanders, which are in closed, are respectively referred to for further instances of individual bravery and efficiency. I feel indebted to all my aids for the prompt ness with which my orders were executed, and particularly to Col. St. Leger Grenfel,for the assistance which his experience afforded me. All of which is respectfully submitted, (Signed) JOHN H. MORGAN, Acting Brig.-gen. C. S. A. Report of Lieut -col B. W. Duke Ctnthiana, July 17th, 1862. Capt. R. A. Alston, Assistant Adjutant-general : Sir : During the engagement to-day, the regiment engaged the enemy on the Georgetown pike, and after a desperate fight of about an hour and a half, succeeded in driving them into the town, where a hot street fight occurred, lasting until near dark. We took the 12-pound brass piece that had so annoyed us during the early part of the action. Where all engaged acted so nobly, 'tis difficult to particularize ; but it is generally conceded that company A covered itself with glory, which is acknowledged by the regiment. P. H. THORP, Adjutant. Capt. R. A. Alston, Assistant Adjutant-general : In the action referred to above, my regiment was deployed upon the Georgetown pike, companies A and B upon the right, com panies E and F upon the left. After a stubborn fight, the enemy were driven from all the positions in the edge of the town. Com pany B was then sent to the extreme, to engage a force which threatened our right flank, and succeeded in dispersing it. Com panies E and F charged up to the bank of the river, under a severe fire of musketry and grape, and were prevented from entering the"], [213, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 495 town only by the depth of the water at that point. Company A crossed the river at a ford near the bridge, charged across the bridge, and, after a very severe contest, drove the enemy from the houses near the bridge. Company C, previously held in reserve, charged through the town on horseback, and forced the enemy to abandon their artillery, and cleared that street. The two last-named companies, then uniting with the Georgians, who had dashed in upon the lest, forced the enemy to abandon the depot, and subsequently the town. It is almost impossible to speak in terms too high of the different officers under my command ; good conduct and individual gallantry were so common, that it almost ceased to be a matter of remark. Capts. Hutchingson and Webber led their companies in perfect order through a fire that was unusually severe. Lieut. J. A. Smith and Bowyer, of company A, were both severely wounded in front of that company, and in the midst of the enemy. Capt. Bowles and Lieut. Myers, of company C, behaved with great gallantry ; the latter was struck from his horse, but fortun ately the wound was but slight. Lieut. White, commanding company B, performed the duty as signed him, and kept bis company in front of a superior force for nearly an hour, finally dispersing it. I have the pleasure to report the gallant and efficient conduct of Capt. Thorpe, adjutant of my regiment, and my thanks are due him for the manner in which he superintended the execution of every order. I cannot too highly compliment Col. St. Leger Grenfel, who acted with my regiment, for the execution of an order, which did, perhaps, more than any thing else to gain the battle. His example gave new courage to every one who witnessed it. I have the honor to report that every one in my regiment gave satisfaction to myself and their respective commanders. B. W. DUKE, Lieut.-col. commanding regiment."], [214, "496 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. Report of Lieut.-col. F. M. Nix. Head-quarters Camp Smith, Near Knoxville, Tenn., July 30, 1862, R. A. Alston, A. A. A.-gen. Morgan's Brigade : Sir : I have the honor to submit the following report of the action of the 1st regiment Georgia Partizan Rangers, in the battle of Cyn thiana, on Thursday, 17th inst. : On Thursday, the 17th inst., when the brigade had arrived within a few miles of Cynthiana, I was ordered by Gen. Morgan to detach my regiment, and attack the town on the west side, at the report of the cannon. Having made a circuit of five or more miles, through plantations, and over many obstructions not anticipated, with all possible dispatch, I arrived in the suburbs, and formed a line a few minutes after the sigrial of attack was heard, when I observed a body of the enemy's cavalry advancing towards my line, which were promptly repulsed by a volley from my command. Having ad vanced a short distance, I ordered Capt. Jones to deploy his com pany (A) to the right of the pike, in order to cover the whole of the rear of the town, and prevent the escape of the enemy in case of their defeat. Before the whole of company A, however, could be deployed, it encountered a body of cavalry advancing on the pike, which were repulsed, after a sharp contest. Advancing further, Capt. Jones encountered a force of artillery with one brass field piece, which he charged and repulsed, the enemy, having the piece behind them, still advancing, and completing the deployment to the right of the pike. Company A captured sixty-eight prisoners, marched them to a corner of the main street, and left them in charge of a squad under command of Lieut. R. H. Chapman. At this juncture, intelligence having reached Capt. Jones, through a pris oner, that a reinforcement of seven hundred men was coming in by railroad, he ordered Quarter-master-sergeant John C. Allen to take a file of men, and burn a long railroad bridge in his rear, which was promptly executed, the remainder of the company advancing until the firing ceased. Company B, advancing along Main street, driving before it a body of the enemy, killed some and captured many. Lieut. Mea dows and a private of said company, and private S. T. Moore, of"], [215, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 497 company A, being tho first to approach the brass field piece, which was captured. Advancing along Main street, this company was ordered to dislodge a party of the enemy from a garden, which was promptly executed. Companies B and C, and a portion of com pany A, were then ordered to charge the depot and a neighboring brick building, from which the enemy was pouring an incessant fire. After a severe conflict they drove the enemy from both these strong holds, killing and capturing several of them, and afterwards pursu ing the enemy to the corn-field, in which they made their last stand. The only casualty in company B was* one man wounded ; in com pany C, two killed and six wounded, three slightly and three se verely ; among the latter was 2d Lieut. Thomas E. Pitts. The left wing, viz. : companies D, E, and F, under command of Major Sam uel J. Winn, advanced steadily on the lest of the pike, engaging the enemy at several points, and driving them into the centre of the town, having killed and captured a number of them, and not halting until the enemy was routed. The left wing sustained no loss either in killed or wounded. I feel that many thanks and much praise are due to the officers and soldiers of my command for their highly creditable and heroic conduct on the occasion of this battle. All of which is respectfully submitted. F. M. NIX, Lieut.-col. commanding 1st regiment Georgia Partizan Rangers. Report of Major R. M. Gano, commanding battalion cavalry in Morgan's brigade. To John H. Morgan, Brig.-gen,. commanding brigade in the Kentucky expedition of July, 1862. Honored Sir :\u2014 I have the pleasure of reporting to you the action of the battalion under my command in the recent expedition to Kentucky. This report is intended to embrace only the action of the battalion while separated from the other troops under your command. The battalion was composed of four companies\u2014 two Texas companies under my command, known as the Texas squad ron ; company A, commanded by Lieut. Speen, and company B, by Capt Hauffman, and two Tennessee companies, viz. : company C, commanded by Capt. McMillan, and company D, by Capt. Hamilton, having left Knoxville on the morning of the 4th of July, 1862. We reached Walden's ridge on the evening of the 5th, where the bush- 32"], [216, "498 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. whackers fired upon our foraging party, mortally wounding Mr. J. N. O'Brien, of company A, of the Texas squadron. He lived 24 hours, suffered much, was a model soldier, a fond husband, affection ate father, and a worthy man in all the relations of life. Cut down in the prime of life, he died in a noble cause, the defence of his country from the invader. We reached Tompkinsville on the morning of the 8th, about sun rise. I was then ordered to the right of the town, on the Old Mill road, to attack from that point and cut off all retreat from that quarter. I proceeded as directed, and drove in the pickets, giving the alarm in the enemy's camp. When we came in sight of the enemy, they were forming on horseback, apparently with the inten tion of attacking us, not dreaming of the reception prepared before breakfast for them. I arranged my command to receive them, but only had the opportunity of siring a few long range guns at them, as the well-aimed shell from your howitzers drove them back from their position, and I then thought, from their movements, that they would retreat on the Burksville road, and I immediately ordered Capt. Huffman through the woods upon our right, with two com panies, to intercept them there, buj the rapid and well-aimed fire from the Georgians, under Col. Hunt, from one point, and of your regiment from another, drove the enemy into such a hasty re treat, that they passed out through a woodland trail some half mile or more, and then falling into the Burksville road, put their horses to their utmost speed. The Texans, so famous for horsemanship, started in pursuit, and a portion of the squadron, on faster horses, 60on came up with some 75 of the enemy under Major Jordan and two lieutenants, trying to cover their hasty retreat. They did not surrender to our demand, but fired back at us, wounding Thomas Huff hines. Then commenced a running fight, 75 Yankees against about one dozen Texans, and many an invader bit the dust. Among the number one lieutenant, one sergeant, and two corporals. We captured Major Jordan, one lieutenant, one sergeant, and four privates. Our casualties were, in this running fight, two wounded, viz. : J. Huffman, flesh wound in the thigh, and J. Loose, a sabre cut in the head, severing the outer table of the skull \u2014 neither dangerous. The enemy lost 9 killed, 7 captured ; number of wound ed unknown. At Bear Wallow, on the 9th, Capt. Huffman's company was de tailed from my command, upon an expedition under Capt. Jack Allen. For their movements, I refer you to his report. After the bushwhacking from New Market to Lebanon on the"], [217, "499 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. night of the 10th, and after the surrender of Col. Johnson and his forces, he having stated that the home guards would fire upon us from the houses if we entered the town, you will recollect how no bly tbt three companies of my battalion at the still hour of the night marched through to receive their fire. Lieut. Spears in front, Capt. McMillan next, and Capt. Hamilton third ; but the fire came not, the women waived their handkerchiefs, and the place was ours, as witnessed by the shout that rent the air, and then, without rest, having been in saddle 24 hours, how cheerfully we posted off five miles in the country, in compliance with the order to burn the bridges, which we did, capturing the guard. Capt. Huffman and his company rejoined us at Macksville, the night of the 11th, and next morning I was ordered forward to take possession of Harrods burg. The home guards had assembled at this place to drive us back, but before we came in sight they had fled precipitately to the Kentucky cliffs to reinforce Joshua Bell, who was collecting all the home guards at the bridge on the Danville and Lexington road, and the aforesaid militia general (Bell) was exhorting his assem blage to deeds of heroism and valor, when a party of 65 home guards came from Lancester to reinforce them. They came shouting and waving their hats. Bell's pickets fled and reported Morgan com ing with his forces at full gallop. Their heroic leader then an nounced that they could not possibly make a stand there, and every man must take care of himself, and they all fled in the direction of Lexington, some on horseback, some on foot \u2014 (the author of this, Mike Chrisman, made several miles on foot and fainted by the way side). The wicked flee when no man pursueth. The excitement and dread at Harrodsburg, on the part of the Unionists, was in tense. Strange that any persons in Kentucky could be deluded by the lies of Geo. D. Prentice to believe that the Southern people, noted for their chivalry, liberality, and sympathy, could be guilty of the baseness ascribed to us by those base hirelings of the North. But now they have been shown better by actions, which speak louder than words. A few words guaranteering respect to persons and and property quieted their fears, and all united in preparing us a repast. But the ladies \u2014 God bless them !\u2014 true and loyal to their native South, are bright examples of patriotism and fidelity to our country, our instructions, and the liberties vouchsafed to us by the struggles of our forefathers. From Harrodsburg, per order, I proceeded towards Paris, intend ing to avoid the pickets at Lexington (having only 92 men with me), but accidentally coming upon them, I feigned an attack, and cross-"], [218, "500 OFFICIAL REPORT8 OF BATTLES. ing several roads, and frightening in their pickets, they reported a large rebel force coming in from different roads. The greatest ex citement prevailed, and with cannon and huge proclamation, they prepared for defence, compelling every man, of whatever sentiment, to take up arms. I did not attack the city with my small force, but leaving Lexington to my right, and passing in by Paynes' depot, on the Frankfort road, I halted my company at the residence of John Payne, near Georgetown, for dinner. Mrs. P., not knowing any better, sent word to her husband in town, that a body of Union cavalry were there. He immediately called upon the Provost Marshal to accompany him home. He could not go, but sends his deputy, Alex. Long. Soon another messenger arrived in the person of Oliver Gaines, with an order to me to take my forces over to the Frankfort road and cut off Morgan's forces-, as the rebels were cer tainly coming that way. I answered, \" all right,\" and administered the oath of secrecy and non-interference to the two messengers, with three others that had assembled there by accident. I then passed up the iron works road, followed, as I afterwards learned, at long distance, by a party of home guards, mounted upon such horses as they had been able to pick up oh the streets of Georgetown, some riding with bridles, and some with halters, but when they came in the rear of our little column, they concluded discretion the better part of valor, and turned off on another road. We passed through the farm of Victor Flournoy, stopping to refresh ourselves at the spring of the Rev. R. J. Breckinridge, where the ladies came out, and one, whose bright eyes bespoke a Southern heart, was very curious to know what party we belonged to. This accidental call was construed into an attempt to arrest the doctor, and his son, Capt. Will. Breckinridge, whom we had not seen, was accused of being accessory. It is not surprising they should judge thus, meting by their own measure. The enemy may feel the effect of Capt. William's steel upon the field of battle, but they will never find a man of his noble Southern soul trying to secure his father's arrest. Taking tea at my father's, I proceeded on to Kizers' station, on the Paris and Covington road, and fired the bridge. The burn ing bridge fired an old shed beneath, which I afterwards learned was Mr. K.'s distillery. I regretted the loss of private property, but as it did happen, better be a distillery than any thing else. I here lost seven pickets, through their mistaking the road, and we hunted them until day, and, consequently did not destroy the Town send bridge, as I had contemplated. We then proceeded towards Georgetown, and while encamped"], [219, "501 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. in a woodland near that place, R. P. Tannehill, of company A, Texas squadron, was, by the accidental discharge of a gun, launched into eternity. Robert was a tirave soldier boy, always ready, devoted to the Southern cause, and the main prop of his widowed mother ; but we laid our bold soldier boy to rest more than a 1,000 miles from his fond mother, who little dreams of the removal of her boy. On this, the evening of the 15th, we rejoined you in Georgetown, and by order, arrested Mr. Sam Thompson, the Provost Marshal of that place. On the 17th instant, near Cynthiana, in a\u0153ordance with your order, I proceeded with my command across to the Millersburg pike, arresting the guard at the bridge, driving in the pickets and commencing the fight on the side of the town. We drove the enemy back from that portion of the town. They soon returned in pretty large force, waving their hands. I ordered to cease firing, thinking they wished to surrender, but they had taken us for liome guards, and commenced cursing us for firing on our own men. I ordered them to lay down their arms, when they fired and ran. We opened a brisk fire, and they dropped their guns for two squares down the street. We killed some ten or twelve, wounding many, and capturing as many more in town, and when they retreat ed from the town, we pursued on horseback, capturing many more. The loss from my battalion was 1 killed in Capt. Hamilton's com pany, 3 badly wounded, viz. : Lieut. R. Speer, of company A, of the Texas squadron, Clarke Aldridge, of Capt. Hoffman's company. There were two others slightly wounded. Capt. H. is of a brave stock, and is an honor to the name. On all other occasions, the forces were together, and your report will embrace the whole. My command conducted themselves with the bravery that has alway characterized them, securing lasting honors to themselves, while rendering such efficient service to their country ; and to their honor be it said, they have never failed to show kindness to the captured and wounded of the enemy, and respect to the rights of others. I think the kindness of your entire command to the enemy, when in their power, will be a good example to those of our enemies who have, throughout the State of Kentucky, busied themselves with tyrannizing over and oppressing those who honest ly differ with them in political opinion. Let all those who wish to serve their country, join the army, and show to the world they are not coward's, and not employ their time in trying, in a cowardly manner, to secure the arrest of those neighbors who differ with them in political sentiment."], [220, "502 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. We are now, on the 29th instant, again at Knoxville, Tenn., having returned from one of the most and adventurous expeditions on record, with a very small loss in numbers, but having struck a blow from which the enemy will not soon recover. Yours, R. M. GANO, Major, commanding Battalion Cavalry in Morgan's Brigade. m Report of Lieut. Harris. Morgan's Brigade, Ctnthiana, Kv., July 18, 1862. Capt. Alleton, A. A.-gen., Morgan's Legion : Sir : \u2014 In obedience to special instructions, I have to report that my battery entered the engagement of the 17th instant, on the Turnpike road, leading to this place, about 300 yards, from the bridge, at \u2014 o'clock, and commenced shelling the enemy, who were occupying the latter position, which was kept up under showers of musketry, balls, and grape, from the enemy's artillery, for an hour, at which time they retired before a charge of cavalry. By order of the General, the pieces were then manned, by hand, to the front, across the bridge, again coming under galling fire of the enemy's sharpshooters, who occupied the depot and surrounding buildings, about 80 yards distant. I regret here to have to report the inefficiency of my command, for a short time, resulting mainly from a want of discipline and drill, which you know I have scarcely had time to produce. Under these difficulties, however, the firing continued slowly until the enemy evacuated his final position. The casualties in this command are as follows, viz. : Wounded \u2014 Cannonier W. B. Shelton, slightly in the head ; can nonier Thomas Shanks, flesh wound in leg. Three horses killed. In conclusion, I cannot but mention the gallant conduct of can nonier W. B. Shelton, as setting an emulous example to others, who, when having been wounded in the head, and lain senseless for ten minutes, on recovering himself, resumed his post, where he con tinued throughout the engagement. I am, captain, your obedient servant, JOS. C. HARRIS, First Lieut, commanding Artillery, Morgan's Legion. ."], [221, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 503 George Els-worth's Dispatches. Knoxville, July 30, 1862. Capt. A. R. Alston, A. A. -general : Sir: On July 10th, Gen. Morgan, with a body-guard of fifteen men and myself, arrived at a point half a mile below Horse Cave, on the Louisville and Nashville railroad, where I took down the telegraph line and connected my pocket instrument, for the purpose of taking off all dispatches as they passed through. Owing to a heavy storm prevailing south, the atmospheric electricity prevented me from communicating with Bowling Green or Nashville. The first I heard was Louisville calling Bowling Green. I immediately put on my ground wire south, and noticed particularly, at the same time, what change it would make in the circuit. It did make it stronger but owing to the storm mentioned above, affecting telegraphs more or less, Louisville did did not suspicion any thing wrong, and I answered for Bowling Green, when I received the following mes sage : Louisville, July 10, 1862. To S. D. Brown, Commanding Bowling Green You and Col. Houghton move together. I fear the force of Col. Houghton is too small to venture to Glasgow. The whole force should move together, as the enemy are mounted. We cannot venture to leave the road too far, as they may pass around and ruin it. J. T. BOYLE, Brig.-gen., commanding. I returned the usual signal, after receiving the message, of O. K. Louisville immediately called Nashville, and I answered for Nash- ville, receiving business for two hours. This business was mostly of a private nature, and I took no copies. It could be plainly seen, by the tenor of the messages, that Morgan was in the country, and all orders to send money and valuables by railroad were counter manded (as they supposed) ; but little did the operator at Louis ville think that all of his work would have to be repeated the next day. Louisville also sent the newsof the day, and thus all were fur nished with New York and Washington dates of that day. During the whole of the time it was raining heavy. My situation was any"], [222, "504 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. thing but an agreeable one \u2014 sitting in the mud, with my feet in the water up to my knees. \u2022 At 1 1 o'clock p. m., the general being satisfied that I had drained Louisville of all the news, concluded to close for the night, and he verbally gave me the following message to send, dating and signing it as below : Nashville, July 10, 1862. To Henry Dent, Provost Marshal, Louisville Gen. Forrest, commanding brigade, attacked Murfreesboro', routing our forces, and is now moving on Nashville. Morgan is reported to be between Scottsville and Gallatin, and will act in concert with Forrest, it is believed. Inform general commanding. Stanley Matthews. Provost Marshal. I am not aware that Gen. Morgan claims to be a prophet, or a son of a prophet, but Forrest did attack Murfreesboro', and rout the enemy. On arriving at Lebanon, July the 1 2th, I accompanied the ad vance guard into town, and took charge of the telegraph office im mediately. This was, as you know, at 3:30 a. m. I adjusted the instrument and examined the circuit. No other operator on the line appeared to be on hand this early. I then examined all the dispatches of the day previous. Among them I found the fol lowing : Lebanon, July 11, 1862. To General Boyle, Louisville, Ky. : I have positive information that there are 400 marauders in 20 miles of this place, on the old Lexington road, approaching Lebanon. Send reinforcements immediately. A. Y. Johnson, Lieut.-col., commanding. At 7:30 a. m. an operator, signing Z, commenced calling B, which I had ascertained, by the books in the office, was the signal for Lebanon office. I answered the call, when the following con. versation between Z and myself ensued :"], [223, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 505 To B: What news ? Any more skirmishing after your last message ? Z.

My curiosity being excited as to what station Z was; and to ascertain, without creating any suspicion, I adopted the following plan : ToZ: A gentleman here in the office bets me the cigars you cannot spell the name of your station correctly.

To B: Yes, it is. Let me know when it arrives. Z. At 8.20 Z called me up, and said : To B: The train has returned. They had a fight with the rebels at New Hope. The commanding officer awaits orders here. Z. To Z: Give us the particulars of the fight. Col. Johnson is anxious to know all about it. B. ToB: I will as soon as possible. Z. ToB: Here is Moore's message to Gen. Boyle, Z. Lebanon Junction, July 12, 1862. To General Boyle, Louisville, Ky. : At 11 o'clock last night, part of my command encountered a force of rebel cavalry posted on the county road, half a mile south of the railroad. After a brisk fire of musketry for twenty minutes, the enemy was routed, and fled. Skirmishers were sent out in different directions, but were unable to find the enemy. At three this morning, apprehending that an effort might be made to destroy the bridges in our rear, we moved down to New Haven, and re mained until after daylight, when the train went back to the scene of the skirmish. A Mr. Forman, of Owen county, was found mortally wounded. He reported the rebel force at 450, under command of Capt. Jack Allen, and that they had fallen back towards Greensburg. One horse was killed and three captured. The books of the company were found. In the field, blood was found at different places, show ing that the enemy was severely punished. No casualties on our side. Here, with train, waiting orders. O. F. Moore, Commanding."], [225, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 507 Lebanon Junction being the repeating station for Louisville busi ness, he forwarded the following telegrams, just from Louisville, 9 a. m. : Louisville, July 12, 1862. To Col. Johnson, Lebanon Leave good guard and join Col. Owen. Pursue the enemy and drive him out. Be cautious and vigorous. Make no delay. J. T. Boyle, Brig.-gen. commanding. Louisville, July 12, 1862. To Col. Owen, Lebanon You will move after the enemy and pursue him. J. T. Boyle, Brig.-gen. commanding. You will see by the above message that Col. Owen must have been en route for Lebanon. Up to the time of our leaving Lebanon, which was about noon, Col. Moore, in command of those 500 troops at Lebanon Junction, had not received his orders, or I could furnish you with them. This I greatly regretted ; but Gen. Morgan, having no fears of \" Lin coln's web-footed soldiery,\" told me I could close my office, and to allay all suspicion at not being able to communicate with Lebanon during the afternoon, I told the operator at Lebanon junction, as follows : To Z. : I have been up all night, and am very sleepy ; if you have no objection, I will take a nap until 2 or 3 oclock. B. ToB.: All right, don't oversleep yourself. Z. Wonder if I did ! Arrived at Midway, on the Lexington and Louisville railroad, about 10 a. m. At this place I surprised the operator, who was quietly sitting on the platform of the depot, enjoying himself huge ly. Little did he suspicion that Morgan was in his vicinity. I asked him to call Lexington, and to ask Lexington the time of"], [226, "508 official reports of battles. day. He did so. I demanded this for the purpose of getting his style of handling the key, which corroborated my first impression, from the fact that I noticed paper in the instrument. To use a tel egraphic phrase, he was a \" plug operator.\" I adopted his style of writing, and commenced operations. In this office I found a signal book, which, by the way, became very useful. It contained the calls for all the offices. Dispatch after dispatch was going to and fro from Lexington, Georgetown, Paris, and Frankfort. All contained something in reference to Morgan. I tested the line, and found by applying my ground wire it made no difference with the circuit, and as Lexington was head-quarters, I cut Frankfort off. I omitted to state, that on commencing operations at this place, I discovered that there were two wires on this railroad. One was what we term a through wire, running direct from Lexington to Frankfort, and not entering any of the way offices. I sound that all military business was sent over that wire, and as it did not enter Midway office, I ordered it cut, thus forcing Lexington on the wire that did run into this office. Midway was called and I answered, when I received the fol lowing : Lexington, July 15th, 1862. To J.W. Woolums, Operator, Midway: Will there be any danger in coming to Midway ? Is every thing right ? Taylor, Conductor. I inquired of my prisoner if he knew a man by the name of Tay lor. He said Taylor was conductor. I immediately gave Taylor the following reply : Midway, July 15th, 1862. To Taylor, Lexington : All right. Come on. No signs of any rebels here, Woolums. The operator in Cincinnati then called Frankfort. I answered, and received about a dozen of unimportant dispatches. He had no sooner finished, when Lexington called Frankfort, and again I answered, receiving the following message :"], [227, "official reports of battles. 509 Lexington, July 15th, 1862. To Gen. Finnell, Frankfort I wish you to move the forces at*Frankfort, on the line of the Lexington railroad, immediately, and have the cars follow, and take them up as soon as possible. Further orders will await them at Midway. I will, in three or four hours, move forward on the Georgetown road. Will have most of my men mounted. Morgan left Versailles this morning at 8, with 800 men, on the Midway road, moving in the direction of Georgetown. Brig.-gen. Ward. This being our position and intention exactly, it was thought pro per to throw Gen. Ward on some other track, so in the course of half an hour, I manufactured the following dispatch, which was approved by Gen. Morgan, and I sent it: Midway, July 15, 1862. To Brig.-gen. Ward, Lexington : Morgan, with upwards of one thousand men, came within a mile of here, and took the old Frankfort road, bound, as we suppose, for Frankfort. This is reliable Woolums, Operator. In about 10 minutes, Lexington again called Frankfort, and as I was doing the work of two or three offices, I answered the call, and received the following : Lexington, July 15, 1862. To Gen. Finnell, Frankfort Morgan, with more than one thousand men, came within a mile of here, and took the old Frankfort road. This dispatch received from Midway, and is reliable. The regiment from Frankfort had better be recalled. Gen- Ward. I receipted for 1,his message, and again manufactured a message to confirm the information Gen. Ward had received from Midway, and not knowing the tariff from Frankfort to Lexington, I could not send a formal message. I waited until the circuit was occupied,"], [228, "510 official reports of battles. and then broke in, appearing greatly excited, and told those using the wire I must have the circuit, and commenced calling Lexington. He answered with as much gusto as I called. I telegraphed as fol lows : . To Lexington: Tell Gen. Ward our pickets have just been driven in. Great ex citement. Pickets say the force of the enemy must be 2,000. Frankfort. It was now 2 p. m., and Gen. Morgan wished to be off for George town. I run a secret ground connection, and opened the circuit on the Lexington end. This was done to leave the impression that the Frankfort Operator was \" skedaddling,\" or that Morgan's men had destroyed the telegraph. We arrived at Georgetown at sundown. I went to the telegraph office ; found it locked ; inquired for the operator ; he was pointed out to me. I hailed him and demanded admission into his office. He very courteously showed me into his office. I discovered the instruments had been removed. I asked where they were ; he re plied, that he had sent them to Lexington. I asked him what time he had Lexington last. He said 9 o'clock, since that time the line had been down. I remarked that it must be an extraordinary line to be in working condition when it was down, as I heard him send ing messages to Lexington when I was at Midway at 1 o'clock. This was a stunner, he had nothing to say. I -immediately tested the line by applying the ends of the wire to my tongue, and found the line O. K. I said nothing to him, but called for a guard of two men to take care of Wm. Smith until I got ready to leave town. I did not interrupt the line until after tea, when I put in my own instruments, and after listening for an hour or two at the Yankees talking, I opened the conversation as follows : signing myself Federal Operator, as I had done before successfully at other places. To Lexington : Keep mum. I am in the office, reading by the sound of my magnet in the dark. I crawled in when no one seen me. Morgan's men are here, camped on Dr. Ganos' place. Georgetown. To Georgetown: Keep cool. Don't be discouraged. About how many rebels are there ? Lexington."], [229, "511 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. To Lexington: I don't know. I did not notice, as Morgan's operator was ask ing me about my instruments. I told him I sent them to Lexing ton. He said \" damn the luck,\" and went out. Georgetown. To Georgetown: Be on hand and keep us posted. Lexington To Lexington I will do so. Tell Gen. Ward I'll stay up all night if he wishes. Georgetown. To Georgetown : Mr. Fulton wishes to know if the rebels are there. Cincinnati. To Cincinnati : Yes. Morgan's men are here. Georgetown. To Georgetown: How can you be in the office and not be arrested ? Cincinnati. To Cincinnati: Oh ! I am in the dark, and reading by sound of the magnet. Georgetown. This settled Cincinnati. Question after question was asked me about the rebels, and I an swered to suit myself. Things had been going on this way about two hours, when Lexington asked me where my assistant was ? I replied, \" Don't know.\" He then asked me, have you seen him to day ? I replied, \" No.\" Well, from this time out, no telegraphing could I do in the beautiful city of Georgetown. Wishing to keep myself busy, and make myself useful, I concluded to call on Mr. Smith, the operator, who was under guard in my room. I did so. I informed Mr. Smith that I would furnish him with a mule in the morning, and I should be pleased to have him ac company me to Dixie, as I understood he was in the employ of the United States Government. This was any thing but agreeable to the said Smith."], [230, "512 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. It seemed to me I had hit the young man in the right place, and I remarked that if he had not sent his instruments to Lexington, I would have taken them in preference to his person. His face brightened, and an idea struck him very forcibly that he would make a proposition. He did so, and it was to furnish me the instru ments, if I would release him. This I agreed to, as telegraph in struments are of much more value to the Southern Confederacy than Yankee telegraphers. I accompanied Mr. Smith to the servant's room, and there, under the bed, in a chest, were the instruments. After Mr. Smith giving me his word of honor not to leave town for twenty-four hours, he was at liberty to visit his wife and young Smiths. On arriving at Cynthiana, I found that the operator had \" ske daddled.\" I tested the wires, and found no fluid from either Cincin nati or Lexington, nor were the wires in working condition when I left the next day. At Paris the operator had made a clean sweep. He left the night before, taking all his instruments. At Crab Orchard there was no office, and I put in my pocket magnet. This was at 11 a. m., and the first message I heard was the following: Louisville, July 21. To Col. Woolford, Danville : Pursue Morgan. He is at Crab Orchard, going to Somerset. Boyle. No sooner had the Danville operator receipted for this, than the operator at Lebanon suggested the following : To Lebanon Junction : Would it not be well for Danville and offices below here to put on their ground wires, when they send or receive important mes sages, as George Elsworth, the rebel operator, may be on the line between here and Cumberland Gap. Lebanon. The operator at the Junction agreed with him, and said it would be a good idea, but it was not carried into effect. Arrived at Somerset that morning, I took charge of the office. I ascertained from citizens that the office had been closed for three weeks up to the very hour our advance guard arrived in town, and"], [231, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 513 then it was opened by the operator from London, who came to work the instrument, for the purpose of catching Morgan, but, unfortun ately for Uncle Sam, the operator had no time to either send or re ceive a message. But I am glad to say he had it in fine working condition for me. I had been in the office some time, when Stan ford called Somerset, and said, \" I have just returned from Crab Orchard, where I have been to fix the line. The rebels tore it down. I left there at -8 o'clock. The 9th Pennsylvania cavalry had not then arrived. What time did you get in from London ?\" Stanford. To Stanford \" Just arrived, and got my office working finely.\" Somerset. To Somerset : \" Any signs of Morgan yet? He left Crab Orchard at 11.30 a. m. to-day. Stanford. To Stanford: \" No. No signs of him as yet.\" Somerset. To Somerset \" For fear they may take you by surprise, I would suggest we have a private signal. What say you ?\" \u2022 Stanford. To Stanford: \" Good. Before signing, we will make the figure 7.\" Somerset. This was mutually agreed upon, I asked when would Woolford be at Somerset, and he said Wool ford had telegraphed Boyle that his force was green and insufficient to attack Morgan. Seeing there was no use of my losing a night's rest, I told Sandford I would retire, and that I had made arrange ments with the pickets to wake me up in case Morgan came in. The operator at Lebanon Junction urged me to sit up, but I de clined on the ground of being unwell. This did not satisfy him, but after arguing with him for some time I retired. . 33"], [232, "514 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. July 22. Opened office at 7 o'clock. Informed Stanford operator that Morgan had not yet arrived. Made inquiries about different things, and after every thing in town belonging to the United States gov ernment was destroyed, the general gave me the following messages to send : Somerset, July 22. To George D. Prentice, Louisville : Good morning, George D. I am quietly watching the complete destruction of all of Uncle Sam's property in this little burg. I re gret exceedingly that this is the last that comes under my supervis ion on this route. I expect in a short time to pay you a visit, and wish to know if you will be at home. All well in Dixie. John H. Morgan, Commanding brigade. Somerset, July 22. Gen. J. T. Boyle, Louisville : Good morning, Jerry. This telegraph is a great institution. You should destroy it, as it keeps me too well posted. My friend Elsworth has all of your dispatches since the 10th of July on file. Do you wish copies ? Joan H. Morgan, Commanding brigade. Hon. George Dunlop, Washington, D. C, Just completed my tour through Kentucky; captured 16 cities; destroyed millions of dollars worth of United States property ; passed through your country, but regret not seeing you. We parolled 1,500 Federal prisoners. Your old friend, John H. Morgan, Commanding brigade. The following is an order I issued to all operators while at George town:"], [233, "515 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. Head-quarters Telegraph Department of Kentucky, Confederate States of America, Georgetown July 16, 1862. General Order, No. 1. When an operator is positively informed that the enemy is marching on his station, he will immediately proceed to destroy the telegraph instruments and all materials in his charge. Such instan ces of carelessness as exhibited on the part of the operators at Leba non, Midway, and Georgetown, will be severely dealt with. By order of G. A.

Those of the greatest interest and importance are respectfully sub mitted. I remain, your obedient servant, George A. Elsworth, Morgan's telegrapher. REPORT OF OPERATIONS ON THE PENINSULA MAJOR-GEN. J. B. MAGRUDER, COMMANDING. Head-quarters Department Peninsula, Lee's Farm, May 3, 1862. Gen. S. Cooper, A. and I. G., C. S. A.: General : Deeming it of vital importance to hold Yorktown, on York liver, and Mulberry Island, on James river, and to keep the enemy in check by an intervening line, until the authorities might take such steps as should be deemed necessary to meet a serious advance of the enemy in the Peninsula, I felt compelled to dispose my forces in such a manner as to accomplish these objects with the least risk possible, under the circumstances of great hazard which surrounded the little army I commanded. I had prepared, as my real line of defence, positions in advance"], [234, "516 official reports of battles. at Harwood's and Young's Mills. Both flanks of this line were de fended by boggy and difficult streams and swamps. In addition, the left flank was defended by elaborate fortification at Ship Point, connected by a broken line of redoubts crossing the heads of the various ravines emptying into York river and Worm ley's creek and terminating at Fort Grafton, nearly in front of York town. The right flank was defended by the fortifications at the mouth of Warwick river, and at Mulberry Island Point, and the redoubts extending from the Warwick to the James river. Intervening between the two lines was a wooded country, about two miles in extent. This wooded line, forming the centre, needed the defence of infantry in a sufficient force to prevent any attempt on the part of the enemy to break through it. In my opinion, this advanced line, with its flank defences, might have been held by twenty thousand troops. With twenty-five thou sand, I do not believe it could have been broken by any force the enemy could have brought against it. Its two flanks were protect ed by the \" Virginia \" and the works on one side, and the fortifica tions at Yorktown and Gloucester Point on the other. Finding my forces too weak to attempt the defence of this line, I was compelled to prepare to receive the enemy, on a second line, on Warwick river. This line was incomplete in its preparations, owing to the fact that a thousand negro laborers, whom I had engaged in fortifying, were taken from me and discharged, by superior orders, in December last ; and a delay of nine weeks con sequently occurred, before I could reorganize the laborers for the engineers. Keeping, then, only small bodies of troops at Harwood's and Young's Mills, and at Ship Point, I distributed my remaining forces along the Warwick line, embracing a front from Yorktown to Minor's farm, of twelve miles, and from the latter place to Mul berry Island Point, one and a half miles. I was compelled to place in Gloucester Point, Yorktown, and Mulberry Island, fixed gar risons, amounting to six thousand men, my whole force being eleven thousand. So that it will be seen that the balance of the line, embracing a length of thirteen miles, was defended by about five thousand men. After the reconnoissances in great force from Fortress Monroe and Newport News, the enemy on the 3d April, advanced and took possession of Harwood's Mill. He advanced in two heavy columns, one along the Old York road, and the other along the Warwick road, and on the 5th of April, appeared simultaneously along the"], [235, "official reports of battles. 517 whole front of our line from Minor's farm to Yorktown. I have no accurate data, upon which to base an exact statement of his force, but from various sources of information, I was satisfied that I had before me the enemy's army of the Potomac, under the command of Gen. McClellan, with the exception of the two corps d'armce of Banks and McDowell, respectively. Forming an aggregate number of certainly not less than one hundred thousand, since ascertained to have been one hundred and twenty thousand men. On every portion of my lines, he attacked us with a furious can nonading and musketry, which was responded to with effect, by our batteries and troops of the line. His skirmishers were also well thrown forward on this and the succeeding day, and energetically felt our whole line, but were everywhere repulsed by the steadiness of our troops. Thus, with five thousand men, exclusive of the gar risons, we stopped and held in check over one hundred thousand of the enemy. Every preparation was made in anticipation of another attack by the enemy. The men slept in the trenches and under arms, but to my utter surprise, he permitted day after day to elapse without an assault. In a few days, the object of his delay was apparent. In every direction, in front of our lines, through the intervening woods, and along the open fields, earthworks began to appear. Through .the energetic action of the government, reinforcements began to pour in, and, each hour, the army of the Peninsula grew stronger and stronger, until anxiety passed from my mind as to the result of an attack upon us. The enemy's skirmishers pressing us closely in front of Yorktown, Brig.-gen. Early ordered a sortie to be made from the redoubts for the purpose of dislodging him from Palmentary's peach orchard. This was effected in the most gallant manner by the 2d Florida, Col. Ward, and 2d Mississippi battalion, Lieut.-col. Taylor, all under the command of Col. Ward. The quick and reckless charge of our men, by throwing the enemy into a hasty flight, enabled us to effect, with little loss, an enterprise of great hazard against a superior force, supported by artillery, when the least wavering or hesitation, on our part, would have been attended with great loss. The Warwick line, upon which we rested, may be briefly described as follows : Warwick river rises very near York river, and about a mile and a half to the right of Yorktown. Yorktown and redoubts Nos. 4 and 5, united by long curtains, and flanked by rifle-pits from the"], [236, "518 official reports of battles. left of the line, until at the commencement of the military road it reaches Warwick river \u2014 here a sluggish and boggy stream, twenty or thirty yards wide, and running through a dense wood fringed by swamps. Along this river are five dams, one at Wynne's mill, and one at Lee's mill, and three constructed by myself. The effect of these dams is to back up the water along the course of the river, so that nearly three-fourths of its distance its passage is impracticable for either artillery or infantry. Each of these dams is protected by artillery and extensive earthworks for infantry. Aster eleven days of examination, the enemy seems very properly to have arrived at the conclusion that Dam No. 1, the centre of our line, was the weakest point in it, and hence on the 16th April he made what seems to have been a serious effort to break through at that point. Early on that morning he opened, at that dam, a most furious at tack of artillery, filling the woods with shells, while his sharpshooters pressed forward close to our lines. From 9 a. m. to 1 2 m., six pieces were kept in constant fire against us, and by 3 p. m. nearly three batteries were directing a perfect storm of shot and shell on our exposed position. We had only three pieces in position at that point, but two of them could not be used with effect, and were rarely fired, so that we were constrained to reply with only one 6-pounder, of the Troupe Artillery, Cobb's Georgia legion, Capt. Stanley, under the particular charge of Lieut. Pope. This piece was served with the greatest accuracy and effect, and by the coolness and skill with which it was handled, the great odds against us were almost counterbalanced. By 3.30 p. m., the intensity of the cannonading increasing, heavy masses of infantry commenced to deploy in our front, and a heavy musketry fire was opened upon us. Under the cover of this con tinuous stream of fire, an effort was made by the enemy to throw forces over the stream and storm our 6-pounder battery, which was inflicting such damage upon them. This charge was very rapid and vigorous, and before our men were prepared to receive it, several companies of a Vermont regi ment succeeded in getting across and occupying the rifle-pits of the 15th N. C. volunteers, who were some hundred yards to the rear, throwing up a work for the protection of their camp. This regiment immediately sprang to arms, and engaged the enemy with spirit, under the lead of their brave but unfortunate"], [237, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 519 commander, McKinney, and, aided by the 16th Georgia regiment, repulsed the enemy ; but when the gallant McKinney fell, a tempo rary confusion ensued, which was increased by an unauthorized order to fall back. The enemy renewed the attack with great force. At this moment, the 7th and 8th Georgia, under command of Cols. Wilson and Lamar, respectively, the left of the 16th Georgia, under command of Col. Goode Bryan, and the two companies of Capts. Martin and Burke, of the 2d Louisiana, under Col. Norwood, accompanied by the 15th North Carolina, with fixed bayonets and the steadiness of veterans, charged the rifle-pits and drove the enemy from them with great slaughter. Col. Anderson, commanding his brigade, and the commanding officers of the troops above mentioned, deserve great praise for the promptness with which they rushed to the conflict and repelled this serious attempt of the enemy. Subsequently, the enemy massed heavier bodies of troops, and again approached the stream. It was evident that a most serious and energetic attack, in large force, was being made to break our centre, under, it is believed, the immediate eye of McClellan him self; but Brig.-gen. Howell Cobb, who was in command at that point, forming the 2d Louisiana, 7th and 8th Georgia, of Col. An derson's brigade, the 15th North Carolina, 14th Georgia, and Cobb's legion in line of battle on our front, received the attack with great firmness, and the enemy recoiled, with loss, from the steady fire of our troops, before reaching the middle ot the water. Brig.-gen. McLaws, commanding the 2d division, of which Cobb's command formed a part, hearing the serious firing, hastened to the scene of action, and exhibited great coolness and judgment in his arrangements. The 10th Louisiana, 15th Virginia, a part of the 17th Mississippi, and the 11th Alabama, were ordered np as reserves, and were placed in position, the 10th Louisiana marching to its place with* the accuracy of a parade drill. The other regiments were assigned positions out of the range of fire. In addition, Gen. McLaws placed the whole of his division under arms, ready to move as circumstances might require. Col. Anderson had led two of his regiments, the 7th and 8th Georgia, into action, and held two others in reserve, while Brig. gen. Toombs advanced with his own brigade, under the immediate command of Brif.-gen. Semmes, close to the scene of action, and by my order (having just arrived), placed two regiments of this brigade in action, retaining the rest as reserves."], [238, "520 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. These dispositions rendered our position perfectly secure, and the enemy suffering from his two repulses, darkness put an end to the contest. The dispositions of Gen. McLaws were skilfully made. His whole bearing and conduct is deserving of the highest commendation. I cannot designate all the many gallant officers and privates who dis tinguished themselves, and respectfully call the attention of the com manding general to the accompanying reports ; but I would fail to do my duty, if I did not specially mention some particular instances. Brig.-gen. Cobb, commanding at this point, exhibited throughout the day the greatest courage and skill, and when once, at a critical moment, some troops in his* line of battle wavered, he, in person, rallied the troops under a terrible fire, and by his voice and example, entirely re-established their steadiness. Brig.-gen. Toombs had in the morning, by my order, detached from this division Col. Anderson's brigade, to support Brig.-gen. Cobb, and late in the evening, when ordered forward by me, promptly and energetically led the remainder of his command under fire, arriving just before the enemy ceased the vigor of his attack, and in time to share its dangers. Brig.-gen. P. J. Semmes commanded Toombs' brigade, the latter being in command of the division, and showed his usual promptness and courage. Col. Levy, of 2d Louisiana regiment, was the colonel commanding at Dam No. 1, and evinced judgment, courage, and high soldierly qualities, in his conduct and arrangements, which I desire specially to commend. Capt. Stanley was in command of two pieces of artillery, including the 6-pounder, so effectively served. Both he and Lieut. Pope con ducted themselves with skill and courage. Capt. Jordan's piece was in a very exposed place, and was soon disabled after a few rounds, and was promptly withdrawn. Both he and his men exhibited great steadiness, under the terrible fire which swept over them. The enemy's loss, of course, cannot be accurately estimated, as the greater part of it occurred over on their side of the stream, but I think it could have scarcely been less than six hundred killed and wounded. Our loss was comparatively trivial, owing to the earthworks, which covered our men, and did not exceed seventy-five in killed and wounded. All the reinforcements which were on their way to me had not"], [239, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 521 yet joined me, so that I was unable to follow up the action of the 16th of April by any decisive step. The reinforcements were accompanied by officers who ranked me, and I ceased to command. I cannot too highly commend the conduct of the officers and men of my whole command, who cheerfully submitted to the greatest hardships and deprivations. From the 4th of April to the 3d of May, this army served almost without relief in the trenches. Many companies of artillery were never relieved during this long period. It rained almost incessantly. The trenches were silled with water ; the weather was exceedingly cold ; no fires could be al lowed ; the artillery and infantry of the enemy played upon our men almost continuously day and night ; the army had neither cof fee, sugar, nor hard bread, but subsisted on flour and salt meat, and that in reduced quantities ; and yet no murmurs were heard. Their gallant commanders of the army of the Potomac, and the Depart ment of Norfolk, though not so long a time exposed to these suffer ings, shared these hardships and dangers with equal firmness and cheerfulness. I have never seen, and I do not believe that there ever has existed, an army (the combined army of the Potomac, Peninsula, and Norfolk) which has shown itself, for so long a time, so superior to all hardships and dangers. The best drilled regulars the world has ever seen, would have mutinied under a continued service in the trenches for twenty-nine days, exposed every moment to musketry and shells, in water to their knees, without fire, sugar, or coffee, without stimulants, and with an inadequate supply of cooked flour and salt meats. I speak of this in honor of those brave men, whose patriotism made them indifferent to suffering, to disease, to danger, and death. Indeed, the conduct of the officers and men was such as to deserve through out the highest commendation. I beg leave to invite the attention of the department to the re ports which accompany this, and to commend the officers and men there named to the most favorable consideration of the Government. I cannot close this report without publicly bearing testimony to the great and devoted services of the cavalry of the Peninsula, so long under my command, always in the presence of superior forces of the enemy. I owe much of the success, which attended my ef forts to keep them within the walls of their fortresses, to the alacrity, daring, vigilance, and constancy of the 3d Virginia cavalry, and the independent companies from James City, Matthews, Gloucester, and King and Queen counties."], [240, "522 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. The services rendered by the officers of my staff have been in valuable. To these I owe my acknowledgments : Capts. Brayn and Dickinson, of the adjutant-general's department ; Majors Magruder and Brent, of the commissary and ordnance departments respec tively ; Capt. White, acting chief quarter-master ; Col. Cabell, chief of artillery ; Lieut.-col. Cary, acting inspector-general ; Lieut. Dou glas, of the engineers ; Lieuts. Eustis and Alston, aids-de-camp ; Dr. George W. Milden, acting staff officer ; Mr. J. R. Bryan, Mr. H. M. Stanard, Mr. D. T. Brashear, and Mr. Henry A. Doyce, who, as volunteer aids, have rendered most important services, and to private E. P. Turner, of the New Kent cavalry, on duty sometimes in the field, at others in the assistant adjutant-general's office. My thanks are due to Lieut.-col. Ball, of the Virginia cavalry, who for several weeks during the siege acted as a volunteer aid. His conduct on the 5th, in my immediate presence, and under a severe fire of the enemy, was very gallant, and worthy of the high reputation which he won at Manassas. I am also greatly indebted to Major George Neay, of the 115th Virginia militia, who has aided me in the administration, civil as well as military, of the affairs of the Peninsula, and to Lieuts. Jo seph Phillips and Causey, of the Confederate army. The local knowledge of these officers has been of great advantage to the ser vice, whilst their intrepidity and enterprise have been in the highest degree conspicuous on every occasion. I cannot express too strongly my estimate of the services ren dered by my chief quarter-master, Major Bloomfield. Soon after he took charge, he introduced order, promptness, and economy, in the management of his department. The scarcity of supplies and materials was so great as to make it almost impossible to procure them. The genius, energy, and extraordinary industry of Major Bloom field, however, overcame all obstacles, and enabled the army of the Peninsula to move, to march, and to fight, with the regularity of a machine. This statement is made in justice to Major Bloomfield, who is ab sent, on account of sickness, at the time that I write. I ask the attention, also, of the Government to the valuable ser vices rendered by Mr. Wm. Morris, of Baltimore, the signal officer, in charge of the signal service of the Peninsula, and to those of his efficient assistant, Lieut. Lindsay, of the 15th Virginia regiment. It is but just to Col. Charles A. Crump, that I should bear testi mony to the zeal, gallantry, and decided ability with which he per-"], [241, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 523 formed the various duties of commander of the post at Gloucester Point, during the year in which he was under my command. He was worthily supported, on all occasions, by Lieut.-col. P. R. Page, and the other officers and men constituting his force. That accomplished officer, Capt. Thomas Jefferson Page, of the navy, successfully applied the resources of his genius and ripe expe rience to the defence of Gloucester Point, whilst the important work opposite was commanded with devoted zeal and gallantry by Brig.-gen. Rains. \u2022 My thanks are due to Capt. Chatard, of the navy, for valuable services as inspector of batteries, and to Lieut.-col. Noland, late of the navy, the efficient commander of the batteries at Mulberry Island Point. That patriotic and scientific soldier, Col. B. S. Ewell, rendered important services to the country during my occupation of the Pen insula, as did Col. Hill Carter, the commander at Jamestown, and his successor, Major J. R. C. Lewis. I should fail in my duty to the country, and especially to the State of Virginia, if I neglected to record the self-sacrificing conduct of Capt. Wm. Allen, of the artillery. At the very commencement of the war, this gentleman erected, at his own expense, on Jamestown Island, extensive fortifications for the defence of the river, and from that time until he was driven from his home, he continued to apply the resources of his large es tate to the benefit of his country. And so great and disinterested were his zeal and devotion as an officer, that he lost almost the whole of his immense possessions in endeavoring to remove the public property committed to his charge, and that of the command ing officers. I cannot commend his conduct as an officer too highly to the government, nor his patriotism as a citizen too warmly to the love and respect of his countrymen. To Capt. Rives, Capt. St. John, Capt. Clark, and Capt. Dimmock of the Engineers, and their able assistants, the country is greatly indebted for the formidable works which enabled me to meet and repulse with a very small force the attack of an army of over one hundred thousand well-drilled men, commanded by the best officers in the service of the enemy. The steadiness and heroism of the officers and men of the artil lery of the Peninsula, both heavy and light, were very conspicuous during the attack on the 5th April, and throughout the siege which followed. The high state of efficiency of^his arm of the service was mainly due to Col. George W. Randolph, chief of artillery on"], [242, "524 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. my staff, who applied to its organization, discipline, and preparation for the field, the resources of his great genius and experience. To this intrepid officer and distinguished citizen, the country is indebted for the most valuable services, from the battle of Bethel, where his artillery principally contributed to the success of the day, to the period when he was removed from my command by promo tion. He was ably assisted by Lieut.-cols. Cabell and Brown, of the same corps. The medical officers deserve the highest commend ation for the skill and devotion with which they performed their duty in this sickly country. To Capt. Ben Harrison, and Lieut. Hill Carter, Jr., and their ad mirable troop, the Charles City cavalry, I am also indebted for meritorious services under my own eye on numerous occasions.

Dickinson, Assistant Adjutant-general : On the 16th inst., between 2 and 3 p. m., my attention was at tracted by an increase in the intensity of fire which had been heard during the morning from the direction of Dam No. 1. Thinking that perhaps a real attack was intended at that point, I ordered for ward the 10th Louisiana, 15th Virginia, and four companies of the 1 7th Mississippi, and rode towards the dam, ordering up on my way the 11th Alabama, also, to act as reserve to Dam No. 2, and direct ed my whole command, artillery, infantry, and dragoons, to be under arms, and ready to obey any order at once. I then joined Gen. Cobb. The firing at this time, from both cannon and small arms, was very heavy and constant, convincing me that the attack was in tended as a real one, and I became exceedingly anxious for the re serves to come forward, for Gen. Kershaw's brigade, of the 3d, 4th, 7th, and 8th S.

I heard from Gen. Cobb that Gen. G. T. Anderson's brigade had been or dered to his support by Gen. Magruder, and sent off by Lieut. Stanard, who offered his services to bring it forward, and sent others to hasten those regiments I had previously ordered up. A body of the enemy succeeded in crossing the pond below the dam, and were in our lower rifle-pits. Col. McKinney, of the loth North Carolina, was killed while gallantly leading his regiment to repuls ethem. His death, and the sudden dash of the enemy, created some confusion, which was, however, promptly corrected by Gen. Cobb, who, riding in among the men, they recognized his voice and person, and promptly retook their positions. Col. Anderson's bri gade, at this time came forward most opportunely, and the 7th Georgia, Col. Wilson, followed by the 8th, Col. L. M. Lamar, charg ing the enemy with the bayonet, and assisted by the 5th Louisiana and others, drove them back across the pond, killing a large number. A few minutes after this, one of the artillery pieces was reported as disabled, and I ordered up a section of Capt. Palmer's battery, which was in reserve on Lee's farm, and Capt. Thos. Jeff. Page, of the Magruder Light Artillery, being near me, offered his battery, aud I directed him to bring it. Soon after this, the regiments I had ordered forward came rapidly up. The 10th Louisiana, Col. Marig ny, was ordered to the main point of attack, and the others halted within a few hundred yards. Capt. Page's and Capt. Palmer's bat teries came dashing forward at full speed, and I felt my position secure. The firing ceased as night came on, and the assault was not renewed. I refer you to the reports of Gen. Cobb, and of Cols. Levy, Bryan, T. R. R. Cobb, Lamar, and Wilson, and of Capt. Stanley, of the Troupe Artillery, Cobb's legion, accompanying this, for further par ticulars, and for their notice of individual merit. In the death of Col. McKinney, the service has lost one who was pure in all his thoughts and just in all his acts.

James Bann, Assistant Adjutant-general Brigade: SIE:_On the 16th instant, at about 8 o'clock a. m., the enemy appeared in considerable force in the woods, and rear portion of Gannon's field, opposite the position occupied by the 2d Louisiana regiment. In a few minutes, two pieces of artillery were put in position, and opened a fire of shell upon us. This was briskly re plied to by the 6-pounder field-piece of the Troupe artillery, belong ing to Col. Cobb's Georgia Legion, and by a few shots from the 12 pounder howitzer (Capt. Jordan's battery). During the morn ing, and up to about 3 o'clock, sharp artillery firing was kept up on both sides, and the infantry were engaged in skirmishing at pretty long range. A little after 3 o'clock, the enemy brought up more artillery, and displayed 6 pieces (2 rifled Parrot) and opened a furious cannonade, which they kept up with scarcely the slightest intermission for three hours. While showering their shell upon us, a bold rush was made across the river, or creek, by a considerable body of the enemy's infantry, who suddenly dashed through the water, and, un der cover of the woods, reached the rifle-pits, in front of the position of the 15th North Carolina regiment. This regiment, with the exception of its picket, was at work intrenching its camp ; and while leading his men to charge the enemy, Col. McKinney fell and died instantly, gallantly pressing forward at the head of his command. The unfortunate death of Col. McKinney threw the 15th into momentary confusion, and the enemy was then at the rifle-pits, and about to cross them. At this time, companies B, (Capt. A. H. Martin), and D, (Capt. R. E. Burke), of the 2d Louisiana regiment, under the direction of Major Norwood, of that regiment, threw themselves from their position at the redoubt and curtain at the crest of the hill, and attacked the enemy along the left of the rifle-pits, while the 7th Georgia vigorously attacked them along the rest of the line, and the 8th Georgia came up on the right of the 7th Georgia. Company I, (Capt. Flournoy,) and com pany K, (Capt Kelso,) 2d Louisiana regiment, stationed at the lower redoubt (near Dam No. 1), opened fire upon the enemy from their position, at the redoubt. The rapid and vigorous attack of"], [249, "\"\"si*-*\" o2i OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. our troops at once checked the 'enemy, and in a few minutes they precipitately retreated, recrossed the creek, and sought shelter from the havoc which pursued them, under cover of their field pieces. Shortly afterwards, the movements of the enemy showed that, with a larger force, they intended to renew their effort to break our lines ; and, with a largely increased force, they again at tempted to cross, but were speedily repulsed, retreating in dis order. I have no means of ascertaining the number of killed and wounded on the part of the enemy, but from the bodies lest on this side, and the removal, from the field on the other side, of bodies, I am certain it must have amounted to at least two hundred. I cannot refrain from mentioning, that as falling under my im mediate observation, while the conduct of all our troops was most satisfactory, the 7th Georgia regiment, the section of the Troupe Artillery, (Capt. Stanley), and the companies of the 2d Louisiana regiment, which I have enumerated, manifested the most praise worthy alacrity and intrepidity. After this second repulse, the enemy retired their infantry from the field, and night coming on, the contest ceased, leaving us in full possession of our position, from which we had not moved except to drive back and pursue the enemy, and in the enjoyment of the pleasing knowledge that we had repulsed a foe largely exceeding us in numbers.

About half past three o'clock, heavy firing being heard in that direction, the 16th Georgia regi ment advanced and took position in the trenches, on the right of the battery opposite Dam No. 1, at which point a considerable force of the enemy had crossed and occupied our rifle-pits. They were soon driven back across this by the 15th North Carolina, 7th Georgia, and a portion of the 16th Georgia regiments, 'stationed near the dam. A heavy fire was kept up by the North Carolina 7th and 16th Georgia regiments until dark, at which time the enemy retired. I cannot close this report without an expression of great gratification in the coolness and gallantry displayed by both officers and men of my command during the engagement, and par ticular mention should be made of Capt. Montgomery, of company D. Being down from the rifle-pits with only three of his men (the others being deployed as skirmishers), he gave warning to the 15th North Carolina of the advance of the enemy, and joining that regi ment with the few men of his company that could be collected, charged with that command and drove the enemy from their pits.

On the morning of the 16th, cannonading along the line towards Wynn's Mill, and also some of the enemy's guns being brought to bear upon our batteries at Dam No. 1, and as the day progressed other indications of an attack by the enemy upon our line, induced Col.

About 10 o'clock a. m., calling in a working party of a hundred men, and keeping the regiment in this state of readiness for two"], [251, "OFFICIAL RKPORTS OF BATTLES. 529 hours or more, he ordered the arms stacked, and had the whole regiment detailed for work upon a heavy intrenchment, which he had been ordered to have erected in front of the encampment, and about two hundred yards in the rear of the rifle-pits skirting the water thrown back by Dam No. 1, making arrangements for carry ing on the work the whole of the ensuing night. Our pickets were in front of the rifle-pits, close along the water's edge. From the best information I have, at the point where the enemy charged, the depth of the water was about four feet, and its width from one hun dred and fifty to two hundred yards, and covered with heavy tim ber and thick undergrowth. About three o'clock p. H., the regiment being engaged upon the works alluded to, the pickets gave the alarm that the enemy were charging rapidly across the water and making to our rifle-pits. The regiment was immediately thrown in line of battle, and being ordered by Col. McKinney, advanced at a double-quick and witfh a yell upon the enemy, who had taken partial shelter behind the earth thrown from our pits before the regiment could reach them, and opened a terrible fire upon us as we advanced. Their fire was returned with promptness and with deadly effect upon the enemy. Volley aster volley in rapid succession immediately followed from both sides, amidst which Col. McKinney gallantly fell, in the early part of the engagement, shot through the forehead. \u00bbHe fell near the centre of the line, and his death was not known to either officers or men for some time after it occurred, and a deadly fire was kept up by both sides till about five o'clock p. m. Not knowing the strength of the enemy at the commencem'.nt of the engagement, Col. McKinney dispatched an orderly to Brig. gen. Cobb for reinforcements, and after having been engaged in close conflict, the enemy having given way on our right, the 7th Georgia regiment, under Col. Wilson, came to our assistance, and at this moment the enemy gave way in precipitate retreat, and did not again rally at any point on our line. The regiment had about five hundred men engaged. I have no means of definitely ascertaining the force of the enemy, but it must have been superior to ours. Prisoners report that they belonged to the 3d Vermont regiment, commanded by Col. Hyde. We cap. tured eight of them. The number of killed of the enemy, in front of where the regiment was engaged, has been ascertained to be thirty. How many fell in the water is not known.

Magruder, General : I have the honor to submit the following report of the artillery under my command, from the 5th of April, till the evacua tion of the Peninsula. Our line of defence consisted of the fortifica tions at Yorktown, the redoubts, Nos. 4 and 5, near Yorktown, and the line of the head waters of Warwick river, and the Warwick river itself. The narrow Peninsula, formed by the junction of the Warwick and the James rivers, was abandoned up to a point about five miles from the mouth of Warwick river, and at this point, called Minor's farm, a series of redoubts, extending from the right bank of this river, nearly to Mulberry Island fort, were constructed to check any assault of the enemy upon our right flank, coming up by the way of Land's End. The Warwick river had also obstruc tions placed in it to prevent the approach of the enemy's gunboats up this river, and we were further protected by our gunboat Teazer, which was placed near the mouth of the Warwick. From the to pography of the ground it was absolutely necessary to occupy the whole of this line in the then condition of our forces. Our forces were so few in number that it was essential to the safety of the command that the whole should be defended, as the breaking of our lines at any point would necessarily have been attended by the most disastrous results ; the centre broken or our flank turned, compelling a precipitate retreat to Yorktown or Mulberry Island, to stand a siege of the enemy's land force, assisted by the whole naval force, with but little prospect of relief or reinforcements, when the enemy occupied the intermediate country. The left bank of the York river was protected by the fortifications at Gloucester point. The force of infantry was very small. The cavalry consisted of one and a half regiments. The artillery force was very large. Heavy guns were mounted at Gloucester point, at Yorktown, at redoubt No. 4, and at Mulberry Island. From deserters, prisoners, and other sources, we were convinced that the enemy was advanc ing in very large force. He had been collecting his troops and munitions of war for several weeks, and it was certain that he would commence his march with a vastly superior force. Our advanced regiments retired before the enemy, according to orders, and took their positions upon and in rear of the Warwick river line, in per fect order. Reinforcements had been promised us from Richmond,"], [254, "532 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. and the determination of the commanding general to defend the position against assault met the cordial approval and co-operation of the army of the Peninsula. Three roads led up from the Penin sula and crossed the line of our defences. The first on our right was the Warwick road, that crossed at Lee's mill. The second crossed at Wynne's mill, and the third was commanded by the re doubts, Nos.. 4 and 5, near Yorktown. The crossing at Lee's mill was* naturally strong, and fortifications had been erected there and at Wynne's mill. Below Lee's mill the Warwick river, affected by the tides and assisted by swamps on each side, formed a tolerable protection, but the marshes could easily be made passable and the river bridged. Between Lee's mill and Wynne's mill, an unbroken forest extended on the right bank of the stream, a distance of about three miles. Two additional dams were constructed, the one, dam No. 1, nearest to Wynne's mill, the outer, dam No. 2. A dam, called the upper dam, was constructed in the stream above Wynne's mill. This detailed description of the line of de fence seems necessary to explain the positions of the artillery of the Peninsula. The whole force of artillery were placed in position. Capt. Young's battery and a portion of Major battery, oc cupied Minor's farm. A 12-pounder of Capt. Cosnihan's and a Par rott piece of Capt. Sands', under the command of Lieut. Ritter, were placed in the extreme right redoubt at Lee's mill, the battery under the charge of Capt. Cosnihan. Capt. Sands' three pieces, and Capt. Garrett's and Read's battery, each consisting of three pieces, occu pied the remaining positions at Lee's mill. One gun of Capt. Nel son's battery, under the command of Lieut. Nelson, was placed at dam No. 1. (The Donaldsonville battery) 6 pieces, Capt. Moran, Capt. Macon's battery (the Fayette artillery), 6 pieces, three pieces of the Howitzers, Capt. Herdnall, and a portion of Capt. Southall's battery, were stationed at Wynne's mill. A piece of Capt. Herd nail's, and a piece of Capt. Southall's artillery were placed at the upper dam. Capts. Smith's, Armistead's, Richardson's, and Page's, and the remaining pieces of Capt. Nelson's and Southall's batteries, occupied positions at redoubts Nos. 4 and 5, the curtain connecting these reboubts, Yorktown, and the intermediate positions. The enemy came up and opened fire upon the morning of the 5th of April. From that time till our. evacuation of the Peninsula, the fir ing was continued with slight intermissions. I have been thus par ticular in noticing the batteries in position on the 5th of April, be cause I think it due to all who first stare the advance of the enemy, in force at least seven times greater than ours, and confident"], [255, "533 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. in superior numbers, should have a place in this report. It is a tribute due to their courage, firmness, and patriotic purpose to de fend our position to the last, no matter in what superior numbers he should come. The defence was gallantly and most successfully made, and our pieces all along the line from Minor's farm to York town were fired at the enemy. My duties called me along the whole lines, and I can bear willing testimony to the bravery of the infantry and cavalry, all of whom were acting as skirmishers along the line. Wherever the enemy appeared, and they appeared all along the lines, our muskets and artillery opened upon them. The enemy after a few days seemed to change their purpose of breaking our lines by assault, and commenced to erect batteries in front of our lines. They seemed determined to forego the gallant charge and resort to the spade and their rifled guns, under the cover of in trenchments, to dislodge us from our position. No other course afforded a more ennobling tribute to our small force, or a more damaging slur upon the boasted arrogance of the enemy. On the 16th of April, Gen. McClellan laid aside his \"ill-timed prudence,\" and ventured an assault at dam No. 1, one of the weakest positions on our line. It was of great danger and consummate importance to us. A small clearing in the woods had been made on the one side, opening upon a large field upon the other. The cleared space did not permit us to employ but few guns at this position. The enemy had erected three batteries, and opened upon us with a converging fire of sixteen guns. A 24-pounder howitzer of Capt. Enders' battery occupied the front and most exposed position, im mediately at Dam No. 1. Two pieces of the Troupe artillery, (Capt. Stanley,) occupied positions at the left and right redoubts about two hundred yards to the rear upon rising ground. The enemy made an assault in force upon this position and attempted to cross. I refer to the reports of Capt. Stanley and Capt. Jordan for a detailed account of their conduct in the fight. The charge was signally repulsed by our infantry. Our artillery did all that could be done in sustaining our infantry force and dispersing the enemy. It gives me great pleasure to bear tribute to the alacrity with which Capt. Page and Capt. Palmer hurried up to this position when sent for by me. It was a critical point in the engagement, but by the daring assaults of our infantry, the enemy were quickly dispersed, before their guns could be brought up. After this signal repulse no further assault was made on our lines. But the fire of the enemy was incessant from artillery and musketry. During this time our artillery had to be changed frequently at Dam No. 1.,"], [256, "534 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. This position was occupied by four pieces of Capt. Rosser's battery, Capt. Richardson's battery, a section of Capt. Palmer's howitzers, and a section of Ocipt. Rogers' battery, at the redoubt to the right of Dam No. 1. The positions of the artillery had also to be shifted at other points. All these movements were made at night, neces sarily. I was much indebted to Lieut.-col. Brown for his disposition of the batteries of the left flank. His report will give a more detailed account of these batteries, as my supervision over them ceased upon the arrival of Gen. Pendleton, chief of artillery, on Gen. Johnson's staff, and was confined necessarily to the command of Major-gen. Magruder. Up to that time I witnessed the courage and skill they displayed. Capt. Stanard's battery arrived and was placed in po sition below Lee's mill on the 8th of April, Capt. Kemper's battery arrived a few days after, and was also put in position. From the 5th April to the of , many of our batteries were not once relieved. Until reserves came, relief was impossible, yet officers and men exhibited as much perseverance and ability to bear exposure and labor without murmur, as they did courage in resisting the enemy. Our defences, which were as strong as they could be made by the limited force at your command, were necessarily extremely imperfect, and much work had to be done after the enemy was upon us. But our men held their positions, while our works were being perfected, and until a sufficient force arrived to make us secure. The God of battles, that ever sides with a just cause, and a wise disposition of our forces, and courage and discipline of our army, has insured us one of the most gallant defences against apparently overwhelming numbers, that history gives any record of. The fidelity and promptness with which my orderlies, Wm. O- Duke, of the Richmond Fayette artillery, and , of the Charles City troop, conveyed my orders, deserve attention. I cannot close this report without calling attention to the bat teries of light and heavy artillery in the several garrisons of Glou cester Point, Yorktown, and Mulberry Island. The very small force constituting the army of the Peninsula, on the fifth of April, required the withdrawal of the whole infantry and cavalry force from Gloucester Point, to move the line of defence between the York and James rivers. The heavy artillery was thus left without any support for several days, and most nobly and efficiently did they maintain their position. When the line of defence was con tracted, Mulberry Island was thrown out of the lines of defence"], [257, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 535 several miles, to stand, if necessary, a siege. Capt. Garrett's and Young's batteries were withdrawn to this fort, thus isolated. The efficiency and skill of the cannoniers at Yorktown were attested during the whole defence. The firing was continued until 2 o'clock at night, the night of the evacuation, by which time many of our troops had arrived at Williamsburg. The skill and efficiency of our cannoniers was not only attested by my own observation, but by the accounts that have been published in the Northern papers. I ascribe their superior efficiency to the entire calmness and courage of our cannoniers, and their superior intelligence. They have had but little opportunity for practising, though they have been taught the principles and science of firing. Their entire self-possession, united with courage, intelligence, and patriotic zeal, enabled them to practice the best rule for firing, \" fire with deliberate promptness,\" and ensure their success. I beg leave particularly to call attention to the efficiency of Lieut. Wm. B. Jones, who acted most efficiently as my adjutant during the greater portion of the defence, and of my adjutant Richard M. Venable, who relieved him from duty to enable Lieut. Jones to re turn to his company, all the other officers having become inca pacitated from service by arduous and constant exposure at the bat series. I deeply regret to have to state that one of these officers, Lieut. Shields, a gallant and chivalrous spirit, who had distinguished himself in action, has since died. Very respectfully, H. C. CABELL, Col. 1st regiment artillery, and Chief of Artillery. Report of Capt. M. Stanley. To Col. T. R. R. Cobb, Commanding Georgia Legion : Colonel : I have the honor to report as follows, in reference to the part taken by the battery under my command (Troupe Artil lery), in the engagement of the 16th instant, at Dam No. 1. I had but two of my pieces in position at that point, and a 6-pounder army howitzer, under Lieut. Lumpkin. The former was on the right, in an earthwork of but little strength, and the latter in an earthwork, somewhat stronger, on the left. Both works are unfortunately placed, being in too low a position to command the field on the"], [258, "536 OFFICIAL reports of battles. opposite side of the dam. Beside my own piece one other was there\u2014 a 24-pounder iron howitzer, belonging to Capt. Jordan's battery\u2014 placed behind the work just at the dam, and in a position to command scarcely more than the dam itself. Our horses, in charge of their drivers, were placed in a bottom to the right and rear of our position. Our 12-pound howitzer took no part in the engagement, because the direction of the enemy was such that it could not be fired without endangering the lives of our own men in the intrenchments at the dam. In front of the dam, on the opposite side from us, is a broad field in which the ground rises gradually from the water's edge to the crest of a hill, 600 or 700 yards distant, and then slopes up gradually to the woods beyond. This conforma tion gave the enemy an admirable position in which to place his artillery, and it indicates how unfortunate for us is the position of our works, and of the dam itself. At about 9 o'clock a. m. on the 16th instant, the enemy brought up, under cover of the hill, a bat tery of six pieces, and placed them just beyond the crest, so as to fire, and yet be, to a large extent, protected. Judging from the balls thrown, of which a large number have been gathered up, the most of their guns were rifled. There were, however, some 12 pounder round shell, and 12-pounder round shot, indicating a smooth bore. Against this formidable array, the only piece which could be used with any effect, or without endangering the lives of our men near the dam, was the smooth-bore 6-pounder, under Lieut. Pope. For several hours did this piece maintain the unequal conflict. Capt- Jordan's piece fired a few rounds, but, from its disadvantageous position, could not command the enemy's position, and therefore exhibited sound judgment in not prolonging its fire. A little before noon there was a mutual cessation of the fire. Soon after dinner the conflict was renewed. An attempt was made by the enemy's infantry to carry our rifle-pits by fording the stream in the woods, some distance below the dam ; and during this assault the fire of their artillery upon our works was terrific. The whole atmosphere was filled with the exploding shell and shrapnel. As before, the piece under Lieut. Pope replied steadily and effectively, and not until the cannoniers were exhausted did the firing on our side cease. It was after night when the conflict closed. Though several of my men were struck with fragments of shell and spent minie balls, and though t>ur works were repeatedly pene trated by the enemy's shot, not one behind the works was seriously injured."], [259, "537 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATsLES. One of our drivers, W. P. Meeler, a brave and faithful young man, who was with the horses, had his right leg shot off below the knee by a cannon ball. Seven of our horses were killed in the fight ; five of them by minie balls in the engagement of the infantry. That the casualties among my men were so few, I ascribe to the merciful providence of Almighty God. The men, with hardly an exception, exhibited great coolness and courage. \u2022 Although the howitzer detachment took no active part in the conflict, their position was exposed to a very fierce fire. I mention, with special commendation, Lieut. A. F. Pope, gunner J. F. Dillard, and private J. C. Strickland. The following, also, are worthy of particular notice : \u2014 Sergeant R. K. Pridgeon and privates A. C. Sorrell and George B. A'tkinson. In conclusion, I would suggest that our position at Dam No. 1 is very inferior to that of the enemy, and that in view of his powerful and numerous artillery, special attention be given to that point.

Report of Col. W. S. Walker, Head-quarters 3 d Military District, McPhersonvtlle, Aug. 22d. To Major J. R. Waddy, A. A.-general, Department S. C. and Ga. : Major : \u2014 I have the honor to report that, from the reconnoissance of Lieut.-col. Colcoch, of the 2d battalion cavalry, and Capt. J. M. Mickler, 11th infantry, and the information obtained from three de serters, I was persuaded that a force of the enemy, stationed on the northeastern point of Pinckney Island, and believed not to exceed one hundred men, could be surprised and captured. For this pur pose, I ordered Capt. Stephen Elliott, of the Beaufort Artillery, with Capt. J. H. Mickler, 11th infantry, to organize a boat expedition. I refer you to the inclosed report of Capt. Elliott for a clear and unreserved statement of his operations. For a due understanding of the hazardous nature of the under taking, it is necessary to state, that a gunboat cruises in that im mediate neighborhood, and her masts were seen through the trees from the enemy's encampment. There was not only the danger attending an attack upon an enemy nearly equal in force, but the still greater risk of being intercepted by the powerful batteries of a war steamer. The conception of the expedition required daring and great rapidity of execution. A prolonged contest, even if successful, would have been fatal in its results. I knew that the high qualities of the leaders and their men would secure the prompt execution, and the result has amply justified my confidence. While great credit is due to every officer and man engaged, I must specially mention the conspicuous services of Capts. Elliott and Mickler. My position, in front of an enemy occupying islands, and com manding their approach witll powerful war steamers, as well as the"], [261, "OFFICIAL REPORT8 OF BATTLES. 539 character of my force, consisting mainly of cavalry, armed with shot guns, has disabled me from undertaking any large operations against the enemy. I believe, however, I have succeeded in impressing him with an exaggerated estimate of my force, by means of repeated attacks upon his pickets at various points, which would seem to indicate the confidence and audacity of a strong and threatening force. I have been indebted to Capt. Stephen Elliott, who is a sailor as well as a soldier, for the organization, and largely for the execution of these affairs. With great zeal and enterprise, he has con tributed a sagacity and prudence which have invariably secured success. His officers and men have proved worthy of their commander. They have borne exposure, fatigue, and hunger, with unshrinking courage and alacrity. Capt. Mickler has but recently been under my command, but, in that short time, his boldness as a scout and his gallantry as a leader have sustained his well-earned reputation. I would commend all the officers and men engaged in the expe dition to the most favorable notice of the general commanding. I inclose a copy of the only order of special interest among those captured. I will send the prisoners to Charleston as soon as I have examined them. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, Your obedient servant, W. S. WALKER, Colonel commanding. Report of Captain Stephen Elliott. McPhersonville, S. C, August 22, 1862. Lieut. E. H. Barnwell, A. A.-general, 3d Military District, Department S. C. : Sie : \u2014 I have the honor to submit the following report of an expedition to Pinckney Island, organized in pursuance to orders from District head-quarters : On the 1 8th, in company with Capt. Mickler, I made a careful reconnoissance of the island, and formed my plan of attack. I ex tended orders to Capt. Mickler to transport four boats from Hor ton's to Bear Island, and to join me there on the evening of the"], [262, "540 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 21st, with one hundred men. I also directed that fifty men of the Beaufort artillery, with muskets, and a four-pounder boat gun, should meet me at Boyd's Landing on the 19th, in order to take six boats to Foot Point and Bear Island, by the way of Broad river. The dispositions were successfully accomplished within the required time. On the 21st, at 3 a. m., I left Bear Island with detachments of Capts. Mickler's, Leadbetter's, and Westcoat's companies, under the commands of their captains, and of the Beaufort artillery, under Lieut. Stuart, amounting in all to one hundred and twenty men (120), thirty-six (36) of whom acted as oarsmen, and remained in the boats \u2014 nine in number. Passing down a creek two miles in length, I landed, at early dawn, on Pinckney Island, three hundred (.300) yards in rear of the dwelling-house, which is situated at the apex of an angle, whose sides include about forty (40) degrees. Deploying rapidly across the base, I moved forward toward the point, over ground on one side open and on the other covered by a dense thicket, up to the camp of company H., 3d regiment New Hampshire volunteers, sur prising them, killing, according to the most careful estimate, fifteen, and capturing thirty-six, four of whom were wounded. Six were seen to escape, and five are known to have been absent. These, with the previous numbers named, give sixty-two (62), the number on their morning report book. The Lieutenant in command, the only officer present, either escaped or was killed. There is good reason to believe the latter. To avoid delay in so exposed a position, I forbade the men to touch an article, and we returned, bringing off the company records and two fine boats, having remained on the island fifteen minutes. Eight of my men were wounded, six of them, I regret to say, by their own men. This js the more provoking, as I earnestly and re peatedly warned both officers and men against this very danger. Some palliation may exist in the fact that some of the men were en gaged for the first time, that the disaster sprung from an excess of zeal and courage, and that there was not light enough to distino-uish persons at any distance. The mixture of small detachments too, at all times an element of confusion, is especially so in surprises at night, when the necessity of silence demands the most rigid disci pline and uniformity of action. I take pleasure in saying that the whole command acted with great spirit and determination. It is a just tribute to a gallant offi-"], [263, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 541 cer to say that Capt. Mickler, by his ceaseless energy and labor for days and nights previously, as well as by his valuable suggestions, contributed in no small degree to the success of the enterprise ; while, by his impetuous courage, he rendered complete the surprise of he enemy.

Hartsville, August 22, 1862. To Adjutant-general General : \u2014 I beg to confirm my dispatch of the 20th inst., an nouncing the result of yesterday's expedition."], [266, "544 official reports of battles. My command, consisting of my own regiment, 700 strong, and a squadron of Texas rangers, numbering about 100 men, returned that day, worn out; to Gallatin. At 1 1 p. m., I received information from one of my friendly scouts that the enemy's cavalry were encamped on the roadside, between Castilian Springs and Hartsville, a distance of only 12 miles from my camp. Judging from the fact that they had halted by the roadside, I concluded that they intended to march at night, and attack early in the morning, and I made my preparations accordingly, dispatch ing scouts upon whom I could depend, to bring me positive infor mation as to the enemy's movements. At day-break my column was on the move, and as the advanced guard reached the head of the town, my pickets came galloping in, followed by my principal scout, who reported that he was closely pursued by a large body of cavalry. Not wishing, on account of the inhabitants, to make Gallatin the scene of our contest, I advanced my column, and was greeted, on reaching the Hartsville pike, by a heavy fire from that direction. I dismounted the two leading companies to fight, and threw them into the woods, on the lest of the road. The enemy increased his fire, and I gradually had my whole command engaged. The fight began at half-past 6 o'clock, and was maintained with out much advantage on either side \u2014 the enemy having, perhaps, rather the best of it at first \u2014 until about half-past 8, when they began to fall back, and my men to redouble their efforts. At half jjast 9, I had driven them four miles, and was preparing for a final charge, when a flag of truce was brought, proposing an armistice, in order to bury their dead. My reply was, that I could entertain no proposition, except un conditional surrender. I learned that the troops were commanded by Brig.-gen. Johnson. During the parley, the enemy had formed into line of battle, and were, evidently, ready to defend themselves from any fresh attack. I divided my force into three divisions, leading one myself in the direction which I thought Gen. Johnson had taken. Major Morgan had five companies under his orders, on my left. Lieut.-col. Duke, on my right, had three companies and his advance guard. Some delay was occasioned by the non-arrival of my gallant Texas rangers, who formed part of the body under my own immediate orders. They had been separated from their horses during the pre ceding sight, and had not been able to recover them in time to come"], [267, "545 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. to the front. On their arrival, we marched on in the direction of the enemy, and Col. Duke's division coming within sight, advanced at a canter, and opened fire. Gen. Johnson's forces being on a good pike, retreated for some time, faster than my men, who were on difficult ground, could fol low, but, after a pursuit of some two miles, they were overtaken, and compelled to fight. They were dismounted and formed behind their horses. The po sition they had selected was a very good one, especially as they considerably out-numbered Col. Duke's force, which was the only one opposed to them, Major Morgan and my own detachment, in the eagerness of pursuit, having taken too far to the left. Col. Duke reports that on perceiving that the enemy had halted, he formed his three companies and the advance guard into columns of squadrons, preserving the regular distances between each, so as to be able to form into line at command, and attack. This was done with admirable precision and coolness by his men, and nothing could exceed their gallantry. The enemy were formed under the brow of a hill, and my men were drawn up above them, so that their fire told with effect on my line, whilst that of the attacking party went over their heads. Aster a very sharp engagement of about fifteen minutes, they broke and ran. Gen. Johnson, his Adj.-gen. Capt. Turner, Major Winfrey, and a number of privates were captured, but the main body escaped to the hills, through the woods and high corn, making for the Cum berland river. Thus ended an action in which my command, not exceeding 700 men, (one whole company being in the rear with prisoners) succeed ed in defeating a brigade of 1,200 chosen cavalry, sent by Gen. Buell expressly to take me or drive me out of Tennessee, killing and wounding some 180, and taking 200 prisoners, including the Brig. gen. commanding, and the greater part of the regimental officers. My loss in both actions amounted to 5 killed and 18 wounded, 2 missing. Amongst the wounded was Capt. Huffman, who had his arm shattered by a ball whilst leading gallantly on his brave Texan rangers\u2014 a small body of men, commanded by Major Gano, of whom I cannot speak too highly, as they have distinguished themselves ever since they joined my command, not only by their bravery, but their good soldier-like conduct. To all my officers and men my best acknowledgments are due ; nothing but hard fighting carried them through. 35"], [268, "546 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. To my personal staff I am deeply indebted\u2014 Col. St. Leger Gren fell, Acting Adjt.-gen., ably supported me ; Capt. Lewellen, my quarter-master, and Capt.

Duke led on his regiment, if possible, with more than his usual gallantry, and contributed, by the confidence with which he has inspired his men, to insure the success of the day. Lieut.-col. Duke makes particular mention of the cool and deter mined manner in which Lieut. Rogers, commanding advanced guard, Capts. Hutchinson, Castle, and Lieut. White, respectively com manding the three companies composing his division, behaved ; in fact, the conduct of both officers and men deserves the highest praise. I received every assistance from the patriotism and zeal of the neighboring citizens, amongst whom Major Duffey, and Capt. R. A. Bennet, were pre-eminent. I have also to report that I have received a dispatch from Gen. Forrest, stating that he has encamped within eight miles of me, with a reinforcement of 800 men, but no artillery \u2014 the want of this arm cripples my movements and prevents my advance with that certainty of effect which a battery would afford. Recruits are daily and hourly arriving. The population seems at last to be thoroughly aroused, and to be determined on resistance. I hope shortly, general, to be able to report further successes, and rest assured that no exertions on my part shall be wanting \u2014 no sacrifices on that of my officers and men will prevent our giving as good an account of the enemy as our small numbers will admit of.

McKinstry, which was concealed on the bank of the river, to cross. Capt. Rice was, in the mean time, or dered to throw his cavalry well out on the Battle creek and Steven son roads. Scarcely had the 32d crossed, when the cavalry reported enemy's infantry and cavalry approaching in force, the truth of which was made apparent from the clouds of dust in the roads. I immediately ordered the 32d to be formed in line of battle, near the crest of the hill in the town. And in a few moments the enemy's cavalry (4th Ohio and one other, name not known), dashed up in full speed, and were permitted to come within less than fifty yards of the infantry before a gun was fired, when a galling fire was poured into them, and they retreated in great confusion. In a short time clouds of dust warned me of the enemy's approach on our left, and to meet it, I had the front of the left wing changed forward in time to receive another dash of cavalry, which was again thrown in con fusion by another volley more effective than the first, and he again 'retreated, but re-formed, and by the dust I soon saw he was approach-"], [271, "official reports of battles. 549 ing the centre. A company of the 32d Alabama, armed with the Enfield rifle, commanded by Lieut. Sellers, was placed in the centre in ambush, and as the enemy came up the hill, in very close range, this company rose and delivered its deadly fire simultaneously with the wings, separated for cover, and this time the enemy broke and fled in perfect confusion. Whilst this portion of the fight was going on, my batteries, con sisting of Capt. Freeman's and Capt. Dunn's artillery, and one 24 pounder rifle-gun, opened (by previous agreement) out on the enemy's works, at the mouth of Battle creek, about five miles dis tant up the river, and continued incessantly during the entire day. The heavy columns of dust bearing towards Stevenson from the enemy's camps around there, showed a general commotion. At night I ordered the battery commanders to keep the fire up, believing the enemy, if properly managed, would evacuate before day. At about two o'clock in the morning the work was abandoned in great confusion, the enemy burning most of his commissary stores, but leaving in our possession some $30,000 worth of valuable pro perty, embracing some commissary stores, ordnance stores, quarter master stores, clothing, all his tents, thirty-two horses and four mules, a few wagons and ambulances, and some few medicines, and a splendid case of surgical instruments, besides some sutler's stores, a number of officers' trunks, many of the post commander's papers, and some very valuable maps. It is proper to observe, that after the fight commenced at Bridgeport, the 3d Georgia cavalry and 25th Tennessee infantry were ordered across, but did not reach the place in time to participate. Indeed, it was only after the fight had opened that I received notice that the 3d Georgia was placed at my disposal temporarily. I was informed by the major-general commanding, several days ago, that some cavalry, under Col. Lay, would move down the Se quachie Valley, and I had hoped to have its assistance. At 10 p. m. on the 27th, I received a note from Col. Lay, dated Jasper, 5J p. m., informing me that he was there with 550 cavalry, and desired me to inform him of my movements, stating that he heard the cannonad ing, &c. This I did, with an expression of belief that the enemy would be shelled out before morning, and saying to him (in sub stance) that if he would take his position about the mouth of Swee den's cove about daylight, he would probably get them. It is unfortunate that these suggestions were not acted on, for if they had been, the enemy being panic-stricken by throwing cavalry in his front, the hills on either side, and my forces in rear, would"], [272, "550 official reports of battles. have been easy prey. I am indebted to Capt. S. M. Scott, Assistant Adjutant-gen., Capt. C. G. Schultz, Assistant Inspector-gen., Capt. M. H. Lewis, ordnance officer of my staff, and my aid, Lieut. R. C. Andrews, for valuable and efficient aid. The work between the two points kept the first three constantly busy \u2014 Capt. Scott person ally superintending the throwing forward reinforcements. My aid, Lieut. Andrews, was with me at Bridgeport, and did his duty coolly and well. The 32d Alabama did nobly, fighting like veterans, under their able colonel (McKinstry), seconded by Lieut.-col. Maney, dis tinguished for gallantry and coolness on the field. Capts. Freeman and Dure, and the officers under them, did their whole duty. Lieut. Holtzclaw, of Capt. Dure's battery, worked the siege gun most of the time and splendidly. It was handled part of the time by Capt. McCreery. Capt. Rice and his command acted in a man ner worthy of all praise. In short, I never saw troops behave bet ter than did the 32d Alabama, Rice's cavalry, Freeman's and Dure's batteries, and the detachment with siege guns. I particularly call your attention to the boldness of this regiment of infantry in wading a broad sheet of water, such as the Tennessee, up to their arm-pits, with retreat cut off, and the enemy known to be strong in front. Should I be furnished with sufficient cavalry to reap the fruits of this movement, our cause will be greatly benefited. The work out of which the enemy was shelled, is a splendidly constructed field work, admirably executed, is the key to the Sequachie Valley, and its possession completely breaks the enemy's chain up the Tennessee river. With cavalry to operate from that point toward Stevenson and Huntsville, the enemy could be kept in constant alarm. I neglected in this appropriate place, to say, which I do with gratitude, that our loss was trifling, only six wounded \u2014 one missing \u2014 thus small owing to the fact that the grounds on which the fight took place at Bridgeport were perfectly well known to me, and the men, most of the time, had the advantage of cover. The enemy's loss, for such an affair, was heavy, variously estimated from fifty to seventy-five killed and wounded in the two engagements, certainly not less than fifty, and the indications are it was greater.

Major-general E. Kirby Smith commanding. Head-quarters Army of Kentucky, Richmond, Ky., August 30th, 1862. Gen. S. Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector-general C. S.A., Richmond Va.: Sir : \u2014 It is my great pleasure to announce to you that God has thrice blessed our arms to-day. After a forced march, almost day and night, for three days, over a mountain wilderness, destitute alike of food and water, I found the enemy drawn up in force to oppose us, at a point eight miles from this place. With less than half my force, I attacked and carried a very strong position at Mount Zion Church, after a hard fight of two hours. Again, a still better position at White's farm, in half an hour ; and finally, in this town, just before sunset, our indomitable troops deliberately walked (they were too tired to run) up to a magnificent position, manned by 10,000 of the enemy, many of them perfectly fresh, and carried it in fifteen minutes. It is proper for me now to give you the exact results of these glorious battles. Our loss is comparatively small. That of the enemy, many hundred killed and wounded, and several thousand prisoners. We have captured artillery, small arms, and wagons. Indeed, every thing indicates the almost entire annihila tion of this force of the enemy. In the first two battles they were commanded by Gen. Manson, in the last by Gen. Nelson. Reinforcements must be sent up to me at once. We have large numbers of adherents here, who, if we can show an ability to main tain ourselves, will flock to our standard. I am, sir, respectfully, Your obedient servant, (Signed) E. KIRBY SMITH, Major-general commanding."], [274, "552 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. August 31st. General :\u2014 I have onfy time to add that the commander of the enemy, Gen.

KIRBY SMITH, Major-general. Report of Maj. gen. E. Kirby Smith. Head-quarters Army of Kentucky, Lexington, Ky., Sept. 16, 1862. Gen. S. Cooper, Adjutant and Ins.-gen., Richmond, Va. : General : \u2014 In my short letter of the 30th ultimo, I gave you the results of my actions of that day, of which I have the honor now to make a more detailed report. Before leaving Barboursville for this part of Kentucky, I wrote to you, fully explaining the reasons that prompted me to take that step. Until my advance descended the Big Hill, it met with no opposition from the enemy. Here, on the morning of the 29th, the enemy was discovered to be in force in our front, and a bold recon noissance of the cavalry, under Col. Scott, in the afternoon, indicated a determination to give us battle. Although Churchill's division did not get up until quite late in the afternoon, and then in an ap parently exhausted state, I determined to march to Richmond the next day, even at the cost of a battle with the whole force of the enemy. The leading division, under Gen. Cleburne, was moved early the next morning, and after marching two or three miles, they found the enemy drawn up in line of battle in a fine position near Mount Zion Church, six miles from Richmond. Without waiting for Churchill's division, Cleburne at once commenced the action, and when I arrived on the field, half-past 7 o'clock, the fire of artillery was brisk on both sides. As my force was almost too small to storm the position in front without a disastrous loss, I sent Gen. Churchill, with one of his brigades, to turn the enemy's right."], [275, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 553 While this move was being executed, a bold and well-conducted attempt on the part of the enemy to turn Cleburne's right, was admirably foiled by the firmness of Col. Preston Smith's brigade, who repulsed the enemy with great slaughter. It was about this time, and while he was riding from his right to his left, that Gen. Cleburne was badly wounded in the face, and thus, at a critical moment, I was deprived of. the services of one of the most gallant, zealous, and intelligent officers of the whole army. The command of this division then devolved upon Col. Preston Smith. In the mean time, Gen. Churchill had been completely suc cessful in his movement upon the enemy's right flank, where, by a bold charge, his men completed a victory already partially gained by the gallantry of our troops on the right. In this action our loss was quite heavy on the right, but in com parison with that of the enemy, was small. It being reported that the enemy had taken up a new position, on White's farm, two miles in front, I ordered Churchill, with one brigade, to again turn his right, intending to bring up Preston Smith on the other flank. But a desperate attempt on the part of the enemy to crush Churchill, caused the action to commence be fore the arrival of Smith's division, and so this gallant brigade (Col. McCray's), of Texans and Arkansians had to fight the battle alone. Although the odds opposed to them were fearful, yet, by reserving their own fire, under the deafening roar of the enemy's guns, and by a well-timed and dashing charge upon the advancing lines, they completely routed and put to flight the hosts of the enemy, just as the cheers of Smith's division announced their ar rival in the field. The loss of the enemy here was very great, including one piece of artillery ; ours, almost nothing. Scott's cavalry having been around to our left by another road, to get in the rear of Richmond, I felt during the whole day much in need of cavalry to follow up our different successes. It was then, that in this second repulse of the enemy, I ordered Capt. Nelson, commanding a company of Partizan Rangers, to charge the retreating masses of the enemy. This was promptly and admirably obeyed, the results being the capture of numerous prisoners. In passing a deserted camp of the enemy, I found from some of the wounded that Gen. Nelson, with reinforcements, had arrived after the second battle. A march of two miles brought us within sight of the town, in front of which, and on a commanding ridge, with both flanks resting upon woods, Nelson had determined to make a final stand. For a third time, Churchill, with a brigade (McNair's), was sent off to the left, when"], [276, "554 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. a deafening roar of musketry soon announced the raging of a furious combat. In the mean while, Preston Smith, bringing up his division at a double-quick, formed with wonderful decision and rapidity in front of the enemy's centre and left. Almost without waiting the command of the officers, this division coolly advanced under the murderous fire of a force twice their number, and drove them from the field in the greatest confusion, and with immense slaugh ter. Owing to the open character of the country, our loss in the last fight was quite heavy, including some valuable regimental officers. The exhausted condition of my men, together with the closing in of night, prevented the pursuit of the enemy more than a mile beyond Richmond. But the timely arrival of Col. Scott, with his cavalry, upon their two lines of retreat, enabled him greatly to increase the fruits of the hard labors of the day, by capturing large numbers of prisoners, including Gen. Manson and staff, as also eight pieces of artillery, and a number of wagons, and while my whole force was not more than five thousand, that of the enemy was more than ten. In this last engagement, we took prisoners from thirteen regiments. Our loss in killed and wounded is about 400; that of the enemy is about 1,000, and his prisoners 5,000. The immediate fruits of the victory were 9 pieces of artillery and 10,000 small arms, and a large quantity of supplies. These latter were greatly increased by the capture of this place and Frankfort, the whole number of cannon taken being about twenty. I regret that I am unable to forward with this the reports of all the different commands of the forces engaged. Those inclosed (Gen. Churchill's and Col. Scott's), will show you how much cause the Confederacy has to be proud of her sons. I almost fear to particularize, lest I do not full justice to all ; but I cannot close this report without expressing my admiration at the promptness and intelligence with which Gens. Churchill and Cle burne, and Col. Preston Smith, executed the orders given them. My thanks are due to the following members of my staff, who were with me on the field, for their active assistance to me during the day, viz. : Cols. Pegram and Boggs, Lieut.-col. Brent, Majors J. A. Brown, McElrath, and Thomas, Capt. Merse, Lieuts. Cunningham and Pratt, and Capts. Walworth, and Hammond, and McFrevet, volunteer aids. Too much praise cannot be given to the medical director, Surgeon S. A. Smith, and to his assistants, for their un tiring devotion to the arduous labors that devolved upon them. As regards the intrepid behavior of the true patriots, the men in the ranks, I can only say, that as long as the destinies of the South"], [277, "555 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. remain in such hands, we need never fear Northern subjugation. But even more than their noble courage before the enemy, are. we called upon to admire that higher courage, which enabled them to undergo, without murmur, the fatigues and hardships of one of the most difficult marches of this war. For several days, and parts of the nights, through a country almost entirely without water, over stony roads, with their almost bare feet, and with green corn and beef, without salt, as their only food, did these gallant men trudge along, inspired only with the desire of being led against the invad ers of their homes, and the oppressers of their liberties. I refer you to the reports of the division and brigade command ers, only a part of which I am now able to forward, for notice of special cases of good behavior. I remain, general, Very respectfully, Your obedient servant, E. KLRBY SMITH. Report of Brig.-gen. Churchill. Head-quarters 3d Division, A. K, Cynthiana, Ky., September 8th, 1862. To Major-gen. E. Kirby Smith : General :\u2014 I have the honor to report, that on the morning of the 30th* ultimo, according to instructions, I moved my division, composed of the first and second brigades, commanded by Cols. McCray and McNair respectively, up the road in the direction of Richmond. When I arrived in the neighborhood of Kingston, I heard the artillery open on our right, showing that Gen. Cleburne had met the enemy. It was now about 8 o'clock a. m. It was at this time you ar rived on the field, and ordered me to hold one of my brigades in reserve, while, with the other, I was to make a flank movement on the enemy's right. In accordance with these instructions, I left Col McNair, with his brigade, as a reserve force, and proceeded with Col. McCray's brigade, composed of Arkansas and Texan troops, to execute the movement on the enemy's flank, and by pro ceeding cautiously through a corn field and a ravine had almost perfected the move, when the enemy, pressed by our forces on our"], [278, "556 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. right, commenced to give way ; but, after falling back some dis tance, they formed in a skirt of timber, when my forces fired and charged upon them. Then, for the first time discovering my posi tion, they commenced a precipitate retreat, but not before we had killed a great many, and taken a number of prisoners. I was again ordered to move up on the left, with the same brigade, while Gen. Cleburne was to move on the right. After proceeding some two miles in the direction of Richmond, I found the entire force of the enemy, numbering eight or ten thousand, in a strong position on the left of the road, concealed by a cornfield and a skirt of timber. I then sent Gen. Cleburne word to move up, that I was ready to engage the enemy. I then placed one sec tion of Capt. Humphrey's battery, under command of Lieut. , on my right, about two hundred yards from the enemy, to more effectually rake his lines. Before Gen. Cleburne's division came up, the fight had commenced in earnest. The fire of the enemy's artillery and musketry was most terrific, while we replied only with artillery. I then ordered my command to lie down, protected by a fence and ditch, and, for full five minutes, we did not fire a gun in response to their terrible fire. The enemy were at this time advancing in heavy force, and when they had arrived within fifty yards of my line, the order was given to rise, fire, and charge, which order was promptly and gallantly obeyed. The enemy could not withstand the desperate courage of my men, but still, for a while they contested every inch of ground as they were driven from it, until finally, finding it impossible to check this gallant charge, they gave way in every direction. The victory was complete. The field was covered with the dead and wounded of the enemy, and some (though comparatively few) of the gallant sons of Arkansas and Texas fell martyrs to the cause of liberty. Here we captured a large number of prisoners, guns and equipments of all kinds. In this charge one splendid rifle can non was taken. This was, perhaps, the most severely contested fight of the day. Finding this brigade worn down by incessant fighting I ordered up Col. McNair to follow in pursuit of the now flyinw enemy. After pursuing them some two miles, we found them again drawn up in line, near the outskirts of Richmond, having collected their whole force for a last and final struggle. Here I took position on the right of the enemy's line. Soon my skirmishers engaged those of the enemy, which was soon followed by a general engagement of my forces. I was driving back the enemy's right wing, when I heard* firing on my right, showing that"], [279, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 557 Gen. Cleburne had engaged the enemy on their left. The engage ment then became general throughout the entire line. For a time the contest wras sharp, and the rattle of the musketry almost deafening, but again, for the third and last time, the enemy fled in great confusion through the streets of Richmond, as night closed upon our victorious army. I captured in this engagement a large amount of ordnance and ordnance stores, together with four or five hundred prisoners. I cannot speak too highly of the gallantry and coolness displayed by Cols. McNair and McCray throughout the entire day, and I have to thank them for the promptness and skill with which they executed orders. Of the two batteries in my division, the one commanded by Capt. Douglas was ordered the evening previous to report to Gen. Cleburne for orders. The other, commanded by Capt. Hum phreys, was with my division during the whole day, and it gives me great pleasure to say that his pieces were handled with surprising skill and ability, and did great execution in the ranks of the enemy. My loss during the entire day in killed, wounded, and missing, was two hundred and twenty-four. Before closing, I must particularly mention the daring bravery and gallant bearing, on the battle-field, of the following members of my staff: Capt. B. S. Johnson, Adj.-gen. ; Capt. B. F. Blackburn, In spector-gen. ; Capt. John Renwick, volunteer aid ; Capt. Jones, Signal Corps, and Lieut. J. M. Rose, Ordnance officer. These officers were ever seen bearing orders through the thickest of the fight, and, at times, in the front of the battle, cheering on my. men to victory. My Division Surgeon, Dr. C. H. Smith, in addition to his professional services upon the field to the wounded, rendered me many valuable services. The officers and men of n\u00bby entire division always met the enemy with unflinching gallantry, and were the proud victors of every field ; and for the privations, hardships, and almost unequalled marches, all of which they have borne without a murmur, they de serve the thanks of their country.

Head-quarters Kirby Smith's Brigade, Lebanon, Ky., Sept. 11, 1862. To Major-gen. E. Kirby Smith, Commanding Army of Kentucky, Lexington, Ky. : The evening of the 13th August I left Kingston, Tenn., with the 1st cavaley, Lieut. Nixon Conoly, 1st Georgia cavalry, Col. Mor rison, and the Buckner Guards, Capt. Jarrett, numbering in the aggregate 896, and passing through Montgomery, and Jamestown, Tenn., Monticello, and Somerset, Ky., reached London on the 17th. During the night of the 16th, when 25 miles from London, I learned that five companies of the 3d Tennessee volunteers, Col W. S. A., were stationed there. I selected 500 men from the com mand and made a forced march, reaching the town about 7 o'clock the next morning, when I attacked the place, and after a brief re sistance by the enemy I captured it, killing 13, wounding 17, and taking 111 prisoners. My loss was one officer and one private killed, none wounded. I took a large number of wagons laden with quarter-masters' and commissary's stores, a number of horses and mules, and several hun dred stands of arms, all of which I have forwarded to you. After leaving London, I employed my command gathering mules, horses, and wagons, that had been left along the road by the af frighted Federals, front London to Mt. Vernon and Richmond. The evening of the 22d, learning that a train was coming (intended for the Pass), guarded by infantry and cavalry, I moved my com mand to meet them. My advance came upon them at Big Still, 17 miles from Richmond, where the fight commenced and resulted as stated in my former report. After driving in their pickets within two miles of Richmond, the morning of the 24th, and gathering up all the trains, horses, and mules, I fell back slowly to the junction of the Wild-cat and Richmond roads, which I reached the evening of the 25th. On the 27th, the 3d Tennessee cavalry, Col. Starns, was added to my command, and I moved on in the direction of Richmond. On the 27th, I made a reconnoissance of the enemy with my whole command, and finding them in position about three miles from Richmond, I fell back four miles to the infantry and reported to Gen. Cleburne, who was in command of the advanced division."], [282, "5G0 official reports of battles. f On the morning of the 30th, in obedience to your orders, I passed around to the west of Richmond, and took possession of the roads leading to Lexington. The majority of my forces were posted on the Lexington road, and one company on the Lancaster road, the remainder between the two rcfads. About 4 o'clock, stragglers from the battle-field commenced passing into my lines, and gradually increased in numbers until 6 o'clock, when the main body of the enemy, apparently about 5000 strong, with 9 pieces of artillery, came upon us. My forces, being well ambuscaded, poured a destructive fire into their ranks, killing about 60, and wounding a large number. The firing commenced, in obedience to my orders, on the extreme left, extending to the right, which was nearest Richmond ; after which, almost the entire force immediately surrendered. Owing to the smallness of my force (about 850), I was unable to still guard the roads and remove all the prisoners to the rear, con sequently, a large number escaped, wandering through the cornfields and woodlands, it being now too dark to distinguish them, when a few paces ahead or distant. I am unable to state\" the number of prisoners taken by my command, owing to the fact that they were captured principally after dark, and during the same night were turned over to Gen. Preston Smith, in obedience to your orders, but am confident they could not fall short of 3500. I captured, also, nine pieces of artillery, a large number of small arms, and wagons loaded with army supplies. Among the prisoners captured, was Brig.-gen. Manson, and a number of field and staff officers. On the morning of the 31st, I moved to the Kentucky river, and drove the rear guard of the enemy from the opposite bank. On the 1st September, I moved on, and camped near Lexington, and on the 2d, moved around Lexington and camped near George town, and the 3d ultimo, we moved on to Frankfort, and hoisted the battle flag of the 1st \" Louisiana\" cavalry, in default of a Con federate flag, on the Capitol of the State, while the rear guard of the enemy, about 8000 strong, were quiet spectators from the op posite hills. The same evening, I detailed all my command, with horses in condition to travel (1450 in number), to pursue the enemy and harass his rear. The next morning, September 4th, they came upon the enemy about sunrise, near Shelbyville, and drove them into and through the town, and then crossed over to the railroad and destroyed the bridges, in obedience to your orders, and re turned to camp near Frankfort. The 6th and 7th remained in"], [283, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 561 camp near Frankfort. My loss, since leaving Kingston, is one of ficer and 6 privates killed, 21 wounded, and 9 taken prisoners. Since reaching London, I have captured four thousand prisoners, (including those turned over to Gen. Smith and those parolled by me,) about 375 wagon's, mostly laden with provisions and army stores, near 1500 mules, and a large number of horses. It has been impossible to keep an account of the wagons recaptured by my com mand, owing to the rapidity of my movements. I cannot close this report without bearing testimony to the sol dierly conduct of my command. They have endured unusual pri vations and fatigues without murmur. I cannot compliment the commanders of the brigades too highly for the assistance rendered me. I would mention, that the first 106 miles of our march, over a rough and barren country, was made in 42 hours, having been de layed one day, on account of getting our horses shod. The statement of the property captured at Frankfort was handed in to your head-quarters by me, in person, on Saturday last. My forces have been materially reduced by the numerous details which I found it necessary to make, in order to remove wagons and stock to the rear, and I shall use my utmost endeavors to concen trate my command at as early a day as possible.

They were not drilled, were badly equipped, and very indifferently armed with shot guns and Tennessee rifles. None of the cavalry had eith er sabres or pistols, and were only partly armed, with double-bar relled shot-guns ; no other equipments whatever. There was much sickness among the new troops, so that the forces for the defence of Fort Henry and Fort Heiman did not amount to more than 2,600 effective men. There were also at Fort Henry the steamers Dun bar, Capt. Fowler ; Lynn Boyd, Capt. Smedley ; Appleton Belle, Capt. Heffernan, (regular packet from the fort to Danville,) the Samuel Orr and the Patton. The latter two boats were used for hospitals. General Tilghman's division head-quarters being at Fort Donel son, where he was untiring in his exertions to complete the defences of that post, Fort Henry, during his absence, was under my com mand. On the morning of the 4th instant, at half-past four o'clock, the sentinel at our three-gun battery announced a rocket signal from the picket at Bailey's landing, which was immediately answer ed by a rocket from the fort, when three more rockets went up from the picket, announcing the approach of three of the enemy's gunboats. The eleven guns bearing on the river were immediately manned and shotted, and every thing held in readiness for an attack. The steamers were all moved out of range of the enemy's gunboats, and the Dunbar and Boyd were dispatched to Paris landing for the two regiments stationed there. I sent a courier to Gen. Tilgh man, at Fort Donelson, informing him of these facts. Shortly after daylight, the pickets on both sides of the river reported a large fleet coming up, and the smoke from several gunboats now became visible over the island. I directed Capt. Ellis, of the 10th, with a small escort of mounted men, to proceed down on the right bank of the river, and Capt. Anderson, of the same regiment, on the op posite bank, to reconnoitre, and ascertain whether the enemy was landing troops. I directed Capt. Milner, with his company of cavalry, to occupy the several roads leading from Bailey's landing to the fort, and throw forward a sufficient number of pickets and videttes. I directed Col. Drake to send two companies of his regi ment and a section of Culbertson's battery to the rifle-pits, for the defence of the Dover road, about three-quarters of a mile from the fort, while Major Garvin, occupied the rifle-pits across the road,"], [286, "564 OFFICIAL REPORTS \u00b0F BATTLES. leading to Bailey's landing. Twelve torpedoes were sunk in the chute of the river at the foot of the island. For want of powder and time, none were sunk in the main channel. Those sunk were rendered utterly useless by the heavy rise in the river. At about nine o'clock, the gunboats commenced throwing shells at the quar ters of our pickets and other buildings in the neighborhood of Bailey's landing. Capt. Ellis returned, reporting eight gunboats and ten large transports in' the river, and that they were landing their cavalry. He also stated that he had seen two light batteries or barges, but that no troops were at that time landing on the opposite side of the river. I again sent a courier to Gen. Tilghman, informing him of these facts. During all this time he had a large force at work on the epaulments, and trying to keep the water out of the fort. The lower magazine had already two feet of water in it, and the ammu nition had been removed to a temporary magazine above ground, which had but very little protection, but we had been at work day and night for the last week, to cover it with sand-bags and to pro tect it by a traverse. At about 12 o'clock, five gunboats came in sight in the main channel. All the troops, except the heavy artil lery force, were marched out of range of the enemy's guns. The gunboats formed in line of battle across the channel, about two miles below the fort, beyond the range of our 32-pounders. I gave positive orders that none of these guns should be fired, unless the boats came within their range ; therefore, we had only to depend on the 24-pounder rifle-gun, and the 10-inch columbiad, the latter gun with an iron carriage on an iron chassie, had, on previous trials of firing with twenty-pound charges, proved defective, owing to the too great recoil for the length of the chassie, or other defects. This was, however, remedied by clamping the carriage to the chassie, and even then it recoiled with such tremendous force against the hurters, that in almost every instance it disarranged the pintle. I have since learned that this defect was common to these guns. At about one o'clock, the gunboats opened fire with shell and shot, which was immediately returned by our rifled gun, and 10-inch columbiad. The former fired archer shells. At the third or fourth fire, one of the clamps of the columbiad broke, and fearing that another fire would upset the gun, it was not fired again. The rifled gun was fired in quick succession, and with good effect ; meanwhile the gunboats kept up a constant fire with good practice. As the boats advanced, we opened fire with the eleven guns bearing on the river, which was kept up for about halt^an hour, when the enemy"], [287, "565 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. withdrew. Their shot fell in and around the fort. Some of their shells fell a quarter of a mile beyond the fort, showing a range su perior to our own. None of the shells which fell in the fort exploded, and but one man was wounded. I reported the result to Gen. Tilghman, and that the enemy was landing a large force, and that additional transports were arriving. I was satisfied that we could not hold the heights opposite the fort, and that it would be prudent to move the forces from there to Fort Henry, but did not like to take the responsibility, without the order of Gen. Tilghman, as a previous order from you stated positively that these heights must be held. However, these troops were held in readiness to move at a moment's warning. At five o'clock I sent another courier, with an escort, to the general, stating my views in regard to the troops at Fort Heiman, and requesting his orders, \" or what I desired more, his presence,\" and cautioned him not to come with out a strong escort, and by the upper road, believing that the enemy had already cavalry pickets on the main Dover road. Be fore night, I reinforced the outposts on the Dover road with two companies of the 10th Tennessee, under Capts. Morgan and Ford, and the 6-pounder rifled gun. At half-past eleven, Gen. Tilghman and Major Gilmer's corps of engineers arrived, with three com panies of Lieut.-col. Gantt's cavalry, from Fort Donelson. At day light, on the morning of the 5th, Gen. Tilghman directed the removal of the troops from Fort Heiman to Fort Henry, with the exception of the cavalry. Gen. Tilghman now formed the troops at the fort into two brigades. The first commanded by myself, con sisting of the 10th Tennessee, Lieut.-col. McGavock, 48th Tennes see, Col. Browder, 51st Tennessee, Col. Voorhies,*Col. Gantt's bat talion of Cavalry, and Capt. Culbertson's light battery. The second brigade, under command of Col. Drake, consisted of the 4th Missis sippi, Major Adair, 27th Alabama, Col. Hughes, Alabama battalion, Major Garvin, Capts. Milner's and Melton's cavalry, and section of light battery, Capt. Clare. He appointed Major McComice assistant-adj.-gen., and Lieut. Phar aid-de-camp, his own staff hav ing remained at Fort Donelson. Gen. Tilghman assigned each brigade its position at the rifle-pits, and aU preparations were made to receive the enemy by land and water. A reconnoitring party of cavalry met the enemy, and in a skir mish one man 6f Capt. Milner's company was killed. Gen. Tilgh man then ordered out a battalion of the 10th Tennessee, a battalion of the 4th Mississippi, and Milner's cavalry, and proceeded in person with them to the scene of the skirmish, but the enemy had retired."], [288, "566 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. During the night, Col. Milton A. Haynes, of the artillery, arrived from Fort Donelson to give his aid in the coming engagement, and brought information that in obedience . to orders from Gen. Tilgh man, Col. Head would send two regiments to Kirkman's furnace from Fort Donelson next morning, which is half way between the forts, to act as a reserve. Early on the morning of the 6th, heavy volumes of black smoke rose over the island, manifesting that the fleet was not to remain idle long ; and judging from the number of transports in the river, they must have landed a very large force during the two days and nights ; and, as it was afterwards ascer tained, Gen. Grant had 12,000 men between the fort and Bailey's landing, and Gen. Smith 6,000 men on the opposite bank of the river. At about ten o'clock in the morning, Gen. Tilghman and Major Gilmer came in a small boat from the steamer Dunbar, which was lying during the night at Fort Heiman, and prepared for the engagement on hand. At eleven o'clock the gunboats made their appearance in the chute, seven in number, and formed in line of battle two miles from the fort. Gen. Tilghman ordered the troops to be marched out of range of the enemy's guns. None were per mitted to remain in the fort but those on duty with the artillery, who were under the command of Capt. Taylor. \u2022 Gen. Tilghman, with his staff, took position at the centre battery, to observe the movements of the gunboats, and direct the firing of our batteries. The enemy opened fire with shot and shell, which was returned by our 10-inch columbiad and 24-pounder rifled gun, until they came in range of the lighter guns, when the whole eleven guns bearing on the river opened fire. The enemy's practice im proved as they advanced. The firing on both sides was without a moment's intermission. Shot after shot were exchanged, with ad mirable rapidity and precision, and the enemy's shell struck and exploded in every direction. Unfortunately, our most reliable gun, the 24-pounder rifle, bursted, wounding all the men who served it. Shortly afterwards the vent of the 10-inch columbiad closed, and could not be opened. Our reliance was now on the 32 and 42 pounders, and, I regret to state, for the latter we had not the proper ammunition. Shortly afterwards, a premature explosion of one of the guns killed two men. By this time we had lost the use of five guns, but a constant fire was kept up on both sides, the gunboats nearing all the time ; their point-blank range telling fearfully on the fort, while we had to depress our guns and change our range after every shot. This unequal fire was kept up with an energy which does great credit to the officers and men at the guns."], [289, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 567 This fearful cannonading had lasted now over an hour, and it was evident the fort could not hold out much longer. Major Gilmer called my attention to the state of affairs, requesting me to state to Gen. Tilghman that it was useless to hold out longer ; to keep up this useless contest would cost the fives of many more, without any possible advantage to the result. I replied to Major Gilmer that these were my views, but that I would not like to make any sugges tions to the general ; that he must be his own judge in regard to this affair. When Gen. Tilghman was shortly after reminded of the state of affairs, he would not entertain the idea of a surrender, stating that he had as yet lost but few men, and inquired the reason why some of the guns had ceased firing. He was told that several of the men were killed, many wounded, and all the rest exhausted, and that we had no men to relieve them. The general threw off his coat, sprang on the chassie of the nearest gun, stating that he would work it himself, ordering, at the same time, fifty men of my regiment to the fort to assist the gunners. Seeing nobody whom I could send for them, I started myself, the bombardment still going on unabated ; but, before I could reach the command, the boats were so close to the fort that further resistance was impossible. The flag was hauled down, and the firing ceased. I returned, in person, immediately to the fort for further orders. Gen. Tilghman informed me that he had surrendered, believing that it was his duty to do so, as every military man would see the impos sibility of holding the fort against such fearful odds, and stating to me that I was not included in the surrender, as I was not in the fort at the time the flag was struck, and directed me to continue the retreat according to orders at Fort Donelson, by the upper road, having gained all the time necessary for a safe retreat. Owing to bad roads, the high water, and the close pursuit of the enemy's cavalry, I found it a physical impossibility to save the fight artil lery. About three miles from the fort, our rear was attacked by the enemy's cavalry. Their fire was handsomely returned by Col. Gee and Major Garvin. Major Lee, of the 15th Arkansas, and Captain Leach, of the Alabama battalion, were surrounded and made prison ers. We sustained no other loss. I may be permitted to state, that the self-sacrificing heroism dis played by Gen. Tilghman in this terrible and most unequal struggle, challenges the admiration of all gallant men, and entitles him to the gratitude of the whole people of the Confederate States. The tact, skill, and untiring energy which characterized his whole course,"], [290, "568 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. while in command of the defence of the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers, proved him a most skilful and gallant leader. During the bombardment of Fort Henry, Gen. Tilghman was ably assisted by Major Gilmer, Col. Haynes, Major McComice, Capts. Miller and Haydon (Engineers), Capt. Taylor, Lieuts. Watts and Weller, and Capt. G. R. G. Jones, and the men under their command deserve particular credit for the effective and energetic manner in which they managed their guns. My thanks are eminently due to Col. Drake, and the regimental and detachment commanders, for the able and orderly manner in which they conducted their commands. The events which followed so closely upon the fall of Fort Henry \u2014 the surrender of the troops at Fort Donelson, and my own im prisonment (from which I have just been released), have prevented me from forwarding this report at an earlier date. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, (Signed) A. HEIMAN, Col. commanding 1st Brigade, Tilghman? s Division. Answer of Col. Forrest to Interrogations propounded by the Spe- cial Committee of the House of Representatives of the Confed- erate Congress, charged with the duty of inquiring into the management of the Quarter-master and Commissary Depart- ment, about the time of the surrender of the City of Nashville. Interrogatory 1st. \u2014 I was not at the city of Nashville at the time of its surrender, but was there at the time the enemy made their entrance into that part of the city known as Edgefield, having left Fort Donelson, with my command, on the morning of its surrender, and reached Nashville on Tuesday, February 18th, about 10 o'clock A. m. I remained in the city up to the Sunday evening following. Interrogatory 2d. \u2014 It would be impossible to state from the data before me, the value of the stores, either in the quarter-master or commissary departments. Having no papers then, nor any pre vious knowledge of the stores. The stores in the quarter-master's department consisted of all stores necessary to the department \u2014 clothing, especially, in large amounts, shoes, harness, etc., with considerable unmanufactured material. The commissary stores, were meat, flour, sugar, molasses, and coffee. There was a very"], [291, "OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. 569 large amount of meat in store, and on the landing, at my arrival though large amounts had already been carried away by citizens. Interrogatory 3d. \u2014 A portion of these stores had been removed before the surrender. A considerable amount of meat on the land ing, I w^as informed, was thrown into the river on Sunday, before my arrival, and carried off by the citizens. The doors of the com missary depot were thrown open, and the citizens, in dense crowds, were packing and hauling off the balance, at the time of my arrival, on Tuesday. The quarter-master's stores were also open, and the citizens were invited to come and help themselves, which they did, in larger crowds, if possible, than at the other department. Interrogatories 4th and 5th. \u2014 On Tuesday morning, I was or dered by Gen. Floyd to take command of the city, and attempted to drive the mob from the doors of the departments, which mob was composed of straggling soldiers and citizens of all grades. The mob had taken possession of the city to that extent, that every spe cies of property was unsafe. Houses were closed, carriages and wagons were concealed, to prevent the mob from taking possession of them. Houses were being seized everywhere. I had to call out my cavalry, and after every other means failed, charge the mob, before I could get it so dispersed as to get wagons to the doors of the departments, to load up the stores for transportation. After the mob was partially dispersed and quiet restored, a number of cit izens furnished wagons and assisted in loading them. I was busily engaged in this work on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. I trans ported 700 large boxes of clothing to the Nashville and Chattanoo ga railroad depot, several hundred bales osnaburgs and other mili tary goods from the quarter-master's department, most, if not all the shoes having been seized by the mob. I removed about 700 or 800 wagon loads of meat. The high water having destroyed the bridges, so as to stop the transportation over the Nashville and Chattanooga railroad, I had large amounts of this meat taken over the Tennessee and Alabama railroad. By examination on Sunday morning, I found a large amount of fixed ammunition, in the shape of cartridges and ammunition for light artillery, in the magazine, which, with the assistance of Gen. Harding, I conveyed over seven miles on the Tennessee and Alabama railroad, in wagons, to the amount of 30 odd wage* loads, after the enemy had reached the river. A portion was sent on to Murfreesboro' in wagons. The quarter-master stores which had not already fallen into the hands of the mob, were all removed, save a lot of rope, loose shoes, and a large number of tents. The mob had already possessed themselves"], [292, "570 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. of a large amount of these stores. A large quantity of meat was left in store, and on the river bank, and some at the Nashville and Chattanooga railroad depot, on account of the break in the railroad. I cannot estimate the amount, as several storehouses had not been opened up to the time of my leaving. All stores left fell into the hands of the enemy, except forty pieces of light artillery, which were burned and spiked by order of Gen. Floyd, as were the guns at Fort Zollicoffer. My proposition to remove these stores, made by telegraph, to Murfreesboro', had the sanction of Gen. A. S. Johnston. Interrogatory 6th. No effort was made, save by the mob, who were endeavoring to possess themselves of these stores, to prevent their removal, and a very large amount was taken off before I was placed in command of the city. Interrogatory 7th. It was (eight days) from the time the quar ter-master left the city before the arrival of the enemy \u2014 commissar ies and other persons connected with these departments leaving at the same time. With proper diligence on their part, I have no doubt all the public stores might have been transported to places of safety. Interrogatory 8th. Up to Saturday the railroads were open, and might have been used to transport these stores. Saturday the bridges of the Nashville and Chattanooga railroad gave way. Be sides these modes of conveyance, a large number of wagons might have been obtained, had the quiet and order of the city been main tained, and large additional amounts of stores might, by these means, have been transported to places of safety. Interrogatories 9th and 10th. \u2014 I saw no officer connected with the quarter-master or commissary departments, except Mr. Patton, who left on Friday. I did not, at any time, meet or hear of Major J. K. Stevenson in the city during my stay there. Interrogatories 11th, 12th and 13th. \u2014 From my personal knowl edge, I can say nothing of the manner in which Major Stevenson left the city. Common rumor and many reliable citizens informed me that Major Stevenson lest by a special train, Sunday evening, February the 16th, taking personal baggage, furniture, carriage, and carriage horses ; the train ordered by himself as President of the railroad. . Interrogatory 14th. All the means of transportation were ac tually necessary for the transportation of Government stores, of sick and wounded soldiers \u2014 many of whom fell into the hands of the enemy for want of it, and who might have been saved by the"], [293, "571 OFFICIAL REPORTS OF BATTLES. proper use of the means at hand. The necessity for these means of transportation for stores will be seen by the above \u25a0 answers which I have given. I have been compelled to be as brief as pos sible, in making the above answers, my whole time being engaged, as we seem to be upon the eve of another great battle. The city was in a much worse condition than I can convey the idea of, on paper, and the loss of public stores must be estimated by millions of dollars. The panic was entirely useless, and not at all justified by the circumstances. Gen. Harding and the Mayor of the city, with Mr. Williams, deserve special mention for assistance rendered in removing the public property. In my judgment, if the quarter master and commissary had remained at their post, and worked diligently, with the means at their command, the Government stores might all have been saved between the time of the fall of Fort Donelson and the arrival of the enemy in Nashville.
