Worthy Sir, Having had the honour of being known to you during thirty years, allow me to congratulate you upon your retirement from the Majesterial-chair of the first commercial City in the world; your elevation to which may justly be considered as having been the honourable reward of personal-worth and mercantile-integrity. Your election, under circumstances which rejoiced every lover of order and the decencies of civilized-life, however liberal his political- sentiments and religious-opinions might have been, became a salutary reproof to that licentiousness of expression in which public-writers, most lamentably for the morals of the country, too frequently indulge ; and will effect more to repress blasphemy and sedition than all the terrors of legal-prosecution. On your retirement from the arduous duties of Lord Mayor of London, allow me to express my hope that many years of repose await you before your exemplar of consistency of character shall be completed in the world. I beg to remain, Worthy Sir, Your very humble Servant, JAMES USHER."], [11, "BUONAPATE, THE ROYAL EXCHANGE, ODES OF HORACE, etc. etc For vacant then the throne of right, But waited for the soul of might, And that which was possess'd by none, Th' Adventurer well might claim his own. Thy title surely was as good As Philip's, though of Bourbon-blood. NAPOLEONE BUONAPARTE. The chief I sing, whose meteor blaze Scar'd nations in these latter days ; Who seiz'd the spirit of his time, Enthusiasm produc'd by Crime. And Europe's Kings in dust abas'd, Their kingdoms from their station raz'd, For Pride, destruction's power, shall call, A haughty spirit claims a fall. To name thy conquests, what th' avail ? For thy renown shall never fail. Toulon first saw thy glory blaze, When forc'd the English from the place, Fame pledg'd thee then the Gallic-boast, O'er Europe to conduct their host, All Europe's institutions shake, Her energies anew t'awake ; And then, effect of dire excess, Of confidence from long success, Thy conquests all away to throw In Russia's deadly was'e of snow ; AVhen point d'appui did not remain Through fatal treach'ry towards Spain, Until, at Waterloo's blood-field, The doom of Europe was repeal'd. At Wilna, had'st though check'd thine haste Infatuate, 'till had winter pass'd, Magog unseated from his throne, Moscovia had been all thine own ! By tyrant-rule to frenzy wrought, France in her madness Europe caught, And the world's order was revers'd, By those to whom was Freedom curs'd .- For History shall prolong their stench, No race ferocious as the French ; New Zealand cannibals come here, See Savages you'd scorn to peer; Yon kill to feast upon the slain, The French to gloat upon their pain. Let Europe timely warning take, Ne'er suffer faction's power t'awake. Look on Columbia's wild domains, Where democratic-phrenzy reigns, Where Lynch's law, and slavery's curse, The fiendish passions keep at nurse. Thy fraud and force alike were vain, To consummate the doom of Spain. The blood which o'er the land was shed, Was challeng'd on thy treach'rous head, And retribution rend'red Spain An ulcer, all thy power to drain. Nor Spain alone thy treach'ry knew ; The guests to France, thy fame which drew, Usurp'd from all which life holds dear, Were kept in thraldom's gripe severe. And here was retribution plain As in thy perfidy to Spain. From wife, and heir, and climate mild, To sea-girt rock thou wert exil'd, Where burning sunbeams o'er thy head, And burning thoughts, corrosion bred. When, envious of Great Britain's weal, Gaul sought a spiteful blow to deal ; And colonies, which Britain's wealth Had nourish'd into vigorous health, Excited 'gainst the parent-state Allegiance due t' exchange for hate; The way was shewn for lawless might, In retribution' s-power t' alight ; Her institutions all t'o'erthrow, And fill the land with crime and woe. The scourge of Europe to become, And scarce leave Liberty a home ; Till Napoleon's mighty soul Subjected frenzy to control The human billows in their pride, O'er Europe caus'd to pour their tide. When Revolution's sanguine flood, O'er all the country curdling stood, 'Twas thine the deluge foul t'abate, To order to convert the state ; And all may thank the warrior's hand, Which bade Convulsion's demon stand ; Yet Englishmen must never plead The banishment by law decreed No moral-burthen human-state Can constitute or abrogate ; Stern truth will never be gainsay'd, England thy confidence betray'd."], [12, "2 But Britons would not yield the plain, Though nine of ten were struck or slain. Had, Britain, thou but duly weighed The power which in thy hands was laid, The mighty energies of mind, That with Napoleone were enshrin'd, And sent him western wilds to range, And anarchy to order change; For, England's honour claim'd thy trust, From England was thy doom unjust, But sovereign justice, that decreed To render retribution's meed. For on this earth, though treason's seat, Its doom doth treason often meet. Vengeance is mine, proclaims the Lord, By me, is retribution stor'd ; At peril, mortals vain oppress, At peril, too, usurp redress. But in calm life, not on the throne, Must human character be known. Napoleone ! There thy gentle-mind For ever watch'd an office kind ; Nor e'er didst thou, 'midst utmost strife, Lose the fond sympathies of life. The rage of warfare long hath ceas'd, And mutual wrongs have been appeas'd. Let History on the judgment-seat, Th' impartial summing-up repeat. From court, weak prejudice retire, Calm'd foes, thy gallantry admire. Or light on prejudice to pour, And China to the world restore, What energies had been awoke, Now held in mental-thraldom's yoke ! For trade, what op'nings been set wide, Now clos'd 'gainst the commercial tide. What tyranny had been o'erthrown, In people vested, or in one ! All these a thousand years may sleep, Now settled in stagnation deep. Though strange it seem, not more than true, Convulsion, order must renew ; This world, ordain'd the seat of strife, Its functions must be rous'd to life; E'en matter, though it lies as dead, Ferments, and lifts its pond'rous head, And like a living soul awake, Seems vital-energy to take. When Europe's wars had nearly clos'd, The gallic-tactics were expos'd ; Where food for fire was ne'er denied, Though to crush hundreds thousands died. Urge forward still the deep array. Cost what it will to win the day ; Unlike the dauntless British line, But timid Britain held the prize In useless grasp, unjust, unwise ; As like a vixen she would say, Should Europe dare to cross her way, You'll rue the day which rous'd my rage, And loos'd the lion from his cage. Where single enemies combine, In purpose not to be repeal'd, Each individual claims the field. And, Britain, Providence ordain'd, By thee, dominions should be gain'd ; For had but Grouchy brav'd defeat, Thy victory p'rhaps were not complete ; The laurels with'red on his brows His lion-heart was not appall'd Though by the lion's grasp enthrall' d, Had length of life not been denied, Or soon or late he'd ris'n in pride, And shewn he was not kept in awe, E'en by the lion's gaping jaw. But expectation's with'ring mood, His vital energy subdu'd. Ere Sol to the meridian rose. Give me the man whose deeds evince Th' allegiance which he bears his Prince ; Whose heart is ever quick to feel The right occasion for warm zeal. Nor order calmly waits exact With energy when bound to act, And when e'en treason is not worse What, Britain, could thy fear beguile T'enclose him in the lonesome Isle ? Thou didst but share the gen'ral fear, Which sat a night-mare on the sphere. The world it may be truly said, Of Napoleone was afraid ! Than hesitation's certain curse. Which prince and friend the fatal hour, Leaves struggling with destruction's power. Unlike the dog, whose zeal sincere Defies restraint with danger near. At Waterloo thine honour slain, Shall, Grouchy, never breathe again. THE CONFLAGRATION. In the City sits Commerce in sorrow pro- found, Why, Wellington, with patience dire, Stood'st thou so long the havoc fire ? More heroes thou could'st not have lost, If storm'd the cannon at their cost, And won the field at noon-day fight Completely as at fall of night. For what 'gainst Britons can prevail Unless artillery burst in hail ? The Temple of Mammon is burnt to the ground, And all the Queen's subjects from east-end to west At such a disaster are sorely distressed.

Shadrach, Meshec, Abednego, worthies indeed, Shall never a proselyte make to their creed ; For Protestant, Catholic, Moslem, and Jew, All hasten unanimous vows to renew. The Poet exhorts him to pleasure on consideration of the approach of Spring and the brevity of Human Life. Stern Winter's mellowing by degrees, Through changeful Spring and Western- breeze ; Huge engines haul the ships from shore ; The homestead cattle seek no more, Nor Ploughman doth his hearth delight, Nor frosts invest the meads with white, By moonlight, Venus leads the dance, The Graces and blythe Nymphs advance, The greensward with alternate feet To the soft timbrel's measure beat, While Vulcan bids the forges glow, And Cyclops to their labour go. Flute, sackbut, harp, psalt'ry, nor dulcimer light, Like the charm of self-int'rest their zeal can excite ; For Protestant, Catholic, Moslem, and Jew, Fall down, as by instinct, when Mammon they view. No need of a furnace once heated seven- fold, Their zeal to enkindle for mammon of gold; For Protestant, Catholic, Moslem, and Jew, G reat Mammon ! alike are thy worshippers It now behoves the jovial brows To deck with fragrant myrtle-boughs, Or such gay flowers as doth relent Kind earth to give them nourishment. true.

O favour'd Sestius, brief the sum Fond life admits us to presume ; Soon darkness waits us, and the ghosts Oft talk'd of, Pluto's dreary coasts, Where dice no longer shall decide, Who must our toast-master preside ; Soft Lycia you no more admire, Whom girls all envy \u2014 men desire. Time's not indeed distant when from the whole world, As from a vast censer, shall incense be curl'd ; Then Protestant, Catholic, Moslem, and Jew, Shall be offer'd to Mammon in sacrifice due. All hail to great Mammon, o'er this world who reigns By the magic of int'rest, all things that or- dains ; Pagan, Protestant, Catholic, Moslem, and Jew, No matterwhat else, are thy worshippers true.

What youth genteel, bedew'd with sweets In roseate-bowers, blythe Pyrrha greets, For whom your auburn locks you bind With simplest grace, love's toils design'd ? Alas ! how oft shall broken vows, And changeful powers, his heart oppose ; How shall he gaze on raging seas, The placid stream who sails at ease, Make a friend of the mammon o'er this world who rules, Light's children, with mammon's compar'd, are but fools ; When all fails beside, deep-reserve is in store, All may that will enter, it still craves for more."], [14, "4 HORACE, B. 1.

Devoted youth ! Thy woe's to come. I have already met my doom. In Neptune's fane, a votive -plate Shews whence my dropping robes I date. TO PYRRHA. Another Version. What youth genteel, whom odours dew, Delightful Pyrrha, sports with you, Where roses breathe perfume ? With simplest grace your auburn hair, Each toil for passion fond, prepare To best ensure his doom. Rack-off your cheerful wine, be wise By life's frail term your hopes chastise, Ev'n whilst we speak, doth envious time Exhaust the moments of our prime. Then seize the day of joy that flies, To-morrow may not cheer our eyes. 2. Alas ! How oft perfidious love, And changeful powers, he'll surely prove, And treach'rous seas declaim : HORACE, B. 1. ODE 13. Who, credulous, with ardent joys, Your constancy, he thinks, employs, Fond love's ingenuous flame ! The Poet describes his Jealousy. Whene'er, O Lydia, you pretend, The neck of Telephus to commend, Fresh with the glow of healthful bloom, Alas ! with choler I consume ; No confidence my spirit knows, My conscious colour comes and goes, Involuntary tears my cheek Steal-down, and inward-conflict speak. I'm fir'd, if quarrelsome, you've drain'd The wine-cup, and your shoulder stain'd, Or that the youth's intemp'rate love Your lips his teeth imprinted prove. If with attention you receive Advice, you never will believe, Due kindness constantly to meet From him that wounds with kisses sweet Kisses which Venus steeps divine, In the quintessence of her wine, Not nectar-drops so sweet as this, Not nectar exquisite in bliss. O more than happy thrice, the souls Indissoluble love controls, Whom harsh upbraidings, impious breath, Ne'er parts \u2014 they only part in death. S.

HORACE, B. 1. ODE 9 To Thaliarehus, Whom Horace exhorts to pass the Winter cheerfully. You see Soracte's alpine-height, With gath'ring snows stands clad in white, Nor labouring woods the weight can bear, Streams stagnate in the gelid air. Dissolve the frost of winter's dearth, With billets pile the social hearth, Free Thaliarehus, now draw forth Rich Sabine juice of four years' birth, Leave to the guardian powers the rest, Who gusts tempestuous have suppress'd With fervid ocean late which strove, Nor cypress now, nor ash-trees move. Avoid to-morrow's luck t'enquire What fortune shall bestow, admire, Count it a token sure for gain ; Nor, since a jocund youth, disdain In love's delightful sports t' engage, While hoariness shuns blooming age.

To wrangle o'er the joyous bowl, Is downright madness, on my soul ; Protect, confed'rate Pals, I pray, Good-fellowship from savage fray. How horrible to calm delights The sabre which the Turk excites ! Kind souls, your disputation cease, And on your elbow sink to peace ; The social cup if mine to share, My heart's own Brother shall declare ; In what soft languishment he lies, Beneath what thrilling shaft he dies ; What, from the bargain, do you shrink ? Not upon lighter terms I drink : What ever grade of passion claims To sere you with intemp'rate flames, No silly sense of shame should move The man that's handcuff'd to sweet love ; Be frank, whate'er the case appears, Confide the truth to candid ears. To his Lyre. Being desired to write a secular Ode, Horace invokes his Lyre to assist him with strains equal to the subject. Now, on our mettle, since we're plac'd \u2014 If in the shade \u2014 amusement chaste, Fond themes I've chaunted by your aid, To time's extent to be conveyed ; Come, dearest lyre, while comrades list, And in a Latin ode assist.

Lost man I In what a drowning state, Are you found struggling hard with fate ; Youth, whom a worthier heart should move, But who can break the charm of love ?

As Proculeius obtains Your large possessions you must leave, No more your mansion shall receive, At that delightful country-seat, No longer visits to repeat, Well stor'd with all that life can cheer, Which yellow Tiber washes near, But leave, the fruit of so much care, Your high-pil'd riches to your Heir. A name, while brotherhood remains, Exhausted when through age at length, Shall fame renew perpetual strength ; On pinions never tir'd, proclaim The sacred honours of his name. So he that craving can suppress, An ampler lordship shall possess Than one that Lybia should unite, O'er seas, with Gades out of sight; Subject to whose exalted throne, Were seats of either Carthage known. Ah! Dellius, it shall nought avail, Whether illustrious your entail, From ancient Inachus dedue'd, Or from plebian-race confus'd ; You live without a humble shed, To shelter from the wind your head, The victim of relentless death, A mortal, you must yield your breath.

I sought with thee Phillippi's field, Where, swift in flight, was left my shield, When valour was itself o'erthrown, The daring van their faces prone ; But Mercury's power, whilst sore afraid, My frame through hostile ranks convey'd, Spread the dense cloud to skreen my life And neutraliz'd the powers at strife. Thee, the reciprocating main Bore on its surge to toils again, For this, to Jove, an offering due Present, your war worn limbs renew, O stretch beneath my laural shade Nor spare the casks for you by-laid, Fill to the brim the polish'd bowls With massic rich that care controls, Pour ointment from capacious shells That with Arabian fragrance smells.

At this, sly Venus lauglis, I trow, A laugh the heartless nymphs bestow, Whilst cruel Cupid, that his darts May deeper pierce unguarded hearts, The spindle with fresh fury turns Until the reeking whetstone burns. Quintus Hirpinius, O forbear!

Besides all this, our hopeful boys Are growing victims to your joys, Nor will the vet'rans quit the dome While keeps the faithless fair at home ; Though threat' ning, still delay to go, Nor can th' inglorious fetters throw. With reckless haste, youth flies away And beauty yields to swift decay, Sapless old age gay love expels, And interrupts sleep's gentle spells; The flowers of spring no hues retain The moon is quickly on the wane, Why then distract th' unequal mind Some durable result to find ? Why rather not, whilst health gives power, Thus carelessly dissolve the hour, Beneath some lofty plane recline Or the broad shadow of this pine, Our hoary locks with roses bound, And Syrian odours breathing round, While generous wine the taste regales For Bacchus o'er dull care prevails. Quick, boy, the rich Falernian cool, Plunge goblets in the gurgling pool, Who will the vagrant wanton court, Blythe Lyde, from her house to sport ? Quick, bid with ivory lyre repair, Nor stay to braid her tempting hair, Content if gath'red in a knot, Simple, as by the Spartans taught You, for their sons, grave matrons dread And thrifty fathers shake the head, Blythe girls, as soon as married, quake, Their husbands lest your charms retake. HORACE, B. 2. ODE 10. To Licinius Murena, Whom the Poet advises to be content with a mean and to maintain an equality of Temper. Be sure, Licinius, in the mean The course of Life is most serene, Not always wide at sea to keep Nor in-shore timidly to creep, And shun the foaming billows more Than danger of the leward shore ; Whoe'er the golden-mean secures The sordid cell alike abjures, In comfort obsolete ; as wise, The dome which envy wakes, decries, The loftiest pines the winds most try, High towers the heaviest ruin lie, And thunderbolts are sure to seek, The rock's most elevated peak. The well-provided breast finds cheer In hope, 'midst poverty severe; Prosperity as well corrects By fear, that change of scene expects ; 'Tis the same Jupiter, we say, Stern winter brings, and bears away, Not so anon, though hideous now, With rigid frost and drifted snow ; Sometimes Apollo wakes the lyre, The bow not always to require Drawn taut : when straight becomes your course, With spirits boyant onwards force ; By the same rule, close reef your sail Too much at mercy of the gale.

Insist not that the wounds and scars In fierce Numanua's length'ned Wars, Dread Hannibal, Sicilian flood, Inflam'd with Carthaginian blood, Should breathe, adapted to the lyre, Which themes congenial ought t' inspire ; Nor Lapith\u00e6, with cruel breast, Nor Hyl\u00e6us with rich wine oppress'd And earth-bom youths, of effort rude, By might Herculean once subdued, From whom old Saturn's splendid seat Th\" assault of treason fear'd to meet. Mec\u00e6nas, you, with happier grace, Shall C\u00e6sar's triumphs give to praise, The necks of haughty monarch's fierce In history's faithful page rehearse. It is for me the Muses' will To celebrate Licymnia's skill,"], [19, "9 My mistress' thrilling strains recite, The glancings of her eyes of light, Her breast to love and friendship dear, Her breast to plighted love sincere : 'Tis her's with matchless grace t' advance Her instep in the skilful dance, Or, in fond dalliance with her friend, With sportive raillery to contend, HORACE, B. 2. ODE 15. The Poet contrasts the thriftiness and frugality of ancient times with modern luxury and ex- travagance. \" Our pompous piles will leave us now Few acres for the foodful plough,\" The ponds which waste the flowery mead, The spacious Lucrine Lake exceed \" And unproductive planes invade\" Our elm- trees' beneficial shade. Then violet banks and myrtle groves, With all the tribe which Flora loves, In fancy's charms, their odours shed, Where olives once their master fed. Or Virgins tight, her arms display, On chaste Diana's festal day. One of those tresses would you change Which o'er Licymnia's brows arrange, For all Arch\u00e6mines possess'd, Mygdonian wealth of Phrygia bless'd, Or dwellings of Arabia proud, Which treasures out of reck'ning croud ; When to the kiss her neck she turns, The kiss with love's pure flame which burns, Or with feign'd cruelty denies That love may ravish as his prize, Or, with quick fondness none can match, Anticipates you by a snatch. No fervid rays may now pervade, Where the dense laurel forms the shade. Not so did Romulus ordain, Or Cato bid the customs reign ; Contracted was each private-store, To yield the Commonwealth the more. No galleries wide our sires possess'd, For northern breezes cool t' invest. Strict laws the household architect, Forbade the casual turf reject ; HORACE, B. 2. ODE 14. While temples which the gods enshrin'd, With just magnificence design'd ; At common-cost was giv'n command, Each public edifice to stand. To Posthumus. That since Death can be neither avoided nor delayed, we ought to make a generous use of Riches whilst life remains. O Posthumus, with subtle speed, The fleeting years glide on indeed, Nor Piety can cause delay, To creeping age with wrinkles grey ; Grim Death's insuperable claim, Who triumphs o'er the noblest name. From day to day could you devote Three hundred bullocks, vain the thought, To soften gloomy Pluto dread, Who binds Geryon's triple head, And Tityos, with that dismal flood Which must be pass'd by vile and good ; All nurtur'd by the bounteous earth Of rustic, as of royal birth. In vain from savage Mars we're free, The raging Adriatic sea ; Or shun, from south, the noxious breath Of autumn, charg'd with subtle death, To black Cocytus' languid maze, With Danaus' foul detested race, HORACE, B. 2. ODE 16. To Grosphus. The Poet inculcates that happiness is to be main- tained by the control of our affections. Those, Grosphus, without star to guide Caught in th' \u00c6gean, raging wide, When midnight tempests shrowd the sky, \" Ease, ease,\" beseech the powers on high, For ease, the warlike sons of Thrace, For ease, the rapid Parthian prays ; With quiver hung in graceful port, With arrows for defence or sport, For ease, which never can be sold, For costliest purple, silver, gold. No royal purple can remove, Nor consul's lictor stern, reprove, The tumults which the bosom try, Cares which o'er splendi.l ceilings fly. That man's upon a little bless'd Of household saltcellar possess'd, Who smiles upon his frugal board With nature's wholesome comforts stor'd, Who never anxious vigils keeps, And Sisyphus, \u00c6olus' heir, At endless toil we must repair ; Your lands, and house, and charming wife, Must be renounc'd on quitting life ; No nursling-trees will Fate accord, T' attend their transitory lord ; The hateful cypress shall be known, To grace your dismal bier alone ; That C\u00e6cuban your heir shall seize, Now kept secure by patent keys ; With nobler wine the pavement stain, Than feasts pontifical obtain. And free from dreams of grandeur sleeps. Why should we, creatures of a day, Upon ourselves hard burthens lay ? Why from our own to climates run Made fruitful by another sun ? Who that an exile had become, E'er left his consciousness at homo ? Consuming care the deck ascends, The troop of cavalry attends,"], [20, "10 And, nimbler than the fleetest hind, Outstrips the swiftness of the wind. The heart with its own lot content, With no vain schemes will self torment, Life's bitternesses can beguile, Of death's rapacious power the seat, Whose boon 'tis fruitless to entreat. Why thus go on ? th' impartial earth Absorbs the poor as royal birth ; Nor has the guard of hell's domain, Grim ferry-man, pass'd-o'er again Prometheus artful, though untold The ransom, if iu power of gold. He, Tantalus, and all his race, Confines in their appointed place, And grants, with or without their care, From future toil the poor to spare. Can soothe with an ingenuous smile. Nought earthly is entirely bless'd, Death premature Achilles press'd, Tithonus with his hoary crown, Was by protracted age worn down. Time shall perhaps to me extend What it may not your lot commend ; A hundred flocks enrich your ground, Sicilian heifers low around, For you, the mare in harness neighs, Wool African twice dipt arrays. On me bestows unerring fate A little competent estate, A genius for the Grecian Queen, A just contempt for vulgar speen HORACE, B. 2. ODE 19. On Bacchus. \u2014 A Drinking Song. That it was his duty to celebrate the praises of Bacchus, being full of, roused, aud animated by his divinity. Bacchus ! I pledge you 'twas the case, I saw, believe all coming-race, Dictating songs 'midst rocks remote, And the uymphs learning them by rote, Goat- footed satyrs standing round, V\\ ith ears voracious of the sound. Hurrah ! My mind with recent dread Is flutt'ring, half my wits are fled, My soul, replete with Bacchus-guest, Is with tumultuous joy possess'd. HORACE, B. 2. ODE 18. Horace inveighs against the luxury and covetousness of the times. Nor ivory smooth nor gilded arc A figure in my house shall mark, No beams Hymettian rest upon Rare shafts from farthest Airie won ; Nor will I, as if heir, presume T'enseize myself of Att'lus' dome, Dependent ladies ne'er produce Laconian purple for my use, But honour, and a liberal vein Oh ! spare me, Bacchus, spare, I pray, Aside thy dreadful Thyrsus lay ; In Baccbanalian-lays I sing, The wanton Priestess of the King : Wine-bubbling fountains, and the streams That ripple milk, adorn my themes ; Honey from crevices that rills, From trunks of hollow trees distils, As well 'tis granted at my suit, In strains melodious to salute, The honour from your happy spouse, Which to their constellation flows, The seat of Pentheus laid in dust, Perdition of Lycurgus just. Of genius, to my choice remain; That e'en to me the man of s;ore, Makes homage, though I am but poor, The Gods no more 1 importune, Nor of my friend in p.iwer, a boon, Sufficient since my Sabine farm, O'er which contentment spells the charm ; Thus day is driven along by day, Moons waning, quickly pass away, Whilst you give marble to be hewn, One foot where shall your grave be soon ; And, heedless of that last retreat, Are thinking houses to complete, And anxious scheme t' extend the shore Th' abundant rivers you command, Th' obstrep'rous ocean owns your hand, You, moist with wine, on hills select, Lo\\e the dark tresses to collect , Of Thracian priestesses devote, With harmless vipers, in a knot ; You, when the impious band prevail'd, The realms of Jove your father scal'd, With jaw and paws of lion quell'd, And Rcecus from the skies expell'd; Though fitter thought for sport's alarms, Dances and jokes, than feats of arms ; Your energy was then declar'd, Alike for war and peace prepar'd; You, honour'd by the horn of gold. Could Cerberus innocent behold, With joy unusual wag his tail, Nor with his triple- tongue could fail Fondly to lick your legs and feet, As you return'd from death's retreat. Where ocean waves 'gainst Bai\u00e6 roar. Not rich enough restrain'd to land, O'erstep the limits of the strand. Why avaricious should you love Your neighbour's landmark to remove, Trespass beyond the fertile bounds Where settle clients near your grounds ? Behold poor man and wife turn out, Press'd to their aching heart devout Their household gods and babes ill-fed, Uncertain of their future bread. But mark ! no court more surely waits, The pamp'red rich than Pluto's gates,"], [21, "11 \u00bb HORACE, B. 2. ODE 20. Her arduous way through danger takes, Nor aught a difficulty makes, Spurns grovelling crouds in rapid flight, And sordid interest shuts from sight. Horace promises himself everlasting fame. My genius versatile shall rise, On wing sublime, to hail the skies, Nor longer upon earth remain For envious cities to detain, Nor shall the stygian-wave confine, Which pours nine-fold its noxious brine. My birth, whilst envious rivals scorn, Meo\u00e6nas dear, shall fame adorn ; Mine ancles now rough skins invest, I'm in a swan's white plumage dress'd, The soft array enfolds me quite, Quills sheathe my fingers as I write ; A bird melodius now become, Not Icarus so swift could roam ; The murmuring Bosphorus I'll view, O'er Hyperborean plains pursue ; Getulian-wilds shall not repress, Desires my bosom which possess, Dacians and Colchans, who despise The Marcian cohorts, me shall prize, Gelonians, howsoe'er remote, My themes instructive learn to quote ; My works the learned Spaniard con, With him w-ho drinks the waves of Rhone. A recompence most surely reaps The man who faithful silence keeps. I will prohibit him to come Within the precincts of my home, Nor e'er with me shall he prevail, In the same vessel to set sail, Who shall divulge the sacred rites, Mysterious Ceres who requites; For love, when slighted, often links, In fate the vile and worthy sinks, And punishment though lame in foot, The guilty fails not in pursuit. HORACE, B. 8. ODE 3. Horace privately dissuades Aujrustus from trans- ferring the seat of empire to Troy. Not frenzy popular devote, Pernicious measures to promot , Nor tyrant's tlireat'ning look, may shake The man his purpose to forsake, With just and worthy public views, Who the state's welfare sole pursues ; Not the south-wind whose rage controls The sea through th' Adrian gulf that rolls, Nor e'en the mighty hand of Jove, When thund'ring through the realms above. Yea, a crush'd world in fragments dread, Still undismay'd, should strike his head ; Thus Pollux, from the strife severe, Then let no obsequies be sung, Nor lamentations charge your tongue, When my mock funeral seems to wait Th' accustom'd homage through the gate, Suppress your crying, and forbear, The needless rites of sepulture. HORACE, B. 3. ODE 2. Ascended to the heavenly-sphere, And Hercules, from toils reliev'd, The starry-citadels received, Seats, where not yet Augustus sips Rich Nectar with empurpled lips. Thee, Bacchus, there thy merits took, By tygers drawn with irksome yoke, Thus Romulus, upon the steed Of Mars, from Acheron was freed. Horace praises bravery, probity, and '\"fidelity in a secret Let youth robust acquire, my friends, The skill which exercise attends In gallant arms, and learn to bear Privations, hardy warrior's share, With spear adroitly lanc'd to pierce, In rapid chase, the Parthian fierce, And let him lead a life unclos'd From air, to casualties expos'd ; Him, let the virgin and the wife, Of royal warrior, dread in strife ; Surveying from the ramparts far The doubtful issue of the war, Lest spouse and father should provoke, The hon loose to slaughter broke. Here Juno, to the powers above, Gave counsel for them all t' approve. 'Gainst Troy, a lewd and fatal judge, And foreign-fair provok'd a grudge, Denounc'd th' injurious prince and race, Consum'd all the devoted place ; Victims to me, in vengeance just, And chaste Minerva, held in trust. How glorious for our hearth to die ! Death strikes the victim that would fly, Nor spares theknees through fear which smite, Nor the back turn'd in shameful flight. E'er since Laomedon denied The Gods their tribute to divide ; No more the Lac\u00e6n\u0153an queen, Th' adultrous guest, to shine are seen, Nor Priam's perjur'd race in fight, Break the Greek ranks through Hector's Virtue, unconscious aught that's base, Shines spotless with peculiar grace, Nor quits, nor dignity assumes, As public-humour goes and comes ! Virtue, the gates of heaven throws wide, For those through crime that have not died, might ; That war, so long by faction blown, Subsides to peace, for ever gone :"], [22, "12 HORACE, B. 3. ODE 4. Hence, bitterness no longer mine, To Mars, resentment I resign, As well the grandson I detest, His child, Trov's priestess who compress d ; Ev'n him I suffer to pervade The realms where brightness needs no shade, Nectar to drink, Ambrosial wine, Enroll'd with peaceful powers-divine. Long as th' extensive ocean green Rolls Troy and distant Rome between, Hence let th' illustrious exiles rest, In any other country blest ; As long as trampled in the dust By cattle, Paris, Priam's, bust. Long as wild-beasts their young conceal Beyond the keenest eye to steal, The Capitol shall rise in awe, And Rome to vanquish'd Medes give law ; Let her tremendous name go forth E'en to th' extremities of earth, To Calliope. That everything prospers with those that are under the protection of the Powers-Divine. Calliope ! thou queen of song, Descend, to strains divine prolong, Descend from Heaven with pipe divine, Melodious numbers to combine, Or had you rather, clear in voice, On Ph\u0153bus' harp or lute rejoice ? Hear, ye, or doth a pleasing dream, Fond frenzy, to delude me seem ? She comes indeed t' expatiate Along the hallow'd grove sedate, Where grateful riv'lets wind their way, Cool breezes 'mong the thickets play. Me, when a child, from play reliev'd, By sleep, the woodland doves perceiv'd, Doves known to song, with leaves me spread Upon th' Apuliau Vultur's* head ; Beyond Apulia's plenteous bound, A wonder to the dwellers round, 'Yond where inserted seas divide, From Afric, th' European side, Fierce Afric, on whose thirsty shores, The Nile a fruitful deluge pours, Be Rome for brave contempt renown'd Of gold, yet happily, not found, Than forcing forth for man's abuse, Each sacred purpose to seduce ; Whate'cr extremity of land, Rome's fate-winged eagle shall withstand, There let her conquering arms be borne, Alert to visit that sojourn, Where frenzy fiery-heats excite, Or that where storms exhaust their might ; But let all-conquering Rome be told, The destiny which Fates unfold Forbids, that neither through excess, Of piety, restrain'd no less From confidence in state resource, Ye deviate from your proi-p'rous course, Incliu'd the dwellings to restore Built by your Trojan sires of yore ; Or in an inauspicious day Troy's new foundation shall ye lay ; And woe's last visitation prove, Whilst I, the sister-wife of Jove, Lead the victorious bands to WTeak That wrath no mortal tongue can speak. Thrice should a brazen-wall arise, By aid of him who lights the skies. Its founder first, it thrice should all Befoie my fate-charg'd Grecians fall, The captive wife should thrice in vain, Her husband wail, aud children slain. Those lodg'd securely in the nest Of Acherontia's lofty crest, The Bantine woods, Ferenline meads, Whose wealth the peasant's hope exceeds ; What power preserv'd my li'e from harm, Vipers and rav'nous boars to charm; How sacred laurel in m3' sleep, And sprays of myrtle me should heap, Aware not, aid divine must move A child, the object of such love. Yours, O ye muses, yours alone, Whether on Sabine heights my throne, Or cool Pr\u00e6neste, Tybur's slope, Or Bai\u00e6's water are my scope ; Me to your choral sports devote, Cool fountains, and the mountain grot. Nut the brave army put to flight When at Philippi rag'd the fight, Nor yet the execrable tree, Nor pilot in Sicilian sea, Dread Palinurus, have deslroy'd Me, still in life's pursuits employ'd. Whilst you, my guardian-power, shall reign, A sailor on the boist'rous maiu, The raging Bosphorus I'll dare, Nor for the sands of Syria care ; Britons I'll brave, inhuman race, To strangers that allow no place, Concanus, rioting in blood Of horses, his unnat'ral food, Uninjur'd by their shafts, I'll meet Geloni, pass the Tanais fleet. Such themes the jocund lyre ill suit \u2014 Whither, O muse, is thy pursuit ! Cease, thus presumptuous, to relate On what th' immortal powers debate, Nor by your trilling strains debase, Themes too sublime for mortal race.

Augustus to our state shall stand, The guardian-Deity at hand. Since the stern Britons, Parthian's dread, To Rome's dominion bow the head, Doth one of Crassus' men pass life, Base husband, with barbarian-wife ? And hath, O Senate, tame to crimes, We're conscious the dread power who swa^s Th' inactive earth and stormy seas, Throng'd cities, Orcus' drear domains, Alike o'er gods and mortals reigns, And with just-power at once controls The heavens, and all between the poles : The impious Titans how he smote, With bolts, the giant race devote ; Those horrid youth, who, fierce in might, Plac'd Pelion on th' Olympian-height, Amazing, with presumption high, E'en the dread ruler of the sky. But what avail'd Typhceus strong, Mimas, and all their impious throng, Porphyrion, threat'ning from his size, What Rcecus, in that enterprize 1 Enceladus, who, trees uptorn Hurl'd furious in presumptuous scorn ? What all the might which earth could wield, 'Gainst Pallas with impervious shield ! Inverted morals of the times, The Marsian and Apulian hind, Th' Ancilian shield's dismis'd from mind, The Roman-name and habit stor'd, Vesta, unceasingly ador'd, Grown-old in camps of civil-feud, By hostile sires-in-law pursued, Whilst Jupiter-Capitoline, Fond Rome, keep quietude supine ? Yet Regulus, with foresight pure, Would Rome 'gainst such a state assure, When ignominious peace he spurn'd, Distruction's harbinger discern'd, Unless the captive-youth, denied To pity, for their country died. I've seen Rome's standards, he exclaim'd, In Carthagenian temples sham'd, Arms without bloodshed seiz'd as prey, From dastard soldiers snatch'd away. Rome's citizens with arms accurs'd, Behind their free-born backs revers'd, The foe with gates unshut, whose ground, By war dispeopled, harvests crown' d. Shall one whose life a ransom sold Return a braver man through gold ? No ! you to infamy add loss ; For wool prepar'd for colour's gloss Its native whiteness ne'er regains ; So valour that a foil sustains, Scorns to resume that parting breast By cowardice once dispossess'd. If e'er the disentangled mind, From toils thickset, to war's inclin'd, Then valour shall his breast inflame To faithless foes who once was tame, He, in some future war shall tread On Carthagenians, late his dread. The dastard that his elbows found With straining thongs behind him bound, Who knew no means t' escape with life, Save treaty, when in act of strife, Confounding peace with war's alarms \u2014 Scandal ! the Carthagenian arms Triumphant o'er proud Rome's disgrace, The downfal of th' Italian-race. With loyal zeal here Vulcan stood, Juno, with matron-heart as good, With him who never seeks to throw His shoulders off the golden-bow, Of Patara and of Delos God, Who bathes in pure Castalian-flood His hair of Gold; and Lycia's groves, And still his native green -shade loves. Force, conduct void, by its own weight Laid prostrate, needs no stroke from fate : Besides, the Gods direct its course Propitious to well-ord'red force, But power of every kind detest, Whose object impious is confess'd ; And Gyas' doom, with hundred hands, Exemplar of my judgment stands, Orion too, whose passion base, Urg'd the pure goddess ot the chace, Whose virgin-dart fix'd him through time, Dread beacon for the sons of crime. Earth mournsher monsters whom she heaps, By thunder stricken to the deeps, Nor can its raging fire consume \u00c6tna, that shuts the abyss of doom ; Nor will the vulture once relent Tityus' rank-liver to torment, Station'd t' avenge his passion base, Who strove chaste virtue to disgrace, And Pirithous, for flame divine, Three hundred penal-chains confine. Brave Regulus is known t' have spurn'd His wife, who to embrace him yearn'd, And little-ones, like one whose soul, Felt degradation's dire control. His manly-countenance was bound In stern deportment to the ground, Until, by counsel never match'd, The wavering Senate he despatch'd, And, 'midst his weeping friends, in haste, To patriotic-exile pass'd.

By music drive-away, and wine, Each hideous melancholic-sign. From Bion's Pastorals. I mourn Adonis through the groves, Adonis mourn the tender loves, Adonis, on the mountain heath, Divine Adonis, lies in death, Torn, in the whiteness of his thigh, Torn by a tusk, doth slowly die ; For him the lovely Venus grieves, Nor comfort for his loss receives. See down his thigh the sanguine-stream His kindling eyes no longer beam, His glist'ning eyes are wrapt in shades, And from his lips the rose-bloom fades ; The kiss that Venus will not cease, The kiss of love no more shall please, To Venus, grateful still that kiss, Though conscious he no more of bliss. THEOCRITUS, OR, ANACREON HIMSELF, ON THE DEATH OF ADONIS. When Venus' presence brought before Adonis' corpse with hair of gore, The loves she ord'red to the chase, The monster at her feet to place ; They, running with immediate zeal, Through every copse, his doom to seal, Soon caught the hateful boar, and bound, And round and round with cordage wound ; One tugg'd before with labour slow, Another lash'd him with his bow, With trembling steps, and long between He went, for much he fear'd the queen. Alas ! alas ! thy lovely boy, Venus, is dead indeed to joy. When she beheld the grievous wound, Remediless the mischief found, The blood upon his quiv'ring thigh, The blood, that living-ivory dye, Extending wide her snowy arms, She wakes the grove with loud alarms. For me, Adonis, life retain, For me, one moment, death detain, Yield for one kiss that quiv'ring lip, Life's last fond kiss, O let me sip. Venus reproach' d him thus austere \u2014 Vile brute, of brutes the most severe, Hast thou not torn his beauteous thigh ; Hast thou not made my favourite die ? Adonis, long the way thou sliest, To Acheron's drear confines hiest, The bounds that Pluto stern controls, The realm of disembodied souls, And must I yet immortal prove, Unprivileg'd to join my love. The trembling brute with manner mild, The Queen of Beauty thus beguil'd : Venus, by thy bright charms, I swear, Thy lover, and these hunters dear, The least desire I did not prove To gore the husband of thy love ; But as his beauty I beheld, By passion unawares impell'd, O Proserpine, receive my friend, Protection, past my power, extend, Since all on earth, or great, or good, Seeks to thee in a constant flood."], [30, "20 First hung the Pris'ner, then conspir'd The verdict which the law requir'd. O youth belov'd, he dies, he dies, With him love's dream of pleasure flies, My Cestus is with him destroy'd, In hunting, why, dear youth employ'd, O why, in youth's divinest bloom, To chase ferocious beasts presume ? But o'er the water, on a pinch,* The Yankees deal the law of Lynch, Abjuring forms, play hell's delight, A Negro broil t' allay their spite. Thus Venus mourns affectionate, And thus the loves bewail her mate. THE REPUBLIC. Venus, alas ! alas ! indeed Is beautiful Adonis dead ! As many tears doth Venus pour As from his thigh the drops of gore, And these alike receiv'd on earth The loveliest blossoms give to birth ; The crimson-flood produc'd the rose, Anemonies her tears compose. It is not good that many should bear sway. \u2014 Ho met When passions reason's power defeat, And appetite usurps her seat, And vile propensities control The functions of the captive soul; When foul confusion clouds the brain, Of frenzy fierce the wild-domain, Convulsion struggles in each nerve, Nor aught will nature's course observe, The Court of Chancery, (sometimes just,) Conveys the patient into trust The muses for Adonis mourn, For him are all the loves forlorn. No longer, Venus, through the grove, No longer weep your slaught'red love, For him a leafy -couch is spread, A couch for blythe Adonis dead ; Adonis, beautiful in death, As in soft slumber drawn his breath, Though dead, in loveliness the same, Soft purple wraps his polish'd frame ; The weeping loves around him sigh, The weeping loves sob heavily, The tender loves in lorn despair For lost Adonis rend the hair.

Fine was thy taste, the muses mild On thy congenial efforts smil'd : \" Illustrious* men\" were thy delight, The sons of intellectual-might ; And thine impartial purpose drew Their characters to history true. Kind \" Woman,\"! too, 'hy heart confess'd, Alone could render manhood bless'd, Nor e'er could thy long-widow'd love A second bond of union prove. Thy country's welfare, though at heart Thy purpose duteously t' impart, Like others of her children blind, Too oft t' excuse her foes inclin'd. When will th' infatuate race forsake Their parent's adverse-part to take, With patricidal zeal to spurn, Her merits never to discern ? The world such weakness cannot peer, Though, Dyer, was thy heart sincere. Adieu, my friend, though free thy speech, Thy loyalty might none impeach. The sun in heaven's meridian shiu'd, Nor, as an usual-day, declin'd.* No day like that was known before, Nor after hath been any more. Iahuiah to man's voice gave heed, Iahuiah fought for Israel's seed. Proverbs xxiv. v. 30. The field I pass'd of one of sloth, The man to all exertion loth, The vineyard not by him enjoy'd, The man of understanding void, And, lo! with thorns and nettles grown, And broken-down the wall of stone. I gaz'd, and painful though to view, Sincere instruction thence I drew. A little sleep and soft repose, With folding of the arms to dose.

When the Almighty Creator chartered man to the copy- hold of the world, at a quit-rent, not of payment but forbearance, (it not being possible that he that owed his very being to his Benefactor should be able any thing to pay, excepting in dutiful-obe dience,) He used these memorable words, lt Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it!\" \u2014 Subdue that where warfare then could not have taken place ? Subjugation, therefore, must here import conversion and appropriation. Then the material-creation must be converted unto our purpose and appropriated unto our use. Not that we have any reason to suppose that this world was constituted as our \u00e6ternal habitation, even before the ordinance of death ; nor that it is to our present purpose to discuss the postulatum, which, probably, it would be no very difficult matter to esta blish, that animals, in a secondary sense, produce their own sustenance : although it must be obvious that not one material-being can ever take out of the world more than that nothing which it brought in. For organised bodies do not really consume any portion of their apparent sustenance, that which appear ing to be consumed being only temporarily absorbed into their constitution, and is all ultimately returned to the general elements of nature at the animal's decease, or that it is necessary to take into consideration the fact, that new-continents are arising from the bot tom of the sea, which, probably, at no very distant period, will become habitable for mankind, so that we may smile at the fore boding theories of those who dread the over abundant population of the world, for the provision of whose increasing inhabitants the animal-tribes of the land and ocean at least proportionably increase. But let us cast our eyes round, and survey what a large propor tion of this globe lies waste, and in compari son to what it might be rendered capable of producing by human exertion, almost alto gether unproductive ! We will not even suffer eur eyes to dwell upon the vast and fertile empire of India, com paratively thinly peopled to Great-Britain, which is not to be mentioned with it in If we examine the geography of the lati tude of this country, we might ask, why should the coast of Greenland be more en cumbered with ice than that of its antagonist country ? It is from the navigation-charts rather than from ordinary maps that cosmo graphy should be studied ; and here we find the reason at once. The sea on the coast of Norway is unfa thomably deep, so much so, that one of the Fiords or Inlets has been sounded thirty miles inland without its depth having been ascertained. On the contrary, the ocean on the coast of Greenland, like that of most eastward shores, is but shallow ; and thus we find the reason of its being blockaded by ice. Ice is generally found to weigh two-thirds of its capacity of ordinary water, and as the coast of Greenland varies but from three hun dred to six hundred feet in depth, none of the icebergs can be more than three hundred feet above the water. The ice is also locked-in in the winter-season, by Spitzbergen and Iceland, with other rocky-islets, which pre vent the ice drifting towards the equator. It would, therefore, seem that a small amount of combustible-power would prevail to liberate this extensive coast of Greenland from the accumulated winter of seve ral hundred years. At the vernal-season, the blasting of artillery would liberate the greatest portion, and the largest ice berg might probably be dispersed into thou sands of fragments by an ounce of fulmi nating powder. Even the concussion pro duced by a single musket has been expe rienced to shiver a mountain of ice into innumerable fragments, and little doubt can be entertained but by the blasting of artillery, not merely a great portion, but the whole continent of ice would be dislodged. A vast extent of field-ice might be broken-up by a catamaran, as the largest mountain-mass destroyed by an apparently insignificant quantity of detonating or fulminating pow der. capability for the production of human-sus tenance ; yet which, notwithstanding its amazing fertility, through mis-management, and nothing else, is occasionally visited by the penalty of dearth. For experience esta blishes the fact, that mis-management alone can occasion famine in a populous land. The object of this paper is to desire your notice of that extensive country called Greenland, which, ages ago, was a thriving and populous colony, producing a revenue But the recovery of the country of Green land, extensive as it is, would be hut an inferior benefit to the amelioration of our European climate, which would be the certain consequence of the dispersion of the North western ice. The Alps and the Andes are passed without difficulty ; the superior heights of Nepaul are"], [36, "26 the name of Ice-Blink, and sheds its radiance to a vast extent. subdued, to become the habitation of man kind ; and shall human energy be limited by a barrier of ice, when the gunpowder ex pended in the destruction of the Royal George, would probably have restored an entire continent to the civilized-world. The ice is formed in the Northem-nvers, and upon the shallow coast of the Russian empire ; it drifts past the North Cape, and the larger masses take the ground in the shoal-water off Greenland, which country possesses several rivers of open water in the summer-season, while their \u00e6stuaries are blockaded, not by bars of sand, but bridges of ice. A remarkable one of which bears The mighty ocean hath its ban impera tively given, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no farther : And here shall thy proud waves be stayed; But the charter of the human race extends to the subjugation and appropriation of the world entire, and the full powers of that energy which has never yet been taxed unto the extent of its ability, is lawful, yea, even commendable, in its utmost use.
