Since I last spoke of Eleanor she had visited her former governess, and had only now returned. It may be well to relate what has passed in the interim. From the moment that Mr. Softon learned the supposed fact of my Avife's death he pressed his suit Avith Eleanor with redoubled ardour. In this he was well supported by the widow, and the con sequence was that he made a formal declaration. VOL. II. B"], [14, "AVHO AArAS TO BLAME ? 2 Poor Eleanor, agitated between her own thoughts of right and wrong, her mother's pressing advice to accept Mr. Softon, and my secret urgency also, was glad to unbur den herself to her friend, and seek counsel. She was also anxious to gain time \u2014 time to prove if my supposition respecting my Avife's death were correct, time to analyse her own feelings, time to enable her to judge fairly of Mr. Softon. But that gentleman was wise in his generation, and it was no part of his policy to let the grass grow under his feet. Con sequently, before she had completed ar rangements for this proposed visit she was solicited by him. Eleanor had before, in answer to a Avritten declaration of his affection for her, declined to consider the proposal for a lengthened period, and she took advantage of his haste to decline most peremptorily. Pressed for reasons, she declined to give any."], [15, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 3 Mr. Softon was a somewhat melodra matic gentleman : Avithout urging her any more, he made a tremendous demonstra tion to Mrs. Verschoyle, which had the effect of so alarming that weak-minded lady that she was induced to call in her sister-in-law's aid to take counsel what was to be done Avith her rebellious daughter. \"Now consider,\" said the widow; \"what would the girl have? Here is a gentlemanly young man, in a good situa tion under Government, daily raising him self in the social scale, good-looking, with undeniable talent, accomplishments, and most pleasing manners, and with great affection for Eleanor too. My dear Mary, I left Mr. Softon in the drawing-room, in such a state it quite alarmed me. I'm sure I don't know what he'll do if Eleanor continues so obstinate, but something de sperate I am sure.\" \" Bless my soul, sister, don't alarm your- b 2"], [16, "4 WHO AVAS TO BLAME ? self. Something desperate, indeed ! yes, very likely take to wearing a moustache, or smoking, or playing the flute. Desperate indeed ! Oh ! a desperate youth is Mr. Softon.\" \"Whenever I want a little sensible ad vice,\" said the Avidow, \" that is always the way you answer me.\" \"Don't be foolish, then,\" said the spin ster, sharply ; ' ' say what you want with out talking nonsense. Desperate, indeed ! what's he to be desperate about ? Are there not plenty of young women ? If Eleanor refuses Softon he'll marry another woman in six months, unless, indeed, he runs away with some one who is mar ried already. But what do you want with me?\" Mrs. Verschoyle was extremely angry with her unceremonious sister, but, sub duing her wrath, she begged her to use her influence with Eleanor."], [17, "WHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 5 \" My influence ! Bless my soid, youth and beauty will listen to my influence, of course. Youth and beauty has no will of its own, I suppose ? Youth and beauty won't pull one way while Aunt Mary pulls the other?\" \"Well, sister, try what you can do, there's a dear.\" \" Oh, very dear, when a favour is wanted. Cross old thing, spiteful old maid, mischief-making creature, when no thing is to be gained ; but stay, I think I have a clue to the mystery \u2014 I will go and speak to her at once.\" Poor Eleanor, little dreaming of this diplomacy on the widow's part, had shut herself up in her oavu room, and hoped lief worry was ended, at least for the day, when her aunt tapped at the door. She scarcely imagined what was in store for her. Miss Verschoyle entered, and plunged into the subject without delay."], [18, "WHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 6 \" Now, my dear, what about Mr. Softon? You haATe refused him, I hear.\" \" Yes, dear aunt, I haA'e. Would you haA-e me do otherwise ? \" \" Now, don't pump me, girl. I'll give my opinion by-and-bye. Before I give my reasons I wish to know yours.\" ' ' My dear aunt, do you think him worthy ? Have you not frequently ridi culed him ? You have no confidence in him, I am sure.\" \" As much as I have in a girl who runs after married men.\" \" If you make such an accusation as that Avith reference to me, I had rather not speak to you upon the subject, aunt.\" \u00ab \"Who meets married men at midnight, in honeysuckle bowers,\" said the old lady, maliciously. \" I know the circumstance to which you allude,\" said Eleanor, \" and I Avill explain it.\""], [19, "WHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 7 Eleanor then calmly told her aunt the whole state of the case, and concluded by stathig the fact of my wife's death. \" I don't believe a word of it. After this I begin to fancy Mark is as bad as the rest of the men. I fancy that, as likely as not, he has himself had the paragraph in serted. I have noticed many times how eagerly he has sought your society ; but I am ashamed of you for encouraging such conduct.\" \" I have not encouraged it, I assure you,\" said Eleanor. \" Mark himself would be the first to disaATow such behaAdour on my part.\" ' ' Fine doings, indeed ! What will the girls come to now ? But,\" turning sharply upon Eleanor, \" if you have acted properly, why does Mark contrive to come to the house daily ? \" \"If it should prove true,\" said Eleanor, \" can you then see any objection ? \""], [20, "AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 8 \" Common decency might be studied even then,\" said the spinster. \" He might leave you alone till his wife was decently buried.\" \" You are harsh, aunt.\" \"Harsh? no, just. I love Mark better than you, girl, and that is why I detest such conduct as this. He shall never en ter the house again if I can help it. At all eArents, I won't see him.\" Poor Eleanor knew not what to say. She only besought Miss Verschoyle to leave her, and, making all haste, she started from home without exchanging another word with her mother, sister, or aunt, merely leaving a note to explain where she had gone, and betook herself to the house of her old schoolmistress. Troubled now more than ever, Eleanor sought eagerly the unbiassed advice which she could not obtain in her OAvn home. All her doubts respecting me seemed con-"], [21, "AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 9 firmed by her aunt. That I loved her she could not doubt for a moment. That I wished to act honourably she also fully be lieATed, nor could she for an instant sub scribe to the idea which her aunt suggested, that I had misled her respecting the an nouncement of my wife's death. No: if it was false, I equally with herself was de ceived \u2014 of that she felt convinced. All she could say to herself, in summing up the eArents that had passed, was that I loved, and that she could be happy with that love if she dared accept it. If otherwise, what should her conduct be ? The answer which her own heart gave to this question seemed to lighten her sorrow in a moment \u2014 \" She would remain unmarried as long as she lived.\" What answer was given by time and circumstance we have already seen."], [22, "10 CHAPTER II. MR. SOFTON IS FASCINATED. Mrs. Verschoyle by no means willingly received Constance into her house. There was something in her, notAvithstanding all her flourishing manners, which did not please the widow. Much as Mrs. Verschoyle had been annoyed when she made the disco very that my influence was unfavourable to Mr. Softon' s cause, it was with still greater repugnance that she consented to Constance taking up her abode in the house ; yet she was far too weak to say ' ' No.\" It is possible also that the Avidow meditated bringing my wife in contact with me, in the hope of effecting a reconciliation, in which case all"], [23, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 11 difficulty respecting Eleanor would be at an end, and she would become Mrs. Softon Avithout further ceremony. Constance had determined upon fixing herself as a visitor to the window, and was not easily daunted. She had an object to gain, and she would gain it. If the widow had denied her admittance she would have gained access to the house by stratagem \u2014 she would have bribed the servants \u2014 she would have pleaded illness. In fact, Con stance did not lack expedients, and she would have used them. But her object was achieved without any difficulty, and, after having learned that I was in the frequent habit of visiting there, she found it an easy matter to cajole the widow into allowing her to stay. The quiet repose of manner which she assumed at first had completely deceiAred her hostess \u2014 she even consented to aid Constance in her attempts with me. Poor Mrs. Ver-"], [24, "WHO AVAS TO BLAME? 12 schoyle was simple, and without much knowledge of the world. It seemed per haps impossible that this young and beau tiful creature could be really to blame. The fault must have been mine. Why did I allow such a brilliant and fascinating woman to be so much in society ? AVhy did I leave her so much alone \u2014 Avith this beauty and talent rendering her peculiarly liable to temptation ? I had been so much engrossed with my factory; I had given myself up to study ; I had taken her from a congenial sphere, only to mix with rigid strangers who could not appreciate the charming talents of this dainty beauty, whose very appearance made every item in her well-appointed drawing-room look homely and commonplace. \"I shall not in terfere,\" thought the widow. \" Still, I don't know, all things considered, if Mark ought not to relent and take this charming wo man back again. After what has passed"], [25, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 13 he would know how to manage her better than he did before.\" Such was the widow's simple idea for making all smooth again. Meanwhile, Constance would not give her time for thought, and she took her place at the widow's side on the sofa with such an air of engaging familiarity that a stranger might have supposed they had been inti mate for life. \"You cannot think, my dear madam, how grateful I feel for permitting me this chance of seeing my dear husband again,\" said Constance, naively. \" KnoAving him so long\u2014 indeed, having had the satis faction of rearing him from his infancy \u2014 your interest in all that concerns him must necessarily be so much greater than a stranger's, and this will be my best ex cuse for troubling you.\" The Avidow could hardly gainsay what seemed so very natural, and therefore easily"], [26, "14 AVHO WAS TO BLAME? fell into the net which had been spread for her. \" You are right,\" said she complacently; \"I do feel a great interest in your excellent husband ; doubtless he owes much of his success to my care of him in his early years ; and if his manners are more abrupt than I could wish for in polite society, I suppose we must ascribe it to the influence of the manufacturing people he has so much associated with ; but of course,\" con tinued she, \"you will not expect me to take either side. Should Mark come here to-day, I would rather not be present at the intei-Adew.\" \"Ah, my dear lady,\" said Constance, with the most childlike humdity, \"do not think I come here to accuse him ; by no means \u2014 he is too good, too noble. The sole blame is mine. Oh, why could I not be contented with Ids humble and mono tonous life? I see, now it is too late,"], [27, "AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? 15 where my error has been. What happiness I might have had, even in poverty ! \" \"As to poverty,\" said the widow, \" I think you hardly do Mark justice. His posi tion could not have been bad when you mar ried him, and has greatly improved since.\" \" True, my dear madam, quite right ; but he took me from a home where every luxury was familiar to me.\" The widow had not thought of this ; she had always understood that I had never received a farthing with my wife, but, without being certain of the facts, she thought it better not to argue. \"Have you consulted your parents?\" said the widow. \" Madam, I have not. Ah, my dear parents, how they must have grieved! I can imagine what your dear kind heart would feel if it had happened thus to one of your daughters. By-the-bye, you have two daughters, have you not ?\""], [28, "16 WHO WAS TO BLAME ? \"Yes, madam, my daughter Clara is in the garden. Eleanor has gone for a short visit to a friend, but she returns home again this morning.\" \" How happy it will make me to know them!\" While they chatted thus Mr. Softon was announced. \" Do not move,\" said the widow, seeing that Constance was about to withdraw ; \" Mr. Softon is only \" \" Oh ! I comprehend, madam,\" said Constance, with a roguish smile, which became her well. \" And which of the dear girls does this gentleman affect to choose ?\" \"It is my eldest daughter, Eleanor, to whom Mr. Softon \" \" Is engaged : dear, how interesting ! \" \"H'm, not exactly: my daughter has not positively accepted Mr. Softon, but it will lead to that of course ; oh, yes, it will lead to that.\""], [29, "WHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 17 \" I am dying to see the favoured one,\" said Constance. She was soon gratified, for Mr. Softon immediately entered. He was a little abashed by the presence of such a magnificent creature as Con stance, and did not assume quite so many airs as he would haAre done had she been of a quieter order of beauty. Constance, however, soon put him at his ease. She showed him so much attention, paid him so much respect, was so much interested in some extremely sapient remarks he made concerning the weather, or the garden, or a new fashion, or some such topic, and she laughed so sweetly when he attempted a joke which hung fire, that in ten minutes he appeared to think her one of the most delightful women whose acquaintance he had ever made. The widow being somewhat confused between her visitors, had not introduced them ; and Constance, also, had so imme- VOL.

But I am mistaken, of course.\" \" I know what you would say,\" answered the widow ; \" pray be careful.\" \" But do I really have the honour ot addressing the Avife of my dear friend Mark ?\" \" Even so,\" said the Avidow, who enjoyed his astonishment. \" And this is the exquisite creature,\" said he in a low tone, but purposely loud enough for her to hear, \"whom he is driving away from him. The barbarian ! \" Then he added, aloud \u2014 \"I must conclude, then, my dear Mrs. Verschoyle, that it was a joke that I heard about Mrs. Irving's decease ?\" \"Hush! you naughty man,\" said she ;"], [31, "AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? 19 \" how can you speak of such horrible things as death ?\" \" Truly, it is better to think of the living,\" said Mr. Softon, \" especially when one has the happiness of contem plating them as I do to-day.\" ' ' Have a care, Mr. Softon ; I shall con vey all these fine speeches to Eleanor \" \"Oh, pray now,\" and he joined his hands together in mock supplication, \" I hoped to find her back again by this time.\" \" She may not come till the next train,\" answered she ; \" can you amuse yourself agreeably till then ?\" \"Do you ask?\" said Mr. Softon, gal lantly ; \"I am sorry to say I have an en gagement which will occupy me the next hour or so, after which I will return.\" Mrs. Verschoyle followed him to the door; she scarcely knew what to make of his sudden fascination. c 2"], [32, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 20 \" And this is really Mrs. Irving?\" said he in a whisper, as they left the room. \" Yes ; do you like her ?\" \" She is an angel.\" \" Pity Mark does not think so.\" \" The fellow must be a brute.\" \" Hush ! you do not know all. I cannot tell who is to blame.\" ' ' This charming creature is not ; of that I'm certain.\" \" You appear fascinated.\" \" Really, my dear madam, you must admit she is very charming.\" \" She certainly is ; I wish I could feel that she had the sterling merits of my dear girls.\" \" Remember how much they owe to you, my dear madam.\" \"Ah! the care and anxiety I have had over those dear girls,\" said the widow, musingly. \" Pray invite your talented friend in the"], [33, "WHO WAS TO BLAME? 21 evening,\" said Constance, when the widow returned, \" and we will give you a little music. I think I understood he was a musician.\" \"Delightful!\" said the widow; \"I will do so. Mr. Softon is full of soul, I assure you, he should have been an artist.\" \" He is much better as he is, believe me,\" said Constance. \"You an artist, and speak thus!\" re marked the widow. \" Madam, I have seen too much of artists ; you do not know them. You would hardly imagine what a loose tone of thought pervades the artistic world \u2014 shocking ! \" \" We have also an artist, named Cary,\" said the widow; \"a very accomplished man, who teaches Eleanor, and whose knowledge of music is profound.\" \"Ah, indeed,\" remarked Constance;"], [34, "22 AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? \" but do you not find these artists a little \u2014 what shall I say? \u2014 tiresome?\" \" Mr. Cary is very intellectual,\" said the widoAv; \"an excellent man for his position, I should say.\" \" True, my dear madam; but the habits of these people. I have met many of them. They always smell of tobacco ; they are so chary of brushes and combs ; they haAre generally such deep bass voices, and speak so loud they make one's ears tingle in a drawing-room . ' ' So Cary was not inAdted ; the fact being that Constance remembered too well the influence of Cary in the early part of her married life to suppose that he would treat her with much deference now. So Mr. Softon had the full and exclusive benefit of my Avife's society. \" This Mr. Softon is a gentleman, I sup pose ?\" said Constance. \" Oh, quite so,\" answered the widow."], [35, "AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 23 \"And rich?\" \" Not rich, perhaps ; but certainly well off.\" \" He has been long engaged to Miss Eleanor \" \" Pardon me,\" said the widow, \" I think you have forgotten that they are not actu ally engaged yet.\" \" How foolishly forgetful I am : of course, you told me so.\" The widow sighed. \" He is so amiable and talented,\" she said, \" I am not surprised that any lady should admire him.\" \" He must be quite young,\" said Con stance, who seemed suddenly anxious to know all about Mr. Softon. \" Oh, quite young, \"answered the Avidow, \"he is not yet thirty.\" The gentleman respecting whom these particulars had been communicated again made his appearance."], [36, "24 WHO AATAS TO BLAME ? His entrance was signalled by Con stance with a sort of triumphal march upon the piano, played with so much spirit that the young man was astonished. But as he came into the room, perhaps because Constance recollected that this was not the kind of music to express her OAvn situation and supposed feelings, she struck into one of Mendelssohn's most plaintive songs without words, and put on such an expression of countenance as would best accord with the sentiment of the music. \" What an impassioned creature!\" said Mr. Softon \u2014 \"how spirituelle I '\" Hardly noticing at first that Mr. Softon was present, she played from memory a dashing study of Lizst. \"Really, a most extraordinary crea ture ! \" said Mr. Softon again. Eleanor had just returned from her short visit, and now entered the room so"], [37, "AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? 25 quietly that she had hardly been noticed. Mr. Softon, feeling that he was bound to say something in common politeness, came to her and made some enthusiastic remarks upon the playing. Perceiving Eleanor, Constance rose from the piano, Avith the warmest professions of attachment and admiration, and said \u2014 \" You must be an excellent amateur, I am sure, with that expressive face of yours. I am confident you have excellent taste and skill. Do play something, dear.\" There was that in the manner and ex- pression of Constance which repelled Eleanor from the first moment; every word she uttered seemed in her mind an apology for me, and she was almost openly impelled to adopt a defiant tone. Restrain ing herself, she sat doAvn at the piano, and played a short piece, by no means difficult, in a very incorrect manner, for her thoughts were elsewhere."], [38, "26 AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? Constance was in a rapture when she had finished. \u2014 \"What expression! \u2014 what exquisite simplicity ! \u2014 what tone ! \" Softon, though a simpleton, had still a certain amount of honesty, and he could not help saying \u2014 \" I fancy, madam, you have not heard Miss Eleanor to the best advantage.\" Miss Mary now joined them. She had seen little of my wife; but it will be re membered that her first impression had not been extremely favourable, and the parting warning which she had given me when paying me a short visit, after my marriage, again recurred to her. \"I have been a true prophet,\" mur niured Aunt Mary. \"What business has she here? My sister-in-law is a fool to encourage her.\" Constance, too, remembered Miss Ver schoyle's visit, but did not refer to it. She had a strong temptation to ridicule the old"], [39, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 27 lady's odd ways, but prudence conquered. There Avould be nothing to gain \u2014 there might be something to lose. From one cause and another the interest of the group flagged. Mr. Softon from time to time made a spasmodic effort to infuse a little liveliness amongst them, but he wanted assistance ; the work was too heavy alone. They separated early. As they left the drawing-room Aunt Mary called Eleanor into her room. \" Take a seat, my dear ; I haATe been too sharp Avith you I know.\" Eleanor could say nothing ; she wept. \"It is of no use to be miserable,\" continued the spinster. \" You can't have a married man, my dear. Think of that ! \u2014 Be reasonable. It is a sin to think of \" \"Aunt, dear aunt,\" said Eleanor, \"do me justice. At the present moment I feel more deeply the bitter trial it must be for"], [40, "28 WHO WAS TO BLAME ? Mark, tied for life to such a woman as this, than any sorrow for my OAvn share in the matter.\" \" Good girl,\" said Aunt Mary, \" I don't know why I attacked you as I did. I was afraid. I know what a difference there is between a man (and Mark is that) who is capable of loving passionately (and Mark is so) and that popinjay yonder ; but mind my words, Eleanor, you will be spared any further trouble in refusing Mr. Softon. He will never ask you again.\" \"Why do you think so, aunt?\" said Eleanor, almost joyfully. \" I can see,\" answered Miss Mary. \" I know what I know.

All that has nothing to do with the present question ; but I had rather rear kittens and puppies than foolish and dishonourable men and women, and call them my children. There are too many of such already.\" \"Do not be uneasy about me, aunt; duty is my first consideration. I shall be able to OA'ercome any foolish fancies I may have had. Good night.

Eleanor glanced round the room and pictured in imagination fifty years of her life passed away. Would she resemble her aunt ? she asked herself with a snide, glancing at the same time to the purring cat, the scratching parrot, the wheezy poodle, and, lastly, to the quiet figure of Miss Verschoyle herself, who, as usual when cogitating deeply, had pushed her cap nearly to the back of her head, reveal ing a most masculine forehead and stubby grey hair. \" Why not?\" was Eleanor's inward an swer ; \" she is a good and honourable woman.\" Still it must be confessed youth and beauty is not generally given to thinking thus."], [43, "31 CHAPTER III. MR. SOFTON'S FASCINATION CONTINUES. Constance still stayed Avith the widow ; but certainly, as far as I was concerned, her object had failed. But my absence was compensated for in the frequent visits of Mr. Softon, who now almost entirely neglected his official duties to be constantly at Lymington. He seemed to forget Eleanor entirely, much to the astonish ment of the widow, who saw Mr. Softon's attentions to Constance increasing daily. Constance fell into all his moods ; she was equal to the subject, be it what it would \u2014 music, philosophy, art, scandal \u2014 no matter what, she followed him. A man"], [44, "32 AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? of a different stamp would soon have tired of a woman who had no opinion of her OAvn. This, however, did not trouble Mr. Softon in the least. They discussed all sorts of subjects, from the last new novel to the last new preacher or the last new creed (there is a fashion now even in such matters as these). Sometimes the topics they touched upon were not of the most elevated kind. Constance, however, ap peared so calm, judicious, and modest, and never allowed her companion to stray into forbidden paths. \"It is astonishing how accomplished and refined she is,\" Mr. Softon remarked. \" I seem as thoroughly acquainted with her character in these few days as though I had knoAvn her all my life ; and how charm ingly easy and graceful she is ! Egad, I wish I was in Mark's shoes \u2014 she would be just the woman for me.\" But the Avidow was getting rapidly tired"], [45, "WHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 33 of her visitor and of Mr. Softon's atten tions to her. Her placid nature gave way under the infliction, so that upon one occasion when he was descanting, as he often did, on my folly and cruelty in respect to my wife, the widoAV for the first time seemed inclined to take my part. \"It is impossible, Mr. Softon, to say who was to blame,\" she said, coldly; \"I would rather, if you please, not express an opinion on such a delicate matter.\" She also took every opportunity of en ticing Constance away from Mr. Softon, hoping that the affection which she be lieved he had felt for Eleanor would still lead to a declaration. She began also to think whether she might not as well try once more her influence with me, and accordingly told my wife of her intention. \" What a dear kind soul you are!\" said Constance. \"How I love you! If you had but the same admiration for me that I VOL. II.

Mark will never see me again if he can help it.\" \"You must not despair,\" said the widow, who herself began to despair of getting rid of her visitor. \" Oh, it is past \u2014 quite past. I can never bear the humiliation of asking a favour from him again.\" \"Am I to understand, then,\" said the widow, \" that you refuse my interces sion?\" ' ' Refuse your intercession ! Benevolent creature, can I use such a word ? I could not think of putting you to so much trouble, which I know would be of no avail.\" \" But that is the sole object of your stay here, is it not ?\" asked the Avidow, aghast at her visitor's coolness, and rendered still more uncomfortable as the faint light"], [47, "AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 35 daAvned upon her that my wife had an ul terior object. Constance had quickness enough to see that her welcome was exhausted. \" It was the sole motive of my stay, dear madam, and since it has failed I will take my leave of your charming society. In fact, I have arranged to leave to morrow.\" The widow Avas becoming enlightened gradually; she did not press her visitor to stay. The consequence was, therefore, that Constance, to the infinite delight of Miss Mary, the satisfaction of Eleanor, and the grief of Mr. Softon, took her departure. Mr. Softon, however, could not part with her thus abruptly. He saw her to the train, and made most earnest and particular in quiries as to her future prospects, residence, and occupation \u2014 details Avhich Constance gave with little reserve. Mr. Softon's head was turned, without d 2"], [48, "36 WHO WAS TO BLAME ? doubt. There was a dash of impropriety too in the affair which, to a foolish young man such as he was, had a certain charm. There was something more piquant in these little attentions to another man's Avife, even when cast off with disdain by an injured husband, which gratified his conceit amaz ingly. It is hardly to be expressed how, to his official companions, he boasted of the con quest he had made of such an exquisite creature \u2014 \"such a soul, you know,\" said he \u2014 \" such eyes \u2014 such a complexion \u2014 such \u2014 hair \u2014 such a figui-e \u2014 such a smile.

I went back to the factory, shutting behind me, as it were, all that had so en chanted me. The opening to a new life which had promised so much had suddenly closed.

Our happiness in this world passes before us in fleeting glimpses which come to us like angels whom we entertain un awares, but flee from us like phantoms when we attempt to embrace them; so that it is not easy for even the gayest one of us to sit doAvn to analyse his happiness. It will most probably disappear altogether in the process. Look out of your well-appointed drawing-room into the street, take the first person you see, try to imagine his life, or ask him to change positions with you. He may be the old crossing-sweeper, who has stood there for the last twenty years, day by day, in all weathers, and never could command a decent hat or coat all his life. Yet a photograph of your two faces might induce the stranger to say, as he looked at them, that is the happier man! O'Hara soon discovered that I was ill at ease. He attributed it to regret for my AA'ife's conduct, but his suggestion for my"], [51, "AATIO AA^AS TO BLAME ? 39 relief amused me. He proposed medical adAdce. \" Good Heaven, O'Hara!\" said I; pills and potions for past illusions. If drugs could bring them back the doctors would have a thriving trade. Life seems to be a game of chance where a prize falls to the most indifferent. The more we seek the further we are from the object we desire. I determined to try by labour and study to banish the grief that oppressed me. It was my only course. I was not one of those who could sit down quietly under a disappointment, and wait till time wore away my grief. WhateATer came of it, I must be actively fighting with the enemy, and taking my chance of victory or defeat. After some days I received a letter from Aunt Mary, informing me that my wife had left them. She made no comment, but she reproached herself somewhat with"], [52, "40 AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? want of confidence in her dear boy. She told me also, AAliat was not unpleasingnews, that, notwithstanding all that had passed, I should not be an unwelcome Adsitor there, and that the Avidow had become so annoyed Avith Constance that she quite absolved me from the blame which she had at first attri buted to me. Toward my wife the old lady had conceived a deep-rooted hatred. Her showy figure, dressed in a style which made her as seducing as possible ; her white teeth, which she showed every time she smiled ; her dark eyes, which were thrown in languishing glances upon those AAdiose interest she courted, or mockingly fierce upon those who could not be tempted Avithin her charmed circle ; her insinuating language, eArery word of which was as a dart pointed with a given aim, and rarely missing its mark ; her cool indifference to the restraints of society \u2014 all these things had irritated Miss Verschoyle to the last"], [53, "AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 41 pitch of human endurance, and she Avrote as though she longed to see her old favourite again, that she might express her sympathy. I was not slow in availing myself of the temptation held out to me, and again I found myself at Lymington. I had never met Avith so warm a reception from Miss Verschoyle. All the old lady's tenderest recollections of the lonely orphan she had reared to manhood came floating back to her, and she Avas deeply moved. \"Sit down, my dear boy; you must come here as before, but forget what has taken place if you can. I see it all. You made a mistake, my dear boy \u2014 a mistake. You could never be happy again with her \u2014 of course not. It was useless attempting to make terms Avith her. It would only lead to fresh unhappiness. But \" (and here Miss Verschoyle laid her hand solemnly on my head) \"we must have no"], [54, "42 WHO AATAS TO BLAME ? confidential talk to Eleanor if you come here.\" I was silent, more perhaps from deep feeling than because I refused to comply with her conditions. ' ' You must try to overcome this ; but I haA'O more to say to you \u2014 your wife has captivated Mr. Softon.\" \" What next ?\" said I passionately. \" There now, don't be furious. I thought you were indifferent about her.\" \" But not about my own honour.\" \"\" Pooh ! \u2014 perhaps one day the law may aid you.\" \"Be assured,\" said I, \"that I shall never seek its aid. Had death broken this bond which is so fatal to my happiness I would have accepted my freedom Avith joy; but through the keen Avit of a lawyer \u2014 never.

You care for her still.\" \" I haATe no solitary thought or feeling which speaks to my heart of any sympathy for her as my wife,\" I said, \" but I cannot look upon her degradation as a woman unmoved.

Honour, purity, nobleness of spirit, truth, or benevolence, are all idle words to her. She may make use of such words as many others do to whom they are but the skele tons of language, haAdng no soul in them.\" Miss Verschoyle rang the bell. \" Ask Eleanor to find my spectacles,\" said she, when the servant came. \"Now, my dear,\" continued she, \"I shall see how you behave,\" as Eleanor en tered the room. \"I cannot find your spectacles, aunt,\" said Eleanor. \"No, I dare say not; I have them here.\" \" Did you require anything else, aunt?' \" No, dear, that is all ; but see, here is a friend come again \u2014 and another,\" con tinued she, as the opening door revealed Miss Perky. \" Say at once, my dear, if you don't"], [57, "WHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 45 want me,\" remarked that lady, \"and I wont take my bonnet off.\" \"I should do so, you may rely upon it,\" answered Miss Mary, in perfect good faith and good temper ; ' ' but you are quite welcome. Come with me into the drawing room.\" \" The drawing-room !\" echoed Miss Perky, Avith surprise \u2014 the truth being that she was not often tolerated there. Eleanor, hardly comprehending her aunt's motive, was timid and constrained when we were left alone. \" We are friends, are we not ?\" I asked. \"Yes; suffering has made us so, if nothing else, though the suffering may be only on my part.\" Eleanor looked at me calmly for a moment.

DEEPER STILL. I called again before leaving Lyming ton. The Avidow expressed much sym pathy, and regretted extremely that I could not find it in my heart to be recon ciled to Constance, and said \u2014 \" I hope, Mr. Irving, you do not censure me in the matter.\" \" I have no reason to do so,\" I replied. \"I could not do otherwise than receiAre her, you see.\" There were two opinions upon that point, I thought, but it was useless to discuss the question. \" I was anxious to do my best,\" con- E 2"], [64, "52 AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? tinued the widow, \" and I hoped something would come of it.

Her behaviour has been certainly bad. You intend to provide for her suitably, and it is very noble of you. When she came to me, and fell at my"], [65, "AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? 53 feet in tears, I assured her that you would not neglect her.\" I wondered very much what the AvidoAv was driving at in all this. An explanation soon came, however, for she continued \u2014 ' ' But are you still obdurate ? Do you not feel, even iioav, that you could be reconciled ?\" I was getting angry, but I repressed my feelings. The Avidow had evidently been preparing a scene of some kind. Of that I felt assured by her manner, and Avas not long kept in doubt, for, throAving open the folding-doors of the drawing-room, she called to Constance, ' ' Come, dear ; he surely cannot remain cold-hearted any longer.\" To my astonishment, in came my wife, calm, cold, tranquil, beautiful, deceptive as ever \u2014 unmoved. \"There, take her! be happy! forget the past !\" said the widow, in such a tone"], [66, "54 AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? as she might have used had the scene formed the concluding act of a drawing room comedy. I put forth my hand. Savage as I was, I could hardly restrain my laughter at the absurd burlesque of the widow, who handed her charge to me as though she had been a bale of goods to be transferred from one owner to another. \" Tell me, Constance,\" I said, \" and be honest, if you can, for once, what do you Avant Avith me ? That you repent of your past conduct I do not for a moment be lieve. There is nothing in your manner or behaviour to induce such a thought ; but that you have a latent object in lending yourself to all this I am equally certain. Speak out at once, and let this contemp tible farce come to an end.\" \" I would ask your forgiveness merely,\" said she. \" I do forgive you,\" said I, exultingly."], [67, "AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? 55 \" What I have learned through the sorroAV you have caused me will perhaps recom pense me some day or other.\" \" Oh, he will come round,\" said the widow, softly ; he is very kind-hearted, I'm sure.

It is de lightful to see him so benevolent.\" \" Listen,\" I said to Constance. \" There shall be no temptation to repeat your former acts.\" \" Oh, this is heavenly !\" said the widow, acting as the chorus in this ridiculous drama. \"How pleasant it is to feel the nobleness of human nature thus ! Speak to him, dear; prove to him that you are worthy of his goodness.\" But Constance was silent. She had not been my Avife for two years without learn ing some points of my character ; she saw in my fixed glance, flashing eyes, and quivering nostrils that I should speak"], [68, "56 AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? words of bitter import if I spoke at all, and she was not mistaken. \" I have said, Constance, that you shall be placed beyond the reach of temptation, if such be your desire.

I Avill in all points, and at all times, recog nise you as my wife \" \" Fly to his arms, dear,\" said the widow. \" Can anything be more affecting ?\" And she wept. \" But,\" continued I, unheeding this in terruption, \"I will promise this only on one condition \" \"Consent, dear; agree to it at once,\" said the Avidow. \" On the condition,\" I said, \"that from the moment she enters the house we speak to each other no more.\""], [69, "AVHO AArAS TO BLAME ? 57 The widow whispered to Constance \u2014 \" Take him at his word, my dear.

There is an end of the matter.\" \" But you will go Avith him ?\" said the widow ; ' ' you will surely not refuse his magnanimous proposal ? \" \" I do refuse, madam.\" \" Now we understand each other,\" said I, and left the room, determined not to prolong this wretched scene. I had not seen Eleanor ; I did not even knoAV if she was in the house.

I promise that solemnly.\" While we spoke Constance came near to us, and at the same moment a fly drove up to the door, and the servant brought some luggage into the hall. Constance affected not to notice me at all. To Eleanor she was extremely complacent. \" I am going, my sweet girl,\" she said. ' ' I need hardly say how I shall grieve to lose your charming society.\" Eleanor replied coldly to this, and went into the house, while I wandered mecha nically down the garden path.

Before I could speculate upon this the voice of my wife greeted me again. It had not a shade of feeling \u2014 not an inflection which could im part the idea that any remorse or regret influenced her. If any effort could be detected it was in a certain attempt to make her words fall upon my ear like a fate from which I could not escape.

There was no vehicle at hand in which to follow her. I, however, determined to ascertain, if possible, her destination.

The frequency, too, of divorce cases is a sad disgrace to our social condition : their possibility a deep dishonour to our laws. That a man should be able to make a money question of his wife's inconstancy indicates but a base estimate, by the law, of conjugal relations. That the wife should be not only unable to prosecute an equi valent claim against the inconstant hus band, but utterly without opportunity to defend herself from the fatal imputation on which the husband's claim is based \u2014 helpless and dumb in the hands of her sworn helpmate and of her alleged para mour, as any horse or sheep whose sound ness may be in question between buyer and seller \u2014 is a wrong of incalculable enormity. It is no merely speculative objection to say that such a state of the"], [76, "64 WHO WAS TO BLAME ? law affords to the woman a motive to sin, and opens to her husband a means of collusion. It has been denounced on these grounds by every legal dignitary in the Senate. It has been declared by one of the highest authorities that an action for damages against the destroyer of a husband's peace is a scandal to the country \u2014 \"a stigma on the law of England\" \u2014 \"an action which shocked one's sense of right.\" Lord Brougham declares that in such actions the character of a woman is not unfrequently sworn away : \" instances were known in which, by collusion between the husband and a pretended paramour, the character of the wife had been destroyed :\" and he mentions a case where a lady was excluded from the court, and behind her back, by the principles of our jurisprudence, her character was blackened in every possible way."], [77, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 65 It is impossible to witness one of those disgusting exhibitions in which hired advo vates exhaust their licence of innuendo, invective, and simulated pathos, to in crease or diminish the money value of \"out raged honour,\" \u2014 in which witnesses are required to depose with indecent minute ness to circumstances of which they could hardly be cognisant without a prior breach of delicacy, if not of duty, \u2014 in which the audience are excited, as at a French play, between the prurient revelations of cham bermaids and of police spies, \u2014 it is impos sible to hear or read all this without observing that the party alone fatally con cerned is the only party unrepresented, and without suspecting, in many cases, that she is the victim of conspiracy as well as the object of lust. Even while I write this melancholy history there are a num ber of cases in the daily papers which make me blush for the opinion entertained by VOL. II. F"], [78, "66 WHO WAS TO BLAME ? foreigners of the morality of this favoured land. It has been said that our marriage law presses more heavily upon women than upon men, in all classes, because the former are the weaker; but, in truth, the inequality is not less unjust towards the latter \u2014 excepting that favoured fraction of the sex which has the ear of ecclesiastical courts and learned lords. In the first place, we must confess to a reservation in favour of husbands as to the relative guilt of inconstancy in the two sexes. If, as all moralists admit, culpability is to be mea sured by temptation, the offending husband is unquestionably less guilty than the un faithful wife ; for he has not that panoply of defence which is woman's beauty as well as her strength \u2014 an armour of con quest as well as of resistance. Neither are the consequences of his sin so immediately and fatally mischievous ; forgiveness"], [79, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 67 is with him impossible, \u2014 to her it is natural and graceful. Whatever the sub lime severity of divine law may exact, in a state of social imperfection allowance must always be made for the inequality of circumstances. While, therefore, we would arm the wife with ample power to deliver herself from an unfaithful husband, we neither expect nor desire its invariable exercise. It is her unquestionable right, but did she always exercise it terrible would be the dissolution of ties that might be re-knit more firmly than ever by forbearance. Our fear is that she would too often and too long forbear. Such a patient forgiving Griselda is woman that, in nine cases out of ten, she would wash out with her tears the bruise which, bared to the eyes of law, would effectually plead for her future protection. In the next place, we would have it remembered that the law which makes over to the husband f 2"], [80, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 68 all the wife's means, makes over to him also all her debts; and that, although, among the \"upper ten thousand,\" where ladies are never penniless, creditors may be referred to the lady's banker, the world in general has some trouble to avoid the responsibility of obligations incurred by extravagant or absentee wives. But enough of this speculation upon a theme which has endless varieties ac- cording to the position and the tempera ment of the sufferers. For me the vision of a life had departed, and the latent hope by which I expected to amend the folly of the past \u2014 that also had vanished en tirely. After all, could I absolve myself from blame ? If I sought the conquest of a heart to blend with my own, had I ful filled the conditions necessary for such an achievement ? The only sovereignty is when the will is subdued to our own. A vague theory which is shaken to pieces by"], [81, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 69 the first wind of opposition cannot be held in high estimation. I had but obtained a feeble power which embraced nothing fairly. We live in a hurry \u2014 in fact we scarcely live at all, so occupied are we with infinitesimal things while the real broad deep enj 03111 ents of life escape us. We say we have no time to associate our wives with our daily toils, struggles, and anxieties ; we leave them to idleness, to flippant chatter, which tickles the fancy for a time, but deadens the heart to higher feelings ; to empty sermons, which, as they are known to be addressed chiefly to giddy ears, are prepared with a total absence of common sense or homely truths to touch the heart or awaken reflection. Are the books or the companions we provide for them higher in quality? Then, as time runs on, we find their society wearisome ; they have no interest in the objects of our pursuit. Instead of the women we might"], [82, "70 WHO WAS TO BLAME? have made, we have frivolous incon siderate human being, with whom we cease to interchange our higher thoughts, and the question recurs to us bitterly \u2014 Who was to blame ? With this view of things in my mind, I gradually, notwithstanding my wife's faults, came to the conclusion that I had not done all that might have been done to rescue her. I felt then, and I now feel, that the husband must admit the wife to a more intimate participation in his own mental development. He must encourage her when she is disheartened ; he must raise her to his own level. When we remember the facilities men have for their moral and intellectual ad- vancement, it must be confessed that they are not blameless if they make no attempt to elevate the companions they have chosen for life. The consequences of this short-coming are clearly seen ; man seeks"], [83, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 71 his happiness in one path, woman in an other, their interests are divided, and the longer they dwell with each other the wider their souls have travelled apart. Divorce, good heaven ! what more perfect divorce is there than that in which the mind is subject to any influence whatever that has not its place beside the domestic hearth ? The spirit of home must be ele vated. New phases of intellectual life make their demand upon the mind and heart of man. What is required is that the inner life of home should not fall so far short of the ideal that is rising in the active mind without, as to be tolerated and endured merely as a refuge from the weariness of daily toil or enervating study. I have been to blame ! My home has been too freely exposed to external influences. My wife has been left too much alone, and without occupation, and vice is her refuge at last from solitude and ennui."], [84, "72 CHAPTER VII. I FOLLOW MY WIFE. The reflections I have indulged in re specting the cause of the estrangement between me and Constance had induced me perhaps to take a more lenient view of her conduct than she deserved. One thing I had resolved upon in the few moments that passed after leaving the railway sta tion, which was, to follow them to their retreat, and, if possible, induce Constance to leave Mr. Softon and endeavour to lead a new life. I fancy even in this I was not acting entirely from my own impulses. Mingled with every thought, every, action of mine at that moment, there was the"], [85, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 73 thought of how Eleanor would interpret it, and it Avas almost with a feeling of pride that I imagined she would smile approvingly when she knew how great a sacrifice I had made. My enterprise in business had not been unrewarded, but the keen sense of enjoy ment with which the happy man pursues an object had passed away. I determined to discharge my hands and sell off the machinery at once, and deATote myself, for a time at least, to the task of reclaim ing my lost wife. In these operations O'Hara assisted me with such good effect that in a short time I was relieved from all my business cares, and, with a handsome income, had the world before me where to choose. I had employed a confidential agent to follow up the guilty pair, and he had performed his duty well. From him I now learned that Italy was the ulti-"], [86, "74 AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? mate destination of my wife and Mr. Softon. It may seem strange that I had not at once followed them, if I desired to exert my influence, but this I felt to be hopeless. I knew that a certain time must elapse before any entreaties of mine would avail in the least. But when she found out how worthless and shallow was the character of her paramour \u2014 when she discovered as I imagined that his sole object was to live easily upon her talent I thought she must inevitably become dis gusted. Besides, it appeared to me also that the fact of my follomng her, and making earnest endeavours to reclaim her, might have more weight at a later period than at first. A dreary painful disen chantment was probably before her, and the poisonous influence of a mind like that of Softon must have time to be neutralized by his own conduct before"], [87, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 75 any effort of mine seemed at all likely to be beneficial. To my amazement, when my business affairs were settled O'Hara became strongly infected with the desire to travel. It was in vain I represented the view his wife would most likely have upon the sub ject, or the little advantage his society would be to me in any capacity. \" Shure, master, I'm wishing to see the world, and if ye won't take mo I'll go by meself,\" said he. Further argument did not tend to con- Arince him, and at length I consented to take him Avith me. The latest intelligence we had heard of the fugitives was that they were in Naples. To Naples accordingly we went, and, in spite of all my regrets, I could not help being keenly influenced by the attractions of that remarkable city. It is the most animated and enchant-"], [88, "76 AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? ing city of Italy, and shines the more brightly when compared with the solemn and dreamy Rome. We had been detained long at the custom-house, and night had spread her wings over the earth as we drove along the quay to our hotel, the Villa di Roma, which is situated on the sea shore. Vesuvius was hidden from us, for no flame gave sign of its internal life ; but along the sides of the harbour countless little lamps glittered in the booths, and gas lights flamed in the shops, and were re flected in their numerous looking-glasses, whilst, high above the dark forest of masts, the reA'olving light of the lighthouse shone, now brighter, now fainter in the dark sky.

I wandered daily into galleries and churches, and frequented all the public resorts of the pleasure-loving Neapolitans, without success.

These were mostly women, who glanced at me inquisitively with their dark Italian eyes, which seemed to ask me why, if I came there at all, I did not join in their worship. I was not at that moment in a mood for higher thoughts, although I could- not but feel the calm influence of the place. Beyond resting a little while, I had no motive in being there, and was leaving the place again when my attention was attracted to a form which seemed familiar. It was that of a lady who was standing near the confessional in earnest conversa tion with the priest. Something told me that I had seen the figure before, and I waited long and eagerly to see her face, but the length of her confession surprised me, and after a time I went to the door of the church, feeling sure that I could not"], [101, "\\ATH0 AVAS TO BLAME? 89 miss her Avhen she came out.

How she had left the building unperceived was a mystery. I cannot think of the event at this moment without recalling the feeling of bitter dis gust and misery which overcame me. It seemed in that moment as if death would haAre been preferable to any further know ledge of her life and habits. I wandered back to my hotel totally distracted, and spent the remainder of the day in a be wildered dream. O'Hara was away, bent upon following out some directions and inquiries, and I was alone.

The oppression of spirit which had seized me in the church so grew upon me in the course of the day that I became almost insane, and, rambling along one of the crowded streets towards evening, the horrible thought occurred to me to end my unhappiness by self-destruction. I walked deliberately into a gunsmith's shop and purchased a pistol. No notice whatever was attracted by this, for in a place like Naples the strangest whims of the English visitors would pass unheeded.

Far away, in the stillness of the evening, I could hear the deep low tones of the bells of the city mingling their echoes with the splash of the sea. Far away, like the shrine of some awful sacri fice, towered the giant mountain, whose incense eternally rose to heaven. Ever and anon there came faint echoes of music, or the splash of oars upon the sea beneath, or murmur of laughing voices. From the city of beauty and pleasure I had wan dered here to die. Once more I surveyed the enchanting prospect ; once more I murmured a prayer ; then, giving myself a willing victim to the fate I could not control, I raised the fatal weapon to my brow.

Little dreaming of the events that would spring from that journey, I started, glad of an object which was likely to benefit another. Thankful for any change to relieve my melancholy thoughts, I deter mined to take the journey on horseback. i 2"], [128, "116 WHO AVAS TO BLAME ?

Before I could do so the tempest came \u2014 thunder, lightning, Avind, and rain \u2014 so that my unfortunate horse, as well as myself, was nearly blinded.

The landlord commented upon my con dition in much the same style as the ostler. I inquired for a room and a fire to dry my soaked clothing. He opened the door of a small neat par lorn-, looking cheerless enough at first, but the portly host promised there should be a fire in a few moments, and he kept his word with right good will.

Baffled in this endeavour, it sought an entrance doAvn the chimney, and, finding it could not put out the fire, entirely filled the room Avith smoke. At length, when, notwithstanding all discouragement, the fire would burn up, then the wind, like a defeated legion, un willing to give any credit to the ATictor, returned muttering defiance, and growled savagely in the hollow chimney for an hour or so, adding merely to my enjoyment thereby. I sat for some time in a broAvn study, dreaming over past days and past things, that had been, and others, alas! which might have been, when I was aroused by the stamping of feet in the passage and the flapping of a heaAy umbrella, which clicked so much when it was closed by its owner that it was evidently not improved in condition by its recent contact with the elements."], [131, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 119 A voice, probably belonging to the OAvner of the umbrella, was calling out, \"Here!

Wondering what influence Mr. Creakle could have with the aristocracy; wondering, too, what business or profession could keep a man like this in such a jovial frame of mind ; wondering, most of all, at the strange fate which after so many changes had brought me to this spot, I asked if the place would be worth seeing. \"That of course depends upon indi- Addual fancy,\" answered my companion. \"Some like ruins and statues, some like lakes and grottos, some woods and water falls, but Castlehead will be pretty sure to please. For my part, much as I respect the aristocracy, I should like some of their parks ploughed up.\" After some further conversation, which was continued till late, we determined to stay for the night at the inn, and go together in the morning to see Castlehead. I was extremely puzzled to know what was the nature of Mr. Creakle's influence"], [143, "AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? 131 at Castlehead. I was struck also by the remark he had made, that \u2022 Castlehead Avas in want of a master, but no question of mine could draw from that gentleman any hint as to his private affairs. \"Sir,\" said he when we retired for the night, ' ' in the morning, if we have any favourable change in the weather, your humble seiwant will be most happy to con vey you to Castlehead. I presume you will be up in good time.\" I promised to do so, and we parted. Mr. Creakle no doubt slept well ; for my part, I could not sleep at all. The night continued to be stormy, and I listened to the howling of the wind and the pattering of the rain, till at last I fell into an uneasy slumber, and was disturbed by vivid dreams. I dreamt that I was walking in the woods surrounding Castlehead, and the strangest part of my dream was this : that, k 2"], [144, "132 AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? haA'ing since seen the place, I should be able to confirm, as it were, the actual ap pearance as being precisely that of my dream. Wien I dreamt this I had never yet seen it, or anything like it. I was walking in the woods, and Eleanor was with me, looking full of soul and beauty. Now, to say that her beauty was of a per fect kind would be exaggeration, the fact being that my wife would generally have been considered by far the most beautiful, especially by the sculptor or painter. But it does not always follow that the greatest beauty is the deepest inspirer of the strong est human passion. There is a mystery in passion which beauty of form and face can seldom solve. There is a beauty which may discover itself to another mind in some special mo ment, and which ever after, while life lasts, runs no risk of disenchantment. Such a beauty met my eyes at that moment of my"], [145, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 133 dream. We talked as we rambled, when suddenly we became enveloped in a wild tangled mass of boughs and briars. I struggled, Avith all the impotent despair that seizes us in dreams, to set her free. For a moment it seemed as though we had regained our liberty, when suddenly in the ground beneath our feet a terrific gulf opened. It widened as though rent asunder by an earthquake, and before the fear which had rooted us to the spot could be overcome we were parted. I stretched out my hands with a vain cry for help, and, seeing its hopelessness, would have plunged into the horrid gulf, but the same sweet look from Eleanor restrained me. I was as powerless to move in opposition to that look as a fiend would be to drag down an angel from Paradise. While, with fixed eyes and frenzied thoughts, I stood paralysed on the brink the sweet vision of Eleanor faded like a mirage"], [146, "134 WHO WAS TO BLAME ? from before my eyes. Trembling in every limb, cold, horror-struck, I awoke. The morning was fair, the sun shining gaily, and the early davm breaking, as I lifted the little white curtain of my casement. There was a delicious fragrance in the air, and not a sound to be heard, save the gentle twittering of the birds, or the occasional sighing of the wind through the neighbouring woods. Disturbed by my dream, which still haunted me, it was some time before I could think calmly. Then, as I looked out of the Avindow over the distant land- scape, over which a faint golden haze had been throAvn, like a fairy veil, I saw, like a vision, the bold front of the mansion of Castlehead rising out of the rosy mist, like the clear thought of an exquisite poet, gradually taking shape and form out of the chaos of a day dream. My new friend was on the alert. I could"], [147, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 135 hear him walking about in his bedroom, and was shortly saluted by his cheery voice. \"Come, that's well,\" said he. \"I see you can rise, if not with the lark, perhaps with the linnet. But really, now I come to think of it, I don't know which bird puts off its nightcap first. So-ho, landlord, for breakfast, with what cheer you may.\" The landlord, taking, as I fancied, his cue rather from me than from Mr. Creakle, set before us a substantial repast, which my companion did not fail to praise, and something more. I had noticed during our short intimacy that Mr. Creakle, despite his warmth of manner, did not seem on the best possible terms Avith our host ; and upon leaAang the house to start forth on our journey I could perceive, as I thought, a desire on the landlord's part to say something to me. Accordingly I lingered a little, and alloAved"], [148, "136 AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? my companion to go a few yards down the road. He was scarcely out of hearing when the landlord said, in a stage whisper, \" Be very careful, sir, be very careful.\" \"Careful of what, my good man?\" I asked him, laughingly. \"Careful, sir, not to lend Mr. Creakle anything. You don't know what a man he is. He has such ways. Of course, sir, you AA-ill pay for what has been ordered ?\" \" By myself, of course.\" \" Oh ! indeed, sir ! Then I am again de ceived. Oh ! what a fool I am ever to take his word ! \" \" Make your mind easy,\" I said to the host. \"It is rather a cool proceeding to quarter himself upon a stranger in this fashion, but he may be able to do me some service. If so, I shall not grudge the pay.\" Considerably relieved, the host went back into the house."], [149, "AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 137 We set out through Avinding lanes and lovely meadow paths, such as are rarely to be met with out of Devonshire. The fresh morning air was delightful, the sun tinted the trees and grass, the dewdrops hung like diamonds upon the leaves, Mr. Creakle hummed and whistled as gaily and cheer fully as the birds themselves ; so we trudged along till we reached the gates of the park. The lodge alone proved at a glance that, as Mr. Creakle said, it wanted a master. The Avindow frames were decayed, the broken panes stuffed with old rags or bits of paper, half the thatch either rotted away or blown off the roof, the little garden in front a perfect wilderness of nettles and thistles, and the ivy, as if tired of clinging any longer to such a forlorn dwelling, had dropped from its fastenings, and crept along the ground. If any one lived in this dilapi dated abode, he was evidently not an early riser, for we could make no one hear."], [150, "138 WHO WAS TO BLAME ? We called out lustily as we stopped at the gate, admiring the elegant scrollwork which ornamented it, and glancing through at the magnificent woods, which awoke admiration even in Mr. Creakle's breast. He stopped for a time his fight flippant tone, and was silent Avith admiration, though the place appeared to be quite familiar to him. \"We have aroused some one at last. Come, Sally, my girl, I've brought a gentle man to see yTour establishment, and I thought you intended we should go away again ungratified. Make haste, my old girl.\" \"Make haste!\" grumbled the crone. \"When you're my time of life, Mr. Creakle, you won't make so much haste, may be.\" However, she quickened her pace a little, and we passed into the park. \" There is a little knoll, my dear sir,\" said Mr. Creakle, \" where we can see all over the park, and away twenty miles"], [151, "AVH0 WAS TO BLAME ? 139 beyond, if you like ; though, for my part, like jovial Sydney Smith, I prefer 'short views.'\" As we were speaking we reached the higher ground he had spoken of, and the prospect was indeed very lovely : heavy woods, a shining expanse of silvery lake, far-spreading green lawns, with glimpses of bold rock, standing like Druid altars amidst the trees, and covered with ivy, a stately ruin, hoary, and crumbling in the gay morning sun. It was truly a delicious scene, well worthy of the journey I had taken, if no other idea had possessed me. I was deeply impressed by the solitude. It seemed as though the place stood mute and expectant of its future OAATier, as though the enchanted landscape lay in a fairy-like dream, only to be wakened to life and reality by the presence of some long-lost inheritor of the domain."], [152, "140 WHO WAS TO BLAME ? The place was nearly deserted, the house being shut up, except a room or two tenan ted by a withered grey-headed man, the son of the old dame who opened the gate for us, but who looked nearly as old as his mother. He seemed to have become faded and shrunken with the fading splendour of the place and the neglect into which everything had fallen, and he Avinked and blinked, as he came out into the bright sunshine, like a superannuated owl dis turbed in its sanctuary of the belfry by a sudden peal on the bells at some unusual hour. \" Well, Barnard, my man, how are you getting along ? \" said Mr. Creakle. \"Getting along, eh? We don't get along much here. Time was when things were cheerful enough, and such a horse could be seen in yon stables as couldn't be matched every day, and such a bottle of old port in the cellar as did your heart"], [153, "AATI0 AVAS TO BLAME ? 141 good to think on.

The park palings were broken down, and the cattle of the neighbouring fields strayed in and out just as they pleased. \" Probably,\" I said to Mr. Creakle, as we walked back to the inn, \"you could, for a consideration, introduce me to the present proprietor of this place.\" Mr. Creakle put his finger to one side of his nose, with an air of great mystery, and, looking round, as though anxious to be certain that we were not overheard, said in a hollow whisper \u2014 \" Whatever you do, my dear sir, or what ever I do, name not the commission.\" \" The commission ! what do you mean? \""], [157, "AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 145 ' ' Upon the sale of Castlehead, my dear sir.

A NEW OCCUPATION. We had quite a merry dinner, and Mr. Creakle did full justice, as before, to the excellence of the fare, which, as the land lord now understood, I was to pay for. I plied him with wine, but his tongue seemed completely under his own control, no matter how fast it gabbled. Not a word could I get likely to be of any use to me in the present or the future, but of the past he rattled away glibly. \"All in good time, my dear sir, all in good time,\" he said in answer to my questions.

He proceeded \u2014 \" That young gentleman, holding Aaews in harmony with his parent, took me home a visitor from college.

A new impulse had seized me. I had failed to influence my wife ; but it was not without a latent feeling of pride, and a desire perhaps to punish her impertinent sneers at my busi ness capabilities, which led me at once to determine upon searching out the mystery of Castlehead to the very bottom, and, if possible, establishing my claim to the estate. \"You have not told me, Mr. Creakle,\" I said, \" why the place has been allowed to fall into this deplorable condition.\" \" My friend's father,\" he answered, \"was a vain, self-willed, obstinate man, yet not"], [163, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 151 without feeling. He endeavoured to hide his motives from others, but it was easy to see that pride was at the root of all his harshness to his son. When my friend found that his influence Avith his father had failed he ceased ever to visit Castle- head. After a time the old man began to get gloomy and morbid. He would gladly have welcomed his son back, for I believe he loved him. Then the mother died, and Sir Mark became more rigid than ever. Your humble servant has a vision of an old man wandering as in quest of some thing, but he wandered in vain, and his infernal pride would never allow him to make the case public. Then came his death, and the property passed into other hands ; and then Mr. Creakle, the nar rator of this true history, obtained his commission,\" said he, winding up with a smile. Thus another day passed, and I became"], [164, "152 AVHO AV4S TO BLAME ? so engrossed with the new project upon which I had set my mind that I had taken no further steps on behalf of O'Hara. After more wine and more rattling talk from Mr. Creakle, we separated again, with a promise from him that steps should be immediately taken to place me in com munication with the person or persons he professed to represent. We were late, and, fatigued Avith the rest less night I had had before and the walking during the day, I slept longer than usual. When I awoke, and came down to a late breakfast, I inquired for my companion, but he was nowhere to be found. I called the host, but he was evidently quite igno rant of Mr. Creakle's whereabouts. After, therefore, waiting a considerable time, I finished my breakfast alone. \"It is very odd Mr. Creakle has not come in to breakfast,\" I said again to the landlord."], [165, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 153 \"Well, sir, you see, sir, Mr. Creakle is curious in his ways.\" ' ' He is, indeed. I only hope his curious ways have not induced him to make free A\\rith any property belonging to me.\" \"Oh, dear! no, sir. There's no fear of anything of that sort.\" \" Well, but how does he live ? What is his profession ? Who employs him ? \" \" Well, sir, all we know is that Mr. Crea kle never pays anybody anything. If a stranger comes here (begging your pardon, sir, and hope no offence) Mr. Creakle ge nerally makes a property of him. If any body asks him for money, he says he will pay it out of his commission.\" \" When you see him again,\" I muttered, ' ' be good enough to say that you have a 'commission' from me to horsewhip him.\" \" Yes, sir ; and I think it would do him good,\" said the host, laughing. The more I considered Mr. Creakle's"], [166, "154 WHO WAS TO BLAME? conduct the more I became convinced that there was something Avrong connected with the Castlehead estate. I had been so ac customed to combat with difficulties in my upward path in the factory that I became quite eager and interested in folloAvdng out this fresh scheme. To establish my claim to Castlehead, to restore the place to its pristine splendour, to awaken new life and energy amongst the Avretched villagers and loungers, poachers, and pillagers who infested the place, would be an occupation worthy of time, talent, and wealth to accomplish. If the place became mine, it would be a home for the few friends who were steadfast to me ; and I fancied the pride and pleasure of O'Hara established as factotum in such a noble place. The old man would be as vain as a peacock. But this is counting my chickens before they are hatched."], [167, "155 CHAPTER XIII. SUNDRY LETTERS. From Richard Fihbes, Esq., Liner Temple. My dear Sir, The important commission with which you entrusted us, a month since, has received due attention. The result of careful inquiries is now in our hands, and places it beyond doubt that you have a prospect of obtaining your right to the estate and manor of Castlehead, Devon. The estate of Castlehead, aforesaid, we have ascertained to have been the property of your grandfather, Sir Mark Irving, who, by Mary, daughter of the late Hugh"], [168, "AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 156 Clayton, of Stadminster, had issue Mark Irving, your father, heir to the estates of Castlehead, as aforesaid, and all benefits, rights, and privileges thereunto apper taining. Furthermore, we find that the heir to the aforesaid Castlehead estate did, by reason of marrying a domestic employed in the aforesaid mansion of Castlehead, grievously offend and alienate your grand father, the aforesaid Sir Mark Irving. Also that, by reason of the said offence and alienation from the said Sir Mark Irving, your father was not known to haA'e again appeared at the aforesaid Castlehead mansion during your grandfather, the said Sir Mark Irving's, lifetime. We further find that your grandfather, the aforesaid Sir Mark Irving, did make sundry wills and bequests respecting the aforesaid Castlehead property, some of which are known to have been destroyed."], [169, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 157 But we furthermore discover your grandfather, the aforesaid Sir Mark Irving, to have been greatly under the influence of a confidential steward, whose conduct will scarcely bear scrutiny, and who is believed to be still living somewhere in the neighbourhood of the aforesaid Castle head, and to have communications with a confederate in Ireland who lays claim to an interest in the aforesaid property of Castlehead. In conclusion, we beg to state that we have discovered that a person of doubtful character, and resembling in many respects the person who had gained your grand father, the said Sir Mark Irving's, confi dence, has made statements respecting his own connection with the aforesaid Castle- head estate which are in the highest de gree important. What may be the present condition and circumstances of the afore- said confidential servant we cannot take"], [170, "AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 158 upon ourselves to say without further infor mation. We may, however, furthermore, add that his age would be nearly that of your OAvn father, and that his name is Crokle, Carkle, or Creakle, our informant having probably been misled in that particular by the peculiarity of the Devonshire pronun ciation. From Jonathan Creakle. Honoured Sir, Upon a memorable day some weeks since, when I had the felicity to be your guide, philosopher \u2014 may I add, and friend ? \u2014 when in your esteemed society we gaily trudged the woodland path and merrily leaped the stile, as an esteemed poet so picturesquely describes \u2014 fate had not fore shadowed the probability of my becoming of any future importance to you. But, as"], [171, "WHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 159 another esteemed poet remarks, ' coming events cast then- shadows before,' and it must have been a coming event of no ordi nary magnitude which has cast its gigantic shadow in the path of that unfortunate and deluded victim of misplaced confidence, Jonathan Creakle. For some Aveeks it has been the unhapjiy condition of the above to have been a marked man, to be watched, to be sus pected, to have his outgoings reported, his gettings-up commented upon, his lyings doAvn discussed, to be asked, by persons of whom he has neither knowledge nor acquaintance whatever, questions relating to persons, places, and things \u2014 persons, as, for instance, the former distinguished pro prietor of Castlehead \u2014 places, as, for in stance, the mansion just named \u2014 things, as, for instance, certain documents, deeds, wills, and legal papers, of no use (See advertisement) to any one but the rightful"], [172, "160 WHO AVAS TO BLAME ? owner, who offers certain equivalents (See advertisement, Richard Fibbes, Esq., Inner Temple, London) for trustworthy informa tion on behalf of Mark Irving, Esq., Star- cross. Now, with due deference to Richard Fibbes, Esq., Inner Temple, London, I may candidly state, once for all, that he is no man for my money, or, if he prefers to transpose the sentence, I am no man for his money. No, sir. The too-easily-im pressed individual who now addresses you is constrained to admit, in confidence, that he would rather not accept the benevolent intentions of Richard Fibbes, Esq. It matters little that an esteemed bard, proba bly the swan of Avon, has asked what's in a name ? I answer, ' Much,' and decline to give information. Had I, however, when imbibing the social glass and droAvning care in the bowl at the wayside hotel two miles from"], [173, "AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? 161 Castlehead, been aware of the claim likely to be made on behalf of my distinguished entertainer, I might possibly have ren dered some service. But, sir, remember my stake in that magnificent property. In a moment of innocent weakness I imparted to you the foundation upon which my position in society was laid. Need I do more than allude to the ' commission ? ' To proceed \u2014 you came to Castlehead, and, like the antique Roman, observed, ' I came \u2014 I saw \u2014 I \u2014 wish to purchase.' My imagination conjured up a prospect of Castlehead once more inhabited, decorated, resuscitated, renovated, invigorated, but with that pleasing picture before my eyes came the shadow of a dark thought, which was that with Castlehead sold the occupation of Jonathan Creakle would be, as the bard observes, gone.

A voyage to an island all of whose sons are said to be brave and women pure, and whose potato crops are the envy of the surrounding nations, enabled me to accomplish my object ; but, alas ! my well meant endeavours have been rudely re jected. My principal is without principle, aud I was treated with disdain. Anxious, therefore, to do my duty in that state of life to which Providence has been pleased to call me, I hereby tender the services of one whose experience of men and things is not altogether contemptible ; and, while the fate of the ' commission ' trembles in the balance of circumstances, I remain, yours to command, Jonathan Creakle.\""], [175, "AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 163 If anything could increase the astonish ment I felt after reading the foregoing letters it was certainly the contents of another which I now opened. The address was in an unfamiliar hand, but the tracing of the enclosure could never be mistaken. From Constance. Dear Mark, I wonder if you are still as unfor- giving as ever, and I wonder too if I were to die, which I suppose I shall do one of these days or nights, if my affectionate manufacturer will have a tear to spare over my grave. You will see that I have left Italy, my last engagement being in Dublin, where I happened to pick up a piece of wonderful news. Goodness, Mark, is it possible that you stand a reasonable chance of becoming a baronet ? \u2014 that in fact you m 2"], [176, "164 AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? are ' rightful heir,' as we say on the boards, to a fine estate, and never told me what a magnificent prospect was in store for me ? For of course I shall come back and make myself at home, and of course my dear Mark will forget all about the smoky factory and hissing steam engines and grinding wheels, the noise of which nearly drove me mad. The way I became acquainted with this is curious. An impudent fellow was in Dublin at the same hotel with me, and got into hot water with the host because he ran up a score he was unable to pay. As far as I can remember (for you know of old, Mark, I was a wretched hand at re membering people's names), this fellow's cognomen was Creakle, or something simi lar, and for cool unblushing determination to make the most of himself I never saw his equal. When the host got in a rage with bim because he could not pay his bill"], [177, "AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 165 Mr. Creakle proposed to take the Assembly Room, and giAre a musical lecture. I don't believe the fellow ever knew a note of music in his life. In the dilemma the bewildered landlord appealed to Madame Constance, for I still sing in that name. Really I was so amused that I sang for nothing, to illustrate his lecture, being curious to see the end of the affair. He went in for music as though he had been a musical conductor all his life. Bach car ried no burden for him ; Handel he turned without the slightest difficulty ; Bishop was one of his cardinal points ; and after all the Christian composers he threw a Pagan ninny into the bargain. He was a com plete noArice in everything connected with the art, but the musical chord could not be found capable of entangling him. He had a capital audience, and went off with a few pounds in hand after settling his hotel bill. He was extremely complacent to me,"], [178, "166 AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? and, judge my astonishment, imparted the information that he had the power to restore the heir of an ancient estate to his rightful possession. Little did I dream that in this odd fashion I should discover a new future for my manufacturer. So now, Mark, I shall expect a full, true, and particular account of the glories of Castlehead, and the date of your taking possession. You may certainly expect me there as soon as you are comfortably settled. Meantime, any suggestion I can make respecting fur niture and fitting-up you are welcome to, and I shall announce the farewell appear ances of Madame Constance immediately. From Aunt Mary. My dear Boy, \"What is all this about baronets and Castleheads, woodenheads, blockheads, and other heads ? One had need of a guillo-"], [179, "AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? 167 tine to take them all off. I hope they won't turn my dear boy's head. But tell me now, and mind you write at once, for I have a woman's curiosity, and an old Avoman's to boot, and am not easily satisfied. Of course I knew your poor dear mother's history, but I always heard that your fero cious old grandfather had adopted some legal kind of excommunication to get rid of his son for ever, and cut off all prospect of inheriting the estate. I wonder if his ghost has been wandering about the old place disconsolate till it has told the secret to some one ; but of course you will tell me all about it, and then I shall be as wise as other folks. I hope there is some truth in it, for my dear boy is restless and dissatisfied I knoAV, and this will be an object for him to expend his superfluous energy upon. He will erect model cottages, put stained glass windows in the church, buy a gallery of"], [180, "168 AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? pictures, and follow the hounds, of course. But now, like my sex, I am coming at last to the main subject of my story. You will wonder, Mark, how an old woman in this quiet place should have got hold of the news, and I will tell you. Your wife has actually written to me, of all persons in the world, and she tells me that you have for given and forgotten everything, and she is to be mistress of Castlehead, as if nothing had happened. Strange news this, my dear boy ; but if you can find it in your heart to take her back again, well and good \u2014 I say nothing. If my dear boy is happy, his foolish old Aunt Mary Arill be happy too, and not grumble at the means by which the happiness has been attained. A Second Letter from Mr. Creakle. Honoured Sir, To adopt the language of a novelist"], [181, "WHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 169 whose prolific writings have given me con siderable pleasure, I may commence as follows : \u2014 A few clays since, at a late hour of the evening, a man, probably about forty years of age, was seen hastily picking his way through the miry and unlighted tho roughfare, which could not by any stretch of courtesy be called a street, but which served as the principal roadway in the little town of Ballyrandon. He was a tall, portly, and well-made man ; his features were regular, and had that brilliant showy kind of effect which some ladies are dis- posed to consider handsome. The more accurate observer, however, could not fail to remark the sardonic self-satisfied smile that occasionally gleamed upon his fea tures, and the hungry sensual glare of his eyes, while the sinister expression of his countenance Avas greatly increased by a peculiar Mephistophelian curl of the upper"], [182, "170 WHO WAS TO BLAME ? lip from time to time, as he hastily walked along, evidently pondering some deep-laid scheme. It would have been difficult for a stranger to speak of his condition in life, for cos- tume in these days gives so little indi- cation of our worldly standing, unless we are soldiers or policemen ; but there was a freedom in the manner of this man which seemed to bespeak a certain famili- arity Avith the good things of this world and (judging by his face) an indifference to the prospects of the next. The evening was wet and stormy, and there were not many passengers abroad. Of those few, some passed the man I have described with a sulky stare, others with a side glance so sinister as to imply that they would gladly do him a mischief if they had the oppor tunity. Others there were whose sole de sire appeared to be to slink out of his sight as speedily as possible. It was very clear"], [183, "WHO WAS TO BLAME? 171 that the man, while he held his umbrella firmly, and buttoned his coat closer, was perfectly conscious that he was recognised by all that passed him. It was also quite as clear that he, outwardly at least, affected extreme indifference to these symptoms. He pushed on, intent upon his own ideas, whatever they were. Judging, too, by the externals of Bally randon on a wet stormy evening, it would seem that there could not be many inhabi tants in such a place whose good opinion would materially influence this portly and important looking gentleman. Whoever follows up the march of in tellect may take the word of Jonathan Creakle that they have certainly made a mistake in the turning when they come to Ballyrandon, and will imagine that our boasted nineteenth century progress has gone backAvard a few hundred years, for if the Ancient Briton fared as badly as"], [184, "AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 172 the modern Celt in this remote little town, Jonathan Creakle cordially sympathises Avith his condition, and is happy to know, by the centuries that have passed, that he is well out of his troubles.

Can I forget the lamentable little court in which, as I passed, party feel ing ran high, and so little moderation was observed in an argument that shillelahs were employed to give force and emphasis to any knotty \u25a0 point where logic and rhe toric failed ?

If in Ballyrandon there may yet exist some of those tame and spiritless people who are contented to earn their own bread and spend their own money, Jonathan Creakle would be glad to know them. As it is, with many apologies for this digres sion, I proceed. The person whose por trait I have faintly sketched had found it to his account to leaA^e England, and lived at this place ostensibly as a land surveyor, but I may remark that when he surveyed land it was with a view to possession. He had, it was rumoured, frequently undertaken commissions with much greater secresy than was con sistent with the simple proceeds of land measuring. I had followed him at a respectful"], [186, "174 WHO AVAS TO BLAME ? distance for some time, when he stopped at the door of a house of good appearance in the outskirts of the town. The door was opened by a gabbling old Irishman, whose light was blown out in a moment.

Enough, I stood Avithin the house of my enemy, and my enemy was not aware of the fact.

He sat down by a fire, without looking round, till his factotum brought a light, when the"], [187, "AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 175 astonishment of the pair at perceiving Jonathan Creakle was a thing to dream of, not to tell. I have said that my host was considered by some a good-looking man, but of all the fiends I have ever imagined in my dreams he certainly was the most fiendish. He did not utter one word ; only, with a slight movement, he opened the drawer of a desk close at hand, and taking therefrom a pistol, carefully and deliberately loaded it, laid it on the table beside him, looked at me, and pointed to the door. The hint could not be lost upon an im agination so active as that of Jonathan Creakle. He decamped without further ceremony.

I will not weary the reader with the details of my obtaining possession of Castle head. It is enough to say that Mr. Creakle upon discovering which course of action was likeliest to prove of the most advantage to him wisely followed that path. The con sequence was that, with unexjiected ra pidity, I succeeded in establishing my claim and tracking out Mr. Cregan, who, after much bluster and many threats, event ually gave up some important papers, which materially aided my legal advisers. This Cregan had, it appeared, when a vouth, ingratiated himself with my grand- VOL. II.

Owing, however, to reckless and dissolute habits, the ascendancy he had acquired was of little service to him, and, beyond ille gally receiving for the time some of the rents of the estate, he had derhred but little benefit from his nefarious scheme. Much had been done to restore the home of my ancestors, and I had actuallv taken possession of Castlehead. Notwith standing- all my care to take to the estate quietly, I discovered that every particular of my past life had been duly canvassed in the neighbourhood, and preparations had been made, much against my will, to give me a reception. Too many thoughts, occupied my mind for me to feel much interest in these cere- monies, and it was with great effort that I passed through the day Avithout giving dire offence to my neighbours."], [191, "WHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 179 The day and the place, as it appeared, then became fixedly impressed upon my memory. The calm golden haze of the summer afternoon, the cawing of the rooks, the sighing welcome of the broad-spreading trees, the faint glimmer of the sun upon the lake, and the solemn aspect of the many-gabled house itself, all disposed me rather to melancholy reflection than up roarious feasting. I had left all these arrangements to O'Hara, whom I had scarcely seen during the day. I could not look without some con- tempt upon the festivities got up in my honour on the occasion of my taking Castlehead. It was impossible for my neighbours to say if they Avould like me or not when we became better acquainted.

However, I bore the infliction as best I could, neither stopping my ears when the peal in the neighbouring belfry became overwhelming, nor unfurling my umbrella to protect me from the shower of roses, lilies, and hollyhocks which were pelted into the carriage as we parsed under a sort of triumphal arch in the avenue leading to the mansion. I eAren kept my countenance when the Odd Fellows' band played ' See the Conquering Hero Comes,' which was about as appropriate to my feelings at that moment as the ' Dead March in Saul.'

There was still a passionate feeling of reA-olt in my mind as I conjured up the past. I could not yet see the infinite wisdom which was to purify my heart and lead my thoughts into a higher region. I compared my inflated visions of the past with what had been realised, and still fondly imagined the life I might have led.

What letter is it that looks like the gal lows, that some of ye will come to if ye don't mend your ways ?\" After much cogitation it was decided that the letter F had, as printed upon the schoolroom wall, a remote resemblance to O'Hara's similitude. \" Timothy Howler, go to the top of the class, and mind ye keep there,\" said O'Hara \" And now, where's the fine boy that'll open his mouth very wide Avithout anything to put in it, and say what letter he's got hold of?\""], [203, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 191 This seemed forcible, and the lads, too many of them knowing full well what it was to open their '\u2666mouths very wide and to have nothing to put in them, called out \"0\" lustily. \"By the powers we're mending, and ye'll all be scholars yet. But, murder ! here's one ye'll never find out, though it's as like a five-barred gate as I am to Jupiter.\" A distant notion that it must be the letter M inspired Timothy Howler ; but, fearful of losing his former laurels, he murmured faintly. \" Spake the truth and shame the diAal, and you'll read that in the Bible, Timothy Howler. Out with it, you spalpeen.\" Timothy ventured again, and was re warded Avith O'Hara's cordial applause. \" Now, boys, ye've a janius at the top of the class, and ye must sharpen your wits.

Now, Simon Lobb, make yourself a practical illustration, and tell us all about it.\" Neither Simon nor the others could dis- cover any affinity between his open mouth, with the tip of his tongue hanging out, and the letter Q, but O'Hara's Aavid fancy insisted upon the resemblance, and he scolded accordingly. \" Now, if ye'll tell me what letter looks like the ould scarecrow with his arms stretched out to frighten the birds from the corn, I'll forgive ye the bating ye deserve.\" The resemblance to the letter T seemed by this comparison to fall within the scope of the rural fancy. \" Now haven't ye seen an elegant trunk of a tree with two big branches shooting up?\" Timothy Howler maintained his supe riority, for he suggested Y at once."], [205, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 193 \"You'll be a bright man, Timothy Howler, and yer mother will bless the day she knew O'Hara.

But faith, my dear, in this hard world ye'll find its only four, I'm thinking. And if ye take two from four what will ye have left?\" That the schoolmaster had been abroad for an unusual length of time was evident, for the question remained unanswered. I had been standing just within the door of the room O'Hara had appropriated, listening with some amusement to his ori ginal mode of imparting the rudiments of learning, when I became conscious that VOL II. O"], [206, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 194 some one else was listening also. Glancing round, and fancATing for the moment that probably I merely stood in the path of another hopeful pupil for O'Hara, I saw that the person who watched was eAddently not intent upon the scene from any desire of obtaining instruction. I could only see the face imperfectly, but I fancied that I had not often witnessed a physiognomy more repulsive. I had but little time, how ever, to draw any conclusions therefrom as to the stranger's motives or presence, for he disappeared instantly. Something sinister in this act roused my suspicion, and, calling to O'Hara, who looked up startled from his new occupation, Avith a half sheepish grin on his face at being detected in his amateur teaching, he followed me at once, leaving his pupils in a state of great bewilderment. \" Yer honner,\" said O'Hara in a whisper as soon as we got out of the door, \" that's a"], [207, "AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? 195 character we'd do better without. He's been lurking about here two or three times.\" \"We'll find out what it means, if we can, O'Hara.\" \" But which way did he go, yer honner ?\" I pointed out the path I believed the man had taken, and we followed quickly. What might be the stranger's object or intention I did not stop to ask myself. Enough that it was an incident to divert my mind for the moment, and I welcomed it gladly. We passed out of the reflection of light which came from the schoolroom into the shadow of some large trees. At first we fancied we heard a rustle amongst the branches, but soon all was silent again, and we imagined it could only have been the wind, while in a hollow beneath these trees a little stream babbled incessantly. \" Hush, master, listen a moment,\" said O'Hara in a whisper. o 2"], [208, "196 A\\THO WAS TO BLAME ? We both peered into the wood, and saw a shadow of some kind beneath one of the trees. \" Who goes there?\" I cried out. There was no answer. \" You must have been deceived,\" I whispiered to O'Hara. \" Divil a bit, yer honner. I'd swear by all the saints that somebody passed us, and for no good purpose I fear.\" \" What purpose do you imagine?\" I asked. \" Surely there's not much to be gained by haunting such a lonely spot as this.\" As I said this, still in a whisper, we emerged from the thicket into a byepath leading to the house through some neigh bouring fields. It was not much frequented, but when any communication with the railway station was desired, then it formed the nearest access to those who went on foot. Suddenly, before we had cleared the"], [209, "AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 197 heavy shadow cast by the trees we had just left, a shot Avas fired from the thicket itself. A heavy fall was heard, and then a cry of pain. Startled beyond measure at such unusual sounds, we hurried to the spot to ascertain the cause. There, to our great surprise, eAridently much more frightened than hurt, we saw extended the form of Mr. Creakle. \" Villains, outcasts, plunderers,\" thus he saluted us, \" let me die in peace. Let me like a soldier fall upon the open plain, my breast expanding \u2014 alas ! no more will the breast of Creakle expand to those emotions which \u2014 \" \"Come, Mr. Creakle,\" I said, \" we are neither robbers nor villains.

He shortly got up, and walked with us in the direction of the house. We had not proceeded many yards, and Avere questioning Mr. Creakle as to the motiA^e for this outrageous act, when sud denly behind me came a hasty step.

That the attack upon Mr. Creakle was intended for me was evident, but it was long before the mystery was unravelled. Meantime I was removed to the house by O'Hara and Mr. Creakle, in a state appa rently more dead than alive. The best advice to be obtained within miles of Castlehead was sent for \u2014 at first it was believed with slight chance of success. Every effort was made to track my cow ardly assailant, but he had not been dis covered, and I still lay with small hope of recovery. The physician, however, was not with-"], [212, "200 WHO AA'AS TO BLAME ? out hope. He tried every available means, and had the satisfaction of seeing that the remedies administered had not been with- out their due effect ; and eventually, as he had prognosticated, the dark shadows which had obscured my brain for the last two or three days began to clear away. The impressions of the past and the life around me gradually became more distinct, and I began to have some understanding of my personal identity. I was free from pain, and lay in a quiet meditative mood, too weak to trouble my self much about what was going on in the world \u2014 scarce alive enough, in fact, to give due consideration to those who had watched and attended me so carefully, especially Cary, who had been sent for at once by O'Hara. The beneA-olent countenance of the phy sician inspired me Avith confidence in the result of his skill. Cary hovered about my"], [213, "WHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 201 bed, quiet and gentle in his manners, and more like a woman than a man in all his efforts to amuse me. I lay there watching them, too languid to move, and caring little to speak. Occa sionally Cary would give me a gentle shake of the hand, as if to assure me that every thing should be done that was possible. Much as he tried to conceal the expression of his thoughts about me, I could see plainly that he was still in doubt, and when he thought me asleep, and could get hold of the physician quietly, he was eager in the extreme to know if anything more could be done. \" If no change for the worse takes place there is no fear,\" I heard the physician whisper. \" But he has been on the very brink of the grave, doctor, has he not ? \" \" There is no question of that. Indeed, even now, when he is so much better, if"], [214, "202 WHO WAS TO BLAME ? there is any one he would like to see, for fear of any change, it would be well to send. Probably at such a time as this he might like to see his wife, or \u2014 \" That was all I could catch for the mo ment, when shortly I heard Cary again say softly \u2014 \"It is AATong, I know, doctor, to ply you with questions, but I have a reason of the utmost importance for asking them. Do you think now his mind is quite at ease ? \" \" Certainly not,\" emphatically replied the doctor. \"And probably if it could be soothed his recovery might be accel lerated. Beyond all question there is a weight upon the feelings which can easily be detected. Remove it if you can, by all means.\" I had fallen at this moment into a drowsy luxurious mood, neither sleeping nor waking, in which I remained for some"], [215, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 203 time without comprehending anything further. When I aroused myself again it was dark, the curtains were drawn, so as to exclude the glow of the setting sun, and the atmosphere of the apartment was dim; but after a few seconds I perceived my faithful friend sitting near me watching me intently. There Avas no one else in the room. All the others, even O'Hara, wearied out with sitting up two or three nights, had gone to bed, and he was taking their place. Looking at the dear kind hearted fellow, as he sat with his beautiful artistic head looking so noble in profile, and the side glance of his dreamy affec tionate eyes falling upon me, I could not help reproaching myself that I had in any way deterred him from declaring his passion to Eleanor. He was worthy of the purest and noblest woman, yet without doubt he would remain single to the end of his days."], [216, "204 WHO WAS TO BLAME ? I could not help wondering at the ex pression of his face as he loooked at me. It seemed as though he were endeavouring to penetrate some mystery in my character or to read my inmost thoughts at the moment, so intent was his gaze. \"Dear Cary,\" I said after a time, \" what are you thinking of so earnestly ? \" He took my hand and pressed it Avith the old mixture of affection and tender sympathy, but said nothing. \"Ah! Cary,\" I muttered, \"these are the moments when we recall inevitably so much that we would willingly forget. When I remember now how much and how uselessly I have injured you I am perfectly beside myself ; yet, let me confess it, all the circumstances that have hap pened haAre made no change in my feel ings. I should just as passionately, just as selfishly, follow in the same path I have done before if the opportunity came.\""], [217, "AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 205 \" I know that, my dear fellow,\" he an swered, \"and you should have my assist ance if I could render any.\" Gradually, in murmured talk like this, I sank once more into slumber and vague dreams. Hoav vividly the time comes before me again, with the long shadows of the lamp thrown in wonderful relief across the large room, the buzzing of a fly upon the window-pane, the rustle of the trees without, the sound of the distant bell, sub dued by distance, but near enough to re mind me how slowly the hours pass from morn to night when one is lying upon a sick bed ! I coidd keep no account of time : when I slept it seemed as though a year had passed away, or many years, and often when I awoke front the dull shunbers which weakness had created it seemed strange to me that my attendants looked as when I last saw them. It seemed"], [218, "206 WHO WAS TO BLAME ? as though they should have grown older. Upon one of these occasions I became conscious of some unusual activity in the room. Whatever it was I could not for some time divine, for Cary was so extremely quiet and gentle in his manner. When I became a little more conscious I saw at once it was Aunt Mary, who had arrived Avithout the least warning, and was sitting there as I knew her of old, her quick little eyes glancing round the room and taking in a moment a microscopic in ventory of everything, to see that I was well cared for and wanted nothing, then bending down over her knitting needles, for she was far too active to sit still Avithout doing anything. It was some time before she would allow me to speak upon anything but the merest commonplaces. Although she was quite certain of the thoughts that flowed most"], [219, "AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? 207 readily to my mind at that moment, and knew perfectly well that the simplest word about my old haunts and old infatuation would be of the deepest interest, yet she would insist upon speaking of other topics. Gradually, however, she yielded, and was full of all the little incidents of the life thaf was so dear to me. I listened to details of the simplest character with intense interest, and the nurse, often coming into the room and seeing my animated countenance, would look unutter able volumes of rebuke at Aunt Mary. Nurses in general have a great horror of anybody looking cheerful or hopeful in the neighbourhood of a sick room. Per haps they fancy if the event were made less solemn their importance would be diminished. So Aunt Mary chatted away, and, not withstanding the changes that had taken place, it seemed so like old times to have"], [220, "208 WHO WAS TO BLAME ? her sitting there that I unconsciously be gan to build up the old day dreams, un consciously began to indulge in the old hopes, until remembrance, like the passing gust of wind that blows into obhVion the sweetest tone that may have delighted us a moment before, swept off these fancies as they rose. Cary was somewhat disturbed by her presence. Indeed, I fancied I detected in the young artist's face an uneasy and perplexed expression, as though he were bent upon something which he found diffi cult to carry out satisfactorily. Whatever it was, I could learn nothing. Aunt Mary spoke little of Eleanor ; when she did it was always in such a manner as to stay at once any passionate effusion on my part. Much as I revolted at the self-denial she exacted from me, there was so much firmness and dignity combined with her love for me that I could only be silent."], [221, "AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? 209 Yielding to my intense desire, I had been removed from the bedroom to an adjoining chamber, where I could for a short time each day enjoy a beautiful pro spect of the park and the country beyond. A certain calm melancholy had succeeded to the animation which had at first filled me when Aunt Mary came. I still felt in doubt if I should recover, and ever and anon, when this thought came into my mind, I involuntarily wandered to Elea nor, till the desire to see her once more overcame every other consideration. But, supposing she knew of my state, would she come ? I was in doubt, and tormented myself till I became really ill again. I fancy when the mind becomes subdued to the thought that we must part with all we have most cherished life becomes more uniform, and death more easy. It is in some instances easier to endme than one day to be filled with the most delicious VOL. H. P"], [222, "210 WHO WAS TO BLAME ? hopes and the next to have them dashed to the earth. Musing thus one day, and getting each moment sadder in my thoughts, the desire of life seemed to leave me utterly. I could have wished to die that moment without another thought or care for the world. Unconsciously falling into a melancholy reverie, I was unaware that the door had opened, and that some one had entered. I looked up \u2014 it was Eleanor. Looking very loATely, pale indeed, paler than usual, with a dark circle round her beautiful soft eyes, now lighted with affec tionate interest in me, while her sweet face wore a timid smile, as though she scarcely dared trust herself in my presence to give vent to her natural feelings, all she said was \" I am very glad, Mark, to see you again.\" For me, I did not speak at all. She might have been an angel, a fairy, any thing; for the mist that came before my"], [223, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 211 eyes at that moment did not improve my vision. \" You have been badly used, I hear, Mark, but it is gratifying to find that you have been so well cared for. I don't know if I have done right in coming, and I dare say Aunt Mary will very much blame me, but Mr. Cary so much alarmed me by his account of you that I feared to find you even worse then you are.\" I bowed gently, or waved my hand, or made some motion to signify that she should continue to talk to me. That was all I wanted \u2014 to see and hear her. For me to say anything seemed worse than useless. Besides, what could I say ? So with a few gentle Avords she soothed me, and I felt happier than I had done for years \u2014 too happy, indeed, for when Aunt Mary shortly bustled in the sudden waking up to realities and stern facts was almost too painful to be borne. p 2"], [224, "212 CHAPTER XVII.

But I hate his very memory for leading me into an act of self deception. \"Through him I was led to believe myself beautiful and fascinating, and gave myself airs, and set myself above my neighbours.

He imagined that our spiritual wants might be made subservient to his temporal ditto, and he tried the experiment Avith great success. Jonas Hadder had conceived a great idea \u2014 nothing less than building a chapel for himself upon voluntary contri butions. He was not a man to hide his light under a bushel. He chose the most prominent situation in the whole village, and persuaded a builder to commence ope rations, for he was aware how much the object would be forwarded by a practical exhibition of his views. The more con- spicuous the fold, thought the ReAr. Jonas, the easier for the flock to find it ; and the better chance of letting the pews, said a few malcontents, who woidd persist in some self-seeking on the part of the new minister.

I could not help contrasting my own gloomy disappointment and dark melancholy with the quiet fortitude with which the old lady dismissed the dream of her youth and resigned herself to the subdued life of an old maid. My feelings were the inevitable result of merely looking back. But still it will hardly be wondered at that, with Eleanor in the house at the moment, I could not battle with old feel ings with much success. Especially as I longed to see her again,"], [239, "WHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 227 I hardly dared ask Miss Verschoyle. I knew how objectionable Eleanor's A'isit had been to her. Wondering what would be the next turn in the tide of events, I determined to make no further effort to stem it, but to let all chance as it would. Little did I imagine what was at that moment passing beneath my oaati roof, or the exciting scene which was shortly to follow my aunt's quiet narration. I think it is Heine who speaks so rap turously of the effect of a beautiful hand upon his imagination. I had been studying German, and was reading those delightful Pictures of Travel, which are so different from any other German writing whateArer. Miss Verschoyle being silent, I took up the book again and read \u2014 \" The face of the lady was concealed from me, partly by the white veil she wore, and partly by the confessional : but there came Q 2"], [240, "228 AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? to view a hand Avhich at once held me fast. I could not help looking at it : its blue veins and the aristocratic gleam of its white fingers were so strangely familiar to me, and all the power of dreams in my soul was stirred into life to shape a face to match this hand. It was a hand that had something spiritual in it, something ex citing past associations, like the hands of handsome human beings who are highly refined and accomplished, or who have greatly suffered. And there was something so touchingly innocent in this hand that it seemed as if it had no occasion to con- fess with the rest of the lady's person.\" As though the thought expressed in the book had magic in it, and had conjured up the very shape it described, there ap peared before me a hand which answered the description I had just read \u2014 a hand that at once suggested some indefinite sense of purity and sweetness, such as no other"], [241, "AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 229 hand had eA*er done, nor this indeed till that moment.

In a few soft words of condolence and sympathy, she expressed her satis faction at finding me so much better than she expected, and yielding, as I knew, to her aunt's determined pressure, was at once leaving the house again. I took the hand thus offered me, and Avhilc I did so a presentiment filled me that I was taking it thus for the last time \u2014 that I should ultimately clasp that hand as mine or never clasp it again. With this thought in my breast, I held her hand firmly, feeling as I did so strengthened in the resohe I mentally made at the mo ment, never again to allow any temptation to be put in her way with regard to me which could bring her any regret or un-"], [242, "230 AVII0 AVAS TO BLAME ? easiness.

She first closed the door gently, then presented O'Hara a chair, taking one herself, with an air of apparent uncon- cern. I was certainly puzzled how to meet this cool introduction at such a moment. I felt weak and nervous from my late illness. The presence, too, of Miss Verschoyle and Eleanor made the prospect of a scene par ticularly embarrassing. While in this un-"], [243, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 231 certainty, which my Aviso saw and evi dently enjoyed, she spoke. \" I have come, Mark, to ask your as sistance in a matter of some importance to me.\" \" I do not see how we can discuss any question in future that is likely to add to our mutual happiness.\" \" I am prepared for a little grandeur arising from your neAvly-fledged honours,\" said Constance, bitterly; \"but really I am not so easily put down. You have a very thriving market town close at hand, where a few concerts can be got up with every prospect of success, especially with the eclat that will arise from the patronage of Sir Mark Irving.\" The coolness with which this proposition Avas made perfectly startled me. O'Hara, too, not Avithout a little aAve of his former mistress, stood Avith the blankest look against the door, awaiting my commands,"], [244, "AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? 232 while a scene ensued which I can fitly describe only by putting it in the dramatic form.

TWO YEARS AFTER. And now for two years I passed a life of constant gloom and depression, such as makes me unhappy to look back upon. The first incident which occupied my attention upon my recovery was the prosecution of the villain who had so un warrantably attacked me. I would wil lingly have set the fellow free, but the affair made a stir in the neighbourhood, and the whole case had been raked up by the local papers, and every incident of my past life had been blended Avith the state ment, and the prosecution was urged upon me so much by my neighbours that I found it almost impossible to stand aloof."], [253, "AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? 241 The evidence, as I expected, proved that the fellow had been in the employ of Michael Cregan, who had emigrated when he found that he was likely to become implicated. This ended, I had set to work at first Avith some spirit to improve the property. I had been ably seconded by O'Hara, but the most vigorous nature will sink into apathy if there be no object in view. For me, when the thing was done the interest had gone. There was no bright face to welcome me at home, no society to interest me abroad. Cary, the only friend in whom I could feel any interest, came occasion ally, and I was cheered for the time, but the dead weight of my gloom was too much ultimately for his more buoyant temperament, and I could generally, not withstanding the kindness of his nature, detect a certain lightness of heart when the time came for his departure.

This I could not wonder at, for had it been otherAvise I should only have made the poor girl unhappy and her position equivocal. Much as Aunt Mary loved me, she knew her duty to Eleanor better than her own mother, and tried her utmost to wean her niece from every thought of me. The morbid self-reproach which fre quently seized me respecting my wife had subsided, partly induced by her own con duct, which became constantly more shame less and defiant of honourable principle. For some months she had contented her- self with drawing heaAy sums from me, which I had readily advanced, being de termined she should have no reasonable cause of complaint against me. This course, howeArer, I was obliged to abandon, for the result was too hu-"], [255, "AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? 243 miliating. At the first check, however, she took measures to revenge herself by annoying me in every possible way. One of her first acts was to give a concert in the market toAvn, two miles distant, at very low prices, the bills of which concert had been liberally posted in every avail able space within sight of Castlehead. EA^en the very trees of the park had been covered with them. At this concert she addressed her audience in a high-flown strain respecting the wrongs and sorrows she had suffered at my hands ; and, as many of the tickets had been distributed gratu itously, there was no lack of applause. It has been said by a wiser man than I am that it is only necessary to throw mud enough and some of it will be sure to stick, and so I found. Too proud to reply to my wife's accusations, I discovered that many of the falsehoods she had circulated were belieAred in the neighbourhood. Amongst r 2"], [256, "244 WHO WAS TO BLAME ? these simple people a person like my Avife, of shoAvy manners and plausible address, could make them believe almost anything. HaATing come to the conclusion that my patience was exhausted, she neglected no opportunity of exciting ill-feeling against me. Some of her modes of annoying me, however, were almost laughable. Upon one occasion I came suddenly, while Avalk ing in a secluded part of the park, upon a merry party of twenty or thirty persons picnicking there. I never made any re strictions as to who visited the grounds, but the troop now assembled was so noisy and ill-behaved that I stepped a little nearer to watch them. It was a very miscellaneous assemblage, evidently chosen without the least regard to respectability or propriety of behaviour. A quantity of rich viands strewed the ground, and the wine was not stinted. In fact, my Avife herself had evidently been drinking freely,"], [257, "WHO WAS TO BLAME ? 245 and, surrounded by a choice party of her own sex, of very doubtful character and appearance, was very noisy and excited. Until lately she had exhibited a slight feel ing of delicacy in keeping her paramour in the background. From the moment, howeArer, that in my oavu defence, and from sheer hopelessness of any change in her, I had made a stand and refused any further supplies of money, all reserve had been thrown aside, and Mr. Softon, bloated, indolent, and sensual as he had become, was her constant companion. Having gone within sight of the party, I was instantly recognised by my wife, Mr. Softon, and some others. \" We will drink our host's health,\" said Mr. Softon, brandishing a tumbler of cham pagne in a mock-defiant attitude and winking at me with a half-drunken leer, which was inexpressibly revolting to me. \"How will you have it, my boys?"], [258, "246 AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? Three times three, with one cheer more,\" continued Softon. \" I propose an amendment,\" said my wife sarcastically. \"I propose Sir Mark Iiwing, and confusion to him.\" By the uproarious applause that followed this speech, and the bumpers drained upon it, I concluded that my wife was the founder of the feast. It mattered little what toast she had proposed, it would have been received with the same welcome so long as a bottle remained to wash it down. I determined not to interfere Avith them, but commissioned O'Hara to watch that no wilful damage was done. The old man I afterwards found had not been quite so forbearing as I intended, for upon coming to the place and finding three or four of the party left sleeping off the effects of their copious libations, he had, AAnth the assistance of a stableman, hastened their recovery by sousing them thoroughly in"], [259, "AVHO AVAS TO BLAME ? 247 the nearest pond, and then sending them off to join their companions. This was the last time I Avitnessed such a scene. Disgusted and sick at heart, I determined I would shut up the place again, and let it relapse into its former desolation, rather than see it desecrated thus and be obliged to take legal measures for the defence of my own property. I therefore frequently absented myself from the place for weeks, upon which the annoyance ceased, and I heard nothing of either my wife, Mr. Softon, or any of the party for a considerable time. How and where I next heard of her shall soon be told. I had accepted Cary's invitation to spend a few days at Oxford with him self and a college friend. While there a strange incident occurred, which may pro bably have been occasioned by an over wrought imagination, but the effect at"], [260, "248 AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? the moment upon my mind was very de- pressing. The shadows of a twilight evening were falling over the magnificent avenue of elms that stretches across the Merton meadows and encloses the broad walk in the rear of Christ Church, and thither Cary was walk ing with me. There were few prome naders besides ourselves, and we Avere unusually silent till Cary said, \" Mind we are not late. We shall hear the hundred and one strokes of the old bell soon.\" \" They still retain old customs, then ?\" I said. \" Old customs agree with a place like Oxford,\" said Cary. \" They do,\" I continued. \" Here every thing breathes of calmness and peace.

We got back to the college"], [262, "250 AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? rooms, where a cheerful fire was burning, and sat down; but whether my morbid mood influenced Cary, or how it was I do not know. Yet for a time we were silent, again broken, however, at length by Cary saying \u2014 \" How extremely moody you are, Mark, looking into the fire as though you could detect some fate in it ! \" \"Fate enough, for that matter,\" I an swered, \" for the flames are not unlike ourselves. They pant, struggle, and leap ever upward, flashing a moment and dying out again, then breaking into a sudden blaze, but in each and every mood while they glitter and flash they also consume.

If ever I should inherit a fortune, I Avill try to enjoy it. Meantime I have accepted my old friend's invitation to this sedate old place, and am trying to make the most of it.\" \"Cary,\" said I, as a sudden resolution passed through my mind, \" do you believe that the dead revisit the earth again ? \" Evidently somewhat taken aback, Cary looked at me with some surprise, but he soon recovered his former light tone, for which I was not ungrateful, feeling sure"], [264, "252 WHO WAS TO BLAME ? that it was as much to cheer me as for his own gratification that it was adopted. \"As to ghosts, that jolly old proser whom Shakespeare has conjured up in Hamlet is almost enough to make one believe something of the sort.

Yet I confess it terri- bly alarmed me until I found out that I had been sold.\" \" Stuff, Cary. I am not speaking of imaginary creations.

It is one of those things that influence us Avhether we will or no, but the moment we attempt to embody it in description, in music, or painting it be comes at once so palpable and real as to be almost laughable, except in rare instances. One would think, considering how general this half belief is, that it must have a germ of truth in it. There have been, without doubt, some very remarkable omens and presentiments, but they may have been but the effect of over-wrought imagi nation.\" ' ' I could relate a strange experience of my own, if you had patience to listen to it,\" I said as calmly as I could."], [266, "WHO WAS TO BLAME? 254 \" Tell me, by all means, my dear fellow.

The ivy-groAvn tower, the shadowy yews, the little green hillocks, tossed up like green waves upon the silent sea of death, stood as palpably before me at the moment as Avhen I visited the churchyard thus celebrated some years since. So agitated did I become that I fancied my brain must have given way, and that the passages of the book, being the latest sane impressions, had become stereotyped, as it were, in my mind and now began to blend with the chaotic ima ginations of a disordered brain. Before I had time to recall my scattered faculties,"], [268, "256 AVHO WAS TO BLAME ? before I had time to unravel the unaccount able transformation of a homely scene, a female figure hurried past the door.

The lane by the side of the river runs parallel with the stream, as you know, and from the cottage door one can see a few hundred yards each way, so that it was quite impossible for the woman to disappear in the time unless she had darted into the house or plunged into the river.

Others, however, were entirely neglected and gave me a despondent feeling as I looked at them. It grieved me to think that my own grave might one day be like one of those disordered tangled hillocks which bespoke no friendly hand, where the long grass and weeds almost hid the little mound, and where no stone marked the name and past condition of its lonely tenant.

Whatever changes take place in the material world \u2014 whatever grand dis coveries or wonderful inventions come to light \u2014 the heart of man, like an island in an everflowing stream, stands changeless and immoveable. We make the old blun- ders ; Ave dream the old dreams ; we wear different costume, eat different food, and dwell in a differently-constructed habita tion, perhaps ; but in all else we are the same perverse unsatisfied creatures, often working so blindly that our feelings are un known even to those who are in most fa miliar contact with us. They are hard to be understood : how much harder, then, to be described ! To whom at this mo- ment can I go and unbosom myself? Of Avhom shall I ask sympathy ? I am con scious of an intention to act rightly, but if I obeyed the first impulse of my heart, hoAV should I be judged by the world ?"], [280, "268 AVHO WA.S TO BLAME ? If I could bear this continued isolation from ties which have ever been so dear to me, the sweet sympathies and consolations of home, I should at least have the appro bation of my OAvn heart. But how often must we yield without repining to the dic tates of an implacable fate, and suffer Avithout even a cry from the heart to those who are most likely to be induced to aid us ! Words can hardly describe the insa tiable longing, the weary disappointed list less step Avith which I once more sought Castlehead ; and when there I shut myself up in the most retired room in the house, indifferent to all, and feeling all indifferent to me.

Besides, even here, while I tell these incidents of my past life, I am conscious of failing to im part to the reader the substance of my best and purest desires. So frequently do fleeting glimpses come to us of aims and impulses which if carried out would sweeten the whole course of our lives ; yet how often these better feelings are turned aside into another channel, through worldly influences, through the difficulty of obtain ing even a momentary belief in some of our most unselfish and unworldly desires ! So true is it that men will stand aloof from all sympathy Avith acknowledged feelings in others which they are acutely influenced by themselves. We will not take on trust from others what we know to be true in ourselves, and in our mutual want of con fidence God knows how much harder we make the world to each other."], [282, "270 CHAPTER XXII. TWO OF A TRADE CAN NEVER AGREE. I went back saddened to Castlehead again, to find my little territory under the influence of a social revolution. The chiefs of this state of things were Mr. Creakle and O'Hara, and both came to me in a very excited state to discuss their grievances. It appeared that Mr. Creakle, who, in re turn for his services, had been appointed to some kind of office which was almost a sinecure, sighed for greater power and in fluence, and soon became inordinately jealous of my old retainer, O'Hara, and conceived the idea of supplanting him. Of course, as soon as O'Hara discovered"], [283, "WHO WAS TO BLAME? 271 his rival's intentions, Irishman like, he got into a violent passion, and requested Mr. Creakle to \" come and fight it out like a man.\" Mr. Creakle, however, was far too great a philosopher to become heated in argument, and concluded upon putting doAvn his antagonist by his supe rior logic. Discussions upon educational questions have been so frequent of late years that one would suppose all novelty had evapo rated from such a theme. Not so, how ever, thought Messrs. Creakle and O'Hara, who entertained me with sundry views upon this subject which have perhaps escaped the select committee of the House of Commons, in spite of all the acute reasoning bestowed upon the theme by that influential body. \" If my distinguished patron, Sir Mark, will allow me,\" began Mr. Creakle, \" I believe I shall be able to point out some"], [284, "272 WHO WAS TO BLAME ? imperfections in the system pursued by my amiable colleague, Mr. O'Hara. Who knows but that some mute inglorious Milton may be concealed in the bosom of one of these rustic youths ? and I fear my dear friend O'Hara is not competent to develope any latent genius of the kind.\" \" By the powers,\" said O'Hara bitterly, \" it would be a wise man to develope the latent genius of Mr. Creakle.\" \" Of my oavu talents I do not speak,\" said Mr. Creakle mildly ; \" but the forma tion of youthful character has ever been the object of my most ardent dreams.

Think of the temptations of the poor \u2014 think of the literature that comes readiest, by its price and form of publica tion, to the factory hand and the mechanic.

The Irishman's rough-and-ready mode of instilling the rudiments soon distanced in popularity the high-flown system of his rival, and Mr. Creakle in a month found himself Avithout a single pupil. To console himself, and gratify his vanity, he set to work to compile a guide-book to Castlehead, which I believe had a magnifi cent sale of ten copies.
