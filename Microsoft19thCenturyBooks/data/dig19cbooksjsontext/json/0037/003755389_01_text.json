PROLOGUE. \" Out of that narrow thoroughfare of right, Around which orb the stars, one starlit night My soul, as if obeying some command, Went wildly wandering in an unknown land.' Eleanor Monroe sat alone in the darkness, thinking. She had reached a crisis in her life. It might have been dimly foreseen, no doubt, three years ago, when she first faced the world on her own account, but now it was there \u2014 no longer in the distance, no longer merely a possibility, but an almost overwhelming reality \u2014 and if anything were to be done, it must be done speedily. Things could no more go on in the old way ; the limit had been touched. She had drawn the solitary armchair the room v,"], [14, "2 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. could boast close up to the little fire, and with her feet on the fender and her hands clasped in her lap, she lay thinking over the past, her head resting against the red woollen antimacassar which adorned the back of the horsehair chair. She thought of herself as a child sitting in a pretty, faded little room, with the blinds down, and with a rough, but kindly, maid-of-all-work opening the door with elaborate caution from time to time and asking in a high-pitched whisper, \" How do you find yourself, Miss Eleanor ? Now, don't cry, there's a dear. They're better off, you know.\" After which she would retire with an audible sob and her apron to her eyes, leaving the lonely child still sitting on the little couch with its delicate cretonne, which had lost its freshness, and the lace and ribbon antimacassars which looked tumbled and soiled. Eleanor remembered that the kind-hearted maid of-all-work and the doctor and the charwoman, who came in to assist with the last sad offices to the dead, had all thought her strange and unnatural \u2014 \" Not a child as I should like to have,\" the char woman had openly remarked \u2014 because she had sat there in such stony silence, neither weeping nor making demands upon anyone's sympathy, although her father and mother lay in the room above dead of a malignant disease, which had"], [15, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN 3 stricken them down within a few hours of one another. She remembered, too, how little their opinion or their averted looks had troubled her, while she sat gazing with unseeing eyes out into the darkened room, her brain capable of but one thought\u2014 that the father she had worshipped, the proud, reserved man who had shown more of his real nature to his little daughter than to anyone else in the world, was lost to her for ever. That the pretty, foolish mother, who had fondled her at times and neglected her at others, would never take her in her arms again \u2014 never complain in her pettish, childish way that her skin was so dark and her hair so black, so different from her own pink and-white fairness, and so unsuited to the fripperies with which she would have liked to adorn her. And with this one thought beating in on her brain and her heart lying like a stone in her breast, they \u2014 -the commonplace, kindly men and women \u2014 had called her unfeeling, because she had not cried ! Eleanor smiled a little even now when she thought of it. Then she remembered the day when the slow, measured tramp down the stairs and the heavy, black-robed burdens borne aloft on the men's shoulders, had brought home to her, with a sudden, swift realization, the fact that it was all true, not a dreadful dream, as she had sometimes thought, and B \u2014 2"], [16, "4 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. that this was the end. How she had sprung up and rushing out into the little hall had stopped the men who bore the larger burden, and with a wild cry of \" Papa ! papa ! \" had tried to seize the heavy fringe that hung from the funeral pall, but, instead, falling down under the feet of the bearers, a little black figure with a white, deathlike face, was carried back senseless into the room. When, some hours later, she recovered con sciousness, a lady, who told her that she was her father's sister, but who bore no resemblance to that beloved face, was sitting by her side. She evi dently strongly disapproved of her having been so long unconscious of her presence, and remarked that she hoped she was now sufficiently recovered to listen to what she had to say, as her time was valuable. She had then gone on to state that she was prepared, out of the goodness of her heart \u2014 for she did not recognise any tie of relationship, her father having forfeited any claim on his family by marrying beneath him \u2014 to charge herself with her support and education for the next six years, that is, until she was seventeen years of age, by which time she would be in a position to earn her own ''ving. She had founded an Orphanage for the re ception of twelve destitute children of gentle birth and as, at the present time, there was a vacancy among these small favourites of fortune \u2014 who"], [17, "5 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. were brought up on strictly Presbyterian principles and with whom infinite pains were taken to make the world appear as joyless a place as possible \u2014 she should be elected a member of the happy band. Eleanor could not yet think of those six years without a shudder. Of the dreary life and the yet more dreary orphans, with whom, as a rule, the system of education pursued produced most satis factory results, crushing out all youthful brightness and exuberance, and encouraging dulness and apathy, or deceit and hypocrisy. If she had escaped more lightly than her companions, it was because she had once known something better, and, as it was, more harm had been done her than she fterself was aware. On her seventeenth birthday she had an inter view with her aunt, when she was informed that a situation had been found for her in a small, highly select scholastic establishment, where, in return for some instruction to the junior pupils, she would receive finishing lessons in various accomplish ments, which would fit her, later on, to take a better position. There she remained four years. It was a dull, hard life, but it was a relief to the Orphanage. The aristocratic pupils treated her with indifference or scarcely concealed contempt ; they might have been more amiable had she shown"], [18, "6 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. herself more conciliating, but her spirit was as haughty as theirs, so her life was a more or less isolated one, destitute of love or sympathy, and only her interest in her studies and her craving for knowledge kept her from despair. The masters lauded her as one of their most promising pupils, and in her favourite pursuits, at least, she had no rivals. Then the day came when the cramped, loveless life weighed upon her beyond longer endurance, and having matured the plans she had been form ing for some time, she gave notice to Lave. When the news of this insubordination reached her aunt's ears, that lady wrote to say that she \" washed her hands \" of her. With a nature that could show such black ingratitude, she shuddered to have any farther communication. At the same time, being strictly honest, she enclosed Eleanor a cheque for which was all her parents had left behind them, and expressed a pious, though not very hopeful, wish, that she might not meet with the punishment she deserved. Eleanor remembered with what a thrill of delight, in which there was not a touch of doubt or fear she had gone out alone into the world. How, with much inward satisfaction, though with a judicial outward calm, she had settled down in her present abode \u2014 a bed and sitting-room combined in Hart"], [19, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 7 Street, Finsbury Park \u2014 and set to work to put her scheme into execution. She would give lessons in music and singing, or anything else, for so many hours, and the rest of the day she would \u2014 write ! Yes, that was the grand idea, the pivot on which everything else had turned. Her masters had praised her composition ; she herself was conscious of the power to express fluently and easily much of what she thought and felt \u2014 why should she not make a name for herself as others had done ? So she advertised for pupils, and went through the daily drudgery \u2014 drudgery to her, for she had no taste for teaching \u2014 with scrupulous honesty, secur ing herself thereby a certain small sum weekly, and flying, like a bird released from its cage, to her beloved manuscript as soon as she was free ; writing often far into the night, scarcely feeling the need of rest or food. And it had all been of no use. It had all ended in this. Gradually her literary work had absorbed more and more of her time, becoming a passion, than which none is stronger ; old pupils had dropped off, and she had not cared to look for new ones. She had had several short stories accepted by different magazines, and this had encouraged her to hope and work on, and about six months ago she had settled down to write a novel, her first long work. This had taken up nearly all her time,"], [20, "8 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. and she had been willing that it should, unhesi tatingly making use of what was left of the \u2014 it had been reduced by various emergencies \u2014 to allow herself free play. \" I will give myself this one chance,\" she had said. \" If there is anything in me, it will come out in this book, and I shall get my feet on the first rung ofthe ladder, at least. If there is nothing \u2014 well, I shall not have any cause of complaint, I shall have had my chance. And \u2014 and,\" with a little laugh, \" though I could not face a course of slow starvation, I could face \u2014 Waterloo Bridge.\" She was tired of waiting, tired of her colourless life, and she thought herself strong enough to risk everything upon one throw, and to abide by the result. A fortnight ago her book was completed, and she had sent it to a well-known London publisher, a man highly respected in the literary world, saying she would call in two weeks' time to learn the result. And to-day she had gone up. She had been accorded an interview by the courteous prin cipal, who informed her, as she sat down before him \u2014 calm and composed now the fateful moment had arrived, though she had scarcely slept the previous night, and had made the journey to town almost in a dream \u2014 that, though it was not his"], [21, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 9 habit to see authors who were unknown to him, he had made an exception in her favour, as he had been unusually interested in her work. Those words had made her heart beat high with hope, but it was suddenly chilled when he went on to remark that although, undoubtedly, the story showed great promise, it was crude and disappointing in parts, as was natural in a first attempt, and he regretted that he must decline to undertake its publication. W'hat he should advise was, that she should put it on one side and start something else ; in a second story she could remedy the faults he had pointed out in the first, and he would be happy to consider it when finished. Eleanor had been thankful for the veil that covered her face, for the room swam round her for a moment, and the great man's voice sounded far off; then with all the force of her strong will she steadied herself and asked whether he thought any other publisher would be likely to consider her story more favourably than he had done ? He was afraid not, he had replied ; an author had usually great difficulty in getting a first work accepted. The public taste was so capricious, and publishers, naturally enough, did not care about running un necessary risks. As a matter of fact, though he never recommended such a course, many authors paid for the publication of their first work them-"], [22, "10 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. selves. It was often the only way of bringing their name before the public. Would it be worth her while, she had asked again, supposing she had the means, to do the same ; to bring out her story herself? It might be, he had replied ; the story was an uncommon one, undoubtedly, and contained some really powerful scenes. If it happened to hit the public fancy, it would very likely be a great success. In his capacity, unfortunately, he added with a shrug of the shoulders, he had been obliged to consider the other side as well. Then she rose from her chair, and thanking him for his kindness, took up the rejected manuscript and left the room. Of what use to linger ? There was nothing more to say. This man's honesty and judgment stood above reproach, she knew; she was content to accept his decision as final. She would not go that wearying round from publisher to publisher, only to be told the same story. If she had had the money she would have launched her book herself, conscious, as no one else could be, of all she had put into it \u2014 of her own life and soul that breathed from its pages, and trusting that what was so strongly and simply human might touch an answer ing chord in the world at large. But that was out of the question. Only \u00a35 stood between her and \u2014 What?"], [23, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 11 She sat trying to pierce the shadows that seemed gathering closer round her ; trying to picture her self as cold and lifeless, as having done with the world \u2014 she, through whose veins the blood rushed swift and strong ; she, who had never known what it was to live. It was hard to step out of the twilight into the darkness without ever having known the beauty and warmth of the noonday. \" If I had only lived,\" she murmured to herself, \" if I had only lived for a year, for one month even, I should not mind so much ! But I never have. It has been the barest existence to me always. Why should I seek to prolong it ? Let it go. And yet it is hard lines \u2014 it is hard lines.\" She told herself that if her manuscript had been unhesitatingly condemned and treated as of no account, she could have put it on one side without a murmur. But to be told that it held within it a possibility of success \u2014 of 'great success,' had he ot said ? \u2014 and not to be able to give it the chance, to place it before the British public and let it stand the test, that was more than she could suffer with patience. \" I think,\" she said to herself with a little harsh laugh, \" I think that if the Devil were to come to me now, as he came sometimes to people in the old legends, and were to offer me success and honour in exchange for my immortal"], [24, "12 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. soul, I am afraid \u2014 I am really afraid I should close the bargain !

But I cannot settle anything to-night, my head feels so strange. I must sleep a little first.\" She staggered to her feet, holding on to the mantelpiece, for she was faint and exhausted from over-excitement and want of food, and as she stood there steadying herself a moment, she heard the hall-door open and steps coming up the stairs. She listened mechanically, as we often in moments of intense excitement listen to trivial things. \"It is old Mr. Hunt,\" she thought ; \" he is late,\" peering at the clock and seeing that it was close on eleven. \" He has been out collecting his rents, I suppose.\" He was the only other lodger in the house beside herself, and her landlady had sometimes regaled her with stories of his wealth and meanness. He owned various streets of small houses in the neigh bourhood, and was in the habit of collecting his own rents and, where he could basely do so, of making himself as objectionable to his unfortunate tenants as possible. It was the first of the month and Eleanor guessed his errand correctly enough. She heard him pass her door and go into his bed room, which was next her own. No one else slept"], [26, "14 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. on this landing ; Mrs. Smith, the landlady, occupy ing a room on the ground floor. \" To think,\" she mused to herself vaguely, \"that he should have so much while I have nothing.

And if I were rich and famous I would remember the unlucky ones ; I would strive to do a little good in the world. Supposing, just suppos ing \" she went on after a few moments, the pupils of her eyes dilating, \" that he had lost that little black bag of his to-night \u2014 I know he had it with him for I heard him put it down on a chair just now \u2014 and I had found it, should I have thought it wrong, knowing to whom it belonged, to keep the contents ? I think not ; I really think not.\" She seemed to be weighing the matter calmly and judicially. \" I should not care to take it for anything but my book, but I should hold myself justified for that. If it brought me success I would repay him ; if not, I should have no remorse on his account. He has stamped all that is human out of him, he has no claim to be treated as a fellow-creature. He is a machine for collecting gold, that is all ; for his idol he would commit any meanness, inflict any misery in his power. It would be but justice if"], [27, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 15 some trouble came upon him in return. Why should he go free while others are tried and tortured beyond endurance ? \" A sudden unreasoning hatred filled her heart against him, as she stood there gazing down into the dying fire. Presently, scarcely conscious of what she was doing, moving mechanically, like one in a dream, she went slowly towards the door. A few words she had heard flashed through her brain, standing out, as it were, in letters of fire, and changed pas sive resentment into sudden action. \" He keeps the key of his safe under his pillow at night,\" her landlady had said at the con clusion of one of her stories \u2014 \" under his pillow.\" Eleanor was no longer capable of reasoning or thinking. Physically and mentally exhausted, she had arrived at the stage when despair and misery make most things possible. \" It is my life against a little of his gold,\" she murmured to herself. \" Why should I hesitate ? \" Softly turning the handle, she stood a moment in the dark passage outside, listening. There was no sound in the house, but as she stood there a clock in a room below faintly struck the hour of mid night."], [28, "16 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. Rousing herself at the sound, she turned towards the closed door at the end of the passage, and stooping down, listened intently. She could hear the sound of steady breathing inside and knew that the old man must be asleep, exhausted probably by his long tramp. Noiselessly turning the handle she went in. A night-light was burning dimly and she saw the faint outline of the bed and the safe standing on a table at the side. He had no doubt emptied the contents of the black bag into it before undressing. She congratulated herself on having struck on such a favourable opportunity. Moving closer to the bed, she stood looking down a moment at the quiet sleeper. Little fear of his awaking, he was sleeping so soundly. Slipping her hand gently under his pillow, she touched the key almost at once, and drew it out. She inserted it in the lock of the safe and it turned noiselessly, the little door swinging slowly back. Three canvas bags stood on the upper shelf. She untied the string round the neck of one and saw the gleam of gold. She did the same with the two others, for she did not want to make any mistake, and saw that the contents were the same. As far as she could guess from that casual glance, each bag contained between \u00a34.0 and That was enough for her purpose. She took the bags out and"], [29, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 17 laid them on the table, and locking the safe turned to replace the key under the pillow. But she started back with a low, gasping cry. The old man was lying with his eyes wide open, looking at her. He had evidently only just woke up, and on his face was an expression of bewildered rage and fear and horror. In another moment he would recover his senses and call for help. Powerless to move, powerless to do anything but gaze back into those fierce, hungry eyes, she stood there \u2014 waiting. In another moment he drew himself up in bed, stretched a long skinny hand out towards her \u2014 she never forgot the sight of that long, lean, yellow hand, with the claw-like nails, the fingers curved ready to clutch her arm \u2014 and his lips moved. Waiting for the cry that she knew was coming \u2014 the cry that should rouse the house, she stood there, making no effort to escape. Then, while yet his lips were open to call for help, while his fierce accusing eyes still held her, suddenly, with awful swiftness, a change came over his face. For an instant he threw up his head, gasping for breath, then he fell back on the pillows \u2014 a dead man. Not realising at first what had happened, what that shapeless, huddled mass in the bed meant, still listening for the cry for help, Eleanor stood there, stricken into a passive, stony composure. Then c"], [30, "18 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. as he neither spoke nor moved, it flashed upon her what it had all meant \u2014 that grey, awful change, the fierce struggle for breath, the sudden silence, before which she unconsciously trembled \u2014 flashed upon her that she was saved, and saved as by a miracle. The blood rushed back to her heart, and she drew a deep breath. Feeling the key still clutched between her fingers, she threw it down on the table and snatching up the money that was put ready, she turned and fled, without a backward glance. She reached her own room and mechanically closed and locked the door behind her, and still with the same noiseless, dreamlike movements, put the money away in a place of safety. Then care fully replenishing the fire, she wrapped a thick shawl round her head and shoulders and threw herself down on the hearth-rug ; crouching close up to the fender, as though she could not have warmth enough. At first she shuddered convulsively now and again from head to foot, but this gradually passed away and she fell into a heavy sleep."], [31, "'9 CHAPTER I. \" Who calleth thee, Heart ?

I am horribly nervous, though, perhaps, you are not aware of it.\" \" Well, I should scarcely have said it was one of your failings,\" he said, looking at her kindly and even a little tenderly as she faced him from the opposite side of the table. His eyes lingered unconsciously on the pic turesque head with its waving brown hair, which in the sun was more gold than brown ; on the fair smiling face, glowing with life and health, which if not strictly beautiful, was young, and fresh, and sweet ; on the soignee toilet ; on the pretty dimpled hands lying clasped on the table. His eyes lingered a moment restfully on all these, because he had a keen sense of such things, because he was a beauty-lover at heart, though he had elected to take up his abode in a poor London parish, where he was surrounded by all that was"], [33, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 21 commonplace and unlovely ; by much that was even hideous and vile. And he had never repented his voluntary exile, never once looked back with a sigh at the fair path in which he might have walked, though, being only human, it sometimes happened that when, as now, surrounded by all the signs of wealth and refined taste and tete-a-tete with Madge Harvey, his starved artistic sense would assert itself, and he unconsciously paid tribute to the beauty of purple and fine linen. A man, very human, and so knowing how to reach the weak, erring hearts among which he lived ; a man with an infinite patience and pity for the errors of others, but whose own ideal was set in the clouds. A hard taskmaster to himself. Madge, conscious of that lingering look and the softened light in his eyes, but misinterpreting it a little, felt her own colour rise, and rushed hastily into conversation. \" I wonder,\" she said, \" I wonder whether Miss Monroe would come to the rescue ? It has just occurred to me that she might.\" \" Miss Monroe ? \" he queried. \" Yes. But of course you don't know about her. I have not had time to tell you all our adventures yet.

I saw the tears running down auntie's cheeks, and she told me afterwards that it had made her think of ' John.' \" Adrian smiled.

Though he had little time for reading, for novel reading especially \u2014 not that he was above enjoying a good novel, but simply because his duties and occupation put more serious literature first \u2014 he had managed to make himself acquainted with \" Reaping the Whirlwind.\" His attention had first been drawn to it by Madge Harvey, who in her enthu siasm had insisted upon lending it him to read, and though he had taken it up rather carelessly, he was soon deeply interested. The book had, immediately on its appearance, taken the public heart by storm ; principally, no doubt, by reason of its vivid word-painting, of its keenly human interests, which overshadowed, to any but the critical eye, what was crude or faulty in construction. But Adrian Walmesley, whose life had accustomed him to looking below the surface, found something more in the book than was patent to most of its admirers. When, late one night, he had laid it down on the table in the Vicarage study at the end of the last chapter, he had said to him self: \" The woman who wrote that must have had some singular experiences, or possess a singular nature. There is something more than imagination at work here, however great. She would be an interesting woman to know, I should think.\""], [39, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 27 And to-night he was to meet her. He was round early at the school-room, lighting the gas, arranging the benches, putting a few plants and flowers \u2014 from the conservatory at Porchester Terrace \u2014 about on the platform to give the place as cheerful an air as possible ; the old clerk, who had been attached to St. Jude's long before Adrian Walmesley made his appearance in the world, pottering after him and giving feeble assistance from time to time. The programmes, neatly printed on green paper, were distributed gratis among the occu pants of the penny benches, but were charged for at the rate of twopence to the more aristocratic owners of the sixpenny chairs. Adrian held one in his hand as he stood for a moment resting after his labours. \" She has made an excellent choice,\" he said to himself, stopping at Miss Monroe's name. \" Poor people can appreciate good music if it is simple enough. It is of no use to treat them to drawing room love-songs and Italian bravuras, which they don't understand. She knows something about them, I should fancy.\" It was half-past seven now, and the old clerk stood ready at the door to take the money, for though the entertainment did not begin before eight o'clock, the occupants of the benches were wont to arrive early and with a great deal of unnecessary"], [40, "28 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. noise and shuffling, as though their boots were a good many sizes too large for them. Adrian went round to the little room at the side of the platform, and opening the door, looked down the road to see whether any of his performers were on their way. H e had stood there a few minutes when he saw Madge Harvey and her aunt, accompanied by another lady. As they came up, he moved on one side for them to enter. \" I hope we are not late, Adrian,\" Madge exclaimed rather breathlessly. \" I told the cab man to put us down at the corner as usual, but I suppose he must have misunderstood me, for when we had all tumbled out and he had driven away, I found myself stranded. However, a nice little boy> who is patronising to-night's performance, took us under his care, and \u2014 nous voila.\" \" There is plenty of time,\" Adrian said, as he shook hands. \" It is only a quarter to eight, so you may sit down and recover your breath.\" \" Mr. Walmesley \u2014 Miss Monroe,\" said Miss Masson rather hastily, awakening to the knowledge that the burden of introduction lay upon her. \" I have been telling Miss Monroe, Adrian, how grateful we all are to her for coming to our assistance.\" \"Very grateful indeed,\" said Adrian, holding out his hand with a smile. \" Frankly, it is more"], [41, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 29 than I expected. When Madge first mentioned it I was almost overwhelmed by the boldness of the suggestion.\" \" Am I supposed to be such a terrible personage, then ? \" she asked with a little laugh. \" I don't know about that, but we are very humble down here and not accustomed to celebrities.\" \" A very poor celebrity, I am afraid,\" she said, and he thought a faint shadow crossed her face. So this was she. A tall, stately woman \u2014 a girl, perhaps, in point of years, but somehow that word seemed out of place for her, there was so little that was girlish about her \u2014 simply dressed in black lace, just open at the throat and caught there with a spray of white roses. Her figure was noble and statuesque, but it was the face that rivetted Adrian's attention ; it was so calm and cold and repressed. He caught himself wondering how it would look if those dark eyes woke up \u2014 those large, heavily-lashed eyes, which seemed now almost expressionless, as though their owner dropped a veil between them and the outside world \u2014 and a flush of excitement leapt into the pale cheeks. It was a face that in repose, to the casual observer, would be scarcely attractive, but which held in it many possibilities. On her side, looking at this man with a little more"], [42, "30 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. interest than she generally felt in strangers, for Madge had been busy singing his praises, she saw a tall, muscular figure and a stern, powerful face, capable though of softening into almost womanly tenderness at the sight of human suffering, as his poor parishioners knew. His smile was a revela tion in itself, not only softening the mouth, but shining out of the depth of the eyes, as though it came from the heart, which it did. If it came less frequently than smiles come with men to whom life is an easy thing, it meant more than it did with them. At Oxford, before he had any thought of following his present sacred profession, Adrian had been a noted athlete, and his strength often stood him in good stead now, when brutality had to be met by brute force, or when the mere knowledge that it was there held the passions of lawless men in check. His sympathies were not of the hysterical order ; he had no pity for the wife-beater or the oppressor ofthe weak ; he would have cheer fully given all such over to the punishment they richly deserved, though afterwards he would have done his best to lead them to better things. A man, the nobility of whose nature, the pureness of whose life was stamped on his face, and whose presence gave Eleanor Monroe a faint sense of discomfort, which she could not have explained, but of which she was vaguely conscious."], [43, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 31 It was eight o'clock, and the entertainment had been opened by a duet, the overture from Zampa, which had been vigorously rendered by two young lady performers. Then a comic song followed, by the comic man who had been a standing dish at St. Jude's since the commencement of the Penny Readings, but who was condescendingly tolerated by the audience on account of his long service and the evident enjoyment he took in his own perform ance. Then it was Eleanor Monroe's turn. Madge Harvey played her accompaniment, and she held a slip of paper in her hand with the words of the song, but she did not seem to need it. Her voice was a full, melting contralto, and Adrian Walmesley listened almost breathlessly, giving himself up to the unwonted enjoyment, for the moment forgetful of his surroundings and of the fact that the group of rough boys in one corner of the room needed constant supervision, all the elements for a \" row \" being held in readiness by them. But perhaps that sweet, pathetic voice touched something in them too, for a deathlike stillness reigned in the room until the last note had died away, and then a storm of applause broke forth ; applause that would not he stilled until Eleanor rose to sing again. This time she held no words in her hand ; she faced her audience and sang them the song which"], [44, "32 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. never fails to reach the hearts of men and women the whole world over, the song which perhaps has caused more heart-aches and brought more unshed tears to the eyes than 'any other that ever was written \u2014 \" Home, Sweet Home.\" Sung, as she sang it, it seemed, surely, the saddest thing in the world, so fraught with pain and longing that one understood it could only have been written by a wanderer on the face of the earth. \" What an unhappy life she must have had !\" Adrian Walmesley thought to himself involuntarily. \" That voice and that pathos don't match with the strong, cold face. What has taught her such calm ness and self-repression at her age ?\" But the audience, less critical and observant, were only conscious of unreasoning delight. If eyes were wiped surreptitiously and voices were a little husky, well, as Madge had said, it did not lessen the enjoyment. \" Parson's got a oner this time ; hope she'll come again,\" was one audible remark, and this fairly expressed the general feeling. \" You were an immense success, dear,\" Madge said, as they adjourned to put on their wraps after \" God save the Queen,\" had cleared the room. \" You have been a real Samaritan. You gave those poor people a treat they don't often have.\""], [45, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 33 \" And on their behalf and my own, I hope you will accept my warmest thanks,\" Adrian said, coming in when the exit was over. \" As Madge said, you gave us a treat we do not often get.\" \" You must ask me to come again, then,\" Eleanor replied, her face growing brighter. \" I don't do much good in the world, I am afraid, and I should like to help a little if I can. n Then they drove away, and Adrian stood a moment, bareheaded and lost in thought, gazing after the disappearing four-wheeler. i>"], [46, "34 CHAPTER II. \" Looking within myself, I note how thin A plank of station, chance, or prosperous fate, Doth fence me from the clutching waves of sm ; In my own heart I find the worst man's mate, And see not dimly the smooth-hinged gate That opes to those abysses Where ye grope darkly \u2014 ye who never knew On your young hearts love's consecrating dew, Or felt a mother's kisses, Or home's restraining tendrils round you curled ; Ah, side by side with heart's-ease in this world The fatal nightshade grows and bitter rue ! \" Adrian had met Eleanor Monroe once or twice at Porchester Terrace since the night of the Penny Reading and she had sung for him again and his interest in her had deepened, though he had"], [47, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 35 scarcely grown more intimate with her, for she held him rather aloof than otherwise, when one night he went into the West End to hear an address by a well-known lecturer at the Kensington Town Hall, and as he passed through the barrier, he saw her sitting in front with a lady. He impulsively turned back and changed his seat for a more expensive one near her. \" Good evening, Miss Monroe,\" he said, holding out his hand. \" I should scarcely have expected to see you here.\" She looked up with a start and a faint blush. \" And yet I am very partial to a good lecture,\" she replied, \" and as this was an off night with us, Mrs. Foster and I thought we would come round.\" And she introduced Adrian to her companion, whom he at once recognised from Madge's description. \" May I sit here ? \" he asked when they had been conversing a few moments, indicating the vacant seat at her side. \" Certainly,\" she replied, with a little touch of embarrassment, which seemed strange in one usually so self-possessed, making room for him beside her. \" I expect to hear something interesting to-night,\" he said, noting her embarrassment and hoping she had not thought him presumptuous.

The subject has a peculiar attraction for me, living where I do, among people who, I am afraid, are half of them criminals in one form or another, or, at least, pre disposed to be so.\" \" It interests me too,\" she said in her usual tone. \" It opens such a wide field for speculation. I happened to read something under the same head ing \u2014 ' Criminal Anthropology ' \u2014 in one of the papers a few days ago, and when I saw the announcement of a lecture here on the same topic, I made up my mind to come.\" \" You have studied the subject ? \" \" Very little. I am afraid it interests me particularly because there is so much ' copy ' in it. You know a novel must be more than merely amusing nowadays : it must be analytical, meta physical, or something of that sort to catch the public fancy. I am afraid literary work, like acting, has a tendency to make one curiously hard and un feeling, in a passive, contemplative way. I find myself looking at most things \u2014 at joy and suffering and sorrow \u2014 from a business point of view, and saying to myself\u2014' There that is how you must treat such^and such a subject next time.' I once heard an actress say she had this feeling too : that often, unconsciously, she made a study of people's"], [49, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 37 actions at certain crises even when she wished only to be full of sympathy for them.\" Adrian listened with interest, glad that she had at last thrown off a little of her reserve with him. ; \" I can understand the feeling,\" he said, \" and it is a natural one up to a certain point ; of course the danger would be in letting it go too far. But as regards this subject \u2014 what is your personal opinion respecting it ? \" \" I think I can hardly lay claim to a personal opinion, but I agree with the statement I read the other day that ' Every student of criminal anthropology must have before him the three great factors \u2014 first, the heredity of the criminal ; secondly, the actual brain with its reactive and resistive qualities in each case ; and third, its environment, with its permanent and immediate effects. The brain cortex must be regarded as the vehicle of the goodness of the saint and the badness of the criminal.' \" \" Of course you know that there are some learned men who hold that you can draw no hard and fast line between the criminal and non-criminal classes ; that we may, anyone of us, given the necessary temptation and surroundings, go to swell the criminal list ? \" He spoke with a half-smile, but she answered gravely enough :"], [50, "38 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. \" Yes, I have heard that, and I think there is a very great deal of truth in it. That is why, if there were an eleventh commandment, I think it should be \u2014 ' Judge not, that ye be not judged.' \" He was silent a few minutes, surprised at her serious tone, and when he would have spoken again, the lecturer had made his appearance on the plat form, and there was no opportunity for further con versation. After it was over they made their way out together, standing for a moment at the entrance to the Hall before saying good-bye. \" Shall I call a hansom for you ? \" Adrian asked, \" or would you rather walk ? It is a beautiful night, and if you would allow me, I should be happy to see you safely home.\" \" Thank you, I should enjoy a walk, but I don't like taking you so far out of your way,\" Eleanor demurred. \" I am sure we could manage alone.\" Adrian succeeded, however, in disposing of her objections without much difficulty, and they set off together. It was a bright October night, and the fresh, keen air was a welcome change after the close atmosphere of the Hall. Eleanor felt her spirits rise and chattered and laughed so gaily that Adrian caught the infection, and not only enjoyed her crisp criticisms on things in general and her spark-"], [51, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 39 ling little witticisms, but encouraged her to go on by taking part in them. Life, in spite of his faith and courage, was a little hard for him sometimes, and had made him perhaps graver and sterner than a man should be at thirty years of age, but at heart he was fresh and young enough, and it only needed a sympathetic touch to call forth the bright side. To two of the three, at least, it seemed but a few minutes' walk to Pelham Gardens, though as a matter of fact it had taken more than half-an-hour, and when they arrived at their destination they were talking and laughing together like old friends. \" You must come in for five minutes' rest,\" Eleanor said. \" It is quite early still, not eleven o'clock.\" And Adrian after a faint demur followed her willingly enough up the little flight of steps into the hall. It was a pretty little house, inexpensively but daintily furnished, with no Art (!) fads in the shape of limp draperies and silk rags wound round every available article, but with plenty of womanly pretti ness in it, nevertheless. When Eleanor's book proved such a brilliant success, she found herself, after a few months, in possession of a considerable sum of money, and"], [52, "40 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. with commissions for various stories which it only remained for her to turn into handsome cheques. After careful deliberation she felt herself justified in choosing a habitation, and her choice once made, lost no time in having it put ready for her reception, remaining at the lodgings she was occupying at Bloomsbury until it was in order. She advertised for a housekeeper-companion, and selected Mrs. Foster for the post, as being least likely to interfere with her or make any difference in her life. And then she prepared to settle down and work hard. But mind and body had been tried beyond their strength, and though she exerted all her power of will not to break down, she was so shaken and un hinged, that in the end she had to give up, and taking Mrs. Foster with her, she went away for a few weeks' rest and change to the Black Forest. And it was there she had met Miss Masson and Madge. A tray with some sandwiches and other light refreshments stood on the dining-room table, and Eleanor invited Adrian to sit down with them. \" I am quite hungry after that brisk walk,\" she said, \" and you ought to be too.\" As he took his seat he thought how bright and homelike it all looked. A cheerful fire was burn ing on the tiled hearth, a standard lamp of wrought iron stood in a corner, and threw a"], [53, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 41 subdued red light over the room ; one or two good engravings relieved the dark colouring of the walls, and a large bowl of late autumn flowers was on the table. Adrian saw an escritoire standing in the recess by the window, and guessed that this was Eleanor's study, too, and he pictured to him self how she would sit there writing. Mrs. Foster had taken her knitting to a low chair by the fire, but Eleanor and Adrian still sat at the table talking, though they had drifted on to serious subjects now. Presently he gave a little sigh. \" It is quite time I went away,\" he said, with comic plaintive ness. \" I am afraid I should not dare to give myself many evenings ' out ' \u2014 such evenings as this at all events ; it might make me discontented. I should go back to my poor people expecting to find them ready to discuss the social questions of the day, and be unreasonably disappointed that they could not ! Query : Whether it is better, having once taken up a course of life that shuts out the great world, not to treat oneself to any glimpses into it\u2014 or would that tend to narrow-mindedness and general dulness?\" \" I should say it would,\" said Eleanor with a smile. \" However much one may be devoted to one's work, it is best to get away from it some times \u2014 to get another view of life. You go back all the fresher.\""], [54, "42 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. \"Well, that is good hearing,\" he said, laughing. \" I shall need to be fresh enough to-morrow nights I am going to invade the pet public-house in my parish. The men who keep the place going won't come to me, so I must go to them, and I don't at all flatter myself that they will be glad to see me.\" \" How frivolous you make me feel,\" Eleanor exclaimed. \" My evening will be spent very differently. I am going to Mrs. Trelawny's ' At Home,' and shall dance till my feet ache, or Miss Masson's patience is exhausted. She is to take me under her wing.\" \" I hope you don't think that I disapprove of any innocent pleasures,\" he replied. \" You have everything to make you enjoy life ; it would be a pity if you failed to do so.\" \" And yet -\" she said, dreamily. \" And yet ? \" he repeated, softly, as she did not continue. \" I sometimes wonder whether I do enjoy it. It is not that I lack the will, but,\" meditatively, \" when you have once said to yourself, ' I will enjoy,' perhaps the power to do so has gone. The truest enjoyment is surely unconscious that it is enjoyment; it comes of itself; it has never been thought about or speculated over.\" He made no reply, wondering a little, and hesitating what to say."], [55, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 43 \" But there, I am growing metaphysical,\" she broke off with a laugh, \" and I am keeping you standing all this time. Good-bye ; and I wish you success to-morrow night. How are you going to conquer the enemy ? \" \" With the modern weapon \u2014 Talk,\" he said laughing, and then with another good-night he was gone. She stood a moment thoughtfully, where he had left her. \" If, long ago, I had had such a man to talk to me !\" she said to herself with a faint regret."], [56, "44 CHAPTER III. \" He reads much ; He is a great observer and he looks Quite through the deeds of men .

Her ' At Homes ' were very popular, as they deserved to be, for she not only chose her guests carefully, but she studied their comfort in every way, denying herself even the pleasure of seeing a crush on the staircase, because she reluctantly acknowledged that though such a sight was gratifying to the hostess, the enjoyment, undoubtedly, extended to no one else. So that when Miss Masson arrived with her niece and Eleanor, they could make their way up to her at once."], [57, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 45 \" I have one or two lions here to-night,\" she whispered to Eleanor, with her bright superficial smile, \" but no one so big as you ; so don't go hiding yourself away.\" \" What shall I do then ?\" Eleanor asked, smil ing in return, for she had taken a fancy to the pretty, frivolous, kind-hearted little woman. \" Shall I go about and- roar ? But won't that make the other lions jealous ? And, really, I don't feel that I am big enough to justify any roaring.\" \" Nonsense !

It is a little like ' Dog eating dog,' I think. There ! I am afraid I am very vulgar. Run away.\" \" You may be sure I shall not,\" said Eleanor decidedly. \" I own to a decided partiality for my own sex and a decided suspici a of the tyrant man. We might defy him if only we women would stick to one another.\" \" Bravo, my dear, them's my sentiments ! And now we must be quiet while Herr Wildermann plays, or he'll never come again.\""], [58, "46 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. The first part of the evening was musical, the latter terpsichorean, and it was when the artistes of the higher branch of the profession had con veyed themselves away and their places were being taken by their brethren of a lower grade, who played dance music at so much an hour, that some one came up to Madge Harvey, as she stood talking to Eleanor, and holding out his hand, said gaily : \" This is an unexpected pleasure. I should have come earlier if I had known you were to be here.\" \" I am sure I ought to feel flattered,\" she replied a little coldly, as she looked round, \" and so, no doubt, would Mrs. Trelawny if she heard you.\" He shrugged his shoulders. \" I hope you are going to be very nice to me now I have come,\" he said, \" else I shall wish I had stayed away.\" \" You probably came to please yourself as \", she hesitated a moment. \" As I do most things, you were about to say,\" he said, finishing the sentence for her with a laugh. \" But I am afraid I am interrupting your conversation ; or perhaps you will take pity on me and introduce me and let me stay ?\" \" Mr. Graham \u2014 Miss Monroe,\" said Madge, as it seemed a little reluctantly."], [59, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 47 \" You might have added ' my cousin,' for you know we are related in some degree, and then Miss Monroe would have taken more interest in me,\" he said reproachfully. They laughed. \"Well I will leave you to explain the proper degree of relationship,\" Madge said, as a partner came up to claim her for the first waltz, \" and I hope it will have due weight with her.\" \" May I have the honour of this dance, or are you already engaged ? \" Dudley Graham asked Eleanor, dropping his light, bantering tone and speaking with the graceful courtesy he knew so well how to assume. \" No, I am not engaged,\" she replied, accepting his proffered arm and feeling a little glad she was not, for this man with his distinguished bearing and handsome, high-bred face \u2014 a little weary, a little cynical, perhaps, but not the less likely, with her short experience of the world, to touch her fancy on that account \u2014 interested her somewhat, and she was not disinclined to know more of him. Dudley Graham waltzed, as he did the few things he deigned to undertake \u2014 perfectly ; and though Eleanor, with her limited practice, was not nearly his equal, her performance was good enough not to interfere with his. If it had, he would probably have made some excuse to leave off."], [60, "48 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. \" You are fond of dancing ? \" he said, glancing at her through his long eyelashes and noticing her flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes. They were so thickly shaded and looked so sleepy as a rule, that few people knew how keen Dudley Graham's steel-grey eyes really were ; very little escaped them. He would indolently remark some times that the \" proper study of mankind is man,\" and it is certain that he had a natural gift that way. If Adrian Walmesley tried to look below the surface, it was that he might know better how to help those who were in need ; with Dudley Graham, whose powers of analysis and observation were naturally greater and also more highly trained, it was that he might know how to make best use of his fellow-creatures ; how to turn what he discovered to his own account. Starting too, as he did, with a low opinion of men and women in general, doubtful of their goodness \u2014 questioning their motives even when their deeds bore a noble impress \u2014 he was, unfortunately, far more likely to be correct in his deductions than Adrian, who, in spite of many disappointments, still trusted and hoped on. \"Yes, I like it,\" Eleanor said in reply to his question, \"and I really,\" with a little laugh, \"think it does me good.

Everything is so cut and dried and you are expected to enjoy to order as you do everything else. But surely you should never feel dull or depressed ; is it not flying in the face of Providence a little ? When it has been as generous to any one as it has to you, may it not expect to see its gifts enjoyed to the full \u25a0 \u2014 or take them away ? \" \" You think I am very fortunate ? \" she said. She was always curious to hear what people thought on this point. \" Surely ! Fame does not often come to us in the spring of life, and on the top of other gifts that in themselves place us above the crowd.\" \" You think so ? \" she said, with a little curious smile. \" As to ' Fame,' that is a very big word, and one to which I am not entitled. To have written a novel that has caught the public fancy is scarcely fame.\" \" But you will be able to lay claim to the word in its full meaning one day, if you like,\" he said confidently. \" I have read some of your later sketches and stories, Miss Monroe, and \u2014 I hope you will not consider me impertinent for saying so \u2014 E"], [62, "50 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. they show a marked improvement on your first work, and I am sure you have it in you to do better still.

They do me good. When \" she stopped and hesitated. In spite of what she had gone through she had not lost all youthful impulsiveness, and in Dudley's expe rienced hands she had been led on to speak more freely than usual. \" When,\" she repeated, but altering the sentence, \" you have made up your mind to reach a certain goal you like to be told that you are on the right road.\" \" Certainly,\" he agreed, apparently not remark ing her momentary embarrassment. \" But I scarcely think, Miss Monroe, you needed me to convince you of this. Your own inner consciousness \u2014 than which, in spite of what people say, there is no more reliable guide \u2014 must have told you this ; not to speak of the flattering eagerness of publishers and the no less flattering captiousness of a certain class of critics.\" She laughed, and he thought to himself how her face lit up when she was pleased."], [63, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 51 In her yellow silk gown, with a bright colour flushing her dark skin and her eyes glowing like stars, she was really a handsome woman ; some thing more than handsome, indeed, to a man like Dudley Graham, with his blase passions and lack of enthusiasm. Palpitating with life, and youth, and energy, she was fascinating \u2014 alluring, and stirred even his sluggish blood for a moment. \" She might be worth cultivating,\" he said to himself. \" I think she would prove a curious and interesting study. There is a good deal of the ' natural man ' in her still, or I am very much mis taken ; civilisation has not brought her down to the dead level yet.\" When Miss Masson drove away with her two charges at the end of the evening she put her usual question : \" Well, my dears, and how have you enjoyed yourselves ? \" She was one of those kindly-natured, amiable old ladies to whom it comes natural to \" my dear \" the world at large. \" Very much indeed, thank you, auntie,\" said Madge. \" What do you say, Eleanor ? \" \" Very much, too,\" she replied with a smile. \" I have not enjoyed myself as well for a long time.\" \" I am glad of that.

I know what you would say. You mean that because he is a relative we ought to stand him up as straight as he will go and present him best side forward.

He seemed to me a man who had read a great deal and thought a great deal, and I found his conversation decidedly interesting.\" \"Yes, that is the worst of it,\" Madge grumbled on. \" He is silver-tongued, and puts things before you so daintily that you often swallow them without knowing it. But they leave a bad taste behind.

And when he does come to see us, which is not often lately, we do not seem to have much to say to one another. Still, we must not be carried away by our feelings ; we must be just.\" \" Oh yes, we must be just,\" Madge echoed with a saucy smile, as she settled herself in her corner and closed her eyes. She opened them, however, after a few minutes, to remark, \" But I suppose you will acknowledge, auntie, that cousin or no cousin, he does not compare with"], [66, "54 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. Adrian ? One seems to bring out all the good in you and the other \u2014 all the bad.\" \" My dear, I never thought of comparing them ; I should as soon think of comparing \u2014 \" \" Light and darkness,\" said Madge promptly; and then she turned and closed her eyes in earnest. But those few words had reminded Eleanor of last night, and of what Adrian had been doing while she was dancing at Mrs. Trelawny's. She had not thought of it before, or of him. \" I wonder,\" she said to herself thoughtfully, \" whether it is that my nature is worse than I sus pected, but it is certainly true that I felt at once at home with Dudley Graham and attracted by him to a certain extent ; while with Adrian Walmesley, a man nobler and better in every way than the other, I have never lost a certain little feeling of constraint. It seems to me sometimes as though with those clear, honest eyes of his, he were looking right into my soul, and,\" more thoughtfully, \" as though I must hide it away out of his sight.\""], [67, "55 CHAPTER IV. \" Oh, we're sunk enough here, God knows ! but not quite so sunk that moments, Sure tho' seldom, are denied us, when the spirit's true endowments Stand out plainly from its false ones, and apprise it if pursuing Or the right way or the wrong way, to its triumph or undoing.\" Dudley made a point of calling at Porchester Terrace the first afternoon he was sure of finding Miss Masson at home, thinking that possibly he might meet Miss Monroe there, and conscious of a certain desire to improve his acquaintance with her. He was not disappointed. He had exchanged greetings with his relatives, had coolly received and acknowledged Madge's sarcastic exclamation of surprise at his appearance, and had sat with a cup of tea in his hand \u2014 a refreshment he did not greatly"], [68, "56 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. favour \u2014 for about five minutes, when the door opened and Eleanor came in. \" May I sit down and talk to you a little while ?\" he asked humbly, making his way to her as soon as he saw an opportunity. \" I have been handing round tea and cake until I am almost exhausted, and the way in which I have discussed the weather and the new piece at the Lyceum is positively marvellous. I never wish to hear either of them mentioned again !\" She turned round with a smile. \" Poor thing ! you certainly do look almost worn out,\" she said. \" Sit down by all means, if you think they can manage without you.\" \" They must try,\" he said, with determination. \" There is a limit to all things.\" It was getting late in the afternoon and most of the visitors had taken their departure, when some one came quickly along the hall \u2014 a firm, decided step that caught Eleanor's ear and made her heart beat a little faster \u2014 and, unannounced, made his entry into the softly-lighted room. \" Adrian, is that you ?\" Miss Masson exclaimed, as she recognised the new-comer. \" This is an unexpected pleasure.\" \" I had to come this way on business,\" he said, \" and I thought I should like to run in and see you.\""], [69, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 57 \" I will ring for some fresh tea,\" Madge said, when the greetings were over. \"You want some thing to warm and cheer you after being out on such a day as this, I should think. It is real November weather, which means that it is about as disagreeable as it can be.\" Adrian had seen Eleanor the moment he entered the room \u2014 perhaps there had been an unexpressed wish in his heart that he should find her there \u2014 had seen, too, with a sudden contraction of the brows, who was her companion. Presently, when the last of the droppers-in had said good-bye, Dudley could no longer attempt to monopolise Eleanor's society and the conversation became general. \" You are going to stay to dinner, of course, Eleanor, and so are you, Dudley \u2014 never mind about your dress \u2014 and I hope you will, too, Adrian ?\" said Miss Masson. \" We shall be quite a cosy little party.\" Adrian hesitated a moment, but there was nothing he need do that night and the temptation was strong. \" Thank you, I shall be very pleased,\" he replied, and then as Miss Masson left the room on hospitable thoughts intent, he made some remark to Eleanor, drawing his chair a little closer to hers."], [70, "58 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. It was but a casual question, but it served to give him her undivided attention for a few minutes, at least. After one swift glance, Dudley turned to speak to his cousin, but while discussing, lightly enough, some current topic of the day, he was conscious of a feeling of vague uneasiness or dissatisfaction. \" Looks as if the parson were a little epris,\" he was thinking to himself. \" He got in my way once before, he had better look out how he does it again. It wants a lot of consideration, of course, but I am not at all sure that I shall not go in for the stakes myself. The little one would have suited me better in some respects (by the ' little one ' he meant Madge, who, conscious of her five feet, four inches, would have been proportionally indignant at such a term), but I hadn't a chance there, and, after all, though this one isn't an heiress, the prospects of a popular authoress are not to be despised. And then \u2014 well, somehow she attracts me.\" About a year ago, Dudley Graham, finding that his pecuniary position was anything but satisfac tory, and not seeing his way to bettering it to any extent under existing circumstances, had, with a certain amount of regret, made up his mind to marry ; money, of course, being the primary con sideration."], [71, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 59 His cousin, Madge Harvey, was conveniently near at hand, and in every way suitable ; she had a nice fortune, was twenty-one years of age, and her own mistress. So, carefully and judiciously, he set to work to storm the fortress, advancing by almost imperceptible degrees lest he should raise an alarm. Up to this time he had not troubled himself very much about his relatives at Porchester Terrace \u2014 their way of life was not his and the courtesies exchanged between them had been of a merely formal charac ter \u2014 so that he had to be careful not to increase the intimacy at too rapid a rate, for fear of exciting suspicion. It must have been due to this discretion that a gentleman of so much discernment wasted five or six months over what had been hopeless from the beginning. Though Madge treated him with studied polite ness, and even sometimes went as far as to allow him to amuse and interest her, she had a rooted antipathy to him, which she scarcely attempted to disguise and which she made no effort to overcome. When at last this was made quite clear to him, he threw up the game at once, angry that he should have lost so much time over it, and telling himself \u2014rightly or wrongly \u2014 that he might have succeeded but for Adrian Walmesley. \" He doesn't approve of me and that would be"], [72, "60 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. quite enough for her,\" he said to himself, with an ugly sneer. But though his visits to Porchester Terrace gradually fell off again, he did not let the intimacy grow too cool. The heiress who would help him out of his difficulties was still to be found, and it was possible his relatives might be of use in the matter ; so he kept on friendly terms with them. Adrian and Dudley accompanied the ladies into the drawing-room after dinner, for the decanters and a cigar had very little attraction for either of them, and they certainly had no inclination to linger in one another's society. \" Now with you and Miss Monroe, Dudley, we ought to have quite a nice musical evening,\" said Miss Masson, smiling amiably all round. \" Are you fond of music then, Mr. Graham ?\" asked Eleanor, looking up with interest. \" Yes, I think I may say I am\u2014 very,\" he replied in his soft, trainante voice. \" You are a little bit surprised, are you not ? \" laughed Madge. \" It is very hard on poor Dudley, somehow no one thinks of him as a musical being, and yet he really sings delightfully ; perhaps he will honour us presently if we are very good. People, I suppose, don't give him credit for having enough what shall I say ?\" \"Soul,\" put in Dudley calmly. \"That will"], [73, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 61 do, won't it ? I believe the general opinion is that, to appreciate music, you must be a spiritual, soulful creature, and my cousin you see, Miss Monroe, does not give me credit for possessing these qualifications.\" \" I have reluctantly come to the conclusion,\" laughed Eleanor, \" that a lot of nonsense is talked in this respect. I have heard it said that unless you feel what you are singing, you cannot put the proper expression into it. Now I take the liberty of differing from that opinion.\" \" Do you mean to say,\" asked Madge in some astonishment, \" that you do not feel what you sing ? I can scarcely believe that ; yours is such an ex pressive voice.\" \" I don't know that I was exactly thinking of myself then,\" said Eleanor, with a little blush. \" I was thinking of a girl I knew at school, who sang \u2014 you would have said \u2014 with her whole soul, only, as it happened, she had not any. But in my own case I think a great deal is due to imagi nation.\" \" You mean that you can forge, yourself in the part you are taking,\" asked Dudley, fixing his sleepy eyes on her. \" Yes, I lose myself for the time ; but is that really feeling what I sing ; is it not rather the consequence of a vivid imagination ? \""], [74, "62 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. ' Ah ! now you are going too deep for me,\" Madge cried. \" Don't be metaphysical to-night, Eleanor ; take your seat at the piano and let us judge for ourselves.\" Eleanor laughed, and moved across the room, Dudley following her to the piano. She was very fond of Madge, and allowed her more license than she had ever allowed anyone else. The pretty, spoilt girl was such a contrast to her self in every way that at first she had studied her with some curiosity ; but gradually, as she learnt to know the sterling, honest nature \u2014 a nature that could never palter with evil ; that instinctively rejected the specious reasoning of the present day, that wrong may under some circumstances be right and right wrong \u2014 she grew to honour as well as love her, and, unconsciously, to value her good opinion. And yet in Eleanor's love for Madge there was that touch of protection, which a woman who has lived and suffered sometimes feels for an inex perienced girl, who stands on the threshold of the world, looking into it with dazzled eyes ; she would fain keep her from her own bitter knowledge. Though there was so little real difference in their ages, she knew that there was a gulf between them wider and deeper than any made by years."], [75, "63 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. Eleanor selected a little French song, with a soft, plaintive accompaniment, and the tender, pathetic words, breathed forth in that melodious voice, touched each one of her listeners, though in a different way. One verse ran as follows : \" Le spectre d'une ancienne ann6e M'est apparu, tenant aux doigts Une blanche rose fanee, Et murmurant a demi-voix : ' Ou done est ton c\u0153ur d'autrefois ? Ou done est l'esp6rance, eclose Comme cette rose, en ton c\u0153ur ? Douce esperance et douce rose, Ah ! quel parfum etait le leur, Quand toutes deux etaient en fleur!' \" There's something more than a vivid imagina tion there,\" said Dudley to himself, as he listened with critical enjoyment. \" And yet what can the past hold for her ? She is so young still. But that voice and expression \u2014 ' Ou done est ton c\u0153ur d'autrefois ? ' Has she had some bitter experi ence ? If so, it must be my business, if I mean to go in for this seriously, to find out all about it. I don't want to make a second mistake.\" Adrian was conscious of a vague longing to go over to Eleanor ; it was almost as though he knew she had need of him, as though she had called to him."], [76, "64 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. \" I wish I . could do something for her,\" he thought; \"I feel that she wants help and com fort in some way.\" But the next minute, when the song ceased, he was ready to laugh at his own folly. \" Because she has what our neighbours call tears in her voice, does it follow that she is necessarily unhappy ? \" he asked himself im patiently. \" I thought I had more sense. And she \u2014 young, famous, with all the world before her- \u2014 what could 1 do for her ? \" But Madge had caught the tender look in his eyes as they rested for an instant on the figure at the piano, and it gave her a faint heart-ache which she could not quite forget for the rest of the evening. Dudley sang something afterwards, a song of the present day ; not sad enough to be mournful, not bitter enough to be hard : indeed, faintly tolerant of life and rather amused at it than otherwise We would have all the world believe that we take our passions much diluted nowadays ; that nothing can touch us very strongly. We are so busy grubbing about in the dead leaves at our feet that we have no time to look up to the sun shining above us or to listen to the singing of the birds ; so the spirit of the dead leaves enters into all we do. And yet now and again something will suddenly rouse us and we will spring upright and remember"], [77, "65 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. that after all \u2014 even at the end of this nineteenth century \u2014 we are men with a man's passions still. The evening concluded with a duet \u2014 -\" Oh, that we two were maying !\" and Dudley rendered his part with much artistic feeling. It was possible that the expression he threw into his voice differed from that in Eleanor's, inasmuch as it was in her to feel all that a strong human nature can feel \u2014 though as yet she might not have proved it \u2014 and in Dudley Graham it was not. \" There ! I am sure you must be tired out,\" Eleanor said as she rose from the piano. \" I am afraid you and I, Mr. Graham, have forgotten our long-suffering audience.\" \" I know my aunt, at least, has enjoyed it,\" he replied ; \" have you not, Aunt Lucy ? And \" he said, dropping his voice and looking her straight in the face, as they stood together putting away the music, \" you have given me a treat, too. I think if I could always have you to sing to me, I should develop into quite a model young man : it made me feel so good.\" \" Ah, I know that feeling,\" she said with a laugh, as she moved away, \" and it is a very evanescent one and not at all to be relied upon.\" She was quite at her ease with him, her colour had not changed under that long look from his F"], [78, "66 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. handsome, sleepy eyes, which he generally found so effective. It happened by chance that Adrian and Eleanor were left for a few minutes alone in the drawing room ; Dudley had said good-night, having an appointment at his club, and Miss Masson and Madge had gone out into the hall with him. \" You are tired ? \" he said gently, watching her as she stood with her arm on the mantelpiece, looking down into the fire, her face grave enough now and even a little sad. \" No,\" rousing herself, \" I was only thinking.\" \" Of the delightful evening you have given us, I hope. I think music is one of the choicest gifts. I have the love of it, and that is all, unfortunately. I am almost as bad as the man who only knew two tunes, one was ' God save the Queen,' and the other \u2014 wasn't.\" He was trying to make her look up at him and smile. It troubled him to see that shadow resting on her face. \" Have I really given you some pleasure this evening ?\" she asked, almost eagerly. \" I am very glad if it is so. I am afraid I don't do much in that way. I don't seem to think of anyone but myself \u2014 my own interests, my own enjoy ment.\""], [79, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 67 \" Are you not a little hard on yourself?\" he asked in his sympathetic voice ; a voice that had brought comfort to many a poor wounded soul. \" Nothard enough \u2014 not half hard enough. If you only knew \u2014 but there ! my iniquities won't interest you.\" \" I think,\" very softly, \" that anything that con cerns you would interest me. If I could only help you or be of use to you in any way, I should ask nothing better.\" There was no reply. \" Have I presumed too far on our short acquaintance ? Forgive me. I had no right to suppose that you were in any need of advice or assistance ; or that, if you were, you would take mine.\" She turned impulsively and held out her hand. \" I like you to talk to me like that,\" she said. \" Be my friend ; you appeal to the better side of of my nature \u2014 I have enough that appeals to the worse. I have never been very good, I am afraid, but lately I have felt as though I were slipping lower down, as though all the good impulses were leaving me. I have said to myself \u2014 ' Once upon a time, when you were poor ansl miserable, no one cared about you ; why should F 2"], [80, "68 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. you trouble about others now ? ' Indeed I have need of a good, true friend.\" She stood before him with flushed cheeks and soft, dewy eyes ; not a proud, self-reliant woman any longer, only a helpless girl seeking to steady herself against a man's strength. He raised her outstretched hand reverently to his lips. \" What a man can do, I will do,\" he said, in a voice that was not quite steady. \" God help me to be a friend to you in deed and in truth.\" For a moment they stood hand clasped in hand' looking into each other's eyes. Then Eleanor's heart beat faster \u2014 did she feel the man's pulses throb under hers ? \u2014 and gently disengaging her hand she turned away. And the little god who, in spite of our fin-de-siecle wisdom, still finds more to do in the world than anybody else listened with a smile. He had seen his arrows labelled \"friendship \" and other strange names many times before, and he was not in the least surprised."], [81, "69 CHAPTER V. \" Memory is a rare ghost raiser. Like a haunted house its walls are ever echoing to unseen feet. Through the broken casements we watch the flitting shadows of the dead, and the saddest shadows of them all are the shadows of our own dead selves.\" Eleanor sat alone in her own room. It was early in January, and a bright fire was burning on the hearth, and lighted candles stood on the toilet table ; she was doing nothing, but she objected to being in the dark. The days had gone by when she could sit and dream in the twilight. She had come upstairs with the ostensible inten tion of going to bed, but not feeling sleepy had put on her dressing-gown and drawn up an armchair in front of the fire instead. She had taken up a book with the idea of reading, but it dropped unheeded into her lap in a few minutes."], [82, "70 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN She was thinking over the past. As a rule, she was wise enough and strong enough not to indulge in such a dangerous habit ; but to-night a combination of circum stances had drawn her thoughts that way, and for once she did not resist. She had gone back to that night, which, illuminated by a lurid light, stood out in her memory apart from all other nights \u2014 the one that saw her temptation and fall. She remembered how she had been roused in the morning by the sound of loud knocking at her door and her landlady's voice crying in tones of alarm : \" Miss Monroe ! Miss Monroe ! I want to speak to you. Something dreadful has happened.\" And then, slowly recalling her scattered senses, for the dullness of heavy sleep was still on her. he had got up, wondering what was the matter , how she came to be sleeping on the rug in front of the fire. The next moment, in one swift flash, it had all come back to her, and with a shudder she told her self that she must not keep Mrs. Smith outside the door any longer ; that she must do nothing to draw suspicion upon herself. The deed was done and she might as well reap the benefit of it. So, wrapping an old dressing-gown hastily round her, for she had thrown herself down the"], [83, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 71 previous night without removing her clothes, and disarranging the bed as though she had just got up, she gave one swift glance round the room to see whether there were anything in it to excite suspicion or surprise, and then unlocked the door. She remembered how she had stood listening to her landlady's story, dumb and motionless, wonder ing vaguely whether it were not all a dream # Fortunately, her stony silence might well pass for wonder and dismay, and Mrs. Smith had so many words with which to express her own horror and surprise at the sudden death of her lodger, that she had no time to notice Eleanor. She glibly narrated how she had gone upstairs as usual at eight o'clock with Mr. Hunt's breakfast, for the old man was an early riser, and after knocking once or twice and failing to get any response had cautiously opened the door, thinking, though it was a very unusual thing for him to do, that he might have overslept himself; how she had found the room all in darkness and had called to him by name and he had neither moved nor spoken. Then, seized with sudden fear, she had hastily drawn up the blind and let the light stream over the bed \u2014 and with one glance had learnt the truth. Eleanor had recovered herself somewhat by the end of the story and, advising her landlady to send"], [84, "72 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. for Mr. Hunt's doctor, who had been lately attend ing him, she promised to dress herself quickly and to come and keep her company, for Mrs. Smith confessed that she was \" all of a tremble.\" \" I am not often as late as this,\" Eleanor had managed to say, \" but I was very tired when I went to bed last night \u2014 you know I had been out all the afternoon \u2014 and I must have overslept myself.\" \" You did not hear anything in the night, I suppose, miss ? No call for help \u2014 or anything of that sort ? \" \" No \u2014 nothing.' \" Ah, then it must have been quite sudden-like. The poor heart, I expect.\" And this was the doctor's verdict when he had made his visit. He said that he had been attend ing Mr. Hunt for an affection of the heart, had warned him, indeed, that he must be very careful, for that any over-exertion or excitement might prove fatal. No doubt, he had exhausted himself the previous day collecting his rents \u2014 had, very possibly, had some altercation with one of his tenants, which in his state of health was quite sufficient to account for what had happened, and in the night the feeble heart had suddenly ceased to beat. The doctor's decision did away with all diffi-"], [85, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 73 culties. The old man was quietly buried and leav ing no will \u2014 like so many misers he had never had the heart to contemplate any one else enjoying his possessions \u2014 all his money went to his next-of-kin. In a few weeks the little event which had created quite a sensation in Hart Street, Finsbury Park, was almost forgotten \u2014 at least, by all but Eleanor Monroe. She could not forget. She grew to hate and fear the sight of that closed room, to have a horror of the darkness and her own society \u2014 she who had never known what nerves meant ; to wake up in the night trembling with dread and expectation, listening for she knew not what ; burying her face in the pillows lest she should open her eyes and see something that would turn her heart to stone. She did not easily give way to such feelings ; she fought them inch by inch, wrestling with this hated memory and striv ing to thrust it out into the darkness ; but again and again it sprang upon her unawares. She felt no remorse ; she did not repent what she had done, and therefore she rebelled the more bitterly against the moral consequences of her act, against her in ability to take up her life again at the sams point as before that fatal night. \" He is dead,\" she would say to herself, \" but of what use was he ? Is he any loss to anyone ?"], [86, "74 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. Besides, I did not kill him ; he would have died in any case in a few weeks or months. I only wanted a little of his money \u2014 he had plenty \u2014 just to give myself one chance.\" But though she reasoned with herself thus, and as long as daylight lasted could in a measure forget, when night came on all her courage and self-control did not avail to keep that shapeless terror at bay. \" If I stay here, I shall go mad \u2014 or confess,\" she said to herself at last, and then, having once recognised her weakness, she took steps to prevent such a contingency. Informing her landlady that she had accepted a situation in the country, she moved into quiet lodgings in Bloomsbury, intending to wait there until she learnt what reception her book \u2014 which was already in the publisher's hands \u2014 met with from the public. It proved an immediate success ; and in the whirl of her new life, with plenty of work to do and plenty of pleasure to occupy all her spare moments, she succeeded in deadening the memory of the past. In deadening \u2014 but not in for getting. Sometimes, at the most unexpected times \u2014 at the most inconvenient seasons, a word, an expression, would send her thoughts flying back ; then a shadow would creep over her face, she would grow unconscious of her surroundings, and only come back to them with a start."], [87, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 75 And lately the matter had developed a new phase ; a new and startling one, with which at times she found herself almost powerless to cope. Her thoughts were busy with that now. \" I cannot imagine what possesses me,\" she was saying to herself. \" Why can't I leave it alone ? If I encourage it in this way it will grow too strong for me presently and then \u2014 then \u2014 what will be the end ? And yet there is a certain fascination in deceiving all these good people, and a still greater one in handling such a dangerous subject ; in leading it up to a certain point, at which only a few steps farther \u2014 and my secret would be a secret no longer. There is a certain enjoyment in knowing that you hold such a bombshell in your hand ; that you have the power to cause quite a fright to a number of highly respectable and highly uninteresting people, who condescendingly admire you and praise you and run after you just because you happen for the moment to be the fashion.\" She leant back more comfortably in her chair, and presently, gazing dreamily into the fire, her eyes softened and the corners of her mouth \u2014 which in repose was a little hard and cruel \u2014 relaxed. \" Yes, I am not mistaken, I am sure I am not,\" she was thinking. \" He loves me \u2014 Adrian Walmesley loves me.\" She drew a long breath as she whispered that mighty word softly to herself."], [88, "76 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. \" And what love can mean to such a man ! Not a selfish, headstrong passion, heedless of everything but its own gratification ; not, on the other hand, a pale, bloodless thing with scarcely strength enough to endure ; but a pure, grand love that penetrates into every fibre of the man's being and yet does not overpower his senses ; that sets the welfare of the one loved above every other consideration ; that would, if need were, live on unexpressed \u2014 claiming no hearing, far less a reward \u2014 if that were best for her. Ah ! if I had not given up praying long ago, I would say \u2014 Thank God ! \u2014 thank God ! \" There were unshed tears in her eyes, and her face was soft and subdued. \" I wonder if he has owned it to himself yet ? \" she thought presently, with a little happy smile, \" He made a fight for it at first ; it was not quite easy work for me \u2014 but then the victory was all the greater when it came, and once I knew him for what he is, I could not resist. I think he had some qualms of conscience about his poor people\u2014 he reproached himself for taking a thought away from them \u2014 and then, perhaps, he wondered a little what sort of a clergyman's wife I should make. Well ! I wonder too. But then,\" blushing softly, \" I love him so well that it will all come easy to me ; there is nothing too hard for love.

I shall be able to help in his good work.\" And so Eleanor Monroe sat dreaming over the fire until late into the night, the past for the time completely forgotten ; happy in the knowledge that the only man who had ever touched her heart was hers to have and to hold. \" It is a very happy time when you know how it all is and yet the decisive word has not been spoken,\" she said to herself, as she laid her head on the pillow. \" But it will come soon now and \u2014 and I think I have made up my mind what I shall say.\""], [90, "78 CHAPTER VI. \" ' Speak \u2014 I love thee best !

As a rule she was above such small feminine weaknesses, but now she stopped a moment in front of the mirror before she went out. \" I am looking fagged and overworked,\" she said to herself as she discontentedly contemplated her own reflection and arranged the coils of her straight, heavy black hair, which was at once her pride and despair by reason of its rich abundance and its lack of wave or curl \u2014 so different from Madge's bright, fluffy head, as she sometimes told herself. Taking a bunch of violets out of a glass on the mantel piece, she put them in the bodice of her blue serge dress, and then with an impatient shrug at her own folly, she hastily left the room. \" I have called with a message from Miss Masson,\" Adrian said as they shook hands. \" I have just come from there. They say you have quite deserted them lately and want to know if you will go round to dinner to-morrow.

You see, unfortunately, one cannot cultivate one's complexion and literature both at the same time.\" He looked up in some surprise. He was not accustomed to small feminine vanities in her. \" You look overworked,\" he said, \" perhaps, b\u00bbt that is all. I don't think,\" smiling a little as his eyes rested a moment on the straight, shapely young figure, \" that you need fear the student's stoop just at present. I see no signs of it now, at all events.\" \" You are laughing at me,\" she said with a pretty smile, \" and I deserve it.

But, seriously, cannot you knock off work for a little while and take a rest ? \" \" Knock off work ? What a suggestion ! Do you think that the British Public (capitals, please!) is accustomed to being treated in that way ? When it deigns to bestow its favour, you must make the most of it ; if it solemnly announces that your little efforts are not altogether unreadable, you must always have something on hand for it, or the chances are you will be forgotten. In any case, a fresh favourite will probably take your place before long. I suppose in no profession does the axiom hold more true, that you must make hay while the sun shines.\" \" I don't like that idea,\" he said. \" I wish \" You wish ? \" she repeated, as he hesi tated. \" I was going to say that I wish you were removed from all such considerations, that \u2014 \" \" Don't say you wish I had not my work,\" she interrupted. \" I do not know what I should do without it.

Having it, you must use it ; but don't think me very selfish if I say that sometimes I could almost find it in my heart to wish it had been given to another.\" It was growing dusk, but not dark enough for the lamps to be lit, and the warm firelight played round the pretty room with its yellow draperies and dainty arrangement of flowers. Eleanor was never too busy to let the impress of her own hand rest on her home. \" Why ? \" she asked softly, after a moment. She could not see Adrian's face distinctly, but some thing in his voice had thrilled her. \" Why ? Because then you might not stand so far above me. I might be able to reach you,\" he said in a low tone. She was glad that the gathering darkness hid her face. Her composure seemed suddenly to fail her ; all at once she felt troubled and half afraid. \" I will ring for lights and we will have some tea,\" she said hastily, half rising from her seat. \" It was very remiss of me not to think of it before.\" \" Not for a moment,\" he said, crossing over to her. \" Listen to me for one moment, I must speak now. I cannot remain in doubt any longer. Eleanor, I love you \u2014 will you be my wife ? \""], [95, "83 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. Only that ; the one simple question spoken straight from the man's heart to the woman's and needing no protestations to give it weight. She had sunk back in her chair, clasping her hands together to still their trembling. She had not the courage to look up at him. \" I know that you have a right to expect more, far more, than I can give you,\" he went on, still in the same grave, quiet voice. \" You are fitted to adorn any position and I am asking you to give it all up ; for that is what it would practically come to. The wife of an East End clergyman could have little in common with fashion and society. On the one hand is the world and all it can offer you ; on the other is only \u2014 my love. Perhaps I have scarcely the right to ask such a sacrifice. And yet sometimes I have thought that the life you lead now does not satisfy you, and sometimes even,\" his voice very low and tender, \" I have ventured to hope that you cared for me a little \u2014 and Eleanor, if you love me but a tithe of how I love you what I ask will be no sacrifice at all.\" \" And it is not ! \" she said, raising her head with a proud gesture and iooking him fearlessly in the face. \" I am not worthy of you, Adrian \u2014 I am not worthy to share your life ; but if you want me\u2014 here I am,\" and she held out her hands with a g \u2014 2"], [96, "84 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. frank grace that went straight to the man's heart. \" My darling ! \" he murmured very tenderly, and clasping her hands closely in his, he stooped down and kissed her softly on the lips. After a while, when they had grown a little more composed and were sitting talking together, Adrian said, \" I won't make it harder for you than I can help, Eleanor. I know you will be ready to do what is right and to help me when needful, but I shall not let you sacrifice yourself entirely. You shall not be quite shut out of society ; at least, not from the best part of it. You can still keep your place in the literary world and you shall have time for your own friends and your own pursuits. I have no right to ask you to give up your work, and I do not wish that you should. Fortunately, I am not a poor man, and there will be no need for you to be troubled with sordid cares, and though I must take you to a home in the East End, I will try and make it as bright as I can for you. I could not leave my poor people.\" \" And do you think I should ask you to do so ?\" she said reproachfully. \" Where you are, I shall be quite content to be, and what has been good enough for you will be good enough for me. You must make no change on my account, Adrian.\""], [97, "85 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. \" I don't promise you any luxuries, dear one \u2014 I could not make our home too great a contrast to our surroundings \u2014 but there is no reason why it should not be bright and pretty, and I intend it to be so. It is a quaint old house \u2014 the Vicarage. You see it was not always in the slums and, as people say now, there are many ' possibilities ' in it.\" Presently Adrian went away, reluctantly enough, and Eleanor sat alone dreaming over the fire, sea had been brought in and the lamp lit, but the sub dued light that came through the sunflower shade was no hindrance to dreaming. Eleanor never thought of her neglected work, and if she had, it would have made no difference. For this one night love reigned supreme and would brook no rival. As she sat there thinking, her face clouded over a little. \" He is so noble, so unsuspicious,\" she said to herself; \" he knows that I am an orphan and alone in the world, that I have had to earn my own living, but nothing else ; and he has never sought to know more. Some men \u2014 such a man as Dudley Graham, for instance \u2014 would not have dreamt of proposing under these circumstances. They would make enquiries as to my family \u2014 would want my previous life spread out before them like a book to see whether I were worthy of the honour they contemplated for me !

I ought to be grateful that Adrian is of a different stamp. \" I suppose some people,\" she went on musingly, \" would say I was requiting his trust very badly ; that it is my duty to acquaint him with a certain event in my past life. They may be right ; but I shall not do so. Once upon a time, I was as straight and honest as anyone could be ; I should have scorned to deceive any man \u2014 to have hidden anything. If circumstances have changed me, am I to blame ? Besides, that episode is past and done with. Of what use to drag it to the light ? Would it do any good ? Would it not rather create a great deal of unhappiness ? I shall not make him the less worthy a wife because of it. Bah !\" with sudden self-scorn, \" let me still be honest with myself at least, if I can. I shall not tell Adrian \u2014 because it would drive him away from me ; because, with his lofty ideals, he would loathe and scorn me for such a thing; because,\" passionately, \" I love him with all my heart and 1 could not live without him ! My crime \u2014 if it were a crime \u2014 has not brought me the happiness I expected, it seems to have shadowed everything ; to have drawn a line between me and the rest of the world. Well, with Adrian, I feel that I can cross that line, that I can really be happy at last\u2014 and I will.\""], [99, "87 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. And yet Eleanor Monroe's nature was originally a noble one, was a noble one still in many ways, but it had needed careful treatment, and instead it had been roughly handled, and so the twist came. She was so busy thinking, that she did not hear the door open behind her and did not move until a voice cried \u2014 \" Why, Eleanor ! Sitting dreaming over the fire ? Wonders will never cease.\" It was Madge Harvey who spoke. Eleanor rose hastily from her chair. \" Is that you Madge ? This is an unexpected pleasure. Mr. Walmesley,\" hesitating a little over the name, \" came in this afternoon and brought me a message from Miss Masson, so I was not thinking of seeing you.\" \" Well, I have had to engage myself unexpec tedly for to-morrow night, so I thought I would run round and have a chat with you and see whether you could arrange for some other night instead, as I don't want to be out when you come.\" Eleanor looked up a little bewildered. She had not quite recovered her scattered senses and had for gotten for the moment the gist ofthe message sent her. \" Didn't Adrian tell you that we wanted you to come to dinner to-morrow ?\" asked Madge, a little surprised."], [100, "88 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. \" Of course he did. How stupid of me ! Well, dear, let us put it off as you are going out. I shall be delighted to come another time instead. And now, you are not in any hurry, are you ? So sit down and make yourself comfortable,\" and Eleanor drew up a low chair to the fire. \" Well, if you are sure I am not hindering you \u2014 and you really didn't look very busy when I came in \u2014 I will stop a little while. Are those muffins under that cover ? Thank you, I can't refuse the juicy morsel. Carries me back to the days of my childhood \u2014 muffin-man, muffin-man's bell and all that sort of thing, you know,\" and as she drank her tea, Madge rattled on with a lot of nonsense. Presently it struck her that Eleanor was scarcely as attentive as usual, and that Eleanor's gaze, which generally lingered on her own bright face, was rather abstracted this afternoon. \" Has anything happened ?\" she asked suddenly. \" Have you just written something par ticularly smart, or have the critics been unusually kind, or what is it ? You look so absurdly happy. Good heavens !\" leaning forward and fixing her with a pair of mischievous blue eyes , \" I believe she is actually blushing ! I should not have thought it possible. Don't keep me in suspense, Eleanor, what is it ? It is of no use trying to pre varicate. I see that something has happened, and"], [101, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 89 here I stop until you tell me what it is,\" and Madge threw herself on the rug at Eleanor's feet and lifted a laughing face to hers. Eleanor made no reply for a moment. She was still gazing dreamily into the fire, and the happy restful look that Madge had noticed, and which had struck her as something new and strange, still lingered on her face. \" I beg your pardon, dear,\" Madge said, drop ping her bantering tone, \" I am afraid I have been indiscreet. Auntie calls me ' flighty ' sometimes when she wants to be extra severe and 1 fear it is a true bill. My spirits run away with me at times and land me in very awkward places.\" And she gravely shook her curly head over her own short comings. \" I am not offended, Madge ; indeed, I think I am very glad you came in just now, for \u2014 you guessed correctly \u2014 something has happened ; something that has made me very happy, and I want some one to be glad with me.\" \" You know I love you,\" Madge said, laying her cheek caressingly against the hand in Eleanor's lap, \" and that what makes you happy must make me happy too. Tell me what you like.\" \" This afternoon,\" Eleanor went on softly after a moment, \" Adrian Walmesley asked me to be \u2014 his wife.\""], [102, "90 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. \" Have you nothing to say to me, Madge ?\" she asked presently, as there was no reply and no sign that her news was heard beyond one quick move ment in the figure at her feet. \" Won't you wish me happiness ?\" \" You \u2014 you have accepted him, then ?\" \" Yes. Are you surprised ? And yet I don't think,\" proudly, \" that Adrian Walmesley is the kind of man whose love would go unrequited.\" \"You think not ? Is it as bad as that, then ? \" Madge asked with a harsh laugh. \" There, dear, don't be offended,\" she continued, as Eleanor drew back, \" I did not mean to hurt your feelings, but I am afraid I make a bad confidante for lovers' rhapsodies. You see I know nothing about them myself and you need practical experience to sympathise properly, don't you ? But I hope you will be very happy ; I \u2014 I hope it with all my heart.\" Her head still lay in Eleanor's lap and her white face, from which all the brightness seemed to have been blotted out, was turned to the fire. Her hands were still clenched as, unconsciously, she had clenched them when this bolt fell at her feet, and she did not know that the nails had pierced the delicate flesh. \" Won't you kiss me, Madge ? I have no one to take me in their arms and say they are glad for"], [103, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 91 my sake. You have been as dear as a sister to me ; don't turn away from me to-night \u2014 to-night of all nights when I want you most.\" Madge looked slowly round. \" God bless you, dear,\" she said solemnly, drawing Eleanor's face down to her lips. \" God bless you both and make you very happy. You must not mind if I seemed a little strange at first ; it was a great surprise, you know.\" \" But you are pleased about it, Madge, are you not ? I know I am not good enough for him,\" humbly, \" but I shall do my best to make him happy \u2014 indeed I will.\" \" Not good enough for him ! Oh, what a modest Eleanor ! I think the world will look at it in another light, my dear. It will say you have thrown yourself away. But,\" her voice growing grave again, \" I agree with you. Knowing some thing of what Adrian's life has been all these years and of what he has sacrificed to it, I must say that I know no woman quite worthy of him. But he loves you ; that is enough. It is time he should have some one to care for him ; he who has spent himself so freely for others.\" \" It is good to hear you say this, Madge. I know what friends you and he have always been and how much you have helped him.\" \" Yes, as you say, we have always been good"], [104, "92 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. friends ; you see I have known him nearly all my life. And now,\" rising to her feet, \" I think I must go. It is getting late and auntie will wonder what has become of me.\" \" But you said you were not in a hurry,\" Eleanor remonstrated, \" and you haven't been here any time yet. I have so much to say to you.\" \" I am afraid I can't stay now,\" Madge said hastily, \" another time \u2014 I shall be seeing you again soon \u2014 another time I shall be able to stay longer and hear all about it.\" The words sounded a little incoherent and she moved towards the door as she spoke. *' Very well, if you must go, it is of no use saying any more,\" and Eleanor stooped to give Madge her usual kiss. \" You look quite tired, little one,\" she said, resting her hands lightly on Madge's shoulders a moment as she looked in her face. \" I am afraid my happiness has made me selfish, I ought to have noticed it before and not worried you with my concerns.\" \" Nonsense, Eleanor, it is only your imagination. I have been sitting so long in front of the fire that I have got stupid and sleepy,\" slipping lightly away, \" and, indeed, I should have been dreadfully hurt and offended if you had not told me about"], [105, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 93 your engagement.

She was sufficiently at home with these two not to talk unless she felt inclined, and she knew they might safely be left to entertain one another ; so she leant back in her chair and rested her head"], [107, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 95 against the silk cushion, gazing idly into the fire through her half-closed eyes. \" Yes, I went to see it,\" she heard Mrs. Trelawny say, \" and I don't mind confessing that I did not half understand what it was all about. Not that the plot was such a deep one \u2014 there was no plot at all worth mentioning : it was what they call a character-sketch, I believe.\" \" Ah ! I wish I had gone, but matinees are not much in my line. It ought to have been interest ing,\" Dudley replied. \" Well, you might have found it so, but I cer tainly did not. I should not have gone only, you see, as it was written by a friend of mine, she expected me to put in an appearance. It met with a very fair reception though \u2014 very fair, and I hear the papers criticised it favourably. But it wasn't my style.\" \" No, the Gaiety suits you better,\" Dudley replied with a cynical smile. \" You like a little singing, a little dancing, and a lot of pretty dresses.\" \" Well, and if I do, am I alone in that?\" she retorted. \" It strikes me that it is your sex, Mon sieur, that principally adorns the stalls at that same theatre after all.\" \" What is the matter ? \" asked Eleanor, looking round languidly. \" What are you two squabbling about ? \""], [108, "96 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. \" Mrs. Trelawny has been to see an analytical, metaphysical, fin-de-siecle little piece at the Vaudeville written by a friend of hers,\" explained Dudley laughing, \" and she didn't like it, and is offended because I meekly suggest that it was thrown away upon her.\" \"Yes, is he not abominably rude, Miss Monroe?\" asked Mrs. Trelawny, joining in the laugh. \" Just as though I were too frivolous to understand any thing out of the common.\" \" Now,\" continued Dudley in the same bantering tone, \"it would not have been wasted upon Miss Monroe. You ought to have sent her your seat. She likes to analyse people, to find out their motives ; to, in short, turn them inside out.\" \" Do I ? \" said Eleanor, a little coldly. \" Really, I think I was hardly aware of it myself. Of course it is my business to study human nature as much as I can, but apart from my work, I don't know that I have any particular predilection that way.\" \" Have you not ? \" asked Dudley, giving her one of his rare direct looks. \" Forgive me if I can scarcely credit that. I should have said that you had the power of analysis strongly developed. So strongly indeed, that you would be capable of analysing yourself \u2014 which few people can do.\" \" It must be a very uncomfortable quality, and I"], [109, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 97 am glad I haven't got it,\" said Mrs. Trelawny. \" The more you know about people,\" shrewdly, \" the less satisfactory it is as a rule.\" \" Yes ; dig deep enough and you will always come on the bad motive,\" added Dudley, cynically. \" Really, you two people are enough to demora lize anyone,\" said Eleanor. \" Have a little pity on my inexperience and leave me some of my illusions.\" \" You have some still then ? \" he queried \" Yes ; but they are not illusions to me, though no doubt you would call them so.\" \" Ah, you see you are one of fortune's favourites. You must make allowance for those who have not' been as lucky as you.\" \" I, lucky ! Well, I should scarcely have applied that term to myself,\" said Eleanor, laugh ing a little harshly. \" And I don't think I give my fellow-creatures credit for much super fluous goodness, even if I allow them a little more than you do, Mr. Graham. After all, there is a great deal of wisdom in accepting people's own version of themselves and not caring to look further.\" \" That is just what I think,\" said Mrs. Trelawny, nodding her head. \" But supposing,\" said Dudley slowly, with his H"], [110, "98 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. eyes fixed on Eleanor, \" that you are interested in some one, is it not natural to try and learn as much about them as you can ?

Or you recognise a certain impulse \u2014 a certain bent, and, under given circumstances, you can prophecy to what that impulse will lead.

Though she did not look up, she felt his eyes on her face. \" I am not given to flattery,\" he said. \" I think you know that.\" Then he suddenly stretched out his hand and laid it on hers, which rested in dangerous proximity on the piano, and the touch of the soft, warm flesh seemed to fire his blood. \" My darling \u2014 my darling, I love you !\" he broke out. \" I did not mean to speak yet, but it is too strong for me.

Eleanor f^lt again that swift feeling of repulsion. This love was not like Adrian's, it seemed somehow to degrade her ; she could not breathe freely. She felt oppressed and longed to escape from this fierce passion that seemed to encompass her.

She stood up, straight and scornful, and looked him full in the face. \" And you call such a thing as that love ? \" she said, and turned and left him without another word. But when she had reached her own room and locked the door behind her, she fell on her knees by the bedside, crouching low down and twisting her hands in the lace that hung from the coverlet ; all her pride and defiance gone now. \"What did he mean \u2014 what did he mean ? \" she murmured."], [118, "106 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. \" What is he going to do \u2014 what can he do ?

Take all I have beside, but leave me this one man!\""], [119, "107 CHAPTER VIII. \" There are three wolves that hunt for men, And I have met the three, And one is Hunger, and one is Sin, And one is Misery.\" \" Adrian,\" Eleanor said, as they were sitting together in the drawing-room at Pelham Gardens one evening, \" I have an idea which,\" hesitating, \" I should very much like to carry out, if you don't mind ? \" \" Well, \" smiling, \" what is this wonderful idea ? \" \" I have been thinking that I can't do much to help you in your own parish at present and \u2014 and I am so happy myself that I should like to do something for others who are not so fortunate. Just something to show I am not ungrateful, you know.\" \" I understand, darling,\" laying his hand on hers caressingly. \" And I was reading in the paper the other"], [120, "108 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. day, Adrian, what a boon those night coffee-stalls they have started lately in some parts of London are to the very poor this bitter weather, and, and \u2014 I hope you won't think I am dropping from the sublime to the ridiculous \u2014 but I should like to have a coffee-stall myself.\" Eleanor was not sure how her idea would be received, and she was relieved when it was ex pressed. She had been engaged to Adrian nearly a month now, the happiest month in her life, and as each day passed and he grew dearer to her, and his presence brought her a sweet content she had never known before, she began to grow a little afraid. Was it possible that it could last ? That is the taint that a course of misfortune always leaves behind. When happiness comes, it is enjoyed with a certain dread \u2014 a certain reserve. Nothing in our past life has prepared us for it ; we cannot quite understand it, we are always asking ourselves whether it can last. It is only those who have never felt the deadening effect of continuous ill-fortune, who can enjoy with abandon -without doubt or hesitation. And as this question sprang up in Eleanor's mind, she looked round with a vague idea of doing something that should outweigh that past error \u2014 for which an atonement might be required \u2014 and"], [121, "109 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN give her some right to happiness. It was as though she would \"work off\" what was written against her. It was the idea we most of us have in our minds \u2014 though we may deny it vehemently \u2014 of a debit and credit account. \" But, Eleanor,\" Adrian said, when he had recovered a little from his surprise, \" I am afraid it is scarcely practicable. I don't see how you could undertake such a thing. It has grieved your tender heart to read of the misery that abounds this wintry weather, but I think you must leave stronger hands than yours to grapple with it. Besides, you have not been idle ; you have done what you could for my poor people.\" \" But they have you to look after them, they are not quite forlorn \u2014 not quite forsaken, as some are. Oh, don't refuse me, Adrian,\" Eleanor cried with sudden passionate entreaty. \" My heart is set on it. I want to do this thing alone \u2014 by myself ; I want it to be my money \u2014 my work.\" \" My darling,\" he said gravely, \" if you wish it so strongly, I have no right to reLse. It is a good work and perhaps I was wrong to seek to turn you from it. I must not be afraid for you, or set you apart ; you have elected to live amongst the poor and miserable. Now tell me exactly what you want to do and how I can help you.\""], [122, "110 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. \" Don't praise me, Adrian, or think too highly of me. I am afraid I am not altogether doing this for love of the work, but because I feel I shall be more happy and content when I have done it. I want to have a stall in some very poor part, somewhere round Shoreditch, I think. I should start about twelve o'clock and keep it open till five.\" \" Five hours ? That is a long time, Eleanor. Do you realise what it will mean \u2014 so long an exposure to the severity of a winter night and the loss of sleep ?\" \" Yes, I think I understand. I have not made up my mind hastily. These stalls have generally some kind of a covering over them, I believe, and I shall try to get into a sheltered corner. Besides, I shall not go out more than twice a week, for I do not want to attempt too much, so I shall have time to recover between.\" \" I don't like the idea of your being alone. May I not be there to help you, if necessary ? What would you do supposing you were molested by any rough men or women ?\" \" I don't think poor people often harm those who are trying to serve them, but I mean to enlist the interest and sympathy of the policeman on whose ' beat ' I happen to be, so that I shall have him to turn to in case of need. It is only for a month,"], [123, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 111 Adrian, the worst of the winter will be over by then. Let me try it in my own way.\" And a little reluctantly, a little doubtful of the wisdom of the undertaking, but ready to sym pathise with any act of self-sacrifice, Adrian consented. The announcement of his engagement to Eleanor had been received by the world at large \u2014 or, rather, by that portion of it interested in them \u2014 with considerable surprise and misgiving. \" Mark my words, Madge ; it is a great mistake,\" said Miss Masson, solemnly shaking her head. \" What have they in common \u2014 she, a brilliant woman of the world and he, a man who has given his life to the poor ?\" \" I suppose they like one another well enough to make mutual sacrifices, auntie,\" Madge had replied a little wearily. \" If they are satisfied, that is the principal thing.\" \" She is literally throwing herself away,\" Eleanor's friends had indignantly declared. \" It is a great pity. If she must marry \u2014 though, as a rule, it is a mistake for a literary woman to do so \u2014 why could she not have chosen some one in her own set ? Some one who could have strengthened her literary or social position. Of course it is easy to see what the end will be \u2014 she won't be heard of any more in a year or two's time.\""], [124, "112 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. And the few friends with whom Adrian was still on terms of intimacy and who knew all he had resigned to take up his present work, wondered sorrowfully whether he would not find out pre sently that he had made a terrible mistake. He was not the kind of man to put his hand to the plough and look back, but was he not increasing his own difficulties ; was he not trying to blend irreconcilable qualities ? But the praise or blame of their friends troubled Adrian and Eleanor but little. They were happy and they had unlimited faith in one another ; that was enough. When Madge heard of Eleanor's new idea \u2014 it was confided to her, though to no one else \u2014 she was full of honest admiration. \" It is very brave of you,\" she said. \" I should like to do it myself, but I have not the courage. No one could be more sorry than I am for those poor homeless creatures who wander about the streets at night, but I think I am a little afraid of them too \" \" Your life has been different to mine,\" Eleanor replied. \" I have had to fight my own way in the world and consequently I know something of the seamy side of it. You have been carefully guarded from even the shadow of evil. Don't envy me my experience, Madge. It is better to have the sun-"], [125, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 113 shine and love and roses and never a care in the world !\" \" Ah ! of course it is only those who go out into the world who are called upon to suffer. If you sit at home, you can keep trouble out by locking the doors !\" said Madge a little bitterly. And Eleanor wondered at the tone, so rare an one with Madge. She reproached herself with having been a little careless concerning her friend. Her thoughts were so full of Adrian that perhaps she had neglected Madge ; she had not seen very much of her lately, and it struck her now that she was scarcely looking her usual bright, happy self. She would try and see more of her, and discover whether any thing were really amiss ; it could be nothing serious, Was not this petted child of fortune set apart from any real trouble ? The first night that Eleanor tried her scheme she felt a little nervous and diffident, and when Adrian, who had seen her safely established behind a tempting looking coffee-stall in a wretchedly poor neighbourhood near Shoreditch, had gone away at her request and left her alone, she felt half inclined to wish that she had been less precipitate and had allowed him to remain, at least for the first time. However, it was too late now, and after all what 1"], [126, "114 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. had she to fear ? She had spoken to a policeman, who was near enough to be always within call, and she had only come to give a little bodily warmth and comfort to any poor wanderer who sought it. If she met with little gratitude she thought she need scarcely fear insult or molestation. The stall had been put in a sheltered corner near some buildings that were in course of demolition, and Eleanor, warmly clothed, though quietly enough to escape observation, and excited by her unaccustomed position, scarcely felt the cold. Presently she saw a small urchin, attracted probably by the bright light from the little stove, creep cautiously up. He was a miserable looking little fellow. She could see his pinched, white face, his red, swollen hands, and the wretched rags that scarcely sufficed to cover him. His eyes wandered fur tively from the red light of the stove to the plates of thick bread and butter and the rows of white mugs that stood on the board before her. \" Would you like a cup of coffee ? \" she asked gently. He looked up, evidently half suspicious and inclined to run away ; but hunger and cold were too strong for him, and he nodded his head without a word. Eleanor filled a mug from the large coffee-urn,"], [127, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 115 feeling those eager eyes fixed on her all the time as she added the milk and a large spoonful of sugar. She passed it to him across the table, with a slice of bread and butter. He stretched out his hand to take it, and then drew back. \" I ain't got a copper,\" he said in his hoarse, unchildlike voice, doubtful whether this were not some trap and he might not find himself pounced upon presently for eating and drinking under false pretences. \" It is all right,\" she said, stirred by genuine compassion at the sight of that old-young face, with its sharp, hungry eyes. \" I don't take money ; it is given away.\" He hesitated no longer then, but seizing the mug in one hand and the bread and butter in the other, eat and drank like some famished animal, scuttling off as soon as he had finished, without a word. But for the rest of the night Eleanor was busy enough. The boy evidently told others of his dis covery, and presently from one direction and another, from under arches, from doorsteps, from empty buildings \u2014 from any miserable, deserted place into which they could creep for a few hours' shelter \u2014 in ones and twos, but generally alone, as though misery in its last stage finds no comfort i \u2014 2"], [128, "116 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. in companionship, came Eleanor's customers. Such customers ! \u2014 such a strange, pitiful sight as they made in the greatest and wealthiest city in the world. In spite of the Charity Organisation Society \u2014 and many other Societies ; in spite of the doctrin aires, who declare that no one sleeps in the streets all night \u2014 that no one need starve in London, because there are shelters for the reception of homeless and starving people, it is nevertheless a fact that such things do occur, and that we have not yet found a remedy for this monstrous evil ; for this crying shame. \" I need not have been afraid of them,\" Eleanor said to herself in a moment of leisure. \" Poor creatures, they are far more afraid of me. Half dead with cold and starvation, have they spirit enough left for anything ? But it is surely in this awful patience, this utter hopelessness, which is past all effort, that we should find our most terrible reproach ? No human creature should be brought as low as that.\" Adrian had insisted upon coming himself to fetch Eleanor at five o'clock, and it was with a feeling of relief that she saw him. A night in the heart of poor and miserable London had been an experience to her, which, in spite of her strong nerves and the fact of her being by no means over-sensitive,"], [129, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 117 had touched her more than she would have con sidered possible. \" It is dreadful,\" she said, clinging to his arm as they walked away, when a man had arrived to remove the stall, \" it is dreadful that such things should be. It hurt me most, I think, when any one thanked me ; it was with such pitiful meekness, in such a humble way ! As though every human being had not a right to as much as I gave ! \" \" Some people would tell you the poor creatures you saw had no right to existence at all,\" Adrian replied, \" and it is possible that they themselves have failed to appreciate the boon.\" A week or two later, soon after midnight, when as yet Eleanor had only had one or two appli cants at her stall, a girl came up, and with a muttered greeting, crouched down on the ground by the fire. Eleanor had seen her two or three times before and been interested in her almost against her will. She was repelled and attracted at the same time. It would have been almost a relief not to have seen her again, but being there, the girl's person ality made itself felt. \" Won't you have some coffee ? \" Eleanor said presently, as the figure in its soiled finery, which formed such a poor protection against the biting"], [130, "118 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. wind that was sweeping down the street, still crouched over the fire in unbroken silence. \" No thank you, I don't think I will.\" \" It will warm you. You must be cold on such a night as this.\" \" Yes, I'm cold enough and hungry enough, too, for that matter, but \u2014 but, I don't want you to think that I only come here for what I can get.\" \" Tell me what you come for, then,\" Eleanor said, softening in spite of herself. \" I come to see you.\" \" To see me ? \" \"Yes. I've never seen any one like you before. You're a lady, I know. I wonder why you come here to look after such as us, when you might be enjoying yourself.\" There was nothing objectionable in the girl's voice or in her manner of speaking, there was even a touch of natural refinement about her. \" I come because I feel sorry for you,\" Eleanor said gently, \" and also \" \u2014 somehow, she did not feel that she could tell this girl anything but the truth \u2014 \" because I feel that it does me good to come.\" \" Does you good ? \""], [131, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 119 \" Yes. I am very happy, and I want to do some thing to deserve it.\" She wondered at her own frankness \u2014 she, with whom reserve had grown to be second nature \u2014 but instinctively she felt that she would be understood. That, wide apart as they stood in the world's eyes, there was something in that poor degraded nature akin to her own. It was this knowledge, which pride shrank from accepting, that made her turn from the girl sometimes with a feeling that almost approached repulsion. Her own strong passions, her own self-will, her own defiance of the world, Eleanor saw reflected in the outcast at her feet, though expressing themselves differently through force of circumstances. The girl's quick ears caught the softened tone in Eleanor's voice, and she looked up curiously. \" You are very happy ? \" she said. \" I shouldn't have thought it. There is a look in your face sometimes, which \u2014 which \u2014 well there ! I can't say what I mean, but, somehow, it has seemed to me that you would understand how it feels to be poor and miserable. And,\" shrewdly, \" if you've never been anything but happy, you could'nt understand \u2014 it wouldn't be possible.\" \" I did not say that I had always been happy,\""], [132, "120 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. Eleanor replied a little coldly, \"but that I am now.\" She resented that this girl should be able to read her face. \" But don't trouble about me ; come and have something to eat and drink.\" And this time her offer was accepted. Through the long hours of the night, Eleanor still saw the crouching figure \u2014 the arms encircling the knees, which were drawn up and on which the chin rested, the eyes seemingly fixed immovably on the fire, but the face was half hidden now and she did not know whether the girl were awake or asleep. She had gone back to her former silence, and Eleanor made no attempt to induce her to break it. Between four and five o'clock, that bitterest hour of a winter morning, when the stall was deserted, a man came up and after an enquiring glance and a moment's hesitation, said, \" Will you give me a cup of coffee, please ? \" Eleanor looked up a little surprised. There was something in his voice and manner of speaking that arrested her attention. It was the cultivated voice of a gentleman ; and yet in appearance he was more utterly wretched and forlorn than even most of the poor creatures who came there. She silently filled a mug and handed it to him."], [133, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 121 He took it from her with a murmured \" Thank you,\" and put a penny down on the counter. \" I don't take payment,\" she said gently, pushing it back to him. \" Any one is welcome to what there is here.\" He put down the mug with the coffee untouched. \"I hope you will let me pay,\" he said. \"I could not take it otherwise.\" He spoke gently enough, but evidently meant what he said, and Eleanor took the proffered coin without another word. \" Thank you,\" he said with a faint melancholy smile. \" It seems ridiculous for such an one as I to have any pride, does it not ? But it is all I have left, and so I suppose I cling to it.\" \" I understand,\" she said. \" I should do the same in your place.\" He drank the coffee, slowly and carefully, as Eleanor was not accustomed to seeing it drunk there, and then turned to go. \" Won't you stay a little longer ? \" she said impulsively. \" It is warmer here than in the streets.'' Then, fearful of wounding the man's sensitive feelings, she added hastily, \" But I beg your pardon ; perhaps you are going home.\" \" Home ? \" he repeated, with the faint reflection of a smile, but without any bitterness \u2014 \" Home ! I"], [134, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 122 have forgotten what that means. I have been sitting on the trestles over there,\" pointing to the opposite side of the street, \" for the last three hours. But it was not too warm, and I began to feel that if I did not move soon, I should never move again. Not that that would have mattered much,\" with a shrug of the shoulders ; \" indeed I should prefer it to the workhouse.\" \" But stay here now a little while,\" Eleanor entreated. \" Surely, you can do that.\" It made her heart ache to look at him. She saw that he was half frozen and more than half starved, and yet he did not complain, and she could not but respect as well as pity him. Whatever it might be that had brought him so low, there must be some thing in a nature that even at such a pass would ask no pity ; would receive no alms. \" I should like to,\" he said, looking wistfully at the bright stove, \" but I am afraid I can't. It is time I was off. I may pick up a job at one of the markets.\" \" But you are not fit to do anything ; you are not strong enough,\" Eleanor still persisted. \" Wait here till the morning and I could find you some thing then ; if, indeed, you must work.\" He looked at her a moment silently with his bright, sunken eyes, and she fancied his lips quivered."], [135, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 123 \" God bless you,\" he said then very softly. \" I shan't forget you. It has been good to see a lady's face again ; to hear a lady's voice. But it is better I should go now \u2014 much better. I am not fit company for you.\" Then before she could make any further remon strance, he was gone. She watched the stooping, emaciated figure as it crept slowly away, staggering a little now and again from sheer weakness, but still going on until it was lost to sight. Then she gave a little regret ful sigh. She would have liked to have helped this man. An hour or two later he was found by a passing policeman lying on the pavement, stiff and motion less \u2014 dead. And at the inquest that followed, the jury, instructed by the divisional surgeon, reluc tantly enough, because such a verdict produces a momentary feeling of discomfort even in the most callous, came to the conclusion that death was due to nothing else than exposure and starvation. And the poor human unit, whom no one came to claim, found an end to his troubles in a pauper's grave. Eleanor looked for him a night or two after wards, hoping she might see him again, but when a week had passed and he did not come, she gave up expecting him, and by the time her month's work was over he was forgotten by her too."], [136, "124 CHAPTER IX. \" When I began to love you, 'Twas like the beginning of June, Like the dewy birth of the morning, Or the swell of the first lark's tune. All grew so bright, so gracious, So full of mystery sweet, Such a deep and dear enchantment Had bound me hands and feet.\" Eleanor was spending an hour or two at Por chester Terrace one evening, Adrian Walmesley being also there. They were sitting round the fire in the drawing-room, a cosy party of four, in a state of idle enjoyment. The March wind, which was blowing outside, possibly made the light and warmth of the luxurious room all the pleasanter by contrast. Madge seemed quite her old self to night. Indeed, her spirits were so good as to be even a trifle boisterous ; she rattled off the most amusing nonsense, almost without a break, and"], [137, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 125 Eleanor told herself that she had been needlessly disquieted on her account. \" How you can live with Mrs. Foster, Eleanor,\" Madge was saying, \" passes my understanding. Her amiability is so intense and so indestructible that it is almost a vice ; indeed, it is more irritating than many vices. And her density is on a par with her amiability. I tried her with one of my best anecdotes the other day and it fell as flat as the proverbial pancake.\" \" Poor Mrs. Foster. I am sorry she has such a bad effect on you, Madge. She is harmless enough, though certainly it is astonishing what a capacity she has for missing a joke.\" \" Yes, it was the other afternoon when you left me alone with her. We had had over Shake speare and the musical glasses, and I felt perfectly pumped \u2014 don't be shocked, auntie ! \u2014 when, all at once, I saw land.

As he passed, the usual turnip, white sheet, and lanthorn of the conventional ghost was sub mitted to his gaze, with the customary weird howls. Tim, however, simply looked fixedly at the apparition for a moment, and remarked, ' Arrah, now ! and is it a general resurrection, or are ye just taking a walk by yerself ? ' \" Well,\" with portentous calmness, \" what do you think she said ? \" They shook their heads, laughing, and gave it up. \"'Really, Miss Harvey! How brave of him not to be frightened !

I felt that it had gone beyond my feeble skill ; that it was a case for a surgical operation.\" \" I am afraid I must go now,\" Adrian said presently. \" There is a man I want to see to-night who is very ill, and I must not be late for fear of disturbing him.\" \" But it is scarcely nine o'clock yet,\" Miss Masson remonstrated, loth to see the circle broken."], [139, "TFIE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 127 \" It will be ten before I get home,\" he said smiling. \" But I need not disturb anyone else I hope, and I know you will be kind enough to excuse my running away.\" \" Well, I know when you have made up your mind it is of no use to say anything, so I won't grumble,\" she replied. \" But you must leave Eleanor behind you. I will send her home in the brougham by-and-bye.\" \" I think I will go now, too, if you don't mind,\" Eleanor said. \" It would be a shame to trouble you to send me home. I will walk a little way with Adrian, and then he can put me in a hansom. I have been very idle lately, and there is some work I really ought to do to-night.\" Miss Masson entreated and remonstrated in vain, and, reluctantly enough, she was eventually obliged to let them take their departure together. \" I really am beginning to think I made a mistake, Madge,\" she said to her niece when they were alone. \" They seem so well suited to one another in most respects, and so happy and \u2014 and all that, that perhaps their having led such different lives won't matter so much.\" \" Perhaps not, auntie. Is there any talk of the wedding yet, do you know ? What are they waiting for ? Why don't they get married and have done with it ? \""], [140, "128 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. Madge spoke a little pettishly. Her spirits seemed to have dropped all at once, and her face, now that the smile had gone from it, looked a little worn and tired. \" Really, Madge, such haste would be almost indecent ! You forget they have scarcely been engaged two months.\" \" Is that all? It seems ages. I don't think engaged people are very interesting except to one another, do you, auntie ?'' throwing herself down suddenly at Miss Masson's feet and nestling her head in her lap. \" I don't think there is much to complain of in Eleanor and Adrian, Madge. There is none of that objectionable behaviour which is so common among young people of the present day. They always seem pleased to be with us, instead of wanting to go away in a corner, or looking at one another as though there were no one else in the room, and that sort of ridiculous nonsense. But I thought you and Eleanor were such friends, child ? \" \"So we are, auntie, but I seem to have lost half of her since this engagement. Perhaps it will come right again presently. It is not more her fault than mine.\" \" Well, of course, dear, you must expect it to make a difference. Naturally Adrian takes up a"], [141, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 129 good deal of her time and thoughts now. My little Madge will understand all about that by-and-bye when her turn comes,\" patting the bright head in her lap, with a little wise smile. \" It will never come, auntie \u2014 never,\" her niece retorted with unnecessary vehemence. \" I am going to live with you always, so it is of no use trying to get rid of me. You have never married \u2014 and you are one of the happiest and most contented people I know \u2014 so why should I ? \" \" Ah, my dear,\" with a little expressive sigh, \" there is a history attached to that, but I would rather not talk about it. You have heard me speak of 'John'?\" \u2014 Madge thought she had \u2014 \" Well, if it had not been for him I should not be Lucy Masson now. But,\" with a certain gentle decision, \" I shall always be faithful to John.\" \" Of course you will, dear, and so shall I ; so that brings it back to what I said at first \u2014 we will both live and die in single-blessedness.\" And then Madge got up, and kissing her aunt, said she was tired and would go to bed. Adrian would not let Eleanor walk far, the wind was too cold, and as his way lay in a different direction to hers and he had no time to spare, he was obliged to put her in a hansom and let her go home alone. K"], [142, "130 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. \" I shall come to see you to-morrow, if possible,\" he said as he held out his hand. \" Something about the parish. I want your advice.\" \"You are quite welcome to it if you think it worth having,\" she replied with a laugh. \" Come in the afternoon ; one can settle all the affairs of the nation over a cup of tea.\" \" Well, good-bye, darling. Take care of yourself, and don't sit up working too late.\" Then the cab drove off and Adrian went on his way. It seemed to him that the world had grown very young and bright lately, even that despised quarter in which he had made his home. He looked at his poor helpless people \u2014 at the squalor and misery by which he was surrounded \u2014 through a mist \u2014 the mist of happiness, than which there is nothing more deceiving. It can effect a veritable transformation. The pity of it is, that the deeper this rosy glow, the less likely it js to last ; it may swim before us one moment and the next \u2014 it is gone, and again the world, naked and unashamed, lies open to our eyes. Adrian was thinking of what his life would be with Eleanor, with this stately, queenly creature, who could be so sweet and womanly with him ; of the good they would strive to do, working side by side on an equal footing. For he held that a"], [143, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 131 woman, God's noblest gift to man, should be indeed his helpmate ; not a creature to amuse his leisure hours, or to merge her existence in his. \" I think I must have loved her from the first moment I saw her,\" he mused as he went along, \" though I did not know it. I had never thought of love, my life was such a busy one, it seemed too full and too hard for such dreams. And then, when I began to understand, I fought against it ; she was so far above me and it seemed to me that in seeking such an one, I should be neglecting the work I had chosen. But I need fear that no longer. We are one in heart and soul, and instead of weakening, she will strengthen my hands.\" And thinking thus, his heart grew very light and tender and full of gratitude for the precious gift that had come to him, and the enchanting mist rose up on every side. k \u2014 2"], [144, "132 CHAPTER X. \" There is no strange handwriting on the wall, Thro' all the midnight hum no threatening call, Nor on the marble floor the stealthy fall Of fatal footsteps.

He probably heard me come in, and he may think I am afraid to face him if I hesitate any longer.\" And with head erect and a look of haughty surprise on her face she went to meet Dudley Graham. He put out his hand as though they had parted the best of friends. \" How do you do, Miss Monroe ? It is quite a long while since I had the pleasure of seeing you.\" \" If you remember the last time you were here, I am surprised that you should have come again,\" she said, ignoring his outstretched hand, and still standing. \" Ah ! I think we did not part quite amicably ; a great mistake\u2014 a very great mistake \u2014 under any circumstances. May I say that I regret it was so, and will you shake hands now and be friends ? \" \" I think it would be best if we were to see as little of one another as possible, and remain the merest acquaintances. Our lives run in different directions and we are not suited for friends.\" \" It is a pity you think so, as I propose to myself to know and see more of you than I have been able to do hitherto.\""], [146, "134 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. He spoke with quiet assurance, facing her as he stood ; his easy grace never forsaking him for a moment, his musical voice calm and unruffled. Eleanor flushed indignantly. \" You have come, it appears, merely to continue the insults of last time. I shall have less patience now than then. I will wish you good-night, Mr. Graham, and I shall give my servants instructions that you are not to be admitted again,'' and she moved towards the bell. He stretched out his hand. \" Wait a moment,\" he said. \" You will regret it afterwards if you send me away now.\" Her hand still rested on the bell, but she looked up. \"You had better listen quietly to what I have to say,\" he went on. \" You don't suppose I should have come here, knowing what reception I was likely to meet with, unless I were prepared to stand my ground ? You have too much sense not to see that. I would rather you had listened to me in a friendly spirit, but in any case you must listen, and as my story will take a little time, would it not be better to sit down ? \" And drawing up a chair for her, he took another himself a little way off. Eleanor still hesitated. Should she risk all and"], [147, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 135 ring the bell and have him shown with ignominy out of the house ? It would be worth a good deal to do that. There was a cool insolence in his tone and a certain suppressed power in his whole bearing which almost maddened her. She would have liked to have dashed her hand in his face as he stood looking at her with contemplative, admiring eyes, his lips curved in a faint smile. But afterwards, that was it \u2014 afterwards, what would happen ? As he said, he was not a man to take up a position which he could not support. \" Come,\" he said persuasively, \" be wise ; sit down and hear what I have to say. If you want to turn me out afterwards I will offer no opposition.\" And slowly and reluctantly Eleanor took her hand from the bell and sat down. \" I cannot imagine what you can have to say that will interest or concern me,\" she said coldly ; \" but as you are here I will listen to you. It will be for the last time, however, so say all you want and please make it as short as possible,\" and she leant back in her chair with half-closed eyes. The man seemed to enjoy her disdain. \" I like you all the better for taking it this way,'* he said. \" I admire your courage. Some women would have whined and whimpered, but you are not that sort.\""], [148, "136 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. Her eyes flashed up at him. \" Tell your story, sir, and spare me your compliments.\" \" Certainly. Well, you must know that when you left me, rather sans ceremonie, on the night I had the honour of making a certain proposal to you, I went away fully resolved not to give you up. Your opposition only made me the more determined. It was rather a mistake on my part perhaps to have told you of my intentions, to have shown you my hand so plainly ; but I am bound to own that I lost my head for a moment \u2014 a thing that does not often happen with me. But I do not think it has done any harm. I venture to guess that you have not even confided the subject of our conversation to Mr. Adrian Walmesley \u2014 to your affianced husband ? \" The last sentence was put in the tone of a question, but Eleanor gave not the slightest sign in reply. \" Ah ! I see I am right. And yet, was it not a little strange that you should have withheld such a confidence ? That knowing I was, at least, on terms of acquaintanceship with your lover, you should not have told him of the frankness which so offended you ; of what, I think, you were pleased to call my ' impertinence ' ? No answer ? Well, we won't press the point. We will even"], [149, "137 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. say, if you like, that it was due to the natural reserve and self-reliance which is so salient a feature of your character.\" \"You are wandering from the point, sir, Eleanor's haughty tones reminded him. \" So I am. I beg your pardon ; it shall not occur again. I was about to say that when I got back to my chambers I had recovered my com posure, and I sat down to look the situation calmly in the face, and to consider what was best to be done. I was like a general contemplating to-morrow's battle-field when he knows that the enemy is far stronger than he. I was fully determined by fair means or foul to make you mine ; but I did not yet see how it was to be done.\" Did he take a delight in keeping her in suspense, or did he wish to compensate himself for the scorn with which she had treated him by making her wait his pleasure now ? For though an honest burst of rage was a thing which Dudley Graham never indulged in, he was not above the meaner passion of revenge, and was careful to obtain sooner or later a full equivalent for any offence against himself. \" Well, to be brief, not seeing how fair means would avail me with you \u2014 I had tried them already and been put on one side with scant ceremony \u2014 I"], [150, "138 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. naturally thought of the other course. I would rather not have done anything underhand, but then, unluckily, we cannot always have things as we like. So I began to wonder what was the weak point in your armour. There is a weak point in most people's armour, you know ; the thing is to discover it. You will acknowledge \" \u2014 parenthetically \u2014 \" that I am quite frank with you ? \" \" Perfectly. But you will excuse me for saying that at the same time you are a little tedious.\" \" I hope to be more interesting presently. If I could find the weak place it would give me a certain hold over you. If it were more than weak \u2014 a gaping rent \u2014 I might even get you entirely into my power and be able to make my own terms. I had always thought there was something in your past life you wished to hide, you were so silent con cerning it ; even your most intimate friends knew so little about you. Besides, your face is the face of a woman with a history. So I soon decided that it was with your past I had to do ; that there lay my only hope. I had heard Madge say that at one time, before the publication of your first book, you had lived at Finsbury Park, and eventually I decided to start operations there.\" \" It is a pity you should have missed your voca-"], [151, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 139 tion ; you would have made an excellent detective, I am sure,\" Eleanor said, disdainfully. But Dudley noticed that she showed one sign of weakness : her hands, which had been lying idly in her lap, were now clasped together. \" It was a little mistake on your part, I think,\" he went on, as though he had not heard her, \" that you mentioned where you had lived, though you did not make it very definite \u2014 Finsbury Park is a large place. Still, one cannot be too careful on these points and the name of that, no doubt, eminently respectable, but somewhat dreary locality put one end of the clue in my hand, at the other end of which I found . But I am getting on too fast. \" I did not think it likely you had occupied a whole house while you were living there, still I took the precaution of looking through the local directory for a year or two back, but, as I expected, did not find the name of Miss Eleanor Monroe. It would have taken a long time to have gone round to all the houses that let lodgings, or to have inter viewed all the families that received boarders, so I put that on one side as a last resource, and decided to take the shops first. It was evident that you must have been, even if only in a small way, a customer at some of them, possibly even a regular customer, in which case your name and address would probably be known, and that obtained I"], [152, "140 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. could soon discover whether or not there were any thing to warrant my suspicions. Well, I tried the principal street first, but without success ; no one had ever heard your name. Then I fell back on the smaller shops \u2014 and here I was more successful.\" He waited a moment, but Eleanor did not speak. It might almost have seemed that she held her breath, so still and motionless was she. \" It was at a newspaper shop that my quest ended,\" he went on. \" I had told my usual tale \u2014 that I was in search of a friend, a Miss Eleanor Monroe, whose address I had lost \u2014 and had asked if they happened to know the name, when, to my satisfaction, the proprietor, after a little considera tion, said he thought he did \u2014 leastways, it seemed familiar. . \" I suggested that he should look whether it were in his books, and he obligingly did so, and found that about two years ago he was in the habit of lending the Times daily to a Miss Monroe, who lived at No. 12, Hart Street. He thought she was a governess, or something of that sort, and wanted to look over the advertisements. He often lent the more expensive papers, he informed me, for a small charge. I said I had no doubt this was the young lady I wanted, and having thanked him for his trouble, I left the shop with the address in -ny pocket.\""], [153, "141 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. Dudley Graham waited again, but still Eleanor did not speak. Only her face had hardened into a fixed, rigid look. \" Well, it was all plain sailing after that. I went to Hart Street and asked if Miss Monroe were living there. The landlady, who opened the door, and who fortunately happened to be the same Mrs. Smith who was there two years ago, looked at me in surprise. \" ' A young lady of that name did live with me once,' she said, ' but she left some time ago. ' I said I was very sorry as I wanted to see her particularly. She was evidently rather inquisitive and quite ready for a gossip, and as I hesitated she asked me if I would like to come in a minute and sit down. I accepted, and when she had taken me into her little sitting-rocm, I said I was anxious to find Miss Monroe as I had some news of importance for her. \" ' Well, if it's good news, I'm sure I hope you'll find her,' she said, ' for a more deserving, hard working young lady I never knew. It used to make my heart ache sometimes to see her working away from morning till night and not caring a bit about her meals. But she was a trifle stand-offish and I didn't like to say much.' \" I recognised that description,\" Dudley broke off to say."], [154, "142 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. \" I asked if she knew where Miss Monroe had gone when she left her, and she said no, she had not given any address. She had only said she was going into the country to a situation. \" ' It is my belief,' Mrs. Smith added, confiden tially, 'that she couldn't abide the house after old Mr. Hunt died \u2014 I know it quite upset me \u2014 and that she was glad to get away.' \" I enquired why that should be, and was in formed that Mr. Hunt, who occupied the room next to Miss Monroe, had died very suddenly one night of heart-disease. She, Mrs. Smith, had herself found him dead in bed in the morning. \" ' What sort of a man was this Mr. Hunt ?' I enquired, with but little interest. '\" A mean, miserly old man,' replied Mrs. Smith, viciously. ' He wasn't much loss to the world, that's one thing. Why, he was worth hundreds of pounds and yet he'd look at a sixpence as though it was his last ! And I shouldn't think his nephew, who came in for most of his money, was much better.' \" ' Why ?' I asked. \" ' Well, when he came down here after the old man's death and went up to his room to collect his things, it appears that there wasn't as much money in the safe as he expected. And a fine fuss he made.'"], [155, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 143 \" ' Indeed. How was that ?' \" ' I don't remember the exact rights of it \u2014 it's so long ago now \u2014 but he told some tale about a memorandum, or something of that sort, which he had found in the safe, and on which he said his uncle had written down how much money he had there at the time of his death. And he had the impudence to say that there was /\"150 short.' \" One hundred and fifty pounds short,\" repeated Dudley, impressively. \" ' Of course,' Mrs. Smith went on to say, ' I soon let him see that I wasn't going to stand that. How could he prove, indeed, that the money had been there ? His uncle never let the key of the safe go out of his hand ; even at night he kept it under his pillow, so who could have robbed him, even if they had wished ? Besides, there was no one but me and Miss Monroe in the house at the time, as I told him, and he hadn't the face to say any more then, though I could see he wasn't quite happy about it. I haven't patience with such mean, suspicious ways.' \" ' And Miss Monroe, you say, left you a few weeks afterwards ?' \" ' Yes. Of course I didn't worry her about what the precious nephew had said \u2014 she was a lady and I knew what was due to her too well for that \u2014 but she didn't seem to fancy the house after what had"], [156, "144 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. happened. She got thinner and looked a bit white and scared-like sometimes, which wasn't to be wondered at being alone upstairs next that room at night. So I wasn't altogether surprised when she told me she was going, though I was sorry enough, for she was a good lodger and never gave no trouble.' \" As Dudley Graham finished speaking he crossed one leg lightly over the other, and, leaning back in his chair, looked at Eleanor. She was always pale, but now the pallor of her face was ghastly and deathlike, and though she still held her head haughtily erect, her eyes were hidden. \"Well ?\" he said, interrogatively, after a few minutes, as she showed no sign of speaking. \" Well, is it necessary for me to go on ? Is it necessary to tell you how I went to the publisher who brought out ' Reaping the Whirlwind,' and by means of an introduction and a little tact found out that you had paid for the publication of your book yourself, after having taken it away a few weeks previously without apparently contemplating such a course ? Considering your mode of life at Finsbury Park, it is, to say the least of it, a little surprising that you should have been able to afford such a heavy expense.\" He waited a moment to see the effect of his"], [157, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 145 words, and was about to speak again when she said, looking up at last and meeting his eyes : \" And to what does all this tend ? What con clusion do you wish me to draw from your story ? Don't be afraid to speak out. It would be a little late in the day to consider my feelings.\" \"To put it plainly then, I am afraid everything points to the conclusion that this old man's nephew was right in his suspicions. That was miss ing from his uncle's safe and that \" \" Well ? \" with a defiant smile, as he hesitated. \" \u2014 That it was taken by you, and used for the publication of your book,\" he said, boldly. \" A \u2014 h ! \" drawing a long breath. \" And suppose I deny everything ; how are you to prove the truth of this extraordinary assertion ? \" \" I think there would be little difficulty about that. I should say the circumstantial evidence was almost perfect.\" \" Suppose, for one moment, that this money was taken by a lodger in the house whose name was Monroe, it does not necessarily follow that I am the same person.\" \" It is not a common name,\" he said, calmly. \" But, of course, it would be easy for you to see Mrs. Smith, and if she does not recognise you, I will apologise as humbly as you wish for my unfortunate mistake.\" 1."], [158, "146 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. She was silent a minute, and he was about to say something further, when she sprang up, crying in a hoarse, half-strangled voice, as though fight ing for breath to speak : \" Stop ! That will do. You have hunted me down \u2014 you have tracked my secret ; you have told the whole miserable story in your cruel, sneering way \u2014 now stop ! I have had enough.\""], [159, "147 CHAPTER XL \" Across the land, and from sea to sea, Plashing and plunging through many rivers, Recklessly, wearily, desperately, Ban nor blessing, nor thing that severs, Can sever the tie 'twixt him and me.

How can one touch what does not exist ? I am quiet enough now,\" sitting down again ; \"let me hear"], [161, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 149 what it all means. Why did you tell me this story ? What are your terms ? \" \" Is that not rather a brutal way of putting it ? \" he said, deprecatingly. She shot a swift glance of disdain at him. \" It is a way you will understand at all events,\" she replied. \" Well ? \" \" You wish to know why I have hunted out your secret ; why I have tried to get you into my power ? It is because I love you \u2014 because I cannot live without you.\" \" Spare me your protestations at least. Do not speak of what you cannot understand. Love.

Tell me what my secret is worth to you ; but do not speak to me of\u2014 love.\" Her words cut like a whip, and a faint flush rose to his cheeks. \" Is it wise to try and make an enemy of me ? \" he asked, sullenly. \" Call it by what name you like, it is a passion strong enough to make me move heaven and earth to win you ; strong enough to make me do a good deal that the world, no doubt, would consider unworthy of a gentleman.

Better keep the softer side up.\" There was a ring of truth, of unalterable determination in his words, which made Eleanor's heart beat faster. \" What do you mean ? \" she asked, but her voice had lost its defiant ring. \" I don't understand you. What is the use of talking to me of love, when you know that I am Adrian Walmesley's affianced wife ?\" \" You asked me my terms just now for keeping your secret,\" he said, with a strange smile. \"Yes. \"Well, they are that you break off your present engagement and \u2014 put me in Adrian Walmesley's place.\" Had she half expected it ?

You might as well say that with any death brought on by excitement, the person who was the primary cause of that excitement would be accountable for the death. I think such a theory would hardly hold water.\" Eleanor scarcely heeded what he said. It had been a certain relief to speak out, even to this man, after having carried her secret about so long in her own breast and she hoped that by it she might move him to pity and let her go. \" You see,\" she went on, \"I have suffered ; my life has not been a happy one.

The more so, perhaps, that she felt there was a certain amount of truth in what he said. \" I should try to live up to his ideal,\" she said. \" When I married him I should put the past on one side, I should have done with it. I would start afresh, taking his principles, his opinions, as my guide.\" \" And you think it would be so easy to forget ? \" he replied. \" You have found it so simple up to the present ? Don't you know that what has been must always be ; that there is no such thing as oblivion ? \" \" My will is strong,\" she said, \" and I could put my past on one side, even if I could not forget it.

Then,\" turning away with a despairing gesture, \" God help me, for there is no help in man,\" and falling heavily into a chair, she hid her face in her hands. \" Eleanor,\" Dudley said hoarsely, after a minute, \" Eleanor, it is useless for me to say I will leave you alone, for I know I could not do it. If I gave you up to-day, I should come back and claim you to-morrow. There is only one course open to you if you will save yourself from my hands. Tell the whole truth to Adrian and let him judge you. In this way you rob me of my power, and I have no farther hold on you.\" \" No \u2014 no ! I cannot do it \u2014 I cannot ! \" she cried. \"Anything but that ! Let me suffer \u2014 break my heart \u2014 put any burden you will on me, but let me be able to look him in the face still. It would kill me to see his love turn to loathing and contempt. How could his pure nature understand my temptation ? You are right,\" bitterly, \" what have I in common with him ? And he would"], [172, "160 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. suffer \u2014 yes, he would suffer terribly if he knew all ; if he knew what manner of woman it was whom he had set up and worshipped. Let him think that my faults are as the faults of any woman \u2014 incon stancy, uncertainty, ignorance of her own heart and her own wishes \u2014 so, though I fall from my high estate, I may still keep his friendship. Let him not know that I am \u25a0 \u2014 what I am.\" For once Dudley could find no words in reply. \"And you,\" she said presently, looking up, \"well, you have won the victory, but I wonder whether you will find the spoils worth having ? One day you may come to regret that you did not show a little mercy to the woman whom fate delivered bound into your hands. It might have been a pleasant thought to you at some time to remember that you gave back a forfeited happiness ; that you earned one creature's eternal gratitude. Well! I will say no more. What use are any words ? It is all settled; it is all done with. I have nothing more to hope or to fear.\" Dudley rose from his seat. \" I will go now,\" he said, uncertainly. \" I know I have deserved it \u2014 but don't hate me if you can help it. At least I can promise you that I will leave you in peace for the present ; that I will not press my claim on you. If you break"], [173, "161 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. off with Adrian that is all I will ask now. Perhaps after a little while \" and then he hesitated and said no more. \" Yes, go now,\" she said, quietly, her tearless, despairing eyes fixed on the dying fire. \" I am very tired, I don't think I could bear any more to-night. I am in your hands and you can make your own terms. Leave me in peace for a little while. You must be quite satisfied I think ; you have only to command and I must obey.\" And Dudley Graham went away without attempting a reply. M"], [174, "162 CHAPTER XII. \" O Wedding-Guest ! this soul has been Alone on a wide, wide sea. So lonely 'twas, that God himself Scarce seemed there to be.\" As the door closed behind him, Eleanor looked slowly round. She gave a faint sigh of relief when she saw that she was really alone, and pressing her hands over her eyes for a minute, with a little bewildered gesture, rose slowly from her chair. She moved like one in a dream, scarcely conscious, apparently, of what she was doing. Walking up and down the little room with her hands clasped in front of her, she muttered to herself now and again in a disconnected way. \" I must be dreaming,\" she said ; \"it cannot be true. I have not lost Adrian. I am not,\" with a shudder, \" going to marry that other man. I shall wake up presently and laugh at myself for being so"], [175, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 163 foolish. I have been happy such a little while ; it cannot be over yet \u2014 it cannot. And yet it seems so real, and he was here but a short time ago. Oh,\" with a sudden cry of anguish, \" what does it all mean ? What has happened ? How long is it since Adrian said good-bye to me and we were so happy ? It is impossible,\" with feverish energy, \" that a few hours can have made such a difference, without any preparation, without a note of warning \u2014 oh, no one's happiness could come to an end so swiftly as that ! It would be too cruel.\" P'or a little while she paced up and down in silence, then suddenly she went up to a silver mirror that hung on the wall and looked at herself with steady, critical eyes. \"You are sane enough,\" she ejaculated, after a moment, with a little laugh. \" Perhaps it would be better for you if you were not, and it is of no use trying to deceive yourself. It is no dream ; it is horrible \u2014 most horrible reality. My God,\" with a little moaning cry, \" have pity on the most miserable creature on Thy earth to-night ! \" and she fell prone on the floor, with no merciful lapse of consciousness, but battling with her agony, as one battles with physical pain. The fight was too fierce to last long. In a little while she was calm and quiet again, but pale and M 2"], [176, "164 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. exhausted, as though the struggle had swept the best part of her life and youth away. But she could reason with herself now, and look the future in the face. \" There is one way in which I could escape from it all, only one,\" she thought. \" I could die \u2014 I am not afraid of death. But what does it mean ? \u2014 a dreamless sleep \u2014 rest \u2014 oblivion, or a state in which we still know what is happening to those we have left behind ? Ah ! that I could not bear. My death might create suspicion, and Dudley Graham \u2014 I could not feel sure of him. He would not forgive me for having escaped him and he would tell Adrian my secret, and, if I were to know that, what torture it would be ! To be powerless to say a word on my own behalf ; to look on from afar and be able to put in no plea for pity and forgiveness ! \u2014 that would make death worse than life. No ; to make my secret safe, I must live. Some find it hard to die when they leave a stainless memory to those they love ; but if by dying I could purchase that, I would be well content ! \" She dragged herself wearily to her feet. \" It is getting late,\" she murmured, \" and I am very tired\u2014 tired enough to sleep soundly to-night, though misery will lie down with me and be ready for me in the morning.

Always seeking for happiness \u2014 always craving for love \u2014 and now finding it, only to have to put it away from me with my own hands ! It would seem,\" bitterly, \"that an inscrutable Providence uses some of us as experiments to ascertain how much human nature can bear. And I,\" with a little laugh \u2014 \"I am an experiment.\" When we have been stricken with a sudden sorrow, to awaken the morning after to the recollection of it. when for a little while we have escaped from its dreadful presence \u2014 >vhen we may even have dreamt that we were happy \u2014 is surely the hardest part of all.

We must rise up \u00a3nd go forth. The better for us if we can show a brave front to the world, though our heart may be breaking ; but in any case, we must take our place. Eleanor, when she awoke, hid her face for a moment in the pillows, shrinking from the ordeal that awaited her ; and then, for she was no coward she turned round with defiant eyes."], [178, "166 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. \" There is no escape,\" she said. \" I made up my mind to that last night. Life is over for me as far as happiness is concerned, but at least I can endure in silence, and it is something that I can suffer alone. I shall be humiliated by no contemptuous pity, by no scornful compassion. And after all,\" bitterly, \" 1 have not been spoilt by overmuch happiness. It should not come strange to me to be lonely and miserable again.\" She remembered that Adrian had said he would call and see her in the afternoon, and she felt that she could not meet him yet. She must have a little time to recover first, and she had to make up her mind what she should say to him when he did come. At present she could form no plans. She was still too overwhelmed by what had happened to decide what was best to be done ; upon the gentlest way of dealing the blow. She knew with what crushing force it must fall, hower tender she might wish to be, and she shrank from making him suffer even a tithe of what she herself had suffered last night and suffered at this present moment. Eventually, after breakfast, she wrote Adrian a few lines, postponing his visit till the following afternoon. She could settle to nothing that morning. She wandered from one room into another, restlessly arranging and disarranging the contents, taking up"], [179, "167 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. a book only to put it down again the next moment, and, altogether, behaving so unlike her usual composed, business-like self, that even her unob servant companion looked up at last in surprise and was led to enquire whether anything were the matter. But being curtly answered in the negative, subsided again behind her knitting. Presently, Eleanor remembered with a feeling of relief that she had to see her publisher upon a little matter of business ; she would go into the City at once ; anything that took her out of her own thoughts, even if only for a little while, would be welcome. She felt as though she should go mad if she stayed in the house much longer, wondering what she was to do. At one moment bitterly regretting the chance that had given her secret into Dudley's hands ; at another, torturing herself with thinking of all that might have been, and that now was never to be. Her business over \u2014 and her publisher noticed that his client was not as bright and clear-headed as usual, indeed, that she seemed dull and ab stracted and looked worn and overworked \u2014 Eleanor wondered what she should do now. The afternoon was drawing to a close, but she was in no haste to get home ; she felt as if it would stifle her to be shut up in the house with her secret ; she shuddered at the thought of the"], [180, "168 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. long, silent evening and the lonely night, when there would be nothing to distract her thoughts \u2014 nothing to draw her attention away from her own misery. Now, when she was one of the crowd, when men and women were hurrying by, and life at its busiest was around her, she could thrust thought into the background ; the world deadened her pain ; but by-and-bye how would it be ? Suppose her misery grew too great for her, and she broke silence and told what she had done and what her punishment was to be ? No ; she was not fit to go home yet. She must grow more composed first ; she must tire herself out. It was all so new as yet ; the horror and the pain were so fresh ;. by-and-bye she would grow more accustomed to her burden and learn to bear it better. If it broke her heart, what matter ? And, besides, hearts don't break nowadays. There is a physical raisoit d'etre for everything ; a something tangible, that can be laid hold of. Eleanor had scarcely eaten anything all day, and presently, feeling faint and tired, she went into a restaurant for a cup of tea. She could not eat anything, but the tea refreshed her, and she stayed a little while, looking with a vague interest at the occupants of the little tables around her, wondering if there could be one amongst them half as lonely"], [181, "169 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. and miserable as she was. Her weary eyes lingered on any bright, laughing face, as though there were something strange in the sight ; as though, between her and such careless happiness, there was a great gulf fixed. Then she went out into the street again. She was walking listlessly along, when she noticed a grey stone church standing a little apart from the busy thoroughfare. Her attention was drawn to it by the door being half open, and by seeing a dim light inside. She hesitated a moment. She was not a religious woman, but the quiet little church appealed to her ; it was old and time worn, and so many troubled souls must have sought comfort in it ; so many weary feet must have passed over that threshold. Ah, but surely none more weary than hers ! Unconsciously, she went a step nearer. Evidently it was free to all to enter ; why should she not go in ? She could sit there a little while and rest, and then come away. There is something in the atmosphere of a church that is soothing in itself and peace-giving, a fact which the Roman Catholics wisely recognise by leaving their churches always open. Hesitating no longer, Eleanor pushed open the door and went in. The church was empty, and, breathing a little sigh of relief, she sat down in one of the pews. For a little while she did not move, but presently she fell"], [182, "170 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN, on her knees and buried her face in her clasped hands. No words came through her parted lips, perhaps even her heart uttered no prayer ; but for one moment, at least, she flung herself down before a higher power, appealing to it by force of her own dumb misery. \" If there were any help \u2014 if there could be any help !\" she muttered half aloud, not asking, because it seemed so hopeless to ask, and because she did not know whether there were any to answer. The God whom as a child she had been taught to worship was a shadowy but awful God, not a Being to be approached in time of trouble. As she learnt to think and reason for herself she had rejected this Divinity, whose justice was so hard, and who had no mercy, and had put nothing else in His place. Latterly, since she had known Adrian, she had tried to adopt his views, and had succeeded in deceiving him, if not her self, so that he thought, even if her mind had been a little tainted with the want of faith of the age, that was past and done with, and now she was ready and eager to believe as he believed. He did not know that what she said and did was for love of him. She knelt there a little while, murmuring a few inarticulate words now and again, scarcely con scious of what she was doing. By-and-bye she"], [183, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 171 rose slowly from her knees. As she turned round to leave the pew a gentleman in clerical dress came up to her. '\u2022 I beg your pardon,\" he said, hesitating. \" I came out of the vestry a few minutes ago, not knowing any one was here, and \u2014 and I am afraid you are in trouble. Can I help you in any way ? I hope you will not think me intrusive ; I do not wish to be so. Only to be of use to you, if I can.\" As a matter of fact, he had stepped noise lessly back into the vestry en seeing that kneeling figure, but the little piteous moans which Eleanor unwittingly gave from time to time had reached his ears and affected him painfully, so that at the risk of being thought impertinent he made up his mind to speak. A vivid flush rose to Eleanor's pale cheeks, and for a moment she drew herself up haughtily. But her resentment died away as she looked at the gentle face before her, and saw that it had cost him an effort to say this. \" You are very kind, but there is nothing you can do for me, thank you,\" she said, in a low tone, making a step towards the door. \" I cannot bear to think that any one should go away from here uncomforted,\" he gently per sisted ; \" and \u2014 and I am afraid you are not leav-"], [184, "172 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. ing your trouble behind you.\" He had seen the lines of suffering on the white face and the hard' tearless eyes, in which there was a sadness deeper than tears. \" Do all find comfort here, then ?\" she asked, with a little bitter smile. \" Is it only I who go away as I came ?\" \"No one need do that,\" he said, gravely. \" If sought in a right spirit there is help for all.\" \" Ah, no \u2014 not for me. The age of miracles is over. And she was gone before he could make any reply. On her way home she stopped at a chemist's and asked to have a sleeping-draught made up for her. \" My nerves have been very much shaken,\" she explained, \" and it is important that I should have a good night's rest. Give me something that will ensure this without a doubt.\" She knew that unless she had some hours' rest and oblivion she would be quite unfit for the task that lay before her on the morrow, and besides she had not the courage to face a sleepless night. The mixture produced the desired effect. The fevered brain was soothed and lulled to rest, and Eleanor slept heavily until late into the morning."], [185, "173 CHAPTER XIII \" Scarcely does any discover his one true mate among thousands ; Or, if kindlier chance shall have given the singular blessing, Comes a dark day on the creep, and comes the hour unexpected, Snatching away the gift, and leaving the anguish eternal.\" It was four o'clock in the afternoon Eleanor had just gone into the drawing-room, telling Mrs. Foster that she expected Adrian on a matter of some importance and that she did not wish to be disturbed. She was sitting by the fire with her back to the light and she held a book in her hand, but she would have been puzzled to say what she was try ing to read. In spite of herself, her eyes wandered from the printed page and she listened intently for"], [186, "174 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. the slightest sound outside ; her ears would recognise Adrian's step in a moment. She had not long to wait. There was a ring at the bell, which set her heart beating fast, and then some one came in, and before the door opened and she saw his face she knew that it was Adrian Walmesley. \" Well,\" he said, his eyes softening into the look of tenderness they always had for her, \" so you could not have me yesterday after all ? I hope you are going to make up for it this afternoon by being extra good and amiable, for I have quite a budget to unfold and I shall want a long time to do it.\" \" You shall have the rest of the afternoon,\" she said. \" I have given orders thas I am not at home to any one.\" \" Is anything the matter ?\" he asked, a little anxiously. \" You are not looking quite yourself and your voice sounds so \u2014 tired ?\" He knew her so well that she scarcely expected he would fail to notice the change, and why should she make any attempt to deceive him, when he was there to hear the whole bitter truth ? \" I am not well,\" she said, \"I \u2014 I have some thing to tell you. Won't you sit down ?\" For all this time he had been standing before her and she could not look up and meet his eyes. \" Yes ?\" he said, as he took a chair. \" I was"], [187, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 175 afraid you looked as if you had been worrying over something. What is it ? Tell me.\" He was interested at once, as he always was in anything that concerned her, but it was evident he had no idea that it could mean anything to him beyond that. \" I have been thinking over things and\u2014 and I am afraid we have made a mistake.\" Never were words so hard to say, but she forced them out. \" A mistake ?\" he repeated, in a puzzled tone. '\u2022 Yes,\" she hurried on, scarcely knowing what she said, \" a mistake \u2014 you and I \u2014 our engagement.\" \" I don't understand you, Eleanor,\" he said, gravely, after a moment's silence. \" Tell me plainly what you mean ; what it is you have to say. \" \" I mean,\" she said, speaking with desperate courage, and feeling that she could laugh aloud as she trampled on her own happiness, \" I mean that we are unsuited to one another ; that our engagement was a mistake ; that it had better come to an end.\" His face grew very white, and she heard him catch his breath with a little gasping sound, but he did not speak. The silence grew intolerable. \"Why don't you say something?\" she cried,"], [188, "176 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. wildly. \" Why don't you abuse me ? Call me a faithless, heartless woman ; a disgrace to my sex \u2014 anything.

But she shrank back. \" Don't make it harder for me,\" she moaned. \" I \u2022cannot \u2014 I cannot. It is true enough.\" \" Then \u2014 then may God forgive you, Eleanor, for I never can,\" and he rose hastily, so that she could not see his face. \" Oh, don't say that \u2014 for pity's sake, don't say that ! \" she cried, desperately, springing to his side. \" Forgive me \u2014 forgive me ! \" seizing his hand, \" I cannot live if you will not.\" \" What does my forgiveness matter to you ? \" he said, as he turned round, and she cried out as she saw the white misery of his face. \" What does it matter what I do or think ? You have ruined my life. You have taken a man's heart and played with it, and then when you throw it aside, you cry, ' Forgive me !

She had never heard such words from him before."], [189, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 177 \"What can I do?

Turn round and look at me.\" She was seated in a low chair and he was close beside her, his arm on a table, his head resting on his hand. His face was grave even to sternness, but his eyes could not change to her yet ; they still betrayed how much of his heart was bound up in the woman at his side. She turned slowly round as he spoke and raised her eyes to his for a moment, but dropped them again almost immediately. \" It may seem strange to put such a question to you after all you have said,\" he went on, \"but there is something in this that I cannot understand, and my mind will be more atrest if you will answer it.\" \" I will if I can,\" she said, faintly. \" Oh, it is simple enough,\" he replied a little bitterly. \" It is only \u2014 forgive me if it seems a little absurd \u2014 in spite of your broken faith, in spite of everything you have said \u2014 Do you still love me ? \" She shivered as though a cold wind had swept through the room. \" Is it not a little absurd, as you say, to ask such a question after what has passed ? \" she replied. \" Surely you can answer it for yourself.\""], [193, "181 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. \" Don't fence with me, Eleanor,\" he cried, passionately. \" Remember that I am only a man, with a man's passions and a man's limited endurance.

You could not lie to me.\" Her face was hidden in her hands, and she made no reply. She knew what had been in his heart, and had answered him so as there should be no appeal. He rose from his seat. \" You are not going ? \" she said, looking up. \" What is there to stay for ? \" he asked, wearily. \" It is all over \u2014 it is all settled.

It will be no wrong to you, or \u2014 or to any one that may come after me, to kiss you once more \u2014 and for the last time.\" He took her face between his hands and pressed a long kiss on the quivering lips : then he turned away, stumbling a little as he went, like one who walks in the dark. Eleanor, crouching down by the fire, heard the"], [196, "184 THE SIN AND THF WOMAN. door shut and knew that it was all over ; that Adrian Walmesley had gone out of her life ; that never before, in her darkest and dreariest days, had she touched the depth of misery she sounded now. \" Would it have been better to have risked all and confessed to him ? \" she asked herself, miserably. \" If I had thrown myself on his breast when he asked me if I loved him \u2014 ;/ I loved him, God help me ! \u2014 would he have held me there in spite of everything ? But I could not risk it \u2014 I did not dare. If he had thrust me from him, if I had seen scorn and loathing in his eyes, for love and tenderness, it would have killed me ; I should have died of shame. No, it is best as it is \u2014 best as it is. At least, now I am not dishonoured in his eyes ; I may still claim him as a friend.\" Before she retired to rest that night, Eleanor wrote a few lines to Dudley Graham. They were contemptuously abrupt and bore neither heading nor signature. \" I have obeyed your orders. My engagement is at an end. At the same time I warn you that I have done all that it is possible for me to do for the present. If you attempt to force yourself on me, or to control me in"], [197, "185 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. any way, I shall defy you, and you may do your worst. You are dealing with a desperate woman who cares very little what becomes of her now. For your own sake it will be best to have a little patience.\" And Dudley, when he opened the envelope with fingers that trembled a little and hastily scanned the few words it contained, agreed that it would be wise not to try his power too far. He was very well satisfied with the course of events and could afford now to wait a little. Eleanor had broken off her relations with Adrian Walmesley > that was the great point. He would leave her alone till she had learnt to look the new situation in the face."], [198, "186 CHAPTER XIV. \" Anfangs wollt' ich fast verzagen, Und ich glaubt', ich triig' es nie ; Und ich hab' es doch getragen, \u2014 Aber fragt mich nur nicht : wie ?\" Three months had elapsed since Eleanor's event ful interview with Adrian Walmesley ; three months that had left their mark on the woman who had battled through them \u2014 she scarcely knew how \u2014 and in a lesser degree, on the man whose happiness she had destroyed. His grief had no remorse to embitter it, and so, though deep and strong enough, was not beyond human strength to bear. Hers was intensified by a cease less, smouldering resentment against fate and all the world and by a weary dread of the unlovely future that stretched before her, and so went sometimes almost beyond even her endurance, and took its revenge in sleepless nights and in a constant strain upon her physical as well as mental strength."], [199, "187 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. Though Eleanor was far too proud to make her condition patent to the world at large, her intimate friends could not fail to remark the alteration in her. Try as she might to be bright and cheerful, her face occasionally betrayed the effort and by its worn, restless look and dark, unsmiling eyes \u2014 fcr the conventional smile that the mouth was taught to wear had no power to brighten them \u2014 showed that all was not well within. Could she be fretting over her broken engagement ? these same friends asked themselves. It had been her own doing and was certainly not a step to be regretted. It was a pity that she had ever entered into it \u2014 they knew that it would not answer \u2014 but it was surely a matter of congratulation that she had discovered her mistake before it was too late ? Even Miss Masson and Madge, though they were naturally indignant for Adrian's sake \u2014 no reproach against Eleanor had passed his lips, but they could not be persuaded that she had not been greatly to blame \u2014 after a while reluctantly acknowledged that perhaps it was all for the best, and resumed, to a certain extent, their old friendly relations with her. Eleanor was sitting at her writing-table, with a letter lying open before her which had come by the morning post, but which she had put into her pocket unread. It was from Dudley Graham. He"], [200, "188 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. had kept his promise and left her in peace, seeing her only at rare intervals in the presence of mutual friends, until about a month ago, and then he broke the silence. He reminded her that some little time had now elapsed since she had parted from Adrian and asked when she would be prepared to receive him as her affianced husband and acknowledge their engagement to the world. She had asked for a little more time, almost pleading with him to be patient a little longer \u2014 though no cne could tell how hard it was to her to ask any favour at this man's hands \u2014 saying she was out of health and depressed and lacked the power to make any change in her life at present, and very reluctantly he had yielded to her wishes, and agreed to wait a few weeks still for his answer. And now this morning a letter had come, reminding her that for three mcnths she had been a free woman \u2014 surely it might be considered that sufficient respect and consideration had been paid to her former lover ! \u2014 and saying that he must now have a definite reply. \" I can never marry him \u2014 never ! \" Eleanor said to herself, despairingly. \" Why did I ever make such a promise ? The more I think of it, the more impossible it seems. To marry a man you loathe and despise ; to be always with him, within reach of his voice and touch of his hand ! I have"], [201, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 189 courage for most things, but I have not courage for that. And yet \u2014 and yet .\" And her head sank on her breast and she was lost in gloomy reflections. \" I must do something,\" she said at last, wearily _ \" He will not be put off any longer. I must give him a promise ; I must agree to marry him some day, and I will make it a condition that meanwhile we shall see as little of one another as is compatible \" \u2014 with a bitter smile \u2014 \" with our new relations. Perhaps something will happen, some miracle \u2014 I have been such a lucky girl that I have a right to expect Providence to intervene specially on my behalf ! \u2014 that will save me from this man. At any rate, I will postpone the evil day as long as possible.\" Then she took up her pen and briefly informed Dudley that he might announce their engagement when he pleased. She rang the bell and gave the letter to the servant to post at once. \"I shall be glad to get it out of the way,\" she thought. Half an hour later she was still sitting at her writing-table. She had taken out a manuscript, but the pen had dropped from her listless hand after a moment and she was leaning back in her chair, neither thinking nor caring very much about anything, when the door opened and Adrian Walmesley came in."], [202, "190 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. She had only seen him twice since they had parted, and those had been casual meetings, when a few commonplace words had been exchanged and they had gone on their own way again, and she wondered, as she rose slowly from her chair, while her heart beat so wildly that the sound seemed to fill the room, what had brought him here now. She did not know what love and pain and longing suddenly filled her eyes when she first caught sight of his face ; but Adrian saw it and wondered \u2014 as he had wondered before \u2014 what it all meant. Why she should look at him thus when he was nothing to her ; when of her own free will she had put him on one side ? She steadied herself in a moment and greeted him like any ordinary visitor. \" I hope I am not disturbing you,\" he said, as they shook hands. \" I know one has no right to intrude on literary people in the morning, but I wanted to see you, and you know my time is not altogether at my own disposal.\" \" I am very pleased to see you,\" she replied. I am in an idle mood this morning, and was only making a pretence at work.\" There was a little pause after Adrian sat down. Although he had schooled himself well for this"], [203, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 191 interview, to find himself alone again with the woman he loved, in the familiar room where they had so often sat and talked together \u2014 on such a different footing ! \u2014 in the happy past, tried his composure sorely. How dear she was to him still in spite of all ! It was a delight to him merely to be in her presence ; his eyes had been aching for the sight of her, his heart hungering for a word from her lips, even such a word as she might give to a stranger. She had made herself so completely a part of his life that, when she went out of it, there was a terrible void ; a void that no amount of hard work nor anything else could fill. He scarcely dared to look at her lest she should read his thoughts. Sometimes he told himself that he was rightly punished in losingthis woman, whom unconsciously, perhaps, he had almost worshipped ; that she had come between him and his work, that she had grown dearer to him than aught else, and so she had been taken away. And he tried not to murmur or to think that justice had been untempered by mercy. His poor people found no change in him, except that perhaps he was even more gentle and forbearing with them than of yore, and he spared himself less than he had ever done. \" I have been reading your new book,\" he said at last, \" and it is about that I should like to speak if"], [204, "192 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. you will allow me \u2014 if you will not think it presump tion on my part.\" \" Certainly not. Say what you like,\" she replied, with a little surprise. \" You know you have a friend's privileges whenever you care to use them.\" \" It is not a long story,\" he said, \" and I read it through one evening. Indeed, when I had once started it, I did not care to put it down again. As it is already in the second edition, I suppose most people have found it as engrossing as I did and that it is what would be called a success.\" \" Yes, I suppose so,\" she said, still wondering. \" And yet I am sorry \u2014 very sorry that you ever wrote it,\" he went on, gravely. Her face flushed. \" Why ? \" she asked, with averted eyes. \" Because it is so hard and bitter ; because it speaks so lightly of much that we should reverence ; because it is so cynical and worldly-wise \u2014 that wisdom of the world which laughs to scorn, or treats with contemptuous toleration, every noble impulse which passes its comprehension \u2014 which would tread every ideal into the dust.\" \" You are hard on me,\" she murmured. \" I can but write as I feel \u2014 what my life has taught me.\""], [205, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 193 \" Eleanor, don't say that the thoughts and sentiments in that book are your own ; they were not a few months ago, I know. You cannot have changed completely in so short a time. I know that such books are popular nowadays ; that it is the fashion to laugh at all the old beliefs ; to ques tion all that is good and beautiful, and to accept only that which is poor and commonplace, because, forsooth ! that seems to us natural enough. With the plummet-line we have made with our own hands, we will measure all things in heaven and earth ! \" \" The book was written during the last three months,\" she said, facing him almost defiantly, \" and in that time many things have changed with me.\" \" Eleanor, I don't understand,\" he said, after a moment, his eyes seeking hers with a wistful look. \" Forgive me if I have spoken too strongly. But it hurt me to see your name on that book, although \u2014 although,\" his voice very low, \" I have no right to question anything you do \u2014 now.\" \" Don't say that ! \" she cried, impulsively. \" Let me feel that I have still a friend \u2014 that there is some one to take a little interest in me.\" The longing rose strong within him to take her in his arms, to hide the white, tired face 0"], [206, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 194 with its defiant eyes and the little hard lines round the mouth, against his breast, and to tell her that there was some one to whom she was dearer than anything else in the world. But his man's pride held him back ; she had cast him off; he had pleaded with her once and pleaded in vain ; it was not for him to try and break down the barrier she had erected between them. \" You know,\" he went on more quietly, \"that I am not bigoted or narrow-minded in these matters. I hold with plain-speaking \u2014 with free thinking up to a certain point, but we should know when to put the curb on. Let men, and women too, write about life as they find it, not glossing over the dark places or ignoring them altogether, but yet at the same time touching on them gently, even reluctantly, because, although it is folly to shut our eyes and then say we do not see the evil that stares us in the face, it is even a greater mistake to make that evil a salient feature, to let its trace be seen on every thing.\" \" And you think I have done that ? \" she said, in an almost inaudible voice. \" No, I would not go so far as that ; I was speaking more in general terms. But this new book is a departure from your former style. You were disposed to be a little bitter and hard before."], [207, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 195 but you were not so utterly cynical and doubtful of good. Surely, it is a mistake \u2014 even from an artistic point of view \u2014 not to make the darkness contrast with light ; not to compare evil with good ? There is always this relief in nature itself.\" \" You think so ? \" she said, with a curious little smile. \" But we will not discuss that. If you wish, I will promise not to write such a book again, though,\" with a little uplifting of the head that was familiar to him, \" on the other hand, I cannot undertake to write prize stories for Sunday-school children.\" \" And I should not wish you to,\" he said, with a smile. \" I am afraid they would be rather pain ful productions ; your talents do not lie that way. I am very grateful for your promise ; it is more than I should have dared to ask. I am afraid I have been reading you quite a homily. Tell me you do not bear me any malice.\" \" You know I do not,\" she replied, holding out her hand. \" I wish you would come and see me sometimes ; it does me good.\" \" My time is so much engaged,\" he said, hastily, \" and you are a long way off. But I am always glad to hear about you, and \u2014 and to know that it is well with you.\" He was rising from his seat, when she stopped him with a gesture. o \u2014 2"], [208, "196 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. \" Wait a moment,\" she said, a little unsteadily. \" I \u2014 I have something to tell you ; something that I should not like you to hear from any one else.\" He sat down again without speaking, the colour fading a little from his cheeks, a vague fear at his heart. She seemed to find it difficult to continue, for she turned to the mantelpiece and nervously fingered some flowers that stood in a vase. \" It is about myself,\" she said, without looking at him. \" Perhaps it will surprise you \u2014 I have just accepted an offer of marriage.\" She was still apparently absorbed by the bowl of roses, but though she did not look round, she felt the quick start he gave and the silence that followed. The rose-leaves fell from her trembling fingers as she waited for him to speak. How long it seemed ! Of what was he thinking ? She did not dare to turn round. \" I congratulate you,\" he said at last, coldly. \" Your news has certainly taken me a little by surprise, though I do not know why it should. If they have been a long time coming, you have my best wishes for your happiness.\" \" You do not ask who it is,\" she said, still with averted eyes. \" Does it very much matter \u2014 to me?\" he replied, with a bitterness he could not control."], [209, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 197 \" The man I have promised to marry is \u2014 Dudley- Graham,\" she said, bringing out the name with an effort. \" Dudley Graham !\" he exclaimed, rising hastily from his seat. \" Yes,\" she continued, hurriedly. \" It has only just been settled, and I thought I should like to tell you myself. No doubt all the world will know it in a few days. It will not be for some time \u2014 we have no idea of getting married yet,\" she went on incoherently. \" We shall be a very matter-of-fact couple.

Oh yes, we shall be quite fashionable, it is one of those affairs that are ' arranged,' that are so suitable, that \u2014 that \" \u25a0 Here suddenly her voice died away into silence. \" Eleanor,\" Adrian said, coming over to her and unconsciously gripping her wrists between his fingers with a grasp of iron, so that she was forced to turn and face him, \" Is this true ? Are you really going to marry that man ?\" \" Yes, it is true enough,\" she replied, \" and \u2014 and\" \u2014 with a sudden assumption of defiance, \"why should it not be ?\" \" Why ?

And yet you will believe me, Eleanor, that I would not judge him the more hardly on that account.

And as to breaking my heart \u2014 I don't think he will do that. Did I not tell you that this is quite an engagement a la mode ? Hearts don't enter into the question.\" \" And you can calmly contemplate such a future as that will mean ; you, with your warm sympa thies and affections ?\" he asked, in amazement. \" Eleanor, why are you doing this ? Tell me.\" \" Why ?\" she repeated, wearily. \" Is that not rather a curious question to put ? Perhaps I prefer my marriage to be a business arrangement, as then it will not interfere with my own pursuits. If I were very much interested in \u2014 my husband, he might take up too much of my time and I should neglect my work. That would be a pity, my friends are kind enough to say.\" \" If it had been any one else,\" he murmured\u2014 \" if I could have honestly congratulated you, even though,\" lower still, \" it must always have been with a sore heart !\""], [211, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 199 \" Don't trouble about me,\" she said, trying to speak lightly. \" I am not worth it. And I think few people would call me either an affectionate or a sympathetic person. You judge me too kindly. Perhaps the life I have chosen is the one that will suit me best.\" \" If you think so, I have no right to say another word,\" he replied. \" Indeed, I fear I have said too much already. You should rebuke me for presuming to question your choice. You see,\" bitterly, \" I forget myself when I am with you. The less I see of you the better, or I should exhaust your patience with my advice and interference.\" \" I did not mean to wound you,\" she said, gently, \" and you know I always wish you to be frank with me.\" \" You are very good,\" he said, brokenly, \" but indeed, for my own sake, it will be best that I should see as little ofyou as possible \u2014 at all events for the present.

There ! don't pity me, for God's sake ! I could not bear it. Leave me now. I don't think I am very well, and I scarcely know what I am saying.\" He stood looking at her a moment. A dozen questions rose to his lips, but not one was asked. To what good ? He held her hand an instant closely in his, and went silently from the room."], [213, "201 CHAPTER XV. Da steh' ich schon aus deinerfinsternBri'icke, Furchtbare Ewigkeit.

But towards the end of the summer he began to grow impatient. His engagement scarcely seemed to have improved his position with Eleanor; he saw very little of her, and when they did meet she kept him at arm's length. If he called at her house, he more often found her out than in, and though he questioned sometimes the truth of the replies he received, he could not openly express his doubts and was obliged to go away concealing his morti fication as best he could. At last he made up"], [214, "202 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. his mind to endure it no longer, and after two successive calls, when he had found the door barred against him with the stereotyped answer of \" Not at home,\" he wrote a curt note to Eleanor, saying he would call the following after noon, and requesting \u2014 the request was couched almost as a command \u2014 that she would make it convenient to see him. When he arrived at Pelham Gardens about four o'clock, he was shown at once into the drawing room, where Eleanor was seated alone. \" I am glad to find you in at last,\" he said, when he had sat down. \" I am most unfortunate in missing you so often. If such a supposition were not necessarily absurd, between people in our position, it might almost seem that you sought to avoid me.\" \" Did you not give your orders that I was to be at home this afternoon ? \" she said, coldly, ignoring the latter part of his speech. \" If you like to put it that way \u2014 yes. Frankly, I am tired of the way we are going on. For all the privileges it gives me, I might just as well not be engaged to you. The pleasure of surprising your numerous friends and my own with our engagement is over \u2014 I don't think,\" with a sardonic smile, \" Aunt Lucy will ever understand how you could put me in her paragon's place ; it"], [215, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 203 was rather a sudden change no doubt \u2014 and I want something more definite.

My fiancee's appearance is of considerable interest to me ; my wife's will naturally be of still greater. The value of anything is enhanced when others envy you its possession, and I don't want you to lose your good looks. You know,\" regarding her critically, \" they were always rather dependent on your moods ; you could never be called strictly handsome, but you had some very good points.\" \" Is this what you have called to tell me ? \" she said, with cold scorn. \" If so, I must ask you to excuse me. My time is of more importance than you seem to think.\""], [216, "204 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. \" Forgive me,\" he said, dropping his light tone. \" I don't know how it is, but you seem to possess a marvellous faculty for making me show myself at my worst.

Then he said abruptly and almost roughly \u2014 \" It is of no use trying to conciliate you, I see, so you shall hear the reason of my visit without farther preface. If I state it a little brutally, you have only yourself to blame. Briefly then, I want you to fix the day for our marriage.\" She started, and looked him straight in the face for the first time. \" What need is there for such haste?\" she asked, losing a little of her self-possession. \" The engage ment has lasted less than three months.\" \" It has lasted quite long enough for me,\" he replied, still sullenly. \" I have no chance of making any way with you ; you never see me unless it is absolutely unavoidable. When we are married it will be different.

You forget what a little while it is since I pictured such a different future. It is cruel to drive me like this !

Yery well then \u2014 carry out the bond.\" \"I tell you, it cannot be \u2014 it cannot be!\" she cried, excitedly, rising from her chair in her agitation and going over to him. \" And I say it can and shall be,\" he replied, with equal resolution, his eyes meeting hers. She looked into his face for a moment. It was white and hard and expressed an inflexible determination. There was no hope there. With a little shudder she turned away. \" I must have time to think,\" she said, faintly. \" I cannot decide on anything now. You can call again in a week \u2014 in two weeks' time, and I will give you my answer then.\" He knew that the victory must rest with him, and he went away fairly content. It would have been pleasanter, no doubt, to have done his wooing in a more gentle fashion, to have tasted some of the sweets of courtship, but at the same time there was a certain charm, to a man of his"], [219, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 207 temperament, in bending a woman like Eleanor to his will. It is doubtful whether he would have valued her so highly \u2014 it is certain that she would not have haunted him so persistently \u2014 had she been ready to give him love for love. Eleanor had taken no heed of his departure ; she seemed scarcely conscious of it. She sat motionless where he had left her. There was a strange weight on her breast, and she felt a faint wish for more air, as though she found a difficulty in breathing, but she made no attempt to open the windows or to call for assistance. The feeling grew stronger ; a cold perspiration broke out on her face, and her heart seemed to stop beating. She felt as though she were drifting away somewhere, but she never completely lost conscious ness. Though she could not have moved a finger or spoken a word, she could still recognise her surroundings ; could feel the full force of the strange, cold horror that seemed to be robbing her of life. In a little while it began to pass over ; her heart beat more freely, and with a long sigh she sat up and looked round. \" That dreadful faintness again,\" she murmured. \" I cannot understand it, I have had it so often lately. But this time it was worse than usual. It seems so strange; I have never been one of the fainting kind. Am I going to be ill, I wonder ? \""], [220, "208 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. Slowly and heavily she dragged herself upstairs to her own room. She had a great dislike to any fuss or display of sympathy, and good Mrs. Foster, if she had seen her, would have over whelmed her with both. \" I shall be all right presently,\" she said to herself, sinking down on the sofa, and drawing a rug over her, for she still felt chilled and unnerved ; that deadly faintness seemed almost more exhaust ing than active pain. She was so tired, too tired to worry about anything, and in a little while she fell asleep. When Dudley called a fortnight later he found Eleanor ready to receive him. He was a little sui prised that she met him so quietly ; he had scarcely expected such a calm, matter-of-fact reception after the agitated scene of the other week. He would not have wondered if she had written to him \u2014 some desperate final appeal, or, at least, asking for farther time for consideration, but there had been nothing of the kind ; Eleanor had not addressed a single line to him. \" You have come for my answer ? \" she said, pointing to a chair at a little distance. \" Yes,\" he replied, still wondering, as he sat down. There seemed something unfamiliar. Her face on which his eyes rested, was white and worn, but"], [221, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 209 so it had been the last time he saw it ; was it the look of quiet strength, almost of peace, that rested on it now, that he did not recognise ? Or was it the quiet voice, so destitute of passion and scorn or any other feeling, that struck on him strangely ? He could not tell. Only it seemed to him that some thing had happened since he last stood there ; something of which he was unaware. \" When you called two weeks ago, you wanted me to fix a day for our marriage,\" she went on in the same emotionless way. \" I have had time to think matters over, and I am ready to do so now if you wish.\" He looked up a little suspiciously. \" I am glad to find you so reasonable,\" he said. \" It is more than I expected. But it is a little sudden, is it not ? \" \" Is it ? \" she replied, indifferently. \" Perhaps I have grown tired of fighting ; perhaps I recognise that what is to be will be and I had better accept the inevitable with a good grace. You remember your excellent advice \u2014 that I should be wise to make the best of things ? Any how, does it matter ?

I don't want my marriage to be a hole-and-corner business. My wife will be one of the best-known women of the day and I am proud of the fact.\" She looked at him strangely for a moment and her lips almost relaxed in a smile. \" Well then, shall we say the end of February ? That is scarcely six months ; not too much time for all that has to be done. My trousseau must be worthy of the rapture with which it will be described in the fashion-papers.\" \" Yes, that will do very well I should think,\" he said, after a moment, \" andl have to thank you for falling in so readily with my wishes.\" He rose from his chair and bent over her as though he would have ratified the argreement with a kiss. \" That is not in the bond,\" she said, with a harsh laugh, as she drew back. \" You shall kiss me for the first time when \u2014 we are married. And now I have a slight request to make, which I think you can scarcely refuse, as I have been so complaisant.\""], [223, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 211 \" What is it ?\" he asked, trying to conceal his discomfiture at the rebuff he had received. \" That for the little time still left me, I shall be undisturbed ; that I shall pass the last days of my liberty in my own way. Let me feel that for a month or two, at all events, no man has a claim on me.\" \"You mean \u2014 to put it plainly,\" he said, harshly, \" that you want me to keep out of the way. Isn't that it ? \" \" Yes, if you prefer plain speaking, that is it,\" she replied. \" Does this offend you ? After all,\" speaking a little bitterly for the first time, \" is it a great thing to ask ? If on a certain day you must enter into bondage \u2014 forgive me if I put it too bluntly \u2014 it is surely only natural that you should wish to enjoy what freedom is left without being reminded in any way of that day ? \" \"Oh, it is natural enough of course,\" he said, with a short laugh, \" though it is scarcely pleasant hearing. But you have not spoilt me with flattery, and I am weaker than I thought to trouble myself over such remarks.\" \" And your reply ? \" she said presently, as he did not speak. \" I agree,\" he said, briefly. \" You would not make it very comfortable for me if I did not, I expect.

It will seem strange, you know, if I do not enquire after the well-being of my bride-elect from time to time.\" \" Certainly. Do what you think is necessary in the eyes of the world. You have a great respect for its opinion, I know \u2014 and so, of course, have I.\" \" Thank God, that is over,\" she murmured softly, as the door closed behind Dudley. \" I feel already as though a weight had been taken off my shoulders. I shall be free for a little while \u2014 I shall have rest and peace.\" Her sad eyes wandered through the window to the little garden beyond, where Autumn's red finger was just touching the leaves into hectic beauty, and then to the glimpse of blue sky above. \" Rest and peace ! It seems to me that if all else could be had for the asking, I should not ask for it now. It is best as it is \u2014 oh, best as it is !

Only two months had elapsed since, in her interview with Dudley, she had consented to fix a day for their marriage, and now all that was set on one side for ever. She was still in the world, but she was no longer of it ; already she looked at its pleasures and follies from afar off ; that immeasurable distance that stretches between the living and the dying stretched before her, for there was no hope, and Eleanor knew there was none. The sands of her life had nearly run out : they had been poured forth so recklessly, that now but a few grains were left ; in a little while they too must go. \" But I cannot understand it,\" Miss Masson said to the great physician who had been summoned in"], [226, "214 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. haste to Pelham Gardens. \" It seems so dreadfully sad. Dying, you say, and of heart-disease \u2014 at her age ! I thought it was only old people who died from such things.\" The great man shrugged his shoulders ever so gently and made an expressive gesture with his white, well-kept hands. \" You would not say so, dear madam, if you were in my place \u2014 if you had had my experience. It is lamentable, no doubt, but it is an undeniable fact that nearly half of my patients are under forty years of age. The rush and drive of the present day has a great deal to answer for. There is no such thing as rest, and I think we have forgotten how to take life easily. We have no need now to call to mind the old proverb that \u2014 ' It is better to wear out than to rust out.' The ' rusting out ' is almost an extinct disease.\" He murmured his little remarks in his pleasant, soothing voice, as so often in his life he had murmured similar platitudes, feeling that it was incumbent on him to say something. He was a kind-hearted as well as a clever man, but being brought face to face with so much emotion had perhaps made him conventional ; if he had allowed his heart to ache in unison with all the grief he inflicted, he would have been unfit for his work. And in this case, though he was genuinely"], [227, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 215 interested in his patient, he knew that the lady he was addressing was nothing more than a friend. \" I told Miss Monroe when she first came to me mere than two months ago,\" he continued, as his companion furtively wiped her eyes without making any reply, \" that she had come too late. She asked me, before I made my examination, to let her know the exact truth, and as she was so determined about it and I saw she was a young lady whose nerves were to be trusted, I promised to do so. And,\" after a little pause, \" unfortunately it did not take me long to discover that the mischief had gone too far for me to touch. All the advice I could give her worth having was to avoid all excitement and to take life as quietly as possible.\" \" But she has been such a lucky girl,\" Miss Masson murmured, plaintively. \" I cannot under stand it. There has been no need for her to fret and worry ; at least, I don't know about years ago, but certainly not of late. She has been admired \u2014 sought after \u2014 applauded. She has had only to wish and to have.\" \" Ah !\" said the great man, thoughtfully, looking at her a little curiously. \" And yet this form of heart complaint generally \u2014 not always, of course \u2014 comes from a hard life ; from trouble and worry and constant, overwhelming anxiety.

He turned to go. \" And \u2014 and,\" faltered Miss Masson, as he held out his hand, \" how long do you think it will be before ?\" She could not finish the sentence. \" It may be only a few days \u2014 it may be a couple of weeks ; not longer, I fear,\" he said, gravely. \" This last attack has left her much weaker than any of the previous ones.

But I"], [229, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 217 tell you honestly, I can do no good. Keep her as quiet as you can. That is all.\" Eleanor was lying upstairs on the sofa in her own room, and when Miss Masson had had time to compose herself a little and had assumed a watery smile that could have deceived no one, she went up to her. She and Madge had not seen so much of Eleanor since her engagement to Dudley Graham. They were both too fond of her to be able to cordially approve of this new step, and so, feeling that they had no authority to question what she did, and that Dudley being their own relative they could scarcely, under the present circumstances, openly express their dis like and distrust of him, as a natural consequence a slight estrangement had sprung up between Eleanor and her old friends. She had not been of late to Porchester Terrace and Miss Masson and her niece were unaware of her precarious state of health. They had thought her looking worn and ill for some time past, but until the preceding day when Mrs. Foster \u2014 who had been struck with alarm at finding Eleanor lying senseless on the floor of her room \u2014 sent a messenger off in haste to fetch Miss Masson, they had had no idea of the serious nature of the case. Eleanor had managed to conceal her previous attacks, but this one was severer and lasted longer than usual, and when"], [230, "218 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. Miss Masson arrived she found her so white and exhausted that she insisted upon her going to bed immediately and on sending for a doctor. \" If you insist,\" Eleanor whispered, faintly, \" send for Dr. Jameson,\" naming the celebrated specialist. \" I have been to him before. But I don't think it is any good. I know what he will say.\" \" And you have been ill and never told us about it ? \" Miss Masson exclaimed, reproachfully. \" Was that not a little unkind ? \" \"You won't be angry with me,\" Eleanor said, pleadingly. \" I did not want to trouble anybody until I was obliged. I have been enough worry to you already.\" Miss Masson had stayed the night with Eleanor, and Dr. Jameson's sleek bays brought him swiftly, and yet without any showy airs or caper ings, as though they knew what was due to their master's profession, to Pelham Gardens the next morning, in response to her written request. Their interview after his visit to Eleanor has already been described. \" There, don't be afraid to look at me, dear,\" Eleanor said, gently, when Miss Masson sat down by the fire after the doctor's departure and struggled through some cheerful remark apropos of nothing; \" and don't mind telling me that you"], [231, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 219 are a little bit sorry. Nothing can hurt me very much now, you know, and I should like to hear that you will miss me sometimes.\" Then the old lady's kind heart gave way, and she sobbed unrestrainedly. \" Oh, you poor, poor child ! \" she cried, in a choked voice. \" It is so hard for you \u2014 so very, very hard ! \" \" Not as hard as you think, perhaps,\" Eleanor said, quietly. \" A little time ago \u2014 well, a little time ago it would have seemed a very cruel thing, but now it is bearable \u2014 quite bearable. Is there not,\" with a little bitter smile, \" a saying about the wind being tempered to the shorn lamb ? Well, it has been tempered to me, and I suppose I ought to be grateful.\" Miss Masson looked up, uncomprehending. \"But,\" she said, \"just as your wedding-day is fixed and everything it seems too dreadful. Poor Dudley! what a shock this will be to him. He must be sent for at once.\" Dudley having agreed to trouble Eleanor as little with his society as possible for the next few months, had \u2014 finding the restraint he had im posed on himself particularly irksome while she was so close at hand \u2014 taken his depar ture to Monte Carlo two or three weeks ago, and was still abroad."], [232, "220 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. \" No,\" said Eleanor, decisively, \" no, I do not wish that. You know, we never pretended to be a sentimental couple, and there is no need for Dudley to be summoned back in haste. He will arrive in plenty of time, no doubt.\" \" But,\" said Miss Masson, in some dismay, \" that seems scarcely right. Dudley will have good reason to complain if he is kept in ignorance of your illness. Surely his proper place is here at your side till \u2014 till the end. And, my dear,\" gently and gravely, \" it ought to be a comfort to you to have him.\" \" But it is not,\" said Eleanor, excitedly. \" I could not bear it \u2014 it would kill me ! Oh, please don't send for him ! You and Madge will take care of me, won't you ? \u2014 I don't want any one but you and Madge.\" \" There ! hush, my dear, hush ! \" said Miss Masson, soothingly, with a rapid resolve to brave Dudley's wrath or anything else rather than disturb the dying girl. \"It shall be just as you wish ; Madge and I will take care of you, I will send for her presently. Poor child, how grieved she will be to hear of this.\" The good lady wondered to herself at the strange fancies of sick people ; how they seemed to turn sometimes from those who had been their nearest and dearest."], [233, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 221 \" You have been very good to me, you and Madge,\" said Eleanor, softly, when the dangerous flush of excitement had died out of her cheeks and she was lying quiet again, but looking very white and frail. \" I haven't had many friends, and you don't know how dear you have been to me ; how grateful I have often felt, though perhaps I didn't show it. I am afraid I am a bad hand at showing what I feel.'' \" My dear, we loved you from the first,\" Miss Masson said, choking back her sobs with a mighty effort, \" and \u2014 and if we haven't seen quite as much of you lately, we have always loved you just the same.\" \" I know \u2014 I understand,\" said Eleanor, patting the little soft wrinkled hand that was laid on hers. \" And now, my dear, you really must not talk any more ; I shall have to go away if you do. I don't know what Dr. Jameson would say to me.\" Eleanor smiled \u2014 a more peaceful, happy smile than had been seen on her face for a long time. \" I will be very good,\" she said ; \" don't go away, I am feeling so comfortable.\" And still holding Miss Masson's hand in hers, she presently fell asleep."], [234, "222 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. Nearly a week had elapsed since the great man's visit and he had come again to see Eleanor. \" She is perceptibly weaker,\" he said to Miss Masson afterwards, \" but there is more vitality still than I expected to find. She seems happier \u2014 more at rest ; keepher so if you can. But,\" fancying he detected a gleam of hope in his listener's eyes, \" don't deceive yourself. The end may come at any moment.\" The following afternoon, as Madge was sitting with Eleanor, Miss Masson opened the door softly, and without a word beckoned to Madge to come out. Eleanor was lying on the sofa with her eyes closed, and thinking she was asleep, Madge went outside to her aunt. In a few minute she returned, looking a little flushed and excited. She bent over Eleanor and said softly, \" Are you asleep, dear ? \" \" No,\" looking up, \" I was only thinking with my eyes shut. Do you want me, Madge ? \" \" Somebody is downstairs, dear, somebody who has called every day to ask after you and now \u2014 if it would not disturb you very much, if you think you can bear it \u2014 he would like to come up for a few minutes just to see you.\" \"Not Dudley \u2014 not Dudley, Madge?\" clinging to her, with frightened eyes."], [235, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 223 \" No, darling \u2014 no ! \" dropping on her knees by the sofa and putting her strong young arms round Eleanor. \" Not Dudley \u2014 Adrian.\" And then, feeling the convulsive movement that shot through the slender form, she added, hastily : \" But if you don't feel equal to seeing him, it does not matter in the least. He will go away at once. Only \u2014 only if you could see him, it would make him very happy. You know \u2014 you know that he has never forgotten you.\" \" My brave little Madge ! \" said Eleanor, tenderly after a moment. \" There, dear, don't start away from me. I was blind for a long time, lately I have learnt to see things more clearly. Happiness makes us very selfish, Madge, but I know you don't bear me any malice. And \u2014 and, I think if you will have a little patience, it will all come right presently. You remember, I said once that the sunshine and the roses belonged to you and \u2014 just wait a little \u2014 and you will have them again, Madge, and to the end \u2014 to the end.\" \" Darling, darling \u2014 don't ! \" sobbed the girl, hid ing her face against Eleanor's breast. \" I don't want them,'' incoherently, \" I don't want anything I have been a wretch \u2014 you don't know what a little brute I have been \u2014 what bad thoughts I have had l ''"], [236, "224 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. \" Kiss me, dear,\" Eleanor said presently, when Madge grew more composed, \" and then go and ask Adrian to come up.\" \" I have tired you, I am sure I have,\" Madge said, remorsefully, lifting her tear-stained face from its soft shelter. \" No, I feel better than usual,\" Eleanor replied, \" and I shall like to say good-bye to Adrian ; I may not see him again.

The eyes that chill me with averted glance Would look upon me as of yore, perchance Would soften in the old familiar way ; For who would war with dumb, unconscious clay ?

There was a strange beauty in her face. Her eyes shone brilliantly, and a little bright flush burnt in each cheek, obscuring for the time the ravages wrought by pain and disease. It was almost the face of her brightest and happiest days \u2014 vivid, glowing, full of life. A crimson cushion Q"], [238, "226 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. supported her head, and her soft silken wrapper of the same rich colour added to the warmth and brightness that seemed to centre in her. The rest of the room looked dull and gloomy in com parison, for the afternoon was drawing to a close and twilight was already creeping into the corners. The door opened gently, and Adrian Walmesley came in. Eleanor tried to speak \u2014 tried to utter some word of welcome, but no sound came through the parted lips. Only the eager hands that were held out to him, and the love that glowed in the uplifted face told their own story, and Adrian knew all he wanted to know without a word. \" My darling \u2014 my own darling ! \" he murmured, brokenly, as he fell on his knees by he side. Then she found her voice. \" Adrian \u2014 Adrian,\" she whispered, half fear fully. \" Is it you \u2014 really you ? I have dreamt you were here so often ; is this a dream, too ?

The man she loved was with her, and for the moment that one supreme fact blotted out everything else. \" Eleanor, what has been wrong ? Why did you ever send me away ? \" he said then. \" It is useless to tell me now that you did not love me. Do you think I should believe you ? \" holding her closer to him. She drew a deep breath. Her dream was broken already. \" Oh, why did you speak ? \" she moaned. \" I was so happy \u2014 so content. I had forgotten every thing but that you were here.

Told him the bitter story of her temptation and fall ; made him see her desolate life, made him walk with her along the road she had trod \u2014 the weary, toilsome road, so destitute of beauty or any tender human interest, so calculated to embitter and harden, to raise rebellion and destroy every noble impulse, to wipe out the line that divides right from wrong, and to drive a proud, self-willed nature into war with the world. She let him see all this, but at the same time she did not spare herself ; she made no excuses for what she had done, she did not attempt to blot out her sin with repentant tears ; she placed the facts plainly before him and she left him to judge.

Once or twice he had not been able to restrain a sudden movement, a convulsive shudder shook him from head to foot, but he had not interrupted Eleanor's story by a single word ; he had con strained himself to listen in utter silence. And as she went on, one feeling rose above all others, dominating the first mixed sensations of shame, repulsion and horror, until they almost sank out of sight, and when her story was done he was conscious only of an immeasurable pity for her and of an almost as immeasurable wrath against the man whose baseness had made him his rival. Perhaps if Eleanor had told her story in the full tide of her strength and prosperity, while the world was welcoming her with open arms, Adrian would not have listened to it in the same spirit. The shame for her, the horror of what she had done, the bitterness of seeing of what poor humanity his idol was made \u2014 the woman whose very faults had seemed but virtues in disguise \u2014 might have turned him against her, and he might have put her out of his life for ever, though he destroyed his own happiness at the same time.

There was no fictitious brilliance now to obscure the sin, no blazoning forth of the reward ; only a dying woman in a darkened chamber pleading for pity and forgiveness the wounds in her breast and speaking through them, not pointing to her triumphs and asking whether, after all, they were not worth the price ? So that when, pale and exhausted, Eleanor looked up in the silence that followed her last word, dreading to meet Adrian's gaze and yet feeling that any certainty was better than suspense, she had scarcely raised her head from his breast, had scarcely had time to timidly whisper his name, before he turned to her, closing his arms round her with a strength of which he was unaware, kissing her eyes, her lips, her hair, murmuring little inarticulate words of tenderness over her, as a mother over a child who has gone astray, but who has suffered bitterly for her fault. \" My poor darling \u2014 my poor darling!\" he said. \" How you have suffered.

For you I can feel only pity ; all my anger and contempt is reserved for the man who made that sin a whip to drive you into his arms ; who fought in the dark \u2014 and with a woman ! \" Though he did not raise his voice, there was something in it that told of a wrath too deep for words ; of a concentrated bitter ness that only waited the opportunity to fling self restraint to the winds and pour itself out on the offender. \"Oh, Adrian, for my sake let him go \u2014 have"], [246, "234 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. nothing to do with him ! \" Eleanor cried, excitedly. \" I could not bear it if harm came to you through him and by my fault.

For the first time for such a weary while, I am free \u2014 quite free,\" and she stretched out her arms with an involuntary movement. \" When the doctor told me that I was doomed> even in the first shock when I saw the world slipping away from me \u2014 the world that, as a happier woman, I could have loved so well, and in which my time has been so short \u2014 even then, through it all, Iwas conscious of a certain thrill of relief. It was as though a way of escape had been suddenly opened to me. And I could meet Dudley and calmly let him settle the day for our marriage, knowing that it would never come to pass \u2014 knowing that before then I should be out of his reach.\" Her voice had grown weak and faint and she let herhead drop wearily back on Adrian's shoulder again, and for a little while they"], [248, "236 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. sat in silence ; a silence more pregnant than words. Then he remembered what she had told him at the first, and he said, gently : \" Eleanor, you are sorry for what you did \u2014 you do not want me to believe that you feel no remorse for your sin ? That you do not repent ?\" \" I am sorry, because it has grieved you,\" she replied, reaching up to touch his face caressingly. \" I began to repent as soon,\" softly, \" as I began to love you, because I felt that it raised a barrier between us \u2014 because I knew that such a thing would be foreign to your nature, that you would not regard it as a venial error. But for the rest \u2014 well ! for the rest, I cannot say that I feel any real remorse. I had tried to be honest, and had not prospered ; then I was dishonest and found my right place in the world. Surely circumstances are more to be blamed than 1 ? Besides, I have paid it all back now.\" \" But,\" he said, earnestly, \"that scarcely lessens the original sin. Oh, Eleanor, try to understand me, darling ; try to see this as I see it, as,\" solemnly, \" God will see it. You were sorely tried ; I believe you were scarcely conscious of what you were doing when you went into that room, for want and misery play strange tricks with the brain ; but now \u2014 so close to eternity, so"], [249, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 237 close to the other side that the light that shines there \u2014 the light under which all our poor excuses and pretences fade away \u2014 already rests on your past life, now you see it all differently, do you not ? You know that you have sinned and that you need forgiveness \u2014 need it far more from the Divine hands than from the earthly ones to whom alone you have pleaded ? \" For a little while she made no reply. \" Ah, let it rest, Adrian,\" she said at last, softly. \" A death-bed repentance, what does it mean ? What is it ? A coward's last resource. God would not help me ; He left me alone, and so I helped myself \u2014 or the Devil helped me. If I have sinned have I not suffered ? Surely I have balanced the account ! And now I am going, and I am not afraid. If there is still something to pay, I must pay it ; but I think if He is a merciful God, as you have so often said, He will remember the life He portioned out to me \u2014 the lonely, bitter life \u2014 and His hand will not rest on me too heavily. If there is no such thing as compensation there is no such place as Heaven.\" \" But \" Adrian began. \" No, we will not discuss it any more,\" she said, decidedly. \" It is too late now.

In a little while I too shall see and understand.\" And with the prayer rising fervently from his heart, which Eleanor had silenced on his lips, Adrian was fain to leave the woman he loved \u2014 whose salvation he would have gladly pur chased with his own soul \u2014 to higher hands \u2014 to a limitless Mercy and an infinite Love. \" You are tired, dear one ? \" he said presently, when they had sat a little while without speaking, trying to see her face through the gathering darkness. \" Yes,\" she said, in a low voice, \" I think I am. I feel as though I could sleep. I can't talk any more now, Adrian ; say good-bye to me, and come again soon \u2014 very soon.'' \" But I don't like leaving you alone,\" he remonstrated. \" May I not stay till you fall asleep, or shall I send Madge to you ? \" \" No, 1 would rather be alone,\" she said. \" You"], [251, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 239 have made me very happy, and I want to be quite alone a little while to think it over.\" \" Then good-bye, my darling,\" he said, taking her face between his hands and kissing it tenderly, \" good-bye till to-morrow.

And stumbling a little, for he was blinded by tears, not trusting himself to speak another word \u2014 he went. Her eyes followed him with a yearning look until the door closed, then she turned round and hid her face in the pillow. \" The bitterness of death is passed,\" she mur mured. \" It will be peace now till the end \u2014 till the end.\" When an hour later Madge went softly into Eleanor's room, to all appearance she was sleeping peacefully. Madge noiselessly replenished the fire and then turned to go. She hesitated a moment at the door, struck by the deathly silence in the room. How softly Eleanor was sleeping ! The fire leapt up as she stood there and its bright, quivering light fell on the motionless figure on the sofa."], [253, "THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. 241 Madge made a hasty step forward, scarcely know ing why, but filled with a sudden, unreasoning fear. \" Eleanor ! Eleanor !\" she whispered, tremu lously. But there was no reply ; not even a move ment, however faint, in the quiet form to show that it heard. \" Eleanor,\" Madge cried, more loudly, \" oh Eleanor, speak to me \u2014 speak to me!\" \u2014 and in sudden terror she put her arms round her and turned the face that was half hidden in the pillows up to her own. Then with a little cry she saw what had happened. Eleanor Monroe was dead. Had died peacefully in her sleep but a little while ago, for her hands were still warm, though on her face was already the look that can never be mistaken \u2014 the seal of the great Destroyer.

There was a turned down page in his past \u2014 a memory hidden in his heart, and to the last day of his life something of the old aching pain would come back when he thought of these things ; of the golden dream that had lifted him awhile above his fellows. The woman's love \u2014 so passionate and deep and strong \u2014 clung to him still ; a shadow from the bygone years, but a shadow stronger than death. And in the secret chamber of his heart it abode alone, and no step but his ever crossed the threshold. And Dudley Graham ? Eleanor's death had been a great shock and a real grief to him, but he was not the man to spend himself in useless lamentation. He had drunk deep of the philosophy of the present day ; what had happened \u2014 had happened ; it was irrevocable, therefore to be forgotten as soon as possible. To remember and to grieve when it avails nothing is but a weak and foolish thing, opposed to every doctrine of common sense and personal well-being. So, in a little while, he was able to again pursue the even tenor of his way ; a little colder, a little harder, perhaps, than"], [255, "243 THE SIN AND THE WOMAN. he had been before, and firmly resolved to steer clear of all such disturbing influences in the future.

Price 16s. \" THE ATHEN\u00c6UM,\" reviewing the year 1802, says: \u2014 In his recently published story, The Veiled Hand, Mr. Wicks revealed himself as a writer of quite uncommon subtlety and strength. \"THE ATHEN\u00c6UM,\" commenting upon the book at length, says : There is a completeness and rotundity in the delineation of the ciiaracters. which gives them the air of being types of humanity rather than individuals, though at tlie same time their dramatic individuality is not sacrificed. Thus, it is not the passing interest in fraudulent or idiotic directors, large though it may be, that renders the book great, but the feeling that the particular form of villainy or folly attributed to these men is merely an accident, and not of the essence of their presentation. . . In rending it one is reminded more than anything else of Thackeray's wonderfully broad and true pictures of manners, and of Thackeray's genius foruniversalisingthe snob and artistically glorifying tlie flunkey. It would follow, then, that it is totally unlike any other English novels ofthe present day. These are, broadly speaking, of two classes : the study of character, a novel of which Mr. Meredith is the chief exponent, or the book of adventure, which depends almost exclusively on plot, wherein lies Mr. Stevenson's chief claim to distinction. But since Thackeray there has hitherto been no considerable writer of the novel of manners which describes a state of society rather than an individual character. The Veiled Hand, likewise, deals with very much the same society as Thackeray delighted in \u2014 tlie proud, impecunious, and foolish inheritor of a long line of ancestors ; the cool, cynical villain, succeeding by irreproachable manners and unscrupulous employment of more stupid villains as his tools ; the gentleman's gentleman, calm and imperturbable, with his consoling tags of commonplace philosophy ; the Bohemian in chambers, who combines with his one enthusiasm, the stage, a laxity of principles which permits him to earn money for it by any dirty job ; and a host of others whom it would be tedious to enumerate. The heroine, also, by her insipidity, reminds one of the Lauras and Amelias who are the weakest point of Thackeray's novels. Indeed, if it were not for the well-known veracity of title pages, and the allusions in the latter part to such modern institutions as School Boards and South African mines, the reader would be tempted to suppose that the book had been written thirty years ago, under the full inspiration of Thackeray's genius. It is not, however, intended to suggest that Mr. Wicks servilely copies Thackeray's methods, and is devoid of originality ; he resembles him because he treats of much the same sort of people, and, like Thackeray, looks at Society from the point of view of the good-humoured cynic. . . It would be difficult to praise the style too"], [263, "highly ; it is quite in the grand manner, broad, deliberate, and uninterrupted. The language is terse, crisp, witty, but the narrative is never hurried ; indeed, to the present generation, accustomed to take their fiction in small and strong doses, the book may seem too long ; but this length has the advantage of satisfying the desire for completeness, which is merely tickled by the hors d'\u0153uvrea of modern fiction. The digressions are not infrequent, but they are never out of place, and hardly a word is wasted ; one feels in reading the book, as in that of any true artist, that there is a reserve offeree out of sight \u2014 that much more might have been said, but that the writer has rigidly confined himself to the absolutely necessary. . . One of the best scenes in the book \u2014 too long, however, for quotation in this review \u2014 is that describing the death of George Adolpbus Leuchars Delfoy, Jim. It begins with an admirable bit of fooling, and leads up witli a marvellously dramatic abruptness to the fatal ending of a drunken frolic. In the artist, M. Jean de Paleologue, the author has secured a most valuable ally. The numerous sketches wdiich illustrate the work are not all equal in merit, but most of the principal characters are admirably rendered. Among the best, we should pick out the large illustration called \"Filial Restrains,\" and \"A Formal Introduction,\" together with the sketch of M. Blanche', ami of George Augustus suffering from an unquenchable thirst. \"THE SATURDAY REVIEW\" says: A new work by Mr. Wicks is an exception to the rule upon which the average modern novel is constructed. Tlie incidents packed into Tin- Veiled \u25a0ffanrfareverynumerouRanddramatic. His plot, which is exceedingly ingenious involves a wide variety of urgent topics, all of which Mr. Wicks treats with familiarity, shrewdness, and vivacity. The Legislators, who are endeavouring to devise means by which the British public maybe protected from adventurers under the Limited Liability Acts, will find in the cha) tera narrating (lie rise and fall of the Great Coradell Company, as much inspiration as they are likely to derive from many rumination in committee. 'I lie chapters dealing with the great strike in the coalfields are equally instructive. . . and Mr. Wicks will have contributed much to the services of man if bis novel makes the proletariat familiar with tlie \"true inwardness\" of the movements to which they lend themselves when high-strung knights of labour take the field. It must not be supposed, however, that The Veiled Hand is a didactic work. Incidentally it is capable of teaching much wdiich the community would profit by knowing ; but this teaching is casual only, and subservient always so Mr. Wicks's purpose, which is to tell a story with the thoroughness of treatment in detail which a plot such as his demands. In the mattes of construction The Veiled Hand is extremely skilful. \" TKE TIMES \" says :\u2014 A wide field lies open to the novelist who sets himself to expose tlie trickery and fraud of company promoting and company directing. Such is the theme which inspires the caustic pen of Mr. Frederick Wicks, already known as the author of more than one vivacious novel in which roguery plays an important part. In The Veiled Hand be is specially severe upon that combination of the politician and the company-monger of which we have latterly had so many shining examples in our own and in other countries. Mr. Wicks has evidently aeen_as a disgusted witness, no doubt\u2014 a great deal of the inner working of the great modern engine of fraud. The Veiled Hand, a domestic drama extending through three decades, relates the rise and fall of a subtle Iago who piles up a colossal fortune by pulling the wires of limited liability from a"], [264, "secure position in the background. Mr. Delfoy's name never comes before the public. But he manages, with consummate address, all the apparatus of the company promoter \u2014 the dummy vendor, the confederated solicitors, the financial journalist, the guinea-pig directors, the \"independent\" experts, the rich sample of ore, and all the rest of it. . . Many scenes could be enumerated from Mr. Wicks's novel which, in the essential satire of the situations and in the spirit in which they are described, would not disgrace the best English satirists. Of such are the first meeting of the sub scribers to the Great Coradell (Limited), the Countess of Bolore's garden party, and the appeal issued on behalf of the Unusual Morality Society \u2014 which last exposes very neatly the methods by wdiich charity canvassers work upon tlie snobbishness of the public. . . Mr. Wicks has really given us an amusing and highly seasonable story, which is none the less pleasing because embellished with numerous illustrations from the clever pen of Mr. Jean de Pal\u00e6ologue. \"VANITY E AIR\" says:\u2014 Mr. Frederick Wicks has again written a book which for interest and abiding value deserves a high place. . . . The Veiled Hand tells a story marked by the qualities at once of photographic fidelity and artistic selection. It is full of honest work without being laboured ; it is shrewdly, sometimes even mercilessly, observant without preaching the decadent gospel of pessimism, and above all it has that essential quality which so many modern novelists seem to avoid as a damning literary crime \u2014 namely, exceeding interest in the conception and evolution of the story as such. The sub-title of the book is \"A Novel ofthe Sixties, the Seventies, and the Eighties \" and no one will deny that the author has taken hold of two of the most prominent developments of social relationship of this period in the apotheosis of the plutocrat and the descent on the city of the aristocrat. No small part of the interest of the story centres in the formation and fortunes of the Great Coradell Copper Mining Company, Limited ; and the strange companionship thereby engendered of the aristocrat, the stockbroker, the solicitor, the financial Pressman, and the \" nominal vendor,\" provides Mr. Wicks with excellent material, of which lie makes most excellent use. Another product of this age is the professional agitator, and in \" the notorious Bowlder \" we are presented with a creation which we would fain hope is not typical, which we are inwardly convinced is so, and which, whether or no. is extremely entertaining. By far the strongest portrait is that of Geoffrey Delfoy, the gambler in love, in money, in politics, and in the reputation of men and women ; a man wdio, having divested himself of the inconvenient attributes of heart and conscience, moves from poverty to the verge of vast wealth through the ruin of others with the relentless concentration of a chess-player who sacrifices bis pawns the better to attack his adversary's king. Muriel, the good woman of the story, is somewhat colourless ; but it is at least an arguable retort that good women are not infrequently characterised by negative and passive excellences. The book is a workmanlike production, to be classed not only among \"Books to Bead,\" but also among \" books to buy.\" The drawings by M. Jean de Paleologue are very clever and genuinely illustrative. \"THE DAILY TELEGRAPH says:\u2014 The plot of this ingenious f ction is at least as elaborate as any to be found in the earlier works of Sue, De Balzac, or Dumas the elder."], [265, "\" THE ECHO,\" in an article on \" Morals and Manners,\" by Meliorist, says : \u2014 Mr. Wicks has attempted a task worthy of the highest gifts of genius. Zola has attempted it for France. . . It (Tlie Veiled Hand) is full of ability, with frequent displays of a higher quality than ability. There are in it incidents, characters, situations, dialogues enough to stock three novels. Dickens himself would have laughed over, and might have owned, the rollick ing, extravagant humour of Mr. Wicks's description ofthe pork-butcher, Mr. Joy, in the crush at the bank and in the bosom of his family. The dialogues, especially the cynical ones, are extraordinarily clever. The scenes in which lawyer sharks, Stock Exchange thieves, company promoters, intriguing M.P.'s ofthe \"Labour\" Party, are drawn, are vivid and powerful, and reveal an intimate and profound knowledge ofthe shady aspects, at least, of contem porary life. Bearing in mind, then, that Mr. Wicks has selected his incidents from one manifestation only of the modern movement \u2014 and that, if socialism be more than an empty name, only a transient manifestation \u2014 his readers may accept him as a safe critic on the ground which he has occupied. For the burden of this novelist-preacher's message to his generation is the vulgarising and de-humanising, socially debasing, and ruinous effect of tlie race for wealth. Mr. Wicks is a strong hater (none the worse for that). He hates the brutalising Materialism of the day, and with such intensity that the preacher sometimes swamps the artist. He hates the Materialistic creed and practice, that man is one appendage of wealth, instead of wealth being the servant of man. . . . There can be no doubt that, as far as it goes, this account of interaction between commercial politics and social demoralisation is correct. Mammon has been vulgarising all ranks of the community. Chippering, M.P., the vulgar, illiterate haberdasher, whose influence with the Whips is set forth by the satirist, has his dittoes \u2014 and many of them \u2014 in the Parliament wdiich has just met. \"THE WESTERN MORNING NEWS, under the title, \" A Notable Novel,\" says : At a time when people are deploring the decadence of English fiction, and asking who are to fill the proud position formerly held by such writers as Thackeray, Dickens, and George Eliot, it is pleasant to come across a novel displaying many of the best traits of famous English novelists. . . Related in masterly style, wit and humour, sarcasm, knowledge of human nature, and the philosophy that comes of experience being prominently exhibited in this very remarkable novel. Many ofthe passages are as good as anything to be found in \" Vanity Fair,\" and there is not the slightest exaggeration in saying that the chapter headed ' ' A Party of Eight \" is one of the very best things in English fiction. . . The book will take high rank as a description of some of the social follies and hypocrisies of the day. \" THE NATIONAL REVIEW \" says:\u2014 The Veiled Hand is Zolaesque in the thoroughness of its mastery of detail. . . Mr. Wicks is painstaking, vivid, and entertaining. . . The Veiled Hand is a highly superior work. The plot of it is ingenious and engaging ; the characters and the incidents are well under control ; the writing, in whicii there are only a few flaws, is sound and almost constantly brilliant. Many of the chapters are humorous in a measure and in a manner which would have done credit to Dickens ; the pages sparkle with epigrams ; and frequently, as by a flash of lightning in the gloom, we are startled by some philosophical reflection deep enough and wise enough to make Mr. Meredith pause and admire."], [266, "\"THE GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE\" says:\u2014 Like the early works of Dickens, The Veiled Hand is a microcosm, embodying representatives of many of the characters that make up the macrocosm. Here are characters good, bad, earnest, shifty, wise, foolish, amusing to the moralist, or depressing \u2014 all involved m one great undertaking, which is to bring fortune and happiness to some, and ruin and death to others. What however is most striking is the relentless light poured upon City speculations, men of highest positions and responsibility being shown as involved in one huge fraud, the full extent of which is not easily estimated. The tortuous and underground manner in which this is wrought is shown with remarkable skill and knowledge of the world. \"THE ACADEMY\" says: The Veiled Hand is a powerful exposure of tlie crimes and follies of modern Society. It is full of interest, and as elosely packed with incident, both of a humorous and a tragic kind, as an agg is full of meat. By lifting the veil on various domestic and commercial phases of life, Mr. Wicks clearly shows where the danger lies of the national decadence of England. . . . There is something m his deliniation that reminds us of Thackeray's method of depicting these social birds of prey. . . . Mr. Wicks has made a decided mark with his novel. \"THE WOULD \"says:\u2014 The author makes his leading villain so hateful that we are positively glad when he is left in a condition of abjectness that no other English novelist has described ; and to rouse that feeling in his readers means a writer's success. \"THE MORNING POST \"says:\u2014 His story arrests and retains attention from first to last, the study of the unscrupulous Delfoy being thoroughly remarkable for restrained power and analvtical discernment. Mr. Wicks is effective without exaggeration, while his cynicism is tempered by a lively sense of humour . . strong human interest, and brilliant originality of manner. \"THE GLASGOW NEWS \"says:\u2014 Strong in character, brilliant in workmanship and finish, and characterised throughout with dramatic force. It is the work of one who has full knowledge of what be is writing about, and has an unprejudiced eye for the ways of the world, which are manipulated by wires from behind. . . . Throughout the whole book there is evidence that there is nothing vamped up about it ; it is the careful, conscientious work of a skilful artist who is determined to give the best that is in him. \"THE LIVERPOOL COURIER \" says :- This is a strong and well-written novel, which, in some of its phases \u2014 particularly in the more humorous passages and dialogues in which the author cleverly allows the characters of his dramatis person\u00e6 to unfold themselves to the reader \u2014 reminds one occasionally of Charles Dickens. The work has, however, a striking vein of originality. Though the main incidents of the story are not unconventional, both the style in which they are treated and the way in which they are elaborated are remarkable in a high degree, and confer upon the book and its author an individuality which cannot fail to leave a marked impression upon the reader. Mr. Wicks' s characters are of a pro nounced type, but they are not exaggerated, and they act in relation to the extraordinary circumstances in which they are implicated most rationally. In the whole range of fiction it would be safe to Bay there is not a better-drawn scoundrel than the villain of this story, and there are few, if any, whose"], [267, "machinations have been depicted upon such a large scale, cleverly marked out but destined in the end to compass the destruction of their author. . . One noteworthy excellence of Mr. Wicks's new work is that the whole develops within the readers cognisance, there.is no retrospection and no resort to any incident occurring at a date prior to that at which the story opens. The work is undoubtedty one of the most interesting and clever contributions to modern fiction. \" FAIRPLAY \" says :\u2014 The Veiled Hand is life-like and full of life. The plausible, but cold -blooded, cynic, who begins his career with a social crime, plunges into promotion of the worst kind as readily as a duck takes to water. Around him are the gang with which the Company prospectuses have made us familiar, of the type of the broken-down baronet, the half-pay colonel, and the pauper peer, all anxious to make use of their names, which, having ceased to be productive on bills, still count for something on Companies. The low-class Company lawyer is there in evidence, together with the wily stockbroker to work the markets. The financial journalist is well represented by Mr. Marmaduke Bray, a character whom most city men will recognise. THE NORTH BRITISH DAILY MAIL\" says :- The Athen\u00e6um so rarely gushes over a mere work of fiction that one is rather staggered when it goes the length of drawing a parallel between Wicks and Thackeray \u2014 if anything in favour of the former. He is Thackeray's legitimate successor in the novel of manners, which describes a state of society rather than an individual character. \"THE TOPICAL TIMES \"enquires :\u2014 Whether the people of England have not been slow to perceive that a novelist of Thackerian power is among us again, and whether anything equal to Wicks's writing can be found in contemporary literature in the shape of startling graphic pictures of over fin de siecle world. Mr. Frederick Wicks has inserted the following preface in a copy of his able novel The Veiled Hand, which has recently been presented to the Queen : \u2014 \" It is the misfortune of sovereigns that they seldom see b-diind the mask ; and, as dissimulation is a necessary part of the dishonourable in social life, few are able to penetrate below the surface of social movement until the public mind is shocked by a catastrophe. The parable here set out \u2014 the result of thirty years' observation as a journalist \u2014 dramatically portrays some of those things that man may be and man may do without transgressing a single statute either extant or possible. Reviewing the work, the author remarks that no possible preventitive can be devised for nine-tenths of the wrongs done within these lealms other than by the cultivation of the individual sense of honourable obligation.\" Extract from The Athtnaum \" Literary Gossip,\" February 18th, 1893.
