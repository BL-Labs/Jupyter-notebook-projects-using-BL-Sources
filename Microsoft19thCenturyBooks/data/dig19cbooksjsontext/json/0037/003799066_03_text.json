The object of the \"Iron Roads Dictionary and Illustrated Route Chart \" is to provide a useful hand-book for all classes of the travelling public, aud, it is hoped, will prove equally serviceable to men of business as to tourists and pleasure-seekers. The plan upon which it has been prepared facilitateu reference to objects and places of interest in a manner not previously attempted. The valuable assistance rendered by the Chief Officials of the Railway com mands grateful acknowledgment. Much time and labour have been expended on the following pages, but the aid so cheerfully accorded by the officers of the Company has materially lightened the task of the Compiler, who has several times travelled over the main line and its branches, and collected personally from every creditable source most of the information contained iu the book. It is possible lhat slight errors will be found, despite the care taken to prevent their intrusion ; but its contents, as a whole, give grounds for the belief that it will afford th'. means of agreeably whiling away the monotonous hours of a railway journey. The Compiler has also been indebted for some particulars to the Guides published many years ago by his friend Mr. Geo. Sami. Measom, who deservedly enjoys the reputation of being the first British Railway topographer. With this volume, those for the South Eastern and London Chatham and Dover Railways are simultaneously published. The books for the other principal Lines are in course of preparation for early publication. Communications and corrections will be thankfully received by WATERLOW A SONS Limited.

On the 5th of June, 1839, a line of Railway from London to West Croydon was opened for traffic under the auspices and control of a Company known as the \"London and Croydon.\" Another Company incorporated as the \" Croydon and Brighton \" then constructed a line between those two places \u2014 via Red Hill \u2014 which was opened on the 21st of September, 1841. By the authority of an Act of Parlia ment, passed on the 27th of July, 1846, these two Companies were amalgamated and the undertaking then became that of THE LONDON BRIGHTON AND SOUTH COAST RAILWAY COMPANY. The western section of the South Coast Lines \u2014 from Brighton \u2014 was opened for traffic as far as Chichester on the 8th of June, 1846, and the eastern section \u2014 from Brighton \u2014 to Hastings on the 27th of June, 1846. The extension from Chichester to Portsmouth was completed on the 14th of June, 1847. By the purchase of the Mid Sussex Bailway in 1860, the London Brighton and South Coast Railway Company provided an alternative route to the South Coast. The Mid Sussex Company was incorporated by an Act, of August 10th, 1857, to construct a line from the Brighton Company's Radway at Horsham to Pulborough \u2014 again joining the Brighton Company's system at that place \u2014 with a branch to Petworth. The Horsham and Dorking Company, incorporated by Act of July 17th, 1862, constructed the line between those two places. This Company was amalgamated with the Brighton Company by the powers of an Act passed in 1864, the latter Company having obtained parliamentary sanction in the previous year \u2014 1863 \u2014 for making a line between Dorking and Leatherhead. Between Leatherhead and Epsom the line was constructed by the South Western Bailway Company. These roads thus gave direct communication with Portsmouth. The extension to Portsmouth Harbour, opened on the 2nd of October, 1876, greatly increased the facilities of access to the Isle of Wight. By the imminent purchase of the interests of the Portsmouth and Ryde Steam Packet Company and the completion of the Ryde Railway Pier (constructed jointly with the South Western Railway) the Brighton Company have become possessed of the readiest route from the Metropolis to the \" Garden \" Island of the South Coast. The London Brighton and South Coast Company will shortly secure a third direct route to the South Coast and one which will slightly decrease the distance to Newhaven Harbour. On the 6th of July, 1865, the Surrey and Sussex Railway Company was incorporated and authorized to construct a railway from the Brighton"], [20, "X Railway south of their South Croydon Station to their Station at East Grinstead \u2014 length 24\u00a3 miles. The works were commenced hut abandoned on the Surrey and Sussex being amalgamated with the Brighton Company by the provisions of an Act passed on the 12th of July, 18C9. The Brighton Company's Act of June 17th, 1878, conferred powers for renewing the abandoned works with certain modifications. The line to be thus formed will con nect with another \u2014 17\u00a3 miles in length \u2014 between Barcombe (on the Lewes and Tunbridge Wells Branch of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway) and East Grinstead, and which, by the enactments of the Act referred to will, when opened, be amalgamated with the Brighton Company's system. Newhaven will thus be brought about ten miles nearer London than by the present route via Keymer Junction. For the purpose of facilitating the Company's Continental traffic the following works are in progress at Newhaven : \u2014 1. A breakwater extending about 900 yards out to sea. 2. Extension of quay accommodation 570 yards from the rail way wharf to the harbour mouth, and extension of the pier. 3. A now sea wall or pier in connection with the above. 4. A tramway (1 mile 2 furlongs 7'30 chains) from near Newhaven Town Station to the Breakwater. 5. A dock on the eastern side of the River Ouse. 6. A sea wall (750 yards long) from the said dock to the existing sea wall of the Tide Mill. 7, 8, and 9. The straightening of Mill Creek and other -works and improvements. By the Act of 17th June, 1878, before mentioned, a company was incorporated to carry out the work, but authorized the Brighton to raise money and subscribe all or part of \u00a3150,000 towards the capital of the under taking. This capital has been subscribed by the Brighton as authorized, and a de posit of 10s. per \u00a310 share has been paid to the Harbour Company. By the terms of the Act, this new route must be completed by the month of June, 1882. Starting from East Croydon the Company will then have three branch lines to the Coast \u2014 the centre (Main Line) being through Mid Surrey and Mid Sussex to Brighton, the right through West Surrey aud West Sussex to Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight ; and the left through East Surrey and East Sussex to Newhaven Harbour, Eastbourne and Hastings. The following particulars respecting the authorization and opening of some of the Branch Lines not hitherto mentioned, may be interesting : \u2014 The Metropolitan Lines of the London Brighton and South Coast Company form a complete network of roads in the South, South-East, and South-West of London.

Under its present management, the London Brighton and South Coast system has made a rapid advance to the front rank of English Railways. The gradual absorp tion of separate Local Branch Lines and concentration of direction has naturally resulted in securing increased facilities to the travelling public. A curious fact, worthy of passing notice, is, that the Company's roads, upwards of 400 miles in extent, are almost wholly comprised within the limits of two counties \u2014 those of Surrey and Sussex. Not more than 25 miles of the Railway are included in the three counties of Middlesex, Kent, and Hants. The following Table shows the authorized capital, income, expenditure, and rate of interest for each half-year, from 1871 to 1880 inclusive : \u2014 The mileage state of the Railway on the 31st December, 1880, was as follows : \u2014 Lines opened, 401 J miles; lines worked, 398 miles ; foreign lines worked over, 23 miles.

This alone secures the patronage of thousands of tourists to the \" shortest and cheapest \" route from England to Paris, but the enlargements and improve ments which are being actively pushed forward at the ports on both sides of the Channel are certain to ensure a largely increased use of the Newhaven and Dieppe service. The route by Littlehampton and Honfleur, although perceptibly superseded by its younger rival, is not without its attractions to those who can enjoy a ten hours' sea voyage. The Company's fleet of Passenger and Cargo Steamers comprises 15 vessels, as under : The Locomotive and Carriage Works of the Company are at Brighton, Battersea, and New Cross, and are of an extensive character. The construction of some of the Company's roads afforded ample scope for displays of the highest engineering skill and architectural design. This is noticeably the case with the main line from London to Brighton, which includes the viaduct from London Bridge to beyond Spa Boad, with nearly \u00a300 arches ; Merstham Tunnel, one mile and seventy yards in length, which cost more than \u00a3112,000, almost the whole length having to be blasted ; the cutting at the north end of Merstham Tunnel, nearly two miles long and one hundred and eighty feet feet perpendicular from its surface in the deepest part ; the Ouse Valley Viaduct \u2014 a handsome structure \u2014 between Balcombe and Hayward's Heath, from which enchanting views of beautiful country are visible ; and Clayton Tunnel, 2,256 yards long, with its Gothic entrance arches. The London Road Viaduct is a striking object on entering or leaving the Central Station at Brighton ; it is about four hundred yards in length and forms a graceful curve, the lofty arches being built in such a manner as to adapt themselves to the necessary formation of the roadway. Box Hill Tunnel \u2014 under neath Norbury Park, on the Mid-Sussex route, was, under legislative compulsion, cut through without the aid of a single air shaft. The principal tunnels on the line beyond those referred to are the Bo-Peep at Hastings, and the Rotherfield. The Victoria Railway Bridge is so intimately associated with the working of the London Brighton and South Coast system, that a few particulars respecting it are appropriately placed here. The first stone of the original bridge was laid on the 9th of June, 1859. It crosses the Thames about 150 yards to the eastward of Chelsea Suspension Bridge at a point where the width of the water-way is 740 feet. It consists of four segmented wrought-iron arches, each having a span of 175 feet, and a headway of 22 feet above Trinity high- water level.

The bridge, which cost \u00a384,000, and sup ported two lines of railway, was opened for traffic on the 9th of June, 1860, just twelve months from its commencement. It contained the following quantities of materials : \u2014 16,800 cubic feet of timber, in floors 10,700 girt landings 5,750 cubic yards of concrete 6,500 \u201e \u201e brickwork 23,587 \u201e \u201e Portland stone 57,205 \u201e \u201e Bramley Fall stono 1,349 tons of wrought iron 204 \u201e cast iron 15J \u201e steel keys and collars. The bridge was designed by Mr. John Fowler, President Inst. C.E., and con structed by Mr. John Kelk, M.P., under the supervision of Mr. William Wilson. The rapid increase in the traffic to the Victoria Station, the western half of which is owned by the Brighton Company, used as it was by several companies, soon necessitated further facilities for meeting its claims, and in 1862 it was determined to widen the approaches to the station, and also the bridge, from the designs of Sir Charles Fox. The first stone of the extension was laid on the 22nd of February, 1865, the widening being carried out at the joint expense of the .London Brighton and South Coast and the London Chatham and Dover Railway Companies. The bridge now carries seven lines of rails and two platforms. The portion of the bridge carrying the platforms is so arranged that the addition of another rib in each span will allow of three more lines of way, making ten in all. The materials used in the widening were as follows : \u2014 280,000 cubic feet of timber. 220 tons of bolts and spikes in ditto. 20,350 cubic yards of excavation. 8,350 \u201e \u201e concrete. 13,800 \u201e \u201e brickwork. 39,900 \u201e feet of Portland stone. 52,300 \u201e \u201e Bramley Fall stone. 885 tons of cast iron. 3,541 \u201e wrought iron. The cost of the alterations was \u00a3161,000, making the total co9t of the bridge \u00a3245,000. It was certified as fit for traffic by the Board of Trade on the 1st of August, 1866. The contractors were Messrs. Peto, Betts <fe Co., Lucas Brothers, and W. and J. Pickering, who worked under the superintendence of Sir Charles Fox, Mr. Charles D. Fox, and Mr. E. Wragge (the resident engineer). The elevation of the terminus at London Bridge is in the Italian style (as also is that of the Brighton Central Station) and consists of three stories terminating with an ornamental cornice. The buildings, which adjoin those of the South Eastern Railway, cover an area of nearly two acres, and stand upon an artificial terrace or platform, reared upon a massive substructure of piers aud arches to an average height of twenty-two feet above the surface of the ground. The shed roofs, partly in wood iron and glass, are nearly eight hundred feet in length, with spans of more than one hundred feet. Pullman's Saloon Cars are daily attached to two of the express trains each way, between Victoria Station and Brighton, throughout the year. The constant use of these luxurious \" drawing-rooms on wheels \" is the most satisfactory evidence of the wisdom of this experiment to lessen the discomforts and increase the pleasures of a railroad journey. The London Brighton and South Coast Railway traverses a portion of the country rich in picturesque prospects, fertile domains, healthy resorts, and historic associa tions.

Demeanour. \u2014 To insure that world-renowned civility from French servants, officials and others, the visitor should be thoroughly courteous when making a request, or even when ordering refreshments at a cafe or restaurant. It is customary to address even persons of the lower classes as Monsieur, Madame, or Mademoiselle. The policemen, who are to be met with in every street and place of public resort, are always ready to furnish strangers with every information in their power. Cabs and Public Carriages. \u2014 Paris is well supplied with public carriages of all kinds. The omnibuses are numerous and well-conducted, but slow. The price is 30 c. (3d.) for the inside places, and 15 c. for the outside {imperiale). Almost all are in correspondence, and the passengers may claim a ticket of correspondence to go on by another omnibus if the one he gets into does not reach his destination. Care should be taken to tell the conductor on entering what part of Paris it is desired to reach. The omnibuses of the various lines are all indicated by letters of tha alphabet, and colours. These different colours are used in the various quarters or divisions of Paris for all public purposes. For fiacres or cabs, the fares are about one shilling for the course, as it is called, if not exceeding a quarter of an hour, and a little more for the longer courses. The price per hour is 2 frs. Full statements of the fares will be found suspended in all the carriages, and the driver must give the passenger a printed ticket of particulars, <tc. The prices tie nearly double between midnight and 6 a.m. in summer, or 7 a.m. in winter. Besides the fiacres (or voitures de place), there are a somewhat superior class of vehicles, belonging to private individuals, and known as voitures de remise. They are better fitted and travel more quickly. The fare for the short course is 1 fr. 50 c, for the longer 2 frs. By the hour 2 fr. 25 c. The visitor to Paris should learn the colour that belongs to the lanterns of the quarter of the city he resides in, and select cabs with lanterns of this colour on returning home. Places of Amusement. \u2014 The following establishments are the most frequented : \u2014 Conservatoire de Musique (classical music) ; Herz, Sainte-Ce'cile, Pre Catelan, Erard, Pleyel and Sax concert halls. The concerts of the Cafes Chantants are of an inferior description. Those in the Champ-Elysees attract numerous visitors in summer. The following are among the best establishments : Elelorado, Alcazar, Cafe- Concert Bataclan, and Grand Concert Parisien. Of Soire'es Musicales et Dansantes, the most frequented in summer are Jardin Mabille (balls on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays ; admission, 3 and 5 francs) ; Closerie des Lilas, (Jardin Bullier) ; the Chateau Rouge. In winter : Salle Valentino Casino, rue Cadet; Elysee-Montmartre. The Cascade Cafe', in tho Bois de Boulogne, and the Casino d'Asnieres are favourite summer resorts. The Masked Balls of the Grand Opera last from the middle of December till Lent, and take place every Saturday evening (admission 10 fr.). Theatres. \u2014 There are nearly 50 in Paris. The performances commence at various hours between 6 and 8 o'clock, and last till midnight. Tho best places are the stalls in front of the orchestra (fauteuils d'orchestre), behind which are the stalles d'oi chestre : those behind the pit (stalles d'amphithecitre) , and those in front of the first tier of boxes (fauteuils de balcon, de la premiere galerie). Ladies are not admitted in some theatres to the orchestra stalls. In the case of popular performances, seats should be secured by purchasing billets de location beforehand at the location office des the'dtres. These billets cost 1 or 2 francs more than those bought at the door, but the purchaser thereby reserves his seat. Hotels, Cafes, and Restaurants. \u2014 Although attendance is always an item in the hotel-bill, it is usual to give the head-waiter and the concierge a fee of 1 or 2 frs. per week, and the under-waiter by whom the traveller has been served, about 2 frs. In a few instances the payment for service is left to the discretion of the traveller, who is expected to give i or 1 fr. daily. Au occasional extra gratuity will"], [30, "XX Cieatly tend to ensure attention. Visitors should avoid keeping articles of value in the drawers or cupboards of their rooms. They should be entrusted to the care of the landlord, or sent to a banker. The cafes of Paris are one of the characteristic features of the city. They are to be found in all quarters of the town, and some are fitted up with great splendour. They are adapted for the entertainment of all classes of society. Billiards, cribbage and dominoes are allowed in Parisian caf.s. The traveller should select restaurants of the best class, at which a simple repast of 2 or 3 courses may be obtained for a reasonable sum. The visitor is not expected to drink expensive wines. The waiter expects about 1 sou on each franc spent. Ladies can dine at restaurants without attracting the observation which is so noticeable in London establishments. Money, Weights, and Measures. \u2014 The French coinage is very simple, and easily understood ; it is divided into tenths, on the decimal system. The coins consist of centimes (a \" sous \" is equal to 5 centimes) and francs. 100 centimes (or 20 sous) make a franc. 20 franc gold pieces were formerly styled Napoleons. For all ordinary dealings the visitor may calculate the franc as worth lOd. in English money. A3 the franc is actually worth only 9_d., if a halfpenny be taken off the value of each franc in making a calculation, the exact British equivalent will be found. The coinage system of Belgium, Italy, and Switzerland are similar to those of France, and equivalent in value. The franc becomes lira (singular), and lire (plural) ; the centime, centesimi, in Italian. In Holland 5 cents are about equivalent to Id. ; 1 florin or guilder (100 cents) to about ls. 7d. ; 1 gold ducat to about 9s. 4d.; and 1 gold 10-floriri piece to about 16s. 6d. In Germany 12 pfennige are about equivalent to ld. ; 1 mark (100 pfennige) to ls. ; 20-mark piece (gold) to \u00a31. The kihgramme, or kilo, as it is generally called, is the French ordinary weight by which goods sold by weight are quoted. It is equal to 2 lbs. 3 J ozs. avoirdupois ; a pound of any article is nearly equivalent to about a demi-kilo, which is 1 lb. IJ oz. avoirdupois. The unit of length is the metre, which is about 39 inches English ; 5J metres, nearly 6 yards ; 10 metres, 11 yards. The metre is divided into 100 centimetres. The kilometre is the road measure \u2014 3 miles are equal nearly to 5 kilometres ; 8 kilometres are 5 miles ; 10 kilometres are 6J miles ; 100 kilometres, 63 miles. The same measurement is also used in Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Liquid and dry measures are calculated by the litre, about If pint. An ordinary French wine bottle contains about a litre."], [31, "XXI LONDON HACKNEY CARRIAGE REGULATIONS, AND LIST OF FARES, TO AND FROM THE PRINCIPAL RAILWAY STATIONS TO THE POINTS NAMED.

The village is prettily situated on the river Arun, which is crossed by the railway just below the Station. Amberley Castle, a rectangular structure, which occupies an elevated position on the east side of the river, is of great antiquity and interest, and was anciently the residence of the Bishops of Chichester, its builder\u2014 somewhere about the year 1369 \u2014 being Bishop Rede. It was dismantled by the soldiery under the command of Sir W. J. Waller, soon after the surrender of Arundel Castle in 1643. It was at that time leased to the family of Lewknor, who, for their attachment and support of the king, were obnoxious to the Parliamentarians. The parish church is a fine specimen of Norman architecture. [PARHA.M \u2014 about three miles north-east of Amberley \u2014 is noted for its magnificent Elizabethan mansion, which contains one of the most varied collectionsof ancient and medi\u00e6val antiquities in England.

ANGMERING.- (STATION.)\u2014 A village and parish of the county of Sussex (western division); in East Preston union and Arundel county court district and petty sessional division. Angmering was originally composed of three parishes, which were nnited soon after the Refor mation. The church of West Angmering alone remains of those which once adorned the district ; with the exception of the tower it was wholly rebuilt in 1852. At New Place, in the parish (now partitioned into labourers' dwellings), were born upon three Sundays the three sons of Sir Edward Palmer. All threo were knighted by Henry VIII. Sir John, the eldest, who was born on Whit Sunday, was thrice sheriff of Surrey aud Sussex, and had the paternal seat at Angmering. The seoond brother, Sir Henry, born on Trinity Sunday, dis tinguished himself at the taking of Boulogne, and lost his life in the defence of Guisnes when more than seventy years of age. Sir Thomas, the younger of the three, made his fortune at the Court under Henry VIII. and Edward VI. ; but taking part with Dudley in favour of Lady Jane's title to the crown, was, on the accession of Mary, beheaded on Tower Hill. Angmering Park is a large and beautiful domain ; ad joining it is Badvvorth Park. The parish contains a Cathobc and Noncon formist Chapels. Area : 3,150 acres. Population : 1,019.

ARDINGLEY\u2014 A village and parish of the county of Sussex (eastern division) ; in Cuckfield union, county court district and petty sessional divi sion. It is designated as a probable sta tion on the line in course of construction between East Grinstead and Hayward's Heath. The parish is intersected by a Roman road and the river Ouse. The"], [76, "38 reduced to ruins. The present castle waa rebuilt as it now stands in 1791, and enlarged in 1850. The owner of the castle becomes Earl of Arundel in virtue of its possession alone, and thus the Howards, the Dukes of Norfolk, have been Earls of Arundel almost from the Norman period. The parliamentary re- presentation of the town was reduced to one member in 1832, and wholly ceased in 1868. Arundel was incorporated by Queen Elizabeth, the corporation con- sisting of a mayor, twelve burgesses, and a steward, with other officers ; an ar- rangement which continued, with slight modifications by other charters subse- quently granted, until the passing of the Municipal Corporations Act. The cor- poration is the urban sanitary authority, and has its own police force. The gas works belong to a joint-stock company ; the supply of water is obtained from wells. The parish church of St. Nicholas is a large cruciform structure, built in the fourteenth century, and contains many memorials of the Howards and Fitzalans ; the original chancel has been severed from the rest of the edifice by a brick wall. This was done by one of the Dukes of Norfolk, whose family claim (a claim sustained in a recent action at law) proprietary rights over it. The most interesting portion of the church is this chancel, or, as it is called, the \" Fitzalan Chapel.\" The only available access to this now is through the castle grounds, but it is not open to strangers. Here are a number of tombs, with and without effigies, sheltering the remains of former Earls of Arundel. Opening out of the chancel on the north side is the Lady Chapel, which contains some other tombs. Of Holy Trinity College portions only remain. The large Roman Catholic Chapel close to the church is a magnifi- cent Gothic structure, probably one of the finest modern buildings of the sort in England. It has been built by the late Duke of Norfolk at a cost of about \u00a3150,000. There are also Independent and other chapels ; a national school, founded by the late Duke of Norfolk ; a Roman Catholic school ; town hall ; and a reading society. The park comprises more than 1,100 acres of land with beautiful scenery. The trade of the town is chiefly in corn, timber, and bark Market Days: Alternate Mondays. Fairs : church is an interesting structure in the Decorated style, and contains a number of monumental effigies and brasses of the ancient families of Wakehursts and Culpeppers.

ARUNDEL.-(STAT10N.)\u2014Amu nicipal borough, market town and parish of the county of Sussex; in the poor-law union of East Preston, deanery and archdeaconry of Chichester, and rape of Arundel, 10 miles east by north of Chichester. It is situated on the river Arun, which is navigable hither from the sea for vessels of 250 tons. The town is of ancient date, and is mentioned in Domesday Boak. It is celebrated for its castle, which existed in the time of Edward the Confessor. The ancient structure is now in ruins, and the name is applied to a magnificent edifice erected during the latter part of the last century within the circuit of the old park. The keep is Norman and circular, about 80 feet in diameter externally at the top, and 100 feet high from the bottom of the fosse. It is built of rubble masonry, faced with small blocks of Caen stone ; a deep ditch protected part of it. The original entrance was through a Norman doorway on the south-east side. The ramparts are reached by a narrow winding staircase ; the view from them is one of great extent and beauty. The ground plan of the castle, as it at present exists, can be comprehended from ram parts, but the alterations have been so extensive during the last 100 years that it is not easy to form a clear conception as to the size and shape of the original structure. When attacked in 1643 by the Parliamentary troops, it held out for seventeen days. On this occasion im mense damage was done by cannon mounted on the tower of the neighbour ing church. Of the 49 castles mentioned in \" Domesday,\" that of Arundel is the only one which is said to have been standing in the reign of Edward the Confessor. Arundel Castle has beeu thrice besieged : in 1102 by Henry L, who captured it ; in 1139 by King Stephen ; and in 1644, when it surren dered to Sir William Waller, and was"], [77, "39 May 14, August 21, September 25, and December 17 (fat stock).

Three bridges, in addition to those of the railways, communicate across the river with Chelsea ; one is an ancient wooden structure, connecting the old part of Battersea with Chelsea ; an iron suspension bridge, named the Vic- toria, is a mile lower down the river \u2014 this latter was completed in 1858, after a design by Page ; the third ia a suspen- sion bridge connecting Chelsea with Battersea Park, called the Albert Bridge, and was opened in 1873. The whole area of the parish is thickly populated, and covered with large factories. It is crossed by railways iu almost every di- rection. Battersea Park is 1 98 acres in extent, and tastefully planted with trees and flowers, with a carriage drive and an equestrian road round it, and intersected by numerous gravel walks ; it has an ornamental lake covering 23 acres. 34 acres are laid down in grass as a cricket ground, divided into three parts, the first for the use of clubs, the second for matches, and the third for general prac tice.

BATTLE. \u2014 (Station \u2014 ST. LEONARD'S \u2014 6 miles.)\u2014 A market town, parish and urban sanitary dis- trict of the county of Sussex (eastern division) ; in Battle union and petty ses- sional division, an d Hastings county court district. The ancient name of the place was Epiton, but it takes its present one from the celebrated Battle of Senlac (more generally called Hast- ings), fought in the year 1066, between William of Normandy and Harold, the last of the Saxon kings. Battle Abbey, now the seat of the Duke of Cleveland, K.G., was founded by William, and dedicated to St. Martin, in commemora- tion of the struggle, the high altar occupying the spot where the Saxon royal standard was placed. In the Abbey was preserved the celebrated Battle Abbey Roll, which formed a list of those families which came over with William. The great hall is remarkable for its timber roof ; it is 57 feet in length, the same in height, and 31 feet wide. The gate-house, or entrance from the town, directly fronts the street from the London-road ; it is a tower, about 35 feet square and 54 feet high, comprising three stories, with an oc- tagon turret at each angle, and is thought to have been erected some- where about the time of Edward IIL, when the Abbey was enclosed and for- tified ; it is one of the most perfect specimens of monastic gate-houses in the kingdom. \u25a0 The ruins of the Abbey cover three sides of a square. There are nine elegant arches remaining of the Abbey church: the public are admitted to view the Abbey on Tuesdays. The church of St. Mary was founded by Ralph, Abbot of Battle from 1107 to 1124. The font is a good specimen of the Norman style. Beneath the chancel is a spacious vault, in which the remains of the Webster family are deposited, and there are some ancient brasses, line painted glass, and several monuments, one to Sir Anthony Browne, k.g., Master of tho Horse to Henry VIII., who died in 1558. There are gunpowder mills in the neighbourhood. Market Day: Second Tuesday in each month. Area : 8,152acres. Population: 3,495. Principal Hotel : The George. [Neiherfield is a"], [79, "41 large hamlet within the parish of Battle, and is noted for its gypsum mine.] BAYNARD S. \u2014 (STATION.) \u2014 This station is in the parish of Cranleigh (which see), and takes its name from the ancient house built by one of the Mores of Loseley. It is a fine old man sion in the Tudor style ; the picture gallery contains several masterpieces by the old masters, and there is a collection of armour, ancient weapons and relics, the charter chest of Sir Thomas More, in which his head was for many years kept, a circumstance which gave rise to the rumour that Baynards was haunted, the tournament shield of Henry VIII. when Prince of Wales, and some fine specimens of Gobelin tapestry. Baynards, with other lands, formed the Royal demesne of Gomselle, which is thus men tioned in Domesday Book. \u2014 \" The king holds Gomselle in demesne \u2014 Earl Harold held it.\" The estate remained in the hands of the crown until 1135, and it was for some time the residence of Margaret Roper, the daughter of Sir Thomas More.

BEACHY HEAD. \u2014(Station \u2014 EASTBOURNE\u2014 3 miles.) \u2014Beachy Head is a cliff which forms a spur of the SouthDowns, about 500 fee tin height, and much resorted to for the extensive land and sea views obtained. On it is a coast guard station. It is in the civil parish of Eastbourne. About two and a half miles west is the Belle Tout light-house, which exhibits a revolving light. It replaced, in 1831, a wooden structure which had done good service in warning off shipping \u2014 wrecks from the rocky nature of the coast having been frequent. The Belle Tout light is visible 14 miles out at sea. BEDDINGTON.-(STATION.)\u2014 A village and parish of the county of Surrey (mid division) ; in Croydon union, county court district and petty sessional division. The parish church is a fine old building in the Perpen dicular style, which was restored and enlarged in 1852. It contains numerous brasses and tombs of the Carew family. Other objects of interest are the miserere seats, the excellent memorial windows of stained glass, and the panel painting of the Day of Judgment. There is mention of an earlier church in Domesday. Not far from the church is Beddington Hall, now the Female Orphan Asylum, which contains the original timber rcof of the old mansion house of the Carews, who lived here from the fourteenth to the eighteenth century, when the family became extinct. At Beddington Sir Francis Carew entertained Queen Eliza beth, and showed her his splendid gar dens and orangery, for which his place was famous. Sir Walter Raleigh was his brother-in-law, and it was from him that Sir Francis obtained the seeds of the oranges. It is stated tbat in 1690 the trees were 13 feet high and upwards, and ten thousand oranges were gathered from them. They all died in the severe winter of 1739. Area : 3,931 acres. Population : 2,834. Average Train Ser vice : Nine each way on week days ; five each way on Sundays. Fares from London Bridge : 1/6 /, 1/2 s, lOd. t. Re turn Tickets (4 days), 2/6/, 2/- s, 1/6 t.

BERMONDSEY, SOUTH \u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 Bermondsey is a metro politan parish ofthe county of Surrey, and in the parliamentary borough of South wark. It was once,however, celebratedfor monastic institutions. A band of Cluniac Monkssettledberesome 900 years ago, and founded the monastery of \" Beormund's Eye,\" meaning island. The Priory church was pulled down in 1545, and Bermondsey Houso built with the materials. This became the residence of Thomas Ratcliffe, Earl of Essex, Chamberlain to Queen Elizabeth. He died there in 1583. Spa Road in this parish takes its name from a chalybeate spring, discovered about 1770. An attempt was once made to establish in connection therewith a fashionable Pleasure Garden.

BOGNOR.-(STATION)\u2014 A mar ket town, urban sanitary district, and watering place in the parish of South Bersted and county of Sussex (western division) ; in West Hampnett union, and Chiohester county courtdistrict and petty sessional division. Bognor owes its rise to Sir Richard Hotham, a London mer chant, who resided here in 1785. It has become a fashionable summer resort and watering place, the beach being very ex tensive, and suited for bathing. A pier was constructed in 1865, at a cost of \u00a35,000 ; it is 18 feet wide, and extends 1,000 feet into the sea ; upon the head a band plays every evening during the summer months. The promenade, paved with bricks, and nearly one mile in length, constructed at a cost of \u00a38,000, was opened 1870. Her Majesty, when Princess Victoria, with her mother, the late Dhchess of Kent, resided several summers at Bognor Lodge, which was erected by Sir Richard Hotham. There are numerous lodging houses, warm and cold baths, libraries, reading and subscrip tion rooms, and an assembly room. Bognor is close to Selsey Bill, a conspicuous pro montory running out into the English Channel. To the west is Pagham har bour, noted for its \"Hushing Well.\" Over a space about 1 30 feet long and 30 feet wide, the water is \" apparently in a state of ebullition from the rushing of immense volumes of air to the surface. The noise of the bursting bubbles re sembles the simmering of a huge caul dron, and may sometimes be heard at Selsey Church, nearly half a mile distant. Bognor church was built in 1821, and there are several chapels. The market house erected in 1822 is open daily. Nine miles from the shore is the Ower's light ship, which serves to warn mariners osa dangerous reef of rocks opposite town. Area: \u2014 acres. Popvlatmo . 2,811. Principal Hotel : Norfolk Arms.

BISHOPSTONE .\u2014(STA- TION.) \u2014 A coast village and parish of the county of Sussex (eastern division) ; in Newhaven union and Lewes county court district and petty sessional division. The parish church of St. Giles is ancient; the tower is in four storeys, each smaller than the one immediately below it. The large buildings close to the station are those of a tide-mill, the motive power of \u25a0which is provided by impounding the tidal waters when at flood, and letting them out to drive the machinery as re- quired.

BONCHURCH, ISLE OF WIGHT.\u2014 (Station\u2014 VENTNOR\u2014 1| miles.) \u2014 A village, parish and bathing place of the Isle of Wight, beautifully situated between Ventnor and Dunnose Head. The village is in a very narrow valley, formed by an immense maBS of fallen cliff, watered by copious springs, which amalgamate at its foot into an extensive sheet of water, environed by a large number of elms of luxuriant growth, which aid in imparting a singularly secluded air and sheltered retirement to this wonderful tract; and as the habi- tations with which the district now abounds, are placed in the numerous glens and nooks assigned by the dis- ruptured fragments, a romantic combi- nation of the sublime and beautiful is produced, that cannot be exceeded if it can be paralleled. At the eastern ex- tremity of the village, and amid similar scenery, is the church and school house, erected in the year 1847, by the late Re v. W. Adams. A secluded portion of the roadway on the right conducts to the ancient and primitive church of Bon- church, which is supposed to date from Saxon times. It stands at the edge of the cliff, and in its disused appearance, scarcely asks for more than the reverence of a remembrance of past ages ; but even in the homeliness of its simplicity,a world of interest has been created, from its having been selected as the last resting- place of the Rev. John Sterling, who died at Bonchurch, September 18th, 1844, as well as of the revered and lamented Rev. W. Adams, the author of the \"Old Man's Home,\" \"Shadow of the Cross.\" (fee., works in which he teaches nothing by his words, whereof he did not give a good example by his deeds. The latter died at Bonchurch, January 17th, 1847, and is interred beneath an appropriate stone memorial, on the south side of the yard ; a cross being so placed that its shadow may be thrown over the stone which covers his grave. Domesday Book records the manor of Bonchurch or St. Boniface, of which it is a corruption, by the name of Bone- cerce ; but it is doubtful if much of the present church could have then existed, as the fragments of the Norman era which remain are evidently of the twelfth cen- tury ; although it is probable that the site was occupied by a prior erection. The interior is of unpretending guise, corresponding with the exterior, and contains only a few footworn epitaphs, and an early Norman arch, by which the chancel is apportioned. There are a large number of beautiful residential seats and villas in and around Bonchurch. The hotel in the village is the \" Bon- church Hotel,\" which has acquired a well-deserved reputation as one of the best and most comfortable in England. It faces due south, is most beautifully situated, and commands very fine views of the sea from the house and grounds. The Right Hon. Sir Lawrence Peel, in writing of the view, says: \" One of the most beautiful views which Bonchurch contains is that from the flagstaff in the garden of the hotel. I have never seen anywhere a more charming sea view.\" Area: 561 acres. Population: 641. BOSHAM. \u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 A vil lage and parish of the county of Sussex (western division); in Westbourne union, and Chichester county court district and petty sessional division. Bosham is a very ancient place, the church, which is partly of Saxon architecture, and has been recently restored, figures in the celebrated Bayeux tapestry, King Harold having sailed hence on his unfortunate journey to Normandy. King Canute had a castle here, and one of his daughters was buried in the church. Near the south porch is the tomb of Thomas a Becket's secretary, Herbert de Boreham. The village is nearly surrounded by the estuary known as Bosham Creek and Chichester Harbour. Area : 3,194 acres of land and 645 of water. Population : 1,184. Average Train Service ; Five each way on week days * two each way on Sundays. Fares from London Bridge : 13/9 f, 10/- s, 5/6 t. Return Tickets (8 days), 23/8/, 16/6 s, 11/- 1. BOX HILL.\u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 This station takes its name from the magnifi- cently wooded hill which overlooks the town of Dorking, and is thickly clothed with plantations of yew trees, from which \"box wood\" is obtained. From its summit a view of the country for many miles can be secured, and commanding, as it does, some of the most beautiful scenery to be found in the United King-"], [82, "44 dom, it is much frequented in summer by visitors from the metropolis. The river Mole flows underneath the hill, and it is from this circumstance that the stream takes its name. The mansion on the brow of the elevation, opposite the north-west slope of Box Hill, is Denbies, the seat of the Right Hon. Geo. Cubitt, M.P. A short distance from it is Ran niore Common, with its graceful church and spire, built by Mr. Cubitt at his sole expense. The gorge, or defile, between Its claim to rank as a chartered eorpora tion is based upon a document or deed \u2014 it can scarcely be deemed a charter \u2014 of 1 Edward VI. The corporation seems at present to consist of two bailiffs and a leet jury of 13 members nominated annually by the bailiffs. It claims to exist by prescription. There is no ma gisterial or licensing jurisdiction claimed, and in fact Brading seems scarcely en titled to be called a municipal corpora tion. There is a mark et- house, although VIEW FROM BOX HILL Box Hill and Denbies is the only natural opening through the North Downs along an extent of many miles. The station is in the parish of Dorking, and close to Burford Bridge, a favourite halting- place for travellers. Average Train Service : Twelve each way on week days; six each way on Sundays. Fares from Lon don Bridge: 3/8 /, 2/10 s, 1/10 t. Return Tickets (4 days), 5/2 /, 4/- s, 2/10 1. BRADING, ISLE OF WIGHT. \u2014(STATION.) \u2014 An ancient incorpora tion and parish of the Isle of Wight. no market is now held, andit is one of the few boroughs which remained unaffected by the Reform Bill, from the circum stance that the privilege once enjoyed of sending members to the legislature had then long ceased, in accordance with the prayer of a petition from the inhabit ants still extant, wherein they ask the House of Commons to relieve them from such service, on account of their in ability to support their members ; four pence perdiem being the sum apportioned to each representative. The church dedicated to the Virgin, and adjoining"], [83, "45 the market-house, is an extensive struc ture, of much antiquity, and although one of the oldest in the island, does not by some centuries approach the age usually assumed for it in connection with the assertion of its having been the building wherein Wilfred, Bishop of Selsea, baptized in 704 the first converts to Christianity within the island. It is a building of various eras ; of which the south aisle is the most recent, and the arches which divide the nave from the side aisles the most ancient part. Its monuments are elaborate and interesting, especially those of the Oglander family, contained in a private chapel at the north-east point. Within the altar rails, there is also a laboriously and elegantly incised stone, of foreign workmauship, originally richly inlaid with silver, in scribed to the memory of John Cherowin, Kuight, High Constable of Porchester Castle, who died in 1441, and who it is evident by a reference to the arms, viz. : ar. fretty gu., a chief az. same as those lst and 4th on the stone, belonged to the family of Curwen, of Wokington and Sella Park, in the county of Cumberland where they settled at an early period ; and at the extreme eastern end of the north aisle two elaborate -altar tombs, will likewise be noticed, and in the churchyard several epitaphs. Amongst the more unlettered monuments of af fection there is one which emanated from the pen of the Rev. Mr. Gill, a former curate of Newchurch, and lias since acquired much celebrity. The stone which informs us that \"Jane, the Young Cottager, lies huried here, \"' will revive the memory of her history, so affectingly told by the Rev. Legh Richmond in his \" Annals of the Poor.\" Legh Richmond was for some time the officiating minister of Brading, and it was whilst residing here that the interesting Tracts, which have so widely circulated his piety and name, were com posed. When nearly at the termination of the long street of which the town of Brading consists, a lane on the right will conduct the visitor to the abode of \" The Young Cottager.\" The river Brading (or Eastern Yar) here falls into a large shoaly creek, about two miles long by one mile broad, but contracting to a narrow channel at its outlet near Bem bridge Point. At full tides this haven has the appearance of an extensive lake, enclosed by gentle slopes, and finely wooded to the water's edge. Several at tempts have been made to exclude the sea from the haven, in which oysters and other shell fish are plentiful. At Morton Farm, in this parish, extensive remains of a Roman Villa were dis covered in August, 1880 ; they are very interesting, and steps have been taken to preserve them for exhibition to the public. Area : 8,272 acres. Population: parish, 5,648 ; town, 1,200. BRAMBER. \u2014 (STATION.) \u2014 A small village and parish of the county of Sussex (western division) ; iu Steyning union, Brighton county court district, and Steyning petty sessional division. Until 1832 this place returned two members ti i Parliament. It is now chiefly visited for the sake of its ruined castle, the pro perty of the Duke of Norfolk. Domesday Book mentions the existence of a castle at Bramber, which was given by the Con queror to Willi .m de Braose ; very little is, however, known of its history. Tlie ground-plan appears to have been some thing like that of an irregular parallelo gram. Of the outer wall, chiefly formed of boulders and flints, a good deal re mains, but ivy and bushes preveut a close inspection. A large and deep moat, still fairly complete, though blocked up by trees, protected the castle on tlie N.W. and S. sides ; on the E. side the river and marshes were a sufficient pro tection. Within the main enclosure there now exists nothing but one wall of a lofty square tower, and an immense mound of earth enveloping, it is thought, the ruins of the keep. The parish church was erected anterior to the Norman era, and was given to the monks of St. Florence, in France, by William de Braose ; it was partly restored in 1870. The village possesses a natural history museum of considerable interest,collected by an inhabitant named Potter. Area : 854 acres. Population: 373.

The parish i church, mentioned in Domesday Book, was restored in 1850. Bramley House is a picturesque mansion. Near to Bramley is the village of Wonersh and Wonersh Park, the seat of Lord Grantley. Wonersh church contains a brass (six teenth century) to Henry Eliot, his wife, | and twenty- three children. Bramley was until 1847 a chapelry in the parish of Shalford. Area: 4,008 acres.

B R I G H T O N.\u2014 (Five Stations | \u2014 CENTRAL, WEST, LONDON j ROAD, LEWES ROAD, and KEMP ' TOWN.) \u2014 A parliamentary (returning two members) and municipal borough in the eastern division of the county of Sussex ; it is locally situated iu Whalesbone hundred and Lewes rape, : and the poor-law union of Brighton and | Steyning. It communicates with London in addition to the main line \u2014 50J miles \u2014 by the Mid-Sussex route of the same railway ; with Portsmouth, 44 miles dis tant, by the western branch ; with Hastings by the eastern branch ; and by steamers from Newhaven with Dieppe (France), 80 miles distant. Hove is an urban sanitary township adjoining Brighton on the west ; the district maintains its own police force. A detailed guide to the place will not j be looked for here ; numerous descrip- | tions of the town and neighbourhood I ;ire to be purchased at all the prin- j cipal booksellers. Brighton has been j designated, and not without good reason, i \" the Queen of English watering-places.\" The name of this locality, until a com- I paratively recent period, was Bright- hehnston or Brighthelmstun. The earli- est recorded possessor of the spot was j Ulnoth, father of Earl Godwin. About and partially burnt by the French. This alarm led the mariners to erect the Block House, which fortification seems to have answered the intended purpose, for although Brighthelmston was alarmed by the passage of tho Spanish Armada, in 1588, it suffered no more from foreign attack. Brighton was first incorporated as a municipal borough in 1854. The Local Government Act was adopted in 1858, and the provisions of most of the succeeding Acts of Parliament affecting municipal aud sanitary government have been availed of. It is a quarter sessions borough, and has a commission of the peace and police force distinct from the county. A complete system of main drainage has been executed, and the town council have from time to time effected extensive substantial improve ments. The waterworks are the property of the corporation, but the gasworks aro owned by companies. There are two cemeteries, one vested in the burial board appointed by the parochial autho rities, the other in a company. Previous to 1782 Brighton was only a fishing village, but became a fashionable water ing-place when George IV., then Prince of Wales, came here to reside, and built the Pavilion. This latter edifice is the property of the town, and has been, as far as possible, restored to its original splendour. A handsome promenade and seawall stretches along the shore for three miles, and the chain pier (built in 1826) projects nearly a quarter of a mile into the sea. The new pier was completed in 1866, its situation being near the site of the battery ; it is 1,115 feet in length by 155 wide. There are more than 700 streets, terraces, crescents, and squares in the town. Several of the hotels are exceedinglv handsome structures. The celebrated Aquarium (unequalled in the world) covers a space of the reclaimed sea beach at the east end of the pro menade. The churches are very numer ous. St. Peter's, at the north end of the town, is the parish church ; besides which there are St. Nicholas', St. Paul's, St, Mark's, St. George's, and many others, and more than 50 chapels for almost every religious denomination. The other principal public buildings and institutions are the town hall, raised at a cost of \u00a350,000 ; the public baths, a large market, a theatre, cavalry aud his time Brighthelmston was formed into throe manors, of which it still consists. After the Conquest these were apportioned, with a great many others, in Sussex, to the Conqueror's j sou-in-law, William de Warrenne. Iu 1513 the town was plundered"], [85, "47 infantry barracks, hospitals, dispensaries, and almshouses. Brighton contains the usual proportion of public schools, such as national, British, union, parochial, and other schools ; but in addition to . these, there are a college for young men and boys ; a diocesan training callege ; St. Mary's Hall, for the daughters of poor clergymen ; a dissenters' proprie tary college, and a large number of pri vate establishments. Brighton does not boast any manufactures. The inhabitants devote themselves almost solely to the entertainment of visitors. There are nearly 1,000 lodging-house keepers who ply a profitable business quite indepen dent of the extensive public and private hotel accommodation. An extensive mackerel and herring fishery is also carried on. The Market Day is Thursday, and held principally for the sale of corn.

The district has come to be regarded as a residential suburb of Brighton, from which place it is distant ten miles. St. John's Common adjoins. The church was built in 1862. There are several dissenting places of worship and a literary institute, Board schools, and gas and water companies. Bricks, tiles, and brownware are largely manu factured here. [The village of Ditchling is a little less than two miles distant, and is notable for its splendid hill, \" Ditchling Beacon,\" 858 feet above the sea.] Fairs are held annually on the Sth of July aud the 5th of October (sheep and lambs). Population: 2,764. Average Train, Service: Nine each way on week days ; four each way on Sun days. Fares from London, Bridge : 10/1/, 7/9 s, express ; 8/3 /*, 5/9 s, 3/5\u00a3 t, ordi nary.

BUXTED. \u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 A vil lage and parish of the county of Sussex (eastern division) ; in Uckfield union and petty sessional division, and Lewes county court district. The parish church is an ancient stone building in the Deco rated style. Holy Trinity Church, High Hurst Wood, was built in 1871. Buxt.ed Park, the seat of Colonel Harcourt ; the mansion is a massive red brick structure, and the park is well stocked with deer. A house on the estate is known as Hog- House. It was once the residence of a family named Hogge, who are reputed to have cast the first cannon in England ; over the porch is an iron casting of a hog, bearing date 1581. Buxted was 200 years ago one of the most important of the Sussex iron manufactories. The Chillies is another fine estate belonging to Mr. J. D'A. Saniuda. A Fair is held annually (for cattle and sheep) on"], [86, "48 some small portions adjacent to tho church are still to be recognized ; but of an insignificant, uninteresting, character. The Church, however, dedicated to St. Mary, is an imposing, though fragmen tal edifice, and has suffered much from the decrease of population ; the chancel and one of the side aisles having been taken down to save the expense of repair at the suggestion of Walsingham, in the reign of Elizabeth, and at the same time, many incongruous adaptations effected. The foundation of the structure can with safety be ascribed to the Saxon era, al though the present edifice is far from evidencing so remote a construction. By William Fitzosbome it was in all probability re-edified, as some small por tions of the design of such a date may, on minute examination, be discerned. The tower is a good specimen of the Perpendicular, or Lancasterian style, a prominent feature in the surrounding landscape, and bears a great affinity to that of Chale. The interior of the church possesses some few monuments more remarkable for their singularity of style and diction, than public interest; that of Captain Keeling has been often quoted ; and there is also a memorial to Lady Wadham, wife of Sir W. Wadham, captain of the island in the reign of Henry VII. : and an incised slab of great antiquity. It is also worthy of remark in connection with the church of Carisbrooke, that the parishes of North wood and Newport are properly depen dent on it, and that the Rev. Alexander Ross, on whom Butler in his Hudibras is so severe, held the living of Caris brooke, but wa9 ejected from it for his loyalty to King Charles I. The castle of Carisbrooke is placed on a steep and pro jecting knoll of the adjacent range of chalk hills, the position being one of considerable strength and commanding influence, and thesite itself arelic of avery primitive age in the history of the island. To treat of the early associations of this once important fortress, would cause the writer to descend into very remote an tiquity \u2014 for ages before the Roman galleys touched the shores of the island, and when the eminences around were clothed with the entanglement of a vast primeval forest, a place of defence here existed, and the chronicle of the castle of Carisbrooke is, in fact, an epitome of July 31st.

CARISBROOKE, ISLE OF WIGHT. \u2014 (Stations \u2014 NEWPORT or SHIDE\u2014 1 mile.) \u2014 A village and parish forming part of the borough of Newport (see under that head), in the Isle of Wight. Although the crowning glory of the place is its renowned castle, it has other claims to notice in the Albany (or Parkhurst) Barracks, the Juvenile Reformatory, and Parkhurst Forest. The barracks were begun in 1798, on a portion of the forest. The entire establishment covers about 100 acres of land, the situation being extremely airy and healthy, and the general arrangements and accommo dations perfect. The number of soldiers stationed here is usually about 1,500, partly infantry and partly artillery. Nearly adjoining the barracks is the Parkhouse Prison or General Reform atory for Juvenile Offenders, an insti tution of considerable magnitude and interesting arrangement, but which can not be viewed without an express order from the Home Secretary. The number of convicts in course of training often times exceeds 600, and the principal design is, that they should be here initi ated into some useful trade, to enable them on their liberation to obtain an honest subsistence. On first admittance they receive a sound education, uuder a system peculiar to the prison discipline ; every endeavour being at the same time used to instil the principles of religion and morality. They are then selected for the various trades. From the High Street a promenade, designated the Mall, leads in a direct course to the village and castle of Carisbrooke, whose venerable towers, reared against the distant horizon, attract the eye and excite the fancy of the visitor as he approaches the town of Newport, in almost every direction. The village of Carisbrooke retains but few vestiges of its pristine importance ; its prosperity having declined as the fortunes of its now more considerable neighbour prospered and advanced. Of the ancient Priory of Carisbrooke, founded by William Fitzosbome in 1071,"], [87, "49 the history of the island itself, as from its walls issued the edicts by which the Roman legion and the Saxon band were guided, and the feudal system of the Norman Conqueror enforced ; many a dark deed being perpetrated, and the customs and usages of successive gene rations maintained within them, until the development of increasing civiliza tion and freedom sent better days to England ; since which time the shadows of time have gone on deepening, and it has become a mere idle curiosity, a dreary remnant of a deserted far-off wreck. The castle marks the site of one of those rude and almost primeval fort- tract that not only evidences its having been the principal point of opposition to the invading Saxons, but that likewise gives the exact derivation of its name. \u2014 Whit-garas-byrg, signifying the castle or fortress on the White Promontory, a inscription with which it exactly accords. During the succeeding ages it of course underwent many vicissitudes, alternating in the possession of the Saxons and Danes, and being made subservient to their several modes of defence, until the coming of the Normans, under William Fitzosbome. By this Baron the first permanent stone erection was most pro bably designed, his work eventually UOL'ND TOWERS, CARISBROOKE CASTLE resses composed of a raised earthen vallum and fosse, a formation which still retains its original position as the sub- structure of the after erections, and although n_>thing has been hitherto discovered that connects it by positive evidence with the Roman epoch, there can be no reasonable hesitation in con- sidering it to have been an important station in the hands of that people. In the year 530, however, we have recorded mention of its existence and importance, it being written in the \" Saxon Chroni- cle,\" \" This year (530) Cerdic and Cynric conquered the Island of Wight and slew many men at Whit-garas-byrg,\" an ex- giving place to the improvements which the increasing knowledge of the art of war devised, until the original structure became incorporated in that of De Woodville. The records of that far-off time tell of successive additions being effected by its various lords and captains, especially by Montacute, Earl of Salis bury, in the 9th of Richard II. , and by Lord Woodville in the reign of Edward IV., by whom the castle itself must have been nearly re-constructed ; and finally, when under the command of Sir George Carey, in the time of Elizabeth, the old castle was entirely surrounded by the more modern fortification, under the"], [88, "50 superintendence of an Italian engineer named Genebella, and on the same plan as the citadel of Antwerp. From the era of the Conquest, until the seizure of the island by Edward I., on the death of Isabella de Fortibus, the castle of Caris- brooke was the seat of the insular feudal government; and where, as the residence of its lords, many of them maintained great state and dignity \u2014 especially the last possessor of the miniature kingdom, the Countess Isabella, who appears to have been a strenuous asserter of her rights and privileges against the en- croaching propensities of the neighbour- ing monastic establishments. After the annexation of the lordship to the crown of England, the castle of Carisbrooke was invariably conferred on the successive holders of this honour ; many historic names being associated with it in conse- quence of such grant. By Edward II. it was bestowed on his son Prince Edward, Earl of Chester, afterwards Edward III. ; Richard II. conveyed it to Montacute, Earl of Salisbury ; and, on the death of this earl, Thomas Holland, Duke of Surrey, had a grant of the castle of Ca- risbrooke ; Edward, Duke of Rutland, afterwards Duke of York,and Humphrey, the good Duke of Gloucester, also pos- sessed it under similar tenure ; the half- defaced shields of several cf these noble- men still remaining in various parts of the building, and identifying the masonry with the era of their command. Under the feudal government of the islaud the tenants held their lands as of the castle of Carisbrooke, and were bound to defend it for forty days at their own charges, whenever it should be attacked ; but, though oftentimes assailed by the French, it was never surrendered to them. It was, however, during the civil wars be- tween Charles and the Parliament, that t\\\\e precincts of Carisbrooke were the scenes of incidents so impressive, that \u25a0during the succeeding centuries its ivy- mantled ruins have been clothed with undying interest. At the commence- ment of this unfortunate struggle, the captain of the island was Jerome, Earl of Portland, a partisan of t he ki*\u00b0g ; tut having rendered himself ohn o xious to \u2022 the prevailing faction by his loyalty, he was seized and imprisoned, his countess still retaining possession of Carisbrooke. and with a garrison of only 20 men commanded by Col. Brett, defended it against the republican party until she obtained honourable terms of capitu lation. In 1647, the castle was com manded by Col. Hammond, nephew to Dr. Hammond, chaplain to the king, and the unfortunate Charles, as is well known, when unable any longer to make head against the Parliament, sought refuge with him, vainly hoping to find the hand of friendship extended to him in his reverses. After the execution of Charles, his children \u2014 the Princes- Elizabeth and the Duke of Gloucester \u2014 were confined in the castle ; where Elizabeth died on the 8th of September, 1650, and was buried at Newport. Two years after the death of his sister, the prince was liberated by the advice and influence of Cromwell, who ordered \u00a3500 to be paid from the treasury to defray the expense of his removal; the only condition imposed being that he should sail direct from the Isle of Wight, and touch at no part of the English coast. The approach to the castle is highly pic turesque, and affords many pleasing views ; the ground on which it stands being finely broken, and well verdured. The extensive outworks faced with stone were designed by the orders of Queen Elizabeth, as was also the outer gateway, on which her initials are inscribed. The entrance is by a bridge on the west sidj, after passing over which, and a second bridge, we arrive at a strong and imposing machicolated gateway with portcullis, flanked with two round towers; a portion of the renovations of Lord Woodville in the time of Edward IV., as his arms, supported by the white rose of the house of York, are still visible on the only remaining stone of the now uppermost course of masonry. It must not, however, be understood that the entire gatehouse was the work of this nobleman, as the inner portion, together with the iron-bound gate itself, are evi- dently of a somewhat older date, and should in all probability be attributed to the lordship of the Earl of Salisbury iu the previous reign. On entering *\u2022\u25a0\"' courtyard of the castle there will be observed to the right, the Chapel of St. Nicholas, a military appointment, but one to which no duties appertain. It claims parochial dependence from several scattered portions of land in the"], [89, "51 vicinity, as well as from that small part of the town of Newport termed Castle hold, and it is thus mentioned in the inquisition taken after the death of Isa bella de Fortibus : \" The advowson of \u25a0the Free Chapel of the blessed Nicholas in the castle of Carisbrooke belongs to the Abbot and Convent of Quarr ; the building in the same castle consists of (to wit) one hall, four chambers adjoin ing the hall, with a cellar, one small chapel, and another great chapel, which chapels are supported at the charge of the Abbot of Quarr.\" The present building was erected in 1738. The range of buildings in advance were the apartments of the governor, an elevation of incongruous appearance and variety of eras, ranging apparently from before the time of Henry I. to that of George II. , or thereabouts ; but to Montacute, Earl of Salisbury, whose arms are sculp tured on one of tho remaining but tresses, the foundation of a great portion is evidently attributable. The original plan extended so far south as nearly to join the chapel, leaving only a narrow passage to the second court, within which were the barracks, magazine, well, (fee. The rooms which were occu pied by King Charles after his surrender to Hammond, are next to the tower on which the Salisbury shield appears, and it was from the room on the first floor that the first attempt at escape was made. The mullioned window, however, gave place to the more modem inno vations of Lord Bolton, and an object which would have been of the most engrossing interestwas then irremediably destroyed. From this portion of the building the king was removed to the quarters of the chief officer, in which a presence and bedchamber were assigned to his majesty's use. The site of the presence chamber is still easily dis tinguishable, as to it appertained the window which has been for some time looked on with a feeling of curiosity from the allusions made to it in all the recent narratives of the king's projecteel escapes. It has thereby been made me morable, but incorrectly so, as the first attempt at escape was made from the residence appropriated to the governor, and the succeeding effort was again de signed through the window of the bed room. This room communicated with the principal chamber by an irregular passage, and the window, although blocked up in after alterations, is never theless still easily recognizable on the exterior of the wall, as it nearly adjoins the only buttress on this side of the castle, and is as described by Hammond about eight feet from the bank beneath. The well is full 300 feet in depth, and although not of the antiquity usually attributed to it, having been sunk after the Conquest, is deservedly an attractive object of attention. The water is raised by a treadwheel of extraordinary dimen sions, worked by a donkey, several of whose predecessors have attained almost incredible longevity; there being also a curious experiment usually made for the satisfaction cf the spectator \u2014 the descent of a lamp, from the light of which, tht walling is distinctly observed as far as it extends ; but above half the tlistance from the top, to the surface of the water, 210 feet, the space is hewn through the natural strata. The lamp in descending creates a sound like that of the rushing wind, and, as it burns on the surface of the water, sufficient time is afforded for observing the well at the almost un paralleletl depth. The Keep or Donjon, having an ascent of 72 steps, is placed on an artificial mound thrown up about the time of the Heptarchy, at the north east limit of the inner boundary of the castle. It is in form an irregular poly gon, having a breadth of about 00 feet, and in architectural design is of the time of Henry I., with the addition of an outer doorway and portcullis of that of Edward IV. ; there being also that necessary adjunct to every place of defence, a well, originally of great depth ; but, by the lodgment of a quantity of rubbish, the lower portion of the deseent is now obscured. From the small re maining portion of the platform, u panoramic view of the greater part of the island, and opposite coasts of Hamp shire and Sussex, of considerable extent, is visible. At the south-east angle of the main fortress are likewise the re mains of a tower, called Mountjoy's, having walls in some places 18 feet thick ; whilst from the ramparts of the castle itself, a height of nearly 300 feet from the valley below, many picturesque snatches of the village of Carisbrooke, and surrounding neighbouring scenery,"], [90, "52 are to be obtained ; thoughts of the listed tournay, and the vassal-filled hall, forming a most delightful day dream in the mind of the spectator, as he looks on the crumbling battlement and ruined tower, and broods over their vanished greatness in a reverie of vain regret. The outer works of the castle, covering about 20 acres of ground, are of the form of an irregular pentagon, within them being the ancient tilt-yard, adapted as a bowling-green by Col. Hammond for the amusement of Charles I., and the whole surrounded by a deep ditch, many portions of which were planted as shrubberies by Lord Bolton, when go vernor of the island, and add greatly to the beauty of this interesting remain. Passing out of the castle, a pleasing walk is to be obtained by following the course of the terrace, and inspecting the south side of the fortress, a frontage certainly of less interest than that of the opposite side ; but still, from every point of view there is something grand and impressive about these substantial piles of masonry, with their half-defaced shields and le gends, that ever interests the reflective temperament of the mind, and pos sesses a charm in the estimation of even the most heedless observer. In 1859 a number of men employed in digging the foundations for some stables at the Carisbrooke vicarage made a search which led to the discovery of a Roman Villa, which appears to have been 113 feet in length by a width of 48 feet. Parkhurst Forest is a beautifully wooded demesne. It formerly extended over 3,000 acres of land, now reduced to about 1,100 acres ; it is crown property. The Isle of Wight Union Workhouse (for the whole of the island) is at Parkhurst. Area: 8,603 acres of land and 11 of water. Population (including military, convicts, and paupers) : 8,198. CARSHALTON. \u2014 (STATION.) \u2014 A large village and parish of the county of Surrey (mid division) ; in Epsom union and county court district, and Croydon petty sessional division. This place was called \" Aulton,\" in Domesday Book. The River Wandle is here fed by several copious springs which expands into a lake-like form near the church. The latter is an ancient edifice and contains brasses to Nicholas Gaynes ford, one of Edward IV.'s esquires, and his wife and eight children. Carshalton Park was originally a seat of the Carew family. There is a commodious public hall in the High Street. Area: 2,904 acres. Population : 3,668.

CATERHAM JUNCTION- STATION.)\u2014 This station is at the western end of the Caterham Valley, in the parish of Coulsdon, and county of Surrey (mid division). On the west (or Up-line) side of the station the schools of the Warehousemen and Clerks' Provident Society are a prominent feature. On the east side a short distance southwards, a dip in the hills allows the traveller to see the Asylum for Fatherless Children. This institution was founded in 1845 by Dr. Andrew Reed (father of the late Sir Charles Reed), who was also the projector of the Royal Hospital for Incurables, and whose estate adjoined that of Reedham, so called in honour of the founder. In this orphan asylum 400 fatherless children are maintained and educated. They are received at an early age, and kept until they are fourteen years old. The manage- ment of the asylum is admirable, and the liberal characterof the education, andfree dom from all sectarian influences, render it a most popular and successful institution. Average Train Service : Five each way on week days ; two each way on Sundays. Fares from London Bridge : 2/9 /, 2/- s, 1/1 t. Return Tickets (4 days), 4/9 /, 3/3 s, 2/- t. [Catekham is a village and parish of Surrey (eastern division) ; in Godstone union and petty sessional division, and Reigate county court district. The church of St. Mary, in the Early English style, is a small, plain and very old building. A new church was consecrated in 1866 ; it is in the Early English style, occupies a site opposite the old church, and consists of chancel, north and south aisles, naves, porch and tower. The Metropolitan District Asylum, for chronic insane persons and imbeciles, is situated in the upper part of the parish, adjoining Chal- don and Coulsdon, and is surrounded bya farm of 76 acres. The building is of white brick, with red brick facings, and consists of 13 blocks and a chapel, with a detached block for infectious cases, six for males"], [91, "53 and seven for females ; there is a recrea tion hall to seat 800 people, with a permanent stage. Adjoining the asylum are the barracks for the recruits of the regiments of Foot Guards ; they were finished in 1877, and correspond in style with the asylum. They hold 400 men and 4 officers, but are to be enlarged. The Caterham Spring Water Company obtain their water from wells 500 feet deep, and supply Caterham, Godstone, Bletching ley, Nutfield, Redhill, and a portion of Reigate. The district known as Cater ham Valley has sprung up round the railway station, wliich is nearly a mile distant from the village ; there are two small churches \u2014 St. John's and St. Luke's. Area (of the parish) : 2,437 acres. Population (including asylum) : 3,577. CHAMPION HILL. \u2014 (STA TION.)\u2014This station is on the South London line, and is in the parish of Dulwich (which see). C HE AM.\u2014 (STATION. )\u2014 A village and rJarish of the county of Surrey (mid division) ; in Epsom union, county court district, and petty sessional division. The church was rebuilt in 1874, and contains some fine stained glass windows. The chancel, which is the only remains of the old church, has several monuments and brasses, including that of Lord Lumley, who took part in the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots. Nonsuch Park is the site of Queen Elizabeth's famous palace of Nonsuch. It was frequently visited by Henry VIII., but seems to have been even more patronized by his daughter. It was here the Earl of Essex had his last interview with the Queen. The present mansion is a modernized building. A timber house is still called Queen Elizabeth's Council House, and connected with it are some underground vaults, which were used for illegal coining about 200 years ago. It is a singular fact that five out of the six clergymen who held the rectory of Cheam between 1581 and 1662 subsequently became bishops. The parish extends to Banstead Downs. The extensive range of buildings comprising the Middlesex County Luna tic Asylum is a conspicuous feature of the neighbourhood. Area: 1,908 acres. Population: 1,629. The Train Service to and from London is very frequent. Fares from London Bridge : 2/- /, 1/6 s , 1/1 .. Return Tickets (4 days), 2/9 /, 2/3 s, 2/- t. CHELSEA.\u2014 (STATION.) \u2014 This metropolitan station is on the West London Branch Line to, and is in the parish and parliamentary borough of the same name. The Train Service to and from Victoria and to and from Kensing ton is very frequent. CHICHESTER.-(STATION.)\u2014 An episcopal city and municipal and parliamentary borough, in the western division of the county of Sussex ; \u00bb county town and sub-port, in Chichester rape, hundreds of Box and Stockbridge, and deanery, archdeaconry, and diocese of Chichester. The city has an outlet to the English Channel by means of the river Lavant, and has a harbour two miles distant. A branch connects it w ith the Portsmouth and Arundel canal. The Saxon name was Cissaceaster, and the Roman, Regnum. The South Saxons, under Ella, took the town, and partly destroyed it, but it was rebuilt by Cissa, and became the capital of the kingdom of Sussex until the latter was conquered by the West Saxons. The ancient ram parts still remain, and have been trans formed into agreeable promenades. The seat of the bishopric was removed hither from Selsey in the reign of William I. Bishop Juxon was born here ; also Dr. Chillingwortb, Otway, Hayley, Collins, and John Shelden. Chichester formerly sent two members to Parliament, but the representation was reduced to one member by the Reform Act of 1867. The town was incorporated by James II. The corporation is the urban sanitary authority, and the city has its own court of quarter sessions and police force. Gas and water are supplied by companies. Tho town council provides for inter ments. The public recreation grounds are the city ramparts and the Priory Park, the latter belonging to the Duke of Richmond and rented by the inhabit ants. The cathedral dates from the close of the twelfth century. The spire, 272 feet high, fell in February, 1861, and has been restored at a cost of \u00a350,000. The nave was built in the time of Henry I., in the Norman style ; most parts of the church were finished before 1200. In 18G0 the restoration of the choir was commenced, in memory of Dr. Chandler, the late dean. The floor"], [92, "54 in ront of the altar consists of a most elaborate piece of mosaic, for which Poole received the gold medal at the Exhibition of 1862. The reredos consists of a deeply recessed arch, filled with sculpture, with an inlaid and carved pediment over ; it represents the Ascen sion. The Lady Chapel has been completely restored. There are some fine oak stalls, an Anglo-Saxon chest in the sacristy, and a Gothic chantry to St. Richard. There are numerous monu ments of bishops of the see. The poet Collins was a native of the city, and has a monument to his memory by Flaxman. In the Arundel Chapel is a stone tomb, with recumbent effigies of Richard Fitz alan, third Earl of Arundel, and Eleanor of Lancaster, his wife. Other buildings are \u2014 the palace and deanery, in the cloisters ; ten churches, nine chapels ; the council chamber and guildhall, formerly a chapel of the Grey Friars' monastery ; a beautiful octangular cross, built about 1500 by Bishop Storey ; it is octagonal in form, with buttresses at the angles, and open so as to form an arcade ; a massive central pillar supports a richly groined roof ; the central pillar is now surmounted by a lantern, which has been substituted probably for a cross; over the centre of each arch is a niche; each one of which was once occupied by a statue ; these, however, were all de stroyed at thetime of the Commonwealth. The clock was given by Lady Farrington in 1724 ; the steps and dais are modern ; assembly rooms and literary institution ; market house and corn exchange ; pro bate office ; bishop's registry office ; West Sussex infirmary ; St. Mary's hospital for poor persons ; Bishop Storey's grammar school ; Bishop Otter's diocesan training school and college ; museum and mechanics' institute, <_zc.

CLAPHAM. \u2014 (Two Stations \u2014 CLAPHAM and CLAPHAM ROAD.) \u2014 An extensive suburb of the south- western division of the metropolis, and in the eastern division of the county of Surrey. It forms part of the Wands- worth poor-law and county court districts, and is within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Board of Works, Metro- politan Police, and Central Criminal Court. Clapham Common is now one of the open spaces under the control of the Metropolitan Board of Works; it comprises about 200 acres of land, which formerly were little better than a swamp. The churches and chapels in the neigh bourhood are very numerous. It is hardly necessary to say that the Tram Service to,from, and through this import ant junction station, with its wonderful network of lines, is almost continuous both on week days and Sundays. Area of the district : 1,137 acres. Population : 27,437. COCKING. \u2014 A small village and parish of the county of Sussex (western division) ; in Midhurst union, county court district and petty sessional divi sion.

Cosham and neighbourhood are worthy attention. On alighting at the station, the visitor's attention is at once attracted by Ports down Hill, and he cannot do better than take a stroll to the top of it. From this hill there is a most magnificent view, not only of other hills, woods, windmills, and gentlemen's residences, but also of Portsmouth Harbour, Dockyard, <fec. The vessels lying at Spithead are also distinctly visible. The Isle of Wight must not be omitted, nor must Porches ter Castle, and the forts and gunboats at Gosport. These are only a few of the principal objects of interest which may be seen on au ordinary day from Ports- down Hill. On a very clear day, Osborne House, Isle of Wight, may be seen dis- tinctly.

COWES, ISLE OF WIGHT.\u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 The town of Cowes is, properly speaking, subdivided into the denominations of East (in Whippingham parish) and West (in Northwood parish) Cowes, the river Medina flowing between then.*, and then uniting itself with the* Solent. West Cowes being the port of the island, its harbour and roadstead are generally studded with vessels bearing the flag of almost every mari time nation ; giving it a lively appear^ ance, and effectively adding to the approach by water. The towns are pleasingly and commandingly placed on tlie rise of the hills by which the river is bounded, and the tout ensemble of the situation is one calculated at first sight to impress the visitor with a most favourable idea of its attractions ; and certainly truthfully so, as regards the charming intermixture of the beauties of nature with the handiworks of man, as well as the entire scenic display of its immediate neighbourhood. The name of Cowes is derived from the two forts built by Henry VIII., to command the entrance of the river Medina. At a most early period of our history, the passage to the opposite dbast is con jectured to have been from a place a little to the west of Cowes, called Gurnard's Bay, and Dr. Speed imagines- that a Roman way to Carisbrooke led from a site still called the Street, in its immediate vicinity. Although much importance for a long series of years has been attached to Cowes from its advan- tageous maritime position, the great im- petus to its present station among the watering-places of the kingdom, was un- doubtedly the establishment of the Royal Yacht Squadron, in 1812, since which time a most animated appearance has been imparted to it, and many improve- ments effected in accordance with th& requirements of the vast influx of com- pany during the yachting season ; whilst it must be additionally remarked that Cowes also carries on a large internal trade, and is celebrated for its ship- building yards. The part of Cowes to which the attention of visitors is prin- cipally or at least primarily directed, is that designated the Parade, whereon the Club House of the Yacht Squadron, the Castle, and several mansions of im ; posing elevation are placed. The Castle- occupies the extreme western boundary of the Parade, and, notwithstanding Leland' s vaunt of its pi-istine considera- tion, now displays but little evidence of even castellated pretensions. The Yacht Club House possesses a most central"], [94, "56 position on the site of the old Castle. It i3 an appropriate and well planned building, containing the usual require- ments of such an institution. This Club enjoys peculiar privileges from the Lords of the Admiralty, and numbers the most distinguished of the nobility and gentry, lovers of aquatic sports, in its roll of members. Tho regatta comes off in August of each year, the pro- gramme including a ball, dinner, and an extended list of matches for plates of considerable value. The churches at Cowes are properly chapels-of-ease to the parish of Northwood, which, in its turn, is, strictly speaking, a dependent to the mother church of Carisbrooke. Cowes Chapel, originally erected in 1653, a time when saintly dedications were in abeyance, was, in 1811, enlarged and repaired. The Chapel of the Holy Trinity, which owes its foundation, in 1832, to the munificence of Mrs. Godwin, a lady residing in its immediate vicinity, offers a remarkable contrast to the plain if not mean appearance of the fane already spoken of ; the characteristics of the style being well preserved, and the appointments devised with every regard to the correct estimate of a refined taste. Among the other places of wor- ship are the Catholic, Wesleyan, Primi- tive Methodist, Baptist, and the In- dependent Chapels. The baths and bathing machines, so important an item in the requirements of a watering-place, are to the west of the Parade, at a short distance beyond the Castle, and offer many inducements to both the valetu- dinarian, and mere lover of ablution in the briny element, as there is not only great depth, but also purity of water at all time3 of the tide. The walks and minor excursions in the vicinity afford almost unlimited views of the Solent and opposite coast. Debourne Walk, origin- ating in the former appellation of the manor, is that to the west, whilst the Mill Walk directs the visitor to Northwood Church, the parent of those of Cowes. It is placed on the banks of the river Medina, and although originally sub- servient to that of Carisbrooke, has, since the reign of Henry VIII., enjoyed separate parochial privileges. In an architectural or arch\u00e6ological point of view, it is a building of little import. Some curious particulars in connection with local matters, and the social con- dition of the parish in the reign of Charles II., are to be found in a manu- script journal, still extant, of a frequent visitant to the place at that time. From Cowes many aquatic excursions of much interest are to be arranged, such as to Netley Abbey, Beaulieu, &c, where the spectator may either enjoy a delightful reverie of the customs and days of old, within the precincts that heretofore resounded with the matin bell, and emitted the gleam of the midnight taper, if he be susceptible of the pleasure derivable from such associations ; or otherwise look on nature in her most attractive guise, and discovering in the gnarled arm of some giant trunk evi- dence of an existence prior even to the foundations of the structures which are now shorn of their strength, and remain but as relics of a system that is now generally looked on as one of error and superstition. EAST COWES, although disfigured by some of the defects which characterise its more im- portant neighbour, and considerably inferior in point of extent and population, has of late years assumed considerable prominence, from its proximity to the royal demesne of Osborne, and the for- mation of the adjacent series of villa residences, under the denomination of East Cowes Park, to which the known predilection of the Queen for the locality has given an impulse that no other circumstance could have supplied. From West Cowes the approach is by a well-regulated ferry, which also forms the usual means of access from the eastern parts of the island to that town, vid East Cowes, rather than by the ex tended route, vid Newport and Park hurst. The sea frontage, with the ex ception of the landing-place erected by the Trinity House for the accommodation of Her Majesty, displays little worthy attention, as it is merely composed of a series of wharfs and residences. Em bowered in the foliage, immediately to the rear of the town, is East CowesCastle, a favourable specimen of the inventive powers of its former owner and designer, the late John Nash, Esq., the celebrated architect. Since his decease it has passed through the hands of several successive proprietors. Norris Castle, one of the most striking and impressive"], [95, "57 buildings on the coast of the island, is commandingly situated at the extremity of the promontory of the east side of the Medina. Norris Castle was designed by the late Sir J. Wyatville, for Lord Henry Seymour \u2014 the model of a Nor man Castle, as correct in detail as the domestic requirements of modern society would permit, and although not suf ficiently orthodox to sustain the scrutiny of the antiquary the mere casual spec tator might reasonably infer that the wintry winds of many ages had passed over its towers and battlements. It was sold on the decease of its projector. Population (East Cowes) : 2,058. News papers : Isle of Wight Herald (c), Satur day, ld. Principal Hotels: Aris's; Medina.

CRANLEIGH.\u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 A village and parish of the county of Surrey (western division) ; in Hamble don union, Guildford and Godalming county court district, and Guildford petty sessional division. The name of this place is sometimes spelt Cran ley. The village is very pleasantly situated on the borders of a large com mon. The church is an ancient structure in the Decorated style, and was restored in 1846-7 ; adjoining the south aisle is the Baynards chantry or chapelry dedicated to the Holy Trinity, which originally had its regular officiating chaplain. Among the early presentations to this chapelry was that by King Ed ward II. to \" John at Brugge\" on 27th October, 1321. There is a sixteenth cen tury brass. The Surrey County School is an excellent middle class institution, established in 1865, which accommodates 300 pupils, and has a chapel built at the cost of Sir H. Peek, Bart., M.P., in memory of his mother. The first village hospital was established at Cranleigh. Baynards Station is in the parish. Area: 7,772 acres. Population: 1,830.

CROYDON. \u2014 (Five Stations \u2014 EAST CROYDON [Main line and principal station] ; WEST CROYDON [for Mid- Sussex route] ; CENTRAL [dis used] ; NEW CROYDON [adjoining East Croydon] ; and SOUTH CROY DON.) \u2014 A large market town, parish, and urban sanitary district of the county of Surrey (eastern division) ; in Croydon union, county court district, and petty sessional division, and the Metro- politan Police district. The East Croy- don Railway Station is jointly used by the London Brighton and South Coast and South Eastern Railway Companies. Addiscombe Road is the terminal station of the branch from Lewisham. Croydon, e"], [96, "58 although a place of great antiquity, is seldom mentioned in history. It is situ ated on the Roman road of Ermine- street. The town is about amile in length. The part no w called High-street was formerly only a bridle-road through fields. The old, or lower town, called Old Croydon, was situated further from London, towards Beddington. Croydon is the capital of East Surrey, and assizes are held here alternately with Guildford. Churches, &c. : St. John the Baptist, parish church ; St. James's, St. Peter's, Christ Church, St. Andrew's, and St. Mary's. Nonconformist Chapels : Inde pendent chapel, Friends' meeting-house, WeBleyan chapel, Baptist chapel, and Roman Catholic chapel. There are School Board and National schools in Croydon, also Freemasons' almshouses, public hall, town hall and market house, lecture hall, gas company, banks, and a literary and scientific institution. The church, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, and considered one of the finest examples of ecclesiastical architecture in the coun ty, is supposed to have been commenced by Archbishop Courtney, who became primate in 1381, and died in 1396 ; but it does not appear to have been completed until the days of Archbishop Chicheley. It is situated at the bottom of the town, near the source of the Wandle, and is built of stone and flint, in the Pointed style. It consists of a nave, three aisles, and two chancels. At the west end is a handsome square tower, rising to the height of four stories, and supported by strong buttresses, and adorned at the summit by battlements and crocketed pinnacles issuing from octagonal turrets. It contains a good peal of eight bells, with chimes which play a psalm tune every sixth hour. An old marble font, at the west end of the south aisle, is said to be of tlie time of Arch bishop Chicheley ; il is octagonal, with quatrefoil panels on its sides, ornamented with roses and grotesque heads. In the middle chancel are some ancient wooden stalls. There is an unusually rich col lection of monumental brasses and in scriptions in this church, and even on the exterior ; and in the churchyard are many interesting memorials of the dead. In the middle chancel, on a sarcophagus within an arched recess, lies the painted effigy of Archbishop Grindall, in his scarlet robes. This venerable prelate died in 1583, aged eighty-three years. In the south-east corner of St. Nicholas's chantry is a splendid monument to the memory of Archbishop Sheldon, who died in 1677, representing the recumbent effigies of this dignitary in his archiepis copal robes and mitre. The figure is of statuary marble, beautifully sculptured. On the north side of the altar,within sepa rate recessed arches, are the sculptured effigies of a man and woman kneeling before desks. This monument dates from the sixteenth century, and commemo rates a worthy citizen and grocer of \"Lon don famous cittie,\" Maister Henry Mill. In St. Nicholas's chantry are also the tombs of the Archbishops Wake, Potter, and Herring, who succeeded each other, and died, respectively, in the years 1736, 1747, and 1757. On the east wall of St. Mary's chancel is a beautiful monument of white marble to the memory of Mrs. Bowling, and representing an angel bearing up a female. The sculpture is by Flaxman. On the north wall of the same chancel is a large white tomb for the Heron family and of the sixteenth century. It is ascended by three steps, and bears the figures of a man in armour, in alto-relievo, attended by his five sons, and a woman, attended by eight daugh ters. Here, also, is Archbishop Whit gift's monument, a sarcophagus, sup ported by Corinthian columns of black marble. It represents the recumbent effigies of the prelate in sable robes, with his hands raised in the act of prayer. He died in 1604. It appeal's by the parish registers (which arc complete from the year 1538) that Alexander Barkley, or Barclay, author of \" The Ship of Fools,\" was buried in Croydon churchyard in 1552. On the restoration of the church, in 1844, some ancient paintings were discovered, some of large size, and one of them representing St. Christopher. Besides the churches named, there are in the suburbs several chapels-of-ease and chapels and meeting-housesfor several de nominations of dissenters. The Church of St. Peter at Southend will accommodate one thousand persons. Whitgift's Hos pital, thenoblest benefaction that Croydon has ever enjoyed, was founded by Arch bishop Whitgif t, inthe reign of Elizabeth, for the maintenance of a warden, school master, and twenty-eightmen and women,"], [97, "59 or as many more under forty as the revenues would admit. The building is an unpretending brick edifice, of the Elizabethan stylo of architecture, and of a quadrangular form. It has under gone a renovation, both internally and externally. Over the entrance are armorial bearings of the See of Canter bury, surmounting this inscription : \" Qui dat pauperi, non indigebit.\" The chapel of the hospital, a small apartment forming the south-east angle of the building, was consecrated in 1599, by the name of \" The Chapel of the Holy Tri nity.\" In this chapel are some inte resting remains ; amongst them is a por trait of Archbishop Whitgift, painted on a board, with an inscription in Latin above, which may be thus rendered : \" My all I did ; the all allowed by heaven : Envy, do more ; if more to thee be given.\" Below :\u2014 rsee; \"The Primate's breathing imago here you Who built thia structure to ttibSoly Three.\" Croydon is rich in charities. There are a number of almshouses endowed ; also Archbishop Tenison's School for poor boys and, girls, founded in 1714; and Ellis Davy's Almshouse \" for seven poor people, men and women,\" the creation of which charity dates from 1447. The principal town buildings consist of the Court-house, the Public Hall, and the Market. The town, generally, wears a very pleasing and substantial appear ance, and the main street is long and spacious. Some of the houses are hand some. The parish includes eight hamlets within its limits, and a con siderable part of Norwood, which was formerly a forest. The neighbourhood of Croydon (particularly the west part of it, called Duppa's Hill, adjoining to and open from the range of hills called Banstead and Epsom Downs) is much frequented by invalids from the metro polis on account of the purity of the air. Croydon is supposed to have been the ancient Novromagus. At the Conquest it was bestowed on Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, whose successors in the See have been lords of the manor ever since ; and here was an arehiepiscopal palace, where the primates usually resided from 1278 to 1757. In this palace James I. of Scotland was imprisoned. In 1573 Archbishop Parker entertained Queen Elizabeth and all her retinue here for seven days ; an expensive manifes tation of loyalty in those times. Having fallen into decay, the palace was sold in 1780, under the authority of an Act of Parliament, for \u00a32,520 The palace was then turned into an establishment for printing linens, and the garden was made a bleaching-ground ; but the demesne having been subsequently resold in lots, the buildings were converted into sepa rate dwellings. Of this ancient archi episcopal palace, only a few fragments remain : an arch is especially worth notice. The extensive drainage opera tions at Croydon have contributed much to the healthiness and prosperity of the town. Market Day: Thursday (cattle and corn). Population: 55,652 (in 1881 about 80,000).

CRYSTAL PALACE.-(STA TION.)\u2014The Crystal Palace (which, with its grounds, is principally in the parish of Norwood and county of Surrey, and partly in the chapelry of the parish of Lewisham and county of Kent), was built with the materials of the Hyde Park Great Exhibition buildings of 1851, and opened on the 10th June, 1854, by Her Majesty the Queen. The scheme and cost were undertaken by a public company, with a capital of \u00a3500,000. The budding measures 1,608 feet in length ; the wings an additional length of 574 feet each, with a railway avenue of 720 feet ; the greatest width is 384 feet, and the general width 312 feet ; the height of the great transept from the basement is 197 feet 10 inches; the area of the galleries is 261,568 square feet, and that of the whole building ia 603,072 square feet. The north wing of the palace was burnt down on the 30th December, 1866, when more than \u00a31 50,000 worth"], [98, "60 district has its own urban sani tary authority (St. Wilfred's). Cuck field parish church is a fine structure (temp. 1200-1250) ; the tower and the south side are the oldest portions. The chancel is paved with Minton's tiles, and contains some beautiful oak carvings. A magnificent reredos of alabaster and costly marbles is certain to command attention from visitors. On the walls of the south aisle are several interesting monuments and tablets to the Burrell family, and in the chancel and other parts of the church are those of the Sergi sons, of Cuckfield Park; many of tho monumental sculptures were designed and executed by Flaxman, Westmacott, and Bacon. Cuckfield Place (the seat of the Sergisons) is a fine Elizabethan mansion. It is approached from the high road by a noble avenue, terminating in an ancient gate-house, and stands on the confines of a large undulating park, well stocked with deer ; the house is well known as the \" Rookwood \" of Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, and the traditions referred to in his popular novel aro still rife in this neighbourhood.

Principal Hotel: King's Head. DENMARK HILL.\u2014(STA TION.) \u2014 This suburban station is in the parish of Camberwell, parliamentary borough of Lambeth, and county of Sur rey (eastern division). Camberwell manor is mentioned in Domesday Book, and was given by Henry I. to his son Robert. The Area of the parish is 4,450 acres. Popu lation : 111,306. The Train Service is very frequent, and the Fares from either of the London terminii small. of damage was done, but has been restored. There are two towers, each rising to the height of 284 feet, and sur mounted by a tank holding 357,675 gal lons, or 1,576 tons of water, for sup plying the highest jets of the great fountains. Each tower contains 800 tons of iron ; the w eight of the fountain water piping is 4,000 tons, and its length ten mile B ; there are in all the fountains 11,788 jets, throwing 120,000 gallons of water in a minute. The Palace has Fine Arts Courts representing the archi tecture, sculpture and decorative arts of Egypt, Greece, Rome, Byzantium, as well as of the Medi\u00e6val, Renaissance, and early as well as late Italian. A great marine aquarium has been erected at the north end. There are, besides, in dustrial courts, picture gallery, fountains, flowers, and tropical plants and trees. The park is laid out in a style of rich natural beauty, contrasting admirably with the more artificial charms of the terrace gardens : they together occupy about 200 acres. Entertainments are given in the Palace almost daily through out the year, such as operas, grand, popular and classical concerts, magnifi cent displays of fireworks, displays of the terrace and great fountains, flower shows, natural history shows, and grand musical festivals of the highest class. In addi tion there are occasionally public recep tions or ceremonial visits of foreign Sovereigns, and many great class cele brations of national significance. On days when no special attractions are pro vided, the orchestral band of the Com pany usually performs. There are Schools of Art in connection with the Palace, which attract large numbers of students, both male and female.

' ' DEPTFORD.\u2014 (Three Stations\u2014 DEPTFORD ROAD, DEPTFORD WHARF, and DEPTFORD DOCK YARD.) \u2014 A suburb of the metropolis, in the county of Kent (western division) ; it is in Greenwich union, county court district, and parliamentary borough, the stations of the London Brighton and South Coast system being on what is known as the East London Line, which connects with the Great Eastern Railway at Liverpool Street, City. Deptford is within the jurisdiction CUCKFIELD \u2014 (Station \u2014 HAY WARD'S HEATH \u2014 2 miles.)\u2014 A market town, urban sanitary district and parish of the county of Sussex (eastern division) ; in the union, county court district and petty sessional divi sion of the same name. The Ouse Valley Viaduct is in this parish ; there are 37 arches, the highest being 90 feet in height, Hayward's Heath"], [99, "61 of the Metropolitan Police, Board of Works (in parts), and the Central Cri minal Court. The principal feature of the- place is the Dockyard, first esta blished by Henry VIII.. Here, in 1581, Queen Elizabeth visited Drake's ship, the \" Golden Hind \" ; and after dining on board, the honour of knighthood was conferred upon the famous mariner. The Naval Arsenal includes victualling office, dockyards and large workshops ; the premises altogether comprising an area of 31 acres. The town is irregu larly built. The chief buildings are the parish church of St. Paul, a well-en dowed charity school, two ancient hos pitals for decayed pilots and shipmasters, or their widows, one of which comprises 56 houses within the walls, belonging to the Trinity House. The dockyard, and private yards for ship-building, mostly employ the inhabitants. The old bridge was taken down in 1859, and replaced by a substantial cast-iron one. A bap tist chapel and schools were recently erected at the junction of the old and new roads, near the toll gate. By the munificent gift of \u00a310,000 by the Baroness Burdett-Coutts, a church was erected in 1855, on the Lewisham Road in this parish, with parsonage house, grounds, and schools for 200 boys, 170 girls, and 200 infants. The workhouse at Deptford occupies the site of Saye's Court, the residence of Evelyn, the author of the celebrated \"Diary,\" \"Sylva,\" and numerous other works. This talented and amiable man was well skilled in painting, engraving, and archi tecture. His gardens were considered the wonder of the age \u2014 he being as skilful in gardening as in the more ele gant accomplishments. The Train Ser vice is very frequent, and the Fares to and from New Cross and Liverpool Street, small. tained for a railway to the Dyke, where there is a good hotel named after the place. DORKING .\u2014(STATION.)\u2014 A market town and parish of the county of Surrey (western division) ; in Dorking union, county court district, and petty sessional division. Dorking is charm ingly situated in a sandy valley on the south part of the river Mole, and con sists of a wide and hantlsome principal street, with two others branching out at its southern end ; the whole town being very clean, well paved, and lighted with gas. The station of the South Coast Rail way is close to the Box Hill station of the South Eastern Radway. St. Martin's church is a handsome structure of the Decorated style, partly rebuilt in 1837, and almost wholly so in 1873-6 at a cost of \u00a326,000 ; it contains the mausoleum of the Dukes of Norfolk, lords of the manor. In the churchyard is buried, Hoole, the well-known translator of Tasso and Ariosto. There are also dis trict churches at Holmwood Common and Westcott, near Bury Hdl. There are places of worship, also, for Wesleyan Methodists, Independents, Society of Friends, and Roman Catholics, with national and infant schools. Dorking has a PubHc Had, circulating libraries, and reading-rooms; and near the \" Glory,\" a public park-like resort, is a Cottage Hospital. The town is cele brated for its breed of fowls, and has a pretty extensive trade in corn, flour, and lime obtained from the neighbouring chalk hdls. In these chalk-pits, which are situated about half a mile from the town, on the north side, are several large kilns. The lime produced here is much valued, on account of its property of hardening under water ; and it is said to have been first extensively used in the metropolis, in buildingthe London Docks and the Sessions House and County Gaol in Horsemonger-lane. The large cedars or caves beneath the town, dug out of the solid rock, are highly curious. It is said that, more than one hundred years since, a man was foolish enough to ex pend ad his property in making the largest of these excavations, at the bot tom of which there is now a spring of pure water. The environs are adorned with some handsome country seats ; among which we may notice Shrub Hid ; DEVIL'S DYKE. \u2014(Stations \u2014 BRIGHTON or HASSOCK'S GATE \u2014 6 miles.) \u2014 This place is a very attrac tive valley or chasm of the South Downs range, in the parish of Poynings, and county of Sussex (eastern division).

The place is famous for its College, constituted under the title of \" Alleyn's College of God's Gift at Dul- wich.\" The founder was Edward Alloyn, a comedian, who enjoyed the friendship of the idustrious Shakspere, and en- dowed the college with the revenues of the manor of Dulwich and house pro- perty in London.

Tho revenues of the codege at the present time are about \u00a320,000 per annum. The codege was rebudt in 1869-70, and on the 21st of June, 1871, it was opened by the Prince of Wales. The buddings are in the the Rookery, the birthplace of Malthus ; Deepdene, a fine Italian vida, surrounded by beautdul grounds, which its owner. H. T. Hope, Esq., M.P., greatly extended by throwing into them the estates of Betchworth and Chart parks. Near the Deepdene, on a sloping piece of ground, stands the church of St. Paul, consecrated in July, 1857 ; it is built of Bath stone and flint, in the early Decorated or Geometrical style. The east and west windows are fitted with painted glass. The walls of the interior are ornamented with ecclesiastical devices, in stamped stucco. The church and parsonage ad- joining \u2014 handsome buildings \u2014 were erected at the sole expense of John Labouchere, Esq., of Broome Hall, who also liberady endowed the church. The site was given by Henry Thomas Hope, Esq. In the neighbourhood, also, is Denbies (referred to under the heading of Box Hill Station), on an elevation about two miles north-west; the mansion was built, in 1734, by Jonathan Tyers, the originator of Vauxhad ; this estate now belongs to the Right Hon. George Cubitt, M.P.,son of the late Thomas Cubitt, Esq., the celebrated engineer. The beautiful church on Ranmore Com- mon is dedicated to St. Barnabas : the spire is 150 feet high. The whole cost was defrayed by Mr. George Cubitt. About three miles south is Wotton, long the abode of John Evelyn, author of the \"Sylva\"; and about a mde beyond is Leith Hdl, 993 feet high, the most elevated spot in Surrey, commanding a view of London northward, and of the British Channel to the south. Westcott, or Westgate-street, is a hamlet in the parish of Dorking, lying one mde and a half west of the town on the Guddford- road, and, together with the hamlet of Hilton, has been assigned as a new eccle- siastical district. The church of the Holy Trinity is a beautiful edifice, designed by Scott, standing on a piece of waste land, commonly known as Westcott Heath. Wdliam John Evelyn, Esq., is lord of the manor. Coldharbour is a hamlet and ecclesiastical district partly in the parish of Dorking, three miles and a half from the town. Hoimwood is a borough tithing of Dorking, and ecclesiastical district, partly in Dorking and partly in Capel parish, two miles south of the town, and including Hoimwood Common ."], [101, "63 Northern Itadan style of the 13th cen tury : they consist of three groups, connected by covered cloisters, and com prise a great had, library, lecture theatre, laboratories, aud class rooms for about 600 boys, together with kitchens and offices, and two official residences. The chapel of the codege still remains on the old site. The lower school is established for the benefit exclusively of the chd dren of residents in the parishes which elect governors ; day boys must be above eight years of age, and able to read aud write at the time of admission ; no boy can remain at the school after the age of 16 ; the subjects taught are, with the exception of Greek, the same as in the Upper School ; but the instruc tion in these subjects is more elementary in character, and is intended to \" bear ospeciady on their application to the industrial arts.\" Foundation scholars are elected by the governors, after an examination, and must be between the ages of eight and twelve years at the time of election, and poor orphans, having lost one or both parents, or, in default of such orphans, then the chd dren of parents resident in the privileged parishes. Apprentice gifts and scholar ships are also awarded at the annual examination to deserving scholars. In the Upper School instruction is given, under the requirements of the Act of Parliament, in English, French, Greek, and Latin, in arithmetic and mathe matics, in drawing and practical geome try, writing and vocal music. Boys are admitted between the ages of eight and fifteen, and may remain till the age of eighteen years : in the admission of day boys a preference is reserved for the sous of residents in the parishes re ferred to. Exhibitions are granted to deserving scholars proceeding to one of the English universities, or becoming bond fide students of some learned or scientific profession, or of the fine arts, with a view to the professional practice thereof. In the eleemosynary branch the resident recipients of the charity consist of 12 men and 12 women, the former called \"brethren,\" and the latter \" sisters,\" of Dulwich Codege, selected from among respectable persons, either married or single, who have faden from better circumstances into indigence, and must be residents in one or other of the parishes referred to, and of the age of 60 years or upwards. They are elected by the governors, in each case, from a list of three candidates nominated by the vestry of the parish to which the existing vacancy appertains, provided with residences in the codege, and a weekly stipend of \u00a31. There are also 12 \"out- pensioners\" receiving 10s. a week each. In the appointment of alms-people from the parish of Camber well (as wed as iu the admission of boys to either school), a preference is given to residents in the hamlet of Dulwich. The picture gallery of the college enjoys a very high reputation, and contains some fine specimens of the old masters. It was bequeathed to the college by the late Sir Francis Bourgeois, in 1811, with \u00a311,000 to build a gadery for its recep tion, and to provide for the proper care of the pictures. Tbe public are admitted gratuitously daily from 10 to 5 in sum mer, and from 10 to 4 in winter. The Dulwich Girls' School, founded by James Allen, one of the masters of the college (1741), is, by the powers of the same Act of Parliament as that relating to the college, under the management of the chairman of tbe governors, the master and the chaplain. Its income is about \u00a3200 per annum. The quad fication for admission is residence in Dulwich or the vicinity. There are some handsome churches in the neigh bourhood. Area : 1,450 acres.

EARLSWOOD.-(STATION)\u2014 Earlswood is a hamlet in the parish of Reigate Foreign, and borough of Reigate (see Red Hill), and county of Surrey (mid division.) Here is the far-famed and magnificent Asylum for Idiots, and the Philanthropic Society's farm school for the reformation of ju- vende offenders. This latter institution was founded as far back as 1788, the society then having premises in the London Road, St. George's Fields, from which they removed in 1849. Criminal boys are here employed, reclaimed, and sent abroad. The Earlswood estate, formerly the property of Mr. Justice Talfourd, now belongs to the Asylum,"], [102, "64 which was founded in 1847. This noble building was erected at a cost of \u00a330,000 (extensive additions have since been made), and tlie institution has now sprung, by the favour of the benevolent British public, into one of our greatest national asylums. It had its origin in the suggestion of that true philanthro pist, the late Dr. Andrew Reed (father of the late Sir Chas. Reed, M.P.), the founder of no fewer than six charitable institutions, to all of which he was tho gratuitous honorary secretary. Dr. Reed travelled abroad with this object in view ; and after seeing the state of cretinism in France, Germany, and Switzerland, he went to Sweden and Denmark, and at length set on foot the first asylum in England for this afflicted portion of the human family. The de sign of this asylum is not merely to take care of the idiot, but, by the skilful and earnest application of tho best means, to prepare him, as far as possible, for the duties and enjoyments of life. Her Majesty has contributed largely to the funds, and the late Prince Consort laid the foundation and opened this building. The erection forms one of the most attractive objects upon this railway (it is close to the Down line). As Earlswood is only three-quarters of a mile from Red Hill junction, visitors have a frequent train service to the neighbourhood.

EASTBOURNE.\u2014 (TERMINAL STATION.) \u2014 A large parish, urban sani tary district, and fashionable watering place (giving name to a hundred and union, of the county of Sussex (eastern division) ; it is iu the rape of Pevensey, Lewes county court district, and Hails- ham petty sessional division \u2014 35 mdes from Lewes, 18i from Hastings, 23i from Brighton, at the extremity of the eastern side of the South Downs, adjoin ing the sea, and about 3 miles east from the promontory of Beachy Head (see under that head). It is probable that in ancient days it was a Roman station, as early in the last century, a tesselated pavement, bath, and other Roman anti- quities were discovered in a field be tween the Marine and Grand Parades : further discoveries of a tesselated pave ment were made in the early part of the year 1878 in the same field. Roman coins of Vespasian, Domitian, Antoninus Pius, Constantine, and Gordian, have been found, also several Cufic or Sara cenic and ancient British coins. On the west of the field in which the bath was found, the foundations of a Roman villa were discovered a few years ago. The earliest certain reference to Eastbourne is to be met with in the Domesday Book. The hundred of Borne is there stated to have been previously held by King Edward the Confessor ; to have afforded one night's entertainment to the sove reign, and to have been valued at 46 hides Wdliam I. granted it to the Earl of Morton, by whom the annual value was augmented from 30 to 40 pounds. The town is situated on the eastern side of the southern extremity of the South Downs. It is therefore sheltered from the south-west winds, but is somewhat exposed to those of the south-east, al though in this respect is no worse off than other places in the south-east of England. Eastbourne formerly con sisted of four distinct aggregations of houses, but building operations have now obliterated the division. Eccle siastically, the parish has five sub-divi sions. Eastbourne now consists of a largo new town, lying between the station and the sea front, and a small but picturesque old town IJ miles inland, where also is situate the mother church of the parish (St. Mary's). The long carriage drive along the cliff, and the parade below, are the two principal watering-place features. All the principal streets are at right angles to the sea. There are four district churches, besides Catholic and Nonconformist chapels. St. Saviour's has a handsome spire, but the architec ture generally of the place is not im posing. There is a pier 1,000 feet long. The Carlisle Road baths are very exten sive and admirably arranged buddings. The pavilion has spacious concert and floral halls, with reading-rooms, and other conveniences. The pureness of the South Down and sea air, and the excel lence of the bathing, are the main causes that have led to the progress of the town. There is a very elaborate system of"], [103, "65 sewerage. The water supplied to the town is good in quality and abundant in quantity. The Duke of Devonshire is the largest land-owner in the parish of Eastbourne. Fair : October 11 (cattle). Area : 5,512 acres. Population: 10,361. Newspapers : Eastbourne Chronicle (i.), Saturday, ld.

EMSWORTH.\u2014 (STATION.) \u2014 A small town, ecclesiastical district, port, and bathing-place forming part of the parish of Wartlington, in the county of Hants (southern division). It is two miles from Havant, and ten from Ports- mouth, and overlooks the great inlet of the sea which separates Thorney and Hayling Islands from the mainland. Fishing, and rope and sail manufac- tories, provide the principal trade of the place, which attracts a not incon- siderable number of visitors during the bathing season. The church was erected in 1840. There is a public hall, capable of holding 300 persons. Area of ham- let : 610 acres.

EPSOM.\u2014 (Two Stations\u2014 EPSOM TOWN and EPSOM DOWNS.) \u2014 A market town, urban sanitary district and parish of the county of Surrey (west ern division) ; in Epsom union, county court district, and petty sessional divi sion. The place was anciently caded Ebbesham, after a Northumbrian prin cess. The wed-known Epsom salts used to be extracted from medicinal springs situated about one mile west of the town ; I in the time of Charles I. these salts sold at 5s. the ounce ; they are not now in such repute as formerly. Murray's ex- cellent Hand-book thus describes Ep- som : \u2014 \" The town of Epsom, scattered and irregular, is very pleasantly situated at the foot of chalk downs, and is sur- rounded by plantations and fine old trees of numerous parks and villas. The town itself lies low, but the views from all the higher ground are very extensive and varied. A great number of modern vidas have been built here, but the weds are no longer in repute, and Epsom is only bustling at the time of the races, when the assemblage of strangers is enor- mous. Epsom was the Brighton of the reign of Charles II., who repaired here frequently, with his profligate court, for the sake of the mineral waters, first made known by Lord North, in his ' Forest of Varieties,' together with the chalybeate springs at Tunbridge Wells. The Epsom waters are strongly impregnated with sulphate of magnesia, and have all the quadties of the well-known ' Epsom salts,' none of which, however, are now made here. Lord North's book was published in 1645, but it was not until after the Restoration that the place be- came much frequented. ' Rode through Epsom,' says Mr. Pepys, ' the whole town, overseeing the various companies that were there walking, which is very pleasant, seeing how they are there without knowing what to do, but only in the morning to drink the waters. But, Lord ! to see how many I met there of citizens that I could not have thought to have seen there, that they had ever had it in their heads or purse to go down there.' \u2014 Diary, 241. At this time Shadwed wrote his comedy of ' Epsom Wells,' which was frequently acted at 'the Duke's Theatre.' Epsom was at the height of its reputation, and the favourite resort of both courtiers and ambitious citizens, when Dr. Toland described it in 1711. ' The nearness of London does afford it all the exotic pre- paratives and allurements to luxury whenever any is disposed to make a sumptuous banquet or to give a genteel codation. You would think yourself in some enchanted camp, to see the peasants ride to every house with the choicest fruits, herbs, roots, and flowers ; with all sorts of tame and wild fowl, with the"], [104, "66 and not less than 100,000 persons gene rally witness the ' running for the Derby.' Races have been held here from a very early period, the tradition being that they were commenced by James I., during his occasional resi dences at Nonsuch. Horse-races formed part of the amusements during ad the time that Epsom wells were in fashion, and have been continued annually since 1730 ; but it was not until after the establishment of the Oaks (1779) and Derby (1780) stakes that the races be came of any great importance. The racecourse on the downs, about one mile and a half south of the town, should be visiteel if only for its noble view. From the Grand Stand St. Paul's and West minster Abbey are distinctly visible. In the market-place is a very handsome ami original clock-tower, built of variegated brick with red stripes. Epsom Church was almost entirely rebudt iri 1824. It is quite uninteresting in itself, but con tains four smad monuments by Flaxniau, and one by Chantry. At a short dis tance from the church is Pitt Place, remarkable as the scene of the sudden death of Lord Lyttelton, with which thc wed-known ghost story is connected. The dream, in which a 'white lady' appeared to him , and said, ' Prepare to die ; you will not exist three days,' took place at his house in Hill Street, Berke ley Square. On the afternoon of the third day he removed to Pitt Place, and tlied at night during a fit of epdepsy, with which he had been frequently at tacked during the preceding month \u2014 a sufficient explanation of the ghost. In the conservatory at Pitt Place is an enormous myrtle, the trunk of which is two feet in girth. The walks over the downs from Epsom may be extended at pleasure towards Banstead aud Sutton eastward. From almost every point the views are wide and beautiful, and tho short green turf makes a most agreeable carpet.\" At the north-east corner of the downs, pleasantly situated, aud com manding fine prospects, is the Royal Medical Benevolent Codege, a handsome pde of buddings in the Tudor style of red brick and Caen stone. It consists of a school and asylum ; the latter is intended for decayed medical practitioners and their widows, and the former as a public school for gentlemen's rarest fish and venison, and with every kind of butcher's meat, among which Bansteael Down mutton is the most relishing dainty. Thus, to see the fresh and artless damsels of the plain, either accompany'd by their amorous swains or aged parents, striking their bargains with the nice court and city ladies, who, like queens in a tragedy, display all their finery on benches before their doors (where they hourly censure and are cen sured), and to observe how the hand somest of each degree equally admire. envy, and cozen one another, is to me one of the chief amusements of the place. The ladies who are too lazy or too stately, but especially those who sit up late at play, have their provisions brought to their bedside, where they conclude the bargain ; and then (perhaps after a dish of chocolate) take t'other nap till what they have thus bought is got ready for dinner.' \u2014 Descr. of Epsom, J 711. At this time Prince George of Denmark was a frequent visitor at Epsom, and Toland asserts that he had frequently counted ' sixty coaches in the ring' (the present racccourse on the downs) of a Sunday evening. Many new houses and inns had been built, aud one of the latter, the ' New Inn,' was re gardeel as the largest in England. Epsom, however, rapidly passed out of fashion after the death of Queen Anne, and, in spite of more than one attempt to restore its reputation as a watering-place, the wells have long been neglected and dis used, owing to the great ease with which the artificial ' Epsom salts' are produced. The site of the wells is about half a mde from the village, right of the Brighton road. Their ancient virtue is stdl pre served, and may be tested by the curious. The present glory of Epsom is the Races, which take place on the Downs above the village annuady in spring and summer. The summer races continue four days, the principal stakes run for being the ' Oaks ** and the ' Derby,' the ' blue ribbon of the turf.' On the ' Derby day' at Epsom the whole 14 miles of high road between it anti London, as well as the downs themselves, present such a scene as is to be witnessed in no other country, and in England itself at no other time. On the race ground is congregated every kind of vehicle that can possibly be imagined ;"], [105, "67 sons, those of medical men being edu- cated at a lower rate than the others ; fifty of the pupils are foundation scholars, being orphans of medical men, who are clothed, boarded, and educated gratis; besides these, there are at present about 170 pupils. There is a chapel connected with the college. The grounds occupy a space of 18 acres. Market Day : Wed- nesday. Fair: July 25. Area: 4,424 acres (of which 944 are downs). Popula- tion, : 6,276.

ERIDGE.\u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 A viUage aud ecclesiastical district forming part of the parishes of Frant and Rotherfield, in the county of Sussex (eastern divi- sion). It is two and a half miles from Tunbridge Wells, and is in Tieehurst union, Tunbridge Weds county court district, and Frant petty sessional divi- sion. The church was budt in 1842. The noble demesne of the Marquis of Aber- gavenny, Eridge Castle (once one of the principal seats of the far-famed Neville family), is an irregular but splendid castellated Gothic pile, the front of which is almost covered with ivy and other creeping plants. It stands in a wed- wooded and watered park, abundantly stocked with deer, and comprising about 3,000 acres of land, being also sur- rounded by about 10,000 more, all in- cluded within the estate. The park plantations have been arranged with consummate taste, and nurtured with such care that many of the tree3 have attained an enormous growth ; and within the park is a variety of rides (said to measure altogether fifty-four mdes), which conduct to scenes of various characters, and occasionally embrace the most inteiesting objects in the adjacent country. In a part of the park, near Frant, on a lofty knod, 659 feet above the level of the sea, are the remains of an ancient circular encampment, said to be Saxon. The hill is therefore called \"Saxonbury Hid.\" In 1828, a round tower was erected in nearly the centre of the entrenchments. The neighbour hood abounds with mansions and genteel villa residences, among the prettiest of which is Saxonbury Lodge, the grounds of which are laid out with great taste, and command tine views of Eridge Park and the surrounding country. At a short distance from Eridge is Bayham Abbey, a seat of the Marquis Camden, originally built about the year 1200 for Premonstratensian Monks, or White Canons, and dissolved at the Reforma- tion, when its revenues were applied by Wolsey to the erection of colleges at Ipswich and Oxford ; it was afterwards forfeited to the Crown, and granted by Elizabeth to Viscount Montague, whose descendants sold it to Lord Clues Justice Pratt, grand-uncle of the present mar- quis.

Chichester is about four miles distant. The park is open to the public at all times, but the house is only shown during the absence of the family, and on week days. It consists of one principal front with two receding wings, each 166 feet long, the ground plan of the whole being somewhat that of four sides of a hex agon. At the angles are circular towers surmounted by domes. Designed origi nally by Sir W. Chambers, and added to by Wyutt, it cannot be said that the house has any architectural merits, but it should be visited for the sake of its pic tures. These are numerous, and some of the portraits are particularly inte resting. There are, moreover, a variety of antiquariau and other relics. The grounds which surround the house are pleasingly diversified. Oak timber of the finest growth, and the wide-spread ing beech, whose limbs touch the ground, adorn the extensive domain, whilst cedars of Lebanon of remarkable size, Vdginian tulip trees, cork trees, and other exotics, give rich variety to the and Portsmouth branch of the South Western Railway, and by its advan tageous situation on the river Wey, has water communication with Guildford, Arundel, Chichester, and London. The town is of Saxon origin, and was originady called \" Godhelm's lug,\" meaning the meadow of Godhelm, a Saxon thane. Some have derived the Dame from Goda, a Saxon lady, who founded a redgious house here and was renowned for her charity \u2014 hence \"Goda's alms,\" or \"God-aiming.\" The manor was formerly the property of the episcopal see of Salisbury. Queen Elizabeth first incorporated Godalming in the year 1575, under the style of \"the warden and inhabitants\" ; the warden to be chosen on Michaelmas day, out of eight assistants. The boroughfinady cameunder the provisions of the Municipal Reform Act. A com mission of the peace, separate from the county, was granted in 1879, and the borough has its own police force. Edward III., in the 20th year of his reign, exempted the town by charter from several tolls. The urban sanitary"], [108, "70 foliage. The park is nearly six miles incircumference,and is partly surrounded by a flint wall. The racecourse is on the Downs adjoining, and annually, in the month of July, thousands of people, from the highest to the humblest of the community, are attracted to the Good wood meeting. The manor is supposed to derive its name from Godinwood, who, according to Domesday Book, was a free man in possession of the estate in the time of Edward the Confessor. Box grove Priory was founded by Robert de Haia, in the reign of Henry I. The chancel and aisles of the conventional buildings are now used as the parish church. It contains a number of monu ments. The Goodwood estate includes the ruins of Halnaker House, which stand on a commanding eminence in Halnaker Park, containing some Spanish chestnut trees of great size and beauty ; the original structure is supposed to have been built by Robert de Haia, who had married a lady of the royal blood, to whom the manor was given by Henryl. Boxgrove parish has an Area of 3,676 acres, more than half of which is down or pasture land. The Population in 1871 was 728. broom. The funeral of the miller drew a large concourse of people together from various parts of the country. His corpse was carried from his house by persons dressed in white (according to his desire), and a young woman read a burial service which he had himself composed. Area: 1,900 acres.

On High Down Hill, one mde north of the village, is the \" Mider's Tomb,\" the burial place of John Odiver, a miller who died in 1793, aged 84. This eccen tric man was buried here under an altar tomb prepared by himself, and decorated with texts of scripture and verses of his own composing. Odiver amused himsed in the construction of curious machinery, which he exhibited on the top of his house; it represented a mdl and a miller, and was so constructed that every time the shafts were moved by the wind, a sack opened and a shovel appeared in the act of raising the flour for the pur pose of fiding it. The other figures represented a custom-house officer with an upraised sword, pursuing a smuggler, and an old woman at the heels of the officer violently belabouring him with a"], [109, "71 second Thursdays for cattle.

The Duke of Orleans, who was taken prisoner by Sir Richard Waller, at the battle of Agincourt, was located here for many years ; in the li brary is some fine carved oak panelling bearing the arms of Sir R. Waller, which dates back from the reign of Henry V. Speldhurst, the principal mother parish, does not call for particular remark ; the church was rebuilt in 1871, and is a neat edifice. Evidences of iron having been the staple manufacture of the district are afforded by iron tombstones, which may be seen in this and other churchyards in this locality.

It is also a station on the Ports mouth branch of the South Western Railway and the Reading branch of the South Eastern Railway, and has water communication, by means of the river Wey, with London, Godalming, <fec. Guildford was a royal Saxon \" ville,\" with a palace belonging to the king. It stood by a ford over tho river, whose waters were remarkably clear, which caused it to be called Gegldford, or the Golden Ford. Alfred the Great be cpieathed it, by wdl, to his nephew Ethelred. Henry II. budt a palace here, and the town was the occasional abode of royalty through several succes sive reigns. Two monastic institutions were also founded in the vicinity during the reign of Henry III. The borough returned two members to Parliament from the twenty-third of Edward I. until 1867, when the representation was reduced, and in 1874 it was made the seat of a suffragan bishopric to Win chester. Guildford is a very ancient prescriptive borough, and was considered such in its first known charter, that of Henry III., a.p. 1256.

HANTS (County of). \u2014 The more correct designation of this county, though but little used, is Southampton shire. Its most contracted title is that of Hants. It is a maritime county, bounded on the north by Berkshire, east ber of bailiffs, wliich seldom, however, exceeded twenty, by the style and title of \"the mayor and approved men of Guddford,\" who held a court every three weeks, and had the power of trying capital causes. Afterwards the title was changed to that of \"the mayor and burgesses,\" and so continued untd the Municipal Act. Tho corporation have adopted the Public Health Acts. The waterworks were transferred to them a few years since. In the reign of George II. an Act was obtained for lighting the town, the power being vested in the cor poration, but the gasworks were erected by a proprietary company in the year 1824. A cemetery is in existence for ad the parishes except that of Stoke. Guddford contains twenty three churches, some of them in teresting specimens of antique archi tecture ; nine dissenting and Roman Catholic chapels ; a grammar school, founded by Edward VI., which enjoys a high reputation as a classical seminary ; Archbishop Abbot's school, with twelve trustees for its management ; and several national, British, parochial, and other schools ; the county assize courts, a town hall, police station, corn market, county court office, theatre, dispensary ,the Guild ford institute, the mechanics' institute, the working men's institution, Abbot's hospital, Stoke hospital, &c. The Royal Surrey county hospital, costing \u00a315,000, was opened in 1868. In speaking of public buildings, the first place is, how ever, due to the ancient Castle, apparently of Norman origin ; and although its quadrangular keep is nearly ad that now remains, standing boldly on the brow of the hill facing the west, and constructed chiefly of ragstone, flint, and chalk, there are traces of foundations that prove the original building to have covered altogether more than four acres of ground. The tower, together with the gateway, consists of three stories ; but ad the floors, together with the roof itself, have long been destroyed, and there is no access to the upper part except by steps or ladder. There are some crypts, also, once forming a part of the castle, that are well worth an examination. The trade of the town and district is chiefly confined to agri culture. Market Days: Saturdays (corn) and Tuesdays (stock). Fairs: May 4 and"], [111, "73 by Surrey and Sussex, south by the EngUsh Channel, and west by Dorset shire and Wiltshire. Length, CO miles ; breadth. 42 miles ; circumference, 225 miles ; square miles, j ,672. The Isle of Wight, which is included in the county, is 22 mdes long by 13 broad, with a cir cumference of 56 miles. The principal rivers are the Itchen, Anton, Hamble, Avon, Stour, Exe, and Test. There are also the Andover and Basingstoke canals, and nearly 3,800 miles of roads. The railways belong chiefly to the South Western system. A trunk line from London enters the county on the north east at Farnborough, passing by Basing stoke and Winchester to Southampton. The South Coast line extends out of Sussex to Portsmouth. A branch of the South Western line extends from Gosport to Salisbury, crossing the main line at Bishopstoke. The Southampton and Dorchester line throws oft' branches to Lymington, Christchurch and Bourne mouth. There is also a line from Redbridge to Andover, and from Basing stoke to Salisbury. Ono from Ash and Farnham to Winchester passes by Alton, and there is another from Southampton to Netley, and from Bishop's Waltham to Petersfield. Porchester is intersected by a line from Havant to Fareham. The direct Portsmouth railway from London runs by Petersfield aud Havant. A branch from Reading to Basingstoke connects the Great Western system with the South Western. The South Eastern line from Guiklford, via Ash, to Reaoling, passes Farnborough and Blackwater. In the Isle of Wight there is a line from West Cowes to Sandown, and another from Ryde to Ventnor. The county has a great variety of soils, but the prin cipal part is chalk ; the Dorsetshire border has large tracts of heath, and towards the sea are great quantities of ri-arsh land, but very fertile ; all the re mainder is excedent land. It is one of the most fertde and populous counties in England. On the downs, of which a ridge runs almost across the country, are fed extensive flocks of sheep. Be sides wheat, barley, and hops, it is famous for bacon, honey, and timber, the last iu particular, on account of its great woods, of which the principal are the New Forest, and the Forest of Bere. In the chalk district, Walbury Beacon is 1,011 feet high (the highest chalk in England), Sidon Hid is 942 feet high, Butser Hill 917 feet, Beacon Hill 900 f e\u00b0et^ and Portsdown Hid 444 feet. In tb. Isle of Wight the downs range from 400 to 000 feet high, rising to 845 feet at St. Catherine's Hid, and are accompanied with ironsand, wealden clay, etc. The scenery of the interior of the island, and of Underdid at its back, is proverbial for its beauty. Hampshire returns four members to Parliament, two for each division, north and south, and the Isle of Wight also returns one member. It is in the western circuit, the assizes being held at Winchester, and it com prises an archdeaconry in the diocese of Winchester, province of Canterbury. The borough representation comprises Portsmouth, Southampton, and Win chester (city), two members each; Andover, Christchurch, Lymington, Newport (I. of W.),and Petersfield, one member each. The shire has 38 hun dreds, 10 liberties, 351 civil parishes, besides parts of others, 24 poor-law unions, 1 poor-law union under a Local Act, 1 poor-law parish, 26 regis try districts, 9 municipal boroughs [An dover, Basingstoke, Lymington, New port (I. of W.), Portsmouth, Romsey, Ryde (I. of W.), Southampton (county of itself), and Winchester (city)], 22 urban sanitary authorities, 22 rural sanitary authorities, and 20 turnpike trusts. It also has one court of quarter sessions, and is divided into 14 petty sessional divisions, and 17 lieutenancy sub divisions. The boroughs of Andover, Portsmouth, Southampton, and Win chester (city), have commissions of the peace and separate courts of quarter sessions ; the boroughs of Basingstoke, Newport (I. of W.), Romsey, and Ryde (I. of W.), have commissions of the peace only. The boroughs of Basing stoke, Newport (I. of W.), Portsmouth, Ryde (I. of W.), Southampton, and Winchester (city), have their own police. Christchurch is a corporate borough, not subject to the Municipal Corporations Acts. In the extreme north Hampshire consists of the lower eocene strata (Lon don clay, <fec.) An extensive tract in the north and centre exhibits chalk and its associated marls. The London clay beds reappear in a kind of belt crossing the county from Havant towards Salisbury. 7"], [112, "74 The neighbourhood of Southampton dis plays the Barton and Bagshot series, which also extend round by the New Forest to Christchurch. The Isle of Wight has the upper eocene beds (fluvio marine) in the north, chalk in the cen tral parts, and the greensands and wealden clay in the south. The geology of this island is peculiarly interesting. Hampshire was a seat of the Belg\u00e6, and was part of Britannia Prima, and of Wessex. The Britons styled it Gwent, i.e. full of downs. In the ninth and tenth centuries the Danes wasted Hamp shire ; and in the Parliamentary war several battles aud sieges took place here. There are many Roman, monas tic, and castellated antiquities (some of which are in good preservation), as Netley and Beaulieu Abbey, and Por chester, Carisbrooke and other castles. The manufactures are of little import ance, except such as are connected with the ship-building yards at Portsmouth and Northam. Overton has silk mills ; and in a few other places, Unseys, drug gets, bombazines, <fec., are made. The making of bank-note paper is carried on at Freefolk, and of watch chains at Christchurch.

HASTINGS.-.TERMINAL STA TION.) \u2014 Aparliamentary(returningtwo members) and municipal borough of East Sussex ; one of the Cinque Ports, a market town, poor-law union of thirteen parishes, and county court district, in the arch deaconry of Lewes and diocese of Chi chester. It is the eastern terminus of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway. The old town of Hast ings is situated in a valley between two hills, opening to the sea. On the east hdls are traces of a Roman encampment, and on the west are the ruins of the castle. The new part of the borough, caded St. Leonards, is in a direct line along the shore to the westward. The name of Hastings appears, in conjunc tion with that of \" Pevensea,\" in a charter of King Offa. The name is probably derived from the tribe of the Hestingii. In the reign of Athelstan, the town possessed a mint, and in that of Edward the Confessor it was incor porated among the Cinque Ports. The Normans landed not far to the west ward, and the famous battle of Hasting' took place at Battle, in its vicinity. In 1090 Wdliam Rufus took up his abode in Hastings Castle, which had only just been built or restored, and in the same"], [113, "75 year Battle Abbey was consecrated. In 1360 the town suffered from the French, and lost its importance until it graduady became celebrated as a watering-place. Hastings has been a place of note from very early times. Elizabeth gave the town a charter appointing a mayor and twelve jurats. The corporation, as now constituted, is the urban sanitary authority. The borough has a separate court of quarter sessions, and its own police force. A complete system of main drainage has been executed. The waterworks belong to the town ; the supply is chiefly obtained from Artesian and other weds, whence the water is pumped by steam-power to the summit of the hills. The gasworks belong to a company. There is a handsome borough cemetery at Ore, some distance from the town. The ancient castle is tastefully laid out in walks and gardens. There are seven churches, including All Saints' (1068) and St. Clement's (1284). The Independents have budt a handsome chapel at St. Leonards. Other denomi nations, including the Baptists, Wes leyans, and Roman Catholics, have places of worship, the last- named having also a college (All Souls'). Other struc tures include the town hall, music hall and assembly rooms, infirmary, dispen sary, and a handsome memorial tower to the late Prince Consort. There is also a handsome pier. The inhabitants are chiefly occupied in providing for the wants of the numerous visitors, Hast ings having long enjoyed the reputation of being one of the most favoured English sea-coast resorts. [Fairlight is situated about two miles north of the town. From this spot, which rises graduady to an elevation of nearly 600 feet, the eye wanders over a fine country of hdl and dale, varied with numerous towns ; a wide expanse of the British Channel, extending from Beachy Head to the South Foreland, a distance of eighty miles, and bounded by the cdffs of Boulogne. A descent from the rocks, by several paths, leads to the Dripping Well and to Fairlight Glen, 560 feet above the sea. At the top of the glen is Fairlight Place ; the road branching off to the right leads to the Lovers'-seat, a romantic spot, from whence may be seen a glorious view of the bold awe-: p of the cliffs right away to Dungeness, with masses of undercliff pded over each other in romantic con fusion, aud clothed with brushwood down to the very edge of the sands, while across the sea may occasionally be seen, in clear weather, the dim outline of the French coast. A charming spot is Pett, a small village north of Fair light, four miles and a half from Hast ings. At low water, during the spring tides, the remains of a wood may be seen imbedded in the sands. Guestling is a vidage north of Fairlight and Pett. Broomham Park, which skirts the side of the road, is a seat belonging to the Ashburnham family. Mayfield, in the parish of Guestling, is the birthplace of Gregory Martin, the translator of the Rheims version of the Bible. Ore is a small parish, two mdes north of-Hast ings. The church contains a sepulchral brass. Ore Place, a mansion belonging to the Elphinstone family, is situated on the north side of the churchyard. Part of the house is very old. A little on the Hastings side of Ore Rectory is a path which leads through fields to the Old Roar, a romantic spot, and a fa vourite resort of tho artist. Hollington is a small parish north-west of Hastings, chiefly remarkable for the picturesque and secluded situation of its church, which is in the centre of a wood, a quarter of a mile from any habitation. A longer excursion may be made to Bodiam Castle (13 mdes), a distance which will be slightly increased if, as may easily be done, Brede and Northiam are taken in the way. The return may be by SecUescombe. Brede is distant from Hastings one mile only, and should be visited, if only to examine the old parish church and its beautiful monuments. Brede Place, of which the great hall, &c, stdl remain, is now a farm-house. Crowhurst lies between HoUington and Catsfield. Crowhurst Church stands pleasantly in a vadey, surrounded by trees. The nave was rebuilt 1794. In the tower window are considerable remains of stained glass. Crowhurst was long held by the Pelhams ; and in the tower door-case, and the tracery of the windows above, occurs the well-known Pelham Buckle, the achievement adopted in memory of thc taking of the French King at Poic tiers, an exploit in which Sir John"], [114, "76 Pelham assisted. A wooden buckle, probably a part of the old screen, is also nailed to tho front of the gallery. In the churchyard is a noble yew of un known antiquity, twenty- seven feet in circumference at four feet from the ground. South of the church are the remains of an ancient manor-house of late Early English character.

KENT (County of).\u2014 Kent is a maritime county, bounded on the north by the Thames and German Ocean, east and south-east by tho latter ami the Straits of Dover, south by Sussex, and west by Surrey, and having on its east and south coasts the North and South Forelands and Dungeness. Length, 67"], [118, "80 and iu Romney Marsh, produce some of the richest pastures in the kingdom. The gardening of the county was much improved by the Netherland refugees in the sixteenth century. The woods in Kent are extensive, and produce much oak, beech, hop-poles, billet-wood, hoops and bark, besides timber for ships and house-building. The lathe of Sutton-at- Hone is a great fruit district, and the vadey of the Medway is famous for hops, and the hopping season is as joyous hero as the vintage is elsewhere. Building stone is quarried in the chalk, and the ragstono of the Weald. Fa versham, Milton and Whitstable arc celebrated for their oysters. The county returns two members for tho east division, two for the mid, and two for the west. It is in the South-eastern circuit, the assizes being held at Maid stone, and it constitutes the archdeacon ries of Canterbury and Rochester, in those dioceses, province of Canterbury. The borough representation comprises Canterbury (city), Dover, Greenwich (metropolitan borough), Maidstone, Rochester (city), and Sandwich, two members each, Chatham, Gravesend, and Hythe, one member each. The shire has 5 lathes and 61 hundreds, and comprises the barony of Bircholt, the lowery of Tunbridge, the liberty of the Isle of Sheppey, the liberty of New Romney, 437 civd parishes, besides parts of others, 25 poor-law unions (exclusive of the Metropolis), 1 poor-law district under a special Act (Canterbury), 3 poor-law unions within the Metropoli tan district (Greenwich, Lewisham and Woolwich), 29 registry eUstricts, 12 municipal boroughs [Canterbury (city and county of itsed), Deal, Dover, Faversham, Folkestone, Gravesend, Hythe, Maidstone, Margate, Rochester (city), Sandwich, and Tenterden], 34 urban sanitary authorities, 25 rural sanitary authorities, and 22 turnpike trusts. It also has one court of quarter sessions, and is divided into 16 petty sessional divisions and 17 lieutenancy sub-divisions. All the boroughs above named have commissions of tho peace and separate courts of quarter sessions, and their own police. The liberty of Romney Marsh has petty and general sessions,and theancient borough of Queen borough has a court of quarter sessions mdes ; breadth, 35 miles ; circumference, 190 miles; square mdes, 1,627. Watered by the Stour, Medway, Darent and other rivers. The Medway is the noblest feeder of the Thames, and has a total length of sixty miles, forty of which are navigable. Lime-burning is carried on upon the Lower Medway ; on the upper streams, the paper trade, to which it is navigated by steam. Ships and large vessels get up to Rochester bridge. The Dour River is a very trifling stream, but it received its present name from the Britons, signify ing \" water,\" and was known also to tho Romans as the Durius. It gives name to Dover, in the valley of which it anciently formed the haven, now built upon and carried out seaward. The river Rother rises in Sussex ; it is navigable on its entry into Kent, and was anciently called by the Britons and Romans the Limene, entering the sea at New Romney. In the time of Ed ward I. it deserted its channel, and formed a new one by Rye and Winchel sea. The principal canal is the Royal Mditary Canal,running along the borders of Romney Marsh from the Rother to Hythe, very little above the level of the sea. The Gravesend and Rochester Canal has been partly used for the North Kent Railway, but its basins and the portions from Gravesend to Higham still remain. The county is intersected by nearly 4,400 miles of roads, and the railway communi cation is effected by the lines belonging to the South Eastern, and London Chatham and Dover Railway Companies. On that part of the coast bounding the estuary of the Thames, there are num erous examples both of the gain and loss of land by the sea. Off the east shore lie the well-known Goodwin Sands, between which and the mainland is the equally weU-known roadstead caUed the Downs. Kent may be designated a hilly country, being divided by two nearly paraUel chains of chalk hdls, which traverse the county west to east, terminating in lofty chalk cliffs at Dover, Folkestone and Hythe. The climate of Kent is in general mdd and genial. The soil may be divided into the gravel, chalk and clay, which pro duce, whero they mix in due proportion, an extremely fertile loam. The aduvial sods along the Thames and Medway,"], [119, "81 distiuct from the county. Dover, Hythe, New Romney, and Sandwich are cinque ports, and Deal, Faversham, Folkestone, and Margate are corporate members of on e or other of them. Fordwioh (corporate member ofthe cinque port of Sandwich), Lydd (corporate member of the cinque port of New Romney), and New Romney are governed under old charters and not amenable to the Municipal Corporations Act, 1835. The Cinque Ports' justices exercise jurisdiction in and for the Deal Division of the liberties of the Cinque Ports (comprising the parishes of Ringwould and Walmer and the hamlet of Kingsdown), and the parish and town of Ramsgate. The towns of Ramsgate and Tunbridge Wells main tain police estabdshments separate from the county. A considerable portion of the county is included in the Metro poUtan PoUce, Central Criminal Court, MetropoUtan Board of Works and London School Board jurisdiction. Chalk and greensand prevail in the hiUs, and clay mixed with gravel, sand or loam in the more level tracts. Kent is first distinctly noticed by the name of Cantium, doubtless a Latinization of the ancient British appellation of the same territory. By the Saxons it was called at first Kant-ieara-rike, meaning the \"Kentish men's country.\" The present name is an evident derivation of the first word of the Saxon compound. In the earUest times of English history the \" men of Kent \" showed themselves true to then* origin, and were looked upon as the stay of our naval power. Hence the establishment of the Cinque Ports, endowed witb exclusive and valuable privileges, and which, dowu to the seventeenth century, supplied the greater part of the shipping and seamen to our fleet. It remains at the present time in the possession of the chief of our naval arsenals, and contains many important estabUshments. Julius C\u00e6sar laneled here, and Kent has been the seat of many sanguinary conflicts. Wdliam the Conqueror burnt Romney and Dover, but confirmed the men of Kent in their privileges. These are chiefly comprised in gavelkind (from the Saxon Gas el, signifying a rent or acknowledgment in money or in kind, and Gafelkind lands, those for which a rent w as paid, or, in other words, lands held by socage tenure, in contradistinction to those which were held by military service), or the suc cession of ad the sons, or brothers, and nephews to landed property, and the right of non-forfeiture of lands, except for treason. The year 1170 is memorable for the return of Thomas a Becket from Ids long exile, and still more so for his murder at Canterbury ; nor is the year 1172 less remarkable for the voluntary penance which Henry II. underwent at his tomb. ln 1381 the insurrection under Wat Tyler commenced at Dart ford, and the insurgents encamped on Blackheath, whence they proceeded to London. In 1450, also, the rebels under Jack Cade encamped upon Blackheath, and on the same heath, in the February fodowing, a great number of his par tisans craved pardon of thc king upon their laiets. In 1459 four thousand French troops landed on the coast, and burned the town of Sandv.'ich. The year 1677 is memorable in Kentish annals for the daring attack made by a part of the Dutch fleet on the shipping in the Medway. In December, 1638, the fugi tive King James II. was seized at Sheer ness and conveyed to Faversham. The Emperor Charles V. landed at Dover from Corunna, May 16, 1520, on a visit to Henry VIII. Charles II. landed at the same place, May 26, 1660, on his return from exile. The manufacturing industries of Kent include the making of bricks, tdes, pottery, cement, and lime, in which several thousand people are engaged, paper, gunpowder (Dartford, Erith, Tunbridge, and Faversham), sugar-moulds, tobacco-pipes, hop-bags, sacks, copperas, sugar refining, tar, whiting, and Timbridge ware. There are also considerable ship-building and marine-engine yards, iron foundries, breweries, maltings, and tanneries. The chief seats of manufacture are Greenwich, Deptford, Dartford, Maidstone, North fleet, and Faversham. The Cmque Ports figure conspicuously in EngUsh history. In the time of the Emperor Diocletian, the Romans placed that part of the British coast nearest the Continent under an officer called the \" Count of the Sea Coast,\" whose duty it was to protect it from invasion. In imitation of this, Edward the Confessor constituted thc live ports of Dover, Hastings, Hythe, Romney and Sandwich, a body cor-"], [120, "82 porate, under the government of a portreeve or warden, who also held the office of Constable of Dover Castle, and they afterwards became designated as \" The Cinque Ports ; \" to these were added in early times the ancient towns of Winchelsea and Rye, to which all the privdeges of the Cinque Ports were given. They had a peculiar jurisdiction, separate from that of the county, and were obliged to furnish ships and forces in war time, but, jn return, were exempted from pecuniary subsidies, and had other im munities, one of which was that they could not be sued in any but their own towns ; the warden was also permitted to rank as an admiral. William the Conqueror, however, first gave the Cinque Ports an independent jurisdic tion ; by him they were created into a palatinate, with a lord warden, who was invested with civil and military authority, the chief seat of his adminis tration being Dover Castle. Each of the five ports had its own corporation of twelve jurats, from whom the mayor and bailiff were chosen. Formerly there were several courts exercising a general jurisdiction over the ports, and their members, extending from Birchington, near Margate, to Seaford, in Sussex, that of Shepway being the supreme court. The lord warden was the president, the other members being tbe several mayors and bailiffs, and a certain number of jurats from each town. The Court of Brotherhood and the Court of Guestling werc in some respects to be compared with the Imperial Parliament, and it is believed that they were the models on which the latter was originally estab lished. The Court of Lodemanage licensed and regulated the pilots. These courts are now only mere forms. In the Oth year of his reign, Edward I. gave the oldest charter now on record ; it is 99 years older than the first charter of the City of London. It states that the king had seen the charter granted by his predecessors, William I. and Edward the Confessor. In the 18th year of tho reign of the same monarch, each of the ports returned two \" barons \" or members to Parliament. Charles II. gave the Cinque Ports their last charter in the 20th year of his reign. Untd the revolution of 1688 the lord warden exercised the right of nominating one, and sometimes both the members of Parliament for ouch port ; a special Act abolished this pri vilege in 1689. The Parliamentary Reform Act of 1832 and the Municipal Act of 1835 broke up to a great extent the peculiar political and municipal organization of tho Cinque Ports, and their local government has been assimi lated to other towns. By the 1st sec. of 51 Geo. III., cap. 36, the magistrates of the Cinque Ports (who are appointed by the Lord Warden) are empowered to act in such of the liberties of the Cinque Ports as have not separate commissions of the peace. They now exercise their functions in Ringwould, Walmer, and Ramsgate.

The two parish churches are small buildings, with no particular fea- tures calling for notice. Area: 3,234 acres. Population : 631. LEATHERHEAD.\u2014 (STATION.) \u2014 A small town and parish of the county of Surrey (western division) ; in Epsom union, county court district, and petty sessional division. The ancient name of Leatherhead is supposed to be derived from the British word Llethredd, signi- fying a sloping situation. It is not mentioned, however, in Domesday Book, although in the reign of Henry III., it was sufficiently important to possess a sheriff's court. Stane Street runs from Leatherhead, past Chessington to King- ston, and is of Roman origin. The town is pleasantly situated on a gentle ascent from the river Mole, which is crossed by a brick bridge of fourteen arches. The church of St. Mary and St. Nicholas is a cruciform structure,supposed to have been erected in the thdteenth century; it stands on an eminence and contains several mo- dern monuments. There are Nonconfor- mist chapels, and a large Church of England school. Malting, brewing, and brick and tile making is carried on here. The town formerly had a market. Fair ; October 10 (pleasure).

Return Tickets (4 days), 4/- /, 3/-s, 2/9 t LEWES. \u2014 (JUNCTION STA- TION.) \u2014 A parliamentary (and muni- cipal borough under the Municipal Acts, by charter granted in May, 1881) borough, urban sanitary district, and market town, the capital of the county of Sussex (locally in the eastern division). It is the head of a poor-law union, county court district, and petty sessional division, and a place of considerable"], [122, "84 antiquity and interest. It has always possessed corporate institutions, which, however, had little to distinguish them from those appertaining to a manorial court, and the duties of the officers were of a nominal character. Two high constables weie, by custom, annually appointed by the lords of the borough at a court leet held for that purpose, upon selection and presentment by the leet jury, from persons who had previously serveel the office of headborougb. An entry of their appointment was made by the stewards in the minutes of the court leet. Their duties were to call and attend public meetings (of which the senior high constable was chairman), to keep up the public walks and pleasure grounds within the borough, to repair the pro perty belonging to the borough, and to pave the town. They held the title-deeds of property belonging to the borough, and they applied its revenues in paying the town clerk and thc other expenses of the town. They were the returning officers of the borough. Two head boroughs were nominated by the high constables, and appointed by the lords of the borough. The duties of the headboroughs were almost nominal, but they had to attend with the high constables at all town meetings, and also when proclamations received from the sheriff of the county were proclaimed, as well as at the election of a member of Parbament for the borough. The formal incorporation of the borough varies many of these ancient usages. Before the Norman Conquest the lord ship of Lewes was vested in the crown ; but William I. gave it, together with the whole rape of Lewes, to his son-in-law, William de Warren, a Norman baron, who either rebudt from the foundation or enlarged and strengthened the castle, which had been erected by the Saxons, and made it his principal residence. Lewes continued in the possession of the Earls of Warren till 1347, when on the death of the last earl, the property de volved to his nephew, Richard Fitz Alan, Earl of Arundel, whose grandson leaving no issue, his estates were divided be tween his three sisters, and are still held in coparceny by their descendants. Near Lewes, on the slopes of the hill known as \" Mount Harry,\" was fought, on the 14th of May, 1264, tho great battle between the forces of King Henry III. and those of the confederate barons in insurrection against him, under the command of Montfort, Earl of Leicester, who completely defeated the royalists, and subsequently concluded a truce or treaty with thc king. The castle stands on high ground in the centre of the town, close to the High Street ; the remains are not extensive, but the gate-house is a good specimen of the architecture of the reign of Edward III. It is the property of the Earl of Chichester, by whom it is leased to the Sussex Arch\u00e6ological So- ciety, who use the rooms as a museum. The Priory ruins are extensive and pic- turesque, and are close to the junction of the branch line to and from Brighton. The priory was founded by William, Earl of Warren, and his wife, Gundrada, daughter of the Conqueror, in 1078, and dedicated to St. Pancras. It was the principal establishment belonging to the Cluniac monastic order in England ; and at the time of its suppression by Henry VIII. its revenues amounted to \u00a31,090 per annum. Here also were hospitals, dedicated to St. James and St. Nicholas, and a convent of Franciscan Friars. Southover church, a budding of many styles, contains the tombs of William de Warren and Gundrada. Their remains rest in leaden coffins, each about three feet long, from which fact it is clear that there must have been, at some time or other, an exhumation and re-interment of the remains. These coffins were dis- covered in the Priory grounds, in 1 845, during the progress of the railw ay works. The principal public buddings are the churches, the assize hall, the naval pri- son, and the house of correction. St. Anne's, though one of the smallest of the churches in the town, is extremely in teresting ; it is a very neat example of the Early EngUsh style. The free gram- mar school was founded and endowed in 1512. In the town are a mechanics' institute, subscription library, assembly- room, record-room, etc. The county hall is a handsome modern budding. A county gaol has been recently erected out- side the town. Grain and salt, sheep and cattle, are now the principal articles of trade. The average number of sheep sold every year at the fairs of Lewes is said to exceed 100,000. Market Days : Every Tuesday (corn and hops ; alternate"], [123, "85 Tuesdays (stock).

LITTLEHAMPTON. \u2014 (TER- MINAL STATION.)\u2014 A seaport town, urban sanitary district, and parish of the county of Sussex (western division) ; in East Preston union, and Arundel county court district and petty sessional divi- sion. The town is situated at the mouth of the river Arun. It is now much fre- quented as a watering-place, as it pos- sesses all the attractions of retirement and seclusion, a mild and salubrious air, and the advantages of rural scenery. The sands at low water are firm and dry, and carriages may travel on them as far as Worthing. Littlehamptou is the port for the London Brighton and South Coast Railway Company's steam service to Honfieur and Havre (see pages xii. and 29). A large quantity of cattle is im- ported here from Brittany, Spain, and Normandy ; and there is also a steam- boat service to and from Jersey during the summer months. Littlehamptou de rived its name, according to a legend, from Ham, an assassin, who was slain by Arviragus, when Gwyder defeated Claudius. Queen Matilda landed here 1139 ; and Philip, Earl of Arundel, was arrested on the shore as he was trying to escape to the continent. Like Bognor, Littlehampton is quite open to\u00b0 the English Channel. The river, 370 feet broad, is crossed by a floating bridge, similar to those at Portsmouth, Torpoint, and Saltash, but of smaller size. The trade has been considerable of late years, being favoured by the river communica- tion with an extensive district ; and there may be daily seen along the quays a number of vessels engaged in loading and unloading of freights of various kinds. On the western side of the river there is a shipbudding yard, where a large number of men are employed, and in which some fine vessels have been constructed. A new military fort, con- structed on the most modern principles, mounting Armstrongs and mortars, has been erected at the mouth of the river ; and from the eastern side a pier with a lighthouse run3 out into the sea. The church of Sr.. Mary the Virgin, situated at the foot, of the main street, was re- built in the year 1820, at a cost of \u00a33,000, and is capable of accommodating 1,200 persons. There is also a large Roman Catholic chapel, midway between the beach and the town, to which the ducal house of Norfolk are the main contributors ; besides several dissenters' chapels.

MERTON ABBEY.\u2014(STA TION.) \u2014 This station is in the parish of Merton aud county of Surrey (mid divi sion) ; in Croydon union, county court district, and petty sessional division. The parish is intersected by the river Wandle, which has several factories on its banks. One of these includes the remains of Merton Priory, founded in 1117, by Gdbert Norman, sheriff of Surrey, for Augustinian canons. During the thirteenth century it was noted for having a parliament held in it, which drew up the laws known as \" the Statutes of Merton.\" Thomas a Becket and Walter de Merton (founder of the college at Oxford) were scholars here. The parish church is of coeval date with the Priory, and was also founded by Gilbert Norman. It is principally Early English, and is remarkable for its length. In the interior is a monument, with effigies, to Gregory Lovell, 1597, witn his wife and family ; also one to Captain Cook, erected by his widow, who resided here. Merton Place, now removed, was for some time the residence of Lord Nelson and Lady Hamilton. Area : 1,764 acres. Popu lation: 2,139.

MAYFIELD. \u2014(STATION.) \u2014A small town and large parish of the county of Sussex 'eastern division) ; in Uck field union and county court district, and Frant petty sessional division. Mayfield, situated on a pleasant hill, is particularly noted for its connec tion with the famous St. Dunstan, Arch bishop of Canterbury. One of the legends recorded of him is that, having built at Mayfield a wooden church, which, when finished, did not range true east and west, he gave it a big push with his shoulder and so set it right. Another well-known anecdote is that of his seizing hold of the devd's nose with a pair of tongs, who, after escaping, plunged his nose, in order to cool it, into a spring at Tunbridge Wells, whereby the chalybeate character was imparted to it, which it stiU retains. The parish church bears St. Dunstan's name, and is a commodious building, crowded with monuments. The town is also remarkable as having been the site of a palace of the Archbishops of Canterbury, erected, together with the original church, by St. Dunstan, in the tenth century. Provincial synods were held here in 1332 and 1362 ; and Arch bishops Meopham, Stratford, and Islip died here. Queen Elizabeth visited Sir Thomas Gresham here; and Thomas May, tho historian of the Long Parlia ment, was born in the palace in 1595. The palace and manor were surrendered by Archbishop Cranmer, in 1545, to Henry VIII., who granted the estate to"], [125, "87 circle of hills\u2014 at Highgate, Hampstead, Hornsey, and Harrow-on-the-Hid \u2014 none of which exceeds 400 feet in height, but from which a picturesque view may be obtained of the distant metropolis. The county lies within the basin of the Thames. The sub stratum is made up entirely of blue clay, or, as it is generally called, the London clay. In some parts the plastic clay attains a thickness of 100 feet to 120 feet. The soil is gravel, and although not of itself fertde, is so enriched by a profuse application of manure, that it has become equal in fertility to any part of England, and for pasture land, by the improvements made in the drainage, it far exceeds any other part of the kingdom. At the time of C\u00e6sar's invasion, this part of Britain, tc>gether with that now forming the county of Essex, was inhabited by the Trinobantes, the first British tribe that submitted to the sway of the Romans. On the final reduction of Britain it became a Roman province, and was included in the division called Flavia C\u00e6sariensis. The name is slightly corrupted from the Anglo-Saxon Middle- Seaxe, signifying the county of the Middle Saxons. Including, as Middlesex does, the Metropolis, it is the seat of manufactures of ad description, and the influence of its trade and commerce extends to every part of the civilized world.

The METROPOLITAN JURISDICTIONS MIDDLESEX (County of).- The Metropolitan County of England is bounded on the north by Hertford, east by Essex, south-east by Kent, south by Surrey, and west by Buckinghamshire. It is further defined by the Thames on the south, the Lea on the east, and the Colne on the west. It is one of the smallest counties in England, but by far the most important, as it contains the city of London, the great emporium of the world. Length, 26 mdes ; breadth, 18 miles; circumference, 104 miles; square miles, 281. In adcUtion to the rivers already mentioned, there are the Grand Junction and other canals. Mieldlesex is wholly within the Metropolitan Police District, and the jurisdiction of the Cen tral Criminal Court, and constitutes an archdeaconry, iu the diocese of London, and province of Canterbury. The county returns two members to parliament. The city and borough representation is as soUows ; London (city), four mem bers ; Chelsea, Finsbury, Hackney, Marylebone, Tower Hamlets and West minster (city), two members each. The shire has 6 hundreds, 222 civil parishes, besides parts of others, 27 poor-law unions, parishes or districts, of which 5 aro outside the metropolitan area, 26 registry districts, 20 urban sanitary authorities (exclusive of the Metropolitan Boarel of Works and metropolitan sanitary and nuisance authorities, of which 29 are in Middle sex), and 4 rural sanitary authorities. It has also one court of quarter sessions, and is divided into 17 petty sessional divisions and 18 lieutenancy sub divisions, of whieh the city of London is ono distinct from the county. The city of London is a county of itself, governed under the provisions of its numerous charters, and has distinctive courts of justice, and its own magistracy and police force. Westminster is a chartered and prescriptive city, with a limited exercise of municipal authority. Neither city is amenable to the Municipal Corporations Act, 1835, nor are there any boroughs within the county subject to that statute. The liberty of the Tower Hamlets is a separate juris diction, but the powers of its magis trates have been much abridged. The surface of this county is mostly level, the plain being enclosed with a"], [126, "88 are as follows : \u2014 The Metropolitan Police District extends over the whole of Middlesex (exclusive of the City of London) and the surrounding parishes in the counties of Surrey, Kent, Essex, and Hertford, of which any part is within twelve miles from Charing Cross, and those also of which any part is not more than fifteen miles in a straight line from Charing Cross.

MIDHURST. \u2014 (STATION.)-A parliamentary borough and market tewn of the county of Sussex (western divi sion) ; in the union, county court dis trict, and petty sessional division of the same name. Midhurst is a borough by"], [127, "89 prescription, and returned two members to Parliament pursuant to an Act passed in the fourth year of Edward II. ; but on the passing of the Reform Act the representation was reduced to one mem- ber, and the boundary extended to the adjoining parishes within a circuit of four mdes. The town is governed by a bailiff, elected annually at the court baron of the lord of the manor. The parish church is in the Later EngUsh style ; there are places of worship for Noncon- formists and Catholics, also a grammar school, founded in 1672; mechanics' institute, library, ike. The manor of St. John in this parish formerly belonged to the order of Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. About half a mile from the town are the ruins of Cowdray House. This building was erected about 1530 by the then Earl of Southampton, and was one of the most magnificent country houses of the period, besides being filled with art and antiquarian treasures of various sorts. On the re-marriage of the Earl's mother, Cowdray passed to Sir A. Browne, her husband, created in 1554 Viscount Montague. Eight vis- counts of this creation held it. In 1793, while in the hands of the eighth, it was entirely destroyed by fire, and its pos- sessor being drowned a few weeks after- wards in Switzerland, and leaving no direct heir, the title became extinct, and the house bas never been rebuilt. After the last Lord Montague's death, the propertv passed to his sister, who mar- ried W! S. Poyntz, Esq., M.P. At his death it was bought, in 1848, by the then Earl of Egmont, whose successor has erected for himself a new mansion in another part of the park. In 1591, Queen Elizabeth, when on a visit here, is re- corded to have shot several deer with her own hand.

The place is called Michelham in Domesday Book. Mitcham has been appropriately described by many visitors as \" The great Surrey flower farm,\" there being here nearly two thousand acres of land covered with plantations of peppermint, lavender, and other herbs. Sir Walter Raleigh for some time dw_elt here, so also did Dr. Donne. Sir Julius C\u00e6sar also resided at Mitcham, where he was honoured by a visit from Queen Elizabeth. Mitcham Grove, on the north side of the road to Sutton, was formerly occupied by Lord Chancellor Loughborough. The church is well worth a visit, and contains several relics of the olden times. The monu- ments are chiefly of a mural character. Among the entries in the parish registers is the foUowing : \u2014 \"Anne, the daughter of George Washford, who had twenty - four fingers and toes : baptized October 19, 1690.\" Fair: August 12, 13, and 14.

The rectory house is surrounded by a moat supplied with water by a neighbouring stream. NEWPORT, ISLE OF WIGHT \u2014 (STATION.) \u2014 A parliamentary and mu nicipal borough and market town, in the centre of the Isle of Wight, of which it is the capital, deanery of West Medina, and the archdeaconry and diocese of Winchester ; on the Medina river, at the head of its navigation. Newport communicates with the mainland by means of a railway to Sandown aud Ryde, thence by boat to Portsmouth and Southampton. It would appear that there was a town on the Medina at an ancient date, but, as there are no records of any church there before the erection of that dedicated to St. Thomas a, Becket, it is inferred that the pl ot little importance before the time of Henry II. At the time the rastle of Carisbrooke was inhabited by its lords, and the priory retained its ecclesiastical dignity, the town of Carisbrooke was the metropolis of the island, and New port a poor fishing place. But when the lordship of the islaud was sold to Edward I., the castle lost its conse quence, aud in the ensuing wars with France the priory was sequestered as au alien priory. The town of Carisbrooke, thus deprived of its two principal sup ports, fell to decay ; while Newport, by the superior advantages of its situation, rose to be a flourishing town. Newport first returned two members to parlia ment in 1296 ; the privileges then ceased until 1585, when it was resun continued until the year 1867, when the representation was reduced to one mem ber. The first charter was granted about 1193 by Richard de Redvers, second Earl of Devon ; and a more important grant was made by the Countess Isabella de Fortibus, in which the town is styled \"the new borough of Medina,\" and its burgesses invested with all the market tolls and other privileges. Henry A IT. granted the petty customs within all ports and creeks of the island, which charter was confirmed and extended by Edward VI. and Elizabeth. The borough was first incorporated by James I., anil NEWHAVEN.\u2014 (Two Stations\u2014 TOWN and HARBOUR.)\u2014 A seaport town and parish of the county of Sussex (eastern division) ; in Newhaven union and Lewes county court district and petty sessional division. This is the London Brighton and South Coast Rad way Company's chief port of embarka tion and debarkation in connection with their Continental Service. [For parti culars as to the fleet and harbour im provementsseepagesx.and\u00e6ii.,andforthe route to aud from London and Paris see pages 5, 6, 7, 17, 20, and 31.] The ancient name of Newhaven was \"Meeching.\" The parish church stands on a hill to the west of the town ; the nave is modern, but the chancel is of Norman date. There are chapels and schools. The har bour is the best tidal harbour between Portsmouth and the Downs. The mouth of the river is protected by a battery on the heights near Castle Hid, and the river is crossed by a drawbridge erected in 1784. There are a shipbuilding yard and large bonding warehouses. The chief imports consist of coal, tnnber, corn, wine, and spirits, and there is a good coasting trade in flour and butter. The exports are limited, most of the vessels going out in ballast. Louis Philippe landed here in 1848, after his flight from France. Area: 999 acres of land and 218 of water. Population : 2,549. Average Train Service : Six each way on week days ; two each way on Sun days (exclusive of the special tidal trains) .

NEWICK and CHAILEY. \u2014 These two places are on the route of the r.ew line from East Grinstead to Lewes, and Newick is designated as a probable station ; it is in the county of Sussex (eastern division), Chailey union, and Lewes county court district and petty sessional division. There is nothing in the village which commands notice ; the church is a plain building. Newick Park is a very fine ertate. Area : 1,966 acres. Population; 988. Chailey (adjoining Newick) has two large commons, re spectively ca Ued the \"North\" and the \"South\" commons. The former was,"], [129, "91 afterwards governed under the con firmatory charter of Charles II. It so continued until the passing of the Municipal Act, by which it was divided into two wards. The borough has a separate commission of the peace, and its own police force. The corporation is the urban sanitary authority. The town is clean and well built, supplied by the municipal authorises with water from Carisbrooke, and lighted with gas. There are also cemeteries adjacent to the town. The principal buildings are the churches of St. Thomas a Becket, St. John, and St. Paul ; the first named contains a handsome marble monument erected by Queen Victoria to the memory of Princess Elizabeth, daughter of Charles I., who was a feUow prisoner with her father in Carisbrooke Castle, and died there in 1650. She was in terred in this church in a vault, discovered during some repairs in 1793. The town also contains Roman CathoUc and dissenting chapels, a gudd hall, market house, gaol, two assembly rooms, savings' bank, freemasons' had, museum, and the Isle of Wight Institute, which contains a large collection of antiquities from various parts of the island. Os borne house, the marine seat of the Sovereign, is in the neighbourhood. Within short distances are \u2014 Carisbrooke Castle, where Charles I. was confined for some time, and Parkhurst barracks, with the prison for invalid criminals, opposite to which is a large house of industry for the entire island. The free grammar school was founded in 1612 by Sir Thomas Fleming and others. In the schoolroom was signed the treaty between the parliamentary leaders and Charles I., afterwards known as the treaty of New port. There are also the blue-coat school for girls, founded in 1761, and other schools ; Worsley's almshouses and the Upper almshouses, <fec. Newport has a trade in malt, corn, and timber, Isle of Wight dough-nuts, lace, and mats ; brushes are also made here, but the principal business of the place consists in supplying the wants of its numerous visitors.

NORWOOD JUNCTION (aDd LOWER NORWOOD). \u2014 (STA TIONS.) \u2014 A suburban district of the metropolis, parth* in the parishes of Croy don.LambethandBatteresa,in the county of Surrey (eastern division) ; in Lambeth union and Croydon county court district and petty sessional division. The oldest district church is All Saints', built in 1827, on Beulah Hid, a commanding situation, which causes it to be a con spicuous object for miles round. There are six other district churches, most of them being erected in handsome styles of architecture. There are national and British schools ; a district school for the pauper chddren of Lambeth parish, and a very spacious and costly structure for the pauper children of the city of London ; also several almshouses, a Roman Catholic convent, and a female school. The South Metropolitan Ceme tery is at Lower Norwood, and the healthiness and beautiful scenery of the locality, with its proximity to the Crystal Palace, causes it to be much favoured for superior charitable institutions and private residences. Lower Norwood, on the line from Victoria to Balham, and the Crystal Palace, is the station for the cemetery. The principal church here is St. Luke's, built 1825.

OCKLEY and CAPEL.-(STA TION.)\u2014 Ockley is a vdlage and parish of the county of Surrey (western divi sion), in Dorking union, county court"], [130, "92 to the immediate use of the Royal Famdy. The manor of Osborne was formerly held by the family of Bower man, and, after its intermediate pos session by other proprietors, became the property, in the reign of Charles I., of Eustace Mann, Esq., of whom it is traditionally recorded that, during the civd war, he buried some valuable pro perty in a wood within the manor which he could not find again, the place being to this day known as Money Coppice. By the grand- daughter of this Eustace Mann the estate was conveyed to the Blachfords by marriage, and by their descendants alienated to Her Majesty. Between the boundary of the park of Osborne and the town of East Cowea, intervenes East Cowes Park. At the dip of the hdl, and immediately adjoining the boundaries of East Cowes Castle, is the church of East Cowes, dedicated to St. James, erected in 1831. The parish church of East Cowes is that of Whip pingham, to which a rural footway is directed from the town itself ; or it may be reached by proceeding on the highway which skirts the Osborne domain, and passes, within it, Barton Farm \u2014 formerly an oratory of Augustine Friars, founded in 1282, by John de Insula, rector of Shalfleet, and Thomas de Winton, rector of GodshiU, who endowed it with the manor of Whippingham, the demesne lands of Barton, and others at Chale. The church of Whippingham, usuaUy attended by the Royal Family, wheD sojourning at Osborne, is a structure of incongruous appearance, and singular in effect, displaying no characteristics of former high estate, or of the great an tiquity of its appropriation. The records of the manor of Barton or Whipping ham go back to the reign of tho Con fessor ; and the parish, including that of Wootton, which still acknowledges the authority of the mother church of Whippingham by an annual compen sation, was one of the six within the island bestowed on the Abbey of Lyra. The first stone of the new church was laid by the Queen in 1860, from designs suggested by the Prince Consort, who was frequently upon the spot, himself superintending tbe progress of the works, and determining upon the details of thc building. OXTED. -This place is on the route district and petty sessional division. This place was anciently called Stane Street, from its being on the Roman Road of that name which connected Chichester with London. The ancient church of St. Margaret was thoroughly restored in 1873. Holmbury Hill, a commanding eminence, is said to have been the scene of a battle in 851, between the Saxons under Ethelwolf and Athel stan, and a large army of Danes, wherein the latter were defeated withgreat slaugh ter, and finally exterminated near Battle Bridge at Red HiU.

The Train Service to aud from the station is constant, and the Fines for the London terminii small. OSBORNE\u2014 (Station \u2014 COWES \u2014 2 miles.) \u2014 Osborne, formerly called Austerborne, the palatial marine retreat of Her Majesty, succeeds Norris on the eastern line of coast, and irrespective of the importance invariably attached to the demesnes of royalty, is a property most judiciously selected for its purpose ; pos sessing, as it does, the advantages of an almost unrivalled prospect, as well as the strictest seclusion. The Palace of Osborne is in the Palladian style of architecture ; the plan, it is understood, having been principally conceived by the late Prince Consort, and the natural beauties of the situation then evidently studied, in order to give character to the building itself, as well as contrast to the open channel in front, and adjacent coast scenery of the island. Its erection was commenced in 1845, and it may be likewise remarked that the most elevated position of the structure is appropriated"], [131, "93 of the line, in course of construction, between East Croydon and EastGrinstead, and is designated as a probable station. It is a parish of the county of Surrey (eastern division) ; in Godstone union and petty sessional division, and Reigate county court district. The district is almost entirely agricultural. The parish church \u2014 a Gothic building, containing some memorial brasses \u2014 was restored in 1877. Area : 3,659 acres. Population : 1,164.

It is a much favoured residential suburb. The Rye is a small common of triangular form. The Grand Surrey Canal bounds the dis trict on the north. There are five district churches and numerous chapels. The Licensed Victuallers' Asylum, founded in 1827, for decayed members of the trade, is in Asylum Road, aud consists of 170 separate habitations, each containing three rooms. The buddings form three sides of a quadrangle ; in the main or central building is the chapel, which has a pediment front supported by six columns of the Ionic order, surmounted by a tower and clock. The school of the Licensed Victuallers is situate in Upper Kennington Lane. The almshouses of the Girdlers' Company are in the Chou mert Road, and were built in 1852 ; the former almshouses were inPesthouseRow, St. Luke's, and were endowed in 1609 by George Palyn.

PET WORTH.- (STATION.) \u2014A market town and parish of the county of Sussex (western division) ; in the union, county court district, and petty sessional division of the same name. The long connection of Petworth with the ducal house of Northumberland and the art treasurers of \" the House \" (the seat of Lord Leconfield, and a descendant of the Percys), combine to render the place one of great interest to visitors. The parish church was erected tern]). Henry VIII., and has in late years undergone extensive restorations ; an adjoining chapel served as the court-house of many of the Percys. The Domesday Book Petworth is styled \"Petevide,\" and was the property of the Countess Eddeva, during the reign of the Confessor. After the Conquest it was held by the Earls of Arundel, one of whom, Robert Montgomery, iu 1102 rebelled against theCrown,in consequence whereof his estates were forfeited, and Petworth became royal property. On the marriage of Adeliza, dowager queen of Henry I with William de Albini, the earldom of Arundel was revived and conferred on her husband, and this manor was given tu her brother, Josceline. From this family by marriage, the manor of Petworth passed to Henry Percy, ancestor of the Earls of Northumberland. Upon the death of Josceline(eleventh earl) who died abroad without male issue, the earldom became extinct. His daughter, Elizabeth, sole heiress to the vast estates, contracted three marriages, the last being with Charles, Duke of Somerset, by whom she had issue (with five other children) \u2014 Al gernon, seventh Duke of Somerset, and Catherine, who married Sir WTilliam Wyndham,whose son, Sir Charles, became Earl of Egremont, and Secretary of State in 1761 ; he died in 1763, and was sue- PENGE.\u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 A hamlet and ecclesiastical district of the parish of Battersea, in the county of Surrey (east ern division) ; in Croydon union, county"], [132, "94 ceeded by his son, George O'Brien, Earl of Egremont. Upon his death in 1835, the estate passed to his son, afterwards created Lord Leconfield,who died in 1869, leaving the estate to his son. The family mansion, Petworth House, contains one of the richest private collections in the country. The pictures are more than six hundred in number, and there is a fine sculpture gallery. The sword used by the famous \" Hotspur \" at the battle of Shrewsbury, where he met his death, is preserved here. The budding has a frontage of 324 feet in breadth, and 62 feet in height to the parapet, having twenty-one windows in each of the three stories. The park wall is twelve miles in circumference. The park is beautifully undulating, and graced with trees of the noblest growth ; the views which it com- mands of the Downs of Surrey and Sussex and the intervening scenery are of singu- lar beauty and grandeur. The park is open to the public, who are also allowed to view the house on Tuesdays and Thurs- days, on application at the lodge. Mar- ket Days: Every Saturday.

PEVENSEY. \u2014 (STATION.) \u2014A village and parish of the county of Sussex (eastern division) ; in Eastbourne union, Pevensey petty sessional division, and Hastingscounty court district. The parish is comprised within the liberty of PevenBey,which enjoys pecuUarprivileges under the charters of the Cinque Ports. In addition to Pevensey the whole of Westham and part of the parish of Hail- sham are comprised in the liberty, which is situated in the rape of Pevensey. Pevensey is a corporate member of the cinque port of Hastings. The corpora- tion, which has no special charter, is en- titled to, and does, hold its petty and quarter sessions of the peace, but pri- soners are not tried at the latter court. It is composed of a bailiff (elected annuaUy from the jurats), jurats and other officers. The baiUff and jurats are liberty magis trates, the former being considered the chief magistrate. The freemen have the same privdeges as those of the Cinque Ports, and none are enjoyed within the liberty distinct from those in force in the other ports. The Roman name of this place was Anderida, and it was here that Widiam the Conqueror landed on the 29th of September, 1066, for his invasion of England. Pevensey Castle, the pro perty of the Duke of Devonshire, is constructed of Roman materials ; the outer walls enclose an area of about eight acres, and are about 20 feet in height. Within is a smaller fortification, moated on the north and west, and of a quad rangular form, with round towers, and was formerly entered by a drawbridge ; the eastern wall of both is the same, and stands upon a cliff: the circum ference of the inner castle is about 25 rods, and of the outer walls 250 ; it is in good condition for castellated remains of Roman origin. The walls are covered with ivy and creeping plants. The low cliff on the south side was formerly washed by the sea, now a mile distant. The public are admitted to view the rain at aU times. In 792 Pevensey was given by Bervald, a general of Offa, to the abbey of St. Denis at Paris ; it had twenty four burgesses in the reign of Edward the Confessor, and was ravaged by Earl Godwin to avenge some supposed affront, and in tbe reign of WilUam Rufus, Henry Il.and Richard II. , the castle was beseiged. Soon after the reign of Henry III. it fell into decay. [The circular and diminutive forts on the Kent and Sussex coast line, and which stud the shore more thickly between Hastings, Pevensey and East bourne than at any other spot, are apt to provoke a smile in an era which has re volutionized the art of war. Neverthe less it was practical experience of the defensive facilities of one of these little towers by Lord Hood and General Dun das, at Martello Bay, in 1794, which induced the resolution of the Govern ment to guard the most vulnerable points of our southern shores with counterparts of it. For several hours the Corsican tower successfully defied the assaults of two large English men-of-war, which were seriously injured by discharges of red hot shot. Not until they had sustained two days' continuous cannonading did the small garrison of thirty-three men \u2014 two of whom were mortally wounded \u2014 capitulate. This demonstration of the"], [133, "95 possibility of maintaining a determinod resistance in such a simple fortification provided the arguments which gave us our Martello Towers. They are circular brick buildings, from thirty-five to forty feet iu height. The doorway is gained by a ladder that, in time of danger, could be withdrawn into the interior, which consists of two floors, the walls being from five to seven feet thick. Round the rooms are loopholes for muskets, placed so high that the sleeping benches would have to be brought into use for reaching them. The roof is arranged for a tra- versing gun, in working which the gun- ners would be protected by the taU parapet . A trap-door in the centre of the lower casemate leads to provision and ammunition stores. The complete system of towers is said to have involved an expenditure of more than two miUions sterling. Many of them have now been dismantled, or transformed into dwell- ings for the members of the coast-guard, whilst a few have been enlarged and provided with new and more powerful armaments.] Market Days : Alternate Thursdays (for cattle).

The Royal Castle of Porchester is interesting, as having once been the occcasional fa- vourite residence of kings and queens of England. It was built by the Romans. Queen Elizabeth, who fre- quently held court here, at her own cost added many of the architectural beauties yet remaining. In a portion of the castle grounds stands the vener- able church, an undoubted remnant of the earliest ecclesiastical buddings in the kingloui, possessing many points of interest, it being of the early Norman style. The village is considered one of the healthiest on the south-west coast. Portsdown is within easy access, from the summit of which a view pronounced unparalleled in the kingdom for its varied sea and laud views.

During the reign of Alfred a fleet of nine ships fitted out at this port signally defeated the Danes, who had long infested the coast ; and im- mediately before the Conquest a large fleet wa3 fitted out here to intercept the Norman armament. About 1250, Henry III. assembled a large army here, with a view to embark it for the invasion of France ; in 1377, the French, though ultimately defeated with great loss, succeeded iu burning a large part of tbe town. This disaster appears to have shown the necessity of fortifying the place, and the works, originally com- menced by Edward IV., have continued to be improved and extended during a series of successive reigns, tiU they have become aU but impregnable. During the reign of Elizabeth the signals used on the approach of any vessel were established. In tho reign of Charles I. the Duke of Buckingham was assassin- ated here by Felton. Shortly after the commencement of the ParUamentary war, Cromwell's soldiers surprised Southsea Castle, of which they took possession, and the town itseU subsequently fell into their hands. After the Restoration, the nuptials of Charles II. with Catherine of Portugal were solemnized in the chapel of the garrison. In 1792 the Royal George, of 110 guns and 1,200 men, unfortunately sank in the road- stead, and the admiral and more than two-thirds of tlie crew perished. In 1814 the Prince Regent, afterwards George IV., remained here several days with the allied sovereigns. Portsmouth first exercised the electoral franchise in the 23 of Edward I., and since that time has regularly returned two members to ParUament. As many as twenty char- ters have been granted to this town by various monarchs, commencing with Richard I. and ending with Charles II. The corporation \u2014 now under the Municipal Acts \u2014 act as the urban sani- tary authority, and have conducted ex- tensive works of main drainage, which cost \u00a3200,000. The waterworks and gasworks are in the hands of private companies. The borough has its own court of quarter sessions, court of record, and police force.

PORTSMOUTH.\u2014 (Two Stations \u2014TOWN and HARBOUR)\u2014 A parlia- mentary and municipal borough in the southern division of Hampshire, situ- ated on a fine bay in the English Channel, opposite tbe Isle of Wight, and divided into four districts, viz. : Portsmouth, Portsea, Landport, and Southsea, all situate in the island of Portsea ; the largest royal naval estab- lishment, and strongest fortified place in England; head of a county court district, a polling place for the southern division of the county, garrison town, seaport, and coast-guard station, in the hundred of Portsdown, union registry of Portsea island, deanery of Drock- ford, and archdeaconry and diocese of Winchester. It is the terminal station of the Portsmouth branches of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway, and the London and South Western Railway ; having communica- tion with Chichester, Brighton, (fee, on the east, and with Southampton and the West of England, by means of the sta- tions of Havant and Cosham respec- tively ; by steamer with Ryde (the trains run to the landing piers both at Portsmouth and Ryde), Cowes, South- ampton, and Plymouth : and by canal with Chichester and London ; and with Gosport by floating bridge and steam launches. The harbour is secure, and sufficiently capacious to contain the whole navy of England. Its entrance is narrower than the Thames at London Bridge, yet having sufficient depth of water for any ironclad to enter at any time. Southsea lies to the east of Portsmouth, and New Southsea still farther east. Landport is au extensive district, about midway between the parish church and the buildings on Portsmouth Common. The island of Portsea is nearly 15 miles in circum- ference, aud tramways are laid through all the principal streets. Portsmouth is mentionod in the Saxon chronicle as existing in 501. It appears to have been substituted for PorcheBter, which"], [135, "97 a space of about twelve acres, forms a much-appreciated recreation ground, being in the midst of a densely-popu lated district. The Clarence Esplanade, one of the finest in England, has an uninterrupted view of Spithead and the Isle of Wight, from wliich place it is only 4J mdes distant. There are four cemeteries. The old town was one of the most perfect fortresses in Great Britain. The ramparts have now been pulled down, and the moats filled in, in order to bring tho towns of Portsmouth and Portsea in more direct communica tion with other parts of the borough. The principal churches are that of St. Thomas a Becket and St. Mary's church. There are many other churches and chapels. The town hall is combined with the market-place, the latter oc cupying the lower part. Other public buildings include the post office, theatre, assembly rooms, old victualling office, convict prison (at Portsea, in place of the hulks), custom house, sailors' home, penitentiary, (fee. There are also exten sive barracks. The principal institu tions are \u2014 Dr. Smith's grammar school, founded in 1732, and 12 elementary schools ; almshouses, and various charit able bequests for distribution among the poor ; infirmary, dispensary, hospital at Landport, and royal hospital at Hilse:i. The public works are very extensive, including the royal dockyard at Portsea, on tho east side of the har bour, containing about 120 acres. The harbour, perhaps the finest in the world, is no less than four miles in length, by nearly two in width, with an entrance of 220 yards across. It can, therefore, contain an immense number of dis mantled vessels, in addition to the reserve fleet, usuaUy numbering a total of about forty vessels. Among these is Lord Nelson's famous ship, the \" Vic tory.\" The arsenal on the ordnance gun wharf, which extends over 14 acres of ground, contains a large stand of arms, and ranged along the side of the wharf are the guns belonging to the ships not in commission. The port of Portsmouth extends from Emsworth, nine miles on the east of the town, to a place caUed Hdl Head, five miles to the we -sward. It is termed a free port, where merchandise is allowed to be kept in bonding stores free of duty until sold or exported. There are about 250 vessels belonging to this port, employed in the timber, corn, coal, foreign fruit and wines, and the coasting trades. Market Days : Tuesdays and Saturdays. Area: 9,513 acres.

PULBOROUGH.\u2014 (JUNCTION STATION.)\u2014 A small market town and parish of the county of Sussex (western division) ; in Thatcham union and Pet worth county court district and petty sessional division. Pulborough being on the old Roman road from Chichester to London, numerous Roman antiquities"], [136, "98 tress, but there are few records .1 itt history previous to the Norman era. After the Conquest it fell into the hands of the powerful Earls of Warren and Surrey, who built a castle, called Holm Castle, on a rock overlooking the town, beneath which is a remark able cavern, where, according to local tradition, the barons met to arrange the terms of Magna Charta. The castle has disappeared, and the space which it occupied is now a public garden vested in the corporation by Earl Somers, whose residence, \" The rriory,\" marks tbe site of an ancient religious establishment. The Priory Park is open to the public ; it is rich in sylvan scenery, and is much frequented. Lord Howard of Effingham, the commander of Queen Elizabeth's navy against the Spanish Armada, and Archbishop Usher, are buried in the chancel of the parish church ; their rest ing places are not indicated by ever simple inscriptions on the pavement. In a room above the vestry, built in 1503, is an unique library, formed in 1701 by the Rev. Andrew Cranstoun, vicar. It contains over 1,700 volumes, including some very choice manuscripts. Many of the books were given by the celebrated John Evelyn, of Wotton. Among other relics is shown Lord Howard's prayer-book. The borough returned two members to Parliament until the Reform Act of 1832, when its representation was reduced to one; it was disfranchised in 1867 owing to the prevalence of corrupt practices. Reigate was incorporated on September 11th, 1863, and the council adopted the Public Health Act in 1865. Main drainage works have been provided, and the corporation own a sewage farm of 200 acres. The borough is supplied with gas by two companies, and with water by two companies. The cemetery adjoins the churchyard and is controlled by a burial board. The borough has a separate commission of the peace and police force. The public buildings comprise the churches of St. Mary (parish church), St. Matthew (Red Hill), St. Mark, St. Luke (South Park), St. John (Red Hdl, with separate burial ground), a chapel of ease, and sixteen chapels for Baptists, Wesleyans, Friends, Roman Catholics, and Primitive Metho dists ; the old town hall, the public hall have been found here ; at Borough are traces of a Roman vdla. The parish church contains some thirteenth century brasses. Near Pulborough is Hardham, which possesses remains of an Augus tinian priory ; the River Arun here flows through a tunnel 400 yards long.

REIGATE. \u2014 (Station\u2014 RED HILL \u2014 1 mile.) \u2014 A municipal borough, market town, parish and poor-law* union of sixteen parishes, in the mid division of the county of Surrey, hundred of Reigate, deanery of Ewell, archdeaconry of Surrey, and diocese of Winchester. There are three radway stations in the borough, viz. : Red Hid, which is the junction for the main line from London to Brighton and the South Coast and the old main line of the South Eastern from London to Dover ; the Earlswood, on the Brighton line, three-quarters of a mde from the junction ; and Reigate Town, on the Guddford and Reading line. Reigate is designated in Domesday Book as \" Church -f elie,\" or \" the Church in the Field.\" It is supposed to have been a Saxon town possessing a for-"], [137, "99 (a handsome edifice), two poUce stations, the market hall (at Red Hill), the grammar school, the Philanthrope Society's Farm School, and the Earls wood Asylum for Idiots.

RYDE, ISLE OF WIGHT.\u2014 (Three Stations \u2014 PIER HEAD, ESPLANADE, and ST. JOHN'S.)\u2014 A municipal borough of the Isle of Wight ; a parish, township and fashionable water ing-place in the archdeaconry of South ampton, hundred and deanery of East Medina, and diocese of Winchester ; 3 miles from Stokes Bay (Gosport) ; 5 from Portsmouth, and 20 from Southampton- The town occupies the site of an ancient village called La Rye or La Riche. It was destroyed by the French in the reign of Edward IL, and was one of the three port'; to which all communication was restricted. At the close of the eighteenth century its advantages as a watering place began to attract attention, and it speedily grew into a populous town. The place was incorporated in the month of June, 1868, and the corporation assumed the sanitary duties which had been discharged for some years by a board of commissioners. The borough has its own police force. The waterworks are under the control of the town councd ; gas is supplied by a company. A ceme tery has been provided at the west of the town by the corporation. On approaching Ryde from the water, the pier, forming one of the most interesting marine promenades in the kingdom, necessarily ROTHERFIELD\u2014 (STATION.) \u2014 [This station is on the new line to and from Tunbridge Wells and Eastbourne, and supersedes in name that of Crow- borough (see under that head), which is on the Tunbridge Wells and Lewes line, and was formerly called Rotherfield. Both are in Rotherfield parish, and about a mile from each other.] Rotherfield is a village and parish of the county of Sussex (eastern division) ; in Uckfield union, Tuubridge Wells county court dis- trict, and Frant petty sessional division. The parish church of St. Denis is on a hid 600 feet above the level of the sea. It occupies the site of a. monastery founded in 800 by Berkenhold, king of the South Saxons.

The station is at tho south end of the Thames Tunnel, which, until it was purchased by the Radway Company, was long one of the sights of London. It was con- structed from the designs of Sir Isam- bard Brunei, and cost nearly half a million of money. It was not at any time a paying concern, and the share holders gladly got rid of it to the Railway Company for about half its cost. The"], [138, "100 the home shore of the island being observed the promontory of Cowes with the towers of Norris and Osborne, King's Quay (erroneously assigned in all local guides as the place of retirement of King John after his contest with the Barons ; a circumstance, however, completely refuted by the itinerary of his route from Runnimede, to be gleaned frym the F\u0153dera and other published coUection-* of the Record Commissioners), Woot ton Creek, a locality of growing importance, Binstead Villa, Ryde House, and the immediate environs of the town, denominated Pelham Fields ; eastward appearing turreted with villas and gar landed with woods, the domains of St. John's, and Appley, succeeding wliich are St. Clare, Spring Vale, Sea View, The Priory, St. Helen's and Bembridge. Attention will be primarily directed to the place of assemblage of the members of the Royal Victoria Yacht Club, on the western shore of the town. The first stone was laid with great eclat, by H.R.H. the late Prince Consort, on the 2nd of March, 1846. The Regatta in connection with this club usually \" comes off\" about the middle of August, and about a month later in the season the Town Regatta ; on both of which occasions, the smiles of Royalty are oftentimes vouchsafed. The town hall and market, an extensive and ornamental buildiug, was erected in the year 1827. The hall contains a fine bust, by Westmacott, of Mr. Saunderson, the architect, and is, in addition to its legiti mate use, appropriated for balls, concerts, (fee, as well as occasional exhibitions of the beauties of Flora, under the auspices of the Horticultural Society. St. Thomas's Church gives name to the street in which it stands, and is of pleasing elevation, although devoid of ornament or display. It was budt by the late George Plaj-er, Esq., on the site of a former edifice founded by his family in 1719, but which, from the gradual in crease in the population, had become insufficient for their requirements. The interior displays several interesting memorials, as well as the more simple ensigns of sorrow for the departed, and a stone to the north of the entrance, in the surrounding cemetery, marks the last resting place of the Rev. Edward Cannon, humorously described in Theodore Hook's celebrated novel of \" Maxwell,\" commands the first attention. Its length is nearly 800 yards, or upwards of a third of a mile, having an enlarged stage at the extreme end, which, until the construc tion of the railway pier on the eastern side, served for the convenience of the numerous steam packets which take Ryde in the routine of their daily engage ments, but, in reality, forming a pro menade that, for variety of scenery and interest, may be reasonably asserted to be without a parallel, lt projects from the shore due north, and, although the first stone was laid on the 29th June, 1813, the entire structure was not completed untd the year 1856. The portion on which the horse tramway is laid was added after that date. Persons may sub scribe for admittance by the week, month, or year, or render the tod each time of passing. The Railway Pier, finished in 1880, and the joint property of the London Brighton and South Coast and the South Western Railway Companies, is of the same length. The whole face of the prospect from this commanding position wears a most enlivening appear ance, and a more beautiful and interest ing scene, when the clouds are sailing to their chambers in the far west, and the summer breeze is on the Solent, cannot be readily presented to the eye of tho spectator than the one he is contem plating. There are the opposite coasts of Sussex and Hampshire rising out of the wide waters, with their lofty ranges of hills undulating the horizon ; Selsea BiU, where Christianity was first preached to the South Saxons, by Wilfred, the exiled Bishop of Lindisfarne, in 680 ; the grey outline of Chichester Cathedral, Hayling Island, Southsea Castle, with Haslar Hospital, Portsmouth and its forest of masts, and the weU-known anchorage of Spithead, seldom without one or more of the giant guardians of our coast riding there in trim array, \u2014 where in 1782, as is so well known, the Royal George of 100 guns suddenly went down in the fairest weather, leaving a remem brance of the extraordinary catastrophe that wiU never be forgotten, aDd where occurred the mutiny of 1797 \u2014 whde to the right the vision roams to the verge of the New Forest, Southamp ton Water, with Calshot Castle at its entrance, a considerable extent to the Mainland, Stokes Bay and Anglesea ; on I"], [139, "101 by the name of Godfrey Moss, and who is also alluded to more minutely as regards his every-day character, in the life of Barham, prefixed to the \" In goldsby Legends.\" The Church of the Holy Trinity, a prominent object in all aspects of the town, is the church for the Eastern district. It was built by public subscription some few years since, in order to meet the wants of the in creasing population in the immediate vicinity of the site. The other churches are St. John's, St. Mary's, St. Michael and AU Angels', and St. James's. The Roman Catholic Chapel, in the High Street, is a structure of some architec tural pretensions, and owes its origin to the private munificence of the Right Honourable the Countess Clare. The other places of worship of Ryde are those of the Independent Chapel, tbe Wesleyan Chapel, the Baptist Chapel, the Primitive Methodists, the Plymouth Brethren, and other denominations ; there are also,with few exceptions, schools in connection with each building. The Isle of Wight Infirmary, in the Ashey Road, is supported by voluntary con tributions. Near it are the cemetery and chapel of St Paul. [From Ryde there is a pleasant walk to Binstead and Quarr. In this walk, there is water and woodland, and antiquities fuUof instruc tion, a blending of nature and art \u2014 in truth, a varied scene before us. Sup posing, therefore, that the town and its busy hum are left behind, we find our selves passing its suburbs; delightful viUas in all directions rising around, some inhabited by the worthy and dignified of the world, and after leaving the road, and turning across the fields, soon see a picturesque cottage-Uke dwelling to the left of the pathway ; the turret of the little Church of Binstead, with numerous villas dotted over the smiling landscape, just visible above the trees before us ; and on our right, the grounds of Ryde House, where visitors are occasionally allowed the privilege of admission, by the presentation of tickets at the Lodge. The Church of Binstead isnoticedin Domesday ; but it was after wards made dependent on the neighbour ing monastic establishment of Quarr. The church itself was originaUy a quaint building of the Early English style of architecture, and in tbe rural appearance of its pristine simpUcity, added much to the harmony of surrounding associa tions ; the hand of the improver, however, ultimately came, and, by the erection of the present fabric, swept away aU traces of that which once arrested the attention of the antiquarian, and enlisted the curiosity of the pedestrian. Some sculp tured stones inscribed with the emblems of sin, the Holy Dove, Eternity, (fee. \u2014 mementos of the former building, and worked into the present masonry \u2014 will be observed ; as also a rude but curious representation of the human figure resting on a pedestal formed of a ram's head; an ancient key-stone that now constitutes the tympanum of the exterior gateway of the Churchyard ; and it must be like wise remarked that the neighbourhood of Binstead affords many evidences of the whereabouts of the quarries from which the stone was procured, that served, at an early period, for the construction of the Cathedral of Winchester, and then evidently in much repute ; Dr. Mantell also asserts that the stone procured from hence is used in several of the ancient Sussex churches, and in facing the Priory at Lewes. It is a variety composed of comminuted shells, held together by a sparry calcareous cement. A pleasant foot-path through \" Quarr Copse,\" leads to the remains of the Abbey, of which extensive structure only a few dis membered fragments remain to tell the tale of its ruthless destruction. History states the date of its foundation to be the year 1132, and that it probably ob tained its name from the quarries already spoken of. The founder was Baldwin de Redvers, Earl of Devon, who provided for its erection by a grant of the manor of Arreton, to Geoffry, Abbot of Savigny, in Normandy ; it being one of the first monasteries of the Cistercian order esta blished in England. Baldwin was suc ceeded in the Lordship of the Island by his son Richard, who confirmed all the grants the former had made to the Abbey, and added others, on the condition that the monks should pray for the souls of his father and mother. Successive charters of gifts to the Abbey of Quarr are still extant ; and in the annals of St. Werburg, it is styled \" the Daughter of Savigny.\" The site originally contained upwards of thirty acres of ground; the institution was largely endowed by many"], [140, "102 a pious benefactor, and its chapel was the last resting-place of numerous iUustrious personages ; among them, Earl Baldwin, his Countess Adeliza, and their son Henry. William de Vernon also bequeathed \u00a3300 (an immense sum in those days), for the erection of a tomb for himself aud his father, and in addi tion to other memorials there was a costly monument to the Lady Cicely, second daughter of King Edward IV., who died at Standen, in the parish of Arreton. After its dissolution, it was purchased by Mr. George Mills, a merchant of Southampton, for the sake of its materials, and reduced to one general wreck. His son re-alienated it to Lord Chief Justice Fleming, by whose descendants it is still retained. Several stone coffins, human remains, -fee., have been excavated within its boundaries ; but generation after generation have so rifled this once celebrated establishment, that the scanty portions which remain, afford but little satisfaction to even the most inquisitive antiquarian. The style of the building was evidently that known as the Early English, although altera tions and additions in the successive architectural distinctive eras may be recognised ; as, for instance, the insertion of a chimney and fire-place of the Per pendicular style \u2014 seemingly of the time of Henry VI. \u2014 in that portion of the ruins termed the Chapter House. The Refectory can likewise be clearly traced, but as to the apportionment of other fragments, it would be useless to conjecture.] The trade of Ryde is whoUy confined to supplying the wants of visitors and the inhabitants.

LEONARD'S. \u2014 (Two Sta tions \u2014 MARINA and WARRIOR SQUARE.)\u2014 St. Leonard's is an ancient parish within the borough of Hastings (sei also under that head), aud the county of Sussex. The improvements which have been effected in the imme diate neighbourhood of the station for the last few years are on a very large scale. Until recently, St. Leonard's had a separate local Act for its govern ment, and was to all intents and purposes distinct; it is now an integral part of the borough of Hastings. The town is quite a. modern creation, the first plans for it having been formed by Decimus Burton about forty years ago. The plan was a bold one, and it was executed with no little spirit ; for within that period there have been constructed a noble esplanade, extending for more than three miles along the beach; a handsome range of buildings caded the Marina, extending along the sea-front of the town, fronted with a covered colonnade of the same length, and several other terraces, as weU as detached villas, together with four churches, assembly rooms, bath-houses, libraries, and hotels. St. Leonard's also possesses pleasure grounds, and other appliances for the amusement or comfort of its visitors, among whom have always been many of our distinguished nobility and wealthy aristocracy. The walk along the esplanade, which reaches without in terruption from the Marine Parade at Hastings to the Marina of St. Leonard's, nearly five miles long, and commanding tine sea-views, is one of the noblest of the kind in this country. The church of St. Matthew is in the parish of St. Leonard's, about midway between Bohemia and Tivoli, near which stand some excellent residences, commanding most extensive views of the vaUey to Fairlight.

SANDOWN, ISLE OF WIGHT \u2014(STATION.)\u2014 A pretty viUage, plea sant bathing place and urban sanitary district of the Isle of Wight,between Ryde and Ventnor, and in the ancient parish of Brading.

It is situated amidst romantic scenery, and is but a short distance from Sandown. A footpath runs from San- down to Shanklin on the extreme edge of the cliff ; it is, of course, only applic- able to pedestrians, but commands some very beautiful views, which are only par- tially visible from the railway. The vil- lage of Lake intervenes between Sandown and Shanklin, and the approach to the latter place is as interesting as singular ; seated as it is in a small vale hanging to- wards the sea, though at a great height above the level, and, like most of the other places within the Isle of Wight that possess the attractions of real beauty, is rapidly progressing in size and import- ance. Shanklin Chine, the principal ob ject of curiosity, meanders from the vdlage to the shore, and is one of those fissures common on the coast of the Island ; graduaUy widening and deepen- ing as it reaches the verge of the ocean, where its width is about 180 and height 270 feet. The ruggedness of the sides is sof- tened by the foliage with which they are for the most part clothed ; and there is a cascade at the inland termination of the fissure, at best, however, Uttle more than a narrow rill, but which certainly adds much to the natural effect by its contrast to the shining green lichens and mosses with which the brow on either side is overhung. The roadway from Shanklin progresses through rows ' of flourishing elms to the church which stands near the Manor House, which now, as is al most invariably the case, is appropriated as a farmhouse. The church was for merly attached to that of Brading. It was built and endowed by one of the De Lisles, a Norman famdy now extinct. From this point m any lovely routes are open to the pedestrian. One proceeds through the enclosure in which the church is placed, ascends the down, and its course thereon to the left ultimately leads to Ventnor. A divergement may be also made over the same hid to Wroxall and Appuldurcombe, and thence to Ventnor, in both of which directions views of an ex tended and varied character are afforded ; whilst from the village of Shanklin a rus- tic way will, on inquiry, be pointed out, which progresses to Bonchurch and Vent- nor, coastwise, vid Luccombe and East End. From the church the main road winds most beautifully up the flank of Dunnose untd the ascent is gained, where views eminently fine are visible; the graceful winding shore of Sandown and Culver, the chalk hills of Yaverland, with the sea beyond them, in its tun- bounded by the distant blue heights of Hampshire and Sussex, in an uninter- rupted view of almost boundless extent. \u00bb The road then takes a southern direction to Luccombe, which lies at some short distance from the direct course, and where it is necessary to deviate on foot. Luccombe Chine, or chasm, does not run so far inland as Shanklin, but in many respects affords scenery superior to its more celebrated neighbour, the depth at the mouth being more considerable, the foUage of a more prominent character, and the sea level of the rocky stratum of a wdder and more striking formation. From Luccombe the Undercliff is shortly entered on, and the scenery then becomes more rude and majestic, although im provement has in many places marred natural beauty. Tbe Undercliff is an extended inland natural wall, bearing a great affinity to an ancient fortification, formed by a succession of landslips, or convulsions, which commenced at an un- recorded date, and have continued to our time ; beneath it being fields of every size, and rocky fragments of every form, intermixed with cottages and winding lawns, sudden elevations and deep dells, whdst many fathoms below ashelvy,rocky shore again Umits the broad, blue deep, with many a grotesque and confused heap of natural ruin scattered at its verge. There are two churches at Shanklin and several chapels, a literary and scientific institute, and schools. The esplanade is 600 yards long by 30 feet wide, and cost \u00a325,000. Area .* 675 acres.

SHEFFIELD BRIDGE.-This place is designated as a station on the line"], [143, "105 in course of construction between East Grinstead and Lewes, and takes its name from the bridge over the river Ouse. It is in the parish of Fletching and county of Sussex (eastern division) ; in Uckfield union and petty sessional di vision, and Lewes county court district. Simon de Montfort and his army en camped here, near the church, the night before the battle of Lewes. The Church of St. Mary and St. Andrew the Virgin is a large and ancient edifice. It is prin cipaUy in the Early English style, but the tower is Norman, with double windows high up in the walls, and divided by balusters. The floor of the nave has three different levels rising towards the chancel, which is separated from the nave by a wooden screen. The transepts are each entered from the nave by a fino arch. The north transept also contains several memorials of the Nevills. In the south transept, on an altar tomb, is a fine canopied brass commemorating Sir Walter Dalyngruge and his wife (date about 1390). In the same transept is a handsome marble tomb to Richard Leche (who died in 1596) and his wife, recumbent figures of whom lie beneath a canopy. At the extremity of the north transept, and built as a con tinuation of it, is the mausoleum of the Sheffield family. Gibbon, the historian, was buried here. On the floor of the north aisle is a well-preserved brass to the memory of Peter Devot, a glover (1450). The church has just recently been re stored. Sheffield Park, the seat of the Earl of Sheffield, is a modern Gothic structure, built on the foundations of a very ancient building ; the entrance to the grounds is through a Gothic arch.

Both places are on the eastern bank of the river Adur ; Old Shoreham, formerly a place of some importance, is half a mile north of the new town. Ella, the first King of the South Saxons, landed here to complete the conquest of England. Charles II. made his escape from Shoreham to France, after the battle of Worcester in 1651. The borough enjoyed the privi- lege of returning members to Parliament as early as the 13th century. In the last century it was temporarily disfran- chised for corrupt practices. The privi- lege was afterwards restored, but the borough area and the number of electors enlarged. There are now in the Parlia- mentary borough more than 40,000 inhabitants. Two members are returned. Shoreham town stands about a mile within the haven, and near the centre is the market house, supported by Doric pillars. A fine suspension bridge, erected in 1833, crosses the river. The harbour is frequented by ships of considerable burthen ; in spring tides it has about eighteen feet of water, about twelve in common, and from three to five feet at the ebb. Shoreham has a considerable trade in ship-building and its dependeni branches \u2014 ships of 700 tons have been launched here\u2014 and is noted for the ex- cedence of its oysters ; it carries on great traffic, and has a custom-house, erected in the Grecian style of architecture. Tbe parish church of New Shoreham is large, ancient and interesting from the fact of its being formerly connected with a monastery. That of Old Shoreham pos- sesses choice architectural features.

The village is situated close to the verge of the Downs. The church is of the Decorated style ; it was recently built, and occupies the site of an older church which was connected with St. Peter's Abbey, Chertsey. Ben hilton is a separate ecclesiastical district, and has a church of its own. There are numerous chapels in the district. The South Metropolitan District Schools for pauper children are in Sutton parish ; the buddings will now hold about 1,700 children and 100 adults. There is a separate building, about one-third of a mile from the schools, used as a proba tionary ward, where all boys and girls, on being transferred from London, have to remain for fourteen days before being admitted into the main body of the schools ; children are admitted from the parish of Camberwell and the unions of Greenwich,St.01ave's, Stepney and Wool wich.

A priory of Black Monks long existed here,and their property,known as Tooting Bee, belonged to the Abbey of Bee in Normandy. Tooting church was rebuilt in 1833. The old mansion of Tooting, once, it is said, a palace of Queen Eliza beth, was pulled down many years since. The Lambeth parish cemetery is in Lower Tooting. In Upper Tooting is the Surrey County Lunatic Asylum, a very large establishment, capable of holding 1,000 inmates. The neighbourhood is a favourite locality for respectable family residences, attracted hither by its open common and pleasant air. Area \u2014 Lower Tooting; 561 acres. Population: 2,327.

TULSE HILL.-(STATION.)\u2014 This station is on the Sutton Extension the waters were known as early as the beginning of the seventeenth century, and Queen Henrietta availed herself of these heahng springs, as well as the Queen and courtiers of the second Charles ; yet even 30 recently as only sixty years ago it was the custom, at the termination of each season, to close not only the hotels and boarding-houses, but even the shops and houses generally, till the approach of the following sum mer, the town being all but deserted during winter. Now all things have changed : rows of houses, estates of crescents, churches and new roads,occupy spots which were a few years since covered only with the heather. The Wells, indeed, is not a single place, but a district, comprising a series of scattered villages, mansions, and villas, within a circuit of three or four miles in diameter ; and the principal parts are named from the surrounding eminences, as Mount Ephraim, Mount Sion, Mount Pleasant, and the Wells proper : but by far the most beautiful quarter of this enchanting district lies to the north-east of the Wells proper and beyond Mount Sion. It is called, from having been formerly a private estate, Calverley Park ; nor can it be denied that the natural beauties derived from the variety of its surface,, and the richness of its verdure and foliage, are much enhanced by the im provements of art, and the erection of the pretty insulated viUas that fringe its borders without destroying its park-like appearance. Few towns in the kingdom have increased wdth such rapidity. From a mere village, which it was a century back, the population, since it was created a town, in 1835, and especially since the opening of the railway, ten years later, has progressed most remarkably. But the new buildings, numerous as they have been, have not been equal to the demand. The Local Improvement Acts and the facilities of railway communication have had the effect of not only increasing yearly the list of fashionable visitors, but have now rendered Tunbridge Wells, like Brighton, a permanent place of resi dence to many personswhosedailyoccupa tions are in the metropolis. The original vdlage forms what is now called the Wells proper, where are the parade, the pump-room and baths, the leading inns,, the libraries, and the assembly-rooms,. branch line, and in the parish of Streat- ham (see under that head), and county of Surrey.

TUNBRIDGE WELLS \u2014(STA- TION.) \u2014 A fashionable watering-place, urban sanitary district, and market town of the county of Kent (western division) ; it is comprised partly in the parishes of Tonbridge and Speldhurst, in Kent, and Frant, in Sussex, and is the head of a county court district and petty sessional division in the union of Ton- bridge. The local government of the town being under the powers of a local Act, a police force separate from the county is maintained by the inhabitants. Tunbridge Wells has high repute, a large permanent population, and is now of considerable standing as a fixed place of -habitation. The valuable properties of"], [149, "111 with the principal shops, many of which are on a scale of extent and splendour that may vie with those of Bath or Cheltenham. Few places are better supplied with every kind of provisions. The town has several churches ; four tastefully built in the Gothic style, namely, Trinity Church, on Mount Pleasant, St. John's, St. James's, and Christ Church on Mount Sion ; and the church of St. Paul, Rusthall, which was built by subscription, and consecrated in August, 1850. The Roman Catholics have a handsome chapel built of stone, in the Grosvenor road ; and there are seven places of worship for different de nominations of dissenters. AU the churches and chapels have their respec tive Sunday schools : besides which, the Victoria national schools, a female British school, and an infant school, furnish ample means of instruction for the poorer classes of the inhabitants. There are also religious and medical charities ; the poor, on the whole, being well cared for. There are literary societies, and a mechanics' institute. Good fishing may be obtained in the immediate neighbourhood of the Wells. The undulating character of the ground lends an additional charm, and the views from tbe several eminences are most beautiful. The old assembly-room on the Parade was pulled down some years ago, and houses erected on the ground. Butter, eggs, poultry and vegetables are brought into Tunbridge Wells daily from the adjacent villages ; also fruit during the season. The old theatre was con verted into the corn exchange about fifteen years ago. A public hall was erected in 1870, at a cost of \u00a313,000. Half a mile up the Frant-road, is a large estate, called Broadwater Down, com manding a most beautiful and extensive view. The commons of Rusthall and Tunbridge Wells are the property of the town. The town is well supplied both with water and gas. Few country towns, indeed, have a cleaner, neater, and more orderly appearance than the WeUs. As respects trade, it has none beyond that maintained by the wants of the district and neighbourhood. The only branch, too, of native industry which may be termed a manufacture, is the formation of boxes, spoons, domino-boards, and a variety of articles in wood of various colours, formed in mosaic, and famdiarly known as Tunbridge-ware. \" The Grove\" was presented to the town in the year 1703, by John, Earl of Buckingham. Queen Anne subsequently gave the Basin, named the Well of the Queen, or Queen'sWell. The same monarch gave the tiles for the pavement ofthe promenade, hence the word Pantiles. Richard Cum berland, the dramatist, resided at Gro ve House for nearly thirty years ; and at the end of his career the great states man, Lord North, came here to end his days. The precise period when the medicinal qualities of the mineral springs were discovered cannot be ascertained ; but they were, at any rate, greatly in vogue at the latter part of the seventeenth century. These springs, which occur in the beds of iron-sand, first rise north-west of the town in the obscure village of Speldhurst, and thence come down to the WeUs, surging up at the lowest part of the narrow valley in which the original village was built. In 1664 Lord Mus kerry surrounded the spring with a stone wall ; but this has since been wholly covered in by means of a handsome stone building. The water is a light, pure chalybeate, having a temperature of about 50\u00b0 Fahr. ; and its principal mineral ingredients are protoxide of iron, chloride of sodium, and sulphate of lime, in combination with carbonic acid gas. After all, however, the mineral constituents of these waters are very insignificant ; for Sir Charles Scudamore, who accurately analysed them, discovered little more than a third of a grain of the protoxide of iron, about a sixth of a grain of common salt, and a little more than a fifth of a grain of sulphate of lime, in a pint of water. However much, therefore, tliese waters may be valued for their virtues in cases of nervousness and dyspepsia, and however really beneficial they may be in female complaints, it is quite obvious that they have no claim to be compared for their active remedial qualities with those of Bath, Cheltenham, and Clifton. Its reputation stands, however, on quite independent grounds ; for the beauty of the scenery in and around the Wells, the remarkable salu brity of the air, and the agreeable society of the place, will ever continue to give it popularity, and make it not only a favourite summer resort, but an eUgible"], [150, "112 spot for permanent residence. In every direction around the Wells are agreeable walks and rides, furnishing most exten sive views of rural and forest scenery. Perhaps the most favourite ramble for pedestrians is across the Common, on w*hich are some curious rocks, known as the Sweeps' Rocks. At RusthaU Common may be seen another very extraordinary looking object, called the Toad Rock, which somewhat resembles in shape the Logan stones of Cornwall, and the form of which, it is evident, could only have beeu produced by natural causes. The High Rocks, likewise, about a mde and a half to the west of the Weds, are ex tremely well worth a visit : they range between forty and seventy feet in height, are composed of sandstone, and have several curious caverns near them, which seem to have been rent asunder by some convulsion of nature. There are also several extremely delightful walks across the fields to Frant Forest, HaU's Hole, Park Wood, <fcc. [Eight miles south of the Wells is Mayfield (see under that head), in Sussex, con taining the ruins of the Archiepiscopal Palace, which is said to have been built by St. Dunstan. Three miles from Mayfield is Heathfield (see under that head), once noted for its manufacture of cannon. A battle was fought here in 633 or 635 between CadwaUa, a prince of the royal blood of Wessex, and Edwin, king of Northumberland. Heathfield Park is built on an elevation of 600 feet above the level of the sea. Lamberhurst, eight miles from the Wells, is an interesting village. The church has a beautiful window in the west end, of the Perpendicular order. The pulpit, with the reading-desk, is of carved oak, and bears the date of 1630. A short distance from Lamberhurst are some vestiges of the once celebrated Gloucester Furnace, formerly the largest iron manufactory in Sussex, where the iron balustrade that encloses St. Paul's church-yard was cast. Two mdes and a haU east of Tunbridge Wells is Pem bury, the church of which was built in the reign of Edward III. On a very ancient stone in the pavement of the chancel is an inscription in Norman- French, which appears coeval with the above-mentioned reign. Several memo rials and monuments of the Amherst family are in this church ; also a brass, dated 1607, near the altar. Goudhurnt, twelve miles from the WeUs, contains a handsome church, enriched with several curious monuments to the Colepeper family of Bedgebury ; one in particular of Bethersden marble, on which are placed the recumbent figures of Sir Alexander Colepeper and his lady, carved in wood, habited in the costume of their times, the reign of Henry VIII.

UCKFIELD.\u2014 (STATION.) \u2014 A smad town, parish and urban sanitary district of the county of Sussex (eastern division) ; in Uckfield union and petty sessional division, and Lewes county court district. Holy Cross (the parish) church was originally built about the time of the Reformation, and partially rebuilt in 1840. Within the communion rails is a curious cross to John Fuller of Uckfield. The grammar school was founded in 1690 by Dr. Anthony Saunders. There is a handsome Con gregational church and several chapels, a public hall, temperance hall, (fee. The neighbourhood of Uckfield is dis tinguished for its picturesque scenery; and the lover of nature may find his taste amply gratified, whether he rambles towards the stately mansion of Buxted, or lose himself in the rich romantic grounds of Copwood.

' VENTNOR, ISLE OF WIGHT.\u2014 (STATION.) \u2014 Ventnor is a modern town, bathing place and parish (formed in 1866 out of that of Newchurch), and urban sanitary district, seated on the wooded and rocky declivities of the romantic Undercliff (also referred to under heads, Bonchurch, Sandown and ShankUn). The almost unexampled in- crease of the town of Ventnor, or rather formation of it, must be ascribed to the preference this part of the Isle of Wight is obtaining in the consideration of physicians as a residence for invalids, in lieu of the south of Devon, and other parts of the coast where the air is of a more humid description ; Ventnor being sheltered by downs of considerable alti- tude in every other direction, is scarcely open to any influence but the southern breezes, and consequently possesses a considerably higher temperature than any pait of England. The town is the crea- tion of a few years only, and therefore, although it possesses tbe usual modern appliances of the fashionable watering- place, exhibits little of interest, either in the style of its buildings or pubUc ap- pointments, to which particular attention can be directed. The extensive hotels occupy prominent positions among the array of lodging-houses which form the principal component part of the various streets ; interspersed, however, are several shops of almost metropolitan pre tensions, and the usual pubUc institutions and requirements. The pier, 500 feet long, was erected in 1874. A church, dedicated to St. Catherine, consecrated in the year 1838, presents a well designed elevation. Another church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, will be found here, and also a Roman Catholic church, au Independent chapel, a Congregational church, a Wesleyan Methodist chapel, a Methodist Free church, and a Primitive Methodist chapel. The Royal National Hospital for Consumption and Diseases of the Chest is at Undercliff, on a site nearly 20 acres in extent. It has accom- modation for more than 100 patients. The neighbourhood of Ventnor, devoid as it now is of many bright varieties of nature, which have passed away and become obliterated in the advance of the handiworks of man, is, however, still sufficiently rife with interest and scenic attraction to impress the mind of the stranger with a vivid idea of the pristine beauty of this romantic spot ; and it is evident that every endeavour is made by the persons interested in its prosperity to anticipate the requirements and wishes of the invalid and visitor \u2014 as on the shore bounding the declivity on which the town is placed, an esplanade has been recently constructed ; and in the im- mediate environs, by the formation of steps and pathways, every facility is devised to assist the stranger in his search after the picturesque. The castellated elevation to the west of Vent- nor is designated Steephill Castle. It was erected on tbe site of tho former cottage residence of the Earl of Dysart, and it must be admitted that the interest of the landscape is materially aided by the appearance of its miniature prospect tower and flag turret, at every point from which they are visible. With regard to the natural scenery of Ventnor and Bon- church, there is, perhaps, no part of the Undercliff better worth seeing than that in their immediate neighbourhood, as it is the proper beginning ofthe strik- ing rocky scenery, which extends in almost a continous line to Black Gang. Language is scarcely adequate to review the various aspects which present them- selves at every turn in the meandering highways of this singular district ; a scene of almost Alpine ruggedness, that can be described only as a range of per pendicular cUffs, at the foot of which the road runs, and from whence a series of slopes, in some places covered with wood"], [152, "114 and interspersed with enormous masses of fallen rocks, descend towards the sea ; but terminate in a high and precipitous bank of confused fragments of clay, rock, and chalk, the ruins of the original cliff, caused by a succession of landslips, and the unseen operations of nature. Such is the Undercliff, and such the scenery amid which the towu of Ventnor has been formed, and Bonchurch existed from a remote age ; whilst immediately behind the houses rises an immense hill, named St. Boniface, of a character totally different from the rugged district ad jacent, but still made beautiful by the contrast, which is not sufficiently exten sive to be displeasing.

WIMBLEDON.\u2014 (STATION.)\u2014 An ancient parish, township and urban sanitary district of the county of Surrey (mid division); in Kingston union, Wandsworth county court district, and petty sessional division. The village or township (Wimballs Dun) is on the high ground adjoining the Common, aud is surrounded by fine mansions. The church, with the exception of the chan- cel, was rebuilt in 1834, and contains some good monuments by Westmacott. On the south of the chancel is the Wim- bledon chapel, containing the black marble tomb of Lord Wimbledon, 1638. Calonne, the French financier, resided at Wimbledon, at the east side of the Common; the house in which be lived was sold by him to the Earl Gower- Sutherland; the present Wimbledon House was erected early in the present century, There are four district churches and several chapels. Wimbledon Park and its house is north of the church. Of this demesne Dyson's History says, \"In all the most ancient records, Wimbledon is described as a grange or farm, within the manor of Mortlake, which accounts for its being omitted in the survey of Domesday. Archbishop Cranmer, whose predecessors had been possessed of this manor from the time of the Conquest, exchanged it for other lands with King Henry VIII. That monarch soon after- wards granted it to Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex ; after his attainder it was settled upon Queen Catherine Parr for her life. Queen Mary granted it to Cardinal Pole ; her successor, Elizabeth, first gave it to Sir Christopher Hatton ; and again, in the thirty-second year of her reign, to Sir Thomas Cecil, after- wards Earl of Exeter, in exchange for an estate in Lincolnshire. His father, Lord Burleigh, had a grant of lands at Wimbledon in the reign of Edward VI. ; and it appears from the date of some of his letters, that he resided there wheu he was Sir Widiam Cecil, and Secretary of State. It is probable, not- withstanding the grant was made in his son's name, that he lived occasionally at the manor-house; in the year 1599 he entertained Queen Elizabeth at his house at Wimbledon for three days. The Earl of Exeter left this estate to his third son, Sir Edward Cecil, who was created a peer, with the title us Viscount Wimbledon and Baron Putney. Imme- diately after his decease, which happened in 1638, the manor was sold by his heirs to Henry, Earl of Holland, and others, trustees for Queen Henrietta Maria. The mansion at Wimbledon is mentioned among the houses belonging to the Crown in the inventor)* of Charles I.'s jewels and pictures. It is worthy of remark, that this unfortunate monarch was so little aware of the fate preparing for him by his enemies, that a sev/ days before be was brought to trial, he ordered the seeds of some Spanish melons to be planted in his garden at Wimbledon.\" When the crown lands were put up to sale, this manor was bought by Adam Baynes, Esq., of Knowstrop, in the county of York, at eighteen years' pur- chase. It is probable that it was sold by him to General Lambert, who was lord of the manor in the year 1656. \" Lam- bert,\" says Coke, the author of a book called \" The Detection,\" \"after he had been discarded by Cromwell, betook himself to Wimbledon House, where he turned florist, and had the finest tulips and gilliflowers that could be got for love or money : yet, in these outward pleasures he nourished the ambition which he entertained before he was cashiered by Cromwell.\" General Lam bert was not only a cultivator of flowers, but exceded in painting them. Some specimens of his skill in that art re mained for many years at Wimbledon. After the return of Charles IL, this manor was restored to the queen, of whom it was purchased, in the year 1661,"], [154, "116 by the Earl of Bedford and others, as trustees for George Digby, Earl of Bris tol, and his heirs. His lordship's widow sold it to Thomas Earl of Danby, the Lord Treasurer, who was afterwards created Duke of Leeds. The duke, by his will, bearing date January 21, 1711, left this estate intrust to Montagu, Earl of Abingdon, and others ; in the year 1717 the trustees sold it under a decree of Chancery to Sir Theodore Janssen, Bart., who, becoming deeply involved in the unfortunate South Sea adventure, it was again put up to sale, and purchased by Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, for \u00a315,000. Her grace gave it to her grand son, John Spencer, Esq., grandfather of the Right Honourable George John Earl Spencer, in whose descendants it still continues. The manor - house, whose splendour was noted throughout Eng land, was rebudt by Sir Thomas Cecil, in 1558. Fuller calls Wimbledon House a \" daring structure,\" implying thereby, the ambitious character of its architec ture : it was quite a palace, emulating royal state. The architecture was that of the time of James I. : the man sion consisted of a centre, with two pavdions, and wings ; approached by a succession of terrace steps, from the de clivity of the hill upon which it was erected. In a survey of the gardens, taken in 1619, the orangery was said to have contained forty-two orange trees in boxes, valued at ten pounds each ; one lemon tree, bearing great and very fine lemons, valued at twenty pounds ; one pomecitron tree, valued at ten pounds ; three great and fair fig trees, the branches whereof, by the spreading and dilating of themselves in a very large proportion, but yet in a most decent manner, covered a very great part of the walls of the south side of the manor house. In the several gardens, which consisted of mazes, wddernesses, knots, alleys, (fee, are mentioned in the survey a great variety of fruit-trees and shrubs, particularly a fair bay-tree, \"and one very fayre tree called the Irish arbutis, very lovely to looke upon, and valued at thirty shillings.\" Above a thousand fruit-trees are mentioned, of which are every kind now cultivated, except the nectarine. Mention is also made of a *\" musk milion (melon) ground, at the end of the kitchen-garden, trenched, manured, and very well ordered for the growth of musk mdions.\" The old mansion was removed in the early part of the last century, and a new one erected ; this was, in 1785, destroyed by fire. The present structure was finished in 1800. The park has, however, been cut up into plots for villa residences. The visitor at this beautdul breezy spot must not forget to visit the entrench ment in the south-west corner of the common, known as C\u00e6sar's camp, from which there is a beautiful view looking towards Coombe. A large group of bar rows formerly existed on the common, which have disappeared. \" Camden says that in his time this camp was called Bensbury, and is of opinion that this spot, or the immediate neighbourhood, was the site of a battle between Ceaulin, king of the West Saxons, and Ethel bert, king of Kent, in which the latter was defeated ; and which is said to have been fought in the year 568, at a place called Wibandune, whenco, it may be, we have by euphony, Wimbledon. In this battle two of Ethelbert's generals, Oslac and Cnebba, were said to have been slain. No mention is made of meaner victims to the hostility of the rival monarchs of Kent and the West Saxons ; yet, if Oslac and Cnebba had been drummer-boys, cut off in the re treat, their insignificancy, in the eyes of posterity, could not have been greater.\" From the camp there is a pleasant walk to Richmond Park entering by Robin Hood Gate. On Wimbledon Common, which consists of about 1,000 acres, the National Rifle Association holds ita meetings annually in the month of July for twelve days ; valuable prizes are given to the best shots. There are several shooting butts on the common. Considerable alterations have been made by the Association in the system of tar gets and marking, involving the con struction of trenches and mantelets of solid brickwork, with underground com munication from butt to butt. The common was once noted as a favourite meeting place for duellists. Area of Parish : 3,173 acres of land and 47 of water. Population : 9,100.

There are two dis trict churches, and several chapels. The town is sheltered on the land side by the chalk downs, and has a long range of smooth sands, extending four miles to the east and nine to the west, having a breadth of nearly half a mile at low water; the firmness of the sands affords safe bathing. The town has some good streets. Several estates, called respectively Farncombe, College, Selden, Homefield, Chesswood, and Alex andra, are built upon, and the place is increasing rapidly. The Esplanade is an imposing and pleasant promenade. The pier, 960 feet long, was opened in 1862. The Steyne is a garden-like space of about three acres in extent. There are the usual public institutions and buildings of a town of its dimensions. Cissbury Hill, about three miles to the north of the town, rises to a consider able height. On the summit are the re mains of an extensive oval British camp, or something, covering about 60 acres, and surrounded by a single fosse, from eight to ten feet deep, and a broad vallum, both remaining weU defined. The view extends from Selsey Bill on the west to Beachy Head on the east.

This place was anciently called Eremuth (or Tar Mouth, from its situation at the mouth of the river Yar), and was once a place of much greater importance than it now is. It was destroyed by the French in the reign of Richard II. In 1135 Baldwin de Redvers, then lord of the manor, gave the inhabitants a charter, which was confirmed by subsequent sovereigns. That of James I. is the governing one : it constitutes a common council of twelve chief burgesses, from whom the mayor is to be chosen. The free or general burgesses are to be selected by the chief burgesses, who also fill up vacancies in their own ranks. The borough, which never enjoyed a separate criminal or civil jurisdiction, was disfranchised by the Reform Act of 1832. The observ ance of its municipal functions is very unfrequent and inextensive, and, in fact, have almost whoUy ceased. The corpo rate revenue, derived from harbour tolls, dues, (fee, is about \u00a3400 per annum. The town is pleasantly situated on the shores of the Solent Sea.

The foreign trade of Dieppe, though much below that of Havre, is still considerable, and its port is much fre- quented by coasters. Dieppe was the chief of the ancient ports of France, and its inhabitants the most enterprising in foreign trade. It was bombarded, and much damaged, by the English and Dutch combined fleet in 1694. It was in a decayed state during the wars of the revolution and empire, and owes much to the Duchess de Berri, who first made it fashionable as a bathing- place. The Maison Quenouille, where she resided, is still standing. The town was occupied by the Germans in Decem- ber, 1870, for the purpose of obtaining supplies. Population: About 20,000.

EVREUX. -This place, which was known to the Romans as \" Civitis Ebur- ovicum,\" is an ancient city, and the capi- tal of the department Eure. It is situated in a fertile valley on the Iton, which, branching out, divides the city into three parts. The city is on the line from Mantes to Cherbourg. It is well built, but the streets are rather narrow. The cathedral is a venerable pile, founded in the seventh century, and in several styles of Gothic architecture, richly sculptured both in the interior and on the DIEPPE. \u2014 This town is in the de partment Seine - Inferieure, on the Knglish Channel, in a hollow between cbalk hills, at the embouchure of the Arques. The houses, in general not lofty, are built of brick, many having balconies, and roofed with tiles ; the streets are tolerably wide and regular. The Grand Rue, above one mile in length, runs parallel with the sea from the harbour to the castle, and has some good shops. The part of it next the port has the best private buildings and hotels. The general appearance of the whole place is superior, when compared with most other French maritime towns, but almost the only public edifices worth special notice are the two Gothic churches, St. Jacques and St. Remi. The former was begun in the thirteenth century, and is a fine building. St. Remi, founded in 1522, is budt in the mixed Gotho-Saracenic. The air of the place is pure, and water abundant ; the latter is brought to the town by an aqueduct, three miles long, cut in the solid rock, which supplies sixty-eight public, and numerous private, fountains. To the west of Dieppe is the suburb La Barre, and on the opposite side of the harbour La PoUet, which communicates with it by a stone bridge of seven arches, and is inhabited chiefly by sailors and fishermen. The port is spacious, and the depth of water in the basin sufficient for vessels of 1,200 tons burden ; but the entry to it is difficult. It is formed by two jetties with several quays, faced with masonry, and is defended by an old castle and modern citadel. On the west jetty is a Ughthouse thirty-nine feet high. Dieppe is the chief watering place of France, and is much frequented by visitors in summer, but still more towards autumn, during the recess of the Legislature, and vacation of the colleges and Government offices at Paris. The great bathing establishment, recon structed in 1857, forms a luxurious re-"], [157, "119 exterior, and with a bold spire 255 feet high. The church and cloisters of the abbey of St. Thaurin, another fine Gothic edifice, were founded in the seventh cen tury. The Tour de l'Horloge is a lofty aud handsome clock-tower, built in 1417. The Hotel de Ville was once the palace of the Dukes of Boudlon. Evreux has a town library of 10,000 volumes, a botanic garden, and a theatre ; an agri cultural association and a literary society. It is the seat of a court of first resort ; a prefect ; a bishop suffragan of the arch diocese of Rouen ; a chamber and tribunal of commerce, council of prud'hommes ; two theological seminaries ; a commercial college, and a normal primary head school. Evreux has manufactures of bed-ticking aud hosiery, tanneries, bleacheries, dyeworks ; od, fuldng, saw, and flatting mills ; some limekilns and tilefields ; a trade in grains, seeds, and timber; with an important fair for horses and cattle. It was sacked by the Normans in 892 ; taken and pillaged in 1119 by Henry I. of England. The English were finaUy expelled from it in 1441. Population : About 13,000. Prin cipal Hotels : Du Grand Cerf ; De Paris. GAILLON. \u2014 A small commune of and well-cleaned streets, which intersect each other at right angles. The prin cipal street is the Rue de Paris, which presents great commercial activity. The new city was in great measure built by Francis I. ; in his reign the harbours were improved, and the town-hall and the ramparts erected. Under Louis XIV. the extent of the town was nearly doubled ; part of the fortifications were demolished, a new quarter budt, and the citadel converted into an immense mili tary quarter, which comprises an arsenal, governor's residence, ammunition stores, and large barracks, forming together a spacious and handsome square round the Place d'Armes. The public buddings are not numerous, and possess little interest. They include the church of Notre-Dame, partly Gothic; the church of St. Francis ; the townhouse, formerly the governor's palace ; the round tower of Francis I., the only relic of fortifica tions built by that monarch ; the theatre, arsenal, exchange, library, and barracks. The manufactures consist of sulphuric acid, earthen and stone ware, paper, starch, lace, oil, refined sugar, cables, and other marine cordage. There are also breweries and numerous brick and tile works. A government tobacco fac tory employs 300 workmen, and from the building yards a great number both of sailing vessels and steamers, celebrated for the beauty of their make and sailing properties, are annually fitted out. But the great dependence of Havre is on its commerce, for which it possesses unusual advantages, both in its harbour and in its position. Its harbour, which is said to be one of the most accessible in Fiance, is entered by a narrow channel, formed by two long jetties, stretching from east to west, and kept clear by constant dredging. This channel leads to the outer harbour (avant port), an irregular expanse of uo great extent, which is left dry at ebb tide, and is occupied by great numbers of coasters, and other small vessels, which can safely touch the ground. Within the avant port are capacious wet docks, four in number, capable of floating and accom- modating about 300 large vessels, and Uned with fine quays and extensive warehouses. The harbour is accessible by large vessels only during four hours of each tide, a disadvantage counter- the department Eure, long noted for its castle belonging to the Archbishops of Rouen. The site is now occupied by a prison, built in 1262, afterwards burnt by the EngUsh in the course of their in vasions, restored by Cardinal d'Amboise, aud finally ruined at the Revolution. The gate of the Chateau is now at the Palais des Beaux Arts in Paris. A por tion of the park \u2014 with beautiful scenery \u2014 still exists. HAVRE. \u2014 This important maritime town was formerly known as Lc Havre de-Grace. It is in the department Seine- Inferieure, on the north bank of the estuary of the Seine, 108 miles north west of Paris. It is lined by a triple range of ditches, supplied with water from the sea; and is surrounded by ramparts and lofty walls, crowned by a parapet, and adorned by a fine planted aUey. The fortifications are, however, commanded by adjoining heights. Havre is entered by five gates. The town, which, with the exception of a number of old wooden houses, is of comparatively modern date, is built of brick or stone, with great regularity, in straight, wide,"], [158, "120 able only for their antiquity and some peculiarities of structure ; and has manu factures of lace, ship-biscuits, casks, and mineral aciris ; rope-works, tanneries, building yards, and a harbour accessible only at high water. The trade, once important, has been almost destroyed by the rise of Havre. The chief exports are corn, cider, salt, provisions, dairy and other produce. Large quantities of eggs, fruit, and vegetables are exported to England. On the hill above the town is the chapel of Notre Dame do Grace, much frequented by sailors, and filled with their votive offerings. Honfieur was long in possession of the English, and makes a considerable figure in their Freuch wars. Sir Sydney Smith was taken prisoner here in 1796, while towing off a vessel which he had captured. Population : About 10,000. Principal Hotels: Du Cheval Blanc; Des Armes de France ; De la Paix. balanced by the fact that the tides at Havre continue at their maximum for three hours. Havre thus commands the greater part of import and export trade of Paris, and of the more important towns in the north of France ; importing vast quantities of colonial and other produce, among which cotton holds a most important place ; and exporting numerous articles of French manufac ture \u2014 particularly silks, cottons, iron ware, plate, mirrors, furniture, stained paper, bricks and tiles, provisions, tools, philosophical instruments, and agricul tural implements ; also wine, liqueurs, flour, (fee Havre is the second port in France, being exceeded only by Mar seilles. Havre is the seat of a court of first resort, and of commerce, and possesses a chamber of commerce, and a hydrographical school of the first class. Its history is not of much interest. The earliest notice of it dates from the fif teenth century, when it became of im portance to form a new harbour, in consequence of the silting-up of that of Harfleur. The project was conceived and some progress made in it by Louis XII., but it continued little more than a fishing village tdl the time of Francis I., who conferred important privileges upon it, erected numerous works, and, at immense expense, gained the greater part of the present site of the town from the sea, whieh has, however, repeatedly threatened to resume possession, and caused great disaster. A citadel was afterwards built, and Havre, being now regarded as a place of strength, became the object of repeated contests between the French and the English. The old fortifications have been replaced by others, due chiefly to the first Napoleon. Population : About, 75,000. Principal Hotels: D'Angleterre ; Del'Europe; Du Louvre; De Norman die ; and Grand. HONFLEUR.\u2014 This town is in the department Calvados, and agreeably situated on the estuary of the Seine, seven miles south-east of Havre. It is a poorly budt place, but considerable improve ments have recently been made, and the entrance of the port protected by two long stone jetties. It is the seat of a court of first resort, possesses an ex change, and a hydrographical school of the fourth class ; contains several churches and pubUc buildings, remark- LONGUEVILLE\u2014 This place is in the department Seine-lnferieure, and has some very interesting objects. The station stands on the site of an old abbey. At a short distance from it are the ruins of the castle of Arques, which overlook the battlefield where Henry IV. gained such a decided victory over the Leaguers, uuder the Duke of Mayence, in 1589. It dates from the eleventh century. The Duchesse de Longueville (Conde's sister) lived here. The church possesses many features worth attention. LOUVIERS.\u2014 The ancient name of this place was Luparial. It is in the department of the Eure, and on both sides of the river of the same name, 17 miles south of Rouen. The old town is almost entirely built of wood ; the new town is budt of brick or hewn stone, and has a long street, which leads to the high road, and crosses the different branches of the Eure by three bridges. It has an in teresting chur ch,supposed to date from the period of the first Crusade ; courts of first resort and commerce ; and a consulting chamber of manufactures. Louviers ranks with Elboeuf and Sedan as one of the three principal clothing towns of France. It has more than forty cloth factories, employing a large number of persons, in and arouud the town ; several worsted mills, an extensive weaving and card factory, tanneries, bleachfields, dye works, and a factory for spinning"], [159, "121 machinery and steam engines. The chief trade is in broadcloth, of which about one-third of the quantity made is exported to foreign countries, chiefly Piedmont and Italy. Tho other articles of trade are corn, wood, charcoal, flax, (fee. Population .* About 12,000. MANTES\u2014 This town, anciently called Medunta, is in the department Seine-et-Oise, and on the left bank of the Seine, opposite to Limay, with which it communicates by two handsome bridges, connecting the banks with an island iu the river. It contains a fine Gothic church, with two lofty towers, which make a conspicuous appearance ai_ a great distance ; a beautiful Gothic tower, the only remains of the ancient church of St. Maclou : a public library, and a secondary ecclesiastical school ; and has manufactures of leather aud saltpetre, famous breweries, numerous mdls, and a trade in leather, corn, and wine. Population : About 6,000. PARIS. \u2014 A guide to tho great city, whose proud boast it is to be \" the heart of the world,\" is not within the scope of this work, which deals pro fessedly and almost exclusively with the places en route to and from London. Some valuable suggestions to travellers and visitors will, however, be found in the Introduction (page xix.), and a list of those public buildings, (fee, which are only open to public inspection at stated hours is here appended. The Western of France Railway, by which patrons of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway route are conveyed to Paris, ha3 its terminus at the gave (or station) of St. Lazare, which faces the Rue St. Lazare not far from tho Madeleine Church. It is the nearest railway station to the principal official buildings, and includes a grand hall, the salles de depart, and the salles d'arr'n-e'e, with covered ac commodation for the vehicles in waiting. The general aspect of Paris never fads to secure the admiration of strangers. Considerably enlarged by tho line of fortifications with which it has been surrounded, it extends on both banks of the Seine over a length of eight miles; circumference, twenty-two. This space isdivided into two distinct portions : first, that comprised within the old city wall, erected for the collection of the octroi or customs; and secondly, the banlieue, comprised between the old wall and the line of tbe new fortifications. The first part, which form3 the twelve municipal arrondissements of Paris, is, in many parts, covered with splendid monument., magnificent hotels and gardens. The houses are generally lofty aud built in uniform style. Tho new streets are wide, straight, well paved, and lighted with gas and by electricity, but many of the old streets are narrow and crooked. The Seine, as observed, traverses Paris from east to west, and within the limits of the city it is crossed by twenty-three bri I ges, and receives tho small stream of Bievre or the Gobelins, and the canal of St. Martin, which joins those of the Ourcq and St. Denis. It here forms two inlands, the lie St. Louis and the lie de la Cite, onwhich last the cathedral of Notre Dame is situated, the Hotel Dieu, the Pklace of Justice, (fee Tho portion of the capital seated on the right bank of the river is the most extensive, and contains the greatest number of public offices ; the centre is occupied by the Bourse or Ex change. In this quarter are the Louvre, ruius of the Tuileries, the Elysee Napo leon, Hotel de Ville (rebuilding), the National Opera House, Madeleine, (fee Its principal streets and squares are the place de la Concorde, place de 1'Opera, rue de 1' Opera, place Vendd.'ue, rue de Rivoli, rue do la Paix, rue CastigUoue. Most of theso are in the centro or west of Paris. The chief objects in the east are the Halle au Bl(5 , Fontaine des Inno cens, and the column of July. The finest and most fashionable promenades are the boulevards aud the Champs Elysees, at the west end of which is tho triumphal arch of l'Etoile and the Bois de Boulogne, at the other end the place du Carrousel and garden of the Tuileries; and in the east, the cemetery of Pere la Chaise. The left bank of the river contains the Fauborg St. Germain, the principal residence of the old noblesse. On this side is the Pays Latin, the seat of the principal educational establish ments, as the Sorbonne, College of France, and Colleges of St. Louis, Louis le-Grand, Henry the Fourth, Polytechnic School, Normal School, School of Medi cine, and Schools of Law. The principal public buildings an this side are the Luxembourg Palace, Palace of the Fine Arts, the Odoon, Palace of the Legisla- 10"], [160, "122 tion, Palace of the Institute, the Mint, the Pantheon, Hotel des lnvalides, Military School, Jardin des Plantes, and the Gobelins. This qi arter also contains the greatest number of hospitals, the largest of which is the Salpetriere. Here are also the ruins of the Palace des Thermes, H'*tel Cluny, the abattoirs of Grenelle and Villejuif, and the Artesian well. The space contained between the city walls and the fortified circle is com posed of the communes of the banlieue, comprising, on the right bank, Bercy, Charonne, Belleville, La Villette, La Chapelle, Montmartre, Les Batignolles, Passy, and Auteuil ; and on the left bank, Grenelle, Vaugirard, Montrouge, and Gentilly. The approach to the new walls is defended by thirteen detached forts, viz., Romainville, Noisy, Rosny, Nogent, Charenton, and the Castle of Vincennes, on the east ; Bicetre, Mont rouge, Vanvres, Issy, on the south ; on the west, Mont Valerien ; and on the north, Aubervilliers and St. Denis, with the Couronne de ia Briche and double Couronne.

[Four miles north of Paris is St. Denis, a Bmall town in the department of the Seine. It is situated in a fertile plain on the Crou, near the right bank of the Seine, and of the canal of the same name, which connects the canal of Ourcq with the Seine. It is weU built, and has handsome barracks, an asylum for the houseless poor, a smaU theatre, a public Ubrary ; it has also several bleacheries. cotton-spinning mills, tanneries, corn mills, &c. ; and an active trade in flour, wine, vinegar, wood, and wool. Fairs are held four times a year. The origin of one of these \u2014 distinguished by the name of Londit \u2014 is dated as far back as the seventh century. It is one of the most important sheep fairs in France, the average sale of sheep exceeding annually 100,000. St. Denis was origin ally a small viUage, named Catolacum. A chapel, which was erected here in the third century over the tomb of St. Denis the Martyr, became the nucleus of the subsequent church. The present mag nificent cathedral and royal mausoleum is one of the crowning glories of France, and has rendered the name of St. Denis renowned throughout the world. The cathedral was originally founded in the twelfth or thirteenth century by King Dagobert, in connection with the cele brated Benedictine Abbey of St. Denis, and formed the ordinary place of sepul ture of tbe royal family of France and of other illustrious personages. By decree of the Convention in 1793, tbe royal tombs were destroyed, aud the valuable relics and other treasures of the Abbey, including the crown and sword of Charlemagne, the sword of Joan of Arc, the great cross, (fee, carried away. The buddings of the Abbey ate now used as an establishment for the education of daughters of the members of the Legion of Honour. The exterior of St. Denis is much surpassed by that of Notre Dame, Rheims, and Amiens. Restorations have been going on here for many centuries, at different epochs and under several dynasties. The crypt, which contains the tombs of the kings of France, is quite a museum of sculpture. The interior, perhaps, exceeds that of Notre Dame. The style of the architecture is a kind of Lombard-Gothic. Felibien, in his \" Lives of Celebrated Architects,\" says that Abbot Suger ought to be considered as one of the most intelligent men who lived in the twelfth century. He re- sunset. to 4."], [161, "123 paired and enlarged St. Denis, took upon I himself the principal sharo of the work ; _>egan it towards the year 1140, and ; finished it in less than ten years with an | extraordinary magnificence, as may be ' learned from his own description. Some : of the side-chapels, the shrines of the ancient kings of France,areverysplendid, ! from the rich colours that cover the ! walls, from the sparkling dyes of the : windows, the golden ribs and bosses of j the groining, which is starred on a blue ground. It is unquestionably one of the *\" sights \" of France. Estimated Popu lation .- 10,000.] POISSY.\u2014 This place is in the de partment Seine-et-Oise, and was once a eountry seat of the early kings of France. It has a high-roofed Gothic church, with buttresses and two slender spires, contain- ing thefont in which Louis IX., or Louis <le Poissy (from being born here) was baptised, and the tomb of Phdippe, his \"brother. Another church, founded by his son, Philippe le Hardi, 1314 (de stroyed 1793), belonged to the Ursuline abbey, where the famous Conference was held, 1561, between the Catholics and Protestants ; Beza and Peter Martyr at- tending, on the part of the latter ; but which led to no result except the massacre of St. Bartholomew. There are also from the hdl of St. Catherine on the south-east, whence it is seen to the greatest advantage, no provincial town in France presents a. more magnificent and venerable aspect. The streets, though long and tolerably straight, are narrow and dark, and the houses, for the most part of wood, and often faced with slate, are poorly built, and lofty and crowded. Many of these houses, however, are inter esting from their antiquity ; and on the west side of the city, which is of more modern construction, there are several handsome streets with elegant mansions of stone. To these must be added the rows of houses along the magnificent quays, by which the banks of the river are lined. Among the public edifices, the first place is due to the cathedral, a vast and im posing structure, gradually completed during a succession of centuries, and hence varying much both in the style and merits of its architecture, but stiU one of the most splendid churches of which France can boast. Its west front, forming one side of the fruit and flower market, is flanked by two lofty towers in different styles of architecture, and is so thickly ornamented with images and sculptures as almost to resemble a piece of rock-work. The interior is 435 feet long, 104 feet broad, and 89i feet high. It is in the early Pointed style, and has three remarkably fine rose-windows in the nave and transepts. The choir bas ex quisitely carved stalls, and some beautiful painted glass, and on its pavement are small lozenge-shaped tablets of marble, marking the spots where the heart of Richard C\u0153ur de Lion, and the bodies of his brother Henry, his uncle Geoflroy Plantagenet, and John Duke of Bedford, regent of Normandy, were interred. The other edifices most deserving of notice, are the archbishop's palace, im- mediately adjoining the cathedral. The abbey church of St. Ouen, regarded as one of the most perfect Gothic edifices in the world, the central tower (285 feet high), completed in the 15th century, is remarkable for its grace and elegance. The church was founded in 1318, and the choir and transepts completed by 1339; but the nave was not finished until the 15th century. The western towers have been added within a few years. The interior (445 feet iu length, 110 feet in height) is striking for its an old hospital, and a central house of detention, on the abbey site. Tbe Popu lation is about 5,000. PONT DE L'ARCHE. \u2014 A pretty little viUage of the department Eure. It was fortified in 854 by Charles the Bold. The church contains some ancieut stained glass. A large forest adjoins tbe village. ROUEN. \u2014 This important city \u2014 the Rotomagus of the Romans when they were possessed of Gaul \u2014 is the capital of the department Seine- Inf^rieure, and agreeably situated ou the river Seine. It stands in a valley on a gentle acclivity facing the south, and in shape is an irregular oval, the contour of which is marked out by the site of the old ram parts, which have been levelled down, and converted into finely-planted boule vards. In addition to the town proper, which stands on the right bank of the river, there are several suburbs. Of these, that of St. Sever on the left bank iB the most extensive. When viewed from the adjoining heights, particularly"], [162, "124 see of an archbishop, the seats of courts of primary jurisdiction aud commerce, and of a court of appeal for tho depart ments of Seine-Infiirieure and Eure. tt possesses a chamber of commerce anas exchange, conseil de prud'hommes, mint, agricultural society, college, university,' academy, diocesan seminary, third class school of hydrography, academy of science and art, a school of painting, sculpture and architecture.

Pcil Sizb of 4_ Inch Pb_t. An Entirely New Instrument for Writing, For the Desk or Pocket, combining the Convenience of the Lead Pencil and the Permanency of Pen and Ink. An Air-tight Fountain Ink Pencil, With which Common Writing Ink oan be used, and holding sufficient quantity for several days' General Writing. IS NEAT and clean. IT IS a luxury to write with it, Can be carried in the Pocket, ALWAYS READY FOR USE. \u2666 THE STYLOGRAPHIC PEN (extensively used in the United States of America) supplied the want long felt for an Ink-Writing- Instrument that may be used with the facility of a lead pencil, on all kinds of paper, and for all memorandum, manuscript, letter writing, Ac, and in fact for all general writing where a lead pencil or pen is now ordinarily used. It is constructed upon an entirely new and scientific principle, and writes without shading, always producing the same breadth of line, whether the hand is carried lightly or with pressure, mere contact with the paper being all that is necessary. The Pen will write at a single filling from 15,000 to 20,000 words. WHERE SPEED AND LEGIBILITY ARE DESIRED: it is far preferable to the ordinary pen, as the necessity of continually dipping for more ink is obviated and the smoothness and shape of the point admit of a free passage over the paper, leaving a clear uniform line. AS AH OFFICE RULING PEN it surpasses every other form for that purpose. FOR A POCKET PEN, the perfect state of completeness is arrived at, as the pen filled with ink can be made perfectly air-tight and instantly ready for use. THE PEN WILL BE FOUND PARTICULARLY VALUABLE to all professional or business men, and an essential and lasting instrument for every person much occupied in writing. Every Pen is made under the direct supervision of the patentee, of the best materials, and in the most thorough manner; thus seeming the most perfect instrument that skilled workmanship can produce. Nothing but non-corrosive materials (vulcanized rubber, gold, silver, iridium, and platinum) are used in its manufacture. The writing- point is made of iridium alloyed with platinum, and for ordinary use will last many years \u2014 the iridium being the same metal as is used in pointing gold pens. ENGINEERS AND ARCHITECTS will find this Pen invaluable NO DRYING OR EVAPORATION can take place at the point. When the Pen is carried in the Pocket, or not in use, the point is protected with an air-tight cap. THE STYLOGRAPHIC PENS ARE MADE IN TWO SIZES: 6 inches lon- nnd 4* inches long.
