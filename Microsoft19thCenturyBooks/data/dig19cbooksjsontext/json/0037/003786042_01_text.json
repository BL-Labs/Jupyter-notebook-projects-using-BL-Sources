The stream of invention, which Avas at the commencement of its course placid and gentle, having, year by year, acquired new strength, is now roUing along a mighty torrent, sweeping away through its headlong speed every vestige of the good old times. And whilst some men are looking upon it with admiration and triumph; others, struck with awe, ask \u2014 \" When is it to cease ? and what is to be the end?\" It is our intention to foUow from its source one of the streams that fed this torrent. Then, indeed, we shaU exclaim with the now timorous gazers, \" Where are the boundaries that can re strain this flood, Avhich is ever and anon becomnig more irresistible and turbid?\" The cottages scattered over the hUl sides of the moory districts of Lancashire B 2"], [12, "4 THE VICISSITUDES are generally built of smaU flat stones, with a porch of the same material over the door. Most of them have only two rooms on the ground floor, one occupied by the loom, if any of the inmates are weavers, in the other the family live. In one of these cottages resided WiUiam Morland. His employment was weaving, and, being steady and industrious, his earnings Avere sufficient to satisfy his few wants. He was a taU, large-boned man, about thirty years of age. His wife was a few years younger than himself, rather below the middle height, and of a deUcate complexion; they had two chUdren \u2014 a boy and girl \u2014 the former five years old, the latter three. The evening of the 4th of August, 1767, on which our story commences, was one of unclouded beauty. The cottage door was open to admit a gentle breeze so light, indeed, as scarcely to agitate the heath on the hill side. Betty Morland having placed her spinning-wheel in the"], [13, "5 OE COMMERCE. porch, was seated upon a low stool, and busily employed at her work, which she accompanied with a pleasing though un tutored voice. So thoroughly had her attention been engaged, that she aUowed to pass unnoticed the unusually prolonged absence of her husband. He had left early in the morning to go his accustomed round for the purpose of coUecting weft from the wives and daughters of the cot tagers in the neighbourhood, and had not yet returned. But when the shades of evening put an end to her labours, she sat Ustening to catch the sound of his approaching footsteps. He entered the porch, however, before she perceived him, having come over the moor. After di vesting himself of his waUet, which ap peared better filled than usual, he took up his little boy, and kissing him, said, \" Thou'l be a gentleman yet, Harry.\" \" An' what's that, daddy ?\" said the little feUow. Morland smiled. \" It 's a long story I"], [14, "6 THE VICISSITUDES ha' to tell thee, Betty ; but tha mun not let a cheep on it ate to nobody. Tha'U not need turn that wheel o' thine again ; no, not as long as't lives.\" Betty thought he was not in his proper senses ; however, without saying a word, she drew the table near the fire, put a loaf of coarse brown bread, together with a bowl of mUk, upon it, threw a piece of bog-timber on the turf fire, and sat down near him with an air of a woman whose curiosity having been raised, is deter mined to have it gratified. The substance of Morland's story was this: \u2014 after calling at a number of cot tages on the lane side, and receiring what little weft the houseAviA'es had spun, he was returning home when he thought Jenny Hargreaves would probably have some by her. The distance was four mUes across the moor; but Will thought little about that, for he was anxious to have his piece of cloth woven by the end of the folloAring week. Hargreaves lived in a larger and more"], [15, "7 OF COMMERCE. commodious house than Morland's, and attached to it were a few acres of re claimed land, and a small garden, in which the cottagers' favourite plants \u2014 the pink and southernAvood \u2014 Avere the principal occupants of the beds. Morland found Hargreaves and his Avife at home; and after chatting some time he showed them his almost empty AvaUet, asking Jenny if she could fiU it for him. On hearing this Hargreaves' coun- tenance fell; and jumping up he took hold of WiU's arm, exclaiming, in accents that told the bitterness of his feelings, \" has hoo toud thee then? I thout hood blab it ate;\" and after some angry comments on female incapacity for keeping secrets, Avent out of the house. Morland foUowed him to learn the reason of this strange con- duct; Hargreaves beckoned him to the cow-house, and going into one of the staUs removed some loose rushes from a wooden frame, saying, as he did so, \" Theyer, that's what thu coom fort' see.\" He was intending to say something"], [16, "8 THE VICISSITUDES more, when Will interrupted him; pro testing that he had never heard of the frame from any one ; nor could he ima gine what it was intended for. Har greaves knew, by his honest frank manner, that he was teUing the truth, and looking him full in the face, said, \" Conta houd a sacrit.\" This intense excitement, which had made him as pale as death, coupled with the strange language he had used, so thoroughly roused his friend's curiosity that he promised whatever his companion chose to relate should be kept silent. They sat down on the rushes, and Har greaves commenced his story by remind ing Morland, that four years previously Aveaving had been very brisk. The cloth came in sadly too slow for the merchant ; and the manufacturers were constantly urging the weavers to do more work. But this Avas impossible, as their looms were continually stopping for weft, though the spinsters worked from morning till night : and the busy hum of the spinster's wheel could be heard in every cottage."], [17, "9 OF COMMERCE. He would sit for hours, he said, watch ing his wife Jenny at her spinning-wheel, until one day a thought struck him, he asked himself, \" Could not a plan be devised for spinning four or eight threads at the same time?\" Such an idea having once entered a mind like Har greaves' was not to be banished from it because there was no precedent to work upon. Every spare moment was now spent in scheming: numberless experi ments were made which aU ended in vexatious disappointments. His family were reduced to poverty through his weaving being neglected; Jenny conti nuaUy complained of his folly, and he was upon the point of giving up his project in despair, when one of his ex periments succeeded; and he had just completed the machine Avhich, in a mo ment of passion, had been shown to Mor land ; and without whose secrecy it was not likely to prove very useful to either of them. b3"], [18, "10 THE VICISSITUDES It has been asserted that the cotton trade of this country, so far from having in the whole of its history an incident approaching to the romantic, is the very opposite of everything pleasing ; and that the Avords themselves suggest to the mind nothing but what is vulgar and common place. This assertion has been so con stantly made that almost every one is inclined to admit it as an axiom. Let us, however, examine the picture now be fore us, and we shaU discover that they who have thus judged, haAre judged hastily. In a smaU shed on one of the wild moors of Lancashire, are two men; one of them can Avith difficulty write his own name, and the other is entirely illiterate. They have before them a frame of such rude construction, that any carpenter of ordinary abihty would have been ashamed to OAvn the workmanship : yet these men, and this frame, were destined, under the guidance, Ave firmly believe, of divine Pro-"], [19, "11 OF COMMERCE. vidence, to introduce an entirely new system of labour into the world: and along with it Avas to come a fresh style of thinking and reasoning; which in little more than half a century changed the commercial policy of an empire, more powerful than that of Rome, and converted viUages containing hundreds into towns with their tens of thousands of inhabit- ants: and all this mighty revolution in the industry of the world, originated with men Avho were alike ignorant of the enormous value and vast capabilities of their OAvn inventions. The almost incon- ceivable amount of wealth that flowed into the coffers of those Avho followed the road laid open to them by Hargreaves and others, and the treatment he received from his country are matters of history, though more improbable than the fictions of the novelist. When Morland had been fully \"in censed,\" as he caUed it, that, Avith the assistance of the machine a single person"], [20, "12 THE VICISSITUDES could produce more weft for the weaver than eight or ten spinsters, he was lost in astonishment. \" An' Avhat art goin't' kessen it,\" asked Morland, \" for tha mun caw it summot?\" \" Why tha sees it wur doin th' wark as th' oud woman us't, so we just caAved it artur hur, loyke.\" \" And whot's that, mon?\" \" Why, ' Jenny,' to be sure. Before parting, they agreed that Mor land should return on the foUowing day, and bring Betty Avith him; when they might consult upon the best course to be adopted. By the time Morland had con cluded his narrative, the children were asleep, for the story had been a long one, related in his uncouth dialect ; which, for the better enhghtenment of Betty, had to be assisted by various plans, draAvn with the poker in the soot that crusted the stones of the chimney. Betty rose in the morning an altered woman. UntU now she had been per-"], [21, "13 OF COMMERCE. fectly contented Avith her humble con dition, neither wishing to be rich, nor envying those Avho were so : her highest ambition having been, only to please her husband by her industry at the spinning wheel. She reA7olved in her mind the great scarcity of yarn, and the willing ness Avith which it would be purchased by the weavers ; and by degrees wrought up her imagination to a state of excitement similar to that shoAvn by some of her fair countrywomen to obtain script in the South Sea scheme, or in the more recent railway bubbles. Jenny was of a different temperament : she would have much preferred remaining in the station of life she then held, than through never so little enterprise raise herself higher in the world. Frequently had she vented her discontent with her husband's experiments, calling him a \" lubberly foo,\" for wasting his time with nothing but scheming, instead of weaving as he used to do. She had threatened"], [22, "14 THE VICISSITUDES more than once to burn his frame, and then he Avould not have heart to begin again. Little did Jenny conceive, that the despised frame was to immortalize her, and hand doAvn her name to posterity. When the machine was completed, and had relieved her of a great amount of labour, though fully appreciating its pre sent utility, the only remark she made that testified her approbation was, \" Jim has moor brains tel ha thout on.\" Her advice was, that they should keep their oavii loom going, and not let any one into the secret. Hargreaves was of the same opinion. But this Adew of the case did not accord with either Morland's or his wife's notions, \u2014 their proposal being, that another frame should be constructed, and as much yarn as possible spun. But then, the difficult point was, how were they to secure the invention to themselves? They had not money to patent it, and were afraid to communicate it to any of their richer neighbours. They finaUy"], [23, "15 OF COMMERCE. arranged, much against the wish of Jenny, that Hargreaves was to work his frame, whilst Morland disposed of the produce as quietly as possible; and, in the mean time, construct another frame, at his OAvn house."], [24, "16 THE VICISSITUDES CHAPTER II. \"Th' invention all admir'd; and each how he To be th' inventor miss'd, so easy it seem'd Once found ; which, yet unsound, most would have thought Impossible.\" Milton. The tOAvn of Blackburn, in the year 1768, was small, but situated in the centre of a populous district, inhabited by a class of cottagers who earned a livelihood partly by farming small patches of land, and partly by spinning and weaving. This had induced a number of manufacturers to put out work there ; consequently, upon the market-day a great concourse of Aveavers from the surrounding country assembled in the toAvn ; and, after business was over, smaU clusters of them might be seen at the corners of the streets, discus sing the latest news. The topic of con-"], [25, "17 OF COMMERCE. versation being, the great difficulty they had to keep their looms at work, and the extraordinary demand there Avas for cloth. About twelve months after the events related in the first chapter had occurred, a small group of men were going on foot towards Blackburn. It was erident to the initiated eye that they were weavers, as each of them carried, slung across his left shoulder, a wallet made of coarse blue linen cloth, and which contained his \" cut,\" or piece of cloth. They overtook on the road two females, who were con veying a large basket of weft to market. As this was a circumstance very unusual in those brisk times, it naturally led to inquiries. The female who acted as speaker upon the occasion was a good specimen of the loAver class of Lancashire women of that day. She was taU and stoutly built, Avith high cheek-bones, and blessed with an extremely loud voice. She said things"], [26, "18 THE VICISSITUDES were \" comin' to a bonny pass,\" when a poor lone woman like herself was driven to hawk \"th' bit ot wark obate.\" It never had been so before since she \" knoAved ou't, an' that Avur gooin a fifty yer;\" and all because \"a lazy oud lubber as wer too Uther t'wark,\" had made a machine that had stopped aU the spinsters' Avheels in the neighbourhood. \" He soud it for next nout, he dud hactnlly. Ha mon, an he's makin' o' mash o' money !\" Her discourse was freely interspersed with oaths, to which the men joined their OAvn imprecations; launching out into rather strong language against those who would throw the whole country side out of work, if it would advance their own individual interest. When the party arrived in tOAvn, they dispersed over the market, and excited the people, by relating the woman's story. It was deemed expedient to have a meet ing, and consider Avhat course Avould be the best for them to adopt."], [27, "OF COMMERCE. 19 Some proposed to apply to the autho rities to stop the machine; others, that the man should be kidnapped, and sent out of the country. Both these plans were unsatisfactory to the large concourse of people that now flocked together, and who merely wanted addressing, Avith a feAv words of encouragement, to make them riotous. Nor had they to wait long, or to look for some one to lead them on ; a man named Hayes, who styled him self a patriot, commenced speaking. He said, if this sort of thing were aUowed to continue, not only their wives and daughters, but themselves would be at the far end for something to do ; that a man coiUd weave twice as much cloth if his loom were kept going ; therefore, the trade must very soon be overdone. One part of the people would be left without employment, whilst the others Avould be doing all the work for less money. If they did not take care, and keep a sharp look out, there would be nothing but"], [28, "20 THE VICISSITUDES starvation and ruin for aU. He concluded this harangue by saying, that, \"as the people were the best judges of circum stances that affected their OAvn interest so much, they could not confer a more lasting benefit on themselves, than by proceeding in a body to the man's house and breaking his machine.\" This was just what the rabble wanted ; for nothing pleases a crowd more than to receive such flattery as this; and, when thus encouraged, and led on by some noisy rascal to destroy the property of their industrious neighbours, they are often too willing to foUoAV. So, vrithout any more deliberation, they demanded to be led off to the place. The woman who had giA*en the information acted as guide ; she had been one of the most turbulent among the crowd, and undertook the service with a smile of malicious triumph. The twelve months during which Har greaves had been assisted by Morland had been spent in more fully developing"], [29, "OF COMMERCE. 21 and improving the invention. They were doing well together, and had materially bettered their circumstances. Jenny was noAV quite convinced, that if things Avere allowed, as she said, \" to goo ther OAvn gate,\" they would turn out all the better for it in the end. But prosperity had a contrary effect upon Betty. Her motto was, \" When yo'n cotched one la'rock, it's yessay scotch another too't.\" The influence which the opposite dis positions of the two women exercised, in retarding or advancing the future wretch edness or prosperity of their husbands and families, was very remarkable. The one communicating her easy habits to Hargreaves; whilst the other, working upon the vanity of Morland, who had got the idea into his head that his son was one day to be a gentleman, stimulated him to stiU greater exertions. About noon on the day just aUuded to, Jenny was seated in the couch-chair, with one of the chUdren on her knee ; two or"], [30, "22 THE VICISSITUDES three of the others were busy carding cotton, Avhilst the eldest girl was pre paring some rashers of bacon for dinner. Each one appeared completely happy and contented amidst the confusion and dirt. Poor Jenny! she little imagined what hardships she had to encounter, nor knew the bitterness of the cup that was in store for her. The thunder-cloud had been fast approaching, and was soon to burst upon them with such violence, that the shock would be felt by their descendants through many succeeding generations. Weasel, a little rough-haired dog, very similar to the animal from which its name was borroAved, had been sleeping on some loose cotton, started up, and running to the door, commenced barking most furi ously : one of the children, at the same time came in crying, \"oh mammy, th' lone's full o'folk.\" Hargreaves, who was hard at work, had been alarmed by the cry of the child, and was going into the cottage to ascertain"], [31, "OF COMMERCE. 23 the cause, when he discovered that a great number of people ' had surrounded the house. His first impulse was to resist ; but Morland, who happened to be there at the time, got him into the house and fastened the door. The rabble raised a shout, and rushing forward, burst into the place. They soon overpoAvered the inmates; threatening, amidst shouts and execrations, that if the frame was not shown to them immediately \" they'd pur um awe t'death.\" Hargreaves perceiving that opposition could only lead to blood shed, and knowing that any attempt to dissuade them from their riotous career Avould be quite useless, was coinpeUed, most reluctantly, to yield to their demand. WhUst this parley was going forward, three or four of the patriots who had contrived to slip into the cow-house during the confusion of the first attack, unobserved by their companions, were, like vultures, devouring the poor man's single ewe lamb that he had guarded with"], [32, "24 THE VICISSITUDES so much care. These men learned from the Avoman in what place the frame was; and Hayes, by a preconcerted arrangement, undertook to keep his dupes back so long as to give them a sufficient time to commit one of the most shameful acts of robbery ever recorded in a civilized coun try. For when the banditti assault in the highAvay, or the common thief in the toAvn, protection is granted, and the strong arm of the law held out. But what did the authorities in this case ? They not only aUowed a few of the lowest reprobates amongst the people, the very scum of the rabble, to steal from a poor industrious man and appropriate to their OAvn use, that which might not inaptly be termed the true phUosopher's stone \u2014 for through its means more wealth has been created than aU the gold dug from the mines of Peru \u2014 but also aUowed the miscreants to remain unpunished. Hargreaves was dragged out of the house, and a sledge hammer being put"], [33, "OF COMMERCE. 25 into his hand, they had the brutality to insist upon his striking the first blow. He felt that he could as easUy knock doAvn his OAvn child ; and dashing the hammer to the floor, resolutely refused. Hayes, more to gratify his OAvn passion than through any sensibility of the bitter ness of Hargreaves's feeUngs, lifted up the hammer, and letting it faU on the prin cipal part of the machine, dashed it to atoms. The dry rushes and heather, lying about the room, were then throAvn upon the Avreck, and a fire being kindled, the framework, and other portions of the machine which were constructed out of wood, soon disappeared in the flames, amid the shouts and frantic gestures of the mob. Poor Jenny fled up stairs Avith the chUdren, upon the first alarm being given; but imagining, from the quantity of smoke, that the house had been fired, she opened the Avindow shrieking for help from the people below, who only replied wdth ribaldry and shouts of laughter. VOL. I. c"], [34, "26 THE VICISSITUDES Hayes, after giving the rioters their cue, left them; and taking Morland on one side, intimated to him that the cir cumstance of his haring one of the frames at his OAvn house was unknoAvn to any one except himself, and that if he (Morland) saved it, the future advantage derived from it must be mutual: if these terms were not accepted he should give the word to the mob, and then nothing he could do afterwards would preserve it from destruction. Morland, thinking more about his wife and children than the benefit that was to accrue to himself, consented to meet Hayes on the foUowing evening, and make an arrangement for the future. The ringleaders having accomplished their wishes, endeavoured to draw off their dupes; but when once the flood gates of riot have been unlocked, it is beyond the poAver of those Avho opened them to stem the torrent untU the waters have spent their strength.

Hargreaves was com pelled to be a spectator of this infamous proceeding, and witness the destruction of his property, without having the power to preserve any part of it, except Jenny's old spinning wheel. Their exploits terminated; one of the demagogues mounted the porch over the door, and delivered an harangue from it. He accused Hargreaves of having at tempted to enrich himself by depriving their Avives and daughters of the means of support ; and then went on to say, that the mob should continue to exercise their authority, for they had taken the law into their own hands ; and if there were occa sion to visit him again, they would have it out of his \" bones the next time.\" A c 2"], [36, "28 THE VICISSITUDES procession was then formed, and the rabble marched back to the town, parading the streets to show themselves before dis persing. Hargreaves's first care was to ascertain that his wife and children were safe ; and having in some degree aUayed their fright by an assurance that they should imme diately leave that part of the country, he went round to take a survey of the deso late scene; and thrusting his hands to the bottom of his breeches pockets, the action appearing to give him an additional amount of firmness, poured forth his long pent up rage in unavaUing invectives against Hayes. Morland took the unfortunate family to his OAvn cottage: where their arrival relieved Betty from an agony of suspense ; a gossip having very kindly informed her that \u2014 \" th' mob had bin an' kilt Jim o' Jacks, and brunt aw his things\" \u2014 she even knew how the deed had been done, but could not teU what had become of any of"], [37, "OF COMMERCE. 29 the others, but supposed they had \"aw getten brunt : an' sarve um reet too.\" But the appearance of Hargreaves and his company soon put this comforter to flight. Betty now busied herself in making pre parations to lodge her guests for the night. Jenny was anxious to cause as little trouble as possible; \" dono fash yoursell\" said she, \" we mun just sleep up-ot cheers.\" After a little planning, however, accommodation Avas provided for the whole of the unfortunate family ; a task by no means an easy one in a cottage so small. They conversed tiU near midnight on their gloomy prospects. Hargreaves pro posed to take the remaining machine into some part of the country where they might continue to work it unmolested. Morland, thinking it better not to acquaint his friend Avith what had passed between Hayes and himself, excused his wishing to remain, declaring his wiUingness to risk it again; and offering at the same time to give Hargreaves his share of the money"], [38, "30 THE VICISSITUDES they had gained whilst being together, as payment for the machine if he would leave it vrith him. This seemed to be a fair offer, and one not to be refused by a man circumstanced as Hargreaves then was. For he had now made up his mind to throAv the whole affair open, and rely upon the generosity of his country to aid him. His recent misfortunes might have taught him what to expect from a nation's bounty. On the following morning, as Har greaves still persisted in his purpose to leave that part of the country, a cart was borrowed from a neighbouring farmer, in which the poor outcast were to be con veyed to Bolton, thinking it might be dangerous to pass through Blackburn. Before setting out, Hargreaves took a last look at the jenny-frame he had just sold ; nor did he attempt to hide a tear, which trickled down his careworn cheek, at the thoughts of his fond but blighted hopes. Morland endeavoured to comfort him with"], [39, "OF COMMERCE. 31 bright prospects of future happiness; visions that were always to be in view, but never, alas, destined to be realized. Morland parted from them at Bolton, with many an assurance of friendship ; and taking Jenny on one side, told her, that neither she, nor any of her children, should ever want a home so long as he had one to offer them. Morland had not long returned when Hayes came to the cottage. He was a man who had seen a great deal of the world, having received a good education : but idle habits, and their natural con comitants, bad company, ruined him ; and as patriotism is one of the few resources left for such characters, he became a de magogue in a small way. There was very little said by either of the men : Morland was mortified at being dependent upon such a despicable feUow as Hayes ; whilst he, conscious of his power, exacted his OAvn terms, and that too, in a manner that showed he was not in a mood to be con-"], [40, "32 THE VICISSITUDES tradicted. All the yarn spun was to be sent to him, and after fixing his OAvn price upon it, he would allow Morland one third of the profit. This was an unfair advantage ; but as submission, for a time at least, might lead to something better, Morland yielded; and the jenny was once more set to work. Within a few weeks after the riot, three or four frames were constructed by the leaders of the rabble. But they Avere inferior to Morland's ; his machine having received the improve ments, which both Hargreaves and him self had been constantly studying to effect. This gave him an advantage over his com petitors, of which he took care to avaU himself. Hayes had now the means of regaining the respectable position he had once occupied: but instead of making this his aim, the increase of money only gave him the poAver of still further indulg ing his depraved appetites. Jenny-frames soon began to be publicly worked. This emboldened Morland to"], [41, "OF COMMERCE. 33 seize upon the first opportunity that offered itself to leave his partner : who, as he was getting money without Avorking for it, very naturaUy opposed any sepa ration; and threats Avere resorted to by him to prevent it. Thus a few years were passed, when one day upon entering the cottage, Hayes found only the jenny, the family having taken the opportunity during one of his drunken fits, in which he often remained a Aveek or ten days at once, to remove their furniture into another house. The frame Morland next made Avas larger than any yet constructed, it contained fifty spindles: or, in other words, would spin more yarn than fifty spinsters. The family now began to rise from their low estate, and a dawning of better days appeared \u2014 to Betty it seemed almost like a realization of her fondest hopes \u2014 hopes, which for some time she had not ventured to express.

At first his profits were large, but his private expenses exceeded them; and no long time had elapsed before aU he had was seized, and his person imprisoned for debt. After being Uberated from his in carceration, the mean wretches he had so foolishly lavished his money upon shunned his society.

He found a few unscrupulous men, choice spirits, ready and wUUng to execute any design, however viUanous. These he employed as emissaries, to instil into minds already prejudiced, a hatred of the neAV class that was rapidly acquir ing wealth, at the expense, and to the injury of the labouring many. These arguments, supported by false statements, were considered by most to be unanswer able. Meetings were held, not only in the town, but every village had its secret committee. Of all these Hayes was the director. He planned a rising through out the whole district ; and, as it Avas necessary that this rising should be simul taneous, the country Avas divided into"], [44, "36 THE VICISSITUDES t sections, each of which was to select a separate body of volunteers, who were to visit all the houses in their own section ; and, if resistance were offered by any, they were not, in such cases, to content themselves with merely breaking the ma chines, but burn the house doAvn, or maltreat the OAvner, and so deter others from adopting a simUar course. Some who joined the movement, reaUy beUeved they were benefiting themselves and the community by aiding it; but, with the greater number, malice was their strongest actuating motive. It was the intention of Hayes to lead one of the bodies himself. He chose that district in which Morland lived ; \" Wish ing,\" as he said, \" to remain on intimate terms Avith his friend.\" But Morland had received, from one of his assistants, an intimation of the proposed visit; he therefore lost no time in taking his ma chines to pieces, for he had by this time several at work, and sent them, after"], [45, "37 OF COMMERCE. dark, along with his wife and children, to a neighbouring tOAvn, \u2014 not Blackburn, but one more distant. On the day fol lowing, he had six men assisting him to get the furniture off, Avhich they hoped to accompUsh before the mob arrived. A barrel of Betty's home brewed was broached, and their potations had been sufficient to raise their courage, without incapacitating them for useful exertion. A wish was expressed that, \" th' mob ud cum, an' then they met show um ate feyte.\" The Avish was no sooner expressed than granted. Morland's house stood about a hundred yards from the road; it was approached by a lane, having a low wall on each side, Avhich was continued round to the back, forming a sort of breastwork, but not of sufficient height to afford much protec tion from stones. The enemy having been perceived when a long distance off, the little garrison held a council of war. The point to be determined upon was,"], [46, "38 THE VICISSITUDES whether it would be better to defend the house, or, leaving it to its fate, retreat Avith what they could put upon the cart. The latter course was adopted; and, as they had made up their minds to fight their Avay, one of the party, by a cir cuitous route, joined the mob; and, in order to divide their attention, spread the report that some of the things had been carried away, and were just over the hiU top. The stratagem succeeded ; one band diverged from the road, so as to come behind the house, the other advanced along the highway. The whole number Avas about four hundred, of which one-half were boys, eighteen or nineteen years of age. Their dress and language proved at once that, instead of being the industrious men they represented themselves to be, whose wives and daughters had been thrown out of work by the jennies, they consisted of the veriest vagabonds of the country ; and as for the females, unworthy of the name, we"], [47, "39 OF COMMERCE. must judge them, by the company in which they were found. The defenders, now reduced to six in number, armed themselves with stout oak sticks, about two feet long : one led the horse, whilst the others walked a few yards in the rear of the cart. The rabble overtook them a short distance from the house, on the main road, and opened the affray with a smart shower of stones, of which, un luckily, there was a plentiful supply at hand. This soon roused the blood of the retreating party, who faced about; and, upon their making a charge, the mob instinctively gave way a little. This skirmish had continued about half-an hour, when some of the attacking party crept behind the stone walls which ran along each side of the road, and, under cover of them, were enabled to get Avithin half-a-dozen yards of the defenders of the cart, Avithout being in danger themselves ; and, in this dastardly way, obtained a great advantage. A stone struck Mor-"], [48, "40 THE VICISSITUDES land on the face. When he fell, a shout was raised by the rabble, like the howUng of as many bloodhounds; and, making a simultaneous rush, they laid hold of him, before his companions could lift him up. The oaken sticks now became useful in the hand to hand melee that ensued, and many a poor feUoAV felt the weight of them. Morland was twice lost, and as often retaken by his friends; but their courage was beginning to flag, over powered by numbers, when some one from the crowd, in the very moment of victory, cried out, \" Th' sodiers is cum min !\" Any one, at all acquainted with the spirit that animates a mob, is aware that, so long as danger is out of sight, not more valiant braggarts ever lived; but, let a feAV red coats appear on the scene, and instantly each individual breast entertains the same thought, \u2014 the same inward voice speaks to each, \u2014 \" Look to yourselves, and mind you are not the hindmost.\" Every face was turned to-"], [49, "41 OF COMMERCE. wards the point from which it was sup posed the military would advance; and, sure enough, at a bend of the road, about a mile distant, red and blue, with some thing glittering in the sun's rays, looking very much like bayonets, were distinctly seen, approaching at a quick pace. A panic seized upon the rabble; and, as each conceived the prize he ran for was his ovra life, the weakest got trodden doAvn by the others in their haste to be off. This was too good an opportunity to be lost; the little band turned round upon their cowardly assailants, and took full revenge ; and, in a very feAV minutes, numbers lay sprawling in the mud, be sides those Avho had been trampled doAvn by their fellows. Hayes was one of the unfortunates; and after being, as one of the men expressed it, \" reet weel purd,\" they rolled him in the dirt, and then left him."], [50, "42 THE VICISSITUDES CHAPTER III. 1 By mutual confidence and mutual aid, Great deeds are done, and great discoveries made The wise new prudence from the wise acquire, And one brave hero fans another's fire.\" Homee's Iliad. Morland was taken up almost lifeless; the bruises he received after his fall were much more dangerous than the cut in his face. The cart had likewise been much injured, one of the shafts was broken during the efforts of a portion of the mob to overthrow it. After repairing damages they retreated towards their deliverers, who were now hidden from view. Their surprise and astonishment may be ima gined when, upon arriving at the brow of the hUl, they discovered, instead of a company of soldiers, a few peasant Avomen carrying butter to market ; they had on"], [51, "OF COMMERCE. 43 bright red, or dark blue cloaks, Avith hoods of the same colours : a few men Avith farming implements over their shoulders accompanied them. The females, afraid to proceed, returned with the cart. In the meantime, during the affray, the other detachment of the mob, after scour ing the country behind the house Avithout finding any of the jennies concealed in the heather, as they had been led to expect, went to the assistance of their companions, and succeeded in rallying part of the fugitives; but some never ceased running until they reached home, almost kiUed Avith fright. Scouts were sent out to give timely notice of the approach of the soldiers, the main body sitting doAvn to rest themselves preparatory to another race. But upon learning the true cause of the alarm, their rage knew no bounds. Turf and other combustibles were piled in the centre of one of the rooms of Mor land's house, and being fired, it was very soon wrapped in flames."], [52, "44 THE VICISSITUDES The band, now that the red coats had been transformed into red cloaks, became as Araliant as before.

This was the second machine riot that had occurred Avithin ten years; but was, in its ulterior consequences, much the more important.

Both of them, howeA'er, may be said to have accelerated rather than retarded the progress of machinery. For, as the Avinged seeds of some soUtary plant float away on the gentle gales, and appear to the uninformed observer to be lost for ever; but when the succeeding autumn arrives, instead of the single plant rearing its head alone, the Arerdant mead is white with the ripe tufts, destined in their turn to be borne by the same agency, to the margins of streams and riAmlets far from their native soU; so was it noAV, every"], [53, "45 OF COMMERCE. one having Use and property at stake, removed to some more peaceable part of the country. Nevertheless, the designs of the insti gators of the riots seemed to have per fectly succeeded, as far as they themselves were personaUy concerned ; for a great number of years elapsed before confidence was restored in the neighbourhood; and in the mean time, the Avealth and pro sperity of the tOAvn, Avhich for the last few years had been rapidly increasing, passed away. But the progress of ma chinery was not retarded: other places encouraged and fostered the outcasts; and these tOAvns rose in importance, soon outstripping Blackburn in extent and population, and shoAving how impotent were the attempts made to destroy, or even to materiaUy retard the development of the invention of spinning yarn by ma chinery. They extinguished, as they imagined, the light upon its first appear ing ; but what did they with the embers ?"], [54, "46 THE VICISSITUDES They allowed the wind to disperse them over the country, and by these it Avas quickly kindled into a blaze. When Morland's party had proceeded a few miles they halted, and perceiving signs of life remaining, removed him from the cart, and placing him on the turf near a rivulet, bathed his face and bound up his wounds. Rough nurses, as they were, they saved his Use and restored him to Betty \u2014 whose situation can be more easily imagined than described, when her husband was taken in, to all apearances, dead. But she was not a woman Avho gave way at once to misfortune; each additional affliction seemed only to add fresh energy to her mind ; and instead of tormenting herself and every one around her with useless exclamations, too often the practice of females under similar cir cumstances, she devoted aU her attention to her husband, leaving the issue to God. Morland lingered three or four days in the same state, hanging between life"], [55, "OF COMMERCE. 47 and death ; but at the expiration of that time, his vigorous constitution obtained the mastery. His recovery, however, was sIoav and Avearisome, though Betty nursed him with all the care she could bestow; and Harry, or his sister, now a blooming girl of sixteen, lightened the tediousness of the sick bed by reading, or forming bright projects for the future. When Morland's health was sufficiently restored to enable him to walk out, his first care was to find a place in which to fix up his jennies, as he was anxious to be again at work. It was his intention to select, if possible, some retired spot, a short distance from the town. One evening, accompanied by his son and daughter, he was allured by the mUdness of the spring air to prolong his ramble further than usual. They fre quently paused to admire the beauty of the scenery that surrounded them. The stream, on the banks of which they were stroUing, murmured among the loose"], [56, "48 THE VICISSITUDES stones in its rapid course from the hiUs. A short space in the centre of the valley, on either margin of the stream, was rich meadow-land, skirted with noble forest trees ; the oak and sycamore appearing to luxuriate in the climate and soU. The trees became gradually more stunted as they crept up the hill sides, untU they entirely disappeared, at the commence ment of a wild moorland, the heather on which was groAving to the summit of the hills, relieved only by large boulder stones. Numerous flocks of stock-doves, and other birds, added life and cheerfulness to the scene by their various cries and notes. The little party were overtaken by an elderly gentleman, who entered into con versation Avith them. He appeared to be pleased Avith the admiration they ex pressed at the beauty of all they saw. He was the owner of the land on the oppo site bank of the stream from that on which they stood; hence his gratification at hearing their praises bestowed upon it."], [57, "OF COMMERCE. 49 He was a good specimen of the north of England gentleman, one of the old school, and knoAvn in the neighbourhood as Squire Houghton. Being much prepos sessed with Morland, he invited him to Avalk in his grounds Avhenever he chose. They frequently met afterwards, and Morland, at the Squire's request, related to him the leading incidents of his former Use; and in him found a patron able and wiUing to protect him in his labours. A large house near the stream was placed at his disposal, together with the promise of pecuniary assistance if required. Thus the family, after so many changes, had once more a home. Their smaU capital was spent in furnishing the house, and getting the jennies to Avork. The Squire instructed his steAvard, Mr. Marsh, to afford them aU the assistance he could. Oftentimes in the performance of his duty his visits would be prolonged untU even ing, when he seldom refused Betty's in- VOL. I.

But Betty received it in a dif ferent light : \" had not the attractions of her daughter some influence over him?\" For Mr. Marsh was a bachelor. This was the question she frequently put to herself, answering it in the affirmative. And the same conclusion was adopted by Mr. Marsh's friends, long before he acknow ledged it to himself; which was not until a year had expired. Time glided by in this peaceful manner without any accident occurring to destroy the happiness of the family. Morland's was not an inventive genius, he therefore continued Avorking the frames on the ori ginal principle, without effecting any im provement of note. But another man, of a vigorous, energetic mind, had been"], [59, "OF COMMERCE. 51 devoting his time and talents to the pro jection and construction of a new ma chine. This was a Mr. Crompton; he had once worked a short time with Mor land, but leaving that neighbourhood had settled at the HaU i' th' Wood, near Bolton. This house stands on the edge of a cliff, at the foot of which flows the river Eagley. It is one of those old haUs built with alternate timber and plaster, which, though so highly ornamental, and form ing such picturesque objects in an Eng- Ush landscape, are now rarely to be met with. At one period it was surrounded by trees of immense size enclosing it in a gloomy shade; but these have aU disap peared, leaving it exposed to view, and unprotected from the winds. The pros pect from the cliff is stUl one of a most pleasing, rural nature; and the footpath which winds along the summit of the crag yet possesses attractions sufficient to make it a favourite resort of the inhabit ants of the neighbouring tOAvn. d2"], [60, "52 THE VICISSITUDES Such was the spot from which emanated the third great inA^ention of the age. For about the same time, ArkAvright, a name now familiar to every ear, had, through his OAvn natural aptitude for mechanics, combined vrith a few fortuitous circum stances, and also, probably, incited by the fame of HargreaA'es's jenny-frame, invented a machine for the spinning of coarse cotton warps ; which, through then comparative cheapness, were adATantage ously substituted for the linen ones hitherto used. His machine, winch be came generaUy known as the water frame, on account of its being driven by water-power instead of manual labour, as was the jenny, Mr. Arkwright secured to himself, in the year 1769, by a patent, the fruits of which remain to this day a monu ment alike of his fortune and his genius. Mr. Crompton's machine was intended to supersede the jenny. And selecting the best motions from that and the water frame, conjoined with some of his ovm"], [61, "OF COMMERCE. 53 invention, he produced a machine which, although the ideas were not all original, was, as a whole, unique, being quite dis tinct from either of the other two. It was of light construction, and capable of containing from two to three hundred spindles. The fibres of cotton could be spun into a much finer and more even thread than on the jenny, and with less poAver than was required to turn the water-frame. The name he gave it was a plain, but a significant one \u2014 \" The mule;\" and simple as it is, it has re sounded through Europe, and the shores of America have echoed back the sound. For the weavers were not slow in dis covering the superior quality of the yarn produced by the machine, or the great benefit that accrued from using it. If a patent had secured aU these combined advantages to the inventor, it is impos sible to form any true conception of the immense wealth he Avould have acquired; but, like Hargreaves, he had the misfor-"], [62, "54 THE VICISSITUDES tune to be too poor to reap the benefit of it himself. His mortification must have been very great when he saw others gathering in the golden harvest which ought, by right, to have been his OAvn; and this feeling Avould be aggravated by the conduct of some who, whUst enjoy ing the gain, were like wild beasts, ready to tear him in pieces for even presuming to receive a slight recompence from the legislature. Morland at once perceived the vast capabiUties of Mr. Crompton's invention, and, with his thorough knowledge of the jenny-frame, could easUy have con structed one similar; but he displayed a sense of honour not shoAvn by many of his richer neighbours : he purchased one from the inventor. When power began to be used instead of manual labour to drive machinery, it was discovered that this mode of propul sion was pecuUarly adapted to the mule. Morland induced Mr. Marsh, now his"], [63, "OF COMMERCE. 55 son-in-law, to join him, and, Avith the as- sistance of the squire\u2014 who had not for- gotten his promise, though made years before, \u2014 a smaU mUl was erected on the bank of the stream, whose crystal waters dashing over a wheel placed outside the building, sparkled as if in anger at being diverted from the course doAvn which, for thousands of years, they had gUded un- molested by aught save the trunk of some tree, dislodged by the wintry blast. By adopting the new plan, it was found that one man could work two mules at the same time, or, as it is now termed, \" put up a pair of wheels.\" As this reduced at once the demand for adult labour by one half, it would be natural to suppose the opposition to the innovation would have been Adolent; but the high wages, ex- tremely out of proportion to those earned in any other laborious occupation, pre sented an inducement so alluring, that resistance quickly gave way before it. Nor did the changes introduced stop here."], [64, "56 THE VICISSITUDES The hours of labour were lengthened, and fixed, and a system began to develop itself which had no parallel, not even in slavery. So long as the water-wheel or steam-engine turned round \u2014 let that be fourteen or sixteen hours per day \u2014 so long must the machinery be kept in motion. Children commenced working in the miUs when only six years of age, and, in many instances, even younger; and as they were too short when standing on the room floor, stages had to be erected round the machines, on which the poor urchins remained during the hours of labour. These regulations were brought into the system by degrees, and were the work of years. One evening, when Betty was seated at her needle, her attention was draAvn to an old beggar-woman who came up to the door. She appeared to be a truly wretched object, \u2014 haggard and careworn. A little boy, without shoes or stockings, held one of the tatters of her ragged"], [65, "57 OF COMMERCE. cloak. She solicited alms, not Avith the whine assumed by professional mendi cants, but in the tone of voice she was accustomed to use on other occasions. Betty no sooner heard that voice than she recognised it in a moment. \" Ha, Jenny ! \u2014 is that you ? Come in, in God's name.\" Neither of the tAvo friends could have known the other by any outA\\rard sign; for such were the alterations made by twenty years' incessant care on the one, and the peace of mind Avhich the other had for a feAV years enjoyed, that the mo dulations of the voice alone remained the same through their various changes of fortune. Betty Avas much stouter, and having on her evening dress of dark brown silk, and a high cap of the style then worn, her appearance bespoke a rank superior to that in which Jenny had expected to find her.

This embarrassed him, and though lie laboured early and late, strug gling against misfortunes, still calamities thickened around him, as if urged on by an evil destiny, to which he must inevi tably succumb.

It was then she remembered the parting words Morland had used, and, taking one of her grandchUdren, its parents being dead, set out for Lancashire. But her troubles were not ended; for, upon arriv ing there, she found everything changed. The old generation had almost entirely disappeared, and those few to whom she could make herself known, gave her the chUiing reception that poverty too often meets Avith from the more fortunate of mankind. AU the information she ob tained from them about Morland was, that he left the neighbourhood, along with many others, a dozen years before, and they supposed he had gone to a tOAvn about ten mUes off. Thither she deter mined to proceed, as the possibUity of meeting Avith that famUy was the only ray of hope remaining for her on this side the grave. \" And then,\" said she, to the little barefooted companion of her wan derings, \" if they driven us fro their door, death 'Ul soon reUeve me from the cares"], [68, "60 THE VICISSITUDES of a miserable life.\"\u2014 \"But what'U become o' me, gron'ny?\" \u2014 \"God 'Ul tak care of yo, child,\" replied she. If she imagined for a single moment, that either Betty or her husband would be actuated by the sordid spirit she had witnessed in aU to whom her necessities had been made knoAvn, she did them an injustice. Her plan was to beg from door to door ; and, in this manner, had at last stumbled upon the right one. Her reception was a most hearty one ; and the sincere pleasure Betty evinced at meeting Avith her old friend, added not a little to Jenny's happiness. When the squire was informed that Hargreaves's Avidow had arrived in the \" Happy VaUey,\" as he termed it, he sent for her to the Hall ; and, after hearing her story, settled her in a neat cottage on the outskirts of his grounds, in Avhich she passed the remainder of her life. Her grandson was taken by Morland into the miU. The christening of their grandson was looked forward to by Betty and her hus-"], [69, "OF COMMERCE. 61 band with extreme pleasure. Henry Morland had married the daughter of a respectable yeoman, who held a farm under the squire ; and, as that gentleman availed himself of every opportunity which presented itself for increasing the happi ness of those around him, he, on this occasion, insisted upon being one of the sponsors for the infant. This was an unexpected honour, and one that raised the family not a little in the estimation of their neighbours. The ceremony was performed in the private chapel at the HaU ; after which a number of the villagers and tenantry assembled on the lawn, passing the rest of the day in rustic games and sports; merriment and inno cent pleasure reigning triumphant, under the auspices of their generous host. \" And young and old come forth to play On a sunshine holyday, Till the livelong daylight fail : Then to the spicy nut-brown ale.\" Morland's intercourse Avith society, more polished than that amongst which his youth and early manhood had been"], [70, "62 THE VICISSITUDES spent, tended but little to soften the rough dialect peculiar to his native hills. \" Ha should nobbod mak a foo' o' mysel',\" said he, \"if ha wer to try t' spayk loike th' gentlefolk, so ist neer oss.\" And this independence of manner made him a great favourite with his patron. The young squire and Henry Morland were upon stiU more famUiar terms, \u2014 they Avere inseparable sporting com panions ; and as the fox yet lurked about, and grouse, pheasants, and other game abounded in the neighbourhood, much of the young men's time was spent in the enjoyment of hunting, and every sort of field sports. Betty had usurped the office of chief nurse on the festal occasion ; and, instead of joining in the gaieties at the Hall, she was quietly seated by the cradle, as though the infant sleeping in it were reaUy her OAvn.

Now, in the manufacturing districts, the orphan chUdren of the poor are, in general, wiUingly adopted by their relations; for after the age of thirteen a child earns more than the cost of his main tenance. There is, also, another cause which, perhaps, more frequently than in former days, tends to overstock the poor houses.

Thus, a family avUI have a debt of a few pounds hanging over them for years; and Avhich, more frequently than otherAvise, is never paid. This risk the shopkeeper is aware of when the agree ment is made; therefore, to make the chances equal, he charges from ten to twenty per cent, more than the ready money trader would; and that, too, for"], [116, "108 THE VICISSITUDES an inferior article. The weekly earnings of Jack and his family had been from sixty to seventy shiUings; yet, on the Monday morning, it was all squandered, so utterly improvident Avere they; liter aUy, \" taking no thought for the morrow,\" but \" frolicking while it Avas May.\" As it had appeared very likely that the family were permanently settled at Mr. Morland's miUs, they were aUowed an unusual extent of credit. But, now that the calamity had happened, Jack was very cool about the matter; nothing better than an acknowledgment of the debt, and a promise to pay when he got work, could be extracted from him ; and with this his creditors were obliged to content them selves, the weekly income of the family being reduced to the club aUowance of fifteen shillings. The next day Jack was sitting over the fire in a melancholy mood, not caused by regret for his recent foolish conduct so much as by vexation at the ingratitude"], [117, "109 OF COMMERCE. displayed by his feUow-workmen, who allowed him to be sacrificed Avithout one word of remonstrance on their part ; and his place, too, was filled up by one who had priATately urged him on in the affair; the last circumstance gaUed him more than any other. The only consolation he could deduce from his reflections was, that he imagined the worst was now knoAvn ; and, therefore, the sooner he set about recovering employment the better it would be for him. His meditations Avere disturbed by the latch of the outer door being quietly lifted; he turned round just in thne to see the head and shoulders of a raw boned Scotchman disappear from the partly opened door. Jack shouted to him, with an oath, to come in ; he entered, dis playing an air of assured confidence. He was one of that class of men Avho are designated \" Scotchmen,\" and under that title solely are but too well knoAvn in the populous districts of Lancashire, Avhich"], [118, "110 THE VICISSITUDES are much infested by them. After open ing his pack on the table, he selected from its contents a goAvn-piece and two showy cotton shawls, of Paisley manu facture; these he hung over his arm, in order to give full display to their attrac tive colours. \" These shaAvls,\" said he, addressing Jack's wife, \" wiU mack your lasses look as braw as fine ladies.\" Jack had been eyeing him very closely, and was not aware the things had been ordered by his daughters. \" Tha's getten tut rung shop to-day, mon, for ween nout spend upo' sick Uke tackle as them; so tha met as weU put um i'tha pack agen, an' tack thesel' off.\" His Avife perceived that a fuU disclosure was inevitable; she therefore thought to obtain an advantage by prefacing it with a little abuse. The epithets she used to wards her husband were indicative neither of love nor respect. She reminded him of"], [119, "111 OF COMMERCE. the money he spent at the beer- shop, whilst she had scarcely sufficient to pro vide meat, let alone clothes ; and if it had not been for this \" felly\" giving long credit, they should have been in rags before then. Her harangue was rather a lengthy one, and given in an energetic and loud pitched tone of voice. It completely roused Jack's mettle. He stood up Avith a froAvn of portentous blackness, and de manded from the man how much he wanted from him? Sandy puUed out his note-book, and running his eye over the pages, informed him that, including what he had brought that day, the debt would be fifteen pounds and some odd shiUings, besides twenty -three shillings for interest. Jack took the shaAvls, and, rolling them up in the pack, deposited the whole, Avith the assistance of his foot, in the middle of the lane. He then, advancing his hand to Avithin a few inches of the fire-poker, said, \" Theer, pack off after thy trumpery"], [120, "112 THE VICISSITUDES traps, or I 'U gee thee sick a hidein' as thou's not getten sin tha coom fro' that lousy country o' thine.\" Sandy, though large of limb, had the usual amount of prudence for which his countrymen are proverbial; he trusted rather to the arm of the law than his OAvn, which he might, perhaps, have lacked courage to use, and therefore made a pre cipitate retreat, which he covered by menaces of vengeance by law; though, U Jack might have had his choice, he would have preferred a reference to the god of battles, by the summary process of a Lan cashire \" miUing.\" The threats, however, were sufficient to warn him of what was about to follow, and he soon made up his mind as to the most judicious course he could adopt, to escape from the conse quences of this rough reception of his creditor. After dark, he called a few of his neigh bours together, informed them of his difficulties, and requested them to assist"], [121, "113 OF COMMERCE. in making what is termed \" a moonlight flit.\" As cheating a Scotchman is con sidered not only quite fair, but even meri torious, they readily acquiesced ; and, before midnight, all the furniture Avas removed to a place of safety, to the no smaU consternation of Sandy, when he called the next day, and Avho now willingly compromised the matter for one-third of the original sum, the payments to com mence when the family obtained work, which they did shortly after at Mr. Marsh's mill. Jack Avas not long in discovering that his imprudence had entailed upon him a much more laborious employment than any he had previously been used to; and that, too, Avithout benefiting his family. He was placed on a set of treble deckers ; but as this must be unintelligible to per sons not acquainted with spinning ma chinery, it will require a few words of explanation. Until within about twenty years of the period of which we Avrite, the"], [122, "114 THE VICISSITUDES number os spindles il, had been thought possible to work in one mule, or spinning* frame, Avas four hundred; and nny one Avho should then have proposed u much larger number, would have been con sidered insane. lint competition, and a desire of gain, will lend, or drive men so accomplish (hut Avhich prudence would not otherwise have dictated, nor foresight have ventured upon. The four hundred were gradually augmented to five: the operative spii rs affirming, as each addi tional number was added, thai this must soon eense, for no man could stand the work. But the ease with which the machines were kept in motion, proved the fallacy of these assertions, and six hundred became the order of the day. It, was now found that the mill-owners avIio had the newest, and longest machines, could pro duce yarn nt so much less cost, than those who were not possessed of these advan tage's, that it, became u mailer of serious consideration with the latter, what course"], [123, "115 OF COMMERCE. they should adopt in this emergency. In an evil hour, the idea of joining two of the smaUer frames together, by rods of iron carried from one to the other, and bolted firmly into each, suggested itself to the too fertile brain of some enemy to the working classes. His contrivance was found to be practicable, and was caUed \" double decking ;\" one spinner performed the work of two. But a master, not satisfied Avith this, said, \" If he can do the work of two men, why not that of three ?'' This end Avas obtained, by carry ing out the same principle, and fixing another machine to the first one. These three spinning-wheels, now one machine, were termed \"a treble decker.\" The management of them is aUowed to be, perhaps, as hard work as the human frame can endure; and, indeed, much too toU some to be continued Avith safety to health through twelve hours each day. Such was the description of work Jack was now obliged to perform. But the"], [124, "116 THE VICISSITUDES change did not cease here. When a man obtained Avork at Mr. Morland's mill, he was permitted to live in any cottage he chose that was at liberty, whether it be longed to his master or not. Mr. Marsh, on the other hand, rented a large number of cottages in the vicinity of his mill: these he sublet at exorbitant rents to the hands employed by him. The plan adopted to keep them tenanted Avas this : Avhen a man was \" shopped,\" a key of one of the cottages was placed in his hand, and the rent deducted each week from his wages. A key was given to Jack along Avith his wheel ; this Avas only what he expected, but Avas surprised Avhen his son brought one home too. He remonstrated with the manager, on the plea that his son was unmarried, and lived at home; a similar plea had been urged in many cases before, but never with success. They must pay for the two houses, but might live in either or neither, as best suited them. As no"], [125, "117 OF COMMERCE. tenant could be found to take the super fluous one, it was let for a pigsty. His master, Mr. Marsh, was a descendant of the man with Avhom Mr. Morland's grand father had commenced mule spinning. When their capital increased, differences of opinion began to arise, causing dis agreements, until the partners thought it most prudent to separate. Mr. Morland retained the old mill, his former partner built another in the neighbouring tOAvn. The business carried on ever since by the family had proved a profitable one; the Mr. Marsh, of whom we speak, having found himself, at the death of his father, the sole possessor of a large mill and an extensive landed estate. He was a pomp ous, self-opinionated man, ignorant of his trade, and quite unfit for it; his friends advised him to retire. But unsolicited advice is often thought to be impertinent, and therefore seldom acted upon. In stead of contracting his business he ex tended it; and being too proud to give"], [126, "118 THE VICISSITUDES it his personal superintendence, it was left to servants. The consequence was, his capital underwent a gradual but steady decrease. He did not alloAV this to give him any serious trouble or to interfere with his pleasures, until his affairs became so much embarrassed that he must either reduce his expenditure or obtain assistance. This occurred about two years previous to the time at which Jack Houghton obtained employment at his mill. In the height of his perplexity he had condescended to consult his friend, Mr. Morland, showing him the true posi tion of his affairs, and soliciting his advice as to the best means of extricating himself from his difficulties. To Mr. Morland's mind the remedy was simple, though per haps it might not appear so to a man of luxurious habits, and addicted only to pleasure. \" Having voluntarily laid the state of your affairs open to me, Mr. Marsh,\" said he, \" I shall, in the most plain manner,"], [127, "OF COMMERCE. 119 teU you the course I should think it my duty to my son to follow, if placed in a similar position to that in Avhich you now find yourself. First, then, I should devote the Avdiole of my time and energy to business, dismiss all my superfluous servants, and see that the rest do their duty; there would then be more order and diligence, for the eye of the master is quite as essential to the obtaining of both these in a cotton miU, as that of the com mander on board a man of war; and these are quite as requisite in one as the other.\" \" I agree with you, sir, upon that point,\" rejoined Mr. Marsh. \" I think there could be a trifle saved by a few reforms of that nature. But it would give me no end of trouble, and be a con stant source of annoyance.\" \" Of your capability to put up with a few trifling vexations, of course you wiU yourself be best able to judge; but this Avould be the least sacrifice I should make ; for having once put my shoulder"], [128, "120 THE VICISSITUDES to the wheel, I should not stop here. The interest on the mortgages might be met by a reduction of my establish ment, selUng horses and carriages, and letting my pleasure-grounds to the gra zier.

And the prospects of a remunerative trade, at least for a short time to come, are beginning to deATelop themselves; these vriU serve to encourage you to make the necessary exertions.\" \" But my dear sir,\" rejoined Mr. Marsh, \" it is very easy for a man in affluent circumstances to give advice which he thinks wiU never faU to his lot to apply to himself.

Two of them have just completed their education, and are being introduced into society; whUst Ann, the youngest, is receiving her finish at Miss Cramm's boarding-school. The girls' prospects would be blighted for life, after their education has cost me nearly two thousand pounds.\" \" You would, I think, Mr. Marsh, more effectually secure their future happiness by acquainting them with their true position, rather than by fostering a loATe of afflu ence and grandeur, which are very likely to be snatched away before they have weU tasted their sweets.\" VOL.

Mr. Marsh had the inclinations of aU these persons to consult, and finding the course laid out for him bv bis friend was one that would materiaUy interfere Avith their enjoyments, he condemned it at once. \" Oh, no,\" said he, \" your plan is not to be enter tained for a moment ; and, in fact, I haA-e a much better one offered for my ap proval.\" \" Indeed, sir.\" \"Yes,\" continued Mr. Marsh; \" I Avas having a little conversation about my affairs with two particular friends of mine, Manchester gentlemen, Messrs.

Robbson and Steele; however, he stiU persevered in his endea vours to deter him ; offering to lend him either ten thousand pounds, or more, if he wanted a larger sum. But Mr. Marsh declined it, on a plea that it might be a cause of discord between them at some future time. A few days after this conversation he"], [134, "126 THE VICISSITUDES waited upon his Manchester friends to conclude the arrangement. Mr. Robbson, the senior partner, was tall, robust, well formed, and in the prime of life ; his hair, once black, was now almost a pure white ; anxiety, and the up-hill work of his earlier years, had probably effected this change; or perhaps it had been produced by the qualms of conscience; but if so, all such puerile misgivings had long disappeared. A physiognomist would have been com pletely at fault here : for under the bland, open smile that lit up his fine coun tenance, and which he rendered more de ceptive by a cordial shake of the hand, was concealed intense selfishness, and a sordid love of money, almost amounting to worship. His partner, a dark com plexioned man, .spare, and below the middle height, was one of the genus desig nated by the business world as \" shrewd ;\" the cast of his pale features betrayed at once the deep craft of the fox mingled"], [135, "OF COMMERCE. 127 with the rapacity of the wolf. Totally void of sensibility for another's misery, he would, with a cool, calculating spirit, wring the last sixpence from his unfortu nate victims. Mr. Steele and his partner were both fully aware, that this address Avas not prepossessing ; so by tacit agreement each had taken the department in the business best suited to his individual talents. Mr. Robbson threw the painted fly over the troubled waters, and allured the unwary to take the fatal bait : but no sooner was the prey fairly entangled, than the angle was placed in the more skilful and less nervous grasp of Mr. Steele; and lucky was he who escaped. Such were the per sonal qualities of the men to whose tender mercies Mr. Marsh was about to commit the real management of his affairs. Mr. Steele always \"happened\" to be engaged whilst the preliminary arrange ments were being conducted; and judg-"], [136, "128 THE VICISSITUDES ing from the frank behaviour of his partner, Mr. Marsh had the simplicity to imagine he could \" overreach\" a gentle man of such extreme goodnature.

CHAPTER VII. \" Forget we now our state and lofty birth, \u2014 Not titles here, but work, must prove our worth. To labour is the lot of man below ; And when Jove gave us life, he gave us woe.\" Pope's Homee. Not more than a week had elapsed after Mr. Morland's discourse with his reverend friend, before he received a communica tion from the Hardston union. It was signed by Mr. Hawke on behalf of the Board, and contained the notification that one of the officers of the Union would be despatched forthwith with sixty children and young persons, of both sexes. This man had received instructions to accom pany them as far as Manchester ; and, upon reaching that town, to place them under the charge of any person Mr. Mor land should appoint to meet them. The g3"], [138, "130 THE VICISSITUDES letter went on to state that it was the wish of the Board that some of the children should be bound for different periods, the terms of apprenticeship vary ing according to their ages : these inden tures to be executed in the presence of their officer. Mr. Morland's sanguine hopes of the great advantages to be obtained from his new scheme, had been somewhat damped by the well-supported arguments of his friend. He began to view it in a different light, and think that in this transaction he was not acting with his usual kindness towards his own work-people; but enter ing, without due deliberation, on a course which he was already half convinced was not a prudent one, and upon the moral responsibility of which he now, for the first time, seriously reflected. But he had proceeded too far to retrace his steps. On the day fixed for the arrival of the young strangers, Hargreaves, the manager, was sent to meet them at the Manchester"], [139, "131 OF COMMERCE. terminus of the Sheffield railway, where he was joined by Frank Morland. They had not waited long before the expected train came in. The poor children were dealt with after the true workhouse fashion, being crowded together in cattle boxes, the older females alone being so far indulged as to have one of the open carriages, formerly in use on the railway, allowed them. There were two lists of names \u2014 one specifying those children who were to remain free, the other giving the names of some, who, it was supposed, would prove the most intractable. The awkward movements and rustic appear ance of most of them, as they stepped forward in answer to their respective names, was a source of much amusement to a number of idle railway porters, that flocked from all parts of the station to see them ' drilled,' and whose loud peals of laughter re-echoed from the lofty roof. The first called was a little sturdy fel low, with a grin extending from ear to"], [140, "132 THE VICISSITUDES ear across his sunburnt countenance. He came blundering over the platform, as if it were the first time he had ever put his foot on a boarded floor, and gave a strong tug at the lock of hair that hung over his forehead. Upon being asked if his name was Job Rowley, he gave another tug, and said, \" Ize be he, zur.\" The next in succession was a youth about sixteen years of age; he looked extremely dull and sullen. After being twice asked if his name was Benjamin Douse, all the answer extracted from him was, \" Yah !\" They proceeded in this way until they came to the two last names on the list of those who were called intractable. These, Maria and Edwin St. Crost, had ap parently been added since the list was made out, there being two more than the number first mentioned. The hand writing was also different, and made more remarkable, as indicating a shght tremor of the hand of the scribe. The mirth of the bystanders had by this time"], [141, "133 OF COMMERCE. become most boisterous ; as, hitherto, each of the strangers had either said or done something which was considered ridi culous. But when Maria St. Crost came up, and, with her eyes bent on the ground, dropped a curtsey, though the mouths of the idlers were already opened, not a laugh was heard. This embarrassed the poor girl in a much greater degree than a noisy display of their feelings would have done. But her distress was only momen tary; a shrill whistle pierced the air, giving warning that a train, the approach of which would not otherwise have been known, was about to enter the station. This unpleasant but useful signal acted like magic in dispersing the loiterers to their respective duties, one of them re marking to his companion, whilst they emptied the luggage-van, \u2014 \" I say , Bill : that ere lass is a stunner, aint hoo? \u2014 hoo's what I should caw, ' a fust-class carriage.' \" Maria now ventured to look up, but quickly averted her eyes when"], [142, "134 THE VICISSITUDES she perceived the steadfast gaze which Frank Morland had fixed upon her. She was not aware that he was to be one of her future masters; and when he ad vanced to speak to her, a slight blush mantled her lovely countenance at the thought of having given him, though un consciously, a cause for doing so. But his kind and gentlemanly address at once reassured her. Frank had examined the writing very minutely; it appeared ex tremely like that of Mr. Hawke. He said he thought there must be some mis take, the two names should have been on the other fist. The officer informed him his instructions were peremptory, and he must adhere to them, and more particu larly in regard to these two names than any of the others. \" There is something mysterious about this. I never saw intractability wear such an amiable dress before ; and, unless you are willing that this bond should be executed,\" said he, addressing the"], [143, "135 OF COMMERCE. stranger, \" I shall not put my signature to it.\" \" Indeed, sir,\" said the man, \" I shall insist upon having them both signed.\" Frank took no notice of the official, but proceeded, \u2014 \" My dear girl, you may not be aware that you are about to be de prived of freedom ; that, for the next two years you will be under the restraint of my father and myself, and so unable to return to your native county, even if you wished so to do.\" \" I had not been informed, sir, that 1 was to remain here by compulsion.\" \" And dare you, then, entrust your liberty with us?\" \" I am willing to do so, sir.\" Maria St. Crost was nineteen years of age, and though clad in similar style with the rest of her female companions, every one present easily perceived that she had not been selected from the same class as they; for never was good-breeding con trasted in more distinct colours, with"], [144, "136 THE VICISSITUDES uncouth manners. Her voice was not tainted by any vulgar or provincial ac cent, but was low and silvery. Frank left the young strangers under the care of Hargreaves, having first instructed him how to proceed until he arrived at the mill, which was distant about four teen miles. Whilst taking some refresh ment, the manager informed them that the gentleman they had seen was Mr. Frank Morland. They expressed sur prise at his mild behaviour, and handsome generous countenance : for they had fully expected to find, in the hated and dreaded \" cotton lord,\" a hard, tyrannical, mean looking man, shabbily dressed, and covered with bits of cotton-wool. Those who had come voluntarily were highly elated ; and even the rest hailed it as a good omen. Little did they imagine how powerless their young master was to control even a portion of the mighty system within whose tyrannical grasp they were about to be placed. Hargreaves was contrast-"], [145, "137 OF COMMERCE. ing in his mind the marked difference in appearance between the young strangers with their clean, ruddy, sunburnt faces, and the factory operatives, pale and be grimed with soot. Not wishing, however, to damp their spirits, he did not express what he thought. The first arrangement upon the arrival of the strangers, was to find homes for them. The younger children were appor tioned out amongst the spinners, who were to take them to their houses, and treat them as any other member of their family ; being repaid by the labour of the child. This was submitted to unwillingly by some of the men ; for they well knew the object it was intended to effect. The young persons were to be put into the card rooms, and it was therefore necessary that lodging should be provided for them in the village. This, it was found, would be a difficult task to accomplish that even ing; in the dilemma, Hargreaves, the manager's father, offered to take one"], [146, "138 THE VICISSITUDES to his cottage until morning. The old man had been in the employment of the Morlands, since the evening upon which his grandmother and he had entered the valley, half a century previous. Mr. Morland had a great respect for him, not only for his being the grandson of Har greaves, the inventor of the jenny, but also on account of his own ingenuity, and faithful, upright conduct as a servant. Nor was his master the only admirer of so praiseworthy an example of continued honesty ; Mr. Wynn entered largely into the cares and pleasures of the old man, who, with his dame, about the same age as himself, lived in the neat little lodge that stood at the entrance into Mr. Mor land's grounds, and which the reverend gentleman graced with his presence almost every Sunday evening, after the services of the day were completed; and fre quently, when accompanied by Mrs. Wynn, would partake of Dame Hargreaves's homely tea, which was always prefaced"], [147, "139 OF COMMERCE. by many excuses for its quality. And it was by such kind attention, and con ciliatory conduct as this, that Mr. Wynn had engaged for the church the affections of many of his parishioners. With this good old pair, and at their quiet cottage, was Maria destined by Pro vidence to find a temporary home. And in this respect was more fortunate than any of her companions ; for by removing her from the temptations with which she would have been assailed, if thrown among the crowd of the village, it may, on that as well as on other accounts, be said to have had an influence over the whole tenor of her future life. It was the modest demeanour of Maria that overcame the feelings of the old man, and caused him to take so important a step without first consulting his dame. His choice cost him many a good laugh, which the young men never found it dif ficult to raise at his expense ; attributing the preference he had shown for her, over"], [148, "140 THE VICISSITUDES her companions, entirely to beauty's at tractions. All this he took in good part ; and had never cause to repent of the even ing's transaction. Instead of spending the remainder of the night in pettishness or weeping, as few in her novel position, and with such a gloomy prospect of the future, could have refrained from doing, Maria was collected, and even cheerful. She perceived the value of such a home; and knew that the only way by which she would be received into it was by making herself worthy of it, and gaining the esteem of those whom she might be justi fied in regarding as her foster parents. And in this she succeeded; for the dame remarked to her husband, when they were alone, \" that lass has bin one of the gentle folk, hoos not o' th' common sort ; we'll keep her wee us, for hoo'l be a second doughter to us; and tha mun see as hoo's not put on at th' mill.\" Such was the first pleas ing impression the simplicity of Maria's manner had gained for her in their aged"], [149, "141 OF COMMERCE. breasts; and which time, as it rolled on, matured into a lasting affection. The part of the mill assigned as Maria's future workroom, was that in which the cotton undergoes the process of carding and roving ; the latter term is applied to that portion of the labour which prepares the material for the spinner. Nothing could exceed her astonishment when she first entered the room. Long lines of pillars supported the lofty ceiling, and sustained the massive shafts, which were revolving at a speed fearful to look at. The innu merable leather straps quivered as they flew on their ceaseless course, and ap peared as if each moment about to tear the machines from the places they occupied ; nor was it the eye alone that was assailed by novelty, for the ear was deafened by a Babel of confused noises, such as had never before pierced it, and caused by the different frames and engines. All these sights and sounds conspired to fill her mind with an indescribable terror. Whilst"], [150, "142 THE VICISSITUDES added to this was the impure atmosphere, laden with what seemed to her eye to be dust only ; but the cloud was composed of millions of the finest fibres of the cotton which fly off from the carding engines; and being almost as light as the air, are floated through the whole room. But what produced a stronger and more last ing feeling of aversion for her new occu pation, was the odour that exhaled from the floors, upon which large quantities of oil are unavoidably shed. So unpleasant is this, that often years of usage cannot reconcile the inhaler to it. Maria was placed under the tuition of an elderly female, who was to instruct her in the art of tending what is called a drawing-frame.

The overlooker was surprised when informed of this ; the more so, as not one of her companions, her brother excepted, had as yet been able to comprehend anything at all about the nature of their new employment. \" Yon lass,\" said the woman who had been her instructress, \"thinks hoo can welly tent th' frame hersel' na.\" \"What, so soon?\" \" Hi ; hoo sais hoo con manish.

She could not forbear, however, showing the disgust she felt at the manner in which the oil had to be used, her hands being frequently sullied with it ; and, upon returning from the mill at night, the first thing she did was to change the dress"], [153, "145 OF COMMERCE. worn during the day, for one not impreg nated with its smell. The regulations of the mill allowed Maria few opportunities, and those of short duration, for conversing with her brother, except on Sundays ; and then their leisure time was generally spent in sweet discourse, and encouraging each other to bear their present unhappy con dition with patience. Edwin's lot was more unfortunate than that his sister had to contend with ; and, though only sixteen years of age, he pos sessed a manly loftiness of spirit that soon placed him beyond the rude jests of the other boys ; but, whilst keeping him from being contaminated by their bad example, it frequently got him into trouble at the mill. The occupation he had to learn is the most unhealthy of any connected with factory labour, stripping and grinding the engines which are used for cleaning the cotton.

For, together with the dust, there are particles of metal constantly flying off; these are the fruit ful source of disease, causing asthma, and other affections of the lungs. Persons who continue in this employment, seldom attain to old age, except it be a premature one ; and though for the most part young men, still there are a few whose iron con stitutions enable them to continue it even beyond forty years of age. The men of this class, let their individual ages be what it may, are designated \" card-room lads.\" Frank Morland long remembered the scene at the railway station ; though, had"], [155, "147 OF COMMERCE. it not been for the lovely and interesting stranger, it might quickly have faded from his mind. His thoughts were con stantly recurring to her. And, upon going through the mill, he would fre quently pause for a few moments near that part of the room where she worked. This was sure to cause an almost imper ceptible colour to tinge her fair cheeks ; for the attention of her young master, slight as it was, did not escape the jealous and ever-watchful eyes of her fellow workers. And when the manager left the room, her ear would be assailed by some obscene remark, or ribald jest ; and although happy in not understanding the meaning of the words, she was perfectly conscious of the cause of them, and also of their being directed especially against herself. Ever since the arrival of the youthful rustics, Frank had taken a peculiar interest in their welfare. He occasionally visited the houses where they were placed, ascer- h2"], [156, "148 THE VICISSITUDES taining from their own lips the treatment they received from their foster parents. These visits of inspection, as they may be termed, brought him into frequent contact with the young people. With Maria St. Crost, Frank became the more pleased each time he saw her. Her natural ability soon marked her out as the one most fit to act in the capacity of superintendent over the younger por tion of the strangers, and to whom he might communicate his wishes regarding them. The pleasure he felt in thus light ening the grief of these poor creatures was, doubtless, heightened by its being the means of affording him frequent op portunities for a few moments' conversa tion with Maria. Seldom did these inter views occur except in the presence of others ; but when such was not the case, then it was that the nobleness of her cha racter best discovered itself.

Twice or thrice he had called at the lodge.

The prospects for English commerce had been gradually assuming a darker aspect since the commencement of 1846; and, towards the close of that year, it became quite apparent to all engaged in trade, that a storm was at hand which, judging from the portentous indications of the gloomy and unusual depression, threatened to be one of unwonted violence. For, as the thunder-cloud, after a few weeks of brilliant weather, hovers around some fair"], [159, "151 OF COMMERCE. scene, subduing both man and beast by its oppressive influence, and, finally, dis charging its contents on the ripening harvest, sweeps away the crops, tears up in its rapid course the noble forest trees that have weathered a hundred gales, and in a few moments spreads ruin and deso lation throughout the valley, so was it in the commercial crisis now approaching. A sufficient warning had been given since the wild excitement of the previous year ; a warning that might have induced all prudent men to contract their operations, and cease to speculate in the face of such disastrous accounts as those that were now constantly pouring in from all parts of the world. But the fever still raged, nor was it finally stopped before the great crash took place in the September of 1847, for dur ing' that month were blotted from the list of merchants and tradesmen, names that had for generations been synonymous with boundless wealth. This embarrassed"], [160, "152 THE VICISSITUDES the operations of capital, and consequently curtailed the demand for the labour of the artisan, the loss of which, to him, cannot be compensated, constituting, as it does, the sole source of both his comforts and necessaries. A large proportion of Mr. Morland's production was what is termed \" India cloths.\" These goods he shipped on his own account, having an agent both at Calcutta and Bombay. For many months the sales reported amounted to not more than half the quantity shipped. Every mail took out orders to clear off the goods, but still the sales continued as small as ever. Mr. Morland began to get alarmed about the way in which his agents were proceeding; their conduct being so oppo site to his reiterated wishes. He pacified himself for some time by thinking, that as his agents were on the spot, they might be acquainted with circumstances justify ing them in the course they were adopting. But these flattering assurances soon gave"], [161, "OF COMMERCE. 153 way to doubts when he reflected, that when, during twenty years' experience of the India trade, his judgments had dif fered from those of his agents, his own opinion had almost invariably proved the more correct in the end. Frank shared in the anxiety of his father ; and as the dilemma in which they were placed was only increased by each month's delay, he suggested the propriety of his proceeding to India, and avowed his willingness and even wished to do so. This was at the commencement of the year 1847. Nothing could have been more pleasing to Mr. Morland than his son's proposal; for he well knew that his personal super intendence would soon place matters in a right position: and though most of his time would be occupied with business, still he would have much left that might be devoted to travelling ; than which nothing tends more to improve an already culti vated mind. He agreed with the philoso- h3"], [162, "154 THE VICISSITUDES pher when he remarked, that \" no one should travel to learn without having first learned to travel.\" But there was another reason for Mr. Morland's being favourable to Frank's absence for a short period from the country: he had been a silent, but watchful observer of Mrs. Marsh, who for some time had employed all her art to engage Frank's affections for Ann, her youngest daughter. It is a very rare occurrence that all the children of a family are equally endowed with personal charms. One or two of its members monopolize the beauty of the whole, and, like diamonds, when mixed with less costly gems, appear to sparkle only the more brilliantly through the con trast. Mrs. Marsh's daughters were not an exception to this almost general rule : for whilst Ann, the youngest of the three girls, was the favoured one, her sisters were decidedly plain. Ann was acknow ledged by all to be the belle of the town ; even the fairest of her own sex were com-"], [163, "155 OF COMMERCE. pelled to allow her the palm. Her grace fulness of figure charmed every beholder ; whflst a profusion of rich brown curls gave her countenance a loveliness that would have rendered it perfectly enchant ing had not the self-satisfied smile of con scious beauty warned the almost fascinated gazer to beware. The girls had been educated in such a style as to make them what is termed, \" highly accomplished\" young ladies : music, dancing, or the last novel, being considered by them as the most important necessaries of life. Ann had always some new piece of music on which she wanted Frank's opinion; \"his taste was so much better than her sisters'. Upon these and like occasions the proud smile would be changed for one more pleasing. And though Frank ever addressed her with that courtesy which females, espe cially the handsome ones, always receive from the well bred; still, at the same time, as he imagined, without going be-"], [164, "156 THE VICISSITUDES yond the cold bounds of civility. No opportunity was neglected by Mrs. Marsh to bring the young people together. But as Frank abhorred pride or affectation, which he soon found to predominate in the dispositions both of Ann and her mamma, he never allowed his politeness to ripen into affection. The knowledge of his son's good sense might have spared Mr. Morland the anxiety he felt on the young man's account. A few days previous to his departure from England, Frank called to take leave of the family, who, until then, were not aware that he was about to leave them. This inattention at once convinced Mrs. Marsh that all her plans had been of no avail; whilst Ann, assuming one of her proudest looks, remarked, \" that she thought India a good school for young men to practise politeness in, as they could do so there without endangering the hearts of the ladies; for there they had seen sufficient of the world to be"], [165, "157 OF COMMERCE. aware what such attentions are worth.\" She then sailed from the room, without deigning to look towards, or even bidding farewell to the wanderer. Frank had sufficient command over himself not to appear conscious that any retort had been intended by his fair pre ceptor; but protracted his visit a longer time than he otherwise would have done, in order that he might show his perfect indifference to her conduct. Presents of shawls, fans, and many other female ornaments were bespoken by the ladies. \" But we must not forget Ann,\" said her mamma, \"for I am sure anything Mr. Frank may choose to bring will be highly prized by her.\" Frank only smiled assent, making no remark. The family were highly indignant at what they considered his slight in not in forming them, until the last moment, of his departure. Young Marsh said \"he was a 'muff:' and for his part he was dem'd glad he had left the town !\" The"], [166, "158 THE VICISSITUDES young men had never been associates, though acquainted with each other from infancy: business occasionally brought them in contact; but their amusements being of a completely dissimilar character, nothing beyond a mere acquaintanceship had ever subsisted between them. Young Marsh had no taste for any refined pas time ; and as for study, it possessed no attractions for him: he boasted of not having read a book through since leaving school. For even light works, or those on field sports, contained some chapters void of interest, except to a well-informed mind, or a true sportsman. His even ings were spent in the bar of a singing room, at one of the second-rate inns. And having always plenty of money to squander, he was, of course, received with favour, not only by the landlord, but also by the neatly dressed bar-maids, who treated him with an attention he never met elsewhere. The report that Frank was going"], [167, "OF COMMERCE. 159 abroad soon spread through Mr. Mor land's mills, where he was a general fa vourite. For as he looked upon the work people as freemen and not serfs, so, he would not allow the discipline of the mill to be rendered needlessly stringent or irksome. As the strangers from Suffolk had been taken under his especial care, they could full well imagine that with his departure their position would not be im proved. And, indeed, the universal re gret, and wishes for his happiness were expressed in a manner more warm and sincere than the blunted feelings of the Lancashire factory operatives usually in cite them to display. His departure from England was fixed, by the sailing of the steamer, to take place on the 15th of March. And as he stood, for the last time, surrounded with the busy scene of a cotton-mill, his eye wandered through the maze of machinery, until, as if irresistibly attracted, it rested upon that part of the room in which"], [168, "160 THE VICISSITUDES Maria St. Crost was at work. Frank gazed upon her graceful form, which dis- played, from the neat simplicity of her dress, perfect symmetry unadorned by art. This was on Saturday, on the Sunday evening he walked from church with Mr. Wynn, who, according to his usual custom, called at the lodge. Frank was embarrassed, and hesitated a few mo- ments before he entered. \" The old couple will take it to heart,\" thought he, \" if I go without saying ' goodby,' so I will just step in and see them.\" He felt relieved, but at the same time disappointed, when they found the old people alone. After remaining a short time, Frank left his reverend friend, and was retiring unaccompanied by any one, when his further progress was arrested by perceiving, through the half-open door of a small room, the window of which looked out upon the park, Maria seated reading. His recent determination, for, as we have seen, he had resolved in his own mind to"], [169, "161 OF COMMERCE. shun a private interview with the lovely stranger, had been dictated by prudence, and so long as the temptation was not offered, seemed easy to be adhered to. But he had forgotten the frailtY of human nature ; for no sooner was it in his power to gratify this once most ardent wish, than all his former resolutions vanished, like a passing thought from his mind. He entered, and so changed the future fate of both. Maria heard some one approach, but supposing it to be the old dame, did not lift her eyes from her Bible until, when she did so, they met the earnest gaze of Frank, as he leant over her. Blushing, she rose, curtsied, and was about to retire, when Frank, taking her by the hand, led her back. About an hour afterwards Mr. Wynn took his leave. He was surprised, whilst letting himself out, to find his young friend still at the lodge ; but his astonishment increased tenfold upon per-"], [170, "162 THE VICISSITUDES ceiving Maria \u2014 whose hand Frank held, a half- willing, half-reluctant captive, in his own \u2014 seated by his side. This sight, so unexpected, and so suddenly pre sented, caused the reverend gentleman to draw back in such haste that he stumbled ; and so made the young people aware of his presence Frank was about to enter into an explanation, but before he could speak, the outer door closed. The last words he addressed to his agi tated companion were \u2014 \" Farewell, Maria, and may God guard you in the midst of the wickedness that surrounds you. If it be his will that I return safe to my native land, my first act shall be to make my dearest girl my bride.\" He sealed the contract, unresisted, upon her lips; and snatching up his hat, followed Mr. Wynn, expecting to overtake him before he arrived at the Parsonage, but that gentleman having walked quickly forward, was nowhere to be seen along the wind ing carriage drive leading in that direc tion."], [171, "163 OF COMMERCE. Frank could easily picture to himself the state of mind in which his friend would be; and wishing both to remove his suspicion and ask his counsel, he resolved to wait upon him that evening. The Parsonage, situated within Mr. Morland's domain, had formerly, in the days of Squire Houghton, been the hunts man's lodge ; and though the cottage formed a portion of the present building, it was now considerably altered. It stood on a sloping bank, which, together with the opposite hill-side, was diversified with some fine trees, \u2014 the few remains of the noble forest that once flourished there; and visible at intervals through the glade, was an artificial sheet of water ex tending to the hall. The view from the latticed windows was not one which could be strictly termed \" a Lancashire scene,\" for there were no tall chimneys visible ; these sooty columns being hidden by the surrounding hills. But still there were indications of the vicinity of a"], [172, "164 THE VICISSITUDES manufacturing town. The trunks of the trees, instead of pleasing the eye by the variegated tints of their bark, all wore the same sombre hue; and towards the close of summer the foliage assumed a like appearance, as if mourning its ap proaching and premature fall ; for autumn here strews the ground with leaves much earlier than in an unpolluted atmosphere ; whilst upon plucking a rose, the finger of the fair florist, if not pierced by the thorn, would be marked by a stain that might, perhaps, more surely betray the theft. The cottage had once been hidden amongst luxuriant honeysuckle and jessa mine, but these were now replaced by ivy and a few climbing roses, trained with great care, hung over the small lattice work porch. Frank found Mr. Wynn pacing up and down a short avenue of beech trees that were near the cottage. His countenance wore an expression of pity and distress, which darkened into a deep frown as the"], [173, "OF COMMERCE. 165 young man approached to meet him ; but, nothing daunted, he addressed the rever end gentleman in his usual open manner. \" My dear sir,\" he commenced, \" I was conscious that my conduct this evening would require an explanation, and am sure that you \u2014 \" \"Why explain to me, sir?\" said Mr. Wynn, interrupting him; \"go explain to God, if your conscience will allow you even for an instant to imagine it possible to justify yourself. Little did I think thait my young pupil, taught from in fancy, and guarded with almost a parent's fond solicitude, would, like some loose libertine, merely to obtain an hour's amusement, be the instrument chosen to awaken me from my day-dream ; for all now appears to have been only a pleasing delusion.\" \" Indeed, my dear friend,\" exclaimed Frank, \" you unwittingly do me an in justice.\" \" I would to God I did. You may"], [174, "166 THE VICISSITUDES call it injustice, or give it whatever name you please, sir; but in a single night you have destroyed the labour and sullied the recollections of many happy years: years spent in assisting and watching the gradual development of a mind which, I vainly thought, would prove generous, open, and above all, virtuous.\" Frank endeavoured to speak; the re verend gentleman, however, was so over come by sorrow that he did not observe the interruption, but continued speaking in the same solemn tone. \" And old as I am, sir, I confess I was so confiding as to believe that I had at last met, in the humble ranks of Use, with a being innocent as she was lovely; one who was shunning the temptations that surrounded her, and listening with a wil ling ear to all my counsels.\" Frank's whole frame thrilled with plea sure to hear Maria's praise from the lips of Mr. Wynn, flowing, as it did, from his heart. He had for some time evinced a"], [175, "OF COMMERCE. 167 feeling of regard for her; this he never ventured to allow himself to call love. Nor had his passion deserved the almost sacred appellation until that evening. When he bade her farewell he loved her, he now almost adored her. And, taking the good old man by the hand, he said, with an earnestness that at once arrested his attention : \u2014 \" And worthy, doubly worthy is she of all the care, all the anxiety you have be stowed, or that I am sure you will in future bestow upon her; she is the inno cent, the pure being you thought her.\" \" Your words are indeed sweet to me,\" said the reverend gentleman ; \" would your actions belied them not. But they are irreconcileable. You pollute the spring, and then come and say, ' Go, draw pure water as before.' \" \" I ask but a few moments' hearing, Mr. Wynn. I will not detain you long, for I shall soon convince you that Maria will now be indeed a daughter to you; and"], [176, "168 THE VICISSITUDES that all of blame, if blame there be, in this night's actions, rests with myself alone.\" \" Proceed, sir,\" said Mr. Wynn, when Frank paused for his reply. \"I will listen to your story; but I cannot see how you will clear your conduct from guilt so apparent.\" Thus emboldened, Frank commenced his story. \" It is now many months ago since my attention was first attracted by the bril liant beauty of a young lady, the daughter of Mr. Marsh, my father's friend. This intimacy frequently brought the young lady and myself together ; but I soon dis covered that beauty alone, without some other attendant grace, could not realize the day-dreams I had been indulging in. For I had pictured to myself, as the being I could love, one to whom pride and all its concomitant evils were un known, or looked upon as the fallacies, and not the accomplishments, of life. But"], [177, "169 OF COMMERCE. with sentiments such as these I found Ann's mind had not been imbued, and our friendship progressed not beyond the cold bounds of common civility. This was just about the time when Maria and her companions arrived. I was prepos sessed with the lovely stranger the mo ment I saw and heard her speak. Some thing there was in her manner that arrested my attention ; and not mine alone, but all who were present were cap tivated by her gentleness; and day after day, as I marked her behaviour, her modest deportment convinced me, as plainly as language could have done, that she had not always been the child of want, or nurtured in the rough school of poverty. It only remained to prove, whether so much grace and loveliness was characterised by an equal share of virtue and modesty ; and I became, from day to day, more fully confirmed in the opinion I had first formed of her. I then availed myself of any opportunity that VOL. I. I"], [178, "170 THE VICISSITUDES was presented to converse with her. But when, upon one occasion, I mentioned the subject of her former life, and endeavoured to elicit something relating to it, it ap peared to give her so much distress, that I desisted from any further attempts to learn her previous history ; nor would she afterwards allow me any opportunity for doing so. I perceived, likewise, that my attention only made her the more un happy, by drawing down upon her the unpleasant remarks of the hands. Not until this evening have I been able to make known to her the deep interest I took in her welfare. As we discoursed on various subjects, the modesty and good sense she exhibited overcame every other consideration, and I avowed my love. She made use of every persuasion she could think of to divert my passion ; a noble self-sacrifice that only increased my admiration of her whole conduct.

But, having love for my ally, I overruled every objection, and Maria has promised to be my bride ?\" \" Am I to understand, sir,\" said Mr. Wynn, \" that the proposals you made were of an honourable nature, made after due reflection, or only on the impulse of the moment? I am afraid you have both been too hasty: you in soliciting, she, as the weaker, in consenting.\" \" My intentions most assuredly were perfectly honourable. I had previously reflected upon all the numerous objections to an union of this description; and as there were many of them contrary to what the world calls 'prudence,' I did for some time struggle against the nobler course I have now taken.

Mr. Wynn did not disapprove of Frank's having formed an attachment to his young favourite, now that he believed it to be honourable; and hoped, for the sake of both, that it would prove a lasting one.

The stagnation in trade which began to manifest itself towards the close of the year 1846, was not confined to any par ticular branch of it; but an universal gloom overspread every department of labour, until the springs of industry throughout the kingdom seemed to be drying up, as if exhausted by the un usually abundant supplies they had lately afforded.

In the mean time, people closed their eyes to the future ; being for a time, as it were, in tentionally blind to the awful conse quences that were inevitably to follow; and, like rash or unskilful seamen, who, though their ship has \" bumped,\" giving sure and unmistakeable warning that danger is at hand, still crowd sail upon sail, until at last the proud vessel strikes the treacherous rock, which stands in the ocean a lasting monument of their folly."], [187, "179 OF COMMERCE.

The consequence was, the stocks of yarn and cloth, made when the raw material and labour were at their highest value, rapidly accumulated. Few and fortunate were they whose warehouses remained empty. Messrs. Robbson and Steele had the baneful results of former panics too vividly impressed on their memories, and too legible on their balance sheets, to allow themselves to be caught napping.

The unconcerned passer along the street, as well as the merchant in his office, felt its operation. Mr. Steele was reading the trade article from^the Manchester Guardian of that day, Wednesday; a bitter smile passed over his features as he replaced the newspaper on the table. \" There,\" said he,"], [189, "181 OF COMMERCE. \" that is just the sort of report I expected to see of yesterday's market. Both cloth and yarns are coming tumbling down.\" \" There appeared rather more firmness, though,\" remarked his partner ; \" they talked of a better feeling too on Change.\" \" So did I, Mr. Robbson, till I had sold those ten thousand bundles of Marsh's. What d \u2014 d rubbish that yarn is, but it will do for India though. They were bought without sample by old Raisth wind. I heard he'd been offering part of 'em afterwards at an eighth less. He will break, will that fellow, before long. If he hasn't the cash at the end of his four teen days I shall fire into him. That yarn will be worth considerably less in another fortnight; and there will be no occasion to return the sale for this month, so that we shall have something more than commission on it.\" u I think you had better take Mr. Marsh's affairs into your own hands now, Mr. Steele, had you not? AVhat say you?\""], [190, "182 THE VICISSITUDES \" I've been thinking about the same thing myself. If we was to go on the same tack much longer he'd soon slip through our fingers. Indeed, I should not be surprised if he was to talk about pay ing off that last mortgage; for it was left open as to time, if you remember.\" \" Well, sir, you shall have him to your self. You can then squeeze him as hard as you choose.\" \" Trust me for that, Mr. Robbson. I intend to sweat him properly. He shan't have a d \u2014 d farthing in twelve months : nor would he have had now if you'd stuck to him properly.\" \" Why, to tell you the truth, I did not wish to go quite so fast : we are sure to have all in the end. And then there was a match talked of between young Morland and one of Marsh's daughters, which we should have spoiled : but he is going out to India; so there is an end of that.\" \" And if he had married one of 'em, what then? What benefit should we"], [191, "183 OF COMMERCE. have got by it, I should like to know? It would have been up with us as far as Marsh's business goes; Henry Morland would soon have paid us off; for what's a few paltry thousands to him when there is two hundred thousand, to my know ledge, to back 'em with ; it was him that offered to lend Marsh money when we got hold of him. But, I say, Robb son, how is it you're getting so d \u2014 d squeamish now-a-days? There's no more harm in killing the hare than in trapping him with the intention of letting some one else do it. You'll not object to share the skin, I'll be bound.\" Mr. Steele had observed the increasing dislike manifested by his partner of late to what he termed \"sweating;\" but ab stained from mentioning his suspicions until a good opportunity offered itself. He, therefore, resolved to treat Mr. Marsh with great severity: not to gratify his cupidity alone, but also to chagrin Mr. Robbson, who had been the means of"], [192, "184 THE VICISSITUDES placing him in his power. To do the business more expeditiously, or, as he jocularly remarked, \" that he might the more effectually drain the Marsh,\" he intimated to that gentleman, that it was their intention for the future to supply him with cotton themselves; as the nu merous connexions they had among the Liverpool merchants, would enable them to purchase it to much greater advan tage than he could. This compulsatory arrangement, for proposal it cannot be called, at once re moved the mask from the proceedings of those whom Mr. Marsh had termed his friends; he was now convinced of their intention to reduce him to beggary, and then cast him off; but still he wanted the courage to resist, or was so reckless as to trust to the mere chances of for tune. The legitimate profits on manufactures had either entirely disappeared, or were so fast dwindling away, that the margin"], [193, "185 OF COMMERCE. between gain and loss became every day less discernible. This was the time Mr. Steele thought to be a good opportunity for commencing his new course of pro ceedings towards involving Mr. Marsh's estate to the extent of what he supposed was its present value. This process, if conducted in the way his partner had hitherto been dealing with him, would be a tedious one ; and might have protracted the crisis for years. But Mr. Steele's notion of a clever business transaction, did not at all coincide with this. \" In such an affair,\" said he, \" we must con sider that everything Mr. Marsh has, or may have, belongs to us ; for it will be ours, and that is almost the same thing. And as there is no chance of his making anything more for some time to come, the sooner we lay hold of what there is, the better it will be for us.\" A confidential man, named Luke Sharp, was accordingly, forthwith, despatched to take the management of the mill. This"], [194, "186 THE VICISSITUDES Sharp was a creature of Mr. Steele's; an insolent, overbearing fellow; ignorant of everything that related to the proper con ducting of a cotton-mill; and one who cared nothing for the welfare of those who were so unfortunate as to be under his control. The abatements were made without discrimination ; a fixed sum must be abstracted each pay-day from the wages of the hands; whether there had been any neglect on their part, or not, the result was the same. Mr. Marsh's establishment was never what is termed \" a good shop;\" but now the workpeople wished for old times again. There was no portion of Mr. Marsh's property, except his landed estate, that was not too heavily encumbered already. Mr. Steele was aware of the ample margin that still remained for a further mortgage on the park and mansion, and this made him the more eager to embarrass his victim. But he, Mr. Marsh, knowing that bankruptcy would come either sooner or."], [195, "187 OF COMMERCE. later, resolved, if possible, to save some thing from the general wreck. For this purpose he explained his affairs to Mr. Morland so far, as to lead that gentle man to think him solvent at the time. He, therefore, willingly consented to lend him three thousand pounds, to be made over to his daughters, and invested in their names. The mortgage deed, drawn up under the superintendence of Mr. Kenworthy, Mr. Morland's legal adviser, was executed without delay. The proceedings in parliament during 1847, were watched with great interest by the factory operatives throughout the whole of the kingdom. Their darling Ten Hours Bill, it was supposed, would be passed before the end of the sessions, and crown with success the many years of persevering exertions which they had made to obtain it. Mr. Steele was vio lently opposed to the provisions of the Bill. \" There is nothing but lies and cant talked in its favour,\" he would say ;"], [196, "188 THE VICISSITUDES \" for why should the rights of labour be interfered with, and the free development of capital and enterprise be stopped by such a pack of humbugs? I always re turn them a Pharaoh's answer \u2014 ' Ye are idle \u2014 ye are idle.' \" But his was not a mere passive opposition; he made the most strenuous exertions to collect counter evidence \u2014 facts, as he styled them \u2014 con tradictory to the statements brought for ward by supporters of the measure. A petition to parliament purporting to have emanated from the operatives them selves, and to which the names of all em ployed in Mr. Marsh's establishment were appended, was placed in the hands of a member noted for his devotion to the science of political economy, and by him presented to the House of Commons. This gentleman's views entirely coincided with the prayer of the petition he had placed on the table of the House: \u2014 \" That the legislature should not impose any further restrictions on factory labour.\""], [197, "189 OF COMMERCE. He had no practical knowledge of the real position of the factory operatives; but what he observed at Mr. Marsh's mill, during a recent visit, had confirmed his original impression, that the agitation for a Ten Hours Bill was regarded by the mass of the people with perfect indiffer ence. The day previous to that on which the honourable gentleman had paid a visit to the mills, Sharp had received instructions from Mr. Steele to have it made present able. The speed of the engine was to be slackened, diminishing in an equal ratio that of the machinery, and thus lighten ing the labour of the workers, who were to be dressed in their neatest attire, and some of them reading or sewing ; for though this is contrary to all the rules of mill discipline, still it would tell, and leave a pleasing impression upon the mind of a stranger, who thus \"unex pectedly\" popped in upon them. The honourable member was quite"], [198, "190 THE VICISSITUDES charmed with the happiness and content ment he saw around him. The young women were extremely neat and clean; many of them looked interesting, whilst some were decidedly pretty. The pale countenances and hollow cheeks he had prepared himself to meet with, were no where visible, or if seen, were not so very remarkable; the most sickly in appear ance happened, accidentally of course, to be in the manager's cabin, or some private room out of the way. Two or three of the most prudent of the hands were called up and asked a few questions, as to whether they were satisfied with the law as it was, or wished for shorter hours of labour. The answers returned were, \"yes,\" or \"no,\" according to the nod or shake of Sharp's head, who stood behind the honourable gentleman, and gave the bias to the replies. But the whole plot was very nearly being discovered through the waywardness, or rather too great honesty, of one little fellow, who would"], [199, "191 OF COMMERCE. say what he thought. \" He wanted more time for play; he was not satisfied with getting home at eight o'clock, and then going straight away to bed, so that he might be at it again at five in the morn ing.\" \" You must be an incorrigible young rogue, sir,\" said his interrogator; \"why there are thousands of lads of your age in the streets of London, who would willingly give up their play, and work as hard as you, if it were only to wear such good clothes as these.\" \" Ah mon, yo should a seen thoos ha have on up'ot tuther days; air Moll sot these fro'th' popshop; for th' Bash had toud us aw as we mut put \u2014 \" He would have expatiated still further upon the reason why his old suit had been discarded for the day, if Mr. Steele had not interposed and sent the lad to his work; remarking to his honourable friend, who understood very httle of what the lad had said \u2014 \" That it appeared he"], [200, "192 THE VICISSITUDES had still better clothes on yesterday, but his mother, for some reason or other, had not allowed him to put them on that day.\" \" A kind, motherly woman I have no doubt,\" was the rejoinder. \" What a plague her son must be to her.\" The cottages of the workpeople were next inspected. If a stranger had passe<_ Lazy Row, for so it was called, a day 01 two before this visit took place, he would have remarked that the name was any thing but appropriate. Never within the memory of the most frequent passer had it exhibited such a picture of female in dustry. The floors of the rooms had been well cleaned, and the furniture scrubbed and rubbed, probably for the first time; for it was well known that more sand and soap had been consumed on that day, than any previous one since the row was first inhabited. Be that as it may, all was clean and orderly; whilst the savoury odours emitted by the bacon,"], [201, "OF COMMERCE. 193 and other things preparing for the mid day meal, were so inviting, that the honourable gentleman partook of a rasher off a polished pewter dish; this afforded no small amusement to the lookers on, who were in the secret. It was these \" facts,\" not brought for ward as mere statements, but from his own ocular proof, that the honourable gentleman, from his place in the House, startled his fellow-legislators and the country with one of the most eloquent and convincing speeches delivered in op position to the Ten Hours Bill. The measures resorted to by Mr. Steele soon began to embarrass his victim, Mr. Marsh, who found it necessary to obtain a further advance of money. The inter view he solicited for this purpose took place at the private office of Messrs. Robbson and Steele. Nothing could ex ceed the polite manner in which the junior partner of the firm received Mr. Marsh, for he had been informed by letter of the VOL. I.

After many kind inquiries as to the health of Mrs. Marsh and her daughters, business was proceeded with. \"We have received your letter,\" said Mr. Steele, \" and shall be glad to accom modate you with a small sum. Me and my partner was saying, only the other day, we wished we had some good investment for a little matter we have to spare.\" \" What I want at present,\" said Mr. Marsh, \" is so little, that I might draw upon the stock for a few hundreds \u2014 a thousand or so.\" \" I think, sir, you will not have much to draw upon there.\" \" You forget the two thousand bundles, Mr. Steele, \u2014 those we sent in the other day.\" \" You shall see how we stand, sir.

And what the d\u2014 1 right had that is, a \u2014 I meant to say, it would have been as well if you had consulted us before taking this step.\" Mr. Steele was losing his temper; for great indeed was his vexation upon hearing this unlooked-for announcement. What would his partner think about it? To be so soon overreached \u2014 fairly rooked in the month, \u2014 and that, too, by a man like Mr. Marsh. Such a thing had never before occurred during the whole of his career. Mr. Robbson must not be made acquainted with the circumstance at pre sent, but a further sum advanced, and the plans for the final crisis matured as soon as possible. One of the stipulations was, that a por tion of the money should be laid out in repairing the machinery; and another"], [206, "198 THE VICISSITUDES that a notice should appear in one of the newspapers, stating that the buildings, machinery, and other effects, were the property of Messrs. Robbson and Steele. This was drawn up in a legal form, so that any one doing business in future with Mr. Marsh would only have his per sonal security in the transaction. This hurt his pride more than anything which had yet taken place, for it showed the world how poor he was ; nor could he any longer conceal the state of his affairs from his wife. Mrs. Marsh received the communica tion with greater coolness than her hus band expected. She thought he had needlessly wounded her feelings by draw ing too gloomy a picture of his situation.

Let us now follow Jack Houghton, and observe how fortune has been dealing out her good or evil destinies for him and his family. The change in the worldly circumstances of the father was soon fol lowed by one, equally deplorable, in the moral characters of his children. The two oldest girls were now removed from the vigilant care and watchful eye of their late pastor ; and being thrown amid temptations, more numerous in the town than those by which they were assailed whilst living in the country, their virtues speedily gave way, obliterating every"], [209, "OF COMMERCE. 201 trace for the present of the reverend gentleman's teaching. Neither of the sisters could be con sidered pretty, or even interesting; but were good-humoured girls, with a word for every one, and always a ready retort or merry laugh, which made them uni versal favourites, not only with their female companions, but also with the young men, who delighted in having \" a bit of jaw,\" as they termed it, with the sisters. They were often supposed by strangers to be twins, from the great re semblance they bore to each other in sta ture, dress, and general appearance; but this was not the case. Their father had taken them to work for him as piecers; an employment quite un suited to the fancy of the girls, who were powerloom weavers; and being good workers and industrious, could earn from eight to twelve shillings per week each. And although the wages all went into the common fund, still there is an indefinable k3"], [210, "202 THE VICISSITUDES pleasure to all, especially to the young, to receive personally the recompence of their toil. But to have the spending of their week's earnings was a temptation irre sistible. The sum they knew would be amply sufficient to supply all their wants, both in maintenance and clothing; and so they would then have \" to find them selves;\" that is, leave home and live in lodgings ; and what was still better, would be the entire mistresses of their own ac tions. It required little to induce them to adopt a course that held out so many allurements: the change of employment afforded a pretext, and of this the sisters availed themselves. The very idea of such a project as this being seriously entertained by two young females would seem, to persons unac quainted with a factory population, too ridiculous to be regarded as credible ; but events of a similar nature being of daily occurrence, they elicit neither inquiry from their masters, nor surprise amongst"], [211, "OF COMMERCE. 203 their fellow workers. The young people reflected Httle upon the selfishness they evinced, and still less on the danger to be apprehended. The base ingratitude they were guilty of towards their parents never once crossed the minds of the two girls. The affections of the chUdren of but too many amongst us are early estranged; and through an entire neglect, or a too great severity, both father and mother soon lose all command over their off spring. And thus as the children cease to be dependent upon them for subsist ence, they become disrespectful, and leave the paternal roof without the slightest compunction being manifested. In a pecuniary point of view, the loss to Jack would be serious, and one he was Uttle prepared at the time to bear. But he had chiefly himself to blame ; for in stead of spending his wages in such a manner as to make the home of his children a happy one, he had passed all the spare hours at the beer-shop. Twenty"], [212, "204 THE VICISSITUDES shillings of his weekly earnings had, for many years, gone into the pocket of mine host of the village tavern. Yes, for years did he indulge in this expensive luxury ; until a lower rate of wages, and loss of credit, rather than the counsel Mr. Wynn was constantly pouring into his ear, brought about a slight reformation in his habits. Neither the threats nor persuasions of Jack availed to turn his daughters from their purpose. They each obtained work as weavers at a mill in the town, and lodged together in a street adjoining it. The younger one, whose name was Dinah, during the short time she worked at Mr. Marsh's mill, had been so un fortunate as to attract the attention of young Marsh. Her sister, who was con fidant in the affair, strongly urged her to repel his advances; but instead of so doing, she rather countenanced him, as it gratified her vanity, and caused the young man with whom \" she kept com-"], [213, "205 OF COMMERCE. pany \" to be more assiduous in his at tentions. To \" keep company with,\" is a mode of expression synonymous to that of \" being in love;\" but the latter term is never applied by the lower orders to that fond passion. For no one would have said that Tom Wright was in love with Dinah Houghton, but that he kept company with her. It might naturally be inferred that when the girls left their father's roof, young Marsh would cease to remember that Dinah had ever received any attention from him ; for attachments of this nature, unlike real affections, fade from the memory when the presence of the object that caused them is removed. And so it happened now : weeks passed over and they never met, untU at last Dinah, with some reluctance, consented to have the bans published, \u2014 which they were without delay, \u2014 Tom having by this time entirely got quit of his jealousy."], [214, "206 THE VICISSITUDES One Saturday evening he took his fair frail one to the singing-room frequented by young Marsh, who was at his ac customed seat in the bar. This was at one end of the room, and opposite to the stage; and through its being elevated a little above the other part of the floor, any one in it could distinguish, as well as be seen by, all in the place. Dinah had not been long in the room before her eyes met those of her forgetful admirer. Her foolish young heart fluttered with joy when he recognised her, and strolled to wards the seat she occupied. His gold studs and glittering rings soon banished poor Tom Wright from her mind ; and he, upon perceiving his com pany was not wished for, quietly left the place ; and the next morning went to the church to take down the bans. The clerk wished to know the reason why so sudden a change had taken place. His only answer was, \" aw rues.\" He was in formed that the bans would be asked out,"], [215, "OF COMMERCE. 207 but he might please himself whether he were married or not. The poor girl discovered, when too late, that she had slighted the man who could have made her happy, perhaps for life, to obtain a more specious but not lasting pleasure, by being the partaker, with others, of the dissembled affections of one above her in rank. The advice of her sister, too, came with less grace now than formerly: for she had become a mother very shortly after her marriage, which took place about that time. But Dinah thought it useless to repine ; and, therefore, continued to receive the atten tions of her false lover. Jack had not felt the full effects of his first rash step, or at least his mind dwelt little upon it, untU his children began to desert him. His eldest boy fol lowed the example of the girls, and ran away to Blackburn. He could not now, as formerly, get Mr. Wynn to reason with them ; though he thought at one time of"], [216, "208 THE VICISSITUDES requesting that gentleman to caU and speak to his children. His wife, however, objected to this course being adopted. \" Ah dunnot see,\" said the Avoman, \" a yo con ax him for t' cum, sin both ote wenches has begun ah gooin tut Ranters' chapel.\" So the girls had not only been allowed to leave the roof of their parents, though both father and mother must have well known what consequences would fol low, but were even wilfully deprived of the counsel of their old preceptor and guide, who would have esteemed it a pleasure to lead the wanderers back to the fold from which they had strayed. Jack's creditors became more importunate in proportion as the means of payment diminished. His wife advised him to take the two chUdren who were stUl unemployed into the mill, both of them being more than eight years of age. Her ostensible reason for this being that it would keep them out of the streets; but the real motive that urged her to it was to get them out of the way,"], [217, "209 OF COMMERCE. so that they might not interfere with her domestic arrangements. The sugges tion was accordingly acted upon, and the chUdren admitted into the miU \" as short timers,\" that is, they worked six hours each day, and likewise attended school. The improvidence of the parents feU upon the shoulders of the poor infants, who were compelled, thus early, to com mence a life of toil. Though we shall confess, after a review of what they so frequently witnessed at home, for it will be interesting to folloAV their mother through a few days' occupations and amusements, that if the habits of the children were not already formed, they would be less likely to contract that worst bane of the working man, idleness, at the mill than under the roof of their parents. Those members of the family employed at the mill rose at half-past five o'clock, and before going out made the fire. The female head of the house continued to"], [218, "210 THE VICISSITUDES enjoy her bed until she had barely suffi cient time left in which to make the oat meal porridge for breakfast, and some times not even that. And as only half an-hour was aUowed for that meal, punc tuality ought to have been imperative. But it was not so ; a crust of bread being very frequently all the chUdren could get. My lady, however, was not so easily satis fied : often, between nine and ten o'clock, she might be seen seated at a table covered with unwashed porringers, whUst an egg shell, or a rind of bacon gave indications of better fare than that partaken of by the rest of the family. On Thursday or Friday, as most con venient, or least idle, she commenced her washing ; a day towards the close of the week being her favourite time for that scene of domestic discomfort. Her work did not begin until the forenoon was weU advanced, consequently when Jack and the children returned to the mid-day meal, instead of finding dinner ready and"], [219, "211 OF COMMERCE. the wife and mother anxiously waiting their return, they found her up to the elbows in soap suds; which, through her unskilfulness, had been dashed on every side, until the floor was so flooded that the water ran off it into the street. The place reeked with steam, which rose in clouds up the stairs; where, as the windows were closed, it fell in the_shape of moisture on the bed-clothes. It wUl be natural to suppose she got weU abused for this ; and was more punc tual at the tea-hour, or \" baggin,\" as they termed it. The tea or coffee, which ever it might be, was sent to the mUl about four o'clock in small cans. This duty devolved upon the chUdren when they were at home. In the evening the family either remained out late, or retired early to bed, as the place in which they Kved was hung round with half-washed, half- dried clothes, and therefore in a state of discomfort and utter confusion. This was the manner in which the washing-day"], [220, "212 THE VICISSITUDES was spent ; those in the early part of the week were passed by this exemplary wife, with a little variation, something in the following way.

The rattling of these, and the jingUng of copper, might then be heard above the voices and laughter of the party. For, as the visits of the child for the exhilarat ing beverage became more numerous, so did the merriment of the party increase. Some children generally followed their mothers into the house, and hung about the table, hearing aU that was said, and picking up the stray halfpence, in order to get sufficient to admit them into the singing-room, when not taken there by their parents, though this was frequently done. For on the evenings of these merry-makings, Jack, tired as he must have been A\\-ith his twelve hours' Avork, Avas often persuaded by his wife to take the children and herself there; where we will accompany them, and see if it Avas a proper place for females or children.

These were terminated by the bar, or place of honour. It was comfortably carpeted, and very shoAvy, having a great quantity of mahogany and polished brass about it. This attractive little spot was presided over by two or three well-dressed and interesting looking young females, whose care it was to supply the Uquor which increased, instead of allaying, the thirst of the assembled multitude.

This Avas an Act which had been looked forward to, not only by the present generation of factory opera tives, but by the preceding ones, who had sunk into untimely graves, toiling, but toiling in vain, though hoping to the last for that consummation, which was only to be attained by their children, or children's children.

That the legislature were blamable for Avithholding this boon so many years, few are now prepared to deny. It had long been avoAved, though few really credited the assertions, that the factory operatives, almost to a single individual, were prepared to sacrifice two hours' Avages to obtain a proportionate amount of rest. The patience and per severance displayed so pleased their true friends, at the head of whom was Lord Ashley, (a name that ought to be revered by eATery mill Avorker in the kingdom, and handed down from father to son to re motest posterity), that they became proud of the cause ; and, by standing promi nently forAvard, a victory was obtained, the triumphant reward of their united efforts. l2"], [228, "220 THE VICISSITUDES The rejoicings, though universal, were to many hearts saddened by a report Avhich had for some time been gaining credence. It Avas to the effect that the provisions of the neAV Act could be evaded. This had not been heard of whilst the Commons were passing the Bill ; it was only hinted at during the discussion in the Lords, or Avhispered about before the Royal assent was given. But no sooner Avas the signature of our gracious sove reign attached to it, than a few mill owners announced to their hands the unwelcome intelligence, that their engines would con tinue to run twelve hours, as usual. Loud was the outcry of the operatives ; the inspectors and magistrates Avere ex horted to be vigilant in their duty. But as they could conceive no device by Avhich the law might be evaded, they flattered themselves it was only a little bravado of the opposition, to cover the defeat they had sustained. The Bill limited the hours of labour to"], [229, "OF COMMERCE. 221 eleven, for females and young persons, until the May of 1848, when the real ten hours measure came into operation.

The case of the operatives Avorking for the latter class of masters may be thus illustrated : a poor man, Avhose ancestors have been deprived of a valuable estate, resolves to dispute the possession of it Avith the noAV wealthy occupier.

But his joy is short lived : the lawyers inform him that his opponent is a bankrupt, and that the estate wiU not be sufficient to liquidate the expenses of the suit, and so at once commence suing him for the rest. He is consequently in a much worse position than before obtaining the judgment. So Avas it Avith some of the poor factory workers. For, instead of their long con tested BiU reducing the tAvelve hours labour to ten, it was the very means of increasing them to thirteen. It may be said their Avorking with these masters was optional on the part of the men; if they did not Uke the plan of working their children by \" relays,\" let them go"], [231, "OF COMMERCE. 223 to some other mUl where the system had not been adopted.

Mr. Marsh was one of the few that commenced on the new system of \"re lays.\" This was not done by his advice, for the disadvantages attendant upon it at once presented themselves to him, but by order of Mr. Steele. That gentleman had strained eveiy nerve, as we have seen, to prevent the Bill passing; and as the signatures of the hands at the mUl had been placed to a petition against the measure, they were informed that their names were not to be appended to any other on penalty of dismissal.

This galled Mr. Steele exceedingly at the time : but as he could not AveU carry his threat into execution, he restrained his wrath for a little Avhile, resolving to take ample revenge when an opportunity offered itself: the present one Avas, there fore, seized upon. The schemes resorted to for violating the intention of the neAV Bill, though not exactly similar, aU tended to the same end. The one adopted at Mr. Marsh's mill, was this \u2014 for eA7ery eleven females, or young persons, an extra hand was employed. The eleven commenced work as usual, at six o'clock ; at seven o'clock one of them was sent out of the mill, and the twelfth, or relay hand, noAV came in to take her place.

Thus the engine ran twelve"], [233, "OF COMMERCE. 225 hours, but the females, individually, only Avorked eleven. And by augmenting the number of relays, the Avorking hours of the adults could be increased to the ex tent of their power of endurance. The glaring abuses fostered by this system, Avere sufficient to convince any one, not blinded by prejudice, or actuated by sordid motiA^es, of its evil tendencies. The shift-hand might not be so skilful a Avorker as the one Avhose place she had temporarily supplied; and as her interest was not a tithe in eaeh case, a degree of carelessness ensued, causing endless dis putes as to Avhom the blame of the spoiled Avork Avas to be attached ; and creating a rancorous spirit amongst those who had previously Avorked together as friends.

Her image had, by de grees, been taking possession of his mind untU it displaced every other, and that too, before he was conscious of her having obtained any ascendancy over him. Nor was it until he became fully persuaded of Maria's silent, though unmistakable wish that they should not meet, which caused a suspicion of some object dearer than himself being already in possession of her heart, that he became fully aware of his position. Harassed by contending emo tions he resolved to combat with his affec tion, and by gaiety and a change of scene, endeavour to obUterate the remem-"], [238, "230 THE VICISSITUDES brance of Maria from his thoughts. It required little reflection to convince him that Mr. Morland would not consent to his forming a connexion with one so much their inferior in station.

The visits he paid to Mrs. Marsh's drawing-room assemblies became more frequent ; so much so, indeed, as to cause that lady, as we have already seen, to make sure of him as the suitor of her daughter Ann.

She could not restain her emo tion, \u2014 but rose, and when the old man ceased speaking, hurried to her smaU chamber and there indulged her grief, too strong for control, and we might almost say too sacred for human eye to witness.

But the struggle it occasioned her told too plainly that hers had not been a mere transitory affection, \u2014 a mere acquaintanceship to be formed and broken off at pleasure. This occurred on a Sunday e\\Tening, and the gloom of a March night was fast hiding distant objects from view, before Maria became aware that she had spent an hour in her chamber, and was afraid lest the old people might be wailing for her : for, after the eA'euing repast, Maria, when their reverend A-isitor Avas not at the lodge, would cheer them by her con versation, or by reading a few chapters from the bible. She accordingly en deavoured to hide all traces of sadness, aud AA-as descending Avhen she heard the sound of carriage Avheels on the gravel road.

But his fears vanished the moment his eyes met those of Maria, when she ap peared at the lattice Avindow. There she remained an instant, as if fascinated.

Often during that evening spent at Mr. Marsh's, did he contrast in his mind the infinite superiority of the unadorned loveliness and sweet temper of Maria, over the gor-"], [243, "OF COMMERCE. 235 geously arrayed, but proudly beautiful Ann Marsh.

He exhorted her to Usten to his counsel, and be guided by him in eA'ery thing. And to put it Avithin her power to leave the mUl at any time she chose, he enclosed a bank of England note for one hundred pounds. The letter he placed in her bible ; and left the country Avithout again seeing her.

This is a feeling only to be fully appreciated by those who, whilst young, have, through the inscrutable decrees of Providence, been deprived of that most inestimable of all God's gifts to man, a parent's love. Mr. Wynn deferred the first interview a few days, in order to aUow his young charge a little time to calm her agitated mind. The Friday of the week he chose for his visit Avas Good Friday, on the anni versary of which Mr. Morland always closed his mills, even before the law com pelled him to do so.

He had not, until then, mentioned the subject which he knew to be uppermost in the thoughts of his fair companion; but noAV that they were alone, he addressed her in a tone so mUd and encouraging, as at once to convince her that the good man's heart was with her. \" I have been thinking, very seriously, my dear girl,\" said he, \" about the unex pected change that has so suddenly taken place in your prospects, promising you so great an addition of worldly happiness.

He communi cated his plans to Maria, who quite dis approved of them. \" You would certainly be folloAved,\" said she, \" and brought back.

Yet the mere fact of his having formed such a resolution was a far deeper source of anxiety to his sister than the precarious state of her health. But this annoyance was, for a time, removed when the Ten Hours BUI became the law of the land. EdAvin had now two hours each evening to devote to instruction or amusement. He undertook to teach a few of the young men the game of cricket, a recreation hitherto unknoAvn amongst them, \u2014 Satur- day having been the only evening during which they could have enjoyed that, or any other out-of-door exercise.

Maria wUUngiy complied with a wish Mr. Wynn ex pressed, that she should take the superin tendency of the school on one of these nights. She found her pupils almost entirely ignorant of the very simplest work of the seamstress. Few who had been brought up in the miU could either sew neatly or read Arith anything ap proaching fluency. Aided by her re verend friend, hoAveATer, she entered upon the pleasing task. It fell to her lot to teach, not only \"the young idea,\" but also those of riper years, an art with which every child of the female sex ought to be famUiar. The kind way in which she performed this duty was far from creating a feeling of envy against her, \u2014 so opposite was it to that of the paid mistress, Avho attended on the other even ing. There was no display of superiority, she treated all as equals; consequently, all shared in her oavii enthusiasm \u2014 paying"], [261, "253 OF COMMERCE. her more respect than they had ever before done to any one in their OAvn station of life. But, what afforded her the most gratification was the pleasure Mr. Wynn expressed at the success attendant upon her endeavours; and by this alone she thought herself more than repaid. Once, and sometimes tAvice a month, letters Avere received from India; and amongst them was always one, or more, for the Parsonage, under cover of which Frank corresponded Avith Maria. His letters to her expressed the unabated ardour of his love ; whilst those addressed to his reverend friend were filled Avith anxious fears, such as a man Avould com municate to him in whose care he had placed the most precious of his worldly effects.

The day was extremely hot, but that did not prevent us from being early on the ground. The feAv solitary horse men that had already arrived, were busied rubbing the dust from off themselves and their beasts, when our attention AAras attracted by the approach of an immense concourse of people, in the midst of Avhich we perceived a number of carts filled with the aspirants for martial fame, an arrangement having been made between the officers and privates, that those men who could not, or dared not, ride their horses to the field, should be taken there in carts : this was a novel scene. Among"], [294, "286 THE VICISSITUDES those who were afraid to trust them- selves on horseback, unless they had a soft sod to faU upon in case of accidents, was this Taylor.

His mother was excessiA-ely proud of her son's warrior- Uke appearance; and re- solved to be present upon his first essay in arms, in order that she might witness his being created a captain at least, before the day Avas over. When the carts arrived on the ground a cup of beer was served out to each man preparatory to mounting. A long time was then spent in an ineffective attempt to form line.

The shock of the previous September had been too severe and too widely felt for so speedy a revival of such times as the years forty-four and five. The excitement died aAvay, leaving the minds of the manufacturing commu nity more depressed than before; for it convinced all \u2014 even the most sanguine \u2014 that years must lapse before a steady trade could be again established. Mr. Steele's mind was strongly imbued Avith this opinion, and he began to feel rather alarmed about Mr. Marsh's affairs. The trade articles in the newspapers afforded him little consolation : for though he trusted more to his own practical knowledge of the market rather than to these accounts, stUl there were many with whom they had great influence ; and, as there was not one word of encouragement in them, so they naturaUy caused a deeper"], [301, "OF COMMERCE. 3 gloom to overspread men's minds.

But this came sooner than they had calculated upon. The hours of work had been reduced from thirteen each day to six; and, in addition to this, the machinery was frequently at a stand for want of the raw material. Nothing could exceed the astonishment of the workpeople Avhen the latter event took place. It forewarned them, as plainly as language could have done, of Avhat they had to expect. A report had been Avhispered amongst them that all Avas not right; but, judging from outward appear ances, they concluded that as the mill Avas running such long hours, their master must be making money. It Avas not the stoppage, but the cause of it, that opened their eyes to the real state of his affairs. The sympathy expressed Avas not great, his recent infringement of the Ten Hours Bill having made him one of the most"], [304, "6 THE VICISSITUDES unpopular masters in the tOAvn, and all his misfortunes were, of course, imputed to that. The state of his workpeople was a truly deplorable one; for, in addition to the exorbitant rents and heavy rates, there was the high price of provisions, consequent upon the potatoe famiuc and other concurrent circumstances. Jack Houghton's earnings were barely suffi cient to keep starvation from the door, the family subsisting principally on oat meal porridge, for no assistance could be obtained from the parochial authorities. There were now no afternoon merry meet ings, for if the husbands had not been at home a great portion of the day, their wives would still have been prevented from as sembling through the Avant of money, though many of them yet found sufficient wherewith to visit the singing-room.

The unfortunate gentleman Avas accordingly made a bankrupt, but he intimated his intention to oppose the ap propriation by his creditors of the money so disposed of, under the plea of solvency at the time of the transaction. Messrs. Robbson and Steele, anxious to allay, by any means, the clamours raised against them, asserted themselves to have been creditors for a large amount at that period, and so at once upset the plea.

The landed estate and mansion Avere soon bought on very advantageous terms by Messrs. Robbson and Steele, who after- Avards sold them, netting a much larger sum than the amount of their mortgage.

But this reckless proceeding caused the countenances of many who had worked for Mr. Marsh to display a grief which, perhaps, even the death of one however dear to them, might not haA-e caUed forth. Oue of the persons most affected was an elderly woman of the name of Hayes.

This Avoman, though barely fifty years of age, would have been taken, judging by her appearance, for one at least ten years older; and in stature was tall and remarkably spare, Avith hard and haggard features. She was assisting to take in pieces a jenny-frame, upon Avhich the labour of the previous thirty years of her life had been spent, \u2014 working seldom less than sixty-nine, and often eighty hours per week.

But this plan was dismissed Avithout much discus sion, being found impracticable. The other suggestion, of exchanging salt for rags, appeared to afford a better chance of success, as the total outfit requisite Avould consist of a wheelbarrow (an old one might do, and could be bought for very little), a bag of salt, and a pair of scales.

In the midst of this dUemma, which caused the abandonment of this scheme also, Dinah placed her child in its grand mother's lap, and, throwing a shaAvl OA'er her head, left the cellar. She hurried through the streets, and took the road leading tOAvards Mr. Morland's mills. A thought had flashed across her mind. \" If Mr. Wynn only knowed, he'd do summut for us.\" Her heart almost mis gave her when admitted into the presence of the reverend gentleman.

What is the melancholy tale your hoUow cheeks relate?\" Now Dinah Avas no heroine, for she cried like a chUd whUst relating her story, which she did without exaggeration, teU ing the truth, but, unfortunately, not the whole truth.

He passed through most of the principal streets of the town without meeting any compe titors; but, at the same time, without doing much business. Disheartened Avith the little success attendant upon his day's toil, he returned to his cheerless abode, resolving to try the back streets the fol lowing day.

The India mail of the 17th of February, brought the usual number of letters for Mr. Morland; but not one addressed5 to the Parsonage. This was the first time Frank had permitted a post to leave Avith out adding to the contents of its bags a letter for his reverend friend.

Now this amused Mr. Mor- land not a little, following, as it did, im- mediately after a highly draAvn eulogy upon the wit and beauty of a young lady named Maranda Grey, who, with her father, an officer in the East India Com- pany's service, were to be Frank's travel- ling associates. For having satisfactorily concluded his business affairs, he Avas on the point, when his letter Avas Avritten, of leaving Calcutta for the interior of the country.

Each post was now expected to bring the Avelcome iicavs. The business letters came Avith their accustomed punctuality, but none from Frank. This Mr. Morland easily accounted for to his friend, by supposing the letters might have been detained in the interior, until too late for the present mail, his agent having informed him that his son had left Calcutta.

Nor was she the only one who indulged in these melan choly reflections: Mr. Morland became seriously alarmed for his son's safety. For though he had had many conversa tions with his friend on the subject, vet neither of them regarded the two first omissions as being of much importance. Young people when travelling, and sur rounded with novel objects, opening up innumerable sources of enjoyment, seldom devote much time to correspondence.

Mr. Morland instructed"], [346, "48 THE VICISSITUDES his agent to make every inquiry possible for tracing his son's movements.

Most of the females had assembled near the scene of the accident, but Maria remained at her place. The first shock over she was about to leave the room; but before doing so, ranged her eyes along it to find EdAvin. She could not see him. Is it he?

The shrieks and groans of the females, previously deadened by the noise of the machinery, now rose on every side, as im potent as they were unmeaning to those who, though silently, were better em ployed.

In the meantime a few of the young Avomen were attempting to restore Maria to consciousness. They had got a Uttle water, and having loosed her dress, which came high up to the neck, bathed her temples and forehead with it. The sym metry of form and countenance of the lifeless girl drew forth exclamations of admiration from those around her. \" WeU,\" remarked one, \" if hoo is'ent bonniest wench as ere ha seed.\" \" Ay,\" rejoined another, \" hoos a graidly pratty face ; hoos moor likert one ote gentlefolk tell a factory lass; an I'st neer believe but what hoos bin among um nother, for hoos so Aveel spokken.\""], [383, "OF COMMERCE. 85 \" Go \u2014 look, wenches,\" said a young woman, not remarkable for the purity of her dress nor the cleanliness of her per son; \"a yo dun but talk; hoos nobbut a brokken dane mante-maker fro one oth' warkhases; hoos too prim for't be out else.\" Poor Maria's ear was happily closed to these and many similar remarks; and a deep sigh, warning the by-standers that reason was about to resume her deserted seat, hushed every voice. Gently opening her eyes, she raised them with such an imploring gaze to the face of the female on whose lap she reclined, that the last speaker felt she had given utterance to language which her heart told her was false. \" Is he alive ?\" said she, in an almost inaudible Avhisper. \" Hi, he's noan deod yet,\" was the reply; \"but ha yerd um say a bit sin when I wer speerin abate, as they'd welly"], [384, "86 THE VICISSITUDES lefer heed deed afore they'd tan him dane, it's made such a mash on him.\" Comforters like these, under whose care Maria found herself, were not likely to im part much consolation. But the knowledge that her brother stUl lived acted as a most poAverful restorative ; and having, in some degree, regained her wonted compo sure, she was on the point of going to him Avhen Mr. Wynn entered the room. The reverend gentleman was much dis tressed when he learnt the name of the sufferer ; for he had hastened to the spot immediately upon hearing of the accident, little imagining to Avhom his service of love was to be rendered. \" And poor Maria,\" thought he, \" her sorrows were many before, God knows, but his avUI be done.\" He overruled her purpose of seeing EdAvin, under the plea that it would excite him : but promised to have him conveyed to the Lodge, if Mr. Leach"], [385, "87 OF COMMERCE. thought he could be removed so great a distance without increased danger. The surgeon's report, after examining the unfortunate youth, was, that he had sustained a compound fracture of the left arm and tAvo fingers of the hand, a frac ture of the right thigh, besides many other bruises and contusions; but judg ing from the general appearance of the patient, he felt confident no internal injury had been produced. And it was this alone that afforded a slight ground for hope, that by constant medical attend ance and good nursing his Use might eventuaUy be spared.

And thus the occupa- tions of mind and body tended to banish from her mind any reflections on her OAvn forlorn and helpless state. Nor was it until she returned into the sick room, and the heavy breathing of her brother indi- cated sleep, that a thought of self crossed her mind.

Maria's loAvly station might, perhaps, have de barred the lady from forming a close intimacy, especially as the leading points of her history, her attachment to Frank Morland, and her subsequent desertion by him, were, up to the present time, unknoAvn to her.

Maria having left her employment a short time before the mill stopped, had put off her Avorking attire, as Avas her custom, and after assuming a neat eATening dress seated herself by the side of EdAvin's couch, for it was there she spent most of her leisure hours, seAving, or reading aloud to him. He Avas noAV reported out of danger ; the inflammation had subsided, and every thing progress favourably. This happy event was attributed by Mr. Leech mainly"], [393, "OF COMMERCE. 95 to the robust health his patient enjoyed at the time the accident happened, and which had been acquired Avhilst on his runaway excursion. The rays of the declining sun were partiaUy obscured by a slight mist; but as they fell upon the countenance of the youthful sufferer, they appeared to im part a cheerfulness to his features, such as Maria had not before obserA'ed. She had been reading aloud that beautiful and now appropriate song, one of the sweet Psalmist's most divine compositions, commencing, \" Bless the Lord, 0 my soul; and aU that is Avithin me, bless His holy name.\" When the music of her \\-oice died away, she remained watching, noiselessly as a mother hanging over the cot of her first born, a gentle slumber that was steaUng slowly over him. Upon perceiAing that he slept, she placed the hand which she"], [394, "96 THE VICISSITUDES held in her OAvn by his side, and, raising her head, found that they were not alone. She rose to greet her reverend friend, supposing it to have been he ; but it was not. No! Frank Morland stood at her side ; his manly countenance beaming Avith joy. The moment his presence Avas dis covered, he clasped Maria to his heart, and imprinted a kiss upon those lips on which, many weary months before, he had sealed a vow that bound him to regard his love as sacred as his Use ; a love which nothing but death was to dissolve. Had he forgotten this? Maria was told he had. Overcome by surprise and contending emotions, she had not the power to resist Frank's sudden movement. But almost instantaneously she disengaged herself from his embrace, and addressing him, said, with a dignity she had never as sumed, \" Mr. Morland, at one time I"], [395, "97 OF COMMERCE. thought you to be a gentleman and a man of honour, but such conduct as this little becomes any one who esteems either of those titles as worth retaining.

Maria repented having spoken so harshly, Avhen she saw the change her words had produced in him who a feAv minutes be fore appeared to be in the enjoyment of the choicest gifts that nature can bestow, health and hope. But now he resembled some poor shipAvrecked mariner, that, utterly helpless himself, sees all he holds most dear perishing before his eyes. \" Oh, sir,\" said she, \" forgive me if I"], [397, "99 OF COMMERCE. have said anything that displeases you.

A strange sort of joyous feeling possessed me when I remembered that the narration of all I saw, and even all I thought, whilst absent, might one day afford pleasure to those from whom I had just parted.

But as well might it be imagined, that a serpent is reverenced by the bird it charms, as that a single spark of love ever formed a part of the passion I felt for Maranda Gray. I had been as a lone wanderer, long contemplating a star that appeared to me the most lovely of aU the sparkling throng ; when suddenly a meteor dashes across the heavens, and the whole is illuminated by its intense glare, a bril liancy which blinds the beholder. When my vision is restored, I look around, but the meteor has already disappeared, \u2014 vanished as quickly as it came.

Well; after about a month's preparation, we left Calcutta with a fleet consisting of three boats, each pulling sixteen oars, manned by tAventy natives ; and, in addition to these, there Avere the attendants' and cooking boats. Our party had been again in creased by a number of friends, among whom were two young ladies about Maranda's age ; these persons were going into the country on business, or in quest of pleasure, and together we formed a goodly company. The tediousness of ascending the river was enliA^ened by the boisterous mirth and the hilarity of our spirits upon being released from the hot streets of Calcutta. No one was merrier"], [456, "158 THE VICISSITUDES than Maranda; wheresoever her graceful form was seen, there might also be heard the sounds of gaiety. She was named the Queen of the party, and had homage paid to her accordingly. When any had a petition to ask, he had the privUege of kissing hands. This brought numerous suppliants to the foot of the throne; and among them, very frequently myself. A sort of madness appeared to possess me. My vivacity had obtained for me the office of Master of the Revels ; and although it seemed the perfection of happiness, I was never more truly mise rable. Upon reaching Allahabad, we found a convoy, with military stores, awaiting the arrival of Colonel Gray, and with which he was to proceed up the river. As this would cause our progress to be very slow, it was agreed upon by a few of the party to abandon the boats, and, leaving the river, advance westward"], [457, "OF COMMERCE. 159 as far as time would allow, and so join our friends again, either at Agra or Delhi. Maranda was an exceUent horse woman, and it required little persuasion to induce her and her youthful female companions to join us. This would appear to an English lady, Avho had not been out of her own country, a breach of female delicacy and decorum ; but in India these things are not outwardly observed with the same strictness as at home : we were beyond the bounds of etiquette; and, as we galloped over the plateau of Malwa, we lived only for the hour, and cared not sor the morrow. On the evening of the tenth day after our departure from Allahabad, we found our tents pitched amongst the ruins of what had once been a large town, \u2014 the wars of the native princes having, many years before, devastated that part of the country. The transactions of that evening are more"], [458, "160 THE VICISSITUDES strongly impressed on my memory than any other events of my life, with one single exception. The moon was at full, and shone, not as she shines to the in- habitants of northernly climes, but with a light the very atmosphere of love. I had wandered Avith our fair companion through the ruins; and as we discoursed about the scene and of the Avreck that lay around us, our thoughts were gradually draAvn into a more solemn strain than we had ever before used. Maranda neA'er ap- peared so charming as at that moment. She Avas reclining on the square shaft of a faUen column, and listening, apparently, Avith an eager attention to my conversa- tion. A loud laugh, however, which the stUlness of the night bore along to us from the tents, dispeUed the grave thoughts of my companion. ' We can hear owls hoot among ruins at home, without coming to India to listen to them,' said she, and,"], [459, "161 OF COMMERCE. With that, bounded off to join the giddy pleasures of the rest of the party. Never, during my A\\diole life, have I formed a durable friendship with any one AAdio could not devote an occasional hour to something more Avorthy of our nature than mere worldly pleasure or idle con versation. The constant thirst after gaiety sIioaati by Maranda Gray had not until then struck me in its fuU truth. Lost in reflections like these, I remained seated on the same spot till sleep over powered me ; and in this state Avas found by my faithful Abdullah. This man, formerly a Mussulman, had become a con- Arert to Christianity, and a more faithful sen^ant man neArer had. Feeling unwell, I retired to rest, and from that time I have not seen my companions. TAvelve days elapsed from the evening I last men tioned before I became conscious of Avhat had passed. A fever, accompanied by"], [460, "162 THE VICISSITUDES occasional fits of delirium, deprived me of the powers of reason; when that, how ever, returned, I found myself in a ruined tomb, and attended only by AbduUah and a venerable old man, who I afterwards discovered to be a Parsee. He had the mildest and most benign expression of countenance I ever remember to have seen; his smile it was first greeted my returning consciousness. But when I endeavoured to speak, he placed his finger on my lips and shook his head, frowning at the same time ; thus intimating that I must be sUent. In this state I continued a couple of weeks, hanging between life and death, not having the power to speak, and scarcely even to think; for memory itself seemed to be overcome by the force of the disease, until one morning, \u2014 I well remember it, for though the tomb was in the deep shade of a jungle, and surrounded by trees of immense height, stiU the"], [461, "OF COMMERCE. 163 poAverful rays of the sun had penetrated the leafy cloud, and driven, not only animals, but even the very insects to seek coolness by a cessation from action, \u2014 as my eye wandered along the margin of a pool near to the spot where we were, it rested, not with the vacant gaze it had so long assumed, but with a steadfast look, upon a pair of birds, which I after wards discovered to be Indian bulbuls. The plumage of these birds is very elegant, the head and neck are white, the back intermediate feathers on the tail yellow, terminating in brUliant blue; the Avings white and ultramarine blue, the quills of them, as of the tail, being tipped with black. One of the birds seemed as though it had just escaped from the talons of some bird of prey; Avith his head almost buried in his ruffled feathers, he presented a most melancholy appearance. The other, on the contrary, sat pluming her wings,"], [462, "164 THE ATICISSITUDES and often stretched out her neck, as if elate with pride, and never deigned to notice her mate. Presently, when the air became a little cooler, a flock of bulbuls settled on the boughs of an adjoining tree. No sooner did the hale bird hear their chattering, than, with a cry of delight, she flew to join them, without giving even a farewell peck at her forlorn companion. During the time I had been watching the birds, I Avas alone; and, when AbduUah came to me I addressed him, asking wdiat had become of my friends? Instead of answering me, hoAveA^er, he ran off at full speed and shortly returned, accompanied by the Parsee. I repeated my question, when my servant, who speaks English AveU, said, that they had left the same morning I was taken ill ; but that, being yet in great danger, I Avas not to speak. But if not allowed to utter Avords, my thoughts I could not restrain. I had"], [463, "OF COMMERCE. 165 been left then in the jungle to die like a dog, or be devoured by beasts of prey. This led me to think of the poor deserted bird ; I pointed to it, shoAving, as AVell as I could, that I wished to have it. Ab dullah ran and brought it to me, and sprinkling a little Avater upon it, revived it. He set to Avork the same day and constructed a Avicker cage, in Avhich he placed it, and hung it outside the tomb, in order that I might amuse myself by watching its motions. One day my atten tion was attracted by the plaintive notes of a bird that had settled immediately over our little captive's prison house. At first I thought it was the same that had left its mate a few days before ; but I soon found it was another bird. Ab dullah opened the door of the cage, wdien the stranger sailed round two or three times, as if to prolong her joy. After a little Avhile she flew away, but presently"], [464, "166 THE VICISSITUDES returned with some food in her biU. What can this mean? thought I; this second bird is my own Maria, forgotten, but still true. Oh that I should, not for a moment only, but for weeks, yea, months, have ceased to remember that it was for her I had vowed to live, and die if needs were. But do not weep, Maria. The more intense the pain is, so much the greater will be the pleasure, when health is restored. I resolved to atone for my neglect by Avriting, when able, to my father, and inform him of my love. \" The next day Abdullah related what had passed since he found me asleep among the ruins ; how my companions, upon finding that I could not be moved, had left me ; taking along with them both my servants and baggage, himself alone remaining behind with two horses. All the instructions left were that as they should proceed slowly we might follow,"], [465, "OF COMMERCE. 167 and so overtake them during the day. But the part of the story that galled the most was that in which he related the behaviour of my fair countrywoman ; how she joined in the merriment, Avhen it was said, ' that I deserved Avhat I had got for attempting more than a griffin ought to accompUsh.' For though I was a griffin then, I was not one when I left India. My servant had a shght knowledge of the manner of treating the diseases of the country, and never left me during the day. EArening had no sooner cast its shades over the ruins than a band of Pin daries surrounded the smaU tent where I lay; springing up on aU sides, said Abdullah, as though the former inha bitants of the place had arisen from the dead to revenge upon us their massacre. No jackal scents his prey so far as the Indian robber his Arictim; and few are they who escape from him with their"], [466, "168 THE ArICISSITUDES lives. They took from us everything except the clothes we had on, and these the fever preserved to us, Abdullah having feigned likewise to be ill, and my purse, containing a feAv rupees, which he con trived to hide in the earth: death, they imagined, was so certain that they did not give themselves the trouble to hasten it. The next morning Abdullah met Avith the Parsee, who took me under his care ; re moving me to the ruined tomb in the jungle forest : and there, attended almost daily by my kind friend, I had remained up to that time without molestation. Haring found a piece of paper in my pocket-book, I Avrote with great difficulty those few unfortunate lines ; happy had it been if I had never done so. This was sent to the nearest station. But the exertion proved unfavourable to my recovery ; and my physician informed me 'that only one chance now remained by which my life"], [467, "OF COMMERCE. 169 could be saved, and this was by being conveyed as rapidly as possible to some sea port, from whence I could leave the country Avithout delay. Accordingly Ab dullah constructed a palanquin out of the stems and leafy branches of young trees. The little money my purse contained was sufficient for the hire of eight bearers ; but if any was reserved to remunerate the boat men on the river, I should then have no thing left except thanks for the presenter of my Use. He frankly assured me that if I had been possessed of as much wealth as Runjeet Singh, he would not have touched a single rupee. We were in motion a &av hours only in the morning and the same at eArening, for Ave rested during the heat of the day.

Soon after we arrived on its banks, we espied one of the flatbottomed boats, with the large lateen saUs peculiar to this part of India, shooting rapidly down the stream. A few bales of cotton, along Avith other merchandise, formed a portion of the freight. With these they contrived to build a sort of hut, in which I was laid. The excessive heat of the sun, together Avith the malaria it drew up from the marshy banks of the river caused a recur rence of the fever : and before we arrived at the sea I was again in a state of insen sibility. To the faithful attachment of my servant, once more, Avas I indebted for my life. He afterwards informed me, that upon reaching Broach I Avas removed into a boat just then starting for Bombay. After a tedious passage of several days duration they sighted the light at the"], [469, "171 OF COMMERCE. entrance of Bombay harbour, where they lay-to for the night. At the break of day they perceived, a feAV cables length off, a large ship under English colours ; and dis playing the blue flag at her mast-head. Abdullah thought this was an opportunity he must not let pass, and accordingly boarded her at once. Seeing an officer of the ship pacing the quarter-deck, he accosted him, saying he had an English gentle man ;n the boat that lay a short distance astern, whose life could be saved only by his being taken out to sea immediately. He then in a few Avords related my recent adventures and misfortunes, concluding by an earnest appeal to him to have com passion on his sick countryman. Such a request is seldom made to a British saUor in vain ; nor was it then. For, regardless of the danger, he commanded a boat to be lowered, and the Englishman fetched on board.

One version of the affair was that Frank had eloped Avith Maria, whilst"], [481, "183 OF COMMERCE. another stated that they had been pri vately married at the Parsonage. AU the old gossips of the Arillage called at the Lodge ; but Dame Hargreaves, weU aware that their object was curiosity and not sympathy, resolved not to gratify them ; and therefore pleaded ignorance. Cer tain it was that Maria was gone, and Frank had not been seen during the day. This gave great probabiUty to the first, or runaway story, which before night was universally believed. The surprise created among Mr. Mor land's Avorkpeople, at the sudden re appearance of their young master, was not greater than that caused by the mystery of Maria's conduct. Her Use having, hitherto, been so spotless, as to sUence the tongue of the envious, as well as the dissolute. But for these, this was the hour of triumph ; and with what zest do the giddy and loose, not only of the"], [482, "184 THE VICISSITUDES gay and educated throng, but also of the poor and iUiterate, seize upon that Avhich may appear a good opportunity to loAver the object of their envy to a level with themselves. In Maria's case this spirit of revenge, which her noble example of hoAV virtuous a life it is possible, for those Avho wish it, to lead even in a cotton mUl, had festered in many a female breast, and now broke forth Avithout restraint; Mr. Morland's temper in the matter being easily discernible. All her amiable qualities were set down as affectation, and her religion as hy pocrisy. Even Mr. Wynn came in for no small share of abuse, as the narration of the following remarks that passed be tAveen tAvo young women avIio had been Maria's fellow-workers avUI testify. \" Well, an what dun yo think abate Ria at th Lodge na? Ha toud yo afore ever he went off, as hur an't yung mes-"], [483, "185 OF COMMERCE. thur Avur thick, but yo nobbut louft at me.\" \" Why,\" rejoined her companion, \" ha should neer ho thout has hood ah had so mitch gaume abate hur, for't a done Avhat hoo has done.

Hool cuss as hard as onny on us when hoo comes tur wark again. Though sentiments similar to these were joined in by many, still there were some, and they more numerous than might have been expected, avIio took another vieAV of the affair. To these Maria had ever been a model of all that Avas good or true; and therefore they"], [484, "186 THE VICISSITUDES were not precipitate in their judgment. Nevertheless the unravelling of the mys tery was looked forward to by every one with constantly increasing impatience. Mr. Morland's passion abated nought of its violence when, by the departure of Frank and his reverend friend, he was left alone. He thought not then of the months of misery through which he had just passed, nor of the happiness he might have been enjoying in the SAveet com munion with his long lost son. The sub ject that entirely engrossed his mind was the degradation about to be brought upon him by that son. In this irritated spirit he issued the order for Maria's removal from the Lodge, and her dismissal from the miU. The whole of the following day was spent in a state of great anxiety of mind. Frank Avould be sure to tender his submission before its close. \" But,\" thought he, \" I shaU make it a stipulation"], [485, "187 OF COMMERCE. Avith him, that the name of this girl must not again pass his lips, and then I can embrace him as my son.\" These pleasing anticipations of a speedy reconciliation served to Avhile away the day. But as the \" swift winged hours\" glided by, and the sun disappeared behind the western hills, without his eyes being gladdened by the approach of the penitent, a few mis givings crossed his mind. \" He will come to-morrow.\" But the morrow came without Frank's advent, or any tidings of him. \" Surely he is not so mad as to act counter to my wish ; no, he cannot \u2014 he dare not do it!\" The thought was too absurd to entertain for a moment. But on the third day the thought was entertained; and the mere possibUity of it caused the passion, which had in some degree luUed, to again fill his mind. Nor could he rest until he had sent for the younger Hargreaves, to learn from him"], [486, "188 THE VICISSITUDES if anything was known. His worst fears were confirmed. The girl Avas gone, \u2014 no one knew Avhere ; and the very day after Frank's return, he and another gentleman Avere seen to leave the tOAvn by one of the railways. No doubt need now be enter tained : his son had taken the fatal step ; and nothing remained to complete the drama, but the carrying out the threat of disinheriting him. \" I know the Avorst,\" said he, \" and shall be happier Avhen that is done than I Avas a Aveek ago.\" He ordered his carriage at once, and drove to his solicitor's. Inquiring from one of the clerks if Mr. KenAvorthy Avas in his private office, he was informed that he left home in company with Mr. Frank Morland, \u2014 did not say where he was going, nor when he should be back. \" Verily,\" exclaimed Mr. Morland, in the bitterness of his anguish, \" this is the unkindest cut of aU. The oldest and"], [487, "189 OF COMMERCE. the best loved friends I had in the world are become the advisers of my son in his rebellion against me. Shakspeare, thou saidst the truth, though it is gall to human nature, Avhen thou saidst, ' Most friendship is feigning.' I can go stiU further than thou, and say all love is mere folly. But let them go, it will teach me not to rely upon friendship for happi ness.\" These reflections were philosophical, and might suit the creed of a hater of everything and everybody ; of one who is glad of an excuse to revile his fellow mortals, if only out of principle. But they Avere contrary to the nature of such a man as Mr. Morland, whose heart, in the midst of its haughtiness, yearned to be Avith his son. He Avould make one more effort to save him; \"for,\" he re flected, \" it was an aAvful thing to cast a son, and he an only one, into the world,"], [488, "190 THE VICISSITUDES if not Avith a father's curse upon, stUl Avithout a father's blessing. And if he did not succeed, then \u2014 yes, and what then?\" \u2014 He shuddered at the thought. There was only one man from whom he could hope to receive assistance; and that man he had branded Avith the appel lation of \"deceitful.\" Nevertheless, as great emergencies demand great sacrifices, he would even apologize for his language, if, haply, by so doing, a door might be opened for his son's escape. Accordingly, on the seventh clay since Frank's return, Mr. Morland walked over to the Parsonage. \" Howhumiliating is my position,\" thought he, \"to be thus compelled to seek the aid of the Arery man who has been a chief instrument in my chastisement. But I beUeve him to be sincere, and that he only wants convincing of his error to become as powerful an advocate in the cause of reason as he now is in that"], [489, "191 OF COMMERCE. of youthful rashness.\" Musing thus, he arrived at the house. Both the reverend gentleman and his lady Avere absent, but their return being momentarUy expected, Mr. Morland resolved to await it. Upon entering a room into which he was shoAvn, he unexpectedly found it tenanted, a young lady, to his no smaU astonishment, being seated at a smaU work-table, near the window. If Mr. Morland had suddenly been transported into the realms of Fairy-land, his surprise could not have been greater. He entered, unannounced, and his presence not being noticed, he felt a little embarrassed. This momentary pause, hoAveATer, gave him time to contemplate the countenance and general mien of his companion; she was, apparently, little more than twenty years of age ; her slender, graceful form offering a marked contrast to the stiff and clum sily constructed oak chair, a chair of"], [490, "192 THE VICISSITUDES olden days, in which she was seated. Her dress, of self coloured silk, was fashioned with an almost studied neatness, and re lieved by a small snowy coUar, that ap peared all the whiter from its close proximity to her jet black hair, which Avas neatly folded behind the ear, and then enthralled in unwilling bands; a single glossy ringlet had, however, escaped from the fillet and lay upon her shoulder, as though too proud to be restrained, conscious of its poAver to captivate. A painter would, perhaps, have pronounced the countenance to be a little too pale; but her deep abstraction of mind might in some degree account for this ; for though her lustrous eyes, shaded by their long lashes, rested on a book that lay open in her lap, yet neither it, nor the needleAvork she held in her smaU delicate hand, Avere in possession of her thoughts ; they had taken flight to other objects, and"], [491, "OF COMMERCE. 193 scenes far distant.

The sensations experienced by a dove when conscious that a bird of prey is hovering over her, might not inaptly be compared to those felt by the young lady, when her wandering spirit was brought back to its lovely tenement by Mr. Mor land's voice. \" Both Mr. Wynn and his lady are absent at present, I think, ma dam, are they not?\" said he, boAving. As she returned his salutation her strength fled, scarcely aUowing her to re gain, without stumbling, the seat from which she had risen.

With him lived an only sister, Avhose temper of mind was the ATery opposite to that displayed by her bro ther, his good nature being only feigned, for under it lay concealed a cruel and unfeeling mind.

It was customary for the hunt to meet on the lawn, before proceeding to cover ; and on the morning I have mentioned, about one hundred and fifty gentlemen and Avealthy yeomen of the neighbourhood had assembled. I sat a little way apart on my black palfrey, Avaiting the conclusion of the council they held as to the best cover to be beaten for the day's sport.

To Edwin and myself it was a Para dise; for our childish imaginations could not conceive anything more lovely; Jbut it was home, and so possessed a thousand endearments that many of us feel, but few can express. On one side of the horsemen were congregated the hounds, many of them being hidden from view, only their tails appearing above the brush-wood.

A bachelor, and fond of children, he regarded us with almost a parent's love. He came to take leave of me, duty prevailing over enjoy- ment. The ship he then commanded was a large one, chartered for China; and having sailed down the river, she was lying, weather bound, off Greenwich. He had taken advantage of this to spend the last days he would be in England with us. A sudden moderation in the weather had, however, induced him to depart for town in so abrupt a manner.

After a little beating, Reynard broke cover; and in stantly men and hounds swept away with the speed and noise of a hurricane. My father shook his friend by the hand, ' God bless you,' said he, ' I hope we shaU meet again soon.'

My father's last smile has never faded from my mind.

It was to be a final farewell for her, and a long and bitter separation for us. HoAvever, as the morning passed aAvay the sun broke forth, and our griefs Avere for a time almost forgotten ; Avhen, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the hunts man rode on to the laAvn, and asked to speak Avith my mother. His look was Avild and haggard; such as one might Avear avIio had just committed some foul deed. The instant my mother saw him, his strange appearance caught her atten tion, and filled her with apprehension: something had happened. Her first thought was for her husband.

The feelings of the wife overcame the timidity of the woman, and she flew to meet her husband, but was restrained from coming near the cart. \" 'What, is he dead?' she exclaimed. \" The silence of those around was her only answer.

The horse my father rode, though as SAvift as his favourite one, was not so good a leaper. With this circumstance Mr. Hawke was perfectly conversant, and knew also that whatever the horse he rode took, that my father was on would follow. He, leading a few yards, leaped over a deep wide sluice, one bank of Avhich Avas much higher than the other; my father followed almost instantaneously. He had seen the danger in time, but could not check the impetu osity of his horse, who only got his fore feet on the opposite bank, Avhen, unable to regain his balance, he feU back on his rider, and both rolled into the water.

The former part, that relating to the servants and tenantry, had been canceUed. The rest of the property, after paying an annuity to his widow, was devised to EdAvin and myself,- \u2014 Captain Hardy and my uncle being sole executors.

You may weU imagine the dismay with which we aU receiAred this dreadful inteUigence.

But, to accompUsh this, there were numerous and weighty obstacles to be encountered. My uncle had been the family soUcitor for many years, and was in possession of aU the papers and docu ments. The difficulty appeared too great to be undertaken Avithout the assistance of Captain Hardy. So the investigation was postponed until his return. At the expiration of a year, for that was about the length of time to AAmich his absence from England usuaUy extended, we began to look with anxious hearts for the arrival of his ship being announced.

Now, neither charity, justice, nor truth, were apparently to be served here, but their contraries; for many have been, and now are, suffer ing innocently.

Whether it was the melan choly state of my mind at the time that made me more susceptible of the solemn grandeur of that portion of the cathedral which we saw whilst passing through the city, or because I had never seen so large or magnificent a building before, I know not, but it remains impressed on my memory as distinctly as when I saw it that evening.

And since that evening some of the happiest, and many of the most contented hours of my Use have been spent at the Lodge. But though you know the rest I cannot refrain from narrating one circumstance connected with Edwin's accident. The morning after it had occurred, two of the workmen from the mUl came to the Lodge and asked to see me.

Though Maria was changed in form, her heart stUl retained its affections and innocence as pure as that day on Avhich she lost a parent and a friend. \" Is not this, indeed, a happy moment ?\" said she.

An Englishman's welcome responded to by a saUor's greet ing commenced a friendship as sincere as it was likely to prove lasting.

It was a pleasing theme to all, but to none more so than to Mr. Morland him self: for, though humbled, he was now a happier and a wiser man. When that very morning dawned upon his restless couch, he thought himself Avorse than childless, \u2014 a bereaved and heart-broken man.

The moment the Captain"], [591, "OF COMMERCE. 293 took his hat off he recognised him, but had the good sense not to address him until Ave were alone.\" \" I remember him AveU,\" said Maria. \" He had been one of my father's servants Avhen a young man, and Avas out with the hunt on the day of the accident.\" \" So he informed us. And after many greetings had passed betAveen the Captain and him, we learnt a few of the most important events that had occurred at the village during the last two years. Any one making inquiry about their young master or mistress, was told that Mr. Hawke Avas taking great care of them, having sent them to expensive schools in a distant part of the country. Very few believed this, and for a long time sus picion lurked in the minds of all; and thoughtswere harboured in many a rustic's mind, Avhich, had he given utterance to, the fate that befel Goodram would have"], [592, "294 THE VICISSITUDES befallen him. For the great man had not allowed his revenge to sleep, but con tinued to harass the famUy by a never ceasing persecution, which he had carried on to the present time, hoping to drive them from the neighbourhood; and when this did not succeed, it was hinted to the old man, that if he would go to America, his passage Avould be paid. But Goodram remembered the promise, that though the wicked might flourish like a green bay tree, yet a time should come when their wickedness would be discovered ; and, old as he was, he hoped to see that day. Thus the matter remained until about eight months ago, when the vUlage gossip was awakened by the inmates of the Hall, the servants as well as the family appear ing at church in deep mourning, Miss St. Crost having died suddenly of the ague, at a school in Lincolnshire. This once more aroused suspicion ; but still, as"], [593, "OF COMMERCE. 295 they had no proof of fraud, they con tented themselves with surmises. But when it Avas announced, a few months afterwards, that Master Edwin also was dead, an universal outcry was raised by the tenantry and villagers ; and as no one attempted to conceal his thoughts, the subject became the topic of general con versation. All that passed was duly re peated to Mr. Hawke, whose spies were ever ready to Usten. Lnfortunately the rent-day came round just at this time, and aU Avho had said anything upon the subject \u2014 our host of the vUlage inn among the number \u2014 were assembled in Mr. Hawke's study, when he informed them that he was in possession of the rumours that were in circulation ; and after talking for some time, concluded his long harangue by giving about half of them notice to quit their farms, and our informant his hostel. He then read two"], [594, "296 THE VICISSITUDES papers purporting to be certificates from the master and mistress of the schools at which his nephew and niece had been placed. He said he produced these, not to justify himself, for it Avould be beneath him to contradict every calumny that might be spoken against him, but merely to show his hearers what credulous fellows they were. One of those present asked for a copy of the papers, but this was refused ; and they were dismissed very chop-fallen. Only one incident had oc curred since that bore upon the subject, and that was a ghost story. A farmer Avas on his way into an adjoining county; and whilst driving his Avain one evening about dusk, he met two youths, one of which he recognised as his young master. Fear overcame him, and for some mo ments he dared not look back ; but when he did so, both the youths had vanished, though there was nothing to obstruct the"], [595, "297 OF COMMERCE. view; and only one cottage to be seen, and that at a considerable distance. His story was listened to by many a rustic circle with feelings of awe, nor durst the village maidens, after that, pass near the Hall alone aster dark. Our host finished his narrative by telling us that the Hall Avas very full of company, a ball being given that night by Mr. and Mrs. Hawke, to celebrate the entrance into his teens of their eldest son and heir. We resolved to proceed there at once, though midnight Avas not far distant, Mr. Kenworthy re maining at the inn, in order that our party might not raise suspicion. As the carriage drove up the long avenue, the light that shone from every Avindow of the mansion, gave indication of Use; and upon emerging into the open ground, the sounds of music and merriment told that the house of mourning was transformed into one of mirth. We entered the Hall o 3"], [596, "298 THE VICISSITUDES as guests that had been bidden to the feast; and the door of the drawing-room, in which a numerous party were as sembled, being thrown open, Captain Hardy and Mr. Frank Smith, the name I had assumed for the evening, were an nounced. The Captain Avas not recog nised by any of the feAV persons who heard his name. ' There is the old shark,' said he to me, as we took a survey of the scene. ' He is so much taken up with that young lady's conversation that he does not observe our presence.' I at once recognised Mr. Hawke, by the de scription Maria had given us of him, even among so many strange faces, lie is a gentlemanly man in appearance, \u2014 tall, and rather inclined to corpulence; and had a look of pride, that might almost be called arrogance. ' Come with me,' said my companion, ' and mark the change that AviU come across his features"], [597, "OF COMJ\u0152RCE. 299 when his eye meets mine.' FeeUng a hand placed on his shoulder, he turned his head \u2014 Truly we know not what a second (of time) may bring forth \u2014 a single glance of the eye, and the haughty man is cowed, like a guilty criminal before his judge; and the crimes of years stand arrayed before him, as distinct as the kings before the amazed Macbeth. Some called for water, supposing he Avas about to faint, Avhilst the rest scowled upon us as though we had been officers of justice come to arrest their host. HoweA'er, he speedily recovered his presence of mind, stammered forth an apology to his guests, shook the Captain by the hand, and said it was the happiest moment of his life. Pre sently Mrs. HaAvke entered, when a some what similar scene Avas re-enacted. But Captain Hardy placed her arm inside his OAvn, and motioning me to follow, lest the room. ' Where can Ave have a little peace' ?"], [598, "300 THE VICISSITUDES said he, addressing his gentle but unwil ling companion. ' I wrant to have a little quiet chat about my wards. Oh, I see, there is no one in Mr. St. Crost's study ; I beg your pardon, madam, \u2014 Mr. Hawke's noAV, I presume?' Accordingly he led the Avay, and placed her in a chair. From the lady we had a repetition of the story we had previously heard. The fair dame shed many tears at the remembrance of the untimely fate of the two cherubs; they were so dear to her husband and herself. ' Many of your guests avUI doubtless remain Avith you until morning,' remarked the Captain, in a careless tone ; 'sol think, Frank, we had better make up our minds to .' He dwelt upon the last Avord in order to give Mrs. HaAvke an opportunity to construe the sentence in her own way. She took the bait.

And so, madam, as we have had a hard day's Avork, we wiU Avish you a very good nio-ht.' The lady attempted to speak,"], [600, "302 THE VICISSITUDES but her tormentor would not aUow her. ' No apologies, I beg. We shall be A^ery comfortable, \u2014 there, good night, good night.' Whilst saying this, he had been handing her out of the study, the door of Avhich he closed and fastened inside. ' Now,' said my companion, ' we have gained the enemy's quarter-deck, and not aU their menial crew shall dislodge us. The position must be lost only with our lives. There can be no burning of papers now, for, having outwitted the old villain, we shaU see everything ; all wUl be dis closed.' About an hour elapsed before our solitude was disturbed, when a foot man came, Avith his master's compUments, and said that beds had been provided for us upstairs. The Captain opened the room-door, ostensibly to show him the comfortable ones we had made up on the chairs, but reaUy in order to let him see the pistols that lay on the table. They"], [601, "OF COMMERCE. 303 Avere a couple of brace of formidable looking weapons, such as made his blood run cold. He slunk out of the room, and we were not again intruded upon by either master or servants. The noise of revelry grew louder as the hours passed by ; the sound of music was succeeded by that of human voices ; the language, from being loud and distinct, became gradually less boisterous and more incoherent, until about four o'clock in the morning, Avhen every one seemed to have been overcome by fatigue or wine ; for, from that hour, an uniArersal quiet reigned around. We Avaited in great impatience till some time after daylight, expecting indications of a return to life among the inmates of the mansion; but time passed, and still no sound broke the deep stillness, except the disturbed breathing of some person asleep near the study door, and the cawing of rooks, \u2014 the birds seeming to be aAvare"], [602, "304 THE VICISSITUDES of the change about to take place at the Hall, \u2014 for the rookery continued in a state of the utmost excitement during the whole day. As this was a state of things that appeared to be in a fair way for lasting tiU midday, I resolved to explore some of the lower apartments of the mansion. The first object that met my eye upon saUying forth from our dormitory, Avas the body of a man lying on the stairs, his feet uppermost; his position appeared to be so uncomfortable, and even dangerous, that I stopped, and contiived to turn him round Avithout awakening him. I passed on to the large entrance haU, and there felt as though I Avere in a place of sanctity. No change had apparently been made in it since my Maria and her widoAved mother were ejected from the hall of their ancestors. Her eyes had rested Avith delight on the birds and animals carved there, and which her infant imagination"], [603, "OF COMMERCE. 305 must, doubtless, have often imbued Avith life and motion, whilst the prattle of her childish voice had caused the lofty roof to re-echo many a joyous carol. The dining-room door was open, and inside a most disgraceful scene presented itself. There might be five or six individuals in the apartment ; two of the number Avere asleep in their chairs, the others lay stretched at full length on the floor. One of those who were seated Avas a reverend \u2014 gentleman I cannot call him \u2014 brute would be the most appropriate name: I took him to be Mr. Gay, and found afterwards, upon inquiring, that my supposition was correct. A capacious punch-boAvl, almost emptied of its con tents, bore witness as to the power that had prostrated the revellers. I felt my human nature degraded by what I saw, and was glad to find myself alone on the lawn. Standing beneath the very trees"], [604, "306 THE VICISSITUDES in whose shade Maria had viewed the gathering of the hunt on the fatal morn ing, I pictured the whole scene to my mind, and must have spent a long time in my reverie, for, on returning to the study, I found the Captain at breakfast. Noon came, but stiU we saw neither host nor hostess. At first we imagined the rout of the previous night would account for this; but, when the guests had departed one after another, and we were left alone, we greAV tired, and a footman Avas sent to his master's room with Captain Hardy's compliments, and he wished to know how soon he would be visible? The answer to our message was, that Mr. Hawke was unwell. ' Unwell!' shouted my com panion, in a tone that struck terror into the fellow. ' Did you see your master, sirrah?' The reply was, that he did not see him. ' The viUain is gone,' said the Captain ; ' d \u2014 n me if he is not. Show me"], [605, "OF COMMERCE. 307 your master's room.' And so it proved. He had left his guests under plea of illness; but, instead of retiring to rest, had taken horse and ridden off unattended. We dispatched a courier to the nearest telegraph station, in order to transmit a description of the fugitive to the London and Liverpool police, and to obtain any information he could as to his movements. It was past midnight when our messenger returned, with the news that a person, answering the description of Mr. HaAvke, had arrived in Liverpool by the train which left Manchester at ten o'clock; was without luggage, but said he had sent it on board the American steamer the day before ; sailed under the name of Captain Hardy ; the steamer left the Mersey at twelve o'clock at noon that day, Saturday, and might possibly be over taken by one of the fast boats from Holy head. This suggestion we had agreed to"], [606, "308 THE VICISSITUDES adopt, but Avere prevented doing so by the advice of Mr. Kenworthy, who had been employed all day in collecting and arranging for examination the documents and papers. He thought, that as Ave were now in possession of everything neces sary for our purpose, it Avould be a great saving of expense, as well as of unplea santness to Captain Hardy and his wards, to allow the fugitiA-e to escape. And so Ave let him go; and, by this time, he is halfway across the Atlantic Ocean.\" \" I am so glad he is gone,\" said Maria. \" And so were the viUagers ; for no sooner Avas the news of his flight spread among them, than old and young flocked to the Hall to express their gratitude to the Captain for their deliverance. He assembled them together, and related the leading features of Mr. HaAvke's viUanies ; but when he told them that the orphans of their departed friends, whose memory"], [607, "OF COMMERCE. 309 many of them still loved to dwell upon, were not only alive but would soon be amongst them, the joy of the poor creatures kneAV no bounds; some cried through the excess of it, Avhilst others gave utterance to theirs in loud huzzas. As for myself, I Avas almost torn in pieces by them in their anxiety to greet the betrothed of their young mistress. We then regaled them with the remnants of the previous day's feast, and sent them away rejoicing. With poor old Goodram I had a long and SAveet discourse, for my oavu Maria was its chief theme. The old man, feeble through toil and grief, thanked heaven that his gray hairs were not to go down in sorroAV to the grave. I made his heaut glad Avhen I pictured the many happy years of earthly joy that, God Avilling it, were still in store for him, before he re ceived his final reward. His youngest son, now about tAvo-and-twenty years of"], [608, "310 THE VICISSITUDES age, was very useful to Mr. Kenworthy. We were all so much pleased with him, that we installed him into the vacant stewardship. Upon examining the docu ments we found them to be of the utmost importance. First in weight were two wills of the late Mr. St. Crost. One was that read on the morning of the funeral ; the other bore a later date, and cancelled all previous ones. The latter avUI contained a legacy to Captain Hardy of ten thousand pounds, whUst the one to Mr. Hawke Avas merely one thousand, being a reward for the attention he had paid to the testator's affairs ; \u2022 besides these were small sums, bequests to many, chiefly old servants, whose names were mentioned; his Avife Edith was also named as an executrix. This will had been kept back by Mr. Hawke, as the Avidow's possession of a power equal to his own would have disconcerted his"], [609, "OF COMMERCE. 311 plans. The other wiU bore evident marks of being a spurious one. Next came the fictitious mortgage deeds; the signature for these had been pricked from the genuine wiU Avith such neatness that it required the nicest examination to detect the fraud. The sum they were intended to represent amounted to that Maria men tioned. In a portfolio we discovered securities for a considerable amount of property in the United States ; this course we imagined had been adopted in order to meet an emergency such as this, which has so unexpectedly happened. On Tuesday a packet addressed to Mr. HaAvke, and bearing the New York post mark, came to hand; in it were other securities for a large purchase of American bonds, recently transacted.

Maria was still sojourning at the Par sonage; and on that morning her sweet and placid sleep little betokened the event ful day that had broken upon her. She slept on \u2014 and smiled as a pleasing vision passed before her mind: nor Avere her slumbers dispeUed except by the voice of her kind hostess.

In her costume for the morning she had submitted entirely to Frank's wish, which, though it might be thought a pe cuUar one, was not dictated through a desire for singularity ; but having chosen her as the object of his love whilst in a humble sphere of life, so now that she Avas far removed from a position Avhich she had fiUed with so much credit to herself, he wished to show that it was not the lady of fortune and family that Avas to be his bride, but the loAvly and gentle Maria. Her dress of muslin, virgin white, was fashioned similar to those in which Frank had so often seen her at work in the mill, or at the Lodge, when seated with her Bible, reading to her aged companions, as was her Avont each evening, a portion of Scripture ; it was enchanting from its very simplicity.

When Maria descended from her cham ber she went, according to her usual custom, to Mr. Wynn's study, hoping this morn ing to find him alone \u2014 as indeed he was, having deferred until then a few remarks he wished to make relative to her future guidance. The good old man looked very sorroAvful Avhen he embraced her almost for the last time as his child, for he loved to call her such. \"Would it had been the will of Heaven,\" said he, \" that we might not so soon have parted.

For Mr. Marsh he had obtained an appointment in a mercantile house in New York, to which city he was about to remove Avith his Avife and daughter ; whilst, a few months before, he had given young Marsh a situation in his own business, hoping to reform him; but his bad habits, and a passion for low company, Avere too deeply seated in him to be easily eradicated ; he betrayed the confidence reposed in him, and, having lost the favour of his patron, was, at the time Ave speak of, on the stage of the very singing room at which he had once been the honoured and favoured guest.

She could have wept through the excess of her vexation : her embarrassment was marked upon her countenance, being too strong to be concealed even by one so AveU versed in the art of disguising the best, as well as the Avorst emotions of the human mind ; an art called by the world \" politeness,\" and esteemed hy it as though it were one of the cardinal vfrtues. Maria, attributing this confusion to other motives than the one from wdiich it sprang, took her by the hand, and em bracing her, said, \" May our friendship last through life, and be as sincere at its"], [628, "330 THE VICISSITUDES conclusion as it is now.\" Poor Ann ! she had entered the room predetermined to hate Maria ; she now found herself utterly unable to adhere to this resolution; aU her prejudices, aided by a proud spirit, could not resist such an appeal from such Ups. The nobler affections of her mind, affections that had long been dormant, once more burst forth, and for the first time since childhood she became conscious of the pleasures that can flow from true friendship. In the meantime the park presented an animating scene; the concourse of well dressed people had increased to a nume rous throng, many of them standing in groups along the margin of the carriage drive, gossipping over the events that had brought them there, whUst others talked in merry strains of the festivities in which they were about to join. Every person employed by Mr. Morland, upwards of a"], [629, "331 OF COMMERCE. thousand in number, had been presented with a day's wages; whilst among the poorest of them the gratuity Avas extended to articles of clothing. In a temporary building erected in the park, a plentiful repast was provided; and here, after the sports of the day were concluded, a dance was to close the rejoicings; consequently each face beamed with smiles, and all ap peared perfectly happy, but none more truly so than Jack Houghton and his family ; he wore a suit of black cloth, and was accompanied by his daughter AUce and her husband, who held a little urchin just able to waddle along, by the hand; Dinah was there too, holding Tom Wright by the arm; a close observer might at once have pronounced them husband and wife. The younger chUdren, their cu riosity flagging as time passed, were chasing each other over the grass. Such a picture of enjoyment as this scene pre-"], [630, "332 THE VICISSITUDES sensed might, of itself, be evidence suf ficient to confute the theory so often broached and so generally believed, that the state of the labourer is and always must be a state of Avretchedness ; as though an all-wise Providence would, during thousands of years, have caUed into existence hundreds of millions of human beings, whose only birth right was misery, and whose only release Avas death, Avhilst a rich and powerful feAv alone were to taste of happiness. But it is not so ; the ways of God are equal. The poor man's moments of enjoyments may not come so frequently as those of his wealthy neighbours, but what they lose in that respect is amply compensated for by the intensity of the happiness such moments bring; his joy is not clouded by an over anxiety for to-morroAv; he holds no lofty station, no high office, of Avhich his most intimate friend may be plotting to deprive"], [631, "333 OF COMMERCE. him ; he possesses no frail title to the tem porary ownership of this Avorld's riches, the very superfluity of which paUs every pleasure. And when we thus compare the classes of men in a spirit of fairness and truth, we find the life of a steady, industrious labouring man, is blessed with a greater amount of happiness, \u2014 \" of sober, simple, genuine joy,\" \u2014 than that attained by the miUionnaire, \u2014 a man Avho knoAvs the in crease of his wealth only by the greater degree of anxiety it brings him. And if Houghton and his family might be looked upon as affording a fair pattern of the enjoyment experienced by the many hun dreds that thronged Mr. Morland's park that morning, then might Ave confidently say, that no equal number of any class of her Majesty's subjects could, in that respect, have gained by a comparison with them. But perhaps the peculiar"], [632, "334 THE VICISSITUDES position of this family, and the great obligations they were under to Frank and his lovely bride, might have given an additional impulse to the manifestations of their feelings.

They had resumed their position in the community; a position gradually lost by themselves or their an cestors during the previous half century. It was certainly a disgrace to the boasted humanity of Englishmen, that the law should be compelled to interfere, and say they were not to be looked upon as pieces of mechanism only, \u2014 as machines of less value than the iron ones they tended, because, unUke those, they could be cast"], [634, "336 THE VICISSITUDES on one side when Avorn out, and replaced Avithout cost ; but they noAV became aware that they were men and women, boys and girls ; contented ones, ay, and happy ones too, for \" contentment is riches rich enough.\" Mr. Morland's workpeople were, per haps, more highly favoured than their fellows : for, since the passing of the Ten Hours BiU, they had never worked a longer time than that BiU was intended to sanction, if interpreted in its true spirit ; nor had their pecuniary resources been too much straitened by any diminu tion of the hours of labour below that.

Young Edwin leant on the arm of Mr. Morland; he was much taller and paler than before his accident, though fast re covering from the effects of it. In Mr. Morland's appearance there was only one thing that served as a clue to connect the present with the past: he who has wandered on the sea-shore after the sub siding of a tempest, must have observed the long white streak of foam that lies along the beach ; and though aU is then calm and serene, with no sound to break the stillness, except the sea-bird's call, or the music of gentle Avaves as they curl and run along the smooth sand, until VOL.

The ceremony itself was conducted without any ostentatious display; a de corous silence had, hitherto, been observed by those who had assembled to witness it ; but when Maria stood by Captain Hardy's side, at the chancel raUs, not even the reverence due to the sacred building in which they were, nor the knowledge that the eye of their pastor was upon them, were sufficient to prevent an audible ejaculation escaping the lips of many. \" Ah, bless her pratty face !\" was uttered"], [637, "339 OF COMMERCE. by many a female voice, whilst numbers wept, though they knew not why.
