'LAY HANDS SUDDENLY ON NO MAN.' Peace and concord were much talked about in Stilborough on the occasion of the ratepayers in the town being called upon to elect a new vicar to their parish church of St. Barnaby. This was no ancient privilege that was going to be exercised, for the living was not in the gift of the burgesses, but in that of Lord Hartleigh, of Hazelwood, Lord of the Manor. This young and excellent peer, however, having but just come into his property, was more concerned about the reorganisation of his stud and kennels than about the bestowal of ecclesiastical pa tronage He had been memorialised in most earnest terms by one half of the parishioners not to appoint a High Church man, and had been adjured on his soul by the remaining half not to collate any minister whose sordid spirit VOL. I. B"], [14, "2 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. should ' grudge the Almighty seemly worship ; ' moreover, he had received written applications from some three hundred of the greater and lesser clergy. As much to rid himself of these importunates as to insure himself against all self-reproach in the event of an unsuitable choice being made, he wrote and requested that the inhabitants of Stilborough would select their pastor for themselves ; and by this gracious act he earned much popularity in the town, as well as praise from enlightened newspapers in London. As the living of Stilborough was worth iooo/. a year, with light parish work, and the most charming of riverside residences, it will readily be conceived that there should have been no lack of candidates. A committee deputed by the ratepayers spent six weeks examining the mass of letters, circulars, and testimonials despatched from all parts of the country in reply to advertisements inserted in the public press ; and when this had been done, another eventful month was expended in win nowing the conflicting claims until but two eligible postulants remained face to face. This result was not arrived at without excitino- a good deal of piously bitter controversy and con scientious hostility between man and man. As will already have been guessed, Stilborough was a town where religious questions held the"], [15, "'LAY HANDS SUDDENLY ON NO MAN! 3 place of paramount importance that belongs to them ; and this election furnished occasion for those outspoken confessions of dogma and vehement comminatory denunciations of one's neighbour which distinguish the fervent Chris tian. Of course the ladies of the town were not behindhand with their lords in religious zeal, and imparted to the discussions those ele ments of genial warmth and uncompromising spiritedness which are the usual outcome of Woman's soothing influence. However, it was a great point to have fas tened upon two ultimate candidates ; and these they were \u2014 the Rev. Joel Fulmouth, M.A., and the Very Rev. Noel Drinkdew, D.D. At the invitation of Mr. Brindle, the Mayor, both divines were requested to come down to Stil borough on Whit-Monday, and preach, in order that the scale of their evenly-balanced merits might be turned by the tongue of the most eloquent. Some carping spirits did indeed urge that to set two clergymen preaching about at each other for a prize of 1000/. a year was an expe dient of questionable edification ; but the con tending parties themselves seemed to be troubled with no questions on this head, and each arrived at the ' Red Lion ' of Stilborough carrying a carpet-bag, a carefully-written sermon, and a lively confidence in his own success. The turns of preaching having been ad B 2"], [16, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 4 judged by lot, it was the Rev. Joel Fulmouth who ascended the pulpit at morning service, and he made a good impression there. He was the author of that much-read book, ' The Light of the Soul,' and a tall, robust, full-blooded man, whose florid cheeks were bordered with a thick set of orange whiskers, and whose lusty voice filled every corner of the church without effort, and even reached half-way across the market place outside. He took for his text, ' Let your light so shine before men,' &c, and entered with all his lungs into long and feeling eulogy upon his own work in the Great Vineyard, con triving to make it known that he owed no man anything, and was supporting a family of nine children on a living of 300/. a year. The Rev. Joel's delivery consisted mostly of violent thumps on the pulpit cushion ; but these were generally felt by his hearers to be spiritual thumps, intended to rouse the consciences of the sluggish ; and as the matter of the preacher's discourse was dogmatically sound, and as, furthermore, his allusion to his children had touched the sensibilities of some of the feminine part of the congregation, the belief prevalent in Stilborough from one o'clock until three was that Mr. Fulmouth would very probably be elected. But the congregation had yet to hear the Very Rev. Dr. Drinkdew, who lifted up his"], [17, "'LAY HANDS SUDDENLY ON NO MAN! 5 voice at the afternoon service. The prayers being finished, and the hymn sung, there rose into the pulpit a gaunt, dark-eyed man, with features extraordinarily sunburnt, but with a voice as exquisitely modulated as a well-tuned barrel-organ. Dr. Drinkdew was the author of that much-read work, ' The Lantern of the Heart,' and offered in many respects, besides the physical, a contrast to his rival, for he was neither married, nor possessed of a benefice, nor was he apparently troubled in any degree about such material problems as the cost of living. It was known that he had been dean to some colonial cathedral in the tropics, and had come home from ill-health ; and additional celebrity attached to him owing to numerous controversial works, essays, pamphlets, &c, which he had published or contributed to high class reviews. The ex-Dean selected for his text, ' I will tread the paths of peace,' and having given a stirring, brilliantly-coloured ac count of some episodes in h_s colonial adven tures (not the least emotional among which was an encounter with a gorilla whom he had routed with a hymn-book), he hinted at his yearning desire to abandon polemics, and to spend the remainder of his days in peaceful parish work, devoting his life, experience, and worldly resources to the good of his parish ioners. This well-timed allusion to worldly"], [18, "6 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. resources was not without its effect on many, especially among the fair portion of the congre gation, for after all it is something to have a vicar in easy circumstances ; besides which the matrimonial possibilities connected with a well to-do bachelor divine were not slow in sug gesting themselves to mothers with grown-up daughters, and to one or two widows sitting disconsolate in their pews. But, in sum, opinions remained pretty nearly as much divi ded after the sermons as before them. Dr. Drinkdew was from Oxford, and Mr. Fulmouth from Cambridge ; the former was a Conser vative and the latter a Liberal ; and as regards doctrine, although both affected to be of the Broad Church, it was patent that candles, vest ments, and censors might find more favour with the author of the ' Lantern of the Heart ' than they were likely to do with the author of the ' Light of the Soul.' The sworn partisans of either Church sect abode steadfast, therefore, each in the determination which he had taken long time ago not to be swayed an inch from his purpose ; and the electoral committee ad journed to the Town Flail, bristling and fuming with such sentiments of mutual defiance as were well calculated to ensure the peaceful discharge of the business in hand. Much trouble might have been saved, many a day of strife and excitement might now have"], [19, "'LAY HANDS SUDDENLY ON NO MAN! 7 been spared to Stilborough, if the committee had proceeded to vote at once without par leying, as Mr. Brindle, that most discreet of mayors, besought them to do. But there are always men in an assembly who believe in the power of a word in season (when uttered by themselves), and such a one was Mr. Pottinger, grocer, churchwarden, town-councillor, and a most active character in the borough. Bringing down one of his plump, moist hands with a deliberate flap on the blotting-book before him, and rolling a pair of eyes aglow with dicta torial fire, Mr. Pottinger exclaimed : \u2014 ' Gem'men, I suppose, as men of sense, we're all of one mind as to the propriety of electing Mr. Fulmouth ? ' ' Oh, no, indeed,' protested Mr. Pettigrew, a brother town-councillor and a draper, and Mr. Pottinger's constant opponent in all things temporal as well as spiritual. ' No, indeed. I was about to propose that, sinking all differ ences of opinion, we should every one of us, as men of understanding, bestow our votes on Dr. Drinkdew, in order that the appointment might bear the more grace from being unanimous.' ' Aha ! I was prepared for that, Sir,' ejacu lated Mr. Pottinger, with an emphatic wag of the head ; ' yes, Sir, I was prepared for it.' ' So you might be, I should think, from long habit,' remarked Mr. Whispie, horse-dealer."], [20, "8 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. who passed for a man of humour in the borough. ' Aye, Sir, from long habit also,' reiterated Mr. Pottinger, sardonically catching up the words ; ' habit might have prepared me for the suxumstance ' (the choleric churchwarden was apt to stumble over a polysyllable when ex cited) ' that Mr. Pettigrew would miss no occa sion of trying to set up Rome in our midst! ' ' Rome's as good as Plymouth,' retorted the Conservative draper, with laconic scorn. ' Do you mean that for a hinsinuation, Sir ? ' shouted Mr. Pettigrew, springing to his feet, and leaning half across the table. ' Do you mean to hinsinuate that I'm a Plymouth Brother ? ' ' Come, come, let's settle the election by tossing up,' interposed Mr. Whispie, breezily ; 'here's a sovereign. Heads it's Fulmouth; tails, Drinkdew.' ' Order, order ! ' exclaimed a councillor who took the proper view of such profanity. ' I'm a-waiting for your reply, Sir,' screamed Mr. Pottinger, shaking his head till the whitey brown furze on it stood up on end. ' Did you or did you not say I was a Plymouth Brother ? ' ' Plymouth, Portsmouth, Dartmouth, any thing you please, Sir,' answered Mr. Pettigrew, desperately ; ' what I mean is, that your religion is not ours, Sir ; it's what I call an un- En dish"], [21, "'LAY HANDS SUDDENLY ON NO MAN! 9 religion. You hurried our late vicar into an early grave ! ' ' The doose I did ! Why, if I'd a-done that I should have considered myself Providence's instrument in so doing,' was the grocer's boldly flashed retort. ' But, as a fact, Sir,' added he, ' you know as well as I do that your vicar died by choking himself with a fish-bone, which he ate on one of those precious fast-days that he wanted to introduce amongst us. That's how your vicar died, Sir ! ' ' He wasn't my vicar any more than yours,' responded Mr. Pettigrew, warmly resenting the exclusive imputed ownership. ' And he didn't die of a fish-bone, either,' observed Mr. Finsole, the fishmonger, anxious to repudiate what might seem like an aspersion on the produce of his shop. ' Natural causes is what the vicar died of, and nothing else. Ask the undertaker.' ' Ay, ay,' assented Mr. Cribbs, the gentle man appealed to ; ' but I'll tell yer what, if we Sfet flineinsf dead men's bones into one another's teeth like this, I don't know when it'll stop.' ' It was he who began, when he called me a Roman,' remarked Mr. Pettigrew, calmly. ' And I expect I wasn't far wrong, either,' responded Mr. Pottinger, in heat. ' I'll be bound there 'ud be a fine blaze-up of stakes and faggots in the town if he had his way.'"], [22, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 10 ' Pooh ! there are some men who wouldn't be worth the cost of burning,' sneered Mr. Pettigrew, with magnificent epigrammatism. ' I know some, though, whom it 'ud be well worth while to whip by public subscription,' howled Mr. Pottinger, almost beside himself. ' Dear me, dear me ! I'm afraid we are stray ing dreadfully wide of the mark, gentlemen,' moaned Mr. Brindle, the well-meaning little Mayor. ' For my part I'm sure I wish we could settle this election by appointing both the gen tlemen whom we have heard to-day. Nothing would be more gratifying to me personally than that they should preach to us turn-about, and divide the income of the living between them.' ' Hear, hear!' chorussed a few councillors, fascinated by this soothing suggestion, which was, however, nothing new in Mr. Brindle's mouth, for he was always emitting conciliatory proposals, the only drawback to which was that they were invariably impracticable. This mayor, a stationer by trade, was of meek, diminutive aspect, abhorring strife, and on the present oc casion he evinced the longanimity of a saint in attempting to bring back the unruly debaters to a spirit of concord. But in the grocer and the draper he had to deal with a pair of Christians, who were no more to be coaxed asunder than a bull-dog and a sleuth-hound once they have met over a bone. Clad in a grey shooting-coat"], [23, "'LAY HANDS SUDDENLY ON NO MAN! 11 and a red tie, valiant Mr. Pottinger barked in coherent words of anathema against High Church practices, and mopped the indignant drops that were oozing by hundreds from his purple face ; while spare, thin-faced, black- clad Mr. Pettigrew brought to bear against this dis play of rage an attitude of taunting sarcasm and cool sneers against Low Church that must have been eminently galling to his opponent. Then each champion had his band of clamorous supporters, who, when the fight between the principals seem to flag, hurried up to the rescue, so that in a very little time, the original purport of the debate having been entirely lost sight of, it degenerated into a scene of grand mutual shouting recrimination, wherein Tory and Libe ral heartily abused each other in connection with all matters pertaining to local politics and rates, road-mending, street-lighting, sewers, the man agement of trust funds, and even the quality of the treacle supplied to children in the work house. How all this might have ended it is really difficult to surmise, but certainly matters appeared to be hastening towards a general de plorable scrimmage, when \u2014 But what follows deserves to be recorded less abruptly. The room in which the election of a vicar was being held was the Council Chamber of the Town Hall, and through the open windows a"], [24, "12 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. view could be had by the meeting into the prin cipal market-place : to the right stood the ancient Red Lion Inn, to the left the new Bank, oppo site rose the venerable ivy-clad Church of St. Barnaby, with the principal thoroughfare, the High Street, branching away to the north of it. Now, as Mr. Pottinger was on his legs roaring for the twentieth time that he would rather secede from the Established Church and found a sect of his own than forego his Briton's privi lege of eating meat on a Friday, it suddenly seemed to him as though his vision was ob scured. At first he thought that a film had come over his eyes ; but a straining look con vinced him that the cause of his bedazzlement was nothing less than a cloud of smoke and flame curling in graceful spirals over the roof of his grocery store in the High Street. At the same time a shrill cry of 'Fire!' resounding from some urchin's voice gave rise to an ani mated stampede of feet over the pavements outside. Mr. Pottinger stopped dead short and aghast, and in an instant the meeting of whilom obstreperous disputants had flown to the win dows like one man, and leaned craning out with breath suspended. There was a moment's hope that the alarm might be a false one ; but a slight whiff of breeze having whirled a huge column of smoke into the square, dispelled all"], [25, "'LAY HANDS SUDDENLY ON NO MAN! 13 doubts ; at the same time the cries of ' Fire ! ' growing louder and louder, sashes were thrown up by scared housemaids, and crowds flocked up hurriedly from all parts of the town as if they had been conjured up from underground. Considering that most of the company present at the Town Hall owned shops in the High Street, it must not seem surprising that they should have taken to their heels with startling promptitude. They did indeed scamper down the staircase so fast that they would have done credit to the greatest master of gymnastics that ever taught agility. Liberal and Conser vative, High Church and Low, the young and the old, the fat and the lean, shoving and jost ling one another, off and away they rushed, most of them hatless, into the dust and sun glare of a bright June afternoon \u2014 all panting they were, but pale, having flung off every heed of ghostly matters, and being intent now only on the rescue of their precious worldly goods which might be crackling yonder. Mean while, the surging troops of townsfolks having blocked up the mouth of the High Street, it became difficult for the tradesmen immediately to force themselves a passage towards their homes ; so that, during several minutes, they had to listen to the agonising rumours now of one shop being in a blaze, now of another. Happily these reports were untrue, and the"], [26, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 14 calamity turned out to be much less than had been dreaded. It was not the shop of any re spectable tradesman that had caught fire, but only the alley cottage of a poor widow who owned seven children and supported them by mangling. This satisfactory circumstance hav ing been ascertained, the tradesmen, feeling much relieved, began to bustle officiously about, marshal the crowd, and sing out for water. As usual in country towns, the fire-engine was not to be got at in a hurry ; and the wretched mother, huddling on the pavement with her progeny, was fain to look with dismal eyes at the flames rapidly consuming her hum ble home and belongings. Of a sudden, however, an appalling shriek rose into the air. The widow, in looking round, perceived that one of her children, who she thought had followed her, was missing. It was not the last born, but a sturdy little fellow four years old, who had clung to her skirt as she fled the cottage, and whom, for that reason, she had considered safe. The distracted mother made a plunge forward, but twenty hands restrained her, and a hundred voices were uplifted to point out the utter madness of seeking to penetrate into the cottage, which was now roaring like a furnace. Madness, alas ! the mother little recked that, and it was a pitiable thing to see her struggling for freedom, and adjuring Messrs."], [27, "'LAY HANDS SUDDENLY ON NO MAN! 15 Pottinger, Pettigrew, Cribbs, Finsole, and the rest, that if they would not let her go, one of them at least should devote himself to recover her lost little one, as if gentlemen so useful to the public weal could afford to risk their bodies and still more their valuable tongues in pulling other people's children out of the fire ! But at this seemingly hopeless juncture there stepped out of the crowd a young man, who was a stranger to the town, and wore clerical attire. He flashed upon the throng of tradesmen like an apparition, and his clustering auburn hair, large eyes, and earnest face left upon them during the brief instant of their beholding his face an impression as of an angel's features. Pointing to the burning pile, he moved his lips, apparently asking some question that was inaudible because of the tumult ; then, not obtaining an. answer, he turned and darted intrepidly up the alley, followed by the excla mations of a thousand spectators, who had not divined his intention, and were electrified by his courage. Some minutes of awful anxiety now ensued. The alley was so narrow that the black smoke rushing out of it seemed to issue from the mouth of a cannon. Above, the flames were leaping up in forked sheaves, while myriads of sparks flew hither and thither to the noise of bursting window-panes and cracking rafters."], [28, "16 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. A deep hush had fallen on the crowd ; assu redly every heart beat, and every eye was strained, watching either for the stranger to return, repelled by the smoke, or for the roof to fall in and bury him in the ruins. Minutes seem like hours in such cases, but at last a sort of gasp from the crowd testified that the cata strophe most dreaded had occurred, and that the roof had crashed down, making of the. cottage a shapeless heap of smouldering wood and bricks. At this moment, however, there emerged from the alley a man without hair, eyelashes, or eye brows, carrying in his arms a child wrapped in a shawl. Tottering across the road with this burden, he restored it living to the mother, for by some miracle the child had remained un scathed, and had not even a singe on him. Nobly deserved were the loud cheers which now swelled on all sides, blending with the tear ful thanks of the overjoyed mother. English crowds are prompt to kindle into enthusiasm at the sight of plucky deeds unbraggingly accom plished, and scores of hands pressed forward to grasp that of the large-hearted youth whose name was unknown. He the while looked a singular object, with every vestige of hair scorched off him, and with broad blisters risino perceptibly over his face and hands. But al though the smart of his burns must have been intense, and although his very clothes peeled"], [29, "'LAY HANDS SUDDENLY ON NO MAN! 17 off in cinders under the touch of his admirers, he did not faint nor let it be seen that he felt pain, so that the worship begotten by his bravery redoubled at the sight of his un common fortitude. Now it was under these mind-exciting and soul-stirring circumstances that Mr. Pottinger, churchwarden and grocer, was seized with one of those luminous inspirations that are worth a fortune to a man. Elbowing his way to the front rank of the crowd, he laid a hand on the stranger's arm, brusquely enough to make this latter wince, and stutteringly inquired \u2014 ' May I ask what is your name, Sir ? ' ' Paul Rushbrand,' faltered the young clergy man. ' And you belong to the Church of Eng land ? Are you priest or deacon, rector or curate ? ' ' I have just taken priest's orders, but am only a curate,' answered Mr. Rushbrand, look ing surprised. ' Well, then, listen to me, my fellow-towns men ! ' exclaimed Mr. Pottinger, raising his voice till it cracked. ' Listen to me, I say. I've a proposal to make. Here have we all been a-discussin' together as to who should be our vicar without bein' able to agree owing to some parties that I needn't mention ; but here the Lord has taken pity on us and sent us this VOL. I. C O"], [30, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 18 young clergyman to find favour in our eyes by saving a life from the fiery furnace. So I take leave to move that this is a providential cir cumstance, and ought to be so regarded by all, saving heathen souls ; and that, therefore, we ought to take the hints given unto us by 'eaven, and to elect this Mr. Rushbrand to be our vicar. WThat do you say to that ? ' For once even Mr. Pettigrew dared not raise a dissentient voice amid the clamour of approval with which his rival's unexpected pro posal was hailed. Perhaps, on the whole,, the two factions in Stilborough were not sorry to avoid an electoral contest, which must have re sulted in placing one-half the parishioners in permanent hostility to the new vicar, whoever he might be ; and for those who belonged to no faction, it was of course not a little relief to get a pastor nominated on non-party grounds. So the motion that Mr. Rushbrand should be vicar having been formally put by Mr. Brindle, standing on a kerbstone with an arm encircling a lamp-post, it was unanimously carried, amid the smoke, heat, and noise of the street, with a splendid gust of cheers and hat-waving. And thus it came to pass that a young curate who had entered the town with an income of So/, to boast of, was suddenly promoted by plebiscitum to one of the most desirable benefices in this kingdom,"], [31, "'9 CHAPTER II. THE FULNESS OF JOY. While these things were being enacted in the street, Mr. Fulmouth and Dr. Drinkdew were waiting at the Red Lion in separate rooms, and finding the time rather long. The tidings of what had occurred were brought them by a waiter, and each divine received the damping news of his failure in a manner befitting his particular idiosyncrasy. Dr. Drinkdew simply asked for his bill, consulted the time-tables, and drove away in a fly, giving the waiter a shil ling ; Mr. Fulmouth sprang to his feet, and, with features suffused to a point that threatened apoplexy, exclaimed \u2014 ' They have elected Paul Rushbrand ! Why, he's my curate ! ' saying which he made a grab at his hat, as though he would instantly go and warn the people of the preposterous mistake they had committed in putting aside the master for the man. Second thoughts suggested that the incon gruity might not be so apparent to all as it was c 2"], [32, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 20 to himself, for he checked the impulse that was driving him towards the hat-peg, and began to pace up and down the room. Presently he de scried through the window the new vicar, bare headed, semi-nude, and hardly recognisable, being brought into the inn by a number of the townsfolks. He then hurried downstairs, and, the public eye being upon him, showed himself paternal, clasping the exhausted sufferer to his breast, extolling his gallant exploit, and con signing him to the landlady with the request that every care should be taken of him, and that there should be no delay in fetching a doctor. This Mr. Fulmouth did in the sight of mankind ; but an hour later, when he and his ex-curate were left alone, the latter being in bed and swathed in oiled bandages, then the bitter ness of his spirit overflowed \u2014 ' Well, you've made a fine day of it, Rush brand,' he said, in a tone which struggled to appear amicable. ' You see I was well inspired when I brought you down here for a day's holi day, though at first you were so reluctant to come.' ' It must truly have been Providence that moved me to accept your invitation.' ' Providence \u2014 h'm \u2014 yes. Certainly the Lord's ways are past finding out, and He may have some inscrutable purpose in depriving a father of nine children ofa benefice which would have enabled him to bring them all up suitably.'"], [33, "THE FULNESS OF JOY. 21 ' He exalteth the humble,' said Paul Rush brand, faintly, while physical pain contracted his features. 'And He putteth down the proud \u2014 that is what you mean to say ? Well, Rushbrand, I don't know that I ever gave you occasion to tax me with being unduly puffed up. It seems to me that in all my dealings with you I ' ' Oh, certainly ; you misapprehend my mean ing,' protested Rushbrand, quickly. ' I was al luding only to myself.' ' Thank you, Rushbrand ; but I think irony towards the fallen ill becomes a man in the hour of his triumph,' ejaculated Mr. Fulmouth, in an injured tone, and making the best of the peg on which he was hanging this quarrel. ' Although, heaven knows, I do not grudge you your success, yet you know how much I had set my heart on this living, which, but for what happened this afternoon, would doubtless have been mine ; and I will even add that if you had explained when this office was so strangely thrust on you that you were my curate, and had travelled down here as my guest and at my expense \u2014 I think, I say, that the electors might have taken more time to consider the propriety of a scheme most hastily proposed to them.' ' And do you hold that it was my duty to impart to them the information you specify ? '"], [34, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 22 inquired Rushbrand, propping himself on an elbow. ' Oh, this is not a question of duty, but of good taste, Mr. Rushbrand ! ' answered Mr. Fulmouth, with a wave of the hand. ' I pro fess to be a judge of no man's duty ; but I suspect there are some men who would have thought they were possibly transgressing one of the unwritten laws of tact and kindliness in accepting an office which they knew to have been ardently desired \u2014 for family reasons \u2014 by one who had been their friend, patron, and benefactor.' ' I am sorry to hear that,' replied the new Vicar, in whose cavernous eyes the lustre of fever was beginning to gleam, and who, with his bound head and pain-distorted features, looked, on his bed of anguish, much like the pictures of an early Christian martyr on the rack. ' I am sorry to hear that, for you seem to be offended that I should have accepted this living ; but at the risk of angering you further, I must say I had no right to refuse, for the Lord's finger is plainly perceptible in this great thing. Who was I an hour ago but the lowliest among His servants, yet Fie took me by the hand as He took Joseph, Samuel, David, and all His prophets when He had work for them to do.

' Hut-tut, Sir ! who are you preaching to, and who envies you your living ? ' exclaimed Mr. Fulmouth, now fairly huffed. ' Keep your honours to yourself, Mr. Rushbrand. I wish you joy of them, and I wish the people who have chosen you joy of their bargain. Against one thing, however, I would warn you in your ministry, and that is the habit of attributing to God's grace unhallowed successes which are often but due to our own worldly ingenuity.' ' Ingenuity ! Why, do you mean that I sought this thing ? ' stammered Paul Rush brand, in utter astonishment. ' I mean to say, Sir, that you time your afternoon walks very adroitly,' replied Mr. Fulmouth, in excitement. ' Why \u2014 why \u2014 it was you yourself who sent me out that I might try to influence the inhabit ants of this town in your favour by spreading\" your praises among them \u2014 a trust I faithfully discharged.' ' Enough said, Sir ; the pride of office is already turning your head,' responded Mr. Ful mouth, loftily, and without heeding the agonised glance which his late curate was bending on him from the bed.

With this parting and unmerited shot the author of the ' Light of the Soul ' flustered out of the room, paid his bill, and strode out of the inn, carpet-bag in hand, without giving the waiter anything. It was now evening, but the Town Council of Stilborough, unwilling to lose any time in securing the ratification of the choice they had made, deputed Mr. Pottinger to write a letter to Lord Hartleigh, the patron of the living, to inform him of what had taken place. As the fire-engine had at last arrived, and was drench ing the widow's cottage with its waterspouts, all fear lest the flames should spread was dis pelled, and the churchwarden proceeded to write the letter in a composed frame of mind. When he had sealed it, he sallied forth to drop it into the box, and on his way met Mr. Ful mouth near the railway station. The Rev. Joel, having forgotten in his hurried exit from the inn to ascertain when the next train started, found himself with two spare hours on his hands, and was mooning about dejectedly \u2014 not so much now on account of his loss of the living, as because he had given way to temper in the presence of his curate, and made himself"], [37, "THE FULNESS OF JOY. 25 (as he was beginning poignantly to feel) both mean and ridiculous. He had half a mind to go back to the inn, apologise, and efface the quarrel. Mr. Pottinger accosted him with civility, for he felt that some excuses were owing to the clergyman for the rather unceremonious way in which he had been treated. Having explained that the whole town had been carried away by a torrent of enthusiasm, the source of which was assuredly Divine, and having seen Mr. Ful mouth nod concurringly at that remark, he availed himself of the opportunity to gather what information he could about the new vicar ; and the Rev. Joel, too much on his guard now to let aught of his chagrin be seen, spoke of his late curate in terms of unmixed praise. But to Mr. Pottinger's surprise it turned out that Mr. Rushbrand was no gentleman-scholar, fresh from the universities, as he imagined would be the case, but a man sprung from the very dregs of the people, and who had never been to school, much less to Oxford and Cambridge. His father was a good-for-nothing seaman in the merchant service, who had married twice and died from the effects of a drunken revel, and Paul himself had begun life as a ship's boy. ' Well, but where did he pick up his learn ing ? ' asked the grocer-churchwarden, who had"], [38, "26 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. no idea that instruction could be acquired else where than on school benches. ' He taught himself,' answered Mr. Ful mouth, secretly enjoying his interlocutor's be wilderment. ' He was engine-boy on board the ferry steamboat plying between Portsmouth and Gosport, his duty consisting in the crying \" Ease 'er ! \" \" Stop 'er ! \" &c. In the short intervals he could snatch between one trip across and another, in the evenings, on Sundays, and in fact at all odd moments, he would draw out a book or pen, and thus he learned to read and write and to reckon, and by-and-by mas tered Latin and mathematics.' ' What, Latin without a tutor ? ' ' Yes, but he only took to Latin later, when he had risen to be steward on board. He had more leisure then, and gave up his whole mind to study. In fact he taught himself Greek as well, also mechanics, and the rudiments of chemistry. French he had already learned from his step-mother, who had been a Boulogne fish-girl. He was altogether a wonderful boy, not a genius, but an indomitable, persevering worker.' ' He must have been, indeed. But how did he become a clergyman ! ' ' By preaching on Southsea Common and attracting the notice of the Bishop of Win chester, who heard him one Sunday night."], [39, "THE FULNESS OF JOY. 27 Paul Rushbrand was always a well-conducted lad, but his mind was, I believe, never seriously awakened to religious faith until he was three and-twenty, when he went out to China as steward on board a ship that carried a mis sionary. The influence of this good man, and various impressive events in the journey, pro duced a marked influence on Paul's mind, so that when he returned two years later he began to preach the Gospel among the sailors, police men, and dockyard workmen of Portsmouth, by all of whom he was much respected. Indeed, his eloquence was of such a powerful, manly sort, and so well adapted to the comprehension of his audience, that the Bishop decided at once, after hearing him, that he would make an admirable minister to carry the doctrines of the Church among the poor. Accordingly he took him in hand, put him at a private theological college under his own superintendence and at his own expense, and in due time admitted him into holy orders. I am persuaded he would have done much for him had he lived.' ' All this is very interesting,' remarked Mr. Pottinger, as he walked by the Rector's side ; ' but do you mean that Mr. Rushbrand has no friends ? Has he been living entirely on his salary as a curate ? ' ' He has both lived, and supported his step mother, the Frenchwoman, on 60/. a year, for,"], [40, "28 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. with characteristic pride, he used to lay by 20/. of his income in order to repay the Bishop's executors the money which his Lordship dis bursed for him at the theological college.' ' Dear me ! And I need hardly ask \u2014 Mr. Rushbrand is a sound Churchman ? ' 'Well, he is a staunch Protestant ! ' was Mr. Fulmouth's rather evasive reply. Mr. Pottinger's mind was not of a size to grasp the immense grandeur of a life such as Paul Rushbrand's \u2014 a career of sturdy, patient wrestling with, and virile triumph over, all the difficulties that beset a youth of low station who seeks to climb unaided the steeps of learning and self-culture. Nevertheless, all that he heard pleased him well. In proposing a perfect stranger for the vicarship he had been moved by no calculating impulse ; but once the election had been accomplished, it had naturally oc curred to him that he had done a good stroke of business in laying the new Vicar under such a great personal obligation to himself; and now that he discovered his nominee to be a man of such humble origin, he made doubly sure of being able to act towards him the part of patron and monitor. It would be a great deal to have the new Vicar, so to say, under his thumb, to enjoy the free run of the parsonage, to be the great Church authority in the town, and who knows but that by-and-by, when Miss"], [41, "THE FULNESS OF JOY. 29 Martha Pottinger was a year or two older, some closer tie might bind together the im portant churchwarden and his affluent but sub missive protdgd} So with his mind already filling with the first haze of a golden dream, Mr. Pottinger took his leave of the Rev. Joel, posted his letter, and then hied him back to the Red Lion, with a view to commencing ingra tiatory proceedings by installing himself at the Vicar's bedside, and having a long chat with him. Unfortunately when he arrived the pa tient was delirious, the doctor was engaged in pressing handfuls of broken ice to his burning head, and grave fears were being expressed lest his sickness should terminate fatally. The injuries which he had received were in deed much graver than had at first been sup posed, and, coupled with the excitement of the scenes through which he had passed, had brought on brain fever. During many days the erst hardy life trembled in the balance ; the strong limbs were wasting away, and the sci ence of the local physician was sorely tried to devise alleviations for the torments which his patient suffered. Throughout this period of probation, the Pottingers were most commend able in their devotion. The churchwarden, his wife, his daughter were continually running between the shop and the inn ; and they con tinued their affectionate ministrations even after"], [42, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 30 the arrival of Paul's mother-in-law, a curious little old Frenchwoman, who, after stating that she was a Protestant, greatly shocked the grocer and his family by telling her beads, hanging a crucifix over the bedside, and burning tapers by it ; ' for,' said she, coolly, to account for this heterodoxy, ' plain prayers may be good enough, Messieurs, when we have nothing much to ask, but, when there is anything urgent, God requires something better.' It was touching enough to see this homely alien woman, with her odd manners and quick, sparkling eyes, that spoke of bygone beauty, tending with a mother's care the couch of one who was not her son. She evidently loved him with a love equal to that which women bestow on their first-born, and, in her broken English, more than corroborated all that Mr. Fulmouth had said in Paul's favour. His behaviour to her had been one long, beautiful tale of filial dutifulness, protection, and kindness, so that he had consoled her for her husband's misconduct, consoled her even for being childless, and it was out of love for him that she had remained in England after becoming a widow instead of returning, as she would otherwise have done, to her own land and kindred. All these things getting bruited about through the agency of the Pottingers, much enhanced public interest in the patient, and in particular stimulated the"], [43, "THE FULNESS OF JOY. 31 churchwarden's hopes for his recovery to an in tense degree ; for, thought this worthy man, so tender-hearted and dutiful a son must assuredly be easy to manage. At last the well-wishers saw their desires realised ; for a strong constitution, bred of temperance, soberness, and chastity, prevailed against disease, and the critical period was passed through in safety. But even after the dan ger of death was gone, many more days elapsed before the mind re-awoke to consciousness, and fully two months had sped before the patient could understand the causes of his illness, which had been clean blotted out of his memory, or his rise in the world, which appeared like a dream. Meanwhile, public fame had been making a hero of him. The circumstances of his election had been so romantic that they had been seized and commented upon by all the newspapers from end to end of the country. When the strange tale of his boyhood and youth had come out, illustrated journals pub lished portraits of him ; the Royal Humane Society voted him a medal; the Press teemed with letters from persons who had known him during the seafaring part of his career, and bore testimony to his worth of character ; and hereat scores of gushing young ladies and budding poets despatched to his address congratulatory odes and sonnets, or albums, with the request"], [44, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 32 that he would sign his name in them. When it was feared that the illness was about to take a fatal turn these tokens of admiration were multiplied ; even Royalty did not disdain to send messages of inquiry as to his progress ; and of course all the neighbouring country families left cards at the Red Lion \u2014 from Lord Hartleigh and his mother, the leading mag nates, down to Sir Peter Carew and his noisy brood of grown-up sons and daughters from Royster Hall. No man can be insensible to such tokens of spontaneous, genial worship from his fellows, and though for awhile Paul Rushbrand continued to think by moments that all the wondrous things he heard and saw were hallucinations from which he would at some time be aroused, yet as the conviction gradually worked itself upon his strengthening brain that he was living amid realities, an immense emotion of humility and thankfulness possessed him and bowed his head before the goodness of the Creator. It was a beautiful warm afternoon in the latter days of August when, at length, the doc tors pronounced Paul Rushbrand strong enough to be conducted to the vicarage, which was thenceforth to be his home. Mr. Pottinger had determined that the occasion should be one of public festival. Most of the shops put forth bunting, the church bells rang out a merry peal,"], [45, "THE FULNESS OF JOY. 33 and the school-children, who had been given a half-holiday, were marshalled on either side of the way in holiday garb and with baskets of flowers in their hands. No gladder or more moving sight could have met the Vicar's eyes as he emerged from the inn leaning on his step mother's arm and supported on the other side by the trusty churchwarden. Loud and hearty were the cheers that greeted him from the assembled townspeople ; the school -children burst into a hymn of praise and scattered their flowers on his path ; while the little mite whose life he had saved toddled forward and held up to him a large nosegay, the which brought a gush of tears into his eyes when he had ascer tained who the donor was, and had lifted him in his arms to kiss him. And so, amid singing and blessings and joyful chimes, the humble servant of God, for the nonce a people's darling, walked slowly on his triumphal way, till at the first street corner his dimmed eyes encountered the lovely figure of a girl on horseback who was gazing at him with looks full of pity and interest. She appeared to be about eighteen, and was of a type of beauty at once maidenly and bold. Erect and graceful on her prancing bay, she looked as though she could take part fearlessly in any field sports, but in the soft glance of her clear hazel eyes, in the openness of her pure vol. i. D"], [46, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 34 brow arching under clusters of rich black hair, one could read stainless candour, bright wit, and sweetness. She and her groom had been stopped by the street throng, and with one of her small, gloved hands she was patting the curved neck of her horse, who, startled at the tumult of bells and voices, was tossing his head and pawing the ground. But while thus engaged she remained quite at her ease, and lost not a glimpse of the sight before her \u2014 the which evi dently excited her curiosity, and to some extent stirred her sensibilities, for as the Vicar ap proached she smiled with a slight blush, to intimate that he and his deeds were known to her, and, plucking a brilliant carnation that glowed in the bosom of her habit, threw it among the other floral offerings that were al ready littering the ground. The homage was so prettily rendered and so marked, that the Vicar could not forbear to lift his hat ; while Mrs. Rushbrand stooped to pick up the flower, ancl stuck it into the button-hole of his coat, Mr. Pottinger explaining as she did so, ' That's Miss Amy Carew, one of Sir Peter's daughters.' A few more steps now, and the Vicar had reached his home, where a new surprise awaited him, for Mr. Pottinger had caused a feast to be spread on the lawn of the garden that sloped down to the river. And what a garden it was, with its width of mignonette, geraniums, moss,"], [47, "THE FULNESS OF JOY. 35 blush, and tea roses ; and what a vicarage, with the old ruddy brick walls covered here with ivy, here with honeysuckles and white roses. Fragrance teemed in the warm, balmy air, and whichever way the eye looked it found glad some things to rest on \u2014 whether to the right, where the garden walls were covered with clus ters of scarlet cherries and ripening peaches, or to the left, in the orchard, where many a shapely tree was bowed under its weight of tawny pears or purple plums ; or straight ahead, where the broad, glistening river purled by in a sheet of silver between banks of smooth turf and beds of drooping willows. And over all this fair landscape, which eyes could feast on without ever being sated, the glorious summer sun was pouring its flood of vivifying light, tipping all things that glittered with rays of gold ; so that the Vicar as he surveyed his earthly para dise felt his bosom heave, and raising his glance to the blue dome of the paradise above, murmured : ' Lord, Thou hast dealt bountifully with Thy servant ; but what is man that Thou art mindful of him ? ' And somehow, as he said this, Paul Rush brand thought of the girl on horseback who had thrown him the carnation. D 2"], [48, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 36 CHAPTER III. THE VICAR'S MISSION. The Vicars of Stilborough had always been a very easy-living set of divines, as the size of their parsonage and the excellent condition of its stables and coach-house, as well as the roominess of its wine-cellar, abundantly proved. Generally connected by blood or marriage with the House of Hartleigh, they had been gentle men of the sort who, after passing through some aristocratical public school and the uni versities, ride down the road to ecclesiastical preferment in swift, pleasant stages. Several of them had become deans or archdeacons ; one or two had been raised to bishoprics ; but even to those who had lived and died in the vicar ship, life had been as a cup full of sweetness. Justices of the peace, rural deans, husbands of well-born, comely wives, fathers of ruddy children, great givers and receivers of hospi tality, they had prided themselves upon riding straight to hounds, setting good wine before their friends, and preaching short sermons, and"], [49, "THE VICAR'S MISSION. 37 for all such meritorious doings had garnered the blessings of their contemporaries. Paul Rushbrand's immediate predecessor was the only one who had broken through the easy going tradition by showing himself earnest in Church matters, but this he had done rather as an arch\u00e6ologist than as a minister. Being a scholar and a diligent porer over Dugdale's ' Monasticon,' he had set his heart on restoring his church to the exact condition in which it had flourished as an abbey church previously to the Dissolution, and, by disbursing some 15,000/. out of his own pockets, had succeeded in his ambition, despite the vigorous opposition of Mr. Pottinger and other haters of ' Popish things.' It now became a very interesting matter to speculate how Paul Rushbrand would deal with the crucifixes, candlesticks, and brazen images which his predecessor had set up. There were enough of such to stock a fair-sized museum, and the pagan effect of them was much height ened by rich stained glass windows which shed over nave and aisles a mellow tint of purple and blue. On the day when the grocer took Paul to inspect the church he threw open its doors and made a gesture that seemed to say, ' There ! did you ever see such a collection of foolish things as that ? ' and, strutting towards the chancel, he expatiated on the trying times"], [50, "38 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. which he and other devout souls had passed through under a rdgime of choral services, matins, and vespers, so that 'yonder big painted organ was blowing all day fit to burst itself.' To his mortification Paul expressed no dis approval. He said nothing in direct appro bation either, but walked about examining, and when remarks were made he answered by nods. The fact is he was as yet too shy to commit himself to any opinion that might involve con troversy. He was by temper peaceful, and felt a natural wish to live on good terms with all of his parishioners, so that for a time he not a little disappointed those who, judging by his past career of energy, had expected him to signalise his accession by striking acts. His very sermons were tame, and pleased only the alms-women and other uninteresting paupers in the draughty free seats near the porch. The shopkeeping part of the congregation disliked his delivery, which was deficient in cushion thumping ; as for the local gentry, they smiled at the number of misplaced /is that tingled on their ears ; and if the preacher had looked down into Sir Peter Carew's pew, he would have been hurt to see even Miss Amy exchange more than one amused smile with her brothers and sisters in the course of his sermons. Ah, luckless letter H ! cabalistic sign, riddle,"], [51, "THE VICAR'S MISSION. 39 masonic token by which those who belong to the ranks of gentility recognise one another, and detect those who do not ! There is nothing like it in any other language. The French or German mechanic learns by education to talk like the Duke, and this immediately, without any trouble ; but what years of self-observation and keeping of good company are requisite before the low-born Englishman gets to master those tiresome aspirates, and to pitch his voice in the quiet, well-modulated key peculiar to the frequenters of polished society ! Paul Rushbrand could manage an h well enough in conversation, and when he talked slowly ; but the moment he became excited and spoke fast, he seemed to treat this letter as a foolish and needless ornament to his words, and he discarded it as a colonel might tell his men to throw away the cumbersome plumes from their head-dresses for the practical work of battle. At such moments he also indulged recklessly in double negatives : ' We didn't ought! ' We haven't no need! &c., and also sounded his you's as yer's, ' How, Fll tell yer what,' &c. All this was the habit of his early years cleaving to him as tar sticks to good rope \u2014 almost ineffaceably. He was conscious of his sailing, however; strove daily and hourly to correct it;- and this being so, no wonder that his promotion should"], [52, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 40 have stricken him with diffidence. He still felt as powerfully as in his ship-boy days reverence for the gentleman \u2014 a belief in him as the em bodiment of all good and gracious qualities and social niceties ; and his notions about gentle women had something of exaggerately romantic worship, for the reason that he had never en joyed the intimate acquaintance of a genuine lady. It puzzled him to reflect that he now stood on a footing of equality with persons at whom he had always been wont to look up. Every time that he came into his vicarage, re plete with the luxurious furniture which the late incumbent had placed there, every time that he was waited upon by the neat-handed servants whom his step-mother had hired, every time that hats were lifted to him in the street, there was a flutter at his heart as under the touch of exces sive honour ; and he was in a manner stunned when he received a kindly notification from the Lord Lieutenant that his name had been put on the Commission of the Peace, that he might serve as magistrate, as all previous holders of his benefice had done. Of course, Paul Rushbrand's sentiments of diffidence, though they proceeded from a spirit of true humility, were such as it was certain time would wear away, but while they lasted they raised incessant whisperings in his conscience that Heaven could only have ex alted such a one as himself for the accomplish-"], [53, "THE VICAR'S MISSION. 41 ment of some arduous, perhaps perilous labours, which would be shown forth in due season. He repeated this to his step-mother, not for the first time by many, one day that he noticed her exceeding care to surround him with crea ture comforts. The honest little lady had never found herself at the head of such pecuniary resources as she was now disposed of, and with the luxury-loving instincts of her country, she was doing her best to convert the parsonage into a palace of sybaritish ease. ' Well, I may avail myself of your good things whilst I am able,' said Paul, with a smile. ' I expect the day will soon come when I shall be roused from my sloth.' ' Why, what do you call sloth ? ' exclaimed the little Frenchwoman, cheerily. ' You're abroad most of the day visiting the poor, and, when you do get a minute's leisure, you spend it burrowing into musty books. I call that hard work enough for a saint.' ' It is not hard work, for it is a pleasure ; but I doubt not I shall soon have work that will be hard. And if God measure the difficulty of my mission by my willingness to undertake it, my coming tasks will be severe indeed.' ' Why, what nonsense that is, my dear Paul ! ' exclaimed Mrs. Rushbrand, almost impatiently, and speaking all the while in French. ' Why, what \" mission \" can God be reserving you ?"], [54, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 42 You have been a good son, a good lad, a good man, and Heaven has sent you your reward. That is the whole of the matter.' ' The harvest does not come in spring,' re joined Paul, gently. ' I am too young to have earned my rest, much less my reward.' ' Too young at thirty ! Why, plenty of men contrive to ruin themselves and break their parents' hearts by that age ! But I'll tell you what, Paul, your fears for the future seem to me to be ungrateful, for it is as though you had said God could make us no good present with out there being something unpleasant behind it. God's gift-horses will bear looking into the mouth, my lad.' ' No doubt,' answered Paul, somewhat hum bled. ' And the best way you can take of proving your thankfulness is to enjoy what He sends you,' continued she, following up her advantage. ' And, by the way, there's that tailor has brought home your new suit of clothes to-day. I hope you will put them on to-morrow to call on Mi lord Hartleigh, who has been so kind. I hear he has returned from London.' ' Will you come with me to Hazelwood ? I rather dread going alone,' remarked Paul, win cing. ' I go with you, mon ami ? ' exclaimed the old lady, and laughed a gay laugh that brought"], [55, "THE VICAR'S MISSION. 43 a sparkle to her eyes. ' Oh, ncnni, my junket ting days are over, if so be that I really ever had any (here she heaved a short sigh). All I'm good for now is to be your old housekeeper, and see that you spend some of your money on yourself instead of giving it all away, as you certainly would do if I wasn't there to keep order. No, no, make yourself smart, my good Paul. Go and see your fine friends alone, and, if you can pick up a pretty, well-dowered wife from among them, I'll give up my cupboard keys to her with a blessing ! ' ' I do wish I could avoid going,' replied Paul, turning off the last remark with a smile. ' And why ? ' inquired his vivacious step mother, preparing to ladle soup out of the smoking tureen before her. ' Heigho ! here is a great aoostle who five minutes ago was ask ing Heaven for more work, and who now hesi tates at that which lies in his very path ! Why, it is part of your duty to see Milord Hartleigh, my son. How do you know that the \" mission\" of which you were speaking does not in some way concern him ? ' ' To be sure,' answered Paul, rousing at the thought. ' Thank you for reminding me of my duty, mother.' ' Yes, dear ; but be careful of what you say to the Milord,' observed the shrewd little Frenchwoman, holding out a hand coaxingly"], [56, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 44 to him across the table, as if she were afraid she had urged him on too far. 'Remember, it's not preaching that will be wanted at Hazel wood, for there is a great difference between the rich and poor. The poor are often so ignorant as not to know why they deserve going to hell ; but the rich sin with their eyes open, being prepared to pay the cost before hand ; so that it's of no use to tease them about it.' To which profoundly wise remark Paul answered nothing, for he was accustomed to the occasional mundane philosophy of his father's widow. He would still have been glad of any truth ful excuse for deferring his visit to Hazelwood until he had at least nerved himself a little more for facing fine company ; but as no such excuse was vouchsafed him, he hired a dog-cart next day at the Red Lion, and was driven in his new clothes along three miles of lovely scenery to one of the most picturesque and splendid country mansions in England. He had timed his visit so as to arrive when luncheon was over, but the shooting season having just commenced, Lord Hartleigh had gone out into the turnip fields with a party of friends, and the only person left at home was his mother. Paul was conducted by a gorgeous domestic in plush and powder through a sue-"], [57, "THE VICAR'S MISSION. 45 cession of apartments the like of which he had never seen for magnificence, and so into a boudoir, where Lady Hartleigh was reading a book of sermons, with a couple of plump pug dogs curled up on the sofa beside her. She was a handsome lady of fifty, who con trived to look ten years younger. The glossy chestnut hair, so tastefully dressed up under her tiny lace cap, was scarcely streaked with silver ; her complexion was still fresh ; her brow smooth ; her teeth white ; her blue eyes clear and nearly exempt from crowsfeet. Her manners were most engaging, for she was one of that delightful order of womanhood who would rather be fascinating a cat on a post than nothing at all. Holding out a jewelled hand to Paul, and smiling with the utmost cordiality, she told him she was delighted to receive his visit ; and with a few pleasant chatty words succeeded in putting him very nearly at his ease. A good hour's gossip came to her Lady ship just like a godsend at that moment, and she prepared for it by taking up a piece of tapestry to keep her fingers employed whilst her sprightly tongue wagged. First she touched on some London topics \u2014 opera, picture-exhi bitions, and so forth ; but finding them terra incognita to the bashful Vicar, she ascertained, with a woman's prompt wit, with what subjects he was familiar, and descanted upon Ports-"], [58, "46 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. mouth, Cowes, sea, and shipping (the late Lord Hartleigh had kept a yacht), in such wise as to make him pass an hour most agreeably. He was abashed to perceive how rapidly time had slipped by, and would have risen to go ; but she would not hear of it, and assured him that Lord Hartleigh must be back very soon now. He had set out with the Carews, Sir Giles Taplow, and some other neighbours as early as five o'clock, and several ladies, among them the Misses Carew, had afterwards gone to join them at luncheon. As gentlemen seldom did much shooting after luncheon, and it was now four, the whole party might be expected home any minute. ' They are charming girls, the Misses Ca rew,' added her Ladyship. ' Do you know them, Mr. Rushbrand ?' ' By sight,' answered Paul, colouring, as he always did at the name. ' I purposed calling one day this week at Royster Hall' ' You will find them all very nice and hos pitable ; and Sir Peter is a most amiable old man, who wears his heart on his sleeve.' ' There is no Lady Carew, I believe ? ' ' No, she died more than ten years ago, and it was a sad pity, for Sir Peter was hardly fitted to bring up children, and he allowed all his boys and girls to run wild. Some consider that the girls are terribly fast ; as for the brothers"], [59, "THE VICAR'S MISSION. 47 they are of course up to their necks in extrava gance of every sort, but this is only natural in spirited young men, so much spoiled as they have been at home and still are now by Society. I sometimes have my misgivings, however, as to whether they are the companions best suited to my son.' The Vicar coughed. ' Lord Hartleigh has been so well trained that I should think he would be impervious to any bad example.' ' Well, let us hope so ' \u2014 but here Lady Hartleigh sighed. ' Ah, Mr. Rushbrand, there you have touched a sore point. I am at present in the deepest distress about my son.' ' I am truly sorry to hear that,' answered Paul, feeling uncomfortable at what he had done. ' Yes, and I feel inclined to make a con fidant of you,' added her Ladyship, ' dropping her hands into her lap, and looking trustfully at him. ' Indeed, I had half made up my mind to write to you had you not come, for I felt it necessary to see you, as you may be of con siderable assistance to me in this matter. I am grieved to say, Mr. Rushbrand, that my son has contracted a liaison with a person in every way his inferior in rank, education, and cha racter.' ' A clandestine marriage ? ' suggested Paul, dismayed."], [60, "48 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. ' No ! Heaven be praised, it has not come to that yet, although there is no telling what may happen through the wiles of an unscru pulous and designing person. You see, Mr. Rushbrand, my son lost his father five years ago, so that he came into all his large property as soon as he was of age. He is only two-and twenty now, and when a man is so young and so rich he becomes a butt for the schemes of adventurers of both sexes.' ' I suppose that must unfortunately be the case. ' Add to this that my son is of a sweet and gentle disposition, easy to manage, which must account for the hold that has been taken upon him by this person, a certain Helen or Nelly Lees. I believe she was a governess, and my son met her whilst on a fishing excursion with two friends in the North. As she is a creature of prepossessing features, he appears to have been quickly attracted towards her, and the usual consequences followed. My son seduced the girl, as they call it, though the term is ab surd in a case where all the seduction was on her side, and they have been together ever since. I am informed that she is residing in your town at the present moment.' ' You don't say so ! ' murmured Paul, in the same tone as if he had'been apprised that the Gorgon had taken up her abode in Stilborough."], [61, "THE VICAR'S MISSION. 49 ' Wherever my son is, there she goes,' said Lady Hartleigh, with a little shrug, and taking up her work again. ' Now of course you understand, Mr. Rushbrand, that if this were an ordinary liaison I should not feel much con cern about it. Those things are very improper, no doubt, but young men will be young men, and in certain cases I have known youths be much benefited as regards development of character by a liaison with some disinterested, sensible girl at the outset of their lives ; such partnerships may often be termed the prepa ratory schools to marriage. But when there is any danger of a nobleman of great estates giving his name and fortune to his mistress, and introducing her under the roof where his mother has lived, then there is cause for the worst alarm ; and unfortunately I have reason to dread that the person to whom I am al luding is employing all the arts of her depraved nature to induce my son to marry her.' ' Is she a person utterly devoid of educa tion ? ' inquired Paul. ' No ; I think I mentioned that she was a governess, and her father, who is still living, is, I understand, a poor country clergyman.' 'And is he aware of his daughter's goings on ? ' asked Paul, with a pang of fellow-feeling for his afflicted clerical colleague. ' I do not know, I am sure,' said Lady VOL. I.

No, Mr. Rushbrand, neither laws nor parental authority have any power over these persons, who are free to prey upon Society, stealing away both the fortunes and honour of those who fall into their toils ; and, therefore, it is of more importance that honest people should band together against them for self-protection. I am persuaded that you look at this matter in the same light as I do, and, therefore, I must ask you in the event of any rumour of marriage coming to your ears \u2014 as, for instance, if you were requested to solemnise a marriage pri vately \u2014 at once to communicate with me, in order that my misguided boy may be rescued in time from his infatuation.

' Thank you ; and perhaps you will not be offended if I ask you kindly to call on the girl, who is at present one of your parish ioners, and expostulate with her secretly on the state of deadly sin in which she is living.

There was one particular ser mon on ' Sudden Death ' which had produced a most powerful impression on her, and perhaps it would rouse similar emotions in the breast of sinful Miss Lees ; if Mr. Rushbrand thought so, she should be happy to lend him the book. All this while Paul sat with his hat between his knees, dumbfoundered and almost doubting the sanity of his hostess ; for to hear her descant on the deadly sinfulness of Miss Lees, whilst she seemed utterly unmindful of the equal guilti ness of her son, and to see her so well versed in the penalties that overtake sinners after sud den death, and yet so apparently oblivious of the fact that she herself, judging her by her sentiments, might have as much cause to dread these penalties as anyone else \u2014 all this was bewildering to a simple mind that had not estab lished two sets of weights and measures for the gauging of sin. However, Paul was spared the trouble of answering any of Lady Hartleigh's remarks, for, as she stretched out her hand towards the volume of sermons, she caught sight through a window of her son returning from sport, and called the Vicar's attention to e 2"], [64, "52 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. him. In effect, Paul's glance following hers, he perceived a gay cavalcade dashing up the mile long avenue of poplars and elms that led to the Hall. There was a smart break, freighted with a party of gentlemen all smoking and holding guns between their knees, ancl behind a cloud of young horsewomen, cantering merrily, among whom Paul recognised Amy Carew. Soon the mirthful sounds of laughter and pleasant banter arose as the party were heard alighting at the door and streaming into the house, while the leashed pointers and spaniels, sniffing at the game-bags, barked their good-night, and were answered in yelps by Lady Hartleigh's pug dogs, who leaped off the sofa and ran to thrust their black muzzles under the door. A few minutes more and the door opened, admitting a comely youth, whom Lady Hartleigh introduced as her son."], [65, "53 CHAPTER IV. A FEAST DAY. Lord Hartleigh looked more like a boy come to ask his mother for pocket-money than like a lawgiver with 50,000/. a year. He had evi dently not finished growing. He had no face hair, but a slight shade of down on the upper lip. His complexion was pink and full of laughing dimples as a girl's ; and the juvenility of his general appearance was enhanced by the brown velvet knickerbocker suit which he was wearing. But such as he stood, Lord Hartleigh was a peer who had already given undoubted promise of future worth, and who had nothing soft or foolish in his composition. Not reckon ing his proficiency in the saddle and with the breech-loader \u2014 qualities which English squires inherit from that kind Providence which endows us all with gifts suitable to our callings \u2014 he had shown himself industrious at school and college, so that he had come away from Cambridge with a good degree ; and now he was learning the management of his estate at a pace which"], [66, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 54 augured that he would soon be an expert in the science of renewing leases, selling cattle, and disputing with a prevaricating tenant about cottage improvements. His demeanour was full of aristocratical self-possession, and his manners were graced by a dignified courtesy that had considerable charm in one of such youthful as pect. It might be that Lord Hartleigh felt most at home in field or covert, or with a bat in his hands hitting loose balls to leg ; but what ever might be the duty which he was called upon to perform, whether he was seconding the reply to the Queen's Speech in the House of Peers, or presiding at an agricultural dinner, or doing the honours of his hospitable home, he bore himself as beseemed his rank, in a manner equally free from shyness or arrogance. Shaking hands with Paul Rushbrand, he expressed great pleasure at making his ac quaintance, and invited him to stay to dinner. Paul reflected that if he remained for dinner he should be obliged to pay an extra sovereign for his dog-cart ; but as his mother had instantly recommended that he should accept any invita tion that seemed given in earnest, he consented on being pressed a second time. Lord Hart leigh forthwith relieved him of all qualms about the dog-cart by remarking that he would send him home in company with the Carews, whose way back to Royster lay through Stilborough ;"], [67, "A FEAST DAY. 55 and this point settled, took him downstairs to introduce him to the Carews and other persons of note in the county. All these distinguished people were con ferring as to how they could beguile the three hours intervening before dinner, and mean while were refreshing themselves with tea and cakes, or sherry and bitters. The entrance of Paul, tall, solemn, crop-headed, and still ema ciated from his illness, operated at first as a damper ; but, when it became known who it was, he was welcomed, and a disposition was evinced to make a lion of him. Such good-will could not have endured long in any ordinary assembly, owing to the Vicar's awkward man ner of receiving the compliments addressed to him, but the present company seemed the freest and liveliest under the sun, so that Paul was at no loss to perceive that whether he re mained grave or joined in the general merriment was a matter that would soon concern himself more than anyone else. He was introduced to Lady Ambermere, a pretty, fluffy-haired widow of twenty-six, possessor of broad acres ; to Colonel Pounceforth, of the Blues, a tall, hand some, dark-moustached soldier, who was dan cing attendance on her Ladyship ; to Captains Warrener and Hunt, types of muscular, manly beauty, too, the one a Hussar, the other a Lan cer ; to Sir Giles Taplow, an exceedingly fat"], [68, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 56 landowner, not more than thirty years old, but blear-eyed and already half bald ; and, last, to Sir Peter Carew, M.P. for Stilborough, and his family, or rather to as many of its members as were present, for the full effective strength of Sir Peter's household amounted to six sons and five daughters. All the daughters were there, with two of the sons, and no finer progeny ever swelled the breast of a father with pride. Well might any childless man who had beheld the bloom ing loveliness of the daughters, and the stal wart limbs and brave faces of the sons have murmured, ' Happy is he that hath his quiver full of them.' Unfortunately, they were most expensive children to support, and had poor Sir Peter's quiver been filled with a few more of them he must have marched towards the workhouse. As it was, those best acquainted with the state of his private affairs averred that his course was already steadily on the drift towards that parochial institution, for he had inherited but 5,000/. a year from his father on coming into his estate a quarter of a century before, and ever since that time he had done nothing but spend without ever increasing his income by a sixpence. Nor had his children ever added to the paternal store, but, on the contrary, drained from it with unanimous regu larity. The eldest son, Oswald, was in the"], [69, "A FEAST DAY. 57 Blues, the second in the Lancers, the third a barrister without briefs, the fourth a naval lieutenant, the fifth and sixth were Government clerks, the one in the Foreign and the other in the War Office. None of these fashionably occupied young men could of course by any possibility live within their earnings ; all the less so as when not attending to their profes sional duties they were (with the exception of the sailor) to be found driving four-in-hands, riding steeplechases, shooting pigeons, or play ing cricket matches at Lord's and Prince's. They all belonged to first-rate clubs, and dressed in such wise that it was a treat to look at them ; they kept a valet apiece, a groom, and at least one hunting horse ; they dined at the tables of the great during the season, passed the autumn and winter in a round of country visits, and never missed a race meeting of any importance, or a grand ball worth going to. Everybody was glad to know them, to bet with them, or to have them as guests ; for not only were they good-looking, cheerful, thoroughly gentlemanlike young fellows, but they carried into all they did an amount of healthful energy most invaluable to those who hunted pleasure in their company. It was much the same with the daughters as with the sons. They were general favourites, but had never done anything to bring grist to"], [70, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 58 the family mill. The two eldest, who might have married rich peers had they pleased, had made love-matches, and were wedded to Cap tain Warrener and Captain Hunt\u2014 two military Adonises, who, after sale of their commissions and payment of their bachelor debts, had an income of about 400/. a year apiece to meet expenditure of at least four times that amount. The three younger daughters, Isabel, Amy, and Georgina, were unmarried ; but they had never evinced the slightest disposition towards setting traps for wealthy husbands, and seemed quite content to continue ior ever as they were doing \u2014 that is, go into Society under the chaperonage of their married sisters, dance, hunt, skate on rollers, flirt a little, dress expensively, and be made love to with more or less warmth and sincerity by men of all ages and conditions. Worthy Sir Peter doted -on all his children alike, and could not bring it to his heart to re fuse anything that they begged of him in reason or out of it. To be sure he would now and then growl that it was high time his sons-in-law, Hunt and Warrener, did something to support themselves and their wives ; and he would fly out into hot bursts of anger when his sons overdrew their allowances so as to leave him in debt to his bankers. But whenever his married daughters wanted money they had only to twine their white arms round his neck, sitting on his"], [71, "A FEAST DAY. 59 knees, and talking of their babies, and he then felt as though he would sell his last pair of boots to please them ; whilst as to his sons, he was easily pacified about their extravagance by read- ing the newspapers which chronicled their ex- ploits as gentleman-riders or batsmen. A large, lion-headed, woman-hearted giant of a patriarch was Sir Peter, who never felt so happy as when he saw all his children, married and single, gathered together under his roof and eating of the huge joints which he loved to carve with his own hands in the ancestral hall where his fathers had feasted for ten generations. And his children on their side repaid the old man's affection with interest, and were all, as brothers and sisters, heartily fond of one another, so much so that if one among them got into a scrape, the rest would labour with combined wits, hearts, and diligence to pull him out, nor ever reproach him afterwards for the trouble they had incurred on his account. Such union in large families is too rare not to be note- worthy ; and yet what a pitiful waste of homely virtues and generous qualities was there to be observed! Surely any moralist who had watched the Carews could not have helped re- flecting on what great things so much cheerful- ness, energy, courage, and family concord could have achieved if directed towards a worthy ob ject. Had the Carew family been transplanted"], [72, "60 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. to some desert tract of Australia, they would soon have founded a strong and prosperous colony ; and had any one of the sons been forced from early life to work for his tread, he must rapidly have carved his way to inde pendence, perhaps to wealth and dignity. But fortune and paternal indulgence having cast in the lot of the Carews with the drones instead of the bees, they could only labour after their kind, and ate the honey of life instead of fur nishing it. Paul had not seen Amy Carew, save at a distance, since the day when she had thrown the carnation to him, and, presentations being now over, she reminded him laughingly of the fact. In her close-fitting black habit, and with the coquettish silk hat tilted forward on her dark hair, she looked enchanting ; and Paul could scarcely take his eyes off her as she sat on a low chair stirring her tea and ' drawing him out ' to talk. ' I hope you kept the pink I threw you the other day, Mr. Rushbrand,' she said, archly. ' I saw you put it into your button-hole.' ' Yes, I have kept it,' for he could not tell a lie, though he reddened to the roots of his hair. ' Oh, how very gallant ! But I'm sure you only say that to spoil me. Do you know it was very brave of you to rescue that little boy as you did from the fire ; and they say you have"], [73, "A FEAST DA Y. 61 been so kind to the family since, giving them money and all sorts of things.' ' They lost all they had, for the cottage was completely destroyed,' replied Paul. ' Yes, and all because of that wretched fire engine, which didn't come in time ! But there's always something wrong with engines. We have one at R oyster, which doesn't work at all, so that if ever a fire breaks out we shall be burned up like chips, as I've told papa twenty times. But, by the way, Mr. Rushbrand, why haven't you yet come to see us at Royster ? ' ' It was my intention to call this week. I'm afraid I have to apologise.' ' Well, we shall be very glad to see you at any time, and there are so many of us that you may always be sure of finding some one at home to do you the honours of the hall, a dear old place, full of \" windows that exclude the light, and passages that lead to nothing.\" But you must mind and come in ten days' time for the races ; we shall be very gay then.' ' Races at Stilborough ! ' ejaculated Paul, as tonished. ' Yes ! haven't you heard of them ? ' said Amy, raising her eyebrows. 'Why, the course runs through papa's grounds, so that during three days we are regularly invaded. Thou sands of people come down from London, and our house is always full of country neighbours."], [74, "62 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. I hope you don't disapprove of racing, Mr. Rushbrand ? ' ' I have never seen a horse-race,' was Paul's answer. ' But you must have seen yacht races. Well, it's much the same thing, only different, livelier, and with more betting,' ' I am sorry for the betting,' remarked Paul, gravely. ' I have always enjoyed a yacht race well enough without it.' ' Oh, I am afraid you will think me very wicked, then, for I delight in betting,' laughed Amy. ' Why, I made a bet this very afternoon against the favourite in the Town Plate \u2014 a money bet, too ! Ask Sir Giles Taplow if I didn't make a money bet with him. But he will answer, \" No ! \" for I made him promise not to tell anybody. Didn't I, Sir Giles?' But here, perceiving a rather shocked expression on the Vicar's face, she merrily handed him her cup to put down, and, jumping up, proposed a game of croquet. ' Here, Maud ! Alice ! Bella ! Sir Giles ! and you, Lord Hartleigh ! Mr. Rush brand is going to play croquet with us ! We shall have time for a game before the first bell, and I can play in my habit.' The party sallied out on the lawn, and a mallet was put into the Vicar's hands. He was an adept at the game, from having played with Mr. Fulmouth's children; but, whilst attend-"], [75, "A FEAST DAY. 63 ing to his red-ringed ball, he kept his eyes about him for the purpose of observing the manners of this company, and for so doing was rewarded by one or two facts that came under his notice. First he took mental note of the circumstance that pretty Lady Ambermere was not only a great gossip, but a flirt, for while accepting the attentive service of Colonel Pounceforth, she cast frequent glances towards Oswald Carew, and did her best to inveigle him into her train by asking him to take charge of her handker chief and gloves, hold up the skirts of her riding habit while she croquetted, and so forth ; all this to the Colonel's evident chagrin and to Captain Carew's satisfaction. Next he perceived with some astonishment that Lord Hartleigh was very sedulous in making himself agreeable to Isabel Carew, who was a replica picture of her sister Amy, and who met the young peer's ad vances in the same spirit in which they were made \u2014 that is, not too coyly ; but from this couple the Vicar's attention was soon directed towards Amy herself, who wras being frequently whispered to and joked with by Sir Giles Tap low. From that moment Paul Rushbrand hated this fat baronet. He remembered having seen him loafing through the streets of Stil borough in a suit of velveteens, with a bull-dog at his heels, and having taken him for a cadger ; and now that he had an opportunity of studying"], [76, "64 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. him closer, it seemed to him that he had made even too fair an estimate of him. Sir Giles divided his time between dogs, horses, and beer tankards, and not only did his clothes reek of the effluvium of kennels and stables, but his sayings did too. He was a great utterer of broad jests, and would relate in the presence of ladies anecdotes to make decent men's ears redder \u2014 his grinning maxim being that ' the other sex liked it.' Having given vent to one of these highly-spiced narratives and caused Lady Ambermere to titter whilst all the other ladies cried 'Oh!' Sir Giles was for his transgression pelted with rose-leaves by Amy ; whereat the Vicar mused that if some harder missiles could have been substituted for rose leaves, the evil would not have been great. But now the ringing of the first dinner-bell caused playthings to be put aside, and a general adjournment was made towards dressing-rooms. With a host's courtesy Lord Hartleigh escorted Paul to the chamber prepared for him, and mentioned that the next bell would ring in half an hour. Paul was glad to have that interval for solitary reflection, for much of what he had seen and heard that day troubled him ; and yet, endeavour as he would to bring his meditations to bear on what Lady Hartleigh had told him concerning her son, and what he himself had observed in his host, his thoughts glided away"], [77, "A FEAST DAY. 65 from the points on which he would have fas tened them, and returned ever towards Amy. The window was open, and he stepped out on to a balcony that commanded a view of Hazel wood Park, then bathed in the last rosy rays of the setting sun. The sweet piping of a night ingale arose from a neighbouring tree, trans cending the last twitters of lesser birds calling to one another from their roosts ; herds of fallow deer who had finished browsing were trooping slowly towards a glinting lake to slake their thirst before retiring for the night to the shelter of stately oaks and leafy chesnuts ; a few bats were beginning to hover in erratic flight ; and a faint breeze that stirred the branches caused some autumn leaves to fall with a rustlings murmur and litter the sward with waifs of many a sere tint, from the pale gold of the acacia to the blood-red of the maple. It was a prospect well fitted to expand the breast with soft emotions, and as the Vicar stood and gazed, admiring and pensive, he was conscious of something' flowing within him and quickening his pulses, as it were a new life and hope. The sensation was undefinable and strange, as it always appears to those who experience it for the first time \u2014 this sensation which grows but once in a man during life, when the heart which has till then lain fallow begins to put forth its first flowers. vol. 1. F"], [78, "66 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. Several minutes had Paul stood wrapped in contemplation, when the sound of voices broke on his ear close to him, and he became aware that two persons were conversing in the room next his, which looked out on to the same balcony. He was about to retire when he recognised the voices to be those of Amy's two brothers, Oswald and Philip ; and curiosity tied him to the spot, so irresistible was the attraction he now felt towards anythino- or anyone connected with her who reigned in his thoughts. The younger brother, the Lancer, while splashing water in his basin, was speaking to Oswald \u2014 him in the Blues. . ' I say, old man, I hope we shall be able to make decent books on this Stilborough meet- ing. I was awfully hard hit at Goodwood. Do you believe in Bluebell for the Town Plate ? ' 'No. I noticed something queer in her off hind fetlock to-day when Hartleigh showed her to us in the stables. My belief is she'll go lame before the race, so I laid Hartleigh twenty to twelve against her in monkeys, and got Taplow to take the same odds, for he doesn't know a horse from a tea-kettle, though he thinks he does.' ' Have you noticed how he's spooning on Amy ? '"], [79, "A FEAST DAY. 67 ' Yes ; I wish to goodness she'd marry him, for he's not such a brute as he looks ; and I wish Bella would play her cards well with Hartleigh. A couple of marriages like that would set us all square.' ' H'm ! we want it very bad, don't we ? The family 'bus seems going down hill with all brakes up. The Hebrews won't take my paper at cent, per cent.' ' Nor mine at any price.' ' Ah, but you've a petticoat-string to your bow. How are matters progressing with Louise Ambermere ? ' 1 ' Pounceforth is cutting me out, for he's in earnest,' was Oswald's careless answer. ' I don't like her, and would only make a dash for her if every other stick and stone failed.' Paul had heard enough, and retreated with a weight at his heart. Disgust at the cynicism (for to him it appeared cynicism) with which the brothers talked of marrying their sister to an ill-bred rake in order to repair their own extravagant embarrassments, was overshadowed in him by the fear lest Amy herself should be a party, actively or passively, to such an arrange ment ; and he resolved to watch her closely. But nothing that he observed during dinner gave the slightest colour to his fears ; on the contrary, Amy seemed much more taken up F 2"], [80, "68 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. with himself than with the Baronet, for she frequently asked him, smiling, questions across the table, whereas she barely exchanged half a-dozen sentiments with her neighbour. The repast was most convivial and unceremonious, for all the ladies, excepting Lady Hartleigh, who presided, were in their habits and the gentlemen in shooting-coats. Sir Giles alone, being on a week's visit to Hazelwood, had donned evening clothes, and perhaps it was the starchedness of his collar and white tie that acted as a clog on his jocularity, for he kept his tongue within bounds, and devoted himself to the tranquil mastication of his host's viands and the copious drinking of his wines. Altogether Paul felt his spirits much revive by the sight of Amy's conduct, and he managed to enjoy his dinner, enlivened as it was by the versatile conversation of Lady Hartleigh, by whose side he sat. After dessert he did not join in the cigar-smoking and coffee-drinking which took place on the garden-terrace (for in the way of smoking his seafaring habits had made him contract the habit of a solitary pipe before going to bed) ; but he took a seat beside white headed, bushy-whiskered Sir Peter Carew, and made a friend of that veteran by the respectful way in which he listened to oft-told tales of doings in the Parliament lobbies, and of hair-"], [81, "A FEAST DAY. 69 breadth divisions, wherein if it had not been for his \u2014 Sir Peter's \u2014 timely vote the Consti tution of this realm might have been put in sore peril ! A diamond moon was shimmering high above the trees of the park, when a signal was made for starting homewards, and an order was given for bringing round the horses of the ladies and the break for the gentlemen. As preparations for departure were being made, Lady Hartleigh drew the Vicar aside, and, thanking him again for his visit, repeated her request that he would kindly, if possible, call on ' that ill-regulated girl' adding, ' You have seen my son, Mr. Rushbrand, and can understand what distress a mother must feel at the thought of a young man so good and so full of promise being ruined.' A minute later Lord Hartleigh himself, as he wished his guest good-bye, begged him to renew his visits frequently, and to apply to him (Lord H.) whenever any help should be wanted for church, schools, or chari ties, ' for,' said his Lordship, gravely, ' I take a great interest in Church matters, and in all institutions for moralising the people.' Sir Peter, who had got on to the box of the break, now beckoned to Paul to climb up beside him ; Colonel Pounceforth, with Sir Peter's sons and sons-in-law, clambered in behind ; Lady"], [82, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 70 Ambermere and the five sisters, all mounted, circled round like a body-guard of Amazons ; a pair of grooms brought up the rear ; and the gallant procession dashed off at a swinging trot in the silvery light of the cloudless evening, and with the tinkling laughter of the ladies forming an accompaniment like the music of bells. For many and many a day afterwards did Paul re call that glorious three-mile ride, so brisk, so inspiriting, and the ' good-night ' given him at his own gate when, after he had been set down and was lifting his hat, the horsewomen \u2014 Amy amongst them \u2014 gaily waved their hands to him, and wished him pleasant slumbers. There was a light in the Vicar's usually serious eyes as he entered the parlour, where his stepmother sat up waiting for him, and darning stockings, so that the old lady, looking up through her spectacles, instantly exclaimed \u2014 ' Ah, mon ami, tu as passe ta journee avec Dame Jeunesse, on en voit le reflet sur ta bonne figure ! ' And for the next hour Paul had to sit and answer a hundred affectionately inquisitive que ries as to whom he had seen, what he had done, what he had eaten \u2014 the good little French woman reminding him at every moment of how right she had been to advise him to cultivate ' le monde ou l'on s'amuse.' When at last bed-"], [83, "A FEAST DAY. 71 time came she gave him in a very few words an account of her own day's honest doings, and said, ' Only one person called\u2014 a young lady who has left her card, and said she would come again to-morrow.' Paul took the card and read the name \u2014 ' Miss Helen Lees!"], [84, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 72 CHAPTER V. A PENITENT. The pretty river Still, from which Stilborough derived its name, was bordered by many a pleasing villa inhabited by people who were in easy circumstances without being rich. In one of these, that belonged to the Hartleigh pro perty, a lady had taken up her residence. She kept a footman in livery, two women-servants, and a groom to look after a showy pair of grey ponies which she drove in a chaise. Nobody knew her, and she took no steps to cultivate anybody's acquaintance ; the tradesmen with whom she dealt were paid weekly, and she had no business relations either with the bank or the house-agents in the borough. Her servants were well-trained and discreet, and did not mix with the servants of the neighbours. On the morning after Paul's visit to Hazel wood, this lady, who was Miss Helen Lees, dressed herself with great care in black silk, with gloves and bonnet of the same colour, and a veil ; and thus attired stood grimacing for a"], [85, "A PENITENT. 73 few minutes opposite the looking-glass in her room, evidently trying to compose her face into an expression of dolefulness. She was unde niably pretty, and would have enthralled any lover of the petit style in women, for she was of the daintiest build, having hands and feet exquisitely small, and a mouth so tiny that a cherry could hardly have been thrust into it. Her hair was fair as ears of corn ; the voice with which she called to her maid to come and help her fasten her veil was sweet as a child's ; and there would have been in her whole face the innocent expression of a baby's if it had not been for a lurking fire in her small grey eyes, and one or two lightly-pencilled lines between her brows, which spoke to frequent frowns and a quick temper. She was several minutes drill ing her features into the appearance that was required of them, and only succeeded at last by the aid of a powder puff, which spread an arti ficial pallor over her cheeks. Then she took up an ivory-bound prayer-book, lowered her veil, and walked out of the house. It was a Wed nesday morning, and the bells of St. Barnaby's were ringing for the Litany service, which al ways took place on that day and on Fridays. Very depressing services these were as re gards externals, for no more than a dozen people ever attended them. The late Vicar, who disliked officiating before empty pews, had"], [86, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 74 stipulated for the attendance of the parish school-children and alms-folks ; but Mr. Pot tinger, who thought that church-going, save on Sundays, smacked of Popery, had taken advan tage of Paul's accession to get these paupers manumitted, and none of them now came of their own accord. The minister's voice would ring hollow under the vaults of the fine church which could hold a thousand worshippers with out being full ; and his eye, as it roamed over the expanse of unoccupied seats, would rest for relief on the monumental tombs in the lateral chapels and aisles, where the stone present ments of many a departed Hartleigh and Carew crossed their mailed legs, or rested them upon couchant hounds. But on the morning in question the Vicar had one more worshipper than usual, and when the service was over she remained in her pew with her head buried in her hands \u2014 nay, as Paul went by on his way to the vestry, she suddenly burst into audible sobs. Surprised, he passed on, not daring to intrude on her grief ; but when, having taken off his surplice, he returned to the church and saw- the beadle waiting to close the doors until this lady had finished her weeping, he motioned to him to withdraw, and walked noiselessly down the chancel, taking up a position where the mourner could perceive him, and address him if she"], [87, "A PENITENT. 75 chose. She soon raised her eyes, and, seeing him, made an attempt to rise ; but her strength apparently failed her, and she sank back ex hausted into her seat. Paul at once stepped forward. ' You are in distress ? ' he said gently ; ' but in seeking God's house you have come to the fount of all true consolation. Is there anything I can say to comfort you ? ' ' Oh yes, you of all men in the world. I wished to see you : I called on you yesterday,' she wailed. 'Is it so ? ' said Paul, starting. ' You are Miss Lees then ?' ' Helen Lees, yes \u2014 how did you know my name ? ' ' You left a card at my house.' ' To be sure : I had forgotten it,' she fal tered in broken accents. ' Conscience makes such a coward of me that I fancied my shame was written on my face so that all could see it. Oh, Mr. Rushbrand, is there any hope of par don for a woman who has fallen as low as she can fall, and who prays to God day and night ? ' ' For those who seek Him with tears of true repentance there is every promise of par don,' answered Paul gravely ; ' but will you come into the vestry ? I, too, desired to see you.'"], [88, "76 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. She seemed so weak that he gave her his hand to assist her in walking ; and when she reached the vestry she dropped into one of the high-backed leather chairs and broke out sob bing afresh. Paul closed the door and stood by the table, embarrassed and a little agitated. He had seen that she was pretty, but had not yet 'obtained a full view of her features, owing to her keeping her handkerchief to her eyes. When, at length, she let fall her hands help lessly into her lap and he saw her, by the sunlight that streamed on her, to be so fair, childlike, and frail, he was stricken with com passion, and thought he would spare her the pain of a confession by stating that he was acquainted with her history. This he did as delicately as possible. ' I think I know a great deal of what you would tell me, Miss Lees,' he said in a low tone ; ' and I have felt the more concern in your case from learning that your father is a clergyman. He must be feeling great anxiety about you at this moment ? ' ' Oh, it would break his heart if he knew how I was living,' said she pitifully. ' But have you not considered that he might hear of it at any moment ? Your name might be mentioned in his hearing ' ' Yes he might learn, I know ; but I have done my best to prevent it by changing my"], [89, "A PENITENT. 77 name, so as not to disgrace him. My real name is not Lees, but Truman.' ' Truman ! ' echoed Paul. ' Can it be that you are the daughter of William Truman who went out to China some years ago as a mis sionary ? ' The alarmed tone in which he put this question caused Helen Lees to turn genuinely pale and look a little frightened, as she mur mured an affirmative reply. Then Paul uttered a moan : \u2014 'Oh, Miss Truman, I have no sister, but if you were my mother's child, you could have no greater claim upon me than you have now, being William Truman's daughter. Know that it was your father who first impressed upon my soul the truths of Christianity. We travelled to China in the same ship ; and he converted me from the state of religious heedlessness in which I was living ; I am indebted to him for all that I am now, perhaps I shall owe him my salvation in another life.' ' What must you think of me, then ? ' mut tered Helen, hanging her head in shame. ' If blood of mine could have saved you, you should have had it,' continued Paul ex citedly ; ' and if any effort or sacrifice on my part can now rescue you and lead you to repent ance, you may be sure I shall not fail you.' ' Thank you,' she answered, as if in deep"], [90, "78 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. gratitude. ' Thank you more than I can ex press. I have not sought to hide from you my sinfulness, which is, alas, past hiding, and yet, God knows, I sinned only through love \u2014 love which makes us women so weak ! ' Paul, in grievous distress, was resting his brow on his hand ; and if Helen's emotion had been as sincere as she wished it to seem, she must have been bereft of speech at seeing him so overcome. It was now, however, that she began, unasked, to tell her history, speaking in a low but clear voice, broken occasionally by a quaver that served to carry her words all the deeper into the heart of her hearer. She was one ol a numerous family who had had many privations to suffer. Through ill-health her father had been obliged to resign a curacy which just enabled him to support himself and his children ; and doctors had advised him to go the long sea-voyage to China as his only chance of recovering strength. She (Helen) had then been sent to live with an aunt ; but this relation had not been kind to her. She had made her do drudgery as a servant ; had even maltreated her ; so that eventually Helen had been glad to leave her roof and accept a situation as nursery governess, discharging, for a wretched salary, duties that were almost menial. It was then that she became acquainted with Lord Hart leigh, the first being, save her father, from whom"], [91, "A PENITENT. 79 she had ever heard a gentle word. She loved him at first sight, and he seemed deeply attached to her ; but he had concealed his rank, and gave her to believe that he was nothing more than a medical student who had come to the North for a holiday. Carried away by her passion for him, and believing that he would marry her, Helen had yielded to his solicitations that she should elope with him ; and since then they had been travelling together, the truth as to her lover's wealth gradually breaking on her as she noticed the amount of money he spent on their journeys, till at length, on his bringing her to live at Stilborough, she had learned that he was not only immensely rich, but a peer. Naturally this discovery had filled her with grief and despair. She was soon about to become a mother, and what should she do, characterless and homeless, with a child to support ? \u2014 for she could no longer accept the bounty of a man who could never be her husband\u2014 no, she would not bring up her child with money which would be the wage of dishonour ! At this point of her narrative Helen's voice became inarticulate from sobs again, and she continued to weep in a desponding way, while she faltered through the remainder of what she had to say, explaining the reasons that had induced her to call on the Vicar. She had come to pray for advice. It was impossible"], [92, "80 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. that she should continue to live under Lord Hartleigh's protection, and she could not bear to return to her father's roof, bringing to her family the tidings of her own shame and sin fulness. Under such circumstances could Mr. Rushbrand counsel her as to what she ought to do ? If he could procure her a situation where there was the most repulsive of work to do \u2014 ay, if she had to toil all day on her knees, she would accept it with gratitude. She would accept anything that would enable her to support her child by honest means, for all pride was dead in her, and her sole desire for the future was to lead a life of labour and atonement. Saying which she clasped her hands and turned towards the Vicar a suppli cating look that would have melted a stone. Paul was very much affected. His heart being predisposed in Helen's savour, his mind was thrown off its guard, and he brought to bear no penetration on the probing of what he heard. The more we feel, the less we reason. Paul considered only that he had before him the daughter of a benefactor, who had been wronged and was in need of his succour, so that all that was good and manly in him yearned towards her. ' But why cannot Lord Hartleigh marry you ? ' he inquired after a pause. ' Has he positively refused to do so ? '"], [93, "A PENITENT. 81 ' Oh ! how could he marry me, Mr. Rush brand ? Just reflect how much above me he is. What would his family say to his marrying the daughter of a poor clergyman ? ' ' But he is of age, and consequently has only himself to consult' ' Yes, but I do not blame him. I know I am not good enough for him ; he must marry some lady of his own station who will be a pride and strength to him, which I could never be. . . . And yet I feel that if he could over look the difference in our ranks I should be such a loving wife to him \u2014 so obedient and true ! . . . But I know it cannot be.' ' And why can it not be ? ' exclaimed Paul. ' Lord Hartleigh thought you good enough for him when he stole away your young heart ; and he is the father of your child. Shall he look down on his own flesh and blood ? ' 'He would not do so,' said Amy, fervently ; ' for all his instincts are kind and generous, but there is the pride of his House.' ' Pride ! ' cried Paul, ' such pride is accursed ; it comes from the Devil, not from God ; ' and as he spoke these words, wrath was kindled within him. It was an anger that sprang in part from that innate, ever-slumbering hatred of the plebeian for the noble, which Macaulay has so finely expressed in the words which he puts into the mouth of Icilius calling upon the vol. I. a"], [94, "82 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. Roman crowd to avenge the outrage offered to Virginia. Paul measured with his mind's eye all the distance that separated an English peer from the degraded daughter of a curate ; he thought of Lady Hartleigh's contemptuous vituperation of Helen ; and then he recalled the Prophet Nathan's parable of the rich man who spared to take of his own flocks and herds, and seized the poor man's one little ewe lamb. Dark was his brow, and full of determination was the expression of his closed lips as he asked of Helen when she next expected to see Lord Hartleigh. She answered that he would probably call on her that evening, and named the hour. ' Very well, when he comes I shall stand on his way to meet him,' said Paul. ' For the present come with me, Miss Truman, and let us pray God together for help.' He opened the vestry door ; they returned into the chancel, and he led her to the altar rails, where they both knelt. The church was quite empty, and every word of Paul's rose with striking distinctness, as with uplifted face and hands he cried : \u2014 ' Oh God, who despisest not the sighing of a contrite heart nor the desire of such as be sorrowful, mercifully hear the prayer of this Thy servant, who confesseth her sins to Thee and appealeth to Thy fatherly compassion. Send"], [95, "A PENITENT. 83 her not forth among the outcasts of this world, soften towards her the heart of the man who has wronged her, that he may take her to him, cherish, comfort her, and put away her fault from men's remembrance. And let her so find favour in Thy sight, O God, that being cleansed by Thy divine pardon, she may henceforth, as a wife and mother, lead a life of virtuous ex ample, glorifying Thy holy name. This we beg through the intercession of Thy Son, Jesus Christ, the advocate of all who mourn and re pent ' Helen should have answered ' Amen,' but when Paul turned to hear her response, he found her in a swoon, and had only time to put out his arm to prevent her from falling back on the flags. That evening, towards six, Lord Hartleigh, riding from Hazelwood with Sir Giles Taplow, reined in within bow-shot of Stilborough Bridge, and gave his horse in charge to a groom, or dering him to be in waiting for him at that same place at ten o'clock. Then he turned to speed his companion, who was bound onwards for Royster Hall : ' Remember me kindly to Sir Peter, and say how sorry I was at not being able to go and dine.' ' Trust to me : I'll paint him your grief, and \u2014 give your love to Bella Carew,' laughed Sir Giles, and he rode on. g 2"], [96, "84 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. On the bridge he crossed Paul and nodded to him. A few minutes later, Lord Hartleigh, coming the same way, saw the Vicar leaning on the parapet and watching some urchins fish for minnows. He could have dispensed with meeting him at such a time : nevertheless, he accosted him : \u2014 ' Good evening, Mr. Rushbrand. Come out to enjoy the view of our lazy Still ? ' ' No, my lord, I came out to meet you. I have something of great urgency to say, and should be glad if you could accompany me to the Vicarage.' 'Some good work to do, I'll be bound,' smiled Lord Hartleigh, but meeting no respon sive smile, he looked uneasy. ' Well, you see, I have an appointment in a quarter of an hour ; but I'll come if your business positively won't keep ? ' ' It won't keep for a single hour,' was the Vicar's forcible answer. So the young peer walked on beside him."], [97, "35 CHAPTER VI. MARRIAGE BELLS. Two hours had passed since Mrs. Rushbrand had seen her son enter his study in the company of a stranger, and still the two remained closeted together. The Vicar's evening repast had long grown cold, then been re-warmed in the oven, till, getting gradually burned, it consumed the patience of the little Frenchwoman, who re garded good cooking as the eighth cardinal virtue. She resolved to give Paul's long- ed C> winded visitor the hint to retire, by bouncing into the study, as if unaware that anybody was there, and then retiring with a stammered apology. But, having executed this time honoured stratagem, she was sorry for what she had done, on beholding the Vicar in close and earnest converse with a gentle-looking young man, whose eyes bore the traces of recent tears. It was shortly after this that she heard the stranger being re-conducted to the hall-door ; then Paul came to her with a look of quiet but"], [98, "86 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. Avondrous serenity, and said, ' Mother, will you please prepare one of the best bed-rooms for a visitor who will sleep here to-night. It is a lady, and I should like you to come with me in an hour's time and fetch her from her present residence. She is the daughter of Mr. Truman, of whom I have so often spoken to you, and is coing to be married from this house to-morrow to Lord Hartleigh.' So Paul had prevailed in his contest ! He had done so by the application of immense moral force \u2014 greater, far, than was really re quired, for, whereas he thought that he had to make an oak bend, he had only to deal with a reed which bowed easily under the powerful blast of his mouth. Lord Hartleigh was not puffed up with caste pride, nor perverse ; his nature still retained all the honest impulses of youth, and he had mixed as yet too little with the sceptics of the world not to remain as amenable as in his school and college days to religious arguments and menaces. Moreover, he really was very fond of Nelly Lees, as he called her, and though he had not contemplated marrying her, he had been fully minded to make generous provision for her and her child, so that he was beyond measure dismayed on learning that if he did not take her as his wife she would forsake his protection and never more accept money of him, or see him. Forgetting"], [99, "MARRIAGE BELLS. 87 with whom he spoke, Lord Hartleigh expressed a belief that he should be able to dissuade Nelly from such extreme alternatives ; but Paul sternly rebuked the immoral presumption, and declared that Miss Truman being under his guardianship, he should see that the righteous resolutions she had taken were strictly carried out ; then, throwing off the restraints of con ventional speech, he broke out into the inspired language of prophecy, and foretold to the dis concerted peer God's curse resting on him if he refused to atone for his sin. The woman he had deceived, and the child whom he had begotten would be estranged from him, while, perhaps, she whom he eventually took to wife would bring him no children and no comfort \u2014 or, perhaps, the children whom she bore him would die, whereas his dishonoured child would live, and by living be a cause of daily remorse to him. In some way he might be sure that Heaven's anger would find him out, for there was no place of refuge from the pursuing con sequences of sin. Lord Hartleigh was not prepared for such threats, and quailed. It occurred to him that if he refused to do what was demanded, he should have this new Vicar of Stilborough planted as a thorn in his side ; probably the story would leak out, and public opinion would be arrayed against him ; besides which, if Mr. Rushbrand"], [100, "88 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. took Helen under his roof, and kept her and her child as a living reproach at his gates, it would be almost impossible for him to continue residing on his estate, much less to bring any wife there. Counter-considerations militated against a marriage with a woman whose kin dred were totally unknown to him ; but the chief of these considerations was the fear as to what his mother might say ; and Lord Hart leigh was at an age when a man thinks it a proof of independence to disregard the wishes of his parents in matters that closely affect his own welfare. On the whole, however, let it be granted in fairness, that it was probably the manly wish to repair the evil he had done, and to keep himself unspotted before the world, which finally induced Lord Hartleigh to pro mise, with tears in his eyes, that he would marry Helen Truman. Once this promise had been solemnly given, Paul felt that the nobleman would not retract it. So that all that remained for him to do was to persuade Lord Hartleigh to acquaint his mother with his decision, and prevail on her, if possible, to attend the marriage ceremony. This, however, Lord Hartleigh would not bind himself to do, believing as he did that no good, but only mischief, could come out of it. He thought that his mother would view the match with more equanimity when it was an accom-"], [101, "MARRIAGE BELLS. 89 plished fact ; but he said he would reflect on the point during the night, and in any case would come early into Stilborough on the mor row to procure his marriage licence. This settled, he took leave civilly of Paul, and went away to gladden Helen by proposing to her in due form. It was easy to see by the bride elect's face when she came to the Vicarage at ten o'clock in company with Paul's stepmother, what a differ ence a few hours had wrought in her prospects. She could hardly contain herself for ecstasy, but gave absent replies to remarks made her, issued incoherent orders about her luggage, and seemed unable to keep in any place for more than two seconds at a time. Mrs. Rushbrand, however, who went upstairs with her to help her un pack and make preparations for the morrow, de clared, on coming down, that she was a delightful little thing \u2014 so sweet, unaffected, and expansive ! Doubtless this good lady burned with curiosity to know what hazards had brought such a para gon to be dependent on Paul for a home to be married from ; but the Vicar left it to her own perspicacity to guess the truth. From first to last, whilst Helen remained under his roof, he said not a word that could lower her in any body's esteem, but spoke of her and treated her always with friendly respect. The wedding morning dawned murkily with"], [102, "90 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. chilly grey clouds that boded rain : how often does the weather dress itself in colours appro priate to ceremonies we are going to enact ! ' Merry as a marriage morn ! ' is a phrase that applies only to weddings solemnized in public, amid concourse of friends and with music and toasting ; and for such the sky should deck itself in blue and gold ; but for clandestine marriages nothing suits so well as grey, with a drizzle of rain to prevent the curious from loitering near the church porch. Paul rose betimes, and wrote Helen's new name, ' Helen, Lady Hartleigh,' in the fly-leaf of a Bible which he intended to be his wedding gift ; he also conned over a few words which he purposed speaking at prayers on the blessedness of the wedded state. But Helen did not come down to prayers, and had her breakfast taken up to her room. Though she had not closed her eyes during the night, and had been up and sewing at the bonnet she was to wear long be fore the house was astir, she wished to avoid the chance of being thrown even five minutes alone in the Vicar's company \u2014 no doubt be cause she feared that something in the nature of a sermon was hovering in the air. Up to ten o'clock the Vicar, from his solitary breakfast table, and afterwards from his study, heard the pattering of feminine steps up and down the stairs, and in and out of the house ; and became"], [103, "MARRIAGE BELLS. 91 aware, from scraps of flurried words which he caught, that maid servants were being sent to different tradespeople to buy gloves, tulle, orange-flower blossoms, and other parapher nalia. When at last Helen came down, she shone in all the glory of white bridal attire, and looked angelic perfection \u2014 as if she had had weeks in stead of hours to prepare her apparel \u2014 for such prodigies will the fingers of women accomplish when millinery has to be got ready ! The Bible which Paul offered was modestly and thankfully received, and Helen sat down to wait, but she was evidently nervous, and cast her eyes re peatedly towards the window, in dread lest something should yet occur to prevent the ceremony which was to be the making of her. Nothing occurred, and punctually to the time appointed, a travelling landau debouched into the road, pulled up at the Vicarage door, and Lord Hartleigh alighted. He had stopped at the Surrogate's, on his way through the town, to procure his marriage-licence ; and at a jeweller's to buy the ring and the handsomest present he could find \u2014 a pearl and gold bracelet. Smartly dressed, but wearing the staid look that becomes a bridegroom, his greeting of his bride was just what it should be \u2014 affectionate and quiet \u2014 and he quite won the heart of Mrs. Rushbrand by next bowing to her with infinite grace and cordiality. Whilst Helen was admiring her"], [104, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 92 bracelet and having her gloves buttoned for her by the kind little Frenchwoman, Lord Hartleigh turned to Paul and whispered to him that he had not had the courage to inform his mother of his marriage, but he had written a letter which he begged Paul would remit. As for himself, he proposed starting for the Continent with his bride, and remaining away a fortnight, coming back in time to appear in public with Lady Hartleigh at Stilborough Races. By then he hoped that his mother, having got over her first shock, would be prepared to take a sensible view of the affair, and to welcome his wife to Hazelwood. Though Paul inwardly quaked at the task confided to him, he pocketed the letter, promising to deliver it with his own hands ; and thereon the small bridal party started for the church, Paul leading the way with Helen on his arm, and Lord Hartleigh following with Mrs. Rushbrand, who was to ' give away ' the bride, and who, for the auspicious occasion, had made herself magnificent with her best puce silk gown, and a black velvet bonnet of ten years' standing. But the wedding was not fated to be a pri vate one, for what with the chirping of the maids among the tradespeople, and what with Lord Hartleigh's own appearance at the Surro gate's and the jeweller's, the rumour of what was going to happen had obtained pretty"], [105, "MARRIAGE BELLS. 93 general circulation. Deeply interested as our provincial middle classes are in all that concerns the Nobility of their counties, and especially in what concerns the lords of the manor on whose soil they are living, the report of Lord Hartleigh's marriage could not fail to excite considerable sensation. Incredulous burgesses emerged on to their doorsteps, then gathered in groups to compare notes, till at sight of the landau driving up to the church from the Vicar age they scampered towards the porch in a rush that caused the horses to plunge and the coach man to swear. Our friend Mr. Pottinger was one of the last to hear of what was brewing, being deep in his cellar preparing brown sugar for retail ; but when the news did reach him it drew him out of the house as though by the ears, and, to the eternal honour of his legs, be it recorded that he arrived at the church just in time to offer his services and to be accepted as groomsman. As he often repeated subsequently with much feeling: \u2014 'If I had been but two minutes later, why my lord would have been given away by his own valet.' But alack ! for those who, without being less inquisitive were less swift of foot than the grocer-churchwarden ! The marriage rite, im pressive as it is, and lasting as its effects are, is not a long one. In half an hour the eternal knot had been tied, the register in the vestry"], [106, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 94 had been signed, and Lord Hartleigh, with Helen on his arm, was walking down the nave, when he was momentarily impeded in his pro- gress by the gaping throngs that kept pouring in. Here it was that the good offices of Mr. Pottinger became valuable in clearing a passage by dint of elbow-ramming and vociferations. The wedded pair once in the porch, a murmur of admiration at the beauty of the bride ran round ; then somebody raised a cheer, which was but feebly responded to, because the ma jority present were at a loss what to make of what they saw ; but as Lady Hartleigh was being assisted into the carriage, someone sud- denly remarked that the customary satin-shoe, talisman of good luck, had been forgotten ; whereon, what must ingenious Mr. Pottinger do but whip off one of his own springside-boots and fling it with such dexterity that it struck full on the rumble of the departing vehicle, and scaled off two inches of the paint and varnish. This successful exploit, if it did not evoke the cheer it deserved, brought forth a gust of laughter, which was probably the last sound that reached the ears of the newly wedded pair as they were borne along at a flying pace towards the railway station. Mr. Pottinger picked up his boot and hobbled back into the church ; then it was all that Paul could do to shake him off, so great"], [107, "MARRIAGE BELLS. 95 was the itch upon him to know the why and wherefore, and all true particulars as to the astounding event that had happened. He was even disposed to consider it a grievance that Paul had not taken him into the secret before the event, and was only silenced at last by the Vicar's promising to come and have tea with him that evening and talk. For the present Paul had pressing business on hand ; not a moment was to be lost in seeing Lady Hartleigh, lest tidings of the marriage should reach her from some other source ; and so he turned his face towards Hazelwood. He walked fast and endeavoured to feel pleased with himself for what he had done, yet somehow the bank-note which he had received as his fee burned in his waistcoat pocket. England and America are the only two countries where a man may make up his mind about a marriage, get his licence, and have the ceremony performed \u2014 all within four-and-twenty hours, and without consulting anybody's good pleasure but his own. In other lands, not only are marriage formalities longer, but the law requires that the parents of bride and bridegroom (even though both the latter be seventy years old) shall at least be appealed to for their consent to the match ; and it does in truth seem so natural and fit that a man should not introduce a woman into a family as his wife without con-"], [108, "96 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. suiting the heads of that family, and that a woman should not give herself away to a man without seeking the advice of those who brought her into the world, that a marriage contracted without parental sanction seems to have some thing of incompleteness in it. Honestly examin ing his inner conscience Paul did not think he had acted otherwise than righteously in joining Lord Hartleigh and Helen to each other with all possible despatch ; and yet he experienced prickings of compassion for Lord Hartleigh's mother, and felt more uneasy at going to meet her upbraidings than could have been the case had he been persuaded of his own utter blame lessness. In such a frame of mind did he cover a mile of ground, and he was about to climb a stile in order to shorten his journey by crossing a field, when he heard a clatter of hoofs behind him, and his name hallooed in an excited voice. He turned and saw Sir Giles Taplow, who had spent the night at Royster Hall, and had just passed through Stilborough on his way back to Hazelwood. ' I say, what's this I hear, Rushbrand, that Hartleigh has married Nell Lees ?' cried the baronet, even before reining in. ' I have just married Lord Hartleigh to Miss Lees,' answered Paul coldly. 'Well, I'm d d if you haven't done a pretty morning's work,' laughed Sir Giles, as if"], [109, "MARRIAGE BELLS. 97 he would roll off his saddle at the joke. ' Why do you know that Nell is one of the most arrant little minxes who ever led a fool by the nose ? ' ' Lady Hartleigh was, before her marriage, a Miss Truman, daughter of a clergyman and a much valued friend of mine,' retorted Paul with warmth. ' Gad \u2014 I dare say she was a parson's daughter,' said Sir Giles ; ' but did she tell you when she had last seen her family \u2014 did she say anything about her past history ? ' ' She told me as much as I required to know,' replied Paul. ' Ah, but you would have wanted to know more had you been put on the scent of the truth. Just listen, Nell must be six-and-twenty now, though she doesn't look it, and she has been going about on the loose for the last ten years. She was about sixteen when she eloped from home to join a travelling circus in company with a kind of acrobat who had cozened her. Not liking the paper-hoop business, she became a barmaid at a music hall ; then she got engaged as a dancing actress at a country town theatre ; then she turned up as a nursery governess, but that was only a sham to hide her real connec tion with her employer, who was a widower, and whom she would have married if she VOL. I. H"], [110, "98 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. hadn't fallen in with Hartleigh, who was game better worth flying at.' ' You are mistaken in all you say, Sir Giles,' exclaimed Paul, on whose brow the flush of indignation had mounted. ' Miss Truman was unaware of Lord Hartleigh's rank until some time after she had first met him.' ' Ah, that's a good 'un !' grinned Sir Giles. ' Why it was I who brought the two together.' ' It was you who brought them together ? ' echoed Paul, who felt his knees shake. ' I and no one else, worse luck to me ! but, you see, I've known Nell, off and on, for the last sive years, and for old companionship's sake, as it were, I threw young Hartleigh into her way as I was travelling with him. But egad ! I thought it was going to be a simple chumship as usual ; if I could have guessed that it was coming to this style of thing, I'm hanged if I should have acted as I did. Why, why I'm not sure that Nell hasn't already a child out somewhere at nurse.' ' Not a word more, Sir Giles ; it is a waste of words,' exclaimed Paul, holding up his hand and speaking hoarsely, for he was well-nigh choking \u2014 ' you have such a flippant way of talking about women that where they are con cerned I cannot believe anything you say.' ' Well, as you please about that,' rejoined Sir Giles coolly. ' Everybody knew who Nell"], [111, "MARRIAGE BELLS. 99 was, except Hartleigh himself. Why even the family solicitor seems to have got an inkling of the affair, for he informed Lady Hartleigh of it. She spoke to me on the subject this day, asking me if there was any danger of a marriage, and, like a fool, I said there wasn't. I even laughed at the mere notion. You don't know whether Lady Hartleigh has yet heard of the precious business ?' ' I am going now to Hazelwood to carry Lady Hartleigh a letter from her son,' answered Paul, faintly, and turning away. ' Well, well,' said Sir Giles with a whistle, ' I wish you joy of your embassy \u2014 granting that you are fond of excitement.' And as he set his horse in motion, he laughed again at Paul, who was leaning against the stile much as if he had received a stunning blow. H 2"], [112, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 100 CHAPTER VII. BEFORE THE RACES. At the yearly approach of Stilborough Races, Royster Hall would be filled with joyous anima tion. It was a grand old mansion of red brick and white freestone, which had been built in the time of Elizabeth, but largely added to by sub sequent possessors, one of whom, who had been first enriched and then nigh ruined by the South Sea bubble, had run up an orangery and stables fit for the palace of a king. With its commons and dependencies the place straggled over nearly three acres ; but, big as it was, the patriarchal size of Sir Peter's family prevented it from ever being, or seeming, empty ; and at race time it was as thickly peopled as an hotel. Then, unsuspected rooms broke into light, and the Misses Carew could be seen flitting down long and broad passages followed by house keeper and maids bearing armfuls of clean sheets and pillow-cases ; then, in the kitchen was the big jack-spit kept revolving day and night to roast huge barons of beef and flocks"], [113, "BEFORE THE RACES. 101 of fowls for the entertainment of all such as chose to come and feast during three days ; then again, old Sir Peter might be met, girt with an apron and going with his waddling butler to wards the cellars, there to take annual stock of his wines and ales, and to tell off what dozens of red and yellow seals, what ' gold caps ' and fair-paunched barrels were to be had up for un corking and broaching. There was every reason why the denizens of Royster Hall should hail the races as a family festival ; for they derived not a little pecuniary profit from them. The race course ran through the Carew estate for a third of its length ; and for the remaining third through some land belonging to the Corporation of Stilborough, with whom Sir Peter had made this arrange ment, \u2014 that they should share with him the pro ceeds of the gate money levied on carriages and on pedestrians (6d. per head of latter), and leave him the sole benefit of the grand-stand admissions, and of the refreshment department, which he farmed out at the rate of 200/. for the three days. Altogether Sir Peter contrived to clear about 500/ from the meeting, after deducting the expenses to which he was put for hospitality and the prize of a hundred guineas which he gave in the shape of the ' Carew Cup.' This lump of money was most welcome to him. It was the only part of his income which he"], [114, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 102 could not forestall ; it enabled him to pay off small debts, and furnished him with the pocket money out of which he defrayed his club sub scriptions, his cigars, and the other minor luxuries to which himself and his children were addicted. In addition to this the races served to keep up his influence in the county. The guests, who, from far and near, swarmed under his roof, derived exaggerated notions of his wealth from the lordly style in which he received them, while the Stilborough tradesmen, who by invita tion fared gratis on his beef and wine, marked their gratitude by returning him to Parliament at each successive election. On the morning of the opening day of the particular meeting which concerns us, Oswrald and Philip Carew rose early to take a survey of the course. It was a lovely day, one of those when departing summer and early autumn seem to blend all their beauties. No rain had fallen for more than a week, and the scarlet pimpernel glittering in the hedge-rows told by its open petals that none was to be dreaded for that day. Oswald, the Guardsman, struck the ground with his foot and complacently said : ' Hard as granite, my boy. There's no chance of Bluebell being able to stay on such a course as this.' ' Let us hope not, but I own I'm getting nervous,' responded his brother. 'You see, I've followed your cue and laid such a pot of money"], [115, "BEFORE THE RACES. 103 against this brute, that if he comes in first I shall be about done for. I've half a mind to hedge.' ' You'll be a muff if you do.' ' But I shall lose about three thousand if he wins. ' Three ! that's nothing, I should be let in for about ten, and yet I hope to book a good many more bets about him. I look upon this as one of the chances that come to a man once in his life-time.' ' Yes, old fellow, but isn't this rather reck less plunging ? ' asked his brother, who looked frightened at the magnitude of the sum men tioned. ' Supposing I lost I might possibly pull through by selling my commission, but how on earth could you raise io,coo/. ? We are not worth it, the whole lot of us put together ! ' ' What's the use of bothering a man with that funkey talk ? ' replied Oswald testily. ' I tell you the public are wrong in their fancy for this horse, and I'm right in telling you that he won't win. Besides, the long and the short of it is, I must raise 5,000/., for the kind of life I've been leading won't do any longer. My table is littered half a foot thick with duns ; I dare hardly show myself about London in the daylight ; the other day, by Jove, I was actually in want of a five-pound note ! ' ' Egad ! it's just the same story with me,' chimed in Philio."], [116, "104 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. ' And there's something else,' proceeded the elder brother more confidentially. ' The girls have got into straits too. Maud and Alice had run up bills before marriage, and their husbands can't pay even by pawning their hats; as for Bella, Amy, and Georgina, they of course have started ticks too, for girls can't get all those silks, furs, and bracelets for nothing. If we come out all right from the Town Plate we shall be able to help them. How much do you stand to win ? ' ' About twelve hundred.' ' Well, lay on and close your book at two thousand. As I've told you, I shall book as heavily as I can and make a grand coup of it. If we net about eight thousand between us, we shall be able to pull the girls and ourselves well out of the rut.' 'And mend our manners for the future,' added Philip, the Hussar, not altogether un- seriously, though he appeared to jest. By this time the margins of the course had become studded with persons having business there in connection with the day's proceedings. The refreshment-contractor's men were taking possession of the grand-stand ; plate, glass, and hampers were being unpacked from carts; a couple of yellow gipsy vans were crawling to- wards spots most eligible for the erection of aunt-sallies, and, coming in Indian file across a stretch of heath, were to be descried several"], [117, "BEFORE THE RACES. 105 stable-boys, each leading a horse warmly muffled up, whilst the bluff trainer rode behind on a sturdy cob. These horses belonged to Lord Hartleigh's stud, and Oswald pointing with his stick to one of them, whom his quick eye had recognised for Bluebell despite the clothes, bade his brother observe a dropping action of the off hind leg, much like a limp. It struck Philip that he had often noticed the same peculiarity in regimental chargers, and that it did not in any wise hinder their fleetness or powers of en durance, being onh' a trick. This made him grave, but he did not urge the fact on his brother's attention, for Oswald pretended to infallibility in his judgment of horseflesh, and contradiction would only have angered him without altering the judgment he had formed. The brothers turned their steps homewards, and were soon met by their two married sisters and by A my, who had come out to call them in to breakfast, but who were also anxious to ob tain their opinions on a question much more important than any affecting the merits of Lord Hartleigh's stud \u2014 namely, how Lord Hart leigh's new wife should be greeted, or whether she should be greeted at all ? Delicate dilemma which was perplexing the consciences of almost all the feminine section of society in the county ! For the information which they had col-"], [118, "106 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. lected concerning Lady Hartleigh, ladies were mainly indebted to the glozings of Sir Giles Taplow ; but many of them refused to believe what this unmannerly gentleman said, and by their scepticism did his character more honour than it deserved, for, assuredly, the man who lets his tongue wag about any woman is a sorry fellow. However, there was sufficient mystery about the marriage to make right-minded ladies dubious as to what course they should adopt ; while the others (the no-minded ones) stoutly declared that they never could, and never would strike up acquaintance with a lady whose antecedents were not better known to them. Oswald and Philip Carew advised a neutral attitude so far as their sisters were concerned. Both had felt annoyed that the match they had contemplated for Isabel Carew had come to nothing, and both, moreover, knew a great deal more about her new ladyship than they cared to divulge ; but they were too much men of the world not to hate the idea of mingling in any ladies' quarrel, knowing that of all strifes such are the bitterest, most long-lived, and least profitable. This diplomatic apathy of theirs did not please all the fair visitors at Royster Hall, and pretty Lady Ambermere took Oswald to task point blank over the breakfast table : \u2014 ' Come, Captain Carew, if you were married"], [119, "BEFORE THE RACES. 107 should you like your wife to become intimate with Lady Hartleigh ? ' ' It would depend who my wife was.' ' Well, I am supposing that you would be very fond of her.' ' Then I should probably have sufficient confidence in her to let her choose her own friends.' ' But supposing she asked you for your ad vice ? ' ' I should be obliged to give it her.' ' And what would that advice be ? ' ' To do as she liked.' ' Oh, you are laughing at me,' said the young widow, turning away displeased, and she appealed to old Sir Peter. But the master of Royster Hall had no notion of falling out with the lord of Hazelwood, between whose family and his, ties of amity had existed for time out of mind ; so that, disgusted as he privately was, at the marriage, he had resolved that nothing of his sentiments should be suspected. He feigned to believe that all the outcry against Lady Hartleigh was owing to her father's being a curate, and he spoke warmly in the latter's praise : \u2014 'Mr. Truman is said to bean excellent man, I assure you.' ' Oh, we take no exceptions to Lady Hart leigh's parentage, but only to her conduct,' ex-"], [120, "108 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. claimed Lady Ambermere. ' Sir Giles says she has been a circus rider.' 'And a barmaid,' tittered in Mrs. Warrener. ' And that she went about under assumed names,' said Mrs. Hunt. ' What would that matter ? if the heart be sound it only makes the. match more romantic,' ejaculated Oswald. ' Give me another cup of tea, please, Maud, and pray that we may never, any of us, have our characters at the mercy of Giles Taplow.' ' Oh, but really, Captain Carew, you seem to make very light of the whole affair,' declared Lady Ambermere petulantly. ' I make light of Taplow, that's all, Lady Ambermere.' ' Why, but Sir Giles Taplow happens to be the only person in a position to enlighten us ! He was staying at Hazelwood all the time, and he says there was a lamentable scene when Mr. Rushbrand came to tell poor Lady Hartleigh of what had occurred : she refused to believe it at first, but when she had read her son's letter she flew out into a paroxysm of the wildest reproaches against the Vicar, and I must say I think he deserved them. Lady Hartleigh had warned him beforehand that she dreaded the marriage, and had tried to make an ally of him ; but instead of keeping the promise he had made of doing his utmost to thwart the match,"], [121, "BEFORE THE RACES. 109 what should this pious Mr. Rushbrand go and do but interest himself in Miss Truman, and, so far as we can learn, almost frighten Lord Hartleigh into marrying her ' 'Yes, I don't think Rushbrand acted like a gentleman in this business,' interposed Sir Peter, blurting out the words before he could weigh their purport. ' Ah ! there, you see, is an admission at last,' cried Lady Ambermere victoriously. ' Pardon me, you mistake my meaning,' stammered Sir Peter, who would have been glad to retract. ' What I meant was \u2014 \u2014 ' ' No, no, you've spoken your true mind,' in terrupted her ladyship, shaking her head and exulting. 'You've said that Mr. Rushbrand behaved badly in solemnising the marriage ; therefore, according to you, the match was a mistake ; and, therefore, again Miss Truman was no fit person to be Lord Hartleigh's wife. It's as clear as sunlight' Lest her triumphant logic should be attacked, the rich young widow rose laughing from the table and sailed out with the other ladies, who were going to prepare for the invasion of guests by putting on their war-paint ; but, in the main, the question in debate had remained undecided, for the ladies had agreed on no combined plan of action towards Helen. Later in the day, however, when she was fully equipped for"], [122, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 110 shining on the grand-stand, Lady Ambermere came down to one of the morning rooms and found Oswald poring intently and with knitted brow over his betting-book. So deep was he in the study of his figures that he heard neither the opening of the door, nor the rustling of the intruder's dress as she glided across the floor. ' Ah, that's what makes you so tolerant of improprieties,' she said, touching the edge of his book with her parasol and causing him to start. ' You bet, get into debt, lose your inde pendence, and then do not feel courage enough to quarrel with a man of Lord Hartleigh's power. The Guardsman had risen ; he put his bet ting-book in the breast-coat pocket of his coat, and said calmly, ' You are quite right, Lady Am bermere ; I was just making the same reflection.' She would have given a great deal to recall o o her words : \u2014 he looked so frank and handsome, so little like a man devoid of moral daring. ' Of course I was only joking,' she said. '/ was serious though. A man can afford to moralise when he has brought himself to such a pass that all his prospects depend on the legs of a horse, as mine do now.' ' Oh, don't say that !

' she asked, changing colour visibly. ' Never more so. I was watching my man varnish my boots this morning, and wondered if I could ever do anything in the same way if matters came to the worst.' ' Oh, but you are talking as if you had no friends in the world \u2014 which is absurd ! ' ex claimed Lady Ambermere, rallying at the thought. ' Why, Captain Carew, I am sure there are plenty of people who would almost be glad to see you get into some trouble in order that they might have the pleasure of helping you out of it' She spoke with a touch of genuine emotion, and now was Oswald's chance if he had cared to take it.

A faint tinge of pink rose to the gambler's cheeks, and for a moment words hovered over his lips unpro nounced; but mastering himself, he put the"], [124, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 112 temptation to flight, and turned the situation into a joke : \u2014 ' I have been making fun of you, Lady Am bermere,' he said playfully.

The grand stand offered a goodly spectacle at the moment when the bell was about to ring to clear the course for the great race of the day. The two first minor races had been disposed of, and during the preliminary hour spectators had been flocking on to the ground, not in hundreds, but in thousands, so cloudless was the sky, so balmy the breeze that blew from those distant wooded hills that encircled this part of the country like an amphitheatre. Vehicles of all descriptions were massed on the off side of the course, from the beautifully appointed claret and red drag of the Light Dragoon officers of the nearest garrison town, down to the lumbering holiday vans full of small tradesmen and their families, and the weather-beaten market gigs of the farmers, who turned out to a man to enjoy this their annual holiday. Nor was the spacious stable-yard of Royster Hall empty of showy equipages, whose occupants had been lunching with Sir Peter, and making festive havoc among VOL. T. I"], [126, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 114 the bottles of choice wines whereon he so justly prided himself. Now, indeed, was the time to see old Sir Peter in his glory. Dressed in a new frock-coat, a white waistcoat, a blue spotted neckerchief, and a white hat thrown back off his forehead, he stood on the turf of the enclosure with the Duke of Grandton, Lord- Lieutenant, and a host of other county notables around him ; every moment his hand was stretched out to receive the grasp of some new comer, and he seemed to have grown younger by ten years since the morning, thanks to the bloom which the greetings of a hundred friends had imparted to his hale features. Equally spirited was the scene in the state-box above, where the host's five beauteous daughters were doing the honours of the scarlet-draped tiers of seats to the Duchess and numerous other ladies \u2014 a galaxy of bright, high-bred Englishwomen, fair to look at, pleasant to know, sweet to have as friends, and, doubtless, not a little terrible to affront and to be frowned on by. So at least poor Helen Hartleigh seemed to think, peering ruefully at the stand through a field glass from the depth of her husband's barouche two hundred yards off. Lord Hartleigh had driven on to the course in great state with four greys, two postilions, and a couple of cockaded footmen on the hind seat ; and it had been his"], [127, "'BLUEBELL! 115 wish to alight and at once lead his wife to the stand and introduce her to his friends. But Helen had begged that the ordeal, which she had so much private reason to dread, might be postponed till after the race, so that Bluebell's owner was fain to witness the performance of his horse from the carriage, presenting his wife in the meanwhile to divers gay young bachelors, officers, and others, who thronged round the barouche, and whose cinprcsscmcnt made the total absence of ladies in that quarter the more conspicuous. The bell was set ringing to clear the course, the numbers of the stations were hoisted, and at this moment the view from the stand was as of a surging ocean of black and white hats, chequered by the many-coloured coats of the bookmakers, who were perched on chairs outside the enclosure, bawling the odds. Over this seething tide of humanity floated a perfume of cigar smoke and vesuvian lights. Two men in the enclosure now felt their hearts tighten as the moment advanced that was going to settle their fate \u2014 Oswald Carew and Philip. The former, in a nattily-fitting grey frock coat, with a rose-bud in his button-hole, white gaiters over his spruce, varnished boots, and with a smile on his lips, was, to all outward appearance, coolness itself. Nothing about him I 2"], [128, "116 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. was flurried or ruffled : even the hue of his com plexion was not deepened by a shade ; but, with horrible distress, Philip watched him going from group to group, and every halt was followed by the drawing out of the blue velvet betting-book and the scribbling of an entry with his gold pencil case. At ordinary times Philip was not more prudent than his elder brother \u2014 much less so. Three years younger than Oswald, lighter of build, more impetuous of mood, he had the additional drawback of belonging to a regiment far ' louder ' in its tone than any in the Household Brigade, one whose officers, mostly sons of plutocrats, gloried in outlandish doings. There were few acts of bold extrava gance or folly from which Philip would have recoiled on his own behalf, but he rather looked up to Oswald, the future head of the house, and anxiety on the latter's account now destroyed his nerve. Since morning he had seemed to see opening up before him a yawning chasm in which the honour and happiness, not only of Oswald, but of all the Carews, was going to be engulfed. The reflection had robbed him of appetite, and rendered him so little like his usual self that more than one military friend asked him if he had turned Methodist or taken the mumps. At last he could bear his dismal thinkings no longer, and resolved that, at the risk of Oswald's serious displeasure (should the"], [129, "'BLUEBELL! 117 latter win), he would go and ' hedge ' in such wise that, if his brother lost, he himself might be in a position to assist him, instead of ag gravating the family embarrassments. He had no time to lose and approached the Count de Longchamps, a famous French owner of race horses, who had come with the Duke's party, and was extremely remarkable for the tightness of the clothes that encased his pudgey person \u2014 tight gloves, boots, shirt-collar ; all about him was tight, even to the greyish moustache, whose tips were so tightly waxed that they seemed to prevent him from ever shutting his mouth. ' Have you closed your book, Count ? ' asked Philip, accosting him. ' To tell you de trut', Mr. Carew, I have not made von single bet on dis meeting,' an swered the Frenchman : ' I have been looking at de horses in de paddock, and do not dink mosh of dem.' ' Will you give me the odds against the Town Plate favourite \u2014 Bluebell ? ' ' O yes, vit' pleasure. Two to von. Vat in ? \u2014 hundreds ? ' ' Thousands if it suits you,' replied Philip quickly. ' Tousands den,' said the Count, evidently surprised, and probably not much relishing so large a bet on such a small event ; but, having"], [130, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 118 let out that his book was clear, he could not plead the necessity of moderating his wagers. The Duke of Grandton's betting days were long past, but, catching the word ' thousands,' a whiff of the times when he himself was a great stud owner and ' plunger ' returned to him. He looked round, but seeing only a younger son, hesitated. Philip, however, had caught his eye : ' I'm hedging, your Grace. Will you take the field against the favourite ? ' ' H'm ! it's like betting with one of my own boys,' demurred the Duke. ' I held you on my knees when you were a baby.' ' We've both grown since then,' laughed Philip. ' Well, well, just to give myself a zest in the event,' smiled the Duke. ' I think you said thousands ; ' and he booked as securely as if he were treating with one of his own ermine, so unspotted was the reputation of the Carews with respect to punctual settlements. Philip next wended his way through the crowd and sought a professional bookmaker, not one of those in coloured garments, but a man of repute, who did his business with as much system and honesty as a registered stock broker. The police had not yet, in those times, commenced their raids against betting houses, and this man owned an agency in London,"], [131, "' BLUEBELL! 119 which employed a dozen clerks, and occupied premises like a bank. It forms the basis of the bookmaker's method always to lay against the favourite, so that he made no difficulty about betting with Philip, only he objected to giving the odds of 2 to 1, and, to explain his reluctance, jerked his thumb towards the horses who were just then filing out of the paddock. A showy troop they made with their sky-blue, scarlet, and yellow jockeys ; but, to the experienced eye, they constituted, with the exception of Bluebell, a ' screwy ' lot, and if it had not been for the jerky action of the favourite's hind leg, the race would have seemed a foregone conclu sion. Philip desperately offered to take 3 to 2 in thousands, and this brought the bookmaker down. After all, racing is a game of hazards ; there were six starters, consequently five chances to one in his favour. For form's sake he tried to hold out for a bet at ' evens,' but, on refusal, closed with Philip's offer. He too felt as sure of a Carew as though the money staked had been guaranteed by mortgage. Philip now stood in this position, that if Bluebell came first to the post, he should lose 3,000/., but win 7,000/. \u2014 clear gain, 4,000/, ; if the horse was beaten, he should win 1,200/., and lose 4,000/. \u2014 clear losings, 2,800/. ; but, in this latter contingency, Oswald would be win ning five or six thousand, and would of course."], [132, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 120 assist him. Philip's mind was relieved of the load which had oppressed it so long as his fate was bound up with his brother's ; and yet he could not think without inward tremor, of what Oswald's anger would be if he won, and learned that Philip had laid against him. Philip had, with the best intention, been playing false to the great principle of ' standing or falling to gether,' which is a gambler's maxim as well as a family maxim ; and he would further be re proached with having set at naught Oswald's unerring judgment in racing matters \u2014 all of which could not but impair for a time the excel lent understanding that had hitherto existed be tween the brothers. With these thoughts \u2014 no very agreeable ones \u2014 revolving under his hat, the usually joyous hussar took his stand near the railings, and watched the field canter to wards the starting post. He was joined by Sir Giles Taplow, who was full of beery gossip, and told him amongst other things that there would be some fun by-and-by if Lord Hartleigh tried to present his wife to the county ladies, for that the Duchess of Grandton's fiat had gone forth that such a person could not be received, and the ladies intended to desert the stewards' box in a body if Lady Hartleigh entered it Sir Giles was amazed that Philip showed little interest in this big news, but puffed with moody taciturnity at a cigar he had lit. The course"], [133, "'BLUEBELL! 121 was now quite clear. Even the inevitable dog had been hooted into close quarters, and one of summer's last sulphur-hued butterflies was flit ting over the ground which the horses' hoofs were presently to trample. In the distance the jackets and caps of the jockeys gleamed like signal flags of a row. ' They're off ! ' was the cry, and the line of colours, breaking up of a sudden, resolved itself into fragments that looked like so many bright fishing-floats bobbing up and down on water. At first only the heads and bodies of the riders were visible ; then a mound concealed them all from view ; when they emerged into light again a blue jockey was seen to be leading, then came a red, a violet, while the white jacket with brown sleeves and cap of the Hazelwood stable toiled far in the ruck. ' Wild Kate wins ! ' shouted some eager voices ; but it was only an instant's cry, for at the point where the furthest carriage stood Bluebell's jockey pulled his horse deftly together, drew him out of the ruck, and began to ply whip and spur. Half a dozen strides brought him on a level with the leader ; in half a dozen more he had cleared his length, and then his race was over, for at every step he increased the gap, and galloped past the post \u2014 an easy winner by about a hundred yards. The affair was quite a hollow one, proving to the general satisfaction that the public's fancy in the"], [134, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 122 favourite had not been misplaced \u2014 a result which would be more frequently chronicled on the turf if racing were always the fair-play thing which it had been in this case. As Bluebell's name passed from mouth to mouth, it was natural that some mention should be made of the owner ; and from the grand stand many a glass was now directed towards Lord Hartleigh's carriage. Pleased as a school boy at seeing his colours triumph, the young peer assisted his wife to alight and gave her his arm, acknowledging, as he walked her towards the course, the many bows and cheers that be gan to greet him. Helen's cheeks flushed with pleasure at these tokens of respect and good will, but both she and her husband took them for a great deal more than they really meant. English country-people \u2014 farmers or townsmen \u2014 are always ready to pay their court to a rich nobleman in his own county ; and turfmen are swift to appreciate a stud-owning lord whose horses may be trusted to run ' straight ; ' but none of those cheers which Helen accepted as being in part a homage to herself had any reference to Lord Hartleigh's marriage, of which most of those who noisily waved their hats were ignorant : they were simply addressed to the owner of Bluebell. As Lord Hart leigh passed into the stand enclosure, the differ ence in the welcome which he received was very"], [135, "'BLUEBELL! 123 perceptible. The gentlemen to whom he intro duced Helen showed the utmost politeness, but were reserved, as if not daring to commit them selves under the eyes of their wives and sisters ; meantime all the ladies in the box studiously averted their eyes from Lord and Lady Hart leigh, to avoid being obliged to acknowledge any look or nod of recognition that might be sped towards them. All this Helen (recovering from her first illusions), with a woman's intuition, understood at a glance. She saw that her antecedents must have become matters of notoriety (though how this had happened, not suspecting the treachery of her old friend Sir Giles, she could not guess) : and she saw that her path, which she had fondly hoped might be strewn with roses thenceforth, was about to be made prickly with thorns. What she suffered in that instant of anguish may be better imagined than de scribed. As for Lord Hartleigh, who knew nothing of his wife's past life, he walked bravely on, prepared, indeed, for a little coldness in the first reception of Helen, but not dreaming that his mesalliance would be imputed to him for such a crime that ladies would decline to admit Helen among them at all. Still, a feeling of uneasiness did creep over him when, after hav ing repeatedly cast glances towards friends in the ladies' box, he found it impossible to catch"], [136, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 124 the eye os a single one among them. Could it be that his high rank, which had hitherto proved a talisman to make all men's heads bow, and all women's lips smile upon him, was about to fail him at the moment when he had serious need of its magic ? He was spared from incurring the most crushing practical reply to this ques tion by the charitable and timely interposition of Sir Peter Carew, who checked him as he was about to ascend the staircase. The old baronet had been informed of the plot which had been machinated against Lady Hartleigh, and his kindly heart filled with com passion for the childlike young thing whom he saw hanging on her husband's arm. He re flected with shrewdness that if a public affront were put upon Lord Hartleigh's wife, the memory of it would be undying and close the way to any future reconciliation with, or re ception of, her ; whereas that if she abstained for the present from trying to gain admittance into society, the prejudices against her would gradu ally melt, and time would open for her one door after another. As he had a great wish to keep any of his own daughters from seeming to act in hostility to Lady Hartleigh, Sir Peter decided that her husband must be prevented at all hazards from going up to the ladies' box, and he cast his eyes about for one of his sons who might help him in the plan he had formed. He"], [137, "'BLUEBELL! 125 perceived Philip, who was roving about in quest of Oswald, and beckoned to him. 'Just come with me,' he said hurriedly, ' and whilst I speak to Lord Hartleigh, give your arm to his wife.

Philip complied without much alacrity, and along with his father was intro duced to Helen by Lord Hartleigh. Then Sir Peter laid a hand on the peer's shoulder, and whispered that he had something of importance to say to him which admitted of no delay, whereon Lord Hartleigh having surrendered Helen to the Hussar, suffered himself to be drawn aside, and was told with as much cir cumlocution as possible what the state of mat ters was. ' But don't take it to heart, my dear boy,' added Sir Peter paternally ; ' it's only a question of a few days' waiting. There have been silly rumours and what not, and you must give them time to subside.' ' Rumours about my wife ? ' echoed Lord Hartleigh, who had turned ashy pale. 'Why, who has dared ?

' ' My daughters, God forbid ! ' stammered Sir Peter, in growing distress ; ' but I do pray you as a sensible fellow let me manage this for you. I'll talk the girls over, and in a few days you shall come to Royster and be both made welcome, I promise you.' ' Spare yourself that trouble, please ; for my wife shall be received nowhere as a favour,' ejaculated Lord Hartleigh, with all the haughti ness that can swell the bosom of a young man wounded to the quick.

But there is a curious pertinacity in Englishmen of Mr. Pottinger's sort, which makes them keep doggedly on to any course they have marked, despite of obstacles. A Frenchman would have given in under the ridicule, a German would not have thought the end worth the trouble. Mr. Pottinger set himself industriously to collect statistics as to all the evils attributable to the Stilborough races. He had bought a folio ledger, and in it all the offences and accidents arising out of the races were minutely chronicled \u2014 cases of assault and battery, drunkenness, till-robbing by shopboys who had betted, card sharping, thimble-rigging, and welching on the course, ruin to girls who had been enticed astray by some of the amorous characters from London, who infested the town during the ' three days,' cases of debt, night rioting, profligacy, &c. One year he had been so lucky as to write down a ruffian who had killed another about a disputed bet, and been hanged for it, and with pardonable exultation he had been dangling this criminal before the noses of his colleagues ever since. It puzzled many to guess what could make Mr. Pottinger so bitter about the races ; but there was no need to allege, as some did, that he had applied for the refreshment contract on vol. 1. K"], [142, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 130 the course and had it refused him, whence a lasting grudge against Sir Peter. The grocer churchwarden was not one of those men who require the stimulus of personal rancour to excite them against institutions which others uphold. He really did think horse-racing sinful \u2014 probably the invention of some Pope \u2014 and in the next place it gratified his im portance to be pointed at as the man who, on conscientious grounds, was denouncing a pas time which the high and mighty of this earth patronised. It is a great thing to have a good hobby, and to know how to ride it. The man who should set his heart on abolishing the Duke of York's column would be a more in teresting person than those who are content to let that sightly monument be. So Mr. Pottinger had agitated in his small way, having on his side a few old ladies, two or three teetotallers, and some dissenters, but he had never flattered himself that he should be able to make much progress with so small an army. Paul Rushbrand's appointment to the Vicarage fired him with a new hope that he might enlist a clergyman of the Established Church in his cause, and he had taken many an opportunity of filling the new Vicar's mind with dark pictures of the licentiousness and intem perance that reigned in Stilborough during the yearly meeting. When, however, Mr. Pottinger"], [143, "MR. POTTINGER'S HOBBY. 131 learned that a snub had been put upon Lady Hartleigh at the races, and simultaneously got wind of the fact that Captain Carew had lost 30,000/. in one afternoon, he piously thanked heaven for having sent two more trumps into his hands. How the facts just mentioned had come into the grocer's possession there is no saying ; but cats have ever shown a curious facility for getting out of bags and flying at the ears of the wrong people. What is more, they grow vastly as they run. The version current in Stil borough, and credited by many who had higher sources of information than the grocer, was that Lord Hartleigh had been peremptorily ordered by Sir Peter Carew to take his wife out of the grand stand, under threat of seeing the county families withdraw immediately if he did not. As to Oswald Carew's losings it was inevitable that they should be magnified by every succes sive person who talked about them. At all this Mr. Pottinger sincerely rejoiced, not because of the evil that had been wrought, but because out of evil would come good, Lord Hartleigh could not fail to withhold all countenance thenceforth from races where his wife had been insulted ; and Paul Rushbrand, irritated as he would be by this result, scandal ised also at Captain Carew's immense losses (which it was being bruited would never be K 2"], [144, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 132 settled), and being, furthermore, an eye-witness of the disorderly scenes of which the races were productive in the streets, would give the autho rity of his name and office to any plan of attack which Mr. Pottinger might devise against his bugbear ; so that the latter, instead of annually leading a forlorn hope, might actually find him self heading important forces in a regular pitched battle, which, if it were not victorious, would, at all events, greatly exalt his local status, and add to his reputation for righteous ness and energy. 'Well, Mr. Rushbrand,' said he, calling at the Vicarage on the morning after the third day's racing. ' I suppose you've heard of the fine news that's running all over the town ? ' \u2014 and he unfolded his budget without waiting sor leave or taking breath. ' Are you sure all that is true ? ' asked Paul, frowning. ' Oh, there's not a doubt about it. Quite a thousand people saw Sir Peter go up to Lord Hartleigh, and then my lo'd and my lady leave the enclosure together looking black as thunder.' ' And who told you about Captain Carew's losings ? ' ' Everybody, it's public talk. He bet right head over heels he did, and what makes it worse is that the family can't afford to pay such a big sum as he's lost. Father and children,"], [145, "MR. POTTINGER'S HOBBY. 133 sons and daughters, they owe money to right and left, the whole lot of 'em, and there must be a smash one of these days. Oh, Mr. Rush brand, these 'ere hoss-races are the abomination that maketh desolate ! Did you hear all that boozing and hollaring at the Red Lion last night ? ' ' I heard a great noise, certainly,' said Paul. ' Ah well, it's nothing to the row there was at the Blue Ram, and at some of them other low houses down the town. There they were at it till past midnight, and when they got away from their drinking they fell to quarrelling in the street like dawgs. Only to think that our mayor and council should give the publicans a couple of hours' extension every year at race time \u2014 extension of drunkenness I call it ! ' Paul nodded. There could be no doubt on that point. ' And then look at the class of fellars that we get down here \u2014 disgraces to humanity every man of them. There's gipsys, cadgers, black legs, thieves, imps of stable-boys vicious as sin, women that even Rahab would have been ashamed of, and from the hour when this bad lot of vagabonds and jades comes amongst us, till the moment of their going away, it's nothing but drink and swear, swear and drink, till the very air gets hot with their foul language. Come, Mr. Rushbrand, don't you think a man"], [146, "134 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. would be doing a christian work who laboured with the Lawd's help, to put down these 'ere races ? ' ' I am afraid it would be labour lost,' said Paul ; ' it is hopeless to expect that Sir Peter Carew would ever consent to the abolition.' ' Aye, but supposin' the corporation abol ished them without him \u2014 in spite of him ? ' ' How could that be done ? The races are held in Sir Peter's own park.' 'Ah, that's the very point, sir. \u2014 Just listen to this : a good part of the race-course runs through Sir Peter's grounds, but another part goes through Corporation land. Well, some time ago a party from London came down and made the Corporation a handsome offer for that piece of land to set up some dyeing works on. \" Stubb's Piece,\" as they call it, runs by the side of the Still, which Sir Peter's grounds don't, and they say the Still is very good for dye works. If I could have had my way we should have treated with the party, for the interest on the sum he proposed would have fetched us far more than the ground is worth to us now ; how ever, it turned out that I was the only one of my opinion, all the rest in the council being partial to the races, and afraid of offending Sir Peter and my lord, who hung very close to gether then. But times alter, you see, and sup posing we got the Corporation to vote the sale"], [147, "MR. POTTINGER'S HOBBY. 135 of \" Stubb's Piece,\" it would make an end of the races, for Sir Peter couldn't contrive another course out of his own grounds ; they ain't big enough.' ' Well, but do you see any chance of getting the corporation to reconsider their decision ? ' asked Paul, rather interested. ' Not if I have to battle with the Philistines alone, Mr. Rushbrand,' answered the grocer im pressively ; ' but if you, the spiritual pastor of our fold, put forth your might on my side, we might, now that Lord Hartleigh will be pri vately with us, I suspect, get the better of them in the end. I don't say we should prevail this year or the next : no sir, nor perhaps in ten years' time ; but if it was given me during my lifetime to put away this sin and reproach from our town, I should die content, saying, \" Eureka ! \" like Luther when he floored the Jesuit with the first printed copy of the Bible.' Paul made no promise, for the lesson he had received after Lord Hartleigh's marriage had put him on his guard for ever, as he then fan cied, against taking rash action. Since the very painful interview which he had had with Lord Hartleigh's mother, he had been in great de jection, not daring to believe that he had com mitted such an utter and lamentable error as was imputed to him, and yet feeling that many circumstances pointed to the truth of what he"], [148, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 136 had heard from Sir Giles Taplow about Helen's past life. Amongst others there was this fact that the letters which he had written to Mr. Truman, to acquaint him with his daughter's marriage, had been returned by the post-office, with the notification that this clergyman was still in China, his address unknown ; and thus at least one falsehood was proved against Helen, for she had assured him that her father was returned from China, and that she had been on a visit to him within six months before her elopement with Lord Hartleigh. It was with something like agony of spirits that the Vicar prayed to God morning and night, ay, and silently at other times of the day, that it would please Him to turn Helen's heart, so that she might conduct herself rightly in her new station, and never give her husband cause to repent having married her. Paul had even deliberated as to calling on Helen at Hazelwood, to tell her of his anxieties on her account, and what Mr. Pottinger told him of the episode on the race course made him think that this would be a moment especially fit for the visit. But under all circumstances a call was first due from Lord Hartleigh before the Vicar could with propriety go to Hazelwood ; and Paul awaited this call with uneasy impatience, half wondering that the wedded pair should not already have come to see him since their return."], [149, "MR. POTTINGER'S HOBBY. 137 In effect Lord Hartleigh called with his bride scarcely half-an-hour after the grocer had left, and apologised for not having done so before on the score of Helen's having been in disposed. Nothing much came of this visit of etiquette. Lord Hartleigh was polite as ever, but ill at ease ; Helen was overdressed and excited. She affected to treat Paul as a very old intimate friend, and gave herself a counte nance by a great deal of random talk about her recent wedding-trip, and by forced laughing at the peculiar manners of the French. No allusion was made to the races, nor to anything in con nection with local matters ; but as the pair were rising to go, Lord Hartleigh referred to his mar riage by saying he had brought Paul a little souvenir from Paris, and also one for Mr. Pot tinger, who had so courteously acted as his best man, and on whom he was now about to leave a card. Paul's present, which had been lifted out of the carriage, turned out to be a hundred guinea dressing-case, with silver mountings, so richly chased that they became thenceforth the exclusive care of Mrs. Rushbrand, who declared that she would trust to no servant the task of polishing them once a week. Paul would have dispensed with this gift, which was to remind him constantly of the noble donor, and to refresh day by day his ap prehension of the cruel scene that must take"], [150, "138 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. place between them if Lord Hartleigh ever came to discover what was now hidden from him. Over and over again had Paul mentally re hearsed this scene, wondering what he should say, and trying to prepare words, not so much to justify himself as to pacify his upbraider. But the terror of this possible crisis was so great that he felt that for months \u2014 perhaps for years \u2014 he must wince at hearing Lord Hart leigh's name uttered, and shrink from meeting him. Turning all this over, Paul asked himself whether his purpose would not be answered if he wrote to Helen instead of calling on her, for it was obvious that he could say much more by letter than by word of mouth, and perhaps his writing might be of more lasting effect He sat down as soon as this thought offered itself to him \u2014 on the day of Helen's visit \u2014 and poured on paper one of the most touching effu sions that ever left human pen. It far exceeded the limits of a letter, for it contained a recital of the writer's own life, with the intention of showing her who read it how much support he \u2014 Paul \u2014 had derived from reliance on Christ, and, again, how invariably he had seen the lot of transgressors to be hard, that of well-doers happy and blessed.

She had, indeed, something else to do than sit and be preached to : she had to be avenged of her enemies, to battle, finesse and conquer the position which society was disputing her \u2014 all of which were tasks congenial to her active nature. She was not one of those doe-like women who, when pierced by a dart, lie down feebly and bleed to death ; her blood and nerves were like a little cat's : she would bound and rebound, in a struggle, and, even at her last breath, would have made use of her claws. Though hurt and incensed at the ostracism decreed against her, she was not daunted by it, for she lulled herself to the belief that it could not last long. Possessed of as much worldly wisdom as two old men, she was aware that her husband's rank and his great fortune would be nine points to her advantage whenever she should seek to conciliate this or that family ; and that, as to the tenth point, the very mon strousness of her antecedents made it improb-"], [153, "THE MISTRESS OF HAZELWOOD. 141 able that anyone could credit them. Sir Giles Taplow was alone in a position to speak cir cumstantially about her past history, and he had no cause of enmity against her to induce him so to do ; but even if he did, his word would not count for much. It did not suit the world to believe much against her, and that is where her strength lay ; now one person, now another, would have need of Lord Hartleigh's influence, his money, his good word in high places, and these persons would not neglect to propitiate her. It was not as though the country ladies would be banded together all the year round, universally encouraging and supporting one another in hostility, as they had done at the races. This was but a chance league ; at ordi nary seasons it would be possible to lay siege to each of them separately, and nothing but time would be needed to make them all capitu late \u2014 to the last one. So reasoned Helen, but while looking forward with tolerable equanimity to the future, she cherished the most intense and vindictive hatred towards the Carews, whom she regarded as the authors of her humiliation. Nothing would persuade her that Sir Peter's daughters were not the ringleaders of what she termed ' the cabal,' and that their male relatives had not lent themselves to the same with unmanly subserviency. Far from feeling any gratitude"], [154, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 142 to Sir Peter for having warned her husband of what was plotting, she was pleased to consider his proceeding an insult, and, forgetting how her own heart had sunk at the prospect of encountering the cold faces she had seen in the stand-box, she was irritated with Lord Hartleigh for not having shown more spirit \u2014 for not having braved the warning and marched straight in among the assembled ladies, for she was certain (she said) that had this been done not one would have dared to frown on her. On learning of Oswald's heavy losses, and of the embarrassments that seemed likely to beset the family, her joy knew no bounds, and she in veighed with such spiteful persistency against the ' beggarly, dishonest lot of debtors,' that her husband, who had previously been very fond of all the Carews, first grew impatient with her, then exasperated against them for having given rise to such ill-feeling. He thought it prudent, however, to caution his wife against the language in which she expressed her antipathies, lest she should some day betray herself in the presence of strangers ; but this did not restrain Helen, and a milliner having come down from London to take her orders about some new dresses, she let slip such damaging reflections on the family at Royster Hall that the milliner grew frightened. The Carews had long been her customers, and were deep in her books ; on her return to"], [155, "THE MISTRESS OF HAZELWOOD. 143 London she went and spread alarming reports of their insolvency amongst her fellow trades people. Lord Hartleigh was very anxious for a reconciliation with his mother, and wished Helen to go with him and ask for her pardon, feeling persuaded it would not be withheld. Helen thought differently, and was in no haste to make her obeisance to a person between whom and her nothing like cordiality could ever spring up. Besides, a reconciliation might have led to the Dowager's return to Hazelwood, and Helen was resolved to defer this until her own sway under her husband's roof was secure. She began to establish her authority, not by timid ventures, but by bold high-handedness. An old housekeeper, who had been thirty years in the family, received a year's wages and notice to quit before evening, because she had seemed to look a little askance at her new mistress ; almost all the female staff were turned out after her, and if no changes were made among the male domestics, it was because Helen had the art of ingratiating herself with the stronger sex, and knew that cheerful service would never be grudged her by footmen and grooms. Armed with the late housekeeper's keys, and having all the account books in her custody, she in spected kitchens, stables, and store-rooms, made herself popular with the servants by"], [156, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 144 indulgences in the matter of fare and table beer ; but ruthlessly overturned all rules and customs, simply for the sake of innovating. It was enough that anyone should say, ' It used to be so in the time of my lord's mother,' for Helen immediately to alter the thing in question, so that in a few days the servants had all been trained to feel that in future it was she, and she alone, who would give them their orders. Having modified the whole interior eco nomy of the household, Helen next proceeded to a general exploration of rooms, cupboards, drawers, cabinets, and bureaus, to the end that nothing appertaining to her husband and his family concerns might remain concealed from her. The Hartleigh jewels \u2014 a valuable col lection \u2014 had been transmitted to her by the Dowager through the family solicitor, and great was the delight which they had given her ; but even keener than the satisfaction of decking herself before the glass in pearl necklaces and diamond tiaras, was the pleasure which Helen felt in rummaging strong-boxes and other re ceptacles for dusty old parchments and family letters, the ink of which had long grown yellow. Without being over romantic, the new mistress of Hazelwood was sufficiently well-read \u2014 espe cially in novels \u2014 to appreciate the honour of entering into an historic family, and it was in"], [157, "THE MISTRESS OF HAZELWOOD. 145 poring over the ancestral papers that this honour was most directly brought home to her \u2014 there being no safer pledge of mastery in a house hold, than the right to pry into its secrets. Lord Hartleigh was indifferent as to what his wife did with papers which he never looked at himself ; but Helen was frequently bantered for her inquisitive researches by Sir Giles Tap low, who was an assiduous visitor at Hazel wood. A curious personage, this Sir Giles, whom everybody knew and received, and whom no one esteemed, without, yet, feeling that they had the right to despise him. He was the most inveterate tale-bearer and mischief-maker abroad, for whatever he heard he repeated, however grave might be the consequences risked by his indiscretion. He would rather have lost a dinner than missed saying an ill- natured thing ; and, though he cared more sor his horses and dogs than for any human being, he would have lamed his best hack to carry the first tidings of an untoward event to those whom it was most likely to afflict. Generally the fancy for sporting animals develops, if not refined sentiments, yet a certain rough manli- ness of character ; but it had not done so in Sir Giles, whose taste in horses and dogs was rather an affair of vanity than of real inclination, for he never hunted and was a poor shot Even at VOL. I. L"], [158, "146 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. Eton and Oxford he had been known sor his avoidance of sports, and his addiction to hotel bars and low resorts, where he could drink ' half-and-half,' smoke his inseparable meer schaum, and watch, for amusement, a few ter riers bait a badger or kill rats. Now that he enjoyed an income of 25,000/. a year, his pas times had scarcely varied, whilst his morals had deteriorated, rather than improved. He had no heart and no principles. A niggard with his money, when he was not spending it on him self, untidy in his dress, cynical in speech, and personally unpleasant to look at because of his blear eyes, he seemed to be only tolerated be cause he was too well-off to be in need of anybody, and because his tattling made him companionable. Singular to relate, this invete rate propensity to let his tongue wag had never brought Sir Giles into trouble ; but this was because he always described himself as a mere echo of rumours flying everywhere about. Thus it had been when he had gone gossiping all he knew about Helen. Thus it was when he told Helen herself all about the misadven tures of the Carews. As he was not a lion in courage, it would have been easy to startle him into a total disclaimer of his individual belief in the malicious things he uttered, but no one thought it worth while thus to force the dagger to his throat People were content to take him"], [159, "THE MISTRESS OF HAZELWOOD. 147 for an eccentric chatterbox ' who meant no harm ' \u2014 and in truth he meant nothing in parti cular. He was simply hurtful by nature, like nettles, which sting without intention. 'Where's Hartleigh?' said he, walking one morning unceremoniously into Helen's presence through a window looking on to the flower garden, which he had crossed, instead of enter ing the Hall through the visitors' door. ' He has just gone out with his gun,' said Helen, looking up quietly from her account books as if used to these sudden intrusions. ' I think he expected you to join him, and you will still be in time if you run across the park.' ' No thanks, Nell, I prefer luxuriating on the sofa and hearing you talk. What's the news ? ' ' I've told you repeatedly not to call me Nell ; somebody might hear you,' said Helen sharply, 'and, Sir Giles, will you please take off your hat and put your pipe in your pocket. I'm ashamed of you.' ' I only did it to see what you'd say,' grinned the baronet, inserting his pipe into its case. ' Soho ! your ladyship has not been long catch ing the manners and tone of command ! Busy again among those frowsy papers I see.' ' Yes, Lady Hartleigh may return when she pleases now.

' Charley says he counts a great deal upon my face and manners to touch her, but we women don't take much account of each other's good looks in our likes and dislikes. If I made advances they would probably be repelled, simply to spite me, whereas if I remain quiet, Lady Hartleigh's affection for her son will eventually induce her to make the first move, and then I shall be prepared to meet her \u2014 a quarter ofthe way.' ' Egad ! you've become quite a diplomatist,' laughed Sir Giles enjoyably. ' Whoever would have thought that when I introduced you to Hartleigh as a pretty governess, thinking that you would at most suck a thousand pounds or two out of him \u2014 you should have taken his coronet and clapped it so promptly on your frizzly head ? And then the change in your ways ! You used to be as merry as a wren : now you're high and dry as a queen.' ' We act according to the parts we have to play, you know.' ' So it seems, and I. suppose you'll be satis fied with nothing less than playing your part in the front row of society, right among the swells ?

' It appears to me that if you are fitted for good company, I am.' ' Thank you for the comparison,' sniggered the baronet, ' but you see I'm a man, and that makes a difference.' ' It makes a difference, because you concoct the laws and we women suffer by them,' broke out Flelen, with warmth. ' A man holds him self privileged to be as immoral and vicious as he pleases before marriage, for marriage wipes out all his old scores and gives him a clean bill of health. If anybody alludes to his former bad courses, people say, \" Oh, that's when he was young, and was sowing his wild oats,\" but if an unfortunate girl of sixteen or seventeen, with not judgment enough to know what she is about, commits but one fault, you men would have her bear the shame of it for life, and not one of you thinks of urging her youth as an ex cuse for her weakness.' ' Bravo, my lady ! you're making a speech.' ' Ah, it's because I've no patience with such injustice,' continued Helen, whose face had flushed. ' Why, among the women whom you call \"fallen\" there are many who have a hun dred times more honesty, kindness, and good feeling than most of the men who have the im pudent hypocrisy to look down on them.

' What makes you say such plaguey dis agreeable things ? I've never done anything to hurt you.' ' I've told you over and over again that I hate the Carews,' declared Helen, with vehe mence ; ' and when I hate it's in good earnest.

' Show Mr. Pot tinger in, please ' \u2014 and she continued : ' Mr. Pottinger was Charley's best man on our wed ding-day ; and so we bought him a silver tea and coffee service as an acknowledgment.

The handsomest room he had seen in his life was the council chamber of the Stilborough town hall, which had chairs of red Utrecht velvet, and he had been fain to draw on his imagination for ideas as to the appearance of apartments wherein rich Indian woods, satins, ivory, buhl, and marble, were profusely used in ornamentation. But his liveliest dreams had never pictured to him such a splendid chamber as that morning-room where Helen sat on a blue silk ottoman, with numberless costly knick knacks round her ; neither had they prepared him for anything like the graciousness which the mistress of so much finery displayed towards him. Helen was dressed in a black velvet gown, buttoned close up to the throat, and sur mounted by a small ruff. Three rows of rich coral beads hung round her neck, and bracelets of the same stone \u2014 the most becoming of all with black velvet \u2014 set off the whiteness of her slight wrists. On her daintily crimped hair was set the tiniest of lace caps, giving her a pretty air of matronly dignity. She was too anxious to make friends every where not to evince the utmost affability towards a grocer-churchwarden, so extended to him one of her jewelled hands, bade him smilingly to be seated, and waived off in a few well-chosen words the thanks which he emitted for his tea and coffee service as a most costly gift"], [165, "THE MISTRESS OF HAZELWOOD. 153 ' Oh, you owe us no thanks, Mr. Pottinger, I'm sure \u2014 the thanks should come from us.

' Mr. Pottinger's gesture implied that he never took the liberty to wonder at anything concerning his betters. ' Oh, the reason was simple enough,' laughed Helen. ' My father, who is a clergyman, you know, is away in China, and I was staying with an aunt who did not approve of my marriage with Lord Hartleigh on religious grounds, my aunt being a Catholic and saying I should marry none but a Catholic. So I left her house and got married without her consent' ' And quite right too, my lady,' said Mr. Pottinger. He did not know whether he was expected to laugh at the good turn played to the popish aunt, or to express indignation at her tyranny.

' Yes, my lady, that's \" Stubb's Piece,\" and it's a trouble to others besides horses. We in the town council have had many a set-to to gether about it' ' Indeed, \u2014 in what way ? ' ' Why, you see, my lady that 'ere is a bit of Corporation ground,' answered Mr. Pottinger, delighted at the turn the conversation was taking, and insensibly lowering his voice as if he were hatching a conspiracy, ' and some time ago a man came who wanted to give us a hand some price sor it and set up a dye-factory on the hill. As the dye-works would have added a good deal to the prosperity of our town, I was in favour of the sale, but some others in the Council wouldn't hear of it, sor fear of offending Sir Peter Carew.' ' And why should Sir Peter Carew have felt offended ? ' asked Helen, quickly. ' Why, your ladyship, you see, if \" Stubb's Piece \" were taken away, the race-course would be broken up, and Sir Peter couldn't form another out of his own ground \u2014 so that it would be like abolishing the races altogether, which wouldn't suit him.'"], [167, "THE MISTRESS OF HAZELWOOD. 155 ' I see. So then you have abandoned the idea of the sale ? ' ' / haven't abandoned it, my lady,' replied the grocer adroitly ; ' I mean to take up the question again and again \u2014 with all respect to Sir Peter, against whom I wish no harm \u2014 only wanting that our town may have its dues. I'm afraid, though, it won't be of much use for me to talk, for the townspeople hold very hard by their races.' ' Well, but would there not be a means of conciliating the two things \u2014 maintaining your races and selling your land ? ' asked Helen, in a voice betokening her eagerness. ' Supposing a ground were found elsewhere for the races ? Supposing we provided you a course out of Hazelwood Park ? I am sure Lord Hartleigh would lend himself to anything that would be of advantage to Stilborough.' ' Oh, my lady, that would alter the case entirely,' answered Mr. Pottinger gushingly. ' You think so ? The corporation would really sell that piece of land if they were sure of obtaining a course elsewhere ?' ' I don't think there can be a doubt about it, my lady. The establishment of a factory would bring a good deal more trade to our town, and if we could have that and the races together, why I don't see how even Sir Peter could find anything to object to. He might"], [168, "156 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. not like the change, but he wouldn't dare say much about it openly.' ' He certainly could not without evincing more selfishness than I suppose him capable of,' remarked Helen calmly. She was throbbing at the heart. Any physiognomist who had watched her during the last few minutes would have seen her features illumined as by gleams of lightning flashing over them. At the outset of the con versation she had taken up a basket of wools and begun to wind them, but by-and-by her inward agitation became too intense for her agile fingers to do their work properly. Three times she had let a ball of scarlet worsted slip and fall to the carpet ; three times had Mr. Pottinger ducked down to pick it up. For what a glorious vision was that which the grocer had abruptly conjured up before her! The races transferred to Hazelwood, and she would become every year, during three days, the hostess of all the notables in the county ! People of consequence would have no alterna tive between accepting to be her guests or staying away, and what though the more prudish ladies might prefer to keep aloof for a year or two, they would all come back in flocks as time rolled on ; for by instituting new prizes, and by indulging in lavish hospi-"], [169, "THE MISTRESS OF HAZELWOOD. 157 talities on a far princelier scale than the Carews could afford, she would apply herself to convert the Stilborough races into one of the most pleasant meetings in the kingdom \u2014 a meeting to be talked of for its jollity, and lauded every where. And above all this was to be reckoned the joy \u2014 that unutterable joy which none feel so acutely as women \u2014 of humbling, damaging, perhaps ruining an enemy. On his side Mr. Pottinger was quite alive to all that was passing in her ladyship's mind, and the thing satisfied him well. To be sure he\" was not now on the road to getting the races abolished, he was only getting them transferred; but next to the pleasure of suppressing an ob noxious thing, must assuredly be counted the pleasure of getting it removed to some other spot. The races might deteriorate in the pro cess of removal, or perhaps not take root in their new soil, and so decline and perish ; for institutions are much like flowers, and will not always bear transplanting. In any event, he \u2014 Pottinger \u2014 would have done his duty to the best of his lights ; and \u2014 which was also an im portant consideration \u2014 he would have rendered the pretty Lady of Hazelwood a service which she would not be likely to forget. The two glanced at each other, their eyes met for a brief instant, and Helen discerned that, although her motives might be divined by her visitor, he"], [170, "158 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. placed himself at her entire devotion. The in terview closed with mutual gratification. ' Does your ladyship then authorise me to inform the town council that my lord would fur nish a new race-course in case of need?' in quired the grocer humbly, as he rose to depart. ' Yes, Mr. Pottinger, I will speak to Lord Hartleigh about it as soon as he comes in,' re plied Helen. ' The town will feel eternally obliged to your ladyship.' ' I am only paying my footing, as is binding on a new-comer,' said Helen, with the smile of a veritable grande dame."], [171, "159 CHAPTER XI. A COMMITTEE OF WAYS AND MEANS. Poor Sir Peter ! he might well exclaim : ' I have lived too long,' as he saw ruin pour in from all quarters into his house. Families who have been living long on credit are like people dancing on the ice. They feel the ground firm under their tread, they stamp, erect booths, roast an ox whole, make merry, and think that this is going to last for ever. But suddenly the atmosphere changes, and in less than a day there is a general break up on all sides at once. Step wherever you will now and the ice cracks ; all is mess, confu sion, danger, and no safety remains but in flight, if haply it be not too late to fly. On the first morning of the races Sir Peter was one of the most easy men alive. He owed money in heaps, so did his children, but credi tors were full of trust, sor they had never been wronged of a penny, nor even put off for pay ment till their patience was exhausted. When ever a bill was sent in to Royster Hall, money"], [172, "160 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. had somehow been found to meet it, and thus, though liabilities were daily multiplied, a con- tinual succession of payments had kept the credit of Sir Peter sound as that of many a far richer man. But in one day all this was changed. Oswald Carew's heavy losses, by compelling the family to take stock of their re- sources, had shown them that they had nothing or nearly nothing. Then tailors and milliners, having caught rumours of the situation, began to dun, not Sir Peter, but the sons and daugh- ters separately, each for his and her own indebt- edness ; and this general pressure, obliging them all to fall back for succour upon the parental funds, threatened to convert an intri- cate dilemma into an irremediable bankruptcy ; for not even the Bank of England could honour its paper if all the holders of notes were to be- siege its counters together. Oswald Carew was not the cause of the ruin that was lighting upon his house ; he had only accelerated a crisis which must have come sooner or later, and which, it was almost a wonder, could have been staved off so long. However, as was usual with them in their strong mutual affection, the Carews all rallied at the sight of danger and clubbed their means to do that which pressed most \u2014 ward off disgrace from the head of the heir. Before anything else was thought of, Oswald's bets must be paid."], [173, "A COMMITTEE OF WAYS AND MEANS. 161 Philip gave up the 4,000/. which he had won by ' hedging ' (Oswald felt more humiliation in accepting this than all the other money) ; Sir Peter surrendered his profits on the races ; Jack Carew, the naval lieutenant, who opportunely returned home from a three years' cruise with about 1,000/. of pay and prize-money, which he had fondly hoped would serve him for a three months' spree, handed over almost every far thing of it, and applied to be re-commissioned forthwith ; all the other brothers borrowed money as they could ; and the sisters, married and single, with a self-denial for which not one thought of taking any credit to herself, packed up their trinkets in a case and sent them to a fashionable pawnbroker's. By these and other methods were raised the 16,500/. which con stituted the total of Oswald's losings ; and the money being lodged at his banker's, that peni tent, but not converted, officer was enabled to post his cheques in time for settling-day, and so keep his honour (as the world understands honour) untarnished. But when this had been accomplished came the morrow, and with it the question of what was to be done next ; for the family could not resume their life on its former footing. Money must be got to settle, or at least compound with, the other debts, which were not of ' honour ; ' and when these came to be examined in a grand VOL. 1.

Poor Sir Peter, with all his children around him, sat at the table in his study, his aching brow resting on his hand, and his eye scanning with horror the schedule which he had made out. The confiding old man had not even sus pected that any of his children had debts of their own. He had fancied that the occasional applications which they made for gifts in excess of their allowances represented the sum of their extravagances, and that the doles which he never refused to furnish forth always sufficed to set them straight again. But now Oswald con fessed to owing about 10,000/., Philip 5,000/., and the other brothers, excepting the sailor, sums of like amount. As to the daughters, the married ones had the excuse of housekeeping, carriage keeping, and late-hours-in-town-keeping to ex cuse debts of 7,000/. and 6,000/. respectively ; but the girls too were in a quandary, and even Amy pleaded guilty to bills aggregating 500/. No one sought to diminish aught of what he or she owed, or to mitigate his or her mea culpa \u2014 though if the truth must be told there was a disposition to consider that the maximum of heinousness had indubitably been reached by Amy with her 500/. To that even Oswald frowned, and muttered, ' Gad ! this is too bad,'"], [175, "A COMMITTEE OF WAYS AND MEANS. 163 when the rueful avowal was blushingly made. At last when cyphers had been added up it was proved that, taking Sir Peter's own debts and those of the estate into account, the collective indebtedness of the Carews fell little short of 50,000/. ; whereon Sir Peter uttered a piteous groan, and repeated what he had already re marked more than once : ' My dears, I've lived too long. Thank God your mother is not alive to see this. What would she have said ? ' It was resolved that Oswald and Philip must sell out and make a temporary arrangement with their creditors out ofthe price of their commis sions, and that Sir Peter must exert his Parlia mentary influence to procure them Government appointments. Places were also to be begged for on behalf of Captains Hunt and Warrener, who promised to reduce their expenditure and ' toil like horses ' whenever work should be found for them. The next thing to do was to mortgage as much of the Royster property as was not already encumbered, and as a last reluctant expe dient Sir Peter proposed to farm out his beloved racecourse. He had often been told that in more knowing hands than his the gate-money and stand-admissions might be made to yield twice as much as they did to him ; and a turf speculator had even once offered to take the entire manage ment and profits of the races off his hands for M 2"], [176, "164 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 15,000/. \u2014 a proposal which he had then scouted as almost an insult. But the insult of to-day is often the favour of to-morrow, and Sir Peter now mused that 1 5,000/. would go a long way towards extricating him from his difficulties. He might pay a multitude of debts with it ; and these once disposed of, the family might contrive to keep their heads above water until some buoy of sal vation came within their reach \u2014 either in the shape of a rich marriage for one of the girls, a legacy, or some other providential thing as yet undreamed of. When there is union in a household any conference undertaken to form a joint league against trouble leads to a revival of hope. Each member adds to his own strength that of the others, and the common stock of energy becomes increased tenfold. The Carews, having duly debated on the above resolutions, took heart of grace, and were consoling themselves with the reflection that there might still be cakes and ale on the shelf, when the postman passed by the window on his midday rounds. Amy ran out to fetch the mail, and returned with one letter, which she handed to her father. As all in the room were talking none noticed the sudden alteration in Sir Peter's countenance as he perused the missive ; but presently he put up his hand to enjoin silence, and in trembling accents read the contents aloud."], [177, "A COMMITTEE OF WAYS AND MEANS. 165 This is how the letter ran : \u2014 POTTINGER AND SON, M Te* a% 25 High Street, +* ** Stilborough.

'Sir,\u2014 I take the liberty of writing these lines to say that I have given the Town Council notice of a motion which will be debated at the next sitting, if it please the Almighty. It is to this effect : ' That the Corporation do acquaint Sir Peter Carew, Bart, M.P., with their intention to sell, so soon as conveniently may be, and for building purposes, the plot of grass land known as \" Stubb's Piece.\" ' As you may know, Sir, there was talk some time back of selling this Stubb's Piece for establishing dye works thereon ; but the Corporation, not liking to interfere with the races, refused a liberal offer made by a party who had come from town for the purpose. I am happy to say that Lord Hartleigh, having now kindly offered to let a new course be made in Hazel wood Park, there is a chance of our being able to have both the races and the dye-works, which, as you must see, Sir, would be much for the advantage of our town. Hoping, therefore, Sir, that you, who have always been a friend to Stilborough, will not see fit to oppose my motion, I have the honour to remain, ' Yours respectfully to command, 'Joseph Pottinger. ' Sir Peter Carew, Bart., M.P.'"], [178, "166 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. ' That's Hartleigh's doing,' cried one of the brothers when the first moment of stupefaction had subsided. ' Yes, that's how he parries the thrust you women made at his wife the other day,' re marked Oswald. ' I told you what would come of your precious floutings.' ' But, gracious me ! we couldn't receive his wife when the Duchess had pronounced against her ! ' exclaimed Mrs. Warrener tartly. ' And the woman never came amongst us at all, so that she can't have any incivility to complain of,' chimed in Mrs. Hunt in the same tone. ' You need not have been in such a deuced hurry to believe all you heard against her,' observed Philip, biting his nails. ' Why, how can you be so disingenuous, Phil ? ' ejaculated Mrs. Hunt. ' You said your self that half of it all was true.' ' And, if she has had any finger in this, I say, for my part, that she is not a person whom I would ever disgrace myself by speaking to,' declared Mrs. Warrener with emphasis. ' For God's sake finish that senseless chat tering !' bawled Sir Peter ; and, turning with the injustice of peevishness on the wrong offender, he singled out Amy, who had not opened her lips. ' Hold your tongue, will you, Amy ? What can you know of such matters ?'"], [179, "A COMMITTEE OF WAYS AND MEANS. 167 ' But, papa, I never spoke.' ' Don't answer me, child : it's rude and un dutiful.

' I believe we have the right of preemption in \" Stubb's Piece.\" ' ' No, that we haven't,' said Basil, the bar rister. ' Our right expired ten years ago \u2014 I've seen the deed. But we can go to law about it.' ' Who's Pottinger ? ' asked Jack, the sailor. ' A sort of go-to-meeting cad, who holds the plate at the church-door on Sundays,' re joined Albert, of the Foreign Office, brushing a speck of dust off his satin scarf. ' Couldn't we go and wring his neck ? ' pro posed Jack as if he meant it. ' The best thing to do is to outbid the dye-factory man when the land is put up for sale,' suggested George, the War Office clerk. 'And where's the money to come from?' inquired Philip. ' No, I'll tell you what's the simplest way to get us out of this tangle,' said Oswald, inter vening with authority. ' Do you, Maud and Alice, go and put on your bonnets and start off for Hazelwood to make it up with Lady Hart leigh. We can't quarrel with our bread-and butter to please the Duchess of Grandton.'"], [180, "168 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 'I go and call on that woman? Never!' vowed Mrs. Warrener. ' I would rather die first,' protested Mrs. Hunt. 'What do you say to such a proposal, papa ? ' ' I say that if the races are taken from us we shall be ruined. Now settle the matter as you choose,' replied Sir Peter, standing up, with his hands despondingly thrust into his pockets. Mrs. Warrener and Mrs. Hunt, plump and pretty women, began to cry ; seeing which their husbands made prudent exit, knowing that such showers usually boded domestic storms. Both ladies declared it was very hard that they should be made scapegoats of. They had com mitted no crimes that they should be forced to consort with improper people. They had their reputations to consider ; and even if reduced to eating a crust of bread at a street-corner should still be particular as to the company they kept. Sir Peter exploded into unaccustomed oaths, then assumed the air of a martyr, and said he was quite content to go to the workhouse. In fact, he would rather like it : he should be relieved of his miseries and of the society of rebellious children, who, instead of consulting how they might assist him in his distress, were only concerned about their petty vanities and unladylike animosities. A stride which he made towards the door, as though he would"], [181, "A COMMITTEE OF WAYS AND MEANS. 169 immediately go and place himself in the hands of the parochial authorities, brought a new gush of tears from the sisters and a kind of murmuring surrender from Mrs. Warrener, who said she would try and gather fortitude for the task imposed upon her. Perhaps she should feel equal to it to-morrow. 'What's the use of putting it off till to morrow ? ' blurted out Philip. ' We are never sure of to-morrow \u2014 a hundred things may hap pen before then.' ' That is a truth that will bear no jesting upon,' said Sir Peter wearily. 'Who knows where we may all be to-morrow ? Oh, boys, boys ! that you should have brought me to this ! \u2014 you who, at my time of life, I had a right to look to as a comfort and support. Oh, it's too wretched to think of \u2014 too wretched ! ' And he left the room. ' I don't like to see the governor take on in that way,' remarked Jack Carew with feeling. ' You seem to have been playing pretty pranks with him, all of you.' ' Come, a nice one you are to preach ! ' re torted Philip. 'Just as if you wouldn't have spent as much as any of us if you hadn't been boxed up in your ship ! ' ' Why, you sailors are the most wanton spendthrifts in the world,' broke out Mrs. Warrener, drying her tears, and delighted to"], [182, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 170 turn the current of her feelings on to a defence less head. ' One would think you had holes in every one of your pockets, so prodigally does your money leak away,' concurred Mrs. Hunt, join ing in the quarry. Jack beat a retreat, and his sisters were soothed. It was truly distasteful to them to pay this visit to Hazelwood, because of the comments which other ladies might make upon the proceeding, but they presently solaced them selves with the thought that their condescension would call sor a proportionate display of grati tude on the part of the person whom they were so signally honouring. They requested that their father, Oswald, and their own husbands might accompany them, to give more dclat to their pilgrimage ; and they went up stairs to dress, saying they would take Amy with them, to complete the party. Amy had no objection to the ride until her sisters told her categorically that her presence had an object, as the}1 hoped the party might fall in with Sir Giles Taplow, who was paying his suit to her, and who must now be encouraged. For Mrs. Warrener and Mrs. Hunt had no notion of devoting themselves alone for the public good, and when they were closeted with Amy they did not mince matters to her. ' You see, Amy dear, we are all doing what"], [183, "A COMMITTEE OF WAYS AND MEANS. 171 we can, and you must do the same \u2014 so must Oswald. We told him this morning that he must, marry Louie Ambermere, and we shall leave him no rest till he proposes. As for you, it is quite a mercy that you should have smitten Sir Giles, who is rich and a perfect gentleman. Many a girl would go down on her knees for such a match, and it will be unpardonable if you refuse him.' ' But Sir Giles has never asked me to marry him,' pleaded Amy, whose heart sank. ' Oh, leave that to us. We'll see that he proposes to you,' said the elder of the married sisters."], [184, "172 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. CHAPTER XII VEXED QUESTIONS. Amy was a good girl \u2014 the pet of her father, because of her sweet temper ; the slave of her brothers and sisters, because of her invariable willingness to oblige. They were continually resorting to her for small services, without ever finding her good-nature at fault. She had kept house even before her sister Alice was married, and now that this duty properly devolved on her sister Isabel, who was a year older than her, everybody was for having the authority rest with Amy \u2014 she was such an excellent caterer, so punctual, too, and able in her management of servants. She wrote a very pretty hand, and was Sir Peter's secretary in all important corre spondence, as well as his auditor of accounts. When her brothers were at home she overlooked their linen ; and if they were bound on any ma tutinal expedition of sport, or were starting to time by an early train, it was on her they always relied for having their breakfast ready and their dogcart or horses, as the case might be, round"], [185, "VEXED QUESTIONS. 173 in time. Nor on such occasions would she ever fail herself, no matter what might be the hour, to be down and standing at the tea urn to speed the parting wayfarer. She was lively and full of song as a bird, patient, eager to please, quick to feel others' pains and to remedy them as she best could. To her was due all the comfort of the home which she graced ; yet nobody thought of giving her thanks, because her presence was like sunshine, of whose benefits we are only sen sible when we miss it. Being all in all to her family, Amy had come to think of her father, brothers, and sisters as being all in the world to her ; therefore the sug gestion that she should contract a rich marriage for their sakes, without any reference to her own inclinations, was not one which would make her repine or rebel. It was a form of self-sa crifice which, under the present circumstances of pinching need, wore almost the look of duty. She cried, because she did not like Sir Giles Taplow ; but her heart was free, and the tears which she shed were no more than the prospect of marrying any other man would have caused to flow. Only faint traces of them remained when she took her seat in the open landau opposite her sisters. It was quite a cavalcade which started for Hazelwood ; but the journey proved bootless, for Lady Hartleigh was not at home. She had"], [186, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 174 gone out with her husband and Sir Giles to make the acquaintance of the cottage tenants, and there was nothing for it but to leave cards. When Helen returned and saw all these dogs eared pasteboards on the hall-table her bosom heaved with triumph, and she playfully touched her husband's shoulder with her parasol, as much as to say, ' There, I told you they would not be long coming.' Lord Hartleigh was en chanted, for he loathed the quarrel with the Carews ; and he was for having a carriage brought round at once, in order that the visit might be returned that very afternoon. But Helen said this would look like too much eager ness. She allowed two clear days to elapse before repaying the call, and even then chose a time when she conjectured that the Carews would all be absent at a charity bazaar being held in a neighbouring village. The conse quence was that, etiquette having been com plied with on both sides, it lay with the Carews to make the next step towards striking up an actual acquaintance ; and Helen, knowing full well what motives of fear must have dictated their last visit, felt persuaded that she would not have to wait long sor the next step, which would consecrate her victory. Meanwhile she retracted nothing from the instructions which she had given Mr. Pottinger \u2014 instructions, which, by the way, Lord Hartleigh had tacitly"], [187, "VEXED QUESTIONS. 175 ratified, as he did everything which his wife suggested. The. doughty opponent of horse-racing was bounding about Stilborough like a parched pea in a shovel. Never had there been seen a grocer so active, so speechful, so little occupied about his figs. He left his shop to the care of his son and an apprentice whilst he bustled about to dazzle the minds of his fellow-bur gesses with visions of what vast, ever-increas ing wealth would be added to the town if it had a row of prosperous factories flourishing in its suburbs. Already his robust imagination, de molishing obstacles and spanning time, had multiplied the one dye-factory by ten, twenty, fifty, till a whole forest of tall chimneys rose around Stilborough, shooting columns of black smoke over a borough which should no longer be a mean third-rate market-town, but a thriving, thickly-peopled city, having its garrison, assize courts, terminus, and returning two members to Parliament. ' And then, as to those races, see what an improvement the new course would be ! ' added the transported grocer. ' Why, Hazel wood is twice as fine a park as Royster ; and as my lord wouldn't want to make profit out of the races, as Sir Peter does, he could have all the bad characters excluded, so that the meeting would be quite genteel and select \u2014 with no welchers, no roughs, no thieves, no nothing im-"], [188, "176 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. moral. As you know, I'm not partial to races myself, because my conscience tells me they ain't godly, but racing at' Hazelwood would be such a different thing to what it is at Royster, that, though I shouldn't go to such sport myself, I should be content to let others go if they pleased without hindering 'em.' Thus spoke this crafty bandier of words, leading away many. Perhaps he believed half he said \u2014 perhaps all, for we easily work ourselves up into a faith in what suits us. Anyhow, his cause soon re ceived unhoped-for aid from the hasty action taken by Sir Peter Carew. Instead of reply ing to the grocer's letter the baronet, through his solicitor, drily informed Mr. Brindle, the Mayor, of his intention to contest the right of the Corporation to sell Stubb's Piece \u2014 the which, as he alleged, had been allotted to all time as a recreation-ground for the borough. Now, nothing puts Englishmen so promptly on their mettle as a denial of their rights. The town clerk of Stilborough, one Japper, an attorney, and a shrewd fellow, forthwith thrust his re markably prying nose into the borough records and arrived at legal conclusions on three points : ist. That Sir Peter Carew had no right of preemption of Stubb's Piece, at a fair valuation by appraiser, as he contended. 2nd. That the Corporation had every right"], [189, "VEXED QUESTIONS. 177 to sell Stubb's Piece to whom, and for what purpose, they pleased. 3rd. That the Corporation had a right of way, hitherto unclaimed, right through Sir Peter's own park, and through a portion of it where of late years an orchard had been planted. It appeared, indeed, that the whole of the ground where the racecourse now stood had formerly belonged to the Corporation. Sir Peter's grandfather had bought the greater part of it, and had doubtless intended to purchase the remainder at some future time, as was proved by the preemption clause which he had caused to be inserted, giving him, or his heirs, power to purchase at a fair valuation at any time within fifty years. When, however, the races had been instituted there was no longer any reason why he should buy, for the Cor poration had seemed perfectly content that Stubb's Piece should be used to form part of the racecourse, and the arrangement between them and the occupants of Royster Hall had worked well for years and years, so that the term of preemption had expired without either of the parties noticing it. With respect to the right of way through Royster Park, that had been reserved for so long as Stubb's Piece should remain in possession of the Corporation ; but it had never been claimed, because it was of no utility ; and Sir Peter's father had been vol. 1. N"], [190, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 178 allowed to cut off a part of the road that led nowhither but to Stubb's Piece, and convert it into a plantation. The case was going to be come quite different, though, if Stubb's Piece were sold as building ground, for then the shortest cut from Stilborough to this plot of land would lie by a road running right through the park, within a stone's throw of the Hall windows. When Sir Peter received intimation of these legal discoveries, through one of those politely irritating letters which lawyers know so well how to pen, he saw that he was no longer fighting for mere land or money, but for very hearth and home. It would be bad enough to have his park thrown open to all the tramps and knife-grinders of the country ; but if it were to become a high-road for scores or hundreds of operatives passing two or three times a day, and sor carts and vans conveying merchandise, the Hall would become uninha bitable. Not only that, but the whole estate would for a while so decline in value that it would be impossible to mortgage it for any adequate sum, while to let the house and grounds as a gentleman's country residence, would, of course, be for evermore out of the question. Too proud to attempt conciliation where he fancied there lurked a fixed deter mination to slight him and do him wrong, Sir"], [191, "VEXED QUESTIONS. 179 Peter threw away his scabbard and prepared for a combat without quarter. He referred Mr. Japper, once and for all, to his solicitor, and those two worthies soon became locked in the embrace of a close correspondence wherein notices of process, threats of traversing, de murring, &c, were as freely exchanged as hugs in a ring. Up to this time Mr. Pottinger had only been able to convert to his cause two Councillors \u2014 Wigson, hairdresser, and Jones, tailor \u2014 both secretly inimical to the Carews, because they had their hair cut and their coats made in Lon- don. There now joined him Thompson, baker, and Jackson, glazier, both clamorous for the right of way, of which they had never felt the need before, but which they now vowed to be indispensable to the soothing of their ruffled sense of justice, and further, to the saving for them of a sinful waste of time as they drove about in their avocations. Nothing was now talked of in Stilborough but this right of way, and the determination to have it. One would have thought that Sir Peter had deprived the town of trial by jury, or cut off its water-supply, or suppressed the liberty of public worship. One night the borough was placarded with handbills urging on the townsmen to make ' no surrender.' A quorum of influential citi zens issued yellow posters convening a public N 2"], [192, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 180 meeting sor the purpose of drawing up a peti tion to the Town Council ; and some wag in the town composed a war-ditty which was loudly yelled by street-boys and by jovial souls in public-house taprooms : \u2014 I think I hear Sir Peter say, [Chorus!] Fire, my hearties, fire away ! ' I mean to stop their right of way ! ' Fire, &c. But the townsmen roused them for the fray ; Fire, fcc. And Pottinger he won the day. With a toora-looral, ry-de-fol-de-rol, &c. Fired by which long-winded lyric (for of its stanzas there was no end) some hot young bloods of eighteen or thereabouts resolved to form a fearless procession, and on the forth coming Sunday afternoon march through Roy ster Park, just to take practical possession of the right for which their fathers were about to have a legal tussle. But Mr. Pottinger depre cated all such disorderly courses and noisy agitation. Like statesmen who feel themselves to be on the point of attaining their ends he could afford to evince moderation. A few days had made a popular leader and hero of him. The law was in his mouth, and nothing but the law ; he wished to rob no man of his dues, only to stand up for his own, as it behoved every Englishman to do. As the Town Council consisted of twelve"], [193, "VEXED QUESTIONS. 181 members, not including the Mayor, seven had to be accounted for besides Mr. Pottinger and the four who were banded with him. The opposition was, of course, led by Mr. Pettigrew, the grocer's inveterate but now much diminished foe ; and he had behind him Whispie, horse dealer, who was often patronised by the Carews, and had no wish to displease them ; Jollewe ther, stationer, bookseller, and photographer, who had been honoured with sittings by Sir Peter's daughters ; and Cribbs, undertaker, who hoped his house would be honoured with orders for coffins sor the numerous Carews as it came to the turn of each to be buried ; wherefore he, too, was not anxious to vex such a promising family of customers. The other Councillors were Wilkins, hosier ; Dr. Poltisham, physician ; and Nibbs, chemist. Now, Wilkins and Pol tisham, being loth to compromise themselves, took to flight on the day before the grocer's motion was to be discussed \u2014 the one being hastily summoned, as he said, to see a patient a hundred miles off; the other's presence being imperatively required at a grand sale of woollen socks in London. There remained Nibbs, the chemist, whose soul was agitated by contrary winds, and who could not make up his mind which way he should vote \u2014 thereby sorely dis tressing Mr. Brindle, the Mayor ; for if Nibbs eventually voted with Mr. Pettigrew the divi-"], [194, "182 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. sion would be equal, and he, Mr. Brindle, would have to give the casting suffrage, a responsibility which his innermost vitals ab horred. But by the time the debate was opened it was manifest that Mr. Pottinger must gain his point, for the Council could not resist the pres sure of public opinion out of doors. In times of commotion deliberative assemblies do not guide the popular current, they follow it. Great was the change that had taken place within a few days, for who but a month before would have dared prophesy that the Corporation of Stilborough would have the hardihood to go to war with the respected borough M.P. about a trumpery bit of land ? But, then, who would have dared predict, when the Long Parliament met, that it would behead its King and proclaim a Republic ? When differences arise there is no foreseeing the result of them. As Mr. Pottin ger sagaciously remarked, on rising to bring for ward his motion, ' The question had ceased to be as to whether certain horse-races should be held on this spot of ground or on that : it had become a question as to whether an ancient, industrious town would allow its just rights to be encroached upon. No sane person cared whether races were run, here or there, provided the ground were good \u2014 (' Hear, hear') \u2014 but what people did care for was to prevent a baronet"], [195, "VEXED QUESTIONS. 183 coming down and saying, in a saucy style, \" You've held your races on my grounds, and you shall hold them there for ever, because it suits me ; and I won't let you remove to a better course, and you shan't set up manufactures, and you shan't go to your own ground by the shortest way, because all that would interfere with my profits.\" Here was language which no freeborn men could submit to. (' Hear, hear.') Sir Peter Carew was simply -trying to check the prosperity of the town for his own ends, and to evade the fulfilment of an obliga tion freely contracted by his forefathers and by virtue of which they had doubtless been able to purchase land of the Corporation at a cheaper rate than could otherwise have been the case. (' Hear, hear.') Sir Peter couldn't complain that they had exercised their right of way oppress ively, for they had been seventy years without claiming it at all ; but was that any excuse for his not conceding it at present ? Why, it was exactly as if a man were to say about some money lent him, \" Oh, you have been so obliging in not bothering me about it for so long, that I can't think of paying you now.\" ' (' Hear, hear,' and a laugh.') ' Sir, the Statute of Limitations does allow a man to hold language paramount to that after a lapse of seven years,' exclaimed Mr. Petti grew triumphantly."], [196, "184 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. ' Sir, no gentleman pleads the Statute of Limitations,' rejoined Mr. Pottinger loftily. ' We are talking about law, not about gen tlemen,' said Mr. Pettigrew, ' Each man talks of what- he chooses, sir,' answered Mr. Pottinger, with his usual readiness of retort ; and, amidst approving mirth and ap plause, he resumed : ' So what we desire now, Mr. Mayor, is to get back our own \u2014 simply that. We want \" Stubb's Piece \" because without it the right of way would be of no use to us ; and we want our right of way because it has been denied us : there lies the case in a nutshell.' ('Hear, hear, hear.') ' I think it would be very pleasant if we could try conciliation,' remarked Mr. Nibbs, the chemist, a spare, nervous man, who was always wiping moisture from his brow with a red silk handkerchief. ' The time for conciliation is past,' stoutly declared Mr. Thompson, the baker, a gentle man with a very floury grey coat, and eyebrows which looked as if they had been powdered. ' If Sir Peter Carew had not disputed our right I, for one, should have voted for keeping the races where they are, on the principle of \" let well alone\" \u2014 (' Hear, hear,' from all except Mr. Pottinger) \u2014 but I call it a shabby thing to deny a written obligation, and therefore I shall vote"], [197, "VEXED QUESTIONS. 185 for Pottinger's motion, simply that Sir Peter may be punished.' ' Hear, hear!' from Messrs. Wigson, Jones, and Jackson ; and a sigh apiece from Messrs. Nibbs and Brindle. ' Well, since we seem all agreed, I think it would be very pleasant if we could vote without any division,' observed Mr. Nibbs. ' No, sir, we're not agreed, and I mean to divide the Council, even if I'm the only one on my side,' cried Mr. Pettigrew, springing up and striking his breast with the defiant gesture of one who risks being shot for his opinions. ' Yes, Pottinger, you may stare at me, but I'm not one to be frightened by the factious doings of any Jack Cade or Wat Tyler, I'm not!' ' Do you mean to insinuate that I'm one of Jack Cade's sort?' inquired Mr. Pottinger, with his head a-cock. ' I know what I mean, sir, and that's enough,' intrepidly replied Mr. Pettigrew. ' I ain't one of those who go sneaking round the coat-skirts of lords to get silver tea-services presented to me : no, sir.' ' I scorn that imputation,' cried the grocer, blushing scarlet ; ' and you know you're a mean fellar for making it, Pettigrew.' ' People won't believe that simply because you say it, Pottinger.'"], [198, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 186 'Go it, ye cripples\u2014 put 'em in a ring to fight ! ' ejaculated Mr. Whispie jocosely. ' Question !' shouted most of the other Coun cillors, while the two antagonists exchanged epi grams which were inaudible in the tumult. ' Well, the question is, whether we're going to let Sir Peter Carew give us all a fillip on the nose,' bawled Mr. Thompson, the baker. ' If we don't stick up for our rights now it will be as much as to own that we haven't got any.' 'Well, but steady a bit,' interposed Mr. Whispie. ' Before making away with one race course I should like to be sure about havin' another. Where's your authority from Lord Hartleigh, Pottinger ? Haven't you anything in black and white to show us ? ' ' I had the promise of a new course from my lady's own lips,' proclaimed Mr. Pottinger pom pously, ' and that, I 'ope, is as good as black and white.' This virtually settled the matter ; for al though Mr. Pettigrew was obstreperous, tried to hinder business, and moved adjournments, his conduct only confirmed his colleagues in the desire to get quickly rid of a business that was fomenting so much bad blood. After all, Sir Peter had only himself to thank, since his in tractable conduct had rendered compromise im possible. When Mr. Pottinger's motion was put from the chair but one voice roared indig-"], [199, "VEXED QUESTIONS. 187 nantly ' No ! ' and when the show of hands was asked the draper alone flourished five fingers in the air with wild movements, as if he had needles or pins in them. Sir Peter's friends voted neither one way nor the other ; but five minutes later they thought it prudent to concur in an address of thanks to Lord Hartleigh for his gracious offer of a raceground. Mr. Pottinger had taken his measures in advance, and on the very afternoon of the vote ' Stubb's Piece ' was ornamented with a post and a board which said, ' This Ground to be Sold.' The board was overturned in less than an hour by Sir Peter's grooms. The next day another was planted, and a policeman told off to mount guard over it. On the following Sunday the young bloods of the town, no longer to be de terred from their purpose of marching through Royster Park, executed it under the leadership of young Wilkins, son of the hosier, who led them forth to the number ofa hundred and more. No one impeded their progress ; so they were obliged to vent their valour in catcalls and in derisive chorussing : \u2014 But the Council told Sir Peter, ' Nay, [Clioru s.~] Fire, my hearties, fire away ! You shall not take our right of way. Fire, &c. For what does Eighth Commandment say ? Fire, &c. \" He that prigs shall rue the day ! \" ' With a toora-looral, ry-fol, &c."], [200, "188 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. Mr. Pottinger had calculated that the march of the young rabble would be opposed by Sir Peter's lodge-porter, and he had warned the Mayor that in such an event he should require him to issue a summons against the baronet sor hindering free circulation on a public high way ; but Mr. Brindle was not used to such methods of dealing with his betters, and, fore seeing that a troublous year was in store for him, he announced his intention of not seeking re-election at the approaching Mayoral elec tion. The next candidate in rotation was Mr. Nibbs, the chemist; but he likewise said he would decline the perilous honour ; so the turn fell to Mr. Pottinger, who did not refuse \u2014 far from it \u2014 and was accordingly nominated to don the scarlet robe and gold chain on the next 9th of November."], [201, "189 CHAPTER XIII. FROM HAZELWOOD TO ROYSTER. Sir Peter began to feel that he had acted with too much precipitancy. By going to law with Stilborough he was jeopardising his seat in Parliament and saddling himself with heavy costs \u2014 nothing more. Where shall an honest lawyer be found who will rebuke the rash com- bativeness of a client and withhold him from litigation in a bad cause ? It was not Sir Peter's solicitor who warned him of the certain defeat and ruinous expense which he was about to incur, but Sir Peter himself, who was touched with compunction for having committed a blun- der. His wisest course would have been, from the first, to contest nothing of Stilborough's rights, but to go into the market and buy up ' Stubb's Piece ' at any price ; and doubtless this is what he would have done had the dispute arisen a few weeks previously, when he was not so straitened for money. He now resolved, somewhat tardily, to take the only course that befitted him ; but here a new visit to Hazel-"], [202, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 190 wood became necessary, for it was indispensable that he should know what was his exact posi tion towards the Hartleighs \u2014 whether he could reckon them as friends, or whether, as secret misgivings hinted, they were lurking foes, insti gating these unaccountable annoyances which had so suddenly beset him. This time the Carews sound Helen at home, and most charmingly amicable was the greeting she gave them. She at once broke the ice of constraint and played just the part that be seemed her, never deigning to appear as though she were conscious that there had been the faintest rumour against her fair fame. Mrs. Warrener and Mrs. Hunt, who had expected to find her vulgar, could not help considering her agreeable. Philip and Jack Carew, with their two brothers-in-law, were fascinated by her cheerful repartees and cordial smiles, and became anxious to show off to the best advan tage in her presence. Sir Peter was overjoyed, and gazed with something like paternal self reproach at the amiable young creature whom he had suspected of conspiring against him. For a while no allusion was made to the vexed question of the races, but by-and-by Sir Peter frankly introduced the subject. Helen clasped her hands and assumed an air of utter innocency and wonder. To be sure she had heard something about disturbances \u2014 they were"], [203, "FROM HAZELWOOD TO ROYSTER. 191 about a right of way, were they not ? She had felt so sorry, and, for her part, could not imagine why people should make such a fuss for the sake of journeying over one road rather than over another. 'Well, it's something more, or less, than about a right of way,' said Sir Peter, with an awkward laugh : ' they want to take the races away from Royster Park, and they say you are privy to the arrangement.' ' We ! Oh, what an absurd idea ! ' exclaimed Helen, with such an outburst of astonished merriment as argued that she could not even understand the charge. ' Why, who could have made such a suggestion as that, Sir Peter ?' ' Well, but is it not true that Hartleigh has offered the people a new racecourse ? ' inquired the baronet, rather abashed. ' What we did was to say that if the old racecourse were not available we should make a new one in Hazelwood, so as not to disap point the people of their races,' said Helen, speaking very fast, in order to prevent her husband from stammering into any clumsy explanation. ' However, we made that offer in the belief that the course in Royster Park was going to be conceded to other uses, with your own consent, Sir Peter.' ' Egad, it's not with my consent,' said the taronet"], [204, "192 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 'What they want to do is positively to wrest the course from us,' explained Mrs. War rener. ' It's an ill-natured grocer named Pottinger who is at the bottom of it all,' chimed in Mrs. Hunt. ' Dear me, how misinformed we have been ! ' remarked Helen sweetly. ' We fancied that Sir Peter had grown tired of the inconvenience of holding the races in his own park.' Lord Hartleigh reddened. All this decep tion was repugnant to him, and sor the last several minutes he had been on tenter hooks. ' H'm ; wasn't there some dispute about pro prietary rights in the river meadow ? ' he asked. ' Yes, that's exactly the point,' said Sir Peter ; ' but if you don't want to have the races removed I think I can settle the matter at issue by buying \" Stubb's Piece\" when they put it up for auction.' ' Oh ! Sir Peter, how could we desire to re move the races, when you yourself are willing to retain them ?' exclaimed Helen. ' Our only wish was to be agreeable to you \u2014 nothing else.' 'Well, to tell you the truth, it would pain me to part with the races,' confessed Sir Peter, with a little emotion. ' My father and grand father had them before me ; and one of the things that has distressed me most in con nection with this dispute is to see how prompt"], [205, "FROM HAZELWOOD TO ROYSTER. 193 Stilborough has been to forget all that our family has done for the amusement and benefit of the town, and also the many years of good understanding that have subsisted between us.' ' I am sure the Corporation have treated us shamefully,' observed Mrs. Warrener. ' They could not have behaved worse if we had been owners of a strolling circus and im properly encamped on a common,' said Mrs. Hunt ' Well, as that's the case, things will remain as they were, and I'll withdraw my offer about the course,' said Lord Hartleigh. His wife sped him a covert look, but it did not reach him. ' Of course that offer now comes to nothing,' she echoed graciously. ' Thank you, I shall take it as a kindness if you let things be,' said Sir Peter. ' How ever,' he added heartily, ' I shall look upon all this trouble as a hint to make my race-week fetes more attractive if possible \u2014 and I hope that next year they may be favoured by your presence, Lady Hartleigh.' ' But you must not wait till then before coming to see us, Lady Hartleigh,' said Mrs. Warrener politely, and rising. ' Will you do us the pleasure of coming to dine at Royster one day next week ? Will Thursday suit you ?' vol. 1. o"], [206, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 194 ' It will please me above all things,' said Helen amiably, 'and Captain Warrener tells me you have a little baby-girl. I shall ask you to let me kiss her, for I adore children ; ' saying which she personally ushered out her visitors and accompanied them as far as their carriage, exchanging pleasant remarks all the way. Scarcely had the Carews departed, however, than Helen ordered a carriage round, and set off for Stilborough, under pretence of shopping. She drew up at Pottinger 's, and the grocer, who luckily happened to be at home, came out in a white apron and with a pencil behind his ear. Helen gave him some orders through the win dow \u2014 coffee, sugar, biscuits, &c. \u2014 and whilst he was respectfully jotting these down she lowered her voice and said, ' Mr. Pottinger, Sir Peter Carew intends to buy \" Stubb's Piece.\" ' The grocer's florid face fell. If this were done all his labour would be wasted. He had reckoned that it would not be worth Sir Peter's while to buy the land at the value that would be set on it as building ground. Helen, nar rowly watching his dejection, went on : ' When I heard this I was affected for your sake \u2014 for that of Stilborough, I mean \u2014 for you seemed to have set your heart on getting the factories established, and, of course, that scheme must fall to the ground if the land remains in Sir Peter's possession. However, I have thought"], [207, "FROM HAZELWOOD TO ROYSTER. 195 that you would perhaps like to outbid Sir Peter, and buy the land as a venture of your own ; if so, I shall be happy to lend you the money ; but I need not say this must remain an entire secret between us. Don't forget to send the souchong tea, please. Good afternoon ! ' and before Mr. Pottinger could recover from the bewilderment into which this proposal had plunged him, the footman had jumped up by the coachman's side and her ladyship's landau was gone. That afternoon Amy Carew had not gone to Hazelwood with her sisters, as she had done at the former visit. A headache was the ex cuse she had given, and it was a true one, but she did not state that the headache had been brought on by poring over the wearisome heaps of bills which every day's post had been bring ing, for now some time past ; or that it had been aggravated by a threatened visit from her London milliner, Madame Rogandi. That lady had written to say that she should do herself the pleasure of waiting personally on Miss Carew to arrange for a settlement of her ac count ; and, punctually to the time appointed by her, she drove up in a fly from Stilborough Station. Though married to an Italian, Madame Rogandi was herself an Englishwoman, and a highly respectable one. There was nothing in her of the mincing, h-dropping, ridiculous mil- o 2"], [208, "196 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. liner os yore ; she had been brought up at one of those modern commercial schools, and knew as much about most things as the majority of her customers. She had a villa at Twickenham, and two boys at Cheltenham College, whom she intended to send by-and-by to the Universities. One of her sisters was married to an officer ; her husband (a grave, not a frisky foreigner) was engaged on an historical work, and enjoyed some repute in literary circles ; she had a hun dred connections and friends, by whom she was in a position to obtain the most accurate intel ligence concerning all that went on in society. Not older than three or four-and-thirty, calm and well-dressed, she had perfect manners, and was sharp as a needle. ' I am really sorry, Madame Rogandi, that you should have been put to the trouble of coming from London, sor I am afraid I shall be obliged to send you away empty-handed I have no money,' said Amy, sadly, when the milliner had been shown in. ' I was almost prepared for that answer, Miss,' replied Madame Rogandi, respectfully. ' It was rather to confer with you, than with any hope of carrying away money, that I came down to-day.' ' Will you sit down, please,' said Amy ; ' and may I offer you some refreshment ? Perhaps you would like a glass of wine after your journey ? '"], [209, "FROM HAZELWOOD TO ROYSTER. 197 ' No thank you, Miss, I lunched before starting ; ' and Madame Rogandi sat down. ' You see, Miss, your bills are getting to be very high, and so are your sisters', Mrs. War rener's and Mrs. Hunt's!' ' And they look so much bigger from all being sent in together. Why have you done that?' ' They must have been sent in at some time or other, Miss, and I trust I shall not be found exacting. Mrs. Warrener's and Mrs. Hunt's bills have been running or. for nearly seven years : they gave me nothing whatever on their marriage ' ' Oh, I don't blame you,' said Amy, as if fearing she had given offence. ' I know you have been very obliging \u2014 perhaps too obliging, else I should not have got so deeply into your debt. But I must beg you to give me a little time longer.' ' I will willingly give you more time, Miss, if you can promise me that on any specified day I shall be paid.' ' I do not like to promise,' faltered honest Amy ; ' but I will speak to papa ' ' That will be of no use at all, Miss,' inter rupted Madame Rogandi, rather drily. ' Ex cuse my frankness, but it will be a long while before Sir Peter is in a position to pay the eight thousand pounds that are owing to me.'"], [210, "198 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. ' Eight thousand ! ' echoed Amy, aghast ; ' but I do not owe you anything like that ! ' ' No, Miss, but I am reckoning your bills and your sisters' together, for it is to you that I shall have to look for payment of them all,' said Madame Rogandi. As Amy's agitation was very marked, the milliner took some of the chill off her tone as she proceeded, 'You see, Miss Carew, it is necessary that we should come to an understanding, and that is why I have ap plied to you instead of to your elder sister, Miss Isabel, because I know you manage Royster Hall, and are in the secret of all your father's affairs. Now your embarrassments are very great.' ' Are you sure you do not exaggerate them ?' asked Amy, with a touch of pride. ' I hope I may, Miss, but I doubt it. I am but one among the creditors, and you young ladies appear to owe to jewellers, perfumers, and many more besides. Well, pray consider the posi tion in which tradesmen place themselves by giving credit to young ladies who are not yet of age, such as you. Our only security is your honour.' ' But . . . ' commenced Amy, who was about to make a spirited answer, but the words died within her. She would have given ten years of her life if she could at that minute have paid up all the milliner's claims, and have driven"], [211, "FROM HAZELWOOD TO ROYSTER. 199 her from her presence for evermore. O Debt ! what a tyrant, and how it cows the proudest souls ! 'We possibly do wrong in trusting young ladies without their parents' consent \u2014 that I know,' continued Madame Rogandi, implacably, ' but we generally calculate that in supplying them with articles suitable to their station (though perhaps beyond their present means), we enable them to hold their proper rank in society, and so aid in procuring them a happy establishment. But we expect to be paid in full when our customers marry well ; in the case of Mrs. Warrener and Mrs. Hunt our confi dence was misplaced, for they both married gentlemen without means ; and there is no pros pect, so far as I can see, of their husbands ever being able to pay us. Under the circumstances we might have closed their accounts, but we were not aware then that Sir Peter's affairs were in such a critical condition ; knowing what we do now, our only remaining hope is that you and your two younger sisters, but especially you, Miss Amy, will make better marriages than your elder sisters did.' ' Oh, Madame Rogandi, don't you think that if I had the money I would give it you ! ' cried Amy, blushing scarlet. ' Why do you talk to me in this way ? ' ' It would be very hard sor me to lose eight"], [212, "200 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. thousand pounds, Miss,' replied Madame Ro gandi quietly. ' But you won't lose them,' protested Amy, ready to cry. ' I think that you and your sisters, Miss, will always confess that I have done my utmost to please you. The royal princesses never had their dresses designed and cut with greater care than yours ; indeed, let me say without offence that our house considered it an honour to work for the \" beautiful Misses Carew.\" Why look, Miss, at the dove-coloured silk dress you are wearing now, was there ever anything more perfect in shape ? ' ' I wish I had never worn silk, but only cotton-prints like a housemaid,' said Amy wretchedly. ' You would not have been less pretty or less graceful in cotton prints,' rejoined the mil liner with a smile. ' But that is not to the point, Miss. I am bound to represent to you, that we shall have to take County Court pro ceedings against Captain Warrener and Captain Hunt, unless you can hold out any hope of your being able and willing at some future time to pay your sisters' bills as well as your own.' ' But you talk as if I had only to say the word to call up a rich husband at pleasure,' ex claimed Amy, sinking into an arm chair and hiding the confusion of her face in her hand-"], [213, "FROM HAZELWOOD TO ROYSTER. 201 kerchief. ' Why, nobody has ever yet made me an offer of marriage, I assure you.' ' Oh, Miss, with your face and figure there will be little difficulty in getting you a rich husband, and allow me to say that husbands you marry for love or for money, turn out much the same after the honeymoon,' was the milliner's judicious reply. ' And you see, Miss, there are circumstances when a marriage for money be comes a marriage of honour. Gentlemen when they get into debt are often obliged to start in careers which they dislike. With us women, marriage is the only career, and it is a comfort to reflect that many of us can make our fortunes out of it without much trouble.' ' I think I have borne humiliation enough already, Madame Rogandi,' Amy broke out with a passionate voice and glistening eyes. ' From anybody but yourself I should take these remarks as a miserable insult.' ' You are right not to take them as such from me, Miss Carew, sor of course you bear in mind that I. am addressing a young lady whose family have had eight thousand pounds' worth of my property without paying for it. However, if my observations distress you I have only to apologise, and on my return to town I will proceed against your brothers-in-law in the manner I have indicated.' ' No, no, stop, for pity's sake,' said Amy con-"], [214, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 202 quered. Give me a little more time \u2014 I will consider \u2014 perhaps in a few weeks things will have altered.' ' I will readily give you what time you require, Miss Carew, the moment there is an understanding between us,' answered Madame Rogandi with obliging deference. ' Your word is quite enough for me,' she added, and so the interview terminated. It will readily be imagined that after such a scene, Amy's nerves were unstrung. She felt as if she had been morally trampled under foot ; all her feelings of maidenly modesty and deli cacy were bruised, and she wished herself dead. Yet if a Turkish pasha had then sailed in and made her an offer of his hand she would have thrown herself at his feet and consented to live as the last of his slaves, provided she could have got money to pay all these bills, which had be come a cause of so much misery and degrada tion. Many a girl whom the world taxes with heartlessness and greed because she has made an interested marriage has gone to the altar, bondswoman, as completely as any that was ever led from the slave-market \u2014 ay, bound hand and soot in debts, her own or her family's, more galling than iron fetters. Amy gave vent to her wretchedness in a good cry, and that refreshed her. Fortunately her household duties did not allow of her"], [215, "FROM HAZELWOOD TO ROYSTER. 203 nursing her sorrow long in solitude ; and she bathed her swollen eyes lest her father and sisters, on their return, should notice the traces of tears in them. Then she went down stairs, and, as the afternoon was clear and warm, she thought a turn in the garden among the rose beds would do her good. She had not been engaged long in gathering a nosegay for her father's study-table, when she saw a tall black clad form moving among the trees of the park avenue ; and presently Paul Rushbrand emerged, walking at a thoughtful pace towards the hall. In Amy's then frame of mind the Vicar of Stilborough was of all men the one whom it most solaced her to see. For the last few Sun- days she had derived, without well-knowing why, an unwonted comfort from his sermons, for they were not like the discourses of other and more worldly preachers whom she had been used to hear : there was in them a simplicity of language and a glow of faith which penetrated to the heart and warmed it. She had not spoken to him since the day when they had dined together at Hazelwood, and she had been fearing that some of Sir Peter's strictures as to the part which he had played in the Hartleigh marriage might have come to his ears and led to coldness. This made her the more glad to see him, for it is in hours of trial that we"], [216, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 204 best feel how little we can afford to lose any friend. However, Paul did not advance. He had suddenly branched off from the avenue and gained a mound where he took off his hat and shaded his eyes with his hand to gaze on a view of Stilborough and the surrounding land scape which offered an incomparable panorama from that spot. He stood so long in his con templation that Amy grew impatient, and going round by the garden gate, crossed the park sward and approached him. She coughed once or twice to announce her coming, but he did not hear, and her footfalls were so light on the turf that she stood by his side and accosted him before he turned : ' Good afternoon, Mr. Rushbrand,' said she smiling. ' Good afternoon, \"Miss Amy,' answered he, shaking her proffered hand \u2014 and his quick eye detected that she had been shedding tears \u2014 ' You have been crying, I perceive, I hope you are not poorly ? ' ' No ! ' she answered, marvelling that he should be so observant. ' But we all have our little troubles you know.' ' Little or great ones \u2014 yes,' he said with a sigh. ' I was thinking upon that as I con sidered that fair scenery, and wondered that,"], [217, "FROM HAZELWOOD TO ROYSTER. 205 amidst a world which God has made so beau tiful and pleasant to dwell in, man should do so little sor his own happiness, but should be continually heaping up for himself occasions of sorrow.'"], [218, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 206 CHAPTER XIV. DISPUTATIONS. They walked back side by side. ' Papa and my eldest sisters are out, but they will be home before long,' said Amy. ' They have gone to call on Lady Hartleigh.' ' I am very glad to hear that,' rejoined Paul, who indeed felt and looked gratified. ' Oh, but this is their second visit, as you would have heard had you condescended to call on us before,' rejoined Amy, archly. ' Why is it that you keep so obstinately aloof from us, Mr. Rushbrand ? ' ' You have had races and other festivities here, hardly congenial to my cloth,' he answered smiling. ' And you think races sinful, I presume ? ' Yes.' ' Oh, Mr. Rushbrand, I am surprised at you ! ' exclaimed Amy, smelling her nosegay, and laughing at him over the roses. ' Why I thought that to the pure all things were pure,' and pray what nice things can you mention that"], [219, "DISPUTATIONS. 207 are not prohibited by this canon or that ? Some ban champagne and dancing, others cards and cigars ; I have heard that we mustn't read novels, hunt, bet, go to the theatre, play bil liards \u2014 which I delight in \u2014 or wear jewellery ! What a dreary world it would be if we obeyed this long catalogue of interdictions ! ' ' Do you think the world is dreary to those who cannot hunt, wear jewellery, or drink cham pagne ? ' asked the Vicar mildly. ' I think that the happiest time of my life was when I was a ship's boy, working from dawn till long after dusk, and earning ten shillings a week.' ' Oh, if we are going to discuss the matter seriously I must put on another face,' said she, assuming an air of mock gravity. ' Now tell me I am a very wicked girl for indulging in so many forbidden pleasures.' He laughed and shook his head. He was at heart too much of a sailor still not to appre ciate fun ; and there was no priggishness of sacerdotalism in him to make him convert girlish reparteeing into an occasion sor a sermon. His blue eyes answered Amy's demure glance with a sparkle of playfulness, yet a wonderfully ten der light broke into them as he ejaculated : ' God be praised you are happy, Miss Amy!' To his surprise the bright eyes that gazed into his became dimmed, the lips, half-parted in"], [220, "208 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. mirth, quivered, and Amy burst into tears. Paul turned pale. ' I am really sorry that I should have said anything to pain you,' he observed, bending over her with solicitude, for he fancied that it was his remarks that had wounded her. ' Oh it's nothing \u2014 it will be over in a mi nute,' sobbed Amy, as soon as she could speak. 'Don't mind me, Mr. Rushbrand. I've been like this all day.' With a tact which is the politeness of the heart, Paul remained silent ; but as Amy had dropped her roses, he stooped to pick them up. She still continued to cry, and the very efforts which she made to check her tears, only served to make them flow faster. At last she so far mastered herself as to murmur an apology for her emotion, and essay to explain what had made her yield to it. ' I am very unhappy, Mr. Rushbrand. Poor people sometimes envy us who wear fine dresses and live in great houses. . . . Ah ! if they only knew . . . ' ' Heaven has mercifully distributed sorrow and happiness in equal portions amongst all ranks,' answered Paul, more moved by her dis tress than he could account for. What shadow of evil could it be, he wondered, that was cast ing its gloom over a life so young and fair ? ' Oh, no, we get more than our share of"], [221, "DISPUTATIONS. 209 grief \u2014 more than the poor,' protested Amy. ' The troubles of the poor are never so great but that hard working, or the charity of the rich, can dispel them ; whereas I shall never know happiness any more \u2014 never.' ' Never is a long time,' replied Paul, trying the effect of a little kind railing. ' Please fate, you will live to smile many times over that vow.' ' I don't think it, and I don't deserve it, for a great deal of my trouble comes from my own foolishness. I have reflected lately on many things which never occurred to me before.' ' It is never too late to turn away from any course which we find to have been mistaken,' remarked Paul gravely, 'but I am afraid,' added he, as a thought flashed on him, \u2014 ' I am afraid you are sorrowing for your brother's turf losses, which have become matters of public notoriety.' ' Oh, all my brother's bets are paid,' said Amy, quickly, for she did not wish to let any stranger into the secret of family difficulties. ' Don't try to read my riddle, Mr. Rushbrand, it would be of no use ... So let us change the subject. I see somebody on horseback coming up the avenue.' ' It is Sir Giles Taplow,' said Paul, with an air of vexation. ' So it is,' echoed Amy, whilst a deep blush overspread her cheeks, then suddenly receded and gave way to pallor, accompanied by unusual vol. 1. p"], [222, "210 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. agitation. 'Oh, I hope he won't notice I've been crying. Give me back my flowers, please Mr. Rushbrand ; he would be sure to make some aggravating joke if he saw you carrying a bouquet for me.' Saying this, she hastily slipped her hand kerchief into her pocket, and tried to compose her features, to encounter the leering scrutiny of the baronet. That worthy gentleman was ambling quietly along on a beautiful black cob, whose hind hoofs were closely followed by a thorough-bred and villanous bull-dog. As soon as Sir Giles rode within ear-shot, Amy cried out without any prefatory good-afternoon (for the baronet was one of those persons with whom, somehow, one never thinks of exchanging formal salutations), 'Why, Sir Giles, what have you been doing with Tear'em ? His muz zle is covered with blood ! ' ' Badger-drawing,' grinned the baronet, 'and capital sport we had.' He clumsily dismounted, and passing the bridle through his arm, walked in the avenue's border beside Amy. ' You should have seen that badger, Miss Carew, a sulky brute with teeth like a saw's, but Tear'em drew him three times by the scruff, and would have throttled him the third time, if we hadn't parted 'em, and whipped back badger into the sack.' ' What cruel sport ! ' said Amy in disgust."], [223, "DISPUTATIONS. 211 ' Cruel, egad ! the badgers like it as much as the dogs, don't they, Rushbrand ? ' ' I have never asked them,' replied Paul, ' but I wish, Sir Giles, you would not entice the Stilborough boys away from Sunday school to come and join you in these pastimes of badger baiting and rat-worrying on Sunday afternoons. I hear you encourage these lads to bring you all the rats they can catch.' ' So I do, and I don't suppose you mean to set up as the \"Vermin's Friend,\"' replied Sir Giles, with a coarse laugh ; ' but look'ee, my dear sir, since you keep such a sharp look-out over your boys, I wish you would restrain them from filching in my orchards. If I catch any of the young blackguards in the act, I'll break every bone in their bodies.' ' Some of those boys are strong, and well able to defend themselves, Sir Giles,' answered Paul quietly, though with rising colour \u2014 where upon Amy laughed ; and Sir Giles, whose blus ter was easily quelled by a cool retort, reddened to the ears. He mumbled something about taking his horse round to the stables, and trudged off. As he was disappearing, Amy cast her eyes on the ground and said : ' You don't like Sir Giles, Mr. Rushbrand ? ' ' His back is turned now,' answered Paul, p 2"], [224, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 212 bluntly. ' Anything I have to say about such a person, I should wish said before his face.' Nothing much was spoken after this until they reached the house. Paul and Amy stood for some minutes conversing on indifferent sub jects under the portico of the front entrance ; but before Sir Giles could rejoin them here and risk another wordy war, Sir Peter and his children returned from Hazelwood. There was a great hurrying out of grooms to take charge of the horses which the gentlemen of the party had been riding, and Paul stepped forward to assist the ladies in alighting from the carriage. Mrs. Warrener and Mrs. Hunt seemed very glad to see him, but their politeness was as nothing compared to the civil things \u2014 the de monstrations of esteem and amity with which they loaded Sir Giles, when the latter made his appearance. Paul was shocked to behold two such sensible and charming women bestow so much sycophancy on a being who had positively nothing in his favour but his title and money. On Sir Peter's part there was a shade of reserve in accosting the Vicar, for he suspected the latter of belonging to the hated Pottinger's clique. However, his visit to Hazelwood had been so satisfactory, that he felt in a mood of charity with all mankind, and so invited Paul to stop for dinner. Now Paul had come to Roy ster for the express purpose of trying to act as"], [225, "DISPUTATIONS. 213 mediator between Sir Peter and the corporation of Stilborough. It pained him to see strife growing up between his parishioners and the baronet, and the more so as Mr. Pottinger had furnished him with a very one-sided version of the dispute ; and had led him to believe that Sir Peter was obstinately bent on going to law in order to maintain his right to hold races in defiance of the townspeople. The grocer had neglected to state that the dispute had been narrowed down to the mere alternative as to whether races should be run at Royster or at Hazelwood ; and as Paul was no great reader of newspapers, he had not collected the true facts for himself by perusing the controversy that had been carried on in the local press ; he simply believed that the Corporation had at last awoke to a proper disapproval of the dis orderly scenes to which the races gave rise, and that Sir Peter was, for his own sole interest's sake, obstructing the moral reform to which they were inclined. The argument which Paul purposed to use was that Sir Peter would, in the long run, be a pecuniary gainer if he suffered factories to be erected on ' Stubb's Piece,' for all experience showed that land around factories must eventually increase enormously in value. How little such an argument was likely to touch Sir Peter, who stood in need of present, not of prospective, wealth, the reader knows ;"], [226, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 214 but Paul had selected his little quiverful of syl logisms with lively hope that they might all find their mark; and he was consequently pleased when Sir Peter volunteered to take him for a grand tour round all the apartments of Royster Hall. They were thus alone, and it was with pardonable pride that the old baronet exhibited to his guest the numberless treasures and curiosities of a place which was an excellent specimen of those venerable English mansions which have belonged to the same family for centuries. To the man of literary turn, to the artist, to the thinker, these rambles in old houses are full of charm ; every picture starts a train of thought, dark corridors, quaint tapestry, rusty armour bring many a romantic fancy to birth ; even the old chairs and tables tell their tales of generations of brave men and fair women, of feasters and mourners, long gone to rest, as we must go in our turns. But in men whose childhood has not been spent amidst intellectual surroundings, antiqua rianism is seldom developed ; and in Paul Rush brand especially, this faculty lay wholly torpid. His unsophisticated mind gloried in the gran diose sights of nature \u2014 in roaring seas, bold crags, snow-crowned hills, and smiling meadows, and if amidst the landscapes which he loved he saw some towering castle or stately hall, the view seemed to him all the better for it. But"], [227, "DISPUTATIONS. 215 as to the bric-a-brac with which the hall or castle might be stocked his soul cared nought, and when Sir Peter reverentially touched an old breastplate, remarking that it had been worn by his ancestor at Naseby, the relic stirred no more emotion in the Vicar than if it had been the waistcoat of some modern dunderhead who had gone a-fighting for a wrong cause. How much the romance of history would lose if we brought to bear in our judgment of departed worthies the same critical spirit which we apply to con temporaries ! Happily, time is a potent magni fier, and converts into heroes many whom we should consider dull dogs if they had lived in our own times. ' Yes, sir,' observed Sir Peter, passing his hand caressingly over the battered cuirass. ' We are an old family, and the Corporation would have done a sorry thing if they had succeeded in driving us from the county, as they tried to do.' ' I don't think anybody ever contemplated such a thing as that, Sir Peter,' said Rushbrand, who saw his opportunity and snatched at it ' So far as I understand the only desire of the townspeople is to suppress races which have be come an evil, and to establish factories which would add to the prosperity of the town.' ' You have studied your brief well, I see,' replied the baronet, with forced good humour ;"], [228, "216 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. ' but may I ask how you would like a factory to be set up next door to your vicarage, with a right of way conceded to all the work-people across your flower-beds ? ' ' The value of your property would ultimately be very much enhanced though,' rejoined Paul, who felt this fine argument to be much less strong than he had thought it would be. ' Ah ! and when ? in twenty or forty years' time, when I shall have been long laid to bed in the church vault,' answered Sir Peter; 'but even if I were certain to live on until every square yard were worth a thousand pounds, do you think I could stop simply as a speculation in a place that had been desecrated and rendered uninhabitable ? No, sir, on the day when they get laying down bricks in 'Stubb's field' my young ones and I strike our tents and move elsewhere.' ' That would be an extreme resolution, Sir Peter,' remarked Paul, who thought of Amy going away and never more coming to sit in the pew under his pulpit. ' It would be the only resolution possible,' responded the baronet, 'and as to that race question, I don't see why you should say that the Corporation want to suppress the races when they have only tried to get them removed to Hazelwood. Pray why should the races be less an evil\u2014 if they be an evil \u2014 in Hartleigh's park than in mine ? '"], [229, "DISPUTATIONS. 217 ' I was not aware that there was any talk of holding races at Hazelwood,' answered Paul sincerely astonished. ' Mr. Pottinger told me Sir Peter laughed and laid a hand on the Vicar's shoulder. ' You are young enough to be my son, Rushbrand, so I can give you a bit of advice. Mistrust the man who goes about whining \"abomination\" and \"anathema,\" for the chap is generally playing some snug game of his own, while professing to serve his neighbours. That Pottinger of yours is a cur, and you may tell him so with my compliments.' ' You surprise me by saying that these races were only to be removed,' remarked Paul without noticing this last observation. ' I should have thought Lady Hartleigh would have objected.' ' Objected ! Oh no ; it was she who made the offer of Hartleigh's park sor the purpose. However, I am glad to say we settled all that this afternoon. It will probably cost mea couple of thousand pounds to buy \"Stubb's Piece\"; but at all events the races will remain where they are, and I shan't be driven from the home where my fathers lived and died, and where all my children were born. And so now let's come down to dinner.' Although at the time when he breezily talked"], [230, "218 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. of spending two thousand pounds, Sir Peter was not worth so much as two thousand pence, yet there was no abatement in the sumptuous fare of his board, for men must be actually on their last legs before they think of introducing retrenchment into their kitchens. The fat of this and other lands was in request to supply the smallest repasts spread at Royster Hall, and the richest vintages of France and Spain flowed in profusion whenever there was a guest to en tertain. To Paul Rushbrand, whose favourite way of living was to eat when he was hungry, and then to regale himself off a single dish, with a glass of water, it was a standing wonder how people, ladies especially, could sit down for hours and stuff themselves with dish after dish, swallowing strong drinks in equal propor tion. However, he made as good countenance as possible by the side of Mrs. Hunt, and might have enjoyed both her conversation and the dinner had it not been for the \u2014 to him \u2014 sicken ing attentions which he continued to see \\z.\\ ished on Sir Giles Taplow. These pettings ended by mounting in intoxi cating whiffs to the baronet's head along with the champagne which he was quaffing. Stimu lated by the mirth which hailed his slightest sallies, by the compliments to his drollery which were bestowed on him by all the ladies except Amy, and by some flattering appeals to"], [231, "DISPUTATIONS. 219 his opinion as a sporting authority, which were made him by Captains Warrener and Hunt, Sir Giles proceeded to take the lead in the con versation ; and this produced on Paul's nerves exactly the same effect as if a wild ass had ceaselessly brayed. He remained impassively serious while the rest laughed, and herein com mitted a deplorable solecism in good manners ; for at table a man is bound to be amused with the majority, be the jokester his greatest foe alive. Not only that, but a man must not argue at table, for argument is the death of conver sation ; and it is an understood thing that dinner persiflage, whatever may be the subjects which it assails, must be parried in a tone of pleasantry. Paul soon illustrated the fact that one may be an exemplary Christian and yet an uncouth man of the world, for he allowed himself to be provoked into that horror of horrors (at convivial gatherings) a religious controversy. It was at dessert, and Sir Giles, while cracking his walnuts, had begun to talk about 'pre- Adamite' discoveries, which were just then engrossing the minds of savants. He must have seen that the Vicar's brow darkened during his flippant disquisition on the origin of Creation, but he was glad to revenge himself for the set ting down which he had received in the park. So at last, after declaring that the discoveries of"], [232, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 220 sundry old flints constituted ' a facer ' for theo logists, he added : ' And that book about the Descent of Man, which traces us all up to baboons and frogs, is a wonderful book ; I have just been reading it and shall send my copy to the Mechanic's Institute at Stilborough, for I think the poor should, as well as we, hear both sides of the question.' ' What do you mean by both sides of the question, Sir Giles ? ' asked Paul, in a tone which it cost him an effort to keep steady. ' Do you imply that these discoveries, and this book, can throw the slightest disproof on Divine Creation, or on the existence of God ? ' ' We take the existence of God for granted, but nothing proves it,' answered Sir Giles. ' Everything proves it,' replied Paul, ' you cannot consider any of the works of Nature without having it irrefutably brought home to you.' ' Well, I am open to conviction, but I must warn you that you must find some other argu ment than that old one as to the beauties and harmonies of nature being evidences of a design ing Hand.' ' An old argument you call this, but why has it grown so ? because succeeding ages have found it unanswerable. And let me tell you that even if all the theories in the book which"], [233, "DISPUTATIONS. 221 you mention were scientifically sound \u2014 which I am told they are not \u2014 even if it were demon strated that atoms had combined to form, first the sun, then the earth \u2014 that air working upon earth had produced moisture, that from the moisture the sun had drawn vegetation, and that vegetation had bred animal life \u2014 first the mite, then the newt, the tadpole, the frog, and so on through the ape up to man \u2014 even if all this were proved, I would still ask you who created the first atoms, and the air which vivified them ? for it is not more difficult to account for the creation of the whole universe than for that of these primary particles, and reason must tell you that the Creative Power which produced them was quite as competent to build at once the entire world, which your author contends was evolved out of them by gradual processes.' ' I grant you that,' assented Sir Giles, crack ing another walnut, ' and I suppose your con clusion is that there is no effect without a cause ?' ' Obviously,' rejoined Paul, not perceiving whither he was being led. ' Then who created the Creator ? ' asked Sir Giles. He paused a moment, keenly en joying the perplexity of his antagonist, and resumed : ' Of course you will tell me that the origin of the Creator is a mystery, and so it is, but then all your argument falls to the ground. You undertook to prove the Divinity by a"], [234, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 222 series of logical sequences, and you must not ask us to let you start from an illogical premiss.' ' Oh, this is all too abstruse, and I think we had better abandon religious debating,' gaily exclaimed Mrs. Warrener, coming to the Vicar's rescue, though she evidently considered that Sir Giles had got the better of him. ' Sir Giles has reminded me of the presump tion of essaying to probe with our weak human intellects mysteries which are unsearchable, and which God has intended should remain so,' re marked Paul, humbly ; ' and yet there is one thing I would beg of you,' he added, looking towards the baronet with a saddened but firm glance. ' You are a rich man, sir, a magistrate, and one to whom the poor look for example. I conjure you, as you value the worldly goods which you possess, not to scatter infidelity abroad with a heedless hand. We ministers have a hard task, even with the Bible aiding us, to guide our lowlier brethren, and arm them against tempta tion in their hours of discontent and want ; but what would it be if you succeeded in destroying their faith in an All-seeing God, and their hope of a future recompense ? I envy no man his responsibility who would thus sow the wind to reap the whirlwind ; ' and forgetting that he was not at his own table, Paul rose from his chair. The ladies availed themselves of this opportunity to retire, and Sir Giles moved towards the door"], [235, "DISPUTATIONS. 223 to hold it open for them. (Paul being nearest to the door, it was he who should have per formed this courtesy ; but, as usual, the obliga tion of it had escaped him.)

We must now follow, for a little while, the for tunes of Captain Oswald Carew. He had gone up to London, professedly to make arrangements for the sale of his commis sion, and his sisters had wrung from him a pro mise that he would propose to Lady Ambermere, who had also removed to town. In reality, Sir Peter's heir wished neither to sell out nor to marry, but only to see if some money-making expedient could not be devised to save him from these alternatives, both equally disagree able. His recent scrape had, of course, not cured him of gambling. Exasperated at his ill-luck, he longed only for the opportunity to retrieve it by some new venture, and meantime, like Mr. Micawber, rose daily with the thought that ' something might turn up before night.' Nothing did turn up but duns, who were be coming hourly less accommodating. There are trade clubs in London by means of which the leading west-end shopkeepers inform one another"], [237, "A SOLDIER'S COURTSHIP. 225 of the defaulters on their books, so that a man, or a family ' posted ' at one of these institutions is laid under the ban of the whole fraternity. Had not Oswald fortunately made a winning of 200/. on the St Leger, which supplied him with pocket-money, he would hardly have obtained so much as a pair of gloves on credit. A man's character is like his shadow, which sometimes follows, sometimes precedes, him, and which is now longer, now shorter, than he is. At this moment the character of the Carews was pre ceding them everywhere, and was much shorter than of reason. Sir Peter had written to divers of his influ ential friends, and among them to. the ' whip ' or patronage secretary of the Treasury, begging for his sons and sons-in-law some of those good little appointments which an M.P. who has long voted 'straight' with his party has a right to claim ; but what could Government or lords lieutenant offer that was worth the acceptance of young men nurtured in the lap of best society ? Consulships, colonial commissionerships, gover norships of jails are well enough sor the humble foot linesman, but an officer of the household brigade or of a crack cavalry regiment, obviously derogates when he seeks from out of hard work, amidst uncongenial surroundings, the means to pay his creditors. Philip thought he was setting a Spartan example to his brothers, and pushing vol. 1. Q"], [238, "226 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. condescension to its utmost limits when he con sented to be sent as military attache to a small German court, retaining his regimental rank, and receiving 400/. a year extra salary (a piece of patronage which he owed to his brother Albert in the Foreign Office, and which could only have been ventured on during the Parliamentary recess, when there was no possibility of honour able members putting vexatious questions about it) ; simultaneously, this same brother Albert insinuated himself into the secretaryship of a Royal Commission for inquiring into the opera tion of the Soap Tax, and as he retained his clerkship of 300/., in addition to the salary of 500/., which his secretaryship brought him, he, at least, might be said to have secured butter for his daily bread. But nothing could be found for Captains Warrener and Hunt, which even remotely satisfied the conceptions of what their wives felt to be due to the merits of these dis tinguished officers ; nor could suitable plans be found for the Carew at the War Office, the brief less Carew at the Bar (who turned up his nose at a Barbadoes judgeship), and much less so for Oswald, who, sooth to say, pitched his ambition at emoluments bigger than he could expect out of any salaried appointment lower than that of the Commandership-in-Chief. There was nothing for it, then, after all, but to pay his addresses to Lady Ambermere, and"], [239, "A SOLDIER'S COURTSHIP. 227 he set about this compulsory task in the spirit of a man who sees in matrimony a total loss of liberty, and the extinction of most other earthly joys. Her ladyship had a house at Kensing ton, and as Oswald's regiment, the 2nd Blues, was quartered at Knightsbridge Barracks, he was close at hand to make morning calls ; his situation was also convenient in another respect, for out of his window, which looked on to Rotten Row, he could see when Lady Amber mere was riding, and at the first glimpse of her black mare, order out his own hack, and join her within a few minutes as if by accident. But all these advantages were shared by Os wald's rival and superior, Colonel Pounceforth, who for some time past had been making fre quent and more skilful use of them. The Colonel hated Oswald, and had he been less a gentleman than he was, might have vexed him with all the petty persecutions which it is in the power of a military chief to inflict upon a subordinate. That Oswald should have liked his regiment \u2014 and even liked Pounceforth himself \u2014 was a rare tribute to the latter's worth ; and, indeed, Pounceforth despised all littleness of conduct, as much from pride as from prin ciple. This does not mean that his character was a loveable one ; Oswald was by many times the pleasanter fellow of the two, and except that they were both tall, handsome, and daring, it Q2"], [240, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 228 would not have been easy to find a couple of men more different. Oswald was good-natured to his soldiers, though prompt to swear at them if put out ; Pounceforth never swore, but he was a stringent martinet, whom no speck on a soldier's tunic and no blunder in his drill ever escaped. Oswald was extravagant for himself, and open-handed towards others ; Pounceforth never threw away a penny, and though he was not a curmudgeon, disbursed his money always to advantage, and had no debts. On Oswald's word people could rely to this extent, that, having made a promise, he would really do his utmost to keep it ; Pounceforth never made a promise that he was not absolutely cer tain of being able to keep, and his consequent unwillingness to pledge himself had pretty often been set down as an unamiable trait in his nature. In person, Oswald was light of build, smiling in face, cheerfully cordial with men of his own set, slightly supercilious with those who were not, and every inch a ' Blue.' Pounceforth was seven years older than his rival, and a heavier, showier man, though not stout He had a thin eagle nose, a very luxuriant black moustache, and flowing whiskers. Oswald wore only a moustache, and in his dress, which was always of the most recherche\" mode, he was remarkable for a fine collection of scarf-pins in precious stones, so that it was a joke in the"], [241, "A SOLDIER'S COURTSHIP. 229 mess-room that he sported divers pins for all the changes in the weather, in politics, and in his own mood ; and that, in fact, his wearing of this or that jewel constituted a cryptography which would be deciphered some day by a man having time and patience to study it. To com plete the differences between the two rivals, Oswald cared very little for Lady Ambermere, whereas Pounceforth was deeply in love with her, and treated her money as a secondary con sideration. He would probably have courted her with not less ardour if her income had been ten times less than it was \u2014 that is, if she had had 1,500/. a year, instead of 15,000/. ; but it is not so sure that he would have been anxious to marry her if she had been without a penny, for he was a prudent man, even in love affairs, and felt no inclination to philander in a cot tage. It was only human nature \u2014 and woman nature \u2014 that Lady Ambermere should prefer the man who did not care for her and who was least likely to make her a good husband. She felt this was folly, but could not withstand the aberration that led her towards Oswald \u2014 an aberration like a school-girl's, and which made her worship the very ground on which the young officer trod. Over and over again might Oswald have won her hand for the asking ; and the fact that he should refuse to ask, made her"], [242, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 230 love and esteem him the more, for she knew how embarrassed were his circumstances, and ascribed a good deal of his bashfulness to chi valrous disinterestedness. Colonel Pounceforth suffered for a while from the comparison which this belief suggested ; and even after Oswald had suddenly become more assiduous, Lady Ambermere tried to cajole herself into thinking that it was the Colonel, not Oswald, who was the fortune hunter. However, she was soon obliged to recognise the truth. Oswald had begun his attentions with clumsy suddenness, and rather too much in the style of one who feels that he has the game in his own hand. This piqued the young widow, who thought herself a prize well worth winning for her own sake. Dearly as she loved Oswald she was not going to excuse him the show of passion which a man is bound to make who woos to win, nor would she yield herself to anything like a mercenary suit. She watched with beating heart at first to see whether Carew's addresses were sincere, and when she discerned that they were so, and that she could rebuff him a little without fear of losing him, she revenged herself for his sultan-like behaviour by playing the coquette, and raising high hopes within the bosom of Colonel Pounceforth. This gallant and constant warrior thought himself at length about to attain the goal of his"], [243, "A SOLDIER'S COURTSHIP. 231 wishes. At whatever hour, and no matter how often he might call on Lady Ambermere, he was sure to find her at home ; whereas Oswald was denied admittance if no other visitor were present. The Colonel often saw her ladyship, and sat with her for whole half-hours alone ; Oswald never \u2014 for if Pounceforth, out of polite ness, rose and made a pretence of going when the latter entered, Lady Ambermere would either request him to sit down again, or dismiss them both together. With the Colonel the young widow was lively and confidential ; with Oswald cool and often curt. Though she skil fully contrived to ward off any direct offer of marriage on the Colonel's part, she would appeal to him about the management of the extensive property which the late Lord Amber mere had left her ; but Oswald's advice she never sought or accepted on any matter, even that of dress, and if he expressed a liking for any particular colour, be sure she would avoid wearing that colour on purpose to spite him. Oswald, who partly saw through this play, cursed the capriciousness of women, but perse vered the more in his suit from the obstacles he encountered. He began to think Lady Amber mere rather a desirable little person, and not half so simple as he had imagined. Her pretty house and its appointments \u2014 her brougham and horses \u2014 her smart servants, also found favour in"], [244, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 232 his sight. So that although he was not yet in the way of being reconciled to matrimony, he fell to musing that the thing might, perhaps, be rendered tolerable by a judicious bargaining be forehand as to the amount of liberty that was to be enjoyed on both sides. He chafed at Lady Ambermere's present coquetry as a waste of time ; but he flattered himself that he should be able to bring matters to a climax the first time he found himself quite alone with her lady ship. In this he was right, and had he waited patiently for a little time longer, the opportunity he sought would have been vouchsafed him. It is but a confession of weakness when a woman fears to be left alone with a man, and Lady Ambermere, who knew that she could not find it in her heart to say ' No,' in a tete-a-tete inter view, was only delaying this consummation until Oswald should have been sufficiently drilled into the ways of tender courting. But what must Oswald needs do but preci pitate action and make up his mind to propose in Rotten Row of all places in the world ! Had he been more in love than he was \u2014 or simply more of a roud \u2014 it would have been revealed to him by intuition that a man who proposes in any public place turns all the odds against him self, for he throws away his chance of forcing an assenting answer by encircling the lady's waist"], [245, "A SOLDIER'S COURTSHIP. 233 with his arm, and enabling her to hide her blushes on his shoulder. Women should not be compelled, either, to answer any question by a direct yes or no \u2014 as they are almost bound to do, if supplicated in any place where they cannot give free expression to those glances, sighs, mur murs, and tears which make up half the lan guage of love. Yes, Oswald committed a blunder ; but, to be sure, he had every excuse to attenuate his fault. It was a lovely morning ; Pounceforth was inspecting some recruits in their new clothes, and could not be disengaged for at least another hour ; he, Oswald, was looking his best and felt his best, and he had said to himself that if he saw Lady Ambermere in the Row that morning, now would be the time when he should feel inclined to put his fate to the touch. She did come out, and Oswald somehow fancied he saw her glance towards the barracks in cantering by, as though she wanted him to join her. In five minutes his horse was round, and as he mounted, some brother officers leaned out of the mess-room windows on the ground floor, and chaffed him ; but not about Lady Ambermere, for all save the Colonel were unaware of his aim in this direction. ' A penny for your thoughts, Ossy ? ' ' Who have you put on those yellow gloves for?'"], [246, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 234 ' And he's stuck a pink in his button-hole ! Chuck a roll at him.' ' I'm going coursing,' said Oswald, as he sprang lightly into the saddle. * Coursing what ? ' was the chorussed shout. ' Golden eggs,' he laughed, and turning his bridle, ambled off; whilst his comrades ex changed remarks as to the admirable figure he cut in the. saddle, and as to his being a jolly fellow all round. Right down the Row went Oswald, riding gaily amid desolation, for it was a season of the year when nobody was supposed to be in town, and not more than a score of equestrians could be seen. Lady Ambermere had ridden down to the end of the Row and returned, followed at twenty yards' distance by her groom, in claret coloured livery. Opposite Albert Gate she met Oswald, who had determined to carry off his whole business without sentiment, but merrily, a la hussarde, and so saluted her smiling, ' Mornin', Lady Ambermere. I'm in luck to get you alone for once. You're my prisoner.' ' Where will you take me to ? ' said she, as he wheeled round beside her, to her left ' Anywhere out of Pounceforth's reach.' ' Jealous ? ' said she. ' Don't you think I have reason to be ? You're all smiles and roses to the Colonel \u2014 but"], [247, "A SOLDIER'S COURTSHIP. 235 when I call, you receive me like a dog in a bowling alley.' ' Why don't you stay away then ? ' That's just it. I can't.' ' Magnetic attraction I suppose ? ' ' Something very much like it I assure you.' She laughed and quickened her pace : ' Well, you and the Colonel will be on a footing of equality after to-morrow, for I shall be out of town. I am going into Norfolk to see one of my girl friends married.' ' You won't be away long I hope ? ' ' I don't think I shall be in town again till Christmas ; for after the wedding I am going to stay with some friends in Leicestershire \u2014 then with others in the North.' ' Leicestershire. Ah, that's Pounceforth's county ! I'll be bound he posts down after you.' ' I certainly hope to meet Colonel Pounce forth at times,' answered she demurely. ' Often times,' he remarked pointedly. ' Why not ? ' replied she, with perfect cool ness. They drew in and proceeded at a walk. Lady Ambermere was an excellent horse-woman and sat with graceful ease her pretty black mare fifteen hands high. She did not, indeed, like Oswald's own sisters, seem born for the saddle \u2014 her own best frame being the drawing-room, the dinner-table or her miniature brougham \u2014"], [248, "236 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. but as Oswald scanned her neat figure, her pretty head, and the beaming blue eyes which she occasionally turned on him, he bethought him that so fascinating a tout ensemble was not always to be found in a single day's journey, and was worth struggling for. He did not break the silence, so she broke it : ' And pray what shall you be doing whilst I am away ? No good, I fear.' ' I shall think about you and wish you back.' ' That's pretty, but only a wee-bit true ; you will think of a good many other things \u2014 bets, cards, dissipation of all sorts.' 'And whose fault will that be?' he rejoined, meaningly. ' Why, your own, I presume. Who's else should it be ? ' 'Yours in part. You might make of me the quietest fellow alive if you would take the trouble.' ' I find you quiet enough as it is. It's not your noisiness I complain of,' said she, stooping and patting her horse's neck with her white glove. ' You know what I mean,' answered Oswald. ' You might make me something like what Pounceforth is, if you were only half as nice with me as you are with him.' 'Ah, but I'm nice with Colonel Pounceforth because by your own showing he is better than"], [249, "A SOLDIER'S COURTSHIP. 237 you are. Try to become like him, and I shall be nice with you.' ' How fond you seem of Pounceforth ! ' I like him very much indeed,' she said. ' And you don't like me a bit, eh ? so that if I were to ask any favour of you, you would be sure to say no ? ' ' You seem to be conscious that any favour you would ask would be an unreasonable one,' said she, laughing, but with a heightened colour. ' Depends what you call unreasonable. Sup posing I asked you not to go down to Leices tershire, but to return to town after that Norfolk wedding ? ' ' With what object ? ' ' So that I might see you the oftener, and tell you how fond I am of you \u2014 so that you might get to like me by degrees, perhaps \u2014 and consent one day to marry me ? ' All this he uttered leaning towards her, and speaking in a low beseeching tone. ' Oh, there's a prospect ! ' exclaimed she, blushing outright ; ' but are you in earnest, Captain Carew ? ' ' 'Pon my word I am,' he answered, touching the region of his heart with the head of his riding whip. ' Well, then, supposing I, in my turn prayed you for some favours to prove your regard for me ? ' said she, becoming serious. ' Supposing I"], [250, "238 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. asked you not to bet or touch a card for one whole year from this time ! Supposing I asked you to do something to distinguish yourself and make a woman proud to wear your name. Go out for instance, and join that new fighting ex pedition on the North Indian frontier!' She turned, gazing upon him with a glance full of inquiry, and expecting to see him yield a joyous assent. But to her intense mortification he looked blue. If he had shown the slightest alacrity to undergo the probation, she would willingly have held him quit of the whole after a month's abstention from gambling ; nor would it ever have seriously crossed her mind to let him go and imperil his life in the jungles. But to see him bite his lips and redden, was vexa tion and shame to her, and she could have beaten him as he answered, stammering : \u2014 ' You seem to think me an incorrigible gamester, but I really am not, and to surrender betting and cards would not be to give such a proof of fortitude as you require ; as to the In dian expedition, why, you know, our brigade are not sent out on that kind of service.' ' And couldn't you exchange ? ' asked she, her eyes flashing something like scorn. ' Don't you think \"that kind of service,\" as you con temptuously call it, needs as much bravery as your changing of garrisons between London and Windsor ? '"], [251, "A SOLDIER'S COURTSHIP. 239 ' Well, we have all the risks of railway acci dents and broken legs,' he replied, with well assumed gravity. ' They only risk dying of marsh fever. Is that what you would have me do ? ' ' I would have you display a soldier-like spirit,' she retorted with considerable sharpness, ' and remember, Captain Carew, that when you offer a lady your name, you should try to make the present worth accepting.' He changed colour, but bowed to intimate that he owned the justice of the correction, and the same instant she repented having gone too far. Presently when she became quite cool, she tried to adopt a bantering tone, and to bring back the dialogue to that point where Oswald had made his declaration, but these endeavours altogether failed. Oswald was deeply wounded, and it was all he could do to maintain his com posure whilst he talked upon indifferent subjects. The ride soon became awkward to both, and at Lancaster Gate, Lady Ambermere said she would go home. But as they were about to separate, she looked at Oswald, and, half mad dened at the thought that she might have lost him by her imprudent words, she said, smiling and trying to catch his eye : ' I dare say after all I shall come back to town after my Norfolk visit ; and if you promise to be very good, I will see if I cannot allow you"], [252, "240 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. some of the privileges which you envy your friend the Colonel.' ' Oh, doubtless by the time you return I shall be on my way to India,' he said with a laugh, as he lifted his hat. By his manner of avoiding her glance, she felt that this was a renunciation, and that Os wald would never again ask her to become his wife."], [253, "241 CHAPTER XVI. ' WHEN GREEK MEETS GREEK A good cry as soon as she got home was the indispensable preliminary to all further action ; but after that Lady Ambermere asked herself piteously what she should do ? How could she have been so silly as to say provoking things to a man whom it had been her fondest wish to please, and, alas ! how could he have been so sensitive as to take them in earnest ? She was moved to write him an apology, expressing her frank regret at having pained him ; but it is the misery of women in Lady Ambermere's position that they dare never make an advance without seeming to depart from the proper modesty of their sex. Pride came to her relief at last, and whispered that it was he, forsooth, and not she who should make an apology, as having given the first cause of provocation ; and that, in turn, she had best let him alone, for that men, like women, are most inclined to run after those who do not run after them \u2014 a maxim which may be true in some cases, but is not so in all.

The man who has relied for a supreme ven ture on a last coin and finds it to be a bad one \u2014 the drowning soul in whose grasp the saving cable snaps, experience what Oswald felt on seeing the hopes which he had built on marriage crumble into nothing. But mingling with this feeling there was that angry, humiliated sensa tion known to the sportsman who has counted on achieving a feat most easily, and fails in it. We have seen a champion cricketer, who had gone in to make his three figures off despicably easy bowling, and who was sent out by the first ball, retire from the wickets with such a face as Oswald wore when he returned to barracks and dismounted in the sight of the comrades who had seen him start an hour before, fresh and buoyant as Spring. To make matters worse he felt half in love now that he was spurned. Although morally tingling under the lash of Lady Ambermere's scorn, he could not but think with respect of the little hand that had so smartly trounced him. He lunched off some game pie, with hock and seltzer, and joined in a vigorous tirade of abuse against all women in general, with young Softus, the last arrived sub, whose best feelings were being just then trampled upon by a French"], [255, "' WHEN GREEK MEETS GREEK. . 243 actress. He next strolled out into the riding school to witness the performances of the said broken-hearted Softus upon a new charger ; then returned to the smoking-room, and played at odds and evens for half-crowns with Folli combe, who was confined to barracks by a sprained ankle, obtained in hopping a race over some chairs. He might have wiled away the afternoon in this intellectual companionship, if Pounceforth had not strolled in, and by his presence turned the barb of his recent dis appointment in the wound, and so put him to flight. He hailed a cab, hied him to Jermyn Street, and took a Turkish bath \u2014 one of the most suc cessful methods of killing time yet invented. While melting in the second hot-room, in com pany with two hook-nosed Greek coffee-brokers, a fat man ' doing banting,' and a martyr twisted by rheumatism into the shape of a 3, he had ample time to reflect upon his predicaments, and to laugh within himself at the absurdity of being without means or prospects of any kind. He did laugh, and in a bitter way. This day was the turning point in his existence, for when to morrow's sun rose he must look before him and choose, without trifling, what career he would follow in future. His past life, with all its hopes and opportunities, was gone ; he had been able to make nothing of it \u2014 to spilt milk, burned R 2"], [256, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 244 wood, or broken glass might it be likened \u2014 to anything past repair and past crying sor. ' No man's foes but their own,' is a term that had often been employed by people speaking of Oswald and his brothers ; but they are words full of all that is false and wrong. No man lives to himself or for himself; he must have others depending on him in some way or other, and thus the moment he becomes a foe to him self, he must be a foe to them, and a foe to many too, through his example. The man who injures himself by destroying his own credit or character, or by rendering himself unfit to perform his appointed task in the labour-field of society, works as much harm as if he actually injured his neighbour ; so that, in fact, he who loves himself too little, as well as he who loves himself too much, is, at bottom, a selfish man. It was selfishness that made Oswald so indif ferent to the effects which his extravagant habits might have on his family, to whom he should have been a mainstay instead of an incumbrance. His sisters' jewels had been pawned for his sake, his brothers had pinched themselves, his father had shed tears of despair over his ruinous courses ; but all this did not throw over his mind as much shadow as a flying leaf would cast on a hill-side. He was not intentionally cruel, and would have given his blood freely for"], [257, "1 WHEN GREEK MEETS GREEK. . . 245 many of those whose hearts he wrung ; indeed he valued his useless life so little that it occurred to him as he lay on the hot stone slabs of the Sudarium that if some neighbouring boiler were suddenly to explode and blow him out of life, that would be a satisfactory solution of his diffi culties \u2014 but here, again, was the mere selfishness of a man who wants to throw off his shoulders the burden which it is his duty to carry. Self ishness, moral cowardice, moral indolence, all are one. To Oswald every method of extrica tion from his troubles suggested itself except the right one \u2014 that of putting off the fine clothes sor which he could not pay, and girding up his loins to honest toil. He was bound by so many invisible fibres to this habit of luxury and idle ness, that his only thought was how he might continue in them a little longer, at no matter what future cost ; and he did cudgel his brains so successfully for expedients that, by the time he was in the shampooer's hands, he had plan ned a series of shooting visits to the country seats of rich friends, with the indefinite idea that he should hit upon something to do, or light upon something worth picking up, as he blazed at pheasants in the company of gouty lords, and made himself agreeable to dowager ladies, their lap-dogs, and all belongings. The matri monial venture he did not feel tempted to embark in again, but quien sabe ? Some tender"], [258, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 246 lamb, well clad with golden fleece, might fall under his lupine fang, and if so he would not neglect the spoil. And as Oswald thus made ignoble projects, like a very adventurer as he was becoming, the fat man ' doing banting,' and the tortured gentleman shaped like a 3 envied his youth, bright looks, fine health, and shapely limbs, each reflecting that he would give two thirds of his stowed wealth (and they were rich, both of them) for these treasures, which are not to be bought with money, and of which the possessors always seem so careless. Oswald left the hummum refreshed in body, reinvigorated in mind, and, turning into St. James's Street, sauntered towards his club to take a glass of sherry and bitters. Now, this club of his was Pink's, one of the most select among the select It numbered not more than three hundred members, the flower of the fast portion of the aristocracy, and many were the eligible candidates who had been put up for ballot without success. The special characteristics of the club were, that distin guished foreigners could be admitted to it as honorary members ; and play was allowed ad libitum and on parole, members being not com pelled to produce their stakes in ready money. As much as 20,000/. in cheques had been known to change hands there in the course of an evening ; and after every such ' big night '"], [259, "' WHEN GREEK MEETS GREEK. . 247 some of the quieter members would move the committee to restrict the stakes to such monies as a player might have in his pockets, but they were always over-ruled by the lovers of strong sensations, who formed a majority. There was no one in the reading-room or in the smoking-room when Oswald entered, but he heard voices coming from the direction of the card-room, and went there. The perfume of very mild Polish cigarettes saluted his nostrils as he opened the door, and he descried half-a dozen members grouped round a table and watching the Marquis of Felwood \u2014 the Duke of Lowland's heir \u2014 playing at ecarte with a tall stranger. The young Marquis, who was but just of age, was throwing down the last card of a losing rub, and he pushed back his chair on catching sight of Oswald. ' You're one too many for me to-day, prince,' he said to his adversary, ' but here's a partner who'll hold a hand with you till cock-crow.' ' Hie, Carew, come and give a taste of your quality, and don't be bashful !' cried another voice. ' What's the point ?' inquired Oswald, good humouredly. ' Fivers the point and a ten on the rub,' answered Felwood, 'but you needn't be afraid of ruining your man, he could buy up the lot of us. Here, let me introduce you. \u2014 Prince,"], [260, "248 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. Captain Carew of the 2nd Blues. \u2014 Carew, Prince Karetkine of the Preobajentzki Guards. And now if a thunderbolt were to crash on the pair of you it would make away with a couple of deuced good fellows.' The Russian and the Englishman bowed, liked each other at a glance, and sat down. Oswald was not what is called a first-rate card player ; great betting men seldom are, for the two pursuits, though much alike in their results \u2014 which is ruination \u2014 require different sets of qualities. However, he could play a very fair hand against any man, and at any game. And he possessed the prime virtue of gamblers, an iron nerve which enabled him to maintain un ruffled composure whether he lost or won. In this respect he was more than a match for his rival, who, like very many of his countrymen, was a strange compound of impetuosity and phlegm, of finnikin graces and trooper-like rowdiness, of diplomacy in mien and speech, and of childishness in thought and action. The banks of the Neva send forth to the western capitals many magnificent young nobles, to astonish social chroniclers by their reckless prodigalities and personal charms ; and Prince Nicholas Karetkine was one of these. He was twenty-six years old, six feet high, and some forty inches round the chest. In uniform he must have looked splendid, and he cultivated a"], [261, "' WHEN GREEK MEETS GREEK. . . 249 military appearance by his short cropped hair and tawny moustache with long waxed tips ; but what most struck you in him was his eyes \u2014 large, blue, limpid, and soft as a boy's. His smile was also full of boyish sweetness, and his laugh most frank and ready, so that anyone. who had formed an estimate of him from his physiognomy, without having seen him drink, swear, or gamble, would have set him down for an excellently behaved young man, of the sort in whom maiden aunts delight. Oswald felt in the breast of his coat for his pocket-book, accepted the stakes which the Prince proposed, cut for deal, and in three minutes had lost 45/. In the second game he scored three points to his adversary's five, and lost 20/. ; the third game was love again for the Russian, who scored once more 45/. ; in the fourth game ' four all ' was marked, but Karet kine turned up the king, and 15/. went to swell the total of Oswald's losings. A fifth, a sixth, a ninth game followed, but luck remained steadily in favour of the Russian ; and after little more than an hour's play, Oswald had lost 300/. ' You're off the track to-day,' observed Fel wood, who was watching the game at his elbow, smoking an eighteen-penny cheroot. ' He's too lucky in his love affairs,' remarked somebody, alluding to a well-known proverb."], [262, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 250 ' Egad no ! I know what it is. Why, how can you think of playing against a Russian with an opal about you ?' exclaimed Lord Beaumaris of the Grenadiers, and he pointed to an opal and diamond ring on Oswald's finger. ' Why heigh to be sure, it's a glamour stone in Russia, isn't it ? ' ejaculated Felwood. ' I must have one about me somewhere ; ' and he gravely scrutinised his personal adornments. The Russian smiled one of his innocent smiles, and said in capital English, with scarcely an accent in it : \u2014 ' We consider the opal to be unlucky in my country, and I certainly should not think of wearing one while playing.' Oswald laughingly removed his ring, and handed it to Beaumaris ; and from that moment, by one of those strange coincidences which do so much to perpetuate superstition, fortune veered wholly to his side. All the kings fell to him. Play as Karetkine would, he could not score the point, and game after game was marked to Oswald, who was fast winning back all he had lost. The Russian's excitement rose as he saw luck desert him, and some beads of perspiration broke out on his brow ; he finished by remarking that he should like a glass of ab sinthe, and proposed a suspension. At this moment the balance of winnings showed 25/. in his favour."], [263, "' WHEN GREEK MEETS GREEK. . .' 251 Absinthe was rung for, and as most of the company were not much versed in this drink, Karetkine instructed them in the scientific pre paration of it ; but the brew which he mixed for himself was twice as strong as the others, even as Benjamin's mess exceeded that of his ten brethren. It would have turned any Eng lish head \u2014 to say nothing of firing any English brain \u2014 to have even sipped of the heady bever age which the Russian enjoyably swallowed in large gulps, inhaling between-whiles the fumes of pink-paper cigarettes ; but the Moscovites are mighty quaffers, and of Karetkine it might be said, once and for all, that, if never actually drunk, he was always more or less under the influence of drink. So are the generality of young officers in the Russian Imperial Guards (not in the Line, for there, means being nar rower, morals are staider). They drink brandy before they are out of bed, to drive away the blue-devils attendant upon the preceding night's orgies ; at breakfast they take champagne, with more brandy to follow ; in the afternoon, ab sinthe or vermouth ; in the evening anything or everything ; till, getting drowsy, they have re course to strong glorias (black coffee mixed with kirsch or cognac) to keep them awake till bed-time. The effect of this rdgime is to make them occasionally and wildly quarrelsome with one another, but never so with strangers ; and"], [264, "252 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. it is a long while before it seems to operate prejudicially on their healths. An officer of the Guards will, thanks to the Russian climate, go on for years and years looking much the same ; but at the age of forty he perhaps pricks his finger with a pin, catches a cold, or has an at tack of indigestion, and dies off \u2014 his constitution having suddenly caved in like a house long un dermined by rats. The effect of absinthe on Karetkine was always exhilarating, and so it proved on the others. They were all men of the same set, knowing one another intimately, and knowing the same people ; so they fell to talking and anecdoting in such pleasant wise that dinner time approached, and they voted it a pity that such harmonious company should separate. It was agreed they should dine together at Lim mer's, for cookery is seldom a strong point in small clubs, and the chef at Pink's shone more in the preparation of late hour broiled bones and devils than in that of set dinners. Accord ingly they strolled out in a body to the cosiest of sporting hotels, now no more, and were soon accommodated with a private room, good fare and smart attendance. This served but to accelerate the flow of Karetkine's spirits. He talked a good deal with Oswald, and the more he did so the more he liked him ; Oswald, on his side, was much taken with the Russian's pleasing"], [265, "' WHEN GREEK MEETS GREEK. . . 253 ways, and rather dazzled by his off-hand allu sions to his family estates, hundreds of miles in extent, his myriads of beeves and sheep, and his silver mine in the Oural Mountains. So the dinner was a success, and after des sert and coffee \u2014 that is towards eleven \u2014 the table was cleared for baccarat. But this play was not very brisk somehow, and it chafed the patience of the restless Russian ; who, having now his full freight of liquor on board, craved for stronger sensations. He proposed point blank to Oswald to play 150-point piquet at 10/. the point. Ten pounds the point, i.e. the possibility of losing 1,500/. in one game ! Oswald hesitated, but, being a little ' sprung ' too, consented to play at 5/. the point, but only for a single game. As usual this resolution to stop after one bout did not survive the throw of the first card. Oswald and the Russian continued to play till one by one all the lookers on dropped off and went their ways ; they did not cease even after they found themselves alone, but called for mulled claret, and \u2014 more and more excited both of them \u2014 went on for another two hours. The Russian was the first to cry quarter, for his hands were shaking so that he could hardly hold his cards ; and as the games had been going steadily against him, he declared that there was no contending with his ill-luck, and that he"], [266, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 254 would have his revanche to-morrow. The losses, which had spread all over a sheet of note-paper, were added up ; Karetkine drew out a small cheque book, and with no more concern than if he were writing down an address, signed Oswald a cheque for seventeen thousand, five hundred and five pounds."], [267, "255 CHAPTER XVII. laws and laws of honour. It was three o'clock in the morning when Oswald parted from Karetkine in the moonlight at the door of Long's Hotel, where the Russian was staying, and about midday when he was roughly shaken out of sleep in his bed at barracks. He sat up, rubbing his eyes, and saw Felwood and Beaumaris. ' I say, Ossy, weren't you the last man with Karetkine yesterday or this morning ? ' asked the former, in a broken voice. ' Yes \u2014 why ? ' ' Because the poor fellow is dead ! ' ' Dead ? ' echoed Oswald, incredulously. ' Yes, it's awful ! When his servant went into his room this morning, he found him stark in bed, with an empty bottle of chloral standing on the right table.' ' There's no saying yet whether it's accident or a suicide,' proceeded Beaumaris. ' You don't know whether he had any reason to kill himself ? Who won of you two last night ? '"], [268, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 256 ' I won,' stammered Oswald. ' There's the prince's cheque for seventeen thousand pounds.' The two noblemen examined the cheque, which lay on the table, and their countenances told plainly that they looked upon this as a clue to the mysterious tragedy. Oswald had jumped out of bed, and as he huddled on some clothes his stupefaction increased. Karetkine had shown no sign of distress on parting with him ; he had, on the contrary, made an appointment to come and lunch at the barracks at two o'clock. Of this Oswald was certain, for his own agitation consequent on his large winnings was so great that he had lain for hours conning over the night's events, without being able to procure sleep, and this accounted for his still being in bed at noon. He could not realize the horrible thing that had occurred, but what reasoning power he was able to muster suggested to him that Karetkine must, like himself, have been sleepless, and have taken an overdose of the hypnotic by an inadvertence. ' It could only have been accident, surely ?' he asked, as with a trembling hand he poured water into his basin. ' Egad ! let's hope so,' said Felwood, whose features were quite distorted from inward commotion. ' Such a rich fellow as he was couldn't have been hipped for a sum like this.' ' There's no saying \u2014 the worst of foreigners is that it's impossible to ascertain whether the"], [269, "LAWS AND LAWS OF HONOUR. 257 account they give of themselves is true,' re marked Beaumaris, not less upset. ' They have no \" peerage \" or \" landed gentry \" that you can consult.' ' There'll be a coroner s inquest, and the case will make an awful row,' groaned Felwood, sit ting down and biting his nails. ' Egad \u2014 all our names will be in the papers, and we shall have to say what we were doing all last evening. My governor will swear like a pagan.' ' And I'm afraid everybody will pitch into you, old fellow,' remarked kind-hearted Beau maris, with compassion, to Oswald. ' However, it's not your fault, nor ours. Get dressed as fast as you can, will you, sor we must be off again to the hotel. My trap is downstairs.' Oswald went through summary ablutions, dressed himself in dark clothes, and intimated that he was ready. The three friends descended and left the barracks through the private postern in the Knightsbridge Road, where Lord Beau maris's brougham was standing. It was not a vehicle large enough to contain all three, so the owner climbed on the box. Oswald and Fel wood got inside, and both growing more nervous every moment, scarcely exchanged a word till they reached the hotel. Here confusion and dismay seemed to reign, not only among the proprietor and servants of the establishment, but among the visitors stay- vol. i. s"], [270, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 258 ing in the hotel, all of whom were congregated in the coffee-room, and discussing the event The coroner had been sent for, and had issued his warrant for an inquest and a post-mortem examination on the morrow. A doctor from the Russian Embassy had arrived, and had been trying, with the aid of the English phy sicians first summoned, to restore life, but in vain ; and the Russian Ambassador was ex pected every minute to come and take posses sion of the deceased's effects and papers. Oswald asked permission to view the body, and was conducted with his two friends to one of those unpretending \u2014 almost paltry \u2014 sleeping chambers, which in English hotels \u2014 even the best \u2014 are considered good enough for bache lors ; but which abroad would scarcely be deemed fit for a bagman. Cheap wall-paper, a common drugget carpet, two cane-bottom chairs, and a sponge-bath made up the furniture, along with a four-post bedstead, which occupied more than half the space in the room. The curtains of this bed were closed, but the Prince's weeping French valet, who was keeping watch, drew them aside, and revealed the lifeless form of his master. If sudden death be ever awful it is particu larly so when it strikes those who have been the recent companions of our pleasure-seeking. Death seems to come then as a punisher. In"], [271, "LAWS AND LAWS OF HONOUR. 259 the uncertain light shed by two wax candles (for the room, according to the Greek-Catholic custom, had been darkened), Oswald saw fea- tures illumined by none of the tranquil majesty of repose, but bloated and grimacing \u2014 the fea- tures of a man who has rolled out of this world by a misadventure, drink-besotted. Felwood, who had known the Prince for some weeks, was much affected ; Oswald, having so lately made his acquaintance, could feel no grief, but he thrilled with an indefinable sensation of horror as he reflected that if Karetkine had not met him he might perhaps have been still alive. This thought was so harrowing, that Oswald mechanically cast his eyes about him for a token of any sort that might disprove the theory of suicide. He saw evidences of lavish per- sonal luxuriousness. Ivory-backed brushes and mirrors emblazoned with arms, dressing-case fixtures mounted in pure gold studded with turquoises, a watch whose back was encrusted with diamonds\u2014 all these things and many more, down to the rich sable travelling-rug, thrown over the bed, spoke to the long-accustomed habits of a wealthy man. Nothing in the apart- ment bore the look of dilapidated fortunes, or of anything approaching thereto ; and this was no mean index, for our circumstances are betrayed by many a tell-tale sign in our equipments. Such little solace, however, as Oswald could s 2"], [272, "260 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. derive from outward appearances, was dispelled when the Russian Ambassador arrived, for this exalted personage concluded for felo-de se so soon as he was informed of the 1 7,000/. cheque. His Excellency was a man of most diplomatic mien and of painful politeness. He viewed the corpse, muttered half-a-dozen words of ritual, and made the sign of the cross over it, as though he were, in the name of the Czar, officially pardoning the liberty which a Russian soul had taken to quit a Russian body without Imperial leave. This done, he adjourned to a neighbouring private room, and readily an swered all the questions which Oswald and the two lords put to him. From these answers it ap peared that Prince Nicholas Karetkine was un doubtedly a man of eminent family, but that his goings-on and his prospects at St. Petersburg were much like those of Oswald himself in Lon don. The Karetkines were noble but innumer able, for more than a hundred of them had a right to the title of prince ; they were rich enough, and yet their estates, consisting chiefly of steppe land, yielded no such income as the enormous acreage might lead an Englishman to suppose. In fine, Prince Nicholas probably had an allowance of 10,000/., but he had for the last five or six years been living at a rate quintuple of that; and, though his family would, of course, pay any debts of honour that he might have in-"], [273, "LAWS AND LAWS OF HONOUR. 261 curred, yet it was obvious that this misguided young man had had no moral right to contract debts of any sort, and he had doubtless poisoned himself to shirk the consequences which his fol lies must soon or late have entailed on him. Such was the comfort which the Ambassador brought to Oswald, and some of his remarks having filtered through the ears of hotel waiters into those of press-reporters, the evening papers flourished sensational accounts of an ' Alleged Suicide in High Life through Losses at Cards.' Bad as this was it was made much worse on the morrow, when the morning journals came out. There happened to be no subjects of interest before the public at that moment, and it was the dull season of the year, when editors, finding it no easy matter to fill their sheets, can afford to give whole columns to matters of comparatively slight import. Of this faculty, on the present occasion, they made unstinted use : not only very lengthy reports, but leading articles were printed ; and a unanimous hope was expressed ' that the high rank of the par ties supposed to be concerned in this melan choly affair would not be suffered to stand in the way of the strictest investigation.' One popular journal went so far as to state that all society was interested in the exposure of men who could deliberately wile a stranger into"], [274, "262 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. their company and win 17,500/. of him in a night. Has it ever struck the cultured pharisees who admonish us through newspapers that when men of position come under the hand of the Law or of public opinion they have much less chance of getting fair play, than poorer ones ? The very fear of seeming to be partial renders the Judge harsh and the public pitiless. Moreover, underlying the popular clamour for investigation which arises whenever anything unfortunate has taken place in high circles, there lurks an itching curiosity, on the part of vulgar people, to peer into the private lives of persons above them. The love of justice has nothing in common with such a trumpery sentiment. It is ignorant, often persistent inquisitiveness, the gratification of which has no other effect than to beget a secret envy of practices, which hypo crisy, with a screaming tongue, affects to con demn. The Coroner who was to conduct the in quiry into the causes of Prince Karetkine's death was a fussy personage, imbued to the full with all the ethics of cheap newspapers. He saw in this calamity an occasion for asserting himself before the world as a man who would do justice without fear or favour ; and he pre pared to make things hot sor Captain Carew and the other gay young fellows of Pink's."], [275, "LAWS AND LAWS OF HONOUR. 263 Oswald had written to Sir Peter to give him a statement of the unhappy affair. Beaumaris and Felwood had also written to their respec tive fathers ; and all three met at Long's, at the hour of the inquest, clad in mourning and look ing wretched \u2014 Felwood much like a school-boy fearing manual correction from his parent for his share in the transaction. The jury having viewed the body, were led into the largest available sitting-room, which was already three parts filled with solicitors, reporters, and dis tinguished persons, come to watch the proceed ings. The Coroner himself at the head of the table, the jurymen settled round it, and the three physicians who had held the post-mortem then successively entered and deposed. All were decidedly of opinion that the death was simply due to inadvertence, and they explained this by saying that the bottle of chloral, when full, could only have contained a potion of twelve grains, which, under ordinary circum stances, would not have been enough to kill the prince. He had been in the habit of taking chloral when unable to sleep, and his doses had often been as high as six grains. Probably he had swallowed this last fatal dose in the dark, without noticing how much he took \u2014 perhaps, however, he had deliberately doubled his ordinary dose in the hope of obtaining a quicker and sounder sleep than usual ; and,"], [276, "264 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. indeed, death would not have resulted had it not been for the quantity of alcohol with which the stomach was charged. This alcohol it was which, increasing the normal force of the chloral, had, as much as the drug itself, tended to pro duce death. Cross-examined as to whether the absorption of a large quantity of alcoholic liquor did not tend to drowsiness, and so ren dered recourse to hypnotics unnecessary, all three doctors stated that great restlessness was often the result of partial intoxication, and that under the influence of such restlessness a man would be naturally tempted to seek relief in opiates or narcotics. The crestfallen proprietor of Limmer's was next called to put in, as evidence, the bill for the last dinner of which the deceased had partaken ; and then the Russian Ambassador volunteered as a witness, not for the purpose of confirming what he had said to Oswald and the two lords, but in order to swear just the contrary. The fact is that his Excellency would say privately to noblemen, his equals, things which he would not care to repeat before a parcel of tradesmen. Speaking officially it was his business to vindi cate a member of the Russian aristocracy, who had held a commission in the body-guard of his Sovereign ; so he gravely gave Prince Nicholas a high character for moral principles, and smiled at the notion that such a distin-"], [277, "LA WS AND LA WS OF HONOUR. 265 guished person could have made away with him self for a paltry debt of 1 7,000/. ' Why,' said he quietly, ' Prince Karetkine, his father, has three hundred thousand heads of cattle, fifty thousand acres of corn -land,1 and pasture-lands which it would take a horseman a full week to cross.' (Sensation among the jury.) Questioned by a mild juryman (who was very anxious to hear the sound of his own voice addressing an am bassador), as to the stakes for which it was usual for Russian noblemen to play at cards, his Excellency answered, with exquisite courtesy, that he had seen gentlemen play sor twenty, thirty, forty thousand pounds. Once, in the pre-emancipation days, he had been present at a game where a Boyard had played twenty thousand serfs, the populations of fifteen vil lages, and lost them The mild juryman collapsed. The ambassador, actuated by the freema sonry which binds the aristocracies of all countries to one another, had done his best for Oswald Carew and his friends, and it was evi dent that now no verdict of suicide could be returned ; but this did not satisfy the Coroner, who was not going to be baulked of making an impressive little speech on the vice of gambling, 1 There are whole districts of Southern Russia where the wheat crops are left for year after year to rot, there being no sale for them, owing to the lack of railways."], [278, "266 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. the which all the papers would quote with laud atory comments. Oswald was requested to stand forward, and as he was removing his black glove to be sworn, the Coroner studied the bill from Limmer's, and stroked his chin with a consequential air. ' Captain Carew,' said he, ' we may take it sor granted that you won of the deceased noble man seventeen thousand, five hundred and odd pounds at a sitting, eh ? . . . Yes, that's a set tled thing. Well, may I ask you now whether it is true that on a late occasion, at the Stil borough meeting, you lost very nearly the same amount on one race ? ' ' I object to that question,' interrupted the family solicitor of the Carews, who was present. ' I cannot see what relevancy it has to this case.' ' The relevancy will appear presently \u2014 all in good time,' responded the Coroner. ' I will not press the question if you do not like it, but, I must tell the gentlemen of the jury that a copy of a sporting paper, some weeks old, has been handed me, which states Captain Carew's losings by bets to have been over 16,000/.' ' I hope that paper has not neglected to add that the bets have all been paid,' said Oswald. ' The bets have been paid, oh yes,' conceded the Coroner, magnanimously, and he waved down with his hand the family solicitor, who"], [279, "LAWS AND LAWS OF HONOUR. 267 had started to his legs again. ' But we will leave that subject for the present. May I ask you, Captain Carew, how many there were present at the dinner at Limmer's Hotel ? ' ' We were six in all,' answered Oswald. ' Six in all. Well, gentlemen of the jury, allow me to call your attention to the following wine-items in this bill for six persons : \" 2 bot tles of Madeira, 6 of Roederer's champagne, 2 of Hermitage Burgundy, 2 of 30-year port, 4 of Chateau Lafitte claret, and 2 jugs of mulled claret \u2014 not counting liqueurs \u2014 which makes a wine bill of 190 shillings \u2014 nine pounds, ten.\" Pretty well that is for six persons, is it not ? ' The jury laughed and Oswald smiled ; but the Coroner frowned, and looked as solemn as Minos. ' Well, sir,' he repeated, ' don't you think 190 shillings' worth of wine is a pretty good quantity sor six persons ? ' ' It would be, no doubt, if we had drank it all,' replied Oswald. ' But you didn't drink it all ? You had high priced wines uncorked for the mere pleasure of the thing I suppose ? ' ' A great deal of wine is often wasted at these dinners \u2014 the number of bottles required being left to the discretion of the waiters,' said Oswald. ' However, I acknowledge we did drink a fair amount'"], [280, "268 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. ' The doctors say in their evidence that the deceased was intoxicated.' ' He certainly took more than any of us,' re plied Oswald, unguardedly. ' And how long had you known the deceased when you began playing these games of cards ? ' ' I had been introduced to him the same day.' ' And I believe you remained two hours in his company after your friends had retired ? ' ' About two hours I think.' ' Well then, Captain Carew, we may take it from your own lips that you did not scruple to win seventeen thousand pounds of a drunken man, who was almost a stranger to you, there being no witnesses by you at the time ? ' The solicitor, who had seen but too late the trap into which his client was being drawn, rose up and protested. Oswald, first recoiling as if he had been stung, drew himself up with an ingenuous blush, that would have cleared him before any committee of gentlemen, and asked firmly : ' What do you insinuate by that, Mr. Co roner ? ' ' I mean, sir, that you took a very expe ditious means of winning back the money you had lost at Stilborough,' retorted the Coroner, with coarseness. ' That is an imputation which all who know me will despise as I do,' exclaimed Oswald,"], [281, "LAWS AND LAWS OF HONOUR. 269 with warmth, evoking by his words hearty ' Hear, hears ' from Felwood, Beaumaris, some other lords, a crowd of his brother officers, and all the Carews, his brothers, who had somehow jammed their way into the room. ' The truth is,' added he, forgetting that he was not speak ing solely to the ears of those sympathisers, but to those of the many-tongued blatant press, \u2014 ' the truth is, I am afraid that towards the latter part of our play at least, I was a little the worse too for the mixture of wines we had been taking. We were both excited and played wildly. I had no conception of how much I had been winning, and when the scores were added up, the large total was quite a surprise to me.' ' Quite a pleasant surprise, I should think,' sneered the coroner. * You seem to have had presence of mind enough though to see that you got your cheque properly signed.' ' That proper signing would prove rather presence of mind on the part of him who signed it,' rejoined Oswald, calmly. ' Here is the cheque, and I hope it has entered nobody's mind that after the prince's death I could have the least intention of presenting it for payment' Saying which he tore it up, and threw the pieces on the floor. A murmur of approbation was heard, which the coroner at once essayed to damp by remarking \u2014 ' You are yielding, sir, to the constraint of"], [282, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 270 public opinion, which, as you know, would not sanction your retention of what I have no scru ple to call ill-gotten gain. It remains none the less true that if Prince Karetkine had not been led by you and your friends to this extravagant dinner \u2014 if he had not remained playing and drinking with you until such a preposterous hour of the night, he would not have been dead at this moment' The jury did not relish all the coroner's con clusions, and returned a verdict of accidental self-poisoning ; but, for all this, Oswald left the court under a cloud. He was not immediately made conscious of this, for his friends pressed round him, extending their hands, and warmly blaming the coroner sor his unmannerly asper sions ; but, on the morrow, all the respectable journals took the coroner's view \u2014 so did nume rous persons who were regarded as arbiters of the social code of honour \u2014 so, again, did most ladies, and thus it soon came to pass that many of Oswald's supporters, being indoctrinated by their mothers and sisters, began to acknowledge that the winning of 1 7,000/. from a tipsy Rus sian did wear a bad look. Oswald was assailed by a gale of reprobation all the stiffer, as it was fanned by that mass of quidnuncs, club-oracles, and tea-table mentors, who, whenever any debate on a point of honour arises range themselves loudly and ostentatiously on the side of the"], [283, "LAWS AND LAWS OF HONOUR. 271 strictest points, so as not to let it be supposed that their sense of honour is blunter than other men's. It was in vain that Oswald's regimental comrades and fellow-members of Pink's stood by him ; a man's character is not made by his friends, nor can the multitude of them always save him. Colonel Pounceforth, yielding to no petty feeling of personal animosity, but conscientiously believing that Oswald had grossly misbehaved himself, suspended him from duty until the good pleasure of the Horse Guards should be ascer tained ; but the Horse Guards did not wait for the Colonel's application. Oswald received pe remptory intimation that he must send in his papers \u2014 which, under the circumstances, was tantamount to cashiering him with disgrace."], [284, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 272 CHAPTER XVIII. BOOTS. Misfortunes hunt in packs. Oswald, having been, as it were, expelled the Army, the appoint ment of his brother Philip to the military attache ship (which had been on the very eve of being gazetted) was withdrawn ; so was Albert Carew's nomination to the secretaryship of the Soap Tax Commission. Both young men were told that it was for their own interests that their names should not appear in print just then. These blows fell upon their father at the moment when he was bowed down by the definite victory of Mr. Pottinger in the matter of ' Stubb's Piece.' That much disputed patch of earth had been put up for auction, and Sir Peter's agent had bid twice, three times as much as it was worth ; but another agent was there, who was afterwards ascertained to have acted for Mr. Pottinger, and who showed a resolve to outbid at any price. Sir Peter's agent, thinking that the person was only the hireling of the Corporation, forcing the sale so as to obtain sor the ground a sum absurdly"], [285, "BOOTS. 273 in excess of its value, abandoned the competi tion in disgust; so Mr. Pottinger had the land knocked down to him for 7,500/., and by the same stroke ruined Sir Peter. It has been well remarked that when our spirits are still buoyant, though temporarily lowered ; when our hopes are still bright, though momentarily dimmed ; we dwell on our woes and talk of the luxury of grief; but when sorrow upon sorrow has weighed our spirits to the earth, and all their buoyancy is gone ; when the bright ness of hope is departed ; when our tears have all been shed, and a woe has come upon us that no weeping can assuage, then do we feel that grief is not a luxury, that memory is not a joy. Then, shrinking with a tortured brain from the fear of fresh infliction, we pray for power to endure ; and yet, feeling all the anguish of endurance, apply to occupation which may leave us little time to remember, if it give us not a fresh pursuit on which to spend our energies instead of wasting them in grief. Sir Peter Carew had not been accustomed to bear trouble, and when he had wept all the tears that his heart would yield, his hopeless misery made him frantic. For several days he stamped about the house, rageful, unreasonable, and seeking sor objects on which to vent his wrath. His children were afraid to approach him. As post after post brought tradesmen's vol. I. T"], [286, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 274 letters which, now, were no longer respectful, but insolent, and even menacing, he relieved his mind by entering into a fiery correspondence with his solicitor \u2014 stating that he was being imposed upon, that he would resist all these swindling claims in a law-court, especially those made for goods supplied to his children during their minorities. Credit to minors, indeed ! who ever heard of such an outrageous thing ? and the solicitor commended these sayings, reiterating in letters that cost 13^. 4d. apiece, that neither County Court nor Common Pleas would uphold any claims pn minors. It was at this period that a project shaped itself in the Baronet's mind, and was hourly proclaimed by him in complacent terms, as if the idea of it refreshed him, of walk ing into Stilborough, and publicly tweaking Mr. Pottinger by the nose. In all this cruel juncture, the brunt of Sir Peter's choler was borne by Amy, who, alone among his children, never shunned his society. While the other sons and daughters would scamper away like hares on hearing their father's footsteps in a passage, and would con trive every pretext not to meet 'him at meal times, she was always at her post to bear him company, and give him the truest solace for grief, by enduring his reproaches with patience. He was aware of the soothing effect which her sweet presence had upon him \u2014 for his state"], [287, "BOOTS. 275 would have been woeful indeed without it \u2014 yet he never bestowed on her any but hard words, and took her poor, comparatively innocent, debts for the burden of his most frequent objurgations. Had he not always been a generous father ? had she ever known him refuse a single thing that pleased her whim ? why, then, had she joined with all the rest in adding to his em barrassments, and not left him the comfort of feeling that one at least amongst his children was good and dutiful ? Amy had other sorrows to bear besides these scoldings, for her married sisters were now continually goading her to be more amiable with Sir Giles Taplow, who, albeit he had not yet proposed, had of late carried his addresses so far that he could hardly, with any decency, retreat. Amy was amiable enough with him, Heaven knows ; but, oh the wretchedness of these incessant visits from a man whose manners and conversation became more and more re pulsive the more she grew familiar with them. If only she could have discerned in them a single noble quality, this might have redeemed him. The bed of clay in which a solitary diamond is found, passes for a rich soil ; so when a woman is trying to esteem a man, will the glitter of one small virtue argue the possi bility of many others lurking hidden. But Sir Giles's nature possessed nothing which the most T 2"], [288, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 276 patient seeker, having unearthed, could prize as a treasure. He had ordered a new shooting coat, and had his hair cut in Amy's honour ; and his method of making love to her was to gossip evil about all the people with whom they were both acquainted. This he varied with disquisi tions upon his horses and dogs \u2014 how this mare was off her feed and wanted purging ; how he meant to cross his bull-dog's breed with Farmer Dobbs's terrier bitch \u2014 and other kindred topics suitable to a ladylike girl's ears. But he en tertained no doubt that his discourse was instructive and amusing, or that it was listened to with interest. One day he brought Amy a present \u2014 a bull-pup, six weeks old, who had already killed and eaten a mouse, and whom he pulled out of his pocket by the tail. Hide ous as the growling little brute was, Amy's heart warmed to it with a kind of eager ness at rescuing it from the clutches of such a master, and it became her attached pet from that day. However, a moment did come at last when Sir Giles Taplow seemed to behave like a man and a gentleman. He continued to pay his court after Oswald's disgrace as he had done before it, nor did he breathe a syllable indicating that he had the remotest participation in the bad opinion that was being everywhere ex-"], [289, "BOOTS. 277 pressed respecting the heir of the Carews. This reserve let many of Sir Giles's acquaintances into the secret of his attachment for Amy, sor it was the first time this gallant heart had abstained from kicking a man who was down. But he was not quite a free agent. He knew that he had gone so far with Amy as to be in danger of being called to account by her brothers, or by those two valiant and vigilant Captains, Warrener and Hunt, if he put any slight on her ; and this being so, it was but common prudence and policy to speak of his future wife's relatives as he would have them spoken of by others. It no doubt cost him an effort to bridle his ill-natured tongue, but he would have done even more for Amy's sake, seeing that he loved her with a sensuous ad miration for her beauty, a selfish covetousness of her goodness, sweetness, and domestic qualities, and, that in fact, he wanted just such a wife to be his slave at Taplow Court, and would have no other. But he made sturdy vows to himself, that once married he would keep a tight knot on his purse-strings, and not loosen them, even, if by refusing to do so, he was the cause that all his wife's whole family went to the Bankruptcy Court in the same 'bus. Amy ascribed his fidelity to higher motives ; and seeing him ready to brave public opinion for her sake, felt the less compunction in sacri-"], [290, "278 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. ficing herself for his. This flow of gratitude on her part towards the man who was ready to stand by her and hers in misfortune, was the one bright incident in a courtship which had been dreary beyond compare. For, indeed, Amy could cherish no illusions as to the extent of the disgrace which Oswald had brought on himself and his family, seeing that even his brothers, when there was no stranger present, blamed the ' clumsy ' way in which he had acted. To her, therefore, who freely acquitted Oswald of everything which others laid to his charge, clumsiness included, it was the greater relief and pride to see that Sir Giles appeared to share her sentiments and, thought not a pin the worse of Oswald since his trouble than prior to it. So the wooing proceeded, and it was on a Sunday afternoon that it became patent matters were coming to a head between the pair, and that Sir Giles intended to propose. He had come to luncheon in a glossy frock-coat, in dark blue scarf with a gold fox-head pin, and new dogskin gloves of a flaming brick colour. His reddish beard had a suspicion of oil in it. It is not sure that his handkerchief was not perfumed. He gazed with stolid fixity at the meats, but scarcely partook of them. He spoke little, and drank much less than usual. Everybody divined there was something in the wind, and felt"], [291, "BOOTS. 279 uneasy, as if that something was chilly. Amy, who could not but guess, too, felt as any girl must feel who is about to be asked to pledge herself for life to a man whom she does not love. She was pale \u2014 save when Sir Giles's eyes lighted on her, then she turned crimson \u2014 and she wished that anything on earth might happen to delay the consummation yet one or two days longer. Luncheon over, Sir Peter, who was unwell, and had complained of draughts during the meal (there were none, but these were almost the only words he had spoken from first to last), retired to his study for a nap. Amy, glancing at the clock, remarked that it was her turn to take an afternoon class at the Stilborough Sun day School, and asked if any of her sisters would accompany her. Mrs. Warrener and Mrs. Hunt would have been delighted, said they, but they had letters to write ; Isabel and Georgina were, in the same breath, declared to be not quite well, and would stay at home in case visitors called ; Jack, the only brother staying in the house, consequently volunteered to escort his sister, and Sir Giles said he would go too, to see the children put through their religious facings. But it is probable that Jack received private instructions from his elder sis ters, for no sooner had the three walked a hun dred yards across the park, than he muttered"], [292, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 280 something about having forgotten his handker chief and going back for it. He requested Amy and the Baronet to walk on, and said he would overtake them. Now Sir Giles had rehearsed a little set preamble which he meant to deliver immediately he should be left alone with Amy. It began thus : ' H'm ! do you know I've been spending my morning in a queer way : I've been trying to choose among patterns for new drawing room curtains ' \u2014 and this, for an entree en matiere, as the French term it, would not have been bad, for it would have led up to the obser vation that curtain-choosing was lady's work. Did Amy understand curtains ? \u2014 did she think she could be persuaded to take an interest in these particular curtains ? \u2014 and in the room where they were to hang ? \u2014 and in the house that contained that room ? &c, &c. ; until the owner of curtains, room, and house finally intro duced himself as a suppliant for interest too. Unfortunately, Sir Giles was prevented from delivering even the first phrase of this exor dium, owing to distressing circumstances. He was wearing new boots, and these boots were tight ! No man can be sprightly, tender, eloquent, insinuating in tight boots. Let the doubter try. Sir Giles had, whilst Amy was putting on her bonnet, sat near the fire and toasted his soles"], [293, "BOOTS. 281 reflectively in the fender, till the leather of these boots had shrunk and hardened as if it were converted into tin \u2014 stiff, angular tin, with the angles all inside, and pressing on the ten derest parts of the feet. This occasioned the wearer excruciating agony when he began to walk on a pebbly path. His progress was a hobble ; his face puckered itself up into an ex pression betokening that if a lady had not been present he might have used strong language about his shoemaker. Amy could not ignore the predicament. She had started at a quick pace and with beating heart, to make the jour ney as short as possible ; but her companion dropped astern, he ended by halting altogether, and Amy was obliged to turn. Sir Giles was leaning on his umbrella, a picture of pain, trying to look jolly. ' It's these blessed boots,' said he, with a wry attempt at a smile. After this window curtains and matrimony receded perforce into the background, and the dialogue took a shoe-leathery turn. Sir Giles was not suffering from tight boots \u2014 he hastened to say \u2014 what caused him pain was a bruise where a colt, whom he had been breaking in the other day, had trodden on his foot, just be low the instep \u2014 'just here you see.' Amy knew, she said, that Sir Giles was very brave with horses, but she counselled him to be more care-"], [294, "282 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. ful with colts. Sir Giles (modestly) thought that as a fact few men could hold a candle to him in throwing a leg over a restive bit of horse-flesh. Had Amy noticed the little tit he was riding the other day when that parson fel low was here ? ' Your black cob ?' asked Amy. ' Yes, the black cob : well, by Jove, the first time I got astride him, he flew with me slap at a lamp-post ; if I had been riding him with the snaffle only I was as dead as King John ' \u2014 'Oh!' \u2014 from Amy. 'Fact,' avouched Sir Giles; ' and what should you have said if you had heard of my being dead, Miss Amy ? ' ' Least said, soonest mended, Sir Giles,' was Amy's adroit answer. ' What, shouldn't you have cared more than that ? ' inquired the Baronet ; and thus, after all, the conversation was gliding on to a sentimental incline, when a turn in the road brought Stilborough steeple into view. It occurred to Sir Giles that if he were to indulge in amorous speeches now he should not have time to finish before the porch were reached ; for, though he and Amy were walking idowly, the distance between Royster and the town was not far. Better, thought he, defer proposals till after church, and have the thing out plea santly under the trees of the park, coming back. The main requisite to him for the moment was to sit down and rest, so that his boots might cool and resume their elasticity."], [295, "BOOTS. 283 Rest proved all the easier to procure, as it turned out that Amy and her companion had altogether miscalculated the time, and had ar rived much later than they expected. The clock at the Hall must have been out of reckon ing, and Sir Giles's lameness must have doubled the expenditure of minutes on the road ; any how, the Sunday school was well-nigh ended, and the first bell was ringing for service when they came to the porch. This, though dis appointing to Amy, suited the book of Sir Giles, for it relieved him from the necessity of pacing about on the pavement till the church doors were opened. He and Amy parted in the nave, she going to sit among the little people whom she ought to have been teaching for the past hour, he limping his way towards Sir Peter Carew's pew. This pew was a gigantic strong hold of the old fashion, with high oak walls and red curtains ; the only such one that had with stood the innovations of the late Vicar, who had cut down all the others to modern dimen sions. It stood immediately under the pulpit. Now, sitting here alone and invisible, Sir Giles mused upon his boots. They were not cooling so fast as he could have wished, not by any means. The First Lesson was already being read and it was evident that, unless the process of refrigeration were artificially accele rated, his feet would be as tightly pinched by-"], [296, "284 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. and-by as now. What if he were to give the boots fairer play by taking them off ? . . . They would then have the benefit of fresh air, and in such a tank as the pew was, it would be easy to put them on again after service, unseen. From the conception of this facile plan to its execution, needed no more time than was required for Sir Giles to set both hands firmly on the ledge of the seat on either side of him and give himself a purchase. He then raised his left leg, and, applying to its heel the toe of his right foot, tugged hard as at a bootjack ; but, the leather being so new and slippery, the heel parted swiftly from the toe and darted back on the operator's right shin with all the force of a sounding kick. A monosyllable, rhyming audibly with lamb, exploded forthwith. The Baronet stooped to rub his bruised limb ; but in a minute, recommenced by reversing the ex periment \u2014 that is, by resting the right heel upon the left toe. This time the boots flew asunder as before, but the battering power of the re leased heel spent itself upon Sir Giles's hat, standing under the pew seat, and made a noise loud enough to cause every worshipper in church to prick up his ears. Sir Giles remained mum a moment, and despondingly decided for taking off his boots in the most natural way with his hands. Unfortunately, nature, in fashion ing him so fat, had not intended that he should"], [297, "BOOTS 285 remove new boots without mechanical assist ance. It was only with the utmost tugging, perspiring, and gasping, that he succeeded in wrenching off the left boot, but the right one would not be dislodged on any terms. Sir Giles burst off the two hind buttons of his pan taloons in the retching effort to bend himself double ; he hurt his hands and tore his gloves ; the blood had flowed to his head in such a hot tide that he thought he should break a blood vessel ; but it was of not the slightest use, for all he did was to shift the boot into some sort of diagonal position, much more discomforting than at first, his heel being partially raised inside, and jammed against a crease made by his efforts to stamp the foot down into its original location. Here was a fix ! and, to make matters worse, the Baronet, as he dropped his arms by his side, and raised his glance with the woe-begone air of a man who feels himself baffled, perceived that he was distinctly visible from the raised desk of the parish clerk on the other side of the nave, and that this functionary had been observing his little games with the eye of astonishment and horror. 1 Con \u2014 found the boots ! ' muttered Sir Giles, and he hastily elaborated a new resolution. He would put on his left boot again as he best could, and, pressing a handkerchief against his face to make the congregation believe he was"], [298, "286 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. suffering from nasal hemorrhage, he would hob ble out of church through the vestry (which was the shortest cut), walk thence across the road to the Red Lion, hire a trap and drive off home to put on other boots. Taplow Court was but three miles distant, and by driving hard he should be able to get there and back within an hour, which was the time that would probably be needed to finish the service with the sermon. This he did ; and if ever girl felt a relief at obtaining a day's respite from a dreaded fate, it was Amy, when she saw him vanish through the vestry door, and hoped she should not see him again till the morrow."], [299, "287 CHAPTER XIX. A SERMON ON MARRIAGE. A vestry is a private room, and Sir Giles had no actual business to cross it in order to abridge his via dolorosa ; but this consideration did not trouble him ; nor did he scruple to borrow the Vicar's waterproof mackintosh when he found it was raining. The sky had been cloudy all day, and the rain now falling was a misty drizzle, with wind, of the kind against which an um brella in a dog-cart offers no protection. Sir Giles had more affection for his new coat than for his new boots and did not wish it spoiled ; he unhooked the mackintosh from a peg, where it was hanging in contiguity to last week's sur plice for Monday's wash, and found it wrapped him up most comfortably. He looked like a cabman in it His departure had ruffled the mind of the clerk, to whom his presence in church was not a familiar sight, and who struggled to compre hend why a gentleman should come into church for the purpose of trying to take off his boots,"], [300, "288 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. and, having failed, dart out again without say ing ' with your leave 'or 'by your leave.' The unravelling of such a problem was too intricate work for the worthy man who had sing-songed ' ah-men ' through his nose in Stilborough Church for the past thirty years, so he contented himself with emitting a more sonorous ' ah-men ' than usual at the end of the prayer for ' all sorts and conditions of men ' (amongst whom the puzzling baronet would remain included despite his truancy), and the service pursued the even tenour of its way. Prayers, an anthem, more prayers, then a hymn ; and at afternoon service, when the con gregation is ordinarily thin, when the responses seem to lose themselves in the gaps of unoccu pied seats in the pews, and when the singing is apt to straggle into false notes through insuffi ciency of voices, it may seem to some that the service is less impressive than at matins ; and yet the reader may perhaps agree that to those who go to church for the sake of worshipping, these afternoon services have a charm not always to be met with at those of the morning. Devout as we may wish to be at morning prayer, we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that we are attending a grand parade of fellow sin ners in that finery, concerning which their god fathers and godmothers made certain rash pro mises on their behalf at their baptism. Our"], [301, "A SERMON ON MARRIAGE. 289 fellow sinner, Mr. Pottinger, junior, has got a new necktie ; \u2014 blue with vertical orange stripes \u2014 our attractive fellow sinneresses, the Misses Pettigrew (three) have bloomed out in fresh pink bonnets ; that excellent fellow sinner, Mrs. Poltisham, wife of the doctor, is sporting a new silk gown, made as we charitably presume, out of the hat-bands presented by the undertaker at the funerals of different ailing sinners whom her husband has assisted into a better world. Then there is no end to the fellow sinners whose appearance has altered in some minute point or other since the previous Sabbath. One is letting his beard sprout, another has a cold in the head, a third has assumed a proud look and high stomach on the strength of a bit of luck that has befallen him, a fourth has grown hag gard and feeble under the stroke of sudden calamity ; and all these things must be made mental note of; for do they not supply the stock out of which we shall draw chat for the fireside, and gossip for the market-place, during all the ensuing week ? Well-a-day ! it is in vain that we endeavour to lend our attention to the list of good things which we are imploring of heaven \u2014 daily bread, health and wealth, victories for our Queen, wisdom and understanding for the nobility, unity, peace, and concord for all na tions ! Still, ever and anon will our butterfly thoughts flit, for the banns of marriage pub- vol. 1. u"], [302, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 290 lished between Mr. Thompson and Miss Jack son set us a cogitating ; and we must join in the special prayer for some one who has been sick and desires to return thanks that Providence has rescued him from the boluses of Dr. Poltisham ; and a promise of a sermon next Sunday by the Right Rev. Bishop of Killaloo elates us, and an announcement of a collection, this day, in aid of the Antipodesian Mission depresses ; so that thus we pass from one sensation to the other at this morning service, which is so well thronged by fellow sinners that a non-local sin ner with a white hat, who comes in during the Psalms, can be accommodated with a seat no where but on a chair near the font, whence he stares stonily at the stained-glass windows, the communion plate, and the Misses Pettigrew, and sets speculation rife as to what can be the particular line of sinfulness which he follows for a living \u2014 the artistic, the commercial, or the legal ? But at afternoon service fewer incidents divert us, and the paucity of worshippers seems to draw a more familiar bond between those who are present. It is the service for widows, old maids, aged men who have outlived their families \u2014 for all who have no cheerful home to keep them indoors during the hours between noon and dusk. Also maid-servants, redolent of yellow soap and lavender, abound, sharing"], [303, "A SERMON ON MARRIAGE. 291 their hymn-books with whiskered Jeames and John, or with seductive young fellow sinners in the cheesemongering or grocering station of life. Perhaps a suckling, puling baby or two waiting to be christened, add a kind of homeliness to the general scene ; and over such a comparatively commonplace congregation the minister does not think of scattering the flowers of rhetoric that fall from his morning sermons. He preaches less about doctrine, and more about duty ; less of mystery, more of faith ; and his words, may be, gain in force what they lose in elevation. On the present afternoon Paul Rushbrand was in his happiest vein. He was not indifferent to the clouds which had been thickening over Royster Hall, Amy's home, and he had been much concerned to think that site would be in sadness on her scapegrace brother's account ; but after all the troubles of the Carews (so far as he had heard of them) were money troubles, and he could not bring himself to look upon these as incurable. It had not reached him that Amy was on the point of being engaged to Sir Giles Taplow. If he called to mind her tears in Royster Park, he attributed them to causes be yond his ken ; and he remembered that through out the dinner she had seemed to shrink from Sir Giles, and to look upon him with aversion. This filled him with a bliss which he could not know to be love, for we seldom do label the word u 2"], [304, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 292 ' love ' on the first sweet, overpowering sensa tions which flood our erst empty hearts when we begin to realise that we are living in a day-dream of vague, ecstatic hopes. Enough that Paul lived on Amy ; on thoughts of her ; recollections of her ; hopes about her ; and this was reason sufficient why he should make very passionate love in his afternoon sermon. Make love in a sermon ? Oh, yes, and why not, since the poet and the painter, the tale writer, the musician, insert in their works pas sages and touches which are not meant for the eyes and ears of all, but only for certain eyes and ears. This is often the resource of shy minds who will express with pen and pencil things they would not dare say face to face ; but occasionally the declaration bursts forth unconsciously, flowing like water over the banks of an overfull river ; and thus it was with Paul. He had ascended the pulpit, intending to preach extempore (as he mostly did) from the text : ' He will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able ; ' but as he was turning over the leaves of his Bible, during the singing of the hymn, his eyes settled first on Amy, then on this verse in one of the Gospels : ' And tliere was a marriage in Cana of Galilee! It seemed like an inspiration ; he caught it, and preached a sermon on the holiness of marriage, where it is a sincere union of two hearts."], [305, "A SERMON ON MARRIAGE. 293 The burden of all he said might be repeated in the old law that ' marriages are made in Heaven.' Jesus had sanctified the Cananite wedding by his presence ; and by turning water into wine God demonstrated that marriage was rightly made an occasion of peculiar rejoicing. In the Roman wedding rite it was customary for the bride to say : Ubi tu Gaius ego Gala,' and so Jewish brides repeated the words of Ruth to her mother-in-law, Naomi : ' Whither thou goest I will go, and where thou lodgest I will lodge ; thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.' No completer act of self-surrender could be made by a woman, and if it behoved her to consult with her heart, and see that it was not made amiss, that is, thoughtlessly, so was it most bind- ing on the man to see that he comprehended it, and was equal to the heavy, yet blessed, respon- sibilities which it laid upon him. Marriage was a mutual compact to love, honour, and cherish, and it was especially necessary that honour should exist, each for each, for without it there could be no security of happiness. The woman who pledged herself submissively to obey a man all her life, and who said to him : ' Thy God shall be my God,' must be able to respect his judg ment, his honesty, and his love of truth ; likewise the man, who promised faithful worship and pro tection, must respect the woman's gentleness and purity. Yet, in outward appearance, honour was"], [306, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 294 an element wanting in occasional marriages which usually had the divine blessing on them \u2014 as, for instance, when a virtuous woman out of deep love married a man of ruined character, whom she knew to have been dishonest, and per haps to be so still, but whom she hoped, by her tenderness and her example, to redeem. Such devoted women were justly termed heroines or angels, though by a seeming contradiction the world gave no praise to the man who acted similarly, marrying a debased woman in hopes of saving her. The explanation of this was that the self-sacrifice of woman in marriage was much greater than that of the man, for whereas a man in marrying might be said only to take to himself a servant, the woman undoubtedly gave herself a master. And whenever a woman was found to betroth herself to a man freely, spontaneously, it was obvious that honour for him must be felt by her, despite appearances, sor love clothes with honour those on whom it is lavished ; it makes their faces to shine, their persons to be sweet, their very faults to seem comely. No matter what the world might say of a man, the woman who loved should endow him with virtues he did not possess \u2014 make excuses for his past failings, hope better things of him in the future, and go on ever hoping to the end. Thus it was that the vagaries of real love were all pardonable in the sight of Heaven, as our Lord"], [307, "A SERMON ON MARRIAGE. 295 decreed when he said of Mary Magdalen : ' She hath loved much, and much shall be forgiven her.' Love was, in fact, the finest quintessence of charity. But woe to the foolish or mercenary marriages that were contracted without love, for these must be founded upon perjury. There could be no true promise to cherish or obey him or her whom one's heart did not inwardly glorify ; and if two persons were joined together without having resolved to blend their two beings into one by mutual trust, self-denial, and adoration, the tie that bound them must very soon prove irksome. Worldly calculation might plan fine schemes of wedded bliss, but it could not forge that mystic link which united those whom God had truly joined together, and which held them fast, side by side, for mutual support, aid and comfort in the hour of trial. Therein was the proof, God's blessing on marriage, that when love had drawn a man and woman together they could know no despair, for while each remained true to the other, they combated adversity with a doubled strength and doubled hopes. Thus preached Paul. Perhaps, the yellow soap and lavender-scented abigails thought he spoke too much of the obedience due from women to their lords ; and perhaps the lords aforesaid \u2014 Jeames, John, and the cheesemon gering young gentlemen \u2014 didn't ' quite see ' the fun of denying themselves all their days"], [308, "296 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. for these fragrant Janes and Marias. But these judged after their kind. Amy had been listen ing with all her heart, and every sentence had thrilled her with a sensation which was not painful, but at first rather pleasing. She was in the position of a prisoner who has just ob tained a temporary reprieve, and who, though knowing that a dreaded doom still hangs over her, indulges in exuberant hopes on the strength of her unexpected relies. Paul's words painted to her imagination a happy scene of home life, such as all women crave for ; and her own fancy filled up his sketches with living forms \u2014 her own first \u2014 but whose was the other ? Well his was as yet a form without a face, the dim half-seen image of a man whom she might love with all her soul, who should be brave, gentle, kind, and wholly good ; consequently it was not the face of Sir Giles Taplow. All this lasted till Paul had finished speak ing, then suddenly the brightness within her was darkened. She saw the hard reality of her coming dreary engagement to Sir Giles, and thought that Paul had heard of it, and had wished by his sermon to warn her against the loveless match. This made her cheek flame, and her pride was in a way hurt and confounded by his presumption. What could he know of her feelings ? And if he guessed that she neither loved nor honoured Sir Giles, why did he not"], [309, "A SERMON ON MARRIAGE. 297 do her the justice to conclude that she was not acting of her own free will ? ' Oh, kind Heaven ! have pity on me, sor have I any free will in this matter ? ' she moaned, as she buried her face in her hands, after the service. 'What am I to do ? . . . Where does my duty lie ? If I say \"No\" when I am asked to marry Sir Giles, how shall I bear my sisters' reproaches, and my own self-reproaches too, for I shall never cease accusing myself sor having hesitated to assist my family through selfishness. Oh, Heaven, guide me, guide me!' . . . When she rose from her knees, tearful and heart-sore, Amy's most pressing wish was to get out of the church as soon as possible. She shrank from meeting the vicar's gaze, which she made sure would be bent on her in reproof. But it was fated that she should not get out as she desired, for it continued to rain, and Sir Giles had not returned. Amy had not brought an umbrella either, neither had her brother Jack come ; all things, in short, conspired against her, and she stood under the porch wondering what she should do. The congregation were hurrying out with exclamations of disgust at having to face the drizzle, and that worse mud, so injurious to Sunday garments. Skirts were pulled high enough to reveal wide expanses of white underclothing ; and handkerchiefs were tied, over beflowered bonnets, and charitable"], [310, "298 THAT ARTFUL VICAR. souls, having umbrellas, made shift to huddle other souls under them ; and not a soul amidst all these damp, struggling, distraught souls took any notice of Amy, who was presently left standing alone. In this situation she was found by the ver ger, a rosy-faced official. He had divested himself of his serge gown, and gone his round of the pews to see that no valuables had been left there, and now he had come to lock the doors. But his gallantry caught fire on behold ing Sir Peter's cavalierless daughter, and he made her the offer to choose between two acts of service \u2014 the loan of a gingham, or the fetch ing of a fly from the Red Lion. Amy chose, with thanks, that he should fetch a fly if it would not take too long. ' It would not take 'arf a minute, miss,' said he, and was about to start, when a voice was heard calling him from inside the church. ' Duddes ! ' ' Yessir \u2014 beg pardon, miss, that's the vicar's voice,' and Duddes vanished behind the inner red-baize door. ' I can't find my waterproof, Duddes. Some body must have taken it from the vestry,' Paul said, and was distinctly heard by Amy. ' When did you last see it, sir ? ' asked the rosy verger. ' I was wearing it when I came to church."], [311, "A SERMON ON MARRIAGE. 299 The clerk suggests that Sir Giles Taplow may have taken it ? ' ' Very likely, I should think, sir,' replied Duddes, as if that was a very happy thought of the clerk's. ' Well, but I wish he had had the grace to empty the pockets then,' remarked Paul, dis pleased, ' there was something of value to me in one of them.' ' Money, sir ?' asked Duddes. ' No, no, more valuable than money.' As he said this, Paul pushed the door, and unexpectedly confronted Amy. He started, and both coloured. ' My brother Jack ought to have come to fetch me, and I am waiting for a fly,' explained Amy, being the first to speak. ' But, pray don't wait here in the wet and cold,' begged Paul, civilly. ' Let me take you to the vicarage ; my mother will be delighted to see you.' ' No, thank you, not to-day, though I pro mise to come and make acquaintance with Mrs. Rushbrand some other time.' ' No time is so good as the present. But if you won't come and be made comfortable for half an hour with a fire and a cup of tea, at least step inside the church till Duddes can run over to the hotel.' This Amy did, but would not advance"], [312, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 300 beyond the font, which, being under the organ loft, stood in a semi-obscurity that veiled the play of her features. She began by apologising for her absence from the Sunday school, which led to a five minutes' conversation about the proficiency of the divers young catechumens in their theoretical duty towards Heaven and their neighbour. Then, the fly not having yet come, there was an awkward pause. Amy im pulsively broke it, for she was smitten with a sudden desire to have it out with the vicar, and ascertain whether he had been preaching at her or not. ' That was quite a nice sermon of yours, Mr. Rushbrand. I suppose I may congratulate you on being soon about to enter the blessed state ? ' 'Why ? Because I preached about mar riage ? ' said Paul with his boyish shyness steal ing over him, so that he dared not lessen the distance between himself and Amy which the intervening font kept between them. ' Oh, no, Miss Carew. I am not going ' ' If not you, then some one of your congre gation, I presume ? You would hardly have preached us a wedding sermon without having a bride or bridegroom in view.'

I'm afraid Miss Jackson must be a very bad girl, since you launch such hard things at her.' ' Hard things ?' 'Why, yes \u2014 telling her that unless she was ready to fall down and worship Mr. Thompson and look up to him as an \u00e6thereal being there was no chance of her union being a happy one.' '\u00c6thereal being! No \u2014 he weighs fifteen stone.' ' And is horribly floury about the hair and clothes and all that ? ' ' I can't gainsay it,' rejoined Paul, smiling. ' Well then, why ignore the moral, which is, that girls cannot always get the husbands they would like \u2014 Adonises, Admirable Crichtons, or what not \u2014 and that it is consequently very unfair on them if they are made to suffer because they cannot bestow other sentiments on their husbands but such as these are calcu lated to inspire ? ' ' Surely, though, a baker can inspire love ?' ' Oh, yes. I suppose Miss Jackson was taken by his seductive manner of handing the half-quartern loaves out of his cart' ' Say, rather, by his giving honest weight and baking such beautiful top-crusts,' responded Paul in the same vein of pleasantry. ' The"], [314, "THAT ARTFUL VICAR. 302 truth is, I believe the pair are very fond of each other.' 'It is fortunate that it turns out so, but it might have happened that they felt for each other nothing beyond a commonplace regard.' ' In that case they would hardly have be come affianced,' remarked Paul. ' I don't know. Take this case,' answered Amy in an argumentative way. ' Supposing Mr. Thompson had been in love with Miss Jackson \u2014 we will concede that much \u2014 but that Miss Jackson had not been in love, in fact, had not liked Mr. Thompson at all ; only, that to please her family, who had very, very particular reasons for desiring the match, she had con sented to marry the baker, resolving to be a good, faithful wife to him and to act in all things as if she did love him ? ' ' Can you simulate love ? ' interrupted Paul dubiously. ' N \u2014 no-no, you cannot,' said Amy quickly, ' but that is the man's affair if he chooses to be content with what his wife can give him. I am supposing that Miss Jackson had owned to Mr. Thompson the true state of her feelings, and that they had married in the understanding that she was to do her best \u2014 be kind, devoted, sweet-tempered with him, and all that \u2014 do you mean to say that if she fulfilled her part of the compact like a true-hearted woman Heaven"], [315, "A SERMON ON MARRIAGE. 303 would frown on her and cause her life to be wretched ? ' ' What a question, Miss Carew ! What can have put such thoughts as these in your head ? ' observed Paul, perplexed. ' They were suggested by your sermon on the cause of loveless marriages,' said Amy, coolly ; ' but please answer my query, Mr. Rushbrand. Do you hold that a girl who from generous motives married a man whom she did not like, and who did her duty by him equally as if he had been the man of her free choice \u2014 do you hold that such a girl commits a heinous sin and deserves to be cursed ? ' ' Heaven forbid,' answered Paul anxiously, for he was beginning to detect a disquieting sig nificance in these strange interrogatories. ' The sin, if any, would rest upon those who com pelled her to this sacrifice, and on the man who accepted it.' ' Thank you, Mr. Rushbrand. That is all I wanted to know ; and now, good-bye, for I hear the fly coming.' The sleeve of a sealskin jacket touched Paul's wrist, a pair of soft eyes beamed their light into his, and a small hand was laid in his own.
