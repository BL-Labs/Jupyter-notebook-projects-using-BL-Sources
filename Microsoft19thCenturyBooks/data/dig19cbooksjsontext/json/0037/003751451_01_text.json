On the 23rd of April, fifty-four years ago, the heavy old Bristol coach was pre paring its freight of passengers and lug gage, previous to starting on its weekly journey into Wales. The hour was early, six o'clock, and VOL. I. B"], [10, "2 THE VALLEY OF the morning was rather more than damp. For the drizzling rain fell ; though so hypocritically, that those exposed to it scarce thought a shelter necessary, until the wind, driving with easterly sharpness up the street, chilled and damped them into the fact that it was a most dis agreeable morning. Besides the usual number of ostlers, porters, helpers, and coachman, there seemed but one passenger to brave the ungenial aspect of the morning, and his countenance bore ample evidence that he felt it. His appearance had nothing very strik ing about it : of moderate height, he yet was not slight enough to give elasticity to his movements; and it was with slow, quiet method that he helped to arrange his luggage, showing gleams through his spectacles as he did so of large, gentle looking dark eyes. Clothed in black, his"], [11, "3 A HUNDRED FIKES. dress ending in gaiters buttoned to the knee \u2014 he appeared what he really was, a young clergyman. And though in addi tion to his fine eyes he discovered, as he spoke his thanks, teeth beautiful in regu larity and purity of colour, there was nothing remarkable in his countenance, but an expression of grave sense, and honest purpose. The drizzle now changed to a patter upon the rude and deserted pavement ; and if he had looked grave before, the young clergyman now became undeniably vexed. He looked up to the sky and shook his head \u2014 he looked down the street and appeared more concerned than ever, as he saw two figures emerge out of the misty darkness. \" Dear John, here we are ! \u2014 in time, I hope,\" said the first one, in a voice so sweet, so mellow, so fresh, that ostlers, porters, boots, and coachman, all turned B2"], [12, "4 THE VALLEY OF round to look for the speaker. She was worthy of her voice. Bright and smiling was her face, as she turned towards them with simple graciousness, that gave a gentle dignity to the happiness ex pressed on it. Even the rain seemed ashamed, as her beaming eyes looked up to the heavy swollen clouds, sinking again into a drizzle, which again faded away into mere dampness, as her voice rose like soft melody in the wet street. \" Baby is both good and merry, though we have awakened her so early \u2014 and we have had a most excellent breakfast \u2014 and here we are, quite ready, dear John.\" \" My love, the rain \u2014 such a bad morn ing,\" began the grave young clergyman. \" Not at all, John, it is going to be fine, the wind is in the east.

But as regards the Neath Valley, I can but be sorry that man has interfered : on the face of God's earth I suppose no place was ever more beau tiful.\" \" Indeed ! \" said Emily, with quick plea- sure. \" Does not the river Hepsti run through it,\" said her husband, \" on which there are some beautiful waterfalls ? \" \" There are,\" answered the traveller ; \"and I suppose you also know that this country, so lovely on its surface, is one vast coal basin within its bosom.

Everywhere do they search and dig for the black diamonds beneath \u2014 and every where will this lovely valley, in the course of years, be disfigured and smoke-dried.\" \" I shall not, however, care so much for that,\" said Emily, \" while these lovely hills, on which I have longed to live, are spared.

Nevertheless, pleasure beamed from his countenance as he surveyed the fine, soldier-like looking old man, who was so chatty, and full of bonhomie.

But the passage being accomplished, they once more took their places on the coach, and proceeded on their journey. Now, baby \u2014 who had hitherto proved her self a pattern-baby, worthy of her mother \u2014 from some, no doubt, solid reasons only known to herself, began loudly to express her disapprobation of further travelling. \" Dear love, how that child cries ! \" said John, as baby's screams rose now and then above the rattle of the coach. \" Yes, dear John ; but how fortunate it is no one is inside the coach save nurse.\" John cogitated on this atom of comfort, and the feelings that prompted it, until they arrived at Chepstow, where baby, having food for her mind, through the medium of"], [27, "19 A HUNDRED FIRES. her eyes, gazed at the houses and people instead of screaming. But, leaving Chepstow, they had again audible demonstration that her equanimity of temper was not restored. As John walked up a steep hill, Emily begged him to enquire into the welfare of the little refractory one \u2014 by this request removing a doubt from John's mind as to whether Emily cared more for baby's distress of mind, or the comfort able state of the oral organs of the pas sengers. Baby was happily unconscious of everything, looking the picture of sleeping comfort ; so once more they gave themselves up to the pleasures of their journey. The more nearly they approached the Welsh hills, the more delighted Emily be came, fascinating her fellow-travellers with the charm of her unsophisticated delight. The day had continued most lovely ; they had picked up many more passengers, who c2"], [28, "20 THE VALLEY OF seemed all equally disposed to be chatty and sociable. But who could resist that sweet liveliness ? Even the coachman, most imperturbable of human beings to all save his horses, was in danger of upsetting the coach, he was so often turning round to look at his pretty passenger. And, as the time approached for their parting, he be- came gloomy and morose at the mere prospect of it ; while she called upon John and Captain Hill to corroborate her evidence as to the delightful journey they had had \u2014 \" So well managed, the coach so well driven, the coachman so kind to his horses, such a lovely day, and baby so good \u2014 that one fit of naughtiness had been the first and last ! \" But all things, pleasant or unpleasant, must end.

Anon they are among them ; baby winks and blinks her eyes at them, too astonished to cry. The well-trained horses swerve neither to the right nor left, though they seem going down into a pit, with a hundred forked tongues of flame \u2014 blazing with apparent eagerness to swallow up coach, passengers, and horses. It is of no use denying it \u2014 Emily is nervous. She grasps John's hand. It is on her lips to beg the coachman will stop and put them down anywhere. But there is a great roaring in the air ; the coach turns a corner suddenly, and before them are huge caverns of fire, with enormous black domes rising up in the air, with forked flames tearing themselves high above all. The off-leader starts and plunges a little ;"], [30, "22 THE VALLEY OF the coachman flicks his whip over him to recall him to his senses ; Emily gives a little shriek ; the coach staggers over a tram road \u2014 down they go deeper and deeper ; the roar subsides, the fires grow dim, the coachman relieves his feelings with a deep sigh, the reins relax, the horses bound steadily on, and Emily ceases to pinch John's arm. \"Dear John, what a shocking place ! \u2014 we will never go that way again.\" \" Oh ! never fear, marm,\" answered the coachman ; \" we goes this here road twice a-week, for'ards and back'ards, and never no accidents happens.

But to the gentle Emily he relapsed into a tender-hearted mortal. Emily gave a sigh as she heard him, and John listened for the soft sweet voice uttering words of thanks or pleasure \u2014 but none came. He was still cogitating over this in his mind, all his old fears reviving, all his doubts re turning, wishing this, wishing that, wishing anything rather than having brought this bright nature down to such unknown, un expected scenes, when they came to more fires. Safely they passed through them, al most before they thought they were in them. Emily had not time to pinch John much ; she even said, \" Dear John, this is a wonder ful sight !\" So he comforted himself a little, until they came to others. Emily only grasped his hand, and, when they were through, said, \"Dear John, what charm ing horses, and how well coachman drives"], [32, "24 THE VALLEY OF them.

Mr. and Mrs. Leslie had many visitors; and together they returned the courtesy, becoming acquainted with numbers of their parishioners, both rich and poor. Mrs. Robarts had naturally a kind heart, and could bear without envy or anger the knowledge that a younger, fairer rival was about to shine in what had hitherto been her own hemisphere. Perhaps if Mrs. Leslie had had four pretty, little, healthy, rosy"], [132, "124 THE VALLEY OF daughters, she would not have been so complaisant.

But the baby Adeline would enter into no com petition with the Miss Robarts' \u2014 her round rosy face and chubby baby beauty being in marked contrast to their little fragile frames and delicate features. Therefore Mrs. Robarts felt nothing need prevent Mrs. Leslie becoming that bosom friend, that charming companion, she had so long been requiring ; while Emily, on her part, met her advances a great deal more than half way ; admired the devotion and inces sant care that Mrs. Robarts bestowed upon her delicate girls, all the more because she did not think she could do the same. Pitied her to her heart's content for the many drawbacks and troubles with which Mrs. Robarts said her daily path was beset; entered with all her enthusiastic"], [133, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 125 nature into Mrs. Robarts's, hopes, wishes, and plans for the future, just as if the well doing of the Miss Robarts was of so much more import than all the little Adelines that ever were born. Not that Emily was at all deficient in maternal affection, or thought slightly of Adeline's charms ; but she was so little in the habit of bringing forward her own be longings or wishes, unless forced to do it, that she had room in her heart for any amount of sympathy claimed from her. And Mrs. Robarts, on the first sounding of the deep well of love dwelling in that unselfish nature, set to work to turn as much of it as she could to her own ac- count. She was old enough to remember the strict, severe, almost cruel manner in which children were taught in the days of good Queen Charlotte to reverence their parents. She had heard her mother"], [134, "126 THE VALLEY OF describe the many hours she had been doomed to stand, exhausted and faint, in the presence of her mother ; for children in their day were not allowed to sit without a permission from their parents, and that was rarely given ; she had seen and experienced some of the evils that arise from the estrangement between parent and child \u2014 which estrangement must take place where the parent is the severe judge, the exacting taskmaster, the relentless punisher, instead of the fond mother, the kind adviser, the dearest, truest friend. And in endeavouring to avoid the one evil, Mrs. Robarts, like many people before her, had fallen into the contrary extreme, setting up as idols to be worshipped the little weak mortals whose wayward steps she was to guide aright, and not lead further astray by ill-judged spoiling and indulgence. But at all events, by the time the"], [135, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 127 Thursday arrived which was to see the first entertainment given by Lord and Lady Bernard in honour of the Leslies, Mrs. Robarts and our Emily were fast friends, and on most excellent terms : which indeed was much the case with all whom they were likely to meet at dinner. According to their usual custom, John and Emily set out on their walk up to the Castle in such good time that half way up they met the carriage coming down for them. The coachman very civilly expressed his regret that he had not been in time to prevent Mrs. Leslie walking (though it was clearly no fault of his, but Mr. Leslie's aptitude to take time by the forelock), and offered to take them up there and then ; but Emily hazarded the remark that perhaps he was going for others as well as herself \u2014 which, proving to be the case, they entreated him to go on."], [136, "128 THE VALLEY OF He was a coachman after Emily's own heart, for he said, as he left them \u2014 \" I can now bring up good Mrs. Dawson, ma'am, as well as Mrs. Robarts and Miss Charles.\" \" John ! what a nice coachman.\" \" Very, dear ; but good masters make good servants,\" answered John. What with taking their time (for Emily's sake), and admiring the strange views of the fiery works, and the blue hills, and the Castle itself, the Leslies, through no particular effort on their parts, did not arrive much sooner than the carriage \u2014 so that all the ladies met together in the great hall.

Mean while Emily helped Mrs. Robarts, and at last, beneath the patient eyes of Mr. Les lie, the upper and under-butler and three footmen, the two anxious ladies considered themselves ready.

And she was deep in the history of a poor family over the hills, long before Mrs. Robarts's stiff brocade had settled itself into a chair, or rather at the edge.

I shall wish to know that you are pleased with my share in the selection.\" As dress in those days was supposed to be very different to what it is now, it may not be amiss to describe the contents of the box, taken from the true chronicle that gives all the facts of this family history.

The most expensive article in the box was a silk dress, the colour rather like the gray bloom on the shady side of a pearl. This was laced and ornamented with cords and tassels, and things called tags in those days ; while a mantle to match, of the same silk, was looped up at the shoulders with cords and buttons, and ornamental tassels were hung in every direction. To wear with this dress was a hat of shining black chip, lined within by puffings of pink Persian, and plaits of pink ribbon in rows all round. On one side was placed, with a truly jaunty air, a beautiful red moss rose. Here it may be as well to mention that, the"], [190, "182 THE VALLEY OF first time Emily wore this dress and hat, she looked both lovely and gay, which caused John, after a certain jocose gravity that he possessed, to go up to her, and, lowly bowing, say, \" Madam, will you kindly tell me where I may find my simple wife.\" People were easily pleased in those days. But to go on. There was (then a rare and scarcely known thing) a muff made of moleskin \u2014 at least six pairs of gloves, all long ones \u2014 some of lace, some of wash leather, and one pair of white kid. Now these gloves were guiltless of being marked inside of some peculiar size, or of being possessed of buttons. They were long useful gloves, covering the arm from the wrist up above the elbow, meeting the short sleeves then generally worn. There were one or two pieces of fine Valenciennes lace.

There was a beau tiful frock of spotted Indian muslin for the old baby, and a robe trimmed with very rich lace for the new. There were some books for John ; a pencil-case, thought very extraordinary, that was just shadowing forth what pencil-cases would arrive at in time (say the present). Some Indian silk pocket-handkerchiefs com pleted the whole. Now Emily liked a little finery in her heart : so she was charmed with this box. And every lady who came to see her was not only shown the contents, but allowed to take the patterns. Consequently, ere she was well enough to shine forth in her new hat herself, even Mr. Leslie could not but remark to his wife a bursting out of finery in his church that was rather surprising \u2014 especially in the matter of black hats and pink ornaments."], [192, "184 THE VALLEY OF \" Oh,\" said Emily, highly charmed, \" that is all owing to my dear sister.

Though they might have chosen men of much higher rank, among the statesmen round their father's court, the old country had more charms than the new one, and they each married to get back to it. They were women of decided character as well as beauty ; and Mrs. Reine in particular, having plighted her troth to a young clergyman travelling for the sake of health, left the loves and affections of a twenty years' life with alacrity, to bestow all upon a youth she had known but six weeks.

She felt intuitively that she should die of doing nothing. About this time various religious persuasions were rising in different parts of the kingdom, and, being a good and pious woman, she decreed within herself to devote her time, like Dorcas of old, to good works.

Thus, what delighted Mrs. Reine, as the work of her untiring zeal, in reality was caused all unconsciously by her daugh ter. But these constant visits of Miss Charles were not the less disagreeable to Mr. Leslie.

It was on this wise. He propounded the whole matter. She said nothing, though generally a very voluble woman. He complimented her \u2014 suddenly she rose, opened the sitting room door abruptly, and called, \" Emily, Emily ! \" \" Now,\" said Lord Bernard, mentally, \" what have I done ?

But when he began to perceive that it was a question between them as to which should be most disinterested, to himself he acknowledged his injustice. And very highly both ladies rose in his esteem when at last he gathered the facts. It was Mrs. Reine's ambition to build a school \u2014 lofty, airy \u2014 in every way a model school.

But now, since all parties would be bene fited by the new arrangement, nothing could be more felicitous. Mr. Leslie could have his curate at a cost that was a great deal more than coun terbalanced by his stipend as tutor. He and Emily had sufficient wealth of their own to live with luxuries (as they thought then, poor benighted things), even if they had not their mother's added. Lord and Lady Bernard were delighted to have Mr. Leslie as tutor for their boys. And as for Mrs. Reine, she was in the White House within the week. She and her maid, Milner, took the opportunity of making the experiment of how little was necessary for them to live upon, before the curate came.

Mrs. Reine's school became the mo del of many others \u2014 the focus from whence others radiated. It was not reared in hu man pride, but in a noble generosity that neither heard nor understood the flatteries of less high-minded natures. The Valley of a Hundred Fires wanted such an edifice. Mrs. Reine thought herself privileged that she was permitted to erect it \u2014 nothing more. Thus, if she had for a short time caused any uncomfortableness between Mr. Leslie and his parishioners, it was now amply atoned for.

But Mrs. Reine, far seeing, and a good deal enlightened by her friendship with Mrs. Hannah More, was the first to build one of those large, airy struc tures, of which so many models may be seen now in every county ; and to inau gurate a Sunday School as well. In this she was universally assisted by all the ladies in the neighbourhood.

He was getting accustomed to these little events. No knot this time prevented the extraction of the expected half-sovereign. (Ah, good John ! if you could only take a peep into futurity, you might see that which would suggest the propriety of reducing that fee of thanksgiving into five shillings, or in deed omitting it altogether). \" It is \" began John, dubiously. \" Yes, sir, it's a girl,\" answered Wilsy ; \" thank ye, sir.\" Now, John was not satiated in his love for boys.

John took quite as much pains to pre vent Emily hearing his creaking shoes as if she had given him another son. And he kissed her as fondly and gratefully. Also, he bestowed a fatherly salute upon a lanky, yellow baby that Wilsy produced for that purpose. \"She is the tallest, or rather the long est, baby I ever seed,\" said the old nurse, feeling it necessary to say something in praise of the baby. Mr. Leslie, as he looked at it, felt glad it had something about it to be admired ; and then, bidding them prepare to have it baptized at six in the evening, he departed down-stairs. Now, Emily, smitten with all things Welsh, was determined to have a Welsh name for her new daughter.

In those days people read the prayers in their prayer-books much more often than the rubrics, so that Mr. Leslie was not aware of the flagrant act he was com mitting, in always baptizing his children in their own nursery, within twelve hours of their birth. He made them the children of God as soon as ever he could, carrying them to church to be christened afterwards, according to the time of year. At last came Emily's decision ; and to prevent John making any mistake, she had with her weak fingers written down the name \u2014 \"Nest.\" John shook his head, spelt it over, pronounced it, and for a moment there appeared a probability he would"], [235, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 227 refuse altogether to give even so plain and uninteresting a baby such an extraordinary name. However, the thought that Emily must not be contradicted just came in time. Yet was John again very sly ; and though he rather slurred it over, both the nurses heard another name as well. \" Nest Cecilia\" was now the style and title by which the lanky baby was to be distin guished from her fellow-mortals. Mr. Leslie had happened just to think of the picture of St. Cecilia down in the dining-room, playing on a fiddle ; and Mrs. Reine's turban in the doorway of Emily's room put him in mind of the same head dress that adorned the saint. To such flights and follies does imagination lead even the gravest of us, at the gravest moment. \"Perhaps little Cecilia\" \u2014 Mr. Leslie de signated her so on the spot \u2014 \" may prove a musician.\" It may be as well here to remark that Q2"], [236, "228 THE VALLEY OF poor Mr. Leslie's hopes that way were signal failures.

Never was expectation so entirely de ceived, and mentally knocked down. Personally he was a small, neat little man, scrupulously clean and trim.

And when informed that she was to remain behind, and not return, her sole remon strance was \u2014 \" If I am very good, I may see Nessie and Pearl?\" This reminded Mr. Leslie of the promise made by the Armitages, that once a year their girl was to come to see them ; and"], [262, "254 THE VALLEY OF he reiterated to them that there must be no infringement of it. Adeline tried to smile, young as she was, even at the parting with little John, which caused Mr. Leslie to record another observation in his journal. \"Little Adeline has a disposition very like her mother, wholly unselfish. When she parted from her brother, I was struck with the evident fortitude shown by one so very young. And yet, of my three daughters she will have probably less scope for such a virtue.

That there was cause for discontent few of them could deny ; and Lord Bernard, early setting the example of some little attention to their demands, warded off the evil at first from his own estate. In this he was ably assisted by both the clergymen, but not Mr. Robarts. The latter was an instance of wealth not proving the surest mode of making a gentleman. He would rather have acted the bully, and browbeat the people into obedience, than have adopted the high-bred forbearance of Lord Bernard. It is probable that the storm-cloud of discontent would have passed over the"], [264, "256 THE VALLEY OF v Valley of the Hundred Fires, and left little trace behind ; but there was another evil at work, and that insidiously.

As he still had the management of Lord Bernard's property, the motives from which he acted appeared to emanate from his employer. And the evil spread even to the very edge of the Cinder Tip. And now began the influence of Mr. Howel, and such as himself. These were not times to be contented with the mild and holy expositions of Mr. Leslie, or the learned, somewhat curious, but unrefntable tenets of Mr. Sabine.

Imitating the brief lan guage of Scripture, we must tell that Mrs. Leslie had Gwladys and Gwendoline \u2014 and Mrs. Robarts, Elizabeth and Anna : the latter lady moved to give her daughter these respectable and well-known names at the instigation of Mrs. Reine. That good lady, scandalized at her daughter's choice of such heathenish titles, insinuated to Mrs. Robarts that peculiar blessings of both health and strength were accorded to those children whose parents sanctified them with Scriptural names.

Now, however, she carried them all off from still greater danger, and would fain have carried off her husband also. That, however, was wholly impossible. Old Cap tain Hill buckled on his long disused sword, and, sending his daughters up to the parsonage, prepared to defend his house as best he could. It lay sadly exposed, even in the very pathway of some of the disaf fected ironworks. Miss Charles was not without an indi vidual virtue, evily as she has been de lineated in this history. She was no cow ard ; so determined, lone women as they were, that she and Betty would stand their ground, and remain in charge of their household goods.

Betty, to be sure, was young and rosy when she took the trouble to wash her face ; but as that was but seldom, owing to her mistress thinking soap an unnecessary luxury, and also from the well-known fact that Betty had a tongue and nails, it was not less pro bable she was her own safeguard, even as her mistress. Mrs. Dawson, of course, remained at her post, the doctor's best assistant. Mrs. Reine, also, was not to be frightened away by a bugbear.

Alas, for that renegade from the peaceable community of the Quakers \u2014 she was always at war with the peccadilloes of human nature, and yet could not realize the crimes of that nature gone mad. She looked with horror and disgust upon a dissenter, a ser vant-girl with a flower in her bonnet, a re creant from the Sunday school ; but she thought with mild leniency of thousands of men refusing to work for their own chosen masters, and rising up in defiance against any rule at all. In fact, she had exhausted all her expletives on the smaller sins. Hav ing none left for the greater, she put them aside, as matters rather guessed at than known \u2014 rather meant to talk about than be real. Mr. Sabine regarded all that had taken place, or was about to take place, as one of those phases of life which he would be glad to see, and test by his own eyes and sense.

And it was thus he thought of the probable struggle now impending. Lord and Lady Bernard were not at home : they had been called suddenly from thence by the illness and subsequent death of her mother. But the boys were at the Castle ; and \u2014 to their honour be it spoken \u2014 if Mrs. Reine, Mr. and Mrs. Dawson, Mr. and Mrs. Leslie, or the Hills, had any fear or care, it was for the safety of these boys more than their own."], [273, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 265 Mr. Leslie was a magistrate. He was called upon by the colonel of the regiment to accompany him in that secular capacity. For many days Emily had expected this sum mons ; yet, when the peal of the bell sounded, rung in that sharp, impulsive manner that as much betokened an imminent danger as the military character of him who rang it, she sank back in her chair, white and motionless. John glanced round the room. It was about eight o'clock in the evening. That peal fore shadowed much to him, and, in drinking in one last look of a home-circle so beloved, so endeared, he felt the probability that he might never see it again. Miss Hill was teaching her little god daughter Pearl to draw, whose eager excite ment coloured her cheek like a peach. Miss Frances Hill was reciting a marvellous tale to John and Nest, the former alive with in telligence and delight, the latter endeavouring to understand it all, by opening mouth and"], [274, "266 THE VALLEY OF eyes, as well as ears, to lose nothing of the sense of the story ; while, at her mother's feet, sat a round, roly-poly, good-humoured thing of three years of age, suffering the year-old child on mamma's knee to take great liberties with her straight, smooth, brown hair. This latter evidently possessed a sage and reasoning mind, gravely investigating the quality of the hair between her fingers, and not at all discomposed or turned from her purpose by the little good-humoured efforts to entice her to forego it made by the owner of the hair. Their father's large dark eyes were possessed by four of the children \u2014 John and Pearl alone inheriting their mother's fair complexion, and the latter her blue eyes. Mr. Leslie gazed from one group to the other. They were pictures he delighted to behold ; and when, at last, his eyes fell upon her \u2014 the beloved, the sunbeam \u2014 for a mo ment he bewailed over that sudden, rousing peal. It was but for a moment. As if he"], [275, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 267 would not be unmanned, he resolutely turned from Emily's white face, and went half-way towards the door to meet the messenger. It would appear that the Leslies were not given to much outward demonstration. As John turned from her, Emily rose, and, placing the younger child by its sister, drew calmly to his side. The martial tread, the rattling of the sword in its scabbard, the clanging spurs, and the commanding, ringing voice roused all from their absorbing occupations, turning the eyes of even the fascinated Nest in their round wonder towards the door. A bright, healthy, handsome young face appeared beneath the formidable helmet, all his white teeth glistening as he laughingly said \u2014 \" Work at last, Mr. Leslie. We are to march to-night, and the colonel has sent me for you.\" His very manner was contagious. The"], [276, "268 THE VALLEY OF children gazed in prodigious admiration; Miss Frances Hill thought him quite a darling ; Miss Hill was delighted to see him so brave ; Mr. Leslie felt inspirited by his cheerfulness ; and Emily \u2014 Emily went for John's great-coat and hat. To do her justice, she was not in the least capable of uttering a word ; but because she was so nervous and upset, was that any reason why John should go without his great- coat, which he would entirely have forgotten himself ? \" I will send, love, or write,\" whispered John, as she assisted him to put it on. Emily's only answer was to snatch Pearl's pencil, and put it into his pocket, with some slips of paper \u2014 and no further leave-taking passed between them. In those days the little endearments of affection were not given or taken in public ; and though Emily bent her head to catch the last creak of John's well-known shoes, and John lovingly looked back on the little twinkle of fight, if haply"], [277, "269 A HUNDRED FIRES. he might catch her shadow in the window \u2014 no one knew they did so ; perhaps not either the one of the other. But, at the footstool of the Almighty constant prayers were borne upwards by never-wearying wings all that night \u2014 those prayers that grow in intensity and faith the more they are uttered. In this occupation we must leave Emily, con scious that her wisdom and love were best shown thus. Our business lies with Mr. Leslie. He was not altogether comfortable at discovering that he was expected to ride on horseback with the troop sent for him. John was not a good horseman \u2014 in fact, it may as well be allowed, he was a very bad one. Nevertheless, he felt it incumbent on him to show no fear, and he mounted the great dragoon-horse sent for him without hesitation. \" I have brought you our drum-major's horse, Mr. Leslie, with his bearing reins; so that if you like a couple of troopers to"], [278, "270 THE VALLEY OF lead you, as they do him, you will have nothing to do but stick on.\" Mr. Leslie acknowledged the forethought of the young officer in suitable terms of gra titude, accepting the proposal at once. \" To tell you the truth, sir,\" continued the young dragoon, \" our colonel heard you were an indifferent \u2014 that is to say, a bad \u2014 I mean, that you were not accustomed to ride; and as we shall have to go a devil of a pace, he considered it best \" \" Make no apologies, young sir. I feel myself pretty secure in my saddle, and would rather use the time in going forward at a decent pace, than wasting any, and having to make it up.\" \" Very good, sir \u2014 I am quite of your opinion.

Forwards \u2014 Trot ! \" As the fine clear voice filled the air with its buoyant cheeriness, Mr. Leslie felt a martial spirit rising so suddenly within him, he began to doubt whether he had"], [279, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 271 not mistaken his vocation in life. Suffice it to say that, under the effect of it, a certain exhilaration did away with any uneasiness regarding his unusual position ; and having no trouble about guiding his steed, he had nothing to do but stick on, and go best pace. Consequently, he gained a good name at once, and was handsomely spoken of ever after at mess \"as a pattern of a parson.\" It is doubtful whether he or Emily fully appreciated the value of such praise ; but at all events it was more comprehensible to them than the probable encomium now in vogue. A modern young dragoon would most likely have called Mr. Leslie \" a brick,\" that ex pressive but most paradoxical epithet so delighted in at the present day.

By the soldiers, and those accustomed to the wild passions that take up their dwelling within the heart of man, and render his condition worse than the basest born slave of humanity, an apprehension of the power of this multitude to do evil might be felt. But, strange to say, no such thought entered Mr. Leslie's heart. For seven years he had looked down from his pulpit upon such faces. They were familiar to him. They were his sheep, his fold.

Four days had passed and gone since that ringing peal had summoned John from Emily's side, and he was still absent. Pale was her face, sad the light of her eyes, slow her light footstep ; yet had he sent her messages and notes on every possible occasion.

At first the brave boys demurred, thinking their father could have no more fitter protectors for his house and property than his two sons, boys though they were. But the head servants, with the keepers and the groom, having declared they were better able to protect and guard the place without the additional care of the two young gentle men, and Mrs. Leslie representing they had no male defenders at the parsonage, they consented to her request. Emily had also wished her mother and Mr. Sabine to join them. But Mrs. Reine, strong in the power of her school, had no fear ; and Mr. Sabine for worlds would not shut himself up for safety \u2014 he was cu-"], [285, "277 A HUNDRED FIRES. riously anxious to be in the midst of every- thing. The first report that reached the par sonage was that Mr. Leslie had read the Riot Act, only done when matters were sup posed to be in extremities. The second report was the utter inef ficiency of so small a body of troops to keep order should the evil spirit break out into deeds. Anon came the news that a body seven thousand strong were marching up to the Castle, with the intention of taking the young gentlemen as hostages, with the view to extort the fulfilment of their wildest wishes from Lord Bernard. Seeing the uselessness of contending with so great a crowd, they had been per mitted to search the Castle from cellar to roof. The spirit of mischief broke out, and might have increased to ruder acts, but that the sight of Lady Bernard's"], [286, "278 THE VALLEY OF boudoir, with its bales of flannel, its piles of books, its evident devotion to the wel fare of the poor and sick, touched these wild hearts.

Either regret that they had gained nothing, but rather shown some pusillani mity, as they thought, coming upon the White House in their descent down, they surrounded it, clamorously shouting for food and drink. Mrs. Reine showed herself with unflinch ing courage, Milner behind her mincing and bridling. Alas, for the gratitude of men ! They remembered none of Mrs. Reine's good deeds. They locked her and Mil ner up in one room, and tied Mr. Sabine in a chair in another \u2014 all because they were disappointed to find in that frugal household no more food than sufficed for the hunger of two of them."], [287, "279 A HUNDRED FIRES. \"Now, if you sets a hollering and a making of a nise afore we gets well away, we'll be oop and scragg thee, friend,\" was their pleasing remark to Mr. Sabine. \" Verbum sat,\" quoth he in answer, re signed, but still curious. \" Mr. Sabine !

It might be that the thought rose within them to climb its steep side, and descend into the sacred precincts of the parsonage.

Meantime young John and Nest had flown wildly into the parsonage, shouting \"Papa is safe! \u2014 papa is safe!\" Mrs. Leslie, anticipating much more than the reality, interpreted the cry into the fact that he had arrived, and rushed out to meet him. The consequent explanation did not place John and Nest on a high pinnacle of favour. Their exploit appeared to gain no applause but in their own eyes ; and though Emily was too just to visit on their poor little heads the bitterness of her disap pointment, she clearly considered the whole tale as unworthy of notice \u2014 the hopes it gave valueless as wind.

They had indeed enjoyed themselves greatly, after the cessation of the riots, and Emily's convalescence. The Castle had been full of guests ; gaiety and good humour had been brought forward to charm away discontent and ill-will. The Leslies had been made much of by all the great people ; Lord Bernard, in no manner behindhand, ac knowledging his vast debt to Mr. Leslie. His people had returned to their duty, and disaffection had silently crept away. John and Emily were contemplating another holiday to go and see their darling Adeline ; for her aunt, alarmed at the riots, had never yet fulfilled her promise of bring ing the child to see her parents. It was in the first pang of disap- u2"], [300, "292 THE VALLEY OF pointment that Mr. Leslie made the remarks in his journal just quoted. They were indeed too straitened in purse to think of the proposed expedition. Mrs. Reine had been to see Lady Armitage twice since Adeline had be come her care, and Emily had tried to persuade herself that her grandmamma's report was as satisfactory as if she had herself seen her. But Mrs. Reine had never quite recovered the shock of the riots, and showed no inclination to move from her house now ; and though Emily could not doubt the love of her sister for her adopted child, yet she began to pine for one look of her. She feared lest the little affectionate heart should lose the remembrance of those dearest to her. Mr. Sabine had also not recovered his incarceration.

Only this very day did she not overtake him (herself, Emily, and Mr. Leslie, in the Castle chariot \u2014 or charret, as it was then called \u2014 going up to dinner there, it being very wet,) walking away, utterly forgetful that he was also to be called for ? And as if that was not sufficient to portray the erratic state of his mind, he held his walking-stick steadily over his head, carefully carrying his umbrella under his arm. \" My good sir,\" remonstrated Mrs. Reine, afterwards, \" did you not observe the rain running off like a gutter from the brim of your hat ? \" \" I was conscious of a dampness, my dear madam ; but experience has lately taught me there are situations from which nothing can free us, no matter how dis agreeable, perplexing, or undignified.

No, it was no rivalship \u2014 it was no delight in the superiority of her family over Emily's. It was simply her own character. To Mrs. Robarts such a character was as enigmatical as it was alluring, She was fascinated by it. In the first place, Emily was so unselfish. She recorded, with genuine pleasure, every little thing she might chance to hear in favour of any of the Robartses. Now, Mrs. Robarts was very different. She might not care particularly to know that Emily was considered prettier than herself ; because, naturally, she was not vain of her beauty."], [305, "297 A HUNDRED FIRES. But touch her with regard to her children, and she was instantly alive with quivering pricks of umbrage. She could no more listen to, or, harder still, repeat, anything in favour of the Leslie children, than sit down and converse with Mr. Sabine in every lan guage that he knew. Sickness had visited both families ; and Mrs. Robarts gazed upon Emily with vague wonder. She went about her parish duties, organized her household, received visitors, just as if she had no children at all \u2014 cer tainly none that were sick. And yet she could not call her heartless. Her colour came and went quickly \u2014 evidently with apprehension \u2014 when Dr. Dawson pre scribed stronger measures, or looked a little grave ; but all that he ordered was done without fuss \u2014 without any more excitement than an every-day circumstance.

Soon Emily appeared, having settled her house hold matters, and, drawing a large basket of work towards her, proceeded to hear the aforesaid lessons ; and though she chattered incessantly to Mrs. Robarts, the latter lady observed not a task was passed over, not a word allowed to be missed ; and the gentle tones of praise were not so soft as those of censure \u2014 yet both had equal power. And all the while, a pile of mended socks and little garments increased more and more. By the time that Mrs. Robarts was weary of sitting, young John came in.

But, first let it be understood, her two little sons were yet in petticoats : there could be no rivalship."], [307, "299 A HUNDRED FIRES. Young John had more than beauty. His whole countenance beamed with intellect. Soft large eyes, of the colour of rich brown velvet, looked inquiringly into everything you said or did. Your motive must be clear, your thought pure, or your tongue would falter and your eyes droop at the clear gaze of those questioning eyes. At four years of age young John had asked questions the elder John was puzzled to answer. At seven years he had brought his Latin book to his father, demurring as to the propriety of a certain mode of translating a passage out of Ovid's Metamorphoses, and requesting to read the first lines of the Odyssey in Greek. For the future of young John, Mr. Sabine predicted extraordinary things. Phrenology was just beginning to throw a beam of light over the physical world. And he felt John's bumps. The question was not what was wanting, but what he would do with the im-"], [308, "300 THE VALLEY OF mensity he possessed. Causality, order, ima ginativeness, ideality, wit, struggled for the greatest space.

The Almighty permits us now and then to see on this earth a living type of the earliest Adam, to show from what we are fallen. Mrs. Robarts did not dare to be envious of this boy.

And where"], [309, "A HUNDRED FIRES. 301 could more happiness be found than racing up and down it? Mrs. Robarts was aware that Emily was a great reader, spite of all her avocations. Also she was a politician, a very fierce, one-sided politician. We are forced to ac knowledge it. Emily was so rank a Tory, she would not believe a single good thing of a Whig. Mrs. Robarts had often listened to her, holding forth in highest animation, and divulging at the same time an amount of knowledge concerning the now existing strategy of the political world that amazed and puzzled her. Mrs. Robarts did not care to see things much beyond her nose, but she respected those who took the trouble of investigating matters that concerned the nation, and not the nursery. Patriotic principles generally demand admiration. To be true, they must be so honest, and free from selfishness. We hope we have shown sufficient cause"], [310, "302 THE VALLEY OF to explain the paradox, that Mrs. Robarts despised Emily, yet looked up to her ; cared not for her advice, yet was always desirous of her good opinion. It is presumed there was a mixture of the simplicity of the dove and the wisdom of the serpent in Emily's character. Perhaps the great charm to Mrs. Robarts was her faith. Emily hoped the best always, and, in constant anticipation of good rather than evil, she was over and past her diffi culties almost before she felt them. She is now in a great one. John wants a new great-coat; the chil dren all require new winter frocks ; the roof has been blown off the mud cottage be longing to some disreputable people called Meredith ; they wished to go and see their darling Adeline, and John has got nine pounds, some odd shillings, to effect it all.

Those four nights with the pitmen had taken a year's wear out of it. So she was only cognisant of two imperative necessities \u2014 the children's frocks and the Merediths' cottage. John was busy in his study. A soup kitchen was being established by Lord Ber nard, he undertaking all preliminary ex penses, with a permanent subscription, and the rest was to be made up among the wealthy inhabitants of the Valley of a Hun dred Fires. Now John could not call him self wealthy, nevertheless out of what God had given him some was to be returned to the poor. John sent the idea of a new great coat to the winds, and put down the sum meant for it to the soup-kitchen. At this moment Emily entered. \" Oh, John ! something must immediately be done \u2014 the Merediths have got the fever, and their roof is still half off.\""], [312, "304 THE VALLEY OF \" My dear love, I really am too poor.
