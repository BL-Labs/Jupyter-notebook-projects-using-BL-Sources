The Pamphlet, of which the following is a translation, was first published in the modern Greek dialect, at Athens, for the use of the University there, by the late Professor Dr. Ulrichs, and afterwards at Berlin by the Academie der Wissenschaften in German, with additional notes and references. It was from this Greek original that the Trans lator rendered it into English ; on the appearance of the German text he again reviewed and revised his transla tion with that version which was read before the Royal Society of Literature, in June 1846, and which he now lays before the student of classical topography in this country in English. Professor Ulrichs was a native of Bremen, and student of the Universities of Bonn and Munich during five years, at the end of which period he graduated as Doctor of Phi losophy and Master of Arts ; he then proceeded to Greece, where he was employed by the Government to organize the Gymnasium or Public School there ; and, on the foundation of the Otho University at Athens, was appointed Regius Professor of Latin Literature.

THE TRANSLATOR."], [15, "TOPOGRAPHY OF THE HARBOURS OF ATHENS. The determining the site of the harbours of Athens is one of the most important and difficult points of Greek topo graphy. Its importance in a military and mercantile point of view no one will question ; and the difficulty is suffi ciently proved by the contradictory opinions of all those who have examined this matter, either from a distance or on the spot itself. If the author of the present excursus does not submit these opinions to detailed controversy, and passes over those of many in silence, it is for no other reason than because experience has fully convinced him, that an examination such as the present possesses only two points d'appui; to-wit, the testimony of ancient writers, and the nature of the locality as we at present find it. Leake and O. Muller have established as axioms, by their great autho rity, many positions in Attic topography, which are never theless incorrect, and continued examination will, therefore, prove many maxims to be untenable which those learned gentlemen held to be unimpeachable. The chief point which I shall endeavour to prove is, that the most ancient emporium of Athens, the Phalerum, was entirely separated from Pir\u00e6us, its three harbours, and the walls surrounding it, being situated at Hagios Georgios, at that point where the Cape Colias has heretofore been placed. From this hypothesis it results, that Cape Colias is to be looked for an hour's distance further S.E. at Hagios Kosmas ; moreover, that the Phalerian long wall extended from Athens over a dry plain to Hagios Georgios, and the two Pir\u00e6an legs ran in a parallel direction down to the wall enclosing Pir\u00e6us and Munychia, partly through"], [16, "6 TOPOGRAPHY OF THE swampy ground. With respect to the throe, harbours formed' by nature, but perfected and rendered capabl being closed by art, I hope to prove that the largest har bour, properly of Pir\u00e6us, was divided into two parts; to- wit, the Emporium, or commercial harbour, and that destined to ships of war, called Cantharus. In addition, that the pre sent Pashalimani, called by modern critics Munychia, was the great Naval Arsenal Zea; and lastly, that the Phan called by modern commentators the Phalerian Harbour, was called Munychia, and was the third Dockyard, or Naval Arsenal. According to Strabo and Pliny,1 it was the general opinion that Pir\u00e6us was once separated from Athens by the sea, against the probability of which no doubt can be raised. The sea sand, driven continually by the south wind on the open coast, formed high downs, and the alluvium brought down and deposited by the Cephissus and other smaller stre.* supposed to have formed insensibly the Halipedon, a marshy and saliim depression,* connecting the Pir\u00e6us with the bign and fruitful soil of the olive grove and fields which f the coast of Athens at the remotest period. The ground of the Halipedon was so marshy and wet, that the first long walls settling within but few years after their first construction, the marsh required pressing down with rubbish and heavy stones, in order to obtain a secure foun dation.3 Up to the most recent date, the Halipedon was exposed 1 Strab.

At present a raised causeway has been formed along that part of the foundation of the northern long wall which is still preserved, conducting the water of the Cephissus and the other brooks to the sea, by means of long ditches, despite which the entire hollow between Pir\u00e6us and Hagios Georgios, called Misia (57 rVUo-ta), is impassable in winter. This state of the ground appears to have been the chief reason for which the Athenians of more remote times did not use the superb harbours of the Pir\u00e6us, contenting them selves with a landing place which, bad as it was, possessed two advantages, viz., that it was nearer the city by half an hour, and that it could be reached dry foot at all times: I allude to the Phalerum. With increasing resources and the advances made in navigation, it may easily be conceived that the necessity of a better harbour would be felt ; the earliest kings were, however, it appears, averse to the sea on mo narchical principles.4 Thus the Phalerum continued the harbour of the capital up to the time of the Persic war.

Inser, Gr. referring hereto, where it is at tbe same time uncertain whether we should read 43, 45, 46, or 47. The stadia by which Thucydides measured the Athenian fortifications, are considerably less than the ordinary Olympic stadia, bearing the proportion of 4 to 5. With respect to the fortifications of Pir\u00e6us fixed by Thucydides at 60 stadia, we may assume that they did not extend to"], [18, "8 TOPOGRAPHY OF THE approached nearest to the city at Phalerum; to-wit, within about twenty stadia, or an hour's walk. Thai reckons the length of the Phalerian wall at five stadia than the Pir\u00e6an. The computation of Pausanius, howt appears somewhat under the truth ; it may, neverthel- - conceived that the coast at Hagios Georgios was in his time some few furlongs more inland than at present ; and il compare the distances as given by Thucydides, drawing a straight line from the fortifications of Athens to H< Georgios and the Pir\u00e6us, we find that the former will be about five stadia, or about 3000 feet shorter than the latter. Some ruins of the foundations of two walls are found in the hollow between Athens and the Pir\u00e6us, running parallel to each other at a distance of 560 feet Near Pir\u00e6us the southernmost one diverges, and joins the circuit wall of Pir\u00e6us at a small rocky projection under the fortifi cation of Munychia ; the northernmost one, however, meets it at right angles. Leake, who perceived very correctly that it would have been superfluous for the Athenians to have run a third wall between the other two,7 only admits two walls, accusing Thucydides of carelessness of expression in computing the Phalerian long wall at five stadia less than the Pir\u00e6an, inasmuch as the length of both, to judge from the ruins, must have been the same. But while Leake is defending the common sense of the Athenians at the ex pense of Thucydides, O. Muller does the reverse ; he pro tects Thucydides against Leake's imputation, but calls the third wall useless, which forms the charge against the the extreme edge of tbe coast at every part, but that tbe furthest part of the peninsula was divided off by a straight wall, since otherwise the analogy of the measurements is destroyed ; on the other hand the circuit of the city walls appears too inconsiderable in our day, but we must take into account that the S.W. half thereof passed up and down over not inconsiderable eminences, which would considerably lengthen the line ; a comparison of the actual mea surements with those of Thucydides, gives the following result: \u2014 Stadia.

Athenians.8 Our explanation reconciles both, and shows that neither Thucydides has made a mistake of five stadia, nor that the Athenians built a useless wall of forty stadia in length. German scholars, and particularly 0. Muller, Wachsmuth,9 and others, have done enough to show that there were three walls ; indeed, Thucydides expresses himself so distinctly on this head, that it appears almost impossible to place the other wall elsewhere than in the direction of Hagios Georgios. The point in the circuit wall of Athens, whence the Phalerian wall sprang, was not far distant from the point whence the parallel Pir\u00e6an walls set off, otherwise Thucydides would not have expressly mentioned the inter mediate space. His scholiast computes it at seventeen stadia, which is probably too much by ten stadia, inasmuch as that would be more than one-fourth of the whole circuit wall ; near the sea the intermediate space was not more than eighteen stadia in a direct line. On account of its greater proximity to the sea, and its more open position, Hagios Georgios is often used as a bathing place by the inhabitants of Athens, and King Otho has a bath-house there. The flattened hill, on which the chapel lies, is called Trispyrgi (ot TpeXs trvpyot) forming a blunt cliff\", terminating the great Phalerian bay on the south-east. At the chapel there is a tambour of a large Doric pillar, and in some of the ruined walls of more modern date many old quarried stones may be found. On the hill near, two cisterns, hewn in the rocks, are per ceptible ; broken fragments of tile and pottery are to be found in all directions. It can scarcely be expected that any vestige of the sanctuaries, seen by Pausanias, at Phalerum, should be extant ; I nevertheless think I recognised at many points in the vineyards, elevated some feet above the marshy hollow, on the right hand side of the road from Athens, in disputable remains of the old Phaleric wall. The view of Strabo favours my hypothesis as to the position of the Phalerum, at Hagios Georgios ;10 for in describing the Pir\u00e6us and the hill of Munychia, he says of this latter vtto-ni-nTovrn 8' avTy kipeves Tpeis, and then passes over to Athens, which when he has described, he again re sumes the thread of his discourse, and continues, pera be tov 8 Leake's \"Topography of Athens,\" p. 372, and 0.

I may be permitted, moreover, in support of my view, to add, that it by no means accords with the reputation tha Athenians had for good sense, that they should, during a series of centuries, have contented themselves with the little harbour of Phanari, surrounded with high rocky clifi not have seen the two larger harbours lying under the self same hill; they would then indeed have far more merited the name of Blind, than the founders of Chalcedon, who overlooked the position of Bysantium, in their imme diate neighbourhood. Least of all is Phanari adapted to the necessities of a commercial harbour, for, in order to transport the goods thence to Athens, it would have been necessary to convey them over high ridges \u2014 a useless labour, \u2014 and thence through exactly the most marshy portion of t lie Halipedon. I assert here, that the ancients gave the harbour Phanari the same name as the fortification of Munychia that commanded it, which I trust to prove in the sequel.

No further mention is made of either the Phalerian wall or harbour. The oldest port of Athens fell into ruins, and the new har bours of the Pir\u00e6us were declared to be the exclusive emporia of all Attica.24 Thucydides relates that Themistocles persuaded the Athenians to fortify the Pir\u00e6us, seeing, as he did, the ex cellency of its three natural harbours;24 and a glance at the map will prove that under the three natural harbours, the largest, named now \" Drakos,\" \" Pashalimani,\" and, thirdly, \" Phanari,\" are to be understood. The great har bour Drakos was commonly called simply Pir\u00e6us, and was divided, as we shall afterwards show, into the Emporium, and the naval arsenal Cantharus, Pashalimani being called \" Zea,\" and Phanari \" Munychia.\" Pausanias shows more plainly than any other author, the error into which we fall when we reckon Phalerum among the rpels avrorpve'is Ai/m-a**- of Thucydides, who remarks, that in place of the one harbour of Phalerum, the Pir\u00e6us offered three ports, and Cornelius mentions the harbour of Phalerum in contradistinction to the triple harbour of Pir\u00e6us.26 Tim\u00e6us says, in his Platonic Lexicon, that Zea and Munychia were two harbours different from Pir\u00e6us f and here, under this latter denomination, he evidently under- 24 Demosth. adv.

Ross, and pub lished by Bockh (Records of the Marine Power of the State of Attica), prove that Athens, in the lifetime of De mosthenes, possessed three naval arsenals, Cantharus, Zea, and Munychia, of which Zea was the greatest, inasmuch as double the number of triremes could be housed here as in either of the others.31 Now as Cantharus, as we shall here after see, was a part of the great harbour, Pashalimani must be called Zea, and Phanari, Munychia. To call Zea the corn haven, on account of its name, is an assertion not warranted by evidence;32 for the corn was imported into the great harbour within the limits of the Attic emporium ; whereas Zea was evidently a naval arsensal, with sheds for not less than 196 triremes, together with other appurte nances, as is proved by the inscriptions. Hesychius, more over, agrees in Zea being one of the closed harbours. The remains of the submarine structures, consisting of large hewn aud well fitted stones, are plentiful around the basin : in many places small stone piers are perceptible at a small depth under the surface, extending into the sea parallel to each other at right angles from the shore, doubt less destined for supporting the individual ship sheds, an exact measurement of which proves how very narrow the *\" Bdckh's Records of the Navy of the A .tic State, p. 68, et\", p. 414, p. 447, p. 529.

Close at the entrance of the harbour Zea, to the west, lies a very small harbour without the ring fence, on the we side of which is preserved a strong rounded Molos, extend ing some distance out into the sea, and in the rocky shore near it an oval hollow of the size and form of a bath is hewn out, in front of which there is a small round hole.

Some place Phreattys outside Pir\u00e6us, that is to say, outside the Ring wall, as it would appear near Zea,35 both data coincide with the position of Tzirloneri, and the word Phreattys appears at the same time to have reference to a well.

The basin of Phanari is about half the size of that of Pashalimani, which coincides with the tenor of the inscrip tions stating that there was only room for 82 ship-sheds in Munychia. The harbours both of Zea and Munychia, more especially, however, the latter, are, on account of their posi tion, better adapted to naval arsenals than commercial ports, inasmuch as they are so commanded by the citadel Muny chia, that although an enemy might certainly take them by surprise and burn the sheds, yet he could never maintain his position in them. The Citadel Munychia did not afford this security to the large harbour, on which account all hos tile attacks, we perceive, were concentrated upon this spot. The fortification of Munychia was to Pir\u00e6us, in a military point of view, that which the Acropolis was to Athens,36 sur rounding as it did the sanctuary of Artemis ; it was placed on the highest point in this Chersonese, and is now called Kastella (i) Kaore'AAa). It was fortified by the Turks during the late war of independence ; the small harbour Phanari lies at the steepest part under Kastella towards the south east of Phalerum, and is it not natural that one should call the citadel rising above it also Munychia, a supposition which is supported by the route of Pausanias. A passage in the speech of Lysias adversus Agoratos, shows that the harbour of Munychia lay next to the sanctuary of Artemis.37 The persecuted Agoratos took refuge at the altar of the goddess, and his friends, in order to move him to a more speedy flight, anchored two ships in the harbour of Munychia ; they naturally chose the landing place nearest to the sanctuary, because Agoratos was exposed to imminent danger of capture. 36 Hence Thucydides's expression Tliipauvg ZivMovwxia, and the like, E.

That a portion of the harbour bore this name, is an assertion as destitute of foundation as with respect to Zea being a corn harbour, a supposition to which the mutilated and corrupted Scholion of Aristophanes Pax. 145. has given rise. Perhaps this Scholion might be restored as follows : \u2014 o ntipaecirc Xtptvag Ix11 TP\"S irdvrar KXtiaTovg' tig pin [b piyiarog Xtprjv, ivSa iv StZtif irpdrov] b KarSrapof Xtpriv, Iv tp rb vttiipia, tlra rb 'AtppoSivtov, tlra kvkXui tov Xipivog trroai irivrt. Whence it must follow that the other two closed harbours were Munychia and Zea. With respect to the assertion of modern topographers, that two temples of Aphrodite existed, I venture the following remark. According to Pausanias, Conon built the Aphrodision in Pir\u00e6us, after tbe marine victory of Cnidos, where Venus was venerated by preference ; I therefore believe that the legend related in the Scholion Hermogen. irtpi ihtSiv, that a dove settled on the trireme of Themistocles, on which account he founded a sanctuary for Aphrodite, in Pir\u00e6us, after his victory, confounds the two sea-heroes, for an owl settled on the trireme of Themistocles before the battle of Salamis, (Plut. Them. XII.) and after the victory he erected a sanctuary in Melite to the Aristobula Artemis. (Plut. de Malign. Herod. XXXVII.) The legend of the dove in Conon'stop, is imitated from the owl of Themistocles in the same way as many like religious anecdotes are repeated.

Upon this headland the most important records of the Attic marine power are to be found ; and Ross concludes, on the strength of these inscriptions, and some large triglyphi found there, that the renowned arsenal of Philon stood somewhere near this spot,5\" an idea admirably adapted to the beautiful pano ramic position. Here the public transit magazines, harbour offices, quarantine, &c, have been lately built. On the southern side we see, in several places, small parallel stone piers as in Zea ; nor is it to be disputed that the station of a part of the ships of war, immediately at the entrance of the great mercantile harbour, would not be misplaced, and would afford great protection to commerce ; moreover, vessels of war would more readily be able thence to sail in and out, without interfering with the vessels engaged in com merce, with whicb the basin of the Emporium was, doubt less, often crowded. This disposition of the war harbours is such, that all would most readily communicate one with another, of which the locality as here laid out admits, moreover the fortification at the extremity of the peninsula, by the mills of the present day, would have protected the Cantharus in some measure.51 The Kcooioy XtpTjv, mentioned by Xenophon, is laid down so as to fall without the Pir\u00e6us, at some distance from the Halipedon,52 now, as it is nowhere else alluded to, it would appear that it was not used as a regular harbour ; and it may, therefore, be presumed that, the narrow bay formed by the Eetonia with the continent, and lying imme diately before the large harbour, is understood. The re mains of an old wall there, show at least that it was occasionally brought within the fortification of Pir\u00e6us. 30 There was an arsenal on the Acropolis of Athens in which Lycurgus stowed 50,000 bows, and other weapons. There was also to be found there running rigging for ships of war, wherefrom, according to tbe often mentioned Inscriptions, the requirements of 100 triremes were supplied (S. Boeckh, Lrkunden liber das Seewesen, etc. p. 81.) The probable position of this arsenal was on the east of the citadel, where the foundations of a large building exist, I have marked in the plan which forms an appendix to the following treatise on the Temple of Ergane ou the Acropolis. 31 Plutarch.

It was here that the Athenian dames celebrated a numerously attended festival.55 After the battle of Salamis, the westerly wind drove a great quantity of the wrecks of the Persian fleet on this shore, whilst the ships which had escaped retired to Phalerum.56 Strabo places Colias in the vicinity of Anaphlystos, too far towards the south, and Stephanus towards Phalerum, which is also incorrect. 5T Hesychius, Eusthatius, and other gram marians,58 describe the promontory as a strip of land ex tending out into the sea. This latter distance, and that given by Pausanias, agree with the position of Hagio's Kosmas (6 K&fios tov ayCov Kocrpa), distant a little more than an hour's walk, perhaps about twenty-five stadia, is the nearest and only cape worthy of note on this coast.

The small chapel up Hagios Kosmas lies on the extremity, and is plainly visible from Pir\u00e6us, on account of its exposed position. In the church some large squared stones are built into tbe wall, and I found there the marble foot of a Dexamene ; many other squared stones lie on the strand. A few steps further inland may be found extensive foundations ; and further towards Athens the remains of considerable buildings. Hesychius mentions a four-columned temple of Demeter in Colias. 59 The neighbourhood of the sea is called Kalamaki, and is partially cultivated as vine yards, in whicb some tile-kilns have been discovered. The best Attic vessels were formed of clay from Colias -,60 on the shore oysters were dredged,61 as at present. I subjoin a plan, founded on the map of Athens and the neighbourhood, drawn by Mr. I.
