As we neared the island, for the benefit of shade, (for the heat was intense,) we came close under a dreary-lookiug wing of the building of the lazzaretto \u2014 so close, that we distinctly heard a young silvery-toned voice frequently repeating' Venite per me? Venite per me, cari amici?' Di rected by the sound, we perceived a pale face pressed against the iron bars of a sashless window, in an elevated part of the building : one hand, that looked like snow in the sunshine, had forced itself through the grating, and accompanied by its im patient motion, the anxious oft-repeated question of Venite per me?' As we rowed on, the voice lost its cheeriness, its tones seemed suffocated by disappointment, and the wind that bore them died noton the waters with a more melancholy mur mur than the last sobbing sound which we caught of ' Venite per me ?

Like noiseless drops of diamond-showers, O'er all that waveless depth serene ; Till once again, the happy voices Of those whom Love had gathered there, In fairy galleys, far and near, Seemed well-nigh joyous to mine ear, And each sweet song stole through my heart, As when I, too, had borne a part ; \u2014 For many a youthful band rejoices, Along those shores, when eve is come ; While I, from out my living tomb, Far worse than dead, can still behold The gentle reign of young delight, Remembering years of swifter flight.

The following is merely an abstract picture of ruin, and has no allusion to any facts recorded in history. A change came o'er the spirit of my dream. Byron. Of that great puissance which doth o'erthrow The kingliest seats of famous conquerors, Or quench the peasant's hearth, with equal sway, Unpeopling earth, and bringing all to nought, Under the funeral shadow of his wings, \u2014 I would trace out a feeble record, here.

He found the place where, once, his home had been ; Where, once, a mount, clad with far-spreading forests, Reared its huge head, in lasting snows arrayed, High as the summer-clouds. All round its base, Of old, were many cities, and that height Was of far isles, and peopled lands, the wonder. He sought that mount, and found it not. Its place Was empty. The fair cities, like their dwellers, Were buried. The vast woods that had been, were not, And left but nakedness and barrenness."], [26, "12 THE MIGHT OF TIME. The wide lakes glittered to the sun no more ; The thirsty earth had, long since, swallowed them ; And the sea-isles were gone. Nought there was left The same as oft his living eyes beheld, But the ever-rolling waves of the great deep. Even the seas were desert. No trim bark Sped to or from those shores ; not even the skiff Of the fisher scudded o'er the bay : but quicksands Had marred the goodly haven which, so oft, Held fleets in its broad shelter. Time had wrought A piteous triumph, in that clime : his host Of centuries had past, and done their worst. An earth-shock had flung down the towering height, And filled the lakes with its huge ruins. There The fire-mountain disgorged its deluge red, And, long ago, had sepulchred whole cities Within a burning grave. Far, round about, The holds of strength, the bulwarked citadels, Were levelled like the hamlets, wholly razed, Without a wreck of all that was. Their ruins Had crumbled into ashes, long before, \u2014 Their ashes into dust : for many ages, Their very names had been unheard, on earth. Decay had swept off all that had been.

Through that land no living thing, Save the fierce desert-creatures, dwelt : to these Man had forsaken all. Thick mists of death Arose from the wide marshes, in whose place The goodly lakes had been of old. Far, wide, The air was tainted with the breath of plagues. That being turned away, as an earthly man Would, shuddering, turn him from the murdered corse Of his own sire. With speed unspeakable, He fleeted forth from the sad region. Soon He overpast the rueful realm, and all The bounds of the vast wilderness, and came Among the dwellings of the quick, where now The ancient cities were, even in the place Which wide and pathless forests had o'erspread, When he had last been in the upper world.

He heard it not. Another speech from that his lips had known Was heard ; another people there had sway ; And all the offspring of the olden race, That had been mighty, now were lowly thralls, And in their ancient heritage they toiled For those whose forefathers had toiled for theirs. They groaned beneath the rod of evil power, And perished hopeless. Still a few there were, A trusty few, that would have died the death To win one bright free hour : but all the rest Were slaves in soul, crouching beneath the lash.

Murder's imps Sate on the judgment-seats. There all the base Were armed with evil might, and all the noble Pined with sad memory they dared not own, Masked with most lying smiles. Hatred and wrong And bloodshed revelled there, from day to day, While'men looked cheerily, and cursed each other. Death's truant would behold no more.

Still doth she languish, stripped of her green vest : The naked shrub no gladdening verdure knows, But all is sunk in fullness of repose : Yet all foretells, amid this slumber drear, The moment of the bright awaking near.

Many a rhyme I've wove For this stern taskmaster, my zeal to prove, Nor fruit nor flower have gained, by all my art : Nor will the tyrant grant me to depart, Till Time, on him and me, more plagues shall move.

The 87th Regiment, or Prince of Wales's own Irish, are here alluded to. This was the only corps which captured two French eagles, during the late war : they were highly distin guished in nearly all the great battles, on the Peninsula ; particularly at Barosa, where they defeated two French regiments, and decided the victory ; and at Vittoria, where they captured au eagle. At the siege of Tarifa, when Mar shal Soult, with ten thousand men, prepared to assault the place, the 87th, which, with a body of Spaniards, formed the garrison, appeared on the walls, and gave three joyous cheers, which had the effect of deterring the enemy from his intended experiment, and of inducing him to make a very hasty retreat. The wild Irish were after their foes, in a trice, and took some pieces of cannon, and the baggage of the French. This re giment, when charging, always made use of a battle-cry, in the old language of Ireland,\u2014\" Faug a ballagh !\" (\" Clear the way !\") and never was that call heard in vain. They were at Guernsey, in June, 1815. The 88th, or Connaught Rangers, another celebrated corps, (facetiously called the Devil's own, after the storming of St. Sebastian's,) were also absent from the battle of Waterloo : but we had, there, the 27th, \" the regiment with the towers,\" which were opposite the station of Napoleon, during the action, and which excited his praises ; aud many another \" gallant band.\" Note 6. p. 80. 1. 13.
