I've got some medicine of my own.\" \" And who gave it you, I should like to know ? Minerva ? \" \" I should just think not, indeed ! She's a great deal too prim and proper for me.

Better leave me alone,\" continued the little rascal, bending his bow. \" If you come a step nearer, I'll shoot you ! \" \" I was only in fun, Q,\" said Venus, becoming alarmed, and tossing her long fair hair over the place where her heart was supposed to be, by way of protection. \" There, put your arrows up again like a good boy; I won't whip you this time. And what is this wonderful secret, if you please ? \" \" Well, Mummy, if you'll promise not to tell, it's Ganny.\" \" Granny ? \" returned Venus, twisting a lock of her auburn hair, still salt with the spray of prim\u00e6val oceans, round her tapering forefinger. \" Granny ! \" echoed Cupid, in disgust. \" Gods don't have grandmammas. I said Ganny \u2014 and a jolly little chap he is.\" \"Oh, I know,\" said Venus, with lofty indiffer ence\u2014\" that small boy whom Jupiter hoisted up to the skies on the back of an eagle. He's a cheeky"], [15, "INTRODUCTION 3 little wretch, I always think ; but what has he to do with your influenza ? \" \"Well, Mummy, of course you recollect the story ? \" \" Not in the least. I suppose I must have heard it some three thousand years ago, but it didn't interest me in any way whatever.\" \" Why, don't you know, when the old Jew had him carried off he was tending his father's flocks on Mount Ida \u2014 that is to say, he ought to have been tending the flocks, and that's the way they put it in all the classical dictionaries; but in reality he was leaving the flocks to tend them selves, and had climbed up a tree to steal the farmer's apples. Of course the farmer's big dog heard tell of it, and lay down and waited for him, with one eye open, at the foot of the tree \u2014 dogs always do, you know. But Ganny was a plucky little fellow, and he didn't care much for the dog \u2014 just at present. He was intending to sit quietly among the boughs and eat apples until the dog got tired of watching and went to sleep, and then hang on to a horizontal branch and drop clean on top of his head, as the fellow did in ' Peter Simple,' and brain him. Well, he'd been up the tree rather better than half-an-hour, and"], [16, "VENUS AND CUPID 4 had put away about as many golden pippins as a boy of thirteen can conveniently take without wishing he hadn't, when he heard a sort of a rush and a whizz and a whirl overhead, and looked up just in time to see a huge black imperial eagle poise himself for a moment in the air, and then swoop down and light with a great thud upon one of the topmost branches of the tree. The tree shook like a hurricane, and such a shower of apples fell to the ground that the farmer's dog, who was just dozing off to sleep, dreamed he was being pelted with brickbats, and fled howling. As for the sheep, they made for a gap in the nearest wall; and those that were not throttled in trying to get through the gap scurried down the slopes of Mount Ida like demons. Ganny hung on for his life, and just managed to keep his seat in the fork between two crooked old boughs, though it was as much as ever he could do to prevent being blown off his perch by the wind from the eagle's wings. \" ' You're a nice-looking boy,' observed the eagle, with a courteous bend of his polished beak towards Ganny. \" ' I've heard that remark before,' was the reply, 'and I'm rather sick of it. Would"], [17, "INTRODUCTION 5 you kindly say something else a little more original ? ' \" ' Oh, I'm not responsible for the remark,' said the eagle ; ' I'm only delivering a message. I don't think much of you myself. But the Jew says you are the most beautiful of mortals, and he wants you to come up aloft and be his cup bearer.' \"'And pray, who is the Jew \u2014 if I might be so bold as to enquire ? ' \" ' Why, Jupiter, of course \u2014 the great Jupiter, king of gods and men. You've heard tell of him, I suppose ? ' \" ' To be sure I have ; and a precious old rascal he appears to be.' \" ' I say, young fellow, if you talk high treason, you know, I shall be under the painful necessity of putting my beak into you.' \" ' No offence,' replied Ganny. ' I dare say he's an uncommonly correct sort of an old gentleman when you come to know him. But we boys certainly read some rather rum things about him in the mythology books at school.' \" 'All a parcel of lies,' returned the eagle. ' I assure you he's a most respectable person.' \"'Wish I'd known that before,' said Ganny."], [18, "6 VENUS AND CUPID ' It was only yesterday evening at the night school that I got caned because I couldn't remember what he did to Ixion. Next time they ask me what he did, I shall say he didn't. And so he wants me to come and be his cup bearer ? ' \"'Yes,' replied the eagle, 'and I'm to fetch you up straight away. The Jew's dining out to-night with Bacchus, and he swears he won't touch a drop of wine until you come and pour it out for him.' \" 'Well, I'm quite agreeable,' answered Ganny. ' Anyhow, it will be better fun than shying stones all day at those blessed sheep. I sup pose he'll pay me well for my trouble. What's the yearly stipend ? ' \"'I can't say,' replied the eagle; 'you must settle that with the Jew. My orders were to carry you off instanter ; so the question is, will you ride quietly on my back, or shall I dig my claws into your plump little thighs, as I do to the lambs and rabbits ? The claws are precious sharp, I can tell you. I had fresh points put on to them yesterday in Vulcan's forge. But I won't hurt you if you are good. There, put your arms well round my neck, and hang on"], [19, "INTRODUCTION 7 tight, and keep your legs clear of my wings, unless you want them broken.' \" So off they went, and Ganny was hoisted up to heaven in no time. The Jew was beginning to get wild, because he had eaten a couple of dozen salt herrings for luncheon, and had got a thirst upon him. But he vowed he wouldn't drink till Ganny came, and then he drank rather more than was good for him. Don't you recol lect, Mummy, how he threw a peck of pepper into Juno's face, because she said that Ganny was an ugly little beast, and ought to be whipped and sent home to his mother ? \" \" I recollect quite well,\" said Venus, \" and foi once I entirely agreed with her. But what has all this long story to do with your influenza ? \" \"Oh, I forgot. Why, don't you see, when Ganny was carried off, he had a big box of Quackum's Pills in each of his trousers-pockets. He had bought them at the village shop that morning for his mother on his way to work, and was going to take them home in the even ing; only, instead of taking them home, he brought them up to heaven. But while he was taking off his things, and making himself look nice to go in and wait upon Jupiter, the pills"], [20, "8 VENUS AND CUPID fell out upon the floor. So I picked them up, and Ganny said I might keep them. He says the mortals swallow one or two pills the last thing before they go to bed when they feel seedy, and wake up all right again next day. They are warranted to cure coughs and colds, and headache, and hot coppers, and anything. One evening last week, when Psyche and I had eaten too much bread and jam for tea, we took one apiece, and both got well in no time. Only I don't want anybody else to know about it, or else I shall have to serve out pills to dyspeptic deities all round, and then they'll soon be gone. Would you like to try one, Mummy ? You're not looking quite so well as usual.\" \" Perhaps a taste might do me good,\" said Venus, putting one of the pills into her mouth and sucking it. \" You horrid boy ! \" she ex claimed, after five minutes' choking and dis tortion, \"what ever have you given me? It's the nastiest stuff I ever tasted in my life ! \" Cupid screamed with laughter at his mother's grimaces. \" I said swallow, Mummy \u2014 not suck,\" said the little rogue, holding his sides, and roll ing over and over on a cloud. \" Have another, and gulp it down properly.

He was the very handsomest little fellow I ever saw, with long flaxen hair falling over his shoulders, not precisely after the manner of boys at that age in general, and yet not the least bit like the hair of any girl. There was indeed nothing effeminate about him from his head to his heels. His eyes were of a brilliant blue, but his eyelashes dark, and his eyebrows darker still ; cheeks ruddy, neck a good deal sun burnt, limbs strong and sturdy, figure well pro portioned and graceful, yet entirely boyish, and set off with that air of elasticity and spring which only a boy has at his command. I hate boys as"], [26, "VENUS AND CUPID 14 a rule, and it never entered my head to take any particular notice of such an animal before; but somehow this little beggar fascinated me with his beauty, and I felt a sort of uneasy suspicion that he must have dropped down from some other world. \"And what might be your pleasure with Mr. Thomas Cook & Son, supposing you contrive to find him ? \" I enquired, after gazing upon my young visitor with more interest than I had ever bestowed upon any boy before. \"The Jew wants him,\" replied the lad, as coolly as if he were asking the price of a rail way ticket. \"He is to take Venus and Cupid, Mars, Bacchus, Apollo, and two or three more of them, to Italy or somewhere on a personally conducted tour.\" \" Mars, Bacchus, Apollo \u2014 virorum,\" repeated I, for I had not wholly forgotten the Propria quae maribus of my boyhood. \" And pray, are Cato and Virgilius going too ? And do you propose that we should extend our travels as far as the banks of the Tigris and Orontes ? \" \"Can't say, I'm sure,\" answered the boy. \"They'll take your advice about the route. But"], [27, "AN IMPERIAL EAGLE 15 I rather think they want to go West, and see something of Central Europe.\" \"They didn't say they wanted to see the central block of a good-sized madhouse, did they ? \" I rejoined, turning the key of the desk, and putting it in my pocket. \" Now, look here, young fellow. You're a devilish smart-looking lad, and quite precociously deranged for your tender years ; but it has become my distressing duty to see that you are put under proper restraint, so do me the favour to walk with me as far as the Police Station.\" \" No, I shan't ! \" said the boy stoutly. \" The Jew sent me down here to fetch you, and you had better come. He'll make it well worth your while. If you won't, I shall have nothing to do but to go quietly back again, and you can't prevent me. In a couple of days or so you'll be split in half with a thunderbolt, and we shall simply send our party out in charge of Mr. Gaze. It doesn't make the slightest difference to me.\" \" Poor boy ! \" said I, with unaffected tenderness, stepping up to him and laying the palm of my hand against his forehead. \" Do you feel any pain about the temples when I press them ? any feverish throbbings, fits of giddiness, acute head-"], [28, "VENUS AND CUPID 16 ache, and so on ? Does your mother know you're \u2014 come to see me?\" I added, thinking perhaps it might be best to find out where the poor child lived, and take him home. \" My mother has been dead and buried these three thousand years,\" said the lad, with un blushing innocence. \"She was Queen of Phrygia, and my father was King, and he sold me to the Jew for a pair of broken-winded old cart-horses. It was a shock to my feelings at the time, but I am beginning to get over it now. The situ ation has its advantages. I'm immortal, and I get any amount of jolly good grub, and I don't have any lessons to do.\" \" Why, it must be Ganymede ! \" thought I, taking down a Lempriere from my scantily furnished bookshelves. It was necessary to keep up my classics to some superficial extent, in order that I might have an answer ready for any prig who bothered me with questions on a personally-conducted tour. \" Let me see,\" I continued, looking my young friend out \u2014 \"the most beautiful of mortals, son of Tros and Cal lirrhoe. Well, the first part of it fits in, anyhow. I'll be shot if ever I set eyes on such a boy. I suppose somebody has told him he is good-"], [29, "AN IMPERIAL EAGLE 17 looking, and called him Ganymede for chaff. A thousand pities the poor little chap should be so hopelessly insane ! \" \" Now, look here ! \" observed my mysterious visitor, with a gesture of impatience ; \" I can't wait hanging about this blessed place of business till midnight. Are you coming up with me, or are you not ? \" \"Coming up where ? \" I enquired. \"Why, to Olympus, of course. You know that's where the Jew lives as well as I do. If you don't, you'll find out all about it in that fat old dictionary, and a lot of lies besides.\" \" I am sorry to inform you, my dear boy, that Olympus is one of the places for which we don't issue tickets \u2014 at least not just at present. There is no rail, that I ever heard of; and I have reason to think that even the tramway lines are not yet laid down. Perhaps, however, you were contemplating a trip in a balloon ? \" \" Balloon ! \" repeated the boy, with contempt. \" The rotten thing would burst before we got half-way. No, sir; I can do better for you than that. I've got my eagle under a shed not half a-mile off, and he'll take the two of us, quite comfortably. He's a tremendously strong bird.\" B"], [30, "18 VENUS AND CUPID \"So I should suppose,\" observed I; \"and you left him in a shed, did you ? \" \"Yes,\" said the boy, putting on his pretty Phrygian cap and taking my hand. \"Come along; we shall be there in ten minutes. I'll show you the way.\" I have always understood that it is safest to humour mad people in their fancies up to a cer tain point, so I determined to go with the boy and see what happened. Both my clerks had already left the office and gone home ; but as I was locking the outer door I caught a glimpse of one of them coming out of a cast at the oppo site corner of the Piazza, and beckoned to him hastily. My young companion was too many for me, and observed the gesture. \" If you speak a single word to that man,\" said he, turning sharply round, \" or to anybody else, until we get into the field, I'll go off by myself, and you may look out for thunderbolts.\" The boy spoke with an assumption of quiet, cool authority which set my fingers itching to box his ears ; but it was an authority which I simply did not dare resist, and I felt myself tamely giving in. \"All right, my boy,\" I replied; \"I was only"], [31, "AN IMPERIAL EAGLE 19 going to hand him over the key of the office, in case I didn't get back in good time to-morrow morning.\" \" To-morrow's Sunday,\" said the boy, shutting me up, and astonishing me not a little by his command of the situation. \"You'll be home again all right by nine o'clock on Monday morn ing, unless you're obstinate, and put the old Jew's back up, and then I can't say what may happen. Are you married ? \" \" No,\" I replied ; \" are you ? \" This was not a mere retort. A boy who had lost his mother three thousand years ago might, for all I knew, be a great-great-grandfather. \" Rather not,\" answered the boy, laughing at the idea. \"Q is, though, and he is only about a year older than I am.\" \" And who upon earth is Q ? \" I asked, be coming more and more mystified. \"Why, Cupid, to be sure. You must be a duffer if you never heard of him. He married Psyche, you know, and rare fun we had at the wedding. Bacchus got so jolly tight that it took four demi-gods to drag him off to bed, and Aesculapius sat up half the night to mix cooling drinks for him. But, as you have got"], [32, "VENUS AND CUPID 20 no wife to sit up for you, you won't be much missed if you don't go home till \u2014 Monday morning.\" By this time we had turned into a field just outside the town, at the farther corner of which was a cow-shed. It was getting dark as we reached it, but the boy seemed to know the way, and when we were within fifty yards of the shed he whistled. By way of response there came promptly a sound of rustling wings, and a peculiar gurgling in the throat which I have every reason to believe was intended to express gratification. \" He is glad to have me back again ! \" cried the boy, with a flush of pleasure. \" You see how he'll fly at me when we get in ! \" And sure enough he did, taking his young master between his wings and folding him to his breast with the most loving embrace conceivable. In return, the boy put up his face and rubbed his cheeks affectionately against the eagle's shining beak again and again. \"What a magnificent creature!\" I exclaimed, looking at the bird with genuine admiration and no little terror. \" It is just as well you didn't leave him in the open field. He would"], [33, "AN IMPERIAL EAGLE 21 have been shot for the Museum at Athens as sure as fate.\" \"Some fellow tried it on as we came down,\" said the boy, \" but he didn't hit him. Besides, Vulcan has made both of us bullet-proof. Now, just hold the door wide open, will you, while he gets out, and then jump on his back, and I'll scramble up afterwards.\" \"Well,\" said I to myself, \"it won't be such bad fun. The creature can't do more than flutter along the ground with us, and the jolting can hardly be worse than the jog-trot of a camel.\" So I made a rush for the creature's back and threw my arms round his neck, while the boy leapt on as easily as if the bird had been a pony. The eagle spread out his enormous wings, beat them three or four times on the grass, as if to shake all stiffness out of them, and then slowly rose into the air. \"Why, he is taking us both up with him!\" I exclaimed, half dead with horror. \" To be sure he is ! \" cried the boy, laughing ; \" that's what I brought him for. Hold on steadily, and keep well in the middle of his back. You'll soon get used to the position.\" \" Stop him ! you little devil ! \" I roared out. \" If I had only a hand free I'd strangle you ! \""], [34, "VENUS AND CUPID 22 The boy only laughed the louder. \" Keep your hair on, old man,\" said he cheerily. \"You're in for it now, and the best thing you can do is to stay quiet. If you get excited and wriggle about you may tumble off, you know ; and we're five hundred feet above the plain already.\" By good luck it was now almost dark, or I should have turned giddy and lost my head. I shut my eyes, that I might not see the lights of Athens far below, and prayed what I honestly believed would be my last prayer. \" Don't you go to sleep,\" said the boy. \" I never do when I'm on the eagle's back. And whatever you do, don't get your legs in the way of his wings. It's the only thing that makes him savage ; he hates it worse than being throttled. You haven't got your arms too tight round his neck, have you ? \" \" If ever, by any improbable chance, we get safe to land again, young shaver, you and I will square accounts for this precious trick ! \" said I, feeling that the threat lost dignity by reason of my distressing shortness of breath and obvious terror. There is no mincing the matter \u2014 I was in a blue funk, and I thought that every moment my life was coming to an end."], [35, "AN IMPERIAL EAGLE 23 \" Which will it be, I wonder ? \" said I to my self, for I had not the remotest doubt that the gates of one place or the other would close upon me a few minutes hence. \" I have been a bad chap at times \u2014 there's no denying that ; and yet I have done my best to keep straight in a general sort of way.\" Then I said a collect, and then I tried to recollect a few verses of a penitential psalm ; and then I remembered that I must not die with curses on my lips, and I had just been swearing at the young companion of my flight in language more likely to be current in the bad place than the good. So I prayed that he might be converted from Paganism, which doubtless was his creed, and felt happier. \" I forgive you, my boy,\" said I, when the prayer was over. \"That's kind of you,\" was the reply; \"though I don't quite know what I've done, except putting a good job into your hands and giving you a jolly ride for nothing.\" \"You have sent me to face Eternity,\" answered I, with as much solemnity as my chattering jaws permitted. \"You can face Eternity if you please, of course,\" said my companion ; \" only I don't"], [36, "VENUS AND CUPID 24 precisely see what good you'll get by it. Better by half stay where you are.\" \" In five minutes,\" I resumed, rebuking his levity with increasing earnestness of tone \u2014 \" in five minutes at the most I shall have lost my power of holding on, and I shall fall. We must now be many miles above the surface of the earth, and my soul and body will part company before we get half-way down. My body will be picked up in the morning a shapeless mass, and my soul \u2014 well,\" I continued with emotion, \" what ever happens to it, I forgive you, as I hope to be forgiven.\" \" If you are fool enough to let go,\" answered the boy, \" it will be your own fault, not mine ; and I'm sure I can't answer for your soul, or your body either. But if you'll only be a man, and hang on for ten minutes longer, we shall be there. Can't you see a streak of light a long way off, and some figures moving about, and a lot of woolly-looking clouds ? \" \"Yes,\" answered I, making a desperate effort to open my eyes. \" I see something queer, but I can't make out what it is.\" \"It's Olympus,\" said the boy. \"We are too far off yet to tell one figure from another, but"], [37, "AN IMPERIAL EAGLE 25 Venus and Cupid are sure to be in the crowd, because they were both so keen about getting you to come ; and they'll both be awfully good to you, if you fall in with their views.\" I shut my eyes again for fear of giddiness, though the earth was out of sight and we were sailing swiftly across a sea of fleecy cloudlets. From time to time I looked up for a moment, and saw that the air was waxing visibly lighter and the group of figures growing more distinct. I now began to hope that I should escape be coming a shapeless mass ; but some other change, perhaps equally objectionable, was clearly in store for me. And what an adventure the whole thing was ! Three hours ago, as nearly as I could reckon in my present state of whirl and breath lessness, I was adding up figures at my desk ; now, if my young conductor were to be believed, I was at the gates of Olympus, and should sup with the Immortals ! At any rate, there could be no mistake about the ride on the eagle's back, and that was marvellous enough. What a yarn I should have for my friends at Athens, if ever I got safely down again !"], [38, "CHAPTER II A CONCERT OF PEACOCKS \" HERE he is, Lady Venus ! \" shouted my young guide, slipping gracefully off the eagle's back, as the great bird alighted at the foot of a marble couch, on which the goddess was reclining. In so august a presence I would fain have slipped off gracefully myself, by way of making a favour able impression ; but I was so tired and stiff that grace was out of the question. So I simply let go and tumbled, dragging with me a small cloud of fluffy feathers which had settled upon my clothes. With better luck than I deserved, I fell clumsily but softly into the arms of a nymph, who lay at her ease upon the ground with some twelve or fifteen others, in attendance upon the queen of love and beauty. \"Well, I'm sure!\" exclaimed the young lady, shaking me off, amid the laughter of the whole celestial throng. \"If this is a specimen of your sublunar manners, the sooner you go back to 26"], [39, "A CONCERT OF PEACOCKS 27 your own country the better. Why, the com monest little faun that ever whistled through a pipe would not have taken such a liberty.\" \" I beg you a thousand pardons,\" I began, taking off my hat and bending low. \"It was not an intentional rudeness, I assure you. Permit me to have the honour of wiping away a tiny feather that has presumed to settle upon your spotless and snowy shoulders.\" \"Hands off!\" cried the indignant maiden, pushing me away, while her companions laughed the louder. \" Did anybody ever see such a horror? Look at his coat, and boots, and trousers ! No pretence of a fit about any one of them. And why does he throttle himself with an ugly stiff collar ? I thought they only fastened collars on to dogs and slaves. A free man should carry his neck loose and free. I suppose at night they chain him up by it, lest he should run away. Do all the people go about like that in the lower world ? \" \"It is considered respectable to do so,\" I meekly replied, \"with all becoming deference to the exalted beings who are less elaborately clad.

I don't defend the coat, which is simply a curtain hung on a man's back as a receptacle for pockets ; or the full length trousers, in which the comeliest of legs look mean; or the collar, which, as you very justly observe, is a badge of slavery.

It forms a sort of isolated terrace high up in the heavens, and, although considerably nearer to our planet than her satellite the moon, it is never visible by day or night to the telescopic eye. The country itself is not flat, but undulating, and beautifully diversified with forest, lake, and meadow. There are no mighty rivers, but in numerable tiny streams brim-full of trout, upon which the celestial inhabitants love to feed. The lakes are thickly populated with salmon, the meadows with stock, and the forests with almost every species of game. Vines of the choicest growth and luscious fruits are cultivated in abun dance, and the harvest never fails. The country being purely agricultural, there are no gaunt factories to spoil the view, or funnels to pollute"], [53, "A PLATFORM IN THE CLOUDS 41 the air; labour is performed entirely by hand, and, as the population does not increase, there is enough for everybody. No babies are born in Olympus ; boys and girls are happy boys and girls for ever, and nobody looks an hour older to-day than he looked a thousand years ago. During my short visit to this enchanting spot I did not succeed in discovering what became of the rivers when they had reached the margin of the platform on which Olympus stands. They ought, I suppose, to topple over into some idyllic valley of the Far East, forming the loftiest water fall in the world. But, as they don't, I presume that they escape into some mysterious reservoir beneath the terrace, and are pumped up from thence by water-deities to supply the lakes anew.

Olympians as a rule are but scantily clad, and some few of the lower orders, who till the ground and tend the flocks in their pastures, are at certain seasons not clad at all. But the gods and goddesses do not appear in public as they appear in picture galleries and museums of sculpture. They wear light, though highly becoming, garments, often lavishly adorned with jewels; and both sexes are passionately fond of colour. In point of education the Olympians are behind the age. They know nothing what ever of science, and many of the lesser divini ties cannot write their names. The higher deities, however, are persons of considerable culture. They possess a library of several thousand volumes, chiefly classics, and almost exclusively Latin and Greek. Many of these are valuable editions supposed to have been burnt or lost, but in reality purloined by Mer cury from the library attached to some ancient temple. They love to read their own fabled exploits in the pages of Homer, Virgil, and Ovid. They are extravagantly devoted to music,"], [55, "A PLATFORM IN THE CLOUDS 43 although their wind and stringed instruments are somewhat primitive in construction ; but their part -singing is incomparably finer than anything of the kind which can be heard on earth ; and a chorus of boys' voices, sung there by ringing trebles that will never break, is without exception the most glorious effect of sound which art is capable of producing. Such is Olympus, all scientific fads to the contrary notwithstanding; and, if you don't be lieve that any such place exists, you are an infidel. I have been there myself, and I sup pose I ought to know. The deities grieve daily over the thought that the mortals will have nothing more to say to them. They ruled the world with a playful blending of beneficence and caprice for fifteen hundred years ; and it does not appear quite certain, in the face of wholesale misery and venerable vices and newly invented crimes, that the world is in a very much better condition than when it owned their sway.

Though wounded in spirit at our ingratitude, they accept the situation, and make no effort to regain the empire from which they have been dethroned. They bide their time, looking forward to better days, but they meddle in our affairs no more.

Once in a way, Neptune tosses the sea about until it is inconveniently rough, and sends some badly found sailing-ship to the bottom ; but our steamers paddle on in spite of him, and laugh at the stormiest of his storms. Once in a way, Mercury, never a very dignified deity, pays a flying visit to the scene of his ancient pilferings, and commits a theft for which some one else will go to prison. These interferences are, how ever, few and far between, and prove only that the gods must have their little joke, like other people.

In those well-regulated altitudes the sun always sets at six, but twilight lasts for about forty minutes longer, and at seven the immortals dine. I was beginning to wonder whether I should ever get anything to eat, when a sound as of bull-frogs in extremis smote mournfully upon my ear, and was followed up a few seconds afterwards by the appear ance of two youthful satyrs, each holding to his mouth a very short flute-shaped instrument, pierced with some half-a-dozen holes. The dole fulness of the noise which their lips emitted is inconceivable. \"That's for dinner!\" cried Ganymede, \"and 46"], [59, "IN CUPID'S DRESSING-ROOM 47 my ride has made me hungry.

The room was built entirely of marble, the walls being panelled at intervals with oblong slabs which took so high a polish that they served as mirrors. Between the slabs were fluted pilasters, tastefully picked out with gold and colour, and imitated from the antique. The columns which supported the richly coffered ceiling had gilded Corinthian capitals, and the pavement was beautifully inlaid with a mosaic of marble scraps and porphyry. Anybody could see that the architect, whoever he was, had intended to reproduce some building of the best period in ancient Rome or Athens ; and, as far as my uncultivated eye was able to gauge his work, he had succeeded both in detail and design. At the upper end of the hall stood a horse shoe table, covered with a snow-white cloth, and laden with cut-glass, porcelain, gold and silver cups, and alabaster vases. In the centre of the convex curve was a marble throne \u2014 not raised above the other seats, but distinguished by its high straight back, its elaborately sculp-"], [63, "IN CUPID'S DRESSING-ROOM 51 tured arms, and its velvet cushion. Within the gable which formed the termination of the back was an imperial eagle, inlaid with tiny squares of coloured mosaic, after the manner of Pliny's doves. I could not doubt that this seat was intended for the king of the immortals, though at the present moment it was empty. In the aisles to the right and left of the columns stood groups of divinities in conversation, while others were pacing up and down in pairs. The central portion of the hall, towards the inner side of the horse-shoe, seemed to be appropriated by the servants, who stood there motionless, under the charge of a head waiter or steward, in readiness to commence their duties at a given signal from the throne. They were all Satyrs, little encumbered with superfluous apparel ; and from the neck of each was suspended the inevi table flute, attached by a silver chain. All this, though it has supplied me with a useful page of padding, took but a few seconds to fix itself upon my mind. (Strictly speaking, I believe that the tiny squares of the mosaic eagle were fixed at a later period, when I had been permitted to examine the work of art minutely from the front of the chair.) Indeed,"], [64, "VENUS AND CUPID 52 no longer space than a few seconds was just now available ; for I had scarcely entered the room, with my lively burden upon my back, when the gods and goddesses set up a simul taneous shout of welcome, clapping their hands and laughing with delight at the somewhat re markable ingress which I had performed. \" Hadn't you better get down ? \" said I, seizing the boy's thighs and trying to shake him off my shoulders. \"They may think me disrespectful, you know.\" \" Gammon ! \" answered Cupid ; \" they are not such fools. And I'll tell them it was all my fault. They never care a farthing what I do.\" \" Bravo ! \" cried a rough, wiry old man, with mottled cheeks and shaggy hair, and a beard which fell in grisly rags half-way down his body. \" That's what I call Pegasus and Bellerophon topsy-turvy.

Cupid was furious, and not altogether with out good cause. In the first place, he had fallen badly upon a hard marble floor; in the second place, he had broken off a small cloud of pet feathers from his snow-white wings ; in the third place, he was greeted on rising with an amount of chaff and chuckling which the most angelic of tempers would find it hard to bear. And Cupid's temper was not angelic by any means. \" I'll pay you out for that to-morrow morn-"], [68, "VENUS AND CUPID 56 ing ! \" said he, limping up to me and shaking his bow in my face. \"You just wait till I get some arrows !

Do you mean to insult me, sir ? \" \"Not at all,\" said I, becoming alarmed, and wishing I had expressed the thing differently. \"I merely meant \u2014 er \u2014 desolated hearths \u2014 er \u2014 devastating armies \u2014 er \u2014 horrors of war.\" \" Horrors of war ! \" echoed Mars, becoming purple with excitement. \" I'll show you a horror or two. Will you fight, sir ? \" \" No, thank you,\" said I, receding a few steps as the warlike god squared up to me ; \" I would rather not. I should get very much the worst of it, and I am half dead with hunger.\" \" Bravo ! \" exclaimed a ruddy - faced youth, planting himself between us. \" Let him alone, Mars ; you are always trying to pick a quarrel. Praxy is our guest, and he shan't be bullied. Hope you're thirsty as well as hungry,\" he con tinued, turning to me and pointing to his ivy crown. \" I'm Bacchus, you know, and I keep the key of the wine-cellar.\" At this moment the doleful concert of pipes was heard once more, and Cupid, who seemed by this time to have half forgiven my offence, ran up and took my hand."], [70, "58 VENUS AND CUPID \" That's to tell us that the Jew's coming in,\" said he ; \" and now we shall get some dinner. I'll show you your place. You're to sit between me and Venus, at the farther end of the horse shoe.\""], [71, "59 CHAPTER V CERBERUS ENJOYS HIS DINNER THE king of the gods suffered periodically from the gout, and this was one of his periods. On such occasions he could put neither left foot nor right foot to the ground without a roar, which the mortals far below would mistake for thunder, and which even the gods preferred to encounter at the distance of a geographical mile. When the door was flung open, therefore, at the upper end of the hall, through which the awful deity was to pass, it admitted\u2014 not, as I had expected, a towering figure from which all beholders would shrink with terror, but a rather common-looking old man, borne by four slaves in a black and yellow sedan-chair, beween two long poles. The process of getting the old gentleman out of this time-honoured conveyance was somewhat tedious, and the delay a source of no small anxiety to the expectant diners. For if anything went the least bit wrong the consequences might"], [72, "60 VENUS AND CUPID be appalling. Should even the tiniest of the monarch's toes come in contact with anything harder than a velvet cushion, a noise might follow which would clear the whole dinner-table of its crockery and glass, and quite conceivably cause to totter in their bases the very columns of the banquet hall. As for the company and the attendant Satyrs, if the drums of their ears were not broken beyond all possibility of repair, at the very least they would be deafened upon the spot, and rendered incapable of carrying on an audible conversation for several weeks to come. As good luck would have it, however, nothing went wrong at all. The transfer from the sedan chair to the marble throne was managed without the slightest hitch, and the deity himself looked all the better for the change. A sedan-chair does not confer dignity upon its inmate. The jerky up-and-down motion which the patient must needs undergo is fatal to all assumption either of importance or ease; while the bystander is never quite able to look with reverence on a magnate who is so obviously at his bearers' mercy, that it is impossible to avoid the con templation of his ultimate deposition in the nearest pond."], [73, "CERBERUS ENJOYS HIS DINNER 61 Seated upon a marble throne, on the other hand, especially if an imperial eagle be inlaid or sculp tured at the back of it, a man of average presence has an even chance of making people believe that he is somebody ; and Jupiter, as he presided at the horse-shoe table, with his noble head of iron grey hair, his flashing eye, his finely cut majestic features, and his flowing beard, looked every inch the Jupiter of my mythological dreams. Behind him stood the four slaves who had carried the monarch into the saloon, while on a stool at his right hand sat my youthful friend the cup-bearer, in readiness to do his office at a sign from his royal master. Ganymede still wore his knicker bocker suit, Jupiter having taken a fancy to it ; and beyond all doubt, in spite of our present idolatry of the public school uniform, it is by many degrees the most becoming dress which any boy can wear. A lad of twelve or fourteen who can look well in a pair of baggy pepper-and salt trousers, short tight jacket, ill-fitting lumpy collar, and chimney-pot or saucepan hat, must be endowed by Nature with such transcendent gifts of person that he would look well in any thing. We laugh at the tyranny which forces French and Italian boys to strut about in uniform"], [74, "62 VENUS AND CUPID like pigmy soldiers. Surely the tyranny of a civil uniform is just as bad. \" Come along ! \" said Cupid, still holding my hand ; \" before we begin dinner you must be presented to the Jew.\" \"Shall I kneel to him,\" I enquired, \"and kiss his hand ? \" \" I think he would take it kindly,\" was the reply; \"but, for goodness gracious' sake, don't kiss his toes. He wouldn't take that kindly at all ; he'd raise a yell that would send us all to perdition. Though, for the matter of that, you can't get at them, for they're tucked well under the table.\" So saying, he led me round the horse-shoe to the left elbow of the throne, beside which I sank upon my knees and bent my head submis sively. I felt very much as if it were going to be cut off, and wished I had courage to raise my eyes, lest the blow should fall instanter. It would be satisfactory at any rate to have a moment's warning, so that one might offer up some sort of prayer. But I was positively in such a blessed funk that I did not dare look up at anybody. \"It's Praxy, my lord,\" said Cupid; \"the"], [75, "CERBERUS ENJOYS HIS DINNER 63 fellow that Ganny brought up from the Piraeus on the eagle's back \u2014 and a jolly good fellow, too.\" Jupiter smiled. \" Is that the way you present a mortal to the King of Olympus ? \" he asked, pinching the boy's cheek affectionately. \"Why didn't Mercury come forward and make a proper speech of introduction, worthy of our presence, and of the illustrious guest whom we are enter taining ? \" \" Because Mercury is so precious long winded,\" answered the lad, \"and while he was boring your Majesty to death the soup would be getting cold. I knew your Majesty was hungry, so I thought the fewer words the better. Praxy wants to kiss your hand, my lord, and then he wants his dinner.\" \" Let the mortal rise,\" said Jupiter, holding out his left hand, upon which I pressed my lips with due respectfulness. It was a hard, cold hand, divinely shaped, of course, but with a texture of bronze, and a cruel crunching look about the fingers. The mortal rose accordingly, rejoicing at his release, and was conducted to his seat at the left end of the horse-shoe."], [76, "64 VENUS AND CUPID \"You mustn't sit down yet,\" said Cupid; \" Mercury is going to say grace. But he won't be long about it, after the broad hint I gave him just now.\" Jupiter raised his awful right hand, and the entire company stood up in silence, each one at the back of his own chair. Mercury mumbled a few words which I could not catch, and was pro ceeding to mumble a good many more, when the awful hand struck the table, and the grace was over. \" It's an invocation to Ceres and Bacchus,\" explained Cupid, \" and he is obliged to say something different every evening. If ever he repeats himself he goes -without his dinner. But Bacchus came off second best this time, for his name was scarcely out of Mercury's mouth when the Jew cut the whole thing short, more power to him ! I hope the merry god won't take it amiss and knock off the liquor.\" The Satyrs now bustled about their work, and we all fell to. The steward stood at a small side table ladling out the soup, which was handed to the guests from the concave of the horse-shoe. To this succeeded fish, in orthodox terrestrial fashion ; and although the creature was of a"], [77, "CERBERUS ENJOYS HIS DINNER 65 shape and colour which I do not remember having seen before, I never wish to eat a better. Conversation flagged while appetite enforced its claims, and there was practically a dead silence during the first two courses. A dead silence at dinner has always struck me as intolerably oppressive, and even in the dread company of the gods I could not resist the impulse to break it. \" I thought you people \u2014 I beg your pardon,\" said I \u2014 \" I thought you sublime divinities only ate ambrosia.\" \" Ha, ha, ha ! \" burst out Jupiter, with a roar which upset every drinking-cup on the table. No wine was spilt, however, none having yet been served. \"That's the reason we don't drink out of glass,\" observed Cupid, in a half-whisper, put ting his head close to mine; \"it would all get smashed in no time. Do you see those little round trays hung by chains from the ceiling? There's one within reach of everybody.\" \" Yes,\" said I, \" I see them. What are they meant for ? \" \"Why, sometimes he sulks, you know, and never opens his mouth except to eat his food, E"], [78, "66 VENUS AND CUPID and then we can safely keep our goblets on the table. But when he's lively, as he appears to be to-night, we stick them up there. If he makes a row, the chain vibrates for a minute or two, and the tray swings gently up and down, but the cup stands firm. Put yours up presently, when you get the chance ; but don't do it while the Jew's looking at you ; it makes him savage.\" I took the earliest opportunity of adopting this wise precaution, and I noticed that my example was very generally followed. The act was, how ever, invariably performed by stealth, in a sort of absent manner, while Jupiter happened to be busy with his knife and fork, or looking the other way. \" Who told you that fool's nonsense ? \" asked Mars, turning fiercely round at me. \" It's posi tively insulting.\" \" Shut up, Spears and Battle-axes ! \" said Jupiter. \"I won't have the mortal bullied. If you want to fight, go out and have a round with Hercules. We shan't miss you.\" \" I read it first,\" said I, \" in Keightley's Mythology, when I was a boy at school, and I never heard it contradicted. Everybody in the lower world believes it. But I shall have a"], [79, "CERBERUS ENJOYS HIS DINNER 67 different story to tell when I go back to my own diggings.\" \" Ambrosia is bear's grease,\" said Vulcan ; \"we put it on our hair.\" \" Speak for yourself, you ruffian ! \" said Juno. \" / don't put anything of the sort. I put Macassar oil.\" \"And plenty of it,\" observed Venus, standing up for her spouse \u2014 \" enough to grease a cart-wheel.\" \"Or a blacksmith's bellows,\" retorted Juno. \" Come, come ! \" said Minerva ; \" these recrimi nations are unwise. And when we have satis fied our hunger with this curious comestible, what are we supposed to take after it, sir, by way of washing it down ? \" \" Nectar, madam.\" \" That's the stuff I give to Cerberus,\" said Pluto, \" when he's got the worms. You haven't seen my dog Cerberus, have you, sir ? \" \" No,\" said I, with a shudder, curiosity giving way to a dread of everlasting nightmares ; \" and, if you don't mind, I'd just as soon I didn't.\" \"We'll have him in presently,\" said Pluto, \"when there are some bones going. At this early stage of dinner there are no scraps handy for the poor beggar to eat.\""], [80, "68 VENUS AND CUPID \" I suppose he gets through a pretty big plate ful,\" observed I, \" with three mouths to feed ? \" \" I believe you,\" was the reply \u2014 \" most expen sive animal. But there is generally enough for him, except when Diana brings in one of her pet greyhounds, who puts my beast's three noses out of joint.\" As a pleasing diversion to this topic, a choir of boys and rural deities noAV began to sing glees and madrigals from a low gallery at the other end of the hall; and lovelier vocal music I never heard. \" Glass of wine, sir ? \" said Bacchus, filling his goblet at the termination of the first glee, and sending a Satyr with a jug of liquor to my end of the table. \" With the greatest pleasure,\" I returned ; and we drank each other's health most cordially. \" Is that bin to your liking, sir ? \" continued the jovial god. \" If not, we'll try another.\" \" Excellent,\" said I ; and then we had a general drink all round, in which everybody joined, except Vesta, who is a total abstainer. The dinner consisted chiefly of made dishes, the only joint being roast kid, which was gar nished with cream-cheese and honey. Cupid"], [81, "CERBERUS ENJOYS HIS DINNER 69 told me the name of every course as it appeared ; but I thought it would look rude to make notes at table, and there was unfortunately no menu. If there had been one, I would have brought it away with me, and forwarded it with much plea sure to the chef at the Criterion. I could only detect one flaw in the perfection of the cookery. The gods are fond of garlic, and the salad was uneatable. While the roast kid was being consumed, Pluto sent a message across to Jupiter, who nodded almost imperceptibly in return. Cupid, who followed everything with his roguish eyes, nudged me on the elbow. \" Did you see that ? \" asked the boy. \" If he had nodded his head a little lower, there'd have been an earthquake, and the roof would have fallen in.\" \" This appears to be rather a dangerous sort of old gentleman,\" I observed, whispering back again. \" I don't mind telling you in confidence that I' shan't be sorry when he leaves the room.\" \" He won't leave it yet awhile,\" was the reply. \" He'll stow away another gallon or so of wine before he goes ; and when he's three parts screwed,"], [82, "VENUS AND CUPID 70 a lot of us will fall upon him and badger him into giving his consent to this personally con ducted tour.\" Meanwhile the Satyr who took Pluto's message had left the hall, leaving the door open behind him. After a short interval I heard the rattling of a heavy chain, and then Pluto whistled. A moment afterwards there came a scamper and a shuffling of feet, and the most ungainly monster that ever tormented St. Anthony in his wildest dreams rushed like a hurricane into the room. \" There ! \" said Pluto, as the creature came sniffing round the table on the look-out for bones. \" I dare say you never saw a dog with three heads before. Fine beast, isn't he ? \" I knew it would not do to faint ; so I made a tremendous effort, and pulled myself together. Cupid, who saw that I was as pale as a ghost, considerately had my goblet filled with wine, and made me drink off a bumper. I had scarcely done so, when the stimulating powers of the liquor were put pretty severely to the test. In his progress from seat to seat, the dog wedged himself in betAveen myself and my young neigh bour, giving a lateral head to each, and seizing Avith his central set of teeth the leg of an un-"], [83, "CERBERUS ENJOYS HIS DINNER 71 fortunate little kid off which I had just been dining. I drew back my hand with horror, and the brute snapped savagely, but by great good luck just missed me. Cupid meanwhile was trying to put the beast into a good humour by caressing the head in his possession ; an effort to which it responded with a whine. It was so perfectly horrible to see three heads on one body all going at once, and each one differently employed, that I could stand the thing no longer. My own head tottered on my shoulders, and finally fell over into the lap of Venus, who sat by my right side. \"Call him off, Pluto,\" said Venus, lifting me up; \"it's too much for the poor fellow. Cerby is a little rough, you know, at times.\" Pluto good-naturedly complied, and banished his favourite to the inner side of the horse-shoe, where he was accommodated with a huge pile of bones. I hastened to apologise for my weak ness, assuring the god that I had already con ceived a strong affection for Cerberus, but found some little difficulty in patting three heads at a time with equally distributed favour. \" Might I ask,\" I continued, by way of dis-"], [84, "VENUS AND CUPID 72 playing as much concern in the animal as pos sible, \" what he is doing up here at all ? I thought he was supposed to be on guard at the gates of Hades.\" \"So he is,\" was the reply; \"but just now, you see, he's on leave. A dog may have a holiday, I imagine, as well as his betters. And he has left his snakes behind him. They do pretty well.\" \" Pity,\" I rejoined, wishing to be ciahI ; \" I should like to have seen the snakes.\" And as I looked across at the monster, crunching the bones with his hideous jaws, each one in a different phase of distortion, I felt persuaded that the additional embellishment of a couple of snakes entwined round his body would ha\\re finished me then and there."], [85, "73 CHAPTER VI JUPITER ISSUES A DECREE THE dinner ran its course as dinners usually do, the scale of conviviality going up as the liquor went down. Bacchus tapped his oldest cask in my honour, and gods and goddesses vied with each other in doing justice to the cheer. I was perfectly astounded at the amount which even the ladies could put away, and apparently with out fear of penalties. Their cheeks were not pimply, neither were their voices hoarse, nor their eyes bloodshot, nor their noses purple. Venus herself, on Avhose left hand I enjoyed the dis tinction of being placed, had filled three goblets to my one, and emptied them with transparent satisfaction ; and yet she would wake in the morning without a \"head,\" and look as beautiful as ever. Even Cupid, a little imp not fourteen years of age, had disposed of two gallons at the least, and was as bright and boyish as if he never tasted anything stronger than toast and water."], [86, "VENUS AND CUPID 74 And when I considered that they had done the same thing every day of their lives for several thousand years, I realised, as I had never done before, the deplorable weakness of mortality. Cerberus also, having made ruthless havoc with his heap of bones, began to show symptoms of thirst, and raised his central head appealingly to his master. A sound as of many garglers was emitted from the creature's throat, and it would have been hard to misunderstand his meaning. Pluto at any rate understood it well enough, and caused his favourite to be supplied with a pail of water. The Satyr who brought it was for taking away the plate of bones, under the impression that the beast's hunger was appeased ; but Cerberus kneAv better. He gave a growl which put the Satyr to speedy flight, and fell upon his food with renewed voracity. I shall never forget the five minutes which then ensued. To see the head on the right lapping water noisily from a bucket, and the head on the left devouring bones, while the head in the centre barked defiance at the retreating Satyr, was a feat of canine dexterity which will come back to me, I fear, in many a troubled dream. \" I do wish you'd get that beast sent back to"], [87, "JUPITER ISSUES A DECREE 75 his kennel, or, better still, to hell,\" said I, in an undertone, to Cupid. \" It makes me almost sick to look at him.\" \" I will, as soon as he has done feeding,\" was the reply. \" But look out \u2014 here comes Ganny.\" Turning my head, I saw that the boy was walking towards me, bearing a golden cup full to the very brim. \"Jupiter wants to take wine with you,\" said he. \"You must stand up clear of your chair, and bow, and then drain the goblet at one draught, and I'll come again and fetch it. Mind you do exactly as I tell you, or there'll be a scrimmage. I must go back now and fill the cup for Jupiter. And I say, Q,\" continued he, advancing another step, and speaking in a hurried whisper, \" the Jew's been drinking like a fish, so if you've any business to do with him, you'd better come and do it straight away, while the old man's capable. In another twenty minutes he may be too far gone.\" It was all very well to say, \" Stand up clear of your chair,\" but I was by no means certain that I could do it. I had already drunk so much that although my head was clear enough for purposes of rational conversation, my legs felt stiff and groggy ; and a sudden rise to the feet, in the"], [88, "VENUS AND CUPID 76 midst of a jovial gathering, is seldom achieved with perfect steadiness of posture. Besides, that beastly dog had upset me altogether, and I was fitter to go to bed than to stand erect and drink off a solemn pint of wine. However, I went through the ordeal as best I could, and gave apparent satisfaction ; for Jupiter bestowed upon me an affectionate, not to say drunken, smile, and the company greeted the exchange of toasts with a round of uproarious cheering which I thought would never end. Gratifying as I felt the compliment to be, its effect was somewhat marred by the performance of a three-part solo on the musical jaws of Cerberus as the last echoes of the chorus were dying away. The brute raised all three heads together in the air, and delivered himself of a horribly discordant howl which seemed to express the agonies of ten thousand souls in torment, and was probably a well-studied imitation of their groans. This was the last of his exploits ; for even the gods set limits to their patience, and Jupiter ordered him to be expelled. The question was, who should expel him ? Ten Satyrs would not have got him out, three to each head, and one to push behind. Pluto"], [89, "JUPITER ISSUES A DECREE 77 was trying to coax or threaten the beast into tractability, when Jupiter swore he would have no more fuss about the matter, and summarily commanded Pluto to retire, and take his cursed dog with him. This was the signal for a general break-up. Juno strolled into the garden to feed her peacocks, and Ceres went to settle with the housekeeper for last week's supply of flour. Vesta struck a light and led the way to the library, where Minerva consulted ancient autho rities on the relation between the signs of the zodiac and the hooting of owls. Vulcan limped out to his forge, where Castor and Pollux were waiting impatiently to have their horses shod, before starting on their customary midnight ride. Bacchus was carried off to bed, singing in coherently, and brandishing a leathern bottle in the air; Mars, to my great relief, went off to make preparations for a cock-fight which he was going to superintend next day ; while the rest of the deities adjourned to the skittle ground, and swore and cheated and squabbled over their game until the small hours of the morning. \"Why the devil didn't you come before?\" shouted Castor angrily, as Vulcan hobbled into"], [90, "78 VENUS AND CUPID the forge. \"We've been standing here an hour or more. What's the use of keeping a black smith's shop if you don't attend to business ? If you're above your work, better say so, and retire from the trade, and strut about Olympus like a gentleman.\" \"Precious little strutting to be done with a game leg,\" observed Pollux. \" Now, just look sharp, will you, and shoe these horses ! \" \" I shan't shoe your horses,\" said Vulcan ; \" I'll see you shod yourselves first. And for two pins I'd shoe the both of you with red-hot nails. I'm not bound to slave for a couple of demi-gods who came out of a broken egg-shell.\" \" What, quarrelling ! \" exclaimed Mars, as he swaggered into the forge on his way home \u2014 \"that's very sad. Birds in their little nests agree, you know. Better tell me all about it. I'm the man to make up differences.\" \"Why, Vulcan won't shoe our horses,\" said the twins, speaking together. \"Then Vulcan shall fight Castor,\" said Mars, \" and the man who comes off best shall fight Pollux, and I'll fight the winner.\" \" A-a-all the winnaws ! \" cried Bacchus, whose small procession was passing by. \" Take me in"], [91, "JUPITER ISSUES A DECREE 79 there, boys, and put me down by the fire. We won't go home till morning \u2014 we won't go home till morning ! \" But whether the fight came off, and how it ended, and what time they all got home, must be left to the imagination of the reader, for our business is with the gods and goddesses in the dining-hall. \" Now's the time ! \" cried Cupid, springing off his seat ; \" there's nobody left but the would-be personally conducted. Let's go at him while we have the chance, and get the whole thing arranged.\" So saying, he took my hand and led me to the throne, the five remaining deities following in groups of two and three. \"You don't walk very straight, Praxy,\" said the boy, in a chaffing tone, as I involuntarily reeled the least little bit against his shoulder; \" and yet you haven't drunk a third part as much as I have. But whatever you do, don't tread on the tip of my wings, or you'll smash a lot more feathers, and they're terribly out of joint already. That was a wicked spill you gave me before dinner, Praxy ! \" \" I am so tremendously sorry,\" said I ; \" please forgive me.

But you mustn't raise any difficulties about the tour, or we shall fall out in earnest.\" By this time we had all placed ourselves in position \u2014 Venus, Neptune, and Apollo on the right of the chair; Diana, Mercury, and Cupid on the left. Ganymede stood a little in the background behind the former group, while I established myself on a similar spot behind the latter, and exchanged grins with the young cup bearer. I was not so terribly frightened as I had been a couple of hours ago. Possibly the juice of the grape had given me courage. \"And what's all this tomfoolery about?\" growled Jupiter, waking up from a semi-inebriate doze. \" We want you to let us go away for a little change of air,\" began Venus. \"We are none of us feeling very well.\" \"Not feeling very well ? Send for Aescula pius, then. If he does not make you all well in less than a week, he shall drink a quart of black draught before breakfast every morning for a hundred years.\""], [93, "JUPITER ISSUES A DECREE 81 \" It would serve him jolly well right,\" said Cupid, \" for he's a very one-horse practitioner. He can't even cure the gout that has settled in his Majesty's imperial toes.\" \" Does his Majesty suffer from gout ? \" I timidly inquired. \"Yes, he does,\" replied Jupiter, \"and he has got a twinge upon him now. Do you know of anything that is good for it, O square-coated mortal ? \" \"Several things, my lord. Eno's Fruit Salt, taken in minute doses, is said to be very good indeed. So is Dinneford's Fluid Magnesia.\" \" Has the mortal got any of these drugs in one of his capacious pockets ? \" asked the cloud compeller. \" No, my lord ; but I could send you half-a dozen bottles of each if your Majesty would provide the means of transport.\" \" Fetch round the eagle at once, boy,\" said the deity, turning to his favourite, \"and take the mortal back to the lower world again, and bring me up the bottles.\" Ganymede left the room that instant, for obedience is prompt when the king of the gods commands. Personally, I was well pleased at F"], [94, "82 VENUS AND CUPID the turn which things were taking. I would gladly have washed my hands of the personally conducted tour, and did not care to hear the project discussed at all ; but I was really anxious to get back to the Piraeus by office hours on Monday morning. There was just time to do it if we started pretty soon. Venus and Cupid, however, did not like the turn which things were taking at all. They looked first at one another, and then at me \u2014 the boy turning round and fixing his great eyes upon me with such an imploring gaze, that I swore solemnly to myself I would stand by him. \" Minute doses of fruit salt seven times a day, my lord, and a wine-glassful of fluid magnesia half-an-hour before every meal. No gout can stand against that. It all comes from the liver.\" \"And what boon does the mortal ask in return for this service ? \" demanded Jupiter, who appeared to have shaken off entirely the effects of his deep potations at the prospect of relief from his pains. \"Would he like a situa tion as demi-god to mix drugs for Aesculapius, or get up speeches for Mercury, or play second fiddle to Apollo ? \""], [95, "JUPITER ISSUES A DECREE 83 \"Your Majesty does me too great an honour,\" I replied, pinching myself in the leg to subdue a rising smile. \" For neither of those exalted functions is your servant qualified.

The boy almost cried as he mounted with his bottles on the eagle's back, and we said good-bye a dozen times while he rose slowly in the air. But he soon passed out of sight, and soon afterwards out of even shouting distance, and I could hear nothing but a strong, swift beat ing of wings as the bird soared upwards into the sky. I went back to my rooms to get a good night's rest, and in the morning resumed my office work, unable, however, to think seriously of anything else except my remarkable adventure. The days wore on, and the week drew near to its close, and I remembered that on this very Saturday evening the eight immortals were to present themselves at my office door. In spite of my firm persuasion that they would never come, I found myself strolling down after dinner to the Piazza, round which I sauntered pensively in the cool spring air for upwards of an hour. \" What a fool I am ! \" said I to myself, turning at last to go home again. \" What a fool I am to think of keeping such an insane appointment as"], [109, "MERCURY GOES OUT SHOPPING 97 this ! Why, of course I shall never set eyes on any one of them again.\" I had scarcely finished muttering the words, when I set eyes on all the eight together. The miserable street-lamp did not enable me to make out clearly which was which ; but I recognised Cupid at a glance, and a huge square-shouldered figure in the background must of necessity be Hercules, whom I had not seen before. \" Run you to earth at last, old fox ! \" said Diana, coming forward and slapping me on the shoulder, while the others shook me cordially by the hand. \" Delighted to see you all ! \" I exclaimed, not feeling quite satisfied that the expression was sincere. \"Won't you come into my little den and sit down for a few minutes ? It's close by.\" So I led the way to the office, let everybody in, lighted my lamp, and found chairs enough for all my guests except Cupid, who made himself very much at home upon the table. \" Will you take anything after your walk, ladies and gentlemen ? \" I continued. \" There is no kitchen or cellar on the spot, you know, because I only come here to do my work, and live elsewhere ; but to the extent of a biscuit G"], [110, "98 VENUS AND CUPID and a glass of claret or Madeira, or even a brandy and soda, I can always accommodate my friends.\" \"I should like a brandy very much,\" said Bacchus. \" And I should like a soda,\" said Apollo. \"And I should like a mixture of both,\" said Cupid. \" I say, Praxy, what a remarkably amiable person you are ! \" By way of continuing to merit so flattering an opinion, I fished out bottles and decanters and glasses and biscuit-tins, and made as hospitable a display of good things as my limited resources would allow. It is only fair to admit that the contents of my poor little cupboard were to the full appreciated. In fifteen minutes at the most my divine guests had cleaned me out, leaving neither biscuit in its tin nor drop of liquor in its bottle. When the last of the Huntley and Palmers had been devoured, Cupid carefully ab stracted all the paper lining from the tin, so as to give himself fair play, coaxed the remaining crumbs into a corner, emptied them into the hollow of his left hand, and took them up dex terously with his tongue. After this marvel lous exhibition of all-round voracity, I could"], [111, "MERCURY GOES OUT SHOPPING 99 only hazard the conclusion that my distinguished visitors had not dined. \" Got any more biscuits, Praxy ? \" asked Cupid, brushing off a few stray crumbs which had lingered on his chin.

And what in the world was I to do with them ? \" I am surprised that Jupiter let you come,\" resumed I, going back to one of the office desks and leaning up against it, while I swept my visitors with a glance intended to be equally expressive of contempt and indignation. Gods as they were, I was far too angry just now to be afraid of them. \" He must have known very well that you couldn't get the money, and in that case he should have kept you up in the clouds.

Some of you may perhaps like to take a short walk in the town, but there is very little to see.\" \" I think we had better stay indoors,\" said Mercury, looking round for an opinion. \" I think so too,\" said I, bestowing one. \" I don't know what you mean, I'm sure,\" said Mercury, beginning to be annoyed. \" Is it far to the landing-place ? \""], [128, "VENUS AND CUPID 116 \" A few yards only,\" I replied, \" and there is a charming saloon down below.\" It fortunately happened that I had ready money enough in hand to pay all the fares to Brindisi ; and, as I did my own private banking with the firm, I could draw at the office there for any amount I might require. I finished my packing, took leave of my landlady, looked in upon my clerks, who were on duty even on Sunday for an hour or so when a steamer ran, and at nine o'clock precisely joined my friends in the sitting-room at the hotel. They had employed their time in playing cards, and not one of them had shown his face or figure at the doorway. Cupid, rather to his disgust, was not allowed even to stand at the window and kill flies. The police are a sleepy lot at Athens, and I got my gods and goddesses on board Avithout let or hindrance. It was as great a relief to me as it could have been to themselves. A newsboy shoved off with us in the boat that took pas sengers on board, and I bought the Athenian Gazette. Under the heading of local news was a paragraph announcing the daring theft of eight suits of clothes, with underclothing from the"], [129, "NEPTUNE LIES ATHWART-SHIPS 117 largest warehouse at Athens, three days ago. Five of the suits were for men, two for women, and one was a set of knickerbocker flannels for a boy. A hatter on the same day had missed eight hats of various forms and sizes, corre sponding with the details given above ; while a bootmaker made a similar complaint regarding eight pairs of shoes. As soon as we were fairly off, and the deities had judged it safe to venture on deck after their seclusion in the saloon, I passed the journal on to Mercury, and watched his expressive countenance as he read the para graph in question. The expressive countenance turned decidedly pallid, and the expressive eyes looked up and met my own. The light-fingered god saw plainly that I knew all about it, and faintly returned my sympathetic smile. \"You won't say a word, Praxy, will you?\" said he, crossing over and sitting beside me, while he laid his hand nervously upon my arm. \"My good fellow,\" said I, \"it's nothing to me where you got your clothes, so long as they fit you ; and I must say you have shown consum mate taste in your choice of shapes and colours. But there must be no more of it, if you please."], [130, "118 VENUS AND CUPID You can't fly off and make yourself invisible any longer, and there is probably no other country in the world where you would have got safely on board the steamer. Unless you wish to spend the best part of your tour in prison, refrain from the exercise of your divine but dangerous gift until you get back to heaven.\" There were between twenty and thirty first saloon passengers on board, many of whom were considerably impressed with the very remark able personal appearance of my friends. People thrown together in a steamer become frequently quite intimate enough to carry on the most ani mated conversations, without knowing, or even caring to know, each other's names ; and it was not until we stood off Zante that anybod}' thought of enquiring who the mysterious strangers were. \" Of course your real name can't be Venus,\" said a gentlemanly-looking man of seven or eight and twenty, upon Avhom the Avonderful beauty of the goddess had already begun to take effect. \" It is, I assure you,\" was the reply, \" and I have no other.\" \" Not even a surname ? \" \" No, not even a surname, that I ever heard of.

How else was I to get rid of her ? As a matter of fact, I never miss a run \u2014 that is, when I'm at home. I suppose, by way of keeping up the farce, that's Diana.\" \" That's Diana, and a particular friend of mine, so you must be civil to her. She's the only goddess down here except myself; all the rest are gods.\" \" But I do so wish you'd tell me the truth about yourself. You must have a surname.\""], [132, "VENUS AND CUPID 120 \" I haven't, really,\" answered Venus, in a tone of the most solemn truthfulness. \" If you don't choose to believe me, I can't convince you.\" \" Of course I don't believe you,\" he rejoined ; \" you are playing with me. And if there's one thing I hate more than another, it is being treated like a child.\" \" Nobody would dream of treating you so, I'm sure ; you are far too manly and clever. How do you come to talk Greek so perfectly ? \" \" I used to be at the Legation,\" explained Lord Alconbury. \" I shouldn't speak it otherwise. It's a language which very few Englishmen take the trouble to learn. But your Greek is a deal more classical than mine, and I notice that you never use Turkish or Italian words. Of course you speak French as well ? \" \" Not a syllable,\" was the reply. \" Greek is the only language I ever heard spoken in my life. They talk no other in \u2014 that is, where I live, you know.\" \" In Olympus, I suppose you mean. Well, it really is too bad. I am beginning to be offended.\" So he took off his hat and walked away. They would go on like this for hours, but he"], [133, "NEPTUNE LIES ATHWART-SHIPS 121 never got any further towards the solution of the mystery. All the ship could see that he was madly in love ; and if she would only have given him a rational name to call her by, I verily believe he would have proposed before we reached Corfu. \" I can't make out your team,\" he observed on the second morning, strolling up to me. \"The mischief is, they not only act the part quite faultlessly, but they look the character to perfection. If they merely stood in a row and posed, without uttering a syllable, any schoolboy could pick them out and say which was which. I never was so much bothered in my life. Now look here,\" he continued, draw ing me into a quiet corner, \" I don't intend to ask any question that a man ought not to ask, but I should feel deeply grateful to you if you would tell me frankly whether this Venus, as she calls herself, is the sort of woman whom a man like myself might ask to be his wife. It's a matter of more consequence to me than you may perhaps imagine.\" \" I wouldn't do it if I were you, my lord. I'd sooner go a thousand miles away, and forget that I had ever seen her. I can't, and won't, say more"], [134, "VENUS AND CUPID 122 than that, but that means as much as words can be made to mean.\" \"Thank you,\" said he, squeezing my hand; \" you are a good, kind fellow.\" And as he turned his head to go down the ladder I saw that there were tears in his eyes. As may readily be imagined, Cupid was an immense joke on board. The ladies went ab solutely wild over the boy; and his ridiculous name, and persistent refusal to be called by any other, gave them an excuse for going any lengths they pleased in petting him. As Lord Alconbury had said, they looked their characters to perfection, and Cupid looked his best of all. Until touching at the last Greek port the weather had been lovely, and the sea as smooth as the Danube at Passau ; but towards the small hours of the morning, after putting off from Corfu, the wind got up suddenly, and we walked straight out into a nasty chopping sea. The steamer pitched abominably, and three-fourths of the passengers were laid low. \" Where's Father Neptune ? \" said the first officer to me when I went on deck about seven o'clock to get some coffee. \"This is just the sort of weather for him. He ought to be along-"], [135, "NEPTUNE LIES ATHWART-SHIPS 123 side of the captain on the bridge, commanding the waves.\" \" So he ought,\" holloaed out the captain ; \"send down and fetch him. His beard will wag magni ficently in this breeze.\" I ran down the ladder, turned into the saloon, and drew the curtain of Neptune's \" state-room,\" as the Americans euphoniously call a wretched den, some six feet by four, into which first-class passengers by sea are crowded. There were three berths in it \u2014 two, one above another, parallel with the bulkhead, and a single one opposite, placed at right angles. In the former lay Mercury and Apollo, sleeping soundly ; in the latter sat up Neptune, whose attribute at present appeared to be, not a trident, but a round tin utensil with a short handle, and who looked the very image of a respectable old gentleman from the City, who has come abroad for the sake of his family, but has never been to sea before. Cupid and I had a cabin between us; while Hercules, who was two feet longer and eight inches broader than the roomiest berth in the ship, had appropriated two lengths of a cushioned sofa which surrounded the saloon, and made himself tolerably comfortable. As for Bacchus,"], [136, "VENUS AND CUPID 124 it is my opinion that he never turned in at all He had made friends with the steward, and passed a considerable portion of the night in consuming rum-and-water. \"Why, how's this, Neptune ? \" I enquired, with genuine astonishment. \"You are the very last man I should have expected to find in this melan choly plight. Lying athwart-ships, too ! Surely you ought to know better than that. Enough to make anybody ill. You should have put one of the land-lubbers into that berth. Can I do any thing for you ? \" \" No, thanks ; I'm very bad. It's fifteen hun dred years, you know, since I was at sea, and everything is so much changed. I don't like the steam, and the smells, and the thumping of the screw.\" \" Well, but you must rouse yourself, my good fellow, and make an effort to be jolly. What will everybody think of you ? The captain wants you on the bridge ; he has just sent me down to fetch you. I can't go and tell him you are sea-sick ; he'll never believe me. Drink a brandy-and-soda, and come on deck like a man.\" After a series of sad relapses I got my poor"], [137, "NEPTUNE LIES ATHWART-SHIPS 125 friend on deck, and gave him in charge to the first officer, who passed him on to the captain. \" So here you are at last, Neptune ! \" said the latter cheerily; \"you're just the man I wanted. Come up on the bridge and help me to rule the waves. They're devilish disagreeable this morning. Every three minutes or so the bows are swept with spray, and if I hadn't got on a waterproof I should be drenched to the skin.\" \"Can't recollect just now the words I used to calm the sea with,\" said Neptune feebly; \"it's so very long ago. And I don't feel at home on board these blessed steamers; they bother me entirely.\" \"We've gone ahead of you, old man, haven't we ? But you're not looking yourself this morn ing. Is anything the matter ? \" \"A little out of sorts, that's all. Some of the cook's Italian messes have disagreed with me. I think, captain, if you don't mind, I'll go down and fetch my pocket-handkerchief; I left it in the cabin.\" \"Pocket-handkerchief! What the devil does an ancient mariner like you want with a pocket handkerchief? Besides, I could send a dozen fellows for it. What's your number ? \""], [138, "VENUS AND CUPID 126 \" I would rather go myself,\" said Neptune, clinging nervously to the rails as he descended ; and when the captain beheld him, a few seconds later, leaning over the gunwale in dire distress, he had good cause to rejoice that he had not detained him longer. Father Neptune certainly looked the character to perfection, but he can scarcely be said to have acted the part quite faultlessly. I entreated the captain and first officer to keep the secret of his disgrace, and I believe they did so ; but the story was told by somebody, as such stories always are, and terrible was the chaff which the Controller of the Waves endured. The Avinds will carry the tale of his humiliation to the clouds; and Olympus itself shall fall from its fleecy heights before the god has heard the last of his tin utensil, and his pocket-handkerchief, and the thumping of the screw."], [139, "127 CHAPTER IX A NAVAL ENGAGEMENT BEFORE reaching Brindisi I took an opportunity of explaining to my fellow-travellers the neces sity of their adopting some rational names. These Olympian appellations were all very well as a joke, but would hardly pass muster in society. Besides, almost everywhere in Italy each one would be required to sign both his Christian and surname in the visitors' book at the hotel. For practical purposes, it made very little difference whether the names were Greek or English, as I intended in any case to pass them off as subjects of her Majesty. Thinking, therefore, to flatter their vanity, I gave them the choice of all the oldest family names in the British peerage, prefixing the prettiest Christian names which a lady novelist ever devised ; but they obstinately refused to have anything to say to them. Venus would not be Gladys Hamil- ton ; nor Diana, Beatrice Howard ; nor Mercury,"], [140, "VENUS AND CUPID 128 Archibald Fitz Bentinck ; nor Bacchus, Montagu Pelham ; nor Neptune, Augustus de Fleetwood ; nor Apollo, Chichester Stanhope ; nor Cupid, Willoughby Tollemache ; nor Hercules, Samson Hope-Greville. I don't know what more I could have done for them, but my offers were persis tently declined. Venus declared that she would be Venus to the end of the chapter, and the rest followed suit with dogged determination. \"What do you call an old family?\" asked Venus, with a curl of her lovely lip. \" Why, the oldest peerage in England only dates from 1155, and I sprang out of the sea-foam four thousand years ago. As for Cupid, he was flitting about from heart to heart centuries before all the Howards and Fitz Bentincks were ever heard of. Willoughby Tollemache, indeed ! I won't have my boy called by any such foolish name.\" I saw that it was useless to press the point, and I pretended, therefore, to give in. But, of course, I was bound to be provided with a list of names for the satisfaction of the police ; so I gave in structions to the head-waiter, immediately upon arrival, to bring the visitors' book to my own room, and entered them myself, ringing the changes on the nearest equivalents to Brown,"], [141, "A NAVAL ENGAGEMENT 129 Jones, and Robinson which the Greek language would supply. Nobody stops at Brindisi, except to wait for a steamer; and for that very reason, as I was anxious to sever all connection with our fellow passengers from Greece, I determined to remain at the Indie Orientali for at least a couple of days. I could usefully employ my leisure in writing a few short plays and recitations for my celestial company \u2014 a literary effort of no very high order \u2014 which I might probably achieve as creditably as any manager of a theatre. It made very little difference what they said, as nobody would understand them ; and the words would mainly serve as a cue to tone and gesture. But it would save time as well as money to have something ready for rehearsal ; and, if money was to be made by the contemplated exhibi tion, there was no time to lose. As for the gods and goddesses, they must employ their leisure in watching the steamers from the quay. The absurd rapidity with which Lord Alconbury had succumbed to the fascinations of my show figure opened my eyes to the literally appalling depths of the responsibility laid upon me. It was clear that no man of common flesh and blood I"], [142, "VENUS AND CUPID 130 would be able to withhold his admiration of her positively dazzling beauty ; while the impetuous youth of moderately excitable disposition would fling himself recklessly at her feet before he had known her half a day. My position had become desperately awkward, and I wished with all my heart that the lovely goddess had stayed at home. Diana was safe enough \u2014 I should have little trouble with Jier \u2014 and Minerva would have been safer still; but this blessed Venus would be a source of perpetual anxiety, and might with extreme probability get me into some serious row. The one consolation was, that she could neither speak nor understand a word of any language except her own. Ten chances to one she would never meet another man who could make love to her in Greek ; and suitors of all other nations would be hopelessly deaf and dumb. If I could only keep Lord Alconbury away from her all might yet go well. And this much was clear enough, that, whether things went well or ill, it was out of my power to mend them. The people had forced them selves upon me, and I must see them through their three months' tomfoolery as best I could. What else was it possible to do ? If I gave"], [143, "A NAVAL ENGAGEMENT 131 them up to the police as vagrants from Mount Olympus, travelling at large without visible means of support, and told my story, who would believe me ? I should be locked up as a lunatic, and somebody else would take round the show. There was no other conceivable means of pro viding money for their subsistence; and, now that I had undertaken the job, I must carry it through. \" I say, Praxy,\" said Cupid, bursting into my room soon after breakfast on the morning after our arriA'al, \" we haven't got any money.\" \" No,\" I replied, \" and I don't intend that you shall have any. You'll only be getting into mischief with it. What do you want money for ? \" \" I want to buy some sweets, and Mummy wants a fan, and Apollo wants some eau-de- Cologne, and Neptune wants his hair cut.\" \"That's true enough, but he mustn't have it cut, all the same. Do you think I'm going to let my sea-god spoil his personal appearance and ruin the exhibition ? I won't have his hair touched, or his beard either.\" \"That's all very fine, Praxy, but we can't go about the streets with empty pockets ; and if you"], [144, "132 VENUS AND CUPID don't fork out, why, we shall just help our selves.\" \" How do you mean, help yourselves ? \" \" You know very well what I mean. I mean, send Mercury round to the money-changers, or the bank, or the post-office, or the steam-ship agency, or any other place where there's a lot of loose coin lying about in the drawers. We intend to have it somehow.\" \" You precious little rascal ! \" said I, collaring the boy and boxing his ears. \" And when you've got your money, how do you propose to spend it ? You won't know what to ask for in the shops. Not one of you can talk Italian.\" \"We can point to the things we want, and hold up our fingers. Besides, there are ever so many shops where Greek is spoken. I've seen it written up outside.\" \" How much did they tell you to ask for ? \" I enquired at last, the conviction dawning upon me that I should have to give in. \" I should think half a franc would be enough for a little imp like you.\" \" Half a franc ! \" said Cupid, settling himself comfortably upon my knees. \" Now, Praxy, don't you be mean. Five francs apiece is the very"], [145, "A NAVAL ENGAGEMENT 133 lowest figure we can accept, and that will only last till to-morrow morning. You must put us on an allowance, Praxy \u2014 five francs a day.\" \" I'll see you all at Jericho first,\" answered I. \" But where have you left the others ? \" \" Down in the billiard-room, waiting till I bring the money. Mercury and Diana are playing Venus and Apollo for a franc a game, and they can't pay up till you produce the needful.\" \" Come along, then,\" said I ; \" we'll go down there together.\" \"Well, Praxy,\" said Diana, after a purely feminine stroke which had just missed ripping up the cloth, \" and how much is it to be ? You can't expect people in our rank of life to go about like paupers.\" \" I'll buy you anything you want,\" said I ; \" that is, anything in reason.\" \" But we'd sooner do our shopping for our selves, you see ; and we've a mind to go and do it now, straight away.\" \" If Mercury will take his solemn oath that he won't attempt to steal, and Neptune that he won't have his hair cut, and Bacchus that he won't get drunk, and all of you that you won't buy anything dangerous or improper, I'll give you"], [146, "VENUS AND CUPID 134 five francs each,\" said I, with an air of conscious liberality. \" It's not the sort of treatment I expected of you, mon cher\" drawled Apollo, languidly chalking his cue by way of apology for a miss, like many a more accomplished player. \" The salt wind has made sad havoc with my complexion, and cos metics are expensive. Five francs won't go very far.\" \"It's all you'll get,\" said I, laying the amount in paper notes upon the billiard-table. \" So good bye till luncheon-time, because I've got work to do ; and mind there's no stealing.\" The deities monopolised the billiard-room until twelve o'clock, by which time Mercury had appro priated twenty out of the five-and-thirty francs assigned to his companions \u2014 it need hardly be said by cheating. Their losses did not, however, appear to afflict them very deeply, since the money had only changed hands among themselves, and had not gone out of the family. The slippery god would have to stand treat in the afternoon to the full extent of each man's share, and the equili brium would be adjusted. We lunched soon after midday, the meal being chiefly remarkable, as all our meals were, for the"], [147, "A NAVAL ENGAGEMENT 135 voracious feeding of Hercules and the insatiable thirst of Bacchus. The god of the vintage found the light Italian wines so cooling after the stronger qualities of Olympus, that two quart bottles at luncheon, and three at dinner, left him as sober as when he sat down to table. More than this I declined to give him ; and, even so, he involved me in an extra charge of several francs a day. As for Hercules, his appetite was so indecent that no landlord at any hotel in which we stayed would consent to feed him, unless I paid for two dinners on his account instead of one. I sat in my room scribbling plays and recita tions until four o'clock, and enduring the untold agonies which any man must needs endure who attempts composition at a hotel in Italy. The whole population entered into a league to drive me out of my mind with excruciating noises. My room looked out into a \" quiet \" court, where a boots whistled the same four bars six hun dred times, and a chambermaid sang lustily all the barrel-organ tunes she knew, and a carter cracked his whip for three-quarters of an hour, and a daughter of the house played five-finger exercises at an open window. A hundred yards distant was a church tower, where boys in the"], [148, "136 VENUS AND CUPID top story tinkled three broken bells every fifteen minutes with string and clapper. At the foot of the tower was a wine-shop where men played morra, shouting their monotonous units in discordant crash until I thought I must fling myself into the court below. In the adjacent barracks, once the convent of the church, soldiers were practising the bugle, a whole regiment playing all at once, and I was reminded of Cerberus when he raised his three heads and howled. All these distracting dins, and many more, I had to bear with patience, seeing that there is no escape but death, and that no Italian is capable of understanding what you mean when you say that such things dis turb you. When the last straw had been laid upon the camel's back, and it was mercifully yet unbroken, I flung my pen upon the table and seized my hat and stick, and plunged down the staircase to the entrance-hall and doorway. I had been hard at work all day, and a run before dinner would revive me. The country around Brindisi is not inviting, and I instinctively turned my steps in the direction of the shore. Having reached a spot several hundred yards"], [149, "A NAVAL ENGAGEMENT 137 beyond the mouth of the harbour, I observed two large sailing-boats about half a mile out to sea, the crews of which were not only shouting at each other with all their strength, but appeared to be actually engaged in naval warfare. Curi osity prompted me at once to take from my pocket a powerful opera-glass which I always carry, and by the aid of which I saw that my first impressions were not unfounded. In one of the boats stood four fishermen and a boy, who had furled their sails, and were defending themselves with raised oars against the onslaught of a hostile crew. In the stern of the other craft sat a rough-looking old man with an enor mous beard, who held the rudder, and appeared to be directing the attack. In the bows stood a boy in knickerbockers, peppering mercilessly with a catapult the four fishermen and their lad, who were evidently half blinded with the small shot, or whatever it was, which served him for ammunition. Next to him, with one foot on the gunwale, clearly watching his oppor tunity to spring into the enemy's boat, towered a gigantic figure, armed with a club of sufficient size and weight to brain any one of the fisher men at a blow. A slender youth wearing a"], [150, "138 VENUS AND CUPID wide-awake with the brim turned down over his neck and eyes, and a taller one with long flowing hair, were rowing in gondola fashion, their bodies bent forward towards the bows ; while a stouter but still youthful figure lay down in the bottom of the boat, to all appearance asleep or tipsy. Two ladies sat on cushioned seats near the stern, one of whom tossed water into the enemy's boat out of a large flat shell, while the other blew at intervals loud blasts upon a species of huntsman's horn, by way of cheering the combatants to victory. \" Well,\" said I to myself, \" this is a pretty state of things ! If Hercules once gets into that boat, not one of those wretched fishermen will ever sail back into the harbour. What an idiot I was to let them have any money ! Catch me ever trusting them out of my sight again ! \" Meanwhile there was mischief going on, and I was powerless to prevent it. They would scarcely have heard my shouts, and there was no boat within range of calling. What upon earth should a poor personal conductor do ? At this moment, by a marvellous stroke of luck, the steam-launch of the Crocodile came suddenly in sight from behind a low, projecting"], [151, "A NAVAL ENGAGEMENT 139 piece of coast-line just outside the harbour. I knew the captain and several officers of all the troop-ships, and I felt certain that any one of them would take me out to the scene of the scrimmage, if I could only get on board. There was water enough to bring the launch right alongside the flat rock on which I stood, and her nose was pointing towards me. After a few minutes' steaming she changed her course and put out to sea; but I threw up my hands and yelled, and made such touching signals of shipwrecked mariner's distress that she appeared to think better of it, and held on as before. At the distance of about a hundred yards she slackened speed and went astern, and finally pulled up within a yard of the spot where I was standing. \" May I come on board ? \" said I, recognising, to my great joy, an officer whom I knew perhaps best of all. \" In with you ! \" cried he ; and in two minutes I had told my story. \"Who are they?\" en quired the officer, who promised at once to help me to the utmost of his power. \"A party of Greeks whom I brought from Athens yesterday ; but they're thundering fools,"], [152, "VENUS AND CUPID 140 and I fear I shall have some trouble with them. If I can only give them a jolly good frightening about this foolish business at the start, I may probably get them well under control, and they won't dare to play such tricks again. So I shall tell them that you are armed Avith authority to lock them up, and I hope you will support me in anything that I say.\" \" All right ! \" said he. \" We'll make them hand up their oars, and tow them back to the harbour. It's all the same to me where I go. We only came out on a sort of trial trip, because the launch has had some tinkering done to her engine.\" We dashed in between the combatants, not a second too soon. Hercules had just stepped into the trawler, and was raising his club with the evident intention of finishing off his enemies one by one. Recognising my voice, however, as I shouted out his name, he dropped the weapon into the boat, and contented himself with the comparatively harmless freak of hurling the biggest fisherman headlong into the sea. \"If you touch another of those men,\" cried I, \" you shall go to prison. Strong as you are, you can't overpower half a dozen armed police"], [153, "A NAVAL ENGAGEMENT 141 officers ; and, unless you go back into your own boat directly, I'll have you locked up in less than an hour.\" \"They've been a-chaffin' of us,\" said the giant, mopping his cheeks and forehead with his shirt - sleeves. \"They 'ad the cheek to call me Lungo, and they was uncivil to the ladies.\" \" I don't care what they did ; you go back this instant. I'm ashamed of you, Neptune \u2014 encour aging these fools in such a piece of imbecility. At your age, too. What have you got in your hand, Cupid ? \" \"A catapult, Praxy. I tried to get a bow and arrows, but I couldn't.\" \"Give it me directly. And what have you been firing \u2014 pebbles ? \" \" No \u2014 small shot, Praxy ; but they're all gone, upon my honour,\" added the boy, turning out the lining of his pockets. \"I just planted the last of them on the bridge of the young un's nose, and didn't he holloa ! \" \" And where's Bacchus ? \u2014 oh, drunk, of course. Get up, you good-for-nothing rascal, and hand over that flask of wine.\" \"But it's more than half full, Praxy.

Has any other god or goddess got any attributes to surrender ? Toss me that club out of your boat,\" I cried out in Italian to the soused fisherman, who had climbed over the gunwale of the trawler, and stood drip ping in the bows. \"And if you'll come to the hotel this evening between eight and nine, I'll take care that you are fully compensated for any damage they may have done you. But you had better not make any complaint to the people at the port. You'll get nothing by it, and I shall make it worth your while to hold your tongues. I'm extremely sorry if anybody's hurt, but these Greeks are all as mad as hatters, so you mustn't mind.\" \"That young devil has riddled us finely with his cursed catapult,\" said one of the men. \" We all had to fight blindfold, for fear of losing an eye.

And now you shall see how I am going to avenge your injuries and make the Greeks look small.\" During this brief digression the celestial crew had somewhat recovered from the alarm which my energetic proceedings had at first inspired, and were conversing together in clearly mutinous language. The moment I had finished talking to the fishermen, Mercury stood up to discharge his ancient office as spokesman of the divinities. \" This sort of thing won't do, Praxy,\" said the god of eloquence, coming straight to the point with praiseworthy contempt for prologue. \" You appear to have forgotten who we are.

And as for the flask of wine, the gentlemen on board the launch will do you the honour to drink your health with it, as soon as they have towed you back to Brindisi. Your only chance of escaping prison, when you get there, is to sit quietly in your boat and do as I tell you ; so just hand up your oars.\""], [157, "A NAVAL ENGAGEMENT 145 The officer in command of the launch did not understand a word I said, and as everything depended upon promptitude of action, there was no time to explain. But I repeated the last four words in English, and he backed me up imme diately, sending his small crew forward to en force the order, with their drawn dirks in their hands. The deities gave in at once ; the oars were handed up into the launch, the boat made fast to the stern, and in two minutes we were steaming in the direction of the port and waving our hats to the fishermen. \" It is not every day,\" said I to myself, as I watched the boat dancing in the wash of the steam-launch, while Father Neptune drummed his fingers upon the useless tiller and Cupid dangled his brown legs over the bows \u2014 \"it is not every day that one enjoys the distinction of towing eight gods and goddesses ignominiously into port, in a boat without sails or oars.

What do you mean, you wretched boy, by peppering a lot of seafaring Italians in the face with a catapult at five yards' distance ?

But if ever they break loose again, I'll publish a decree, and nod my head, and have done with them. I'm Jupiter now, you know.\" From that moment my authority was estab- lished, and as we assembled in the reading-room on our way to dinner, each god and goddess came up to me very prettily in turn and begged my pardon. The fishermen and their boy put in an appearance later on, their battered faces bearing painful testimony to Cupid's unerring aim ; but they forgot their scars over a flask of good Apulian wine, which I caused the rival crews to discuss round a table in the smoking- room, Bacchus in the chair. When Cupid and the fisher -boy had smashed a tumbler apiece over the genial ceremony of clinking glasses, they adjourned by preference to the quay in front of the hotel, where they amused themselves after their own fashion for an hour or so, con- versing by means of signs, and returned with their arms entwined around each other's necks, the best of friends. As for their elders, they parted soon after ten o'clock on excellent terms ; a fifty -franc note which I bestowed upon the"], [160, "148 VENUS AND CUPID aggrieved Italians tending no doubt to make re conciliation easier. These personally conducted deities were becoming expensive, but I enter tained a daily increasing confidence that I should see my money back again. After the episode of the naval engagement, I thought it prudent to reconsider my intention of remaining a second day at so dull a place as Brindisi, where Satan would have it all his own way with the idle hands, and to go off at once to Naples. On arrival I sent for tailors and dressmakers, who should manufacture Olympian costumes for my team ; and in three days, under the clever supervision of Venus and Apollo, the garments were satisfactorily supplied. There was but little workmanship or nicety of fit in volved in their manipulation, the chief points being the effective blending of colours and the gracefulness of the folds. Meanwhile I had engaged a small theatre in the lower and more densely populated part of the town, and had advertised performances for three successive nights, to commence as soon as the properties were ready. Each night the theatre was crammed to overflowing, and the exhibition in itself a complete success ; but the"], [161, "BACCHUS AND THE FAUN 149 limited accommodation of the building, and the necessity of fixing a low price for admission in so poor a neighbourhood, prevented my realising any approach to a remunerative sum. Deducting all expenses, my nett returns for three nights amounted only to I needed to make as much as this every evening in order to defray the cost of the three months' tour and leave myself a fair profit in hand. On the third night the manager of the largest theatre in Naples, whose house was to be opened for the season in about a week, came behind the scenes and introduced himself, offering his most effusive congratulations. He had never seen any thing of the kind so perfectly irresistible, and he was prepared to make liberal arrangements for the few nights at his disposal if I would shift my company to his theatre, and advertise a series of performances, commencing on the morrow. I asked 2500 francs a night, and he accepted my terms immediately. I am a very bad showman, and I have no intention whatever of describing the exhibition in detail. The whole thing was eminently dis tasteful to me, and I never should have embarked in it but for the necessity of making money."], [162, "VENUS AND CUPID 150 The \"walk up, ladies and gentlemen\" style of business is not in my line at all, and even the few words of formal introduction in which I was forced every evening to present my deities to the spectators were spoken against the grain. But in point of fact they needed no introduction whatever. Venus could have been no one else except Venus, and every urchin knew her at a glance. Even in her European attire she looked the character; how much more Avhen clad in the ethereal raiment of her own Olympus ! She sat and stood and moved just as I had seen her in the banquet-hall of the gods, and the radiance of her beauty was unspeakable. Had there been no other attraction in the programme, the Neapolitans would have paid their money willingly night after night for the privilege of beholding Venus alone. But there were so many other attractions in the programme. Cupid enjoyed even greater popularity than his \" Mummy,\" because, in addi tion to his marvellous beaut)' and the inimitable performance of his part, he was always \"such splendid fun.\" We could not make him fly, but he darted about at his mother's bidding from gallery to gallery, and from box to box, pretend-"], [163, "BACCHUS AND THE FAUN 151 ing to wound the ladies' hearts, and displaying the most wickedly precocious judgment in the selection of his victims. Sometimes the little imp would get up a \" case \" between some elderly gentleman and a virgin well advanced in years, to the infinite amusement of the gaping audience in the pit; and yet all his chaff and impudence were conducted in good taste, and he never took liberties or gave offence to the most touchy among the spectators. It almost seemed as if a breath of the divine inspiration had come back to him at the fingering of his bow and arrows, or at the spreading of his mimic wings. Then there was Apollo, who sang Greek songs, accompanying himself upon the guitar \u2014 and sang them in a voice so strange and god like, and yet so full of human passion and sympathy, that the entire audience was rapt in wonder, and tears stood in rough men's eyes. His beauty, also, like that of Venus, would have sufficed to fill the house with admirers, even if he had stood alone upon the stage. Never was there seen in one face and figure such a union of tenderness and majesty, of brightness and languor, of vigorous action and sublime repose."], [164, "VENUS AND CUPID 152 Then there was Mercury, who stole purses from respectable citizens' pockets and bracelets from ladies' wrists with admirable dexterity and cunning. And Hercules, to whom twelve labours had been assigned, in the course of which he performed such incredible feats of strength that nobody would believe he was a man. Neptune sat enthroned on a sea-girt rock, planting his trident in the shallow wave and detaching long ribbons of sea-weed from his untidy beard. To the intense delight of the juveniles, whose eyes were fixed upon this ap pendage from the beginning of the performance until the end, the god would produce at intervals from its shaggy depths an inexhaustible supply of weed ; each extraction, as he held up the fragment with an expression of reproach and dropped it in the water, eliciting a fresh burst of ringing laughter from the boys and girls. Diana made less impression than her comrades, as there was nothing for her to hunt, and her beauty was of a cold, unattractive order. But Bacchus received always a hearty round of ap plause, as he reeled with uncertain step upon the stage, crowned with ivy, or sang merrily some Anacreonic ode in praise of wine."], [165, "BACCHUS AND THE FAUN 153 While at Naples I made arrangements for a week's exhibition in Rome, another in Florence, and a third at Milan. At each place I received \u00a3100 a night, and by the end of the first week in April I had cleared \u00a33000. I did not let my deities know how much I was making, or they would have struck work long ago; but it was well understood between us that after a week at Milan they were to be free. Plays and reci- tations would give way to six weeks of pure amusement ; and then there must be a hurried journey back to the Piraeus, to keep the appoint- ment at Ganymede's shed on the last Saturday in May. Our performances commenced at eight, and so very little was necessary by way of rehearsal or preparation that the entire day was practically at our own disposal. While at Naples we paid three long visits to the Museum, where the gods were frequently amused and sometimes disgusted, but seldom flattered, at the contemplation of their effigies in bronze or marble. \"My body bain't in lumps like that,\" said Hercules, when I showed him his celebrated Farnese statue. \"The fellow that put them limbs together never seed me in the flesh, I'll"], [166, "VENUS AND CUPID 154 take my oath on. The only part of me that's the least bit like is that 'ere club.\" \"Ah, Bacchus and the Faun! \" said the merry god, looking up at the famous group in the Hall of Masterpieces. \"Well, I was such a very diminutive infant at the time that I can't say positively what I did, but it strikes me as pro bable that, if a faun ever had the impudence to put me on his shoulders and carry me along like that, I scratched and kicked and howled until he put me down again. I certainly don't remember smiling at the beggar; but of course it's a very long time ago.\" \"Why do they always make me look as if I'd just walked out of a bathing-machine, and wished I'd stopped inside ? \" asked Venus, after inspecting a room full of statues in her honour. \"That's not such a bad likeness of Ganny,\" observed Cupid, looking critically at his play fellow. \" But I never got tied in a knot with a dolphin when I was small \u2014 noAV, did I, Mummy ? I'm sure you wouldn't have let me.\" \" Oh, that's Mercury in repose, is it ? \" said the messenger of the gods. \" Well, it's not my idea of a very comfortable attitude. I like some-"], [167, "BACCHUS AND THE FAUN 155 thing to lean my back against. And I should have said the gentleman in bronze was catching flies.\" \"The modellings of my face and figure in these salons are quite too distinctly inferior,\" drawled Apollo, running his fingers through his hair and surveying himself complacently from his gaiters to his necktie. \" I vote we take a promenade en voiture in the Villa Nazionale, and hear the band play.\" Of course we spent a Sunday at Pompeii, and made the indispensable trip by steamer to Capri and the Blue Grotto, and went up Vesuvius, where Venus shed crocodile tears at the thought of her absent Vulcan, whose memory came sud denly back to her, for the first time since she left Olympus, while gazing into the subterranean fires. \" Poor fellow ! \" said Venus, sighing like the furnace itself; \" I trust, for my sake, that he is not labouring above his strength. His works are on so large a scale, and his orders so numerous, that he may even now be plying the bellows that fan these very flames. I wonder whether he is thinking of me.\" \" You bet he isn't,\" said Cupid. \" He's"], [168, "156 VENUS AND CUPID whistling the ' Harmonious Blacksmith,' con siderably out of tune, and thinking whether there'll be sprats for dinner.\" \"Could I believe it,\" rejoined the goddess, \" I were almost happy.

His thoughts have wandered far away from his menial work shop to his personally conducted bride.\" \" Look here, Mummy,\" said Cupid, \" if you cry like that you'll put the fire clean out, and the bellows will stop blowing. He's very well con tented where he is, Mummy, and so are you.\" It is thus that small boys presume to chaff their mothers in these disrespectful days. \" Might I suggest, madam, that you should wash down your grief Avith a glass of white Vesuvian wine ? \" asked Bacchus, handing a tumbler to the goddess, who emptied it at a draught, and smiled through her happy tears. \" Boo, woo ! \" said Cupid, flinging his face upon his mother's lap and beginning to bellow like an infant bull. \" What's the matter now ? \" asked Venus, raising the urchin in her arms. \" Did the naughty sulphur get into its pretty eyes ? \" \" Boo, woo ! nobody asks me to wash down"], [169, "BACCHUS AND THE FAUN 157 my grief.

These Neapolitans must think us a precious parcel of fools, to be gam moned into the delusion that such a miserable effect of screeching and scraping is music.\" \"Ah, Mr. Tomkins,\" simpered the old-young lady, rising from the table, \" you are a practical man, you see, and I don't like practical men ; I like poetry.

Among the passengers in the steamer was"], [172, "160 VENUS AND CUPID the Rev. Elijah Crump, a Baptist minister with a large flat face, supported upon an enormous sub structure of white cravat and collar. He had travelled much in Palestine, and was the author of a popular treatise upon the \" Handmaidens of the Bible;\" but he had not yet succeeded in obtaining a partner of his own domestic joys and sorrows. In obedience to one of those unac countable freaks of fancy which impel the most unlikely men in the most unlikely direction pos sible, the reverend gentleman had Avithin the last few days discovered the handmaiden of his fond desires among my personally conducted deities at the hotel ; and during our voyage from Naples to Sorrento he informed me of his intention to offer himself, with all his sanctity and all his Biblical research, at the shrine of the great goddess Diana. \" I am well aware,\" said the worthy minister, with an apologetic waA'e of the hand, \" that she is at present an actress ; but of course, when she becomes Mrs. Crump, she will move in a totally different sphere.\" \" It is not so easy to say with any precision,\" I rejoined, \" in what sphere the young lady may be moving some few months hence ; but I should"], [173, "DIANA RECEIVES AN OFFER 161 keep well on the other side of the table, if I were you, while making any such proposal.\" \" I don't quite understand you, Mr. Tomkins.

The latter nymph, of nine-and-twenty, thought she looked bewitching in a tight blue pilot jacket with sporting pockets and flat brass buttons, a starched open shirt-front with three horsey studs, an upright dog's-eared collar, her brother's boat ing ribbon for a necktie, and a boy's straw hat, attached by a silver-plated knitting-needle to one of the uppermost tufts of her wiry hair.

Then, of course, everybody had to duck his head, and you can't duck your head in a small crowded boat without putting it in somebody else's lap ; and so Miss Gushington breathed a hysterical sigh into Apollo's watch-pocket, while Miss Tailormade committed the wealth of her fluffy hair to the apothecary, ploughboy, and thief of Mercury's waistcoat buttons. Then there was the inevi table diver, from whose coppery skin \"the elfish light fell off in hoary flakes \" ; and the no less inevitable panic when a small American boy hol loaed out to his sister, \" O Hilda ! here's a jolly lark !

Day visitors to Capri spend a full hour of the short time at their disposal in lunching at the excellent hotel; and the appetite of several of our party was so insatiable that I had some little difficulty in persuading them to leave the table. Hercules indeed, having failed to obtain satisfac tion out of the somewhat scrappy dishes handed round to him, flatly refused to stir until he had been supplied with a supplementary beef-steak and a solid pound of cheese. Bacchus was only too glad to keep him company while finishing his second bottle of wine ; and Diana, who played a very nimble knife and fork at most of our colla tions, was easily persuaded to sit and look on while the gentlemen enjoyed themselves.

Half-an-hour later Hercules had devoured his steak, and was encouraging the process of diges tion by a lounge upon the sofa of the saloon which opened out of the dining-room. Bacchus had drunk the last of his wine, and had gone out, at Diana's request, to see whether the donkeys were in readiness at the door-step ; while the chaste goddess herself sat nibbling the last sur vivor of a plateful of biscuits which she and the Baptist minister had consumed between them. Whether by accident, or in deference to my homely caution, the rev. gentleman had seated himself immediately opposite the lady of his choice, and was now engaged in printing some large letters, with the aid of a BB pencil, upon the back of a menu. The printing appeared to be a work of time, and Diana had more than once asked him what he was doing; but he invariably put her off with a wave of his left hand, and the reply, \" Attendez, mademoiselle, vous verrez.\" At last the elaborate exercise was completed,"], [179, "DIANA RECEIVES AN OFFER 167 and after holding it up to the light to make sure that it contained no mistakes, and adding a few more touches to intensify the blackness of the down-strokes, the bold lover laid his hand upon his heart, bowed adoringly across the table, and handed the inscription to Diana. \" What do you mean, sir ? \" exclaimed the goddess, pushing back her chair and flashing divine wrath from her lustrous eyes. \" Do you know who I am ? \" \" I know of course, miss,\" replied the minister, \"that at present you are only an actress; but I trust you will soon abandon that somewhat godless profession, and become the pious and helpful wife of one who will consecrate the best of his energies to the interesting work of your conversion.\" \" Hercules ! \" shouted the offended deity into the adjacent drawing-room, where a sound as of distant thunder rumbling on the mountain tops behind Sorrento proclaimed that the demi god was refreshing himself with forty winks after his meal \u2014 \"Hercules, come here!

Upon calm reflection, he perceived that nothing but ridicule was to be gained by publishing the story of his humiliation to all the world. He left our hotel early on the following day, and retired to a quiet pension frequented by maiden ladies of unlimited respectability though limited means, where the charms of no pagan actresses would seduce his well-regulated mind, and the rude hands of no demi-god do violence to his sacred person. But he will not soon forget the presumptuous moment in which he raised his eyes with matrimonial intention to the great goddess Diana.

At Florence, Venus saw and criticised her famous recumbent figure by Titian, and expressed so strong a desire to compare it with Giorgione's version of the same interesting subject that I felt bound to include Dresden in our tour. From Milan we ran across to Venice, where the romantic indolence of the gondola life so charmed Apollo that I had much ado to get him any farther. Thence over the Brenner to Munich, and through Dresden to Paris, our in tention being to spend a clear three weeks in London before returning eastward. Ever since our arrival at Naples my gods and goddesses had conducted themselves with digni- fied and divine propriety. The males had broken"], [187, "BACCHUS DRINKS VIN ORDINAIRE 175 no heads, and the females \u2014 wilfully at least \u2014 no hearts. There had been a succession of mild flirtations in the public rooms at the hotels, of the usual harmless and unmeaning character. Venus never sat down to table without attract ing a universal stare of genuine astonishment, which ladies after a while would exchange for glances of polished indifference, and men for looks of open admiration. She held a small court every afternoon before dinner in the saloon or central hall, where she received whatever homage impassioned gestures and imploring eyes can render; but she made no attempt what ever to learn the commonest words or easiest phrases in any European language, and all her conversations on either side were carried on in dumb show. Love passages of such a nature are sometimes amusing, and not unfrequently absurd, but they can hardly be accounted as dangerous. It struck me, however, as somewhat strange that the fair goddess never encouraged any of her lovers to teach her a few sentences in French or Italian. Half-hours of instruction in a foreign tongue afford delicious moments of sweet and rapidly advancing intimacy ; and any one of the"], [188, "176 VENUS AND CUPID enamoured youths who hovered around her chair would have given his eyes to be installed into the office of preceptor. Yet she evinced no sort of desire to learn; and I began at last to fear that there might be some reason for her other wise rather stupid apathy. Could it be that she had not perhaps entirely forgotten the good looks and winning manners of Lord Alconbury, and that she hoped to meet him again ? I certainly indulged no such hope, nor had I any reason to suppose that so calamitous an event was probable. Apollo made almost as great havoc among the unmarried ladies as Venus among the men. To the mature spinster he was a darling duck ; to the maiden of uncertain age, a most interest ing creature ; but to many a susceptible young girl, I sadly fear, the inspirer of a hopeless passion. The god himself was absolutely pas sive, and made no attempt at creating any im pression whatever among the travellers whom we chanced to meet at the hotel. It was now thoroughly well understood that we were a company of strolling actors \u2014 respectable up to a certain point, but not presenting any very desirable opportunities for matrimonial alliance."], [189, "BACCHUS DRINKS VIN ORDINAIRE 177 If, therefore, his faultless beauty set all the fair sex in a flutter, the fair sex had only itself to thank for not keeping out of the dangerous young man's way. Whether the highly gifted deity maintained a similar attitude of cold re serve towards sundry bright-eyed Neapolitans, or others whom he may have met elsewhere, is a matter which does not concern our present story. For my own part, I was perfectly astonished at the correctness of my company's behaviour. It seemed almost beyond belief that they should prove so tractable, and that for a clear month at least not one of them should have broken loose, in his own peculiar line. I had feared that Hercules would be for ever resenting imaginary affronts with blows, perhaps fatal, from his iron fist; that Bacchus would drink at every tavern to scandalous excess ; that Mercury, from sheer force of habit, would pilfer right and left; and that the mad pranks of my young friend Cupid would involve me in per petual trouble. Not one of these things hap pened, and I can only account for such admirable self-control by regarding it as a wholesome effect of our plays and recitations. With the exception M"], [190, "178 VENUS AND CUPID of Diana, to whom little attention was paid, each deity took an obvious delight in receiving, night after night, the homage of so many thousand mortals ; and each one knew, also, that the indul gence of any foolish freak or eccentricity which might attract the notice of the police would be fatal to the maintenance of their dignity as dwellers upon Mount Olympus. I had, more over, thoroughly impressed upon their minds that upon the success of the exhibition depended their enjoyment of the subsequent tour. The ordeal became tedious after a while, and they were doubt less glad to be released from their nightly posings ; but so long as the performances lasted they did their work conscientiously, and did it well. When, at the termination of one week at Milan, we began the forty days of promised pleasure, the rapidity of our movements and the excitement of novel scenes acted as a similar safe guard. We stopped noAvhere between Venice and Munich, or between Munich and Dresden, or between Dresden and Paris. At each of these places our time was wholly taken up with sight seeing, and there is little opportunity for getting into social scrapes during a long journey by train. On reaching Paris we were all tired out"], [191, "BACCHUS DRINKS VIN ORDINAIRE 179 with incessant travelling, and I willingly acqui esced in the general desire for a week of well earned repose. We put up at the \"Louvre\" \u2014 which in the good old days, before the \"Grands Magasins\" elbowed it out, was the best hotel in Europe \u2014 and Bacchus drank his first bottle of honest vin ordinaire. He appreciated it so highly that he drank a second, and then a third \u2014 at which point I always interfered, bidding my friend \" think of his head the next morning.\" We sat at the end of one of the long parallel tables, occupying a corner of the dining-hall near the door. In the opposite corner sat a well dressed young man, who appeared to regard our group with considerable interest, though the distance was too great to enable me to make out his features. It was nothing new that men should stare at Venus, or indeed at any other member of the party \u2014 :the whole room did it everywhere, as a matter of course. But this man did more than stare \u2014 he left his food for staring. Venus also, though she usually enjoyed her dinner, and the cooking was in the present case exceptionally good, bowed a preoccupied refusal to almost every dish they brought her,"], [192, "180 VENUS AND CUPID and stole repeated glances diagonally across the room. Among the first to leave the table was the gentleman in the farther corner, whom I re cognised, the moment he stood upright, as Lord Alconbury. I felt extremely annoyed, but there was little to be gained by betraying my annoyance, and I received him with the blandest of professional smiles.

When we do turn our faces home wards, we shall make pretty straight for Athens.\" \" Heard all about your triumphs in Italy,\" said Lord Alconbury, sitting down by Venus in the corridor. His lordship must have known pretty well by this time that she was by way of being on the stage ; though how far the discovery might be in her favour or not was more than I could foresee. Venus welcomed her steamboat acquaintance with undisguised pleasure. The poor girl had not spoken a word of her own language to any one except myself for six clear weeks, and"], [194, "VENUS AND CUPID 182 she was dying for a little sympathetic converse. Lord Alconbury could give her this at any rate, and she made no secret of her delight on meeting him again. \" And do you still persist in having no name or surname ? \" asked he, when the first cere monious stiffness between them had worn off and they had settled down into their old familiar relations. Venus had reconsidered her position in this respect, possibly from a sense of the barrier it placed between herself and her lover. I signed a certain set of names for them in the visitors' books, which they privately disowned ; but the goddess now, for reasons of her own, thought better of it, and was glad to shelter herself behind my innocent fabrication. \" Oh, that was a little joke of mine, you know,\" she replied, blushing. \" Of course I've got a name, but I shan't tell you what it is. You can find it out at the bureau. It's a very ugly one.\" Lord Alconbury was evidently relieA'ed. \" Ugly or pretty,\" said he, \" I shall never call you by it. You will always be Venus to me.\" And so they went on every day for a Aveek, plunging deeper and deeper into the quicksands, until at last she swore that she would be Venus"], [195, "BACCHUS DRINKS VIN ORDINAIRE 183 to him for ever; and he held her in his arms, and vowed before heaven that no power on earth should part them. It was very horrible, but what could a poor personal conductor do ? \" If you only knew what I could tell you, my lord,\" said I, \"or if you would only believe a tenth part of it when told, you'd sooner put your own eyes out than look at her again.\" \"That sounds very melodramatic,\" he replied, with the suspicion of a sneer ; \" but when a man is fond of a woman, he isn't going to be fright ened away from her by mysterious and indefinite warnings.

Venus would never dare to disobey the decree, and eight days for safety must be allowed between London and the Piraeus.

They broke out more than once with rampagious playfulness ; and for every one of them, except the steady -going old Father Neptune, I had a heavy bill to pay by way of setting things straight again. A trifling indis cretion on the part of Apollo, a theft on that of Mercury, a boyish freak performed by Cupid, an insult offered by Bacchus while under the influence of drink, and an ill-judged feat of strength achieved by Hercules \u2014 compensation for all these eccentricities of celestial conduct had to be liberally paid before we were permitted to resume our journey. However, we parted on good terms with the Parisian world at last ; and the improprieties of my friends were so abso- lutely insignificant, when compared with this"], [198, "186 VENUS AND CUPID gigantic folly of Venus, that I could not find it in my heart to scold them. We \"descended,\" as the French say, at the Charing Cross Hotel; but I did not propose to remain there, as there seemed a better chance of avoiding Lord Alconbury if we lost ourselves in a labyrinth of lodgings. It was but a chance, of course, since the lovers might correspond, for aught I knew ; and yet Venus, though clever in many ways, was altogether green in London, and would be more likely to make a mistake about a street or the number of a door than about the name of a first-class hotel. In a couple of days I had secured a charming set of rooms in a quiet street at the West End, where we made ourselves tolerably comfortable. Curiosity to see the great sights of mighty London stood my friend for about a week, during Avhich time the deities were too much occupied to get into mischief, and all went smoothly. One afternoon I hired a brake and took my gods and goddesses for a long drive in the country, by way of impressing their minds with the almost boundless extent of the Metropolis. On our return we passed a pretty little suburban villa, surprisingly close to the smoky town itself,"], [199, "APOLLO AND MARSYAS 187 and yet so completely surrounded with copse and shrubbery that it might have been trans ported from some Berkshire village. In front of the house was a well-kept lawn, and a diminu tive lake on which a pair of swans sailed slowly. Between the water and the carriage-drive which led to the front-door a few cows and sheep were grazing; and in a tiny paddock beyond the lawn, railed off by a wooden fence, three deer lay reposing on the turf, while a stag rubbed his antlers against the trunk of an ornamental tree. \"What a lovely creature!\" exclaimed Diana, who had never seen an English stag before. \" Oh, how I should like to hunt him ! \" \" Hunt him ? \" I repeated. \" Why, he's tame \u2014 probably eats out of the children's hands. You surely wouldn't hunt a pet animal like that. You might as well hunt a sheep or a swan.\" \"I'd hunt anything,\" returned the goddess, \" that runs or flies. And oh, Praxy ! I haven't shot off an arrow since we left Olympus.\" \" I am afraid, dear lady, you must wait till you get back again. There is no hunting to be got in London.\" \" What's the name of that place ? \" asked"], [200, "188 VENUS AND CUPID the goddess. \" It's so pretty ; I wish we lived there.\" \"The Thorns, Walford Road,\" I replied, read ing off the big letters on the gate-post as we passed along. \"Write it down for me, Praxy. I'll call one of my preserves by the same name when I get home.\" Smiling at her enthusiasm, I scribbled the four words on the inside of an envelope and passed it to her. Diana stood up in the brake to catch a last glimpse of the stag's horns between the trees, and talked of nothing else but his beauty and the pleasures of the chase until we reached our lodgings. On the tenth evening after our arrival Apollo expressed a strong desire to see one of our monster music-halls, and I suggested a prome nade concert at the Sapphic. Diana, Mercury, and Hercules declined to go, on the ground that they could not endure the heat, and Venus made a similar excuse in consideration of a pretended headache; but the four remaining gods, accom panied by myself, went off soon after six to dine at a restaurant in Piccadilly, and adjourned to the Sapphic later on. The music and singing were"], [201, "APOLLO AND MARSYAS 189 both of an attractive order, and the hall was fairly crowded. \" You are never going to take your guitar ? \" said I to Apollo, as he appeared at the bottom of the staircase in our lodgings with the instrument in its case. \" They won't let you play it at the Sapphic, and it will be most frightfully in the way.\" \" Give you a song in the cab, you know, as we bowl along,\" answered the god. \" It's a week or more since I touched the strings, and this evening I feel musical.\" \" I strongly recommend you to leave the thing at home,\" said I ; \" but if you choose to be bothered with it, come along.\" We called a couple of hansoms, into one of which got Neptune and Apollo, while Bacchus and myself occupied the other, taking Cupid between us. As we skirted the Park on our way to Piccadilly, melodious strains were heard issu ing from the vehicle in front ; the driver hold ing his trap-door continually open, and peeping down with evident astonishment at his accom plished fare. \" Of course you'll leave that blessed instrument in the cloak-room,\" said I, as we took our tickets at the entrance."], [202, "VENUS AND CUPID 190 \"Cloak-room be hanged!\" was the reply; \"I mean to keep it with me.\" \"The doorkeeper won't let you in, my good fellow. Take my advice, and get rid of it.\" \"He'll only think I'm an artiste, mon ami, and that I've come to the wrong door.\" And so, to my great regret, he did. I could not bring myself to make mischief by betraying my friend, though I felt an uneasy presentiment that worse mischief would come of his being permitted to enter a music-hall with his attribute in his hand. About ten o'clock an Italian, who was begin ning to create some little sensation in London, stepped forward to play a solo on the flute, accompanied by a harp and pianoforte. He was quite comically ugly, and no longer young ; but his command of the instrument was undeni able \u2014 his lip firm, his tone full and reedy, and his execution crisp and clean. \" Where have I seen that fellow before ? \" said Apollo. \"I swear I know his face.\" \" Impossible,\" I replied. \" He was engaged in London all the time we were in Italy, and that's the only place where you could have met him.\" \" It wasn't Italy,\" said Apollo, \" it was Phrygia ; I remember all about it now. It's that hideous"], [203, "APOLLO AND MARSYAS 191 devil Marsyas. I skinned him once; and, by Jove ! if he doesn't play better than that, I'll skin him again.\" \"Don't make an idiot of yourself!\" said I, becoming alarmed at his excited manner. \" The man is playing well enough, and if you inter rupt him you'll get into a thundering row. Just please to recollect that you're not at Naples, but in England, and you can't play tricks with Londoners.\" Apollo made no answer, but he riveted his eyes upon the flute-player, and I could see that, in spite of his outward calmness, he was in wardly working himself up into a state of frenzy. I seized his hand, and whispered imploringly into his ear, and did all in my power to pacify him ; but he appeared to have transported him self into another world, and to be incapable of heeding me. Towards the end of the per formance he broke suddenly away, in defiance of all that Neptune and I could do to hold him ; and having succeeded, to my great surprise, in creeping stealthily, unopposed, through the crowd in front of us, he stood for a few minutes motion less at the foot of the platform. The flute solo was enthusiastically encored,"], [204, "VENUS AND CUPID 192 and it became evident that the Italian would have to play again. He stood in the accustomed posture, with a smirk upon his face and his hand upon his heart, bowing his acknowledg ments to the enraptured throng, until the last of the cheers had almost died away, when he moved sideways towards the pianoforte to give instructions to his accompanists about a change of pieces for the encore. The lady at the harp was not ready with her music, and the German at the pianoforte, in rising from his stool to help her, scattered the contents of his own portfolio upon the floor ; and the three bungled over their arrangements to a degree which soon began to evoke manifest signs of impatience in various portions of the hall. Some few roughs in the gallery had already begun to hiss in token of displeasure, when Apollo seized the precise moment for creating a diversion, sprang upon the platform at a bound, drew out his guitar, letting the case of the instrument fall to the ground, and struck a succession of chords, so masterly in their handling, so marvellous in their rich and ringing tone, that a sudden shout of positively deafening applause filled all the air."], [205, "APOLLO AND MARSYAS 193 The manager of course stepped forward to expostulate, and beckoned to some policemen to assist him in carrying out his programme ; but the police themselves stood listening like men bewitched, and nobody evinced the faintest desire that they should interfere. The uproar ceased, the manager bowed his submission to the popular will, the instrumentalists went on bungling over their portfolios, and Apollo was left in possession of the field. Sweeping the strings once more with the same thrilling touch of hand, he sang, in a voice such as never yet fell upon mortal ear, the most wonderfully beautiful melody that Euterpe ever played upon the flute or Erato on the lyre. It must have been in Olympus that he learnt it, and the entire audi ence bore testimony, by their breathless and reverent silence, that they were listening to a voice divine. The song was short \u2014 too short for the delighted multitude, and it goes without saying that they demanded an encore. During an ovation which lasted several minutes, Apollo stood radiant with joy and triumph, but never bowed ; and at length, apparently with a view to restoring tranquillity, he raised his head as if he were going to sing N"], [206, "VENUS AND CUPID 194 again, and began fingering his guitar. When every voice was hushed and every ear was strained to catch the first accents of the song, the god suddenly dropped his left hand to his side and stepped forward to the edge of the platform. \" Praxy,\" he called out in Greek, \" they like me best, don't they ? \" \" Certainly,\" answered I ; \" but please look sharp and come down again. We all want to be going home.\" \"And the victory is clearly mine, isn't it, Praxy ? \" \"Of course it is,\" I replied. \"And the other fellow is nowhere?\" \"Nowhere at all,\" I assented, like an ass; for I ought to have suspected his meaning. \"Then I shall skin him!\" cried the god; and in a moment he had laid his guitar upon the top of the pianoforte, seized the unhappy Italian by the throat, torn open his shirt and waistcoat, and begun to feel in his own pocket for a knife or some such weapon with Avhich to commence the classical operation. The police interfered now promptly enough, and it is needless to relate that the Italian was"], [207, "APOLLO AND MARSYAS 195 speedily rescued, and his assailant removed in custody. There was no further question of encores. Apollo had been guilty of an unpro voked and murderous assault, and he must take the consequences. By this time, however, he had worked himself up into a state of ex citement which bordered closely on insanity, and he struggled so desperately as he was being led away that it took three strong men to hold him. The audience now woke up to a knowledge of the uncomfortable fact that they had been lashed into ecstasies by the ravings of a madman, and everybody confided to everybody else that he had guessed as much from the beginning. Whether the poor wretched Italian was readmitted into popular favour we did not remain long enough to ascertain. The police succeeded with much difficulty in squeezing Apollo into a four-wheeler, and the rest of us followed them to the station in another. On arrival it was clear to the meanest intelligence that the deity had gone completely off his head, and that he was absolutely irre sponsible. He raved wildly about his contest with Marsyas, and laughed exultingly over the agonies of his rival as he went through the"], [208, "196 VENUS AND CUPID mimic action of flaying the presumptuous Satyr alive. I entreated that the medical officer might be summoned immediately, and the police inspector promised that it should be done ; but he flatly refused permission to any of us, at so late an hour of the night, to await the doctor's arrival, and we were forced to content ourselves with the assurance that all possible kindness should be shown meanwhile to our unhappy friend. So we drove back again to our lodgings, sore at heart, for this was our first real trouble. Ah me ! if it could only have been the last ! The suddenness as well as the sadness of the calamity touched us all more deeply than I can tell. Nep tune bent his head forward upon his shaggy beard and groaned aloud in sympathy with the imprisoned god. Even the light-hearted Bacchus was moved to sighing, while Cupid leant his head upon my shoulder and cried bitterly. Poor boy! they were genuine tears this time, and I thought I should never comfort him.

On mounting the stairs, how ever, we discovered that Venus was the only one of the party who had retired, and that the rooms of the remaining three were empty. I sent Cupid in to his Mummy to find out whether she knew anything of their movements ; but the goddess was sleepy, and her boy received an indifferent welcome. \" She's as cross as Vulcan's tongs and shovel,\" said Cupid, caressing the cheek which his mother had smacked for him. \" She doesn't know where they're gone, and doesn't care.\" \" Then I suppose she won't care to be told about poor Apollo,\" said I, \" so we will refrain from distressing her.

The bell rang sharply, and I ran doAvn at once to open the door. \" What ! all alone, Mercury ? \" I exclaimed. \" Where are the others ? \" \"I am faint and sick,\" said Mercury in a hoarse and feeble voice. \" Get me a glass of wine, for pity's sake, and then I'll try to tell you.\" I saw that something very terrible had taken place, but 1 curbed my impatience, and went into the dining-room to fetch the wine. Mercury followed me, sinking Avearily into a chair ; and as I struck a light, I dropped the match with horror at the patches and streaks of blood which stained his cheeks, his shirt-front, and his hands. It was five minutes or so before he was suf ficiently composed to tell his story. Meanwhile"], [211, "DIANA GOES OUT HUNTING 199 I had opened the front door to cool myself in the night air, for the dread of what was coming had sent me into a fever. I looked round for Mercury's horse, but there was no such animal to be seen ; and I concluded that he had found his way back to the stable. Then I returned into the dining-room, and this is the tale I heard. Soon after seven o'clock on this unlucky evening, the gods and goddesses who had not accompanied me to the Sapphic sat down to dinner. When the meal was over Venus went to lie down ; while Diana, Mercury, and Hercules adjourned to the sitting-room on the first floor. \"Now!\" cried Diana, clapping her two com panions on the shoulder and pacing excitedly up and down the room \u2014 \"now I can put into execution my little plan. I haven't had a scrap of real enjoyment since we came out.

Though the deer are tame, this sort of trespass will perhaps count as poaching, and goodness only knows what they may do to you.\" \"Hercules will see to that,\" said Diana, turn ing with a smile of confidence to her champion. \"Won't you, old man?\""], [214, "VENUS AND CUPID 202 \" Well, marm,\" replied the giant, squeezing the knotted muscles on his arm, \" the man as blocks the way, when you wants to pass, had better have stayed at 'ome to mind the baby.\" \" And where am I to find a horse ? \" enquired Mercury, who did not half like the job, but was unwilling to offend the goddess by saying so. \" There are sure to be stables in the country close by,\" said Diana. \" Don't you go raising difficulties.\" \"Can't promise a side-saddle,\" said Mercury again. \" I beg you won't mention it,\" was the reply. \" One seat is the same to me as another.\" Diana fetched her bow and arrows \u2014 an under sized and not very formidable set of weapons, which she had purchased for a feAV shillings at a toy-shop in Tottenham Court Road. I was obliged to make my deities a small allowance ; but I gave them as little as possible, and their finances did not admit of any expensive indul gences. They then called a cab, handed the name of their destination to the driver, and bargained with him by means of signs and symbols for the amount of the fare. The Thorns was reached at half-past ten o'clock,"], [215, "DIANA GOES OUT HUNTING 203 the cabby looking with undisguised suspicion at the three adventurers as he put them down out side the garden gate at the corner of a lonely lane. \" There's a-goin' to be a burglary on these 'ere premises,\" muttered the cabby to himself, shaking his head solemnly at the depravity of all man kind. \" I've 'alf a mind to give information to the perlice. It might stand me in a pint of beer.\" Mercury went off to steal the horse, while Hercules and the Queen of the Night enjoyed a quiet stroll along the high-road. Turning pre sently into a scanty copse, the demi-god seized the opportunity of securing a serviceable attri bute. With one tug of his left hand he tore up a young ash-tree by the roots, and soon fashioned it into the form of a terrific club, at the sight of which even the Hydra might have turned its nine heads away. \" If that 'ere sprig of timber don't settle their 'ash, marm,\" observed the hero, as he tossed his toy into the air and caught it by the handle, \" I must take to strangling.\" \" Don't you be too violent, my friend,\" said Diana, by way of caution. \"A gentle tap will be quite sufficient, just to let them know you're there.\""], [216, "VENUS AND CUPID 204 \"A gentle tap is all that any on 'em shall get, marm, you may be sure. But a gentle tap from the club of 'Erkiles is a compliment as don't often require to be paid twice over.\" \" Listen ! \" said Diana ; \" I can hear a horse cantering on the turf. Let us go back to the rendezvous and see whether it is Mercury.\" It was Mercury sure enough, and a sturdy little cob he had brought\u2014 just the very thing for a lady to ride in a small park by starlight. The goddess mounted her steed, received her bow and arrows from the hands of her attendant squires, shook down her skirts to satisfy the prim proprieties, and declared herself ready for action. There was no difficulty about opening the gate, which was simply latched ; and the)' followed boldly the carriage-drive along the shrubbery, until they reached the pond. Here the goddess dismounted, and bade Mercury hold her horse, while she sped across the lawn to the paddock and set free the deer. A gate opened in the fence, and in a corner of the paddock was a thatched wooden shed, in which the deer were slumbering. Diana stirred them up with the point of an arrow, and sent the creatures bounding one after"], [217, "DIANA GOES OUT HUNTING 205 another through the door of the shed, and then through that of the fence, which she closed be hind them. The palings were purposely made too high for them to jump, so she had them now at her mercy in the open field. Running back to her companions, she sprang quickly upon the horse's back and galloped after the frightened deer as fast as the faint starlight would permit her, letting fly an arrow whenever she saw a chance of hitting. After two or three scurries up and down the field, the stag made a desperate rush for the paddock fence, and Diana brought him down with a wound in one of his front knees. By this time dogs had begun to bark, and bells to ring, and lights to appear in the front windows of the house, and the fair huntress had scarcely dismounted from her steed by the side of the fallen stag when she was seized with no great tenderness by the wrist, and asked in the plainest of bucolic English what the devil she was doing. By way of answer she shouted to her companions, who came running across the lawn. \" Take your 'ans off that lady this instant ! \" cried Hercules, forgetting that the man could not understand him."], [218, "206 VENUS AND CUPID \" You cursed poaching vagabonds ! \" was the rejoinder. \" So there's three of you, is there ? Well, me and my mates '11 be enough to hold the lot till such time as the boy can fetch the constable.\" Hercules wasted no further words ; but as the speaker showed no disposition to let Diana go, he swung his club once or twice round his head, and brought it down with a fearful crash upon the man's left ear, breaking the arm which he put up in self-defence and dashing him to the ground. So firm was his grip of Diana's wrist that the goddess fell with him ; and Mer cury, in stooping over to extricate her from the corpse, bathed his hands in the blood of the slain. Other men now issued from the house, bear ing sticks and lanterns, but they had no fire arms, and they Avould probably have shared the luckless fate of their leader, had not a reinforce ment arrived suddenly from the other side. No less than eight policemen, who had been sent from different quarters by the cabby, and had joined forces on the way, entered unnoticed by the front gate, and stole quietly in the darkness across the lawn. The deities were all looking"], [219, "DIANA GOES OUT HUNTING 207 towards the house, and the policemen, gauging at a glance the colossal strength of Hercules, rushed on him in a body from behind, and secured him before he could strike a blow. Even with the aid of this stratagem, it required seven men to hold him, while the eighth took possession of Diana, whose bow and arrows betrayed her. Mercury, who in the confusion was overlooked, with great adroitness jumped on the horse's back, and succeeded, after an infinity of false turnings, in finding his way back to our rooms. His bloodstained hands and generally suspicious appearance made it impossible that he should ever seek guidance from a policeman; but here and there he met some solitary genius of the midnight streets iust sober enough to know his right hand from his left, who gave him such information as he desired. This was a pretty story for a personal con ductor to hear! And a personal conductor of gods and goddesses, too ! Was ever mortal man in such a plight ? And how in the name of heaven and earth was the thing to end ? Small chance now of keeping the appointment at Ganymede's shed on the last Saturday of the"], [220, "208 VENUS AND CUPID month. By that time one of my deities would be in a madhouse, another in the condemned cell, a third in prison for night trespass, and a fourth, \u2014 for it seemed highly improbable that Mercury could be screened \u2014 sharing the same fate as an accessory. And what would Jupiter do when he discovered that four of his divinities were missing ? And what would become of poor simple-minded Hercules after he were hanged ? Could they really hang him \u2014 a demi-god \u2014 one of the dread immortals ? The complicated horrors of the whole situation nearly turned my brain. I need hardly say that, like the typical lover in the three-volume novel, I \" retired to bed, but not to rest.\" Sheets and counterpanes could not hold a body that tossed so frantically from side to side ; and most of my night was spent in learning to make a bed, and then demolishing the frail structure by kicking the materials once again on to the floor. Never in my life did I so thank- fully hail the moment \" when daylight doth appear \" ; but as I Avent about my toilet I scarcely knew my face, for the mute wail of untold agony with Avhich every feature seemed to cry."], [221, "CHAPTER XV CUPID GOES OUT SHOOTING THE question of Mercury's imprisonment or freedom was settled sooner than I expected. A policeman on night duty had seen the horse stop at our front door; another, not far off, had caught the riderless animal as he drooped wearily along the streets, and noticing marks of blood upon his saddle and bridle, had detained him until the morning; a third had discovered the name and address of his owner stamped upon the stirrup-leathers, whereupon it needed only an exchange of telegraphic messages to establish beyond a doubt that the creature must have been stolen by the same individual who had ridden him to our lodgings. I had scarcely finished dressing, therefore, when a couple of bobbies arrived with anxious enquiries for the horse's rider, and there were no possible means of declining to produce him. Poor Mercury was desired to dress himself with all decent haste, 209 o"], [222, "VENUS AND CUPID 210 and to walk under escort to the police station. For the present he was only charged with theft, but it appeared almost certain that he would be likewise implicated in the outrage at The Thorns. In spite of the immeasurably greater importance of the last-named tragedy, I felt that my first duty was to my poor friend Apollo, and I deter mined to satisfy myself about his fate immediately after breakfast, taking Cupid with me. The deities had been going to such frightful grief of late that it was impossible to guess which of them would be the next to fall ; but the boy must at any rate be kept out of mischief, and as he was the most wayward of the bunch, he should never leave my side again. The meal was not a A'ery cheerful one, though Venus had lost her headache and recovered her good humour. \" Diana is late this morning,\" said the goddess, with the conscious virtue of one who has risen, by accident, half-an-hour earlier than usual ; \" and where are Hercules and Mercury and Apollo ? \" I sobbed over my tea-cup as I told her of our misadventure at the Sapphic, and made her understand that the bright god of music had"], [223, "CUPID GOES OUT SHOOTING 211 passed the night at a police station, and would probably be lodged this morning in an asylum. \" Re-ally ! \" said Venus, with an aristocratic drawl. \"How very odd of Apollo! Shall I trouble you to pass the marmalade?\" \"There's worse to come,\" said I, as I complied with her request; \"but I think I'll tell you the rest another time. I should be sorry to spoil your appetite for the jam.\" \" Out with it, Praxy ! There's no time like the present, and there are few things I dislike so much as being kept in suspense.\" She was absolutely heartless, so I let her have it at a crash, without mincing my words. \" Her cules has been arrested for murder,\" said I, \" and Diana for night-trespass, and Mercury for steal ing ; and they are all three in prison.\" \" No \u2014 really ! \" drawled Venus again. \" How very odd of them ! \" \" What can you possibly mean ? \" exclaimed Neptune, pushing back his chair with a look of bewildered horror, and brushing a small avalanche of bread-crumbs from his shaggy beard. \" You must be laughing at us ! \" said Bacchus, turning as pale as deep purple-red is capable of turning, and hastily leaving the room in order to"], [224, "VENUS AND CUPID 212 satisfy himself that his comrades were not safe upstairs. \"O Praxy!\" cried Cupid, jumping up from his seat and standing against my chair \u2014 \" O Praxy ! it can't be true ! \" and the poor boy burst into a flood of tears. \"Go back to your place, Q,\" said Venus, \" and finish your breakfast ; you know how much I hate a scene.\" \"O Mummy! I can't eat any more,\" pleaded the boy, still leaning upon my shoulder. \"Tell us all about it, Praxy; it's best to know.\" By this time Bacchus had returned, looking unnaturally solemn, and shaking his head sadly in response to a mute enquiry from the ancient god. They pressed me then to tell my story, which I did as coherently as my own emotion and theirs permitted ; but I think that even their piteous moaning sorrow distressed me less than the selfish unconcern of Venus, who ate her bread and marmalade and sipped her tea as coolly as if I had been relating a visit to the monkeys at the Zoo. I verily believe that she was just now incapable of any other thought except the gratification of her senseless passion for Lord Alconbury."], [225, "CUPID GOES OUT SHOOTING 213 It was a positive relief to get away from her ; and as I was anxious to learn the worst about Apollo, I drove to the police station where we had left him, accompanied by Cupid, and was admitted at once into the doctor's room. He assured me that his patient was hopelessly insane, and that he had already signed a cer tificate to that effect. Having committed an assault, he must be taken, as a matter of form, before the police magistrate ; but the proceed ings would be very short, and he would almost instantly be removed to Hanwell. \" Can he go to a private asylum, if his friends are willing to pay for him ? \" I enquired. \" Certainly ; but I should advise you to leave him at Hanwell for the present. He will be treated with the greatest possible kindness, and you can make other arrangements for him after wards, if he appears to need a change.\" At the police court I offered my services as interpreter, wishing to avoid delay, and knowing that it is not always easy in London to pick up any one who can talk Greek at a few minutes' notice.

What's his real name ? \" I gave the name which I had invented for the god, and his examination began. It was interrupted, however, by a desperate effort on the madman's part to get at Cupid, whom I had placed in the background of the court, vainly hoping that he would not be perceived. \" What's the matter now ? \" asked the magis trate, as Cupid pushed his way forward in answer to the god's appeal. \" He thinks the boy is Cupid, sir,\" said I. \"And upon my honour I should haA'e thought the same !

We were allowed to say good-bye to him in a private room, and the farewell scene between him and Cupid was inexpressibly touching. We then drove to the court in which Hercules and his companions would be brought up, and arrived just as the case was on the point of being postponed, for want of an interpreter. I ex plained to the magistrate the relation in which I stood to the prisoners, and handed in their names. The preliminary examination was then continued, and when it was over I was per mitted to speak for a few minutes with my unhappy friends. I said, of course, all that I could to comfort them, but my chief desire was to impress upon Hercules the necessity of quiet and dignified behaviour. Hitherto he had been so violent that they were obliged to chain him hand and foot, and three men stood on either side of him in the police court. I made him understand that this sort of conduct would seri ously damage his cause, and the poor fellow promised me at last that in future he would be as gentle as a lamb."], [228, "216 VENUS AND CUPID The victim of the demi-god's zeal in defence of his chaste mistress turned out to be the head gardener at The Thorns. He was a coarse, ill-tempered old fellow, who drank, and beat his wife, and bullied his children ; and nobody except himself was much the worse for his removal. Of course there was an inquest, at which also I interpreted ; but I have not the heart to recount the details of those dreadful days. The facts in each case were too clearly beyond dispute; the coroner's jury returned a verdict of wilful murder against Hercules, and he was committed to take his trial at the Central Criminal Court on the 25th of May. At the same time Diana was to be tried for the night-trespass, and Mercury as an accessory to the last-named offence, and for horse-stealing. I secured, of course, the best legal advice that money would obtain, but my solicitor gave me little hope that any jury would be persuaded to take a lenient view of the capital crime. EA'ery effort would naturally be made to reduce the murder to manslaughter, and the prisoners would have the benefit of such allowance as is usually accorded to strangers, who are in supposed igno rance of the laws of a foreign country. The assault,"], [229, "CUPID GOES OUT SHOOTING 217 however, had been so brutal, so cold-blooded, and so unprovoked that the extreme penalty of the law would almost certainly be inflicted. All day long, for two weary weeks, I was back wards and forwards in the City, visiting my im prisoned friends, or closeted with my solicitor on their behalf, or devising impossible schemes for their liberation, or running down to Hanwell for a short interview with Apollo. At first I took Cupid with me, fearing to trust him out of my sight; but this sort of life was poor fun for a high-spirited boy of fourteen, and he soon began to show signs of being bored. After a few days, therefore, I left him at home with Bacchus and Neptune, sketching out every morning after breakfast a plan for their employ ment of the day, and leaving them a sufficient sum of money to pay for cabs, admission to places of amusement, and short railway journeys. My one object was to keep Cupid out of mischief, and in charge of a steady old buffer like Neptune he could scarcely come to harm. Bacchus, however, when freed from the re straint of my continual presence, became a source of serious anxiety.

It turned out afterwards that he had discovered some place in the neighbourhood of the Haymarket where Italian wine was sold, and here he sat drinking until they turned him out into the street, when he was dragged aAvay to the police station. The first two mornings he was let off Avith a caution, not a word of which he could understand ; and as I did not know to which of the courts he would be brought up, I could not be there to help him. On the third occasion, however, I attended as in terpreter, and was instructed to inform my friend that, if he appeared before the magistrate again, he would be sent to prison as an incorrigible drunkard. Bacchus, now thoroughly frightened, swore solemnly that he would drink no more, and kept his resolution, as such men do, for two whole days. On the third night he drank harder than ever, and on the following morning was ordered to be locked up for a fortnight."], [231, "CUPID GOES OUT SHOOTING 219 This happened on the 21st of May, four days before the trial. Towards six o'clock on the evening of the 22nd I was returning home in a hansom, when I observed in front of me, just outside the railings of St. James's Park, a boy in brown stockings and knickerbockers, whose figure I seemed to know. On either side of him walked a policeman, one of whom held in his hand a wooden implement which looked suspiciously like a catapult, and the other a small canvas bag. The boy was weeping bitterly, and apparently looking round with imploring eyes for help, but finding none. I pulled up the cab, sprang out on to the road, and rushed towards the group on the footway, in very little more than the typical \" moment \" which the hero of the three-volume novel expends on similar feats of agility. The boy turned his head, flung wide his arms, and raised his voice with such a cry of joyous re cognition that the policemen let him have his way, and permitted him to fling himself upon my breast and hug me as I had never been hugged before. \" O Praxy, Praxy ! save me from these horrid men !

I was late for dinner, and by the time I had dressed and entered the room the first two courses had already been served. \" What have you done Avith Q ? \" asked Venus, as I sat down to a plate of lukewarm soup, and sent it away again. \" Got him locked up, like the rest of them ? \" \" My dear lady,\" I replied, disgusted at her flippancy, \" these troubles are too sad for chaff and jesting.

At my most urgent petition, and in consideration of his foreign nationality, he was placed by himself in a separate cell, instead of being hoarded with a lot of juvenile offenders ; but that was all I could do for him, and with a heavy heart I bade my little friend good-bye, and went off to pay my accustomed visits in the City. It was the same wretched business over and over again, and there is nothing special to be said about it. As the day of the trial drew near my deities became naturally more and more nervous about their fate; but they all behaved extremely well, Hercules in particular display ing an example of dignified resignation which was altogether semi-divine."], [243, "NEPTUNE EATS MUFFINS 231 On my way to our lodgings in the afternoon I decided upon saying nothing to Venus about Cupid's floggings. She must of necessity be told that he was gone to prison, but there was no object in letting her know that her bright and happy boy was doomed to suffer acute bodily pain. I am by no means sure, however, that it would have materially distressed her, in her present mood, to hear that the very worst thing possible had befallen the dearest of her Olym pian relatives or friends. Having settled this point, I spent the rest of my time in debating within myself a question which puzzled me exceedingly. Why did my highly respectable landlady take so quietly the scandalous behaviour of my friends ? She had seen Mercury led off from the very house be tween two policemen, and she knew as well as I did what had become of the rest, and with what manner of offences they were charged. It was inconceivable that she should allow the personal conductor of so disreputable a gang to remain in her rooms, with the two survivors of his party, for a single day. I had been expecting notice to quit ever since the morning of Mercury's arrest, and I felt by no means certain that the woman"], [244, "VENUS AND CUPID 232 would not claim compensation for injury which I might possibly have done her by giving the house a bad name. And yet she had never shown the least disapproval of my deities' proceedings, or expressed the slightest wish that I should vacate the premises and look out for rooms elsewhere. There must surely be some reason for treatment so totally opposed to all the time-honoured tradi tions of lodging-house keepers and landladies ; but what the reason was I could not for the life of me divine. I reached home about five o'clock \u2014 nearly two hours earlier than usual \u2014 intending to ask for a cup of tea, before strolling out with a view to an appetite for dinner. I was curious to see what amount of damage my imprisoned boy-deity had really done to the lamp-glasses in the Park. They might be all mended by this time ; but I never could take a walk for the mere sake of walking, and I have always found the most trivial object better than no object at all. Letting myself in quietly with the latch-key, I ascended the stairs and entered the sitting-room on the first floor. A grateful odour of buttered toast and tea filled the air as I stepped across the landing, and I concluded that Venus was"], [245, "NEPTUNE EATS MUFFINS 233 preparing a cup of the fragrant beverage for her self and Neptune with her own fair hands. On opening the door, a glance at the central table was sufficient to inform me that such prepara tions were going forward upon a somewhat sub stantial scale ; but a glance at the farthest open window, between the half-drawn muslin curtains of which two figures were standing, informed me also that, although Neptune was undoubtedly of the party, the lady who presided at the domestic feast bore no sort of resemblance to the goddess of love and beauty. She was a comfortably proportioned lady, with an ample waist, a pair of short chubby arms, and a head of fluffy ringlets, secured in position by a pack of yellow combs. The ample waist was at the present moment spanned by Neptune's trident arm, while the fluffy ringlets reposed contentedly upon the god's right shoulder. An eloquent silence enchained the happy pair, whose gaze appeared to be fixed upon a group of stunted shrubs which adorned a tiny garden on the opposite side of the road. \" Well, Mr. Tomkins ! \" exclaimed my land lady, gliding gracefully from her companion's embrace and advancing towards the tea-table;"], [246, "VENUS AND CUPID 234 \" I think, sir, you might have given a body warning ! \" \" I think so too, madam,\" said I, seeing my way to a smart little bit of repartee, \" and I give it now.

And there's a seafaring atmosphere about the gentleman, Mr. Tomkins, which fetched me from the very first day I saw him. The late lamented Mr. Jones was purser in a P. and O. steam-ship, and I have always, for his sake, looked Avith interest on mariners. I'm sure I don't wonder at you calling him Neptune, though of course it's only in fun, for the two are as like as new-born twins.\" \"When you have done talking nonsense, Mrs. Jones,\" said I, throwing myself into a chair, \"I'll ask you to give me a cup of tea, for I'm tired and worried.\" \" Poor thing !

I adore him ! I worship him ! \" \" Does she say she'll have me, Praxy ? \" asked Neptune, who during the above -transcribed dialogue had occupied himself in the steady consumption of four large cups of tea, with corresponding rounds of buttered toast and muffins. Having now, however, reached the utmost limit which five-o'clock feeding can attain, unless it be the intention of the feeder to forego his dinner altogether, he appeared disposed to"], [250, "238 VENUS AND CUPID resume the equally agreeable pastime of love making. \" Speak up for me, Praxy ! \" he con tinued, rising from his chair. \"She's the sweetest creature that ever breathed on earth. I love her ! I adore her ! I worship her ! Tell her that, Praxy, and let me hear her say that she'll be mine ! \" \" I shall tell her nothing of the sort,\" said I. \" You ought to be ashamed of yourself, at your time of life, playing such pranks as these !

I saw, however, that they were bent upon their folly ; and in the course of the evening Mrs. Jones informed me that Nep tune and herself were going off by an early train in the morning, to spend a long and happy day together at Richmond. \" But Jemima will get you all you want, Mr. Tomkins,\" said she, \"just the same as if I was at home ; and I know you prefer cold dinner on Sundays.\""], [252, "240 CHAPTER XVII VENUS GOES OUT DRIVING It was a matter of infinitesimal importance to me whether I ate a cold dinner on Sunday or no dinner at all ; for on the Monday morning my poor, bluff, honest Hercules was to be put on trial for his life, and I could think of nothing but his almost certain fate and its tragic consequences. Surely, if anything on earth could \" shake society to its foundations,\" it would be the execution of a demi-god by the public hangman. I breakfasted tcte-d-tcte with Venus, who was the only one of my celestial team now left ; and, under the circumstances, I could hardly do less than place my poor services at her disposal during the remainder of the day. I offered to bear her company to any suburban pleasure resort she might choose to name, excepting Rich mond, as I had no fancy to break in upon the philanderings of Neptune and my landlady. The Queen of Beauty \" declined Avith thanks,\" giring"], [253, "VENUS GOES OUT DRIVING 241 me politely to understand that my room would be more acceptable than my company. I am slow in many ways, but moderately quick at taking hints, and I took this particular hint with undisguised satisfaction. We agreed to eat our cold roast beef and gooseberry tart together at seven, but to see as little as possible of each other in the meanwhile. As I parted with the lovely goddess and went my way, I could not help thinking how very much happier the world in general would be if such convenient family arrangements as these could be made with greater frequency. Sunday in this particular case was neither a day of rest nor a day of amusement to the ill-starred personal conductor. I believe I went to St. Paul's in the morning, and to the Abbey in the afternoon ; and I remember coming to the conclusion that no man knows what an organ and a surpliced choir can do for him until he is in some real trouble. I don't think I did anything else except wander about St. James's Park, hunting for the splintered fragments of dear little Cupid's lamp-glasses, and reciting the names and attributes of my imprisoned deities one by one. About half-past six I let myself in at the front door of Mrs. Jones's lodgings, and mounted the Q"], [254, "VENUS AND CUPID 242 stairs as usual. Looking into the drawing-room on my way, out of languid curiosity to see whether Venus had returned from her accustomed drive, I found that she had not only returned, but re turned in company. She had met Lord Alconbury in the Park, and had persuaded him, with no great difficulty, to make a third at our somewhat frugal meal. I accepted the inevitable, and made his lord ship welcome; wishing him, as so many a wel comed guest is wished, at the bottom of the sea. The meeting, as he solemnly assured me, was purely accidental. He admitted that he had arranged a correspondence with Venus before leaving Paris for the Lakes, which little scheme, however, had fallen through, in consequence of some blunder on her part about the London address. To this extent my precaution in taking rooms, instead of remaining at a hotel, was amply iustified. On the part of Lord Alconbury, the meeting between them was accidental enough ; but I have not the slightest doubt that Venus drove out every day from four to six in the hope of finding him. \" Did you receive her letters, my lord ? \" I enquired."], [255, "VENUS GOES OUT DRIVING 243 \" One every day, as regularly as the post came in ; but she, never one of mine.\" I could not help smiling as I thought how much the British Museum might be disposed to offer his lordship for a \"Complete Collection of Autograph Letters from Venus to an English Nobleman.\" The smile broadened into a grin as I wondered whether the contents were such as the British public might profitably peruse if the epistles were translated into English and ex posed in frames upon the walls. Lord Alcon bury observed the smile, and misunderstood it, as I might have known he would do. \"There is no other way,\" he resumed, \"in which I can account for the miscarriage of my letters. I feel sure,\" he added, looking at me with perfect civility and good humour, but with the air of a man who means to have a plain and satisfactory answer \u2014 \" I feel sure that it is not to be accounted for on the theory of any steps whatever, directly or indirectly taken by your self.\" \"You do me no more than justice, my lord,\" said I, meeting his significant look at least half way. \"When I begin to intercept letters I shall begin to rob my employers' till.\" I saw that he"], [256, "VENUS AND CUPID 244 implicitly believed me, and he did not refer to the subject again. \" By the by,\" said he, after a short pause, \" talking of robbing tills, some of these people that you have been taking round appear to have been conducting themselves in a rather extra ordinary way.\" \"Has Venus told you all about it ? \" I enquired, wondering to what excess the heartlessness of this woman might carry her. \"She has told me quite enough to make me understand that they are not desirable associates for such as her. Your landlady, too, must be a queer sort of female. Venus says she has run off with Neptune.\" \"They are coming back again, you know. They only went down to Richmond for the day.\" \" Venus declares they are going to be married, but that is no affair of mine.

I only ask permission to speak for five minutes to the young lady alone.\" The young lady, however, flatly refused to grant the interview, though Lord Alconbury himself endeavoured to persuade her that it would be better to hear what I had to say. \" I know all about it, Praxy,\" said Venus. \" I could write down every one of your wise and prudent exhortations for you.

I tried to strengthen the suspicion by smiling at him significantly, and Venus helped me by blushing all over her cheeks and brow as maiden neA'er blushed before. \" I was only carrying on the old joke about pretending to be Venus,\" stammered the goddess, in evident and painful confusion. Lord Alconbury looked extremely puzzled, but the light would not break in upon his eyes. He sat buried in thought for half a minute, and then suddenly filled himself a glass of Avine. \" It's too absurd ! \" he muttered angrily, as he got up from the table. \" And, by Jove ! \" he added, looking at his watch, \" if we're not off in two minutes Ave shall miss the last train.\" If any man says that Lord Alconbury was a fool \u2014 a preternatural fool \u2014 an impossible fool \u2014 too big a fool even for the wildest pages of romance \u2014 that man doesn't know Avhat it is to be confronted on his travels with the eyes, the lips, the voice, the figure, and the flowing hair of the Queen of LoA'e and Beauty."], [261, "249 CHAPTER XVIII HERCULES IN THE DOCK I HAD declined to act as interpreter at the Old Bailey on the day of the great trial, as it would have been impossible for me to translate to my friends before a crowded court the sentences which must be passed upon them. A native Greek who spoke excellent English was therefore employed for that purpose, and I attended merely as a spectator. I was, however, accommodated with a reserved seat, by virtue of my connection with the prisoners. I am not going to describe the trial. No dramatic incident could arise out of a case in which the evidence was so palpably clear. The one feature of interest which distinguished the arraignment of Hercules from ordinary cases of murder was the very remarkable personal ap pearance of the prisoner himself. He had, indeed, lost a stone at least during his incar- ceration, and he looked haggard and worn and"], [262, "VENUS AND CUPID 250 miserable. But on his face was a quiet smile of conscious power, and a look of hope, and a majesty of dignified repose, which created sym pathy, in spite of the enormity of his crime. As you looked at his broad shoulders, and towering height, and huge square chest, and massive limbs, his strength appeared so prodigious, so ponder ous, so irrepressible, that you felt as if, in spite of himself, it must needs crush and slay. It seemed no more to accuse such a man of killing than to accuse another man of treading on his neigh bour's toes. There were few witnesses to be called, and the first part of the trial took an incredibly short time. Towards eleven o'clock the judge summed up \u2014 very much, as everybody said, against the prisoner. The jury retired to consider their verdict, and remained in conference nearly half an-hour. This delay was distinctly hopeful, and I felt my spirits rising. At last they re-entered the court, and Hercules slowly turned his head and Avatched them with eager eyes. Colossal as it was, it looked such a tiny little head, set upon such a gigantic frame. There was no suspicion of paleness in his face, no quivering lip, no nervous switchings of the"], [263, "HERCULES IN THE DOCK 251 mouth, but every feature perfectly under con trol. He seemed so capable of dealing universal death, and yet so calm in his determination to refrain, that you thanked him inwardly for not making an end of you then and there, and ex alted self-restraint into the noblest of virtues. \" Are you agreed upon your verdict ? \" asked the clerk of assize in the accustomed form. \" We are.\" \" Do you find the prisoner guilty, or not guilty ? \" \" Guilty, with a strong recommendation to mercy.\" \" On what ground ? \" enquired the judge. \" On the ground of his enormous size. \" I cannot accept such a verdict as that,\" replied the judge. \" What do you mean ? \" \"We think he's too big to hang, my lord,\" said the foreman ; \" and that's the truth.\" \"Wire cables wouldn't do it,\" remarked a juror who was in the rope and basket trade. \"No scaffold yet erected would stand the strain,\" obserA'ed a cabinetmaker and joiner. \" The drop would endanger the public safety,\" added a juryman whose business premises lay near the place of execution."], [264, "252 VENUS AND CUPID \"The walls of Newgate would totter to their foundations,\" said a master builder. \"Those are questions for the sheriff and prison authorities to decide,\" said the judge, \" if they are to be raised at all. They have nothing to do with the jury. I must trouble you to retire again, and bring me a proper verdict.\" Five minutes afterwards they returned into court, with the announcement that they found the prisoner guilty, but recommended him to mercy, in consideration of his presumed igno rance of our laws. The usual question was asked \u2014 the interpreter explaining to Hercules that it was not intended to be answered \u2014 and the judge, amidst a silence that might be felt, assumed the black cap and addressed the prisoner at the bar. \" Hercules Immensitos,\" he began \u2014 for such was the name by which I called him \u2014 \" you have been found guilty, after a patient trial, of the greatest offence which any man can commit against the laws of this or any other ciA'ilised country.

On the contrary, it appears to me that the almost"], [265, "HERCULES IN THE DOCK 253 superhuman strength with which you have been endowed imposed upon you a deeper obligation to keep your temper within control. In expia tion of the cruel blow with which you sent a defenceless old man to his grave, you yourself must die. The recommendation to mercy which the jury have handed in shall be forwarded to the proper quarter, and will doubtless receive that amount of consideration which it deserves ; but I should be deceiving you if I were to hold out even the most distant hope that your life will eventually be spared.\" His lordship then pro nounced sentence of death in the prescribed form, and the words were translated, slowly and solemnly, into the prisoner's ears. And this was the man who had torn lions to pieces with his fingers, and hoisted bulls upon his back, and tossed men into the sea like cats, and turned the course of rivers, and strangled serpents in his very cradle, and led away Cerberus from his kennel as if he had been a puppy. This was the man whose feats of strength and deeds of valour had gained him admittance into the company of the gods, and placed him first in rank among the bravest of the heroes. This was the man to whom temples"], [266, "VENUS AND CUPID 254 had been reared, and boars and rams and oxen offered up without number \u2014 no sacrifice too costly if only men might propitiate so powerful a deity, and avert the wrath of one who could annihilate at a blow. His godlike powers had indeed for a time passed from him, as Jupiter said they must, but the memories of his triumphs were with him still, and even now his strength was terrible. With one hand he could have throttled the judge upon the bench and flung him at the heads of the jury. In ten minutes, barring pistol-shots, he could have cleared the court, crushing to death policemen, Avitnesses, and counsel at every step and at every blow. And now, because in an utterly false position, not knowing what he did, he had transgressed a sacred law \u2014 transgressed it, however, with no evil intent, but with the waywardness of an un reasoning child \u2014 he must be led away covered with ignominy and disgust, the least diA'ine even among the mortals, the lowest of the low, to a violent and a shameful death. As I thought of all this, and knew, as none else in the court could know, who he was, and what must be passing through his mind, I could contain my self no longer. The tortures of the last three"], [267, "HERCULES IN THE DOCK 255 weeks had broken me down at last, and I burst into a torrent of unquenchable tears. As the words of the dreadful sentence sank one by one into the prisoner's mind, and he realised at length the full import of their mean ing, he stood up to his full height and proudly raised his head and clenched his hands, and his Avhole frame quivered with excitement. A look of indignation and anger settled upon his face, and it seemed as if at last he had reached the limit of his forbearance and must now assert his power. At the critical moment, however, when I dreaded some fatal outburst of passion \u2014 fatal to himself as well as to many others \u2014 by a happy chance he looked round, and I managed to catch his eye. We looked steadily at each other for a few seconds only, I with my hands clasped in front of me, imploring him to be still ; but in those few seconds he had called to mind the promise he had given me, and he became suddenly as quiet as a child. It was this last touch of noble self-restraint, and the gentle smile with which he gave me back my gaze of mute entreaty, that broke me down.

The pet stag had been badly wounded in the knee with a blunt arrow, and would run lame for life ; but the deer were only frightened, and the damage done to the fences was inconsider- able. She was sentenced to a month's imprison- ment for the trespass, and Mercury to three months for the double offence of trespass and horse-stealing. \"And do you know whom you are talking to, and whom you are sentencing, and who it is that you have had the impudence to lock up for the last two weeks in prison, you base, ignoble, pigmy mortals ?

Then I paid a visit of condolence to the incar cerated god of wine, and found him sadly crest fallen, and seriously in want, as it seemed to me, of a good glass of generous liquor. \"What do they mean, Praxy,\" he indignantly began, \" by treating me like this ?

On my return home I found a letter lying on the sitting-room table \u2014 just that instant come in, as the servant-maid informed me, by the district post. The envelope thereof was highly scented, and adorned with a gilded border. In the left hand corner two naked infants were flying into a bird's nest and stealing eggs ; and on the adhesive seal was stamped a red heart in relief, transfixed with a golden arrow. Unwilling to damage these works of art by tearing, I cut the missive open with a paper-knife, and was fairly knocked back ward into an arm-chair by the odour of patchouli which pervaded the note-paper inside. \"Sir,\" ran the letter \u2014 \"this is to inform you that we were married this morning by special license, and are about to start for our honeymoon.

I was sorry for the woman, but I had done my best to warn her, and my conscience was clear. Yes \u2014 my party was small indeed ! Every one of them had left me now. Jemima sent in my dinner, and the maid-servant cleared the things away, and I sat in my solitude, dis consolate and bereaved. A personal conductor with nobody to conduct is an object, methinks, over which even a glass eye might shed a tear. There was nothing to read except a Graphic and a couple of magazines, and I had not the heart to seek dissipation of my loneliness at some music-hall or theatre. The thought of a music hall set me shuddering, as it will for many a long day; but reminded me also that I must write a letter to the Superintendent at Hanwell, with reference to a box of clothes and other"], [276, "264 VENUS AND CUPID requisites which I was sending to my poor friend Apollo. I need hardly say that the garments purloined by Mercury at Athens had been long ago replaced by suits more honestly acquired, and less likely to attract attention on our return. To the best of my belief the stolen finery rested where it had been placed, in bundles tightly fastened and weighted with heavy pebbles, among the ruins of various sub merged temples off the shore at Pozzuoli. I opened my writing-case, and set to work upon my letter. The gas-burner stood imme diately over my head, and in order to avoid a total eclipse of light upon the paper beneath, I was obliged to shift my materials to the right, and lean well over the table. The position was uncomfortably awkward, and by the time I had got as far as \"15 Burnham Place, Warwick Road,\" I became aware of a painful sensation between my chest and an ill-conditioned waist coat button, which rendered further progress in such a posture out of the question. Opening my shirt - front, I saw that the inconvenience was due to the sharp edge of Ganymede's locket, which I invariably wore round my neck, but had just now totally forgotten. I took it off, in order"], [277, "THE BRIDE OF THE SEA 265 that I might write with greater ease, and tossed it down upon the paper, where it fell so close to the top of the page as to smudge the wet ink of the recently written address. \" Clumsy ! \" said I to myself, taking up the stone again and breathing on it, and then hurriedly Aviping away the ink before it had time to create a permanent stain. \" Ah, my boy, my boy ! \" I cried aloud in Greek, thinking of the fun we had had together ; \" if you could only fly down upon the eagle's back and help me to set my deities free ! \" But I knew that I might as well call upon the rocks to cover me, or invoke the timely aid of one of Jupiter's moons. The sight and fingering of the stone, however, brought back so vividly the recollection of my marvellous adventures, that I sat dreamily holding it in my hand, and it was fully half-an-hour before I resumed the writing of my letter."], [278, "266 CHAPTER XX A CELESTIAL VISITOR On the following day I conducted myself into the country, from sheer force of habit, there being nobody else at hand. I could not get an order to see any of my imprisoned deities until Thurs day, and I had no other interest in remaining in town. A run by train to Reigate, and a walk from thence along the Box Hill ridge to Dorking, in lovely weather, did me a world of good ; and I returned to my dinner with the most plausible apology for an appetite which I had brought to the table for fifteen or sixteen days. During the railway journey home the sky became rapidly overcast, and I saw that we were in for a dark, misty evening. We men are a greedy lot, and I myself plead guilty to being among the greediest of all. If any man ever bore a heavy burden upon his back, I was thus encumbered at the present moment ; and yet under the influence of a good dinner the packages seemed to roll out of the wallet one by"], [279, "A CELESTIAL VISITOR 267 one. Jemima sent me in such an excellent plate of nice hot soup, and such a cut of salmon, and such a leg of lamb, and such a bundle of asparagus, and such a raspberry-and-currant tart, that when the feast was over, and I sat in my easy-chair, with a bottle of good claret on a little table beside me, I really began to look on the bright side of as dismal a picture as ever was painted by the Spanish school, and to hope that some impossible combination of events might yet arise, under cover of which my captive divinities should be freed. As I sat pondering thus, alternately despon dent and sanguine, the bottle of claret became gradually empty, and the clock of a neighbouring church struck ten. I was on the point of going out to take a turn in the damp air before retiring to rest, when I heard wheels as of a hansom stop short at the front door, followed by an impatient thumping of the knocker and a needlessly violent ringing of the bell. Fifteen seconds afterwards a boy in knickerbockers burst into the room, pushing himself in front of the maid-servant who had opened the door for him, and cried out, in a voice which I seemed to know \u2014 \"O Praxy, will you please come down and pay the cabman, for I haven't got a farthing ? \""], [280, "268 VENUS AND CUPID \"Why, Ganny!\" exclaimed I, frightened out of my wits, and yet equally overjoyed; \"how in the name of wonder did you come here ? \" But for the good dinner and the bottle of claret, I really believe I should have fainted like a woman. \"Tell you all about it presently,\" was the reply; \"but the man wants his money.\" \" How far has he driven you ? \" I enquired, the practical-mindedness of the boy recalling me to myself. \"Haven't the least idea; but it's of the greatest possible importance that you should find out, so please be sure and make him tell you. Are you listening to what I say?\" continued he, observing that I still looked dazed. \"All right,\" I answered, taking a few sih'er pieces out of my purse ; \" I quite understand.\" And I ran doAvn to the front door. The man demanded half-a-crown, which was probably too much, and gave me an excuse for requiring minute details of place and distance. \" It's over four miles, sir, I do assure you, as you may see by looking at the book. You know Barton Court Road, sir, I suppose?\" \"Yes; but which end of it? The road is half a mile long.\""], [281, "A CELESTIAL VISITOR 269 \"Why, the farther end, sir, where there's a boys' school and a large playing-field. The young gentleman came out by the field-gate, and that's where he hailed me.\" I paid the half-crown and remounted the stairs. \" Now,\" said I to my young visitor, \" before we begin to talk about anything else, you must have some food. Aren't you pretty nearly dead with hunger ? \" \"Well, Praxy, I could eat a cold fowl or two if there were any such things lying about the table. But where are all the others ? Are they gone to bed already ? \" \"Shan't tell you anything at all about them until you have had your supper.\" So I rang the bell for the maid, who briskly served the boy with the best that Jemima had to offer ; and Ganymede pounded away for fiA'e and thirty minutes at various miscellaneous dishes, until he declared that he could do no more. Then we got rid of the empty plates and glasses, and I began my story. \" Gone to bed ? \" I repeated, in answer to his last question \u2014 \" well, I don't rightly know. Judging from the early hours kept at the estab lishments where most of them are staying, I"], [282, "VENUS AND CUPID 270 think it highly probable ; but what I do know is this \u2014 that Apollo is in a madhouse, and Diana in prison for a month, and Mercury for three times as long, and Bacchus and Cupid for a fortnight each ; that Hercules is in the con- demned cell at Newgate, where he will remain until he is taken away to be hanged for murder; that Venus is going to be married the day after to-morrow to some young fool of an English nobleman ; and that Neptune has already united himself in not very holy wedlock to the landlady of these lodgings, and has gone off with her on their wedding-tour. Perhaps that amount of news may be about as much as your small mind can take in for the present; and now I want to know how you contrived to find me out, and what brought you here?\" \" Why, Praxy, it's positively frightful ! \" said the boy, wholly unable to realise the tragic horror of the tale. \" But what have they all been doing ? And why ever didn't you rub the stone before ? \" \"Rub the stone?\" repeated I, clutching at it instinctively with my left hand, and remembering the occurrence of last evening towards this very hour. \" And pray am I indebted for the honour"], [283, "A CELESTIAL VISITOR 271 of this celestial visit to the accident of my having rubbed this stone ? \" \" To be sure you are. My mother always said that those stones possessed great virtue, and I see noAV that they must be very virtuous indeed. I had just filled a cup of wine for Jupiter, and was handing it to him, when I felt all of a sudden a sharp burning pain in my chest, and before he could take hold of the handle I let the goblet fall. It was the first time I ever did such a thing in my life, and he was so furious that I thought he would make an end of me. But I tore open my shirt and showed him where I felt the pain, and he forgave me. Then I took out the stone, and noticed that it was scratched all over with letters on both sides. The letters were as red as fire, and Jupiter told me to copy them down at once while they shone out brightly. On one side was written \"15 Burnham Place,\" and on the other \"Warwick Road.\" Neither Jupiter nor I could pro nounce the words, so we showed them to Minerva, who knew no more what they meant than we did. However, she kindly said she would make a note of it, and went away to consult the ghosts of the seven wise men. Meanwhile I wrote them down; and the moment I had finished, the fires went out,"], [284, "VENUS AND CUPID 272 and the stone looked just as usual. Then I told Jupiter that I had given the other half of the stone to you, and he said that it must be a message.\" \"'You had better go down on the eagle,' said he, 'and see what's the matter; only be sure and take that bit of paper with you, or you won't be able to find the way.' So I started off next morning directly after breakfast, and here I am.\" \" It's the luckiest thing in the world ! \" said I, rushing about the room, half-wild with joy. \"You must go back and tell Jupiter what a plight these gods and goddesses are in, and persuade him to interfere. I suppose he can whisk them all back to Olympus again if he chooses, can't he, just as he whisked them down to the Piraeus ? He has only got to raise his awful hand, and issue a decree, and there isn't a prison on this earth that could hold any one of them.\" \" I don't exactly know what he does in such a case,\" replied the boy ; \" I rather think he sneezes. But of course he can manage it somehow. Shall I go now directly ? \" \" No ; wait here and rest for an hour or two, and get away before daylight to-morrow morning. Where have you left the eagle ? \" \" In a tent at the corner of a field, with a lot of"], [285, "A CELESTIAL VISITOR 273 bats and balls lying about on the turf, and some shoes with spikes in the soles. I kept on kicking my feet against them as I felt my way along. It was pitch dark when we dropped into the field ; but I could just make out the white canvas of the tent, so I led the eagle up to it and drew aside the awning and fixed him in. I had brought his supper with me ; and I heard some drops of water trickling into a tank close by against the wall of the house, so I filled a watering-pot that I had the luck to stumble over, and gave the old bird some thing to drink. Just then I heard a sudden stamp ing of feet and clatter of voices, as if about a hundred boys were going upstairs to bed ; and a minute afterwards the top story of the house was lighted up, and half-a-dozen boys threw open their windows and looked out into the field, chat tering across to one another from room to room. I stayed in the tent feeding the eagle until the windows were shut and the house seemed quiet, and then I followed the wall till I came to a high double gate, fastened by a wooden peg on the inside. I let myself out and pulled the gate to ; but, as the peg is hanging down loose, I can easily get in again by lifting the latch. For a few minutes I stood looking up and down the road, and won- s"], [286, "VENUS AND CUPID 274 dering which way to turn, when a horse and a great black hood came slowly round the corner of a street only a few yards off, with a fellow perched up behind them. I ran up to him and showed him my paper, which he read by the light of his lamp, and then told me to jump into the hood. I supposed it must be a cab, but I never saw one like that before. It was a jolly sort of a machine to ride in, and we bowled along like mad ; but you see I didn't know the name of the road where I got in, and that's the reason why I wanted you to ask the driver.\" \" I know exactly where it is,\" said I, \" and I could take you there directly. The house is a large private school, and the boys are not likely to look into their cricket tent until after breakfast in the morning. But you must be back again in the field by three o'clock at the very latest, or there may be light enough for somebody to see the eagle. There was no dog anywhere about, was there ? \" \" Not that I could see or hear. There were any amount of cats, and one of them was white ; so I shied a big leather ball at it, and smashed a window.\" \" That was a mild thing to do, considering that you were hiding.\""], [287, "A CELESTIAL VISITOR 275 \" It was, rather ; but you see I don't often get a chance.

I shall never be able to carry in my head the pranks these gods and goddesses have been playing, and the names of the prisons where the mortals have locked them up. Hadn't you better write it all down for me, just as you said it off a little while ago, so that the Jew may know exactly what to do, and where to lay his awful hand upon them ? \" \"That's a first-rate idea,\" said I, getting up from my chair to carry out his suggestion. \"You're a clever boy, Ganny.\" \" So would you be a clever boy, if you had had to fill a quart pot to the brim fifteen times a day for three thousand years, and hand it to a gouty monarch on a slippery marble throne, without spilling a drop upon the floor.

If Cupid is not set free by ten o'clock on Saturday morning, he'll get twelve cuts with a nice, long, wiry birch, and I believe those gaolors hit precious hard.\" \"What for?\" asked Ganymede. \" For peppering dogs and carriage-horses with a catapult, and breaking half the lamp-glasses in the Park.\" \" How I wish I'd been there to help him ! \" exclaimed the boy, clapping his hands Avith glee. \" Do tell me all about it ! \" And so, cherishing"], [289, "A CELESTIAL VISITOR 277 a good hope that all would now go well, I re counted to my young visitor the various exploits of his playfellow, with a lighter heart than I had carried within me since the first week of our stay in London.

I then threw myself on the sofa, with an alarum close against my head, not daring to undress for fear I should not wake in time. At a quarter past two I woke the boy, and we let ourselves quietly out of the house, walking briskly along the streets until we met a cab, which soon set us down in Barton Court Road. It was a dull, cloudy morning, and we entered the playing-field unperceived. As we shut the gate behind us, I heard the low chuckling in the eagle's throat which I had noticed on the first memorable evening at the Piraeus, and I knew that the bird had become aware of his young master's approach, and was happy.

Periodically a flutter of excitement is caused by the arrival of some solitary fisherman, who sets all tongues a-wagging upon the question whether he will make up to Miss Finch, Miss Baker, or Miss Green. Among a rural population such as this news gets about, though no one spreads it ; and the whispered announcement that a grand English lord was going to marry a lovely foreigner of distinction, by special license from His Grace the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, drew quite a concourse of swains and spinsters to the pretty little Parish Church, shortly after ten o'clock on Thursday the 28th of May. A special license is not so easily obtained as it used to be ; and how my love-stricken landlady managed to get hers is best known to herself and the learned gentleman who took the fees. The ceremony itself was intended to be of the simplest character possible, the bridegroom even entertaining the hope that there would be no"], [292, "280 VENUS AND CUPID one present except the clergyman, the clerk, the necessary witnesses, and the happy pair. He was not a little disgusted, therefore, to find, on entering the sacred building, that every bench was occupied by a row of well-dressed parishioners, while a crowd of gaping rustics choked up the aisles and doorways. No bride that ever stood at an altar-rail looked so magnificent as Venus \u2014 fresh as if she had just emerged from the waves of her native sea, rosy with the bloom of all summer flowers, sparkling with the light of a thousand loves, and towering over the heads of the tallest maidens near her, less by superiority in height than by dignity of carriage. A low murmur of uncontrollable adula tion rose up from the densely packed surface of human heads, as she trod like a veritable goddess between the long lines of spectators, and took up her place beside the handsome young lord. She was dressed entirely in Avhite, Avith no ornaments except a plain gold bracelet, which had been pre sented to her at Milan ; a coral necklace, the gift of the enthusiastic manager at Naples; and a rich diadem of costly pearls, which, as I had never seen it before, I supposed to be a tribute of affection from her noble lover. Other trinkets"], [293, "A COUNTRY WEDDING 281 indeed she possessed, had she been minded to wear them ; for almost every night during our exhibition some devoted admirer had cast at her feet a bracelet, or ring, or other jewelled toy. But on this her bridal day she had chosen to appear in the guise of beauty unadorned, and she could not have chosen better. The marriage service ran its accustomed course, nearly up to the point where the tying of the indissoluble knot may be said to begin. At this moment a rough and common-looking man, with smutty face and stout, brawny arms, appeared suddenly at a side door of the chancel, and elbowed his way through the crowd, until he reached the clear space at the altar rails, where stood the bride and bridegroom, with the offi ciating clergyman between them. He carried a large hammer in his right hand, and in his left a dainty little pair of delicately fashioned hand cuffs, apparently quite new. He walked very lame, and resembled nothing so much as a black smith who had just left his forge. \" Now, missus,\" said the man in Greek, speak ing with a strangely quiet but decisive voice, \"just you come along with me ; \" and in an instant he had seized the bride by the arm,"], [294, "282 VENUS AND CUPID clapped the handcuffs round her wrists, and tapped the bolt which secured them with his hammer. Venus turned deadly pale, but offered no resistance, and raised no cry. The clergyman fell back aghast, as if he had seen an apparition from the grave ; while Lord Alconbury stood erect, twitching his hands convulsively, and making visible and painful efforts to step for ward, but palpably unable either to speak or to move a limb. The intruder went hobbling along, with his hammer in one hand, and the right arm of Venus tightly grasped in the other, the crowd falling aAvay at his approach Avith openly professed awe ; till on reaching the bottom of the nave, he passed into the porch which led out of the north aisle, and closed the door behind him. Near this spot I had selected my own seat, not caring to be observed by either Lord Alconbury or his bride ; and as Venus and her conductor turned the corner to gain their exit, the dress of the lovely goddess SAvept my own garments with so close a touch that I instinctively muttered a commonplace apology for standing in the Avay. She recognised my voice, and raised her eyes to mine. It was clear that she connected me in some way or other with the frustration of her"], [295, "A COUNTRY WEDDING 283 scheme ; and as long as I live I shall never forget the look of hatred, disgust, and threat ened vengeance with which she was pleased to favour me. The instant that the door was shut, Lord Alcon bury appeared to recover his normal sprightliness and his presence of mind ; and, after an exchange of hurried whispers with the clergyman, he started off in pursuit of the fugitives with rapid strides. An obsequious rustic held open the door as he gained the bottom of the nave ; and no sooner had his lordship passed out than the entire crowd of spectators endeavoured to pass out after him. The crush at the doorway was indeed so great as to become dangerous ; and the clergyman, hurrying down towards the spot, entreated his flock to respect the sanctity of the building, and to file out in decent order. Foreseeing what must of necessity happen, I had already taken the precaution to Avalk up the nave, and to slip out quietly at the side door, by which the limping man had entered. \" Did anybody see which way they went ? \" cried the widowed bridegroom, addressing those of the congregation who had made their way into the churchyard. His lordship, howeA'er, had been"], [296, "284 VENUS AND CUPID the first except myself to quit the building, and the question was futile. \" They must have gone through the lych-gate, your honour,\" said a rustic, \" unless they climbed the wall.

A lame man with a hammer, leading a handcuffed lady all in white, forms a group sufficiently con spicuous to attract attention even in the twilight ; and the group in question, if it passed at all, must have passed through a populous village street at mid-day. Since the moment when the inner door of the church porch closed upon the goddess and her gaoler, no mortal eye had ever seen them ; and no mortal eye will see them ever again. I watched the croAvd emerging from the door way, and the anger of the ladies whose finery had been torn and battered in the crush, and the disappointed fury of the noble lord whose lady had been snatched rudely from his grasp at the very instant when she was to be made his own."], [297, "A COUNTRY WEDDING 285 I heard men saying how strange it was that nobody seemed to have the power to move, though all were indignant at an interruption so unseemly. I heard women upbraiding the clergy man because he collapsed with fright, and the bridegroom because he never raised a finger in defence of his own assaulted bride, and the churchwardens because they did not seize the committer of the outrage, and the rustics at the doorway, because they suffered him to pass through. I heard them marvel, as if it were the strangest feature of the scene, at the apathetic, not to say paralysed, demeanour of the lady herself, who neither screamed, nor scratched, nor fainted, but permitted herself to be led away tamely like a lamb. But how much more they marvelled, and how they quarrelled over their marvelling, and by what theories they sought to account for the strange apparition, and the yet stranger vanishing into space, which they had witnessed at that bridal scene, I cannot tell. For myself, I had seen and heard enough ; I was more than satisfied ; I should see and hear no more if I watched the bewildered congregation until the last of them had gone home to dinner. The decree had evidently gone forth which"], [298, "VENUS AND CUPID 286 should save the first of my eight divine offenders from the committal of a folly and a crime.

Cupid and Bacchus were both undergoing their fourteen days at Wandsworth, and with that penal establishment I would begin. I presented my order, and was ushered at once into the somewhat cramped apartment occu pied by my little friend. He was busy as usual with his nets, and was driving dull care away with whistlings which might have driven away the devil. \"Well, Q!\" said I; \"you don't look much like an incarcerated deity. You're as merry this morning as if you were flying about Olympus.\" \"And you don't look much like a personal conductor that has brought eight gods and god desses to grief, and is going to be split in half with a thunderbolt, for not taking better care of 2S7"], [300, "288 VENUS AND CUPID them. Something queer has happened since you were here last, I'm certain. Tell us all about it, Praxy.\" I described, in the fewest possible Avords, the scene of the wedding at Sedgeworth, and Cupid laughed till the warder thought he would go into a fit. \"That's the way with Mummy,\" said he, with more truth than filial piety. \" She tried on just the same sort of game with Mars, and I don't know how many more people ; but she ahvays gets caught and collared. Oh, what a glorious lark ! I do so wish I'd been there ! \" \" You unnatural little brat ! \" said I, \" to laugh at your Mamma's discomfiture.\" \"And how did old Dot-and-go-one find it out ? \" asked Cupid. \"Ah, how indeed? but he found it out some how. And Avho knows but somebody else may have found out by this time that a naughty little god has been locked up, and is going to be whipped for taking pot shots at the horses' tails with his catty ? \" \"There goes twelve o'clock, sir,\" said the warder, turning the key of the door. \" Your half-hour's fully up, and the young gentleman must come with me and take his airing.\""], [301, "IN SPITE OF BOLTS AND BARS 289 \" Wait a second,\" cried Cupid, who thoroughly understood the signal; \"ask him to let me open the window \u2014 it's always opened while I'm out in the court from twelve to one; and if you'll hoist me on to the ledge, Praxy, I can reach the cord and do it myself.\" The warder laughed to see the boy coolly jumping on my back, and wriggling himself upwards until he sat upon my shoulders, whence he sprang upon the ledge and began unfastening the cord. With a farewell spank upon each of his brown legs, I left him standing at least ten feet below the little trap-door window, and turned to leave the cell. A good many funny things had taken place since the first time when he sat upon my shoulders, just fourteen weeks ago. \"That's a nice lad, sir,\" said the warder, as as he held the door again for me to pass. \" Pity he should ever have been sent to such a place as this ; but it won't be for long.\" \"No,\" answered I, \"it won't; and meanwhile it's a comfort to me to know that he is with people who treat him kindly. This is my stair case, isn't it ? Well \u2014 a thousand thanks, and good-morning to you ! \" I had not taken halt a dozen steps when the T"], [302, "VENUS AND CUPID 290 warder called me back, in a voice that spoke of lungs and consternation. \"The prisoner's gone, sir!\" he cried, looking wildly up and down the cell. \" I'm sure you'll bear me witness that he never passed the door way. He must have escaped by the window while our backs were turned \u2014 and yet,\" he added, pointing to the ten feet of whitewashed wall without a scratch upon it, \" even that's impos sible. There isn't a cat in the prison as could do it. This is the most extraordinary thing I ever saw or heard of; and what ever shall I do ? \" \"Well,\" said I, with an honest but entirely unsuccessful effort to conceal my joy, \" in your case I should lock the door, and communicate as quickly as possible Avith the sentinels outside the window. I presume the whole circuit of the prison is guarded.\" \" You're right, sir; and I ought to have thought of it before, but I was that dazed I could think of nothing.\" The sentinels declared that not a living creature had been seen upon the walls. The alarm was spread in every quarter that a prisoner had fled ; and in two minutes I found myself in the deputy governor's room, corroborating the warder's state-"], [303, "IN SPITE OF BOLTS AND BARS 291 ment with regard to the incomprehensible dis appearance of his young charge. I was just signing a deposition which a clerk had written down, when another warder came hastily into the room, and reported that No. So and-so, the young Greek who was serving his fourteen days for drunkenness, had contrived by some means or other to scale the wall of the yard into which he and a gang of other prisoners had been turned loose for exercise. \" The wall is twenty-seven feet high, sir,\" said the man, \" and has three rows of bricks without mortar at the top, not one of which has fallen ; and no one saw him climb it, and the sentinels are quite positive that nobody dropped down on the outer side.\" \" You have brought your friends good luck this morning, Mr. Tomkins,\" observed the deputy gov ernor, putting on his eyeglasses, and taking up my card. \" Such an unusually remarkable concur rence of events might almost justify my asking whether you could suggest any explanation of these marvellous flights, were it not sufficiently obvious that you had no more hand in them than I had. Do me the favour to add your London address to the deposition ; and I need hardly say"], [304, "VENUS AND CUPID 292 that we shall expect you to afford every assistance to the police, in case the fugitives should betake themselves to your protection.\" \" Certainly, sir, you may depend upon my doing so,\" I replied, rather surprised at getting off so easily. The coincidence was undoubtedly sug gestive of suspicion ; and yet how could any reasonable man suppose that a harmless personal conductor had any means of spiriting a couple of prisoners over the walls and through the windows of a strongly guarded metropolitan gaol ? From Wandsworth I took a cab to Newgate, where Diana and Mercury had for the present been accommodated with rooms, though it was intended that they should be removed almost immediately into more commodious quarters. By way of fortifying myself against the probable shock occasioned by my first A-isit to a condemned cell, I took the precaution to eat a substantial luncheon on the way. On reaching the prison, and enquiring for my friends, I was ushered at once into the presence of the deputy governor. \"You called to see the three Greek prisoners, I understand, Mr. Tomkins,\" said that high official, politely waving his hand towards an unoccupied chair."], [305, "IN SPITE OF BOLTS AND BARS 293 \"Yes, sir; I should esteem it a favour to be allowed to speak with each of them for a few minutes. I am the only person in London whom they know.\" \" Quite so. You are probably unaware, Mr. Tomkins, that all three of them contrived to escape from the prison between twelve and one o'clock this afternoon ? \" I envy the people in the novels who can always command their features. I have no control over mine whatever. My expressive face beamed in stantly with a glad smile of thankfulness, and my delight could not have been more transparent if I had waved my hat in the air and given three hearty cheers. \"Well, Mr. Tomkins?\" said the deputy governor, with a look which gave me to under stand that he expected a reply. \"I assure you, sir,\" answered I, \"that this is the first I have heard of it, and that I know no more how they got away than you do.\" \"Are you prepared to account for your own disposal of that particular hour, Mr. Tomkins ? \" \" Certainly, sir. I spent it at Wandsworth, in company with another Greek prisoner who be longed to my unfortunate travelling party. And"], [306, "VENUS AND CUPID 294 it happens, by a most singular coincidence, that he and a comrade both escaped, during the period of my visit, from that very gaol. So there are five of them gone altogether. It is one of the most remarkable circumstances Avhich I can call to mind.\" \" Very remarkable indeed ! \" said the deputy governor, looking at me with ever-increasing mistrust. \"Were you inside the prison, Mr. Tomkins, when this double flight took place?\" \" Not only inside the prison, sir, but just out side one of the cells. The warder had opened the door to let me out, and while thus engaged, with his eyes for an instant in the passage, the prisoner appears to have flown out of the window.\" \" I fear, Mr. Tomkins,\" said the official, after a short pause \u2014 \" I fear it will be my duty to detain you for the present in custody.\" \" I think not, sir,\" I replied. \" I can quite understand your astonishment at these mys terious escapes, and your anxiety, as a respon sible officer of the gaol, to account for them. But I am sure it needs hardly a moment's reflection to convince you that such anxiety does not justify your suspicion of one who, on the face of it, is"], [307, "IN SPITE OF BOLTS AND BARS 295 as palpably innocent as yourself. These five prisoners were certainly travelling under my charge, and Avith equal certainty misbehaved themselves. But I am in no way compromised by their misbehaviour ; and I might have washed my hands of the entire party, and left them to shift for themselves, had I been so disposed. The fact that I have remained in London to see them through their troubles, and defrayed the expenses of their trial because they were friend less foreigners, and visited them from time to time in prison, is surely no reason for fixing upon myself any connivance at their escape. Except by the exercise of magic, which is absurd, it was clearly impossible that I should have set five prisoners free, all at once. And if you pro pose to charge me with liberating one of the five, which of them, may I ask, do you think I liberated ? and who liberated the rest ? The one to whom I was nearest, and the only one whom I have seen to-day, escaped from his cell after I had left it ; and the warder himself, assuming all respon sibility for his flight, begged me as an eye witness to sign a statement in the presence of the deputy governor, exculpating him from blame.\" Of course there was no plausible pretext for"], [308, "296 VENUS AND CUPID detaining me, and I do not believe that the official would have ventured to hint at such a thing, had I not been fool enough to annoy him by grinning all over my face with exultation. \" I believe you are right, Mr. Tomkins,\" he said, after a while ; \" though I am sure you will agree with me that in the case of five simul taneous escapes so clever, so daring, and so incredibly successful, somebody or other must have been pulling the strings.\" \"Somebody must, indeed,\" said I, smothering a stupid smile with the most hideous grimace conceivable. \" Do you feel the heat of the room ? \" enquired the deputy governor civilly. \" Not at all, thank you. It was only a twinge of neuralgia in one of my wisdom teeth \u2014 I am subject to it.\" \"And may I ask, Mr. Tomkins, whether you have any theory of your own on the question of these wonderful flights, which might perhaps help us to a clue ? \" \" None whatever, sir, except this \u2014 that the Greeks are a most surprisingly sharp and cunning people. I have travelled in their country a good deal, and I haA'e seen things done, by men in no"], [309, "IN SPITE OF BOLTS AND BARS 297 degree above the average national intelligence, which would baffle the vigilance and astuteness of all the police in London. A typical Greek is in every sense so slippery that there are no pos sible means of holding him. I quite admit that the escape of five prisoners at the same moment is nothing short of a marvel ; but if only one or two had got away, I should have thought it the most natural occurrence in the world. I doubt whether there's a prison in England that could keep a moderately clever Greek within its walls, if he had a mind to scale them.\" I left the deputy governor my address, giving him the same promise which I had given at Wandsworth, and was allowed to go. Right joyously did I rush into the depths of the nearest hansom, where I could grin unseen, and chuckle to my heart's content without endangering my liberty. I caused myself to be driven to the terminus at Paddington, and took the next train to Hanwell. \" Just three hours and twenty minutes too late, sir,\" said the hall-porter, as he let me in. \"Your friend gave us the slip about half-past twelve this afternoon, and not a mortal creature in the Asylum saw him go. It's the most remarkable thing, sir,"], [310, "298 VENUS AND CUPID that has happened all the five and twenty years that I have been connected with Hanwell.\" \" Dear me ! \" exclaimed I, \" this is very un fortunate. I was in hopes that the patient was getting better. Is the superintendent disen gaged ? \" \"Yes, sir, and he will no doubt be glad to see you. Be so good as to step this Avay.\" The superintendent knew nothing as yet about the escape of the five prisoners, and I had no particular interest in telling him the story. But it occurred to me that the withholding of so sensational a piece of news might hereafter in crease suspicion against myself; so I recounted the events of the last few hours, to his profound astonishment, and went my way. About five o'clock I returned to my rooms in Burnham Place, and asked Jemima to send me up some tea. While waiting for it I became aware that a visitor had been admitted into the hall ; and the maid Avho brought in the tray, bearing what the lady novelists are pleased to call the \"tea equipage,\" announced at the same time the arrival of \" a gentleman.\" \" Glad to see you, Lord Alconbury,\" said I, ordering the addition to the \" equipage \" of"], [311, "IN SPITE OF BOLTS AND BARS 299 another cup and saucer. \" I dare say the tea will be strong enough for two.\" \" So it turned out to be Venus after all ! \" said my visitor, as soon as we were left alone. His lordship looked like a man who had been pro digiously sold, but who derived no little com fort from the thought that the individual who had sold him was of sufficient importance to shed lustre upon his victim. Better be snubbed by a divinity than toadied by a plebeian. \" I don't quite understand you, my lord,\" said I. \" I think you understand me pretty well,\" he rejoined. \"You know nothing whatever of what took place this morning at Sedgeworth, I suppose ? \" \" Yes,\" I replied ; \" I believe I may say that I know everything that took place there\u2014 that is, between the hours of ten and eleven.\" \" Did you happen to be in the church ? I had not the pleasure of seeing you.\" \" I went, my lord, as an uninvited guest, for which indiscretion I trust you will accept my apologies; and I witnessed the whole ceremony, from its auspicious commencement to its abrupt and extraordinary close.\" \"And have you formed any theory with re-"], [312, "VENUS AND CUPID 300 spect to the\u2014 a \u2014 the person who interrupted the proceedings ? \" \" He struck me as bearing a very strongly marked resemblance to a certain mythological character with whose figure every schoolboy is familiar. Beyond that point, I have formed no theory whatever.\" \" It has been a most remarkable adventure ! \" observed his lordship, caressing his short, crisp, densely wooded beard, and wearing the same expression of mingled annoyance and self-com placency as before. \"Very remarkable indeed,\" said I. \"But other metropolitan sites have witnessed scenes of wonder on this eventful day besides the modest village of Sedgeworth. You are per haps unaware, my lord, that all five of the Greek prisoners ha\\re escaped from their re spective cells, and that Apollo has liberated himself from his confinement at Hanwell ? \" \" You don't say so ! \" exclaimed Lord Alcon bury, in amazement. \"And so they were real gods and goddesses after all ! \" he resumed, when I had finished my story. \" It would almost appear so,\" I replied, \"were the thing not physically impossible.\""], [313, "IN SPITE OF BOLTS AND BARS 301 \" Well, Mr. Tomkins,\" said his lordship\u2014\" if you are Mr. Tomkins \u2014 you may be Praxiteles in sober earnest, or Pan in disguise, for all I know \" \" My lord ! \" I exclaimed with dignity, inviting the attention of my visitor to a pair of feet and legs which my friends have always taught me to contemplate as particularly well shaped and comely \u2014 by way of convincing him that I bore no suspicion of a goat about my terminations \u2014 \" my lord ! you do me too great an honour. There is nothing even semi-divine about me in limb or body.

But if you care to make yourself ridiculous by telling a story which nobody except a lunatic will be lieve, go and tell it, by all means, this evening at your club, and take the consequences. Shall I pour you out another cup of tea ? \" Soon after dinner a four-wheeled cab droA'e up to the door, and disgorged a portly matron of mature but still blooming years, together with an incredible array of boxes and bundles. \" He has left me, Mr. Tomkins ! \" cried my landlady, in a lamentable voice, coming into the sitting-room the moment she had finished squab bling about the fare. \" Left you, Mrs. Jones \u2014 I beg pardon, Mrs. Neptune ? How heartless ! how abominable ! Pray take a chair, and tell me all about it. Dear me! it's a wicked world.\" \" Yes, Mr. Tomkins,\" said the doubly Avidowed widow. \" He went off this morning, just as we had sat down to an early dinner, in order that we might enjoy a nice long afternoon in a sailing boat on the Thames. I had bought him a ready made nautical suit of blue serge, with brass buttons and anchors on 'em \u2014 cost me three pound ten, Mr. Tomkins \u2014 and a straw hat ; and"], [315, "IN SPITE OF BOLTS AND BARS 303 he did look beautiful. Well, sir, we were dining at a table by ourselves in the garden of the Clutterbuck Arms, and had barely finished our first dish of pickled salmon, when Neptune got up and said, ' Excuse me, my love, I'll be back directly.' I know he said that, though it was all in Greek, by the way he waved his seafaring hands. Take my advice, Mr. Tomkins, and don't ever fall in love with a young woman as you can't talk to. Expressive looks and fiddlin' with the fingers is all very well for a time, but a conversation carried on in that style for several days on end becomes irksome. Well, he walked into the house, and I finished the rest of the pickled salmon, which was that good, I couldn't find it in my heart to leave it \u2014 and still the captain stayed away. I waited and waited, and wouldn't touch the shoulder of Iamb, though it was getting so cold that the grease floated about on the gravy like icebergs. At last I got up and went to look for him ; but he wasn't in our own room, nor in the dining-room, nor in any of the public rooms, nor nowhere. He must have gone off of his own accord, for he took all his property with him \u2014 or rather, my property I should say, for not a thing except the shoes he stood in was his own.\""], [316, "VENUS AND CUPID 304 \"What a villain he must have been, Mrs. Neptune ! \" \" No, sir ; don't call him that, I beg.

What with the special license, and the presents, and the expensive way we lived, and the first-class travelling, and the suit of sailor's clothes \u2014 I'm fifty pounds out of pocket, Mr. Tomkins, if I'm a penny, though my fun didn't last five days.

I've been badly treated, Mr. Tomkins, if ever a woman was. But it is a consolation to have been made the dupe of a deity.

I don't imagine that a great many of them will believe you.\" And then I recounted the tale of the asylum and the prisons, and dismissed the good lady to her own apartments, to bewail her second widowhood at her leisure. While sitting afterwards alone I could not resist the inclination to discover, by means of my magic stone, whether the divinities were actually safe in their ethereal abode. Surely if I breathed again upon the surface, and rubbed it as before, Ganymede would fly down upon his eagle to find out what I wanted. I put my hand inside my shirt-front and drew forth the chain by which the locket had been secured, but the charm was no longer there. Its place was usurped by a dry, hard, wizened kidney-bean, as untalismanic in appearance as anything could be. Out of revenge for the inconvenience caused by my medicine, or by way of marking his displeasure at my supposed bad management of my celestial team, Jupiter had taken my treasure from me ; and the same irrevocable decree which had wafted the deities to heaven had whisked away also my only means u"], [318, "306 VENUS AND CUPID of communication with my friends on high. Con sidering that, but for my happy possession of the locket, the pet deity of Olympus would have been ignominiously whipped and the strong man hanged, I think Jupiter would have shown no more than common gratitude if he had permitted me to retain my plaything. Before retiring to rest that night I held a small audit of accounts, by way of ascertaining the precise financial condition in which my divinities had left me. I found that the traA'elling expenses for three months had amounted to less than a thousand pounds, and the fees in connection with the trials, including a small sum of money which I bestowed upon the unfortunate gardener's widow, to about five hundred. I Avas therefore a clear to the good; and, as the people at the head-office declined to accept any portion of my receipts, the profit was all my own. To this extent, I had every reason to con gratulate myself upon the successful issue of the undertaking. Nor could I honestly deny, when reviewing the experiences of the last thirteen weeks, that the greater part of the trip had been an unmixed pleasure. The month now almost ended had indeed brought me many an anxious"], [319, "IN SPITE OF BOLTS AND BARS 307 day and many a sleepless night ; but things had set themselves straight at last, and the time would doubtless come when I should be able to discover bright points in the hazy distance, even while looking back upon our troubled life in London.

I am the most obedient humble servant of the travelling public, and it will always afford me pleasure to pilot the British tourist to any quarter of the inhabited or uninhabited globe; I will go to Jerusalem, or to Madagascar, or to North and South America, or to the moon ; but never again, as long as I continue in the busi ness, will I take round a select party of gods and goddesses on a personally conducted tour.
