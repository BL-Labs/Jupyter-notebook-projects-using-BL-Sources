One is the editor of a magazine which is much given to articles by English noblemen, but a very good magazine withal, two or three numbers of which I have since read. Another is in a large banking-house downtown, and comes up to luncheon at the request of my friend. Still another is the son of a man who twenty-five years ago was an unknown law yer in a Western country town ; to-day he is the confidential attorney of several great financiers, and his son is an auniable idler. Another married a daughter of one of the two great millionnaire households here, and spends her money with eccentric lavish ness.

Another is the son of a Western man who made mill ions by the invention and exploitation of a machine for cutting wheat. The father of another discovered a process for coating pills, and his family mounts the golden stair of social prominence pellet by pellet. I cannot understand how it is that cer tain American critics sneer at this, and love to point out the grandfatherlessness of New York's social life. To me it is as a dream, as an incitement to ambition, as a magnificent social panorama gilded by the commercial prowess of vigorous men. As we leave the club one of these young men points across the way, and, as he says \"good-by,\" tells us he is going for a shave. The phrase, \" going for a shave,\" catches my ear ; I am soon enlightened. These correct and well-dressed young men, many of them, are shaved each day by a public barber.

This seems to me horribly dirty, and painfully disagreeable. Many men, I am told, never complete their toilet at home in the morning, but are shaved down town each morning. Their faces are pawed and patted and powdered by a negro, a German, or an Italian, and so left for the day. As I sit at dinner in the evening at the table of the weaver's son, I cannot forbear wondering how many of the gentlemen present were shaved by Germans, how many by Irishmen, how many by Italians, and so on.

Society, in Europe, has a certain re stricted meaning which enables one to pict ure to himself what \" in society \" means. It is not necessarily a brilliant distinction, but it is, at least, a sufficiently intelligi ble definition. But here \"society leader\" and ' ' club-man ' ' may mean something or nothing, as the case may be. Here again democracy exaggerates the very sentiments and positions it is supposed to ignore.

An old family means simply a family whose members have been, in one capacity or another, noteworthy and valuable citi zens for a century or two ; it means that, or merely that we are all equidistant from Adam, or, at various stages of develop ment, from some anthropoid ape. In short it has a perfectly definite meaning, or it has none. The foreigner is at first bewildered by this \" society woman,\" \"club-man,\" \"old family ' ' talk, and then amused by it. There are clubs, and very good clubs, here ; there is society, and very luxurious and bright society ; and there are some noteworthy citizens whose grandfathers were not hanged ; but there are seventy-five million people here also, and some few of them do not come under any of these three heads.

Saratoga is famous for its springs of mineral water, and for a certain kind of hotel-life during the summer, such as I have seen nowhere else in the world. Huge wooden structures, containing hun dreds of rooms, are opened during eight or ten weeks in the summer, and there flock thither, to live like bees in a hive, some thousands of people with a certain amount of money to spend. They all eat together, dance together iui the hotel par lors in the evening, lounge together on the hotel piazzas during the day, walk to and from the springs together, and if one could see through the partitions between the roouns as well as one can hear through them, the absolute absence of all personal privacy would be attained at last, and the crowd-loving American might look for ward to life hereafter in one of these"], [247, "African chiefs. 233 \"Society\" Saratoga hotels.

If Daudet or an equally caustic wit had been with me here, no doubt he would have said that Saratoga explained to hiun the Destruction of Jerusalem, for the Jews are here in swarms. The negro servants were to me the most interesting feature of the exhibit. To see one of these negro waiters in a white apron, a tiui tray, covered with small bird-seed dishes, poised upon the upraised palm of his right hand, steeriuig his way through the maze of chairs, tables, and other waiters down the long dining-room, was to see a rare sight.

These black servants, and the dress and ornamentation of the women, made one feel as though one were wandering about in a mammoth aviary, peopled by birds of paradise attended by Africans. Women walk about the streets in the evening in evening dress and glittering with dia monds, and at the dances in the evening unintroduced strangers ask ladies to dance with them. No doubt, morally, everything is right enough ; but this hap-hazard social life, even for a few weeks, must result in producing a dissipated habit of mind and a certain easy looseness of manners, which can hardly be good for either matrons or maids.

It is a question, however, that only another century of American social and domestic history can answer whether this feminine social and domestic supremacy produces the happiest results. No one will deny that now, in America, the comfort of the man is subor dinated to that of the woman. Unlike most European countries, the men outnumber the women by something over a million and a half. This fact alone gives women a greater value here than elsewhere ; and when one is told that there are over two million widows, or one widow to every fifteen of the female population, this of itself possibly accounts for a certain topsy-turviness of the conjugal relation. What one would expect from this greater freedom and prominence of women holds good, for the divorces number seven pro cured by women to five procured by men.

The strange code of morals of these peo ple is thus brought more than ever into prominence. You may sit at dinner near a man who, a few hours before, saw the proof of an article reciting the nasty de tails of a social scandal, and who ordered it printed ; while if this same man told the same story at his club, steps would be taken to briuig about his resignation.

No doubt many Americans love to see their names in print, but they are usually those who deserve no such attention, and as for those who do not, life is sometimes made intolerable for them. Even from the low commercial stand point, it is estimated that many millions of the much-striven-for dollars are now ex pended in Europe by Americans, who frankly tell you that they have been hounded out of the country by the news papers. They have committed no graver fault than to be the possessors of large wealth, but the newspapers made privacy impossible to them, their children, or even their servants, and what money could not buy here, they have gone to Europe to buy in peace there."], [298, "The buying of news- papers. 284 America and tbe Americans Surely the wide-awake Yankee shop keeper will begin to see, ere long, that this class of newspaper proprietor is making more unoney for himself than he is making for them. Driving away the rich in order to feed the poor on sensations is, to be sure, a form of philanthropy, but in a commer cial country it is a form of charity that not only begins, but stays, at home, in a few newspaper offices. This freedom of the press has its advan tages, perhaps, in one particular respect, and that is, the general confidence on the part of the public that their newspapers are not, as a rule, bribed for financial or mer cantile purposes ; though no doubt the weaker provincial newspapers are regular ly subsidized by one side or the other in every great political campaign. Some times, when great questions of financial or econounic policy are at stake, enorunous sums are spent in this way, the party which does the subsidizing, of course, holding that such expenditure is a legitimate education of the people.

Be it said that this is true of many other departments of Ameri can life. The men are better than their work.

Everything that one says may be true, and still everything may be contradicted by the righteous wrath of some community where such and such a state of things does not exist.

I must take my chance with other visitors to America, should American critics deem my friendly and fraternal chronicle worthy of their notice at all. If I were asked to outline in a few para graphs the fundamental differences between this new civilization and the older civili zations of Europe, I should phrase the mat ter as follows : First, there is a strange exclusion of the more cultivated classes from even a proportionate share of author ity and responsibility in the governing machinery. The best men do not rule in domestic, nor guide in foreign, politics. They may do so indirectly, but they do not appear directly. This condition of affairs explains the rather happy-go-lucky political methods in vogue, and at the same time explains the fact that social life, \u2014 the polite world, \u2014 strikes the foreigner as be ing so unreal, so ineffective, so monotonous, so detached from great issues.

Second, there is undoubtedly social dis content in this new country, as there is in Europe. In Europe, however, this discon tent poses at least as a philosophy, in some places even as a religion, and dignifies its vagaries under the various sub-titles of social ism. Here the social discontent is, mainly, outspoken and vulgar jealousy. The result is what I have noted elsewhere, the fact that classes are farther apart, less in touch with one another here, than in Europe. This seems at first sight improbable, till one remembers that good-fellowship and even friendship may exist in spite of conflicting opinions, but never in spite of distrust and jealousy, particularly jealousy of this sordid kind.
