I confess I have but little to remark by way of Preface to this Epistle. If the work should be considered creditable, I have sufficient faith in the liberality of public criticism to believe that its merit will be acknowledged ; and if, on the contrary, it is worthless or indifferent, I am the last person in the world who would desire to hear it praised. It has always appeared to me, that unless a writer can feel that he has obtained the approbation of those who preside over the tribunal of Taste, he must be content to regard his labours as unprofitable and vain ; for critics are to literature what assay ers are to the precious metals, they alone can stamp it with the mark of value or distinguish the pure ore from the useless dross. Note.\u2014 As to the universal Peace anticipated in the Poem, 'tis altogether a poetical license, for who would be rash enough to prophecy such a Millennium, when every fifth man in Europe has a Minie rifle in bis baud, and even the Quakers of the Peace Society have ordered Colt's Revolvers for personal defence."], [6, ""], [7, "AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND ON THE USE OF RICHES. \" Non ego avarura Cum veto te fieri, vappara jubeo ac nebulonem. Est inter Tan aim quiddam, socerumque Viselli : Est modus in rebus; snnt certi denique fines, Quos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum.\" 'Tis strange how few with countless riches blest, E'er learn the mode in which to spend them best, Or keep the happy path, so hard to find, Where they can please themselves, yet serve mankind; Various their tastes, more various their desires, Each to some separate height of pride aspires; In power, rank, fortune, beauty, fame, or wit, All fondly hope some favourite aim to hit, Till urged to mad extremes they meanly fall, The hateful miser or vile prodigal. Explore the world, my friend, and you'll confess How seldom riches purchase happiness, Or grant their votaries that calm content Which oft to poverty by Heaven is lent; For when society you closely view, And Fortune's favourites through life pursue, Beneath their splendid state you'll rarely find The tempered sweetness of a happy mind, In which good sense and prudent tastes are nicely joined 'Tis strange, yet true, we seldom rest content With what kind Providence to us has lent,"], [8, "\u25a0> But envious ever all our neighbours hate, Who own a larger or more grand estate ; Even our equals we can rarely see Rise to distinction without jealousy ; But when what seem inferiors stand preferred, Our hearts with envy's blackest spite are stirred. 'Tis not to please himself the rich man spends, But rather to be envied by his friends; And hence far more he seeks to wound their pride, By using luxuries to them denied, Than with those luxuries his tastes to please, By adding to life's elegance or ease ; Do what he will, build, furnish, plant, or drain, If but one equal vie with him in vain, He sleeps content \u2014 he asks no higher aim, A rival lives who envies him his fame. Life thus becomes a warfare upon earth, In which wealth is more honoured far than worth ; Gold forms the ladder to each social grade, And honour sinks to be a market trade : High birth, great deeds, or actions stamp'd by fame. Were once deemed needful privilege to claim, But now each scoundrel, who can splendour buy, With dukes can rival and with princes vie. The millionaire must let proud neighbours know How rich he is by outward pomp and show ; If but his grace should drive a coach in four, Why Bufo just commands two horses more; Let lords dine if they will off silver plate, Bufo from gold must lap his soup in state; The wealthy merchant puffed with foolish pride, Must hold a spacious park to queens denied,"], [9, "Or lacqueys in such retinues support, You'd think at least they served a monarch's court; Yet just the more he lavishes expense, His neighbours but discern his want of sense ; The cit whose shuttered shop is closed at last, Must robed in velvet try to blot the past, And lest the world his recent rise should see, Contrive to forge a parchment pedigree, From heralds' books assume an ancient crest, And let some borrowed motto tell the rest. Yet neither splendour nor a large estate Can make rank fools rever'd, esteem'd, or great ; No ! thanks to common sense, at least some few Mere impudence despise and spurn it too; Judge greatness by the standard of the mind, And laugh at pomp if not to merit joined ; Pluck folly's feathers one by one away, And as the peacocks served the silly jay, With ridicule the purse-proud coxcomb's toils repay, Believe me, friend, if riches e'er work good, 'Tis when they fall to men with sense endued; Taste, reason, wit, alone can give them weight, And make their owners happy, wise, or great; Fortune in vain to fools her gifts may lend, They yield no pleasure, serve no useful end, For gold in folly's hand is power misplaced, And only feeds the fires of riot, lust, and waste. If nice discerning taste with riches came, And wealth and education were the same, Some vile vulgarities we should escape, Or see such things at least in decent shape;"], [10, "trace, But since true taste's an art gold cannot buy, False taste too often does its place supply, And hence ten thousand follies round us rise, To make us wish our neighbours were more wise True taste is prudent, and with humble means Makes life a constant change of pleasing scenes, Trusts to simplicity to gain her ends, And if she fails to charm, she ne'er offends ; Weds art to nature, giving each new grace, And touch whate'er she may, the skilful hand we False taste by vanity is led astray, And deems that beauty which is mere display, In tinsel lustre lavishes her store, Till ornaments are ornaments no more ; Or else such gorgeous colours she'll employ, Grace, elegance, and ease they quite destroy, Nay, just as larger her materials grow, Propriety she leaves for ostentatious show. True taste, oft with a solitary flower, Can shew you beauty in its fullest power, While her less gifted sister will entwine A hundred, thinking when she's smart she's fine. To manage riches with a prudent hand, Is a nice art few learn to understand; Some to profusion, some to avarice lean, Unwisely mad, or ignorantly mean, And where one heir a fortune can enjoy Ten round him in rank follies theirs' employ; Yet who with wealth endowed would e'er admit To use that wealth, his only want was wit : No ! the worst idiot fortune ever blest Holds his own view of spending it the best,"], [11, "j Thanks each kind friend he meets for sage advice, But counsel takes with whimsey or caprice. Oh Vanity, how many fools we find, By thee misled, make laughter for mankind, And, rob'd in folly's motley-covered gown, Rise high indeed, if ridicule's renown. Curio has taste for art, or fancies so, To fill his galleries what treasures flow, What painters with the sun begin their toil, What artists slave beneath the midnight oil ; From his bright walls what mingled worthies stare. C\u00e6sar, Erasmus, Pitt, the late Lord Mayor; If Titian's there, 'tis ten to one you meet In the next frame, some Cyprian of the street; Da Vinci, Claude, Murillo you admire, You turn, and, lo, all Drury Lane's on fire ! To Curio's banquet crowding guests arrive, For Curio's wine is worth a ten mile's drive; The feast begins \u2014 the sparkling cup flies round, High and more high does Curio's voice resound \u2014 'That Cuyp is fine, indeed,' observes a peer, A compliment the host can scarcely hear Ere he proceeds most eagerly to shew How little he of Cuyp or art can know : 'It is my lord, and so uniquely rare; I've ordered Cuyp its fellow to prepare, And shall commission the great Raphael soon, To paint a Virgin, or a new Cartoon, For 'tis my rule, we never should desert The mighty masters of pictorial art, To trust empirics who make art a trade, And think they paint when colour is displayed ;"], [12, "Yes, if our aim is art, high art, to reach, Such precepts night and morning we must teach ;' The ladies smiled ;the savans sipped their wine, And Curio thought he'd shewn his taste was fine. Some would be scholars thought, and hence affect A zeal to make their libraries select, As if ten thonsand books in purple bound Could change a blockhead to a wit profound ; In Flavio's study see what wonders rise, Hallam himself would view them with surprise ; The rarest manuscripts the world can show, Whose pages only moths and insects know ; To own them is enough for Flavio's boast, If fashion learn it through the Morning Post : Yet, should the Dean drop in, why Flavio stands With half the Christian Fathers in his hands, But shuns polemics while they talk together, By questioning the Dean about the weather ; The Dean retires \u2014 the saints on shelves take rest, And Flavio yawning asks if dinner's drest. Nimbo, more keen, of books makes no parade, Tho' Flavio's kinsman in the puffing trade; He knows to print a work is certain fame, Another finds the wit, and he the name, For editor and writer mean the same. On title pages Nimbo's honours shine, With Nimbo's portrait, like an alehouse sign; Grave matrons praise, while each expectant belle Exclaims \" did ever author write so well !\" Books for his autograph old maids prepare, And half the town ask locks of Nimbo's hair."], [13, "'Tis the worst ill which can the rich befall, When they believe they've taste with none at all, And tenfold worse, when candid friends stand by To say, ' spend more, then critics you'll defy.' Sir Ralph had wealth, and with it an estate, From ancestors past ages had deemed great ; The house a noble stately-looking pile, And model of Elizabethan style, Stood shaded from the winds and storms of heaven In grounds Queen Bess to Burleigh might have given : Sir Ralph by scheming architects was told The mansion for repairs was far too old, Besides, in times of progress such as ours, 'What eye,' said they, ' could bear those red-brick'd towers ? Zounds, sir, with your vast fortune, who would waste Comforts to please an antiquary's taste.' Sir Ralph consenting, journeyed up to town, And ere the moon had changed, his house was down. Now came the point \u2014 should he consult the schools, Or trust to his own fancy free from rules. 'Take,' cried one friend, ' the old Italian style, And worthy of Palladio raise your pile.' ' Stop,' said another, ' that suits not our isle; Old Gothic for the structure I advise, In medieval art all taste now lies.' ' Hold,' cried a third, ' to British science turn, And from Vanbrugh or Wren new graces learn.' Sir Ralph confused, with lots marked every plan, His butler drew out one, the work began. The pile completed, neighbours came to view, What could Sir Ralph, but ask their judgment, do."], [14, "* Your plan, my friend,' cried one, ' I should admire, If the grand entrance were a little higher.' Another came, and proved the work all wrong, The wings too short for a facade so long. A third thus spoke, 'your architects planned well, If you desired a terminus hotel; But if a mansion, in God's name I trust Their blunders you'll lay level with the dust.' ' What pile is this,' a passing stranger said, 'A house to hold the idiot or the mad ? ' Man ne'er made better guess since time begun, Though not for many raised 'twas built for one. On sumptuous banquets some their riches spend, As if a dinner were life's highest end ; And for one meal more preparation spare, Than would suffice to dine a new Lord Mayor ; If they converse, one theme they still repeat, And their world ends with judging what they eat; Such men as epicures are styled by fame, But gluttons I assert should be their name. French cooks, rare wines, an exquisite cuisine, Show plainly where Orgilio's thoughts have been ; For him what councils sit with weighty care, To ponder o'er his daily bill of fare ; For him what Soyers with immortal pen, Teach maids to fine a soup or truss a hen ; For him what hosts of marshalled cooks combine, What slaughtered victims bleed that he may dine; Seasons for him reversed in order run, And in his hothouse he cashiers the sun ; Lambs for his winter feasts in flannel grow, And strawb'ries bloom for him to spew on snow ;"], [15, "> Yet for one luxury, still he heaves a sigh, And asks the appetite gold cannot buy. Follies like these though great are venial still, Since their own authors only feel the ill ; But when mad libertines, by vice debased, Run through the wild career of wanton waste, 'Tis not themselves alone they sink to hell, But those who love too long and trust too well. What suffering crowds on profligates attend, The bankrupt neighbour and the ruined friend \u2014 The grey-haired father, into prison cast \u2014 The mother, hoping when all hope is past \u2014 The maniac wife, from whom all reason's flown \u2014 The murdered child \u2014 the harlot's dying groan. Scarce has the minor reached the long sought hour. When boundless wealth is placed beneath his power, Ere he to flatterers falls an easy prey, With few to guide and many to betray ; Charmed like the moth by Pleasure's dazzling light, Round the gay lamp he sweeps with eager flight, Till to the treacherous flame too close he flies, And like the insect flutters, falls, and dies. What hosts of gay retainers hailed the day, When Varro came o'er Ringwood's lands to sway ; Sweet were the bells that ushered in the morn, Soft through the forest rang the mellow horn ; Green were the garlands on each pictured wall, And loud the shouts that echoed through the hall ; Bright were the faces round the painted hearth, And jocund passed that festival of mirth; There Beauty bade her sweetest smile appear; There on the cheek of Age stood Pleasure's tear,"], [16, "> And young, and old, and rich, and poor were gay, To see that Ringwood's gloom had passed away. But far from Ringwood Varro roamed for fame, And soon to Ringwood gloom and darkness came ; In distant cities Varro's wealth was spent, At Ringwood agents asked a double rent, Which muttering farmers paid with discontent; No more the guest or tenant hailed the smoke That in the banner'd hall the feast bespoke ; But undisturb'd her web the spider spun, And bats flew out before the set of sun ; No more the sound of revelry was heard, Nor hound nor horn the silent forest stirred ; Lone grew the hall, deserted was its gate, And solitude once more was Ringwood's fate. Of learning Varro could not boast, at once A mere pretender and an arrant dunce, For college, university, and school Had left him as they found him, half a fool, Nor could five tutors and a bishop too, From him strike out one spark of wit to view ; Travel, kind friends advised, in hopes that such Might give his thoughts some sharpness, if not much So taking leave of classics off he went, To traverse, if not see the continent. O'er lands, o'er seas, o'er desert plains he flew, And as in stature so in vice he grew ; Paid every post marked down in Murray's track, And having tumbled ou the Alps, came back. An idler's life was held in high disgrace, Besides, professions gave e'en wealth a grace ; So some to him the church proposed, and there He might have spoiled a sermon or a prayer;"], [17, "Why not the army 1 \u2014 looking at his shape, But that was to be buried at the Cape ; A barrister that takes no briefs some said, Who, if he cannot plead, can dine instead; Friends stood in doubt perplexed, but all agreed, In Parliament, at least, he would succeed ; A hustings speech he could repeat by rote, And though he could not argue he could vote. Our hero soon a vacant borough sought \u2014 (For boroughs though reformed can still be bought ;) His bell was rung, a trusty lawyer came \u2014 It matters little here to tell his name, The cheques were cash'd, the agents did their work, And Varro reigned at * * * * like any Turk ; Such schemes require art, judgment, tact, we know, And gold, as Harwich and St. Alban's show : But should petition follow by mischance, Gold still can ship the voters off to France ! For gold (and Graham \" knows the reason why\") All statutes writs and sheriffs can defy : Thus, once more, Freedom saw her cause profaned, And one more blockhead proud St. Stephen's gained. The stinking carrion, though it taint the air, Will draw the eagle and the vulture there; So men of wealth to manly honour lost, Find in the world a mercenary host Of wretched flatterers who will friendship sell, To knave or devil, if they sell it well. Hence he that's rich discovers many friends, Who use his friendship for their private ends, Yet cloak their aims with such surprising skill, That, Proteus-like, they seem whate'er they will,"], [18, "And keep the cloven foot so well concealed, The friend's enriched before the knave's revealed ; Who blind their patron so he ne'er suspects them, Till in the gulf of ruin he detects them, Who always make it their prerogative, His wealth to squander and his gold to give ; But when that wealth is squandered, sneak away, Some other wretch to plunder and betray. Friends of the moment, flatterers of the hour, Slaves to the rich, and parasites to power, Who hold it as an axiom fit and just, The more to rob, the more they're put in trust; And who their master's ruin would subscribe, If but his foes presont a larger bribe ; A swarm of pestful vermin surely found, Wherever thoughtless prodigals abound \u2014 Vampires, whose sting is death to all they wound. Pimps, gamblers, bullies, every part they'll play, And fight like mercenary Swiss for pay ; Ready through each excess of vice to run, Until their patron's credit is undone, Which when effected they sneak out of sight, Like beasts of prey that shun th' approach of light Of such rank villains Varro had his share, Aud ne'er was victim blinder to their snare, Since he but proved a better sort of fool, Who grew more dull the more he went to school And always was employed committing treason Against the rules of common sense and reason, By plotting his own fall in such a way, As did his want of judgment quite betray- How swift the fall of giddy thoughtless minds, Whom flattery counsels and whom folly blinds,"], [19, "How soon the largest stores of wealth they drain. Untaught the toil required that wealth to gain, On such weak fools corruption's venom'd brood, Like scorpions fix to suck their daily food ; Scorpions more dire than any insect host, That ever smote with plagues th' Egyptian coast Enticed, allured, by this vile, impious crew, An adept in their vices Varro grew; By them instructed a new track he took, And what small share of sense he had forsook ; Turn'd gambler, rake, sot, drunkard, debauchee, A very monster of deep infamy ; A being quite insensible to shame, With vices which would soil a Wilmot's name, Or Sedley's, Ogle's characters pollute, If you to them such scandals should impute. Though once Peruvian mines could scarcely hold The more than princely heaps of Varro's gold, Yet day by day those heaps grew less and less, Squandered in rash profusion and excess ; His life became one desperate career, In which gross vice triumphant did appear, For scarcely a new crime could he begin So ransack'd was the catalogue of sin ; Hazard at night, and duels the next day, \u25a0 Always half mad from either wine or play, Now in low taverns with lewd harlots whoring, Now with buffoons in midnight orgies roaring, Debased by every crime of sensual lust, A creature never viewed without disgust, One morning saw ten thousand lost at play, The next he had as much in bills to pay;"], [20, "Bankers his bills politely did refuse, He pass'd by easy steps to scriveners and Jews ; Estates were mortgaged, farms and studs were sold, And all his parchments pledged away for gold ; Beneath the sounding axe whole forests fell To pay one evening's work at Crockford's hell ; His flocks were seized, his favourite hounds dispers'd, For duns and sheriffs' writs had done their worst : At length, a single die, revers'd by fate, To Manson gave his pictures, wine, and plate, And safely lodged him in the spacious Fleet \u2014 The gambler's home, the spendthrift's last retreat. Thus, riches, which mad prodigals disperse, Prove to mankind a torment and a curse ; Work double mischief, ruin those who spend, And foster vice where'er their powers extend ; Scorch like the rays that fell from Phaeton's course, And blast whatever meets their fiery force. But why should all our censure and our blame Be spent to gibbet this poor wretch's name, While hundreds shame the town in faults as bad, With less excuse, because at least less mad ; Who game, drink, whore, exhaust the realms of crime, Yet honour save because they stop in time, Or with such caution their short-comings hide, That prudes and saints with them are satisfied. 'Tis true some deem it politic to spare, From Satire's lash the vices great men bear ; But Vice I hold should be despised when known, Whether it stain a cottage or a throne ; For 'tis the same vile thing wherever seen, And shames not more a peasant than a queen_"], [21, "Thus Hirco's actions all men know to be Actions of most consummate infamy ; Yet since he holds his title and estate, The world submits to rank him with the great; Nay, pushes genius, virtue, worth aside, To honour him and reverence his pride ; In royal levees oft he kneels and shines, With queens he dances, and with princes dines, Though all his life is lavished to prepare A gaol or cottage for his bankrupt heir, Content with that, if he contrive to save His name from being branded rogue or knave; In this world all his care, ' come what, come may,' To keep his credit good in town for play, And as for children, they must take their chance, And beg in Italy, or fight in France ! The Sacred Preacher does insist, we know, That all things are mere vanity below; Yet of all ills which most I hate to see, 'Tis that of grandeur fall'n to beggary ; When those whose rise from monarchs' blood we trace* Dishonour'd fall in ruin and disgrace ; When those whose sires ruled senates by their sway, Sink to mere sots and shame the public way; When those who once held dignity and fame, The highest honour and the proudest name, Are doomed some menial office to fulfil, Such as to guard a desk or guide a quill, And so reduced by want you scarce can trace In them one remnant worthy of their race; Or worse than this, so spurned by all mankind* That exile is the only home they find ;"], [22, "Where starving on some small annuity, Beggars they live, and wretched outcasts die. I love to honour names identified With what I deem my country's honest pride; Whether those names from recent deeds are won, Or have through ten proud generations run ; Symbols of worth and high desert they stand, Respect they merit, reverence they command, And he who homage to such names denies, Must have a spirit much more mean than wise ; For 'tis the distant hope of future praise, That prompts and teaches the quick mind to raise Her noblest works, and counsels her to scorn A rival's hate for fame from ages yet unborn. Men thus descended from the wise and great, Hold rank mere riches never can create ; For what but Time can weave those wreaths of fame, Which gild a Granville's and a Cecil's name, Or purchase that illustrious renown, The twelve proud Howards now have handed down ? But when the scions of a noble line, Degenerate prove and decency resign ; When they with thoughtless, careless hand, Scatter their fathers' riches through the land, And every crime that's vile and base pursue, To scandalise mankind and shock it too; They brand the name they bear with double scorn, And blot the memory they should adorn ; Call forth the stern contempt of honest men, And fall despised no more to rise again. Scarce does a year pass by but that we see The ruin of some antient family,"], [23, "Its lands neglected, barren, and o'errun, With each wild weed that grows beneath the sun ; Its forests vast of venerable oak, Bent down beneath the woodman's daily stroke ; Its trees that lent hereditary shade, In leafless, lifeless, desolation laid ; Its groves where Flora held her sylvan reign, And clothed with verdant beauty all the plain, To barren waste by negligence consigned, And doom'd to fall the sport of every wind ; Its hall where flourished each domestic grace, Left a lone, tenantless, deserted place ; Its ample grounds and glades hired out to keep, A herd of cows or scattered flocks of sheep ; Its walks, its slopes, its alcoves, and its bowers, Untrodden e'en in summer's sweetest hours; Its dial by sheltering boughs o'ergrown, Its sculptured fount a heap of shapeless stone; Its lawns where Spring her earliest fragrance shed, Left for one rose to grace with drooping head, But ah ! more sad its honorable name, Hung like a beacon monument of shame, To show how little birth or rank avail, In minds where folly, vice, and guilt prevail. If men of fortune pleasures must enjoy, Let them in manly sports their wealth employ, And not mere sots and drivellers turn, Whom all but punks and tapsters spurn ; Who know no joys but those of sensual lust ; Who wake no feelings but of vile disgust ; Whose low ambition highest seems to soar, To feast a pugilist or please a whore,"], [24, "And who in tavern chairs aspire to sit, To make mere piddling bawdy pass for wit, Or practise crimes too scandalous to name, Because paid flatterers hold such follies fame. To rash extremes mankind now prove so prone, True moderation is a grace unknown, Or seen so rarely one may half suspect, That principle has perished through neglect ; What though the prodigal's career we blame, Shall not the miser's too be viewed with shame ? Shall not stern justice ask what bids him store Those heaps which Heaven designed to feed the poor ? Those heaps which conscience tells him should be spread, To give the labourer work, the pauper bread, To help the wretched, soothe the sickly eye, And prompt each work of human charity. How oft to this the miser will reply, My wealth the world shall have before I die ; A house for godly alms I'll build next year, If with increase my little rents appear; The year runs round, the little rents improve, As grow the rents, so grows the miser's love; He promises again, the rents decrease, And then the sophist Mammon reigns in peace; \" I cannot spare,\" the wretched niggard cries, Yet hoards and hoards, and rich and wretched dies. What makes the miser wish to swell his store, And gain whate'er he may, ask something more ? You give him plenty, affluence he desires \u2014 You give him thousands, millions he requires ; Boundless his wealth in measure and extent, ' fis ne'er enough to leave him quite content."], [25, "9 Let Fortune grant whate'er the world can give, There's something still for which he hopes to live ; Some precious gem just taken from the mine, Which should among his choicest jewels shine; Some rich estate, some forest, or some field, Which must to him its future tributes yield, And swell those heaps that round his cellars rise \u2014 For what? \u2014 perhaps to be the spendthrift's prize. Whence springs this baneful madness of the mind, Which poisons peace, and strikes pale reason blind ; Which makes all action to one centre move, Of base self-interest, or mean self-love; Which breaks each link that binds the social chain, And turns the love of man to love of gain ; Renders the heart remorseless and unjust, And changes wise desire to sordid lust ; Gives to one master passion all the sway, And makes all other passions that obey ; Divorces man from neighbour, parent, kindred, friend And leaves him, if not dreaded, hated and contemn'd. Consult the hermit sage, and he replies \u2014 Not from one source alone does avarice rise, But various as the whims of human will Are the first thoughts which move this principle : Here it emerges a gross vice at first, There 'tis a virtue into error nurs'd ; Here seen in men the meanest of mankind, And there in heroes who as gods have shined ; Here in a half-clad wretch who sweeps a street, There in a king with empires at his feet, The blot of every age, let History tell How Marlbro' grovelled, and how Bacon fell."], [26, "'Tis surely strange, that more than half mankind To their own imperfections should be blind ; Yet with discriminating eye detect Just where a neighbour's conduct shows defect ; Each man in others sees some fault to blame, Whilst they surveying him do just the same. The fool reviles the wit, the wit the fool, And each the other strives to ridicule ; A miser's pains the prodigal contemn, While he for spendthrift vices censures them. Few to Truth's mirror, turn themselves to see, In the bare nakedness of vanity ; Yet all are quick to hold up Satire's glass, And mark their neighbours' follies as they pass. The miser blames with others, men of pelf, Yet never dreams they deem him one himself, For whatsoever motive bids him hide, Self-love, the dread of want, or lust of pride ; He's sure some specious sophistry to find, To justify his acts before mankind ; To-day he's building prospects for his heir, To-morrow poor relations are his care; This year he must complete a new estate, The next he fears the safety of the state, Or if no revolutions curse the land, He sees some direful famine near at hand, And with large heart prepares to feed the poor, But only does prepare you may be sure ; Making their ills a pretext and excuse, To hide those riches which he dare not use, For all his charity's a mere pretence, He hoards in spite of his benevolence, And leaves the poor at last to Providence."], [27, "What makes old Shiloh linger at the mart, Loth to retire, reluctant to depart? Why does he toil from Ludgate to the 'Change, Fresh bonds to draw, new contracts to arrange ?

He must retrench \u2014 the times are getting bad; He holds the world a prodigal run mad ; He lets his house, and in its cellar lives, Eating no more than what its garden gives ; A servant next he can't afford to hire, The winters now are warm, he needs no fire; His pew at church he shortly must forego, He's getting deaf, and Topham reads so low ;"], [28, "\u00bb He takes a cold, no doctor will he see, For doctors, plague them, always want a fee ; He dies, is buried, and grave lawyers find Some doubts if he were sane enough in mind To make his will ; so they for fees dispute Twelve years, in one long Chancery suit ; Get rules reversed, and judgment oft deferred, Which never is, but always to be heard, And leave the law's stern sentence still unsaid, Though counsel, judges, suitors, half are dead. I grant, where ignorance shrouds a narrow mind Strange follies we must be prepared to find ; Follies so wild and monstrous in their aim, They merit more our pity than our blame, And prove their authors rather fit to be In Bedlam's chambers than society. Who thirsts with fever calls the doctor in To stop its course, or find the lurking sin \u2014 And just as much the erring mind requires Advice to guide or check its mad desires, For when rash passions riot unconfin'd, And banish sense and reason from the mind, They prove to happiness as dire an ill As any pains that need a Chambers' skill. The Roman sage affirmed that all mankind, Could scarcely furnish one sound judging mind ; At least, not one exempt from all defect, Though the weak spot you oft could scarce detect; For Wisdom's self can scarce her judgment trust, To mark just where ambition sinks to lust, Or show th' exact, the nice, the curious line, Which does the bounds of Reason's realm define."], [29, "All know the wretch is mad who clothed in rags, Sits cold and starving, just to count his bags, Yet dares not take one penny from the heap, More than suffices him bare life to keep ; Who sees whole troops of human beings lost, Rather than save them at a shilling's cost; Who hides his gold, then abject kneels and lifts His guilty hands for charitable gifts, And wins rich alms through base hypocrisy \u2014 That such a man is mad we all agree.

Oh, yes ! as knowledge purifies the mind, To dark oblivion, vice shall be consign'd ; Back to her gloomy caverns, guilt shall fly, And cowering shrink from virtue's piercing eye, To haunts obscure rebellion shall withdraw, And gaze at Justice with a secret awe; From fierce revenge the bigot shall refrain, Break the harsh rack and hide his gory chain. To shades of hell fanatic Zeal shall sty, Or left on earth her tortures vainly try, And watch her useless weapons with unwilling eye, Where demon furies rais'd the dreadful yell, And bath'd their murd'rous hands in deeds of hell ; Where on the scaffold stain'd with Virtue's blood, The ruffian triumph'd and the traitor stood, Right shall resume once more her lost command, And loyalty and luve walk hand in hand, Nations their rulers shall with zeal obey, And rulers condescend to gentler sway ; Power, Kings shall exercise with godlike love, And subjects loyal shall that power approve ; Closer the links of order men shall draw, Reason their guide and reason's voice their law ; Justice, her equal balance shall regain, And Charity's good works be seen again;"], [54, "The spoils of conquest warrior chiefs shall spurn, Intent each art of peaceful life to learn. Science, her ample volume shall unrol, Mark the new path, and point the future goal ; While Faith with beacon light shall guard the steep, And guide each wand'rer o'er the pathless deep, Till Truth's bright morn shall beam on all mankind, And chase Cimmerian error from the mind. Oh ! then, in whiter sands glad Time shall run, And see another golden age begun ; The lance shall rust, the myrtle wreath the sword, And man behold Arcadian bliss restor'd. Each aim achiev'd, each adverse danger past, Hope shall possess her promis'd land at last ; O'er the glad earth, love's olive branch shall wave, And the harsh fetter fall from every slave ; Where discord rag'd, fair friendship's warm embrace, Foes shall disarm and mingle every race ; Where brazen horns war's fiery passions stirr'd, Joy's soft melodious cymbal shall be heard, And hills that rock'd beneath the battle's fire, Shall sweetly echo to the silver lyre; The castle gate no warder watch shall keep, The bastion wall no fiery blaze shall sweep ; O'er the green rampart playful fawns shall bound, And lambs exulting, leap from mound to mound; Round the stern bulwark tender vines shall creep, And many a myrtle grace the watch tower's steep. In useful works each martial band shall toil, Crown the grand arch, or rear the stately pile, Shape their neglected arms to new pursuits, Swell the full sheaf and store the vineyard's fruits."], [55, ") On peaceful seas, trade's hardy sons shall hail. With greeting voice each bold expanding sail, In commerce rival fleets shall learn to vie, Till mingling nations mutual wants supply; Till pilgrim hosts to distant worlds may range, Arts to admire, and treasures to exchange. With lightsome step the joyous hours shall run, Swift through each season of the circling sun ; Exhaustless stores the teeming earth shall yield, And bounteous harvests wave o'er every field. Sweet juicy herbs the barren hill shall bear, And flocks and herds scarce need a shepherd's care O'er sandy wastes shall float rich waves of corn, And purpling shrubs each sterile heath adorn. On mountain steeps the luscious vine shall grow, And fertile vales perpetual fruits bestow ; The fragrant groves with balmy gums shall bleed, Unsown sweet flowers shall deck the emerald mead. No more the slave shall search the sandy mine, But rocks and plains with golden heaps shall shine, And hills be crown'd with gems of brighter hue, Than Tarshish held or sacred Ophir knew ; Where the rich river winds new ports shall rise, Vast cities spread, and myriad marts surprise; In pathless woods scarce trodden yet by man, The axe shall sound, the hamlet be began, O'er wilds where beasts in savage grandeur roam, Advent' rous bands shall found a peopled home; With toil's rich products nations shall overflow, And what one wants another shall bestow ; To climes where fruits in rich redundance spring, Whole fleets shall sweep with swift untiring wing ;"], [56, "rise, While dauntless chiefs unaw'd by danger's storm, Through icebound seas new daring tracks shall form. Art after art exploring skill shall find, And pleas'd bequeath those arts to all mankind ; Science, new works of triumph shall prepare, And as those triumphs rise, new triumphs dare. Wide o'er the world fair Peace shall spread her reign, And pour forth plenty's fruits on every plain ; See her proud empire stretch'd from shore to shore, Till crime shall cease, and conquest be no more. Hail ! then, bright Goddess to thy new-born sway, Thy voice all climes shall hear and all obey \u2014 From Borneo's coast to Zembla's snow-crown'd steep, Thy palm shall wave, thy symbol banner sweep ; Far as the breeze can bear, the bark can sail, Thy rule shall prosper, and thy power prevail \u2014 From East to West, all climes thy might shall own, Bend to thy laws, and bow before thy throne; To ev'ry race thy handmaid arts shall reach, Till mingling nations find one common speech ; To heathen shores, the Cross thy sons shall bear, Till to God's temples all mankind repair; To lands unknown thy mission shall extend, Till worlds assembled at thy gates attend . Primeval love thy wisdom shall restore, Primeval bliss fall'n man shall find once more, Till myriad myriad hosts the knee shall bend, And joyful see th' Almighty Dove descend ; Till the blest Lamb in glorious might shall come, And call the just to their eternal home; Till from Creation's grave each white rob'd saint shall And borne on seraph wings ascend to brighter skies."], [57, "DOVER: Printed by Henry Harris, Snargate Street."], [58, ""], [59, ""], [60, ""]]
