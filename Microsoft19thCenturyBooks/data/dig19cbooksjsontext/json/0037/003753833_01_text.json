CHAPTER I. From a mossy slope skirting the winding banks of a translucid river, pursuing its even flow through a Park famed for its wild beauty, pro ceeded a voice, clearly that of a young girl. Irresolution marked its cadence, showing the speaker to be grappling with a grave problem far beyond her depth. Floating through the shallows, she cried, \" What is life ? \" A brief pause ensued, then came a reply from the same source, in a fervent and frenzied ecstasy of style, thus \u2014 \"A spell of radiant glory, overflowing with jubilant, blossoming hopes !

Fearlessly she mounted the slope, and cast upon the recumbent girl a look strangely mingled. Pity, contempt, flavoured with a keen dash of sarcasm, played upon the expressive countenance of one who unmistakably possessed power to plumb depths utterly beyond the grasp of the younger. With out premeditation, she replied, as though a latent spring had been touched, rendering silence im possible \u2014 \" To the rich, with no desire un gratified, no want unsupplied, life must contain roseate hues ; yet these have their spectre lurking nigh, based on selfishness, it cannot be otherwise. True joy that is incapable of cloy is for such as you to obtain, by the endeavour to alleviate the woes of the less fortunate. Trials, alas ! so keen, bitter disappointments, cruel adversity, grinding poverty, taxed toil, with ceaseless weariness, is the lot of hundreds near enough to come under your eye.\" The first speaker raised herself in evident anger, and spoke in tones of disdain thus \u2014"], [11, "3 WON BY HONOUR. \" Who are you, and by whose permission pre sume you to address me ? What matters it to me how life appears to you, for, indeed, you speak as though these several experiences were yours ? You must be aware that these grounds are strictly private ; if you linger I shall make you suffer.\" The scowl on the fair brow intimidated not, neither did the cutting words contain the sting intended. The elder of the two girls flung a smile of contemptuous pity, while she said \u2014 \" You have less power here than you presume. Take warning ; many with equally sure and even brighter prospects than yours have realized that there is oft but one plunge between riches and poverty.\" \" So you would have me believe you once stood on this eminence ? Impossible. Doubtless you have a fine story ready. I will spare you its nar ration. Here is a sovereign, the first, probably, you ever held in your palm. Never again thrust yourself upon your superiors.\" Indignantly the elder hurled the coin back into the lap of her astonished tormentor, adding, in pensive tones, pathetically touching \u2014 \" The old story of might crushing right. Three short years ago, had I been seen to speak with you child, you would have been removed from"], [12, "4 WON BY HOiNOUR. your present obscurity, and placed in prominence. The tide of fortune may yet turn in my favour ; I may pity then, but I shall never be guilty of insulting misfortune.\" Turning, the tall, pale girl ran down the slope, and proceeded rapidly in an easterly course. The spoiled child of fortune rose to her feet. Remembering that Antone, a youth of seventeen, in whose eyes she desired to appear all that was lovely, must have heard the recent conversation, she cried, before she reached the further slope \u2014 '' Antone, why are you thus silent ? Did not my view of life correspond with yours ? It must be so, or I shall negative every proposition you choose to bring.\" The maiden's nether lip curled in scorn, for she perceived with anger the object of her hopes fleeing across the Park after the girl who had wounded her. She gazed eagerly, for Antone had overtaken her. They conversed earnestly, finally shaking hands. While there was an unquestion able certainty, the youth placed something in the hand of the proud maiden, which she did not refuse. Their conversation had been distinctly heard by Antone with feelings of intense disgust. Im pulsive ever, he rose, resolved to lend at least"], [13, "WON BY HONOUR. 5 sympathy where it was sorely needed. The difficulty of his position soon presented itself. What plea could he urge for following a maiden thus that would not convey a questionable aspect ? Antone was courageous, his motive pure. As he came alongside of the pensive wearer of the grey gown he said \u2014 \" Pardon me, you are unhappy ; the victim of oppression \u2014 crippling energy \u2014 which must be to the fore in the stern grapple with life.\" The keen grey eye rose slowly, and was momen tarily scanning acutely the youth who presumed thus to accost a lonely girl. She replied, somewhat austerely \u2014 \" Possibly ! still, I warn you, I am not one who in trial sinks to that strata where honour wanes, losing its value in the fierce contest. Heaven grant I never may ! \" A damask hue suffused now the otherwise colourless cheek. Antone knew how much suffer ing these sentiments had created ; he replied \u2014 \" Pardon me, your expressions were the very counterpart of my reflections, only differently coloured. I trembled at their tone of despair \u2014 a deadly foe to struggling humanity \u2014 it appeared too much in the ascendant for safety. I have only very recently passed to the state beyond,"], [14, "6 WON BY HONOUR. hence, can enter into your trial. Yield not, I implore you, take heart ; day follows closely the night ! \" A deep sigh escaped the girl as she gave another searching, critical survey of her interlocutor, and replied, mournfully \u2014 \" Alas ! we women are seldom favoured with those tidal winds that drift man towards success ; our fate is more frequently the engulphing of the whirlpool.\" \" Victory, in your case, is the more ennobling,\" replied Antone. The youth remembered he had with him two fifty-pound notes. These, without demur, he folded and placed under his card. His stead fast eye gleamed unmistakably with honour and truth, as he said \u2014 \" I shall not presume to offer anything save a loan. While honour is your banner, success your goal, truth your standard, forget not to add to that, faith in the Supreme Disposer of human weal or woe. You are sure to conquer, though steep and rugged will be the ascent.\" \" The vigour of your assurance reanimates hope. The battle is hot, and the strife fierce.\" \" True ! stay not to answer the oft repeated question, ' What is life ?

Should you need a friend or protector, command me ; I can wisely serve you in the common bond of universal brotherhood.\" \" How rare such kindness ! Were the strong to aid in bearing the burdens of the weak, how would the lot of many be rendered endurable ! Thank you, I will return a loan that may be the axle on which my fortune may turn towards success. Surely you will not suffer through an impulse as rare as it is noble. Tell me how long I may have before I return it in part or full ? \" The keen grey eye was now suffused with a light that made its possessor at the least attrac tive, as she waited with evident eagerness to receive her new friend's reply. \" Not until you are above the need of pecuniary aid. Do not be restlessly anxious to win the favour of the fickle goddess, be not unduly cast down if she delays yet awhile her smile ; it will come, though you be sorely tried first. I must go ; pardon the obtrusion. May heaven bless and prosper you. Au revoir.\" Antone walked thoughtfully back towards the Court, his own past very sharp experiences, the cruel scorn which had fallen to his share, together"], [16, "8 WON BY HONOUR. with the actual dearth of love or appreciation, which had followed him until very recently, pre occupied, not however, to the exclusion of the evident turn of the tidal- wave in his favour, by securing to him his present position at the Court. How this was effected subsequent pages reveal. The young man's father, Earl Gortzey, to him was but an acidulated recollection; even more, for his positive aversion, nay, hatred, for the child whose birth deprived him of the life for whom alone he entertained a single particle of love. For his two elder children he exhibited a degree of interest, possibly aroused by their close resem blance to himself. After Lady Hyacinth's death, the family were left, for the most part, to their own wild, un tutored nature. The education they received was from tutors, who were subject to the control of the Earl's sister, Lady Isabel, who divested the Abbey of any home-like qualities which her sister-in-law had striven in vain to bring into active play. In truth, this family eschewed all the hallowed attributes constituting such a sanctuary. These were the associations of Antone's infancy. Happily for the boy, his mother's youngest sister was not wholly dead to the welfare of the child who carried the stigma with him of his mother's"], [17, "9 AVON BY HONOUR. death. This version was no doubt propagated to efface the effect of a rumour that her ladyship's death was not a natural one. Lady Folicate, by letter, proposed to educate the boy, on the condition that his vacations might be left to her disposition. She frankly told the Earl she had only gained her husband's consent to this arrangement by pledging herself not to bring any member of that family through the portals of their home. At the early age of six, this unnatural parent gave a too willing consent to Antone's removal to a public school of his unknown relative's selec tion. Antone's faithful nurse, to whom he un doubtedly owed his life, was immediately dis missed by order of Lord Erskept. The vigilant eye this woman had ever kept upon him had cir cumvented many of his foul schemes. Hence he hated her. Merrit dearly loved the motherless, friendless boy. She urged him to be quick to learn, early kindling in his infantine bosom a thirst for military life. All the toys she purchased for her charge related to the life of a soldier ; she, accord ing to her circumscribed knowledge, arranged them for battle. Not unfrequently would she"], [18, "10 WON BY HONOUR. lead the child to suppose he would one day become a general, or, if not, it would be for lack of courage and perseverance. This remark was just the one to cleave to Antone, for his nurse was his early oracle. Thus was Antone ushered into his experiences of the hard, dull side of life. At six, one of six hundred, being small and shy, yet withal a most attractive boy, he became a general pet. This did not last long, for by some strange way a rumour was circulated through the school, reach ing the ears of the Masters and Principal, that caused the boys to shun Antone. Undoubtedly this was done with the intention to blight this young life. Dr. Heneshal endeavoured to trace the source. Not being successful, he determined to write to Lady Folicate, whose messenger had brought the juvenile thither, that lady indig nantly refuting the slander as reflecting dishonour upon herself. She did not let it rest there. Her sympathy for the unprotected boy was aroused. She procured an attested certificate of birth, and urged the doctor to suffer it to be seen by every boy, which he was nothing loath to do. Antone's capabilities were of the soaring order. When he found himself shunned he looked upon the circumstance as perfectly natural to his lot,"], [19, "WON BY HONOUR. 11 concentrated all his time and efforts upon his studies, hence was continually the recipient of promotion. The ambition of his babyhood now grew into a settled standard, to which all his efforts tended. Dr. Heneshal took a deep and tender interest in the boy. Finding him more than once buried in books of a martial order, he asked Antone if already he had a fixed career before him. He was more than surprised at the decisive and clear way the reply was given. Some years after this, Antone Derritt was re moved to a military college, with the distinct understanding that with education completed all hope of further help must not be expected. When Dr. Burslem delivered this significant message to his new pupil he was surprised by the composure the boy evinced. He merely replied \u2014 \" I never expected other than my future career must be of my own individual carving. All the more merit if I reach my standard unaided.\" From that hour the doctor was the boy's father and friend. The certificate had been forwarded by the former principal with a brief explanation. Dr. Burslem asked a few questions of Antone relative to his father, and the lady to whom he owed his education, but the boy's real ignorance"], [20, "12 WON BY HONOUR. was too apparent to admit of assumption of it being feigned. With flying colours Antone passed his exams., winning all the honours within his grasp, thus bringing himself before the notice of some of the cleverest men in the army. Still, the youth re mained true to his chart, never basing his hopes on fancied patronage. During the term the hours of leisure were invariably spent in coaching slow and stupid students, for which Antone's patient, lucid style was singularly fitted. The money thus earned placed the youth in a position of independence, grateful to one of his temperament. His collegiate career was now within one term of completion. In Dr. Burslem he had found not only a firm friend, but a father. The brilliant little coterie which frequently met in the old man's dining-room looked forward with dismay to the re moval of the doctor's clever scholar. While other thoughts busied themselves in the young man's brain, his standard still floated on its rocky eminence. Yet no single solid vestige of hope of his reaching it appeared. Despair he never would. The evening prior to the conclusion of the term, at one of these brilliant little receptions,"], [21, "WON BY HONOUR. 13 Antone listened to a description of a beautiful part of the country never previously heard of. His resolution was fixed to turn his steps thither in the coming recess, while he retained a singular consciousness that this resolve contained a germ of significant importance. Secretly, yet uuwittingly, into this plan for the vacation was infused that magnetic fluid connect ing mysteriously broken associations, re-opening closed links, flowing on amid hidden, latent cur rents, by the accomplishment of the unobserved electric machinery, which works the purpose marvellously designed by the Supreme Architect and by an unsuspecting instrument. How a careless utterance, falling from the heedless lips of a mere stranger, frequently is the only primary cause of the change of current in the life of the recipient. Two days afterwards, on the box-seat of a lumbering stage-coach, young Antone Derritt commenced his eventful career. About mid-day of the third, since his start, the old, rattling four in-hand drew rein before a pretentious-looking stone house, with a huge sign, styled \"The Covertmoor Arms.\" Antone was the only passenger alighting; the coach with its heavily laden cargo was bound for a town fourteen miles"], [22, "14 WON BY HONOUR. ahead. The burly Host leaned apathetically upon a, sturdy carved oak screen, gave Antone a true country survey, while the latter accosted the former thus \u2014 \" What accommodation does the inn afford ? \" The landlord somewhat indignantly replied \u2014 \" Ample for the likes of you, sir, I reckon, while the Earl, whose arms you can see upon our sign, questioned not their quality.\" \" Then they will be more than ample for the humble requirements of a struggling student.\" Mine host, somewhat soothed, surveyed Antone with more geniality, even tried a patronizing air ; this was lost upon the absorbed youth, who asked \u2014 \" Is it possible to procure good angling in this district ? \" Again the same broad stare the landlord sub jected his guest to. Before venturing a reply he took from off his head a soft hat, wiped energe tically his polished skull, then gave expression to a sound between a grunt and a groan. Out of this came the reply \u2014 \"May be, sir, J could get his lordship's steward to give me a ticket that would admit a friend of mine to the great Park ; there be no other road to work on it, as I knows on. These Earls respect"], [23, "15 WON BY HONOUR. the Jacebys. We have lived here as long as the Earls themsens. There be no trout like that grown by my Lord of Covertmoor.\" The landlady now chimed in respecting Sir Michal Dunloop's rivulets, but the bumptious host was not to be supplanted. He replied, curtly \u2014 \" Sir Michal's is well enough, missis ; but them as knows ought of the craft would give double for a chance of the Earl's. I knows better nor her.\" \" I no question on that John lad ; ye be mighty touchy. Ye be the best judge this side the country, and ony other, for ought I knows.\" \" How long do ye reckon to want it, sir, if I be not bold ? \" \" Leave that an open question ; two or three months if I am comfortable and do not weary of a pastoral life. Is there not a remairkable legend attached to some mound in one of the parks near here ? \" \" Yes sir ; that is in Covertmoor. The story is a long one. By your leave I will bottle that agen a rainy day. The mossy dells in the Park are nowhere surpassed.\" \" Serve me a luncheon now ; I dine at eight.\" This announcement was the signal for a double stare, while the landlady, recovering herself, said \u2014"], [24, "16 WON BY HONOUR. \"Coud ye no ma' it seven? I shall n'er get Betty up e the mornin', sir.\" \" Yes, I will try. If I am late sometimes you will not worry me ; it is my term of ease.\" In an hour Antone sauntered out, sketch-book in hand. Propelled by something he could not solve, wandered in the direction he had heard Covertmoor laid. Antone Derritt's goal could not be wealth, for into his thirst never entered the desire to acquire it. To make himself a name in the annals of the brave was his ambition. His boyish dreams were of fierce battles, with himself in the foreground of danger. The same hope burned in youth ; yet around it still lingered the improbable halo. How were the preliminary grounds to be reached ? Still, he was undaunted by the presence of the spectre. The love of Dr. Burslem had done wonders for Antone. His attachments were strong, for one kindness received he showered a return. Full of his indefinite future, yet still more hope ful, he wandered heedlessly along, his faith rising on the nearness to the time when the die must be cast \u2014 before him ever came the wonder how a commission could fall to his improbable lot. Here he halted. Though he was unaware of it, his steps"], [25, "17 WON BY HONOUR. traversed the right road. Hidden in the complex elements of life work unanticipated results wholly unlooked for \u2014 it was thus with this youth. All at once he paused before a door in an oak fence, standing ajar. Through the aperture was revealed a view of what Antone thought, a vision of Paradisaical loveliness. A vast stretch of hill and dale, upon both fine timber spread its graceful foliage. In the midst, with picturesque winding mysterious loveliness, flowed a broad stream of a deep blue colour. It rippled over a bed of rugged stone, changing its sound at every bend of the limpid waters, as they ran their irregular circuit. In the valley browsed herds of deer, congregated naturally according to kine. Irresistibly attracted, Antone entered, oblivious he was guilty of trespass. Before him was an intricate maze of finely-grown acacias. To thread the inviting pathway was an impulse not to be restrained, so enjoyable was it, not even marred by fear, because there was no conscious guilt. The mossy turf resembled a carpet of velvet, while the rays distinctively belonging to an autumnal sun shed on the turf a mellowed tint grateful to the eyes of a student of nature. A soft delusive fancy took possession of the youth, c"], [26, "18 WON BY HONOUR. and led him on, heedless of results, into the heart of this fair domain. The sun was unusually hot, and insensibly drove Antone further west to the grateful shelter of a stately Beech Grove. Through it flowed the river, while further away distinctly was heard the con tinuous roar of a cascade. To turn in the direc tion from which the sound came was but natural. The route circuitous. A sudden bend brought him upon a lovely landscape, surrounding a mansion of stately magnificence, the windows of which were as liquid gold, flooded by sunlight; the gardens right and left, of an oriental type, teeming with floral diversity. From the house the cascade formed an object of attractive beauty. It appeared to rush out in hot haste from a thick clump of trees on the top of a high mound, the foliage forming an effective background. Right and left were two other eleva tions, likewise capped ; these formed a triangle. At the base a huge basin received the foaming torrent, which flowed back into the river. The construction was the work of an eminent engineer. The two side mounds were spanned by a light and elegant bridge. At either end was a grotto formed from the foliage. Antone's quick eye perceived steps in the sward,"], [27, "WON BY HONOUR. 19 by which the top could be easily reached, with out looking round, he selected a spot dangerously near to the waterfall. The noise of the angry roll of the limpid waters was soothing ; ever and anon the youth's face was moistened by the spray. Buried in thought, the heedless wanderer soon fell into a sound slumber, all unconscious that in the bower behind, sat the owner of this lovely estate in sombre reflections, though of a widely different character to those of the careless sleeper. The Earl was not annoyed by the cool invasion, neither was he startled at the occasion of so unlooked-for an incident, but surprised at the preoccupation of the youth. His face contained a singular attraction, for wherever the Earl's eyes wandered they were magnetically drawn back to the stranger's face. At length Antone raised himself, and with an animated gush, said, still asleep \u2014 \"Other men have been equally alone, thus hemmed in by obstacles, yet they have succeeded in reaching the heights, whereon they have planted their standard. Why not I?\" Something in the voice startled the Earl. For the first time he realized the extreme peril of the sleeper ; the merest slight swerve would put his life in great jeopardy. Approaching softly, with"], [28, "20 WON BY HONOUR. extreme caution and wondrous tenderness, he drew the student into a place of comparative security. While doing so, the Earl became satisfied that the spell holding him was the remarkable likeness between this youth and his beloved son. He smiled at his own credulity the next moment, aud accounted for a fact he could not controvert, as merely an incident of wayward nature. Antone now moved uneasily, as though disturbed, but not aroused. Lord Covertmoor ruminated thus : \" He, too, is alone, and struggling to reach some coveted goal without aid, and possibly with little or no means. How different his lot to my son Cuthbert, who knew no single lack.\" This thought brought an involuntary deep drawn sigh. The sleeper opened his eyes ; the Earl still stood over him ; the orbs that looked into his face were of the soft, deep violet hue, a distinguishing feature of his family. The youth blushed as he perceived his position was one of disadvantage ; he had strayed, unbidden, into the secret retreat of the Earl of Covertmoor."], [29, "CHAPTER II. In an instant, Antone rose to the necessity of such a predicament, and stood before the tall, aristocratic man, still very handsome, though far past his prime. His classical mouth was playing curiously with mirth, a feeling rarely exhibited. The youth, with outspoken candor, observed \u2014 \" I am trespassing. How I came to be too preoccupied to note that I was committing so grave au error, following the beautiful, heedless of the rectitude of the action, I can only there fore commend myself to your clemency, without plea.\" \" The offence to me has proved an agreeable diversion \u2014 nay, a boon, since you have already evoked latent sympathies I believed dead. Your heedlessness threatened rather more serious con sequences to yourself. I must strongly urge you"], [30, "22 WON BY HONOUR. not to yield to these dangerous fits of abstraction. A single move in your sleep might, nay would, have ended a short life.\" \" In my case,\" replied Antone, \" an untimely end would bring grief to no single heart. Mine would be obsequies without a single mourner.\" \" Have you then no relatives ? No father ? No mother?\" \" Pardon me, it is atrocious to parade one's private matters in the ears of a polite stranger. The humorous aspect forced itself upon me. I am too spontaneous ; out it will come.\" \" Are you then alone, and without natural ties ? \" \" No, by some untoward arrangement of wilful nature, affection and I have so far managed to collide. My mother died at my birth ; all other ties are a blank in my history.\" \" You interest me deeply, because you are singularly like my only son. Since his death life has been a dreary lot to me. My idol was re moved, and I to all intent and purpose am indeed alone. Now, be easy, we are equal ; confidence once reciprocal, dissolves obligation with a cer tainty.\" \" Quite alone ? \" muttered Antone. \" Neither sister nor brother, nephew nor niece ? Is it so ? \""], [31, "WON BY HONOUR. 23 \" Of the latter there is no dearth. Some are eager enough to lack the commonest decency. They suffer me to see how they long to slip into my expected shoes. Not one of the number would offer me the only consolation I would accept, springing from genuine affection, or even the same friendship.\" \" Better far be as I am, without expectancy, than to be courted and fawned upon under false colours. Thank heaven, my lot is less oppressive, for labour sweetens desolation sufficient to render it tolerable.\" These sentiments were uttered aside, more as reflections. Antone's sympathies once aroused, he became abstracted by the grief of others. The youth looked timidly into the face of the Earl \u2014 it was sad indeed \u2014 and hesitatingly said \u2014 \" If the love of a lonely heart of one so obscure be worthy your acceptance, mine is unoccupied. My fidelity shall prove its basis to be truth and unsullied honour. The world may and will sneer, but it remains with us to keep this affection pure from the shadow of a sordid imputation. Love and confidence to me is a priceless inheritance ; it is that, and that only I crave.\" The Earl gazed in mute astonishment and wonder, while the secret spell drew its meshes"], [32, "24 WON BY HONOUR. closer and yet closer around him. At length he replied \u2014 \"Your offer bears the odour of sanctity. I accept it readily, with the knowledge that it is an uneven compact. Years sever us. While I am old, soured, and disappointed, you are entering into life \u2014 vigorous, fresh, and brimful of youth and hope.\" \" Your ripe experience,\" said Antone, \"far more than makes the balance equitable ; in fact, I must ever remain the debtor. Suffer me to win your love by merit.\" \" As you will,\" replied Lord Covertmoor. \"You must consider the Court is free to you whenever you choose to come \u2014 that is, if there is sufficient brightness remaining to capture youth.\" \" How late ! Time flies on rapid wing when the heart is at ease. I will go now, with one more assurance\u2014 that I have not forced myself upon you discordantly.\" \" Far otherwise, dear boy. Though I am well nigh a recluse, there is something tells me you will be as a balsam to a wound which can never wholly heal. You are very like my beloved Cuth bert, his figure and gestures, with the only differ ence of stature \u2014 he was even taller than I.\" \" While I am contemptibly small for a"], [33, "25 WON BY HONOUR. man, and the only member of my family thus afflicted.\" \" What difference can a foot or two of stature make, I wonder? \" \" A good deal.

We shall then become more conversant with the ills of our several lot. I may give a sober colouring to ambition \u2014 that from my obscured standpoint appears to require the experience of years to temper it.\" \" It is more than kind. I doubt if I must accept your offer to ride. When a youth I had a mad thirst for the exercise, without the means to gratify it. Hitherto fortune has not dowered me thus.

She is docility per sonified, and yet carries a goodly stock of spirit. It is not always politic to permit others to see too far into the unreadable vicissitudes of our career. May I ask, where are you visiting ? \" \" I am located at the chief inn of the village for the vacation. Only one more term for study, then comes the tug-of-war \u2014 the fierce, hard battle of life.\" Their attention was arrested by the voice of a young girl calling loudly, thus \u2014 \"God-pa, where are you?

I hold no such relation ship to the wilful, spoiled maiden, who dogs my steps, possibly with the benevolent intention of cheering a lonely life.

The disparity and con trast is far too defined to produce comfort.\" \" Connie,\" asked the Earl, \" why do you not accompany your father as formerly ? There can be nothing congenial in my melancholy to one of your calibre.\" \" Your solitude must be so dreary ; the thought"], [35, "27 WON BY HONOUR. makes me the same. I see you have a visitor, so I am out of season.\" Antone raised his hat, but the Earl made no attempt to introduce him, so he asked, senten tious! y \u2014 \" At what hour do you wish me to be ready ? \" \" Are you obliged to leave me thus hurriedly ? \" asked Lord Covertmoor. \"I do not know your habits ; I am an early riser.\" \" Still amongst those who wish to thrive, I rise with the lark.\" Raising his hat, he was about to depart, when the Earl said \u2014 \"I will send Snowdrop round to you by nine.\" Antone now turned his course to the door in the fence. He soon was aware Lord Covertmoor called to him, pointing in the direction of the Court. He turned into the line intimated, insen sibly slackening his speed as wild speculations crowded in upon him. Antone was searching memory, for he, too, was certain some old association was recalled by the Earl; improbable enough, his search was fruitless. Even now his new friend was handsome. Antone was endowed with remarkable perception; in a very few moments he could discover the extent of a man's knowledge, the nature and power of his"], [36, "28 WON BY HONOUR. intellectual qualities, together with an adequate \u25a0conception of his candor, with the hue of his honesty. He had walked slower than he supposed, for immediately behind him a merry laugh grated upon his oral faculties. Certain was he this girl's company could never be pleasing to one of the Earl's finely-poised balance. He now reached Antone's side, and said \u2014 \" I saved you a long and fruitless walk ; there is a door that way which no one can open. It is about the only scrap of exclusiveness I cling to.\" \" I regret then my trespass is twofold, for I found a door ajar in the oaken fence.\" \"Impossible!\" replied the Earls \"There is some mistake. 1 do not know of anyone having a key.\" \"It was open, my Lord. I sincerely regret my fault.\" \"You are not the delinquent. He must be dis covered, as I do not choose the park should be entered save by the several lodge gates. Stay, I will order Snowdrop. I see even now you can have an hour's quiet trot before dinner.\" To the lonely youth so much consideration was new and refreshing ; nay, it rendered him silent from inability to express the fulness of his joy."], [37, "29 WON BY HONOUR. They reached a place where a number of paths met. Here the Earl paused and held out his hand to the young girl, whose eyes he saw rivetted upon Antone in a particularly distasteful manner to Lord Covertmoor. She, evidently annoyed at the dismissal, said \u2014 \" I a'm not thus to be summarily flung aside as a toy, my Lord, for a new one.\" \"Foolish girl,\" replied the Earl, with incisive tones of disgust ; \" this is your nearer way, Connie. I am going- to the stables.\" \" It matters not, god-pa. Only remember I have no intention of allowing an adventurer who may cross your path and win your favour by flattery supplanting me.\" Pouting her lip in scorn she retreated back wards, her eye fastened on the two with a look highly annoying to Lord Covertmoor, who said, in partial exculpation \u2014 \" Poor child ! She is more to be pitied than condemned; all the proclivities of birth are strongly defined. She is never denied ; the moment I saw you I recognized the indelible stamp of refine ment by suffering. These are my stables ; far more extensive than my frugal requirements since dear Cuthbert's death.\" The Earl led the way, passing by numbers of"], [38, "30 WON BY HONOUR. beautiful horses until he came to the stall of a magnificent creature, who neighed at the sound of his footfall. He lavished upon it numberless caresses, adding in mournful tones \u2014 \" It was not by the false step of Firefly that I was deprived of the most dutiful of sons ; he it was who made life a priceless boon to be used with caution. I for ever reproach myself for expressing my desire for Neptune to be ridden the last fortnight of the hunting season. On this terrible day, when brought to the terrace for my beloved boy to mount, I observed the animal turn with a spiteful look towards his rider. So unlike Neptune, who in his liveliest mood was amenable to reason and the slightest pressure of the bit. Here is a mystery. I can never blame the horse, for I never yet knew him to make a wrong step, and I cannot think he was the cause of my loss. In the first burst of anguish I gave the order for him to be shot. Prior to the execution of my will I repaired to the stables. His innocent look saved him, and I am grateful on the grounds of subsequent impressions.\" Antone's sympathy was of the most potent quality, silently rendered, while his eyes revealed a wealth of unexpressed participation. The youth had found, he now believed, that for which"], [39, "WON BY HONOUR. 31 he had pined, while Lord Covertmoor experienced a sense of deep comfort. At this juncture Snowdrop, saddled, appeared. Antone had not heard the order given for her ; behind was a mounted footman in black livery. The Earl examined the saddle girths, then said, in an audible tone \u2014 \" You will not prolong your ride now, until Gilber's return, I shall be undoubtedly anxious. I am foolish, for already I perceive you at home in the saddle. When sorrow unnerves, every trifle is magnified. My blow fell at the centre of vitality. You are one upon whom grief falls with cruel force; men of one current usually make boisterous demonstrations ; their lamentation scarcely endures the wax and wane of a single moon. Your sorrow colours the whole future with a cloud no subsequent pleasure could possibly erase. I do reverence this calibre in the masculine mind, it is passing rare. Under it the diver for pearls need apprehend no disappointment ; success is sure.\" Antone, raising his hat, said \u2014 \" A broken promise at dawn would augur -evil.\""], [40, "CHAPTER III. Time to the Earl now sped with startling velocity ; this new state of things was undefinably agree- able. Amid the pleasure which moved upon the almost stagnant surface of the water of Lord Covertmoor's life, he never for one single moment relaxed his vigilant watch over Antone's conduct, continually subjecting his motives to a severe scrutiny, both trying to the temper and irritating to the nerves of youth. Not so in this case. Antone suffered as though it was a part of his daily portion. Hitherto the Earl had never before met with a character in any rank of life, who approached his standard of freedom from the bane permeating every strata of the human race in varied degrees and infinite shapes, namely, the thirst for wealth, together with the unscrupulous means used to the attainment of that purpose. Never could this astute nobleman, with all his eagerness, evoke the merest spark of greed in his"], [41, "33 WON BY HONOUR. guest, while the remotest approach to the acquirement of fame would call forth slumbering ambition into a vitality, startling, and almost alarming, to the philosophical quietude of the matured man. Three weeks had sped away ere Lord Covert moor unearthed the all-consuming care of his present era, namely, the unfitness of the legal heir of this fair domain for possession, positively steeped in crime and debt. Antone listened with his usual quiet sympathy, yet without presuming to offer his opinion. He led his companion from the subject, evidently painful, into a clever disquisition upon the relative merits and demerits of the laws of primo geniture, accompanied by, or rather supplemented with, a remark on the extreme grave aspect evolved from the responsibility of wealth. Lord Covertmoor's previous knowledge of Antone's hopes and aspirations, based on shifting sands, made him wonder still more at the absence of all attempts to ingratiate himself for the attainment of his purpose, still confidently adhering to the hope of reaching the heights whereon his banner fluttered in the breeze. Still, he never worried at the existence of this gloomy doubt. Strange as it may seem, and to some even D"], [42, "34 WON BY HONOUR. doubtful, this happy intimacy had been enjoyed over three weeks before the Earl remembered how signally oblivious and careless he had been for a man of his years and standing, to receive a youth into an intimacy of a character almost unprecedented, without so much as the asking his name. Antone had freely volunteered his first name, while the Earl, in speaking of him, styled him the guest. Lord Covertmoor could only frame one satis factory plea, this savoured of discomfort for his singular neglect, namely, the irresistible charm of the youth's society existing, he firmly believed, in this new phase of human nature he could not recall in past experience. To be adrift on the world without a single six pence, except that obtained by hard work, brain toil, or in the future that of battle, with an easy confidence in the success which would attend these efforts was to the Earl mysterious. He placed himself in the same position, and realized that he should have been minus the courage and trust evinced by the lonely young man. This brought to the Earl's mind the wonder who his guest was, and his own neglect on that score. Some incident of an interesting order cropped up, and prevented the simple question being then put to the young"], [43, "35 WON BY HONOUR. man. The Earl had, as it were, been able to read his very thoughts, so transparent were his actions and motives, that he felt sure there was nothing to fear. How long this state of affairs might have lasted it is impossible to say, had not the Earl's fears been aroused by Ruthven, his confidential attendant, who assured his master the vigilance of the enemy had been twofold since the advent of the guest. That caution, was not only need ful, but imperative. Not that Chantry, Earl of Covertmoor, was a timid man \u2014 far otherwise. He would never be driven by fear or threats to a cowardly shrinking from a fulfilment of any plan he deemed right; he would stand to his colours heedless of results. This disturbing element inoculating the new and delightful spell was annoying. Then too, it was revolting to one of the Earl's balance, of a brave and fearless kind, to be subject to dark threats of what eventualities loomed in the near future. In his attitude, no single vestige of fear manifested itself, while his old and tried dependent trembled \u2014 alas ! but too certain \u2014 that a terrible significance was concealed in this close survey of the Court and its owner. With these thoughts to the fore, the Earl did not ask this simple question for two days longer."], [44, "36 WON BY HONOUR. Meanwhile Connie Dunloop vexed Lord Covert moor by her indelicate and open admiration of his guest, the various excuses she continually made to come upon them suddenly in their rides and drives. To Antone, her conduct had the effect of making him tenfold more reticent \u2014 his refined nature shrank from passing judgment upon the actions of a mere girl. While the Earl observed what was going on with no small amount of curious interest, nothing could have hap pened more opportunely than the bold conduct of Connie ; it brought to the fore the virtues of Antone, as well as showing up the magnanimity of his disposition, for with true innate delicacy, he endeavoured to throw over the most glaring, a flimsy covering to relieve their painful glamour. The visits of Sir Michal the Earl noted, with the marked tones he addressed the guest in, obsequious, as though in the rear some favour would be solicited. What that was Antone never divulged, though the angry departure of Sir Michal was seen and heard by the Earl, convey ing grave significance to one with prior experience of this man's designing bent. He had tried to entrap the late heir, whose affections were secretly engaged upon one whose conduct savoured of the delicate modesty of the violet. Having her"], [45, "37 WON BY HONOUR. parents' sanction, after eighteen months had fled he might try to win their child. They frequently met ; the appearance of Cuthbert unexpectedly, surprised the lovely maiden, still very young, into a soft bloom, aroused by a rush of warm blood from the centre of vitality which made the heir of Covertmoor certain his suit would be a successful one. The sudden and sad death of the young noble man was quickly followed by the tragic one of Lady Violet Spring, who died from the effects of a violent attack of brain fever, caused by grief. Lord and Lady Dewswater never returned to Culrose Abbey after the death of their charming daughter. On the afternoon of the very day on which Antone's friendship with the Earl was a month old, they drew rein after an enjoyable two miles' gallop, for though considerably over seventy this nobleman had a fine carriage of his aristo cratic person upon the saddle, very little different from his early prime. The Earl said, with a pleasant smile, encircling his classical mouth \u2014 \" 'Tone, my boy, is nineteen weary of the com pact with seventy-five, after a month's severe test?\" \" Surely,\" cried Antone, in pained voice, and a"], [46, "38 WON BY HONOUR. wounded expression in his deep-toned orbs, \" my actions have been a sufficient interpretation of the delight I hourly enjoy in your society. How could it be otherwise when no sordid motive drew us within the charm of this union ? Your instrument played an inspiriting disquisition ; my muse awoke to the beauty of its composition and replied.\" \" I am glad,\" added Lord Covertmoor, \" that so far we have found a rather unusual theory practical and worthy of elucidation. You have taught me a few lessons by your noble acceptance of the dull, hard, prose passages of life, your happy way of placing them side by side with the flowers that are occasionally strewn by our path . The bold courage, characterizing your movements in gloom, has been a seasonable rebuke to me. I look out for the bright stars, now, endeavouring to forget the dark clouds ever chasing me.\" \" Impossible ! I should teach you, dear friend, that is a mistake, while I am yet a novice. I must make a future for myself. It was \u2014 it could only be the force of the inevitable pressing me forward you mistake for bold courage. I have not yet begun the tug of war.\" \" Yes, but how many would have grown morbid, impugned Providence, as well as those from"], [47, "39 WON BY HONOUR. whom they derived natural existence, laid idly on their oars, in the delusive hope good fortune would in some unlooked-for way fall to their lot, then when it came not, drift to ruin in the vampire's craft? \" \"That would be execrable cowardice, besides the absence of all the fine qualities that constitute manhood noble.\" \" True, 'Tone, but alas ! grief acts variously ; the faint-hearted it crushes and enervates, while the courageous who are endowed with the secret of moral fortitude come through the crucible amply repaid, much wiser and better for the trial. I am seriously indebted to you, my young friend. How can I suitably recompense you? \" Antone after a weighty pause, said \u2014 \" I was on the eve of refuting the obligation ; second thought makes me place in the opposite scale to that containing the fancied one, a favour you shall be free to grant, or reject, as you will.\" \" What is it ? There is not much fear of re fusal. I must, however, tax your patience by a delay, for I have just awoke to the fact that I have been guilty of a grave indiscretion, allowed a month's intercourse to flee away ere I asked for your name, a neglect which might have caused serious complications. It is happily not so.\""], [48, "40 WON BY HONOUR. A deep colour mantled the pale brow of the youth, while the Earl showed signs of discomfort. It was a mere fancy that held Antone's candor captive. Without the merest shadowy idea that the man who had taken so firm a hold of his affections was a relative, he had a deep conviction that the knowledge of his name would place a barrier between the Earl and himself. How, he could not say. The youth struggled to find some satisfactory solution of his difficulty. He replied thus \u2014 \" Strange, your question and my favor were one and the same. Pardon me if I place my favor before you and leave you to decide. Will you suffer me to remain as I am \u2014 merely Antone ? My reasons are vague, shape themselves into pre sentiments, yet too powerful to be disregarded. Here, I am certain, my candor must endure a serious discount. Still, it is not sullied.\" \" Antone,\" replied Lord Covertmoor, gravely, \" why should a man be ashamed of his name if he has not disfigured it by ignoble deeds ?

Were I to let my name transpire I feel certain our joj must suffer; the reason for this is as much hidden from me as you, only the conviction is too strong to heedlessly toss over. If you are willing to trust me in the face of a mystery it will one day be unearthed to my credit. Surely you will not cut me off. I loved you for your own sake, not for the numberless accessories which many value above their modicum.\" \" Your punishment is sure ; you must still locate at the Covertmoor Arms. I must ask you to preserve silence there as to all transpiring here. Unfortunately I have an enemy, and already, I am told, your presence here is creating a panic of alarm.\" \" My presence bring trouble ? \" asked Antone. \" I am too insignificant to arouse fear in anyone ; it must be a fancy. Who is your enemy \u2014 surely not he who desires to succeed ? \" \" The same. To anyone upon whom I smile be looks with a diabolical frown.\""], [50, "42 WON BY HONOUR. \" Poor wretch !

Believe me, I rejoice in the prospect that any substance that will ever be mine must be meritoriously won by labour and victory. Have you no estates save those under entail? Why not fearlessly assert you are not bound by the law of heritage, and could select someone worthy of such ? \" \" Yes, the estates of my beloved wife are equally as large and fair as mine. These will never be under the spell of the vile Erskept.\" As Lord Covertmoor divulged he keenly watched Antone; his thoughts had fled to the painting before which he found the Earl every morning, side by side with that of his son, with his arm resting upon the arched neck of a hunter. Oblivi ous of all, save his thoughts, the youth said \u2014 \" Happy lot yours, my friend, to have possessed the love of a true woman, so lovely in every respect as Lady Vivian. That in itself were a joy sufficient to crown a man's life with honied retro spection, even if he had been deprived of all else.\" \" You have a strange knack, my boy, of dis covering the neglected flowers in my pathway. Have you none of these on your own P \""], [51, "43 WON BY HONOUR, \" The only one I have ever known is too cherished to admit of forgetfulness because a new found joy.\" Lord Covertmoor kept his resolution, while Antone's name remained a secret. Still, his friend's esteem grew. The night, the last one before his return to college, Antone gave the Earl a letter to read he had received from the head of his College. In it there was a vein of such true parental expression, with substantial desires, to aid the youth's ambitious dream. The sentence that riveted the Earl's attention was the follow ing:\u2014 \"I can understand aud appreciate your noble reluctance to owe anything to ties so singularly denuded of proper vitality. This I have never learned from an expression falling from your lips, my dear son, but from one who knows the history of your family far better than you do. Since you never gave me your confidence, I now honour the source of your silence, since it must have been at the expense of others, my knowledge. I wait and admire.\" \" Forgive me, dear Antone,\" said the Earl, handing back the letter. \" I stand corrected by an unintentional, yet delicate, rebuke, and participate in the feeling such conduct evoked.\""], [52, "44 WON BY HONOUR. The Earl pulled from his fourth finger a magnificent signet ring, placed it on Antone's, and, with husky voice, said : \" I could not show more forcibly my regard. This heirloom was my gift to Cuthbert. Until this moment I had resolved to destroy it sooner than it should pass to dishonour.\" \" Excuse me,\" blushingly replied Antone, \" I cannot accept a gift ; it would rob my love of its bloom. The intention is grateful and graceful, but I love my joy too dearly to mar it.\" \" Strange youth ! \" he exclaimed, rather gratified than angered by the refusal. \"You must tell me what you have done to merit this severe criticism of Sir Michal and Lady Dunloop. Here I must demand confidence, for the former in strong language warns me, and insists I am nursing a viper, one sure to eventually sting or rather bite me. According to his accounts you are an adven turer seeking to ingratiate yourself in my favour for a hidden purpose.\" \"Did he do me the justice to allege my motives ? \" quietly inquired Antone. \" No, those were inferences only. I wish your candor could be conveniently made to flow through every stanza, Antone. A few weeks ago he was as extravagant in praises of your virtues"], [53, "45 WON BY HONOUR. as he now declaims against your vices. Cannot you tell me why it is ? \" \" I am signally unfortunate. Did the matter concern myself alone, I would confess without a single reservation, but I must rather suffer loss of your esteem than divulge the reason ; but believe me my actions, I am persuaded, would be satis factory if I judge you rightly.\" \"You are determined, my boy, to test my trusting powers, taxing them severely. Must you really return to college to-morrow, and consign me to a solitude that will be all the more felt for the joy recently experienced in your society ? You could take another week according to that letter, could you not?\" \" I could ; it must not be, or I should be de frauding my kind patroness. You would not advise that, I am certain.\" \" That is conclusive. I bow in mute submis sion ; still it is a stern decree, and will be a sorer wrench than either of us now realize. You must accept this tiny tribute of love, to be expended to promote your life's ambition.\" \" No,\" said Antone, \" you will not pale the first roseate joy of my life.

I will tell my valet to meet me at the end of the village.\""], [55, "CHAPTER IV. The night was one of those only definable as \" skunking darkness.\" In it dangers lurk, uay skulks ; hidden from ken, thus become by intro verted contemplation ten times heavier. As they left the soft light of the library, where they had spent an hour of mellow intercourse, the inky darkness became oppressive. Antone, with exquisite tenderness, drew the Earl's arm through his, saying \u2014 \" I fancied there was a moon's beneficent rays due to earth, or I would not have entertained the thought of your coming. The hour is too late for you ; it is widely different in my case, without money or position to allure.\" The Earl smiled. In it was a dim shadow, auguring coming evil. He said, with a sigh \u2014 \" I should be deeply grieved, dear boy, if your"], [56, "48 WON BY HONOUR. association with me should make you the victim of an arrow, hurled from the quiver of vengeance, envy, and greed, intended for me, but aimed through you. My regard for a stranger, I hear, is no secret, but in everyone's mouth, a wholly in comprehensible state of affairs. It matters little what the outside world thinks, but here arises a spectre that I cannot leave behind.\" \" Never fear ; I am far too insignificant to arouse even envy, supposing anyone should attribute to my motives sordid impressions. Would to heaven my soul were as free from every taint as this. To die in innocence, if to save you, would not be an inglorious termination to a career such as I have dreamed of.\" The moon now, for the first time, came from under a dense cloud, revealing a dark, cloaked, and hooded figure, who passed rapidly across their pathway, and in at the copse gate, at the right of the course they purposed continuing. Antone was about to spring upon him. The Earl antici pated this, laid an icy cold hand upon him to deter, and in a whisper, said \u2014 \" It is more than rash, Antone. For the love of heaven risk not a life now indispensable to my happiness. I was right in my supposition ; our friendship is already a target of malicious design."], [57, "49 WON BY HONOUR. You see now only its dawn ; God alone knows the stage of the drama when the curtain falls.\" \" I entreat you to let me speak with him ! \" \" Hush, Antone ! be cautious, I saw steel glitter.\" Scarcely had the words fallen than the double report of a revolver rang through the park. The Earl fell. Tlie moon now was clear and high. Antone searched for his foe ; no sight of him could he get. He then turned his attention to his com panion, who said \u2014 \" We should be safer could I reach the open park. What are those lights moving in all directions, 'Tone? \" \" The servants searching, I believe. I will call for aid.\" Antone's voice fell on the ear of the distracted steward as music. He was soon by his master's side, white as snowy linen. He exclaimed \u2014 \" The Earl wounded ! Why did you suffer him to leave the house on foot, sir? \" \" I regret it deeply, but until this hour I could not believe in vice thus stalking within the Earl's own gates. Where are the other servants ? Give immediate orders for the villain's pursuit and capture.\" The steward turned towards his master, who E"], [58, "50 WON BY HONOUR. raised himself with the aid of the two, and replied \u2014 \" No, I could never suffer anyone to bring to justice this luckless man, though I were to die by his hand \u2014 he, the worthless son of a beloved sister. No, impossible ! \" Without delay servants were dispatched to the Court for a mattress, whereon the Earl might be safely conveyed to his chamber. Two grooms were sent to procure medical skill for the wounded lord. While he and Antone were left alone for a brief spell, the former told the latter the shot was aimed at his heart ; fortunately the Earl saw and frustrated the base villain's design. While the wound in the thigh was not of a serious nature, at least, not to create grave fears for the safety of the nobleman, yet Antone never for one moment left the Earl's side, and would have postponed his return for a few days, but Lord Covertmoor decidedly negatived this proposition by stating that Antone's immediate return was now imperative, to avert a tragedy which could only result in disgrace to all concerned. Antone's unspoken sympathy was peculiarly soothing to his friend, who told him that what made the trial heavier was the stinging thought that the villain was a son of a beloved sister."], [59, "51 WON BY HONOUR. Further, he imparted the information that he had discovered since Cuthbert's death, a document drawn up by his son, requesting his father in such an issue to cut off the entail, leaving all to a wise and suitable person. Before Antone's departure the Earl inquired of him when his birthday occurred, requesting he would not deny him the satisfaction of receiving a suitable present, to which the young man replied with eager protestations that to receive such a gift, would dim the lustre of a love that required no mercenary impetus to secure its vigor. Lord Covertmoor and Antone took breakfast together for the first time. How little did either of them suppose it would be the only occasion. His lordship then told Antone he could not suffer him to travel by the old stage coach, while danger of an order so thrilling encircled him. He further told An tone a carriage with fresh relays of horses had already been placed at his service. The Earl's steward with three servants would see him safely within the college walls. The smile of incredulity this aroused in the young student only tended to convince the Earl that Antone's eye was single, and his purpose clear and honourable."], [60, "52 WON BY HONOUR. When the moment came the wrench must be made, Lord Covertmoor, after lavish expressions of interest, said \u2014 \"Are you still resolute Antone, in your deter mination of my still remaining in ignorance of your real name ? \" \" I must tax your forbearance and great clemency yet a little longer, my dear friend ; you will one day be satisfied with my reasons, when they can be read out.\" \" Adieu, my beloved 'Tone. Your honor, integrity, and truth have already established for you an unshaken confidence, which nothing could undermine.\" Antone's welcome to the college was as cordial as he could desire. It was evident from Dr. Burslem's manner his young favourite had lost none of the esteem and regard shown for him last term. The fresh, untarnished simplicity of Antone's manner, supported in the rear by a marvellous grasp of intellect and tact, was peculiarly attrac tive to the old Professor. Added to this, was a rectitude and truth Dr. Burslem rarely met with. His long vacation had been passed in the glorious mountain regions of the Alps. In some hotel there he met with Lady Folicate, who was"], [61, "53 WON BY HONOUR. just the woman to be attracted, and to draw out the fine qualities of the genial learned Professor. She was introduced by one of the graduates who had made her ladyship's acquaintance. Dr. Burslem, though bordering on eighty, re tained his full mental vigor. The only one point where mental declension was visible came on these grounds : the associating of persons and events. He had not the vaguest idea who Lady Folicate was, while she had the advantage of knowing all, but by far too well bred to allude to the professional career of the learned man. In conversation, strange to relate, Dr. Burslem was for the moment at a loss to elucidate a theory to his satisfaction. He said \u2014 \" By your permission, Lady Folicate, I will read you a beautiful exposition which struck me as the inspiration of pure genius.\" That lady signified her wish to hear, listening with rapt interest. \" Am I not justly proud to have the guidance of a mind of so great a grasp ? \" asked the Pro fessor. \" He is a graduate of the college.\" \" Indeed ! I can never recall anything at the same time so graphically beautiful, with the merit that it carries with it the power to con vince. Am I asking too much Dr. Burslem, by"], [62, "54 WON BY HONOUR. desiring to know the author of sentiments which cannot fail to leave moral footprints upon the sands of Time, and win for him immortal re nown ? \" Into Dr. Burslem's memory came a spark of recollection, which caused his eye to twinkle, and his reserve to kindle. He replied \u2014 \" I am singularly weak when the fair sex solicit. Here I must be guarded over the prerogative my favourite gives. He is a youth with forcible angles ; you rarely hear a personal pronoun from his lips. Like many other great lights, he is lost in the shower of meteoric influences flashing about. Yet such a man is born to conquer.\" \" May I not then know his name ? I am not without interest in your military college, since I am educating a nephew, and have more than once resolved to pay him a visit. From what I hear he is a nondescript youth, with little or no go in him. I have given him to understand at the end of this term my interest expires ; he need not look to me for a commission.\" The Professor, now all alert, said with amused mock gravity \u2014 \" I do not remember a graduate of your name. May I ask who this youth is ? If this be his lot I shall be peculiarly interested in him.\""], [63, "55 WON BY HONOUR. \" He is the son of a sister who died at his birth under a cloud of mystery. Lord Gortzey, the youth's father, has a singular hatred for him ; he is, I may say, friendless, therefore I thought it best to let him know his future must be of his own carving.\" \" The family name of the Gortzeys is, I feel sure, Derritt. Am I rightly informed ? \" \" Yes, my nephew is Antone Derritt. Would that I could believe success possible from this stock.\" \" Pardon me, Lady Folicate, since your idea of moral responsibility falls immeasurably short of my standard. I must not divulge the name of this 3-oung magnate who will one day have a wide renown.\" By skill the learned doctor extracted much information respecting Antone's family, which afterwards proved of great utility, explaining many otherwise unintelligible passages in the young man's conduct."], [64, "CHAPTER V. The 10th of November arrived, and with it a surprise quite uncontemplated. A letter from Lady Folicate was an event Antone never dreamed of. How she had noted his birthday was another mystery ; enclosed was a cheque for five hundred, a small memento of his late mother ; she begged almost humbly his acceptance of it. He, however, was firmly resolved to return it immediately, with a graceful acknowledgment of the debt already incurred, which he hoped one day to discharge with interest. Antone's chafed spirit turned to the large sealed parcel lying with his letters upon the break fast table. He perceived with a glance it was a handsome dressing-case, accompanied by a large Russian leather bag, large enough to supply every want of camp life. The letter which accompanied these gifts drew tears from the young man's eyes."], [65, "57 WON BY HONOUR. Full of tender, filial yearning, with many protesta tions of joy at the bare hope of his return to spend a brief spell at the Court prior to embarking on the new enterprise upon which he had built so many hopes. Young as Antone was, his ideas were far more like those of a man of riper years. He weighed the reception of those gifts, and could not reconcile himself to their acceptance. At length he con sulted the kindly Professor, determining to lay bare all, in order that Dr. Burslem might be un fettered in his judgment. So forcibly did Antone show the nature and strength of his resolve, that the Professor said, to refuse their acceptance would be cruel ; on the other hand he fully took iu the fact that this would alter the tone and character of the friendship, and suggested that the youth should give something in return of equivalent value. After due reflection Antone remembered that he had only one thing worthy of this distinguished honor. After submitting it to the president's consideration he was fully conscious that the small ornate cabinet of jewels in the rough, was of double value to the Earl's gifts. He despatched them, stating that he sincerely hoped the Earl would not be grieved at the exchange. These"], [66, "58 WON BY HONOUR. were the only grounds upon which they could be retained without injury. As will be conjectured Lord Covertmoor was staggered by the gift, it being singularly lost by an old aunt of his. The family had spared no cost to repossess themselves of it without success. Stirring events rapidly followed this, and prevented Lord Covertmoor asking Antone how this priceless treasure came into his possession. So fully was the time occupied, week followed week until the end of the term drew nigh. Singular as it may seem, the anxious student had been wholly absorbed by the attainment of every possible knowledge to promote his advancement that the first step towards the practical illustra tion of this knowledge being carried into life was overlooked. Antone retired at night too weary for meditation. He must have had some strong impression to have thus driven him forward. So close had the time arrived, it wanted only four days to the closing examination of the term, when Dr. Burslem entered the student's room. The moment was an unauspicious one, for the young man was on the eve of solving the last problem essential to the completion of his papers for his competition for honor. As the Doctor, radiant with delight and brimful"], [67, "WON BY HONOUR. 59 of important news, was about to divulge it, Antone held up his hand, saying \u2014 \" Stay, dear friend, leave me yet another hour, or my career may fail where you would desire success.\" Dr. Burslem withdrew, still holding a significant document. Returning to the library he told the simple truth to the bearer of the important mission, who smiled good-humouredly, saying \u2014 \" We must wait, since it is not contempt of regal power that occasions it, but a determination to succeed. This is the genuine metal.\" Dr. Burslem conversed with the Count in order to make the delay less apparent, then, after half the grace had elapsed, entered the youth's room, who still sat with his ears covered. \"Antone,\" cried the old man, \"the common order of things is reversed in our case. It is youth usually who is impatient of delay, ill brooking it ; age in my case resents it. Have you not solved the problem on which you are to rise to power? \" \"It is complete, awaiting its sequel,\" dreamily muttered the youth. Looking up he saw the document the Doctor held, and asked, eagerly, if it were for him, and how it came."], [68, "60 WON BY HONOUR. \" That you must find out by perusal. All I know is, it bears a crown and sceptre, the insignia of royalty, and was conveyed by a regal messenger. I could not restrain my desire, dear boy, to share your good fortune. Open it or I fear some sad calamity will overtake me. I only bring one of two documents ; with that alone could I be en trusted.\" Antone's deadly pallor showed he was the sub ject of conflicting emotions. He rose to his full height, and handing the document to his friend for perusal, said \u2014 \"To whom can I owe so great and distin guished honor? But why fight under a foreign banner?\" A choice of position was offered \u2014 to serve in the body-guard of the Spanish King or the acceptance of lieutenancy in a cavalry regiment on the point of active service. The choice was left wholly unfettered, with the intimation that, should active service be chosen, his Majesty would concur in the wisdom and judge the young man wished to distinguish himself in the service of the country which had done him the signal honor of such an opportunity. \" Which is it to be, my boy ? \" asked the Pro fessor, his eyes full of tears, his nerves were only"], [69, "61 WON BY HONOUR. fitted to the war waged with intellect; an un sheathed sword was a shrinking horror to Dr. Burslem. \" The former is not for me. I am no courtier in the latter. I may yet reach the elevation, whereon I can, at this moment, see my standard fluttering in the breeze.\" \" Come, then, let me accompany you to the King's messenger, whom I was reluctantly com pelled to ask to await the completion of your solution.\" The beauty of the diplomatic envoy's dress was imposing, his manners those of a finished courtier, contrasting strikingly with the outspoken, fear less candor exhibited by Antone. Without hesitation he made known that, in making choice of the two positions, there was no difficulty. \" I have,\" said he, \" selected the cavalry regi ment without demur ; for court I am wholly unfitted. To whom am I indebted under your gracious Sovereign, noble Count, for this prefer ment?\" \" That, I believe, is a secret his Majesty reserves, since he has not seen fit to honor me \u2014 I judge so.

I suppose you are con versant with the Spanish language ? \" \"Yes, Spanish, French, Italian, German, and Latin I can converse in with tolerable freedom. There need be no delay ; my resolve is unwaver ing. Your gracious Majesty's supreme condescen sion has taken me by surprise ; I can neither sufficiently, nor adequately, offer my acknow ledgments. This, I trust, will soon become patent in the manner I hope to distinguish myself in the cause of that nation who has adopted me.\" \"Why choose danger, when an easy and luxurious career is laid before you, and the signal honor of being close to his Majesty's person.\" \"LBy accepting the latter, I deem it my office is dual. While I guard his Majesty's possessions from danger, I am likewise securing the same for his sacred person ? \" \" Granted,\" said the dignified courtier. \" If I mistake not, you possess the courage for which your nation has hitherto been justly renowned. I have once seen eyes strongly resembling yours. It is well you have chosen the camp rather than the court ; they would make sore havoc with the hearts of our Spanish maidens.

Not one shilling of patrimony will ever fall to my share.\" \" This evidently has no weight with the King. He does not reckon that disqualifies, but proves rather an incentive to carve out a brilliant future for yourself.\" \" If Antone Derritt wields the sword with as masterly a hand as he Las unsheathed the one from the scabbard of learning he will wield it with glorious success,\" said the Professor. \" What is the young man's name ? \" asked the Count. \" Here there is evidently a fluke.\" When the Professor gave it, the Count asked of Antone if he were a son of Lord Gortzey ? The youth replied, with a blush \u2014 \" I am the youngest son of the Earl.\" \" Not so far from the title and estates, either,\" muttered the Count. \" I desire neither,\" contemptuously answered Antone. \" Stay, do not fling treasures thus from you, without a mere glance at their worth.\" He then told Antone, after the papers were duly signed,"], [72, "64 WON BY HONOUR. that the King desired him to accept his post, and to fill it as promptly as possible. \" His Majesty measures a man by the eager promptitude with which he responds to the call of duty. As a friend, I tell you the King is only severe where indolence and irregularity come under his notice. The latter you are not; the former is equally foreign to you.\" The Count departed, leaving young Derritt stunned by a surprise he could not have conceived. The Professor was overjoyed by this unexpected slice of good fortune falling to his favourite's share. He could throw no light on its source, but requested that the Earl might be immediately informed, and in the same letter told how impossible it was even to spend an hour at the Court. The sorrow that Antone fancied these tidings would evoke proved to be a feeling of great relief, that dispatch rendered such terrible danger im possible. While Lord Covertmoor was thankful for Antone's removal from threatening vengeance, he was fully conscious that perils of another, and deadly order would encompass him. Better far, thought he, perish by the cannon ball or the sword of a common enemy than die by the hand of a murderer."], [73, "65 WON BY HONOUR. Lord Covertmoor would have given much for a likeness of Antone. His resemblance to his own son still remained a mystery. He delighted in dwelling upon the youth's brusque honesty, bold uprightness, combined with an uncommon freedom from love of greed. As he thought, before him rose the idea how all men seemed to be permeated by a spirit of inordinate acquisitive ness, a malady not confined to one strata, but common to the throne, and the vagrant who way lays with importunity for a single copper. No secret worm in the vegetable can effect more mischief than does this insidious one to moral in tegrity, which it saps, destroying social laws. When Lord Covertmoor received Antone's letter he was in the grotto where their short acquaint ance began, and how the youth had woven him self into a part of the Earl's being, his love for him was to himself a mystery, as was the cruel hatred expressed by Lord Erskept for the stranger. The Earl knew that his enemy could have no knowledge of the steps he was taking. Then came the terrible thought, when the villain did know what would supervene. He was almost dumb before the recollection that this fire-brand \u2014 nay, very devil \u2014 was a son of his lovely, gentle Hyacinth. F"], [74, "66 WON BY HONOUR. Human nature is a subtle labyrinth, a com pound mass of apparent contradiction, deducible only by time and He who holds the secret problem and its complex origin in His own Hand. Before Lord Covertmoor's mind passed the sad vicissitudes of his late sister's married life, the course now followed by this reckless family, the dishonour which covered the name. Before him came, too, the memory of the helpless infant left by 'Cynthe covered with the evil odor surrounding her death. Into the Earl's memory came the recollection that his sister's eldest son was four-and-twenty before the birth of the infant. Strange as it may seem, a qualm of conscience visited Lord Covert moor, as he thought how cruel it was thus to abandon a baby to such an element for the first time recalled. He had heard nothing of the child for years ; its memory appeared consigned to oblivion. \" The past is beyond our reach, repent as we may. I have done what I believe to be right. Hillcote attaches grave import to recent events. I am far from nervous.\" Since the Earl's attachment for Antone, he appeared to have entered on a new era. He in terviewed his stewards daily, set on foot extensive alterations at the Court, all of which, rumour cir-"], [75, "67 WON BY HONOUR. culated, were after the ideal plans of the young guest. Certainly Antone sketched an elaborate design for a new tomb, after a visit with his friend to the old, moss-grown, crumbling one wherein laid the Countess and her son. The site was chosen by Antone within sight of the mansion, yet not an object of prominence. The stone had already been formally laid."], [76, "CHAPTER VI. Upon Antone Derritt's arrival at the Court of Spain, the cordial reception awaiting him, and from a Monarch who held the reins of despotic rule, was a puzzle the youth could not fathom. The whole of his contracted acquaintance re quired little survey ; each attempt showed more flagrantly the fallacy of supposing any of those he had met in the Professor's coterie could have sufficient influence to move a Monarch such as Ferdinand was known to be. As the youth entered the august presence the King smiled, and with pleasant, yet dignified, con descension thus addressed him \u2014 \" Antone Derritt, you have done well to enter our Royal Presence with two essential qualifica tions we deem absolute credentials of success, namely, promptitude and industry. The former"], [77, "69 WON BY HONOUR. is evident by the alacrity with which you have responded to our call, while the latter exhibits itself by the honors culled during your military education. Here is your sabre, sword, and com mission ; your future is in your own hands. Remember, bravery is a spirit of leaven, that diffuses itself far and wide ; its power is limitless. Your regiment is under immediate orders to sail for a distant portion of our dominion in the new world, where insurrectionary disaffection causes both bloodshed and discomfort to our subjects.\" Antone knelt, received his sabre and sword with low obeisance, accompanied by protestations of his loyal allegiance to the sceptre, which in gracious condescension had sought his services. The King said \u2014 \" Rise, Lieutenant Derritt, we honour your choice ; it is far nobler to win laurels by bravery than to procure those culled by them who, to gratify ambition, attain easily and wear laurels forced in an unhealthy soil.\" Antone left the King's presence, immediately made his beloved friend at the Court aware of what had passed, and the probable future before him, expressing much wonder at the favor he enjoyed, without the merest shadowy knowledge of how it came into . his possession. Antone"], [78, "70 WON BY HONOUR. urged the Earl not to be anxious if circumstances prevented a constant communication on his part, while he entreated of his friend to remove to a safe distance from his enemy, asserting how injurious to the Earl's health must be such a ceaseless incubus. Time rolled now slowly along at the Court, possibly rendered more tedious from the vague threats for ever circulating as to what laid in the near future. Several months had passed without any tidings reaching the Earl, of Antone. He was anxious and troubled. One day, while waiting for the architect to complete a sketch, he took up a paper. His eye fell upon the following para graph \u2014 \" Desperate encounter between the Spanish soldiers and the insurgents ; much bloodshed, with terrible loss of life. The bravery of the troops has called forth much admiration. The prowess of a young Englishman who received his commission from the King very recently is one of rare interest.

The loss of their colonel, with numbers of their comrades, dispirited the soldiers. The gallant conduct of their lieutenant fired them ; he led them forward in a moment when the enemy was certain of a lull in the hostilities. This ruse had the desired effect; the gallant forces fell upon the insurgents with sur prising success; effectually routed them, drove them back, leaving numbers of dead and dying upon the field. A panic of fear prevails, for since the memorable night of the encounter the brave lieutenant has disappeared ; it is feared treachery lurks in the camp, his popularity having secured him enemies.\" Lord Covertmoor's paper fell from his hand ; a deadly chill crept over him. He started to his feet with resolution, and said \u2014 \" This is not the time to succumb ! No, he is not dead. How strange, I saw him last night standing by the charger I shipped him over. His mournful expression may indicate distress or suffering. I am sure,\" thought Lord Covertmoor, \" the King will offer a large ransom, besides com manding a vigilant search to be instituted.\" Try as the Earl would to reassure himself he could not feel easy. He sat down and wrote a letter, quite unaware that his correspondence had"], [80, "72 WON BY HONOUR. mysteriously come under the control of his enemy. After it was concluded he paced the room restlessly, until disturbed by the entrance of Purvit, his valet. He started when his master's blanched face was raised to his. In query he said \u2014 \"Pardon me, my lord, I have been knocking over half-an-hour. Are you ill ? May I send for Dr. Crait?\" \"Dr. Crait ! No, stupid man, I am only anxious.\" \" Dinner is awaiting you, my lord ; the bell has sounded three times. I was compelled through fear to enter.\" \" What is the hour? How strange. It surely is not so late ? \" \" It is. Will you dress ? I saw Ruthven send back the soup a few minutes ago.\" \" Dress, no ! Go and tell Ruthven he must please attend the dinner alone to-night.\" This old, confidential retainer now held the office of steward ; indeed, it would be difficult to say what this faithful man was to his master. This message conveyed far more than the bearer could decipher. He looked severely at Purvit as he gave a broad grin distasteful to the superior officer, who said \u2014 \" The Earl would do wise to discharge you."], [81, "73 WON BY HONOUR. Were he not so free from suspicion he could not fail to detect in you complicity.\" The valet made no reply, save the shrug of his broad shoulders, intimating that Ruthven had only aimed a shaft at random to endeavour to plumb his suspicious. The steward's words were few and well chosen. The Earl took his seat mechanically. The lines round his finely-chiselled mouth revealed fresh suffering. Always pale, his visage was now blanched, as though every drop of blood at his heart had congealed or frozen. The courses were removed almost without being touched, while the steward's face, ever long, ap peared to have an accession of length. He gently suggested the wing of a chicken and some sparkling hock. \" Ruthven,\" tartly called the Earl, \" your shoes creak horribly ; is there no cure for this distasteful discord ? \" \" I am sorry, my lord. You shall never suffer the infliction when I can remedy it.\" \" Do you keep all doors and windows fastened after dusk ? Are you aware who this enemy is ? If so, you need not fear to speak.

Your valet is not to be trusted either in or out of your sight. He knows what I consider him, and I do not hesitate to affirm. It is your duty, my lord, to dismiss him at once. He is not the only one ; others in power are even worse than he. These plots are vile, indeed.

His wife and children are deserted, and from all I hear the parents of Lady Erskept are victims, likewise.\" Through the open window at that moment entered the dark, cloaked, and hooded figure. Ruthven was in shadow, hence not obser.ved. With considerable stealth .he contrived to ' reach the ante-room, where stood Hes, the steward, pale"], [86, "78 WON BY HONOUR. and breathless. A mirror reflected every action of the Earl and his intruder. The former rose to his feet, pale but intrepid, and said calmly \u2014 \" For what purpose are you here ? \" \" To demand money or your life ; one of the two I will have. No paltry sum will appease me, I vow ; ten thousand and not a fraction less.\" \" You scoundrel, do you think thus to gain your purpose ? I am not the man to be driven to give my thousands to be sown broadcast by the hand of a profligate. Your threats intimidate me not.\" \" I swear,\" said Erskept, in a towering rage, \" you shall pay for your nigardly dealing by your heir. What can you do with all your vast wealth?\" \" What I list.

Lord Erskept advanced a few paces now ; the table was the only barrier separating assailant from foe. Lord Covertmoor glanced fearlessly at the glittering steel in the demon's hand, raised as though ready for the plunge, while his eyes shot fiendish gleams around him. \" Do you relent ? Nothing less than ten thousand will even accord to you a brief span of life ; to delay is to anger me.\" The villain, in his passionate determination, hissed his words out through his closely-set teeth. The Earl calmly replied \u2014 \" My resolves, as you have had previous occa sion to remember, are not based on shifting sands, but are irrevocable.\" \"And so is your doom.\" The villain made a rush at Lord Covertmoor, who parried the blow with the skill of an ac complished fencer, while both assailant and foe were startled by the report of a revolver and the rapid whizzing of bullets. Lord Erskept fell, carrying with him some chairs. The shots had evidently been fired from the doorway of the ante-room. No one was visible. The double report brought a strong muster of affrighted servants, doubtless amongst them the one who had done the deed. At a signal from"], [88, "80 WON BY HONOUR. Ruthven the Earl bade the household to withdraw,. with the exception of the steward and the youth Cumnor, the son of Lord Cuthbert's valet. The latter did not long survive the tragic fate of his beloved young master. Lord Covertmoor gave orders for a medical man to be immediately sent for, and meanwhile inquired anxiously as to Ruthven's opinion of the wound, which was given without demur as un fortunately not a dangerous though a tedious one. While the Earl thus stood the villain unclosed his eyes, an'd said, fiercely \u2014 \" The second time you have turned the odds against me. The next I shall be the hero of the hour, not you.\" \" Calm yourself, Erskept,\" said Lord Covert moor. \" You do not owe this wound to me, as in sober reason you must own the shots passed me.

The fame of Lieutenant Derritt did not suffer by his mysterious disappearance on the consummation of his signal and brilliant victory. Rather was his strange and unaccountable removal looked upon with suspicion, especially by the men of his own regiment. They fanned the spark into a flame that threatened mutiny. The same dis satisfaction spread rapidly, and was confirmed by the indifference exhibited by the General and some of the subordinate officers to the fate of the brave young officer. The Commander of the detach ments addressed the men severely, and went so far as to say he believed young Derritt was slain ere the victory was complete, a declaration everj7 man who rode with the victorious young- Englishman into the heart of the camp in dignantly refuted as a lie hatched in jealousy. So fierce and hot did the regulars become, to a man they were devotedly attached to the young English officer, who passed in and out amongst"], [91, "83 WON BY HONOUR. them, as though one of them, without the conscious air of superiority, distasteful to the privates. At length the General found it needful to allay the suspicion rapidly enveloping him, and forcibly causing his power to wane by sending a troop of mounted soldiers to the enemies' camp with a promise of a large ransom to be paid on Lieutenant Derritt's liberty being accorded him. The command was given to Colonel Fusey, a well known enemy of the King's favourite. As soon as it was known who was to conduct the search general wrath was excited. The soldiers, one and all, declared that if they swung for it, or were shot, the King should know the cause of the mutiny. The General heard their threats with consummate indifference, while the Colonel was in no way dis concerted by the opinion he discovered was enter tained of him amongst the men of the several corps. A number of these asserted in the hearing of their commanding officers that the expedition was a farce, and would prove a failure, because be who conducted it had most likely been accessory to the plot. A declaration so bold brought the colour to the swarthy cheek of the Colonel. All he could answer was \u2014 \" They would learn to curse the day of their"], [92, "84 WON BY HONOUR. insubordination, and that for the cause of a young man who smiled upon them while he worked under cover to deprive them of their present comforts.\" Not a single one believed the calumny. The result of the deputation was as they predicted, a complete failure, with not so much as a decent sign of regret on the part of either General or Colonel. Again the privates resolved to make the officers to understand that their suspicions were confirmed by the evident amusement of their subtle adversary at the peep thus given them into the heart of their enemies' disaffected military arrangements. The severe repulse, together with great loss of life, rendered the enemy quiet, the General's report being they were effectually worsted. In his official transmission a nominal mention was barely made of the triumphs of the gallant young officer. The King, who from the first had dis covered the leaven at work against his favourite, had a spy out there, who faithfully reported all, as it really transpired, and transmitted this by the same medium, the General's despatches were conveyed, of course, unknown to the latter. In less than two months a general command for the return of the troops immediately did not create much surprise."], [93, "85 WON BY HONOUR. On their arrival the King heard in silence the General's and Colonel's version separately. Their superficial and flimsy attempt to arouse a semblance of the interest they did not feel, was too palpable for the King's clear judgment. Not content with this, he interviewed the brave little band who were with the young officer throughout their signal victory. Their praise tallied with that of the spy, yet was a flat contradiction to the account of both officially, and verbally by the com manding officer and subordinate ones. It was the opinion of the troops that to send out another detachment would be vain after this absurd farce, besides, the brutality of the enemy was such that death appeared certain, and in its most cruel aspect. The Sovereign showed his severe displeasure, recalled the officers, removed the General to a distant part of his dominion ; a blow the old man did not long survive. The Colonel was sent in an opposite direction. Still all the source of the jealous faction was not stamped out, it was stronger than even the King supposed ; he was outside the know. It was now December, the morning cutting, cold, and cheerless ; already snow laid upon the ground inches thick. The streets and houses of the ancient city of"], [94, "86 WON BY HONOUR. Madrid presented an aspect of severe beauty. Few people were abroad, and those driven by the stern necessity of gaining a livelihood by administering to the wants of others. An eager, thin, nipped, half-starved, ragged little urchin threaded his way through the blind ing snow, his naked little feet, scarlet, forming a decided contrast to the white snow in which they left their impress. Weary the boy un doubtedly was, yet all intent in the search for something his biting hunger and intense fatigue could not make him neglect. His head was turned from side to side of the street, while his large, sparkling eyes were carefully scanning the houses. In one hand he carried a soiled, crumpled paper, clutching it eagerly with his long bony fingers. He appeared as though he had come many a weary mile in pursuit of his object. His feet had been blistered, broken, and healed, giving place to keener records of suffering. Still the brave little lad gave no sign of surrender of the will. The boy's singular loneliness and possible desti tution drew the attention of a man who had evidently returned from his rounds with milk. He was no Spaniard by the contour of his face, rather did he appear a good-tempered specimen of the John Bull stamp."], [95, "87 WON BY HONOUR. The boy halted before the house at the door of which the man stood, either attracted by the kindly face, or the aroma from the fresh fried bacon, it was difficult to say \u2014 perhaps the latter. His parched little lips parted, and his nostrils dilated with the agreeable odor. Suddenly he remembered something, glanced at his paper, was about to go on. The man laid a gentle hand on the boy's shoulder, calling to his wife within thus \u2014 \" Missis, can you spare a morsel of bacon for a half-starved child ? \" \" Bring him in ; we shall never miss it, never ! \" \" Come in,\" said the man. \" Do ye not like the smell of the fire and bacon, boy ? \" The child moved on, shaking his head mourn fully, while his pinched face told its own story of want. This time the man called loudly. The boy gained confidence, pointed mournfully to his ears. This the milkman understood, and called to his wife \u2014 \" The little chap is deaf, missis. Come, ye may do this better nor me. He points first to his ears, then his tongue.\" \" To be sure, man. Do not ye see, poor little fel low, he is both deaf and dumb. See how he clenches that paper \u2014 there is the pith of his story.\""], [96, "88 WON BY HONOUR. The woman, full of compassion, drew near, stroked the terribly gaunt cheek soothingly, then showed him a piece of bread, took his hand into hers, drew him gently to the warm stove whereon the bacon broiled. The thin face lighted up radiantly when the good woman seated him before a cup of smoking coffee, a plate of bacon, and a slice of home made bread. The poor child's perplexity was now apparent. He could not part from his paper \u2014 to lay it down for a single second was serious. The man signed to him to lay it down, signify ing it would be safe. Instead he kissed it tenderly, while tears rolled down his cheeks on to the well-soiled missive. \"There is something uncommon here, Ben.\" They were English, seldom speaking Spanish when alone. She rose, fetched a pencil and paper. The lad watched eagerly as she wrote in English \u2014 \" Eat a good breakfast \u2014 trust us \u2014 we will not rob you of your paper.\" The boy soon showed he understood it not, while the husband said \u2014 \"Try Spanish Merritt. What can we be thinking of ? He is not English.\""], [97, "89 WON BY HONOUR. While the wife wrote iu his native tongue, he rose, looked over her shoulder, capering round the room, clapping his hands in evident delight, then took the pencil from her hand, and wrote \u2014 \" Vou will surely not betray me if I trust you ? Are you English ? \" \" Betray you ! Never ! \" wrote the woman ; \" but rather will we do our utmost to help you if you are engaged in what we deem right.\" IVow he ventured to unroll his paper, still clasp ing it tightly. He let them read. It ran thus \u2014 It was written in a bold, clear, educated hand. \" For the love of all you hold sacred aid this boy to gain access privately to the person of His Most Gracious Majesty the King of Spain.\" In the corner were the letters A. D. D. in monogram ; at the foot of this the well-known crest of the cross swords. The woman uttered a low groan, turned deadly pale, while her husband exclaimed, \" What is the matter, missis ? \" in tones of real tenderness. \" This is terrible news. Something has gone wrong with the darling of my heart \u2014 the missis's baby \u2014 this is his monogram. He was the only mem ber of her family to whom she gave her maiden name. We must help him. Yet our aid may"], [98, "90 WON BY HONOUR. injure his cause. I must ask where he is. Oh, I shall never cease to love that child as my own.\" \" Thou forgets, lassie, he is no longer a babe, and may have quite forgotten Nurse Merritt.\" \" Never ! He has been to battle, for which 1 gave him a thirst. What ails him, God only knows.\" \" Ask the lad.\" This delay had frightened the boy, who was at a loss to understand the tableau, with no word of explanation, he ran for the door. Ben reached it first, and prevented the intent, while Merritt wrote \u2014 \" Tell me where the owner of this crest is, for I love him dearer than my own life. I took him from his dying mother \u2014 he was mine for six years.\" He replied, while his face beamed with joy \u2014 \" A prisoner in the bands of a barbarous and cruel people, betrayed by the army he served so gallantly.\" Tears started to the woman's eyes as she asked where, and if he had come far. The lad's reply was so touching, Merritt took him to her heart and kissed him upon both cheeks, urging him to eat his breakfast, and then go forth on his errand of mercy. Ben should take"], [99, "91 WON BY HONOUR. him within sight of the King's palace, while she would beseech Heaven to grant him success. The woman, in her affection, asked many questions the. lad's caution prevented his satisfy ing, assuring her she should hear by some means as to the result of his enterprise. As the boy went forth, accompanied, or rather pioneered, by Ben, who walked on as though he had no connection with him, afraid to injure a cause he would aid, the snow was falling faster, the streets were nearly deserted. An hour before noon Ben halted, looked towards the sentinels on duty, then watching his oppor tunity to give a significant gesture, returned. The sentinels were a barrier which had not entered into the lad's calculation, wholly unused to Courts. The remembrance of the suffering of his friend stimulated him to effort. He walked up to where the patrols marched to and fro, re gardless of their frowns. His own tact made him aware it would be bad policy to show his paper here. The sentinel cried something he could not hear, shrewdly guessed he was bidding him go. He wrote, after waiting a weary time \u2014 \" I must have an audience with the King.\" To this the sentinel gave a laugh of derision"], [100, "92 WON BV HONOUR. and passed on. Still the boy sat night and day, his feet and fingers bitten by the frost. Every hour that fled without success was a barbed arrow in his bleeding heart. On the morning of the third day Ritzley sat on a kerb, giving way to a fit of bitter weeping, the sentinels meanwhile deriding, and saying \u2014 \" You will have to wait until your hair grows grey in the service of folly.\" When the boy's anguish was at its zenith, a slight bustle ensued. The gates flew back for a brilliant equipage to pass through. It contained the Prince, a boy of some ten summers, and his equerry. His quick eye fell upon the weeping child, scarcely older than himself. He was deeply moved, ordered the carriage to stop at once, sprang impulsively out, and pulled from his purse coins, which he attempted to put into the urchin's hand, which he tightly closed, and shook mourn fully his head, pulled out his pencil, and com menced writing. \" He is deaf and dumb,\" said the tutor, who now stood by the young Prince's side. \" How sad,\" said the tender youth. \" He can write.\" These words were clearly written \u2014 \" Can I trust you ? I bring sad news to his Majesty the King, and have been waiting here"], [101, "WON BY HONOUR 93 three days and nights to accomplish my pur pose.\" The Prince wrote, eagerly \u2014 \" Trust me, I am the King's son, and will take you to him ; but what evil tidings bring you, and from whence come ye ? \" Ritzley handed him the soiled, worn paper. A radiant smile lighted the noble boy's handsome face ; the light of that potent power love, beamed from his black eyes as he read. He embraced the ragged boy, much to the dismay of his suite. Again took the pencil, and asked if he had come alone to perform so noble a mission, his eyes falling on the frost-bitten, shoeless feet. Without waiting for the boy's written reply he bundled the ragged lad into the Royal carriage, and placed him by his side. In vain the equerries and servants remonstrated. The Prince heeded not, but gave orders for his purpose to be fulfilled. Their route laid through the principal streets. All eyes were directed to the little vagrant boy upon whom the future Hope of the nation was lavishing so many smiles. He was reading a brief sketch of his friend's terrible straits, the cruelty and the treachery that had caused him this indignity. The regal boy smarted under the disgrace of a treatment so base to one who had merited the highest honour. The Prince could"], [102, "94 WON BY HONOUR. not lavish sufficient attention upon the half starved little messenger at his side. Not more than an hour could have elapsed before the return of the Royal equipage with its curious occupant. The youthful Prince had meanwhile woven his plot. In order to effect his purpose he bound all to secrecy for some hours, and took his tutor into his confidence. He knew how deeply the King still mourned for the young Englishman's loss ; news of him he had often said would never again be heard. The young Prince, more hopeful, had on the night previous induced his father to lay very heavy stakes upon the bet that Lieutenant Derritt would never again be heard of. To give pleasure to his Royal parent was a delight the boy took deep interest in. Ritzley was, therefore, smuggled into the Prince's rooms under the capacious folds of his tutor's cloak. Thus the most dangerous part of the plot was happily completed without fear of detec tion, except that already the city was alive from end to end with the strange conduct of the King's son driving through the streets of the ancient capital with a vagrant boy. Still that news could not reach the King before his son's plot had blossomed and borne fruit."], [103, "CHAPTER VIII. The King's son enjoyed great liberty, yet over this was a vigilant eye kept by the tutor, whose duty it was to submit his regal pupil's actions to his Royal father for censure or approval. ' This was effected occasionally as the case merited, and sometimes with a degree of austerity the tutor viewed too severe. The extreme precocity of the King's son was rather fostered by the Court, where his brilliant sallies of wit were so enjoyed, while his Majesty, on the other hand, condemned the practice with severity. The Prince visited his father immediately upon his return, and scanned his face curiously to learn if any report had reached his Majesty's ear. He soon discovered to his satisfaction that the King was that night in one of his most urbane moods, thus favouring his plan. The Prince paced the room restlessly, while the King looked anxiously,"], [104, "96 WON BY HONOUR. knowing as he did the boy was no ordinary character. The latter left his father's chamber to converse with Ritzley, who was haying refresh ment. By means of his pencil, for the first time he learned only a part of his mission had been made known. He was not offended at this partial con fidence, as the lad's fidelity to the Lieutenant's injunctions had been strictly followed. The hour for the surprise was fixed for that spent in domestic intercourse after the formal dinner had been in all state duly served. All conventional Court rules were set aside \u2014 an hom os bliss to the Queen. The young Prince, quicker than was his wont, entered the blue drawing room. \"What is it, my son?\" asked his Majesty. \"You seem on the eve of combustion. I shall never smile upon you without a frown in the rear until you win my wager, which I really think is now impossible, every day's flight lessens my hope.\" \" Say not so, your Maj est}', or the star of hope wanes under the blight of mistrust. What say you, royal pater, if I presume to censure my august Sovereign for lack of faith in prayer.\" \" That you are waxing bolder, my son, than your years or due respect for a parent warrants. Nevertheless, my Ferdinand, I will take the rebuke,"], [105, "97 WON BY HONOUR. inasmuch as we are told heaven often teaches through babes.\" \"Further, Royal Sire, I am not at all satisfied with the conditions your Majesty's wager contains. Should I bring the King tidings to-night that will fulfil my contract, will his Majesty in gracious condescension give me any boon I choose to ask ? \" The Sovereign paused, puzzled, then said \u2014 \"My son, it is a serious subject for jest or trifle, for such I can only deem your words. Heaven knows I would give thanks, if such a contingency were possible. I would erect a monastery to commemorate the goodness and mercy of God.\" A tear sparkled on the King's eyelash, while his lower lip quivered, showing how deeply his Majesty felt what he said. The Prince knelt, and with an accelerated veneration, kissed his father's hand, and said \u2014 \"Have I found favor in the King's sight? Will he grant me yet another boon very dear to my heart if I bring the news my Royal Sire desires ? \" \"I may safely promise anything, even to the half of my kingdom, on so improbable a theme. I know a son of Spain could not make a request in- H"], [106, "98 WON BY HONOUR. compatible with the dignity of the throne and the nation. I promise in all faith, would that I might be called upon unexpectedly to fulfil.\" Again the boy kissed his father's hand, rose, retreating backwards with soft, liquid southern dignity, ease, and grace, while the King and Queen were spellbound by wonder at the air of mystery encircling their son's actions. \" I am afraid your Majesty has been over-rash in promising,\" said Queen Isabella, dryly. The door opened ; the Prince entered hand-in hand with a ragged boy. His naked feet sank into the rich oriental carpets, his thin, gaunt face aglow with delight. The splendour of the King's surroundings was lost in the joy that his mission had been fulfilled. No sound of delight could escape from his lips, hence his pent-up feelings had a marvellously spiritualizing effect. Through the tattered apology for trousers the boy's bare knees were visible. His short cropped hair stood erect, full of electric fluid. In his left hand he held his dirty, soiled, crumpled passport to the Royal presence. The King frowned as he thought of his son's singular procedure, while the boy prostrated himself before his Sovereign, kissing the hem of his robe with gushing fervor."], [107, "99 WON BY HONOUR. \" Rise,\" said the King, sternly, \" and tell me the mission which can atone for such an outrage to the commonest decency to enter our Royal presence thus unbidden ? \" The boy heeded not the Royal command, but made mute appeals of pathetic gestures. \" What means this, my son ? \" angrily spoke the Royal Sire. \" Who dares to disobey me ? \" \" Your will, most Royal Sire, would this boy nobly do. Were it your sovereign behest to com mand him to walk on burning coals, in order to fulfil your will, and execute his mission suc cessfully, he would attempt it, as you may see by his naked feet. He has been three days and nights outside Our Royal Palace awaiting an op portunity.\" \" Rise immediately,\" again said the King, this time stamping his foot. The lad looking reproachfully at the Prince, the latter said \u2014 \"He would rise, your Majesty, did he under stand you, but since wise heaven has withheld from him two inestimable boons it has richly dowered you with, Royal Sire, I must commend him to your Gracious clemency. The noble little lad is both deaf and dumb.\" A look of Sublime compassion chased away the"], [108, "100 WON BY HONOUR. anger, while the Prince, by a gesture, bade the boy kneel, and present his soiled passport to the Royal Hand. So absorbed was his Majesty in the contents he never observed the condition of the paper. A light, such as his son had never before seen, irradiated his countenance. He handed it to the Queen, with the exclamation \u2014 \" Thank heaven ! The blot may yet be removed from the memory of Time that Spain treated with such cruel treachery one who fought nobly and bravely for her. Is this all ? \" asked the King, forgetful that the ragged little suppliant, who still knelt, could not understand \u2014 yet he seemed to grasp the impression. His Majesty wanted further confirmation. While the boy fumbled amongst his rags he became sensible he must pull off his tattered vest, for the document was sewn within. Ritzley now blushed, and became strangely shy as he glanced mournfully towards the three brilliantly-attired Royal Personages before him. The Prince offered him pencil and paper, whereon he wrote \u2014 \" The Lieutenant's message to the King is sewn within the tatters of my vest. How can I take it off here ? \" The Prince received his Royal Sire's command"], [109, "WON BY HONOUR. 101 for the waiving of all ceremony when the honor of a nation so dear to them might yet be freed from blemish. The boy's face overflowed with a joy he never attempted to conceal, but when the King's son attempted to take the document from his hand to place it in that of the King, he shook his head, mournfully refusing. \" Ah ! I see,\" said the Prince ; \" it is in your Hand alone he is to place this. Faithful little messenger; he is worthy of a high place near your Royal Person.\" \" This is sealed with the cross-swords. Thank God ! It is from Antone Derritt ! He still lives. Stay ; how long can this child have been coming? \" \" No doubt the Lieutenant would date his com munication.\" \"No, my son. Learn from the boy all particu lars, and let me be made aware of the details. I see my gallant officer owes his life to these boys ; the brother remains behind to aid Antone, while this one travels to bring us the tidings.\" \" Heaven bless the boys,\" murmured the Queen. \" How few would evince that most testing of all to fortitude, physical suffering for the safety of another.\" \"No time must be lost to send suitable aid.

Who can I trust in these days of treachery ? \" said the King. \" Royal Sire,\" exclaimed the Prince, \" it is my turn to remind you, as my wager is well won, I must submit my conditions. You cannot have forgotten a promise recently given.\" \" My gratitude is too deep to be sparing in the display of my generosity with the instrument.\" \" I ask to be entrusted with the command of an expedition that has so noble a purpose as to deliver one of Spain's military heroes from cruel torture, having been delivered to it, after a glorious victory, by the treachery of one of your Majesty's trusted Generals.\" \" Stay, my son.

He was still to remain in the Royal House hold as a mark of esteem he had won from a Monarch, whom the Earl of Covertmoor, after a long and close intimacy, described as superior to the appreciation or reception of flattery, incapable of caprice, severe, yet just in the administration of that severity according to his judgment."], [112, "104 WON BY HONOUR. The King was honored and beloved by all of up right carriage, while he was dreaded and shunned by those who were double ; hence, had anything to conceal. He might truly be said to wield his sceptre with despotic sway where his high sense of rectitude saw complicity. After the Prince bad retired, their Majesties repaired at once to the Royal Chapel, where, after making the accustomed sign, they prostrated themselves upon the inlaid marble before the altar in the fulness of their gratitude. Together they pleaded in their authorized mode the protection of heaven for the sufferer from evil passions. When they arose the King took from the folds of his robe a sealed packet, sprinkled it with holy water, bowed the knee to the altar, ascended the steps, placing the packet at the foot of the crucifix. As the Royal Pair entered the Palace by their private door their Confessor came in from the cloister, where he had been saying his offices, as well as silently observing the actions of his August Communicants. Father Anspeth made his way eagerly to the crucifix, read with amazement and horror the inscription. He dare not remove it, and knew quite well what his Majesty would say in expiation of what the Reverend Father would call a sacrilege."], [113, "105 WON BY HONOUR. Half-an-hour later Father Anspeth received a summons to attend his Majesty in his chamber, He reluctantly complied, knowing he would be required to stay in the chapel to say prayers for an unworthy heretic. The Reverend Father's face was enshrined in cloud, while the King's was unusually blithe. He said \u2014 \" Of course, Father Anspeth, you are ready with your congratulations. You have heard the young Lieutenant still lives.\" \" I heard a rumour, but have been engaged all the afternoon in the confessional with the ladies of her Majesty's suite up to the time for my own offices.\" The King then repeated to the priest all that had transpired, without evoking the smallest particle of sympathy in the still, mobile breast of the Abbe. Then his Majesty said how he had laid the money on the altar to be consecrated for the erection of a monastery dedicated to |his patron saint in gratitude to God for the good. news. \"Impossible, your Majesty!\" cried Father Anspeth. \" By so doing you will insult the Church. A monastery to be built to commemorate the safety of this heretic ? \" \" Why not ? It is my will ; it shall be done ! \""], [114, "106 WON BY HONOUR. \" Your gracious Majesty made a grave error in offering the sword before stipulating conditions, which ought to have been the espousal of that religion your Majesty and the nation are devoted to \u2014 the only true one.

No, Father Anspeth, I am a Catholic to the core of my heart. I would not have yielded my religion for a sword ; no, rather should my life have paid the price. Antone Derritt would have acted thus. He is a man of unblemished truth and honor, a faithful patriot, and a brave servant of the country of his adoption. I will be just to him. Our religion may collide. It matters not what shape my gratitude takes ; heaven is not as narrow as those who serve under its banners. We will found a Home for the orphans of military men, calling it ' The Derritt Charity.' \" The priest cared not for the compact, but was far too politic to protest further. It was not like the King to yield where he believed himself just. In a tone of a sharp, cutting order he said \u2014 \" I will not desire you to say prayers for the safety of this heretic. I will stand charged with"], [115, "107 WON BY HONOUR. a sin heaven alone can absolve.

The Queen laid prostrate before her altar in her dressing-room. The former repaired after an hour to his son's bedside ; there the Queen had preceded him. The boy was dreaming, and in words of fervor en treated his father not to suffer his trust in his word to be shaken. \"Neither shall it, my son,\" said the fond father. \" I will trust in God.\" He raised the boy, and clasped him to his throbbing breast, while the Queen uttered a low moan of pain. \" What is that, father? Your words make me glad for myself, yet I fear they mean sorrow to you, my Royal Parents.\" \"Your mother is prostrate with anguish. You are right, and we shall have reason to rejoice in a son who can follow where duty calls.

At early dawn the King was in his audience chamber, signing the document drafted out the previous night, under his instructions, by the officer who undertook this branch of honorable function, for the liberation of General Amazion. Few men knew the art of pointing disgrace, when merited, with biting anguish than did his Majesty, while none could rival him in the grace ful acknowledgment of genuine worth. Men who failed through lack of irrepressible zeal were this Monarch's aversion. It was not from this cause the prisoner came under Royal displeasure, but for instigating and abetting two young noblemen to settle a difference at the point of the sword.

His Majesty took the occasion to convene an assemblage of the officers when he gave the charge to the astonished General Amazion of command under the youthful Prince, whose aide-de-camp he was appointed, in the expedition about to be sent out to the relief of an officer to whom the nation to a man owed a deep debt of gratitude for the true valor exhibited. Any Spaniard, affirmed the King, officer or private, who was envious of the renown he had justly won must go and excel in bravery the young Lieutenant, and he would make to himself a name of equal or superior merit. His Majesty appealed earnestly to General Amazion to wipe from his name the evil odor gathered around it from the dreadful mistake he made, which resulted in the death of a promising youth, for which he had suffered as an example. To secure the liberty of one whom all actuated by benevolence must admire, he was released. When the King presented the overwhelmed General with his sword and sabre the boy Prince stood by, his face aglow with a sympathy all could read.

Two hours after wards the King and Queen, mounted on snow-"], [119, "111 WON BY HONOUR. white palfreys, reviewed the troops on the eve of sailing. Amongst them was the gallant band who fought so bravely with the young Lieutenant in that fierce contest for the captured colors, taken by a grave error of judgment on the General's part, springing from burning jealousy. Antone led the small corps to victory, without waiting for the chary order of his Commanding Officer, the odds all against them. This turned the scale, gaining a victory where nothing but defeat and loss could be anticipated. This action of the Lieutenant's was not alto gether a subordinate one, but he was so incensed by the orders and counter-orders, transmitted in a way which gave the enemy a considerable advantage, crippling and dispiriting to all under his command. Antone fully meant to make an ample apology, but this was not permitted, for his return to camp was while his superior officer was dining^ after which he never suffered anyone to see him, only those he chose.

The rapturous praise that emanated from those not interrogated opened the eyes of their Majesties"], [120, "112 WON BY HONOUR. still more as to the strength of the animosity existing. A general murmur of some kind ran along the ranks. At length a young officer rode up to his Majesty, humbly craving to be heard for the de tachment about to embark. The King graciously granted permission for him to do so. With blushing hesitation Lieutenant Oletzy said \u2014 \"The several regiments about to sail at their Sovereign's command beg me to tender their loyal and humble gratitude for the honor be stowed in permitting them to go to the rescue of the bravest and noblest man who ever fought under the banner of an adopted nation, and to assure your Majesty that rather than return without Lieutenant Derritt, the privates' friend, they would perish on the field. These sentiments were held by every man who had fought by the noble officer's side. Had it not been for his valor, upon his own responsibility, defeat was sure. Few if any would have lived to bring back to Spain and her just Monarch the truth.\" The arrival of the Royal youthful Commander in his gorgeous military attire, mounted on a magni ficent charger, attended by his proud aide-de-camp, and mute page, whose beaming face needed no"], [121, "113 WON BY HONOUR. interpreter to make its joy known, with no in considerable or insignificant staff.

With such regiments, men actuated by love and sympathy for a brave sufferer for his adopted country, victory is sure. I am proud to command these fellows because they have accorded to a foreigner his valor justly won, and that without grudging.\" The Queen smiled proudly on the Regal and beautiful youth, yet in it was a vein of melancholy too deep to be concealed altogether. The Koyal youth now put the troops through a severe exercise, astonishing his Majesty at the science and skill he displayed in martial lore. It was evident that the troops had both pride and con fidence in the ability of their youthful Regal Com mander. The King could not fail to realize in the present an unusually bright augury for the future of his son. Still, it was natural the father's heart should palpitate for the safety of the boy General, fearless and fired by a noble ambition doing credit to men three times his age or more.

The Abbey possessed many charms \u2014 its large lake, fine groves, mossy slopes, were all deservedly renowned. Still the Earl had never stayed a night there since the death of Lady Vivian, over eighteen years previous. It was late spring. The soft sylvan beauty of the landscape was peculiarly adapted to soothe Lord Covertmoor's distracted and unhinged mind. Dr. Crait urged the necessity for entire change, in fact, a removal from all annoyance, and declared were this not effected, exhausted nature must succumb to undue pressure. He proposed Florence or Naples ; it mattered little so long as the Earl could be removed from the range and knowledge of the plots, that could do no other than annoy and create a feeling of in stinctive dread. Though Dr. Crait knew it not, Lord Erskept's wicked plots had not half the weight with Lord Covertmoor as had the inexplicable silence of the King of Spain, to whom his lordship had written numbers of times and received no reply whatever,"], [125, "117 WON BY HONOUR. added to that Antone's own. He said to his faithful servant after the doctor had gone \u2014 \" I shall spend this afternoon in Lady Vivian's bower. I shall go immediately after luncheon. Do relax your watch, my faithful friend; it is telling sorely upon you. Erskept is safe to do his will sooner or later. I should not care one iota, for death by violence has lost its terror from repeated expectancy, but I have an inordinate longing to hear from dear 'Tone ; his safety and silence are a dire worry.\" \" It seems to me, my lord, it is not difficult to explain that. Is not Lord Erskept a cunning villain, and black enough to arrest correspond ence that comes between himself and the success of his vile schemes ? The King is doubtless wondering at your indifference.\" \"That is impossible, Ruthven. It is a matter of too serious a moment to intercept or tamper with letters.\" \" If you overlook one crime, my lord, because the villain happens to be a son of a beloved sister, he knows you will wink at greater.\" \" Do not say so. I neither wink nor connive at vice.\" \" Not as you mean it ; but still it amounts to the same. You are the victim of sin, not the"], [126, "118 WON BY HONOUR. sinner. Our guest had more to do with Lord Erskept's vile plot than you suppose. He is over modest. I believe him to be of more consequence than he assumes. Who is he ? As free from airs as is possible to conceive, yet he carries dignity with him undoubtedly. Let us move secretly, then write and explain all to his Majesty, my dear master ; then you will hear of Mr. Antone.\" \" In a week or two, Ruthven ; I cannot leave here yet \u2014 not with my present resolution. The Abbey is charming now ; I never felt its spell so potent before.\" \" It will then be too late, my lord, I fear.\" \" My poor 'Tone ! I am persuaded he has fallen into the hands of the insurgents through treachery. Why I should fancy so I know not. To know him safe is all I desire ; then let the assassin do his worst. Ruthven, if you have any regard for me never raise your hand to take the life of poor Lady Hyacinth's son. Who fired the shot that night \u2014 it might have been his death \u2014 I wonder ; not you, I hope ? \" The old man colored crimson. He could not tell a lie, so replied \u2014 \" There was a choice of two tragic events \u2014 the villain, without a doubt, would have buried his dagger in your heart. No, not if I knew it, and"], [127, "119 WON BY HONOUR. could turn the torture upon him who richly merits it.\" \" I know you cannot feel as I do ; our stand points are widely different.\" \" He has nearly effected his purpose within this week by poison ; that would serve his end admirably. Yet while I live he shall be check mated.\" \" Go off duty while I am in Lady Vivian's bower. You are growing quite a shadowy being amid these endless worries.\" \" I must confess rest is necessary to all con cerned, my lord, but even there you will need more vigilance. Have you your whistle and revolver ? \" \" The latter is useless where I am concerned.\" Lord Covertmoor bent his course through the picturesque gardens on to the margin of the lake, loosened a magnificent, fleet little craft, with as dainty a pair of skulls as could well be made. \" The Vivian \" had never been used since she who owned it died, but was as fresh and beautiful as though she were daily expected.

Sure that if treachery stalked in his camp, side by side was fidelity ; to discern between the two was not easy, for appear ances often mislead. The skiff rapidly shot towards the richly wooded bank, where steps in the turf marked the ascent. As he trod them, back came to his recollection numberless actions of the beautiful life once so closely entwined with his. He had gone a very few steps when he remembered how his darling used to open the box of the boat and possess herself of the bower keys. He returned for them ; with them was a pair of sculling gloves of white buckskin \u2014 a tear dropped upon them. The Earl had never had the courage to visit the bower since. As he entered he was forcibly struck by the spotless preservation of the whole, fresh as though just from the hand of the upholsterer. The rich blue velvet unfaded ; the delicate slippers just as though she left them there the day before, while eighteen years or more had rolled away. The table was laid for tea with her own choice Sevres china. Near the chair she occupied was that of a child ; a tiny blue silk sock and a little blue kid boot laid on the floor, a natural and"], [129, "121 WON BY HONOUR. elegant breach of order. Into Lord Covertmoor's heart flowed a gentle current of delicious memories. With that of his wife's was coupled subtly the recollection of what Antone said, namely \u2014 \" The possession of such a rich treasure as Lady Vivian was in itself sufficient to make a life full and happy, however brief the period of enjoy ment.\" Full well the Earl remembered the last after noon when her ladyship surpassed herself by her brilliant sallies of sparkling wit. Her tenderness to him, at all times peculiarly attractive, was on this occasion sublimized. Iudeed, she was the prototype of wife and mother. By her side sat the little Cuthbert, scarcely two years old, in his mirth, for she sported with him. He kicked from his tiny foot the little mementoes still there. The Earl knew not who tended the bower, but was sure some vigilant hand. A knock at the door startled him. Ere he could speak the door was softly opened. Before him stood an aged widow. Her face was dimly shadowed amongst past memories. In her gentle visage reverence predominated. Silently she placed the massive silver teapot before the Earl, with a few delicate slices of bread and butter and another plate of"], [130, "122 WON BY HONOUR. cake. She withdrew without a word. She knew that was the first time the sorrowing husband had visited his wife's favorite bower. Lord Covertmoor rose, opened the door ; possibly excess of painful recollections made him faint. His eye rested upon her harp in the further corner. Back to his memory rushed her last words ere she put on her jaunty little boating cap and stood holding the hand of little Cuthbert in the door way. \" I must give my last look, dear Chantry, at this sweet bower. Few wives have known so much bliss, far more worthy than I. Why should I have an undue share ? \" The Earl rose, kissed the parted lips, and re plied \u2014 \" Vivian, my beloved, say not for the last time. You are but one week of attaining your majority. I never saw you more blooming and lovely. If you go, how could I linger here ? \" \" Not for our darling, sweet spouse ? You must linger; something tells me he, like his mother, will not outlive her age.\" The Earl's reverie was at once cut short by the door being thrust open by three wild, squalid children. Their faces were thin, but the contour of them made Lord Covertmoor start as a thought"], [131, "123 WON BY HONOUR. presented itself. In their rear stood a woman ; at a glance she bore the marks of high breeding. She was not more than twenty-seven, though grief had added ten upon those due to her. She had certainly been strikingly handsome. About her mouth were hard lines ; no tear dimmed her eye. Her voice was a contradiction to the stern look she wore. She said \u2014 \" I ought to ask your forgiveness for coming to the bower of your beautiful Countess on your first and only visit. I must confess I chose this opportunity hoping to find you softened by the gentle spirit of her who hovers nigh.\" \"Come in,\" said the Earl. \"Sorrow levels all barriers. I see you are in trouble.\" \" There is no social barrier severing us, save that impassable gulf separating rich from poor. I am as well born as you and one of your keith. We are fellow sufferers, though mine is by far the harder lot, you must own.\" \"May I ask who you are? I was not aware any of my keith endured such hardships and absolute want.\" \" It ought not to be. I am the wretched wife of your enemy, Lord Erskept. Children, go with out,\" sternly said the mother. Their eyes mean while set upon the untasted viands."], [132, "124 WON BY HONOUR. \"Stay,\" said the Earl, \"let me divide this amongst them.\" \" There is no time ; they must suffer until exertion raises them into happier soil.\" They did not obey, so without delay she angrily turned them out. While doing so she revealed to the Earl that she carried at her belt an unsheathed dagger and a loaded revolver. As she again entered a deep blush mantled her brow. Advancing addressed the Earl thus \u2014 \" Low as I am sunk by association with vice and villainy, I honor you. I came not to speak of myself and my woes, but to urge you to flee from here lest this sacred bower should be stained by murder, and the pure memory of Lady Hyacinth be covered with shame, while I should be the widow of a murderer, and my poor children branded as I am.\" Her frame shook violently as she knelt and pleaded with the Earl, begging of him to flee ere it be too late. She told how day and night she dogged her husband's steps to prevent, if possible, the execution of his diabolical purposes. She gave Lord Covertmoor abundant proof of the cruelty her husband had perpetrated in her family. Lady Udrith's sigh wrought more than her entreaties. He said \u2014"], [133, "125 WON BY HONOUR. \" I have arranged to go away two weeks hence.\" \" For the love of heaven, and as you cherish mercy, go now. Erskept is near. I fear you have delayed too long, and we are undone, ray children blighted.\" \"I will leave to-night if you will follow my wishes. Leave to-night for Normandy \u2014 Chateau le Blain. Here is a paper which will give you right of possession. Here are two cheques. I will send an order by my steward likewise. These cheques will be sufficient to meet your necessities. The estate will be all sufficient afterwards. It shall be secured to you for life.\" Ghastly white Lady Udrith became as she thanked her benefactor, and begged him to make its possession impossible to her husband. The Earl assured her it should be secured closely to her in order to save herself from annoyance. She must keep her banishment strictly private thus to secure a tranquil life, happiness she could never look for. \" Have you heard, Lord Covertmoor, of Antone ? His destruction as well as yours is decreed ; his present sufferings are from the same hand, under cover.\" \"No! would to heaven I could. Who is he that Erskept plots against him?\""], [134, "126 WON BY HONOUR. \" You cannot mean you took him to your heart, to sit where the noble Cuthbert sat, without knowing? You are a wondi-ous mixture if you can stand by and see the murder of a son without bringing to justice the man because he is your lovely sister's son.\" A terrible scream rent the air. Udrith said, in bitter tones \u2014 \" You would not be warned. Go, I will do my best.\" Scuffling without made the Earl's exit through the back entrance possible. Ruthven and Cumnor drew near, and whispered \u2014 \" Haste ; while she pursues, escape is pos sible.\" Outside Lady Vivian's bower laid the corpse of the second boy, Antone. The Earl was forcibly struck by the child's resemblance in death to Antone. That the child of the shameless villain should bear any likeness to his beloved one could not be suffered to dwell upon the Earl's mind. \" Do not linger, I implore you, for heaven's sake, my lord. What are you going to do ? \" Lord Covertmoor stooped and tenderly raised the sleeping little one. \"Take it with me,\" replied the nobleman, softly."], [135, "127 WON BY HONOUR. \" You take the son of a murderer.

Would she not rather bury him herself?\" \"And so she shall. She has promised to sail for Normandy to-night with her children.

If she is not there I can place it so that her eye will be sure to rest upon it.\" \" Happy thought, boy.\" The Earl wrote, \" Keep your promise. At the shore the body of your child shall meet you.\" Cumnor departed. The Earl still lingered, until Ruthven reminded him that Cumnor would come back by the cliff, and probably reach the Abbey first. The youth hid awhile behind a shrub, for where the boy recently laid there stood his father. Cumnor saw him stoop and pick up something lying near, over which he evidently chuckled in mirth. He thrust it into his pocket and went in the direction of the Abbey. Ere many moments had elapsed the mother appeared white as a ghost. Her dress was tattered, and from her left arm blood flowed copiously. She heeded not, it but gazed frantically around, crying in anguish \u2014 \" Where has he taken my child, my faithful little Antone ? \" \" Is it the lady who came to my lord ? \" asked Cumnor, softly. \" The same ! Speak, in mercy speak ! I am Lady Udrith.\" K"], [138, "130 WON BY HONOUR. \" My master, the Earl, reverently carried away the dead. This will give you his plans.\" The two children stood trembling with fright by her side, while she asked, in fear \u2014 \" Did you see anyone stop here ? I have lost one of the cheques your master gave me.\" \" I saw Lord Erskept, my lady, pick up a piece of paper laying on the turf not far from where the boy laid.\" \" How careless. In my grief I knew not what I was doing. It is far the larger of the two. Which way did Lord Erskept take ?

See, near you is a pool of blood, and you have only been there a few moments.\" \" I know it, and grow weaker. The poor children .\" She sank by them in a deep swoon. Cumnor took her handkerchief and dipped it in the spring near the bower and bathed her face, while the little girl did all in her power to recall her parent. Shortly Lady sJdrith regained consciousness, looked in surprise, and said \u2014 \" You here still ? It is kind ; but your master's life is more valuable than mine. He must leave"], [139, "WON BY HONOUR. 131 the Abbey to-night. Do all in your power to effect this.\" She attempted to rise, but falling back ex hausted, said \u2014 \" What is this ? Surely not death ? \" \" No, dear lady ; weakness.\" At that moment, to the youth's delight, the widow appeared in the gateway of the bower, her eyes fixed upon the two places where blood stood. She turned to look inside the bower, closed the door, then asked of Cumnor as to the safety of his lord. The youth briefly told her the story, and entrusted the lady to her care. The whole was new to the widow, and for the moment dazed her with its improbable horrors ; but, on Cumnor's repeated assurance, she realized it as true. The youth fled rapidly along the cliff to the Abbey. Alone, Lady Udrith inquired of the widow if she were an old retainer of the Covertmoors, as she was surrounded by enemies, hence must be cautious. \"You may rely upon me, madam. I nursed the beautiful Countess when a babe, and anyone she would shield I would give my life for.\" \" I am a niece of the Earl's.\""], [140, "132 WON BY HONOUR. She then told her story, but before it was done she succumbed to her weakness. Shortly Dr. Crait was in attendance, and by lies made aware of the needs be for removal. He gave his con sent, so three hours after a carriage stopped before Hill Lodge, where Mrs. Maurice lived. In it was a small velvet coffin, which con tained the remains of the little Antone. A sealed packet was clasped in the little hand, addressed to the mother, supplying the lack which the lost cheque made. It was autumn. The foliage wore its gorgeous display of tints, encircled by mellow, shadowy tones. The tightly closed casements, both at the Abbey and the Court, showed the Earl still away. No flag had been flying from the elevated post on the rampart for many months. Noise prevailed; workmen carried on their busy avocation under direction of architect and steward. Many were the speculations made as to the occasion of his lordship's strange whim, even by the very men who were thus saved from starvation. Such is the contradictory order of human nature, recoiling slander on the very hand ad ministering timely aid. For a time it seemed Lord Erskept was silent."], [141, "WON BY HONOUR. 133 Possibly he had not discovered Lord Covertmoor's whereabouts, as great pains had been taken to procure privacy. Before the Chateau le Blain paced a woman, her hands as white as the drifted snow, her cheeks, if possible, still whiter. By her side walked a child of scarcely five, the folds of her heavy black frock contrasting markedly with the waving masses of golden hair that fell around the beautiful shapely shoulders to her waist. The tiny face was pinched and ghostly white. She gazed from time to time at a cross of white exotics her mother held listlessly, as she paced mechanically the broad terrace in front of the Chateau, a charming little home. An exquisitely soft, childish voice, too melan choly for an infant, asked \u2014 \" Mother, will not these flowers wither before to-morrow if you do not lay them on Antone's tomb ? 'Tone, dear 'Tone, will not see them ; he must return ere the door shuts.\" \"What door, Vivian, darling?\" mechanically asked the parent. \" See, mother, that in the far west ?

As she neared the tomb, she murmured \u2014 \"Antone, my idol ! you can never come to me, but I can go to you.\" She knelt while Vivian clung to her neck. She laid the cross on the inscription that had been engraven on one other tablet, that of flesh. It was quite dusk in the vault. Tbe mother softly ejaculated \u2014 \" Kind heaven, how long will ye tarry ? \" \"Not yet, mother ; forget not your poor Vivian.\" Over their head was heard a fiendish yell, fol lowed by a laugh. Then came these words, in a voice like Lord Erskept's \u2014 \" If she dies it will be as Antone did, and by my hand. I mean her life should be the sequel to yours.\" i> \" Oh, why did Antone die, who was so good, and Erskept live?

The Spanish dominions in the new world were hemmed around by races of natives, driven back further inland, but who did their utmost to en croach, and get their foothold on some of the fine forests, where in the past they used to chase their wild prey to their joy and delight. These barbarous foes were even more harassing than civilized ones, though they had no trained corps. Still they had considerable skill in rude warfare, mustering strong contingents suffi ciently powerful to destroy much property, and render the lives of those on the borderland per fectly wretched. It was to put an end to these continuous raids the King sent the expedition, Lieutenant Derritt being one of the band.

What little was effected by that expedition could justly be put to the score of the gallant young officer in a crippled and unauthorized position. The King, when he recalled the troops, was fully aware the woik was scarcely begun. Before the dispatch of the party to effect the release of the Lieutenant, news reached the Monarch privately of the seething under- current already at work. This shrewd Sovereign knew full well before much good could be hoped for the enemy must be greatly humbled, their ranks thinned, while they must be taught science had achieved much towards rendering warfare terrible, and the contest with these competitors unequal. Four days after the departure of the troops news arrived of a barbarous attack of the insur gents, where no less than four populous villages were utterly sacked and burned, while the in habitants were cruelly murdered, few escaping to tell the tale of barbarity. This made the King tremble for the life of the gallant young Englishman. Little did he know that to his nationality he greatly owed his pre servation. The insurgents hated a Spaniard. They held to the belief that the English would"], [145, "137 WON BY HONOUR. have left them to the undisturbed possession of their own rights ; the lands they still had were secured to them by the power of that great nation. Hence Antone's life was spared to a torture far more cruel than death. The King at once despatched three more picked regiments under the command of an able colonel, of whose integrity he had sure grounds of trust. Before the arrival of the first detachment, em boldened by the quiet, they pressed further into the country, plundering and laying low all before them, spreading terror far and wide, then retreat ing into their own wild regions to recruit. It was in one of these sequestered settlements stood their old and powerful fortress, now fallen into partial disuse. Its look of abandonment they supposed would secure the prisoner's safety. It was to this cold, bleak place Antone Derritt was taken, and held in a hard, cruel bondage. The place, during his confinement, had undergone considerable repairs in the interior to render it capable of a lengthy siege.

Twelve men armed as sentinels patroled within its cloistered enclosures. These were relieved every"], [146, "138 WON BY HONOUR. three hours, so that their vigilance should never be overtaxed. In the interior dwelt the brutal chief of the tribes. It is impossible to conceive in human shape a more diabolical embodiment, coarse, cruel, cold-blooded, and vindictive. This was the man who devised day by day new tortures for his captive. Antone was alone, yet he was aware from groans he was not the only sufferer under the cruel clutches of this barbarous chief. Lieutenant Derritt had plotted and planned vigilantly for his own escape. Unable to find the key of solution to remove a single manacle, his fate was almost hopeless. So singular and subtle were their contrivances, they defied the energy and skill of a clever mechanist working for dear life. The dungeon where he was confined was damp, foul, and loathsome. Antone's limbs were the prey to rheumatism, together with the anguish of ponderous manacles. The waves of the southern ocean washed against the outer walls of the fortress with a ceaseless monotone that almost drove Antone to distraction. He employed himself in carving in the block of wood which served as table, bed, and general purposes ; a poem he had composed with two fingers and his penknife. He was surprised, while thus employed, one day by feeling warm breath upon his cheek."], [147, "139 WON BY HONOUR. He turned cautiously after concealing his simple tools. Two boys stood behind him so much alike, identity seemed impossible. Their black eyes, with their general contour, betrayed their nationality as undoubtedly Spanish. For aught Antone knew they might be emissaries of his wily captor. He remained silent and so did they. At length he caught sight of an open trap door in the corner of his dungeon floor. He was sure now they came from below. Sur prised into a lack of politic caution he pointed to it, and asked if they came through it. They simultaneously pointed to their mouths and ears, looking mournfully at him. One of the two pulled out some paper and a pencil, writing in bold characters that they were friendly towards him and desired to aid, but fearing detection and the chief they would go now and return. Oudenwhoky was away hunting. The other boy tasted Antone's porridge, ate a morsel of black bread with a wry face, then hastily and noiselessly departed, leaving behind them a sketch of their own history. Antone read it imm edia tely, hungering for some thing differing from the diet of reflection.

Tac, a neighbouring chief, the description of their adventurous escape from Rac Fortress, the safer refuge they secured in the smugglers' cave, how they sustained themselves there, etc. Possibly the part that interested Antone most was how they had again and again aided captives to escape. Their words told how they longed to liberate the sufferers, and bring destruction on the chief and the fortress, though it was their kindly shelter. On a small piece of paper they desired to know if Antone was the English officer surrendered to the chief by the Spanish General's treachery. Further asked if he were so great a favourite of a powerful Sovereign, why was he thus abandoned ? They promised food by night and to devise some succour. They fulfilled far more than promised ; the rankling wounds, festering under the shackles, were healed; two tempting meals a day did away with the necessity to eat what was provided. That food was wisely concealed. Antone wrote that part of his history concern ing his present exigency. On their next visit they left the plan they had concerted to try to effect his liberation.

From thence try to gain an audience with the King, armed with documents the captive was to provide, to assure his Majesty, without doubt, of their truth. Happily for the Lieutenant he had retained his crest of the cross-swords, Ritzlej procured a light and wax from the smugglers' stores. He departed with the blessing of his brother and Antone. Good fortune smiled upon him. The first vessel he approached the carpenter was ill ; he was just what was being sought for.

Two months after this incident Rozley informed his charge, whom he had tended diligently, that he had found a piece of paper fastened to a stump which contained significant news \u2014 a warning to pirate vessels that they must not be sighted, as a royal squadron was expected to quarter in the bay shortly, of no insignificant character.

A gesticulation of Ritzley made his brother seize his hand and lead him to the vessel's edge. The joy of the former was so wild, he appeared as though he took a leap.

To their surprise he was looking up lovingly into the face of a young man who appeared hardly able to endure the fatigue of standing to receive the joy and delight the little rescuers lavished upon him. It was the Lieutenant, but so altered that the remnant of the brave band who supported him in his charge and brilliant victory were a few moments before they could be sure he whom they saw was really their brave leader.

I command this expedition for your release; this cannot fail to show the esteem my Royal father holds you in to yield his only son to the hazard of such an enterprise.\" The Lieutenant, still in his prison garb, bearing the scars of his manacle wounds, knelt and kissed the extended hand of his Royal patron, and re plied \u2014 \"Brave son of a noble sire, I, your humble subject, can only repay such a mark of your Royal condescension by valor in the cause of the nation I am proud to serve, and cherish the honor of fighting under the banner of such a Gracious and Just Monarch.\" \" Be seated,\" said the Prince ; \" indeed, you must have the services of tbe physician who is of our suite.\""], [155, "WON BY HONOUR. 147 \" Has the King sent this noble host to effec tually quell the insurgents ?

News of these outrages may have by this reached his Majesty. Probably we may shortly receive a despatch. The work we came to do has been done by this noble pair.

On my right hand stands the regiment of honor, who, I doubt not, will have to-day the delightful surprise of welcoming their new Colonel.\" The Prince touched the officer's head with his richly-jewelled sword, then said \u2014 \" Are you quite sure, Colonel Derritt, you are able for active service ? Before we suffer this our Royal physician must be consulted.\" \" What I have lost in appearance I have gained in valor. This reign of terror shall cease ; no longer shall the innocent of this lovely country suffer violence by the hands of the miscreants. These brutal ruffians shall be humbled, if not exterminated. To-night, under your Royal com mand and pleasure, we will lay in ashes the fortress where so many have suffered and suc cumbed to cruelty, while others have hailed death as a boon to free them from torture wholly un supportable.\" \" We must first be satisfied, Colonel, that you are in battle order.\" At the fortress consternation reigned as the rumor was confirmed of the escape of the captive. The Governor sent out several bands of armed men in hot pursuit, was himself savagely angry for showing any supposed clemency, regretting he had not made sure of so formidable an enemy by death at once."], [157, "149 WON BY HONOUR. One of these scouring parties discovered the fleet lying at anchor in the bay ; yet it never entered into the calculation of their leader that their captive might be secure there. While the several bands were in pursuit of their lost prisoner he was leading his gallant regiment to the fortress, insufficiently guarded, for some of the staff had accompanied the Governor to enlist the sympathy and aid of the surrounding tribes. Those who were left on guard fought valiantly in defence of their stronghold, but were obliged to surrender to captivity, while no time was lost in the search of the dungeons, and the liberation of the poor, down-trodden victims of brutality. The fine old fortress was ere long enveloped in flames, which ascended high. When it was hope lessly the victim of the ravages of this fearful element, the Colonel and his regiment returned to their vessels, bringing with them the rescued victims of brutal tyranny. Several of the bands of insurgents were returning from their fruitless search. They were attracted by the lurid glare in the heavens. The night was densely dark ; it was not until they came near they found to their horror their fortress had not only been discovered, but invaded, sacked, and burned. A low wail of anguish. Their nearest strong-"], [158, "150 WON BY HONOUR. hold was miles away. A loud report conveyed the unwelcome tidings \u2014 the flames had reached their powder magazine. Consternation spread as they began to muster strong, and with it the wild cry for revenge. Throughout the night hostilities were in preparation. At day-break the two forces met. The Royal youthful General, mounted upon his coal-black charger, stood in the rear, giving his commands with intrepid coolness, encouraging his men with his own high hopes. Side by side a gallant old Colonel fought with a brave young officer ; the long grey beard of the former appeared to bristle with the electric current. His ardor savoured of youth, while his eagerness belonged rather to the impetuosity of the hey-day of life than noontide or evening. Furiously he rode to the charge, his voice encouraging his brave troops, while his example propelled them to valor and supernatural courage, showing the enemy, who were none the less in trepid, actuated by revenge. Nothing daunted the old Colonel attacked the enemy in their weakest points, harassing them by his unlooked for, yet skilful, tactics of warfare. The battle waged hot \u2014 both sides had lost heavily. It would have been difficult at that point to say on which side the scale of victory would turn."], [159, "151 WON BY HONOUR. Hotter grew the contest. At length the brave Colonel and his Royal regiment were completely hemmed in on all sides by the insurgents, who fought with desperation, aroused by a thirst for revenge. The intrepid valor of the old Colonel, in a position of cruel, harassing perplexity, could not be other than daunting, yet it was apparent he was unmoved by it, except it was a stimulus to put on an extra pressure and bring matters to a crisis. Perchance some word he uttered, or it might have been the indomitable courage in his keen blue eyes ; the men rallied and fought with un equalled bravery, which was soon apparent by the breach effected in the enemies' ranks on all sides. They still hemmed the gallant troop in, closing closer. Terrible moment! A spear was plunged into the charger on which the old Colonel sat. A soldier at his right hand fell. Quick as thought he freed himself from his stirrups and sprang with marvel lous agility into the saddle of the fallen man. The Royal Commander watched with bated breath while the furious conflict swayed evenly, as it appeared. It was otherwise \u2014 the enemies' loss was greater than could be discerned from a distance. A sudden and skilful ruse of warfare gave the gallant troop the advantage they needed to turn"], [160, "152 WON BY HONOUR. the scale. They made a move as though to fall back in the breach in the rear; instead they advanced with a desperate courage upon the stunned enemy, effectually routing them, and following their retreating forces, laying numbers low, leaving death and carnage on all sides. In the midst of the fight the Colonel heard Blue Tac say to the chief of the demolished fortress, speaking of himself, \" He fights like a fiend. It must be the captive's father \u2014 so like him \u2014 thirsting for revenge.\" No sooner had the words passed through his lips than a sword pinned the body of the cruel listener to the earth. Heartless monster \u2014 lie had his deserts ! Two tribes now advanced, endeavouring to retrieve the ruin so clearly discernible, muster ing under the command of Blue Tac. The Royal Blues, still to the fore, were now sustained by the force. A sharp, short attack was made in frenzied fury by the enemy, aware, as they must have been, of the serious nature of their loss, together with the weakened condition of their forces. The last encounter was attended by even more disastrous issues to the insurgents than the pre ceding ones. They were effectually routed and driven into a defile between two mountains. It was night-fall before the gallant Colonel,"], [161, "153 WON BY HONOUR. accompanied by his victorious troops, rode up to the bay. As the Royal Commander approached the grave officer he noticed the ghastly pallor of Antone's face, and said, tenderly \u2014 \" Alas ! I fear this victory will be dearly bought if it deprives Spain of one of her most heroic soldiers. What is this ? Your coat is steeped in blood. Fetch Shelley. Antone, give me your hand. Never did a more undaunted soldier lead troops to certain victory than you. You made my heart quail \u2014 hemmed in by dangers. Your charger slain under you at that critical moment. Your disguise saved you, undoubtedly \u2014 a happy hit of mine \u2014 for the enemy never suspected that you had strength to sit upon a saddle after months of cruel captivity.\" The Colonel made no reply, but sank fainting upon the neck of the charger, which was but recently that of the slain Sergeant. The Prince followed closely the litter upon which Antone was borne to a cabin reserved for him on the Invincible. The anxiety exhibited for the safety of the Colonel was of a nature to reveal the real respect he had won amongst all ranks of the army."], [162, "CHAPTER XIV. In the soft twilight of an autumn night, when darkness steals stealthily along, arrested in its reign by the young moon riding over all obstacles triumphantly into mid heaven, a party of visitors to a small village of exquisite beauty, wedged as it were in a piece of table-land anyone might easily imagine, had shot out of a fissure in the rocks, sheltering naturally, nay almost obscur ing, the tiny colony. There was undoubtedly an air of distinction with the veteran aristocrat carrying weight with the guides, the suite following in the rear. They started from the hotel barely an hour after their arrival. Haste marked their actions, for while refreshment was made ready, ponies and guides were procured for the furtherance of the evidently important mission for which they journeyed."], [163, "WON BY HONOUR. 155 The Count could learn very little of the village of Eglantine. The guides assured him it would recompense for any fatigue sustained. The ascent was both steep and rugged, besides two miles. The salubrious air and comparative peace enjoyed by Lord Covertmoor might have rein forced waning nature had it not been for the con tinued thought of uncertainty respecting the son of his adoption. Still the beauty and almost monastic seclusion of the Earl's life had the charm of novelty. The Shakedown, as the abode taken was termed, was charmingly picturesque, a waving mass of luxuriant tropical growths, the windows peep ing through tangled, graceful masses of creeping, flowering plants. The verandah that encircled the building was literally clad in a garniture of passion flower. The house was small as a cottage to either the Abbey or Court, hence the Earl's household was limited to a small staff. How ever Lord Covertmoor might have desired to entertain guests, it was impossible. On this particular evening he was reclining upon a couch under the shade of a prolific fig tree, where he had watched one of the most gorgeous sunsets he remembered ever to have seen. He looked very decidedly older ; on his placid coun-"], [164, "156 WON BY HONOUR. tenance lines of suppressed anxiety were visible. Ruthven and Cumnor sat under the verandah where they could see their master, and near enough to be by his side in a moment. The former wore evident traces of grave disquietude, while his eyes rolled restlessly. As he looked towards the sleeper, who said something loud enough to reach the ears of the younger, who looked horrified, and asked his colleague if he heard the ominous words of their master. As he did not, he repeated them. \"Yes, he will do the terrible deed to-night. Would to heaven I might be the only victim. Alas, the innocent share my melancholy lot.\" Just at the moment a party of equestrians entered the gate, and approached the inner one guarded by a lodge. The keeper was off duty at that hour. Their impatient knocking aroused the Earl, who said \u2014 \"That is Lord Erskept. He has found our retreat at last ; I knew he must.\" \" No, my lord, he comes not thus openly, villainy sneaks.\" \"I am sorry that knock awoke me, for Lady Vivian came to me, and beckoned me to follow her to an elysium my clay girt mind could not grasp.\" \" Ruthven,\" called a female voice."], [165, "157 WON BY HONOUR. \"What now, Mrs. Preston?\" replied the steward, \" nothing wrong, I trust? \" \"I cannot say. It is a messenger from the Court of Madrid, if the face of the bearer is to be relied upon. Well, there is good news in the rear for my lord.\" \"I will see him first. My lord is feebler than ever to-night.\" The Count who was the bearer of Antone's first dower of good fortune of a military order was now entrusted with the Royal mission to the Earl in his home in the mountains. Lord Covertmoor's recent pathetic appeal for tidings of this son of his adoption had staggered his Majesty, who had transmitted regular information, though he received no tidings from the Court. When the steward entered the room into which the Count had been shown he addressed him thus \u2014 \" Count Ghettzey, I presume, from the Court of Madrid.\" Ruthven had not forgotten the distinguished courtier, who replied \u2014 \" Yes ; you are, I remember, the Earl's personal attendant and confidential servant.

The Earl had already risen, and asked, anxiously \u2014 \" Good or evil tidings does Monsieur le Count bring ? \" \"The former, my lord. He awaits your presence in the library.\""], [167, "159 WON BY HONOUR. As the Earl entered the Count grew grave, dis mayed by a change he had not anticipated.

Suppose you divulge your mission under the canopy of ether.\" The two venerable men passed out by way of the verandah.

Your silence would have alienated many less just than King Ferdinand.\" \" Doubtless, while his gracious Majesty's silence to me has been as so many folds to my shroud, and yet the blame is elsewhere.

The only news reached me through the columns of a paper, which recorded his victory and mysterious disappearance in the same article.\" \" I wish you had sent a servant to the Court of Madrid, my lord ; it would have saved you much suffering.\" The Count then gave the King's auto graph letter. After the Earl had perused it"], [168, "160 WON BY HONOUR. he listened to the story of Antone's sufferings, wrongs, victories, and wounds. The Count wound up by an eulogy that the King had himself desired to be given as a token of esteem the young officer merited from the Monarch of his adopted country. \"You maybe surprised, noble Count, especially coming from the Court of Madrid, that a man of my years and experience took to my heart as a son a youth whose name and family I did not even know.\" \"I will not believe you guilty of so grave an indiscretion.\" \" It is true. I asked him for it after he had undoubtedly won my heart, and his conquest was achieved by honor. He refused all mercenary offers or gifts, and begged when I asked for his name that I would be satisfied with ' Antone,' assuring me that his only reason for withholding it was the dread it might snap asunder the brightest bond of his life. To this day, though I have cut off the entail, and gained Royal sanction for the title to go with the estate, I know no other name by which to call my heir than Antone.\" \" You are a strange pair,\" exclaimed the Count. \" Antone knew who you were, that he must.\""], [169, "WON BY HONOUR. 161 \" Yes, of course, but wealth had no charm to him.

I have heard of the remarkable sunrises of Eglantine. I have come prepared to see one, at least, and to test your hospitality, the renown of which more than one Spaniard has brought to our nation.\" The Earl looked towards Ruthven in the forlorn hope of aid. He was incapable of a breach of politeness, and replied \u2014 \" In happier days it was our wont, now it is anything but safe for us to offer hospitality, terribly allied to danger.\" \" I have no objections, Lord Covertmoor, to measure swords with your enemy ; should only be too delighted did the opportunity occur. You have heard of my fame as a swordsman, and also of the deadly aim I am reputed to have.\" \" Be cautious, noble Count. You are more than welcome. My reluctance springs from the impression that this night will be my last, and one of horror.\" The Earl turned towards Ruthven, saying \u2014 \" Are all the small gates fastened ? Precaution is useless, yet there is a sort of satisfaction for others in the fact that care was used.\""], [172, "164 WON BY HONOUR. \" Do you suppose the villain has found out this sequestered spot? I should say most unlikely. With a guide we found it was almost hopeless.\" The Earl smiled, then replied \u2014 \" So we may think ; time will test the truth of impressions that grow stronger with the hour. Dinner is ready, so Cushet announces. We are compelled to be rustic ; that you will observe.\" Over their wine the Earl inquired how the King derived his knowledge of Antone's family, his re lationship to himself, together with the cruelty of his own relations. The Count narrated the circumstance of the deaf and dumb boy, actually giving Antone's paper into his old nurse's hand, her discovery and joy, with its results. While the Count had a turn round the garden the Earl expressed his regret at tbe presence of visitors under existing circumstances to Ruthven, on the ground that his friend would exercise no mercy with the enemy. \" Neither should I, my lord. I deem he has already done much evil.\" \"Nevertheless, you would spare him for my sake, Ruthven ? \" asked his lordship. \" I would do much for you, my lord,\" replied the old man, but consider how much more evil he"], [173, "165 WON BY HONOUR. may do ? His hatred for me is second only to that he entertains for you.\" \" The Count is coming. Dismiss the thought of it, and bring two bottles of that glorious, sparkling vintage into the garden.\" The Count was no mean judge, and pronounced it incomparable. Together they smoked under the verandah. The air descended from the mountain heights, inflating the lungs as an elixir to life. The mingling of perfumes made the breeze odorous. The garden having an outer edge of myrtles, the blossoms with the dew laden, spread their aromas far and wide. On the left baud stood a fine grove of the stately magnolia. In this was the rustle of leaves, not as though disturbed by wind, but rather like someone rushing hastily through them. The Count started, rose to his feet, looking in the direction it came. He said \u2014 \" There is someone undoubtedly lurking \u2014 nay, skulking. I saw the cold glitter of steel.\" Turn ing to Cumnor he said, \"You are young and strong ; follow me.\" Lord Covertmoor laid upon the youth a detain ing hand. He was ghastly white, his lips colour less. He murmured \u2014"], [174, "166 WON BY HONOUR. \" For the love of heaven stay here, or you will be a dead man ! It is I whom he seeks. \" \" Why do you linger if you expect him ? \" \" Because it is inevitable if he can trace me here I cannot hide from him. My courage is not dead. No, rather does it meet its fate with increased calmness.\" \" Hush ! \" said the Count. \" I saw him then. I am sure it is the villain. How bold and fearless. Ere morning dawns he shall have either tasted the quality of my steel, or tested the surety of my bullets to reach their aim.\" \" Stay,\" said the Earl ; \" you are my guest. Only in self-defence will I have bloodshed.\" \" See, it was he who commenced the descent of the mountain. He must be an arrant coward if he dare not meet me.\" \" He is gone but to return and surprise us in an unwary moment,\" said Lord Covertmoor. \" Come, let us converse on a subject more worthy of our consideration.\" \" I am a true Spaniard, and enjoy a duel or an adventure with brigands, no matter how fierce, and can supplement, it with a sweet serenade to a fair damsel.

Stay, have I done wrong by being so bold as to proclaim ourselves on the shady side of life ? \" asked the Count. \" Mine needs no proclaiming ; it is evident. Antone endeavoured to show me that when present and future are obscured we should look back upon joys to be culled from retrospection.\" \"The General is a favourite of fortune, my lord. He has won early a harvest of golden opinions ; more than some of us have achieved in a long life.\" \" I shall never see Antone again. If only he arrives to lay me in the beautiful tomb he sketched. Stay, we will change the subject ; your dreams will be tinctured with horror.\" A quarter before eleven the Count left the Earl, whose mournful smile long lingered in memory.

Even tbe creaking of loose boards, or their slippers, made them start with nervous trepidation. As they neared the Count's room he came out to them, and begged if there were any perils in the night they would let him have the lion's share. He asked if the Earl had much money or jewels with him, to which the old steward gave a negative reply. \" Let me take your place for one night,\" asked the Count, \" such a life is enough to turn a man's brain.\" \"No, Count, I have had over twenty years of it, I will not forsake my post now.

His master's words arose to his memory. The Earl had already fallen into a troubled sleep before his attendants assumed their watch. Cumnor's sleep was remarkably light for youth, probably from the fear ever present. The Shakedown was silent as death ; the grim monster already awaited his prey. The old clock struck the midnight hour when footsteps slowly ascended the stairs. A minute more the wily assassin stood by the bed of his victim, glaring upon him. In his left hand he held a phial. The Earl opened his eyes, while the fiend whispered \u2014 \" You are in my power at last. To-morrow I shall be Earl of Covertmoor.\" The Earl gave one glance towards the door ; there was no fear in it. He hoped Ruthven would not put himself into the villain's power. In a loud voice, he said \u2014 \" Erskept, I forgive you.\" Ere the words had well passed his lips, linen, saturated with the deadly fluid, was pressed to them and the nostrils.

The victorious General is marked to fall.\" \" Your reckoning is nearer than you know.\" \" Take that,\" said Erskept, as he plunged the dagger up to the hilt into the old man's breast. The villain was too eager in his survey to notice the boy intent on flight. He reached the stair case, when he was brought to bay by the tall figure of the Count, who blocked the way. The coward fancied he saw a shadow in the rear. How to escape he knew not. Turning he was about to make a bolt through the lobby window. In the very act a double report sounded, followed by a crash. Lord Erskept was shot clean through the heart. \" How shall I obtain Lord Covertmoor's forgive ness ? \" said the Count. \"The villain has accomplished his double pur pose. My master is dead, and Ruthven too.\" \" Surely you are mistaken.\" They, followed by the affrighted servants, entered the chamber.

From that hour few remained in ignorance of the pastoral glades of Eglantine."], [180, "CHAPTER XV. The ghastly spectacle was too terrible for a man of the Count's calibre long to endure ; besides, stern necessity drove him at once to see the Earl's lawyer. Before leaving the Shakedown he gave orders for both bodies to be embalmed. After due preparation they would be removed to the Court. The paper Lord Erskept left behind in the Earl's chamber it was his intention to place immediately in the lawyer's hand. Strange as it may seem, Lady Erskept appeared to have been erased from her husband's memory. Since the night of her flight doubtless she had much delayed the accomplishing of his purpose. Lady Udrith had in contact with vice drawn in much of its subtle influence. Thus she used to deal with Erskept, her first-born, who was, without doubt, his father's son, a veritable Cain. The words of Lord Covertmoor were often brought to her recollection, namely, little peace would be"], [181, "173 WON BY HONOUR. hers. The boy, now fourteen, was a man in cunning and stratagem. He plotted to defeat his mother. His tutor he very nearly succeeded in poisoning; had it not been for the vigilance of the cook this plot would never have been dis covered. The little demon now endeavoured to take the life of his mother and sister. He had possibly both heard and seen his father's experi ments, and slyly possessed himself of some of the ingredients. The life led at the Chateau was much too still for this youth. He resolved to gain access to his mother's purse. She had wisely hidden her store in several places. To effect his purpose he entered Lady Udrith's room one night when she was asleep, and to secure time he placed to her nostrils the deadly fluid. It may be he did not intend to kill her outright. When he was sure it had taken effect, he took his mother's keys and what money he could find to aid him to join his father. This event happened three days before the Count reached Eglantine. The boy was watched by the nurse, a timorous woman, who possessed a terror of the lad, and feared for her own safety if she gave the alarm, suffered him to depart ere she made it known. Compassion for the woes of this wretched woman inspired her servants with"], [182, "174 WON BY HONOUR. pity rather than respect. How could they look up to a mistress who exhibited many traits, repul sive even to the mind of a servant. They forgot how necessity had driven her at first to the practice ; afterwards it became habitual. Lucevil, the nurse, did her utmost to arouse her mistress before the others arrived, and succeeded in awakening the little Vivian from her light slumber. The little girl, in a state of feverish excitement, entered her mother's room as she had left her cot. At length Torenta arrived. With her she ever brought a breezy, fussy atmosphere, peculiarly obnoxious to the little Vivian, who remonstrated at the violent way she shook her mistress, and requested that Dr. Caper should be immediately sent for. \" To be sure. What idiots we are ! \" said the housekeeper, \"though it is my belief, doctor or no doctor, she will never come to again. Bless me, death would be the first slice of good luck that ever yet fell to her lot.\" To Vivian's refined ear and loving heart these sentences fell as cold bullets of lead. She shivered and shrank in horror from the woman. She placed her burning cheek close to the cold one, which had often been blistered by scalding"], [183, "175 WON BY HONOUR. tears of sorrow \u2014 a not over amiable temper, acidulated by cruelty and tantalization. The doctor kindly and tenderly told little Vivian her mother was dead, withholding the cause. This she had already conjectured from the remarks made by the nurse. Vivian, an object but a few minutes before of solid grief, now became alert, self-possessed, and indefatigable. She demanded another opinion should be consulted as to the certainty of her parent's death. Dr. Caper knew Dr. Foley was near. A mes senger was despatched. Dr. Foley arrived first, and, without hesitation, pronounced the case hopeless, and said \u2014 \" The lady's friends ought immediately to be communicated with.\" \"I ana the only one now,\" replied Vivian, \"ex cept my uncle, the Earl of Covertmoor.

They ran thus \u2014 \" Deae Uncle, \" Tuesday night Erskept fulfilled the threat my father had so repeatedly made in our hearing"], [184, "176 WON BY HONOUR. that he would send our mother to a sleep from which there was no awakening. After committing this deadly sin he obtained money from her desk and escaped. I am alone, quite desolate. I have sent this to the Court in the hope you will receive it early. \" Your niece, \" Vivian.\" He to whom this letter was addressed never received it, for he too had died by the hand, of his keith. Vivian had heard of Antone, but she knew he was absent, and where she could not tell. The doctor told the child her mother's funeral must be on the fourth day at the latest. The little Vivian, who had been all absorbed with the actual sorrow and crime, was now roused to the necessity of exertion. She rose, and, with dignity beyond her years, said \u2014 \" I thank you much for your opinion. At present I must beg of you to wait for your fee. Either my uncle or his executors will discharge every debt contracted needful for my mother, since it is by his kind permission we reside here.\" Dr. Foley, really full of kindly interest for the child thus forced into the matured woman,"], [185, "WON BY HONOUR. 177 asked if he should endeavour to secure the sympathies of Lord Covertmoor's brother-in-law, who was a most considerate and humane indi vidual. The Countess was one who delighted in administering to the comfort of others. Vivian thanked him, but replied that circum stances she did not care to mention compelled her to wish to be alone in a grief impossible to be shared by others. The nature of her trial bade her use extreme delicacy in even accepting sym pathy, lest it cast a shadow upon the benevolent donor. The matured thought exhibited was so rare that both medical men stood in awe. Dr. Foley resolved he would do his utmost to secure this sorely-tried child the countenance of a friend in her own rank of life. The doctor requested to be allowed to execute some order for her relative to Lady Erskept's funeral. Vivian politely declined, telling him she could refer to an old and faithful domestic who shared their banishment. The child did not then know the sorrow pend ing.

Vivian asked to see Culvert. The domestics had not dared to disclose to the stricken girl the double murder until compelled. Vivian's head sank upon the cushion ; no tears came to her relief. Lucevil, though nervous, was faithful to those she served, really grieved for her young charge. She begged her to confide in her, which she did in a measure. The child said \u2014 \" I must look if Erskept took all mother's money; her secretaire is wide open.\" The girl moved mechanically until her eyes rested upon a sealed packet addressed to herself in Lady Udrith's handwriting. It was passing strange the cunning boy had not taken that likewise. The date was only the previous night. Her ladyship had there given full instructions to her little daughter. Some threat of the boy's on the previous day must have determined her to take this step, for she wrote thus \u2014 \" To-morrow my Vivian will be alone. My tragic death is only the prelude to a succession of horrors which will terrify the world. Bury me as we did Antone, my innocent child, and then begin"], [187, "WON BY HONOUR. 179 life afresh. Forget all of vice ; remember your mother in pity and love. Lord Covertmoor or his successor will be too noble to abandon an orphan, for such you soon must be.

He called at the Chateau, and was the bearer of keen sorrow to Lord Covert moor's brother-in-law, who left immediately for the Court, quite sure that the Earl would be laid side by side with his beloved Countess.

Vivian would have laid Culvert within the vault had not her maid remonstrated and told her such a step might give offence to her uncle's family, to whom the tomb belonged. Vivian yielded, and had a grave erected outside the barrier for her faithful friend. The subsequent day Vivian twined flowers for three wreaths. The first she took to the grave without, and knelt upon it with bursting heart. Her labour of love was not yet complete. With one in each hand she descended the marble steps of the vault within the chapel. She was startled ; someone had been before and laid wreaths far more elaborate than hers. Who could care here for them ? The first tear of gratitude fell upon the chaplets, as she murmured \u2014 \"None can tell what a comfort this is to me.\" She removed those to the head of each coffin, her own at the foot. \"How delicate and kind,\" said Vivian, never supposing the donor nigh. Over her shoulder came a soft voice \u2014 \" Nay, ours are for the feet \u2014 yours for the head, Vivian.\" The girl started and turned crimson as she found herself looked upon with tenderness by a girl five years her senior. By her side stood a tall, slight"], [189, "181 WON BY HONOUR. youth of seventeen. No single word of sympathy did they offer, as Vivian knelt and sobbed at the head of her mother's coffin. They followed her example, being assured into no ear save that of the Great Healer could the little one tell her grief. Vivian's face bore no shadow of guilt or shame, except that caused by contrition and humility. When she arose they were gone, but a card she found whereon these words were written \u2014 \" Vivian, for the sake of our aunt, whose name you bear, and for your own unsullied innocence, we share your grief deeply. \u2014 Angelina and Maurice, children of the brother of the late Countess of Covertmoor.\""], [190, "CHAPTER XVI. The wound received by Colonel Derritt proved more serious than appearance indicated. The physical condition to which he was reduced was not then sufficiently taken into consideration, and the risk run of going to battle in a state of weak ness positively dangerous. Nevertheless, he owed his recovery from the fever, which supervened, to his faultless physique, a blessing he \u2014 unlike his antecedents \u2014 had never abused or put to evil purpose. He was anxious to get back to the country of his adoption, anticipating a furlough, in which he might renew the pleasurable intercourse briefly enjoyed with his friend the Earl of Covertmoor, whose silence he could not comprehend, yet never for a moment did he suppose his friend capable of infidelity. Antone urged the return of the troops, declar ing he should be much benefited by the voyage."], [191, "WON BY HONOUR. 183 He had to be conveyed on a litter to the Invin cible. There was something peculiarly mournful asso ciated with victory to one of Antone's deep sensibility. He made the request he should be taken the route which led to the graves of those who had fought and fallen in the attainment of that glory which would secure for him a renown unsurpassed. Those who bore the gallant Colonel, at his request, halted before the spot thus made sacred. The tears that flowed unrestrained from Antone's eyes did honor to his manhood, endeared him to the hearts of those who survived the severe struggle for supremacy, and collected round the huge grave uncovered. The Prince, mounted on the coal-black charger, rode forward and said \u2014 \" All honor to the memory of the victorious, valiant soldiers who repose here. Colonel Derritt, their brave leader, is not yet out of danger. Emotion, however noble and befitting, is, to say tbe least, hazardous.\" He then gave command to the bearers to pass along, adding, \" Masses would be said in the churches for the repose of their souls,\" his eye meanwhile resting on the young Englishman, whose whole life was a Psalm, and his every"], [192, "184 WON BY HONOUR. breath a prayer. Antone's words were few on these vital matters, but his actions were all placed before a tribunal, to be judged ere they were accounted pure. No man had ever heard the young officer speak of religion in relationship to the personal, while the primary principles, in all their purity, permeated his soul and blossomed in the most unobtrusive form continually in his daily career. The Prince knew his father's opinion, therefore watched the Colonel with a keen eye, in the ex pectancy of finding something which might con trovert the King's declaration. As yet the consis tency and honor of the young man had no single blur to tarnish its brilliancy, while Antone recorded triumph as the recompense given to stimulate to renewed fervour in an upright course. The voyage proved beneficial to the wounded ; it had the desired effect on the youthful warrior, who spent much time in converse with the young Royal Commander, who frequently endeavoured to extract from the Colonel his views respecting the Supreme Disposer of Creation, together with the manifold ways the creature renders homage. \" What is religion ? \" asked the Prince, after many and fruitless attempts to make his officer"], [193, "185 WON BY HONOUR. give out his views, General Amazion watching with critical amusement. \"From my aspect,\" replied Antone, calmly, \"it is an inward germ of the Divine, regenerator \u25a0capable of perfect growth. The fruits test into what soil the germ was deposited.\" Here was nothing to arouse controversy, but rather to give food for reflection. \" The King is sure to give you an extended furlough,\" said the Prince ; \" I can fancy how delighted the Earl will be.\" It was night \u2014 they sat, as was their wont, on deck. The sky was one expanse of deep azure, here and there a silver-fleecy cloud ; the moon, crossing them, multiplied \u2014 or rather appeared to do \u2014 their number, surrounded and attended by myriads of blossoms in the solar meadows, varying in colour, size, and light. Antone was unusually grave. The Prince asked the cause of it. He replied that, strangely enough, he could think of nothing but the villain who had made several attempts upon the Earl's life. \"You have not surely seen the ghastly phantom said to appear to your family as a precursor of death ! \" asked the Royal youth. \" Who told your Royal Highness there was such a legend ?

How so ? \" \"You are the youngest son of the Earl of Gortzey, who married the lovely Lady Hyacinth, sister of the Earl of Covertmoor, so you must be the Earl's nephew.\" \" Does he know it, Prince Ferdinand ? \" \" I believe not. But, Antone, the King may, with his permission, one day show you how they negotiated for Spain to adopt you. Of one thing rest satisfied ; no father ever loved a son more than the Earl you.

I felt the very same gloomy influence from Ghoul's dark wing on the very night the Earl was shot. Pardon me, I am presuming on your Royal and Gracious condescen sion.\" \" No ! I confess to being greatly interested in your romantic and weird history.\" The night previous to landing Antone stood"], [195, "WON BY HONOUR. 187 gloomily looking into space, at the stern of the vessel. The Prince's eyes were upon him ; he directed those of his aide-de-camp thus \u2014 \" See, Amazion, is there not a dark outline in the rear of young Derritt ? Cannot you see it ? I do clearly.\" \" Yes, there is a figure, scarcely like a man, and yet one in detail. The Colonel is not aware of its near presence. What can it be, positively glanc ing over his shoulder? \" \" Report says it comes prior to a death in that family. See, he has turned and faced it, while it slowly recedes he comes this way leisurely. It will be better to make no mention of it without he does.\" Instead of Antone's coming on the upper deck, he paced the lower sadly until the Prince dis patched the General to fetch him. Then he said \u2014 \" A few more hours at most, and we receive our welcome home, Antone.\" The Prince seldom addressed him thus. There was a softness that made the Colonel raise his large eyes to the face of the boy General, and murmured \u2014 \" I saw the grim shadow to-night, your Royal Highness.\""], [196, "188 WON BY HONOUR. \" Were you not deluded ? \" asked the General. \"I believe not; my thoughts were on tbe battle field. When I turned I faced the gaunt spectre ; before that I saw his reflection on the water.\" \" We both saw it,\" answered the Prince. Contrary winds arose, which delayed the arrival of the fleet until the afternoon of the next day. No sign of rejoicing greeted the return of the victorious troops. All flags in the harbour were flying half-mast high. A Royal guard of honor awaited the arrival of the young Commander. Even they wore the semblance of grief. The salute of the officers bore the same impress. The young Prince asked eagerly if the King and Queen were well, to which the affirma tive was given, supplemented by the information that they mourned the loss of an esteemed friend. As the officer spoke he glanced towards Colonel Derritt. The Prince noticed and drew his con clusions. The Palace gates stood wide open as the youth ful, victorious Commander rode through with his escort and suite, the two page boys mounted on two chargers. The King and Queen stood on the balcony, attired in sombre robes. Their son dismounted, gave his charger to the care of his equerry, and"], [197, "189 WON BY HONOUR. joined his parents. The King repaired to his audience chamber after embracing and congratu lating his son, and sent for the young Colonel, who, when he entered, bowed low, awaiting his Majesty's speech. \" Noble warrior, would that we could have greeted you as we would had not sorrow pre vented; heaven has tempered our triumphs with keen loss.\" The King had excluded all from the painful duty he had chosen to perform. He con tinued, \" I sorrow with you, dear youth, for the loss of one dear to us both.\" The Monarch lost none of his Majestic bearing, but into it was fused a tender, filial feeling. He told with delicacy and strong emotion, the weird dark story of Eglantine, coupled with that of Chateau de Blain. Almost afraid to speak the name of the murderer lest he should wound the honorable heart kneeling before him, crushed by the weight of a grief with no extenuating circumstances to lighten its woe. \" Be comforted, Antone; until a few hours before his death, the Earl, to whom you owe your commission in our army, was ignorant of your being the son of his beloved sister. This was an immense comfort, inasmuch as your valor and your honest integrity were a sweet odor to her memory.\""], [198, "190 WON BY HONOUR. \" How terrible ! \" exclaimed the Colonel. \" How bitter the pang ! that I inherit estates my brother hoped to purchase by blood.\" \" Nothing can now alter the past ; all that can be done has been by the Earl's faithful servants. Crimes such as these are of rare occurrence ; the sorrow falls upon those who deserve a happier lot. Here is a document that may in the future afford you much comfort.\" Antone accepted it, and thus replied \u2014 \" Heaven has smiled upon my grief, to suffer me to win favor in the sight of so just a Monarch, who will not spurn innocence closely allied to guilt and crime, dark enough to condemn and follow all concerned with eternal shame.\" \" Read this letter of the Count's, and you will see why we liberate you at once, to go to your native country. The Count, at our Sovereign behest, has acted for you, and as we believe the revered dead intended.\" The Colonel, too full of grief to utter anything, kissed loyally the Royal hand, rose, halted before the door, and said \u2014 \" May my future loyalty to my Gracious Sovereign prove how grateful has been his wondrous condescension. I gather this tribute and carry it to the tomb of the man whom his"], [199, "191 WON BY HONOUR. Majesty the King of Spain has condescended to call his friend. To him all honor is due.\" \" We confess, Colonel Derritt, ourselves staggered that two sons of the same parents should personate strongly vice and virtue, honor and crime, rather unhinges our belief in certain traditional theories. We are inclined to think little is really known here of the complex mystery of human existence.\" In passing out Antone met the Queen, who addressed him tenderly, saying \u2014 \" Heaven be praised ; you know where to find a balsam for these terrible woes.\" The room prepared for Antone in the Palace was the one occupied by his uncle years ago. The Earl's miniature and many traces of him greeted the young man's eye. Antone walked out on the balcony, and from there to the cloisters, to cool his fevered brow. A soft hand was laid upon his arm, and a voice he had never heard before said \u2014 \" Colonel Derritt, you will leave little Vivian the undisturbed possession of Chateau le Blain?\" Antone started, turned to look, and was trans fixed by the exquisite beauty of the speaker. Who she was he knew not. He made no answer. As yet he had scarcely grasped the history in that part of its tragic detail."], [200, "192 WON BY HONOUR. Modest as a violet, innocently her hand still rested on the Colonel's arm. Conscious of her power, yet guileless as to where it sprang, she pursued her purpose, saying \u2014 \"Much as my sympathies are exercised for you, my tenderest are evoked for the innocent little daughter of the murderer, pure and tortured by the crimes encircling her. She is alone and shunned, while you are victorious, rich, honored, and esteemed \u2014 the favourite of a King, while that little one wears Cain's brand she no more merits than you or I. She is dependent upon your generosity ; you are her uncle. How do you intend to handle this frail blossom, Colonel ? \" Antone blushed under the battery of those liquid eyes, wet with tears. He had never seen one so irresistibly lovely. Afraid to reply lest he should annoy the King, she noticed his predica ment, and said \u2014 \" You have never seen me before ; I am the King's niece. Like Vivian, poor and obscure, my sire was a ne'er-do-well, hence my sympathies for that child.

I shall be obeyed without proviso.\" One of the ladies of the Court appeared, and implored the Princess Sycosta to come to her Majesty the Queen at once.

Answer me, or I will never again look upon you except by compulsion.\" \" The child shall be well tended and amply dowered.

She chased him as a gay butterfly. In a few moments he returned to Antone, and said \u2014 \"The King wishes to see you ere you depart. Do not surrender your martial career; a brilliant prospect lies before you.

The third day after the Earl's obsequies the Countess aud her son were removed to the niche assigned to them. Shortly after Antone visited the bower where he first met Lord Covertmoor, and established as pure a friendship as was ever on the page of record. As he sat in thought he heard voices ascending the mound. He could see at a glance it was Sir Michal Dunloop's daughter, some one with her wearing the uniform of a lieu tenant of the Guards. The former said \u2014 \" I should think Antone Derritt will not settle here, to be shunned by all the county families as the brother of a murderer.\" \" Hush ! \" answered the officer. \" He is innocent of crime as you and I.

Nearly every nation of Europe was represented at the obsequies. The English mustered in stronger force, I am told, than any former record on the page of history.

He was superior to revenge, or even indignation, and sat quietly until the two were out of sight. He took from the morocco case the necklet, and contrasted the delicious, genuine softness, accom panied by the imperiousness of rank and rearing of the Princess, with anyone he had previously known. Arresting the thought as treachery to his monarch, he recalled her wishes singly. Antone was most chary in appropriating the title granted to him by Royal warrant until his solicitor urged the importance. Something lies brought before Lord Covertmoor's consideration occupied him for the time to the exclusion of everything. He learned that his father laid in the chapel of the Abbey in his coffin, it is true, but without decent burial. The Abbey was a prey to money-lenders, while his sisters were in a state of woeful destitution, tending the boy Erskept, who came to them in hopeless incipient disease. Antone immediately left for the Abbey, accom panied by two solicitors. The first step was to"], [206, "198 WON BY HONOUR. have the Earl quietly buried. He then visited his sisters and administered to their necessities, gave instructions for the boy to be buried. About noon on the second day the Earl left the home he quitted at six years old. Placards were pasted all over the old monastic residence. It was advertised for sale. The furniture was now on view; streams of people sought admittance \u2014 for various motives. The Earl repaired to the library. Through his solicitors a meeting was fixed for the following day of Lord Gortzey's creditors, and an inquiry instituted as to the liabilities of Lord Erskept. As soon as the sum of satisfaction was concluded and it was found that it was in accord- ance with the late Earl's wishes, for he had set aside a portion he had judged would meet this necessity, for such he was sure Antone would deem it, and not wishing his wife's money to be used in a cause so foreign to her nature. This concluded, Antone set off for Chateau le Blain. It was growing dusk when he presented himself at the lodge gates ; with difficulty he satisfied the woman of his claim to admittance. He went direct to the chapel, ascended the altar steps, knelt before it silently. Until he was about to rise he did not notice that the altar must have been decorated that day. His eyes now fell upon"], [207, "WON BY HONOUR. 199 the tomb. It was open. On the steps sat a child with golden hair ; she was weaving a chaplet of white blooms. She looked more like a visitant from the land of spirits than the daughter of a murderer. She whispered, while her voice trembled \u2014 \" Will my Uncle Antone forgive, or will he visit crime on me? He won all by honor, so I am told ; he will then be just.\" Antone approached softly, and said in a whisper \u2014 \" Vivian, my child, am I not the brother of Erskept ? His guilt casts its shadow on all allied, not on his daughter only.\" The little girl shyly approached, invited by the sweet smile. Together they descended the steps of the vault. There Antone heard the story of the tragic fate of the tenant of the little blue velvet coffin. A tear fell on Vivian's hand. She knew, for the first time, a pure heart needed no covering to cloak its sin. In the Chateau Antone showed Vivian the Princess's gift, and told of her re quest. It rather puzzled than pleased the little girl. She was satisfied in the love of her uncle, yet treasured the gift. The Earl employed a Notary, and with him mastered the tangled state of the small estate"], [208, "200 WON BY HONOUR. appended. He found, well managed, it would be quite adequate to the requirements of the small establishment, and would admit of at least two horses and a groom added. After ten days had flown happily Antone un folded to his niece his plan for her future, telling her that in the afternoon of that day Madame Moustang would arrive. In her she would find all he hoped conducive to her mental and moral welfare. For the present she must be contented to live a life of seclusion. Two days after the arrival of Madame, to whom Lord Covertmoor was entrusting the entire man agement of the Chateau and its estate with the care and culture of the little Vivian, they were surprised by a call from the Earl and Countess of the adjoining Chateau. Antone introduced them to Madame Moustang. They admired Antone's selection, invited the chaperon and her charge to call when they liked. The intercourse would be pleasing to all concerned. At length Lord Covertmoor bade the little Vivian farewell, and returned to put the affairs at the Court in moving order, as well as examine all his uncle's papers, a project he had postponed until the last moment on account of its painful nature."], [209, "201 WON BY HONOUR. Antone suffered his sisters to tenant the Abbey under certain clear restrictions. He allowed them a separate income, which, to them, was absolute wealth. Still, between them and their brother no bond of affection existed. Nine weeks of toil followed, in which Antone, his steward, and solicitors dissected the late Earl's propositions for alterations and set them in motion, afterwards giving out his determination to resume his military career for a few years at most. His office bearers remonstrated. The Earl replied \u2014 \" Since Spain had done him the signal honor of giving him a commission when he was obscure and poor, it would be mean to desert altogether when riches and title furnished him with both. Such a course of action was not in consonance with honor.\" Before leaving he paid a visit to the Mausoleum. After kneeling there some time he heard a sob, and became aware he had heedlessly left open the door.

He knew he had nothing to fear, but still he could see the King was chafed. He said, while kneeling \u2014 \" If I have committed an error, my gracious Sovereign, it was an unintentional one.

The Princess still knelt, for she saw no signs of yielding in the King. She begged the Monarch not to suffer the Colonel to leave the Palace on her account, while the Prince knelt and implored his Royal father to listen to his cousin's desire. Young Ferdinand betrayed, in his eloquent pleading for Sycosta, his secret to the observant eyes of his father. The Queen was told of the General's hasty departure from the Palace by some of the maids of honor. She at once sought the King, un aware of the heavy cloud of displeasure hanging over the head of her Royal spouse. Her Majesty loved the Princess tenderly, and she saw imme diately on entry that the Monarch was unyield ing. She bade the children go at once. The youthful maiden obeyed with a significance no one understood, giving orders that not anyone was to be admitted to her chamber under any plea \u2014 not even the Queen. This reigning favorite's request none dare deny. Into her confidence she admitted one of the young ladies of the Court ; this however, was a profound secret to all but the Princess's maid, who would rather suffer death than divulge the confidence of her revered darling. The Princess's poverty made her secure from any"], [219, "WON BY HONOUR. 211 resistance the King and Queen supposed, though they were well aware of her high-metalled spirit. The purse, delicately presented by the young Countess, was Sycosta thus enabled to carry out her project. For several days the Princess's retirement was scarcely observed, other matters of political im portance absorbing the King's attention. Orders, meanwhile, were conveyed for the expe dition to sail for the distant port to which they were bound. General Derritt was not sent for to the Royal presence as formerly \u2014 a written order alone, conveying the intelligence that to General Amazion was entrusted the command of the troops. The evening of the departure of the detach ment to suppress the revolutionary manifestations a letter was handed to the King, giving notice of the flight of the Princess from her lawful guardians, alleging as her reason the jealous anxiety evinced by the Sovereign lest his son should manifest a preference for his poor humble cousin. Her own utter inability to reciprocate such an attachment, while she had something of equal value to guard. Her Royal cousin's brilliant alliance with some potent political power. This news caused the Prince a serious illness."], [220, "212 WON BY HONOUR. It was well known at Court how attached he was to his cousin. No one knew, or if they did, they did not reveal, whither she had fled. Her god mother was sent to, with the fond hope she might possess tidings. The Dowager Queen received the news with consternation. She doted on this child of her wild son, whose short and eventful career was ever present to her memory. She came at once to the Palace of her son to learn every particular respecting the terrible loss. The whole Court was under a cloud of gloom \u2014 with the illness of the Prince, and the continual un certainty as to the fate of the lovely Princess. An officer, joining the Hesperides at a distant port, brought the rumour of the Prince's serious illness, and the flight of the youthful Princess from the palace. The latter event did not surprise Antone, for he saw the extreme firmness of the metal, together with the unbending position his Majesty took, which he afterwards bitterly regretted for his Royal mother's sake, and also for the lovely maiden whose absence he sorely missed. Young Ferdinand told his father, while his life quivered in the balance, he had been unjust to General Derritt by his severity, and entreated him to efface an act, sullying his diadem, by some"], [221, "213 WON BY HONOUR. acknowledgment of it to the young soldier who had made ample atonement for any unintended indiscretion.

Nevertheless, though honored and revered by the Commander and every man of the force, General Derritt's valor was of a fierce order. It was evident that his courage, bravery, and fortitude were not lessened, yet there was some secret grief that took from his deeds the sharp piquancy pervading them in the preceding campaigns. Yet it would have been impossible for a mere superficial onlooker to tell where the difference was. The enterprise was far more stubborn than the Spanish nation anticipated, for when the rebellion was quelled in one part it broke out with even more virulence where it was not even expected to exist.

In the despatches from the home govern ment no mention was even made of the Royal Blues, the regiment which loved to hear their General's voice amidst them, and to whom success was in every instance to be mainly traced. This silence surprised, vexed, and puzzled the Commander. His private reports to the King, as well as public and official ones, spoke loudly of the debt of gratitude Spain owed to so valiant a soldier as General Derritt. He frankly owned that his duties were nominal ones really, because he felt the young man's martial capacity far ahead of his, and consulted and acted upon his advice in every matter of moment. Still no mention or even allusion to these remarks was made. General Amazion was uncomfortable. It made him appear mean and even false in the eyes of the men he ruled. The youthful General respected his commanding officer, and in every respect exhibited obedience, and the men many of them recognized the youthful General in the orders issued. Never once did Antone receive a letter from tbe Court of Madrid. The young Prince's silence was possibly the most galling, still with this grief gnawing, the young Earl worked nobly without"], [224, "216 WON BY HONOUR. the slightest acknowledgment of the daily service he was rendering tu the country of his adoption. Antone put the King's silence down to his Monarch's displeasure on account of his interview with the Princess and the execution of a com mission without Royal permission. This, though he knew it not, had nothing whatever to do with the real cause for the silence at Madrid. Occasionally Lord Covertmoor received long letters from his solicitors. In one was an enclosure in a feminine hand, the paper marked by a coronet. Antone blushed crimson. He was dining with General Amazion as the latter said \u2014 \" Come, my Lord of Covertmoor, read your home despatches. My only hope is you will not be required there before Spain has shown her appreciation of services nobler than any I have ever seen on record.\" \" You must not forget, my friend, that the Spanish Monarch gave me a commission, while I was a mere beggar as regards means. My family, though well born, had discarded me. It is I who am toiling to repay the honor bestowed so graciously by Spain's Monarch.\" \" I must not disturb you. Pardon me ; already a maiden is in the question. Suffer me to remind"], [225, "217 WON BY HONOUR. you that the Princess has fled from the Court of Madrid, I believe on your account.\" \" General Amazion, never couple my name there, I entreat you. She who has rejected more than one crown would never think of an Earl ! No, I am not vain enough for that thought to gain access.\" Antone nervously opened the letter. It was written clearly and fearlessly. \" Ivetta, Countess of Oderfield, begs to return to the Earl of Covertmoor the loan which saved her from a pecuniary crisis as well as a mental one, which was in imminent danger of resulting in a tragic manner.

The King has ambitious projects for the former.\" The young General made no reply, but opened eagerly the letter, which was extremely brief, yet very warm and cordial, asking Antone as a favor if he would get to know who the Countess Silestra, young and lovely, really was, at the present moment the rage of the English Court. Her stay at any Court was brief. Rumours were one day circulated she had accepted some Royal diadem, the next contradicted flatly. The Prince begged that his young favorite would not delay. Lord Covertmoor wrote at once to his solicitor, giving instructions for the matter to have his instant attention, the information gained to be sent under his seal to the young Prince at the Court of Madrid. Antone was curious himself respecting the Countess, so he took the opportunity of writing to Lady Vivian's brother, and inquiring if he knew anything of the fair Countess making such a sensation at the several Courts of Europe. To this the Earl replied promptly, urging Antone to return, assuring him he ought to be satisfied with the fame the admiring world dowered him.

Highly accomplished, clever, witty beyond compare, and an excellent lin guist. One minute you think she has Spanish blood, the next Italian. Again, she appears so purely English in some national characteristic you are confounded. Flattered, admired, even adored, she remained unspoiled, yet wilful and capricious ; the latter, however, were both innocent and harmless, free from the venom oft concealed in the shafts hurled by the heavily dowered of Venus at their less fortunate sisters. The Earl said, \" I may say she is regal in beauty, manner, and movement. More I cannot tell you.\" While the Spanish nation enjoyed the fruits of what the army gained for them, the soldiers now suffered cruelly from the harassing attacks of some native tribes, who together conspired to overthrow and defeat the victorious host, hearing that no inconsiderable part of the enemies' strength suffered from malaria, while several of the officers were down likewise. One or two deaths spread terror around. The young Prince now in boldness appealed to his father to know how General Derritt had dis pleased his Sovereign so that no mention should"], [228, "220 WON BY HONOUR. be made of him in the official reports, when other nations were giving the Englishman the praise he so justly merited. \"My son,\" replied the King, \"for cautious and political reasons have I refrained from according praise either publicly or privately. Our young favorite has acquitted himself nobly, even without a crumb of adulation as an incentive or stimulus. Older and wiser heads than ours, my son, have seen it necessary to use prudence in the display of Royal favor. The mouth of slander has already been curbed by the course pursued. I proclaimed that any officer who could outstrip the young General should have rapid promotion. They, my people, shall have from me justice. My future course you will more clearly decipher. The young hero has enemies in his own rank. We must stand back to permit the nation to make a display of its appreciation of worth.\" \" Your explanation, noble sire, has altered our views.

The child had no money.\" \" True, your Majesty, but she possesses that which no wealth can purchase. As you know, she is richly dowered. Lady Mendip supplies every conceivable want with more alacrity than did the Monarch, whose niece she is,\" replied Ferdinand. \" Is it really so, my son ? \" The door slowly opened ; the Dowager Queen entered leaning on the arm of her daughter-in law, the former's eyes moist with tears.

The ex-Queen wept in perfect rapture, while the King asked his son how he knew the Countess Silestra was at Vienna. The Prince blushed ere he replied \u2014 \" Does the King demand I resign my secret, known to three ; must I make it a quartette by admitting my Royal sire ? \" They repaired to the Royal signet chamber. The Prince knelt while he handed two miniatures"], [231, "223 WON BY HONOUR. to the King, the one of his cousin, the other the youthful Archduchess Clivera. The Monarch was deeply moved, and said \u2014 \" How is it my will is accomplished ? Not through the very Princess whom I banished with my severity, while all the nation would have honored her as Queen. Ferdinand, my son, if you still love Sycosta, I demand not this sacrifice.\" \" She loves me only as a brother. It must ever remain as she wills. I must and will be faithful to Clivera.

Two years had sped away before the recall of the victorious troops was even heard of. The last battle was the hottest and fiercest of the number, the enemy being completely vanquished and totally routed. The official reports received from the Commander were curt rather than brief, and con tained no detail nor the mention of a single name. General Amazion's patience was well-nigh ex hausted ; he determined to arouse interest by exciting curiosity. He merely said they had lost very heavily some of their picked men both in battle and by malaria. On receipt of this despatch orders were imme diately issued for the recall of the expedition. Still the King stood neutral, though he took care to let it be known that any demonstration the people chose to make would meet with his ap proval."], [233, "WON BY HONOUR. 225 As the anticipated hour drew nigh when the fleet were expected to arrive, general excitement prevailed. Those who through jealousy kept aloof were marked. The populace resented the feeling, and determined to punish it in the way they knew could not fail to be distasteful. The regiments in the capital all came, some without their Colonel, and others minus a subordinate officer. The people looked in vain for the King. For the first time during his reign discontent prevailed. Near the landing stage stood a magnificent landau, drawn by four cream horses, decked with laurel branches. Clearly they did not belong to the Palace. It was not certain whether they were sent for the Commander or the young General. The booming of cannon announced the arrival; the eager throng pressed. They were, however, not allowed to pass the barrier. The people were hushed by expectancy into that expressive silence which precurses oppressive demonstration. The disembarkation was effected with astonish ing rapidity, the band of each regiment playing as they passed from the vessel into the place assigned them. The Commander's plume was seen to wave on the deck of the Resperides, yet no single cheer greeted him. All eyes were turned Q"], [234, "226 WON BY HONOUR. to where he stood, evidently giving orders for the removal of the sick and wounded. Very soon a litter, borne on the shoulders of four men, slowly approached. As soon as the vast masses heard a soldier call \" Derritt \" a deafening round of cheering greeted the young General. His pale, emaciated face bespoke his suffering, yet he smiled kindly as he perceived all heads uncovered as a mark of deference. They now flocked round the carriage, and were only kept back by the Royal Blues, who thanked them for their love, which was touchingly received by their brave leader. He was, however, too weak to endure fatigue. Antone saw their eager disappointed faces, heeded not the doctor's warning or General Amazion's expostulations. \" Let him speak,\" cried the people, \" our victorious hero.\" \" Whom do you call your hero ? \" asked Amazion, his face aglow with honest joy as he waited for the reply. \"The young English officer, to be sure,\" shouted over a thousand men in a breath. \"If he can he shall speak, noble countrymen.

He is not yet recovered from the effects of malaria. Let me implore you to be con siderate, for on the slenderest thread hangs a valuable life.\" General Derritt strove to rise, but it was apparent he could not do that. So hushed to silence was the concourse that it was not difficult to hear what the General said. \" Beloved countrymen, I am compelled to ad dress you sitting, seeing I have lost a limb in your service. You will now see the reason your welcome, and the evident regard you show, is more than ample compensation. It tells me I have not laboured in vain to do honor to the cause I have espoused. The welfare of the nation who did me the signal honor of soliciting me to fight under its banner is dear to my affections. It is your favor I have longed to secure.

Weakness com pels me to say farewell.

Still the King was not visible, much to the surprise of the Commander. An order was given into his hands that by the command of his Majesty they were to appear before a convened assembly of the State and the army. Some delay ensued. Owing to General Derritt's condition he could not obey the call. The Commander re sponded with alacrity. Fearlessly, as well as nobly, he asserted that the brilliant success the Spanish troops had gained was attributable to the able and martial power of the crippled General. The King entered just as Amazion had com menced to harangue the assembly. Still he preserved a discreet silence. When his Majesty returned to the Palace he sent a messenger to the suite of apartments assigned to the Earl formerly to tell the youug soldier he would see him there at once if suitable. Antone's answer was an affirmative one."], [237, "WON BY HONOUR. 229 The King entered alone, his face beaming with augmented tenderness.

Saluting Antone on both his cheeks, he wept from excess of joy, and said \u2014 \" Surely you have not lost a limb ? \" \" Yes, my right leg ; it is not much,\" replied Antone, cheerfully. The door slowly unclosed ; the ex-Queen entered,"], [238, "230 WON BY HONOUR. followed by her daughter-in-law. The former Antorie had not previously seen.

He waited but a moment ere he replied \u2014 \" Surely your Majesty cannot have so mean an opinion of my honor to suppose I should pre sume to think of one so far removed from me as the lovely Princess.\" To this no one replied.

Scarcely had that door closed than another opened\u2014 through it passed a vision of loveliness clad in silver gossamer. She timidly approached, her face deliciously full of pathos.

Recall them, or leave me, I entreat you.\" \" Antone ! \" replied Sycosta, \" If I for once dis obey you, surely you will not interpret this action to my future prejudice.\" The General could not reply. Encircled by mystery he feared to move ; still, his heart fluttered fondly with hopes his sober reason con demned. \"You fulfilled my conditions far beyond their limits, Antone. I knew there was no need to fear where you alone were concerned.\" A blush of indescribable loveliness suffused the maiden's face as she became painfully aware Antone was uncomfortable to be in her presence alone. She esteemed him tenfold for this honor able motive, while he replied to her last expression thus \u2014 \" Did I, your Royal Highness ? So far it is well. Do, however, oblige me by calling your cousin, my valet, or any spectator to our conference.

I must leave you; my dignity will not permit my confessions to be merely whispered in the presence of my worthy cousin even.\" Fire kindled in her eyes, yet tenderness asserted itself. She bowed and departed. When she had gone Antone felt the world to him nil and void, and would have given worlds to recall her. Yet he knew it must not be. He was ashamed, he who had led others to victory was now morally to be the conquered, and at the loss of that which had hitherto won all for him. The strife was fierce, yet, as he fought, he was sensible of the late Earl's smile. Before he was aware of it the Queen stood by his couch. She said, tenderly \u2014 \"Alone, dear Antone ! How is this ? Sycosta, by our wish and her own, came to tend you. \" \"Impossible, your Majesty, that the King should be so unwise as to commit a wounded soldier to the care of one so inexpressibly beauti ful as the charming Princess. While I am strong in battle I confess to a strong susceptibility to feminine charms, such as those in question. Who could be otherwise ? \""], [241, "233 WON BY HONOUR. The Prince stood at his mother's right hand, and asked \u2014 \"Of whom are you speaking? Such praise would be misapplied save when used regarding the only maiden I could call perfect,\" continued he. \" You are right. I loved her to madness and distraction in a way your cooler blood cannot understand. She, alas ! returned not my love, save as a sister, and chided me, knowing it to be displeasing to the King, who has ambitious pro jects for me. She was small and obscure. Who would wear a crown more gracefully, or adorn it than the Princess Sycosta? Any Monarch, whether King or Emperor, could never say justly they stooped to win or woo so pure and lovely a con sort. She values lightly position. Crowns have no charm for her. Virtue and honor is the magnet attracting her.\" The Queen saw how painful was the discussion to her son's still bleeding wound, so answered \u2014 \" Ferdinand has acted wisely, and is worthy of praise.

Then his affianced bride, or rather his intended one, is the bosom com panion of our darling, Clivera, the young Arch duchess of Austria.\" Antone looked in grave astonishment at the boy Prince and the Queen thus discussing prematurely marriage for one so young. She understood his surprise, and said \u2014 \" We, of the sunny south, are far in advance of you. Our children form attachments in child hood, marry long before you would deem them fit. I know the arguments you bring to bear upon this are weighty, yet our climate rules here.\" The Queen retired. The Prince sat by his friend and told why Sycosta fled, not so much so on account of the King's displeasure because of her interview, but to cure his love for her and to interest her companion in the beautiful character of her beloved cousin. Antone expressed his astonishment that the charming Princess should have resisted so many applicants for her hand, while the Prince said, with deep feeling \u2014 \" She loves truly one who was once obscure, but has won a place of distinction in the annals of fame and honor.

Before the King repaired to his chamber, he entered Antone's, exclaiming \u2014 \" Not asleep yet ! You have no battles to plan. Why this hectic flush?

It is like its vast Source, incapable of limitation. We will say no more, for what we have said is only the fruit of observation, hence capable of error.

The gentle movements of the nurse soothed the invalid, who watched her with a keen eye, under which she quailed not. Antone was not disposed for sleep. She told him stories of the Court and its brilliant doings, while he was surprised into asking how the disappearance of the Princess was received, and what construction was put upon it. Had Antone's eyes been fixed upon the face of her he addressed he might have read something there. The reply was concisely given thus \u2014 \" It is well known the young Prince loved his poor cousin. The King had other projects for both. It was well the maiden had no other love for the companion of her childhood than that of a sister.\" \" It is strange one of the Princess's charms should remain yet unwon.\" \" An old story, but generally hidden from the inquisitive world, the truth known by the favored few.

The charming girl's blush of pride and joy was not evoked by these proofs of wealth and power, but in the delight her bridegroom's presence evidently gave the people whom she loved. Pale, yet outwardly cool, stood Prince Ferdinand at Antone's right hand, and his voice trembled as he said \u2014 \"We are cousins, Antone, and to no crowned head could I have so willingly surrendered a jewel, to me so priceless. Heaven bless you, and enable you to shield the loveliest of her race from sorrow.\" Sycosta imprinted a kiss on the white brow. As she did so, she said to the Archduchess, whose hand she placed in that of her cousin \u2014 \" May you one day be as happy as we.\" Turn ing to Antone she asked \" if she were saying too much ? \" The happy bridegroom replied by a silent embrace. As they were leaving the banqueting hall the King placed in his niece's hand a roll of parchment, adding to Antone the following sentence, sententiously \u2014 \" Sycosta, the beloved daughter of Spain's Sovereign, comes not to you portionless.

I shall never do for her people what my beloved husband has done for mine.\" \" We will go when you will, darling. I have kept our marriage secret. The preparations made at the Court must have aroused great curiosity, as it was necessary to have them on a large scale. It is not every Earl who brings home a bride of Royal blood.

Who she was appeared enshrined in mystery. Considerable disappointment reigned when it became recognized as a fact beyond dispute that the wealthy Earl was really married, and that no chance remained to the neighbouring aspirants. The exact date of their arrival even Mr. lies could not say. At three o'clock in the afternoon of Wednesday two servants wearing the Earl's new livery rode up to the lodge gates. The most intense excitement prevailed in the village. At the door of the Covertmoor Arms stood the important landlord, full of consequence, noting the fact to every customer that the Earl stayed but a very few years back, an obscure and very humble student, as a lodger in his parlor. And now he was a full-fledged lordling, as wealthy as a Jew, but with no spice of pride or avarice. \" They are corned,\" said the landlady ; \" I seed the outriders.\" A messenger was despatched to the Lodge to know the truth. Just at that moment a splendid equipage with six cream horses drove through the lodge gates. It contained the Archduchess, with her ladies ; the second the Countess and her"], [255, "247 WON BY HONOUR. attendants, the remainder following. The mes senger, too eager to return, waited not to inquire if it were the bride and groom, but ran away with the supposition that it could be no other than they. On the receipt of this news the villagers, dis appointed of the welcome they had intended, determined to take the law into their hands, assembled in large masses, breaking through the lodge gates, literally besieging the Court, much to the amusement of the Earl's guests, who came out. On the appearance of the Austrian Princess they cried with one breath \u2014 \" The bride, but where is the Earl ? \" lies, justly annoyed, begged the guests to over look the event. The Archduchess and the Countess both ex pressed their pleasure at the eagerness evinced. The latter went out on to the terrace, mounted the steps of a fountain, and with a wave of her hand commanded and secured silence. She thus spoke \u2014 \" Beloved friends of the Earl of Covertmoor, you are mistaken ; the Earl and his Royal bride are expected to-morrow. I am maid of honor to your future mistress, niece of the King of Spain. Ere"], [256, "248 WON BY HONOUR. twelve months have rolled away every tongue will testify to the truth of what I say. No lovelier woman and more virtuous one ever graced these vast halls than she whom Spain's beloved and honored hero has won.\" \"A Princess he is gone and got. He is in luck's way,\" says another. The coming of the bride and groom was royally heralded, for Antone's own regiment, as a guard of honor, was sent by the King to escort them, under the command of the Prince, who marshalled them all in front of the Hotel, where the Earl's carriage, escorted by a band of yeomanry, awaited them. \" My cousin ! \" exclaimed Sycosta. \" Antone, do look ; the Royal detachment is presenting arms.\" The band struck up, \" See the Conquering Hero Comes.\" They entered the village amidst showers of shouted well-wishes. The Princess's smiles as she drove through a literal maze of flowers to her new home won for her the love and admiration of the people amongst whom she was to dwell. The long line of carriages that fell into the procession and went to the Court astonished the bride more than her husband, who had seen a mournful gathering very like it."], [257, "249 WON BY HONOUR. As they alighted before the stately mansion the Archduchess advanced. She blushed as she beheld the Prince. Antone lifted out his charming wife with exquisite tenderness. At his elbow was a face he could never forget, though only once seen. She had just dismounted from one of the many carriages. Gracefully she placed in the hand of the bride a present, saying to them \u2014 \"Amongst this vast concourse 1 have the most genuine desire for your happiness. The debt I owe to Antone Derritt is one eternity has registered.\" She moved rapidly away. The Earl now turned to the people who thronged around and presented his wife. A deep blush of pleasure mantled his face. He mounted on the steps ; the crowd for the first time saw he had lost a leg. A suppressed murmur ran through the throng; it reached the ear of Antone's bride. It was this \u2014 \" She so lovely, and marry an Earl, even with one leg ! \" The Princess's eyes sparkled as she mounted to her husband's side, and said, without warning \u2014 \"Yes, friends, and I am proud to own one who s"], [258, "250 WON BY HONOUR. has won all by honor as my husband. He lost his limb in the service. I deem it a privilege to surrender myself and all I own to the Earl of Covertmoor.

On tbe seat, near the book, which still laid there, was a parcel, directed by Chantrey, late Earl, as his wedding gift. The two were startled, until Antone recalled that it must have been entrusted to the steward, under the Earl's orders. It was a magnificent grace cup, with the English and Spanish ensign in jewels of a rare order. \" He might have known Antone,\" said Sycosta, tenderly. \" There never was one more unselfish than my friend.
