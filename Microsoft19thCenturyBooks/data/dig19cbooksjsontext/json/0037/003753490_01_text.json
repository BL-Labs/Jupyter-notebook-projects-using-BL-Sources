Mr. Stedworth, manufacturer of art fabrics, Avas standing on the hearthrug in his library one sunny afternoon, very early in May. It was a handsome room, well propor tioned and decorated, and fitted up with everything that mind or sense could desire, taste devise, and money procure, and enriched with old curios and treasures of art, picked up in travels that had ex- VOL.

The carpet had been made to order in India; the book-cases Avere filled Avith the finest edi tions of the best authors of all nations ; the bronzes, sculptures, and carvings AArere masterpieces of ancient and modern genius ; the pictures Avould have excited the envy of many a critical collector, and the rare inlaid cabinets displayed behind their glass doors almost priceless speci mens of old china. Everything told that a connoisseur and artist dAvelt here. But the beauty and luxury of the room seemed to afford a very moderate degree of pleasure to its owner, judging by the listless, absent manner in Avhich his eye roved from one object to another. He AA-as a tall, slenderly-built man of about fifty, but looking considerably older. His hair and beard were almost Avhite, and his shoulders had that slight stoop Avhich"], [13, "A CATASTROPHE. 3 is often indicative of ill-health. He must have been unusually handsome in his youth, but now the most striking charac teristic of his face was its melancholy \u2014 a melancholy so profound as to leave the observer no time for comment on feature or colouring. His blue eyes appeared to be constantly looking far aAvay into a past that had no connection Avith the present, or into a future veiled in a mist he patiently strove to pierce, and his kindly smile, always ready for all to AA'hom kindness or courtesy AA-as due, Avas as sad as it Avas sweet. Many said of Ralph Stedworth, ' I could love that man,' but none knew him Avell enough to love him except his manager, Charles Grinrwood. Mr. StedAvorth took very little active part in the conduct of his business. He left it almost entirely in the hands of the b 2"], [14, "4 A WOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. manager, who had begun life as junior clerk in the time of Mr. StedAvorth's father, and had risen to deserve, as Avell as to receive, the fullest confidence of his employers. The business, hoAArever, under this man agement, though it ran very surely and steadily on its old lines, struck out no neAv ones. It AA'as respected in the mer cantile Avorld as a A'ery safe and trust- Avorthy house, but it Avas considered much behind the times, and lamentably lacking in enterprise. Mr. GriniAvood Avas upright and con scientious, but he AA'as not gifted Avith any great imaginative poAvers, and Avas not the man to urge his employer to larger under takings than he Avas inclined for. Mr. StedAvorth Avas not ambitious of fame or Avealth. He AA'as, in truth, already as rich as he cared to be. He was un-"], [15, "5 A CATASTROPHE. married, had neither kith nor kin to come after him, and Avas in someAvhat feeble health. He lived a quiet life in the fine old house and place five miles from Dan ingham, which had been sold to pay the debts of the spendthrift last scion of an ancient Norman family. He Avent very little into society, and took no more in terest than Avas absolutely necessary in the manufacture of art fabrics, but Avas always ready Avith money, time, and labour for philanthropic Avorks, though he in dulged but little in personal philanthropy, and did not indulge at all in any form of ' slumming.' The Avives and children of his factory hands rarely saAV his face except by acci dent, though there Avas not one who could not testify to his ready liberality Avhen they needed substantial help.

One such enthusiast had just been calling on Mr. StedAvorth, and possibly it Avas the recollection of this gentleman's exhortations Avhich clouded his usually serenely sad face. Presently he roused himself and rang the bell. ' I want the dog-cart round at once,' he said to the serA'ant Avho ansAvered it. At the sound of his voice there came into vieAV from behind the Avriting-table a big fox terrier Avith a handsome head and a curious expression of placid intelligence. He came up to his master and put up his"], [17, "A CATASTROPHE. 7 forepaws against him, looking expectantly into his face. ' Well, Gib, old fellow,' said Mr. Sted- Avorth, caressing the animal with his long, thin, bloodless hand. He had a peculiarly agreeable voice, clear, Avell-modulated and refined, but, like his face, it Avas sad. There seemed to be in it the echo of a cry uttered long ago. ' Do you want to knoAV Avhere I am go ing?' he went on. ' I am going AArhere }'ou AA-ill like to come too. I am going to have tea Avith Honor, if she is at home.' The dog wagged the stump of a tail that fashion decrees to fox-terriers, as if he understood every Avord. Then suddenly he dropped his fore-feet on the ground, cocked his silky, tan-coloured ears, and stood listening intently. ' What is it, old felloAv ? \u2014 What do you hear ?'"], [18, "8 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. Gib replied by scampering to the door and barking loudly. But the sounds which had produced his excitement had noAV become audible above his barks. There was the noise of horses' feet galop ping furiously up to the hall door. Then a violent peal at the bell, and a moment later the buzz of an eager colloquy Avithin the hall. Mr. StedAvorth advanced towards the door to enquire into the cause of the com motion, but even as he did so it Avas throAvn open and the butler appeared on the threshold Avith all the signs of horror and perturbation stamped on his face. ' What is the matter?' began Mr. Sted- Avorth, but the man spoke atthe sameinstant. ' Oh, sir,' he exclaimed, ' there has been an accident at the factory.' 'An accident!' repeated Mr. StedAvorth, quickly. ' Is anybody hurt ?'"], [19, "A CATASTROPHE. 9 ' Yes \u2014 sir \u2014 Mr. GriniAvood, he is dead.' ' Good God !' cried Mr. StedAvorth. For a moment his face Avas convulsed Avith grief and aAve. The neAvs Avas evidently a terrible shock to him, apart from its in trinsic horror. But he made a \u00b0;reat effort to control himself. 'Is it certain?' he asked. ' Can nothing be done ? Who brought the neAArs?' ' One of the office-clerks, sir,' replied the butler, passing over in significant silence the tAvo first questions. ' Mr. Grinrwood's horse was Avaiting for him at the office-door, and, Avhen the news Avas telephoned from the factory, Mr. Robinson thought the quickest Avay of letting you knoAV Avould be by dispatching the messenger off upon the horse.' Mr. StedAvorth put his hand to his head as if beAvildered, and the butler, per ceiving this, Avent on to explain more fully."], [20, "10 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. ' Mr. GrimAvood had mentioned to Mr. Robinson this morning that he did not feel very well. He said he thought a ride into the country would be the thing most likely to do him good. He had to go down to the factory, but gaA'e orders that the horse Avas to come to the office at three o'clock, as he thought he had better come back there be fore starting for his ride, in case the head clerk should have anything to ask him after the second post came in. He Avas not back, hoAvever, by three, and by a quarter past this neAvs came.' ' But hoAV did it happen ? What sort of accident AA'as it?' asked Mr. StedAvorth, rousing himself from his first absorbed sense of personal loss and remembering his business. ' It AA'as no accident to the Avorks, sir.

He has been subject latterly to attacks of giddiness. At any rate, his coat was caught in the Avheel. It Avas im possible to save him. He Avas killed in an instant.' Mr. StedAvorth shuddered. He Avalked to the AAdndoAv and stood there for a mo- ment with his back to the room. Gib had gone into the hall to sniff at the mes senger of these evil tidings, and, finding in him an old but not particularly valued acquaintance, had come back immediately and now folloAved his master to the win- doAV, standing up with his forepaAvs against him and trying Avistfully to make out Avhat it Avas all about. Mechanically, from habit, Mr. StedAvorth stroked his favourite's head, then he turned round. ' Send the young man in. I had better speak to him.'"], [22, "12 A WOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. The young man Avas accordingly usher ed into the room, and Mr. StedAvorth ex amined him in quiet, business-like tones upon the calamity he had come to report. He had no more to tell than the butler had already told. ' Mr. Robinson thought, sir, you Avould come,' he concluded. ' Yes, yes,' returned Mr. StedAvorth, has tily. ' I will come at once. I had just ordered the dog-cart. Good heavens ! Miss Grimwood ! Has she been told?' ' I don't knoAV, sir.' ' Poor Honor ! Poor girl ! I had for gotten her,' murmured Mr. StedAvorth, half to himself. ' The dog-cart is at the door, sir,' said the butler, entering Avith a doubtful air. ' All right. I am going into Daningham at once. You had better ride quietly back,' he added, turning to the clerk."], [23, "13 A CATASTROPHE. Then he mounted into the dog-cart and drove off; Gib, of Avhoni nobody took any notice, trotting after him. The horse was a good one, and in less than forty minutes Mr. StedAvorth Avas at the factory. Signs of the catastrophe that had just occurred Avere evident in a relaxation of discipline and general air of disorganiz ation, although the whirr of machinery proclaimed that Avork had not been sus pended. Men stood about in the yard talking eagerly, and girls, Avith faces half aAve-struck and half-frightened by the pleasurable sense AA-hich any excitement, however terrible its origin, produces in uneducated minds, peeped from behind half-open doonvays at Mr. StedAvorth as he entered the vestibule Avhich led to the Avork-rooms.

The two former came forward on their master's entrance. ' Why have you not stopped the Avorks ?' was his first question. ' We did not know, sir, Avhat you Avould wish,' replied the foreman. ' Ha\\'e them stopped at once. In ten minutes the last echo of the jar and crank of Avheels and hammers had sunk into silence. In the meantime, Mr. StedAvorth was in terrogating all who could throw any light upon the occurrence. He elicited no thing more than the facts he had already heard. ' And where have you taken him ?' he asked at last, Avith a perceptible falter in his voice. ' We could not take him home \u2014 at least,"], [25, "15 A CATASTROPHE. not without consulting you, sir. He \u2014 he is hardly recognizable.' A strong simmer passed through the master's frame. But after a moment's silence he spoke calmly, giving clear and minute directions Avith regard to the present disposal of the unfortunate man's remains. ' I Avill make all arrangements for the inquest and funeral,' he added, ' but hoav I must think of Miss Grinrwood. Who is there to break the neAvs to her?' There was a complete silence for a moment, and then Robinson said, ' We thought, sir, that you Avould ' I \u2014 oh no ! Impossible,' Mr. Sted- Avorth ansAvered, quickly.

' Then there is nobody except myself?' ' Nobody so suitable as yourself,' re turned the head clerk, inexorably. ' Then I must do it. Is my dog-cart still there ?' said Mr. StedAvorth, Avith painful resolution. The dog-cart Avas at the door, and he got into it at once. As he did so his eye fell on Gib, aat1io lay on the stone pavement of the yard, still quite exhausted from his long run. ' I never told you to come Avith me,' said his master, gravely.

Once she rose to stir up the small fire Avhich the treacherous spring winds rendered it inexpedient to dispense Avith entirely.

Presently the sound of Avheels coming up to the gate caused the girl to look out of the Avindow. Mr. Stedworth's dog-cart Avas just stop ping before the house. She smiled and nodded brightly at him. ' Oh, bring Gib in,' she called out, as he"], [32, "22 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. pushed open the little gate, leaving the clog in the cart. Upon this invitation Gib jumped out of the cart of his oavii accord, and folloAved his master into the house. The girl Avent to the door to meet her visitor. The light on the landing Avas somewhat dim, Avhich preArented her from noticing anything unusual in the expression of his face. ' I am so glad you have come,' she said, cordially, as she shook hands AA'ith him, patted Gib, and turned back into the draAvino--room. ' I have been seAvino; all the afternoon, and am so tired of it.

Her deep mourning enhanced the natural pallor of her skin, and her usually serene eyes Avere heavy Avith anxious thought. Mr. GriniAvood had left a will bequeath ing all his Avorldly possessions of whatever kind to his daughter and only child. But upon investigation it turned out that his Avorldly possessions Avere limited to the furniture of the little hired house in Chamberlain Crescent, and its utmost value could not be estimated at more than a hun dred pounds. Of ready money there was about ten pounds in the bank, and there"], [45, "THE SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL. 35 Avere debts to the amount of five hundred pounds. This discovery occasioned great surprise to Mr. StedAvorth, who as the dead man's best friend had volunteered to help Honor in the discharge of her duties as heiress and executrix. He had paid his manager a high salary for many years, and had not unreasonably supposed he Avould have saved enough out of it to leave his daugh- ter secure from all pecuniary cares. Mr. GrimAvood had never been given to specu- lation or any other form of gambling. He had not been a man of expensive tastes. The only personal luxury he had eA'er indulged in had been his riding horse, and, to those Avho kneAv his income, that had not appeared an unjustifiable luxury. He had been a singularly domesticated man, never ceasing to mourn deeply, though unostentatiously, for the Avife avIio had d 2"], [46, "36 A WOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. been taken from him when their child was about ten years old. He had been a most tender and loA'ing father, devoting himself entirely to his motherless daughter. The more Mr. StedAvorth thought over the matter, the more beAvildered he Avas. But Honor had not been the least sur prised. She Avas Avell acquainted Avith the Aveakness of her father's character, though in her filial love and loyalty she gave it the name of virtue. Mr. GriniAvood had been generous to prodigality. He never had been able to refuse to lend money to a friend, or to throAV a shilling to a beggar. Hence the necessity for economical liA'ing, Avhich Mr. StedAvorth had ahvays attri buted, Avith silent approval, to his deter mination to leaA'e his daughter a compe tency. The silent disapproval, Avhich all his tenderness for the memory of his dead friend and all his consideration for the"], [47, "37 THE SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL. feelings of that friend's daughter could not entirely prevent his betraying, pierced Honor's sensitive heart with a very bitter pang. She had loved her father Avith all the strength of her being, and it hurt her cruelly to learn that he Avas thought to have been culpably negligent of herwelfare. The indignation Avhich her friends felt for her, and Avhich her mental sensitive ness made her quickly perceive and bit terly resent, was not Avholly groundless. For Honor Avas left practically destitute. She had seven or eight hundred pounds of her mother's, the interest of Avhich she had always had to dress upon, and no thing more, nor any prospect of ever having more except Avhat the sale of the furniture and her father's horse might bring her. But Honor Avas not the woman to waste her time in useless laments, or to sit help-"], [48, "38 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. less as long as there remained any Avay of helping herself. She had already given the necessary six months' notice to her landlord, and had taken steps to let the house furnished, if possible, for five of the six months.

But Honor Avorked on. Noav and then the blinding tears Avould momentarily arrest her progress Avhen some reminis cence of the past sharply defined the desolation of the present. But she Aviped them aAvay and worked on. It is one of the most merciful dispensations of Provi dence that, to most of us, days of bereave ment bring Avith them an access of Avork that leaves us no time for gauging the extent of our loss. A knock came at the door, and, in reply to Honor's ' Come in,' there entered Susan, the house-parlourmaid. Susan Avas a native of Scotland, and had the characteristic reddish hair and someAvhat harsh features of her country women. She possessed, likeAvise, much of"], [50, "40 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. the rugged honesty, the sturdy independ ence and shreAvdness proverbially attri buted to her nation. ' What is it, Susan?' asked her mistress. Susan seemed to have some difficulty in replying directly to this query. She stood pleating the hem of her apron for some moments in silence. At last she said, ' You gaA'e me AArarning, miss, last Aveek.' ' Yes. I Avas very sorry to have to do it. \u2014 Ha\\'e you heard of a place ?

' I can cook a bit, and Mary she says she'll teach me all she can. You won't refuse me, Miss Grinrwood?' ' Susan,' Honor replied, holding out her hand to the girl, ' I shall never forget your offer as long as I live, and if I Avere going to keep a servant I think I should be tempted to accept it. At least, if I refused, it Avould be for your sake and not my oavii. But I am not in a position to keep a serA'ant of any kind. I am going to take a situation myself,' she added, AArith a smile. ' I must go out as a companion or nursery governess, or something of the kind.' ' Lord preserve us !' ejaculated the girl. ' You a governess ! \u2014 And there's the door bell. Will you see anyone, miss ?' ' I think it is Mr. StedAvorth. I Avill see him ; but not anybody else.'"], [52, "42 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. The visitor proved to be Mr. StedAvorth, and in another moment he entered the room. He had necessarily been a frequent A'isitor during the last week, and Honor had come to depend upon him as the strongest Avoman is apt to depend upon the Aveakest man. She greeted him now with a grate ful smile. ' It is A'ery good of you to come,' she said. ' For I know that you have a great deal to do yourself iioav.' He passed this observation over in silence. ' I haA'e come to speak to you on busi ness,' he said. ' I haA'e been thinking OA^er your position, and I really do not think you ought to persist in your resolu tion to pay all the debts. You are in no Avay responsible for them.' ' Mr. StedAvorth,' Honor ansAvered, ' I Avould take your advice on many points,"], [53, "43 THE SHOULDER TO THE AVHEEL. but on this one my mind is made up.' ' Well, I anticipated this reply.' He sat for some moments looking thoughtfully at the carpet. At last he began again. ' Honor, I loved your father, and I be lieve he had a warm feeling for me. I have knoAvn you since your childhood. May I not Avithout indiscretion or giving offence ask you to give me the pleasure \u2014 the priA'ilege of paying this money, which is to me such a mere bagatelle ? Honor's face flushed, but she ansAA'ered, steadily, ' I am not offended \u2014 hoAV could I be Avith you ? \u2014 but I cannot accept your offer. It is my privilege,' she added, Avith a smile.

' Do you?' she retorted, Avith a smile.

But I cannot accept the means of liA'ing in idleness from you.' ' You are very proud, Honor,' he said, sadly. ' Oh, no ! I do not mean to be proud. If ever from illness or any other circum stance, I should really be helpless and in want, then I promise I Avill not be too proud to come to you for help. But as long as I can help myself I have no excuse for receiving support from anyone.' ' Theoretically, you are right.

' And I must be content to stand aside, a passive spectator of the battle, with the melancholy privilege of carrying you off the field Avhen you are \" beaten.\" At this moment Susan entered Avith a card Avhich she handed to her mistress. Honor read it. Her cheek flushed and her eyes brightened. She turned to Mr. StedAvorth Avith the first genuine and spontaneous smile that had crossed her face since her father's death. ' Green and Denton haAre sent some people to look at the house. And the board AAras only up yesterday. Is not that a good omen ? I take it as a sign that I am destined to succeed.' He smiled at her girlish triumph. ' Heaven grant it,' Avas his only reply."], [57, "47 CHAPTER IV. WANTED, A MANAGER. When Mr. StedAvorth left Chamberlain Crescent he Avalked sloAvly back to his office Avith bent head deep in meditation. Honor's position Avorried him. Her utter friend lessness gave him a painful sense of re sponsibility Avith regard to her ; painful because he Avas practically unable to help her. He had no faith in her poAvers of battling with the world. The circumstances of his oavii life and long-continued feeble ness of health had Aveakened his courage and developed a someAvhat timid and dis-"], [58, "48 A WOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. trustful habit of mind. He admired Honor's resolution and secretly applauded her in dependent spirit. He thought if success Avere possible to a woman she Avas the Avoman to AA'in it. But, believing it im possible, he Avas mournfully comdnced that she must be Avorsted in the struggle. It Avas not, hoAvever, Avholly of Honor that he Avas thinking as he pursued his Avay along the croAvded street. Mr. Grim- Avood's death had made some havoc in his oavii affairs. He had for so many years left eA'erything connected AArith the business to his manager, that the necessity he Avas noAv under of exerting himself to superin tend matters Avas not only exceedingly dis tasteful, but very perplexing. He found he had almost forgotten the details of the Avork. He AA'as perpetually being brought up face to face with some question he hardly kneAv hoAV to ansAver. The Avhole"], [59, "WANTED, A MANAGER. 49 thing bored him. He felt that he must have a neAV manager as soon as jjossible. The question Avas, should he promote Robinson the head clerk, or should he look out for a neAV man ? Prudence and a very strong doubt as to Robinson's fitness for the post urged the latter course, but his own inclinations and a shrinking dislike to being brought into intimate business re lations Avith a stranger suggested the former. His mind Avas full of the subject as he entered his private room at the office. One of the clerks folloAved him in. ' There's a letter, sir, that the groom brought in after you left. You dropped it in the dog-cart.' ' I remember, I had not time to read my letters this morning at home and I thrust them into my pocket unopened.

The clerk retired, and Mr. StedAvorth took up the letter. ' From Arthur,' he said to himself, as he broke open the letter. The letter, Avhich Avas dated from a city street in London, ran thus : ' My dear Mr. Stedavorth, ' You have ahvays been so kind to me, that I feel sure I shall not be pre suming too much, in asking a certain faA'our of you. I am leaving my present situation. My employer has lately mar ried an heiress, and his brother-in-laAV, having put a good deal of money into the firm, wishes to become an active partner in it.

I have almost resolved to take his advice, England is certainly overstocked, and though I believe any young felloAv with good health, energy, and ordinary abilities, and no ties, ought to be able to make his Avay anywhere, still the colonies offer a Avider field and larger prizes than the mother country can do. I feel sure of succeeding out there. Still I want, of course, to make as sure of suc cess as possible beforehand, and therefore I should like to get other introductions besides Mr. RaAvson's.

' The very thing,' he exclaimed aloud. He glanced over the letter again, stood for some minutes as if making mental calculations, and finally touched the hand bell on the table. ' Ask Mr. Robinson to come here,' he said to the boy Avho ansAvered it. Mr. Robinson accordingly made his appearance. ' Look here, Robinson, can you do Avith out me to-morroAv and the next day ? I Avant to run up to toAvn for a couple of days on business.' Robinson thought it Avas quite possible to do without the head of the firm for a Aveek if necessary, or even more.

Then"], [64, "54 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. he sat doAA-n and indited the following brief epistle : '\u25a0 My dear Arthur, ' I received your letter this morning.

After this he sent a line to Honor, to inform her that he should be aAvay for the next tAvo days, in case she should want him ; and then, haA'ing ordered the dog-cart, he droAre back to Elmdene Hall.

Gib, hoAvever, shoAved in his OAvn way the same dismay and astonishment that the rest of the household exhibited when it became known that Mr. StedAvorth con- templated a visit to London. It Avas such an unheard-of thing for him to do. The servants could hardly remember when he had last left home. The housekeeper had considerable doubts as to her master's capability of looking after himself. But, on expressing these doubts in the ' room,' she Avas promptly sat upon by the butler. ' A man as has travelled half round the world, as never stayed at home at all when he was young, not able to take care of himself in London ! Do you knoAV, Mrs. Thompson, it's only Avithin the last tAvelve"], [66, "56 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. or fourteen years that Mr. StedAvorth has took to living in England?' ' And why,' asked Mrs. Thompson, ' has he given up travelling altogether if he Avas so fond of it?' The butler made no answer to this ques tion, though he took care to intimate that he could answer it if he chose. Unconscious of the astonishment his present unexpected deviation from his usual habits created amongst his domes tics, Mr. StedAvorth calmly proceeded Avith his small preparations, and left for London immediately after breakfast the folloAving morning. Gib Avas prevented AArith great difficulty from accompanying him. The train was very full, and he found himself obliged to choose between tAVO carriages, in one of Avhich were tAvo ladies, a nurse, and a baby, Avhile the other was occupied by four noisy young men Avho"], [67, "57 AVANTED, A MANAGER. were playing cards. Both parties Avere equally distasteful to Mr. StedAvorth, but the first carriage was the least croAvded, and he decided to enter that. On his at- tempting to do so, hoAvever, the mother of the baby frowned so portentously at him that he had not courage to persist, and resigned himself to the companionship of the card-playing young men. Here, too, he Avas given unequiA'Ocally to understand that he Avas not Avelcome, but he took no notice of the broad hints so freely throAvn out. He seated himself in the furthest corner of the compartment, and unfolded his newspaper. It was im possible for a man AA'ho had lived alone for years, and had to some degree lost the habit of associating AArith the Avorld, to read amidst such loud talking and laughing, and he presently found himself surveying his felloAv-travellers Avith half-disgust, half-"], [68, "58 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. compassionate curiosity. Three of them failed to interest him. They Avere very young men of the gentleman-farmer class, and were obviously only Avhat they them selves Avould have called ' playing the fool ' OA'er their game. But the fourth Avas a man of a some what different stamp. He Avas not appar ently very much older than his compan ions, but had the air of being far beyond them in knoAvledge of the Avorld. He Avas remarkably handsome. The fine propor tions of his tall, muscular frame indicated a fitness for all athletic sports not often found in conjunction with height, and he had the sunburnt skin of one accustomed to live out of doors, yet it Avas impossible to imagine him otherAvise than completely at home amidst the most artificial refine ments of modern toAvn civilization.

His smile \u2014 for he rarely laughed \u2014 just showed the gleam of a very wiiite set of teeth, and, though sometimes curiously winning, it more often betrayed a satirical vein of temper. His blue eyes, well-shaped and of a fine colour, were placed a little too close together, and were too piercingly keen to be wholly pleasant in expression. He wras much quieter in manner than the other three, and appeared to take something like a real interest in the game, calling the others frequently to order, and rebuking his partner with considerable sharpness when that youth's heedlessness"], [70, "60 A WOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. lost them a point. But the quieter he was the more riotous his companions be came, until at last Mr. Stedworth made up his mind that he could not endure it any longer; he Avould sooner face the baby and its scowling mother. Accordingly, at the first station where they stopped he got out. He was not fortunate enough to find any freshly-vacated seats, and was obliged to inflict himself upon the aggressive matron and her infant, both of whom turned out on closer acquaintance to be very amiable specimens of humanity. When he had left the carriage, and the train was again in motion, one of the young men exclaimed, ' Do you know who that is?' Nobody knew and nobody seemed greatly to care. ' He is Ralph Stedworth,' continued"], [71, "61 W ANTED, A MANAGER. the speaker, regardless of the indifference with which his information was received. ' He is a near neighbour of ours.'

He is a great misanthrope \u2014 a philanthropic mis anthrope.' ' I didn't know before that you had Irish blood in your veins,' observed the man, wrho had interrupted before. But the mild sarcasm passed unheeded. Mr. Stedworth's neighbours went on. ' He is a manufacturer in Daningham of art stuffs, curtains, you know, and chair coverings, and that sort of thing.

The card-playing young men, being none of them afflicted Avith Aveak nerves, and being blest, moreover, AAith strong limbs and tough skins, escaped altogether unhurt.

The new-comer came promptly to the help of the distracted rescuers ; and, after a momentary survey of the situation, he swung himself Avith the easy agility of a pan ther on to the upper side of the overturned carriage, and looked through the AvindoAV to see his quondam traA7elling-companion struggling in a gentle and dignified man ner to release himself from the convulsive embrace of the shrieking female, Avhile on the other arm he held the hoAvling baby.

But he Avas blissfully unconscious of the fact. ' Hand me up the child first,' cried the young man to Mr. StedAvorth, Avho en deavoured to respond to the command, but Avithout success ; for, at the Avords, the mother redoubled her sobs and her grasp of him.

The lady made an effort to check her sobs and loosened her hold of Mr. StedAvorth, Avho immediately stepped on to one of the dividing arms between the seats and held the baby up to the young man. But the infant was less amenable than its mother to the voice of authority. It Avas frightened, and clung desperately to Mr. StedAvorth, burying its face on his breast. ' Come, baby,' said the rescuer, quietly ; and, leaning down, he took the child forc ibly from Mr. Stedworth's arms Avithout perceiving that the little fingers, in their aimless clutches, had Avound themselves tightly round the tAvisted ends of the chain, dragging out a large, flat gold locket that Avas attached to it.

The young man, who from his position could look doAvn on the water, Avas attract ed by Mr. StedAvorth's exclamation. He folloAved the little gleaming object in its rapid transit Avith his quick observant glance, and noted in that brief instant the exact spot Avhere it fell.

This Avas accomplished AAithout mishap, and the passengers in the next compart ment Avere also released. The hysterical lady Avent into fresh hysterics Avhen she found herself in safety, and after having Arehemently embraced her baby she shoAved a disposition to fling her self AAith as lively an abandonment of gratitude into Mr. StedAvorth's arms as she had previously done in her abandonment of fear. But he firmly though courteously declined these demonstrations. ' This is the gentleman to Avhom you OAve your safety,' he said, pointing to the young man Avho stood an amused spectator"], [82, "72 A AV0MAN IN TEN THOUSAND. of the scene, and Avith this he walked aA\\ray.

She Avas particularly attracted to one fairy nook beside a tiny rivulet and beneath the shadoAv of a moss-covered rock.

The realization Avas pleasant. But this idle life could not continue. Dolores must be educated, and Iioav? 4 1 should send her to the High School in Daningham,' Arthur said, to Avhom she propounded the question.

It was eventually decided that Dolores Avas to go into Daningham to the High School for classes three times a Aveek. On the alternate days she Avas to study at home, under Honor's supervision.

During those first feAv Aveeks she had feared that her presence in his house Avas terribly distasteful to him. But that feeling, if indeed it had existed, had passed. The extreme de pression that he had been suffering from appeared to be lifting, and he Avas regain ing the melancholy serenity that usually characterised him.

Honor looked Arery handsome in her black dinner-dress, Avhich shoAved up to perfection the AAiiiteness of her skin and the form of her smooth, beautiful throat. 4 Is he proud of her, I wonder?

She Avas glad, when she had shaken hands with her hostess, to stand aside unnoticed and try to take in the scene. She Avas quick to observe that her hus band Avas perfectly at home.

He Avas easy to talk to, hoAvever \u2014 perhaps to listen to Avould be more correct.

From livers"], [215, "AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE. 205 to doctors Avas an easy transition, and from that to hypnotism scarcely less so.

Arthur had made no idle boast when he said he could dance. Honor dreAV a long breath when they paused. 4 It is exquisite,' she said. 4 And yet you would have said you couldn't dance,' he observed. 4 1 \u2014 I surely did not say so.' 4 No. But you looked as if you were going to.

They found Mr. StedAvorth sitting on a chair just outside the drawing-room door. He Avas deadly pale, and appeared to be in a half-fainting condition. The room Avas empty, and, thanks to the consideration of his old acquaintance, no attention had been drawn to him.

Never again did she hear from his lips any expression that could imply distrust of her perfect con tentment Avith her lot, or a doubt of the profound depth and stability of this contentment. He resumed his usual Avork next day, and seemed to be as Avell as ever. About a week after this came a letter"], [224, "214 A AVOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. from Mrs. M'Donald, reminding Mr. Sted- Avorth of his promise that Dolores should pay her a visit, and urging that the promise should be at once fulfilled. 4 NoArember is not the best time for Scotland, of course,' she wrote, 4 but if Ave wait till the summer, Dolores will haA'e forgotten me, and I cannot submit to that.

The next day Mr. StedAvorth repented of his unreasonable objection, and insisted on Honor's making immediate arrange ments for Dolores to receive lessons on the guitar. The winter wore on.

Or Avas it that, in spite of her devotion to her husband, she Avas not really in love with him? 4 I need not assure you that I shall scrupulously regard your Avish,' Arthur replied to Mr. Stedworth's last speech."], [282, "272 A WOMAN IN TEN THOUSAND. 4 It has been a strange pleasure to me to write it,' the other went on. 4 1 think,' he added, with one of his melancholy smiles, 4 that nature must have intended me for a novelist, I haA'e Avritten my own story as if it had been some one else's story.

He had ceased for some time to walk upstairs. The servants carried him up the Avide staircase, and as usual he creeped to his room on Honor's arm. His prescience was accurate, he left his room no more. He sank day by day, surely but so slowly, that as each morning rose they said to each other, ' He may be taken before night,' yet, with every nightfall, they hoped for the morrow. Honor never left him. He liked to have her near him, to listen while she read in soothing tones that lulled him into sleep, to watch her as she moved noiselessly, but with no elabor ate effort at noiselessness, about the room.

Mr. StedAvorth's Avill AA'as as simple and as much to the point as it is possible for a legal document to be. The business Avas to be carried on under the joint names of StedAvorth and Stanton. Honor Avas to have half the profits and such share in the management as she and Arthur Stan ton should agree upon.

Honor and Arthur Avere appointed joint guar dians to Dolores. The Avill excited a good deal of com ment, particularly that clause of it which related to the guardianship of Dolores Dare. Mrs. Leland Avas especially em phatic in her denunciation of this arrange ment. 4 Poor Mr. StedAvorth,' she cried to her husband, 4 he Avas a good sort of man, but a fool.

One can't blame him. Young men AAill be young men. Honor is a very handsome young woman and rich. He always has hung about there a great deal too much. I do hope he will have the good feeling to leave off the habit. But I doubt it \u2014 I shall give Honor a hint.' But Mrs. Leland did not give Honor a hint. To say the truth, she and Mrs. Sted- Avorth were not quite such good friends as they had been in bygone days.

It is not that either is really changed, but the change of their relative positions alters the light and the perspec tive in AAiiicli each sees the other, and the neAv light is less becoming than the old. When Honor was poor and someAvhat friendless, Mr. and Mrs. Leland's parental hearts had gone out to the girl, and their kindness had aAA'akened a gratitude Avhich looked like Ioa'C.
