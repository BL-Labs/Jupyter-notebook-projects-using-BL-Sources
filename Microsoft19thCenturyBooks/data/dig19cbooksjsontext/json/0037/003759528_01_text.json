CHAPTER I. THE WEAR. Silence and snow \u2014 inseparable friends \u2014 had laid a dainty coverlet over the old cathedral city, and hushed its beating heart to repose. Snow on all things, gemming the boughs that shimmered in the moonshine ; blocking the country roads and stifling the sound of traffic in the streets ; fostering in the fields the seeds beneath its fleecy mantle ; clinging to window frames like quaint old alabaster carvings ; and pressing to its own destruction on the roofs near to the warm chimney-stacks. Snow on all things \u2014 on castle and cathedral, market and moor, tree and turret ; on all things save the river, and that it was not on but in ; for the stream which girds the city with translucent zone was swollen with the melting snow from many hills, and rushed onwards with a sound which made the silence more complete and solemn. Silence was in the air and on the ground ; the silence of nature, its universal homage to the white-robed spirit \u2014 Snow. It was the Christmas Eve which closed the century's second decade, and, through the length and breadth of the land, preparations to celebrate the morrow duly were making a merry noise in thousands of homes. So, in the north, B"], [14, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 2 where hearts are warm as the fires which glow upon their hearths, be sure there was no stint of the good things pertaining to Christmas hospitality. The pitmen's wives, by their huge caverns of fire, with gowns tucked up, were as busy and bustling as the cooks and mistresses of pretentious mansions, and olfactory organs might scent afar off as savoury banquets in pit villages as in the most aristocratic streets of the city; not so artistic, perhaps, but more substantial and quite as satisfactory. Holly and mistletoe had passed from hedge to hand, and hung overhead, or decked the walls and windows alike of rich and poor ; preparations were completed, and friends assem bled, or passed from home to home to \" see Christmas in\" and punch-bowls out, until it became a not uncommon thing thence to emerge unable to see clearly either Christmas or the way home. Shaped something like a horse-shoe, the river Wear, spanned by four bridges, girdles the city of Durham within so complete a curve, that a traveller from Chester-le-Street southward, traversing the city in as direct a line as practicable from the New North Road to Elvet, after crossing two bridges in his route, would be on the same side of the stream as before he entered a street or crossed a bridge. The rugged banks within the bend are steep and thickly wooded, the rock is crowned with ancient castle and cathedral, whilst the woods below, especially on the outer bank, are intersected with pleasant paths, charming little nooks for love-making, and dotted here and there with seats where strollers or idlers may repose in summer under umbrageous trees, and watch the bright river gliding past. Like Dovedale, it is a marvellous treasury for the artist. At every opening fresh views are visible, fresh combinations of natural and (here) architectural beauty, for the masons of monk and warrior have added a human interest to the grandeur and glory already given by God. Alike varied, romantic, and picturesque, the two places gratify the senses"], [15, "THE WEAR. 3 equally, but the mind is differently impressed. The hand of Deity isal one on one, the chisel of man has marked the other. Follow me, you who would trace my story, along the outer bank of the Wear, from the north, to meet the advancing sun. Enter from Framwellgate (the northern highway) the steep defile called South Street, where gloomy, unshapely houses, tottering with age, frown on the passer as only church property dares to frown. Take breath on the summit as you emerge from the shadow into the sunshine, beaming full on the now one-sided respectable street, and, leaning over the low parapet -wall above the banks, or descending to the river-side through the first opening, view with attention the magnificent prospect spread out before the inhabitants. Framwellgate Bridge, old and hoary, comes barely within range; but high up, across the stream, see castle and cathedral on the same foliage-clad stupendous base of rock, with the shining river for a mirror at the foot; and now, before we reach the Prebend's beautiful bridge, the stream is broken into a refreshing fall by the old weir, a mill at our feet, and opposite the veriest pigmy of a museum alone on a peninsula, looking itself more like a mill than a museum, with the water almost laving its walls, as though charitably disposed to wash away some of the dust deposited within. And now, having passed under the dry arch of the Prebend's balustraded bridge, we see the gothic water-gate by which it is reached from the clerical and collegiate quarter. Beyond this, white glimpses of the \" Count's Cottage\"* may be seen, like an ancient temple, amidst embowering wood and leaves, the river still shimmering azure, or golden, or green, as it reflects sky, or sun, or the trees which tower above, or overhang and dip their tresses like wanton nymphs. Castle and cathedral have lapsed into distance, for we have reached the full sweep of the curve, have both wooded steeps in view, and you are standing with me south of Durham, resting on the * See Appendix."], [16, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 4 rustic rail of the plank bridge in our path. Listen to the murmurs of the miniature cascade beneath, where two stream lets, hot and cold, issue from a coal-pit hard by, and leap or trickle over mossy boulders, steaming or sparkling as they rush under fringing ferns, and blend their musical waters ere they mingle with the Wear to lose their own temperature, yet not to warm the river one whit. Turn your head to the right, before the river sweeps beyond ken, and a little gate comes into the picture at the end of the shady path. It leads us to the quaint old church of St. Oswald, through a graveyard filled with slabs and memorials, in all shapes and positions. A walk between these crumbling stones, flung by Time's children into the maw of Eternity, and through the wide open iron gates, and we are east of the city, with the pavement of Church Street beneath our feet, bricks and mortar on either hand ; out of sight of the cool river and the dancing leaves, yet have our feet trod no bridge, save the plank which spans the runnels from the pit. This peculiar formation of the Wear may furnish a reason for the nomenclature of South Street, since it follows it. Although built above the west bank of the river, travellers going southward may wend that way without entering Dur ham's main streets or crossing the water at all. That is a street to try a horse or a nervous driver; the only marvel being that a vehicle is dragged up its steep ascent by any animal less ponderous and surefooted than an elephant ! Yet horses \" to the manner bom\" are driven upwards ordinarily, whether harnessed to cart or carriage, for the one hill saves two very little preferable in Silver Street and New Elvet ; the latter by another anomaly being an ancient looking, narrow thoroughfare, with dingy brick houses of many shapes and sizes, some low and some lofty, some with gable fronts and lattice windows, some up steps and some down steps, shops with parlour windows, and parlours which should be shops, and doors as diverse as the windows ; in short, all the picturesque glory of irregularity."], [17, "THE WEAR. 5 Old Elvet, which, situated at right angles, looks up the hill as if with a self-satisfied smirk, is, on the contrary, a broad open street, comparatively modern, or modernised by the abundant introduction of sash windows, panelled doors, and stucco, or painted plaster; though here and there an outside shutter carries one back to the period when this story opens. CHAPTER II. THE WAIF. Let the leaves fade and drop from the trees I have attempted to picture, let summer pass into winter, and the snow fall thick and heavily, whilst we return to South Street, and mount the summit of the steep hill in the light of the Christ mas moon. There, from the windows of a large old house overlooking the swollen and angry Wear, the light glowed through crim son curtains in the lower rooms, tingeing the snow beneath, or gleamed through the white blinds above, showing that, from \"garret to basement,\" Christmas kept his state. A babe had been baptised that day, and the season ushered in with a ceremony well befitting it; Mr. Marsh, a well-built, hearty specimen of the hospitable north-country gentleman, about thirty years of age, the owner of the house and the father of the infant, considering it the most auspicious time for so important a rite. His wife was a kindly little body, to whom he had been married four or five years, and this their first child. Baby Eva, a tiny pink atom of humanity, lost in a mist of lace and muslin, was the cynosure of the evening, mother and sponsors following in their turns. She was kissed and petted, fondled and admired, as surely no baby ever was before; and if not literally bom with a silver spoon in her mouth, friends took care she had no lack of such that day."], [18, "6 STUNG TO THE QUICK. Mr. Hesketh, her godfather, placed in a hand almost too small to grasp it, a costly coral and bells; whilst the god mothers respectively provided a richly embroidered robe and cloak for an infant whose wardrobe was already more than \u2022complete. Forlorn children shiver in rags ! Did the thought occur to these good ladies, plying industrious needles and straining their eyes in decorating the finest of muslin and merino, at how small a cost of labour and coin a poor child might be comfortably clad ? The point is debatable. Baby's eyes grew weary; she signified her aversion to kissing very intelligibly, so nurse (that important personage at a christening) was called in, and the bundle of lace and muslin passed to regions remote, to be disrobed and lulled to sleep on cushions of down beneath a silken quilt. Baby gone, song and dance succeeded ; merry games were called for by merry lips, games which made the mistletoe a necessity. The \"slipper\" was hunted, the \"trencher\" turned, the \" old coach\" door worn off its hinges, and \" Buff said ' Buff' to all his men.\" Then there was one of those lulls in the pas time, so necessary to refresh the panting players and prepare for further frolic, when even conversation is at ebb tide. Mr. Marsh had drawn his pretty wife into the recess of the window, and holding back the heavy curtains, bade her look out on the still night, which had somehow fascinated him with its silvery light. \" See, Eveline, how calm and peaceful is all without, how brilliant the moonbeams \u2014 how delicate the cobweb tracery of snow-wreathed branches against the clear sky ; even the solemn music of the river seems a p\u00e6an to Christmas! How beautiful, and yet how solitary and cold ! and with what a terrible rush the river runs ! What a contrast to the warmth and light within ! \u2014 Come, darling, let us close the curtains, something chills me, I hope,\" \u2014 what, remained unsaid. A piercing shriek rang through the clear air; \u2014 a heavy splash into the swollen river."], [19, "THE WAIE. 7 With blanched faces the startled guests, one and all, rushed out, and hurried to the riverside ; some by the ordinary path and steps close by; others, more adventurous, leapt over the low wall, down the rugged bank, crushing snow and brushwood in their eager haste. Neighbours, also alarmed, flocked to the spot, and in less time than it takes to tell, the paths and steep woody banks were crowded with white-faced men and women, rushing to and fro in wild confusion, earnest but helpless ; not the least eager the dwarf Count whose own days were well-nigh spent. Alas! the earliest there was all too late: the moon, gleaming so coldly, revealed a woman struggling for a moment in the stream below the foaming falls, and now, some distance down, hurrying onwards in that seething flood through an arch of the ancient bridge to that darker arch which spans the space between Time and Eternity. There was no hope of rescue : none ! The stoutest swimmer would have been a reed in such a flood; for the Wear, foaming and frothing in countless eddies, was like a seething cauldron ; and the poor woman \" gone to her death\" so sadly, as it were, in the very presence of mirth and festal, would be miles away ere morn, a swollen corpse. What was that dark object by the path, which Mr. Marsh stumbled over as he turned slowly to retrace his steps? \" Goodness ! that is the cry of an infant ! \" Surely enough, there, wrapped in an old check shawl, was a child more than six months old, with a wail feeble as that of one newly born. Securing the poor waif, kind-hearted Mr. Marsh hastened to the house, whither many of the more apathetic or selfish of his guests had preceded him, called \" nurse \" from the crowd, and gave the little orphan to her charge, bespeaking for it every attention, whilst they crowded round the fireplace to shake off their chilliness, and wonder. \" Give it to me, Charlie,\" said the compassionate voice of Mrs. Marsh. \" Poor little motherless bairn, I will be a mother to you ! \" and tears rolled down her cheeks as she removed"], [20, "8 STUNG TO THE QUICK. the shawl and revealed a babe, with large black eyes in sunk and purpled sockets, whose features, pinched with cold and want, seemed marked by that hand which had only now sealed its mother's eyes and breath. \" You surely do not mean to keep the dirty little wretch ! \" exclaimed Mrs. Hesketh, a mature bride of some six weeks, who had, as a last chance, married a still more mature widower. \" Indeed I do, if Charlie will permit me. How could I cast out the helpless little thing whose mother sank to her awful death in my very sight \u2014 on Christmas Eve too ? \" Mrs. Hesketh lifted her shoulders and eyebrows, and pulled down the corners of her mouth, but spoke no word. It was needless, the gesture was sufficient. \"Keep her, by all means, dear Eveline; she is a Christmas gift for you, a companion for our Eva. How know we but the light and warmth in our snug rooms, the sounds of music and rejoicing, jarred so harshly on yon poor suicide, worn with wrong, and want, and penury, that the very contrast goaded her to madness, and in despair she flung her child to our mercy, herself to the mercy of God ! \" \" Upon my word, Marsh, you are quite eloquent, and \u2014 quite right,\" struck in Mr. Hesketh, with a slight variation of tone. \"Still, I do not think /should like to undertake the charge.\" \"I should think not, indeed!\" sharply exclaimed his wife. \"What should we do with beggars' brats? The workhouse is the fittest place for them ! \" \"Mrs. Hesketh, we think differently,\" said Mr. Marsh, quietly. \" I am proud of my wife's motherly instinct, and feel that we cannot better close the day which recognised our child a Christian, than by performing a Christian's duty to the little outcast so thrown by Providence in our path. Provided no one claims her, she is henceforth ours.\" Mrs. Hesketh once more shrugged her shoulders in con temptuous silence, but just then the chimes came booming across the water \u2014 a deafening peal to welcome Christmas and Christmas charity."], [21, "THE WAIF. 9 Mrs. Marsh had meanwhile carried the poor morsel of life and rags to the nursery, fed it, and warmed its frozen limbs, seen it washed and dressed from Eva's ample stores, and when at length it fell into a calm sleep, blissfully unconscious of what it had lost or what it had gained, she returned to her friends; while the bells rang merrily out, and the ding dong pealed over Durham, wakening all sleepers but such as the one then sleeping in the waters of the Wear. The infant dreamed in its warm bed \u2014 did the mother dream in her cold one ? Speculation was rife at the abundantly-spread supper-table as to the who, what, how, and wherefore of the startling and tragic event of the night. But was there one amongst the guests who could picture to himself the scene enacted on the river's brink ere he reached it? Who saw the maddened woman, bonnetless and shoeless, as she crossed the city, seeking by her very wretchedness the shelter and comfort she was too proud to ask, and no Christian proffered, although it was Christmas Eve ? Who saw her crouched beneath the shadow of the lonely arch of the Prebend's Bridge, grawing a crust that had been flung to her; huddling her babe to the breast that could not nourish it; with wrong and outrage seething and surging in her brain like the flood beneath her feet \u2014 resistless, uncon trollable ? Who saw the gibing fiends mocking her misery \u2014 taunting her memory with thoughts of home, of all she had been, all she might have been, and all she had become \u2014 with pictures of feasting and revelry throughout the land, of brides and babes in perfumed rooms and soft attire? And then, who saw her rise and pace the path with hurried feet and frenzied mien \u2014 pause \u2014 hurry on \u2014 then turn and turn again, as rose or fell the impulse in her mind to hide her shame and sorrow in the wave, and save her babe from sin and sorrow too ? Who heard her prayers, her agony \u2014 saw the convulsive"], [22, "10 STUNG TO THE QUICK. clutchings of her infant, the passionate kisses rained upon its face, the torturing struggle to keep her child or leave it \u2014 her wavering, her wrestling with the demon in her breast, and lastly, the final wrench, when, flinging down her child, she left it to the world from which she fled in desperation? Ah, no ! Mortals saw none of this, and what they did see had not stopped the feast; albeit the ladies feigned loss of appetite, and all sat down as though half ashamed to sup so near a newly-made grave. But the Christmas bells were jubilant, their tones floated sweetly on the air above the suicide, the silence, and the snow\u2014 and Mr. Marsh's friends, cheered by the good things on the ample board, as well as by the rejoicing chimes, rose refreshed and strengthened against a sorrow not their own. The morrow brought Mrs. Marsh gossiping visitors in shoals to see the little orphan \u2014 visitors who made their comments, and pressed on from house to house, rolling their snowball of news until it o'ertopped the town, which became but an arena to discuss the sad catastrophe, and Mr. Marsh's right to think for himself. Grave divines shook their heads and sighed over the sin of suicide; untempted misses wondered if the mother had been married ; matrons speculated on the extra care and cost of rearing a strange young child in a household; their spouses on the folly of such self-encumbrance in a couple as likely as not to have a large family of their own ; the parish authorities congratulated themselves on being well rid of a troublesome burthen; and Mrs. Hesketh became pro verbial and prophetic on the occasion, asserting that \" the blood of the mother must run in the child ! \" and she knew \"no good would come of it!\" None, even the most captious, would, however, deny to the Marshes the grace of Christian charity, and they had that within their own breasts which rendered them imper vious to calumny, had it assailed them. New Year's Day brought to the church of St. Oswald,"], [23, "THE WAIF. 11 where little Eva had been baptised, another but more unobtrusive baptismal party, when the child of adoption received the name of Rhoda, to which Mr. Marsh appended the surname of Wearbank, from the spot on which she was found, no mark being on her clothes to reveal her own patronymic ; if, indeed, she could claim one. A week's care and nourishing diet had wrought a mar vellous change in her; the puny little atomy had grown plump and rosy, her dark eyes no longer gleamed from sunken sockets, the wailing cry had given place to dim pling smiles, and, apparelled as she was in robes befitting her new station in the world, none would have recognised in that healthy child the \" beggar's brat \" whom Mrs. Hes keth and others would so charitably have consigned to the workhouse. CHAPTER III. POISON. Years passed. No other children came to \" put out of joint the noses \" of Eva and her cousin, as she was called, the difference of age being 'so marked as to disprove twin sisterhood, whilst an elder sister's claim was still more ob viously inadmissible for Rhoda. Care and tenderness were bestowed on each alike; no possible distinction was made in their dress, treatment, or training. Only very close observation, coupled with a knowledge of the minute springs of action, could detect the difference between natural parental affection and that arising from sympathy and gener ous feeling. Mr. Marsh had enjoined on his dependents strict silence regarding the supposed parentage of Rhoda ; and his servants valued him too much to dispute his will. The girls grew up together, unconscious they were not"], [24, "12 STUNG TO THE QUICK. akin; slept in each other's arms, went hand-in-hand to the same school, affectionate as cousins should be, although they were in all other respects dissimilar as morn and night. Eva, a blue-eyed laughing little fairy, with a halo of flaxen hair around her head, broke into a shady room like a sunbeam, taking the unconscious heart by surprise; whilst with quiet step and voice, Rhoda seemed to claim her place in your regard with the assumption of an empress, as she shook back her tangled web of Ethiop curls, and lit her lustrous eyes. \"She's a strange bairn,\" Martin, the groom and gardener, would say in confidence to Nancy, the cook, \" ah de think there's summat uncanny aboot her ! \" \" Hout, man ! did ye nivvor see a bairn wi' black hair an' eyes afore, that ye mun call the poor thing 'uncanny'? Ye'd best not let maister hear ye ! \" would be Nancy's swift retort. A sagacious shake of the head, and the words, \" Nay, hinny, it's not her hair, nor her een, though they're wild enough, but her mouth \u2014 her mouth that's uncanny,\" would be his common reply. \"And what's the matter with her mouth, I should like to know? It's sweet enough to wile some young fellow's heart away, afore many years gang by.\" \" Ay, hinny, sweet enough when t' bairn's pleased, but her lips fit ower close to win me; en' ah've seen th' top 'un curl up, and t' corners spread, an' her een strike fire loike th' flints, whan shoo was put oot, an' Miss Eva wad not let her have a' her own way; an' nivvor a word of her mind can squeeze its way atween them barred doors ! \" \" So much the more to her credit, man. I wish all of us could keep our tongues between our teeth when t' temper's up. A still tongue shows a wise head.\" \" Ay, woman, but a wyese head on a bairn's shoulders is, ester all's said an' done, doonreet uncanny, an' ah'li stick te it.\""], [25, "POISON. 13 \" Hout, I've no patience wi' thy uncanny talk ; hold thy tongue for a born fool.\" Irritated Nancy would bustle about in her indignation, whilst Martin shook his head unsatisfied, and so the kitchen controversy, often renewed, and in pretty similar language, would invariably terminate. No echoes of these disputes penetrated into the parlour to disturb the perfect contentment of Mr. and Mrs. Marsh with regard to Rhoda, and as the two girls themselves never came into collision, no idea of possible evil in the future ever crossed their benevolent minds. They were not blind to the difference of temperament, but it created no surprise, the tint of Rhoda's skin faintly indi cating gipsy or foreign extraction, and the good pair only smiled at the loftiness of her general bearing ; whilst Mr. Marsh, always disposed to be humorous, appeared to see something comical in her childish grandeur and patronage of their Eva. For some time after her adoption, Durham, or one half of it, regarded Mr. Marsh as an innovator \u2014 an incendiary, who had brought a bombshell into their midst; but other people's private affairs drove Mr. Marsh's out of the public mind, and the matter seemed well nigh forgotten by the time the children were old enough to require playmates, or to give juvenile parties. Then the story came into circulation once more, and the first invitation created a ferment amongst the mammas. The grave question, whether Miss Wearbank was eligible to be received into respectable society, was mooted in various quarters, and gave rise to a variety of opinions, more or less warmly expressed. In most cases Mr. Marsh's position was a passport for his protegee; some few condes cended to permit the desired family intercourse, but not a few rejected the advance as an insult, and sent cold negatives to the invitations. The little damsels in short frocks and long trousers knew nothing of the serious point under discussion, and received"], [26, "14 STUNG TO THE QUICK. or visited their little friends in frocks and trousers in all the blissful ignorance of early childhood. And so matters progressed until the girls attained their twelfth year. It was then judged advisable to place the care of their education in more efficient hands than heretofore. Consequently, after some little deliberation, they were sent to a first-class \" Establishment for Young Ladies,\" in the Bailey \u2014 the aristocratic quarter, in close proximity and run ning parallel with Palace, Cathedral, and Castle. It was therefore within the curve of the horse-shoe, and, whilst its chief entrance was from Saddler Street (where a gate and portcullis once stood), there was a passage thence to the opposite side, either through the cloisters or under an arch way from Palace Green, by a pathway beneath the Cathedral walls, and so on over the Prebend's Bridge to the outer bank, or by another path beneath the Castle to Framwell gate and the city. Here, under the Misses Robson's care, as education pro gressed, the difference between the two developed rapidly; not that affection underwent a change, but character asserted itself. Eva learned, and learned well, as any tractable, intelligent child, desirous to please, might ; but Rhoda devoured know ledge, so to speak ; no task she was set but she would accom plish; difficulties she set at defiance, and her teachers regarded her as a marvel, although a sort of unpleasant awe mingled with their admiration. Work she disliked ; she would turn with ill-disguised contempt from the embroidery frame at which Eva sat for hours shading a violet, or giving the blush to a rose, or she would throw down her own needlework with a yawn at her own idleness. She was imperious, too, and had queened it over Eva so long by virtue of her stronger mind, and few months' advanced age, that she assumed a like position in the school \u2014 a position under protest; but Rhoda's will was dominant. For about eighteen months matters progressed much after this kind, since in all communities the strongest will and most"], [27, "15 POISON. active mind leads the mass ; then, after the midsummer vaca tion, a fresh pupil entered the school, when a change became gradually perceptible. The new comer was the only child of Mrs. Hesketh (there was a son of Mr. Hesketh by the former marriage, but he was of no account, and had been early shipped to sea) ; a spoiled girl, an exaggerated copy of her mother, with whom Mrs. Marsh had little intercourse, the distance between their re spective homes serving as a pretext for a domestic wife, in indifferent health, declining invitations, and neglecting to return \" calls.\" In truth there was no unison between the two ladies. There was a coarseness and vulgarity of mind as well as manner in Mrs. Hesketh little in consonance with the gentle spirit of Mrs. Marsh. She was, moreover, a busybody, de voting her leisure, and more than her leisure, to an active censorship and canvass of her neighbours' acts and motives, leaving her own \" glass-house \" unprotected. Then, too, she was a devotee of dress and fashion, to whom the trimming of a bonnet, or the shape of a sleeve, was of more vital import than her husband's comfort or her daughter's culture. She consulted not taste, but the Ladies' Cabinet, in the selection of her wardrobe, and might be regarded as a mil liner's walking model, copying the fashion plates in detail as infallible guides. She had a passion for much trimming and brilliant colours, carried away by a common delusion that to be expensively dressed was to be well dressed. As may be supposed, Mrs. Marsh had little sympathy with her conversation or pursuits, and, though the friendship of the two gentlemen remained undiminished, from that mem orable Christmas Eve when Mrs. Hesketh's tendencies were so repulsively manifest, their acquaintance gradually declined, Mrs. Marsh, a pure and high-minded woman, holding more aloof as her children became of an age to observe and receive impressions. The younger members of the tw.o families were therefore"], [28, "16 STUNG TO THE QUICK. little better than strangers; but there are no strangers in schools, and Rhoda soon found not only rebellion in her realm but a rival. Miss Hesketh had a will as well as herself\u2014 a self-assert ing, braggart will, and the school was split into two parties. Rhoda held her own with dignity; the interloper was younger, and she thought to put her down with her eyes, as others had been cowed. But she mistook her strength ; dignity is no shield from innate vulgarity or the spleen of a little mind, as Rhoda found to her cost. One day a dispute having arisen in the playground, Rhoda volunteered a decision meant to be conclusive, but Miss Hesketh stepped forward, and, with a lack of delicacy surely inherited, poured forth a torrent of invective which caused Rhoda to stand aghast with fiery eyes, and Eva to shed tears like a fountain. \" And pray, Miss Wearbank, who made you a ruler amongst us ? What right have you here, amongst young ladies ? Your proper place is the workhouse school: you have no business showing your airs here!\" \" My cousin has as much right here as you have, Miss Hesketh, so long as papa pays for her; and she is much more of a lady, I am sure!\" struck in little Eva, boldly doing battle for Rhoda, who appeared too benumbed by this unexpected attack to assert her own rights. \"Your cousin, indeed ! And don't you, little baby-face, know any better than that ? Why, her mother was a beggar woman, or worse, who drowned herself, and left my lady there in the snow, the night of your christening! My mother was there, and saw it! You needn't stare with your great black eyes, Miss Wearbank ! A most romantic name, surely\u2014 Wear-bank ! Who gave you that name ? Your godfathers and your godmothers in your baptism, eh ? Miss Rhoda Wearbank!\" The malicious girl gave a loud laugh, faintly echoed by some few of her own friends, whilst others, more humane, cried \"Shame, shame!\"."], [29, "POISON. 17 \"It's a great wicked story you are telling, and you ought to be ashamed of yourself, Lucy Hesketh!\" was Eva's tearful protest. \" It's as true as I'm standing here, and plenty of people know it besides me. You know it, don't you, Jane Sykes? and you, too, Bella Monks ? And my mother says her mother was something worse than a beggar-woman.\" The girls appealed to nodded in silent acquiescence, the buzz in the playground deepening as the partisans waxed warm. And what of Rhoda during this shower of tongue-stones? \u2014 what ? With blanched face, rigid lips, close-set teeth, and eyes like living coals, she listened as she stood like a statue of amaze and horror; then, without a word, rushed bonnetless from the playground, followed by the weeping Eva. Through the Bailey, across Palace Green, under the archway down to the river bank, over the Prebend's Bridge, she tore along like a maniac to their own door in South Street, which she flung open with impetuous haste. Darting into the presence of Mrs. Marsh, she gasped, \" Is it \u2014 is it true? Am I \u2014 am I \" and sank in a fit at her good friend's feet. Great was the consternation in the house, which was not allayed when Eva followed, out of breath with haste and tears, and gave a broken account of the scene in the play ground, choking her narrative with sobs. Dr. Grove, their medical man, tall and thin, grave and reticent, was sent for, and was promptly in attendance, but convulsion followed convulsion, mocking at remedies, and threatening life itself. And so, when Mr. Marsh came cheerfully home to dinner, he found the meal unprepared, servants running hither and thither, Dr. Grove biting his thumb-nail under his hand, in a brown study, and his usually quiet home converted into a scene of dire confusion and alarm. c"], [30, "18 STUNG TO THE QUICK. A mischief-making tongue, tipped with envy and malice, had done it all. CHAPTER IV. HOW THE POISON WORKED. Many hours elapsed before the convulsive attacks ceased. Then Rhoda lay in a state of nervous debility for months, watched over by kind eyes, and tended by gentle hands; the cause of her illness never adverted to, until she herself broached the subject, as she sat, propped with pillows, in an easy chair, by the parlour fire, one afternoon in December. Being questioned by the girl, then, as gently and tenderly as possible, with a womanly care lest she should inflict pain, did Mrs. Marsh unfold to Rhoda the circumstances attending her mother's death, the discovery of herself in the snow, with their adoption of, and goodwill towards, the helpless little stranger. Rhoda heard her to the end without a word. No thanks, no expression of surprise or gratitude \u2014 silent to the end, and then she closed her eyes as if for sleep. Mrs. Marsh felt somewhat hurt at this apparent insensi bility to kindness, and marvelled at her stolidity. What if she had been enabled to look beneath that placid surface ! What if she had seen the conflict between affection and wounded pride! Would she not have shrunk back in dismay? \" Not more envenomed is the serpent's tooth than is the slanderer's tongue.\" The subtle poison dropped from Lucy Hesketh's lips into the proud heart she wounded, spread and ramified through every vein and artery, so to speak; pervading the girl's whole being, and changing every kindly feeling in her breast to bitterness. In her wild flight homeward from school she had trod, in her agony, unconsciously the very ground over which her"], [31, "HOW THE POISON WORKED. 19 wretched mother had hurried through the snow in her agony, and up the path where she herself had lain, an outcast, the child of an outcast, more than fourteen years before. Had she imbibed in that mad race aught of her desperate mother's spirit and passion, her sense of wrong and injustice, that she sat so stolidly, hardening her heart against all which should have softened, opening it only to evil thoughts and rancorous feelings ? Sleepless, though feigning sleep, with immobile face, half buried in the soft pillows, this girl, not fifteen, lay calculating whether Mr. Marsh had benefited her in his adoption as much as he had wronged her in bestowing a name which perpetuated a memory and was itself a stigma ? Was it not admitted by her aunt that her wretched mother's doom was probably hastened by the sight and sound of revelry in their warm home, whilst she was shut out to perish in the snow ? Then she argued with herself, as wretchedness itself has argued for thousands of years, what right had they to luxuries whilst her mother was starving? Why should they mock her misery with light, music, and merriment, whilst she stood shelterless under the cold sky? They had taken her in! Well, it was their duty; they and their friends had tortured her friendless mother to death ; and they had better have left her in the snow to die also, than give her a name for idle tongues to taunt her with ! They had branded her with shame ! \" A beggar or worse !\" What could be worse, worse than to live on charity ? Charity ! her proud soul recoiled from it ; but worse ! What could Miss Hesketh mean ? There was no gratitude; no sense of benefaction; the blow dealt to her pride had struck them down. She had never asked herself why she lived with her uncle, or wherefore he maintained her ? Knowing only that she was an orphan, and having no memories beyond her home with her cousin, a sense of dependence had never reached her. Now it was thrust before her painfully, coarsely, and her distorted passions urged her to ignore her obligations to those who had brought"], [32, "20 STUNG TO THE QUICK. her up tenderly only to be wounded the more surely in the end. Had Rhoda been a few years older, more capable of reflec tion and analysis of motives ; had her judgment been matured, and her intellect developed, the effect might have been different, or had she been much younger, and incap able of coherent thought, the blow would not have fallen so heavily. As it was, she reasoned as a school-girl, proud of power, tenacious of her sway, impressed with her own importance, who found herself suddenly opposed and checked by another whom she had hitherto judged an inferior, and whose attainments and manners she had held in school-girl contempt. All the mud which lay at the bottom of her heart's quiet pool had been stirred in that strife of pride, and shame, and defeat, but the irritation did not subside with the occa sion; that foul reptile Revenge was hatched, and once in action kept the dark waters turbid. Yet Lucy Hesketh, shallow and superficial even in her mischief, exulted over a victory gained, a rival defeated. Greater generals have made as great mistakes ere now ! Unconscious that Rhoda nurtured a worse feeling than coldness or apathy, which might be the combined result of her convulsive emotion and consequent debility, Mrs. Marsh redoubled her efforts to rouse and entertain the invalid as she approached convalescence. Eva, dismayed at her cousin's unwonted manner, assiduously strove, with lavish caresses and many winning little arts, to restore her to cheerfulness and dissipate the cloud which hung over her. But all in vain. Mrs. Marsh was troubled; her husband anxious and solicitous; Eva was in despair; Dr. Grove \u2014 astute Dr. Grove \u2014 was puzzled; and Martin affronted Nancy by affirm ing grumblingly from day to day, that \"nowt ailed t' bairn but sulkiness! but what she hed te sulk for he didn't ken. All he kenned wur that she wur nut canny!\""], [33, "THE RESULT OF A CONFERENCE. 21 CHAPTER V. THE RESULT OF A CONFERENCE In the early stage of Rhoda's illness, Mr. Marsh sought Mr. Hesketh, in order to lay before him a statement of the occurrence, and the serious results of Lucy's wanton and unseemly attack on his niece, as he still continued to call her. His object, however, was not to reproach his old friend for wrong done by others, and which he could neither help nor remedy, but to devise measures for preventing a recur rence of the insult. Though not a man of acute sensibility, Mr. Hesketh (to whom years had given a certain rotundity of form and face) was a gentleman in feeling and manner, a lover of peace, though inclined to be choleric on provocation, and he had a genial good-nature little appreciated at his own fireside. He received Mr. Marsh with his wonted cordiality, and deplored that a child of his should be guilty of so contempt ible an outrage on decency. \" Indeed, my good friend, \" he said, \" I live in constant fear lest the unlicensed tongue of either my wife or daugher should involve me in some serious lawsuit or other. Only the other week, Maria and that gossiping Mrs. Coulson set afloat a rumour that Sykes could not meet his engagements, and was on the verge of bankruptcy; and Sykes came to me in a devil of a fury, threatening an action for libel, and the deuce knows what besides.\" \"Well, you could not blame him,\" said Mr. Marsh; \"the report caused such an influx of bills and a stoppage of credit, Sykes had much ado to keep on his legs.\" \" Blame him ! Not I. I was as as furious as himself. I tell you the two keep me in perpetual hot water ; yet Maria laughs all my remonstrances to scorn, and applauds Lucy's spirit"], [34, "22 STUNG TO THE QUICK. where she ought to restrain or punish. Their chattering and mischievous tongues poison our peace, and keep our house in a ferment, to say nothing of tears and tempests. \" Well, Hesketh, temper or tempest, I shall expect you to take Lucy to task now, and to speak to Mrs. Hesketh also, for her memory was at the bottom of the whole.\" \"Speak to them!\" ejaculated the persecuted parent, in a tone of dolorous disinclination. \"What will my speaking to them avail? You know as well as I do it will only be a fresh spur to their propensity for mischief? What can be done to stop their tongues?\" and the good gentleman paced about the office, biting his pen in pain and perplexity. \"Suppose I call on Mrs. Hesketh, and hold the forgotten rods of the Ecclesiastical Court and the Count Palatine in terrorem over them!\" suggested Mr. Marsh. \"Do you think that would produce any effect?\" \" I wish to heaven you would, Charles ! You would do me an incalculable service if you could only seal their lips. No man is more disposed to live peaceably with his neigh bours than myself; no man has a greater objection to thrust his head into his neighbours' affairs, and no woman had ever a greater talent for thrusting her husband's head into a hornet's nest than Mrs. Hesketh. Mere gossip is not sufficient for her; unless she can put a spice of mischief or malice in the dish, she cares not to hand it round. But go, go; say what you like, threaten what you like, possible or impossible ; she knows no more of law than I do of lutestring (perhaps less, for her draper's bills teach me something of that) ; threaten actions, imprisonment, anything that will but stop their tongues, and leave me in peace!\" and the perturbed though somewhat choleric husband rubbed his hands together in gleeful anticipation of the result. Armed with Dr. Grove's certificate, Mr. Marsh hastened to the residence of Mr. Hesketh, with a sternness of manner and purpose very foreign to his ordinary habit, being naturally inclined to jocularity."], [35, "THE RESULT OF A CONFERENCE. 23 At first, Mrs. Hesketh was disposed to be flippant, to treat the matter lightly, and throw the onus of the affair on Mr. Marsh's own impolicy in obtruding a beggar-girl into the society of young ladies. But for his just indignation she was little prepared. She had been accustomed to regard and speak of him as \" an easy, good-tempered, charitable sort of man, with no great harm in him,\" but she had never cared to calculate how much good was in him, or how much spirit lay under that easy exterior. Disgusted by her unfeeling and unwomanly reception of his first mild observations and remonstrances, he warmed with his subject, and a second contemptuous reference to the origin of Rhoda caused him to say \u2014 \"Mrs. Hesketh, Miss Wearbank's parentage is most likely as pure and good as your own.\" \" I should like to know how you are to prove it, \" retorted she. \" Are you, madam, in a position to \u00c6yprove it ? Until you are, I must maintain what I have said. Poverty and crimin ality are not necessarily synonymous. \" \" Aren't they ? \u2014 but they tread pretty close on each other's heels, I'm thinking; and a young woman wandering about with a bairn at her breast has not too creditable an appear ance. \" \" Who told you that the child was at the breast of the woman, or that the woman was young ? \" sternly demanded Mr. Marsh. \" Were you one of the many virtuous who, I understand, repulsed the poor creature because she declined to give her history, and refused aid to indigence lest you should foster immorality? If so, Mrs. Hesketh, the death of the mother lies at your door, and that of the daughter may. Miss Wearbank is in a precarious state, entirely consequent on the shock of your daughter's unwarrantable attack. \" \" And pray whose fault was that ? You ought to have taught the girl to know her place. Fancy a beggar-woman's bairn giving herself airs like a fine lady ! You had no business"], [36, "24 STUNG TO THE QUICK. to send her amongst her betters. If she had been kept in her place, and known who she was from the first, it could never have happened. Neither I nor Lucy are answerable for the blow to her pride\u2014 for that, I take it, is the real cause of her illness. And the arrogance of that chit has been insufferable. She did not seem to know whether she stood on her head or her heels ; and you ought to be thank ful to anyone who had brought her to her senses, instead of coming here to make a fuss over a quarrel between two children. \" Mrs. Hesketh reseated herself in the chair from which she had risen during her voluble tirade, with a toss of the head which said plainly as speech, \" you're not going to daunt me \u2014 take that ! \" Mr. Marsh \u2014 attired in a sober suit of bottle-green, his pleasant face overshadowed \u2014 remained standing, serious, as became his errand, and grave, in proportion as she was un feeling and flippant. \" Thankful ? Mrs. Hesketh, \" answered he ; \" Yes, about as thankful as a peaceful citizen when the first revolutionary bombshell bursts on his breakfast-table! Had this been merely child's play, you would have seen nothing of me. But I traced your hand in the mischief, and with you I have to deal. \" \" Oh, indeed ! \" from the chair where cap-ribbon bows trembled and nodded in spite of their concealed wires. He went on: \"Having reared and educated my charge' as a companion for my own child, having fitted her to mingle on equal terms with other young ladies, you will pardon me if I consider your daughter the inferior, and not Miss Wear bank. The vulgarity and narrow mindedness of Miss Hesketh degrade her below any of her schoolmates. \" Mrs. Hesketh bridled, the cap-bows trembled more palpably, a tassel pendant from one of her dress pockets was jerked off. She merely said, stiffly, \" Thank you, sir ! I am sure my daughter is greatly obliged to you. \""], [37, "THE RESULT OF A CONFERENCE. 25 \" But, as I said before, \" resumed he, \" my business is with you, madam ; you are responsible for the acts of your child ; her mind has been formed, or malformed, by you, and as you have furnished the poisoned weapon with which she struck down my unoffending niece, I come to you for all the reparation in your power. \" \"Reparation, indeed! I never heard of such nonsense. I suppose you want to send the doctor's bill in to me ? \" and jerk went another tassel. \" No, madam, that would be simply to mulct my valued friend ; I have no intention to dip into Mr. Hesketh's pocket to cure either yourself or daughter. Miss Wearbank is ill, dangerously ill, your child's unbridled tongue having been the cause. Should she succumb to the shock (as is not unlikely), Miss Hesketh is liable to be tried for man slaughter. \" The listener started, half rose from her chair, then resumed her seat, the first look of surprise fading into an incredulous sneer. But Mr. Marsh preserved his gravity, determined as he was to work alike upon her ignorance and her fear, since she was not amenable to reason, or to be moved to womanly regret. He went on : \" Should she survive, I shall require from yourself and daughter a full and ample apology for the aspersion cast on the child of my adoption, and not merely an apology, but an undertaking that henceforward you will restrain your \" \" I shall do nothing of the kind, \" blurted out his inter locutor; \" I am not going to be dictated to by \" \" Then, Mrs. Hesketh, I have no alternative but to place the matter in my solicitor's hands for reference to the Ecclesiastical Court, and to our good Bishop, Van Mildart, as Count Palatine. \" The lady turned pale, her hand sought her pocket and drew forth her handkerchief. Grim legends of that court and its formidable prerogatives floated upwards from the haze of childhood, when its powers and its precedents had their terrors"], [38, "26 STUNG TO THE QUICK. for wiser heads than Mrs. Hesketh's, and also the jurisdiction of the Count Palatine, with its power over life and death. \" There are still on our statute-books laws for the punishment of defamation and slander, as there were for the cure of scolding wives : remedies sharp but effectual. Since you, madam, have neither womanly feeling nor a sense of justice in your composi tion, I must resort to compulsory measures. The judges of the Ecclesiastical Court are not wont to be lenient to such offenders, I can assure you; and our excellent Bishop is to be feared as well as respected.\" All the flippancy was gone. This vague threat of a shadowy court with unknown prerogatives had filled her with appre hensions of she knew not what. With the natural cowardice of a little mind she shrank from the indefinite more than the positive, and collapsed at once. The ample pocket-hand kerchief of the period went to her eyes. \" I am sure, Mr. Marsh,\" sobbed she, \" I never meant to slander or defame either Miss Wearbank or anyone else; I never said anything more than the truth of her; I never slan dered anyone in my life; I am sure I never did.\" \" Gossip very easily degenerates into scandal, and scandal passes into slander much more readily than chattering women are aware. The injury you have inflicted upon my niece is not to be summed up with the doctor's bill : and I have no words to express my reprobation of your hostility regarding the poor girl, whether in the first instance or the last. Your daughter's conduct is but a reflex of your own ; a commentary on your maternal teaching ; and as a mere puppet I can partly exonerate her. For you, madam, there is no excuse. For tunately there is a law to reach the woman who stabs her neighbour's reputation and poisons her peace, as well as for the midnight assassin who preys on the lives of men. Branding or burning in the tongue is not one whit too severe a punishment for the offence.\" If this were but a strong expression of Mr. Marsh's private opinion, it was not so construed by Mrs. Hesketh. Taken"], [39, "THE RESULT OF A CONFERENCE. 27 by surprise, these indirect and rather apocryphal threats subdued the blustering woman completely. Utterly cowed by terror, her submission was abject, and when Mr. Marsh left the house she had offered to sign anything if he would but forego his intended appeal to ec clesiastical justice. So thoroughly had he been in earnest when denouncing the evil of unbridled speech, that his menace had all the force of truth. She suspected no ruse, saw no scabbard on the sword suspended over her head, and, as her husband had foretold, ignorance magnified her terror. To have taken counsel with her bosom friend would have been of no avail; what did Mrs. Coulson know of slumber ing laws? Besides, it would be owning herself worsted by \"those odious Marshes,\" so for once in her life she con sulted her husband. Of course he magnified the \" pains and penalties\" that clerical judges had the power to inflict; gave his friend Marsh a character for an uncompromising love of justice; stern and pitiless as Brutus, unyielding and unforgiving : a character the good man would never have recognised as his own. It answered the purpose. That evening, Mr. Hesketh (chuckling at a man\u0153uvre which promised peace at home for some time to come) carried to South Street a carefully worded document, signed by Mrs. Hesketh and Lucy, con taining all Mr. Marsh had required, and much superadded by the gleeful scrivener. But when he saw the change a few hours had wrought in the poor sufferer, his glee was turned to sorrow, and he felt that no enforced silence in the future could repair the mis chief wrought in the past. There is no mechanism so ingenious, no contrivance so subtle, as to pick up words once dropped. If there were, would the bulk of humanity appreciate its value ?"], [40, "28 STUNG TO THE QUICK. CHAPTER VI. CHANGES FOR LIFE AND DEATH. The Hudibrastic couplet, \" He who complies against his will Is of the same opinion still,\" only needs a feminine pronoun to express Mrs. Hesketh's frame of mind completely. Surprised and terrified into an act of justice, she repented the moment the pen left her hand and the formidable docu ment disappeared. Baffled and furious, she revenged herself upon Lucy, whom she not only chid as the cause of her humiliation, but beat with very unmotherly severity. It was no uncommon thing for Mrs. Hesketh to strike her daughter in a fit of caprice or anger ; but as the punishment inflicted bore no relation whatever to offences, wholesome discipline was unknown. She punished to relieve herself, not to correct her child. In proportion as she was exasperated with Mr. Marsh for coercing her will, with herself for yielding to coercion, and with Rhoda as the primary cause, so was she exasperated with Lucy as the secondary cause, and so Lucy was beaten. But the spirit the mother had so long admired and ap plauded in her daughter was a rebellious one. She struck at her mother again \u2014 blows, and words that hit harder than blows. This provoked severe retaliation, and then Lucy was sent to bed in dudgeon, no better for the beating. Mrs. Hesketh bemoaned her lot, and when Mr. Hesketh reached home at night indulged in a fit of hysterics. The Misses Robson reprimanded their refractory pupil sharply. There was some talk of expulsion; but after three or four interviews with Mrs. Hesketh, matters were compro mised, and Miss Lucy remained on sufferance. Of course, though the principals of the school were in no"], [41, "CHANGES FOR LIFE AND DEATH. 29 way accountable for the recent disaster, Eva could not be permitted to return to companions who might prejudice her young mind against Rhoda. She was accordingly sent to Sunderland, to be educated with the daughters of a clergyman who received a few pupils into his home to eke out a somewhat narrow income. Not until the following spring was Rhoda deemed sufficiently convalescent to resume her studies; and then Dr. Grove strongly advised sea-air; the farther south the better. If he had a reason beyond the restoration of his patient's bodily health, he prudently kept it to himself. He was a cautious man; never gave an opinion without sufficient motive or deliberation, and his medical dictum was decisive. Scarborough was named \u2014 Mrs. Marsh remembered that that was the Hesketh's summer retreat. Blackpool was pro posed ; it was too bleak : finally, Brighton was pitched upon as at once salubrious, distant from adverse influences, fashion able, and abounding with \" Establishments \" where young ladies might be \" finished \" on most approved principles. Mr. Marsh was desirous that the two girls should share the same advantages; but whether the mother's instinct told her that Eva would be unhappy amidst the frigid etiquette and ceremonial of a fashionable school, or that she had unconsciously imbibed something of Martin's undefined dread of Rhoda, certain it is that she opposed the plan, \u2014 and wisely. Eva had a heart to be cultivated, Rhoda, a head. Accordingly, after answering numerous scholastic advertise ments, Mr. Marsh made his selection, and prepared to accom pany his protegee to Brighton, undeterred by the distance. Eva- came over from Sunderland to spend a week at home prior to Rhoda's departure, bringing with her Mary Reed, one of the clergyman's daughters ; a simple-hearted, intelligent girl of sixteen. Mary was one of those unassuming domestic beings at home and of use anywhere ; so she was soon as busy as Eva,"], [42, "30 STUNG TO THE QUICK. providing and completing such little matters for the traveller's outfit as lay beyond the province of milliner or dressmaker; Rhoda herself looking on with apparently listless indifference. She was by no means so indifferent as she appeared. She watched with jealous eyes every article provided for her comfort or convenience, use or ornament, to assure herself whether she would be as amply supplied as Eva; she had never called her cousin since the truth had been forced upon her. Seemingly she was satisfied with the contents of her well filled trunks, no discontent being expressed in word, or tone, or gesture; and something of better feeling stirred in her breast as she spoke a word of quiet thanks, but it hardly brought a glow into her cheeks. And Mrs. Marsh looked in vain for any more open sign of interest in their proceedings, or gratification at the results ; and she sighed at a change at once so complete and inexplicable. Unsuspicious herself, and all unconscious of the jealous worm gnawing at Rhoda's heart, she was willing to attribute this seeming lack of interest in her own equipments to the listlessness occasioned by a long and debilitating fever ; nor saw the more fierce and dangerous fever raging in the soul, to the threatened annihilation of all that was good and noble. Had Mrs. Marsh been more a woman of the world, possessed of nicer discrimination, she might have discerned the minute shades of difference between this sullen apathy and the natural languor of debility. She might, with womanly tact, have applied a remedy to the festering sore in time; but the even tenor of her life, her owng oodness, and inexperience in evil, unfitted her to sound the depths ofthe strong nature in her charge. Unaware how deep and dark a tide of fierce passions (surely inherited with her blood) lay beneath that unimpressionable exterior, she saw not the black waters ooze and drip through the gap Lucy Hesketh had made in the floodgates of principle and affection, threatening in time to break down the barriers altogether."], [43, "CHANGES FOR LIFE AND DEATH. 31 Even keen-eyed Dr. Grove was baffled by the reticence of Rhoda. That something was wrong beyond the reach of medicine, he saw; but as his visits terminated with her actual physical ailments, his opportunities for observation ceased, and in the multitude of his professional engagements he almost forgot the strange dark-eyed girl whose case had interested him so unusually. As for kindly Mr. Marsh, he mistook her silence for melan choly, and strove assiduously to dissipate it by little pleasan tries, cheerful sallies, and short excursions to neighbouring places of historic or picturesque interest, under the impression that change of manner would follow change of scene. When the parting came, Eva clung to Rhoda, and kissed her with tearful affection, unwilling to let her go. Rhoda, undemonstrative Rhoda, with two red spots burning on her pale cheeks, kissed her quietly, then turned to give a parting embrace to her good, kind aunt, and shake hands with Miss Reed and Nancy; but no tears graced her adieus. Martin, who drove the travellers to Leamside (at that time the nearest station to Durham), looked after the retreat ing carriages with an ominous shake of the head, and the muttered words, \" I hope we may nut rue the day we fund that bairn; she's nut canny! she is nut canny!\" After a week spent in futile endeavours to rouse Rhoda from her seeming apathy, by efforts to interest her in the scenery around Brighton, Mr. Marsh left her at Milton House, with the hope, earnestly expressed, that the society of young ladies of her own age, who knew her only as his niece, would cure her of her morbid fancies, and the fresh sea breeze restore her to health and cheerfulness. Eva, so near home, often in her mother's arms, the recipient of healthful counsel and affectionate regard, progressed towards maturity with as fresh a bloom on her heart as on her cheek. Not so Rhoda! Lucy Hesketh had planted a thorn in her breast, which, taking root in fruitful soil, had been fed with gloomy fancies,"], [44, "32 STUNG TO THE QUICK. until she looked at life from under the shadow of the evil tree, and distilled venom from its leaves. All that had been done for her by her benefactors in singleness of heart, her distempered fancy changed to wrong and insult. In her removal to a distance, she conceived she was thrust out of their own home as if she had a taint upon her, they using her illness as a pretext. She utterly ignored the fact (which met her at every turn) that Mr. Marsh was paying almost double for her education than what Eva's cost him. For some time after her entrance at Milton House, she held herself aloof, brooding over her isolation, her dependence on charity, her unknown parentage, her namelessness \u2014 her future. Her future ! she must prepare for it, whatever it might be. Suddenly, as from a tomb, her old passion for knowledge revived ; she became the paragon of her preceptors, the envy of her schoolmates \u2014 every additional accomplishment was a fresh power, a new lever for the future. She \" must be finished ! \" There was in the school a pupil-teacher, a pale, shy girl who shrank into corners to con such lessons as she had leisure to learn \u2014 a girl glanced at scornfully by some, regarded compassionately by others, but who held on her quiet way timidly and uncomplainingly. Rhoda, roused to observation, detected this. It was buzzed about that Miss Talbot bore her mother's name only, and why ; and then it was that Rhoda learned what was worse than beggary. From that time forth Rhoda took the pupil-teacher under her protection. There was a bond of sympathy between them she feared to reveal, yet which existed nevertheless, unknown to all around; a bond never to be broken while Rhoda breathed. But in the petty insults heaped on Miss Talbot, insults not to be resented, Rhoda saw all the odium attached to an unwedded mother."], [45, "CHANGES FOR LIFE AND DEATH. 33 The possibility that Lucy Hesketh had a foundation for her taunt ate into her heart like a canker. And as the hideous possibility rose before her from the mist in all its grim significance, a shadowy purpose rose by its side, dim and undefined, to take shape at some future day. Distance barred vacations. Once her aunt and uncle made a summer trip to Brighton to see her, and share a pleasant holiday, and once Eva accompanied her father ; but Rhoda had never seen home, or asked to return. Miss Talbot had no vacations, they companioned each other. Before the expiration of her third year, she was hastily summoned back. Mrs. Marsh, long an invalid, was on her death-bed. Surely, then, some feeling of grateful remembrance filled her soul, some sorrow for the matchless friend she was about to lose ? No ! Malign memories had spun thick cobwebs over kindness past, and anger at her recall from the school where she held undisputed pre-eminence, and where she had one worshipper, to a state of dependence and humdrum household duties, with possible contumely looming in the distance, crushed back all softer feelings, and thrust a polished semblance in the place of grateful love. The establishment was too fashion able for the cultivation of feelings and affection ; the intellect, deportment, accomplishments, and refinement, were alone the care of the polite lady at its head, or her auxiliaries. So, when the train arrived at Leamside a little before the time, and Martin a few minutes too late, she chafed at what she construed into a premeditated slight, and at once pro ceeded with haughty independence to discuss with the rail way porters and a gentleman who had been a fellow-passenger from London, the possibility of obtaining at so late an hour a conveyance for herself and luggage. As Martin drove up, his first glance fell upon two glittering eyes set in a stony face (he saw the stately figure afterwards), and involuntarily he ejaculated, \" I hope that's nut Miss Rhoda!\" D"], [46, "34 STUNG TO THE QUICK. She recognised him as he advanced, and the look passed like magic from her face; but the old man never forgot it\u2014 never! He thought of nothing else all the way home. So absorbed was he in his own reflections that the few questions Rhoda put to him were answered almost at random. Fortunately the horse was sure-footed, and knew the road as well as his driver, for he was driven mechanically, but he went up hill and down dale, or turned the sharpest of sharp comers, without a stumble. To his unfailing confidante Martin disburthened his mind of its disagreeable impressions, but the sympathy he obtained was an impatient shake of Nancy's shoulders, and the hasty exclamation, \" Hout, man, dinnot thee deave me with thy megrims, the bairn's all right enough an' thou'll let her a' be.\" So Martin marched off to the stable, muttering to himself, and reposing in Towzer, his bull-terrier, the remainder of his rejected confidence. With all a father's kindliness and affection, Mr. Marsh welcomed Rhoda, subdued, however, by the dark shadow brooding over his life and home. Eva clasped her slender arms round her cousin's neck and wept aloud, half in welcome and half in grief; and the floodgates of her tears once opened, they flowed freely. The frail invalid, at whose desire she had been summoned, smiled faintly when she entered the sick chamber, and extended her hand to the child of her adoption, then a tall and stately girl close upon eighteen, with self-possession in every lineament. Her own bearing was sufficiently cordial, no coldness or constraint of manner lingering to repulse her warm-hearted relatives (such they felt themselves), though her return to the home of her childhood was marked by no emotion of delight or gratification, and she resumed her position in the household as one who had been absent weeks only, not years. During the few days Mrs. Marsh lingered, Rhoda consti-"], [47, "CHANGES FOR LIFE AND DEATH. 35 tuted herself chief nurse, waiting upon her with such gentleness and assiduity, such apparent devotion, that Nancy could not forbear to confide her opinion to Bella and Martin that \"she would be a treasure in the house, so handy and thoughtful like, wi' the forecast of an old woman, with a hand like velvet, an' a voice so soft an' affable, it was quite a delight to hear her! \" \" Hout ! \" growled Martin, \" the cat's paw, and the cat's purr ; don't be a fool, Nance ! \" It was evident to all that Mrs. Marsh was sinking rapidly, and on the fourth day after Rhoda's return, Dr. Grove was sent for suddenly, that change, so well known to those who have watched the dying, having passed over her face. As he noiselessly entered the sick chamber, Mrs. Marsh was speaking in a low faint voice to Rhoda, reminding the girl that she had been to her a mother, and charging her to do her duty as a sister and a daughter to those she left behind. Rhoda's promise was given readily, but a something, unseen to others, flashed over the perceptions of the dying woman \u2014 she struggled to rise, pushed Rhoda back, gasped heavily, \" Charles \u2014 Eva, beware ! \u2014 don't trust \" and fell back dead. Dead ! The word strikes on the ear of affection like the knell of hope, no matter how long the watchers have sat by the bed of the dying, waiting and dreading the cold word, \" dead ! \" It comes with a sudden shock at the last, startling grief from its secret caverns, and with torpedo touch benumbing every sense save sorrow. Thus it was that in the sudden shock occasioned by their bereavement, father and daughter failed to catch the import of their lost one's hasty words; and even in their after-sorrow. when memory recalled them, it was but as a dying hallu cination. Rhoda, whose grief lay nearer the surface, and whose per ceptions never slept where self was concerned, heard the brief"], [48, "36 STUNG TO THE QUICK. warning with a tingling brain and a cleft heart \u2014 heard it and ground her teeth. Dr. Grove, too, keen and astute, who had felt the girl's pulse, and marked her well through all her prolonged strife with death years before, heard the warning words, felt their full force, and kept them in his mind, loth to disturb Mr. Marsh's confidence in the child he had reared so benevo lently, yet dreading some unknown mischief from his reticence. And so, Rhoda's benefactress died and was buried, and tearless Rhoda, cancelling all obligations, cast into the grave gratitude, and love, and duty, and they were buried too ! CHAPTER VII. THE LASS THAT LOVES A SAILOR. After the funeral, Mary Reed came to spend a short time in the cathedral city as a companion to Eva and Rhoda. She was a gentle, amiable girl, and her presence served to dull the edge of grief in the two hearts which sorrowed most, her sympathy being as certain and genuine as it was unobtrusive. Even Martin, Nancy, and Bella, faithful servants of a good mistress, deploring and grieving at her loss, felt the soothing influence of Mary's voice and ministry. As for Rhoda, she sought no solace \u2014 needed none for herself, had none to yield to others: true, with her mourn ing-garb she wore a mourning face, and there was trouble in her heart, but it was for herself, not for the dead. She looked out from the windows of her home only to see the flowing river, and ask, \" Where was her mother's grave ? who ministered to her in her last hours ? what funeral obsequies were hers? She looked down on the spot where she herself, the very waif of the Wear, was left to chance"], [49, "THE LASS THAT LOVES A SAILOR. 37 or charity. Charity ! She scorned it, as she was scorned by all who knew her origin. And here was she, brought home to be the scoff of gossips, to look down, day by day, on those reminders of her degradation \u2014 the river and its bank Why should that wooded steep be hateful in her sight more than in Eva's ? Why should she be the daughter of the out cast, Eva the daughter of a dowered bride ? and being so, why bring her there for fools to mock and scorn ? a foil to Eva \u2014 a living monument to Mr. Marsh's charity. Even the poor curate\"'s daughter had an enviable lot beside hers ; there was no taint on her birth, no obligation for her main tenance, no dependence in past or future.\" And this was Rhoda's sorrow. Eva's state was true, and hers fictitious. Eva's fortune sure; her fortune, chance or charity. Eva's name, an honourable and unsullied one; her own, the brand of outcast impurity. Between Mary and Rhoda a species of instinctive antipathy arose \u2014 a sort of latent moral antagonism, which neither could account for nor control. Mary sought to subdue the feeling as illiberal and ungener ous; but Rhoda contented herself with concealing dislike under a bland and suave exterior, endeavouring to ingratiate herself with the clergyman's daughter, as with others, by little courtesies and delicate attentions, which Eva, dear, genuine Eva, loving her friend with honest warmth, never dreamt of, not being on the watch to prove that which was undoubted. One day, Mary received a letter from home \u2014 not that the arrival of a letter from home was an event so rare as to call for special notice, even though the penny postage did not then exist, and a Sunderland letter cost fourpence; nor did this epistle contain domestic intelligence of more than average interest ; \u2014 but there was a postscript \u2014 a postscript which brought the warm blood mantling to Mary's face, and a mois ture to her hazel eyes, which might have been mistaken for tears had she not looked so radiantly happy. Whilst she and Eva were closeted together, discussing this"], [50, "38 STUNG TO THE QUICK. important addendum to an unimportant epistle, the reader, privileged to look back into the past, or forward into the future, may glance over their shoulders and decipher it. \"The 'Polly' has just entered the harbour. When may we expect you home?\" Two very laconic and apparently disconnected sentences; but the feminine bustle which ensued thereupon proved a particularly intimate relation between them. The \" Polly\" was but a thing of planks and pitch, copper and cordage, called by amphibia \"a barque\"; but the barque had a crew, and the crew a captain (the self-same son of Mr. Hesketh who had been shipped to sea so young), and that captain had been specially devoted to Mary Reed for more years than they could count, though she was barely twenty, and he but six or seven years her senior. \"Papa, Mary is expected home,\" was Eva's salutation to Mr. Marsh on his return from his daily walk into the City. \" Oh, ah ! so I suppose. The ' Polly' is in port. You sly little puss; somebody else has shipping news besides Mary.\" \"Why, papa, however could you know anything about it?\" \" Simply because I happen to know Cuthbert's father, and he told me ! You need not blush so very violently, Miss Reed ; we know all about it ; and both old gentlemen are very discreet, I assure you. When do you wish to set off? Shall I bespeak a special train, or will the express serve ?\" \"Now, papa, don't be such a tease.\" \" I did not speak to you, Miss Eva, but to rosy Mary. Well, will the express serve?\" \" Oh, Mr. Marsh, any train ; but I want Eva to accompany me.\" \" And Rhoda ?\" asked Mr. Marsh, unwilling that she should feel herself excluded. \" And Rhoda also, if she can accommodate herself to the homely arrangements of our old-fashioned place,\" responded Mary, though with a secret shrinking she could neither define to herself nor defend."], [51, "THE LASS THAT LOVES A SAILOR. 39 With many gracefully-worded expressions of fear lest she should inconvenience Mrs. Reed, to whom she was personally a stranger, Rhoda accepted the tardy invitation from motives peculiarly her own; jotting down in her mental note-book that it zvas tardy. Under the playful conversation held in her presence, there was some little mystery to which she did not hold a clue. It might have been withheld from her purposely \u2014 it might have been from the accident of her long estrangement from home ; in any case, if she made one of the party, the secret, though only a love story, should soon be hers to use as she saw fit. Not that she then contemplated mischief; but hers was that unhealthy frame of mind which, brooding over its own wrongs and sorrows, regards itself as isolated from the rest of the world, shut out from sympathy, beloved by no one, tolerated only by those with whom she came in daily contact, and on whose care or protection she had no positive claim. She felt herself a cipher in the presence of Mary and Eva, notwithstanding her superior accomplishments ; felt that they had in their free and congenial intercourse confidences she did not share. She longed for something to break the mono tony of her life, to occupy her mind, and yearned once more for activity and power. Less luggage, and consequently less packing, was required in those days of short untrimmed skirts than in these \u2014 only amplitude of garment requiring amplitude of space ; and as all three wore deep mourning \u2014 Mary out of sincere regard for Mrs. Marsh \u2014 their arrangements were soon completed. Martin was sent off over-night with the boxes to the sta tion, Mr. Marsh himself driving the young ladies in time to meet an early morning train. On the platform at Leamside, in earnest conversation with the station-master, stood a gentleman of elegant exterior, whose age might be about three-and-twenty. His form was graceful and well-proportioned, his features singularly pre-"], [52, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 40 possessing, and round his ample forehead clustered a mass of wavy hair, black as his garb. With a slight smile of recognition he raised his hat respect fully as our party passed, and Rhoda gracefully inclined her head in acknowledgment. \"Who is the gentleman you bowed to, Rhoda?\" asked Mr. Marsh. \" Oh, he travelled in the same carriage with me all the way from London, and was extremely polite and attentive. I have met him in the town several times since. \" \"Did you happen to learn his name? His face seems strangely familiar to me. \" \" Yes ; there were brass plates on all his luggage, and I read ' F. Raeburn' on a small valise he carried with him. \" \" Dear me, how remarkable ! He must be my old friend's nephew ! I thought he resembled some one I knew. He has come into a fine estate. Don't you remember old Mr. Raeburn, who used to bring dolls and candy to buy kisses with ? \" \" I do, papa, \" replied Eva, \" and I should think Rhoda would ; but to be sure \" The rush of the train to the platform, and of passengers to their seats, cut Eva's speech short; but she did not fail to observe that the eyes of the stranger had followed their movements ; and the observation furnished matter for girlish merriment during a good part of the journey. Rhoda was rallied on her conquest of a \"mysterious stranger, \" a \" count in disguise, \" and her secrecy was voted to be a direct evidence against the state of her heart, she of course disclaiming the \" soft impeachment, \" though evidentlv pleased with the importance it gave her, if nothing more. In the midst of their fun Eva expressed an opinion that it \"was not fair Rhoda should have the beau all to herself; if she did not care for him, they had better draw lots which he should belong to ! \" \" Come between us if you dare ! \" said Rhoda's eyes in a"], [53, "THE LASS THAT LOVES A SAILOR. 41 flash. \" You are welcome to him altogether, if you want him, \" said her flexile lips and finished tongue. The subject dropped soon after, Mary seeming pre-occupied and anxious to reach home, and Eva \" wondering if any one would meet them. \" The stranger passed from their minds completely. If he retained a place in Rhoda's she hid him there, for no one knew. \" Sunderland \"at last!\" exclaimed Mary, as the engine screeched, and gave a few preliminary puffs before stopping. \" Sunderland at last, and no one to meet us ! \" \"No one! yes, here is your father!\" interposed Eva, pushing through the crowd towards the clergyman who was peering into all faces and carriages but the right one. \" Rhoda, I must introduce you; our disconsolate Mary will forget us else. Dear Mr. Reed, I am so glad to see you! This is my cousin Rhoda. \" A few greetings, a few compliments, and a vehicle was summoned to transport the reverend gentleman, fair ladies and their belongings, to his domicile ; Eva rattling merrily as they went along, whilst Mary sat silent, with a question in her heart which died ere it could reach her lips. Mary's younger sister Maggie stood on the threshold to receive them. The whispered words, \" In father's study, \" answered the unspoken question, and Mary herself disappeared somewhat precipitately, leaving her guests to other care. Nor was other care wanting : Eva was evidently at home, and Mrs. Reed, a quiet matron, with pleasant smile and cheerful voice (of whom Mary was but the younger counter part), did her utmost to render Rhoda at home also. They had divested themselves of their travelling attire, and dinner had been ready some time, but Mary had not made her appearance. At length Eva, laughingly protesting that her appetite would be gone if she waited much longer, volunteered to go in quest of the truant, and after a little while returned in triumph with Mary, blushing like a carnation, and a frank sun-burned"], [54, "42 STUNG TO THE QUICK. sailor, whom she solemnly and with mock gravity introduced to Rhoda as \"Captain Cuthbert Hesketh, Miss Reed's most particular friend ! \" Did a wasp sting Rhoda that she started so perceptibly at the introduction \u2014 or was it only one of those convenient spasms she had been subject to since a Hesketh stung her first, and poisoned all the blood in her heart ? Whatever it might be, she recovered speedily, and Eva never remembered an occasion on which her cousin more successfully exercised her power to please, or was so irresist ibly fascinating. After the dinner the piano was opened, and \" Miss Wear bank obliged Captain Hesketh.\" There had been no music in Mr. Marsh's house since his wife's death, so that Eva and Mary were alike unprepared for the flood of melody which filled the room as Rhoda's fingers swept the keys; she seemed to infuse her soul into the theme, which now swelled into a triumphant p\u00e6an, anon sank into a tremulous wail of desolation ; then the chords rose again at once jubilant and defiant. Cuthbert Hesketh seemed entranced. Mr. Reed said he did not think there had been so much music in the old instrument; and all expressed most unquali fied delight. Perhaps, however, at the bottom of Mary's heart there might have lurked a little \u2014 a very little spice of envy or chagrin ; for, although a model of amiability, Mary was but mortal, and to her Cuthbert appeared a trifle more fascinated than was altogether proper. Eva protested that \"Rhoda had almost taken her breath away with surprise, but as she regarded that music-stool as the pedestal proper of herself and Mary, she would embroider a new throne for the pianist extraordinary, the strummers in ordinary resuming possession of their own,\" and sat down to rattle away at a new polka, with a heart as light as the air she played."], [55, "43 THE SPIDER AND THE FLY. With some little reluctance, being nervous, and unused to play before strangers, Mary took the seat Eva vacated. Her voice was sweet, if not highly cultivated. She sang the old ballad, \"Mary's Dream,\" in which a young girl sees the white face of her sailor lover who has been drowned, \" far, far at sea,\" and sang it with such touching pathos that a tear stole down the bronzed cheek of Cuthbert, and for getting alike place and propriety, he pressed a hearty kiss on Mary's lips. Rhoda's fascination was over for that day. Until the \" Polly \" had discharged her cargo, Cuthbert's duty lay in the dock, so he hurried off, conscious he had remained love-bound a little longer than business warranted ; whilst Mary, more meditative than her wont, hastened to relieve her mother of the extra household cares consequent on the sudden introduction of a stranger into a family with only one servant. CHAPTER VIII. THE SPIDER AND THE FLY. The two visitors and Mr. Reed were left to bear each other company in the low-ceiled drowsy parlour, the smooth walls of which had once been painted a bright green, but then had \"toned down\" into a dingy olive; as sombre, almost, as the Brussels carpet, from which colour and pattern were wearing fast away. The good clergyman sat in his customary arm-chair near the fire-place, although there was no fire (the season being unusually warm), and a grate-apron of coloured tissue paper, cut into porcupine points, covered the cold bars. Sum mer or winter Mr. Reed sat there from habit, and Eva, bring ing the music-stool from the piano, seated herself beside him for a comfortable social chat."], [56, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 44 So short a period had elapsed since her pupilage, that the conversation naturally became somewhat catechetical and scholastic. Thence it strayed to the cause which had removed Eva from his care, namely, her mother's illness; and as he spoke of the recent dispensation to inculcate Christian hope and faith, Eva's eves filled. Young and buoyant, her mournful tears were soon dried; then her glance, wandering around the room, discerned amongst the cases of foreign birds, Indian baskets, shells and coral, which decorated the square piano, the walls, and shelf sideboards, something new, which Cuthbert (whose gifts all these were) had brought home on his recent voyage. It was nothing more than an ordinary pickle-bottle; but it contained something closely resembling freshly-gathered cranberries with the stalks attached. Eva jumped from her stool to examine it closely, then returned to have her ignorance enlightened and her curiosity satisfied. It was a fine specimen of gulf-stream weed, preserved in its native sea water. Many of the small pinky globules were encrusted with coraline, the debris from which rested, an impalpable sediment, amongst bits of broken shells at the bottom of the bottle. Amongst the weed tiny bivalves nestled, open ing their doors as if to let out their curious feathery tenants, whilst others, deprived of their shells, floated in the trans parent water, as it were, homeless and unprotected. Engrossed in the contemplation and study of this new \"curiosity,\" whilst listening to Mr. Reed's description of the weed and its adjuncts, Eva forgot all about Rhoda, who had equally forgotten all about her. When Eva seated herself for a tete-a-tctc with her late preceptor, Rhoda had taken up a book, but not being inter ested in theology soon laid it down; a second and a third shared the same fate; a fourth, Dr. Isaac Barrow's \"Sermons Against Evil Speaking,\" attracted her from the title, but after turning hastily over the discoloured leaves, reading a paragraph here, or a sentence there, she closed the quaint"], [57, "45 THE SPIDER AND THE FLY old volume, and, equally unimpressed with Eva's artless chat, rose and stood by the open window. At first she looked idly at the people passing through the street, then her eye roved to a saucer on the window-ledge, filled with some seductive fluid to allure and destroy unwary vagrant flies. As she watched the unsuspicious insects hover over the miniature pool, and, regardless of their dead and dying friends, loiter on the brink of destruction, or dip their tiny trunks into the sweet poison, she asked herself if there were not human flies as heedless and as easily allured. Absorbed in her new study she lost sight of Eva and hers, until from the weed and the gulf-stream the discourse drifted naturally to the voyage and the voyager who brought it. His name grated harshly on the sensitive ear of Rhoda, and caused her to listen, half unconsciously, to the speakers, who, while discoursing of ordinary matters, employed an ordinary tone. \" Has Mr. Hesketh been over to see Cuthbert ?\" enquired Eva. \"Not yet; we, however, expect him to-morrow. We did invite Mrs. and Miss Hesketh to accompany him\" (Rhoda started), \"wishful to become personally acquainted with the ladies of the family before our Mary enters it; but I received a letter this morning from the old gentleman, declining the invitation for them. Rhoda breathed more freely. What if her old enemy had met her face to face there! \" Have you seen Miss Hesketh since you went home ? \" questioned Mr. Reed. \" Only once or twice. They seldom attend St. Oswald's now; they go to the Cathedral; and you know we do not visit. But I met her with her mother in Gilesgate about a fortnight since. Mary was with me at the time. We were honoured with an unmistakable stare as they passed, and a very rude observation before we were out of hearing. I was very much vexed at them.\""], [58, "46 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \" My dear child, you should not allow the chance remarks of thoughtless people to annoy you, or your passage through the world will be disquiet indeed.\" \" Nor should I, Mr. Reed, had it been only about myself; but they spoke lightly and insultingly both of Mary and Rhoda.\" Eva's voice sank to a whisper, heard nevertheless by the listener apparently so absorbed in watching the flies. \" They do not know our Mary ; they could not surely say anything ill of her ? \" \"They did, indeed, Mr. Reed! Lucy said, pertly and loudly 'So that's Master Cuthbert's meek-faced maid, I sup pose,' and Mrs. Hesketh added sharply, with a little scornful laugh, ' I thought she was that other thing picked up in her rags out of the snow!' I would not have my cousin know for the world, it would wound her dreadfully,\" and Eva glanced nervously over her shoulder at Rhoda, fearful of being overheard. But the rigid face looking out into the street, revealed no sign of attention ; her eyes were turned away, and the pang endured by that haughty heart was unsuspected. \" I should hope both Mary and Miss Wearbank would have better sense than to attach any importance to the idle words of two unreflecting women,\" observed the good curate gravely in as low a tone. \" Oh, yes ! Mary has better sense, I know ; she only laughed at the indirect compliment paid to her; but Rhoda would feel the insult keenly. You do not know my cousin.\" Indeed he did not. Nor did she! The entrance of the tea-tray closed the colloquy. Rhoda came from the window as Mrs. Reed, apologising for her unavoidable absence, took her seat at the table, Mary and Maggie following her into the room. During the meal, Cuth bert and his adventures, with those of other sea-faring men, formed the principal topics of conversation, in which Rhoda betrayed the interest of a casual acquaintance \u2014 nothing more. Eva had insisted on returning to her own room in the"], [59, "THE SPIDER AND THE FLY. 47 spacious old-fashioned house, so Rhoda was installed sole occupant of the guest-chamber, an arrangement which suited her more than her hospitable entertainers were aware. \"Good-night and sweet repose, dear cousin,\" was Eva's parting salutation as she kissed and left her at the door. \" Cousin!\" hissed Rhoda between her set teeth, as she shut and locked herself in. \" Cousin ! Am I never to hear the last of this farce ? Am I for ever to be reminded that I have no relatives ? Am I not perpetually asked if I am connected with the Marshes on the male or female side? Connected with the Marshes ! People whose pedigree is known throughout all Durham!\" pacing the floor as she spoke, and unhooking her dress with angry jerks. \" If my mother was a beggar or worse, is it to be thrust in my face for ever ? The very name they have given me grates on my ear like a rasp ! I bear my story in my name!\" She paused. \" But that may be changed \u2014 ah, when? Who will marry the stray waif? Would he? \u2014 would any sensitive man link an honoured with a tainted name ? Oh, mother, mother! I had better have perished with you than remain even in the lap of luxury to bear your shame ! \" and the proud girl bowed her head and wept \u2014 but not long, even for herself. Tossing back with an impatient gesture the mass of curls, which, escaping from the side-combs, had fallen like a veil over the sanctity of her grief, with a sudden change of mood she muttered angrily, \" Here, too ! in the house of the country curate, where I felt my secret safe, do I not hear the whis pered echoes of the Hesketh tongue ! Do I not come face to face once more with one of the viper brood that stung me ! But I will trample on his heart as his sister trampled on mine.\" Her better angel tapped her on the breast. Once more the defiant flush faded, her cheek sank on her outspread hand, \u2014 for a brief instant she reasoned with herself. \"Yet Cuthbert Hesketh himself has never wTonged me to my knowledge, nor has Mary Reed. Stay! may I not trace"], [60, "48 STUNG TO THE QUICK. to his influence, his teaching, the shrinking and mistrust of that wonderfully meek-faced maid! And Mary Reed \u2014 why should I pause for her? Does not every look and tone of hers show repulsion ? If aught so tame can hate, I know that she hates me ; but what is her hate to mine, and what is her chance beside me?\" Rhoda stood before the glass as she drew a comparative summary of their rival charms. \" Why, even Eva's blonde beauty pales before mine. Though she certainly has a nameless grace I cannot fathom, still she has no art, no talent to conceal herself, no secret power within to charm at will and conquer whom she will. And Mary, insipid Mary, scarcely pretty; educated, it is true, but not accomplished, not finished \u2014 a diamond in the rough \u2014 whilst I, the diamond cut and polished, may flash with lustre that shall dazzle her sailor lover, and defy them all.\" As thus she spoke, and stood with unbound hair falling to her knees, with a scornful lip and flashing eye, she seemed a very pythoness inspired with prophecy. Who in her morning face of even baby-artlessness would look for or suspect the terrific beauty it held, or the change a word, a moment might produce? Her lips, her flexile lips, lied without speech, were capable of all expressions. Her beauty was that of the verdure on the vine-clad volcano, but the more to be dreaded because none knew of the secret fires slumbering beneath. Genial Mr. Hesketh was over from Durham that day; Cuthbert met him at the railway station, and they walked to the Rev. James Reed's house together. Mary was a favourite with Mr. Hesketh: he greeted her warmly before he turned to salute Mr. and Mrs. Reed, or to offer his apologies for the absence of wife and daughter, which he managed so very clumsily, that Cuthbert blurted out, \u2014 \" Now, father, don't spin a yarn about it : can't you say at once you did not care to bring the women in tow lest they should make mischief?\""], [61, "THE SPIDER AND THE FLY. 49 \"Well, \u2014 well \u2014 a\u2014 I can't say \u2014 I don't know \u2014 well, the fact is, I did not care to bring them, and so kept my own coming quiet, and that's the honest truth,\" ejaculated the old gentleman at length, glad to be rid of the apologetic burden self-imposed. \" I knew how the land lay,\" laughed Cuthbert, bringing his brown palm down on his father's back as he spoke, with hearty good-will, \u2014 \"I knew how the land lay. It would have taken a heap of shiners to rig the pair out in silks and satins to show off in, and make homely people uncom fortable with their airs; so you, like the good old pilot you are, knowing the rock ahead, took care not to run foul of it.\" \"Nay, nay, Cuthbert,\" remonstrated the curate gently, \"do not speak ill of your mother and sister.\" \"Mother! she's no mother of mine! and as for speaking ill of her and Lucy, \u2014 why, it's what they've done of every other craft since I can remember. There, now, father,\" con tinued he, observing Mr. Hesketh about to speak, \" don't contradict me \u2014 you know it's true, and that you only kept them aloof lest they should plague you and make mischief here.\" A faint disclaimer from the father was followed by a good humoured laugh from Cuthbert, and an appeal to Mary if she would miss his absent relatives. Although in the room, Eva and Rhoda had remained totally unrecognised during this lively discussion ; the latter construing into a slight that which was but the result of preoccupation, whilst Eva, with girlish glee, came forward and professed her willingness to be \" comfortable \" on any terms, she held aloof until Cuthbert, observing her at last, stepped towards her and begged to be pardoned for his apparent inattention. Then her brow relaxed, smiles took the place of the gather ing frown, and she became once more fascinating; agreeably so to the sea-captain, unaccustomed to extreme polish and refine ment, (/-'j-agreeably so in the opinion of Mary, who had been hitherto allowed a monopoly of her acknowledged suitor. E"], [62, "50 STUNG TO THE QUICK. Cuthbert departed to his duty on the \" Polly \" and the wharf. Mr. Hesketh, closeted with Mr. Reed in his study, held a conference with him, the nature of which did not transpire. It was afterwards known that Mr. Hesketh, desirous that his son's marriage should take place immediately, entered upon the question, not doubting it would be favour ably entertained, as he came prepared to be liberal in a pecuniary sense. Struck with Mr. Hesketh's reluctance to introduce his wife and daughter, and coupling with it the unseemly remark Mary and Eva had overheard the latter make in the open street, the reverend gentleman was less anxious than he might have been for the union previously regarded with so much favour. \"Mary is young enough,\" he urged, apologetically, \"and so is Cuthbert: they may wait awhile. Indeed, Mary is much too young to be thrown closely in contact with ill-natured or disagreeable women, whose opportunities for annoyance would be multiplied by alliance.\" \"But, my dear sir,\" appealed Mr. Hesketh, \"you surely would not permit my wife's little peculiarities to interfere with the happiness of the young people.\" \"The 'peculiarities' of a mother-in-law, be they little or great, are so apt to interfere with the happiness of young people,\" rejoined Mr. Reed, \"that it behoves me to hesitate before I resign my bairn to the possibility of lifelong dis quietude. Mary has had a comfortable and peaceful home, undisturbed by petty jealousies or bickerings; she would therefore be ill prepared to ward off the gnat-like attacks of small-minded feminine persecution.\" \"God bless my life, Mr. Reed! you might think I had a pair of furies in my house, only waiting to pounce on poor Mary. I am bound to own they enjoy a preponderance of tongue and temper; but the young couple need not reside within the reach of either, or if they did, both Cuthbert and myself would interpose to shield our gentle Mary from every annoyance.\""], [63, "THE SPIDER AND THE FLY. 51 \"I do not doubt your good will in the least,\" replied the other; \"I only doubt the good will of your family. Long tongues reach a long way; you in Durham would be power less to protect a daughter-in-law in Sunderland whose husband was absent at sea. I have been reminded to-day of Mrs. Hesketh's talent for sowing the seeds of discord; and with no disrespect to you, think it an imperative duty to deliber ate before I decide.\" \" And whilst you are deliberating the two most concerned may be dying for each other,\" whined Mr. Hesketh, quite disconcerted. \" I see no symptoms of love-sick malaria in either as yet : and, indeed, the love that will not sustain a long courtship will scarcely endure many months after marriage. Love-sick girls and boys often make very uncongenial partners for life. If their love be worth a benediction it will only deepen during the period of probation. I must consider the subject. It is too important for hasty decision.\" With this answer, Mr. Hesketh was obliged to content himself, and Cuthbert likewise. The former returned to Durham that evening, disconcerted hy the failure of his mission. He was anxious to see his son settled, \u25a0 with a home of his own, a home where he himself could find repose and a welcome; which was more than he could say of the house in Old Elvet. Besides, he was not too well satisfied with the excessive deference and attention Cuthbert paid to Miss Wearbank, nor with her reception of the same, and would fain have seen him married to a sensible well-meaning girl like Mary; safe from the lures of those bewildering black eyes. Something of this Rhoda must have seen in his face, heard in his tones, for she remembered he was present when she was found. As she felt so she thought, the feeling ever uppermost in her mind swaying her inward communings. \" His manner betrays a consciousness of my base origin, and he scorns me for it ; but I will repay the scorn with in-"], [64, "52 STUNG TO THE QUICK. terest. I can reach his heart through his son, and his vile wife's through her child, too. 'Nemo me impune lacessit' shall be my motto henceforth, and let those who insult me look to themselves ! \" Alas! for the evil thrown by Lucy across the warp of the foundling's life, destroying the texture with its coarse uneven thread! More bent on her object than ever, day by day, little by little did this subtle enchantress weave her spells around the unsuspecting sailor; so delicately, that not even Mary could accuse her of flirtation or scheming. Mary felt the evil influence, but could not define it; Cuthbert felt it and strove to shake it off; strove manfully against a fascination which was fast warping the love and faith of years, yet strove ineffectually. It was therefore no slight relief to Mary when Mr. Marsh announced his intention to \" pop over and take his girls home, he was so confoundedly lonely.\" The morning came clear and bright, and with it Mr. Marsh, who proposed, as soon as the dinner cloth was withdrawn, that they should all go down to the wharf and take Cuth bert by surprise. A famous opportunity for Rhoda, who did not care to let her prize slip through her fingers without an effort to strengthen the net she had so carefully woven! Captain Hesketh was on the wharf, giving orders to a couple of barefooted, bareheaded, barebreasted seamen, with tarry hands and tarry trousers, as unlike the trim conven tional stage sailor as a Newcastle collier to the Lord Mayor's state barge. His greeting of Mr. Marsh and Eva was warm in the ex treme; his reception of Rhoda and Mary not less cordial, but there was also an evident embarrassment which betrayed inward perturbation. Other vessels lay between the \"Polly\" and the wharf, connected as usual by planks from gangway to gangway."], [65, "THE SPIDER AND THE FLY. 53 Over these Mary and Eva tripped readily enough, either from custom or fearlessness ; but Rhoda, with the prettiest show of timidity, trembled to put a foot on the board, until Cap tain Hesketh, with many assurances of their safety, handed her across ; an attention for which he was thanked with such eloquent eyes, no wonder he was dazzled. No sooner on board than her curiosity and surprise were excited by everything she saw, having, as she said, \" never trod the deck of any vessel larger than a Brighton pleasure-boat.\" Of course she must examine the barque from stem to stern, her interest increasing at every step ; and, of course, the captain must be her equally interested cicerone. There were hatchways to peep down, narrow steps to be helped down, cabins to explore, lockers to examine, a compass to be boxed, and rigging described; all of which kept the pair in pretty close proximity. Isolation from the rest of the party, who being familiar with the \" Polly \" did not care to follow, was the natural result. Mary began to feel not a little uneasy at the prolonged inspection, and more than a little piqued at Cuthbert's evident forgetfulness of her own presence on board, her annoy ance by no means diminishing when they at length made their appearance after Mr. Marsh's loud call : \"Are you two going to be all day looking at spars and canvas ? \" and her eager ears caught these earnest whispered words, in the sweetest of sweet tones : \" I shall never forget this day, captain ! \" and his low but impressive response, \u2014 \"Nor /, Miss Wearbank.\" Recrossing the planks brought a return of timid hesitancy, and Cuthbert of course to her assistance. Once more by her side, there Rhoda detained him during the homeward walk, which Eva enlivened by banter and raillery on her cousin's unexpected nervousness ; raillery which delighted Rhoda, for Mary winced, and she saw it. After their early tea, Mr. Marsh proposed that \"the bairns"], [66, "54 STUNG TO THE QUICK. should enliven them with some music.\" Eva\u2014 good-natured, unsuspicious Eva\u2014 not conscious of the storm brooding over that hospitable hearth, sang cheerily for the delectation of all who cared to hear her; Maggie, too, playing over her latest lessons, essayed to please; and versatile Rhoda en chanted the ear, not only with her brilliant execution on the piano, but with the exquisite tones of her rich clear voice, attuned as it was that night with pathos and tenderness. Alas for poor Mary ! her temper was sorely tried ; agitation rendered her musical efforts a miserable failure, the very con sciousness of inferiority cramping her fingers and loading her voice. Never did she appear to less advantage, and never was siren more successful than Rhoda. Mary had yet another pull at her heart-strings, when Air. Marsh pressed Cuthbert to call when he came to Durham; and Rhoda, with a wistful glance and the faintest of faint sighs, supplemented the invitation, which the recreant lover seemed only too ready to accept. Could Rhoda, as the swift train whirled them along the iron road that night, have looked into the cosy parlour they had quitted, her triumph would have been complete. There were tears and angry words, accusation and proud retort, where love and peace had reigned supreme. Mary and Cuthbert quarrelled for the first time \u2014 not as the shallow-hearted or petulant, who quarrel over straws, kiss and are friends again every time they meet \u2014 but as those who love quarrel, when the wound is deep, and the one in the wrong does not care to confess or atone. It is true Cuthbert's conscience accused him of trifling with Mary, but not finding the process of self-accusation comfort able, he strove to justify his conduct under the plea that \" Mary had no right to be jealous of his attentions to any girl. He thought nothing of Miss Wearbank \u2014 at least, nothing to care a rope's end about, until Mary's confounded jealousy provoked him; nor did he care much now, though she was so taut and trim; but he would show Mary he could cast"], [67, "OLD FRIENDS AND NEW FRIENDS. 55 anchor in any harbour he chose, and was free to do it; he was neither moored for life nor stranded yet ! \" And so they parted \u2014 in sorrow and anger. Months would pass, and seas roll between their divided hearts ere they might meet again ! The sunlight would fade from Mary's future, and the rose-tint from her cheek, while the pitiful (not pitiless) round of daily life and household routine went on as usual, and while Rhoda laughed and chatted and intrigued as though there were no sorrow nor suffering in the world \u2014 but her own. CHAPTER IX. OLD FRIENDS AND NEW FRIENDS. Shortly after their return home, as they sat at breakfast one morning, Mr. Marsh sang out in a blithe voice, though without a particle of music, \"Busk ye, busk ye, my bonnie, bonnie bairns ! I intend to bring home a beau this evening ; but I must warn you half the marriageable belles in Durham are dying for him, so don't you two pull caps for the swain, lest I should object to pay the milliner's bill.\" \" Who is he, papa ? What is his name ? What is he like ? \" asked Eva, all aglow with excitement. \"Nay, nay, honey, not so fast; one question at a time. Look at Rhoda there, the picture of demure propriety, with as much curiosity in her heart as ever perched on the tip of your tongue, I'll be bound. When will you learn to be as discreet as your cousin ? \" and \" papa\" patted his daughter's head with a smile which said more plainly than speech that he liked her best as she was. \" When my education is as finished, papa, not before. But you have not answered my questions. I am sure Rhoda"], [68, "56 STUNG TO THE QUICK. wishes to know who this desirable beau may be just as much as I do. Don't you, Rhoda? \" \" Not particularly. There is not much variety in Durham beaus in general, if I may be allowed to judge from the samples I have observed since I came home. He may be a new divinity student, with white neck-cloth and black-rimmed eye glass; or a scientific viewer, learned in seams and strata; or he may be, as is most likely, a country bumpkin ! I have seen no gentlemen here such as thronged the beach at Brigh ton,\" replied Rhoda, superciliously, with the air of one whose dictum was decisive. \"Oh, Rhoda, how can you for shame say so! I am sure there are as perfect gentlemen in Durham as in Brighton, or anywhere,\" protested Eva. \"There may not be so many coxcombs here; but there are men with heads as clear, and hearts as warm, and manners as refined, as the gentlemen of the south, Eva. There are gentlemen in Brighton as elsewhere, no doubt, but it swarms with foplings and adventurers; and Rhoda has not been wise enough to discriminate between the dandy on horseback and the gentleman on foot. However, I will bring my ' bumpkin' home to-night. If he commit any particular solecism in good manners, we need not repeat the invitation.\" \"Well, but, papa, do- \" No ; I will not tell you his name until he comes ! Give me my hat. Where are my gloves? I'm off!\" \"Now is not that provoking ? I wonder who the gentle man is ! Come, Rhoda, I'll ring the bell ; and then we will gather some flowers, and re-fill the vases. I wish I knew what he is like. I say, Rhoda, don't you think papa ought to furnish the drawing-room afresh ? I believe those old crimson moreen curtains have hung at the windows ever since I was born. It is many a year since mamma had them dyed. I am sure they are dingy enough now. Bless my life ! here have I been talking away, and I do believe she has not heard a single syllable ! Why, Rhoda, I say ! what are"], [69, "OLD FRIENDS AND NEW FRIENDS. 57 you dreaming of\u2014 men or moonshine ?\" and the lightsome little lady laid her hand lightly on her cousin's shoulder. Slowly turning her large dreamy eyes from the window, thus recalled to herself, Rhoda replied, carelessly, \" Both, perhaps. But what do you want?\" \" Want ? Why you, to be sure ! We must trim up the room, and make the old place as presentable as possible: neither beaus nor bumpkins are so plentiful that we need despise the advent of a new one.\" The flowers were gathered, the old-fashioned furniture smartened up with knitting and netting, embroidered cushions were divested of their chintz covers, and all that could be done to the room was done. Then the young ladies bethought themselves that their dress was rather heavy, and it became really essential that their mourning garb should be relieved with plain white collars and cuffs ; and as their wardrobes had not yet been supplied with the said \"essentials,\" a shopping expedition became indispensable. A brisk walk to the market-place, a leisurely survey of all the book -muslin mourning-collars and cuffs in their draper's show-room, a tardy selection, and then the twain hurried home to be in time for dinner, Eva talking all the way she went, and thinking of anything but what was before her ; so that, as she turned the sharp corner from Silver Street to Framwellgate Bridge, she ran almost into the arms of a gentleman coming in the opposite direction. She blushed, apologised, and so did he, lifting his hat to Rhoda as they passed on. \"I declare, Rhoda, if that is not your ' count in disguise!' What a stupid I was. I quite bumped against him.\" \" Yes, you never look before you. What a pair of ill-bred creatures he must think us ! \" was the somewhat sharp reply. \" Never mind ; he is a stranger to us, so it does not matter.\" \" Yes, Eva, it does matter. A young lady should be equally"], [70, "58 STUNG TO THE QUICK. a lady, whether in a room or in the street, with friends or with strangers,\" was Rhoda's very prompt and pertinent retort. \"Ah, well! but I can't talk going up this hill; my breath's gone. 'South Street will kill me before long. Don't I look consumptive?\" and she laughed and gasped all the rest of the way home. At dinner Mr. Marsh was obdurate. He would not lift the veil from the \"country bumpkin;\" and as a little curiosity unsatisfied fans itself into a great curiosity, each young lady in her own room, whilst dressing, speculated in her own way on the probable peculiarities of their visitor expectant. Evening came at length, bringing with it Mr. Marsh, and Rhoda's railway companion, against whom Eva had run so unceremoniously a few hours before! \" Mr. Raeburn, \u2014 my daughter Eva, \u2014 my niece, Miss Wear bank.\" The gentleman bowed, and with a pleasant smile, said, \" I believe I have had the pleasure of meeting these ladies before.\" \"Indeed!\" said Mr. Marsh, \" I have certainly some recol lection that my niece told me you two had travelled together ; but had no idea you and Eva had ever met.\" \"Oh, yes! and Miss Marsh made a striking impression on me when we did meet!\" was the gallant and rather pointed rejoinder. \" That means, papa, that I was so clumsy as to run right against Mr. Raeburn as we were hurrying home for dinner,\" explained the blushing Eva. \"Yes,\" chimed in Rhoda, \" and she congratulated herself that the gentleman was a stranger, and therefore it did not matter.\" \" Well, stranger or friend, I can but beg pardon, like a good little girl, and promise never to do so any more.\" \" And I, Miss Marsh, can but grant the pardon, and absolve you from the promise,\" replied Mr. Raeburn, answering Eva's mock courtesy with as solemn a bow and a most provoking smile."], [71, "OLD FRIENDS AND NEW FRIENDS. 59 \" There, there, that will do ; never mind compliments. I want my tea ! Now, Martin, put the urn on that side for Miss Rhoda ; bring in the comestibles and my slippers, and we will have a cosy evening. Mr. Raeburn, you must separ ate those girls to keep them from quarrelling. By-the-way, Rhoda, did you meet many ' country bumpkins ' during your morning walk, eh ?\" \" A few, in various disguises, \" was her cool reply, no ways disconcerted by the allusion, presuming their guest to be in ignorance of the morning's conversation. A rapid glance across the table from the young gentleman to the old one con vinced her of the contrary, and it was with difficulty she con cealed her mortification. After tea, at Mr. Raeburn's request, for the first time since Mrs. Marsh died, the piano was unclosed and music-books brought forth. Eva, unaccustomed to exhibit before strangers, and conscious of the marked superiority of Rhoda's performance, was un usually reluctant to play ; but, when Mr. Raeburn suggested that \" probably Miss Wearbank would favour him first with one of the overtures inscribed with her name, and afterwards Miss Marsh might be induced to do him the honour?\" she laughingly took her seat, saying as she did so \u2014 \"Nay, if I must commit myself, I had better do it first ; for I know you will have no patience to listen to me if once Rhoda's nimble fingers touch the keys.\" It must, however, be admitted that she was uncommonly nervous ; and even Rhoda at first seemed to have lost her usual presence of mind ; but she soon regained her self-control, and performed a difficult fantasia with power and precision. Mr. Raeburn did not evince the marked surprise at Rhoda's surpassing skill which Eva expected. Whether it was that having seen much of the world and polished society, he had become accustomed to \" delicacy of touch,\" and \"brilliance of execution,\" or that Eva's easy unaffected style pleased him by its very novelty \u2014 or that he"], [72, "60 STUNG TO THE QUICK. was too well bred to compliment one lady at the expense of another; certain it is, that his satisfaction was so equally and unequivocally expressed, that, later in the evening, Eva con sented with scarcely any hesitation to accompany him in Car penter's then popular duet of \" The Mariner,\" commencing\u2014 \" Oh mariner ! oh mariner ! that comest from the sea, Say will the angry billows bring my true love back to me; Say are the tempests terrible that come upon the main, My love is on the sea, oh ! will it give him back again ! \" There was a perceptible tremor in her sweet voice when she commenced, but it gradually faded away as she proceeded ; and the song made an impression on their visitor never afterwards effaced. More music and singing, and then an hour's social chat, a north-country supper, and a leave-taking, when the \" bump kin \" was invited by Mr. Marsh to repeat the visit. This, as might be expected, was but the prelude to many other \" cosy evenings,\" in the enjoyment of which Mr. Raeburn participated. Sometimes music was superseded by a quiet rubber of whist; sometimes he brought with him a new book, and read aloud, with a rich, well-modulated voice, while the young ladies plied their needles or knitting-pins. Indeed, so agreeable did the young gentleman render himself on these occasions, that his presence began to be looked for as the principal ingredient towards the pleasure of the evening. Mr. Marsh was delighted. He rubbed his hands and chuckled gleefully at every fresh indication that the \"bumpkin\" was high in the good graces of both his \" bairns\" \u2014 and that he was soon became apparent. Old Martin pondered whether \" that fine young gentle man wor puttin' oop te his young mistress, or te that black eyed lass!\" speculation in the kitchen often preceding either speculation or perception in the parlour. However, so equally balanced were Mr. Raeburn's atten tions to the cousins, that it would have required a shrewd"], [73, "61 OLD FRIENDS AND NEW FRIENDS. observer to determine towards which his fancy inclined ; \u2014 if, indeed, he had a warmer feeling than friendship for either of them. Cuthbert Hesketh's visit to his father was not long delayed. When the \"Polly\" had discharged her cargo, and his actual presence in Sunderland was not imperative, he hastened to Durham. The frigid reception he met from his stepmother, and the pert greeting of Lucy, were no inducements io prolong his stay in the house that was not \u2014 home. Not even the cordial welcome of his sire, proud of the impulsive and warm-hearted sailor \u2014 a fac-simile of himself at the same age \u2014 could atone for their lukewarmness. No wonder, then, that father and son should be seen that evening wending their way towards the hospitable residence of their old friend, where they were certain of a genuine and hearty welcome from the whole household \u2014 from Mr. Marsh, down to Martin and his dog Towzer \u2014 as ugly a brute as ever contrived to ingratiate himself into the favour of a master. \"What cheer, messmate, what cheer? \" was Cuthbert's salu tation, as the old man opened the door. \" Why, Maister Cuthbert, is that ye ? It diz my old een good to see ye; I hardly kenned ye, though, ye're grown so tall and comely; but ye were aye a bonny bairn, an' I'm reet glad te see ye looking so hearty ! \" \" Aye, aye, Martin, I don't doubt it. But where's my friend Towzer? \" \" Why, ye must know, Maister Cuthbert \u2014 Captin, I mean \u2014 that Towzer dizn't like Miss Rhoda, an' Miss Rhoda can't abide Towzer, so I'm bound te keep him i' the stable oot o' t' way. T' poor beast dizn't like it, though, \" said he, with a nod of the head, which implied that the man did not approve of it more than the beast. During this brief dialogue Mr. Hesketh had opened the drawing-room door to announce himself. Eva instantly (before anyone else saw him) sprang forward,"], [74, "62 STUNG TO THE QUICK. and, clasping both arms round his neck, kissed him affec tionately. \"Dear godfather!\" cried she, \"you good old soul, I am so delighted to see you. What a while it is since you were here ! I declare you are quite a stranger ; come and sit down close by me. \" \"I should as soon have thought of seeing \u2014 Cuthbert!\" exclaimed Mr. Marsh, dropping his former speech and extending his hand as he rose. \" This is an unexpected pleasure; I am glad to see you do not forget old friends. Permit me to introduce you to What ! shaking hands ? You do not mean to say you and Mr. Raeburn have met before ? Pray did you travel two hundred miles together in a first-class carriage? or run into each other's arms on the ' Rialto, where merchants most do congregate ? ' \" inquired he, with a comical smile. \" Neither, my good sir, \" replied Mr. Raeburn. \" I made Captain Hesketh's acquaintance three years ago in Antigua; but I did make the homeward voyage with him in his first class barque, the 'Polly,' last year; so we are old friends and fellow-travellers. I was not, however, aware that he was connected with my late uncle's executor, Mr. Hesketh, here ; the knowledge will, however, form an additional bond between us. \" \"And now, I should like to know what we disconsolate damsels have done amiss to be excluded from these hand shakings and congratulations ? I'm sure Rhoda looks as if she thought Captain Hesketh's memory were at fault, \" said Eva, pleasantly. Rhoda coloured to the temples (though from a very unsus pected cause) as Cuthbert advanced and pressed her hand between both his, saying \u2014 \"My memory is not so treacherous; Miss Wearbank will, I trust, forgive an omission so unintentional, and for which I hope to atone. \" His voice sank lower as he spoke, and their eyes met in"], [75, "A GROUP OF PORTRAITS. 63 a glance which, on her side, spoke of timid, retiring love on his, of growing admiration. Alas ! poor fly ! CHAPTER X. A GROUP OF PORTRAITS. Suppose we picture the group in that comfortable but old fashioned drawing-room, when the new arrivals were seated and engaged in pleasant if desultory chat. Close by the open window sat Eva, for the benefit of the light, her fair hair falling in long ringlets on a frame and canvas, over which she bent, working very rapidly between the gaps in conversation. She was embroidering, in various shades of lilac wool with a long simple stitch, a sort of Van dyke pattern, intended when finished for one of those hand kerchief bags, without which no lady's toilet was complete at that day. Her dress was composed of closely-fitting black paramatta, with band and buckle at the waist; the sleeves, tight from the wrist to the elbow, expanded to the shoulder like balloons and (may it be told ?) were kept in shape by concealed cushions of light down. The neck, which would otherwise have been bare \u2014 the bodice rising little above the shoulders \u2014 was covered delicately by a large transparent muslin collar with a broad hem, to match the closely-fitting cuffs. We in 1867 should scarcely vote Eva's dress scant in the petticoat, but then in '39 it was fashionably full, gathered in at the waist, and fell in very graceful folds as far as it could fall, though it was short enough to display the black silk stocking and sandaled slipper which set off a very dainty foot and ankle. Long jet earrings, to match her brooch and buckle, completed her mourning garb, of which Rhoda's was a precise counterpart."], [76, "64 STUNG TO THE QUICK. The latter, tall and stately, as her cousin was small and lithe, had been netting a long crimson silk purse, but put it down on the entrance of visitors, having work of more importance on hand. Cuthbert, who had placed himself at the window near her work-table, as bringing him closer to herself (though she had fallen back a little more within the shadow of the sombre curtain), began fingering the silken trifle much as though he were breaking the tenth commandment, and entangling him self and her purse-twist at the same time. It is scarcely necessary to describe Cuthbert's attire. The sailor thirty or forty years back and the sailor to-day is one and the same; the same gold band on the officer's cap, the same careless neckkerchief, the same blue jacket and vest, and, in equally warm weather, the same white trousers and thin shoes tied on the instep. Cuthbert had a frank open countenance, bronzed by exposure, but legible as a book; his eyes were a clear bright hazel, his hair was of a sort of tawny hue which has no name in the dyer's vocabulary, and his whiskers (a little lighter), obstinately refusing to grow in a continuous line, presented a couple of patchy bushes on the nether jaw. He was by no means an ill-looking fellow, though he had patchy whiskers, a mouth which always gave a glimpse of the clear white teeth within, and a nose which belonged to no one established type ; for if the lips were open and some what irresolute, the whole face beamed with good nature and generosity. So likewise did his father's, but the round, good-tempered face was set in a thick bush of white hair, \u2014 \"mutton chop whiskers \" meeting and hiding within the voluminous folds of a white neckcloth (a trifle smaller than a sheet), tied in some mysterious fashion without a visible bow or knot. The neatly plaited French-cambric shirt-frills, of which he seemed at once so proud and careful, were fastened down with an oval brooch, containing his first wife's hair within a border"], [77, "65 A GROUP OF PORTRAITS. of pearls set in red gold. His bottle-green coat with its gilt buttons, his buff Marseilles-quilting waistcoat, nankeen con tinuations, broad watch-ribbon and bunch of seals, all told that he clung to the dress of the days when he was a beau and in his prime. Besides being ten years younger than his old friend, Mr. Marsh measured quite those many inches less in the waist, but as a sort of compensation he had risen three or four inches nearer to the ceiling. His face was quite as pleasant, with a cheerful good-humour, but serene and equable; where as Mr. Hesketh's was liable to grow red and angry on what Mr. Marsh would have thought very slight provocation. Mr. Marsh, moreover, formed a still greater contrast to the other, being dressed in deep mourning; for even his black mohair stock had a falling front, barely relieved by a satin frill. The only touch of white about him was his collar, and that stood up stiffly on either side his face, as if to keep his overflowing whiskers in order. Mr. Raeburn as yet has no fixed place in our picture, but he had one in the group, not so much by Eva's side as behind her in the back-ground, occupying a corresponding position to that of Rhoda, on the opposite side of the window; the stout body of Mr. Hesketh partially hiding him from Rhoda's view, as every now and then the old gentleman leaned for ward to make a passing remark to his godchild. Does any young lady desire to know how Mr. Raeburn, the beau-ideal of half the Durham demoiselles, was attired ? Let her consult uncle or papa, and it is probable she will hear that his faultlessly-cut swallow-tailed coat of claret-coloured cloth was short in the waist, had a rather broad lapel collar, and sleeves so closely fitting as to require buttons for three or four inches above the wrist. That the said coat buttons, including two at the waist behind, were richly gilt and chased. That his vest was of claret velvet, a degree lighter than the coat ; his trousers of drab kerseymere, also closely fitting and strapped down tightly under the soles of glossy Wellington F"], [78, "66 STUNG TO THE QUICK. boots. That his collar stood erect like Mr. Marsh's, and his full black satin scarf was secured with a double breast-pin connected by a tiny chain. Such was Mr. Raeburn's exterior as he appeared in South Street that summer evening, quite as interesting, quite as attractive, quite as gentlemanlike as any of our present loosely habited black-coated generation. But, then, Mr. Raeburn stood five feet ten in his stockings, had a face a sculptor might have modelled (for a thinking man, not an inane wax wig-block), lips with a bow-like curve, full and round and red as a woman's, yet redeemed from effemi nacy by the decision and reticence which held them close. A thin line of black moustache fringed his upper lip, closely cut whiskers almost met beneath his rounded chin, a luxuriant crop of glossy curls clustered on his forehead, which had been toned down from its pristine whiteness by the tropical sun under which he had been reared, and he carried himself with the grace of a gentleman, \u2014 not a dancing-master. Rhoda was by no means the only young lady in Durham who had set her heart upon Mr. Raebum ; but she was the only one who felt him to be attainable; not that she valued him less, but that she valued herself more ; felt herself in fact the only per son in the locality (for which she had a profound contempt) who could at all stand on a par with him, and therefore the more especially fitted to attract his eye and win his affection. No fear of her simple cousin crossed her mind; she was rather pleased than otherwise when Mr. Raeburn retired from her view behind Eva and Mr. Hesketh. With his clear dark eye upon her, flirtation would not be the very easiest thing in the world, however adroit she might be, and she had somehow arrived at the conclusion that he would not be easy to deceive with his eyes open. Eva, however, not dreaming of conquests or flirtations, laughed and chatted away whilst she threaded her needles and fastened her ends of wool \u2014 \"making love,\" as she called it, to her \"dear old godpapa;\" every now and then giving a"], [79, "67 A GROUP OF PORTRAITS. pleasant word to the younger listener, who, be it known, was not over-delighted when the window was closed, the lamp brought in, and conversation became general. True, the engrossing rug-work which had kept the bright head and arch smile so pertinaciously bent over the canvas, and from himself, was laid aside, but, then, the merry face turned towards all alike, and no friendly curtain enabled him to whisper those occasional sentences which elicit character, and may mean much or little, as they are interpreted. Not that Mr. Raeburn looked as if he were in love, or acted as if he were in love, but he had a dim consciousness that he would have been satisfied to remain in that shady nook, and did not care to be disturbed. Cuthbert had induced Miss Wearbank, though with apparent reluctance, to promise him her crimson purse on its completion ; little thinking she was weaving another net for him, with a mesh closer and stronger, though invisible, and that the one he saw was but a type of that which he did not see. Had it not been for Mr. Marsh, the conversation during the twilight would have been more fragmentary and tete-a-tete than it was ; but drawn into a different grouping round the cheerful lamp, isolation was impossible, topics of general interest were introduced and discussed, Mr. Marsh thrusting in a pun wherever he could, and chuckling alike whether his attempts at wit \" told \" or fell dead. Rhoda alone, never very voluble, somewhat less talkative than usual, made her eyes do the work for her tongue ; she had a difficult game to play, and cared not to show spectators her cards. One thing is certain, that Cuthbert's love for poor Mary was being thrust farther and deeper into the shade by his growing passion for this strange enchantress, whose fascina tions the unsuspicious, susceptible (and somewhat weak headed) sailor found himself unable to resist. And so it turned out that when the friendly party broke up at a late hour, one at least went home in a state of mental intoxication, from which recovery was doubtful."], [80, "68 STUNG TO THE QUICK. CHAPTER XI. CAN THIS BE LOVE? The next morning Cuthbert found himself again in Mr. Marsh's snug parlour, drawn thither by a secret influence, which not all his sophistry could reconcile to his conscience was right and proper to yield to. Mary had been the sweetheart of his boyhood; to her pitying ear he had con fided his sorrow for the loss of his mother, his grief and troubles when the fresh wife, overcoming his father's faint scruples, drove the lad she disliked to sea. It was Mary whose sym pathy was ever ready when, after each voyage, he had a story to tell of ill-usage by a harsh captain and a brutal mate ; it was she who strengthened and supported him in his trials, and en couraged him to endure, persevere, and overcome evil with good. She had been the light of his life, and loved him, he knew, with perfect, enduring love. Was he to renounce the faith of years for a bright eye and a witching voice ? Ah, there lay the secret ! It was witching, and though his conscience smote him, and though he resolved, on his return to Sunder land, he would make his peace with Mary, and while in Dur ham keep a strict watch over his heart, he, like many a fool besides him, presumed to trifle with temptation, and his fine resolves melted like mist before the sun of Rhoda's smile. Eva was busied with some culinary mystery when he came, so running into the room with floury hands, she gave him one finger to shake, and telling him \"he must fain be satisfied with Rhoda's society that morning,\" ran back into the kitchen to resume her operations. Nothing could have been more favourable for Rhoda's plans, nothing more unfortunate for Cuthbert's wise resolutions. Alas for good intentions! Pandemonium is indeed paved with them, and there is little fear of the pavement wearino away for lack of fresh material."], [81, "CAN THIS BE LOVE? 69 Rhoda \" feared she should supply her cousin's place but indifferently, she was so little used to entertain strangers,\" saying it with the most winning assumption of artless simplicity imaginable. What could Cuthbert say ? Was not a compliment forced from him? What did he say? He hardly was conscious what \u2014 something he uttered about \" desiring no other society, her power to please exceeding that of all women he had met in any land;\" and when she smilingly, with downcast eyes, rebuked him for flattery, what could he do but protest his truthfulness? And then, as she held her beautiful head down, as if too overpowered by his words to utter a reply, need we be surprised that his arm stole round her waist, and, forgetting Mary, he surrendered himself to the infatuation of the moment, and poured into her delighted ear a confession of passionate love. And he meant it. The poor moth was scorching his wings with a very dangerous flame, but he was helplessly, hopelessly fascinated. But did Rhoda admit a corresponding feeling ? Oh, no ! the young lady was far too wary for that. She implied the possibility of being won to love him at some remote period, irresolutely urged her youth, her inexperience, her uncle's probable displeasure, but looked \u2014 oh, how she looked! \u2014 as if love strove with bashfulness, and only maiden modesty sealed the too ready lips. But she never named Mary \u2014 never put in the plea of his engagement as a reason for rejecting his suit. She knew his love for her was of sudden, fungus growth, that for Mary deep-rooted as a forest-tree; and, though her breath had withered the leaves, she feared lest an incautious reminder should cause the yet living branches to put forth fresh ones. Eva's pastry made, she joined the pair, and Rhoda escaped to her own room, under the pretext of preparing for a stroll by the river; but, in reality, to hide and overcome her too visible exultation in the success of her arts."], [82, "70 STUNG TO THE QUICK. The stroll by the river was deferred, at Eva's suggestion, until after dinner, for she insisted that, \" after being half roasted by the kitchen fire, it was not fair to ask her to walk out under a broiling sun ! \" \" Lest your goose should be cooked before Michaelmas, eh ? \" added Mr. Marsh, who had overheard her as he came in. \"Well, Cuthbert, my boy, how are you? Stay and have dinner with us. How soon will it be ready ?\" continued he, addressing Cuthbert and Eva in turn. \"Nancy is dishing it up; Bella has laid the cloth. Yes, Cuthbert, you must stay! You're not wanted at home, and you are wanted here; you must stay and tell me how you like my pastry. I have been head-cook to-day, papa,\" said Eva. So Cuthbert remained; and after dinner, whilst Mr. Marsh had his pipe and his customary \"forty winks,\" the trio strolled down the path to the waterside \u2014 the very path up which Rhoda had been carried wailing nearly nineteen years before. On proceeding a short distance they met Mr. Raeburn, who offered to accompany them, and as Cuthbert evinced no disposition to relinquish Rhoda, Eva, of course, paired off with the former, little to Rhoda's satisfaction, it must be owned ; but Eva, it must equally be acknowledged, was per fectly satisfied with the arrangement, though as yet she was too blind to know wherefore. It was a delightful ramble, by the cool riverside, under the over-arching trees, that sultry summer day; and to Eva the sky never seemed so bright, the water so clear, or the leaves so green. There was sunshine in her heart, and it brightened everything. Somehow, though, the little rattlepate was unusually silent, and even Mr. Raebum appeared less fluent than ordinary. Eva became uncomfortably apprehensive that he would have preferred Rhoda as a companion; and, strange to say, Mr. Raebum was asking himself if Eva's thoughts were not with Cuthbert."], [83, "CAN THIS BE LOVE? 71 The longer the silence continued, the more embarrassing it became. At length it was broken by a common-place obser vation of the gentleman's, but after a few minutes'conversa tion they relapsed into silence again. In a fit of desperation, Eva, as they reached a bend of the river, called Mr. Raeburn's attention to the extreme beauty of the scenery, and this elicited not only a response, but a very eloquent and vivid description of lands he had lived in or passed through. Eva, deeply interested, forgot her fears and everything but the happiness of listening to the rich tones of the speaker, into whose face she looked the pleasure she felt. Then he told her how his father and uncle had loved the same lady, and had quarrelled in consequence; that years after their marriage his father discovered she had been coerced by parental authority to marry him, her heart being bound to his brother. On hearing this he became furious with jealousy, burst into the chamber of his wife (always an invalid) in a fit of ungovernable rage, accused her of treachery, in sinuated doubts of her fidelity, and by his language and demeanour so agitated her that she broke a blood-vessel and died within the week. Like many other angry men, he repented when too late \u2014 his jealousy was but the scum of his intense love. His agony at her loss was intense. England became hateful to him ; he placed his property in the hands of an agent, and taking with him his only son, Frank, then ten years old, wandered from land to land, in quest of the peace he never found, until he at last died in Antigua, six years before, repentant and hopeful. Thence he had himself been summoned by his late uncle's executors. \"At first, \"he said, \" I thought of returning to Antigua, leaving the manage ment of my newly-acquired estate in the hands of Mr. Hesketh, but an unforeseen circumstance over which I have no control binds me now to my native land, and nothing but the disappointment of my fondest hopes will drive me hence again.\" Did Eva's imagination deceive her, or did his"], [84, "72 STUNG TO THE QUICK. voice really seem tremulous with emotion, as he bent towards her to say this? And why did little Eva's heart beat and flutter so wildly, as though winged with newly-fledged hopes ? and why did she avert her head, afraid to meet his searching gaze? Ah! why, indeed? Was she learning so early the lesson we all learn once in life, and some learn once too often ? Cuthbert and Rhoda were in advance, notwithstanding several attempts of the latter to drop into the rear, so that Rhoda saw neither the drooping head of Eva, nor the absorbed and earnest manner of Frank Raeburn. And well for them she did not, for she loved him with all the intensity of her passionate nature; and woe betide the one who came between her and her aims, whomsoever it might be. As it was, she felt somewhat annoyed that Eva should be the companion of his walk ; but as this had been a matter of chance, not selection, and she herself had a profound contempt for her unsophisticated cousin, it never occurred to her that what she considered a blemish, some short (or far) sighted individual might regard as an excellence. So she abandoned herself to the task of securing Cuthbert, whose return to his vessel was fixed for the following morn ing, and she succeeded beyond her expectations. Cuthbert Hesketh's acquaintance with the opposite sex was very limited, as might be expected in one shipped off to sea so young ; and, moreover, his impressions of women in general were not over favourable. He carried away with him no kindly home recollections ; his stepmother and half-sister having furnished him with very discouraging samples of female grace and manner. He had wandered from clime to clime, from port to port, but, with few exceptions, his acquaintance with women had, sailor-like, been confined to the free-and-easy class indigenous to all sea-port towns in England or elsewhere. Now and then Captain Hesketh might find himself in the presence of wife and daughter of some foreign merchant, where difference of language rendered intercourse imperfect; or an"], [85, "CAN THIS BE LOVE? 73 invitation to the drawing-room of some home shipper might introduce him to the graceful and refined of the household; but these opportunities were rare, and Mary Reed had been to him at once the concentration of all feminine excellences and his ideal of perfect womanhood. Had he met Rhoda in the fashionable saloon of a mer chant prince, he would most probably have regarded her as one of the twinkling stars of an inapproachable firmament, his own awkwardness and embarrassment widening the distance ; but she came upon him where he was most at home, to dazzle him by her loveliness, and captivate by a refinement of manner and conversation contrasting vividly with all around and about her. He was near enough to feel her influence, to come unguarded within the range of her blandishments; and Mary's gentle manners, her homely face, every-day accomplishments, and unobtrusive virtues paled to insignificance. The glorious sun put out the common fire, and left him dazed and be wildered. And so, wandering with her upon his arm, listening to the witchery of her voice, he surrendered himself to the intoxica tion of the hour, forgetful of everything but the siren by his side, whose well-feigned diffidence but made him more eager and impetuous, more thoroughly enraptured when her lingering and indefinite consent to his suit fell falteringly from seemingly reluctant lips. One thing, however, she gave him clearly to understand \u2014 that in the presence of others he must neither exhibit nor ex pect any marks of sentiment beyond friendship. And regard ing this but as a proof of innate and excessive delicacy, Cuth bert was in the seventh heaven, and would have promised anything those sweet lips asked him. Busied with the arts which were to convert Mary Reed's betrothed into her sworn thrall, Rhoda surrendered Mr. Raeburn to Eva for the afternoon, not without momentary hesitation certainly, but with no fear for the result. Accus tomed to mould plastic minds to her will, and supremely"], [86, "74 STUNG TO THE QUICK. confident in her own powers, she imagined her smiles would bring any man to her feet,and that he would prove no excep tion. So she walked by Cuthbert's side with the flush of success on her cheek, and triumph in her step and bearing, whilst he was enchanted alike by the stateliness which awed, and the flush which assured him. Mr. Raeburn, however, was neither so plastic nor so simple as Rhoda thought. He had travelled much, not as Cuthbert, a rough seaman among rougher seamen \u2014 but as a gentleman, the son of a gentleman, whose ample means, education, and well-bred ease qualified him to move in the first society, not only in Antigua but at home. The gloom thrown over his young life by the circumstances attending his mother's untimely end, and his father's remorse ful moods, had made him thoughtful and reflective even as a boy. Strangers deemed him cold, equable, unimpressionable: he was simply self-contained. There was fire in his heart, but he kept it under cover, and only a gentle warmth lit up his face in friendly intercourse. Rhoda had no plummet to sound the depths of his nature, nor a charm which was new to him. He had withstood the battery of bright eyes, the witchery of sweet smiles, the cajolery of winning words, long before he came within the range of her seductive glances, and his courteous attention to her during the journey from London to Durham was not (as she supposed) the result of magnetic attraction, but the politeness of a gentle nature towards a young and apparently inexperienced girl travelling a long distance without companion or protector. He had dwelt among dark-eyed, queenly beauties so long, that Eva's flaxen hair and bright blue eyes attracted him from their very rarity, whilst the frank and artless gaiety of her manner completed the charm. But if he were in love, Frank Raeburn had mastered the art of concealing it from indifferent beholders, and if he nar rated his life-story to Eva during that pleasant stroll, to watch her varying countenance and test the strength of her feelings,"], [87, "CAN THIS BE LOVE? 75 he certainly betrayed nothing prematurely beyond the vague allusion to the circumstance \" which bound him to England, \" and the tone which told it. To him Eva's varying face was as an open book, and he read there\u2014 not discouragement. Thus it was that the whole party declared on their return to South Street that the ramble had \" been delightful ; \" though certainly three out of the four had walked on in utter oblivion of surrounding objects. The evening was of course spent at Mr. Marsh's, Mr. Hes keth and Dr. Grove dropping in after tea to smoke a friendly pipe with the old gentleman, and test the quality of some fine old ale he had just received from the Sedgefield Brewery. Mrs. Hesketh resolutely resisted the introduction of to bacco into her precise and stylish parlours, which it was her boast to keep always prepared to receive ladies; conse quently, when Mr. Hesketh desired the solace of a pipe, he was compelled to retreat to the kitchen (in the north not a comfortless haven, by the by), to the exclusive bar-parlour of the Waterloo, or the house of Mr. Marsh. There he was always sure of a hearty welcome and a merry little maiden to fill his pipe, hand him a light, and pull his bushy whiskers, ere she vanished through the curling smoke. Dr. Grove laboured under no such difficulty; he had the faculty of managing matters to suit his own convenience, and had he desired to smoke in his chamber, would have done so; not that he did, but had he felt so inclined, would. True, he did consider Mrs. Grove's best curtains and his own picture-frames, and so held aloof from the drawing room, and he did consult Mrs. Grove's known preference for cigars occasionally during that lady's lifetime, but he did it freely, not under compulsion; and now that he was a widower, he pursued the same course from habit. Rhoda often 'poohed' and 'pahed' at the smoke, and endeavoured to restrict the friends to cigars, but was outvoted, Eva going over to the enemy at once ; so she was obliged to surrender, and content herself with quitting the room."], [88, "76 STUNG TO THE QUICK. Accordingly there was nothing surprising in her retiring from the pariour to the drawing-room, when pipes were in troduced that evening; and no one suspected that she wished to avoid the penetrating eyes of Dr. Grove \u2014 not even the worthy doctor himself. She was accompanied in her retreat by Eva, and speedily followed by Captain Hesketh and Mr. Raeburn, who pro fessed to prefer music to tobacco-smoke, though nothing was said of preference for the musicians. Left to themselves, amidst the clouds of smoke, the trio conceived a luminous idea ; and, resigning at length the pipes, crossed the hall in a body to announce that a pic-nic to Finchale Abbey had been determined on, to come off in about three weeks, when Captain Hesketh would be over for a couple of days to say good-bye to his father before he set sail for Oporto. That Mr. Raebum would be at liberty was taken for granted. Eva was delighted, and Rhoda not the less, although her gratification was more tranquilly expressed. Then arose the question, who should be invited to join them ? And anyone who has had the arranging of a gipsy party knows how perplexing a question this is. Mr. Marsh considered whether Cuthbert's mother and sister should not be asked. Cuthbert declared he did not care whom on earth they asked excepting Mrs. and Miss Hesketh; and Rhoda protested quite as decidedly, if less vehemently, that if they were invited she must decline to go. This the infatuated fool, ignorant of her rooted aversion, or its cause, ascribed to her attachment to himself. A second time Mr. Marsh blundered: desiring Cuthbert to bring Mary over to accompany them. The bewildered recusant coloured violently, and stammered out something unintelligible, which unenlightened Mr. Marsh interpreted from his own heart to mean he would bring her if he could. Finally it was agreed that any friends of the young ladies were to be enrolled, with the above-named exceptions; Mr."], [89, "PREPARING FOR A PLEASANT PIC-NIC. 77 Hesketh and Dr. Grove being jocosely appointed to assist Mr. Marsh in maintaining order among so many young people. Cuthbert, charged with a message to Mary Reed, which he tacitly consented to deliver (without any intention of doing so), then took leave, little at ease, having been adroitly baffled by Rhoda in a clumsy attempt to gain a few moments' private conversation with her. Mr. Raeburn lingered to the last, gentlemanlike and self possessed as ever, with nothing in look or tone to indicate more than a friendly interest in either young lady; nothing more than an almost impalpable pressure of Eva's hand as he shook it after Rhoda's. CHAPTER XII. PREPARING FOR A PLEASANT PIC-NIC. Trivial and common matters in a small country town ever attain an importance almost incomprehensible to the dweller in the metropolis, accustomed to the whirl and bustle of active life, and the crowding panorama of great events ever rolling on be fore him. A pic-nic near London would be a pebble in a stream ; a pic-nic in Durham, projected, too, by an independent member of the community, was an affair of interest to scores whom it did not concern, and the first intimation of the intended fete sufficed to organise a sort of house to house visitation of half the old maids and the gossips in ordinary. Let not this be mistaken for a reflection on old maids in general; the writer has especial veneration for the much maligned sisterhood, but Durham is proverbially celebrated for \" wood and water, law and gospel, old maids and mustard,\" and, as those unburdened with family cares of their own may be supposed to have a superfluity of leisure,"], [90, "78 STUNG TO THE QUICK. it is only natural the spare halfhours should be dedicated to a supervision of the affairs of others, not arising in the first instance from a desire to do mischief, but from a lack of useful occupation and a yearning towards the interests and sympathies from which they are personally shut out. No sooner, therefore, did it ooze out that 'the Marshes were preparing for a pic-nic, than old maids who had once been young ones, young maids who in all probability were destined to be old ones, matrons with marriageable daughters, aye, and, even here and there a sire with a son to settle in the world, began to speculate on the probable extent of the party, and assume invitations in all directions but the true ones. Not desirous to bring down a storm on his \"devoted head,\" Mr. Hesketh carefully abstained from all mention at home of the projected pleasure-party, from which his wife and Lucy had been so carefully excluded; but there were not wanting good-natured friends to put the twain in possession of all the facts and fictions current respecting it. One lady after another came and went with her budget of news ; whilst the knitted anti-macassars, discomposed by one bevy of visitors, were smoothed and replaced before the advent of another, and efforts were made to compose the still more ruffled tempers of the ladies visited. When Mrs. Hodgson uplifted her hands, \" surprised that Mrs. Hesketh knew nothing of the Marshes' pic-nic,\" and the Misses Caldcleugh \" presumed their dear friends would be of the party, since Mr. Hesketh was one of the chief movers,\" and the Forsters, and Ords, and Hardwicks, one and all sympa thising with \"their excellent friend's peculiar position, her outraged feelings,\" and shocked at \" the indignity offered to their sex in the person of Mrs. Hesketh and her sweet daughter,\" brought all the little tit-bits of news they could collect for the delectation of the irritated pair, in order to \" convince them how shamefully they were treated by their natural protector,\" and what ill-used beings they were, it is"], [91, "PREPARING FOR A PLEASANT PIC-NIC. 79 not surprising that these assiduous (and wonderfully well meaning) attempts to soothe \"wounded feelings\" should produce a diametrically opposite result, and stir two very active temperaments to a ferment. The first ebullition of tears and temper having subsided, Mrs. Hesketh hurried to Gilesgate, to pour all her sorrows and trials into the ample lap of her bosom friend, Mrs. Coulson, whom she was in the habit of consulting in all the dark hours of her life, and they were many. Mrs. Coulson was a fat and jolly-looking widow, who had survived the ill-usage of three several spouses, and supplied experience and sympathy gratis to those miserable married ladies of her acquaintance who had no confidence in their consorts, believed themselves to have \"brutes of husbands,\" and lacked skill in the art of governing \"the creatures.\" Sure of solace in Mrs. Coulson's abundant store of compas sion, and of sage instruction dealt out in return for the little family secrets deposited in her keeping, and sure also to hear no unpleasant truths about self-government, or wifely obligations, Mrs. Hesketh sought the widow, and to her revealed that \" those odious Marshes were getting up a gipsy party, and positively refused to invite either herself or Lucy ; she wouldn't mind that, for she did not care to join their gipsy party, not she; but would Mrs. Coulson believe it? the party was given almost in honour of that ne'er-do-weel Cuthbert; and Mr. Hesketh, positively, Mr. Hesketh was one of the promoters! What did she think of that? Was it not enough to try the patience of any woman, to be set aside by her husband in that manner?\" Mrs. Coulson thought it was more than enough \u2014 that such conduct was infamous and not to be borne. \" But surely Mr. Hesketh did not propose the exclusion?\" \"No* but quite as bad, he consented to it! And readily enough, no doubt! No; it would be that haughty minx Mr. Marsh calls his niece who set her face against us. The haughty stuck-up nobody ! \""], [92, "80 STUNG TO THE QUICK. Passionate people, whether male or female, seldom stop to select their words; and Mrs. Hesketh's rolled readily along a well-worn track. \" I shouldn't be surprised ! \" assented the ready widow. \" I don't like that lass ; she walks past my door as if all Gilesgate belonged to her. I should just like to take her pride down a peg or two; though she never did me any harm, to be sure.\" \" May be not ; but it was through her that Lucy was almost turned out of Miss Robson's school, and for nothing but 'taking her pride down a peg,' as you say. I owe her no good-will ; but Mr. Marsh thinks so much of his bargain, it is not safe to meddle with her,\" replied Mrs. Hesketh, remembering the threat of the Ecclesiastical Court with a suppressed shudder. \" But suppose we could manage to pay them back in their own coin \u2014 to annoy the hizzie's bairn who gives herself the airs of a duchess, and perplex this unfeeling husband of yours at the same time? What should an old fellow like him be jaunting into the country with young girls for, I should like to know?\" There was a spice of jealousy for Mrs. Hesketh's already brimming cup! And as she drank the subtle concoction, she listened and assented to Mrs. Coulson's scheme for teaching haughty young ladies not to give themselves airs, and recall wandering husbands to their senses. The three weeks passed, as all time does, more rapidly than anticipated, when it is fully occupied. Cuthbert was busied with the \"Polly,\" her underwriters, crew, and cargo; Mr. Raeburn with matters concerning his new property \u2014 business which frequently called him to London for weeks at a time, and on this occasion for a fortnight. Rhoda and Eva wrote a number of invitations to friends at a distance, the former declaring that \" most of the people of Durham were such arrant mischief-makers and gossips, she did not care for their company.\" She did not say how sensitive her feelings were in mingling"], [93, "81 PREPARING FOR A PLEASANT PIC-NIC. with those who might despise her for her origin, or that she hoped to shine with greater lustre the more of the country and less of the town element prevailed. So Eva, after a feeble protest in favour of a few Durham favourites of her own, succumbed, and the notes were written, sealed, posted, and replied to in due course. Mr. Marsh, too, was in a wondrous bustle as the time drew near, providing, and with Martin's help packing, sundry mysterious hampers, the contents of which had kept Nancy and Bella running to and fro, from pantry to dresser, and dresser to oven, flushed and faint with heat, though with open doors and windows, the immense fire almost roasting the cook as well as the joints and poultry. The cousins, protesting that \"black crape bonnets were heavy,\" and their \"paramatta dresses unendurable,\" Eva coaxed the willing old gentleman to replenish their purses, with especial reference to white crape bonnets, challis dresses, and muslin pelerines. Then ensued a series of journeys to and from drapers, and milliners and dress-makers ; with such a fitting-on and trying-on as was surely never seen \u2014 except on just such another occasion, anywhere else. The important day came, and the expected guests assembled. Several arrived the previous evening, and beds were extempor ised in all unsuspected nooks of the old-fashioned rambling house. Mary Reed, however, did not come, for the simple reason she had not been asked, Cuthbert declaring he \"forgot all about it,\" and begging Eva \"never to mind, as it couldn't be helped then.\" Eva did \"mind,\" for she loved her friend, and knowing Mary's quiet and monotonous life, hoped to have given her a pleasant and beneficial change, and she was surprised not more at Cuthbert's forgetfulness than at his light and indiffer ent manner of treating the subject. Of course Rhoda was not surprised; and if she \"minded,\" the word bore another signification to her. There were the Middletons from Sedgefield ; the Teesdales G"], [94, "82 STUNG TO THE QUICK. from Trimdon; the Forsters from Sacristan; the Applegarths from Brancepeth; but only the three Miss Adamsons and a stray bachelor or two from Durham itself. Clear and propitious shone the morn, when at a tolerably early hour the party began to assemble in South Street, regardless of the hill. Many were the curious eyes peering from behind windows, many the little urchins astride the low wall to watch the equipages arrive and \"depart ; and as hamper after hamper was brought out and strapped to the carriages, baskets too heavy for their handles placed under the seats, ladies handed in, and their cavaliers seated beside them, various exclamations of conjecture or astonishment were openly uttered, bursting into a loud \" hooray \" as the vehicles rolled away, to the satisfaction of all but the horses \u2014 and they would have preferred lighter loads. Off they went, down the hill and up again, through Millburn gate, along Framwellgate, and soon were bowling along the North Road,* laughing and chatting merrily, as people do when thoroughly bent on enjoying themselves. On they went, taking the old by-road at Aycliffe, up hill and down dale, under the bluest of blue skies, the most fervid of summer suns ; on they went, and in due time arrived at Finchale, and unpacked first the carriages, then the hampers. Sharp fellows were those monks of olden time, with a keen sense of the beautiful, whether in art or nature ; practical old fellows too, knowing as if by instinct where to erect their rook eries. Wood and water, hill and dale, rare pasturage and clear springs, were the essentials for the site of either abbey or monas tery. There must be good promise of food, fire, and water, or they would none of it. Every monastery was not a Hospice of St. Bernard, nor every cowled brother a Monk of La Trappe ! Accordingly the instinctive wisdom of the founder of Finchale had led to the selection of a deep and fertile vale, almost encircled by a bend of the river Wear, sheltered from the north winds by the lofty rocks and hanging woods of Cocken, and on * The New or present North Road did not then exist."], [95, "PREPARING FOR A PLEASANT PIC-NIC. 83 every other side enclosed by steep hills. The river, broken here and there into beauty by its rocky bed, still flows swiftly by, curving round the level plot where Finchale Abbey stood, much as it sweeps round Durham Cathedral. But the former is a shattered and fragmentary ruin, in a fair, green valley, amid ancient woods ; the latter remains still a magnificent temple to the Most High, crowning with its massive pillars, its antique towers, its heavy buttressed walls, a lofty hill sur rounded by a city on other hills, which has erewhile been likened unto a \"map of Zion.\" The monks are gone from both, yet still the white-stoled chorister sings a Te Deum in the cathedral's ancient choir, and strangers with hushed steps and voices loiter in chancel, or galilee, or cloister, to wonder and admire; but through the broken arches of the cross shaped abbey no anthem rings save the summer hymn of birds, or the wild winds of winter wailing o'er decay. Visitors come and go, but not to meditate or worship; not with hushed voice and reverent step; they come in groups to laugh, and sing, and feast and make merry, forgetful alike of the saint who founded or the monks who feasted there. No rueful thoughts of the dead and gone occupants of the ruined abbey therefore disturbed the gleeful party presided over by Mr. Marsh, Mr. Hesketh, and Dr. Grove, who had announced \" they could manage the matter to everybody's satisfaction without the interference of any meddling women,\" and, confident in their own capabilities, marshalled their followers to the refreshment-house (erected in the grounds for the convenience of such visitors), attended by Martin and his comrades hamper-laden. Mr. Marsh laughed, Mr. Hesketh swore, whilst Dr. Grove, biting his thumb-nail and half-closing his eyes, put on his studying cap, when the person in charge quietly informed them that the rooms had been engaged a fortnight previously for a large and exclusive party. Any other little accom modation they might require (such as heating their kettles at"], [96, "84 STUNG TO THE QUICK. tea-time) they could have, but the rooms were not at liberty. For a few moments three blank faces gazed at the woman and at each other, broken at length by the expostulations of Mr. Hesketh, who, wiping his hot forehead with a hand kerchief scarcely redder than his face, preferred to \" refresh\" in the shade rather than in the sunshine. Laughing at their own discomfiture and his choleric com panion's chagrin, Mr. Marsh exclaimed, \" Never mind, Hes keth, let us despise the sour grapes and not whine about them. After all, close walls and roofs are stifling on a sunshiny day. Besides, a gipsy party loses half its character when the greensward is exchanged for a boarded floor; so let us adjourn to the shelter of the ruins without more ado. Doctor, here, will tell you that there is no fear of our catching either rheu matism or ague from a seat on damp grass.\" \"Damp grass! I should think not, with the thermometer where it has stood the last four days. More danger of sun stroke than ague, to my mind.\" \" And little danger of either while there is a tree or wall to cast a shadow,\" interposed the doctor, smiling at Mr. Hesketh's dolorous tone. \" What a pretty figure we cut after our declaration that we were competent to make all arrangements without assistance ! I've a notion we look like three simpletons,\" exclaimed the perplexed purveyor, with an angry effort to beat down with his red handkerchief a buzzing fly which seemed determined to settle on his crimson forehead. \" Well, well, Hesketh, it's no use lamenting over a trifle like this. Come along; we shall be certain to enjoy ourselves most in the open air,\" remonstrated Mr. Marsh. \"That we shall, godpapa; it will be such fun to dine on the grass. I should like it very much better than dining off a table, we do that all the year round \u2014 what do you think, Rhoda?\" said Eva, coaxingly to the discomposed gentleman, putting her arm within his to lead him away during the appeal to her cousin."], [97, "85 FOR A MERE SONG. \" Oh, I think the ruins infinitely preferable,\" was Rhoda's ready response, as she turned away amid the \"So do I's\" of the assembled group. A sudden stop, an involuntary shiver, were followed by a glance of haughty defiance, as her eye rested for a single instant on a party advancing. \" Confound the woman ! Who could have thought of this ?\" muttered Mr. Hesketh between his set teeth, as, yielding to the gentle pressure of Eva's arm, he suffered himself to be led away, and came face to face with \u2014 Mrs. Hesketh and Lucy. Mrs. Coulson followed, and a very large sample of the Durham feminine population, with their attendant esquires : but the two who led the van alone attracted the attention of Rhoda and Mr. Hesketh, as their tormentors sailed forward with malicious triumph labelled on their foreheads. \" Good morning, Mr. Hesketh, \" drawled out the former, with a sneer, as she curtsied almost to the ground. \" Delightful day this for a dinner al fresco. I trust you may find every thing to your satisfaction, and that you will suffer no annoy ance from the midges \u2014 they are frequently very troublesome at this season under the trees.\" \" Midges, indeed ! I know of no midges with stings equal to yours and Lucy's and I do intend to enjoy myself, depend upon it, madam,\" retorted he, furious at finding the wife whom he had imagined safe in Durham there before him, evidently brimful of mischief, and quite as palpably the indi vidual who had forestalled his plans by pre-engaging the refreshment-house. CHAPTER XIII. FOR A MERE SONG. Mr. and Mrs. Hesketh were by no means what Tim Linkin water designated \" a comfortable couple ; \" for notwithstanding his natural cheerfulness and geniality, his love of ease and"], [98, "86 STUNG TO THE QUICK. social enjoyment, the continual droppings of \"a contentious woman\" drove comfort from their home, and the husband after it, in pursuit of the truant. He fled to avoid those quarrels which he shrank from, but which are ever the inevitable offspring of a choleric man and a narrow-minded aggravating woman. Consequently, a few years after his second marriage he separated his office from the house in Old Elvet, and removed his business as estate agent and surveyor to rooms in Sadler Street, where, such was his easy-going disposition, he forgot his household troubles until reminded by the chimes of the neigh bouring cathedral that punctuality at the dinner or tea-table was indispensable, and he turned homewards with a sigh of resignation. Thus it was that after venting his annoyance in the given retort to Mrs. Hesketh, he hastened with Eva after their retreating party, and once out of sight of his domestic tyrant, banished the unpleasant subject from his mind as summarily as was his wont. Built, as usual, in the form of a cross, there had been in the centre of the church where the four limbs joined, a tower or spire erected on four massive circular pillars, so massive that one of them contained a turnpike or winding staircase which led to the superstructure. In the space between these pillars they found their laughing friends lounging or bustling according to their different temperaments. \"Here, Hesketh,\" called Mr. Marsh, as they drew near, \"we have pitched upon this spot with due regard for your wishes and conveniences. As there are four pillars, you may shelter from the sun whatever quarter he shines from, or you may have a nap in that staircase, which we are converting into a wine-cooler. Hang the rooms, say I, we must have paid cash down for them, and I am told we can take the turnpike upon trust.\" Mr. Hesketh, who was deeply interested in the negotiation of sundry turnpike-trusts, laughed at this sally, turned up his"], [99, "87 FOR A MERE SONG. cuffs, and came forward to assist the search then going on for a corkscrew. Not more than half the glasses were broken, and no wine was spilled, but corkscrews had been forgotten. \" I have one,\" exclaimed Edwin Grove (the doctor's son and heir), at the same time producing one of those multum in-parvo pocket-knives which always promise so much and generally perform so little. He had been deluded into the purchase of the implement by a crafty itinerant representing himself \"a Sheffield cutler out of work,\" his charity being stimulated by a knowledge of the approaching trip. The wine was old, the cork rebellious, and snap went the gimcrack corkscrew the first pull. However, bottle-necks are not made of adamant, so the omissions and accidents were alike of little importance ; and the thirsty travellers having refreshed, separated into parties or pairs to wander amongst the trees, or to explore the ancient ruins. Rhoda, to Cuthbert's chagrin, very adroitly set him aside, in order to attach herself to Mr. Raeburn as guide during his explorations, he being strange to the spot, she familiar with it from childhood. Very fascinating she was ; very beau tiful in her transparent white crape bonnet, very ladylike; and did the honours of the ruins so elaborately, yet so un pretendingly, and with such beseeching tenderness of tone and manner, though modest withal, that Frank needed some amulet to preserve him from her allurements. Eva felt unaccountably nervous when Rhoda took possession of Mr. Raeburn, but soon forgot her half-formed fears in the excite ment of scolding Cuthbert for not bringing Mary, who would have been delighted to join them, she was sure, had she been invited. \" If I had thought you would have been so careless, I would have sent to her by post,\" said she; \"I never knew you guilty of forgetting a message or neglecting to deliver a note before.\" \" The more reason why you should forgive me now, if it"], [100, "88 STUNG TO THE QUICK. is a first offence,\" argued the delinquent, little relishing the turn the colloquy was taking. \"Yes ; but Cuthbert, I cannot understand why you should forget this particular message. I am puzzled to comprehend how you could remember to come yourself and yet appear without Mary. If I were Mary, I should quarrel with you for it.\" \"No, you would not, Eva. I know you better; you might, perhaps, threaten war, but your little soft heart would sur render before the first gun was fired, and you would forgive me, kiss me, and be better friends than ever.\" \" Indeed I should not, Mr. Saucy ; I should be very much displeased ; and if that is your experience of Mary's placa bility, I must say she is too amiable by half; and you don't deserve so good a creature, /shall never forgive you \u2014 never.\" Notwithstanding the half-playful manner in which he was taken to task, still Cuthbert felt this to be dangerous ground, and, unsuspected by Eva, led her at a quickened pace to join a group of strollers close at hand, in order to change the topic for one of more general interest. Mr. Hesketh, who had a leaning towards a favourite key bugle, had brought it with him and employed the instrument as a signal to summon the wanderers to dinner, which he and Martin had laid out on the whitest of white table cloths, spread on the greenest of grass. Soon the stragglers made their appearance, and seated themselves gipsy fashion; plates clattered, knives and forks rattled, bottles were decapitated, pie-crusts crumbled like fortresses in a siege, ham and tongues were carved, and chickens dissected by Doctor Grove (appointed head carver by Mr. Marsh as a sort of practical joke), and the great business of dining proceeded amidst mirth and laughter. Cuthbert had contrived to steal round to Rhoda's side, and thereupon she afforded him a few of her pleasant smiles to make digestion easy. Frank Raeburn devoted himself to no one lady in particu-"], [101, "89 FOR A MERE SONG. lar, though he was careful Eva lacked nothing he could procure for her. Edwin Grove, with his coat turned inside out as a livery, professed himself waiter in ordinary, and desired Martin to remember that for that occasion he (Martin) was butler only, and so must not interfere with his duties as general attendant. Martin nodded slily and cunningly as he replied, \"Thank ye, Maister Ed'n, aw expect a guid day's darg* wi'out meddlin' wi' mair than aw can manage cannily. Theer's like te be a famous drouth this het day; an' so aw thank yo' heartily.\" So Mr. Edwin, with his purple silk sleeve linings outside, was called hither and thither to supply wants real or imaginary in the edible line, and, in his self-imposed task, the waiter came more than ever within range of the bat tery of Rhoda's smiles and glances. Her requests were made known, her thanks expressed with so winning a grace, that the young aspirant for medical honours was captivated at once, and became most assiduous in his attendance, to the palpable neglect of his duties elsewhere. Dr. Grove was not so occupied with his anatomical pursuits as to be unobservant of what passed around him, and, without apparent motive, quickly summoned the \" waiter \" from so dan gerous a neighbourhood, and provided him with ample employ ment elsewhere. Still, Edwin made occasions for speech with the gracious belle, whom he remembered but as an imperious school-girl, only remarkable for very black eyes, very black hair, and a profound contempt for boys. He had heard of her latterly, it is true, but not in very flattering terms; and, being prepared to meet an arrogant dame, too scornful and self-sufficient to be attractive, he was more than agreeably surprised. He was disposed to attribute envy to his informant, and where he found unexpected beauty and suavity to ascribe also every grace and virtue which should be beauty's dower. * Day's work."], [102, "90 STUNG TO THE QUICK. So he lingered near her, and when the waiter himself found leisure to dine, carried his plate with him, and seated himself beside the universal charmer, much to the disgust of Cuthbert, who did not care to have a pleasant tete-a-tete interrupted. Setting aside ' the gratification of Rhoda's vanity and love of power, she hailed Edwin Grove's approach as serving to abate the exclusive appearance of Cuthbert's devotion, afraid lest Mr. Raeburn should observe, credit her with flirtation, and resign all pretentions to her himself. She had quite convinced herself that he was a silent devotee at her shrine, and having no desire to lose the substance for the shadow, therefore skilfully avoided any display of particular preference, unless, indeed, it were for himself. After dinner there were fresh rambles, then an assemblage for singing. Edwin Grove produced a flute, on which he was by no means a bad player, and then, sultry as the day had been, dancing was proposed, when key-bugle and flute were both called into requisition. Again Rhoda contrived to monopolize Mr. Raeburn, but Eva had insisted that Dr. Grove should dance and be her partner, and they were vis-a-vis. Cuthbert and Miss Middleton, Mr. March and Miss Applegarth made up one set. Rhoda, as grace ful a dancer as she was an accomplished musician, moved over the grass as elegantly as on a ball-room floor, dispensing smiles and sweet words to all the gentlemen in turn \u2014 reserving her blandest for Cuthbert, her truest for Frank. She had brought her sketch-book with her, and strolled away to pencil some delightful \" bits \" of scenery ; not that she cared to exercise her skill as an artist, but she had a vague hope Mr. Raeburn would follow her. He did not, but Cuthbert did; and she rebuked him sharply for making his attentions so conspi cuous. Somewhat crestfallen, he retired, resolved to make himself agreeable to Eva; but he found her listening with sparkling eyes to something Frank Raeburn had spoken for her especial ear."], [103, "FOR A MERE SONG. 91 Up to this period, with the single exception of the morning surprise, all had gone \"merry as a marriage bell;\" and Mr. Marsh, gratified by the pleasure of others, was quite in his ele ment. Stray groups of the rival parties had met in their ram bles, but they passed and re-passed unmarked, from the fact that the Marsh party was principally composed of strangers to Dur ham and its denizens. Mr. Hesketh had taken an early opportunity to whisper to his friend Marsh his fears lest some unpleasantness might occur, the body of visitors who had so quietly supplanted themselves being his wife and her friends, half the gossips and mischief-makers of Durham. Mr. Marsh only laughed, and declaring it a capital joke, an act of skilful generalship, proposed that a flag of truce should be sent into the enemy's camp, to suggest an immediate amalgama tion of their respective forces \u2014 a proposal the discomfited husband negatived at once, as sure to cause a revolt amongst their own immediate followers ; and nothing more was said of amalgamation. When hour after hour went by without interference or intru sion, Mr. Hesketh began to hope he had been mistaken in his wife's motive and manner, and that the rencontre was the result of accident : a delusion disagreeably dispelled before the day departed. After her summary dismissal of Cuthbert, Rhoda continued her solitary walk a short distance ; then seating herself on an old grey stone coated with moss and lichens, arranged her few materials, and began to sketch the view of river and ruin spread out before her. She had occupied the same seat years before in moody reverie when Mr. Marsh drove her, a convalescent patient, over to Finchale occasionally for change of air and scene, and she turned to the well-known spot naturally, without a thought that the dining-house was separated from her retreat only by a few straggling trees. She pencilled her outlines with a firm, bold hand, casting fre-"], [104, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 92 quent and anxious glances outwards in hope to see Mr. Raeburn advance in quest of her; a bolder stroke of her pencil than ordinary, a more rugged touch given to rock or ruin, alone betraying her impatience and disappointment. \" A masterly touch that,\" uttered by a voice above, caused her to look upward. Mr. Edwin Grove was bending towards her, glass in eye, watching the progress of her drawing very complacently. \" How you startledme ! I thought I was alone ! \" exclaimed she, closing the book and rising instantly. \" Is Miss Wearbank so little acquainted with the power of her own charms as to suppose she can absent herself from her friends without being missed ? \" said the gentleman, de ferentially. \" Miss Wearbank never gave the matter a moment's con sideration, \" replied she, with a slight shrug of the shoulders, gathering up her pencils as she continued, \" I had promised a drawing to a friend, and thought this a favourable opportunity to redeem my word. \" \" Do not suffer me .to be the cause of your friend's disap pointment, I beg. Pray resume your seat and occupation. I shall be proud to remain in attendance as your pencil bearer. Your humble servant a second time to-day. \" A little hesitancy, a few more words of entreaty, and Miss Wearbank complied with the request so gallantly urged. \" Have you any recollection, Miss Wearbank, of the great rough schoolboy who used to pelt Miss Marsh and yourself with snowballs so unmercifully all the way from the Bailey to your own door? I remember well your vigorous retalia tion, and later your supreme scorn as contrasted with your companion's laughter, or tears when the frolic went too far. Have you a pardon now for the rude fellow who tormented you then ? \" \" As my* memory does not go back so far to either school days or schoolboys, I presume pardon to be unnecessary, \" replied she, looking up with a bland smile which belied the bitter"], [105, "FOR A MERE SONG. 93 memories crowding round her heart and strengthened by his words. Just then, as if to intensify her pain, from the open windows behind the trees came rolling forth, distinct and clear as a good and powerful singer could give it, a rollicking song with a semi pathetic refrain, which was caught up as a chorus by all the male voices, more than one feminine tone blending with the rest. The song told ludicrously the story of a poor little lambkin dropped on the banks of the Wear, rescued and petted to please a spoiled child ; but which growing bigger, more sheepish, and more troublesome as time went by, was finally resigned to the butcher and the cook. The burden of each stanza marked a gradation of the story, varying from \" A poor little lambkin, a waif of the Wear, ' to \" The last of their lambkin, the waif of the Wear.\" The song arrested Rhoda's attention; her pencil dropped, she listened with lips apart and eyeballs fixed, powerless to move. Her own story was caricatured from the beginning ; \u2014 and the end \u2014 it told her what she might expect when her friends were weary of her. She clenched her hands and ground her teeth in a futile attempt to disguise her outraged feelings and subdue her emotion ; Edwin Grove standing by in extreme perplexity, comprehending each coarse allusion, yet afraid to wound a sensitive mind still more by any open recognition of the insult. They were not the only hearers. Cuthbert, hovering near the region his enslaver occupied, passed under the windows and applauded loudly what he called a \" capital song, \" in blissful ignorance of its hidden meaning; for, as he was seldom at home, and when there \" never listened to women's yarns, \" all he knew of Rhoda's parentage was that some mystery at tached to it. A posse of their companions, with Mr. Hesketh and Mr. Marsh"], [106, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 94 in their midst, desirous to have a game at threadneedle or for feits before tea, had come in search of the three absentees, and choosing different paths reached the vicinity of the building in time to hear more or less of the song. \" A capital song, you scoundrel ! what do you mean ? It is an infamous song, a dastardly attack on a defenceless girl. But I'll know the author of it. Move out of the way ! \" As he spoke, old Mr. Hesketh, fuming with indignation, brushed past his bewildered son, thrust aside the housekeeper who blocked the doorway, and darted into the midst of his wife's gleeful party, with no very clear notion what he was about to do. Cuthbert, however, foreseeing a \" squall, \" and knowing there were \" breakers ahead \" (as he afterwards owned), plunged after his father as soon as he had recovered from his own astonishment. Then ensued an uproar which baffles description. Mrs. Hesketh, with curling lip and exultant eye, met her hus band almost on the threshold, and bade him return to the party he came with; her friends did not require his society. Spluttering with passion, he confronted her much more boldly than his wont. \" Your friends, indeed, madam ! Thank God they are not mine! I demand to know who sang that song? \" and he looked resolutely around the room. \"Perhaps the gentleman, whom I have not the honour of knowing, will favour us with the title of the song he refers to. ' That song' is rather indefinite, considering the number we have been favoured with this afternoon,\" drawled out a young puppy, scarcely out of his teens, in a most supercilious tone. \"Don't beat about the bush, you landlubber; you know what song my father means well enough ! \" thrust in Cuthbert, testily, for the first glimpse of his stepmother's face had told him there was mischief afloat, and she at the helm. \" Upon my honour !

There was a momentary lull as Jack Fortescue, resigning the defence of his cowardly fellow-student, turned round to confront the new comer. \" Well ! I own Jack Fortescue did sing it, and moreover Jack Fortescue wrote it ! But what if I did ? Is there anything in the song that should raise all this hubbub ? \" \" Anything in it ! \u2014 malice was in it, and mischief, and you know it! \" \" Keep your temper down, old gentleman ! I have an old father at home, and respect grey hairs ; but my temper's none of the longest. Ready for mischief I may be, but I'll be hanged if I ever mixed malice or meanness with my mischief, drunk or sober. \" \" That's true, Jack, and every one knows it,\" assented Edwin Grove. \"Mr. Hesketh, I don't believe Jack Fortescue, wild as he is, could have written that song with a double meaning.\""], [108, "96 STUNG TO THE QUICK. It was the unfortunate musical poet's turn to look bewildered. \" Double meaning! certainly not.\" \"Then how came you to write it at all, and sing it to insult a lady and her friends ? \" blurted out the irate old man. \"Simple enough. I wrote it at the desire of two ladies, who gave me the outline, which I threw into verse. I did not sing to insult anyone.\" \" I thought as much ! \" broke simultaneously from Cuthbert and Mr. Hesketh, as their reproachful glances turned from him to Mrs. Hesketh and Lucy. Mrs. Coulson and Mrs. Hesketh had been the spurs in the sides of their poet's Pegasus ; not Lucy, she was only a consent ing party ; and while Mr. Fortescue was flattered and cajoled, installed into office as comptroller of their projected excursion, kept (as was very common with him) in a state of constant exhilaration with good wine, and primed to write or do anything they asked, Lucy remained wisely in the background. But she had sat at the open window whilst he sang, a window overlooking Rhoda's seat, and with grim satisfaction noted the result. She saw that the shaft had gone home, and rejoiced the more because she beheld Edwin Grove, her own admirer, bend ing over her old rival ; doubly her rival now. So when Edwin (whose surprise at seeing her in the room may be guessed) assumed a lover's right to disapprove her share in the mean plot against another woman's peace, she denied being an accessory most strenuously ; and to his rebuke for being in such society without his protection ( ' such society' mean ing that of Jack Fortescue), retorted very readily and pertinently armed with the evidence of her own eyes. A quarrel (unheard in the louder commotion near the door) resulted. Both were equally angry, equally in the wrong, equally jealous of private rights and privileges, equally jealous of power over the other. Lucy would not surrender an inch of ground \u2014 Edwin \"would not be dictated to by any woman under the sun.\" The wrangling ended in his turning sharply on his heel and following Mr. Hesketh and Cuthbert from the room, loftily"], [109, "ECHOES OF THE SONG. 97 resolved to have nothing more to say to a girl who questioned his right to admire a beautiful woman, to be civil to one, or even to enjoy himself apart from her. CHAPTER XIV. ECHOES OF THE SONG. Not only the song, but much of the altercation in the room had been overheard by Rhoda, who seemed chained to the spot, her features having the stony rigidity and pallor Martin had noted with so much concern. Edwin Grove, therefore, had hailed the arrival of Mr. Marsh and his father as giving him a pretext for quitting a painful post and rushing into the fray. Not so hot-headed as Mr. Hesketh, Mr. Marsh, instead of hastening forward to swell the number of disputants, and give an idle but malicious song undue importance, led Rhoda away, treated the matter lightly for her sake, and bade her dismiss the whole from her mind as unworthy her notice. To his surprise, and yet more to that of Dr. Grove, she shook off her stupor, called up a smile, and professed herself perfectly at ease, greatly astonished so much commotion should be made over a simple song, and begged that she might hear no more of the matter; she was sorry that any thing connected with her poor self should have destroyed the harmony of either party, and hoped the affair might be permitted to drop and the festivities resumed as though nothing had occurred. \"I, for my part,\" concluded she, \" shall not allow a silly song to interfere with my enjoyment of the afternoon.\" Mr. Marsh, who did not see far beneath the surface, was delighted to find she took so rational a view of the insult, and privately intimated to Dr. Grove his deep appreciation H"], [110, "98 STUNG TO THE QUICK. of her magnanimity, to which that discreet personage only responded by the customary \" Humph ! \" which served him instead of speech when he had not quite made up his mind on a subject. Rhoda had long been a study to him, and as he walked on by Mr. Marsh's side, with his left hand over his mouth, his thumbnail between his teeth, and his eyes half-closed, he regarded her askance from beneath their lids, and pondered; and the deeper he studied the less was he satisfied with the result. Until games were proposed, Eva had scarcely missed her cousin. She had been occupied with endeavours to enter tain her friends, more particularly their own guests, finding beaus for the three mature and prim Miss Adamsons, healing an old feud between the Applegarths and Middletons, and when the exploring party returned with Rhoda in their midst, composed but pale, she was standing by Mr. Raeburn's side, listening very intently to a long debate between Mr. Tees dale, of Trimdon, and Mr. Forster, from Sacristan,* on a recent colliery grievance, in which owners and pitmen were alike concerned. Each gentleman \u2014 one a viewer of consider able experience, the other a young owner of extensive col lieries \u2014 held a different opinion, and each strove to imbue Mr. Raeburn, as an individual deeply interested in the question, with his own views and tenets. Mr. Raeburn, however, though a comparative stranger to his own possessions, had taken care to be well informed on all subjects connected therewith; he was, moreover, accus tomed to think for himself, and, without obtruding his own opinions, had sufficient firmness to utter and maintain them when necessary. During this discussion, carried on with considerable spirit, Eva listened with profound attention to a mass of technical gibberish about \"hewers\" and \"putters,\" and \"corves\" and \"creeps,\" and \"kirvens,\" and \"nickens,\" and \"trams,\" and * Pronounced Saggasen by the natives."], [111, "ECHOES OF THE SONG. 99 \"shafts,\" though she understood but few of the terms and nothing of the argument; still her eye lit with animation whensoever Mr. Raeburn posed an opponent, betokening her interest in the speaker, if not in the topic under considera tion. Rhoda's white cheek flushed as her quick eye took in the group at a glance. Eva's radiant countenance turned towards Mr. Raeburn caused her a pang second only to the torture inflicted by the luckless song. Still she came forward with accustomed ease, smiling as though nothing had occurred to ruffle her, and affably pro nounced herself willing to join in any game decided on by the majority. Handkerchiefs were produced, young and old ranged in couples as for a country dance, with the kerchiefs held by each pair high over head to form an arcade, under which the top couple were to thread the needle. The signal had been given, Mr. Marsh and Miss Adamson had run the gauntlet, only to be trapped at last, when up came Mr. Hesketh, flushed and excited, with Cuthbert and Edwin close at his heels. \"I'm very glad the poor bairn did not hear the ruffians,\" remarked he to the young men, as they drew near and beheld the unruffled mien of Rhoda. \" By* Jove, but yon's a lass with a brave spirit !\" exclaimed Edwin Grove. \"She heard every word as plainly as I did. and I saw the sting went deep ; yet there she stands, calm and dignified as Juno, with the very smile of a divinity.\" \" Heard all ! Poor bairn, poor bairn ! That wife of mine seems bent on driving the girl mad. I would not have Maria's heart or her tongue to be made Marquis of Lon donderry ! \" \"Edwin,\" whispered Dr. Grove, who, standing aloof from a game he considered beneath the dignity of his profession,"], [112, "100 STUNG TO THE QUICK. had, loitering near, overheard his son's admiring ejaculation, \" don't be quite so lavish with hyperbole. Miss Wearbank is unquestionably a fine young woman, but very far from a divinity. Nay,\" continued he, with a hand on his son's arm, seeing him about to reply, \" nay, my boy, I admit the bravery, but I don't admire it. She is nothing more than a good actress, or I am greatly deceived.\" \"You must be mistaken, father; she was haughty as an empress when a school-girl.\" \" A doubtful simile, Edwin; but let it pass. She has changed marvellously since then. I would say nothing against the young lady were you not my son, and it is my duty to warn you not always to take a woman upon trust. Look what a bitter pill Hesketh has had to swallow; his Tartar was mild as cream before matrimony, but is tartar-emetic now, and no mistake.\" \"Why, father, you are positively punning,\" laughed the son, anxious to vary the discourse. \" Ah, caught the Marsh fever, I suppose ! Evil communi cations do corrupt good manners. And now go your way, but remember what I have said.\" The needle being threaded to everybody's satisfaction, even Rhoda's, since she had been selected by Mr. Raeburn (on the inspiration, be it known, of Mr. Marsh, who had contrived to pair her with one ignorant of the afternoon's storm), Mr. Marsh, always careful of others, in order to avoid any possible collision with their neighbours, early in the evening proposed they should alter their programme, not trouble the housekeeper for hot water, lest somebody or everybody should get into hot water, but drive back and have tea comfortably in South Street. The allusion, pretty well understood, silenced all dissent. Mr. Hesketh's bugle sounded once more, calling Martin and his compeers from a game at \"put.\" The greasy cards were thrust into one pocket, the divided stakes into others; hampers, much lightened, were replaced,"], [113, "ECHOES OF THE SONG. 101 the friends hastily reseated, and homeward the horses' heads were turned. Nancy was not a cook easily disconcerted ; still the advent of twenty-two or three hungry individuals, unexpectedly, would create a surprise anywhere, and though the besieging party brought with them a tolerable commissariat, still what might pass muster for a second meal at a pic-nic would present but a sorry sight to the very same guests under their entertainer's roof, after the second packing and extra shaking of the home journey. So Nancy and Bella were both put upon their mettle, and while Martin dived into the hampers for unmutilated pies or poultry, tongue or ham, gathered and washed fresh parsley, fennel, and vine leaves for garnish, cress and crisp lettuces for salad, by them reserve china and plate were uncloseted, drapery selected from the linen-press, short-cakes, fizzers, and singing hinnies * hastily prepared for the oven and griddle, jam and marmalade turned out into shining glass, and, with a celerity utterly unknown to southern servants, tea-urns were filled and the numberless et ceteras comprehended in a north country tea placed on the table, so as not to discredit either the skill of the cook or the hospitality of the cook's master. This was the first festive gathering which had taken place since the death of Mrs. Marsh, and a shade of sadness passed over the face of the widower as Rhoda assumed the position at the head of the board which his wife had been wont to fill, arranging the guests and commanding the servants, with none of the diffidence or hesitance of a novice, but easily and gracefully, yet with a dignity all her own. With equal ease and grace, though with less confidence, Eva presided at the lower end of the table, with no thought of the great contrast they presented. Nor did any idea of a want of fitness in their positions glance over the minds of either herself or her father. The reins of government had fallen so naturally into the * Local tea-cakes, the latter with currants."], [114, "102 STUNG TO THE QUICK. hands of Rhoda during their great bereavement, when the rest of the household were abandoned to grief; she looked so much older than Eva, so much more fitted to command, and the latter had so little jealousy or love of power in her composition, she ceded her right to Rhoda tacitly, without any suspicion that she made a concession. But visitors have often quick eyes for discrepancies of the kind, and more than one whispered remark was hazarded on the subject. Dr. Grove, sitting midway down the length ened table, leaned across to his opposite neighbour, Mr. Raeburn, and glancing upwards and downwards, said in an undertone, \" What a remarkable contrast. To what might we compare them ? \" \"To Art and Nature,\" suggested the gentleman addressed. \" Ah, yes, or Night and Morning,\" answered the doctor, meaningly, as he subsided to his former position, and assisted the lady on his right to a \"leetle more tongue.\" Amid the low murmur of voices, the tinkle of silver, glass and china, the faint rattle of knives and forks, none of these whispers could reach the ear of Rhoda, apparently absorbed in her duties as hostess; but she observed when eyes glanced towards her, and a voice lowered, and acutely sensitive on the point, felt herself and her origin the one subject under discussion. The burden of Jack Fortescue's song seemed to float in the air around her, every lip to shape \" The Waif of the Wear,\" until her heart ached to agony, and she longed for the solitude of her own room, where she might throw away the mask she wore with so much pain. But there was no solitude for her that night ; the crowded state of the house precluded it. Spare beds, and extra beds in such rooms as would hold them, were all doubly occupied, and she must hide her misery as best she might. There are women, however, who have nerve for anything, and Rhoda was one of these. She did the honours of the table faultlessly, and later in the evening laughed, danced, played, and sang as unfalteringly"], [115, "ECHOES OF THE SONG. 103 as any lady present. More than one country beau was bewil dered by her bewitching beauty, and being rebuked for remissness or inattention to the lady of his true allegiance, had to do penance for the dereliction afterwards. She contrived to make Cuthbert happy with a few hurried words, and smiled an encouragement to Edwin, who fluttered near her, in spite of his father's caution, exonerating himself on the plea that to do less would prove him influenced by Jack Fortescue's allusions. Then she found time to laugh at Mr. Marsh's little witti cisms, to discuss fashions with Miss Adamson, and the lan guage of flowers with Miss Forster; yet amidst it all she never once lost sight of Frank Raeburn \u2014 she seemed to know by intuition when he was near her, and never failed to make the most of the opportunity. She remembered having heard him object long before to waltzing, citing Lord Byron's \" Ode to Waltz \" in justification of his sentiments, and so took care in his hearing to refuse more than one partner, declining to waltz or \"polk\" on principle. She cleverly contrived to interpose artificial barriers between him and Eva, and managed unsuspectedly to lure him to her side, and keep him there under the dangerous fascination of an eye love-lit and a voice intoned with intense feeling. But there was no responsive thrill in his heart, no echo in his voice; although he tested her with flattery and com pliment which in truth she sought from him more than from any other. To heal a wound in her heart she courted flattery, more than to feed her vanity ; but he saw only the latter, and turned from the glare of her beauty to merry little Eva, whom he would not have dared to insult with a flattering word. The party did not break up until long after midnight, the three Miss Adamsons being escorted to the North Bailey by a body-guard comprising the two Heskeths, Mr. Raeburn, and a couple of stray bachelors who were neighbours. Brothers, sisters, and sweethearts separated for the night;"], [116, "104 STUNG TO THE QUICK. shake-downs were arranged on sofas and chairs, laughing girls huddled together in their chambers in most unstudied dis habille to discuss the events of the day, compare notes, and rally each other on conquests, real or imaginary, during the brushing and combing process known as \"doing the hair.\" But girlish chatter must cease some time, and one by one the noises in the house subsided into silence. Mr. Marsh, satisfied by Rhoda's manner that she had overcome all her girlish sensitiveness about her parentage, and gratified that the evening had passed so merrily, slept soundly and peaceably, as those do who have no care save for the good of others. Rhoda, however, retired to rest mad with suppressed rage at the insult so wantonly offered to her, and with all con cerned therein \u2014 with Mrs. Hesketh as the prime mover, she was furious, and mentally vowed revenge; with Mr. Hesketh she was enraged for a championship which only made her more conspicuous, and the stigma in the song indelible. She blamed him for interference in what did not concern him, yet, strange to say, was equally indignant that Mr. Marsh should sit down tamely under an insult which did concern him. She had overheard the eldest Miss Adamson, whilst dis robing before tea, thus relieve the curiosity of Miss Forster and Jessy Applegarth, who had no clear understanding how the song in question could refer to Mr. Marsh's niece, or. why such a fuss was made about it: \u2014 \"When I was a girl, some eight years old (twelve she should have said), I remember a very snowy Christmas, when there was a dreadful flood, and a woman committed suicide just below this house, leaving a poor half-starved baby on the bank. Mr. Marsh took it in, kept it, and brought it up as his niece, and that baby was Miss Wearbank, and of course she was the 'Waif of the Wear,' so unfeelingly sneered at; as if she could help herself when a baby, poor thing.\" Rhoda had overheard all this, and felt that the epithet would cling to her in spite of fate ; she would be the laughingstock of"], [117, "ECHOES OF THE SONG. 105 girls and gossiping women. Even Mr. Raeburn must learn it, and despise her; and she ground her teeth and tossed uneasily on her pillow, where she dared not utter her agony aloud. Then again she was only half satisfied with the result of her day's scheming. Cuthbert was devotedly bound to her, but what impression had she made on Mr. Raeburn ? Could she have mistaken his compliments or his intentions ? Or had she overplayed her part? She had done her utmost to disguise her flirtation with the captain, and as earnestly endeavoured to elicit Frank's sentiments towards herself. In this she had failed signally. He was most attentive, most gentlemanlike, most obliging, but there was no tenderness in his tone. He never made opportunities to be near her, alone with her. Yet why, if he did not love her, was he so constant a visitor at their house? Surely Eva's baby face did not draw him thither! The thought smote her like a sword, but she would not harbour the suspicion. His manner to both was so equal ; perhaps his heart was yet free; and if so she would win him in spite of fate. Poor Eva, too, in her own chamber, summed up her day's experience, and hardly dared own the result to herself. She feared she loved Frank, thought he loved her. The tone of his voice, the very touch of his hand seemed softer to her than to anyone else. He had looked love if he had not spoken it; but then was he not away with Rhoda for an hour? Did they not dance together? Might not his manner be as soft and tender to Rhoda ? It was very dreadful to think so ; but then Rhoda was so fascinating, so accomplished, so beautiful. She could not be surprised if he did love her best : and yet she did not think his eyes were false \u2014 but she would watch, and if he did love her cousin best, then she would tear the love from her own heart if it killed her ; and the poor child sobbed herself to sleep after that pleasant pic-nic party. Martin had sat up in confidential chat with Nancy fully"], [118, "106 STUNG TO THE QUICK. an hour after Bella had been despatched to bed with the admonition to \"be up betimes in the morning.\" Bella, having only been with the family six years, was in their eyes comparatively a new servant, for Martin, older by some years than Mr. Marsh, and Nancy but little younger, had been in the service of the elder Mr. Marsh before their present master had left school. Having the honour of the family at heart, Bella, as too young to be discreet (she was five-and-twenty) was generally sent out of the way when anything concerning the family came up for discussion, as on that- night. Men can gossip just as readily as women when they have an opportunity, and whilst the horses were being harnessed to phaetons and whitechapels, preparatory to the return home, one of the postillions belonging to the other party vouchsafed the information that \" Theer had bin a precious row out bye. He didn't ken reetly what t'wur aboot, but t'war summat aboot a lamb as wur peaked oop by th' reever, and the 'Weaf o' th' Wear,' tho' what that meant he deedn't ken.\" \"Now, Nancy,\" said Martin, \"that's just a by-name some wild young chap hez fixed on Miss Rhoda in t' sang, for it meant nobbody but her ; and aw'm sartain aw saw her cooming toward them ruins between maister and t' doctor, with t' same awsome face she hed doon at Leamside.

Aw tell thee she's nut canny;\" decidedly said Martin, neither to be argued nor cajoled out of his convictions; and he went to bed muttering all the way discontentedly. CHAPTER XV. AN UNEXPECTED MORNING CALL. At an early hour the next morning, the sleepers were aroused by a loud and continuous knocking at the street-door. Bella, the earliest riser, had broken up the fire,* carried the bright copper kettle to the pump, suspended it on the pot hook, which dangled from a crane in the chimney, and was busied adjusting kettle and cobs of coal, with a view to give the former all the benefit of the heat with as little smoke as possible, when bang, bang, bang, rat, tat, tat, tat, went the knocker, startling her and causing the kettle to tilt from its equilibrium, and splash the cold water over the white hearth, the shining steel fender and fire-irons. In no pleasant mood the girl hastily settled the refractory kettle, and hurried to the door, wondering all the time she unfastened the lock and bolt who could be there to disturb people at that hour in the morning. By the time the last *In the north, where destructive fires are much less frequent than in the metropolis, household fires are not removed from the grates at night, or extinguished by artificial means, and the kitchen fires especially are \"slacked\" or \"raked,\" that covered up with small coal, which solders and smoulders all night, and only requires stirring up in the morning."], [120, "108 STUNG TO THE QUICK. bolt was unfastened, Martin, in his stocking feet, with his corduroy breeches unbuttoned at the knees, and one arm only thrust into his red worsted-plush waistcoat, was at her elbow, aroused by the unwonted summons. Holding by the door-post, and balancing himself on the step, was Jack Fortescue, in a state of more than semi-intoxication. Bella opened her mouth wide with amazement, and made an angry movement as if she would have shut the door in his face for a drunken vagabond who had no business there, but he dropped his left hand to the knob, and held it open while he stuttered out \u2014 \"Is Mr. M-m-marsh at home? a-wan-a-see-m.\" \" Maister's nut oop, Maister Fortusku, he cannut see you, replied Martin. Wan-a-see Miss-r Mar-sh; wan-a-see Miss-r Ma-arsh.\" \"Didnet ye hear Maister's nut oop? you mun call some ither tyem,\" thrust in Bella, still holding fast the door, lest he should gain admittance. \"Mus see Mis-r Ma-arsh,\" persisted the scapegrace, \"wan t' pol-a-gise, wan t' pol-o-gise; come in an' w-w-wait;\" so saying he pushed himself head-foremost into the hall, to Bella's indignant surprise and Martin's dissatisfaction. To eject him by force the old servant did not feel justified without his master's orders, and no persuasion could induce the inebriated young fellow to depart peaceably until he had seen Mr. Marsh. Gradually he edged himself into the breakfast-room, and reeled to an arm-chair, where he professed himself willing to wait until Mr. Marsh came. Nancy now arrived on the scene. \"What's a' this dirdum* about?\" exclaimed she, \"and who's this? Who let a drunken fellow into a respectable house before the master was out of his bed, I should like to know? What do you want here?\" * Dirdum \u2014 confusion, noise."], [121, "AN UNEXPECTED MORNING CALL. 109 The last was addressed to Mr. Fortescue, who could only repeat his former request, \" Wan-a-see Miss-r Ma-arsh, wan a-pol-o-o-gise.\" \" Hout, hout ! Martin, I think ye'd better ca' the maister up an' tell him 0' the ne'er-do-weel here,\" was the result of Nancy's judgment, when Martin had enlightened her as to the name, characteristics, and wishes of their morning visit ant; who during their brief discussion had fallen into a heavy sleep. Mr. Marsh, aroused by the commotion, was already dressed. but finding the intruder in the arms of Somnus and his own easy chair, and conscious that his forcible ejection would create a noise and disturbance unpleasant to all parties, after his first ejaculatory observation, \"Dear, dear, this is really very unpleasant!\" he desired Martin and Nancy to \"leave him alone ; let him sleep off the fumes of liquor. When he comes to his senses the ill-advised young man may be induced to depart quietly.\" \"That's joost what aw think, maister; it's no manner of good argeying wi' a chap hauf asleep, let alone a chap when he's sou.\" Bella thereupon grumbled at the interruption in her morn ing's work, and muttered audibly enough, \" How's aw te git th' room redd oop for breakfast wi' that greet hulkin' fallow lyin' theer, aw should like to know ? \" \" Easily enough, Bella, if you are so disposed. You may sweep, dust, move furniture, and arrange the breakfast-table without any interruption from the sleeper, who is quite out of your way, and not very likely to awaken just yet. The incon venience is mine, not yours,\" said Mr. Marsh, quietly. The ever-ready whitewash brush having been drawn over the kitchen hearth, ashes and elbow-grease applied vigorously to fender and fire-irons, and, behold, the disordered fireplace was restored to its pristine cheerfulness, without, however, casting a corresponding gleam into the angry face of Bella, who created an unnecessary clatter in repairing the involuntary disaster."], [122, "110 STUNG TO THE QUICK. Thereupon Nancy read the housemaid a lecture on the folly of thinking herself wiser than her betters, and her duty to do as Mr. Marsh ordered without consulting her own whims and fancies; a homily which did not tend to allay Bella's irritation in the least. She was scrupulously neat, clean, and had a pretty good tem per when her work went on smoothly and without interruption, but only then. The cold water, which in splashing the hearth more than sprinkled her stockings, somewhat heated her temper, and the presence of a drunken man in the room she had to prepare for breakfast, with visitors in the house, too, overcame what little philosophy she possessed. The chairs were mahogany, broad-backed, heavy, and well made, or they would certainly have sustained severe dislocation of their joints in the rough usage they received at her hands ; ditto tables, and weighty sofas. Here and there the lighter furniture was whisked to make room for her brush, and not finding it very convenient to sweep under the easy chair with a man in it, the carpet broom made a very impatient onslaught on the sleeper's extended legs, causing a grunt, and an involuntary movement of the offending limbs. Then the handle (of course by accident) came in sharp contact with his head, from which the hat had fallen; then his elbow received a similar salute, and the \"funny-bone\" being touched, the owner thereof wakened to a sort of dreamy consciousness of pain, and of a petticoat fluttering about him at the same time. \" Mary, my de-ar, \" began he, drowsily. Maw nyem's nut Meary, \" answered she, curtly \" Then Sarah, my lo-ove. \" \"An aum nut Sairah \u2014 my nyem's Bella Blacket, an awm nowther 'dear' nor 'luive' o' thine, aw'd have ye knaw.\" \"Then, Bella, my dear, gi-ve me your hand to help me-e up. I dont know whe-re I\u2014 I \u2014 I am. Th-th-thank you, my love. Now give me-e-e a ki-iss, m-my dear. \" Thinking to get him out of the house she had extended her hand to help him to rise, but once on his unsteady feet he"], [123, "AN UNEXPECTED MORNING CALL. 111 retained her hand in his grip, passing his other arm round her waist to draw her towards him. Down went the broom from her hand, upsetting a tripod fire-screen in its descent, which in turn invaded the sanctuary of the brass-topped fender; and overturned shovel, tongs, and poker with a rattle, just as the palm of Bella's hand saluted her new admirer's cheek much more warmly than he bargained for. \" Tak' that, an' learn to keep yor distance fra a decent lass. Awm none o' yor sort, aw'd have ye knaw, \" cried she, in an indignant tone, which rose above the clash of falling irons, and contributed not a little to expedite the arrival of the whole household on the spot, guests and all. The loud and prolonged fantasia Mr. Fortescue had executed on the door knocker had awakened every sleeper in the house, as well as the neighbours on each side; and, once awake, the bustle and commotion which ensued convinced everybody that something more was afoot than the mere routine of orderly domestic operations. Curiosity contended with fatigue, and, as may be supposed, obtained the mastery ; and in proportion to the degree of curiosity was the speed exhibited in dressing; con sequently Mr. Fortescue and Bella were surrounded by a number of wondering and inquiring faces, and \"What's the matter?\" sounded like a concerted chorus. Mr. Marsh's desire had been to avoid anything of the kind, and to get his unwelcome visitor away quietly after a sobering sleep; but Bella's impatient temper had defeated his plan, and his only chance now was to make the best of it, and turn the fellow out before he had time to annoy his niece. Jack Fortescue was known, not only to the frequenters of every tavern within the city of Durham, but half over the county besides. Coursing, hunting, boxing, boating, racing, every field sport save angling\u2014 that was too sober \u2014 brought him in contact with country gentlemen far and wide, whilst those who had no sympathy with such pursuits met him, from time to time, at the inns where they put up their horses when fairs, markets, or hirings brought them into the city."], [124, "112 STUNG TO THE QUICK. So more than one of Mr. Marsh's male guests stepped forward with the exclamation, \" Why, Jack, what are you doing here ? \" and Jack, winking and blinking, and looking round with a strong effort to recall his wandering memory, blundered out, \"Doing here \u2014 here \u2014 doi \u2014 oh, mem-ber now \u2014 came to \u2014 came to 'pologise. \" \" Apologise ! \" was echoed in various tones from many lips. \"You had better go home now, Mr. Fortescue. I cannot attend to you at present. You are not in a condition to know what you are saying, \" urged Mr. Marsh, with a hand on the young man's arm, gently endeavouring to lead him away. But he was shaken off with, \"Don't touch me, I'm a gen-1-man \u2014 come to 'pologise to young lady \u2014 didn't know she was Wa-aif \u2014 Waif of Wear \u2014 didn't know, couldn't 'suit a lady, am gen-1-man.\" \"You are no gentleman, or you would leave the house when desired \u2014 you are a vagabond,\" exclaimed Mr. Marsh, exasperated beyond measure at his pertinacity and insulting allusion to Rhoda. \" Am gen-1-man\" (with an assumption of dignity), \"wrote song 'bout Waif of Wear, did wrong \u2014 didn't know \u2014 came as gen-1-man to 'pologise.\" With some difficulty the misguided young man was got out of the house, Mr. Applegarth and Mr. Teesdale volun teering to convey him in safety to his chambers. Rhoda, with that stony look on her face which Martin so much dreaded, stole quietly from the amazed group to her own room, bolted the door, and battled with the demon in her breast which fought for open utterance, and urged her to shake off the bonds of that dependence which was power less to protect her from insult. \" But where could I go ? whither could I flee ? I have no friends, no money, no occupation. Occupation \u2014 faugh ! I hate work ! / do not mean to work to soil my fingers for a liveli hood.

I must rise above fate, not fall beneath it. I must remain, and brave it out, and the time may come, nay, shall come, when I will repay with interest the wrongs the world has done my mother and my self. Why was that drunken idiot suffered to enter the house and insult me a second time ? Am I to be pointed at, and sneered at, as the ' Waif of the Wear ' wherever I turn ? The bare thought of the epithet is torturing. Thank Heaven Frank Raeburn has not heard it ! Will it be possible to keep it from him ? What if he already knows ! Ah ! the agony of that sugges tion \u2014 what does it not portend ? Would he stoop to marry the child of a beggarwoman ? Well, if King Cophetua could marry a beggar even in her rags, may not he be noble enough to set prejudice aside? But the stigma cast on my name, how can I remove that ? The 'Waif of the Wear ' ! Oh ! how that woman's petty malice stings me ! Ah! if I had Mrs. Hesketh's throat within my reach, I could strangle her without pity.\" She set her teeth and clenched her hands as if she had an enemy already in her vindictive grip. Then they sank to her side, and she gasped \u2014 \" What shall I do? How meet the prying eyes downstairs \u2014 eyes that would pierce my heart if it were possible \u2014 eyes that may, perhaps, pity me ? No, they shall not pity me ; I am too proud for that.

I will have no such reminders of my misfortune, not I \u2014 let them keep their pity for the whining idiots who seek it ? If the fox does gnaw to my very heart, I can only draw my Spartan mantle closer to conceal its ravages. I will blunt the Hesketh arrows on an impenetrable shield. I will show\" A light tap at the door, and Eva's gentle voice saying, \" Rhoda, Rhoda, breakfast waits, \" not only arrested this pas sionate strife in her breast, and the quick, irregular step that had paced the chamber floor, but sent her to a dressing-glass to 1"], [126, "114 STUNG TO THE QUICK. smooth the tell-tale face, and the hair disordered by spasmodic clutching of impatient hands. The tap was repeated just as, brush in hand, Rhoda with drew the bolt, and admitting Eva, returned to the glass to twirl a long ringlet over her finger, and adjust her side-combs, the better to hide the traces of recent emotion. \" Come, cousin, breakfast is waiting for you. What a while you have been dressing. But I thought I saw you downstairs dressed a long time ago,\" said Eva, as if a little puzzled. \" Ah, I dare say. I did just run down to ascertain what the uproar was about, but not having any morbid curiosity concerning the freaks of intoxicated men, returned to com plete my toilette,\" replied she, with a supercilious curl of her upper lip, and the very faintest sign of a shrug. \" Intoxication, Rhoda, \u2014 why he was quite tipsy ! I wonder whatever he came here for ?\" \"Do you not know?\" questioned Rhoda. \" No; do you? I asked papa, and he only told me not to be curious about what did not concern me, but to go and see what chance there was of breakfast. Wasn't he cross? I was very nearly telling him so. But do make haste, Rhoda; don't keep breakfast waiting, for Nancy and Bella and papa do look so unaccountably out of sorts this morning. And what do you think ?\" continued she, as they were leaving the room together. \" Mr. Applegarth and William Teesdale took the tipsy young fellow home, and they said that his clothes were wringing wet. He was at Finchale yesterday with Mrs. Hesketh's party, and there was a quarrel, and instead of com ing home with the rest, he and one or two more got into a boat to row up the river. Two of them were quite sober, but this Mr. Fortescue and another were tipsy when they started, and kept drinking brandy as they went along, and at last upset the boat about a mile from Durham ! Isn't it a mercy they were not all drowned?\" \" I wish he had been drowned instead of coming here,\" muttered Rhoda between her teeth as they crossed the hall."], [127, "AN UNEXPECTED MORNING CALL. 115 \" What's that you said ? \" asked Eva, who had caught the low but vehement wish. \" Oh, Rhoda, I'm sure you cannot mean that.\" A low light laugh, in which there was a touch of sarcasm, was Rhoda's only answer as she swept into the room. A quick glance of defiance shot from her black eyes at the friends within, grouped into little knots for close con versation. It faded instantaneously as she tendered a very gracious apology for her late appearance, and assuming her seat, proceeded to dispense coffee, chocolate, and winning smiles, ignoring by her manner all knowledge of Mr. For tescue's intrusion. She was, however, quick to note the sudden lull in the conversation on her entrance, and the affectation, here and there, of engrossing interest in most irrelevant matters, bung ling attempts at disguise too shallow to deceive the acutely susceptible Rhoda, who read in those kindly but clumsy efforts to spare her feelings the innate consciousness of a something current likely to wound them. Shortly after breakfast Mr. Middleton's phaeton was brought to the door. This was followed by the Teesdales' whitechapel and a capacious hooded gig of antiquated mould, owned by the Misses Applegarth and their bachelor brother. Then ensued a cross fire of hospitable invitations; a hurried rushing to and fro of excited young ladies who had forgotten scarf, or reticule, parasol, or parcel; a bewildering confusion of kissings and good-byes, in the midst of which the animated party dispersed; and, as Rhoda truly fore boded, her story dispersed with them like thistle-down, to crop up far and near, wheresoever her name was known. In the midst of these bustling departures, Cuthbert and Edwin Grove made their appearance: the former, to take a last look of his fair enslaver, and bid a hasty farewell before he sailed; the latter, to inquire after the health of the cousins, prompted by an unusually active spirit of politeness. Cuthbert scowled upon Mr. Edwin, and Edwin elevated his"], [128, "116 STUNG TO THE QUICK. eyelids at Cuthbert, who found himself baffled in his design to have a brief interview with Rhoda. Trains wait for no man any more than time and tide, and Cuthbert dallied and dallied in hope to outstay his imagin ary rival, until the Cathedral clock warned him he had no leisure for a walk to Leamside, and not much to spare for a drive. Martin was, however, at hand; a horse was quickly put to a light gig seldom used, and he drove the young sailor on- his way \u2014 not, however, before Rhoda had bestowed upon him a parting word or two unheard by others, a glance, and a tender pressure of the white fingers on his horny palm, which sent a thrill of delight through his whole frame; speedily dissipated by Eva's last words, as he stepped glow ing into the gig. \"Mind and make it up with Mary before you sail, Mr. Cuthbert, or never look me into the face again ! \" Sailors are proverbially disinclined to land-carriage, and Cuthbert took advantage of the fact to vent the ill-humour let out by that prick at his conscience, by swearing at the roads, whether rough or smooth, over hill or through valley, and the smart pace of the horse, which made the journey none of the gentlest. But the velvet touch of Rhoda's taper fingers lingered longer than the admonition of Eva, and smoothed down his ruffled temper long before they sighted the low station house. Then he began to congratulate Martin on being such a lucky old fellow as to serve so fair a mistress. \"Heigh! So aw be, captin; Miss Eva's like a breeht angel flitting aboot th' hoose, wi' a smile an' a blessed word for ivverybody, high an' low,\" assented Martin, very cheer fully. This was not exactly what Cuthbert expected; another mistress had occupied his imagination; but, reminded thus opportunely that Eva, whom he had for the instant lost"], [129, "AN UNEXPECTED MORNING CALL. 117 sight of, was actual mistress in her father's household, he steered on a different tack. \" Ay, ay, Martin, so she is, and always was, even as a child; but I think she always will be a child \u2014 quite a differ ent craft to her cousin. Now, there's another fine lass you may well be proud to wait on; clean built, tight rigged, with a figure-head like \" Cuthbert's eloquence failed him, but Martin dropped in a word which, in its very aptness, brought him down from the mast-head to the deck at once. \" Like a gipsy, more ner anything else. But Miss Eva's none sic a child, though she be sae little; she hev as guid sense as t'other, an' far mair canny, begging yer pardon, captin,\" continued he, warming at what he construed into a slight towards his favourite. \" Hold hard, messmate ; don't run foul of a man that way. I meant no disrespect to Miss Marsh, \u2014 bless her blue eyes; but Miss Wearbank has eyes like stars, and a pilot might steer by them. Mr. Marsh is lucky in having such a companion for his daughter.\" \" Ay, so awr Nance threaps yan doon. But aw dinnut ken, folks maun differ, aw reckon,\" muttered Martin in half soliloquy. \" And don't you think so, Martin ? Your master does, I know,\" partly asked and partly asserted the seaman, at a loss to know what objection he could have to the peerless Rhoda. \" Hout, maister ! \" exclaimed the old man, in astonishment ; \" Maister thinks as much o' t' baim es if she were his ain ; he sees nae wrang in her.\" \" And what do your old eyes see wrong which Nancy and your master don't?\" persisted Cuthbert. \"Aw dunno; aw dunnut like them greet black eyen, that luik you through, an' aw do think an' say she's nut canny.\" Cuthbert laughed outright. He had not thought it possible any human being could resist the magic of those lustrous eyes ; and here was an old man of seventy who actually held"], [130, "118 STUNG TO THE QUICK. the lady \" uncanny\" on account of their hue and brightness. \" Ye needn't laugh, captin ; aw've lived langer an' seen mair breeht eyen than yo han, an aw do say, an aw must say, yon lass is nut canny, yo may tak auld Martin's word for't. But here we are and yon's the fizzin' o' the ingine ; yo'r nobbut i' tyem.\" Screeching, panting, puffing, up came the train; a fiery serpent, gliding along, disgorging and gorging again quicker than ever did dragon of ancient fable, and off it rolled again, fizzing, and puffing, and steaming, bearing Cuthbert off in its coils with the word \" uncanny\" ringing in his ears louder and clearer than the screeching or whistling of any railway serpent that ever shrieked a warning to a witless suicide. CHAPTER XVI. DESERTS AND DESERTERS. No cockney sportsman whose gun has exploded and shattered a finger, in consequence of an overcharge of the combustible black powder, so inoffensive in flask or cool cellar, could be more amazed or mortified than Mrs. Coulson and her coadjutors at the result of her carefully-concocted scheme for the annoyance of a \" cruel husband \" and a \"haughty young miss.\" True, they had gloried, as little minds can, in the petty gratification of preoccupying a room, displaying finery, and mustering adherents in the faces of imaginary competitors. True, they had succeeded in rousing Mr. Hesketh's ire, and stinging Rhoda to the quick; but, in the inevitable scene which followed, and on which Mrs. Hesketh and her prompter relied as the culminating point of their triumph, they had shown only to a disadvantage; nay, been defeated on their own ground, and experienced the defection of their chief warrior."], [131, "DESERTS AND DESERTERS. 119 In other words, Jack Fortescue, who had written a comic song \"to order,\" fully believing the story of the \"lamb\" in its integrity, was so thoroughly annoyed and disgusted at being made the dupe and the tool of two vulgar-minded women, and set in the dark to work their malicious ends \u2014 was at once so irritated and self-abased at the mean and con temptible part he had been made to play, that he turned round upon them, and with the utmost contempt demanded how they dared to make him the instrument to insult a lady, \u2014 a young lady, too, whose peculiar position should have secured her from caricature. What did they know of him so low and base as to imagine him capable of twitting a young girl with what was her misfortune ? He had forfeited his claim to be a gentleman, had behaved like a scoundrel. He would, how ever, make what reparation was in his power; he would apologise and explain. He was a gentleman, and would not be mixed up with blackguardism. Much more he said to the same purpose, drinking, as he stood, glass after glass of wine in his excitement, scarcely conscious of what he did. No disclaimers of Mrs. Hesketh or Mrs. Coulson could satisfy the irritated young gentleman that they had outlined the insulting song with a pure motive ; and as right generally obtains more open adherents than wrong, the two soon found themselves in a minority in a very* pertinacious and undig nified dispute. The party was split up into factions, and all the pleasure was at an end. Then Mr. Fortescue insisted on returning by water, and, accompanied by his foppish friend, bent his steps towards a small skiff kept for the accommodation of visitors. He was not in a condition to take charge of the boat, nor was his companion, so two others, dreading some disaster, volunteered to follow and accompany them \u2014 as much, be it said, from disgust at the whole proceedings and sympathy with the reckless young fellow, as from a sincere desire to prevent him running himself or Mr. Lighthead into danger."], [132, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 120 There was wholesale defection ! Four of their knights gone in a body, and the remainder in a state of insubordination ! Some few, however, whose sense of honour and propriety was not too clearly defined, were sorry for Mrs. Hesketh, and endeavoured to console her under the fire of Mr. For tescue's reproofs. But nothing could restore harmony to the ill-assorted party. Mrs. Coulson, fat and jolly, bustled about to provide tea, and Mrs. Hesketh, chafing with spleen and mortification, called upon Lucy to assist ; but she sat in the window where Edwin Grove had left her, biting her finger-nails and tormenting herself with possibilities regarding Rhoda and her own deceit ful, inconstant lover, and came foward sulkily and reluctantly. Pleasure having taken wing, there was little inducement for discontented people to remain, and the desertion of four cavaliers had left double that number of disconsolate damsels to look and speak their dissatisfaction. Of course all blame fell on the shoulders of Mrs. Hesketh and Mrs. Coulson, and made their situation so far from enviable, that they rejoiced equally when the day came to a close, and the party dispersed, with few leave-takings, to right or left as they passed through Durham; the latter, a capital whip, heading a division into Gilesgate, whilst Lucy and her mother, within a hired chaise, in solitary state were driven to their cheerless house in New Elvet. I say cheerless advisedly ; for although Mrs. Hesketh had sold, or condemned to inferior uses, the old furniture of best parlours and bedrooms, substituting rosewood and damask for mahogany and moreen; though frames of pictures and chimney-glass had been re-gilt; though lustres sparkled on the chimney-piece of white marble, which had itself ousted a wooden predecessor rich with carved wreaths and quaint medallions, but \" hideously old-fashioned, my dear ; \" though beads or Berlin wool, worked into screens, mats, cushions, and ottomans, represented all the hues of the rainbow; though vases and glittering nick-nacks lay here and there;"], [133, "DESERTS AND DESERTERS. 121 though the cold grate was hid beneath a screen of paper feathers; though the slant rays of the setting sun glinting through the windows lit up each prism of the lustres, and made jack-o'-lanterns on wall and ceiling; though everything was bright and shiny, the whole was cold and cheerless. It was a room for show more than use. The very lustres might have been icicles left behind by winter, and which even that August sun had failed to thaw. No speck, no shred of linen, no end of thread, lay on the carpet ; no open book, no thimble, no stray reel or scissors on the polished table gave token of occupancy. The piano was closed, music books out of sight ; no work basket couched in a dark corner, no desk, with key in lock, suggested the presence of fingers to ply the needle or the pen. It was a room to look at, not to live in; and its fellows were like unto it, prim and cold, if less grand and glittering. There visitors were received in ceremonious state, but not entertained; and one great source of dissension between Mr. and Mrs. Hesketh had been his desire to convert to home or hospitable use the frigid rooms she kept for mere show. But the cheerlessness arose from something apart from unused furniture. It has always seemed to me as if a house reflected its inmates, and accordingly as they were genial, or unsocial, or contentious, or sordid, such would be the aspect of the abode; and so this house perked itself up with an assumption of grandeur, only to be maintained by a sacrifice of home comfort and genuine hospitality. Mirth and laughter were out of the question there. Mrs. Coulson, and a select few, occasionally had tea with Mrs. Hesketh, but the tray never travelled beyond the back parlour, nor the conversation beyond the limits of conven tional gossip, and if a joke was cracked, ten to one but a reputation was cracked with it. A girl of Lucy's age and temper should have put warmth into a dull house; but she did not. Girls of warm and kindly"], [134, "122 STUNG TO THE QUICK. dispositions could not assimilate with her. Girls of correspond ing temperament and manner disputed with her for rule and mastery, or battled about each other's private affairs, until the hastily formed acquaintanceships broke suddenly from their very want of cohesion; and so the maiden grew up, unlovely (though good-looking enough), unloving, and unloved. Rude and turbulent she had been as a child; when the mis taken mother, instead of curbing or correcting, applauded her spirit, and permitted her to ride rough-shod over, first her brother, then her playmates (when they would submit), then the servants, and next her father. Not one of these but rebelled. Cuthbert was sent to sea, playmates forsook her, servants refused to remain beyond their terms, the father threatened to thrash her, and ended by remov ing his office from the house. Then the mother found that she had fostered a spirit of rebellion even against herself. It was no longer a tiny foot that stamped, a little hand that clenched, a baby lip that pouted, or an infant's treble that shrieked \" I will ! \" It was a fast and saucy girl, who took boldly that which had been given freely, and then demanded more. In vain Mrs. Hesketh tried to repress the spirit she had formerly fostered. In vain she attempted to retain her house hold sceptre. Lucy disputed her sway, acknowledged no will but her own, and derided all counsel. Only in one thing were mother and daughter unanimous, and that was in presenting a fair face to their narrow world. However much they might contend in private, some secret instinct bade them present an amiable front to strangers. Now and again a sharp glance or a hot word would betray the smouldering fires, but self-interest enabled them as a rule to keep up appearances, and superficial observers wondered how Mr. Hesketh could neglect his agreeable wife and daughter so very much. Servants, however, told a different story when they met their friends at the mangle, the shop counter, or the hirings, and"], [135, "DESERTS AND DESERTERS. 123 so rumour gradually set afloat a something not very far removed from the truth; but, of course, that was \"rank slander,\" and Mrs. Hesketh was virtuously shocked at the first intimation of it. Someway or other Edwin Grove had been entrapped by the pretty face of Lucy Hesketh before he had well emerged from his medical pupilage; they had wandered together by the banks of the river, or under the shadow of the woods, where the New North Road now spreads a path, or along to the strawberry gardens of New Durham, whilst his father believed him compounding drugs in the surgery, or studying anatomy in his own room. She made no secret of these rambles, although she never named them at home until questioned, not thinking it neces sary to consult any but her own will on the subject, and when taken to task assumed a right to please herself, not warranted by her age or experience. However, as Edwin Grove was esteemed a \"good catch,\" she was permitted to have her own way unopposed, and gradually the walks began or ended in Old Elvet. Dr. Grove, having a practice too extensive both in area and number to permit any loitering for garrulity, either on his own part or that of his patients, was the last to hear of his son's tenderness for Miss Hesketh ; and when he did, wisely held his peace, in the belief that it would be folly to whip a top he wished to subside to repose. Nevertheless, Edwin was shortly despatched to London, to walk the hospitals and take his degree, no suspicion of ulterior motive transpiring. Mrs. Hesketh grumbled at the heavy postage ; but for all that, letters so folded as to baffle prying eyes, and at the same time secure the widest space for correspondence, closely written to the very margin of the vermilion seal \u2014 letters which cost fourteen pence, and were not worth half the money \u2014 used to pass between Lucy and Edwin once a-week or fortnight, and the two considered themselves deeply in love and for mally engaged."], [136, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 124 Apothecaries' Hall was passed, and Edwin Grove had come home for the vacation the very night before the pic-nic, but at too late an hour to desert his father and visit his inamorata. Besides, if the truth may be told, the fervour of his love had cooled down a little during his probation in the great city, and his ideas of woman in the abstract had taken a very much wider range. His idea was no longer a vision of blue eyes and tawny hair, an elliptical nose, or a skin of fair red and white. Some glimmering perception that mind and soul gave per manence to beauty had dawned upon him in his walks through street or hospital, and it somehow happened that his letters grew insensibly shorter and farther apart. He was not conscious of any change in himself, yet when his father carried him off to Finchale, Edwin raised no dis senting voice, and excused himself from rushing to see Lucy at once, on the ground that one day would not make much difference, and she need not know how that one day was spent. Just in the frame of mind to be fascinated with Rhoda, and acknowledge her superior charms, Edwin Grove was in exact proportion to his own disloyalty prepared to resent the slightest show of corresponding wavering on the part of Lucy; whilst she, believing him hundreds of miles away, suddenly opening her eyes to see him bend over another, and that one Rhoda, to hear his whispered compliments, and watch his lingering glances, may not be supposed in the best frame of mind to be taken to task for a less licence than he had accorded himself. In that half hour spent at the open window, she gathered up a store of jealous resentment with which she met his first rude guery as to her business there ; and so it was, the two met in anger who had anticipated meeting in love and happiness. However amiable a woman may be, she will not tamely look on whilst her avowed lover pays very marked attention to an other before her face, more especially when an air of deception is prominent; so that fiery Lucy may be excused meeting an ungracious question with a very sharp retort. Still, a calmer"], [137, "A BATTLE FOR DOMINION. 125 reply, even a similar question put to himself as a lady might speak, would have brought him back (for in heart he had never strayed), but her rude and rebellious spirit spoke its own rude language, and when he left the room he went away shocked and confounded. CHAPTER XVII. A BATTLE FOR DOMINION. The pic-nic which was planned to disturb and annoy others, which was to have witnessed so clear a triumph, had brought only defeat, pain, and punishment to its projectors. Each felt the mortification, although no one acknowledged the punishment ; no one, feeling the whirlwind, acknowledged to have sown the wind ; but each and all blamed some person or some circumstance apart from self. Rage, jealousy, and slighted love made Lucy furious with passion, and once at home a torrent of invectives poured from her lips. She reproached her mother for the whole scheme, ignoring the part she had herself taken in it, whilst her mother retaliated with a charge of ingratitude and want of feeling. Then the two united in declaring Mr. Hesketh the sole cause of the day's mishaps, and sat down together in their gloomy back parlour, with sharp eager faces, impatient to tell him what they thought of him when he came home. And there they sat, Lucy biting her nails to the quick, and Mrs. Hesketh pattering an impatient foot on the floor; but the hours went by, midnight came and passed, before the pleasant party at Mr. Marsh's breaking up, Mr. Hesketh and Cuthbert strolled home arm in arm, and lit the dull room with their cheerful countenances. As usual, the bottled-up wrath was poured forth, but not as usual did Mr. Hesketh meet it. There was no spluttering"], [138, "126 STUNG TO THE QUICK. passion, no vehement gesticulation ; he waited until Lucy and her mother had exhausted their eloquence, then decidedly, but with a calmness more impressive from its very rarity, addressed himself to his wife, taking no notice whatever of Lucy. \" Mrs. Hesketh, you have this day convinced me you are unfit to be either wife or mother. \" \"Indeed! and pray for what may you befit?\" interposed she, with a curl of her nose ; but he continued as though she had never spoken. \" You have outraged decency, violated every bond of woman hood, wantonly conspired to attach odium to the name of a most excellent young lady, and thrown ridicule on an act ot charity which reflects only honour on a benevolent man. \" \" Oh ! of course your friends are all angels ! That is under stood,\" was the sneering interruption of his wife. \" Excellent indeed ! She is nothing better than an upstart and a flirt!\" exclaimed Lucy. Mr. Hesketh, heedless of the rude observations and com mentaries which followed the progress of his speech, continued slowly and deliberately, without stop or wavering, without elevating his voice above the level of grave decision : \" Neither of the persons so insulted ever injured you by word or deed, the outrage was therefore unprovoked and unjustifiable, and I, being compromised by the act of those who bear my name, have resolved to prevent such a scandal in the future.\" \" You have resolved, indeed!\u2014 you have resolved! Well, I like that!\" \" So long as your petty malice expended itself in attempts to annoy me, and destroy domestic comfort, I contented my self with retiring from uncongenial society, and permitted you to retain, undisputed, the position at the head of my household, which I had been foolish enough to give you.\" \" Permitted, indeed ! you are improving, I declare ! \" \"I have allowed you to control and direct this household hitherto; have long resigned the house to yourself and your"], [139, "A BATTLE FOR DOMINION. 127 acquaintances, not caring to see my own friends slighted or insulted; have permitted you to regulate the expenses, and paid your lavish bills more readily than you deserved. But your dominion ceases with this day. You have no longer a ductile, pliant husband to deal with, but a master whose authority must alone bear sway.\" \"Dear me! can that be Mr. Hesketh, or the Great Mogul masquerading in his garments ? I declare, Lucy, he harangues us as if he really were master of the house and we his humble slaves.\" \" He who is master of the purse is master also of the house, if he be master of himself.\" \"Ah! indeed, if. If, Mr. Hesketh; but you are not master of my purse, and not very often master of yourself. A con temptuous laugh of exultation followed this remark, echoed by tittering Lucy. \"You can keep your own private income for pocket money, Maria; you will no doubt require it before long. I am at least a master of arithmetic, and counsel economy.\" \" Counsel economy, indeed ! I shall do what I please with my own,\" retorted she, provoked by his quietness and the turn matters were taking. \"With your own, but not with mine. Henceforth I pay for nothing I do not myself order, permit no visitors I do not invite or approve ; and as you are incapable of controlling your domestics, or entertaining my friends pleasantly, I shall place the household under other management.\" Here was an announcement which took Mrs. Hesketh by surprise, the more so that the quiet determination in his manner produced the effect of conviction. Choking with suppressed rage at the idea of his bringing a stranger home to domineer over her, she rose to her feet with a torrent of abuse on her lips, but before she could utter more than a few unintelligible words about \"tyranny\" and \" parsimony, \" she sank into her chair in a violent fit of hysterics."], [140, "128 STUNG TO THE QUICK. Time had been that Mr. Hesketh would have reproached himself as the cause of such emotional display, and exhausted every art to restore her; but he simply bade Lucy attend to her mother, and, if she did not revive presently, throw a bowl of cold water over her; then, without more ado, coolly lit a chamber candle and retired to bed. Cuthbert, as previously arranged, had gone upstairs at once to avoid being drawn into any dispute, and to his room Mr. Hesketh went \u2014 not to his own, so that the hysterical lady when she came to herself might reflect in solitude on all he had said. And the hysterics over, she did reflect, and, in spite of her anger and exasperation, arrived at the conclusion that Mr. Hesketh was in earnest, more in earnest than she had ever seen him, and so she told Lucy. Lucy, however, had small care for her mother's trouble; she was wrapped up in self, and perplexed how to regain her ascendency over Edwin Grove, without stooping to own herself in the wrong. That she was determined she never would do ; for she argued he had no right to blame her for being at a pic-nic with gentlemen unknown to him, whilst he was at another, paying attentions to a handsome woman unknown to her. Much as she might affect to depreciate Rhoda, there lurked in her little mind a sort of consciousness that she would be a dangerous and powerful rival, and as all the love she could spare from herself had been given to Edwin Grove, she was not too comfortable in the reflection that her own hasty and inconsiderate retort had given him a sort of pre text for inconstancy. At her father's threats she laughed, having no belief in his strength of purpose, and moreover they were not levelled against herself; but there was something in Edwin's conduct to warrant her jealous fears. Had he not come home from London without even writing to inform her? Surely, if he loved her as he used to say, he would have rushed to see her before he had"], [141, "A BATTLE FOR DOMINION. 129 been an hour in Durham, instead of which he had gone off flirting with that beggarwoman's bairn. How long had he been home she wondered. Surely not very long. He could not be so cruel as to treat her ill deliberately. But she would find it out, and if he were inclined to flirt she would flirt too. She would let him see there were beaus to be had in Durham without him. Mr. Lighthead had been very particular in his attentions, and she would just let the fickle young gentleman see that she could have two strings to her bow as well as himself. He would be coming in the morning to make an excuse and ask her forgiveness, and wouldn't she plague him then ? She would give him a lesson he should not forget. The morning came, as mornings generally do, whether we are prepared for them or not, whether we open our eyes to the daylight of this world or another, and found the two ladies both sleepy and sulky. They would not go down to breakfast; it would mortify the tyrant if they did not appear to say good-bye to Cuthbert before he started ; and serve him right for his airs! Much to their surprise, when they did condescend to walk downstairs, they discovered they had neither been inquired for nor waited for, and that father and son had departed in excel lent spirits. Moreover, the servant had received her orders for dinner without any reference to the wishes of her mistress, expressed or understood ; and whilst Mrs. Hesketh yet stood aghast at this audacious innovation, the blue-bloused butcher's boy handed in a joint hitherto excluded from their table, for the sole reason that Mr. H esketh had a preference for it. Utterly confounded by a display of decision such as she had witnessed but once before in the course of her married life, namely, on the occasion of the office transfer, Mrs. Hesketh sat appalled, leaving her toast to toughen and her coffee to cool, whilst she marvelled what further act of insubordination she might expect from her hitherto submissive husband. It is all very well for a wife by dint of caprice and ill temper to rule her husband and home, and believe her position K"], [142, "130 STUNG TO THE QUICK. impregnable, so long as the man is willing to submit to con trol, from that indolent love of ease which disinclines him to take the field against a woman armed with a stinging tongue; but once let him rouse from his apathy, and she must succumb to the strong hand in the end, however long and fierce may be the battle for dominion. She may not \" honour \", she may object to \" obey, \" and sacrifice the happi ness of herself and family in perverse abnegation of her marriage vow, rearing her children in the most pernicious moral atmosphere; but this can only extend to minor mat ters: in all the great issues of life, might and right com bine to make the man pre-eminent. Gradually temper overcame surprise, and whilst Lucy sipped her coffee, trifled with her toast, and battered an empty egg shell to shivers, regardless of the silver spoon, in her mental abstraction, Mrs. Hesketh pattered her foot on the carpet and muttered to herself, far too angry to eat. With Lucy in her train, Mrs. Hesketh sought her unfailing friend, Mrs. Coulson; the former leaving a message with Betty, \" Should Mr. Grove call, say I am out, and shall not be at home all the morning; but if Mr. Lighthead or Mr. Fortescue inquire for either mamma or myself, remember we are gone to Mrs. Coulson's. \" Lucy had arrayed herself in her most becoming bonnet, newest de-laine dress, and black mode scarf, twirling in her hand a large brown parasol with a border of green birds and bushes, the gift of her truant swain, in expectation that somewhere between Old Elvet and Gilesgate she might have an opportunity of dazzling the eyes of either the beau who had been, or the beaus who might be. She stepped along with a set smile, by the side of her frowning mother, defiant alike in dress and demeanour; but as she crossed Framwellgate Bridge, traversed Saddler Street, emerged into the Market Place, and finally reached Gilesgate without a glimpse of any errant knight, the smile disappeared, and by the time Mrs. Hesketh's green kid had touched the brass"], [143, "A BATTLE FOR DOMINION. 131 knocker on Mrs. Coulson's door, there was a frown on Lucy's brow quite as deep as that on her mother's. Mrs. Coulson was not alone. She had held a sort of levee that morning, and two or three confidential friends were closeted with her then, each and all discussing some phase or other of the previous day's disaster. Some had come to impart information, others to inquire the \" rights \" of the case, \" certain to hear the truth from their dear friend, Mrs. Coulson, \" and she, conscious of her own importance as a circulating medium, kept the ball rolling with a con descending affability very delightful to behold. Amongst the various rumours afloat, it was currently reported that Mr. Hesketh, in a state of intoxication and temper, had intruded on a party of strangers, violently assaulted Mr. Fortescue, torn his wife's bonnet to shreds, and all about a comic song. That Captain Hesketh, quite as violent as his father, had pitched Mr. Lighthead through the window, and given some one else a black eye. That Edwin Grove had deserted Miss Hesketh and told her she was not fit to wipe Miss Wearbank's shoes. That he had sent Mr. Fortescue a challenge on account of a song he had made on Miss Wearbank. That Jack Fortescue and three others had been in the river, and two were drowned. That the said Jack Fortescue had gone to Mr. Marsh's dripping wet; that he had gone on his knees to implore pardon, and been kicked out of the house by Mr. Marsh, who had threatened to shoot him. All these veracious statements found their way to Mrs. Coulson's, albeit some of them had their origin elsewhere, and, in justice to that jolly widow, it is only fair to say that she endeavoured to correct such reports as her own personal knowledge enabled her to rectify, making due allowance for her own distorted view of the question. But as she took for granted all she heard of events beyond her ken, and repeated the same to each comer, the double pic-nic and final outbreak filled all the busy tongues and idle ears of Durham before the day was over."], [144, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 132 It so happened, however, that no one was drowned, no boat had been upset, and only one person had been in the river, that one being Jack Fortescue, whom his more sober comrades had dragged out of the water, without more incon venience to themselves than a partial wetting. But the foolish fellow himself did not escape scot free; as related, he wan dered to Mr. Marsh's, slumbered there, and afterwards, when conducted to his chambers, again dropped asleep in his satur ated garments, which dried upon him ; waked at length, cold, stiff, and shivery, by night-fall was in a blazing fever, and in less than three weeks went home to his old father in a leaden coffin. But of this catastrophe Mrs. Hesketh had no prescience. She sought Mrs. Coulson's sympathy in the full belief that she was grievously ill-used ; that the measures she had adopted to annoy her husband and his exclusive friends were perfectly justifiable, and consequently her indignant spouse's retaliation was most outrageous. When the ordinary gossips had departed with their bud gets full, Mrs. Hesketh poured out the story of her wrongs, every few moments calling upon Lucy to corroborate her statements, as if she thought her own unsupported testimony unworthy credence. \"My dear Mrs. Coulson, what should I do?\" said she, in most lachrymose tones, when she had ended her story. \" What would you do in my case ? \" \" Well, my dear,\" replied the counsellor, pursing up her mouth in grave deliberation, \" it is not easy to advise. You know poor dear Coulson never gave me a wrong word in his life; but then, you see, I had the length of his foot, and just got my own way without his knowing it.\" \" I wish I could say as much ; not but what I have had pretty much my own way, but I have had to fight for it. Hesketh used to smoke in the parlours, carry his plans and papers into the drawing-room, walk in without wiping his shoes, grumble when we had a cold dinner, and examine the"], [145, "A BATTLE FOR DOMINION. 133 tradesmen's bills with the meanness of a miser. I managed to scold or sneer him out of all these habits, and just as I thought I had him under my finger and thumb, he turns round in this way. I declare it would provoke a saint !\" \" So it would, honey ; but the men are all alike, nothing to be depended on ; and if you would take my advice, not that I would presume to dictate to you, my dear, but if you are wise, you will take no notice of his threats. Men often threaten over-night and forget all about it in the morning ; and if I know anything of your husband, honey, and I think I do, he is too easy and good-natured to persist in his course long, if there is nothing to be gained by it. He will tire of the trouble of marketing and ordering before many days are over, I'll warrant. That does not come natural to a man like Mr. Hesketh, and in less than a week he will be all right again. But mind, honey, you must not let him do as he likes without any opposition, or \" \"I should think not!\" ejaculated Mrs. Hesketh and Lucy in a breath. \"Or you will never be able to manage him again,\" con tinued Mrs. Coulson. \"Now, suppose instead of going home to dine on the joint he has provided without consulting you, you take off your bonnets and have a bit of dinner with me. He'll not relish dining by himself, I can tell you; and if he complain, repeat the experiment, and stand by your right, as housekeeper, to control the table.\" \" That I will ; I'm not going to give in, and be lectured as if I were a baby. I'll let him see ! But, Mrs. Coulson, what if he really does bring a strange housekeeper into the house, as he threatened last night?\" \"Oh, honey, he won't do that,\" interrupted the widow; \"never mind his threats; big words break no bones! and he only means to frighten you into submission. My first husband used to do that, but his threats never came to anything. There now, that's right ; go upstairs and take your things off. I have a nice veal cutlet, and some pickled salmon, and din ner will be ready almost as soon as you are.\""], [146, "134 STUNG TO THE QUICK. CHAPTER XVIII. THE VALUE OF AN ALLY. When Mrs. Hesketh and her worthy* daughter returned home after tea, in the evening, it was to experience a succession of fresh trials. Barely was the door opened to admit them, than their sensitive olfactory organs were greeted with the foul stench of tobacco smoke. \"Who's that smoking in my house?\" demanded Mrs. Hes keth, with some asperity. Betty, a recent and rough importation from Gateshead Fell, strange to Durham and its inhabitants, answered briefly, \" Maister an' a gentleman.\" \"Gentleman, indeed! More likely one of his boon com panions from the Waterloo, or he would not think of smok ing in a private house, \u2014 and in the best parlour, too, I do declare! Well, this beats every thing, \" exclaimed her mistress, with uplifted hands on reaching the common sitting-room. \" Who is he, Betty ? \" questioned both ladies at once \"Aw dinnet ken,\" replied the woman, with a shake of the head. \" Have you not caught his name?\" Betty again shook her head as an accompaniment to the monosyllable \"ne,\" then with a sudden flash of recollection cried, \" Oh, now aw bethink me, aw mind hearin' the maister ca' the other 'doctor.'\" \" Ah, then, it will be Edwin, after all. I thought he could not stay away very long. How silly it is for papa to per sist in calling him 'doctor' before he is one.\" \"Don't be too sure, Lucy; Edwin did not look yesterday as if he meant coming back in a hurry, \" was the very con solatory observation of the unmotherly mother. \" Didn't he ? \" was the equally pert retort, concluded with the"], [147, "THE VALUE OF AN ALLY. 135 query, \" What is the young gentleman like ? \" addressed to Betty. \" Hout, he's na young ; his yead's as gray as ma owd faither's, an' there's as mony delves i' his brow; but he stan's as straight as a powker, an na mickle fatter, wi' his black coat buttoned up te his chin as if his sark1 wanted weshin', or he hadn't yen2 to wesh, an his black trousers are streeched wi' strops under his shoon till aw think they bin neigh splettin'.

For some time Lucy sat poking at the pattern of the carpet with the tip of her parasol, whilst Mrs. Hesketh rolled and unrolled her green kid gloves, pattered her foot on the floor, and meditated whether she should burst into the drawing-room, and enter a protest against its desecration. Nothing but utter dismay at the un exampled innovation had restrained her violence in the first instance; \u2014 with the knowledge of the visitor had come reflection. Wise had Mr. Hesketh been in his selection of Dr. Grove as confidential assistant in his scheme of home regeneration ; for if there was one man in Durham whose good opinion Mrs. Hesketh courted, it was Dr. Grove. Dr. Grove, the extensive practitioner, 1 Pitmen's provision-bags. z Mother."], [149, "THE VALUE OF AN ALLY. 137 who, though not a gossip, held gossips in awe, from his very shrewdness and quiet power of putting a falsehood down when he brought one to light ! Then Dr. Grove had to be conciliated as the natural adviser of his son, and though Mrs. Hesketh did not feel his consent indispensable to that son's marriage, she did feel that the match would be ineligible without it, for pecuniary reasons. Miss Hesketh, as may be supposed, shared her mother's desire to propitiate the doctor, and as the one sat pattering her foot, impatient at the impediment in the free exercise of her own inclination, and the other continued to trace the pattern of the carpet, both arrived through different channels at the same conclusion. \" It's very provoking ! \" exclaimed the elder lady at length. \"Very,\" echoed the younger. \" To think he should come to-night of all nights in the year,\" pettishly cried the former. \" Oh, I don't see anything very provoking in Dr. Grove coming here to-night more than any other time, but it is pro voking that Edwin has not made his appearance yet. I could cry for very vexation, for I know he is dangling after that disgusting Rhoda Wearbank, just out of spite. I've a good mind never to speak to him again, that I have.\" \" If Rhoda Wearbank has entrapped him you will have to wait long enough for a change, in my opinion,\" said unsym pathising Mrs. Hesketh, with a curl of the lip. \"What do you think of our going into the other room?\" asked she in continuation. \" I don't know, and I don't care,\" petulantly answered Lucy, who, unable longer to restrain her pent-up vexation and dis appointment, burst into tears. Whosoever was to blame in the first instance, certainly Lucy had sufficient reason for her uneasiness and tears, and a little delicacy on the part os' her mother was most desirable to allay the feelings of irritation."], [150, "138 STUNG TO THE QUICK. But Mrs. Hesketh had no sympathy with any one except herself, not even with her daughter, in a minor matter such as wounded affection, or wounded pride. Had she torn a new silk dress, or crushed a pretty bonnet, her distress for her daughter's misfortune would have been great and genuine; but when only feelings were torn or crushed, scorning a weakness she could not comprehend, she had a tendency to chafe and irritate rather than to solace. \"Well, I would not be a baby if I were you \u2014 crying for her sweetheart, to be sure, like a ninny \u2014 as if he was the first young man who had changed his mind before marriage. And what is he, after all? He has no property of his own except the little bit that was his mother's; and he's not in practice yet, and who knows that he ever will be \u2014 he hasn't passed yet. If I were you I would set my cap at Mr. Raeburn; he would be something like a catch for you,\" provokingly insisted Mrs. Hesketh, her intonation varying with each graceful suggestion. \" Then I shan't set my cap at Mr. Raeburn \u2014 and Ed win's as likely to pass his examination as anyone else; he's quite as clever, and if he hasn't much money his father has, and it will be all his some day ! But I won't stay here to be tantalised this way.\" Lucy had been biting the corners of her handkerchief between each interjectional assertion, as she half sobbed it out; but now she rose, gathered up gloves and parasol, and marched from the room to bathe her eyes and otherwise make herself presentable to Dr. Grove, whose friendly alliance she felt it politic to secure at once, now she had so favourable an opportunity. Mrs. Hesketh, too, concluding it was undesirable her husband should have the doctor all to himself, and do as he liked with the best room, after making some change in her toilet, presented herself in the hitherto tabooed apartment, where she found Dr. Grove and her husband no longer smoking, but occupied with a smart game of cribbage."], [151, "THE VALUE OF AN ALLY. 139 The doctor rose on her entrance, and bending his straight back in his customary formal bow, resumed his seat and the interrupted game, listening, with his left hand over his mouth as usual, to the counting of his opponent \u2014 \"fifteen two, fif teen four, \" and so on. Lucy was there before her, and with the artful intent of impressing Dr. Grove with an idea she was industrious and would make a useful wife for somebody, brought with her some plain needle-work and began to sew, opening very ostentatiously her handsome work-box in quest of needle, thread, and scissors. The click of the new key in the unused lock caught the sharp ear of the doctor, and, without looking up from his game, with one eye half closed he watched her movements ; marked that' lining and fittings, from thimble to scissors, were bright and new, though the outside bore evident marks of good rubbing and long purchase. So he set down her sewing at just what it was worth \u2014 a sham. He was too old to be duped by so shallow an artifice. She, however, worked away with a pleasant smile upon her face, fully believing that the doctor must think her notable in the extreme ; but he had seen the look of astonishment alike on the face of father and of mother, and set her down in his own mind as an artful and lazy young miss. To Mrs. Hesketh's horror the centre table contained a clay pipe and tobacco-pouch by Mr. Hesketh's elbow, a box of cigars, brandy and whisky in bottles (she had the decanters under lock and key), glasses partially emptied, water, sugar, a lemon, and \u2014 dreadful ! \u2014 one of her best knives had been used to cut it, and lay there stained with the acid. Worse than all was a new japanned spittoon at the foot of each gentleman. She was dumb with astonishment, bit her lips to keep her temper in, felt as if she should faint at the discovery \u2014 red and white chasing each other across her face very conspicuously. This, indeed, looked like asserting his supremacy in good earnest. Dinner ordered without her sanction or opinion, a"], [152, "140 STUNG TO THE QUICK. gentleman brought in without her knowledge, pipes and spit toons in her best room, the whole place reeking with smoke and spirits \u2014 it was as bad as a bar-parlour. Oh, if Dr. Grove were not there, what would she not say ! But Dr. Grove was there, intentionally there, so her lips were closed, much against her own will, and the two pursued their game cheerily and pleasantly, as though there was no such thing as a refractory wife in existence. After a time, Mr. Hesketh said, \"Lucy, Dr. Grove would like a little music. \" This was commonplace enough, but Lucy gave a visible start of astonishment at the unwonted request, which took the tone of a command, and which at another time she would have hesitated to obey; then, however, she thought it advisable to comply with a good grace, and, indeed, was rather pleased than otherwise that her father had given her a chance of displaying her skill as a musician. Her fingers had been educated much better than her heart, so she played the overtures from \"William Tell\" and \"Fra Diavolo \" to the entire satisfaction of herself and auditory, and the doctor thanked her very heartily. \" Have the goodness, Maria, to order supper, \" said Mr. Hesketh to his wife when the piano was closing. That lady bristled on the instant, and a sharp reply rose to the tip of her tongue; but the doctor happening to look up she marched from the room, more to cover her own de feat than to give the desired order. Betty had, however, received previous instructions from her master, so that Mrs. Hesketh found the cloth laid, and supper almost ready, without her intervention. , In vain she chafed and fumed. Betty, stolid and impene trable to all her sharp interrogatories, had but two replies \u2014 \"Maister ordered it,\" or \"Maister telt me,\" and pursued her course unmoved. She had seen through the day that a revolution was afoot, and was shrewd enough, as she said to herself, to see on which side her bread was buttered : besides"], [153, "HOW MISS DOROTHY MANAGED. 141 which, there was no little private exultation in the discomfiture of a mistress who only recognised in a servant the properties of a drudge \u2014 a sort of animated cleaning and cooking machine, in fact. Tied down to be civil at the supper-table by her desire to bear a fair character before the world, Mrs. Hesketh rather overdid her part as a courteous hostess, trusting in the retirement of the curtains to give an infallible lecture. But on the doctor's departure, Mr. Hesketh remarked, kindly but emphatically, \" I am happy to see that my caution has had the desired effect, and that you have both been discreet enough to receive my friend with civility. Good-night.\" And taking a chamber candle, he retired \u2014 not to his own room, but to Cuthbert's once more. CHAPTER XIX. HOW MISS DOROTHY MANAGED. After his country friends and Cuthbert had rolled away up or down hill according to their various destinations, Mr. Marsh took his hat from the peg and went out \u2014 first, how ever, apologising to Mr. Raeburn, who had just entered, as well as to Edwin Grove. \"I shall not be away long,\" said he; \"but if I am, my bairns will, I dare say, be quite as agreeable companions ; for with so bright a ray on the burn, and so pleasant a grove at hand, I do not think they can be very dull or unsociable.\" With the light laugh which always accompanied his own little witticisms (strained thoughthey often were), and the sideway nod which seemed to say, \" There's for you,\" the good gentleman walked down to Saddler Street, with a much more serious aspect than ordinary. Once or twice, in that short distance, he was intercepted by acquaintances who had"], [154, "142 STUNG TO THE QUICK. heard different versions of the previous day's disturbance, with its culmination that morning, and who wanted to \" hear the rights of the business from the fountain-head.\" \" Rights of the matter \u2014 there were no rights \u2014 all was mischief, and mischief is wrong, and I'm not the fountain head any more than yonder pant.* The fountain-head of mischief is always a woman; but I am sorry to see there are so many masculine pails at the service of the fountain. Good morning, gentlemen ; \" and Mr. Marsh walked on, scarcely heeding the careless laugh or the \" Sore subject that ! \" which followed his retreating steps in the one case, or the audibly whispered, \"That shoe pinches Marsh's corns,\" which greeted his ears from the rebuked gossip in the second instance. He arrived at Mr. Hesketh's in a state of perplexity and perturbation. No one who has not lived in a small town can compre hend how so tiny a pebble could ruffle the whole surface of the stream of its society, or that an insulting and personal allusion in a mere song could trouble so good a man as Mr. Marsh, who had made it a rule to regulate his actions by his conscience, and not by the opinions of his neigh bours. He had followed the dictates of humanity when he rescued Rhoda from starvation as a babe, and disregarding the counsels of less charitable advisers reared her as his own, in spite of the sly hints and innuendoes thrown out here and there that he \" knew more of the child's parentage than he cared to acknowledge.\" He had treated these insinuations lightly at the time, and they never troubled him, but now that the young girl he had so sedulously kept from all knowledge of her dependence until it was forced from him, and whom he had guarded from any sense of a dependent position since \u2014 now that she was made a target for the shafts of ridicule, he was greatly troubled, and all the antagonism in his nature \u2014 which, however, was not much \u2014 rose in arms against the offender. * The market-place pump, adorned with a statue of Neptune."], [155, "HOW MISS DOROTHY MANAGED. 143 Without stopping to give the clerk in the outer office the customary five minutes' pleasant chat which ever pre faced the diurnal visit to his friend, that morning he passed through with a mere nod of recognition, which surprised the wielder of rule and compass not a little, and he bit the tip of his quill-pen whilst perplexing himself to discover what offence he could possibly have given to Mr. Marsh. Mr. Hesketh was seated at a large office-table covered with red baize, with a map, or plan, spread out before him. His short legs were stretched out stiffly under the table, his head thrown back so as to bring his eyes in a direct line with a cobweb in the opposite corner of the ceiling, whilst his elbows rested on the arms of his chair, so as to bring the tips of his forefingers and thumbs in juxtaposition, as if he were designing a shape for a model bellows or a spade ace. The entrance of Mr. Marsh disturbed his reverie and des troyed the unrecorded designs, for he bounced up as the door opened and grasped the hand of the incomer as though he had not seen him for a month. \" Oh, Charles ! \" exclaimed he, eagerly, \" I have a new plan in contemplation.\" \" New ! Why, Hesketh, I have seen that map on your table till I know it at a glance for the Raeburn estate.\" \" Pooh, pooh, man, I don't refer to that, or any other business plan ; but I have a scheme afoot.\" \"Never mind it to-day, Hesketh; the scheme will keep. I came to see what can be done to stop your wife's talent for mischief.\" \"That's just it. That's what I referred to. I have a plan in my head which must succeed.\" \" Indeed ! then let me hear it; for I confess I am at a nonplus how to deal with a case the law does not reach, and with a woman not amenable to reason or feeling.\" So saying Mr. Marsh took a seat opposite to his friend, -who leaned his arms across the table, and prepared to"], [156, "144 STUNG TO THE QUICK. reveal his grand scheme of home and wife government. Having described the scene in Old Elvet the previous night, together with his threat and his morning performances in the way of ordering dinner, both at home and at the butcher's (where he had peremptorily cut off credit), Mr. Marsh was invited to dine with him. Mr. Marsh shook his head. \"Tea and supper, then, with a cosy pipe between,\" urged the regenerator. \" No, thank you, Hesketh ; I prefer my pipe in my own house ; not that I am disinclined to be sociable, as you well know, and not that I shrink from assisting your laudable though Quixotic scheme; but I should compromise my niece did I visit under the roof which owns as mistress her mali cious persecutor.\" \" Ah, well, perhaps you're right. But why do you call my scheme Quixotic ? \" \" Because you have not sufficient stability to go through with a course contrary to your own kindly nature. You have not the stern and uncompromising character requisite to put down, and keep down, a woman like your wife; and \u2014 pardon me \u2014 your love of ease and quiet will cause you to resign the sceptre as too heavy, granting you had the power to grasp it.\" \" I daresay you are right again in measure ; but you must know, Charles, there are limits to human endurance. The abominable insult to poor Rhoda, yesterday, to say nothing of that to myself or the draught on my purse, was added to a cup already brimming. I am thoroughly roused this time, and if I fail my name's not Cuthbert Hesketh ! \" \"Well, I am not so sanguine; but indeed I do not see how you are to restrain your wife's tongue abroad by any mode of coercion at home; and I believe Lucy to be as little amenable to control as her mother.\" \" You are not mistaken there ; but she is young, and follows her mother's example. I hope seasonable care may improve"], [157, "HOW MISS DOROTHY MANAGED. 145 her. Indeed, I blame myself that I did not send her from home to be educated away from the evil influence. It's a lamentable case, Charles, when a man has reason, really reason, to speak thus of his wife and child. Indeed, if it were not for the scandal, I would have a legal separation from Maria; and unless I succeed, that is my ultimatum.\" \" Suppose you consulted Dr. Grove ; he is clearer-sighted than either you or I, and may be a very valuable ally, either offensive or defensive.\" \" Thank you for the hint. He will indeed be a valuable coadjutor. Let us go to him at once.\" \" You had better go to him alone ; and I would advise you to say nothing of having consulted me first. All doctors regard secresy as the essence of success. He would doubt counsel shared with another.\" Thus it was that Dr. Grove became a party to Mr. Hes keth's plans, and assisted materially to uphold one who, as Mr. Marsh surmised, would not have had resolute persever ance to carry on the conflict alone. But notwithstanding her awe of Dr. Grove, Mrs. Hesketh did not resign dominion without a severe and protracted struggle. She broke the pipes, burned the cards, hid the spittoons, locked up the spirits, countermanded the orders. But Mr. Hesketh brought home a locksmith, had the locks picked, and furnished with a triplet of keys, except one pri vate cupboard, on which was placed a patent lock with one key only. In this he secured all articles on which his ami able wife had made a raid. Then he sent upholsterers into the house to fit up a spare room for a lady; and when he found that the servant was obstructed in obeying his orders, and discovered moreover that he himself understood nothing whatever either of housekeeping or domestic management, he left home and returned in a few days with a pleasant, chubby old lady and a multitude of boxes, large and small. The boxes were conveyed to the newly-appointed chamber, and the pleasant old lady duly introduced to Mrs. Hesketh L"], [158, "146 STUNG TO THE QUICK. as Mr. Hesketh's only sister, Miss Dorothea Hesketh, come, at great inconvenience to herself, to reside with her brother and to relieve Mrs. Hesketh of the care of her household, until that lady's restoration to health would enable her to resume her domestic duties as head of the family. Mrs. Hesketh was furious, raved and wondered how Mr. Hesketh dared to bring anyone there over her head, and finally threw herself into a violent fit of hysterics. The chubby old lady pitied the unfortunate younger one, who was griev ously afflicted, and bustled about for such restoratives as were available, calling kindly to Lucy and the maid to render assistance. The patient was laid on the floor, cold water was sprinkled plentifully on face and neck, regardless of cap, ribands, or pelerine; salt was rubbed between the closed teeth, the hands were well slapped, and other pleasant and time honoured antidotes proposed. The attack, as might be expected, yielded to the remedies applied, and then Miss Dorothea suggested, very soothingly, that a comfortable nap would be most refreshing under the circumstances, and offered, very obligingly, to assist her afflicted sister-in-law to her room. Whether Miss Dorothea (whose existence had been ignored by her sister-in-law for many years) did or did not believe that Mrs. Hesketh's frequent hysterical attacks were genuine must remain a mystery. Certainly she ever treated that lady with the compassion due to one labouring under a severe affliction, and whose bursts of passion, traceable to the same source, were to be soothed and borne as the outbursts of a mind slightly overthrown. Nothing she might do or say disturbed the old lady's equanimity*: she moved about the house cheerfully and noiselessly, gave instructions to Betty when necessary, or assisted where a little timely help might relieve the girl's labour. The third set of the triplet of keys had been entrusted to her, and then ensued a thorough supervision of closets"], [159, "HOW MISS DOROTHY MANAGED. 147 and cupboards \u2014 a clearance of rubbish, always with a kindly regard for Mrs. Hesketh's comfort, and audibly-expressed compassion for the state of mind and body which had pre vented her from looking after these things for herself. The linen was reviewed and, when dilapidated, repaired \u2014 not thrown aside as worthless. Then, as the season was far advanced, the chubby spinster heated her warm face over the kitchen fire, making jams, preserves, and pickles for the use of the family. She strove likewise to make Lucy ashamed of her idleness ; not all at once, but bit by bit, pretending not to see the girl's unwillingness, and assuming that she only wanted teaching \u2014 a pleasant fiction which did some little towards the improvement of her niece in the long run. But Lucy was so much engrossed with her own affairs, she had little thought to spare for the changes taking place around her. Edwin Grove had palpably deserted her. If they met in the streets, he passed with a cool bow. Weeks went by, yet he never called or made any advance towards a reconciliation. Alternately she chafed and fretted as anger or regret swayed her by turns, and she wearied herself with puzzling how to recall the wandering swain. If she sought counsel from her mother, she either received the snappish answer, \" I have troubles enough of my own without being bothered with your love affairs,\" or was asked sneeringly, \"Dear me, what do you ask my advice for? My advice is worth nothing, no one cares for my opinion now. You had better consult your most amiable aunt, she knows better than I can; I am only your mother.\" At first she had determined to play off two rivals against Edwin, and make him jealous; but neither Mr. Lighthead nor Mr. Fortescue were to be seen. Rumour had assigned a sufficient reason for the sequestration of the one, and after a while the absence of the other was"], [160, "148 STUNG TO THE QUICK. accounted for. It transpired during one of Dr. Grove's many visits, that Mr. Fortescue was on the verge of dissolution, and that Mr. Lighthead, in spite of his puppyism, had been a devoted and constant attendant by the bed-side of his dying friend, whose sufferings affected him deeply. Dr. Grove also intimated that he said \"Mrs. Hesketh's accursed pic-nic was the cause of all.\" When death closed the poor profligate's career, all the horrible truth came to Mrs. Hesketh and Lucy from many quarters, with neither disguise nor palliation, until even the former was shocked and subdued by so disastrous a termination of her frolic. This happened a few days after Miss Dorothea's arrival, and helped most materially to the establishment of that lady's rule, whilst it dissipated all Lucy's scheme for playing a tit-for-tat game. Leaving Miss Dorothea to win the heart of Betty by her gentle good-nature, as firm as it was gentle, and by her readiness alike to direct or assist; leaving her to subdue Mrs. Hesketh by diplomatic misconception and imperturbable good humour; leaving her to attempt Lucy's improvement, to create comfort for her brother, and win the esteem of Dr. Grove, it is desirable we return to South Street, where Mr. Raeburn and Edwin Grove continued to sit much beyond the period assigned by etiquette to a morning call. CHAPTER XX. REPOSE. Mr. Marsh had left behind him a less social party than he imagined. The fact is, neither young gentleman was satisfied with the presence or the objects of the other. Having met for the first time the previous day, each was anxious to learn the"], [161, "REPOSE. 149 degree of intimacy, existing between Mr. Marsh's family and his new acquaintance, without at the same time revealing his own anxiety. Each had an uncomfortable fear lest the magnet which drew him thither should possess like attractions for his neighbour, and whilst carefully guarding his own conversation and manner, watched and listened for word or sign to betray the depth or direction of a conflicting interest. Consequently the conversation was dull and vapid in the extreme, consisting of little more than common-place remarks on the weather, the season, the party of the preceding day, and a few anecdotes connected with Edwin's hospital career elicited by an inquiry of Eva's. \" I presume Captain Hesketh will have joined his ship by this time ? \" observed or rather asked Frank, during one of the frequent pauses. \" Oh dear, no ! \" responded Eva, readily ; \" Cuthbert will not be more than half way to Leamside yet. He has been here all the morning, and unless Martin drives very rapidly I expect he will miss the train. \" \" That must be a very powerful attraction which could keep Captain Hesketh away from his ship when duty called him hence, \" said Mr. Raeburn, lightly* but pointedly, glancing from Eva to Rhoda as he spoke, as if to glean which was \" the attrac tion \" from their faces. Rhoda, feeling no emotion, betrayed none; but Eva, conscious that Cuthbert had dallied by Rhoda's side, forgetful of his allegiance to Mary, and yet unwilling to implicate her cousin by saying so, looked both annoyed and confused. Frank noted the sign, on which he put his own construction, and pressed his close lips closer, at the same time spoiling a new kid glove with ineffaceable impressions of his finger ends upon the palm. The quarrel of the previous day, Edwin Grove had persuaded himself, was a sufficient pretext for a transfer of his attentions from Miss Hesketh to whomsoever he would, for the time being ;"], [162, "150 STUNG TO THE QUICK. and should he see fit, after further consideration, it was a firm basis for the nullification of their engagement altogether. During his probationary sojourn in the metropolis he had learned many things beside medicine, and a flirtation more or less imported little. At that present moment he was fascinated by Miss Wearbank, and Cuthbert's attentions in the same quarter having attracted his notice, he was as ready to observe the effect of Mr. Raeburn's remark as was that gentleman himself. \" The coast's clear in that quarter, .at all events, \" thought he, as he watched Rhoda's impassive face ; \" I wish I only knew what this other fellow means. I've a notion he's after one of the girls, and I should like to find out which, for hang me if I can tell. Perhaps he's only a friend after all. But no, no; he did not throw out that sly hint for nothing. However, I'm not afraid of him, or his moustache either, and if he comes in my way it will be him or me for it, that's all. \" Such were the rapid thoughts which chased each other through Edwin Grove's brain, as he pulled his gloves on and off two or three times, undetermined whether to go or stay; conscious he had remained an unreasonable time, but equally reluctant to resign the ground to the very elegant gentleman before him. As a tangible excuse to prolong his visit, he begged that Miss Wear bank would favour them with a view of the sketch she had made at Finchale the day before. Rhoda's colour was under command. A host of disagreeable recollections crowded round her heart and clouded her brow at this reminder; but the cloud passed as rapidly as it came, and she lightly affected to depreciate the power of her pencil. \" Permit us to judge of that, Miss Wearbank, \" said Mr. Rae burn, with a polite inclination of his head. \" I assure you, Mr. Raeburn, Miss Wearbank has the touch of an artist. I saw that in the glimpse with which I was favoured yesterday. Do, Miss Wearbank, oblige us all with a glance at your drawings, even if you reserve the one in question for the friend to whom it was dedicated,\" said Edwin, turning to her entreatingly-"], [163, "REPOSE. 151 Rhoda hesitated, anxious to display to Mr. Raeburn a talent with which he was yet unacquainted, and quite as desirous to avoid either the appearance of display or too much readi ness to oblige Mr. Grove. \" Now, Rhoda, do bring your portfolio down, or let me run for it, there's a dear girl. You know that your sketches are exquisite, and why* should you refuse to show them ? I only wish I had any half as good to exhibit. Your houses and trees never stoop to prop each other up, as mine do ; nor have any of your animals the slightest trace of an ante diluvian classification. You need not be ashamed of your drawings, so let me go for them.\" Apparently moved by Eva's urgent entreaty, Rhoda con sented, and left the room, ostensibly for the purpose, but, in truth, to remove from her portfolio a portrait of Frank Rae burn, not intended for general inspection. During her brief absence, Eva commented on the beauty of her cousin's drawings in glowing terms of genuine admira tion; and while Edwin Grove listened, and thought so much talent worth some trouble to win, Frank Raeburn hoped and trusted so much artlessness and generosity would not fall to the lot of a rough sailor like Cuthbert, incapable, as in his opinion he must be, of appreciating their worth. It was a triumph to Rhoda to read the admiration of Mr . Raeburn in his eyes, as well as to hear it from his lips, to say nothing of the open encomiums of Edwin Grove. Would she have been satisfied with her triumph, could she have known the restraint put upon Frank's right arm, lest it should clasp invo luntarily the fair girl at his side, busied in selecting for his inspec tion the sketches or paintings she deemed worthiest of praise ? Rhoda herself made light of the whole, treating them as the mere amusement of an idle hour; although she knew in her secret heart she had devoted herself most assiduously to the cultivation of every talent or power she possessed, and that industry and energy combined had made her what she was, as artist and musician both."], [164, "152 STUNG TO THE QUICK. Mr. Raeburn, suddenly recalling an appointment with Mr. Hesketh, drew his watch from a side-pocket (not the un fashionable fob), and, with a hasty apology alike for his abrupt departure and his lengthy visit, retired, leaving Edwin Grove behind to rejoice in having out-generalled him. Soon he, too, thought proper to depart, and then the two weary girls looked for repose. Both were fatigued with the exertion consequent on the entertainment of a number of guests, coupled with the dancing and late hours. To Rhoda's weariness was superadded a sleepless night of agony, and the superhuman effort required to sustain a dis guise for the requirement of which she was unprepared. The drawings were barely replaced in the portfolio when Bella entered to lay the dinner-cloth, and Mr. Marsh, with his accustomed punctuality, opened the street-door. There was no repose now until the cloth was withdrawn, when Mr. Marsh took his pipe into the garden, and had his forty winks on a rustic seat under the shade of a patri archal pear-tree. Rhoda and Eva then retired also, the latter to perplex herself on her pillow (her fair face lost in a maze of flaxen curls) whether Mr. Raeburn thought most of herself or Rhoda, or whether he cared anything in parti cular for either, and in the midst of her puzzle she fell asleep, to dream all sorts of impossible and improbable things, in which Frank and Rhoda mingled in strange confusion. Rhoda retired for repose, but repose with her did not mean a siesta. She would have been thankful for the oblivion of sleep, but, with her mind in a whirl, sleep was an impossibility. She required repose, but it was the repose of solitude, \u2014 and at length she had it. Bolting herself in her room, she began to pace it hurriedly, with her hands clasped tightly over the knot of her black hair, and as her thoughts ran riot, her eyes dilated, or her face pinched with pain, and her step varied with her mood. But the vehemence wore itself out. With water, cold as the season afforded, she bathed her hot head copiously, with no"], [165, "REPOSE. 153 fear of exciting observation by lank tresses, since hers, wet or dry, curled with almost Creole crispness. Then she traversed her room again, with her hands still tightly clenched, not above her head, but this time down before her, and her step was slow and measured. The whirlwind was past, and she was endeavouring to repair the ravages of the storm. Slowly she trod the floor, deliberating and considering, as one so young should never consider or deliberate ; and, having resolved to hurl defiance at those who had braved and outfaced her, set herself to plot how she could most securely and unsus pectedly wreak her vengeance on the Heskeths and secure Mr. Raeburn for herself at the same time. The two seemed almost incompatible, yet she determined to accomplish both. Cuthbert was gone; she could devote the whole of her energies to the enslaving of Frank ; true, she had made slow progress hitherto, but she had read love and admiration in the look that kindled at her drawings. (Ah, Rhoda, could you but have known that all the love and much of the admiration your keen eye discerned was for the single-minded, unaffected cousin, whose simple charms and attainments you held in such contempt!) As for that self sufficient fool, Edwin Grove, who had quarrelled with his sweetheart in her hearing, and was decidedly smitten with herself, she would just keep him dangling until the breach was beyond repair; and then perchance it might suit her to palm him upon Eva. She would think of it. Thus, with the world at her feet, and in her web, she thought herself into complacency; and throwing her weary body on a sofa in her room, fell into a sound heavy sleep, from which Bella, knocking at the bolted door, had much difficulty to arouse her when tea-time came."], [166, "154 STUNG TO THE QUICK. CHAPTER XXI. BELOW THE SURFACE. Mr. Raeburn had few friends in Durham, those he had being principally the associates of his late uncle, and conse quently older than himself. The seclusion of his father's life had, as a natural consequence, isolated him from youthful society until his habits and tastes were in a manner formed ; and though there was no want of sociality in his composition, he was chary of forming fresh acquaintances. His distinguished personal appearance, not less than his position as a landowner in the county, had rendered him an object both of admiration and speculation, and being voted \"an eligible match,\" invi tations poured in upon him from all quarters, a very flimsy pretext serving for an introduction. On most of those professing to be old friends of his father or uncle he called, it is true, but seldom repeated the visit of ceremony, excusing himself on the ground that until he had decided on his own abode and could reciprocate hospi tality he must decline visiting, a reply which tended not only to check intrusion but to whet the edge of curiosity; whilst it offended no one, since it was given to all alike. Dr. Grove and his uncle had been college chums, Mr. Hesketh confidential agent of both father and uncle, and Mr. Marsh a dear friend of the latter. But of the three, Mr. Marsh was the only one hitherto visited, \u2014 a fact commented on by all the disappointed belles and dames cognisant of the circumstance. So Mr. Raeburn was stigmatised as haughty and purse proud in one quarter, as conceited and vain in another, as reserved and morose, or weak and credulous in others, according to the phase of his life and manner under review, or the special point of observation. Amongst the speculations rife were wonders what he could"], [167, "BELOW THE SURFACE. 155 find so interesting at the Marshes', and expectations that if he were making love to that Miss Wearbank he would be finely disappointed when he found she was nobody after all. That Mrs. Hesketh and her clique were the only ones indulging in these remarks it would not be fair to say, but that they were in particular favour with her intimates is indubitable ; these wiseacres overlooking the fact that there was a second and scarcely less attractive young lady in the same house, or the possibility that a young gentleman might visit a middle-aged one without any ulterior object. Gladly would Mrs. Hesketh have ignored her daughter's engagement with young Mr. Grove could she have substituted one with Mr. Raeburn. And hot had been the war between the surveyor and his less scrupulous wife, because he stoutly refused her the chance of making a dead set at the wealthy new-comer, by inviting him under their roof. Therefore, when he reached Mr. Hesketh's office that day, somewhat later than his appointment, and, after a very cursory reference to the plan on the table, received and accepted an invitation to dine with his trustworthy agent, the arrangement was a mere matter of business, not ceremony. The lease of a colliery on Mr. Raeburn's property would lapse shortly, and the subject of discussion was whether he should thenceforth work the pit himself or renew the lease to the present occupiers. For the uninterrupted discussion of this question he accepted the invitation given by Mr. Hesketh, given with the threefold motive \u2014 of business, the assertion of master ship at home, and a curb on the tongue of the deposed matron. Mr. Raeburn knew nothing of the domestic differences, nothing of the feminine schemes for his hand and lands, nothing of the absent ladies,\" whose loss he did not regret, since the matter in hand was discussed more freely without them; whilst to the husband and father it was a decided relief. But when Mrs. Hesketh heard of the visit \u2014 not from Mr. Hesketh, not from Betty, but from Mrs. Coulson \u2014 then were her rage and disappointment at fever height; in striving to defeat and"], [168, "156 STUNG TO THE QUICK. mortify her husband, she had only defeated and mortified her self; her temper rose with her vexation, and terminated as usual with a shower of tears. In the struggle for the gentleman's nether garments which followed, and before that gentleman's excellent sister was brought upon the scene, Lucy was almost entirely overlooked by the contending parties. Judging from externals, and from his experience of her mother, Mr. Hesketh had a belief that \" like mother like daughter,\" and that Lucy had no heart to be wounded, even though Edwin Grove (whose prolonged absence he could not fail to note) did break faith with her. There, however, he was mistaken. Lucy had a heart, such as it was \u2014 a heart which different cultivation might have developed to much better purpose ; but the mother's blood, the mother's milk, and the mother's training had gone to repress those germs of kindliness and affection which might otherwise have linked her with the paternal side. What little affection she had was given to Edwin Grove, as girls give their hearts, without thought or consideration; but vanity and selfishness occupied so very large a portion of that very little heart, that what she did give away was not much worth either giving or having. As Rhoda had remarked to Mr. Marsh, beaus were not very plentiful in Durham, and the flattered vanity of having a lover, and being engaged, when so many of her companions were dying of envy of her good fortune, was a large com ponent of her love for Edwin. Now, however, that he had deserted her, so palpably deserted her, too, for a girl who had been her rival at school \u2014 a girl without a penny \u2014 a girl, who came no one knew whence, her mortification was extreme; she was wounded in her sorest point; her friends would laugh at her, and that they did was beyond a doubt; but, in spite of vanity, Edwin Grove had a place in her heart, even though he shared it with much lumber; and she fretted after him in her own peculiar fashion."], [169, "BELOW THE SURFACE. 157 That peculiar fashion was, to cry pettishly in her own room and bite her finger-nails, then bathe her face, put on her best bonnet and her best smiles, and saunter out to make herself as wretched as possible by throwing herself in his way, just to show her perfect indifference. On his part, he had been not a little at a loss how to excuse his appearance in Durham and at a pic-nic, without any previous announcement of his home-coming or a preliminary visit to his liege lady. Having at first taken the high vantage ground of indignation at the company in which he found her \u2014 namely, that of Jack Fortescue and Mr. Lighthead \u2014 and not knowing how to descend gracefullv, he preserved his lofty demeanour and his distance, moved thereto in a great measure by the lever in South Street. As the days wore into weeks, Rhoda's tact completed the estrangement her dangerous beauty had shadowed forth. When he met Lucy in the market-place, or on the narrow bridge-paths, or on the promenade by the river-side, he would raise his hat and pass her with so courteous and distant an inclination of the head, that the cut was more severe and stinging than if he had taken no notice of her whatever. Every time they met the pain was greater, yet she could not restrain her feet from wandering where she met the pain. At length, in a passion of wounded vanity and feeling, she sent back all his letters, together with the turquoise forget-me-not ring which she wore as a token of their troth, requesting a corres ponding return, since her letters could have no further value for him. This was not exactly what he had expected, and it took him aback. He was not so utterly confounded by Rhoda's bright eyes as to lose sight of his boyish flame all at once, and he felt himself very much of a culprit. There was, however, in Lucy's letter no appeal to old memories or to his better feelings, no remonstrance, no reproach, but a taunt and a sneer throughout."], [170, "158 STUNG TO THE QUICK. In the former case he would most likely have taken the ring and letters back, and patched up a peace, but the taunt put him on his mettle, and he took time to consider his answer. To do that more effectually he sauntered up to Mr. Marsh's. Mr. Raeburn being just then away in London, Rhoda was more irresistibly fascinating and condescending than usual. The next evening, and the next, found him on the same spot, deferring the return of Lucy's letters, undecided whether to accept her resignation or not; but, just as the term of his vacation expired, a second letter, accusing him of a dishonourable motive in retaining her billets, roused him into action; he accepted the challenge, and returned them \u2014 a curl of tawny hair peeping out of one, with a suggestiveness of old associations which he would even then have recalled but for petty pride. She had accused him of a dishonourable motive in keeping her letters, thereupon the unimpeachable gentleman bristled up in indignation, and to show that he was not dishonourable sent them back, and so broke faith, which of course was not dis honourable. In two or three days he went to London, carrying with him the sketch Rhoda had made under his eye at Finchale. This he hung in his room, \" which served him for chamber and parlour and all, \" ousting from a rosewood frame a group of flowers in oriental tinting from Lucy's school-fingers, in order to make way for the newer and certainly more artistic production. Cuthbert was gone and Edwin Grove was gone; Rhoda had done what damage to both their hearts she could, had moreover succeeded in separating both pairs of lovers very unsuspectedly ; and now she had leisure to devote to the enslaving of Frank Raeburn. In doing this she had no deliberate intention to supplant Eva or to cause her a moment's pain. She simply ignored the possibility of Eva as a rival, in the first instance; and even when the possibility dawned upon her, she did not realize the fact that Eva had feelings to be wounded. Blinded by her own passion, self alone was dominant; she saw no rio-hts which should imperil her conquest of the man she adored."], [171, "BELOW THE SURFACE. 159 To this end she bent every energy of her strong mind and strong will. But she made very slow progress ; he seemed proof against her blandishments. In vain she changed * from grave to gay, from lively to severe, \" his mood was still the same. If she courted flattery he gave it freely, but no device of hers could entrap him into warmth of manner or expression towards her; and though she watched his movements like a lynx \u2014 never left Eva alone with him for an instant \u2014 shared all excursions \u2014 she equally sailed to detect any latent regard for her cousin ; and week after week rolled by, yet her aim was unaccomplished, and Mr. Raeburn remained to her impenetrable as the sphynx \u2014 cold as an iceberg. Remembering his admiration of her drawings, she would lure Eva away with her into the country or down by the riverside, while she made sketches of old barns, byres, and wayside cottages, or, as the season advanced, with her crayons limned the changing hues of sun-struck foliage. She was always careful to leave word at home which direction they should take, and so it fell out that not unfrequently Mr. Raeburn met them on their homeward path, or joined the fair artist and her companion by the riverside, when he often wondered whether Miss Wearbank or her picture was the most picturesque. Rhoda was always \" surprised \" to see him when he came, but Eva began to look for his appearance as a natural result of a stroll with pencils and portfolio, and looked for it with almost as much pain as pleasure, so naturally did her cousin appropriate the little services, attentions, or compliments of their cavalier. The merry laugh was seldom heard now from Eva's lips, a shade of thought settled on her face, the dancing step lost its elasticity. But something of this might be due to her occupation \u2014 on these occasions generally a braid watch-guard \u2014 which required her whole attention lest she should convert a square into a round. At least this was the reason she assigned when Mr. Raeburn said to her one day \u2014 \" You are very serious over your work, Miss Marsh ; I have not seen the colour of your eyes this afternoon. \""], [172, "160 STUNG TO THE QUICK. He saw, however, the rising colour in her cheeks, when she replied, without raising her head, \" I should make mistakes if I looked up often. \" \" But is your work of so much importance you require to bring it with you, when it may prevent the enjoyment of a sunset and scenery such as this?\" \"Oh! Eva does not care for scenery or sunsets,\" put in Rhoda, carelessly, without looking round from her drawing. \" I hope that is not true, Miss Marsh ? \" said the gentle man, inquiringly. \" Indeed it is not, Mr. Raeburn ; but it is very dull to sit here for hours doing nothing, and very unsocial to bring a book ; so I bring my work instead, because I can chat over that.\" \" It would not be unsocial were you to read aloud to Miss Wearbank whilst she sketched.\" A slight shrug of Rhoda's shoulders was just perceptible to Mr. Raeburn's observant eyes, but she made no other remark. Eva, on the contrary, with a bright smile, said, apologetically \u2014 \" Ah, but I read so very indifferently and monotonously, Rhoda does not care to hear me.\" \" If that is so, it indeed alters the case, and I can under stand why you prefer work,\" assented he, having mentally connected the admission with the shrug, though dubious of its verity, nevertheless. \" And what do you with these fairy chains when you have made them? You cannot wear them all yourself.\" \" Oh no ! I give them to my friends. One my father wears, another I gave to Mr. Hesketh, and \" \"One to Captain Hesketh, you remember, Eva,\" insinuated Rhoda, as if refreshing a treacherous memory. \" Yes, and one to Cuthbert ; and this- Mr. Raeburn had been playing with the dangling end of the unfinished braidwork; he dropped it like a live coal at the name of Captain Hesketh, but Eva's frank assent and"], [173, "BELOW THE SURFACE. 161 the hesitating \" and this \" which followed, banished a hasty suspicion he had formed, and prompted him to say \u2014 \" And this, Miss Marsh, I should be proud to possess if you have not already a claimant for it.\" \" I was making it for you, only I was afraid you would scarcely think it worth wearing.\" \" Worth wearing ! \" They were only two words, in tone too low to catch Rhoda's anxious ears, but the look which accompanied them caused Eva to bend once more the head she had raised in offerinsr o her handiwork. Rhoda did not catch the look or the words, but she caught the tone, and with a scowl her companions did not see, gathered up her drawing materials and her fallen scarf, declaring it was growing quite chilly and they had better return home. And home they turned, Eva more buoyant than she had been since the unfortunate gipsy-party, but disposed to be silent ; Mr. Raeburn, endeavouring to reconcile contradictions, was silent also. Nor was Rhoda, who pondered the depth and import of the low words she could not distinguish, much more disposed to be loquacious. As each, however, became conscious of unwonted taciturnity, each made sudden dashes at conversation, which lapsed into failure for lack of support. At Mr. Marsh's door Mr. Raeburn would have bowed him self off; but he had been seen from the window, and Mr. Marsh's cheery voice was heard calling him back. \" I say, Frank ; you are not going off in that way. You will stay and have tea with us? \" \" Thank you, Mr. Marsh ; but I have letters to write to some friends in Antigua, and do not wish to lose the mail.\" \"Hout! the post does not go until to-morrow; you have time enough to fill the mail-bag before then. Bairns, can't you persuade him to remain?\" Rhoda, so inspirited, extended a delicate hand, from which the glove had just been withdrawn, and turned up a pair of M"], [174, "162 STUNG TO THE QUICK. eloquent, languishing eyes with a look of entreaty which might have pierced a man's soul through plate armour; but Eva, who would have taken forcible possession of Cuthbert to pull him into the hall had he been there, just lifted up her blue eyes, which fell in an instant, and shaped her lips to words of invitation which never passed them. Whether he heard the unspoken words or was drawn in by the extended hand it is needless to inquire ; suffice it that the letters to Antigua were set aside until midnight, if they were written at all. After tea, a north-country tea, instead of his customary request for a song or two, Mr. Marsh said, quietly \u2014 \" Rhoda, do you not think / ought to have a glimpse of the wonderful views you have taken lately ? Eva tells me they are so truthful one may hear the very leaves rustle and the river flow.\" \"Nay, nay, papa, I said you might almost fancy it.\" \"Well, puss, and isn't that pretty much about the same thing ? Come, Rhoda, bring out the sheets of cardboard, and let me see, from these fancy sketches, whether you have wasted your time or not.\" \" Miss Wearbank has certainly not misused her time, Mr. Marsh; she has a power and finish rarely seen in a young lady's pencil,\" said Mr. Raeburn, when Rhoda left the room for her portfolio. \" I have had frequent opportunities of judging her style; but, Miss Marsh,\" continued he, turning to Eva, \" how is it no vestige of your drawing is ever to be seen \u2014 no scrap of paper fluttering about tells of a taste for the art, although you admitted yourself that you had drawings to pro duce ; and were I a phrenologist I might say you have ' form ' and 'colour,' and should be able to paint well?\" \" Ah, then, Mr. Raeburn, phrenology is wrong, \" laughed Eva; \"I have, really, nothing worth showing. Indeed, I am ashamed to look at them myself; for since I have seen Rhoda's exquisite sketches I have been quite out of conceit with my own feeble attempts.\""], [175, "163 BELOW THE SURFACE. \" Indeed ! \" exclaimed Mr. Marsh ; \" and so all your draw ing lessons are to go for nothing, you puss ! But here comes Rhoda with her treasure. Do you run, honey, for your ' feeble attempts,' and let our phrenological friend here form his own estimate as to the use of your colours.\" And he laughed jocosely. \"Oh, papa! I have not, really, a drawing fit to be seen, Rhoda will tell you so if you only ask her,\" remonstrated Eva, in an undertone to her father, as he opened the door to facilitate her departure, and at the same time admitted Dr. Grove. \"What is it that Eva does not think fit to be seen?\" asked the doctor, who had partly overheard her remonstrance, when he had shaken hands all round. \"What is it?\" \" Well, doctor, Mr. Raeburn is desirous to see the bairn's drawings, and she says they are not fit to be seen beside Rhoda's; now, for my part, although I do not consider myself much of a judge, I always thought they were an average sample.\" \"Yes; but, Mr. Marsh, Miss Wearbank's specimens are far above the average,\" interposed Mr. Raeburn, shaking hands with the doctor as he spoke; \"it would therefore be unjust to institute a comparison.\" Dr. Grove, with his head bent, his hand over his mouth, and his eyes half shut, stood somewhat in the shade, watching the group at the table bending over Rhoda's portfolio, and he saw her eyes expand and glisten with delight at the encomiums of Mr. Raeburn ; he saw, too, the almost imperceptible curl of the lip as Eva timidly brought her less pretentious store for inspection, evidently dreading Frank Raeburn's condemna tion. Himself unseen, he kept his eye upon Rhoda, who had long been a mystery to him; and now that his son evinced a leaning towards the fascinating young lady, he resolved to study her more closely for that son's sake. Eva stood with her arm drawn through her father's (it might be for support), watching anxiously the expression of"], [176, "164 STUNG TO THE QUICK. the young connoisseur's face as he turned over drawing after drawing in grave silence, with a touch of sadness more than pleasure in his looks; while Rhoda leaned forward eagerly, and, with her great black eyes, seemed ready to devour the silent tribute to her superiority and the inference of her cousin's mediocrity. But her triumphant eyes fell as Mr. Raeburn (though without any of the artistic enthusiasm he had bestowed on her river scenes) quietly observed, \" I see nothing in these drawings of which you, Miss Marsh, or any young lady need be ashamed ; they do not display the force or freedom of your cousin's, but, if I may venture an opinion, I should say you studied under different masters.\" \"Dear me, how could you tell that? \" asked Eva, breathing more freely. \"Oh! very easily,\" replied he, with a slight smile; \"and were it not for the class of subjects selected, I should also say you had been instructed by a lady.\" \"I declare you are as good as a conjuror, Mr. Raeburn,\" said Eva, with sparkling eyes. \" Yes, truly ; for he has observed your partiality for shipping and sea- views,\" thrust in Rhoda. Again the shade passed over Mr. Raeburn's face, but Dr. Grove blew the cloud away with a breath of truth. \" Perhaps, Miss Rhoda, difference of education has as much to do with subject as with style. A Sunderland teacher, her self country-bred, would select the subjects most familiar both to herself and pupil. You may congratulate yourself on having had a London master skilled in his art and versatile in its exposition.\" Not only Eva but Mr. Raeburn looked their thanks as the doctor spoke, and Rhoda acquiesced in the truth of his obser vation with a ready frankness which deceived all but the shrewd old man. Relieved from the suggestion of Cuthbert's secret influence, Mr. Raeburn looked over the drawings with a new pleasure,."], [177, "165 BELOW THE SURFACE. pointing out a defect here, a beauty there, ending with an encouragement to resume her pencil and an offer to assist her advancement by occasional suggestions. He did not say instructions, but it was inferred ; and Rhoda, gathering up her productions in superb disdain, carried them from the room, only to stamp with vexation on the floor of her chamber, and call herself and all concerned a \" parcel of idiots.\" As Mr. Raeburn went home that night, he collected the dust Rhoda had thrown into his eyes, and examined it by the glass Dr. Grove had lent him. Not on that day alone had she coupled Eva's name with Captain Hesketh's, or artfully suggested a more than friendly relation between the two, which insinuations he (knowing nothing of Mary Reed) had taken for more than they were worth ; but previously to the pic-nic, and during it, she had so contrived as to leave a lurking suspicion in his mind that a very tender sentiment united Eva with the sailor. At once he sedulously set himself to find the key to her conduct, and once found, however much it might flatter his vanity, it kept him on the alert, not only with regard to Rhoda but himself. As the weather grew colder, and the leaves fluttered to the ground out of doors, sketching was abandoned ; but by the cosy fire Eva collected her materials once more, and strove sedulously to overtake her cousin, whilst Rhoda in secret laughed scornfully at her efforts, knowing them to be futile. She threw the force of her character into all she did, and whether she touched the piano or the pencil, stamped he individuality* upon it. The very clothes she wore sat upon her differently than the same garments upon Eva. You felt that Eva was graceful and beautiful, you both saw and felt that Rhoda was. Mr. Raeburn often dropped in to give the promised \" suggestions, \" and at such times Eva would glow with animation. After a time, Rhoda suddenly discovered she had something yet to learn, and so sweetly and seductively"], [178, "166 STUNG TO THE QUICK. referred to him all questions on perspective, light or shadows, that poor Eva's gleam of sunshine faded into twilight. Early in November came Eva's birthday, and with it presents and letters of congratulation from many friends. Gloves, buckles, belts, books, and a small pyramid of silver thimbles were arranged before her when Mr. Marsh and Mr. Raeburn came in together, and the latter placed a parcel in her hand, with a low-voiced birthday wish which haunted her for many a day. It was an elegantly bound copy of Moore's \"Lalla Rookh,\" illustrated by Kenny Meadows, Stephanoff, and others ; and Mr. Raeburn, in offering it, said that the glowing oriental imagery* of these poems always reminded him strongly of his occidental home, where all was light and sunshine, and the very flowers and foliage expanded into gorgeousness. He had selected that, hoping to hear some portion of it from her lips, that he might listen and forget the English dull November sky without. Eva listened to him with a radiant cheek, and expressed her pleased acceptance with a smile which well repaid him ; but she begged to be excused reading aloud, \u2014 she should be sure to send them all to sleep'. \" I will gladly risk it, Miss Marsh. I have a lurking sus picion it will be with the reading as with the drawing, and I prefer being my own referee; so I trust you will honour my gift and myself by a gracious compliance. I look for no less.\" \"Yes, yes, of course she will,\" cried Mr. Marsh. \"Why should she not? She reads aloud to me readily enough. But perhaps, honey, you would rather Frank read aloud to us?\" \" Oh, yes, that I would ! \" \" Suppose, Eva \" (Frank had never called her Eva before), \" we make a compromise, and induce Miss Wearbank to join us in reading alternately, whilst your father smokes his pipe after dinner, and fancies it a hookah or nargilly.\""], [179, "167 BELOW THE SURFACE. With feigned reluctance, Rhoda, who had come into the room, complied, fully aware of her own elocutionary powers. But she deceived herself in their effect on others. Eva, with all her nervous timidity at the outset, read clearly and unaffectedly, from the heart to the heart. Rhoda read with finish and precision, and the electric spark within kindled in the fire and the passion she pourtrayed, but the pathos she infused into her subject was artificial \u2014 art of the high est order, but still art. Strong emotions had a powerful exponent. Nature's more delicate expression lacked the indefinable charm of sympathetic feeling. This exquisite volume was a treasure to Eva. She read it until every line was printed on her memory; but she read it in secret, kept it under her pillow, or hid away in a drawer. The giver knew nothing of this ; never saw the book about or in her hand; and whether it was prized, or cast aside with the thimbles and gloves, he would have given much to know. Yet from that November day, Rhoda watched the twain with eyes sharpened by jealous fear, and by every art strove not only to gain an ascendency over her in Mr. Raeburn's affections, but to destroy any germs of hope budding in her cousin's heart ; arguing; with herself that the sooner Eva was disenchanted the better for her own future peace. They could not both marry him ; and Eva was not one to break her heart over any man. It was but a repetition of former months passed in this way. Rhoda's passion increased in vehemence with every check ; then she grew angry with Frank Raeburn for his insensibility to the love she had all but offered, and more angry with herself to find her penetration baffled, her skill at fault. Eva all this time was growing pale and tearful \u2014 troubled with frequent headaches \u2014 languid yet excitable, and though Dr. Grove prescribed, and she swallowed his medicine, no improvement was perceptible. Her disease plainly lay beyond the scope of pharmacy."], [180, "168 STUNG TO THE QUICK. CHAPTER XXII. BEHIND THE CURTAINS. The arrow shot with so much tact by Dr. Grove had not only relieved Eva from a depressing sense of inferiority, and opened Mr. Raeburn's eyes to Rhoda's man\u0153uvres, but had warned Rhoda herself to be more wary and subtle. No longer venturing on open innuendo, she contrived to introduce topics in his hearing which induced Eva to advert to Cuth bert or his calling, though to one without a clue to the labyrinth, Eva's remarks appeared the offspring of a heart keenly alive to all which concerned the voyager, and proud of an opportunity to name him. Then she assumed the secret office of mentor, and cau tioned Eva on the misconstruction a man so reserved as Mr. Raeburn was likely to put on her extreme frankness and affability. \" He may suppose you are in love with him, or making advances, my dear; and what a dreadful thing that would be,\" was one of her keenest shafts. Poor Eva, whose innate delicacy took fright at the bare suggestion, conscious of the growing love in her own heart, timidly took herself to task, and fearful lest she uncon sciously betrayed unsought the warmth of her feelings towards Frank, set a careful guard upon her speech and actions, and chilled him by a coldness and reserve as unintelligible as it was unnatural. Rhoda could be artless and winning, languishing or haughty, as suited her best ; but there was always a degree of dignity in her carriage and manner, even in her most familiar moods, so that Eva once more contrasted herself unfavourably with her cousin, and began to wish her father had sent her to school in Brighton, instead of to what Rhoda had designated \"that humdrum parson's.\" Frank Raeburn must have been blind had he not seen Rhoda's desperate attempts to captivate him, and the passion"], [181, "BEHIND THE CURTAINS. 169 that gleamed in her eyes; but though his good breeding pre vented any allusion by word or look to Rhoda's origin, he knew it well, and, instead of laying the flattering unction to his soul that she was desperately in love with himself, reasoned that she was desirous to secure him for the sake of his purse and position. It was not in his nature to be otherwise than courteous to a lady; nor could he withhold the little attentions she sought without appearing ungallant, if not uncivil ; therefore, as Eva became daily more reserved, and withdrew from conversation, cards, or music, Rhpda gradually engrossed the one, and monopolised him during the others, much to his chagrin. Eva's increasing languor and debility were her excuse for declining to sing or play, except on rare occasions, and, from her chair or sofa, she watched him turning over music or joining in duets with heavy heartaches and low sighs. Little could she tell how much he sacrificed at the shrine of politeness, when he strayed from her side, and stood beside the tall upright piano, with the wide room between them, obedient to the wishes of the sweet singer; and so she pined inwardly with the restraint put upon herself, and the grow ing conviction that Frank Raeburn was destined for her cousin. Across this gloom came glimpses of sunshine. Released from his thraldom he would seat himself near to her and speak of things in which he knew her to be interested. He brought a set of chessmen; and on her father's draughtboard began to teach her chess; as they played her coolness and shyness insensibly wore away, the intonation of his voice be came soft and tender, his eyes eloquent with a new light, until she, in a dreamy maze, forgot the moves, while repeating to herself from her precious book, \" And oh, if there be an Elysium on earth, It is this, it is this. But even on this Elysium Rhoda intruded. She became desirous of initiation into the mysteries of chess likewise ; so"], [182, "170 STUNG TO THE QUICK, Eva resigned her partner with a faint sigh, heard and inter preted by Frank nevertheless. Mr. Marsh, loving both the girls, and being by nature as open-hearted as he was open-handed, and as unsuspicious, saw no by-play, and not being either worldly-wise or a match maker, never thought of the consequences of bringing a hand some, intelligent young fellow into almost daily association with two impressionable girls. He had been the friend of Frank's uncle, had known his father, and, being attached to the gentleman himself, lost sight of the possibility that young ladies might become attached in a still greater degree. He smoked his pipe and talked politics, and played draughts, or whist, in which Frank joined; and he listened to the music, or the reading, or went to sleep with a handkerchief over his head, just as unconcern edly as though Mr. Raeburn was one of the family ; and he puzzled himself anxiously about Eva's variable health without the most remote idea of the cause. Mr. Raeburn, at times, hurt by the distant reserve of Eva, so foreign to her nature, yet re-assured by casual words and tones when she was off her guard, longed for an opportunity to break the irritating chain of uncertainty, and but for the constant presence of Rhoda would have decided the question whether Eva was pining for Cuthbert or for himself; a ques tion which tormented him with its persistent recurrence and kept his mind also on the strain. Something told him he was loved; but Rhoda had kept the captain so constantly dinning in his ears, he felt dimly apprehensive he might be mistaken. And during these fluc tuating hopes and fears Christmas came, and Christmas cheer, and Christmas gifts. Among the rest, Mr. Raeburn brought a pair of bracelets for each of the cousins, equally rich, though differing in workmanship, and these he insisted on clasping on under the mistletoe, paying himself with kisses. Rhoda thought he was very inexpert in fastening the jewels"], [183, "BEHIND THE CURTAINS. 171 on Eva's slender wrist, and that his kisses seemed warmer than the occasion warranted; but she did not hear the whis pered words, \"Dear Eva, wear these for my sake,\" or her own bracelets would have burnt her arms. Mr. Marsh, looking on, opened his eyes to the state of affairs for the first time. Then they gleamed and twinkled with an expression of anything but displeasure, as he turned away with a low chuckle, muttering something which sounded like \" young slyboots.\" As for Eva, it would be difficult to determine whether she was more delighted or disconcerted by the words which accompanied Frank Raeburn's gift. He had called her Eva for some little time ; the familiar footing on which he came and went, and was received by Mr. Marsh, seeming to warrant its adoption; but the one impressive word of endearment which prefaced her Christian name was new from him, and sank deep into her soul. In the solitude of her own chamber she unclasped the bracelets from her slender arms and viewed them with swimming eyes. Surely he would not have asked her to wear them for his sake unless she were indeed \"dear\" to him. Oh ! what a delicious thought was that ! But what if these were only complimentary words, and he had said as much to her cousin ? A sigh followed the thought, and the worn look, so common to her of late, settled on her young face; but it passed away as Frank's tones recurred to her memory, and she unclosed her priceless \" Lalla Rookh \" to read in bed for half an hour, and dream of the giver afterwards. Under the enchanted influence of the book and bracelets she brightened so wonderfully, that Dr. Grove, with comical look and half closed eyes, asked a few days later \u2014 \" Have you taken any medicine besides that of my prescrip tion, Miss Eva?\" \" No, doctor, of course not! \" was the surprised answer. \" Are you quite sure, young lady ? \" \" Quite sure ; but why do you ask ? \""], [184, "172 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \"Why? Because you are so suddenly better; and as I had not changed your medicine, I thought perhaps you might have changed physician and medicine both.\" \"Did you prescribe mistletoe, doctor?\" slyly enquired Mr. Marsh, who had been listening. \"Ah, that's it, is it? spirit of mistletoe, to be sure; won derful medicine that, administered by the proper practitioner ! All depends on that ; doesn't it, Miss Eva ? \" \"I protest, papa, it's too bad, both of you and the doctor.\" And the confused young lady ran out of the way of their banter with her cheeks all aglow, much to the perplexity of Rhoda, who met her on the stairs. After dusk the following day \u2014 New Year's Eve \u2014 Eva sat by the fire embroidering mottoes on perforated card for book marks, with a volume bv her side partly filled with them. They were intended as trifling New Year's gifts. The one in which she was putting the finishing stitches bore the motto, \"Je vous aime;\" for whom intended it would be difficult to say; perhaps she did not know herself. The heavy crimson curtains were drawn close across the bay window, and Rhoda, as was her wont at twilight, stood behind them, looking out on the stream and the sky, revolv ing the ceaseless question in her mind, \" Does he love me, or does he not ? \" Suddenly the door opened. Mr. Raeburn stepped in, and came briskly forward to exchange greetings with Eva. \"Dear Eva. lam so delighted to find you alone!\" Eva blushed. The listener held her breath. \" But where is Miss Wearbank?\" \"I thought she was in the room,\" said Eva, in confusion, looking round ; \" she must have gone to change her dress ; she has been out.\" \" If you have no objection, I will seat myself beside you. This is the warmest corner of the room,\" said he, drawing a chair near as he spoke. Of course, though Eva made no reply, she had no objection. After a few remarks"], [185, "BEHIND THE CURTAINS. 173 about the weather, the season, &c, he inquired, lightly \u2014 \" What may you be employing your dainty fingers on ? \" \" Only book-marks for New Year's gifts.\" He took up the one she had just completed, read the motto, aloud, \"Je vous aime,\" and then, with an entire change of man ner, asked in low but earnest tones \u2014 \" Eva, will you give this to me ? \" Taken by surprise, though she had half hoped this in her secret heart, unwilling to be the first to confess \u2014 afraid to grant\u2014 ashamed to deny \u2014 she paused \u2014 blushed \u2014 hesitated \u2014 thought of Rhoda \u2014 and that gave a tinge of coquetry to her reply. \" I don't know \u2014 I \u2014 will not this do as well? \" and she ten dered \"Friendship's Offering.\" \"I will give you this, or this, ' Die gift of a friend,' or this, ' Pensez a moi.' Will not one of these please you ? \" He shook his head. \" This, Eva, this; will you give me this?\" She hesitated, half inclined to comply,then thought of Rhoda, and jealousy withheld the boon; but a bright inspiration glanced through her mind. \" There are a number more in this book. See if there is no other you would like as well, Mr. Raeburn,\" and her voice trembled strangely as she spoke. \"No other; I desire no other,\" yet mechanically he turned over the leaves. At length, with a slight start, he snatched one from the book, which dropped unheeded to the floor, and exclaimed with rapturous delight \u2014 \" Yes, Eva, I will take this one, with your permission. Dear, dear Eva, may I have this ? \" And he pressed the bit of card-board to his lips. It bore the two words, \"Eva Marsh.\" \"You may have both,\" was her reply, as she buried her burning face in her hands. \" God bless you, my own darling Eva! you have made me happy beyond expression. Look up, my own love, and con firm my joy.\" And as he held her to his manly breast, he"], [186, "174 STUNG TO THE QUICK. removed the hands which hid her tearful eyes, and kissed her fondly. \"Speak to me, Eva, love, if but one word.\" \"Oh Frank! dear Frank! I do love you.\" And now the drooping head sank on his shoulder, and she wept in fulness of heart and happiness. And there they sat together for some time, absorbed in thought, with now and then a whispered word of endearment, a closer pressure of the form he held, or a gentle kiss on her warm lips to tell how blest they were. And what of Rhoda ? did she faint, or scream ? Neither: she clutched the window-frame for support, but soon grew rigid as a statue. She heard all \u2014 all \u2014 low as were the tones \u2014 heard with agony of spirit indescribable, yet could not stir. At last, rousing herself by a strong effort, she glided stealthily from the room, and was seen no more that night. Frank thought he heard the door open, but turning round and observing nothing, concluded he was mistaken. \" Do you remember running into my arms, Eva ? Do you know I longed to clasp you to me then, for I had fallen in love with you before that ? \" \"Why, Prank, you must be dreaming. ': \" A very pleasant dream, then. I saw you first at Leam side, and lost my heart at once. I should have revealed my love long ago, but could never find you alone. Rhoda was like a duenna, ever by your side. I did not dare to hope for this glorious opportunity when Martin let me in to-night. My Eva\u2014 mine.\" Shortly he resumed, \" You have your bracelets on. Let me show you something.\" So saying he unclasped one from her arm, touched a spring at the back of a small cameo, and revealed his own miniature exquisitely drawn. \"Oh, Frank! how beautiful. I shall, indeed, wear it for your sake now.\" \"I have hitherto felt a secret joy, Eva, that you wore it, even though unconsciously.\""], [187, "BEHIND THE CURTAINS. 175 And then he told her how apprehensive he had been lest she had given her heart into the keeping of Cuthbert, how much pain the supposition had caused him, how often he had determined to know the worst, and been defeated by the constant presence of her cousin, and how a casual remark of Dr. Grove's had partially dissipated his jealous feast, and made him hopeful for himself. This confession was interrupted at the outset by a merry little laugh from Eva, who evidently regarded the bare sup position of her being in love with Cuthbert as something irresistibly comical. He was soon in possession of the knowledge that the captain was engaged to Mary Reed; information accompanied by a very flattering description of Mary herself, ending with, \" She is as industrious, steady, and amiable a girl as you could meet with anywhere.\" \" I wonder if she is as amiable as you are generous in your praise, Eva,\" exclaimed he, with a look of admiration. \"Generous! there is no generosity about it; I only spoke the truth.\" \" Young ladies are not always generous enough to speak truth of each other, darling.\" \"Ah, Frank, now you are ungenerous.\" \" Am I ? Well, we will not dispute about it : perhaps I am.\" And with a smile he pressed closer the little hand resting so confidingly in his. Thus on that New Year's eve they sat together until Mr. Marsh came in, when Mr. Raeburn said that he wished to solicit from Mr. Marsh a New Year's gift of his ow selection. \" I make no blind promises, young gentleman ; but I am not very inaccessible. Do you know what he wants, Eva?\" \" Nay, Mr. Marsh, do not ask her. It is your Eva I would beg of you.\" \" I thought as much. I saw owhat was coming under th mistletoe on Christmas Eve. Hwever, I know no one I woulde sooner trust my treasure with. Frank, I love you as my own son."], [188, "176 STUNG TO THE QUICK. Now, come and kiss me, puss, and say, 'Thank you, papa.' \" And he was thanked. Rhoda did not make her appearance next morning. She was ill, and kept in her room, but would suffer no one near her. She had a nervous headache and must be quiet, she said. Quiet ! Her brain was in a ferment. All night she had paced about her chamber in frantic agony, with both hands clasped behind her head, chafing like a caged lion, and mut tering thoughts that lashed her wild rage to frenzy. \" And this is the end of all my passionate love, all my wild hopes of happiness with him ! For this I have played the doting fool, and thought he might be won. What can that baby know of love for such a man ? What is her love to mine ? The rill to the mountain torrent. And he, the traitor, to wear that icy mask so long \u2014 to hide the panting heart be neath ! And I, too, must wear a mask henceforth ; must sun mvself in the light of their love; must greet them cheerily as though I rejoiced with them. Rejoice ! Ay, as the tigress robbed of her young. And how shall I compel myself to watch their wooing ? Watch it ! I who would give my very soul to win the love he has thrown away on a mere baby ! If I do, it will be to mar the wooing. Let them exult in their new-found bliss. Did not Solomon say that jealousy was cruel as the grave? They laugh best who laugh last, and I will crush their laughter. Ay, ay, Frank Raeburn, wear your darling Eva in your heart of hearts ! Your Eva, who has name, and fortune, and a pedigree to mate with ! Betroth her \u2014 marry her \u2014 but I will sunder you. I \u2014 I, the 'beggar's brat,' the 'waif of the Wear.'\" And so she raved and chafed until she was exhausted, and then flung herself, dressed as she was, across her couch, and slept heavily. There were dark circles around her eyes, when she came down to breakfast, that second of January, the result, it was presumed, of the intense headache; of the more intense heart ache no one had a suspicion. Her smile, it is true, was"], [189, "THE CAPTAIN OF THE \"POLLY.\" 177 somewhat languid; but when acquainted by Mr. Marsh with Eva's betrothal to the \"bumpkin,\" her congratulations were as warm as though she meant them, and her surprise as manifest as though the crimson curtains had never concealed a listener. CHAPTER XXIII. THE CAPTAIN OF THE \"POLLY.\" The captain of a sailing vessel has plenty of time for reflec tion in the course of a long voyage ; and as Cuthbert sat in his cabin or paced the deck watching his barque rise or dip with the heavy rollers of the broad Atlantic, memory was busy in his brain, and conscience stalked beside him like his shadow. King of his craft, he was isolated above the companion ship of his subjects. His crew might laugh and sing and jest among themselves to wile away the time or dismiss obtrusive thought; but there was no such Lethe for him, especially as he had no undue leaning towards the oblivion of the rum-cask. In his cabin hung a miniature of Mary, painted two or three years before by a travelling artist, of which the most to be said was that it resembled the original. This he had been wont to contemplate in all his softer moods with as much of veneration as love. As he had often told Mary, that picture had been a restraint upon him in many an hour of temptation, a comfort in many a trial. If a skulking lubber amongst his crew urged him to a fit of unmanly passion ; if a sense of irresponsibility left him free to be harsh, overbearing, unjust, or cruel, and a less scrupulous mate at his elbow suggested that a little wrong might be a great right, or that it was his duty to punish, a glance at x"], [190, "178 STUNG TO THE QUICK. the mild face on his wooden wall would remind him that it was his duty to do unto others as he would they should do unto him; and that reflection served to soften many a tone of asperity, many an act of reprisal. Little as the seamen under his command knew it, they, in a great measure, owed to that ill-painted portrait the kind ness and consideration with which they were treated. A temper, naturally hasty and impetuous, roughing it at sea amongst men whose mildest form of speech was an oath, under a captain who made kicks serve him for words, might have developed into coarseness and ferocity, and, but for the influence of the gentle girl who had been more than a sister to him, would have done so. Mary's childish sympathy, consolations, and counsels, had upheld the sinking heart of the boy, and as she grew to woman hood their influence deepened. She had served to preserve his humanity, and when he emerged from the last gradation of obedience and stepped on the deck of the \"Polly,\" mas ter of barque and crew, he carried that picture with him as an amulet, unwittingly. In the bustle of harbour duties, the stowage of cargo late on board, the clearing out from the labyrinth of vessels already in dock or coming into port, whilst weathering the rough gales which swept the North Sea, keeping captain and crew alike on the alert, whilst meeting and breasting the Channel currents, he had little leisure to spare for home thought, and if the picture caught his eye by chance, he turned away from that which seemed to look a reproach. Once in the open ocean, every breeze that shook the sails or murmured through the shrouds seemed to repeat the word \" uncanny.\" The black eyes whose witchery haunted him on shore dimmed and faded out before the mild hazel ones limned there before him. Gradually repentance came, and the next vessel they spoke bore a line of peni tence to his placable Mary. This was followed by a longer letter from Bahia."], [191, "THE CAPTAIN OF THE \" POLLY. 179 The former went down to the \" yellow-haired mermaidens under the sea,\" as many a letter of love or duty had gone before; but the latter reached Sunderland safely, and pre pared Mary to receive her truant with a smile of welcome, when he followed it, a month or six weeks later. In the interim, and shortly after Cuthbert's departure, while the tears still flowed down Mary's cheeks, at the thought of their angry parting, of a quarrel which wind and wave might make eternal, ere the gray sails of the \" Polly \" were lost to her straining sight, watching the distant horizon from the South pier, the postman delivered to the Rev. James Reed, in her absence, a letter, of which the following is a tran script: \u2014 \" Reverend Sir, \" In the purest of motives I write to warn you of that two-faced scoundrel, Cuthbert Hesketh, who is only following your daughter to make a fool of her. \" I think it only my duty to let you know that he is dangling after Mr. Marsh's niece, and that Mr. Marsh, who ought to be ashamed of himself, encourages him. Being a parent myself, I can feel for you, and therefore I put you on your guard against a double-dealer, leaving it to you to break the news to your poor daughter, who, I trust, is not too infatuated to show a becoming spirit. \u2014 Yours, \"A Well- Wisher.\" Mr. Reed, congratulating himself on Mary's temporary absence, as there was no fire, lit a taper he kept in his study to seal his letters by, and set fire to the precious document, leaving it to bum out within the fender, mutter ing to himself, \" The contemptible mischief-maker. I should like to wring her ears, whoever she is.\" Though a mild and forbearing clergyman, a very chari table and excellent sample of the cloth, he was a man capable"], [192, "180 STUNG TO THE QUICK. of human indignation and fatherly feeling.; and was not the wish natural? ' Beyond that little ebullition of just resentment, nothing more was heard of the anonymous scrawl, the joint produc tion of Coulson and Hesketh genius. The shaft, therefore, fell short of the mark, and Mary, grieving for Cuthbert, had not the double mortification of believing herself slighted for another. Even Eva, in her occasional letters, never adverted to his attention to her cousin, not thinking it anything serious, and not being given to mischief-making. So when Cuthbert came back, anxious to obtain forgive ness from Mary for his hasty temper (he said nothing of inconstancy), he had not to sue in vain; she was too blest in his return to criticise the bungling apology he made for absenting himself in what he termed \"his foolish pique.\" Once more he sat in the drowsy parlour whenever he could be spared from the quay, and for three or four weeks all went on smoothly. Knowing his own weakness, he avoided Durham, and urged Mary to consent to be his wife before he went to sea again. He was willing to leave her behind while she provided a suitable voyaging outfit against his return in the spring, when he hoped she would be prepared to sail with him. Thus, though the \" Polly \" had been in port two or three weeks, nothing had been heard or seen of Cuthbert until the afternoon of the third of January, when Mr. Raeburn met him at the Hat-and-Feathers in the Market Place, whither each of them had gone to fortify himself against the intense cold with grog, or hot brandy and water, accord ing to peculiar taste. It appeared that Cuthbert, taking Mary's half-assent for a whole one, had come over at once to acquaint his father with his intended marriage, and to procure the necessary licence. That important document had not been in his pocket-"], [193, "THE CAPTAIN OF THE \"POLLY.\" 181 book half an hour when he had the misfortune to meet Mr. Raeburn, and in the gladness of his heart revealed the na ture of his business in Durham. Thus doubly relieved of all fear of the captain as a rival, Frank's heart was opened to a similar confidence. Anxious to atone for his own suspicions, he acquainted Cuthbert with his recent engagement, and begged he would accompany him to Mr. Marsh's to pay his respects to the bride-elect. Cuthbert endeavoured to excuse himself, but Mr. Raeburn would take no denial, and the two walked thither arm-in-arm, with widely different feelings; the one elated with confidence and hope, the other lost in doubt and fear. Cuthbert had a kind, good heart, but. a very weak one, and his head was as weak; then he was impulsive, and, though his principles were sound, he had very little strength to resist temptation. Eva bounded towards them on their entrance, giving a hand to each with a gleeful exclamation of surprise. Rhoda (still suffering from the gnawing of jealousy and angry headache) raised herself languidly from a pile of cushions, moved the fire-screen from before her, and also came forward to meet them. Skilled as Rhoda was in the art of mastering emotion, a visible flush of pleasure overspread her face as Cuthbert ad vanced confusedly to shake the hand she proffered, a flush she made no effort to suppress, but seconded with such a lingering look of reproach that Cuthbert's eyes fell before it, and he felt himself very much of a deceiver. Neither the knock at the door, nor the eager welcome, had roused Mr. Marsh, who was dozing by the fire with his long legs stretched out, and his head thrown back under cover of a China silk handkerchief, the gift of the seafaring friend then in the room. But Eva, with a kiss on the sleeper's forehead, and a pat or two on his whiskered cheek, wakened him. After a yawn and a stretch he became conscious of the visitor's presence. \" Why, Cuthbert, lad, is that you ? I'm heartily glad to"], [194, "182 STUNG TO THE QUICK. see you. We thought you were having a nap on an oyster bed, you were so long in making your appearance. And how are all our good friends in Sunderland ? \" said he, the grasp of the hand expressing as much heartiness as his words. \"Oh, thank you, cheery! That is, if you mean the Reeds.\" \"Of course I mean the Reeds. What other friends could a Marsh so fitly inquire for ? Why, the only song I could ever sing was, ' Green grow the rushes oh ! ' and that I rushed into con amore.\" \" From a love of the rushes or the lasses ? \" asked Mr. Raeburn, quietly. \" Umph. Perhaps a little of both, Frank. But Cuthbert here contrived to love a Reed and a lass at the same time, and will marry the two some day without committing bigamy.\" Notwithstanding his bronzed complexion, Cuthbert's colour came and went during this little play upon words, flushing up into deep red at the last allusion, which, being made before Rhoda, not only smote his conscience, but made him feel remarkably foolish and look so too. So palpable was his confusion, that even Mr. Marsh (not the most clear-sighted in such matters) observing it, exclaimed, \" Why, Cuthbert, you are blushing like a young girl. I never knew you were bashful before. You surely have not got a blackamoor wife anywhere that you startle so at the word bigamy, or a China woman with useless feet and finger-nails a foot long, eh ? \" \" Not I, Mr. Marsh ; I never sailed on that tack \u2014 but \" \"Your matrimonial pun touched the captain nearer home than Africa or China, my dear sir. I hope I break no confi dence in revealing that he came to Durham for a licence to marry both the Reed and the lass you referred to.\" \"Oh! Cuthbert, is that true? I'm so glad! I'm so glad!\" cried Eva, clasping her hands with delight. \" Give me your hand, my boy. I am proud to hear the news. But have you heard our news? There, Eva is blushing now!\""], [195, "183 THE CAPTAIN OF THE \"POLLY.\" Rhoda had returned to her cushions, and on the first men tion of the Reeds so adjusted the convenient fire-screen as to hide her face, already half-buried in the pillows, from all but Cuthbert, who stood like a culprit, near enough to catch her glances of mingled indignation and pain. There, without joining in jest or congratulations, she reclined, grasping her hair in the hand beneath her head, alternately biting her lips or setting her teeth as annoyance gave place to resolution; and thus ran the commentary of her thoughts on the conversation : \u2014 \"Our good friends in Sunderland \u2014 Reeds, of course \u2014 I wish I could sunder them; they are no friends of mine \u2014 I owe them no friendship \u2014 there's no love lost between Mary Reed and me. I hate the girl's mild, meek face \u2014 her amiability is dinned in my ears for ever ; amiability, indeed ! insipidity they should say. Marry her some day \u2014 not if I can help it. Ah! Mr. Marsh, I know the secret of the inconstant captain's blushes better than you. Mary Reed's reign is over. \u2014 What! come for a licence to marry her \u2014 marry her. Surely I have not heard aright ! The deceitful wretch \u2014 well may he change colour and look like a fool, as he is ; but he shall not marry her, I am resolved. I choose to have him at my feet, and I will, while it suits me, even if Mary break her heart about him ; but she'll not do that; there never was a throb in her heart strong and wild enough to break it. She may pine and mope, and die an old maid, but never of a broken heart; only fierce, pas sionate natures like mine break hearts \u2014 their own, or others. Ah! Eva's wedding now. My God! this is too much \u2014 this is torture \u2014 to sit and hear again the story of the love I would give life and fame to win. Oh ! Frank, Frank, would I could find the key to your heart \u2014 would I could move you with half the ease I can wind that fool of a captain round my finger. But I must not let him slip through my fingers whilst I lie here. I must rouse, spite of headache or heartache, or I shall miss my first item of revenge against the malignant Heskeths.\""], [196, "184 STUNG TO THE QUICK. She did rouse, summoned Cuthbert to a seat beside her pillowed chair, and whilst others believed her congratulating him on his approaching marriage, coolly upbraided him with inconstancy to herself in tones too low to reach any ear but that for which they were intended. The humming-bird and rattle-snake typify Rhoda and Cuthbert exactly. No sooner did she fix her lustrous eyes on him than their fascination held him like a spell. Able to command a ship, yet he was not able to command him self, and Rhoda soon held him in firmer bonds than before. Not that he forgot Mary, but the memory became a re proach to him, and he strove to shut it out. So skilfully did Rhoda beguile him, that when he returned to Old Elvet late that night, he went with the impression that Rhoda's illness had been through grief at his apparent estrangement, and that her love for him was so excessive she would die if he did not return it. CHAPTER XXIV. DRIFTING FROM THE SHORE. Here was a pretty dilemma for a brave sea-captain ! Not Hercules spinning for Omphale felt himself more con temptible than did Cuthbert, as he tossed on his bed at night, reasoning and debating with himself to no purpose. He was entangled in a web which he believed to be of his own weaving, as so in part it was; for though Rhoda had used an invisible shuttle and plied it dexterously, she had only worked up the material his own weakness and irre solution had supplied. He had surrendered when he should have fought, loitered when he should have fled, spoken that in his folly he could not recall in his wisdom, and the result was a state of bewilderment which defies expression."], [197, "185 DRIFTING FROM THE SHORE. What could he do? He was bound in love and honour to Mary, almost equally bound to Rhoda, and what was worse, both were deeply in love with him. Mary was good, and pure, and kind \u2014 too kind for a fickle, senseless fellow like himself; but then Rhoda was so beau tiful, so loving, her wondrous eyes penetrated his very soul. What could he do ? He could not leave her to die through his desertion; and yet how could he be false to Mary \u2014 Mary who had been so forgiving ? Perhaps Rhoda was right after all, and Mary had no depth of feeling. It might be so, and Rhoda was all love and devotion. Well, he would not think, he would go to sleep and reflect in the morning. Go to sleep he did not, and at the breakfast table next morning kind Aunt Dorothy, who presided {vice Mrs. Hes keth, surperseded, and in her chamber), was quite concerned at his jaded appearance. \" Cuthbert, my dear bairn, how ill you look ; is anything wrong with you \u2014 are you not well ? \" inquired she, anxiously. \" No, thank you, dear aunt, only I cannot sleep well out of a hammock, and last night I was more restless than usual.\" \" Dear me, what a fuss about nothing. I never heard you complain of your bed before; but then, to be sure, there was no one to encourage your senseless whimsies until now,\" jerked out Lucy, with a toss of her head, a curl of her always turned-up nose, and a glance of supreme scorn at Miss Dorothy. \"You mean, Lucy,\" said Mr. Hesketh, stoutly, \" that until your Aunt Dorothy came there was no one with womanly sympathy or observation in the house.\" \" I meant no such thing. I meant what I said. A pretty thing, indeed, if a good feather-bed won't serve our dainty sailor to sleep on ; and it is a shame he should be upheld in his whims.\" \"Hold your saucy tongue, miss, and wait until you are spoken to,\" exclaimed Cuthbert, angrily, \"or I'll give you a"], [198, "186 STUNG TO THE QUICK. good shaking. I've put up with your impudence quite long enough.\" \" I shan't ! and if you come near me I'll scratch your face, and then how will you look ? Your precious Miss Rhoda, I suppose, has jilted you for Edwin Grove, and that has soured your very sweet temper.\" \" I think, bairns, a little sweet temper would make break fast more digestible for all of us. Besides, nothing destroys beauty like ill-humour. A cross face like that will drive all your beaus away, Lucy. Cuthbert, I thought you had more manliness than to threaten your sister,\" were the expostu latory words of Aunt Dorothy, addressing each in turn. \"Look here, Dorothy,\" put in Mr. Hesketh by way of explanation, \"that boy has been badgered and baited and worried by Lucy and her mother till my patience has been worn out, and no wonder if he has lost his. But if Lucy says another word, I'll turn her out of the room and lock her up again.\" Lucy had been locked up twice since her father brought his sister home, and knowing that even her mother was powerless to uphold her, wisely succumbed to the strong hand, not a little influenced, moreover, by her aunt's hint concerning beauty and beaus. So she held her peace after her father's threat, if we except a few angry mutterings like the distant rumble of a spent thunderstorm. \" Well, Aunt Dorothy, I own it was lubberly to speak as I did, and I am sorry I so degraded myself. But a sleep less night does not improve a hot temper, and that's a fact. You are a good soul, Aunt Dolly, that you are; and if I had only had your beaming face at my father's table, and your kindly counsels, instead of the cross looks, harsh words, and hard blows that fell to my lot as a boy in this very house, I should have been a better man than I am now; yes, and steered clear of shoals I am like to be stranded on.\" \"Do you think so, bairn? Well, I wish for your sake I had been here ; but your mother never invited me, and duty"], [199, "187 DRIFTING FROM THE SHORE. kept me by your grandmother's side while she lived. How ever, considering the life you have led, I am very well satis fied with you on the whole, and I feel very proud of my nephew.\" \"That's compliment for compliment, Dolly,\" laughed Mr. Hesketh. \" Aye, aye, and here's a kiss for your good opinion, dear Aunt Dorothy,\" and Cuthbert darted forward, dragging the cloth after him, at the imminent risk of overturning the breakfast ware, to fling his arms about his aunt's neck, and kiss her chubby face with hearty good will. \"There, there, Cuthbert, lad; you are rumpling my cap.\" \" Never mind, aunt ; I would buy you half-a-dozen caps for the pleasure of kissing your kind old lips. Oh, I've something upstairs that will just suit you ! \" and off he set, almost upsetting in his haste Mrs. Hesketh, who stood in the doorway, with expressively folded hands. \"Ah, Mr. Hesketh, that is just like your son; he is remark ably ready with his kisses. He never kissed me in his life.\" \" Did you ever kiss him, Maria, even as a boy ? Did you ever give him a kind word?\" asked Mr. Hesketh, sadly and soberly. \" Well, I don't suppose I ever did kiss him ; he didn't deserve it. And when did your son ever bring me a present like that, I should like to know ? \" continued she, supercili ously, as Cuthbert, re-entering the room, unfolded a valuable Canton-crape shawl, and placed it round the shoulders of his gratified relative with a look of admiration. At the remark he turned round, and answering his step mother, said quietly, \" I brought that shawl home from China when I brought the handkerchiefs for father and Mr. Marsh. It was intended for you, Mrs. Hesketh, as my father knows, and I also brought a second for my sister; but I was met at the very door with such unkind and ungracious words that I thought better of it, and kept the shawls in my kit until now. I was not disposed to buy the civility common"], [200, "188 STUNG TO THE QUICK. humanity should have prompted. However, as I have this time found you disposed to be somewhat more civil than heretofore, I will bring you down the shawl I meant for Lucy. If not quite as valuable as Aunt Dorothy's, it is at least worth having, and may teach you to estimate me differently in the future. Kind words travel fast and far, but ill ones sink deepest into the heart.\" \" Only into evil hearts, prepared to receive them, bairn ; ill words pass from a kind heart like the breath from a mirror. Remember that, Cuthbert.\" \"That I will, aunt, for the sake of the kind voice that said it,\" cried Cuthbert, as he went off for the second shawl. Both Mrs. Hesketh and Lucy looked very foolish when he returned with a shawl differing only from the other in its embroidery. The one was worked in coloured silks, and so deftly wrought, that no eye could detect a joining or dis tinguish right side from wrong, whilst the colours were remarkably pure and brilliant. The second was simply a cream white like the body of the other, and Mrs. Hesketh, fond of fine colours, looked longingly at the prize she had lost, though she was gracious enough to thank him, and utter some sort of an apology. Miss Dorothy, detecting the vagrant look, volunteered to exchange shawls with Mrs. Hesketh, saying that the white one would best suit an old woman. Mrs. Hesketh would have accepted her offer, but Cuthbert negatived it at once, giving his aunt all credit for good nature, but maintaining his own right of presentation. Mrs. Hesketh and Lucy learnt a lesson that day they were not likely to forget, since it touched one of their weak points \u2014 love of dress; a lesson deepened when, some months later, a gentleman staying in Scarborough at the same time with themselves accosted Miss Dorothy, and offered to pur chase her shawl at any price she would name. He was a manufacturer of brocades by the Jacquard loom, from Manchester, and wished to make experiments on the"], [201, "DRIFTING FROM THE SHORE. 189 dyes and method of embroidery. \u00a350, <\u00a36o, ,\u00a370, ,\u00a380 were offered ; and when the old lady respectfully, but firmly, told him it was a gift which no money could purchase, he went away quite chagrined, his commercial mind not understanding a higher claim than money. But this is in advance of the story, which must drift away from the shawl and shawl-wearers, to the shawl-giver and the wily woman who was bent on his destruction. Cuthbert had half resolved to steer clear of South Street, but the little episode of the shawls having lost him his train, and there being no other until the afternoon (railways in 1840 were not much beyond their infancy), he walked with his father to the office, and thence sauntered through the Bailey and Palace Green to the walks by the Wear, meditating, as he went, and tormenting himself over his con duct and its consequences. From her chamber window Rhoda had seen him emerge from the gothic gateway opposite, and stand hesitating which path he should take, then, without crossing the bridge, direct his steps towards the Count's Cottage. It was evident he intended to avoid her; but she had determined he should not; so, slipping on her bonnet and a cardinal cape of grey squirrel, with muff to match, the hurried out of the house and over the Prebend's Bridge, slackening her speed only when she reached the opposite bank of the river. Then her pace subsided to a sharp brisk step, such as any energetic woman would tread over frosty ground with, to keep the blood in circulation and the mind active also. As may be anticipated, she soon overtook Cuthbert, as he was sauntering listlessly along, with the rattan in his hand, striking down here and there a pendant icicle, or a solitary leaf flut tering on a bare bough, or flicking the hoar frost from the grass which fringed his path with fairy spears, less threatening in their myriads than the one living foe tracking his steps with a smiling face and pitiless heart. A heart, aye, colder than the frost of winter, for that might thaw, and her heart would not."], [202, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 190 Every frosty rime or flake of snow in each succeeding winter fell upon that heart and chilled it. It was in winter she was left to the elements, left to the mercy of the world, a waif on the banks of that very river, to be fostered by charity and taunted with her birth and dependence when least prepared for the shock. Did she not see the curled lips and hear the whispered words of dames and damsels whose birth and breeding were unimpeachable, as they passed her at church or in the street, at fete or regatta, as though she were of other earth than they ? Did not the very servants execute her commands with an obedience differing from the obedience with which Eva's lightest wishes were anticipated ? Had not those domestics (or two of them) seen her in her rags, a pinched and frozen atomy, and did they not look as if they remembered it well ? What had the world done for her but cultivate a sensibility to pain and ignominy ? Had she not been nurtured in a belief that honour and competence, nay, luxury, were her birthright, only to be told at last that she was beggar-born, base-born, and had no claim on kin or kindness? Had it not been more cruel than kind to pamper her into a keener sense of wrong and shame? She owed nothing to the world but scorn, and she would pay it in kind. Even the love, the absorbing pas sionate love she had cherished for the one idol of her soul, had been thrust aside as worthless, unregarded, unrecognised, and this was the last drop to her brimming cup of bitter ness. Not even Frank Raeburn could stoop to love the nameless offspring of a beggar, a suicide ; she knew his pride alone had kept him from her \u2014 feared it from the first \u2014 yet madly dared to hope. He had set her aside for a baby better-born. Yes, the baby who had slept in the same cradle with her had stolen him from her, and if she failed to sever them would pillow her head upon his breast for all the years to come. With thoughts like these, one-sided, distorted, and fallacious, did Rhoda fill her solitude, and crush out every feeling of"], [203, "DRIFTING FROM THE SHORE. 191 kindliness or gratitude. There was a volcano in her heart, but it was a volcano under ice \u2014 Hecla or Chimborazo. As one of the family which had dealt the first blow to her peace, Cuthbert was marked for her prey; not that she meant to shoot, or stab, or poison him ; those were the acts of inferior natures. She struck at his peace of mind, his self respect, and through him she would aim her first blow at others. She had yet to learn that no pain she could inflict on Cuthbert would trouble Mrs. Hesketh or Lucy in the least, except it might be as dealt by her. Long before Cuthbert reached the thick planting round the Count's Cottage, Rhoda's step behind him arrested his attention; he knew the firm, proud footfall, and his heart bounded at the well-known sound. What should he do now ? He could not turn and run like a coward from a woman. He had not sought the meeting, and fate itself declared against him. He would arm himself against her. Vain his armoury. She came prepared to complete her conquest, and he was ill-prepared to resist it. The outworks had given way long ago, and only the citadel remained to be vanquished. She professed herself amazed to see him there; had feared he was on his way to Sunderland without a thought for her. She had been stifled by the atmosphere indoors, and came out to see if the cold fresh air would relieve her aching head. And then she sighed as if the case was hopeless. Besides, she longed to be alone; it was so terrible to sit and chatter amongst thoughtless and happy people, wearing a mask to hide her own emotions while her very heart was breaking, and those around knew nothing of her trouble. There was truth in her tone and plea; the sentiment was genuine; but the application \u2014 what of the application? Cuthbert standing there before her like a criminal, measur ing his rattan with hands and eyes, not daring to look up into hers began to apologise, and blundered out something not very intelligible, but very much to the purpose (Rhoda's"], [204, "192 STUNG TO THE QUICK. purpose), of his regret and sorrow that any inadvertent act or word of his should have given a moment's uneasiness to her, of the sleepless night he had spent, and how miserable he was at the thought of her pain. That he would will ingly die to serve her. And in the end he riveted his own chains yet more hopelessly. There is no question he was a consummate fool to be so easily entrapped, but no man is wise who makes love to two women at once, and he was by no means either the first seaman or the first landsman who has done that silly thing, wavering between faiths, singeing at two fires. He did not return to Sunderland that day \u2014 nor the next \u2014 nor the next. He did not write to Mary to excuse his absence, not being an apt hand at equivocation, nor having a palatable truth to assign. Besides, he resolved each night that he would surely depart next morning. Next morning found him loitering in South Street more irresolute than ever. A hint from his shipowners at length stimulated his move ments, and he unwillingly tore himself from Rhoda. She had, however, so contrived that at his departure he begged she would write to him, and she, with feigned reluc tance, consented; but she hated the name of \"Rhoda,\" and would only be written to as \" Eve,\" a name as near to her dear cousin's sweet one as she could think. He was to address his letters to the post-office for E. M., and she would call for them. She knew her uncle had other views for her, and dared not meet his displeasure if their love were avowed openly. Those other views clearly referred to Edwin Grove, whose palpable attentions had excited Cuthbert's chagrin months before, and Dr. Grove's intimacy with Mr. Marsh decidedly favoured the supposition of a desire to cement that friendship by closer union. A clandestine correspondence, under existing circumstances, suited Cuthbert admirably."], [205, "DRIFTING FROM THE SHORE. 193 He was not so satisfied with his own conduct, or so as sured of his ultimate purpose, as to dare proclaim openly that which would not bear scrutiny in broad daylight. Of this Rhoda was fully sensible, and when she suggested secrecy did it on very sure grounds and on far-reaching calculations. Ashamed and afraid to meet Mary*, on reaching Sunder land he avoided her very neighbourhood, keeping close to the docks and his dock duties, at once to atone for lost time and stifle unwelcome reflection \u2014 the latter a task by no means easy. Once more he sailed without a farewell to his true-hearted, ill-used Mary, and this time without even the shallow pretext of a quarrel. For lack of more accurate information, Mary Reed and her parents ascribed the coldness and sudden change in Cuthbert to the evil influence of his own family ; so true it is that the odium of one ill deed brings after it a train of others on suspicion. Neither the curate nor his wife were inclined to overlook the fickle captain's latest insult \u2014 an insult too gross for palliation. Their animadversions on Cuthbert's want of manliness and principle made Mary's heart ache with a sorer pain than did his desertion. She patched up imaginary excuses to allay her father's displeasure, without in the least alleviating her own suffering, and with a deepening shade upon her eyelids went about her daily duties sadly and soberly. And then the anonymous letter recurred to the Rev. James Reed, who began to think there might be some latent truth in the ill-natured warning. 0"], [206, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 194 CHAPTER XXV THE GREY TOWER, Time wore on : Rhoda watching and scheming by hint or innuendo to sow dissension between Eva and Frank Raeburn; but their love and confidence were so perfect, her attempts were ineffectual; besides, she was compelled to be guarded, lest she should inculpate herself. Many were her endeavours to nurse in Eva's heart a suspicion of the motives which took him to the metropolis so frequently, and on one of these she murmured, as if thinking aloud \u2014 \" I wonder whatever he goes to London for \u2014 so often, too \u2014 it's very mysterious; there is something remarkably peculiar about it. I must confess I do not understand it.\" \"What don't you understand, Rhoda, dear?\" \"Oh, nothing \u2014 nothing particular.\" \"Now, I'm sure it must be something; you seemed in such deep thought about it. And I heard you say something was mysterious ; what was it ? \" urged Eva, looking up from her work at Rhoda, who stood leaning against the window frame, apparently wrapped in meditation. \" How very inquisitive you are, Eva, to-day. Well, if you must know, I was wondering whatever Mr. Raeburn goes to London so frequently for, and remains so long \u2014 always a week or two.\" \" Oh, was that all ? \" replied Eva, unconcernedly. \" All ! Yes, and quite sufficient to excite a woman's curi osity. But I suppose he has acquainted you with his busi ness, and so you need not trouble your head about any thing he does,\" was the somewhat sarcastic retort. \" No, Rhoda, he never told me anything about it, nor did I think of asking. It is no business of mine.\" \"I should think it a business requiring explanation were I in your place.\" \"Were I his wife I might; but, as yet, I have no right"], [207, "THE GREY TOWER. 195 to institute a scrutiny into Frank's private affairs . I am sure he would tell me anything he thought I ought to know or that would be likely to give me pleasure.\" \" Umph ! perhaps that's the reason why he is so mysteriously secret. It might give you anything but pleasure to know.\" Without seeing the insinuation, Eva, looking up again, an swered innocently. \" Ah, that will be it. Just like Frank ; so kind, so thoughtful. He never would tell me anything likely to trouble my little brains.\" \"A doubtful kindness that, Eva. I should not care to be treated like a baby ! \" and Rhoda's head was suddenly ele vated with superlative scorn. \" Ah ! but, Rhoda, you and I are so different ; you have all the fire and energy of a man, but a timid little body like myself must cling for support to a stronger arm, and trust a wiser head for counsel.\" \" That is all very fine, Eva, but I do not see what it has to do with Frank Raeburn's unaccountable trips southward. Unaccountable, unless he has some one special to visit; for business that is business might be transacted by letter, I should think.\" \" Now, Rhoda, that's sheer nonsense. Do you think if you were to write to Mr. Shields, he could select and send you a dress to suit you, or Miss Jackson make it from written instructions ? \" \"Certainly I do; there would be nothing unusual in that ; business people reduce everything to system, and one dress or a dozen might be furnished from samples with equal facility ; and surely a dressmaker, who has your measure and pattern, may do her work at a distance.\" \" You always beat me in argument, so I give in. Look, have I not back-stitched that sleeve neatly? You might help me, Rhoda, with my stitching sometimes, when you know I have so much to do.\" \" You are quite aware I don't like sewing. I am surprised you should ask me. Give the work to a seamstress.\""], [208, "196 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \"To have it spoiled,\" said Eva, laughingly. \"Nay, I should not like my wedding garments made with a hot needle and burning thread, as yours always are. I must have them as neat and nice as fingers can make them. But I know what I'll do. I'll ask Mary Reed to come over in another month, and she will help me ; I know she will.\" \"Likely enough; it is all she is fit for. ' To sit in a corner and sew up a seam,' \" asserted her cousin, with a shrug. \" Now that's very unkind of you, Rhoda ; you know Mary is a well-educated girl, better educated than either you or I, learned in mathematics, Greek, and Latin; but for all that she does not despise her needle, and you need not despise her. I wish I was only half as clever, if only for Frank's sake.\" Another shrug was Rhoda's sole response, as she looked out on the budding hopes of spring, seeing neither the trees nor their fair promise. Once more foiled in her attempts to crush those sweet hopes budding within the breast of Eva, she stood nursing her indignation at the supposition that she should help forward with her hands the marriage which was to blight every hope of her own life. Eva wondered often at her cousin's frequent fits of moodi ness when alone with her. To her silence and abstraction she had been accustomed from the time of her return from school, but there was a strange something superadded now which in her guilelessness she could not comprehend. She had no suspicion of the storm raging in Rhoda's soul \u2014 a storm where one love shut out the claims of all others, and made life to her a perpetual and harassing warfare. Not the proud warfare of self against self, but that of self for self against the world. Notwithstanding the self-imposed claims on her active industry, Eva, as the spring advanced, found always leisure for Frank, and would be ready bonneted and shawled when he came to take her for a ramble by the river, or a drive through the green lanes. They had no duenna now; Rhoda"], [209, "THE GREY TOWER. 197 had no desire to witness the happiness she could neither share nor mar ; so, when invited to join them, which it must be owned was not too often, made the jocose answer that a lover's duet required no chorus, and as she would be out of place she preferred to practise her solo at home. How came it they never saw what it cost her to say the light words with so pleasant a smile? Mr. Raeburn, having resolved to undertake the working of his own colliery as soon as the holder's lease expired, or else to sink another shaft in a distant part of his land, was consequently anxious to make himself acquainted with the manners, habits, and modes of thought of the pit population, differing as they did widely from all classes with whom he had hitherto come in contact. With this view he varied the direction of his drives. One day he turned his horse's head northward over Dur ham Moor through Pity-me and Plawsworth as far as Ches ter-le-Street, and whilst the animal baited, he and Eva examined the monuments and effigies in the ancient church of the old Roman station on that grand Roman road. Another day their course would lie through Sacristan to Witton Gilbert, and across the country, returning by Neville's Cross. Then he drove westward through Brancepeth and Willington to Byer's Green; and as they traversed Willington, Eva pointed out a large gloomy house of dull red brick, which she said always reminded her of the old brick house at the other Willington, near North Shields, of which so many stories were told. At that time neither Mr. Howitt nor Mrs. Crowe had published their account of \" The Haunted House of Willington,\" and William Drury 's nocturnal watch did not take place until some months later, so that Eva could only relate the marvellous stories respecting its ghost or ghosts current in the locality, and which she had learnt from Nancy, who had been born close by, long years before the house itself was erected, and which Eva's imagination had trans ferred to the Willington she knew."], [210, "198 STUNG TO THE QUICK. As they journeyed homewards, and Eva lightly repeated Nancy's story, Frank said, \" Suppose we drive round and see another haunted house to-morrow ; it is too late now, Eva,\" a proposition which had her full assent. So on the morrow they drove northward, again towards an old mansion, which had long attracted Eva's attention, and on the picturesque beauty of which she had frequently expatiated. It was a secluded building, part mansion, part castle, situated in a narrow vale, and almost hidden from the view by a belt of large forest trees surrounding it on all sides ; ivy had grown up to the battlements, and hung in neglected festoons over the Gothic entrance, which was situated in an angle of the building, and closed with a heavy oaken door studded with large headed nails. This portion of the building was more elevated than the rest, so that a small turret, situated immediately over the doorway, towered above the trees, and was visible for some distance up the road, the road which led over Western Hill. From this feature the whole pile had obtained the- name of the Grey Tower; and as it had been for some years uninhabited, there was a slight air of desolation about the spot which the neighbouring villagers had not failed to couple with stories of the supernatural. Frank stopped the horse at the avenue gate, and pointed to the abandoned dwelling, saying \u2014 \" There it is, Eva ; what do you think of it'? \" \" Dear me, I thought you were going to show me some strange place I knew nothing about. I have known the Grey Tower all my life. Rhoda and I used to come with Miss Adamson, nutting and blackberrying in the planting near the road, when we were very little children. Miss Adamson was older, and took care of us, or mamma would not have allowed us to ramble so far.\" \"Are you disappointed, love?.\" asked Frank, answering her tone rather than her words."], [211, "THE GREY TOWER. 199 \" A little ; not much, dear Frank ; but I thought I was going to see some dreadfully dismal place, so weird and awful it would give one the horrors to look at it. The Grey Tower is a beautiful place, not half grim enough for a respect able ghost.\" \" Neither is the haunted house at Willington; that is even more modern. But if you are not afraid, Eva, I will procure the key (I know who holds it), and we will look over it some day soon.\" \" Afraid ! what should I be afraid of ? There will be plenty of dust, I dare say, but I will put an old dress on, and then I shall not mind it.\" \" You are a brave little woman. How would you like to reside there ? \" \" Oh, dearly ! it would be delightful ! \" \" What, amidst all the ghosts and hobgoblins ? \" \" Ah, Frank ! you are laughing at me. I don't believe there are any ghosts but evil thoughts, and I hope we shall never harbour them, and then they will never trouble us.\" So the following day, armed with a tremendous door-key, a bottle of oil, and a feather, they strolled to the Tower again, having vainly endeavoured to induce either Rhoda or Mr. Marsh to join the expedition; the one having, as she said, something else to do, the other preferring his pipe and nap to an after-dinner ramble. The gate was not locked, but it was very unwilling to open, so Mr. Raeburn called \" Geordie,\" to a pitman passing at the time. The man came forward readily to put a second and much sturdier shoulder to the gate, which then gave way slowly, making a circular track in the soil, as gravel and dead leaves were pushed in a growing heap before it. But the man steadily refused the shilling Mr. Raeburn proffered for the service he had rendered, and with a rough bow went his way. \"Aw dinnet need payin' to be ceevil,\" said he. After a profuse application of oil, the key turned harshly"], [212, "200 STUNG TO THE QUICK. in the lock with a very disagreeable screech, and the nail studded door went back on hinges which echoed the tooth edging music of the lock, making a track in the dust on the stone-floor like that made by the gate among the rotten leaves. Gate and rusty key had destroyed the delicacy, of Frank's lavender kid gloves, so there was no scruple about soiling them in opening shutters to let daylight in on the dust and cob webs. Mr. Raeburn sighed heavily once or twice as he passed, with scarcely a word, from one empty room to an other, close and musty with long disuse. \" What are you sighing for, Frank ? \" asked Eva, tenderly, looking up into his grave face. \" Nothing, nothing, my dear. I was only thinking how very naked and bare the place looks, and pondering about the people who lived here last, and how different fires and furniture made it then. It is very dismal now.\" \" Not a bit more dismal than you would look if you had been shut up as long, and never had your coat brushed or your face washed,\" responded Eva, archly. \" Then you like the old place ? \" \" Oh, yes, it is beautiful ; and what fine views there are from the upper windows, and how romantic that waterfall is. I never saw that before; we children never ventured so far into the grounds for fear of a crazy man, who used to live in a shed somewhere in the wood. Poor fellow, he died there one hard winter, and was found frozen to the ground by some boys gathering firewood; \"and Eva's voice took a sorrowful cadence as she spoke\". \" I have heard something of it somewhere, I think, from the landlord's agent. But Eva,\" said he, as he locked the door, without reclosing the shutters, \" you do not say how you would like to live here, now you have seen the inside of the house.\" \" Oh, Frank, I told you that yesterday. I don't know so nice a place anywhere about Durham. But do you think"], [213, "THE GREY TOWER. 201 the landlord would let us have it. He must have had some reason for shutting it up so long.\" \" I incline to think he would let us have anything, \" replied Mr. Raeburn, with a peculiar smile, and an emphasis on the pronoun which made Eva blush, and hold down her head. But it was lifted by an ungloved hand to meet a pair of radiant eyes fixed searchingly and lovingly on hers, and to receive a warm kiss on her trembling lips as he repeated \u2014 \" Us, Eva, darling ; he could refuse us nothing, I am sure.\" \" Do you know him, then ? \" \" / believe I do, we have transacted a considerable amount of business together since I came to England.\" And so it was settled ; and in a day or two Eva was told that the landlord had consented to let \" us \" have the Grey Tower, which was forthwith handed over to a whole regiment of workpeople. These were pleasant days for Eva and Frank. \"Bless the bairn,\" Martin would say, as he left the horse's head, and watched them drive away, whether up or down the street. \" Bless the baim ! She's as bonnie a lass as ony in Durham, an' it divs maw auld eyen gud te see her lookin' se blythe an' winsome ; \" sentiments echoed by Mr. Marsh's heart and often his voice (as he stood at the door step till they drove off), proud alike of his child and the man she had chosen. CHAPTER XXVI. A BRIDAL. What a commotion a projected marriage creates in a house, especially when the bride is the only child of a wealthy father; and unostentatiously as Mr. Marsh's household was conducted, he was a man of substance."], [214, "202 STUNG TO THE QUICK. The bridal trousseau alone is sufficient to occupy the minds of the feminine portion of the family; but in this instance, as Rhoda evinced no disposition to facilitate matters, and Frank perversely insisted on Eva laying down her needle whenever he entered, the outfit would not have been ready as soon as the settlements were, had not good Mary Reed come to the rescue. She was pale, thin, and dispirited, in spite of all her efforts to appear cheerful, and never more so than after Mr. Hesketh's visits to her. It was his habit to talk about his son so hopefully and pleasantly, and with such entire ignorance of any coolness or estrangement between them, she could not find in her heart to undeceive him. Besides, there was as much pleas ure as pain came with his cheerful and hope-inspiring visions of a future shared by herself and Cuthbert. She would draw her hand across her aching eyelids when he was gone, as if to shut out the vision of the stern and present reality, yet suffered herself to be buoyed up with his anticipations in spite of reason. At some one's suggestion the old crimson curtains were removed and replaced, a new carpet laid down, and the whole house restored on most approved principles. Rhoda, too (after a visit paid surreptitiously to the Grey Tower, and of which she never spoke), brisked up wonder fully, and displayed an alacrity in facilitating preparations just the reverse of her former inertness. Maggy, then in her seventeenth year, came over at the last, and whilst Mr. Marsh and Mr. Raeburn walked or drove from the Grey Tower together or apart, alternately inspected painters and paperers, or consulted the furnishing lists of cabinet makers, and upholsterers, and ironmongers, and china-dealers, &c, &c, both in Durham and Newcastle, to the end of a very long chapter, she made herself as useful as Mary in the house, whilst Rhoda, with smiles on her face and wrath in her heart, trotted backwards and forwards"], [215, "A BRIDAL. 203 with Eva between drapers and milliners, aiding the selection of material and controlling shape and design, whether for bonnets or dresses. Edwin Grove had been at home some time, a fully quali fied surgeon; yet was undecided whether to remain in Dur ham, where the prestige of his father's name might secure him a good practice, or to accept an invitation to Kelloe, and take the contract for the colliery there. It so happened that, in these frequent expeditions to Messrs. Shields' or Miss Jackson's, the young ladies and Edwin generally met by accident in some part or other of the town; and, as the milliner's shop was in New Elvet, if perchance the young gentleman walked beside the maidens towards their destination, it is not to be wondered that Lucy, from her chamber in Old Elvet, which commanded a full view of the more ancient thoroughfare, should more than once behold and follow their movements with very angry eyes, until a shower of tears shut them from her sight altogether. The important day came at length as a fitting climax to so much preparation, and on the first of May, in the year eighteen hundred and forty, Eva promised to \"love, cherish, and obey 'Frank Raeburn' till death did them part,\" Edwin Grove being groomsman, Mary and Rhoda bridesmaids. Might not these bridesmaids aptly prefigure the conflicting spirits of good and evil, battling for the mastery over Eva's destiny? They might \u2014 they did \u2014 but which would prove the victor? Is it necessary to tell of the bride's white satin bonnet, shielding, with its ample brim, a bower of blonde and orange blossoms, of the rich white lace veil worn over the bonnet, the lutestring dress (longer in the skirt than the discarded black paramatta), the small cashmere shawl and kid gloves, the silk stockings and tiny satin shoes, all of the same pure hue, typical of the unstained chastity of the maiden at the altar? Or need it be told that the bridegroom's wed-"], [216, "204 STUNG TO THE QUICK. ding-suit was a tightly-fitting coat of a clear deep blue, with gilt buttons and velvet collar, that his vest was cream-coloured satin, his trousers of pale dove kerseymere, strapped closely down over boots of the newly introduced patent leather, or that his hat was of white beaver ? It may be as well to let the outline stand, not for the edification of readers old as the writer, but for the infor mation of young ladies, dreaming of their own bridal robes, who may care to learn the sort of wedding-dresses their parents wore. There was not a very large party invited; but a pretty fair muster of feminine beholders, whose sole object was curiosity, sprinkled the pews of St. Oswald's Church. Amongst these Mrs. Coulson and Mrs. Hesketh had planted themselves in as conspicuous a spot as possible, but Lucy, with a double motive for curiosity, hid herself in a corner whence she could hear and see, almost unobserved herself. Why had she not the self-command to remain at home ? She would have spared herself the mortification of witness ing the gallant attentions of the groomsman to the brides maids, or the glance of triumph which shot from Rhoda's eyes, as they found her out in her retreat during the passage to the vestry after the ceremony. It was more than she could bear ; so she hurried from the church homewards, and brushing hastily past Betty in the hall, went to her own room for a good cry, partly of envy that Eva had married before her and made such a match, partly of vexation that Edwin Grove had deserted her for \"that thing;\" she \"wouldn't have minded much if it had been anyone else ; \" she \" wondered how Dr. Grove could look complacently on such shameful flirtation, knowing as he did what the creature was ! \" Nor did Mrs. Hesketh feel at all too comfortable at the presence of Mr. Hesketh, arrayed in new garments from head to heel (nankeens inclusive), with the chubby Miss Dorothea on his arm, radiant with smiles, and the coveted Canton shawl."], [217, "A BRIDAL. 205 A pretty pass it had come to when they could be invited to a wedding and she left at home! She certainly would not submit to such repeated indignities offered in the face of the whole city ! It never occurred to her that by remaining at home she would have escaped at least the publicity of the slight. Dr. Grove had long suspected Rhoda of a preference for Mr. Raeburn, and more than once had detected a latent gleam in her black eye which boded no good to her rival; but her demeanour on the bridal-day completely posed him. There was an air of triumph and satisfaction about her which altogether upset his theories; something that was genuine, not artificial, and that baffled him. Had he overheard a conversa tion between Mr. Marsh and her after breakfast he would have had a clue to the enigma. \"My bairn, I think this is a fitting occasion to release you from entire dependence on me. Hitherto I have sup plied your purse and Eva's equally, but now you are going to live with your cousin, you will be removed from your present banker, and therefore, in order to provide against contingencies \u2014 for life is very uncertain \u2014 I have vested \u00a35,000 in the funds in your name, and here are the securi ties. You may remember asking me one day, when Hesketh was so shaky a while ago, if I thought he had made his will, remarking that Cuthbert would be likely to take all if he died without one ; but I don't think so ill of the lad, though those women have used him unfairly. However, that set me thinking that I had made no provision for you, so I resolved to repair that error at once.\" \" Oh, Mr. Marsh, there was no necessity for this. What shall I want with so much money?\" \" Why, a good husband, to be sure, to help you to spend it, or take care of it. But you'll find plenty of uses for it without a husband. Did you ever calculate what it cost a year for frills and furbelows? \u2014 not you, I warrant!\" Not calculated, Mr. Marsh! Ah, your adopted niece was"], [218, "206 STUNG TO THE QUICK. all calculation, and the delight sparkling in her eyes, which you mistook for gratitude, was but the triumph of holding at last the means to work her will, and joy to find that the seed she had sown so skilfully had fructified so soon. Still, she protested his liberality overpowered her, and was as unnecessary as unexpected. \" I shall never be able to repay your excess of kindness, my more than benefactor.\" And she raised his hand to her lips with the last word jarring at her heart. \"Pay me in love and care for Eva, if at all, Rhoda; but, there, there, no more thanks, be off to our friends ; Edwin Grove will come in search of you else.\" When the chaise which was to convey Mary Reed and the newly-wedded pair to the station was at the door, the luggage packed, and Mary inside, whilst Eva was kissing her girlhood's friends all round, servants included, and finally hung sobbing on her indulgent father's breast, Martin pulled Mr. Raeburn aside, and whispered tremulously, \"Yow'll tak' care ov our canny bairn, Maister Raeburn, aw hope ; she kens nowt o' th' warld, an' nowt o' sorrow, an aw div hope she nivver may.\" \" She shall know no sorrow I can guard her dear head from, be assured, my trusty friend,\" answered Mr. Raeburn, gravely, wringing Martin's hand earnestly as he spoke. \" Hout, mon, what are ye fashing aboot ; is not he certain to tak' care of her? I'll answer for that.\" \" Thank you, Nancy, for your good opinion. Come, Eva, my love \u2014 my wife \u2014 we shall be too late. Good-bye, Mr. Marsh, I will guard our treasure with my life.\" And so he lifted his tearful bride into her seat, whilst Mr. Marsh could only say, \" I know you will, Frank. God bless you both ! Good-bye, good-bye, Mary ! \" They drove off, Rhoda returning to the room to pack cards, and gloves, and bride's cake, with the official assist ance of Edwin Grove. Whilst the one bridesmaid accompanied Mr. and Mrs."], [219, "A BRIDAL. 207 Raeburn to London, where the honeymoon was spent, the other, at her own suggestion, remained behind to superintend the hiring of servants, the arrangement of furniture, and altogether to prepare the Grey Tower for their reception. She did made her preparations, and mysterious enough some of them were! But, in the midst of all, she made opportunities to wander lovingly through the woods with Cuthbert, who reached Durham three days after the marriage, whenever he could spare a day from his duty, and she corresponded with him when away, but still in secret, always in secret, on the old plea \u2014 Mr. Marsh's evident predilection for Edwin Grove. CHAPTER XXVII. EVA'S NEW HOME. The Grey Tower demands something more than the cursory description previously given of it, from its intimate connec tion with the main events of this story. As already told, it was an irregular building, with many angles, many shel tered corners, and so constructed that the real shape and size of the edifice could only be comprehended by a view from a steep hill rising at the back, which enclosed the house and grounds as in an amphitheatre, the irregular semicircle being broken on the right by the entrance, slightly fenced across, to a ravine, narrowing to a mere gorge about eighty yards beyond. Down this ravine swept a small stream, fed by springs in the bank side, and this, spreading as it emerged from confinement, coursed round the base of the hill, both to the right, where it passed under a bridge on the high road, and to the left, where, after girdling the pre mises in the rear, it broke noisily over rocks, a picturesque cascade, then quietly ran and hid itself beneath the tangled underwood."], [220, "208 STUNG TO THE QUICK. A small rustic bridge crossed the streamlet close by the ravine, and paths led from it up the hill sides, winding among the trees which clothed the steep \u2014 larch and pine, beech and birch, oak and hawthorn \u2014 and leading to mossy seats in shady nooks, commanding views of grounds, or tower, or road. But, when swollen by heavy rains, the stream, o'erleaping its bed as it left the ravine, under the shadow of oak and sycamore, formed a fresh channel for itself down the wide gravel zvalk, which led from the rustic bridge to the gothic doorway, then rushed like a river down the carriage-drive, and spread across the level green as the drive began its ascent to the gates. Unaware of this peculiarity until, as a denizen of the Tower, he became inconveniently acquainted with it, no steps had been taken by Mr. Raeburn to interpose an effectual barrier between the water and the pathway, which, conse quently, was still liable to be flooded in very rainy weather. Within the curve formed by this path, and between the Tower and the watercourse, the coach-house, stabling, &c, had been built, as irregular and semi-gothic in construction as the mansion frowning down upon them. Here, too, were rooms for the serving-men, the doors and windows of which faced the hill, and were not visible from the house. The Grey Tower itself was for the most part four storeys high, with three or four rooms on each floor, if that could be where no three rooms were precisely on the same level; but above the entrance-hall and staircase was a room two or three feet higher than all these, containing the only window which overlooked the drive and carriage-gates. From this landing a steep, enclosed stair led still higher to the turret, containing a small apartment, entered from a trap-door in the floor of the room. This place was not more than six feet square, and was lit by a small diamonded window, fronting the hill, and overlooking the roof of the main building. In an adjoining lumber-loft Rhoda had stowed away a"], [221, "EVA'S NEW HOME. 209 thick mattress, which closely fitted this floor, but which was so constructed that on raising the trap a portion of the mattress, larger than the trap itself, would rise with it. It lay there, covered with matting and canvas in which furniture had been packed, and no one exploring the premises would have suspected that a secret lay beneath. Under the staircase in the entrance hall was a small door in the panelling, opening into what seemed a dark closet for the reception of odds and ends. It was no such thing. Rigid scrutiny of the building, for a door to the cellars besides those outside, discovered, not a cellar door, but this one leading apparently nowhere. It did not lead to the cellar stair-head; the vaulted cellaring had no entrance within the building, could alone be approached by a flight of stone steps from the outside \u2014 why or wherefore, the dead and buried projector alone could have told ; convenience had certainly never been consulted. In Rhoda's close search for an inner cellar door she had opened this one beneath the hall staircase, and boldly plunged a step down into the cobwebbed gloom to discover \u2014 not that which she sought, but something she might find quite as useful, a door leading into the open air, a door of which she said nothing. Not a door with that bold front to the daylight, which seems to say, \" Here I am, come in ! \" but a sly, sneaking pigmy of a door, hiding behind a buttress, and beneath a screen of tangled ivy; a door a man must crouch to enter, though he stepped down feet foremost, and where no woman could stand erect; a curtained gap, where a fox might run to earth and baffle pursuit ; a murky door no sunbeam ever illuminated ; a sinister door, never down in the architect's plan; a door insinuated in the masonry, for what? That a jealous husband might watch and surprise his innocent wife ! This forgotten doorway faced the over-shadowing and over topping buttress (whence the ivy drooped and trailed), being pierced in a wall which here projected and formed a deep p"], [222, "210 STUNG TO THE QUICK. angle, just in proportion as the building receded on the north ern side, and made that other angle which held the noble gothic entrance. Did Satan place the key of his private portal, bright and shining, at once in Rhoda's ready palm ? Not he. A door was there, and a lock was there, and Rhoda tried each key on the labelled household bunch with like effect \u2014 disap pointment. The last she tried stuck in the wards; for some moments it resisted her attempts to release it, then yielded unexpectedly, and in the recoil she dropped, and of course extinguished, her light. She had closed the staircase door after her, and was in total darkness \u2014 mousey, musty, mildewy darkness \u2014and for a moment conscience tried to unlock her heart, much as she had tried to unlock that other demon's door. She swayed to and fro irresolutely. What was there in the darkness to make her shrink or waver? The great evil suggested by that little door was scarcely shaped or defined. Why should she shrink? Shut in the gloom, more by the presence of busy work men in the hall than by the panel, or its simple, innocent looking latch, she stood irresolute on the threshold of sin. It is there we pause, and hesitate, and tremble, and resolve ; that threshold once o'erstepped, down comes the portcullis, retreat is cut off; we march forward ; some slowly and reluc tantly, some willingly, some recklessly \u2014 all dreading or refus ing the terrific battle for freedom and return. Whilst the workmen, cheerily calling to their fellows, tramped through the hall with clattering feet, and up the staircase overhead, shaking the dust down in a shower on her dress and on her hair, she had some moments for deliberation in the darkness. Did she deliberate ? Yes. Did she forego her purpose? No. She had taken counsel with the spirit of darkness too long to be appalled by its presence around her, and was not of a nature to look back. For one moment she thought, \" Is"], [223, "EVA'S NEW HOME. 211 this gloom typical of that future I invoke for others, and may perchance provoke for myself? Is the extinction of that light an augury of good or ill ? A dropped candle, a missing key to bar a door of promise, are these warnings to bid me change my mind ? \" The second thoughts were, \" Nonsense, nonsense; there were no omens to check my other purpose. And wherefore this; I owe to Lucy no thing but what I am resolved to pay, and pay with interest. I am surely not such a baby as to be frightened into repentance by a shadow. Wherever is the candlestick ? \" The first foot trod the staircase as she, stooping, groped on the earthen floor for the candlestick. Her fingers encoun tered a slimy snail, which she mistook for the candle until it moved ;. she dropped it shuddering, but she felt again, and before the last workman's foot left the stair, she touched and grasped not only the candlestick, but a key* \u2014 a damp and rusty key. She laughed to herself. \" I was indeed a baby to be afraid of an omen. If I had not dropped my light I should never have found this key. I presume it belongs to the lock. How very fortunate ! I can feel it is rusty. It must be cleansed before I try it. What a lucky mischance ! \" That door was surely Satan's own, and he had driven her good angel back when he put the key within her clasp ! Good oiling and cleaning made lock and key obedient to each other, and Rhoda, covered with dust, mortar, cobwebs, and dead leaves, forced her way through the loose network of ivy, and stood almost beneath the elevated windows of draw ing and dining-rooms with the buttress for a shield. These windows were on the same (the buttressed) side of the Tower, commanding a view of the wood and waterfall, and through a vista in the trees formed by lopping off intervening branches, a glimpse of the distant city also, with its hoary* towers; but the projecting portion of building, that which held the lower staircase and Rhoda's secret door, screened the entrance to the shrubbery, where Rhoda at once strolled to refresh her self, and shake off dust and dulness."], [224, "212 STUNG TO THE QUICK. She never thought of the servants' entrance at the back which opened towards the steep bank and the watercourse at its base, with only a flagged footway between the buildings and the brook; nor that that doorway (pointed gothic, like the prin cipal one with a similar nail-studded oaken door) had likewise no one window in the house from which it could be over looked. A strange building that Grey Tower, where not one door could be seen from a window, and no window observed from a door, save the dwarf stucco-fronted door hid in the ivy. In about six weeks the bridal party returned, and drove direct from the Ferry Hill Station to their new residence, where Mr. Marsh and Mr. Hesketh waited with Rhoda to receive them. The greetings on all hands were most cordial (Rhoda's seemed such), and Eva was in unusual spirits, all she most cared for on earth being present; but poor Mary glanced timidly round, hoping, yet fearing, to see Cuthbert, and a look of disappointment stole over her face as she missed him from the group assembled at the doorway. Old Mr. Hesketh must have divined what was passing in her mind, for shortly after they had laid aside their travelling robes, and whilst Eva was making herself acquainted with the servants Rhoda had with much difficulty hired for her, he took occasion to tell Mary that Cuthbert had sailed a week before, but had gone only a very short voyage, and would be in port again in August. \"Meanwhile, honey,\" said he, \"keep up your heart ; Cuth bert is all right in the main. I find this Rhoda here with her smooth tongue and beguiling lips has somehow warped or blinded his judgment, but trust his old father, who knows him best, he will come to his senses some day ; and then, child, be the good, sensible girl you ever have been, and welcome him back without reproach, if you possibly can.\" \" But, Mr. Hesketh, I fear that time will not come. He avoids me; never writes a line; and though he is all affec tion and regret when he comes into port, if he only visits"], [225, "EVA'S NEW HOME. 213 Durham I see no more of him until the end of a fresh voyage, and this time I have not seen him at all! \" \" Ah ! never mind, honey. Sailors are uncertain creatures, and Cuthbert is all impulse. He will be coming to you in hot haste some of these days, wanting you to marry him off-hand; and if he does, take my advice and him at his word. You might do worse. He is a good son, and will make a good husband. So you do as I say, when he gives you a chance, and tell your father when you go home what I have advised.\" \" Yes ; but what answer shall I make to my father when he urges, as he does, that so uncertain and fickle a lover is not likely to be more constant as a husband? Both my father and mother advise me to dismiss him from my thoughts and strive to forget him. \" And she looked sadly down on her clasped hands with a deep sigh. \" Sensible advice that, Mary, no doubt, if it were quite practicable. Have you followed it ? \" \" I tried, Mr. Hesketh, very resolutely, but have not yet succeeded. Old memories are not so easily effaced. Besides, I had regarded Cuthbert as my future husband for so many years I was totally unprepared for his desertion, and cannot forget him simply because it is desirable. \" \" But it is not desirable, my dear bairn. Dr. Grove has given me a hint that Rhoda has wheedled Cuthbert away from you, but he also said he was just as sure she was only trifling with him. So be patient, honey; the doctor is a shrewd old fish, and if that gipsy (as my wife calls her) teaches our Cuthbert a lesson, you will only find him more penitent and tractable in the end. \" \" If she does teach him a lesson it can only be through making his heart ache, and that could be no satisfaction to me. \" \" Canny bairn, \" murmured the old man to himself, smooth ing down her hair caressingly, as he marvelled at her patient constancy."], [226, "214 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \" But, \" said she, in continuation, \" if Cuthbert be entangled with Miss Wearbank, I cannot bring myself to think he loves her, and even if he did, she is too imperious for him; they would never be happy together \u2014 never. \" \" Happy ! they would live like cat and dog ! and I have had too much of that life to wish it for my son. So, my bairn, I say again, if you love Cuthbert, as I believe you do, keep up your heart, and if he be not all right when he come, I will see what I can do. There, there, don't tremble and look so white. Don't let that girl see she can crow over you ! \" Only a day or two before had Dr. Grove, now a constant guest at Mr. Hesketh's, enlightened him as to Miss Wearbank's probable designs on his son; but it is remarkable how great a revulsion of sentiment he experienced towards that young lady thereupon. He observed defects and noted flaws in her never visible before, and began to think a little more leniently of Mrs. Hesketh's opinion in consequence, though not for an instant inclined to tolerate its development or mode of propagation. His objection to \" that girl, \" more over, extended no farther than to her supposed usurpation of his son, whose original choice he had confirmed long ago. Mary, as the very antithesis of the surveyor's second wife, quiet, modest, and retiring, was an especial favourite with him, and he had no inclination that she should be superseded by Rhoda; for thcjugh he had pitied Rhoda's helplessness as a babe, her state of dependence as she grew up exposed to his wife's petty malice, and admired her beauty and accom plishments when older, there was a sort of dread in his admiration, and he assuredly did not desire her for a daughter. After the repast prepared for the travellers had been partaken and removed, Mr. Raeburn proposed to Eva that she and Mary should inspect her future home, to see if everything had been arranged to her satisfaction, whilst her father, Mr. Hesketh, and himself held a consultation on matters in which they would have no interest."], [227, "EVA'S NEW HOME. 215 \"Don't be too sure of that, Frank,\" said Eva, rising; then putting her flaxen curls close to his black whiskers, she whispered, \" Does not all that interests you interest me ? \" Frank's reply was wordless ; but Mr. Marsh, who had sharp ears, answered briskly, \u2014 \"We admit the principle, little puss, but not the interest; ours are miner matters and below your comprehension ; so be off and examine the bright things above whilst we talk of the black things below!\" With a pat on her father's cheek and a pleasant smile, Eva tripped after Rhoda out of the room, followed by Mary, graver than beseemed her years. The room in which Eva left the gentlemen was on the ground-floor, which contained also a small library, the kitchen, larder, &c, and housekeeper's-room. On the floor above was a drawing-room which overlooked the fern-fringed cascade and a picturesque combination of wood and rock beyond. Eva was in ecstasies at the exquisite loveliness of the natural picture seen from the mullioned window, and delighted with the furniture and draperies, costly and elegant, modern yet antique in design, to be in keeping with the whole structure. Her chamber and the dressing-room adjoining had been visited before, when she arranged her toilet, and now they passed upwards. There were guest-chambers, servants' rooms, and, some steps higher, Rhoda's \u2014 the one with the window like a Cyclops' eye in the blank face of the building. \" Why, Rhoda, whatever induced you to perch yourself up here? The very stairs would be the death of me,\" exclaimed Eva, with a look of genuine astonishment, which Mary's face reflected. \" Oh, I wish to see something more than trees and water. I have had enough of them. The roar of that waterfall is deafening. I should never sleep in its vicinity. Besides, from this window I get the only glimpse of the distant road and the straggling specimens of humanity who traverse it which can be obtained in this very romantic but very dismal"], [228, "216 STUNG TO THE QUICK. apology for a castle. Then / am not asthmatic, and can afford a little breath when I have a whim to humour. \" \" Well, dear, if you are satisfied, I am. You have really arranged everything so elegantly and luxuriously here, as else where, that taking the larger window into consideration I think you have not chosen badly. You know your ideas were always elevated. \" And the happy bride laughed at her own faint attempt at a pun. \" But whither does this staircase lead ? \" asked Mary, opening a door almost opposite to Rhoda's, which closed on a narrow stairway panelled off, not balustraded. From the drawing-room floor upwards, the trumpet-shaped staircase was lit by a succession of narrow slits or loop-holes in the masonry*, glazed withinside, and through one of these a few rays of light struggled to chase the darkness of the enclosed stairway. \" What a curious place, Rhoda ; what shall we find shut up here?\" asked Eva, repeating Mary's unanswered question. \" Oh, the turret, as it is called, a room too small to hold a bed, I should think.\" And Rhoda led the way through the trap to the strip of floor beyond it. A glance through the window and at the bare walls was sufficient. They cared not for the cobwebs in the adjoining lumber loft, or the secrets the spiders kept, but came back to the habitable rooms with a sense of relief, Eva protesting she would never go there again. \" What do you think that place has been designed for, Miss Wearbank?\" inquired Mary; \"it appears too cramped to be of any real use.\" \" If I were my father I might say 'as a lofty ante-room to a lumber-/q/?,' \" replied Eva, imitating his voice and man ner. \"For my own part I should have preferred an open and airy space instead of that gloomy garret.\" \"Very likely,\" responded Rhoda, carelessly ; \"but the place has its purpose, no doubt, if only as a means of descent to the roof below for repairs. I should think you had seen the flagstaff on the turret.\""], [229, "EVA'S NEW HOME. 217 \" Certainly,\" responded both, in a breath. \" I presume, then, that room to be also a means of com munication with the roof above, to hoist a flag upon the naked staff.\" \"Oh, capital! Mary, we will get some silk; you shall help me to make a flag.\" \"You forget, Mrs. Raeburn, I should go home to-morrow,\" interrupted Mary. \" No, I did not forget ; only I do not intend you to go, and I do not intend you to call me Mrs. Raeburn; I am 'Eva' to you, as I always was, so remember that. But let us go back to the flag. Rhoda detests sewing, or she might help me. However, I will embroider Frank's crest on the silk, and we will have a beautiful flag floating in the breeze on every holiday, such as Christmas, and our wedding-day, and all our birthdays \" Eva stopped short \u2014 Birthdays ! Rhoda had no birthday ! As the same thought glanced through both their minds their eyes met, and Eva trembled at the expression in her cousin's. \" Oh, Rhoda, dear, I am so sorry ! I did not mean to give you pain; indeed I did not,\" apologised she, with her arms twined lovingly round fierce Rhoda's waist, and her face up turned to plead forgiveness. \" Oh, it does not matter,\" returned Rhoda, coldly putting away the clasping arms, \"I am accustomed to pain; I can endure it. We are made strong by suffering.\" \"We ought to be,\" assented Mary, faintly, with a widely different interpretation of the word \" strong, \" and an inward misgiving that she did not feel much stronger either in mind or body for the suffering she had had since she first saw Rhoda. \" Well, my opinion is that suffering would not make me stronger,\" said Eva, lightly, as she led the way downstairs; \" but then, except when my poor mother died, and while I was so fearful my dear Frank could not love me, I never knew what trouble or suffering meant.\""], [230, "218 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \" And never shall, my darling wife, if I can shield you from it!\" exclaimed Mr. Raeburn, earnestly, as he advanced from the open doorway of the drawing-room, having overheard her as she crossed the broad landing. He took both her wee hands in his, and led her into the room, as she murmured, feelingly, \"Oh, Frank, you need not tell me that; I am sure of it!\" A valuable piano in the drawing-room had attracted her attention. It was locked, but while thanking Frank for all he had done to gratify her, he proffered her a small silver key, and asked for a song. On opening the instrument she read, inlaid in the rosewood above the keys, \" Frank to Eva, \" and clapped her hands in surprise and pleasure at the graceful gift. \" Oh, dear, dear, how good and kind you have been to me; and Rhoda, too. I'm sure I do not know how I shall thank you both sufficiently. The house is full of pleasant surprises, from the books on the shelves to the very china in the closets; and then everything is arranged so elegantly and satisfactorily. I do not think even the looping of a curtain could be improved ! Do you, Mary ?\" Mary agreed with her, and she resumed, \"I think more of it because Rhoda hates work in general, and she must have devoted more than time and taste to accomplish so much \u2014 only love could have done what she has ; I am greatly obliged to her.\" Did Rhoda blanch at these thanks ? No, not an eyelid quivered ; she accepted the thanks, as though love indeed had prompted her exertions and thanks were justly hers. Eva ran on, \"But this piano, Frank, was never made in Durham. Where was it bought ?\" \" I purchased it whilst we were in town, had the inscrip tion substituted for the maker's name-plate, and sent it home before us. Do you like the tone ? \" \" Oh, it is exquisite ! \" cried Eva, enthusiastically, as she continued to run her fingers over the keys, dreamily asking herself how she could repay all the love and thought bestowed"], [231, "EVA'S NEW HOME. 219 upon her; but now reminded, she sat down and warbled Moore's \" Minstrel Boy \" so sweetly, that the elder gen tlemen in the room below were attracted upwards. With scarcely a pause, she dashed off merrily into \" Fanny Gray \" and \" Miss Myrtle, \" finishing with \"I love ray love, because I know My love loves me. \" Then protesting, in a comically dolorous voice, she had exhausted her catalogue and her voice with her unprecedented exertions, begged to retire into an easy chair whilst she suffered eclipse from Rhoda. Rhoda's fingers had quivered to strike the keys of a better instrument than she had hitherto known, and, as they glanced across the ivory, the responsive wires vibrated to the tumult of envy and strong desire for wealth and power gathering in her breast, and there was a terrific grandeur in the theme, which rose and fell, and rose again, to sink into a wail as of despair, and end with a tremendous crash of desperation. \" Perhaps, Rhoda, you will play something not quite so fierce and stormy. If the wires have not been trembling for their fate, I have, \" said Mr. Marsh, when she ended. \" It was more warlike than the ' Battle of Prague ; ' what on earth do you call it ? * \" A fantasia of my own. I have no name for the piece. I am sorry you do not like it. \" \" A fantasia was it ! Well, Rhoda, I must say I thought it a trial of strength betwixt yourself and the piano. I am certain Eva must have listened in fear for her new instru ment. \" \" Oh, papa, how can you say so ! I am sure Rhoda played magnificently. \" \" Well, perhaps I am no judge ; but I must confess I like something a little quieter \u2014 the overture to ' Lodoiska, ' or 'William Tell,' or Weber's last waltz, for instance.\" \" But those are all old-fashioned, papa. \""], [232, "220 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \" True music is never old-fashioned, my* dear; but suppose Rhoda treats us to 'Jump Jim Crow;' that is new enough, I presume. What do you think, Frank ? \" \" New enough, certainly, but not much in Miss Wear bank's style\" (he seldom called her Rhoda); \"and I beg to differ from you respecting her masterly fantasia, which I considered a rare composition; and if, as I believe, a voluntary, still the more to be admired. Yet I confess I agree with you in personal preference for compositions of a quieter character. \" \" Less striking, you mean. \" Mr. Raeburn smiled, as did Dr. Grove, who had entered under cover of the stormy fantasia which had raised the discussion, and after whispering to Mr. Hesketh, \" A reflex of the girl's own heart and passions \u2014 what has angered the dame, I wonder ! \" had subsided into watchfulness of her averted face, varying with each turn of criticism, as she sat, her fingers wandering nervously over the keys the while. \" Whatever you may think of Rhoda's music, Charles, I only know that Dorothy went home from the wedding so enraptured with her singing and playing that Lucy is jealous, and nothing will serve her turn but she must take finishing lessons from one of the foreign fellows who visit Scarborough during the summer. \" \"Miss Dorothy seconds the petition, does she not?\" was the interrogation of Dr. Grove. \" Yes, she is quite as bad as the girl, for she says Lucy is not so refractory as she was, and a concession like that may be an encouragement, though what encouragement it may be either to industry or good nature 1 cannot see. \" \" You surely will not refuse so simple a request, \" urged Rhoda, in her most insinuating tones, and with a bright light in her black eyes. \"I studied under an Italian master, and I only regret Eva also had not the benefit of his instruc tions. English musicians are so dull and phlegmatic. An Italian throws his whole soul into his art, and communicates a portion of his enthusiasm to his pupils. \""], [233, "EVA'S NEW HOME. 221 Dr. Grove, biting his thumb nail, the closed hand cover ing his mouth, looked askance at the speaker from under his shaggy eyebrows, mentally recalling the playground scene (which he had heard described by many witnesses) and its consequences, then the more recent insult at the picnic, and wondering when he should be able to probe the depths of that heart ; whilst Frank Raeburn seconded Rhoda, saying \u2014 \"Miss Wearbank is certainly right, in my humble judgment. Country musicians are seldom the best masters, and \" \" Stop, Frank ! \" interposed Mr. Marsh. \" You will not say there are no good musicians in the choir of our cathedral? \" \" Certainly not ; but their close application to church music, grand and majestic as it may be, must create rigidity of style and manner. The peculiar warmth and enthusiasm to which Miss Wearbank alludes belong to a totally differ ent school. \" \" Thank you, Mr. Raeburn ; I am glad I have a sup porter \" said Rhoda, pleasantly. \" I hope you will con vince Mr. Hesketh that a few finishing lessons from one of the despised 'foreign fellows' might be to his daughter's advantage. \" \"You appear to be interested in Miss Hesketh's profi ciency,\" observed Dr. Grove, dryly. \"How is it?\" \" An interest in music only, not in the young lady, \" replied Rhoda, in a low voice, vacating the music stool as she spoke, and crossing to a chair beyond the doctor's range of vision. \" Umph ! ah, umph ! \" were the articulate utterances of the doctor's cogitations \u2014 no more. She rose from the piano, declining to play again; but Mary, encouraged by Mr. Hesketh, ventured \" The Bridal Waltz,\" and one or two other light pieces, whilst a spirited conversation was kept up round Eva's chair, in which the player at length joined, forgetting her own anxieties for the nonce. If there was a troubled heart there, it beat in Rhoda's breast only."], [234, "222 STUNG TO THE QUICK. The happiness of the young couple stung her painfully; her gathering agony* concentrating in hatred of the fair girl who, as she imagined, had come betwixt her and her love. But for Eva she might have won him for herself \u2014 might, nay, would. She sat and listened to his voice, and with every tone her love grew in maddening intensity, and so in like proportion rose the hatred of her innocent rival. But a new project in her breast had developed and intensified, and it gave even a fierce joy to her, and made her buoyant as the rest. Next day they all sallied forth to traverse the grounds, Frank leading his dear little wife to every spot likely to interest her \u2014 through woodland paths, by the clear stream, now dried by the sun into a mere rill, and lifting her and Mary, who had not yet gone home, over the fence (Rhoda despised assistance), he led the party up the ravine. As they* ascended and the gorge narrowed, the over-arching trees on the high banks shut out the sun, and left the gurgling water in deep shadow. \"Oh, what a gloomy place, Mr. Raeburn! Do let us go back. I shiver to think how murderous a spot this looks. I wonder if a murder ever was committed here ? \" said Mary, with a shudder, as she turned to retrace her steps. \" Not that I am aware of, Miss Reed, \" replied Frank. \" I never heard there was a blood stain on the land, though there has been wrong and suffering in years gone by.\" \"Wrong and suffering! Why, Frank, what are you talking about? You have not had the place three months, yet you speak as if you had known all about it years ago. \" \" I was born here, my Eva, and here my broken-hearted mother died. You will remember her story. I left the old Tower in boyhood, it is true; but it has never faded from my memory. It is the home of my ancestors, and doubly dear to me since you, dear wife, were charmed with it, and selected it for our home unconsciously. \" \"You surprise me!\" said Rhoda, \"though I certainly"], [235, "THE SHED IN THE DINGLE. 223 thought, for a stranger, you were a remarkably efficient guide. Did Mr. Marsh know?\" \" Oh, certainly ; but we both thought it unwise to cast a shade on Eva's home in advance. We wished her to learn to love it only.\" Eva's comment was an upturned face to meet her hus band's loving lips, \u2014 no word. Rhoda was more than surprised. She was chagrined beyond measure to find that Eva had not only shut her out from the love of the man she worshipped, but become mistress of an ancestral domain worthy of her ambitious spirit \u2014 lost upon a chit like Eva; and if possible her malignity inten sified threefold. Still she dissembled ; and during the walk home was more amiably conciliating towards Mary than she had been heretofore \u2014 towards Eva kind and cousinly. CHAPTER XXVIII. THE SHED IN THE DINGLE. It had never been Mr. Raeburn's wish that Rhoda should become a permanent inmate of the Tower, and when Eva (covertly inspirited by her cousin) made the proposition he was inclined to demur. Indeed, he went so far as to ask his betrothed if she had duly considered the importance of the step she suggested; but she, ever willing to spare her cousin a pang, wished to remove her from \" the eternal reminder of that restless river, \" as Rhoda had begun to call it, and so answered him at once that her cousin was always miserable in South Street, and would be so much happier with them, besides being a pleasant companion for herself."], [236, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 224 Unwilling to deny Eva's first request of moment, he com plied, and invited Rhoda to make the Tower her home, with unpretending courtesy. At the same time, he felt that her ready acceptance savoured of ingratitude to her benefactor, who would certainly be more solitary, deprived of his daughter, than Eva would with her husband by her side, and he almost regretted he had not explained to Eva his motives for objection. There are concessions which are neither kind nor com plimentary, and this was one. He had not assigned a reason for desiring Rhoda's exclusion, nor openly questioned Eva's judgment in decision. Her reasons were given freely. They did not convince him, yet he gave way almost without a remonstrance, and with his accustomed reticence kept his impressions to himself. A serious mistake that, Mr. Raeburn. The woman who is old and wise enough to wive is old and wise enough to trust, is old and wise enough to take into your secret coun sels! Mr. Raeburn had a glimmering perception of his mistake, yet he made it. He did not tell his bride that Rhoda was a dangerous inmate, having looked love if she had not openly proffered it to him. Not being conceited, he had inclined to ascribe to vanity or self-esteem the growing conviction of Rhoda's smothered attachment to himself It followed naturally that he shrank from making himself ridiculous by an avowal of such an opinion, and still more from clouding with a tinge of jealousy Eva's clear and unsuspicious breast. Besides, if it were so, the girl had no undue fascination for him, there was no fear of his love wandering from the wife of his choice ; he had full confidence in himself, and all fear of alienated affection or jealousy was preposterous; so he kept his own counsel and Rhoda had her will. But it soon became apparent to Frank that the active rule of the household was in Rhoda's hands ; and that, whilst professedly deferring to Mrs. Raeburn as the nominal autho rity, house, servants, and all pertaining thereto were under"], [237, "THE SHED IN THE DINGLE. 225 her control. This was one of the evils he had foreseen, from his observation of their relative positions in Mr. Marsh's home. Dominion came naturally to Rhoda, and what with the hiring of servants, the appointment of their respective duties , the superintendence and direction of workpeople fitting up the place, she was installed mistress even before the true mistress came. Nor did she resign her rule with the keys. She took especial care that Mrs. Raeburn's orders underwent filtration through her sieve before reaching the domestics ; then she began gradually to suggest alterations and amendments in Eva's own plans, until her usurpation was complete. All this was ostensibly done with so earnest a desire to relieve her \" dear cousin \" (she was cousin once more) from the least care or anxiety, that Eva resigned the reins into her hands much as she had done before her marriage. Not that Eva was indolent or incapable of directing her household : her training had been far otherwise ; but she had been accustomed to Rhoda's despotism from her cradle, and scarcely felt it. She was rather disposed to give Rhoda credit for forethought and management, so long as they left her leisure to wander about with Frank, and watch the progress of improvements he had commenced. The young husband was not so easily hoodwinked, he did not (as the diplomatist wished) deem his wife incompetent or imbecile because the household sceptre was swayed by other hands. He had no mind another should assume the position belonging of right to that wife ; and a few weeks after their return home, during a ramble through the woods, he made his first open protest against it. Dining at country hours, there was always a long afternoon to be occupied or wasted, and the newly-wedded pair were generally up and away by three o'clock, gathering a store of health from fresh air and exercise. Their walks or drives had, however, generally a definite Q"], [238, "226 STUNG TO THE QUICK. object, and frequently extended far beyond the range of the grounds. Rhoda seldom or never joined them, always excusing herself on the plea of occupation, study, headache, weariness or a love of retirement, insisting pleasantly that she was, sure the presence of a third person might be dispensed with. But from the Cyclops' eye in her own chamber she would watch them on their way, bitter and malignant thoughts gathering in her breast ; and as they sauntered arm-in-arm under the summer sun, or were lost to sight beneath the sheltering trees, followed them with muttered maledictions. Eva had robbed her of that man's love, and he had rejected hers. Let them look out ! She would sit some days and brood for hours over her love and hate ; at other times, when they had passed beyond the range of vision, she would glide downstairs noiselessly, attired in robes of green or brown too soft to hold a rustle, open the unused closet-door beneath the hall-stairs (which turned on well-oiled hinges), and was out through the sly foxhole, whilst the servants believed her shut up in her chamber. On such occasions, she gave strict orders she was on no account to be disturbed, and Miss Wearbank's orders were never disobeyed. Whatever her errand, she went and came unseen and unsus pected, never emerging from the door beneath the stairs if a footstep lingered near. Once in the hall, her presence was a matter of course. At times the maids were startled by findino her close upon them unawares, but beyond a passing remark to each other on her disagreeably noiseless tread, no further observation was made. Mr. Raeburn had issued instructions for the clearance of leaves and litter from the several paths most remote from the dwelling, hitherto overlooked, and that afternoon took a circuit of the \"planting\" to ascertain how far his com mands had been carried out. With a basket on her arm, fairy-like as herself, Eva tripped"], [239, "THE SHED IN THE DINGLE. 227 on with a buoyant dancing step, now before her husband, now loitering behind to gather the wild hyacinths and late primroses which carpeted the wood with waving blue and stars of paly gold; then, as the path widened, she crept closely and cosily to his side, clasping both her dainty hands across his arm with a childlike trust and confidence all the more delightful to behold because a full-hearted woman's love prompted the involuntary action. They had entered . the \"planting\" near the carriage-gate, and skirting the high road which lay two, three, or four feet beneath them, according to the undulation of the very billowy woodland, reached a cart-track and wooden gate, close to the boundary of the estate on the southern side, not a hundred yards from that of the county hospital. Here he stopped to speak to a man raking rubbish together for a comrade to pitch into a cart, which blocked up the road. The horse, drowsily blinking in the sunshine, was admonished to give place to the lady ; the rough men doffed their caps respectfully as she passed, her white dress glinting in the light, and they blessed her bonnie face when she was gone. Frank, prouder of her than of house, or name, or lands, felt the untutored homage, and his heart echoed the blessing, as he followed once more under umbrageous trees the white robe which, flecked with dancing shadows, led him on like a banner on a battle-field. But here there were no contending warriors to oppose, only here and there a drooping branch, which his ready hand raised or set aside, and for the serried ranks of armed men, the foxglove's nodding plume, and the broad umbels of the meadow-sweet, high as her shoulder, alone hedged her in, as she trod the narrow tortuous path (almost impassable for dock and burdock leaves) down to a romantic dingle, through which wimpled the streamlet as gently as if no noisy cascade had ever broken its repose. Sloping upwards rose the southern extremity of the curving hill, which, like an amphitheatre, embosomed Tower and grounds."], [240, "228 STUNG TO THE QUICK. Larch and pine, birch and mountain ash, clothed the steep banks, rich with luxuriant undergrowth, through which a network of brown earthy lines ran in all directions to tempt adventurous footsteps. But the paths were narrow and often treacherous, intersected with knobby roots of trees, swart and bare, to trip the unwary wanderer; and in places the earth had fallen away, leaving scarcely room for a foot weightier or wider than a wood nymph's. Yet Eva proposed to complete the circuit of the grounds, and thread these winding footways. The stream had to be crossed ere she could mount the hill, and the plank bridge had been removed. Strolling by the bank in search of a narrow stepping place, they came in sight of an old tumble down wooden hut in the most secluded nook of the dingle. The planks were falling from the rusty nails, the door hung on one red hinge, moss and lichens crept over the grey roof, and fungus hid under the nettles and the bracken which curled and waved round the decaying foundation. \" I thought I told Robson to knock that old shed down and cart it away!\" exclaimed Mr. Raeburn, surprised to see it standing. \" Oh, yes, Frank ; but Rhoda said it was a pity to pull down the picturesque old tool-house, and begged it might be spared, \" interposed Eva, apologetically. \" And so Robson gallantly obeyed the lady's orders, \" resumed her husband, very quietly, but with a slight con traction of his brow and a compression of lip. \"Yes; for Rhoda wishes to make a sketch of it, and begged it might be spared this summer, at least. We have outgrown our terror of the spot. \" \"Terror?\" \"Yes! this is the place where crazy Jem was found dead. You remember I told you the poor fellow's story. \" Mr. Raeburn remembered ; but as he stopped close to the hut, and stood regarding it in deep thought without a word,"], [241, "THE SHED IN THE DINGLE. 229 Eva drew near, and laying her hand upon his arm, asked \u2014 \" What are you considering so seriously, Frank ? \" He closed his disengaged hand upon her clasping fingers, and looking down into her upturned face, replied gravely \u2014 \" I was considering whether an Englishman ought to have two wives, my Eva. \" \" Is that all ? What an absurd idea ; you looked so solemn I thought there was something serious in your mind, \" and Eva laughed as musically as the water tinkling at her feet. \" Not so absurd, my wee wifie. I have been rather uncer tain lately whether I have one wife or two, and the position is, to say the least, unpleasant. \" \" What nonsense y*ou are talking this afternoon, Frank, looking all the while as sober as a judge. And pray, Mr. Gravity, who may be the two wives, real or imaginary ? Don't you think that is a very proper question ? \" \" Very* proper; for I have been debating whether I mar ried Miss Marsh or Miss Wearbank, or both. My only wed ding-ring I placed on this dear little finger, all my love centres on this darling head, and this dearly cherished form reposes nightly in my arms ; but Rhoda is at the head of my household, directs and controls with the authority of a wife \u2014 and henceforth my perplexing doubts. \" \" Now, Frank, that is really very unkind of you. I am glad Rhoda does not hear how little value you set on her generous services. Here she has been studying how to please you, giving her attention to trivialities which used to be her abhorrence, just to relieve me from all trouble and anxiety, so that I may be at liberty to accompany you wheresoever you wish, and you make it a reason for displeasure. \" \" And a very cogent reason for displeasure, when I see my wife coolly superseded by one who has neither the claim of mature experience nor actual relationship to sup port the position. \" If Frank had but seen the clenched hand, the set teeth, and gleaming eyes behind that broken shutter."], [242, "230 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \" But I am not superseded, my dear Frank. Rhoda would not think of such a thing. She has my keys lest anything should be required in my absence, and she sees that my orders are properly executed, that is all. For my part, I think we are greatly indebted to her, and I have been wondering how I could repay so much thoughtful con sideration. \" \" My innocent little wifie ; Rhoda is fond of dominion, jealous of power, and having no wider sphere of action wrests the domestic sceptre from your yielding hands, to be queen-regnant of the Grey Tower, with ourselves for her devoted vassals. \" There was something of angry sarcasm in the tone and curl of his expressive lip as this sentence was rounded, but it changed to tender earnestness as Eva answered deliberately \u2014 \" That supposition presupposes helplessness, inactivity, or imbecility on the part of your wife. You are certainly not very complimentary to either of us, but I must say I prefer Rhoda's portrait to my own.\" With a glance which was itself a disclaimer of all covert reproach, Frank drew her slight form close in his embrace, ruthlessly crushing her dainty straw-hat and frail basket, scattering the collected flowers on the grass, as he raised her face to look steadily in her eyes during his reply. \" My sweet wifie, there is neither imbecility nor indolence in you, but a fund of guilelessness and good-nature easily imposed upon. In age there can be little difference between yourself and Miss Wearbank; but, otherwise, you in plastic simplicity remain a child, whilst she is a prematurely-devel oped woman \u2014 and a mistress of finesse. Thus she rules and controls without your suspecting it, less as a kindly deputy than a despot.\" \" Oh, Frank, this is ungenerous ! \" \" Not so, my love. I have observed that whether you propose a dress or a dinner, Miss Rhoda suggests one amend ment after another until the final order is hers, not yours."], [243, "THE SHED IN THE DINGLE. 231 Stop ! do not interrupt me. If visitors are announced, Miss Rhoda advances to receive them, and she equally decides and dictates what invitations shall be given or accepted. Can you make a purchase or a morning call without her counsel or support ? Not only do the maids look to her for instructions or for holidays, but when I ask groom or gar dener a reason for an unusual vagary, I am answered, ' Miss Wearbank ordered.' As a final touch, my own command to Robson is invalidated, and I am forced to the conviction that Miss Wearbank's will is conclusive.\" \" I cannot think Rhoda countermanded your order inten tionally, Frank; but you know how partial she is to anything romantic or picturesque, and I dare say she spoke without any thought beyond the preservation of the hut, which really is a feature in the scene \u2014 at least to an artistic eye.\" \"You are a sturdy little advocate for an absent friend, Eva; but I am not convinced. However, as I do not care to maintain my supremacy in the first instance by active discourtesy to a lady, let the rotten shed stand, even at the risk of harbouring vagrants.\" \" But you surely would not be discourteous to a lady in any instance, would you ? \" and Eva looked up with winning archness. \"Well, that depends,\" said he, deliberately. \" If the lady were to forget my claims as a gentleman, and my rights in my own domain, it is very possible I might. You have never provoked my temper, darling, for it lies deep and under control; but like my unfortunate father I have a live coal in my heart; smouldering, it serves to give warmth to love and friendship; blown to a blaze, it is \u2014 neither polite nor proper.\" \" You will never be angry with me, Frank, will you ? I should break my heart if you were,\" asked Eva, beseechingly, awed by something in her husband's face. \"Never, never, darling; I love you too well. But remem ber, I must have but one wife ; a second might find me a"], [244, "232 STUNG TO THE QUICK. very disagreeable fellow. And now let me help you over the brook ; we have stood talking under the shade of this beech, until I fear your feet will be damp through those thin slippers. \" Yes, talking treason against a very \" Royal dame, \" interrupted Frank, pleasantly. \"Well, royal or loyal, it is treason, I am sure. So now help me to pick up all the flowers you have not trampled to pulp, and then I will graciously permit you to lift me across the burn, and afterwards lead you such a dance over the bank and under the trees home. And mind if you stumble once, I shall inflict a heavy fine. A new pair of kid gloves every time you trip; so be careful.\" A keen eye, peering through a rift in the parting planks, followed their ascent up the bank until they were lost in the summer wealth of leaves. Then Rhoda emerged from the hut, creeping through the half-open door so warily as not to displace or rend a long deserted spider-web stretching from door to post and lintel. What did Rhoda in that secluded spot? Surely she had not gone to sketch, and retreated before advancing footsteps merely to play the eavesdropper ? No. Rhoda had business on her hands; business requiring all her leisure, tact, and ingenuity, and the hut was her chosen retreat. Not chosen for romantic beauty or luxurious retirement, but for its seclusion ; for that tangled path through shrouding underwood which foot rarely trod save her own ; for the death shade clinging to the mouldering ruin, which kept it sacred from other intrusion than that of toad, or bat, or a stray rabbit; for its proximity to the roadside gate, where the cart had stood in Eva's way, as well as to a direct bridle-road leading obliquely from the Tower over the hill to the city, easily gained by the nearest foot-track under the firs on the steep bank. She could not spare the shed as yet, and so had raised her voice to bar its demolition; unaware that its owner,"], [245, "THE SHED IN THE DINGLE. 233 under his equable face and gentlemanlike demeanour, had power to discriminate, and a tendency to resist intrusion on his prerogative. She knew it now, and as she replaced in a large, rough, hingeless box, which had once held garden tools, sundry very different appliances of her own \u2014 fashionable garments, cosmetics, and all other requisites for an elaborate toilet \u2014 she muttered angrily that those loitering, chattering, love-sick fools had left her no time, she would be too late for her appointment, and might as well return to the house before she was missed. \" I shall be there first, my friends, and ready to receive the mistress of the mansion, never fear. The lady-wife who must not be superseded, the 'guileless innocent' who can do no wrong.\" And thus she communed with her wicked self, as she pursued a path which opened near the waterfall. \"And so he has a live coal in his heart; it must be my care it blazes \u2014 aye, if it consume them both. And so he has been measuring me while I thought him indifferent and unobservant, measuring me with eyes that seem to pass one by; not like that Dr. Grove, who peers from under penthouse brows, and reads one's face like a label; but, thanks to my retreat, I have a clue to guide me. Let the wife rule whilst her reign lasts. I must not lose my footing here for the distinguished honour of controlling Jane or Betty. And so he scorns me \u2014 not even a relative. No ; I have darker, warmer blood in my veins than the pale serum tinging his dainty wife.\" She paused a moment. \"Yet she defended me; she loves and trusts me. Have I no ruth? She would not harm me, \u2014 but she has harmed me. She has come between me and my love. But for her fair face, I might have won Frank Raeburn \u2014 I might have been queen-regnant here indeed. The sinful fire within my breast had then died out for lack of fuel. As Mrs. Raeburn, raised above the petty crew whose scoffs first roused the spirit of revenge, I had merged the feeling in contempt and let them go."], [246, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 234 But now I have no ruth. What I have suffered, they shall suffer. I feel the passionate love for Frank fast curdling into hate \u2014 and yet, and yet \u2014 what would I not do to win from him one loving look, such as he wasted but now on Eva. I know I am plotting wickedness, but I have just cause\u2014 I have, I have. An outcast's child, I hold my own on sufferance; but I will hold it by my own strong hand hereafter.\" Before Mr. and Mrs. Raeburn had reached even the rustic bridge near the ravine, Rhoda had stooped to the disguised door, and when they entered the hall, was seated at the piano, playing and singing, \"Woodman, spare that tree.\" \" You appear to have a passion for preserving old timber from the axe, Miss Wearbank,\" said Frank, as he threw himself into a lounge. \" A passion for what, Mr. Raeburn ? I do not comprehend you,\" fell from the lips of the singer, as she turned round on the music stool and confronted the speaker with wondering eyes. \" I referred to the tree in your sentimental ditty, and to a certain old shed in the \" \"Oh, dear me, yes; I had quite forgotten it \u2014 Crazy Jem's hut, to be sure ! Ah, I heard Robson say the picturesque old ruin was to be removed, and being most desirous to sketch it as it stands, I took the liberty to desire a day or two's delay until I could plead with you for as delicious a bit of scenery as you have on your estate. I should not have presumed to interfere, but the men were setting off with picks and hatchets, and you were not near to appeal to. I hope I have not exceeded my province, or presumed too far on your willingness to oblige a lady.\" \" Confound it, this woman might be a witch, diving into one's secret thoughts. However, she is not quite so do mineering as I supposed,\" glanced through Mr. Raeburn's mind, prompting him to say graciously enough, \" So Eva told me, and I will see that your delicious bit of scenery remains for your pencil.\""], [247, "DR. GROVE'S TREATMENT OF TEMPORARY INSANITY. 235 \"Oh, thank you. I should have been so sorry to lose it.\" And so, with no more thanks than if the hut had been a mere subject for an artist, the matter dropped, like a lady's veil. CHAPTER XXIX. DR. GROVE'S TREATMENT OF TEMPORARY INSANITY. There are always plenty of kind good friends ready to acquaint us with whatsoever other friends, equally kind and good, say to our disadvantage; and so Mrs. Hesketh, by the unvarying process, had been made to comprehend what \" all Durham thought of her \" when Jack Fortescue's death startled the gossips, and his foppish but firm friend, Mr. Lighthead, insisted that Mrs. Hesketh's precious picnic was the primary cause. Of course it oozed out why the disastrous party was pro jected, and after the scheme failed, every busybody whose fingers had been in the delectable pie drew them forth, wiped them very clean, and denied a knowledge of the condiments. Even Mrs. Coulson (who had mapped out the plan) deserted her friend, was horribly shocked at the catas trophe, held up her pure hands in pious deprecation, and maintained, \" If Mrs. Hesketh had taken my advice, the poor young man would not have been sacrificed.\" Shunned by all the immaculate people who detested mis chief-makers and never indulged in slander themselves, some what conscience-stricken at the untimely end of her comic bard, which, to use her own word s, \" everyone laid at her door,\" and made of no account in her own house, Mrs. Hesketh underwent a course of penance and humiliation for several months which would have tamed the spirits of most women; and so long as her friends held aloof, so long as people exchanged significant glances when she passed them"], [248, "236 STUNG TO THE QUICK. in the street, there were symptoms of conformity with the will of Mr. Hesketh, and sociality with his pleasant maiden sister. But when the nine days' wonder died out, when Mrs. Hesketh's friends forgot her failings, and remembered her, when Mrs. Coulson made advances towards reconciliation, the old spirit of self-assertion made itself seen and felt. The presence of Miss Dorothea at the wedding, from which she was excluded, was the culminating point of jealous indignation. She had long made the important discovery that hysterics and violent outbursts of temper were alike undesirable, since the .coldwater cure adopted in the former case was not only an uncomfortable remedy, but destructive to millinery, whilst the provoking coolness of Miss Dolly, who persisted in compassionating her unfortunate mania, and could never think of quarrelling with a poor creature so affected, rendered her rage innocuous, even whilst it exasperated her the more. But that day her spleen overmastered her discretion, and when in the evening Mr. Hesketh and Miss Dorothea, beaming with delight, returned, bringing Dr. Grove in their train, they were saluted on the threshold by Betty with the exclamation \u2014 \" Aw's downreet thenkful yez coomed hyem, maister ; there's bin sech a shine. Missis hez bin i' sech tantrums, there's no biding wi' her. She's clouted maw lugs, 1 an' yammered 2 away like auld Clootie's 3 ain sister.

GROVE'S TREATMENT OF TEMPORARY INSANITY. 237 rang all the changes from a glad welcome to sullen resolution before Mr. or Miss Dolly Hesketh could be heard. \" What's the matter now ? \" enquired the former. \"You should not speak in that way of your mistress, Betty,\" said the latter, deprecatingly. \" Well, nowther should aw, an' sh'd let yen alyen * ; but maw patience is nut as lung as yors, Miss Dolly, an' aw cannut bide it.

Aw dinnet see that, and if she wur to kill some yen in her tantrums, aw reckon nowther judge nor jury 'ud see it owther.\" \"Perhaps not, Betty,\" half assented Miss Dolly; \"but ill-tempered people trouble themselves more than they trouble others ; and I, for one, am sorry for them. But where is Miss Lucy ? \" \" Oh, Mess Lewsie's oop-steers, nigh as bad as her minny, glumpin' and freetin' ower summat. Aw niver seed sech wark, an' wi' gentlefolks, tee!\" and Betty, muttering her discontent, moved about the kitchen, into which the old lady had followed her when the gentlemen turned into the parlour. \" Well, my good girl, we must try to make the best of it; we have all of us our shortcomings to answer for. Place the cold ham and fillet of veal on the table, and let both be garnished with crisp parsley. The doctor will remain to supper. Are your potatoes ready?\" \" Nut yet ; but aw scraped them lung syne, an' th' wayter's bilin, so th' 'taters ull de while aw lay the claith,\" answered * One alone."], [250, "238 STUNG TO THE QUICK. the rough, but well-meaning woman, putting a quantity of early potatoes into the saucepan as she spoke. \" Very well, that will do ; and now I will go upstairs to take off my things, and see what is the matter with my niece, while you get everything ready.\" So saying Miss Dolly trotted off on her double errand, past the parlour door, whence issued sounds of angry alter cation, to an upper chamber, where she found Lucy sitting sulkily in the deep twilight, by the window. She had got the key to Lucy's heart, and with the oil of gentleness passed it smoothly into the twisted wards, sympathising with her distress, which was real, and rebuking the pique and envy which made her at once miserable and unamiable; thus the good aunt alternately soothed her irritation and encouraged a better state of feeling. After a while she was successful, and by the time the white cottage bonnet (to which the old lady clung, in spite of fashion) was duly dusted, covered with a pocket hand kerchief, and placed in its pasteboard bandbox, the Canton shawl shaken, folded in the original creases, and laid in tissue paper withm the lavendered drawer, and a fair muslin apron placed as a protector in front of her grey satin dress, Lucy was ready to accompany her, and meet the father of her inconstant swain. Their entrance into the room where the supper was laid was a signal for the renewal of a storm which had slightly subsided. Starting to her feet, Mrs. Hesketh assailed the kindly old maiden with a torrent of vituperative epithets; she was a barefaced hypocrite, an insidious serpent, who had robbed her of her friends and was now in league with her enemies, who had sneaked into the house to make mischief and misery, who had treated her worse than her brute of a husband, &c, &c. Miss Dorothea, unprepared for this sudden attack, her clear eyes dilating with sorrowful surprise, arrested in her walk towards the table, stood amazed and with uplifted hands, only uttering and repeating \u2014"], [251, "DR. GROVE'S TREATMENT OF TEMPORARY INSANITY. 239 \"Deary me, deary me! what can this all be about? \u2014 what can this all be about?\" \" My dear madam, pray restrain yourself; this language is unseemly,\" interposed Dr. Grove, endeavouring to calm the virago. \" Maria, I'll thank you to keep a civil tongue in your head towards my sister!\" cried Mr. Hesketh. \" Mamma, I am positively ashamed of you \u2014 this is most disgraceful!\" exclaimed her daughter. All spoke at once, and Mrs. Hesketh, unable to answer all at once, grew livid with passion, as she stormed out, to each in turn, \" Keep your advice for your patients, I don't -want it! \u2014 you know well enough what it's about, flaunting at the wedding whilst that beggar's brat laughed me to scorn. I saw it all! As for you, miss, currying favour with your precious aunt, I'll give you some thing to be ashamed of \u2014 take that!\" hurling at Lucy a large tumbler, snatched at random from the table. Lucy instinctively swerved ; the glass whizzed past her ear and through the open doorway, smashing itself and a valuable porcelain vase on the hall-table, narrowly missing Betty, who was bringing in the potatoes and ale. Jug and dish both went to the ground in the woman's fright, but without pausing to pick up fragments, she darted into the room, obedient to Dr. Grove's loud call, \"Betty!\" The doctor had sprung behind Mrs. Hesketh, and pinioned her arms to her sides. \" Here, Betty ! hold this madwoman's feet, whilst I secure her arms. Hesketh, your handkerchief; now tie her hands, so ; now her feet ; take Betty's apron, or one of these thingummys will do (nodding towards an anti macassar); we must secure her, she is dangerous. You see, Mrs. Hesketh, I have kept my advice for my patient.\" Infuriated before, the cool determination of the doctor and his summary treatment acted like oil on fire. She foamed with impotent rage, which culminated, as of old, in hysterics."], [252, "240 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \" Cut her staylace, Betty. Miss Dorothy, where are your scissors? There, that will do; now, lay her on the ground; she will come round presently. Miss Lucy, I will trouble you for a basin of cold water, or stay \u2014 we must not saturaet her clothes \u2014 bring a wet towel instead.\" Lucy glanced towards Betty, who was holding Mrs. Hesketh down, as if she thought the servant was the one to be sent; but the order came from Dr. Grove, and so she went for the towel, which he (not applying it as a cooling bandage) beat across the face of the screaming woman several times smartly. As she began to revive, the doctor said, \" Betty, you had better clear the broken glass and crockery from the hall at once; we shall have to carry your mistress upstairs, and might cut our shoes or feet.\" Betty stared at the order, but rose to obey, grumbling, however, all the way she went for her broom. \" What mawk's this? Carry her oop-stairs ! aw think she mought walk oop on her own pins. She's walked oop afore after her high-streeks. But aw niver seed her hev sae bad a bout afore. Aw wonder if that doctor diz think ut messis is demented. He's a quare chap that, aw connet mak him oot.\" Whilst Betty, sweeping up the debris, drowned her frag mentary muttering in the clatter and jingle of the fragments on the floor-cloth, the bustle within the room subsided ; an angry \" Ugh ! \" \" Umph ! \" or an occasional sob or sharp scream alone betraying that Mrs. Hesketh had recovered her senses and was perfectly cognisant of all that was said. At the outset the doctor had glanced significantly at Mr. Hesketh and his sister; while the former, placing his buff slippered feet on the fender, leaned back outstretched in his easy-chair in his favourite attitude, with his elbows on the padded arms, making bellows-shapes with expanded thumbs and forefingers, as if he had no interest whatever in the proceedings. Miss Dorothea, on the contrary, appeared concerned \u2014 not"], [253, "DR. GROVE'S TREATMENT OF TEMPORARY INSANITY. 241 so much alarmed for her sister-in-law, as shocked at the outbreak which had put niece and servant both in jeopardy, and distressed at this unwomanly display. Lucy had been startled from the unamiab'.e dreaminess in which she entered the room by her mother's sharp words ; but the whiz of the tumbler past her ear, so closely cutting through the air that her tawny ringlets drifted aside, and she almost felt the cool contact of the glass, sent her back into bewilderment, from which the confusion of screams and sobs, commands and flitting feet scarcely aroused her. She cleared a space to lay her struggling mother down, and went for the wet napkin with a dim perception of the doctor's resolute promptness, and a consciousness that obedience was imperative; but for what followed she was utterly unpre pared, as being a new climax to hysterical passion. \" Have you a narrow bed in the house, Miss Dorothea ? \" \"Only Betty's; all the rest are four-post or tent beds.\" \" That will do. The patient will have to be strapped down, lest she should do herself, or some one else, an injury. I am afraid of a return of the paroxysm. Betty, come and assist me to carry your mistress to your bed.\" \"Don't trouble yourself, doctor; I can help the lass,\" said Mr. Hesketh, rising from his seat, with a curious twinkle in his eye. \" Nonsense, Hesketh ; I don't want you for a patient. Why, man, the exertion might induce apoplexy, and that would be worse than a score fits of hysteria. Betty and I will manage it.\" And Betty and he did manage it, in spite of the strug gles and protests of the dame, who found her tongue once more. The imperturbable doctor disregarded all her asseverations that she was better, that she could walk, that she would not be treated like a lunatic. He only shook his head, and calmly issued his commands to remove the bed and place her on the mattress, dressed and bound as she was. Then, R"], [254, "242 STUNG TO THE QUICK. with strong sheets, he fastened her down himself, next felt her head and pulse, and, after standing for a moment or two looking steadfastly at her from under thoughtful brows, he removed his hand from his mouth and spoke to Miss Dorothea and those by the bedside : \u2014 \" The patient's pulse is full and rapid, her head hot, and her mind evidently disordered. She must be kept cool; on no account disturbed ; must have no food but gruel or arrow root. If her lips appear parched, give a spoonful or two of lemonade ; nothing stimulating, as you value her recovery . She must be kept low, and fed in small quantities at cer tain intervals. You will pay no attention whatever to her ravings, however lucid they may appear. I will leave a prescription, which you will please to have compounded immediately. Administer as directed. Should I not find her calmer in the morning, bleeding may be necessary; and it is more than probable the head will require shaving in order that a blister may be applied to the scalp. And now, my dear madam, I leave you with your excellent nurse, Miss Dorothea, and trust on my next visit to find the fever abated and the nerves stilled.\" He turned to leave the room, followed by all but the furious patient, but paused at the door to say, \" Miss Lucy, you had better watch your mother until she has her medi cine. If you are alarmed, Betty can remain with you after wards.\" \" Put your bonnet on, Betty, that's a good lass, and run to the chemist's over the bridge,\" said Miss Dorothea, as she stepped after Dr. Grove downstairs to supply him with writing materials. There were three grave faces in the parlour when Betty presented herself \"for the paiper,\" but they relaxed when the door was closed on the active woman. Even Miss Dorothea had an uncommonly expressive smile playing about her mouth, whilst the doctor chuckled to him self quietly, and Mr. Hesketh gave way to a burst of merri-"], [255, "DR.

I could see she winced at the bare suggestion of a bald head. Let her be treated as if really insane, kept fastened down all to-morrow, and I prophesy she will be tame enough henceforth. Lucy had a narrow escape ; one inch nearer and she would have been disfigured for life, if not killed. Better be strapped down on an pallet than tried for man slaughter, or even a common assault.\" \"You are a first-rate friend in an emergency, doctor. Had not you been there we should have had a scene of quite another sort; and if any more such trifles had gone flying about the room, it is very possible there might have been a case for the coroner, or at all events for the mayor. I'm thankful it's no worse,\" and Mr. Hesketh wiped from his forehead the dew conjured up by his own imagination. \" Do take your seats, gentlemen,\" urged Miss Dorothea, \"you must want supper. I am afraid you will have to dis pense with potatoes,\" she continued, \"they went \" \"You need not apologise, my dear Miss Dorothea. I saw more than one or two of the esculent roots come danc ing in at the door. Betty's broom will find them in the morning, no doubt. Thank you, that will suffice.

She will not forget the taste of temper-physic in a hurry.\" There was no need of bleeding, or blistering, or shaving; the refractory patient was as calm as a baby in the morn ing, and though she pulled many a wry face, took every dose of her medicine without a murmur. What would Mrs. Coulson, or the Caldcleughs, or the Ords say, if her head were"], [256, "244 STUNG TO THE QUICK. shaved ? Good gracious ! she should go really out of her mind if she were so shamefully disfigured. And nobody would believe her if that horrid doctor got in a word. Why should people believe him more than anyone else, she would like to know? And so her thoughts ran on, but the fear of Mrs. Grundy and the doctor prevailed \u2014 a silent testimony to the physi cian's character. He had said ; and she knew, if there had been the shadow of wildness visible in the morning, what he said would be done, and no one would question his treatment. As she continued passive, the linen fetters were first slackened, then removed ; then she was permitted to return to her own soft bed ; next to stray downstairs ; but all under the most vigilant supervision, as if those around her really considered her a convalescent lunatic, liable to relapse. As for Lucy and Betty, not being in the secret, they thought passion had truly turned her brain, and that care and caution were indeed indispensable. Moreover, both took a leaf from the doctor's lesson-book, to be conned in secret to their own advantage; the corollary being, that unbridled passion was liable to lapse into insanity. Not that their thoughts shaped themselves into words, but conscience gave sundry sharp pricks to both, and pricked Betty the hardest, because her self-knowledge was truest; not that her temper was the worst, by any means. Never had Mrs. Hesketh been so amiable since her mar riage. The shivered porcelain jar, which had been her pride and glory and the envy of her friends, had a volume of reproach in every fragment. What if the glass had hit Lucy with the same force? She shivered at the bare suggestion, and ordered Betty to carry the broken pieces away, unaware they had been left to tell their own story and hers. So she came down from her stilts once more,' and as no"], [257, "lucy's new lover. 245 allusions were made to anything more than illness, she found her path smoothed considerably. Even when Miss Dorothea took up the theme of Rhoda's accomplishments, ignorant that it was a disagreeable subject, Mrs. Hesketh strove to master or conceal her displeasure, and listened to praises which were more nauseous than the doctor's potion. But she could not help shuffling in her seat, and, in the end, leaving the room, when the old lady began to institute a comparison betwixt Rhoda's playing and Lucy's, and to wish Lucy had had the same advantages. However, she thought it prudent to acquiesce, fully con vinced that her liberty would be endangered if she resisted ; and so she told Mrs. Coulson, adding, \" There is a conspir acy against me; and that Dr. Grove is at the bottom of it.\" Kind Mrs. Coulson said, \"Dear me! dear me! you will have to be very cautious. No doubt you are right, my unfortunate friend.\" And when the green door closed on the unfortunate friend's retreating figure, the sympathising widow touched her forehead mysteriously with her forefinger, and nodding to other and more fortunate friends, said, \" Ah, touched, touched. Poor thing! poor thing!\" Dr. Grove was above suspicion. CHAPTER XXX. LUCY'S NEW LOVER. Thoroughly interested in the fortunes of the young couple whose nuptials she had witnessed, and whose wedding-day had been made so memorable by her sister-in-law's intem perate rage, Miss Dorothea made a point of calling at Mr. Marsh's to inquire after the bride and her husband. She seldom saw Rhoda on these occasions, that young"], [258, "246 STUNG TO THE QUICK. lady being fully occupied with her preparations for their reception at the Grey Tower. Whenever she did see her she also saw Edwin Grove dangling at her heels, to the old lady's great chagrin; for Lucy had made her a partial confidante ; and while the good creature began to feel sorry for her niece, she regarded Edwin Grove as a despicable male flirt, which doubtless he was. It is more than probable that Lucy, anxious to learn something more than she could glean elsewhere, inspirited her obliging aunt to a series of visits quite beyond her ordinary habit ; and it is as probable that Miss Wearbank, suspecting this, gave Edwin Grove's attentions their fullest significance in her presence. She played for him, and sang for him, and he, looking very gallant and sentimental, turned over her music, stooped and whispered vague commentaries on the Haynes Bayley verses; not altogether for his own delectation, or for the fair musician's, but, it is to be feared, for that of the maiden aunt in their presence, and for the niece in Old Elvet. So while Rhoda played on her piano, he and she played into each other's hand also; and while Mr. Marsh chuckled and congratulated himself there would be another wedding soon, Miss Dorothea went home and expressed her conviction that Miss Wearbank was witching Edwin's soul away with her music. Miss Dorothea spoke of it before Dr. Grove as a some thing taken for granted, and though that sensible man made no remark beyond \" Pooh-pooh ! \" it is worthy of observation that his son was finally settled as a surgeon in the out-of the-way and uncongenial colliery of Kelloe. He had the good fortune, as well as the good sense, to secure him a home at Trimdon Hall, close to his practice, yet elevated morally, socially, and geographically above the pitmen of Kelloe."], [259, "LUCY'S NEW LOVER. 247 The doctor had no mind that Edwin should marry either Rhoda or Lucy; but of the two it is a question whether Lucy would not have had the preference. He knew, or thought he knew, the worst of her; he did not know the worst of the other, he was convinced. Banishment to Kelloe, that remote black-diamond valley, hid in the winding folds of overlapping hills, must not be considered an infallible antidote to love ; nor were the smutty pit beauties likely to eclipse the remembrance of the brilliant beauty left behind; but the sly old doctor had not left the banished bachelor entirely to his own resources, to lodge and live as he best could, or as his predecessor had done. The worthy tenant of Trimdon Hall, who, under the doctor's influence, had opened his doors to his son, had no daughter ; but he had sundry fair nieces, who risked their necks on roads made for the especial behoof of the coroner, and put their blooming faces in at open doors when least expected. Pleasant this for Edwin Grove, who found his position quite endurable ; though the old square piano was out of tune, and the players out of practice, and the jing ling keys sounded discordantly on his ear and memory whenever touched, which was seldom. Apart from all this, he was something more than a mere squire of dames, and had beneath his outer life an inner one of earnest zeal in the pursuit and duties of his onerous profession, on which his father depended as his safeguard from ennui and meretricious women. This zeal was by no means a common failing amongst colliery surgeons; but Edwin had not become hardened to calculate his responsibilities by his remuneration ; nor was he, as too many of these isolated men are, driven by lack of society to make the decanter his companion; so he studied hard, and did his duty well, ready and at his post night or day, whether required to reduce a fracture or a fever, to ease the coming or the departing life. Now and then fair faces floated before the page he read,"], [260, "248 STUNG TO THE QUICK shutting out letter-press, drawings, and diagrams, but the raven locks and the tawny tresses blent most absurdly, and he turned laughingly from their contemplation as another face arose, and he would say, \"Well, that Maggy Reed is not a bad-looking girl, and she will make a good wife for somebody one of these days.\" He was certainly not breaking his heart for either Lucy or Rhoda. He had never troubled himself to analyse his own emo tions, and with regard to the latter had never considered why his visits were so frequent and regular. He was con scious that Miss Wearbank had been the attraction which had drawn him to the cosy parlour in South Street; her beauty had appealed to his eye, her intelligence to his understanding, her refinement and accomplishments complet ing the charm. It had been wonderfully pleasant to sit and listen to the melody of her voice, whether in song or speech, and to look in her dangerously beautiful eyes: but he never paused to ask himself if he had any ulterior objects in his obsequious attentions beyond present amusement. Openly, Edwin had shaken off his allegiance to Lucy; but in the remote \u2014 very remote \u2014 chambers of his heart, he held the bond uncancelled. He plumed himself on the skill with which he had taught the young flirt a lesson ; and if she profited by it, he might possibly be induced to forgive her, after due submission. When his roving eye had rested on quiet and unobtrusive Maggy Reed, during her brief stay in Durham, he gave a few odd moments to the study and contemplation of the young and unconscious girl, who he could see would develop into a fine woman; and thereupon paid her a number of silly and unmeaning compliments (when Miss Wearbank was not by), and when she blushed from a displeasure he could not comprehend, he concluded she was fascinated with his very agreeable self."], [261, "LUCY'S new lover. 249 So like an Oriental sultan, he waited, handkerchief in hand, until he had made his election, not doubting but the maiden on whose fortunate shoulders it might finally alight would rise rejoicing to do him homage as her lord and master. But removal from a lounging life to an active one, at a distance from the rival fair ones, where there was no one to pique and no one to please, put flattery and flirtation at a dis count, and when in course of time he contemplated a possible life remote from fashion and folly, with little or no social inter course, he began to consider not which he should marry, but which would be willing to marry him. The young gentleman's pride and vanity received a very wholesome check during his contemplation of the subject. Long before he solved the question to his satisfaction, long before even he put it to himself, a change which never entered into his calculations came over the damsel he designed to honour, and altered the whole aspect of affairs. Miss Dorothea's rooted conviction that Rhoda's sole enchant ment lay in her vocal and musical powers had weight with her niece, who thereupon had her piano tuned, and practised most assiduously to attain the same excellence. Carried away with the belief that Miss Wearbank's pro ficiency arose from her teachers more than from native talent or natural powers, Lucy besieged her father as before told to let her have lessons from the first eminent Italian or German master who came within reasonable distance of Durham. Mrs. Hesketh, desiring to make amends and induce Lucy to forget the glass throwing, seconded these appeals, and the father, partly to escape persecution, and partly to offer a premium for better behaviour, gave his consent. Lo and behold ! as though conjured up by his unthinking concession, the Durham Chronicle on the following Friday contained this advertisement: \u2014"], [262, "250 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \"SIGNOR RONCHETTI, of the opera houses of Florence and Milan, and the nobility's concerts, will visit Durham once each week during the sum mer months, to give lessons in singing to advanced pupils. The Signor may be consulted with reference to terms, &c, on the afternoon of Tuesday the 28th inst., at the Waterloo Hotel, Durham, between the hours of four and five.\" Miss Hesketh was by no means the only young lady in the city ambitious to overtop her friends; and to study vocalization under an eminent Italian professor was certainly an enviable distinction. (This was many years ago, good reader, but the remark might possibly hold good even with the extra railroad facilities of to-day.) Consequently the Signor held quite a levee in his private-room that sultry June afternoon. Urged by sister, daughter, and wife (who had begun to swim with the home stream in order to conciliate), Mr. Hesketh very reluctantly accompanied Lucy to see the illustrious foreigner, who, as Mr. Marsh phrased it, had come to exchange shaky Italian notes for good English ones. In the lobby and on the staircase they met several ladies, with chagrin on their countenances. \"The Signor is not over courteous,\" said one. \" His terms are exorbitant,\" added another. \" I don't think he knows how to teach,\" jerked out a third. \"Sour grapes,\" murmured Mr. Hesketh, as he stepped up the familiar staircase, and met Miss Robson radiant with success. \"Oh, Mr. Hesketh,\" exclaimed the stately old maid, \"you will find the Signor such a delightful person to treat with, so affable, so distingue\" \u2014 so \u2014 so \" \"Is he a good teacher, Miss Robson, do you think? You will know more of that than I shall,\" quoth the old gentleman, caring less for the Signor's affability than for his ability. \" Of that, Mr. Hesketh, you may be assured, or I should"], [263, "lucy's new lover. 251 not have engaged the services of the Signor for my estab lishment. His terms are certainly high,\" said Miss Robson, loftily. \" Oh, I come prepared to pay the piper, as my friend Marsh said I should. I know these foreign fellows have the assurance to ask three times what an honest Englishman would ; and all because there are to be found fools like myself willing to pay more for their whistle than it is worth.\" \" Mr. Hesketh, you surprise me ! I thought you were above these narrow-minded prejudices,\" and the speaker bridled, considering her own judgment impugned. \" Pocket prejudice is strong in most men, my good lady ; but come, Lucy, we are detaining Miss Robson. Let us see for ourselves what the Signor is like.\" Like a dark, handsome, middle-sized man, with a straight, well-shaped nose, rather full in the nostril ; lips shaded by a moustache, black as his thick crop of clustering curls ; a rim of whisker which swept beneath the chin from ear to ear, level eyebrows that almost met, and a resolute chin on which perked the foppish imperial. Bright, and full, and black were the Italian's eyes, yet was he compelled to wear spectacles to modify sight strong, but defective, in that it was \"near.\" He wore a dark blue frockcoat, braided and frogged like the front of a lady's dress, and over a chair beside him, although it was June, hung a handsome circular cloak, in all the glory of heavy tassels, velvet facings and collar. The Signor was evidently expensive in his habits. The door was at once opened to admit Mr. Hesketh and Miss Lucy, and to dismiss Mrs. Caldcleugh and her daugh ter, a raw girl of sixteen. Signor Ronchetti was speaking rapidly in very imperfect English. \" I cannot, matam, I cannot make one voice ; you daugh tare nevair sing, she vat you call skreetch ; I teach sing, I no make voice. I should vaiste time and steals your monies.\""], [264, "252 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \" Can you not give her a short lesson or two \u2014 say quarter of an hour ? I do not mind what I pay.\" \" Me dear laity, you could not pay me ears. I could not bear it, madame; your daughtare's voice would make me shuddare.\" And the Signor shuddered as if under a painful reminiscence. \" I am ver sorry. Addio.\" The graceful bow which greeted the entrance of Mr. and Miss Hesketh served also to usher Mrs. Caldcleugh and her daughter out, doubly discomfited and mortified because that chit Lucy heard all the fellow's insolence. \" Signor Ronchetti, I am a plain-spoken Englishman, and think no worse of you for the plain speaking I have just heard.\" The signor bowed. \"Now I am not like Mrs. Caldcleugh, I do mind what I pay, and don't care to waste my money if my* daughter's voice is not worth it. But if you think you can make anything of her, do; of course on your ordinary terms.\" \" I am oblish. Will the young laity honare me by a specimen, a trial.\" So saying the Signor handed Lucy by the tips of her fingers to an upright piano in the room. He then raised several pieces of music close to his spectacles for inspection, and finally placed \" Di tanti palpiti \" before his new pupil. Notwithstanding that she was nervous (for once), Lucy acquitted herself very creditably, and the Italian went into ecstasies. \"Ah, dat will do; dat is someting like a voice, Meess \u2014 Meess,\" he lifted the lady's card to his spectacles, \" Hesket, I shall be ver moch delight vit you. You are one grand contralto. I shall make you sing like one bird in the night \" \" I suppose you mean a nightingale, and not a screech owl, Signor ? \" \" Father ! \" remonstrated Lucy. \" Oh, night-in-gale, certainlies. Miss Hesket have ver good voice.\" \" And now, Signor, as I am a man of business, and know"], [265, "lucy's new lover. 253 nothing of eminent men beyond my own country, in your line I mean, you must pardon me if I ask you if you have any testimonials or vouchers for ability and so on. You are younger than I expected, and a stranger.\" \"Youngaire \u2014 young do not make foolish \u2014 do not make worse singer. Age do not make wise, else why you Inglees say 'Ole fool?' But here are de sufficient vouchares, I tink; \" and the signor handed over a mass of credentials with an air of offended dignity. Mr. Hesketh, half wondering if he were the \"old fool,\" looked over the papers and was satisfied, and then made arrangements which satisfied equally Miss Hesketh and the handsome Italian, who put his hand on his heart and bowed very low as they left the room. The levee was over. Signor Ronchetti stepped into a light phaeton and drove away in the direction of Chester le-Street. Mr. Hesketh returned to his office, not half satisfied that he had consented to pay a guinea and a-half a lesson to a foreigner, when there were English lay-vicars in the city who, in his opinion, would teach her quite as well for a third of the money. Lucy, elated with the compliments of the musician, hur ried home to recount all that had passed, and go into rap tures over the exquisitely charming Italian. How many heart-burnings, how many petty jealousies were kindled by Mr. Hesketh's agreement with Signor Ron chetti. A pretty pass things were coming to when the daughter of a surveyor could learn singing at two guineas a lesson. Well for them he had money to throw away. What the Signor could hear in her voice more than another was a mystery ! Soon it was noised abroad that Mr. Hesketh paid less by half a guinea than the Signor's ordinary terms, just one-half of what the owner of one weak voice and head had offered ineffectually, and thereupon indignation knew no bounds."], [266, "254 STUNG TO THE QUICK. For a teacher to advertise for pupils and afterwards reject them was a thing unprecedented ; there was more in this than met the eye. Mr. Hesketh had better look after his daughter. She was a rather pretty girl, and would have some money, and those foreign music-masters were never to be trusted. And while the disappointed aspirants after musical honours demurred to the Signor's arbitrary method of doing business, and thought it necessary \"to watch his movements in Mr. Hesketh's interest, lest Mr. Hesketh should not, the Signor drove into the city every week. Not always on the appointed day, Tuesday, but certainly the day after, with an apology which, being sufficient for himself, was expected to be sufficient for his pupils. These very eminent personages are so apt to assume the privilege of eccentricity and self-law. Lucy had not a bad voice, and the Signor was undoubtedly a master of first-class ability; so the voice gradually developed, and Mr. Hesketh congratulated himself that he had not thrown his money away. He became quite proud of his daughter's singing, and although in former years he had carefully abstained from all mention of her in Miss Wear bank's hearing, he grew so profuse in his praises of Signor Ronchetti and Lucy's vocal power, that, whether at the Tower or at Mr. Marsh's, he dragged the subject forward on all occasions. Rhoda, probably gratified by the old gentleman's thanks for her advice in favour of an Italian teacher, which had certainly influenced his decision, listened more complacently than her wont, but Mr. Marsh, bored by the incessant recur rence of the same theme, jested and said his friend was music mad. \" Signor Ronchetti is sharp, and you little better than a flat, to give away your good notes for a crotchet of Lucy's. But there is no sympathetic chord in my breast, and I bar the theme, so pray abbreviate and don't disturb the even tenor of our evening's chat; the piano is not your forte.\" And so"], [267, "lucy's new lover. 255 Mr. Marsh would run on, chuckling at every pun, until Mr. Hesketh was glad to drop the subject. Eva, hearing so much of the Signor's extraordinary talents, and sensitively conscious of her inferiority to Rhoda, was, like Lucy, desirous of further cultivation, and wished to embrace so desirable an opportunity as was now offered. But that Mr. Raeburn negatived at once. \"My wife, I prefer nature to art; you won me as you are; you need only retain your natural graces and purity to keep me yours for ever.\" And Eva never expressed the wish again. Under Signor Ronchetti Miss Lucy learned more than music or singing. She had a smattering of French and Italian, and as her teacher spoke English very indifferently, what more natural than that he should revert to his native tongue, and seek to cultivate a taste for the language of Dante and Petrarch. Miss Dorothea, impressed with a wholesome dread of young and handsome foreign musicians, remained discreetly in the room, knitting sections of a counterpane, during the brief lessons ; but, as they interfered with her accustomed siesta, it not unfrequently happened that the heat of the weather and the monotony of the sol-fa induced a doze in her easy chair, and the knitting would become the prey of the kitten, whilst (would it be fair to say ?) her niece became the prey of the cat. At all events Miss Lucy learned something more than music, or even Italian. The Signor had a musical and seductive voice, all the more seductive from its broken utterance; then, his near sight compelled him to bring his mass of scented curls close to his pupil's cheek, as he scanned the notes to which he called attention. Then his soft warm hand came in contact with hers as he placed her fingers in better position. Her music, from the newest operas, was full of tender and impassioned senti ment, and the Signor looked a world of interpretation through"], [268, "256 STUNG TO THE QUICK. the gold-rimmed spectacles with his full and brilliant eyes. Then Petrarch's sonnets found their way to the young lady's hand in all the glory of crimson and gold, and some how the giver contrived to read one or more for the especial behoof of the presentee, and if the language was not wholly intelligible the tones were. The book was carried away and hidden, to be read, as well as possible, in secret. .The Signor was palpably in love with his pupil The gossips for once were right. Mr. Hesketh had need to look after his daughter. But what of the young lady? Had she learnt love as well as singing? That was a question for more than gossip. She was certainly in a flutter at the discovery made by her vanity, and her elation was out of all proportion. Here was a chance to be revenged on Edwin Grove. Oh, if he could but see the impassioned and pleading glances of the Signor! If he could but know his place was better filled; and gradually the fascinating Italian engrossed her thoughts and drove Edwin Grove into the background. Mr. Hesketh, in his office, perusing leases and agreements, or poring over plans, or out in the country measuring estates and roads, or consulting with Mr. Raeburn on the sinking of a new shaft, never thought of the mine sinking at home ; and Miss Dorothea, working away at triangles never con templated by Euclid, alternately knitted and dozed, and forgot her fears of the foreigner. Mrs. Hesketh was simply enchanted ! Signor Ronchetti was the most fascinating man she had ever met, and always so excessively polite to her. The distinction he had made in choosing her daughter as one of his very few pupils was most flattering, and the lady took all the credit to herself, or spoke as if she had done a worthy deed in urging her obstinate husband to engage the Signor. And so nobody concerned thought the handsome music-"], [269, "woman's work. 257 master could possibly exceed the tenor of his bond, and teach love as well as song, except Dr. Grove, who had never seen the attractive singing-master, save when he whirled past in his light phaeton through the narrow streets. But the doctor, who on closer acquaintance began to think there were worse people in the world than Lucy Hesketh, and that her marked improvement in tone, temper, and manner, under her aunt's charge, indicated soil capable of tillage and further improvement; the doctor, remembering the rumours of his son's courtship, probed her heart with banter and raillery about her new music-master, and became unusually inquisitive as to whether she learned singing only. Her replies, framed in pique to reach the son through the father, lacked cleverness, and to the astute old gentleman were perfectly transparent. \" Umph ! \" said he to himself, after one of these trials of skill; \"she is particularly anxious I should rouse the sleeping Cupid under Edwin's waistcoat, by telling him she has got a fresh string to her bow, but I am not such a fool ; the love that is worth having will keep ; they are both young enough, and Lucy may be herself better worth having in a year or two. Certainly she is preferable to Rhoda in my* opinion, and Hesketh's a good fellow himself; but Ned hardly knows his own mind yet, and if this singing fellow should turn the conceited girl's head, it's quite as well he should know nothing about her. He may make a better match where he is.\" CHAPTER XXXI. WOMAN'S WORK. One motive of Mr. Raeburn's for declining an extension of his colliery leases was a sincere desire to ameliorate the condition of the pitmen on his estate, and when, in part- s"], [270, "258 STUNG TO THE QUICK. nership with Mr. Marsh, who had long lacked occupation for mind and body, he commenced operations, he found he had stiff work before him. He had observed, with deep concern, the employment of women and children in the mines, and this he strenuously opposed, alike on the grounds of humanity and civilisation. Lone before the lease fell in, he had made it his business to visit one colliery after another, both on the Wear and on the Tyne, to converse with the men, and note the operation of the whole system. Convinced that utter demoralisation must result from the custom, which degraded women and girls to beasts of burden, and sent them in an unseemly dress into the depths and darkness of the pit, or to labour on the bankside amongst men hardly more coarse than themselves, he determined to resist the employment of female labour. The practice had been abandoned in the Tyneside col lieries for more than half-a-century, but the dregs of the custom still clung to the coal-fields of the Wear, and Mr. Raeburn marked with regret that the Raeburn colliery em ployed more than the average number of females. From the hour when Eva's acceptance of his suit deter mined his stay in England, he had devoted himself to the study of those subjects he believed essential to the full per formance of his . duties as a landowner. If he possessed the soil above and the minerals below, and required labourers to till the one and hew the other for mutual advantage and profit, he did not feel that the compact between the work man and his master ended with labour performed and money paid. He held that his greater information and larger means implied larger responsibilities also, and that the comfort and elevation of those around depended in a great measure on his own energy, influence, and example. Not content to sit down supinely and receive rents and profits from an irresponsible steward or manager, he studied not only the geology of the district and engineering, as con-"], [271, "WOMAN'S WORK. 259 nected with mines, but the habits of the population, and in the last of these studies he associated Eva, both before his marriage and after. Together they had visited one colliery after another, and noted the sensible difference where woman held her piece in the home department, or pursued ferninine occupations, to those where she roughed it with the men, and had no leisure to bestow on soul, body, or mind. Not merely districts, but households could be picked out where the contrasting habits prevailed; and Frank sedulously set himself to work to root out the evil and remodel the Raeburn village. \u2022 It was not quite so easy a task as he had imagined. It is a hard fight, with custom, prejudice, and cupboard for opponents. Before the actual working of the colliery fell into his hands, Mr. Raeburn endeavoured to prepare the minds of the pitmen for the change he contemplated; but when they found their new master refused to admit women into the workings, there was a universal outcry against the innovation; the very women whose benefit was sought being the most clamorous against it. Long usage had familiarised them with things as they were, and blinded them to a perception of the evil. All they could see was the reduction of income and no accession of comfort. Then it was that Eva's tact, delicacy, and good-nature were put to the test. Though she was teaching no new dogma, yet she found it difficult to convince women, accustomed to receive their earnings at the fortnightly pay, that what they could save would overbalance what they could earn. It was a delicate task to point out to the mother of a disorderly brood Of ragged children, in a cottage as disor derly, the polished four-post bedstead, the chest of drawers, surmounted by a large Bible and brilliant tea-tray, the bright chairs, the brass candlesticks and china lamps on the mantel-shelf, or the shining fender and fire-irons beneath, visible through the open door of an opposite neighbour,"], [272, "260 STUNG TO THE QUICK. whose wife had never worked at anything unfeminine, but remained above ground to watch over her children, make the most of her husband's earnings, and preserve comfort and order in his house. Yet Eva accomplished this feat with a delicacy and success her father thought incredible, but which Frank pronounced nothino more than he had expected. At times she met with rebuffs, and in one or two instances was told to \" myend her ain biznes, an' lat ithers gang their ain gate.\" But on the whole her gentle manner, her winning voice, her kindly loving nature, bespoke for her at least a patient hearing, and the trifling presents she distributed amongst the children as rewards for good conduct, cleanliness, or industry, without destroying the self-respect or self-dependence of the recipi ents, went far to effect their end. Rhoda evinced no desire to join her in these expeditions, and, indeed, characterised all their plans as Utopian. Once or twice she was induced to accompany Mrs. Raeburn, but her manner was so excessively patronising, she did more mischief than good, and Eva gladly left her behind ever after. Busied with the drainage and general sanitary improve ment of Raeburn village, which he found little better than a fever nest, with the discontent of pitmen who misunderstood his motives, and overmen who considered peculation a per quisite, and with active thought for the welfare of all con nected with him, Frank Raeburn had little leisure to observe how Rhoda spent her time. As she gradually retired from her domination over the household, she professedly returned to her old passion for drawing; and when Eva stepped into the carriage, bearing with her a basket full of toys, books, silver thimbles, necker chiefs, and cap ribbons; or tripped by her husband's side on an expedition whose object lay nearer home, Rhoda, portfolio in hand, would wander off alone, and remain away for hours. Then a reading mania seized her; piles of novels"], [273, "261 FUEL FOR THE FIRE. came from Mrs. Sutherland's circulating library on Framwell gate Bridge, which she ostensibly devoured in the solitude of her own room. Often would Frank and Eva banter her on her new-born taste for seclusion, which Mr. Marsh declared was conse quent on the loss of her lover, following up the observation with a very unmusical imitation of the Groves of Blarney, or Kelvin Grove, and ending with his customary self-satisfied chuckle. Rhoda bore the raillery very stoically, not wholly con tradicting Mr. Marsh's assertion, nor wholly admitting it, and the consequence was that the three were differently impressed. Frank Raeburn, who was nearest the mark, imagined that, if love drove her into solitude, it was the old love for him self with which she had to battle. Eva, that she was indulg ing a most reprehensible tenderness for Captain Hesketh ; and Mr. Marsh, as he did not scruple to insinuate, that she was pining for the young surgeon whom she saw so seldom since his banishment to Kelloe. CHAPTER XXXII. FUEL FOR THE FIRE. Thus passed June and July. August came and went, scorch ing the foliage and ripening the grain; and September, sickle in hand, cut down the grain and the days together, whilst the married pair, active for the good of others, scarcely noted their flight. And so to none had the months seemed slow but to impatient Rhoda. But September brought the \"Polly,\" and the Polly's master found a letter awaiting him signed \" Eve ; \" a letter"], [274, "262 STUNG TO THE QUICK. imploring her dear Cuthbert to hasten to the Grey Tower, if only for a few hours, as she was dying to see him, and the restraint of her situation and her efforts to disguise her feelings had become insupportable. How many letters bear two interpretations \u2014 locks with separate keys ! To Cuthbert this was the language of love, excessive and vehement, struggling against the fear of offending kind relatives by her rejection of a suitor favoured by* them. True, Dr. Grove had a son whom he had seen at the picnic and the morning after, whose attentions to Rhoda were marked, and whom Mr. Marsh certainly thought an eligible match, though he apparently left matters to take their course, trusting in the doctor's tacit approval, but that letter was conclusive. Cuthbert was a blind reader; only Rhoda's heart held the true key to her missive. The frank seaman, whose education had been completed at a rope's end on shipboard, was no match for the finished schemer. He came ; Frank and Eva were delighted to see him, and Rhoda also. She could not work without tools, and she had craved, longed, for the return of the guileless instrument of her villany, and here he was, her willing, plastic slave. \" You've made a wonderful change here since I was last ashore,\" said Cuthbert to Mr. Raeburn, after they had been chatting some time. \" I should hope so ; there was great need of improvement, I'm sure. Would you like to see what has been done outside? \" asked Frank. \" Nothing would give me greater pleasure, provided the ladies will accompany us,\" answered he. The ladies were agreeable, and the four strolled out together, thus making an opportunity for Cuthbert to offer his arm to Rhoda, and while following in the wake of their companions, to drop behind now and then for a little private"], [275, "263 FUEL FOR THE FIRE. and tender confidence. But Rhoda had no real liking for his love-making, and was careful to abridge these brief conferences, not, however, before she had schooled her docile pupil into proper behaviour. She contrived to impress him with the necessity of paying more attention to Mrs. Raeburn, not only as his hostess and a newly-made wife, but the more effectually to conceal their own attachment, displeasing to the family on many accounts. \"You see, Cuthbert, dear,\" said she, in confiding tones, looking up eloquently into his eyes, \" though Mr. Marsh is so thoroughly bent on my marrying that Edwin Grove, so long as he does not suspect me of a penchant for anyone else, or observe a trespasser on what he considers his friend's manor, he will remain pretty passive in the belief all is \" \"But Mr. Marsh is not here now, Rhoda,\" interrupted Cuthbert; \" and if he were I don't see why we should sail under false colours.\" \"Don't you,\" said she, drily; \"then I do. And if Mr. Marsh is not here, Mrs. Raeburn is, and whatever she thinks you may be quite sure she will say, no matter who is present. Besides, I am not disposed for. another lecture on the impropriety of encouraging your advances.\" Something in this speech jarred on Cuthbert's sensitive conscience, but it passed on the instant, and he answered \u2014 \"Well, have your own way; but it's deuced hard I should be driven aback, and not have a chance of a word with you after that letter of yours. I thought you wanted to see me specially.\" \"And so I do, Cuthbert; but what can I do? This is not the time for all I have to say. Only be patient, and I will contrive opportunities to see you alone, never fear. There, Eva's turning round again.\" \"Cuthbert, is not the scent of the fir trees delightful?\" asked Eva, over her shoulder. The individual addressed gave a sniff or two before replying."], [276, "264 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \" So it is; one might shut one's eyes, and almost fancy oneself aboard ship or in the docks.\" \"The docks! Goodness, Cuthbert, what a comparison. Frank would be sorry if the plantation had the odour of the docks, I know.\" \" Indeed I should. I trace very little of the sap of the living tree in the pitch and tar amongst shipping, which ahvays comes mingled with a sensation of junk, sailcloth, sea-weed, and fish, anything but refreshing to delicate olfac tory organs,\" observed Frank. \" That's just a landsman's notion ; your nose requires education. I smell the shipping as if I were amongst it,\" was the sailor's reply. \"Well,\" laughed Eva, \"I shall never pick up a fir cone or walk through the woods again without thinking of ships and sailors.\" \"Or a ship and a sailor,\" suggested Rhoda. \"Just so; the 'Polly' and her master.\" \" Give me a fir cone, Mrs. Raeburn, and then when you remember me in the woods, I may remember you in the ship.\" Eva stooped, and picking a brown cone of the last year's crop from the many strewed on the grass or hid under dock and plantain, flung it at the captain, who caught it dexter ously, and put it in his pocket. \" Fancy that a cocoanut thrown at you by a monkey,\" exclaimed Eva, with a shrug and a grimace, expressive of compassion for human heads in such predicament. \" No stretch of imagination could compass that,\" said he, as Eva resumed her husband's arm and the interrupted stroll. Light and frivolous this bantering interlude ; but ah ! how painfully remembered by one of the group in the after time. They were now walking on the wooded bank above the Tower, and on their way to the rustic bridge beyond the waterfall. The battlements were on a level with their feet, and the bare flagstaff attracted Cuthbert's attention."], [277, "FUEL FOR THE FIRE 265 \" I say, Raeburn, do you ever hoist the union-jack on that pole ? \" cried he. \"We never have done yet, but we might on festive occa sions. What say you, wifie ? \" \"I did think of it once,\" whispered the young wife to her husband; \"but on second thoughts abandoned the idea.\" \" For what reason?\" and Frank bent his head for her low reply. \" Lest it should give Rhoda pain. \" What painful association has she with the union-jack ? \" \" Oh, none ; but you know, Frank, if we put out a flag at Christmas, or on our birthdays, it would not be a pleasant reminder to her.\" \" Well, perhaps not; so you laudably decided against a display of 'vanity' likely to cause her 'vexation of spirit?'\" \"Yes.\" \" Very commendable of you, my wee wifie ; but I question if Miss Rhoda would be equally scrupulous of wounding you.\" \" What is the reason, Frank, you have such an indifferent opinion of my cousin? I am sure she would lay down her life to serve you.\" \" I doubt it much, whether literally or figuratively. Not that I doubt her courage or inflexibility, her energy of pur pose or strength of will ; but I have no faith in her abnega tion of self, and neither true martyr nor true heroine can be made of other material.\" The grey, stony look which Martin dreaded came over Rhoda's face when Eva whispered to her husband, and Cuthbert, shocked at its strange expression, forgot all about the union-jack in concern for her, she having answered his eager question, \" What is the matter ? \" with \u2014 \"Oh, nothing, nothing; I struck my foot against the root of that tree, and kid slippers are not much protection. It will be better directly. It was only the sudden shock.\" Her face resumed its natural hue, but she affected to limp"], [278, "266 STUNG TO THE QUICK. for a moment or so, and Cuthbert, full of compassion, thought only how intense must have been the pain which brought that rigidity of feature, and how brave must be the girl to make so light of it. \"There is the dinner-bell,\" cried Eva, as they crossed the plank bridge; \"make haste.\" In the afternoon, Mr. Hesketh, Mr. Marsh, and Mr. Thwaites, the viewer, came to hold a conference with Mr. Raeburn on something in connection with the proposed up cast shaft of the pit, and Frank, bidding Eva and Rhoda enter tain Captain Hesketh in his absence, apologised and left them. Rhoda seated herself at the piano, and Cuthbert bent over her very much entranced, until Eva, disgusted with what she thought her cousin's coquetry and Cuthbert's inconstancy to Mary, fairly insisted that he should have a ramble with her. Rhoda had monopolised him quite long enough. She wanted to show him a white rose tree, which had grown amongst the ivy almost to the battlement, yet was quite a niggard of roses, and an arbour she had herself planned to front the waterfall. Obedient to a look from Rhoda he went, although reluc tantly, since she declined to be of the party, and the two, passing round the building, came to the garden plot between the Tower and stream. Eva, in the singleness of her heart and purpose, thought only of removing Cuthbert from a dangerous neighbourhood \u2014 nothing of any false construction to be put on their tcte-a-tcle ramble ; and so they strolled through the woodland together, as old friends might, she making use of the occasion to question Cuthbert respecting Mary, and his evident neglect of her valued companion, and to remonstrate with him on his growing attachment to Rhoda, a girl in no way suited to him. Eva was very much in earnest, and her whole manner betrayed the interest their conversation had for her. \" Captain Hesketh's arrival seems to have put Mrs. Raeburn into extremely good spirits. How very animated she is,\""], [279, "267 FUEL FOR THE FIRE. remarked Rhoda to Frank after the departure of the viewer, with apparent inadvertence, as she watched them from the drawing-room window pass along a winding path, which followed the stream to the cascade, then turned away into the plantation beyond. \"Oh! ah! yes; they are very old friends, and Eva gener ally has a good flow of spirits,\" replied he, with apparent unconcern, yet sufficiently interested. He joined Rhoda at the window with perhaps the very faintest intimation of a disagreeable sensation in his breast \u2014 not removed when they came in, Eva flushed with excite ment and Cuthbert evidently ill at ease. The captain was obliged to return to his vessel that night, and somehow Frank did not press him to remain as ear nestly as he might have done. Several days after, as Eva was about to step into the carriage to accompany Frank to Durham, where he had business with Mr. Hesketh, Rhoda called her back into the dining-room to say a few words privately. \" Eva, dear, will you execute a commission for me while you are in town ? \" \"Of course I will, with pleasure; you know that.\" \" You will promise not to tell your father or Mr. Raeburn ? \" \"Not tell Frank! What can be the wonderful secret I am not to betray? Do you want another green dress, or an interdicted book ? \" \" Neither ; but you must give me your word before I tell you,\" urged Rhoda, knowing well that Eva's word was her bond. \"I have half a mind to refuse, but I don't suppose your secret commission concerns either Frank or my father, and so I venture to promise,\" assented Eva, smilingly. \"Thank you, Eva; then I will trouble you to call at the post-office for me, and ask if there is a letter waiting for 'E. M.' If there is, will you bring it?\" \"A letter for 'E. M.' Why, Rhoda, with whom are you"], [280, "268 STUNG TO THE QUICK. carrying on a clandestine correspondence? I am sure that cannot be right. There is no reason your letters should not come here as openly as our own. Miss Talbot's letters have always reached you safely, have they not ? \" \" Oh, certainly, but this is not from her. You must know some noodle or other advertised for a wife a week or two since. I answered the advertisement, hoping to have some fun out of the fellow, and I expect a reply, that's all \u2014 no great matter, now you know it.\" \"No great matter, perhaps, Rhoda; but you know it is possible the man may be in earnest, and what may be fun to you may be no fun to him.\" \" Now, Eva, don't sermonise, but be a good girl, and ask for my letter \u2014 and mind\u2014 not one word about it.\" \" Well, Rhoda, I will oblige you this once, but never again. I do not think it proper.\" \" Eva, my dear, I thought you were ready ; do not keep the horses standing so long,\" came in the voice of Mr. Raeburn from the hall door. \"Oh, quite ready, Frank; I only stopped to speak with Rhoda a moment.\" Eva had several errands in the city, so Mr. Raeburn was set down at Mr. Hesketh's office, to be taken up again at her father's two hours later. Meanwhile Eva was driven about on her own business, and as the post-office lay in her route to Miss Jackson's shop, she ordered the coachman to set her down at the door. She herself obtained the letter, the clerk eyeing her curiously the while \u2014 the more curiously for the deep flush which overspread her face as the letter was placed in her hand. It was not the first letter to \" E. M.\" which had passed through their hands, but a lady closely veiled had hitherto called for them in an evening. Eva's face had flushed as Cuthbert's well-known writing met her eye. In the seclusion of the carriage a closer"], [281, "269 FUEL FOR THE FIRE. inspection of post-mark and seal confirmed the impression, and disturbed her greatly. She gave her instructions to Miss Jackson very incoherently and indefinitely \u2014 forgot to call for Miss Adamson, who had been waiting full forty minutes with her bonnet on, when, on Frank's reminder, they drove into the Bailey for the patient spinster \u2014 and, in short, was so thoroughly confused and abstracted the whole afternoon that both her husband and father asked repeatedly if she were not well. She was not ill \u2014 but ill at ease \u2014 Rhoda had deceived her, and was not acting fairly towards Mary ; and as for Cuthbert, his conduct was most unprincipled. She lost no time in seeking Rhoda and expressing her strong disapprobation of the means adopted to obtain her connivance in a secret correspondence, protesting it would be the first and last time she would lend herself to that which must be wrong, since it involved secresy and deception. Rhoda appeared much struck with this view of the case; but Cuthbert, she said, had been so very assiduous \u2014 so very pertinacious \u2014 she had found it impossible to shake him off, and had only consented to a clandestine correspondence lest he should openly break with Mary and increase his persecution of herself. Odd motives, certainly; but Eva was no sophist \u2014 she had a clear perception of right and wrong, but no skill to analyse a specious argument. The billet-doux, amongst a profusion of affectionate pro testations, contained this paragraph : \" I shall hail the Grey Tower in three or four days, and shall bring with me the rigging to convert you into as tight a little cabin-boy as ever trod a deck.\" And so he came. Remained a day or two, and as his chamber was up the staircase, midway between the drawing room and Rhoda's retreat, there was no difficulty, save"], [282, "270 STUNG TO THE QUICK. delicacy, in passing the said \" rigging \" from one to the other unnoticed, or maturing any plans they thought fit. Eva, very much annoyed at what she deemed Cuthbert's faithlessness to Mary, and his duplicity in seeking Rhoda's affections in an underhand manner, lectured him continually whenever she had an opportunity ; and besought him earnestly not to resign his first faith for one who, she was convinced, had no permanent regard for him. Placed in a dilemma, he promised to see Mary on his return and make all right, firstly to smooth Eva's irritation, and secondly to rid himself of an unpleasant mentor. On the last of these occasions, immediately before Cuth bert took leave, Frank, who had been watching the two somewhat uneasily, asked, as lightly as he could, \"What are you and Captain Hesketh discussing so warmly? May not I be admitted to your council ? \" \" No, Mr. Curious, you may not. It is a secret, on no account to be divulged until the ' Polly ' has sailed. You shall know then, and not one minute before,\" answered Eva, playfully, patting her dear husband's clustering curls as she spoke. And with this answer he was fain to appear contented, although something of the old uncomfortable feeling was gathering round his heart against his will. Was Rhoda's breath fanning the spark to a flame ? CHAPTER XXXIII. CUTHBERT'S SHEET ANCHOR. Cuthbert went home to sleep that night in anything but a good humour either with himself or others ; and had either Lucy or Mrs. Hesketh been as insolent or wayward as here-"], [283, "CUTHBERT'S SHEET ANCHOR. 271 tofore, there would have been an open rupture, for he was, as he afterwards owned, inclined to quarrel with his fingers' ends. Eva had rated him so soundly, and so justly, that he felt more than a little ashamed of himself, and not quite sure he was not a most heartless villain. Lucy was practising the Signor's latest lesson (in singing, that is) in the cool drawing-room. She called Cuthbert to hear her, and say if she had not improved. But with an impatient \" Don't bother me ! what do I know of music or singing either ? \" he passed to the back parlour, where Aunt Dorothy was knitting one of the countless triangles for her counterpane, and his mother lolled on the chintz-covered sofa, doing nothing and feeling very weary in consequence. \"Knit, knit, knit, always knitting, Aunt Dorothy; what's the good of it?\" \" The good of work, or of my knitting ? \" \"Oh, either; I'm sick of seeing you always at it. And Lucy there, always singing at the pitch of her voice, too.\" \" Well, Cuthbert, lad, the good of work is to keep one out of mischief, and the good of the knitting you will discover when somebody in Sunderland changes her name. But, bless the bairn ! what's the matter with him ? \" (Cuthbert had changed colour.) \"Are you ill, dear?\" \" No, no, only tired. If you'll let me have a candle, I'll go to bed. I must be off early in the morning. Ask father to be up to breakfast with me, will you, aunt? Good-night, Mrs. Hesketh; good-night, Aunt Dolly.\" So he went to bed, leaving Aunt Dolly to knit and ruminate on what had put the bairn about; and when there, as on a former occasion, he tossed about restlessly. Had he lain in Jamaica on a curtainless couch, the mos quitoes could not have stung him worse than did his conscience under Eva's lash ; and when at last he fell asleep he was haunted by uncomfortable dreams, Mary and Rhoda between them tearing him limb from limb; the latter with the cold,"], [284, "272 STUNG TO THE QUICK. grey look he had noticed three weeks ago in the planting; and he woke in a terrible fright. Nor did his torments pass away with his nightmare. At one of the roadside stations a gentleman got into the train, who was immediately recognised by another already in the carriage. After a somewhat desultory conversation on the weather, the harvest, the state of politics, and a threatened strike amongst the colliers, the elder, a man about thirty, said to the other, \u2014 \"So, Dixon, we're to lose our good old curate; he preached his farewell sermon last Sunday. You should have been there; pocket-handkerchiefs were at a premium.\" \" I wish I had been. Mr. Reed is one of the right sort, a Christian and no mistake.

Whereabouts he did not tell me.\" \"How came Fred to know?\" \" Well, if you must know, Fred has been awfully sweet upon that eldest girl of his \u2014 half crazy about her, in fact. He says she is an angel on earth. I cannot answer for that; but I think she is likely to be an angel in heaven before long, for if ever any woman was in a decline, I should say she is.\" \" You don't say so ! Perhaps she's only love-sick. Fred should propose; he would be a good catch for the curate's daughter, and he is not a fellow to be sneezed at by any girl.\" \"Propose!

The clergyman bowed coldly, and would have passed on ; T"], [286, "274 STUNG TO THE QUICK. but Cuthbert, moved by remorse and a troop of feelings he could not analyse, caught him by the arm, and stopped his progress. \"Mr. Reed,\" said he, in a tone of abject humiliation, very far removed from his ordinary voice, \" Mr. Reed, I fear you must look upon me as a despicable scoundrel.\" Mr. Reed bowed. \"Do not receive me in this manner. Say what you will; I feel I have deserved it all, but for Heaven's sake do not treat me with this cutting contempt !

I would ask how \u2014 how is Mary? \" And his voice was husky with emotion. \" Not so well as her friends could wish \u2014 you really must not detain me, sir. My business does not admit of delay.\" So saying, the clergyman coldly shook him off and went his way into the station, leaving Cuthbert standing in a stupor. Recovering, he moved slowly away, as if undeter mined which way to turn. Having made up his mind, he increased his speed until he came in sight of the curate's house, before which stood a carrier's cart, sundry large packing-cases, and heavy articles of furniture wrapped in matting or old carpets. Again his speed slackened ; he knew not how to advance nor yet how to retreat. Maggy, at the door, handing a glass of ale to one of the men, observed his approach. Her hasty exclamation of surprise brought Mary forward too see what was wrong. On beholding Cuthbert, then within a few paces, a flush overspread her pale face, then died away, leaving her more pallid than before, and but for Maggy's arm and a huge chest in the passage, she would have fallen.

Seeing that she avoided him, Cuthbert stopped short on the threshold; but something urged him on, and in spite of Maggy's frown he crushed past her, and followed the girl he had deserted so shamefully into the room, once so snug, but now as confused and disordered as his own feelings. He closed the door behind him and put his back against it, for Mary's seat was close beside. \"Mary,\" faltered he, \"I come to acknowledge \u2014 to tell you \u2014 to confess how base a wretch I have been, how utterly unworthy your \u2014 your affection \u2014 your remembrance \u2014 your tears \" (she was sobbing). \" I heard in the train that you were going away, and Mary, bad as you may think me, I could not let you go without a word of farewell \u2014 of for giveness; of forgiveness, Mary, although I feel I have used you cruelly \u2014 too cruelly to deserve forgiveness. Mary, do you know where I have been and what I had almost done ? \" A faint \" No \" was the only answer. \" I have been to Durham \u2014 to Mr. Raeburn's, and Mary \u2014 may* God forgive me! \u2014 I have promised to make Rhoda Wearbank \u2014 my wife.\" A shudder and a suppressed shriek from Mary alone told that she heard him. \"I must have been mad, Mary, I must; for before Heaven, I do not love her \u2014 I do not. How I first became entangled with her you must know, but you cannot know how I strug gled against the allurements that drew me from you, the dear love of my boyhood. Mary, I have been to blame, greatly to blame, but I did strive against the temptation \u2014 I did. I have been intoxicated by her beauty and accom plishments, but I have never wholly forgotten you in the midst of her sweetest flatteries. Mary, will you forgive me? Only you can save my life from shipwreck; \u2014 do not cast me adrift.\" Mary's head, her face covered by her hands, was bowed"], [288, "276 STUNG TO THE QUICK. almost to her knees, whilst heavy sobs shook her whole frame; but she seemed incapable of utterance. In his anguish he had drawn closer to her, bent lower and lower, longing, but not daring, to take her hand; until at last he flung himself desperately at her feet, and dragged her hands from her face, crying out passionately, \u2014 \"Mary, Mary, will you not believe me \u2014 will you not pardon me ? Do not drive me back to destruction. I have never been false to you \u2014 in my secret heart I never have. Mary, I do love you better than anyone in the whole wide world ! \" The hands he held had struggled for release, and again they hid her face as she said, as if the words were wrung from her, \u2014 \" Oh, Cuthbert, Cuthbert, what misery you have caused me ! \" \" I know it, Mary, and hate myself for it. But oh ! if you will only be generous once more, and trust me once more, nothing \u2014 no one \u2014 shall seduce me from you again.\" \"I do forgive you, Cuthbert; but I have lost all confidence in you,\" said she, quietly, with a deep sigh, shaking her meek head. \" Dear Mary, not all confidence; do not say that. But tell me, what does this removal mean ? When are you going away ? \" \"On Thursday,\" answered she, faintly; \"we go to Pately Bridge \u2014 my father has been offered a living there.\" \" Go with me instead. Be my wife, Mary. I feel how utterly unworthy of you I am, but I cling to you as to my guardian angel to save me even from myself \u2014 to save me from the snares of the temptress who first lured me from you.\" \"Cuthbert, I fear you are deceiving me and deceiving yourself once more, and that, were I weak enough to yield, the result would be another disappointment; as when, on like importunity, I promised to marry you last Christmas, and you went to Durham as you said (and I am willing to"], [289, "CUTHBERT'S SHEET ANCHOR. 277 believe) for a licence. This is our first meeting since, and it is now October. What trust could I have in a man so unstable, even were I your wife ? \" His quivering fingers had been playing nervously with his patchy whiskers as she spoke, but now he thrust them through his hair and rose hastily as if to pace the room in his agitation, but was checked by hampers and packages lying around. All his jauntiness was gone ; he was no longer at ease with himself; the folly, the guilt of his conduct was so palpable, he was fairly cowed. Everything his mother, or Martin, or Eva had said of Rhoda, however trivial, rose before him, together with that fierce, stony gaze he had seen three weeks before ; only to contrast the more painfully with the gentle girl by his side, whose form and face betrayed months of suffering, yet who had no upbraidings for him. Again he sat down by her side, and buried his shame stricken quivering face in his hands without a word. Big tears trickled between his fingers, but Mary, who had never raised her head, saw them not; and the dead silence in the room contrasted with the voices of carters and women, the shuffling and trampling of feet outside and in the passage. Time was hurrying on; he was overdue at the docks; yet there he sat, utterly overpowered, unable to raise his voice in exculpation of his guilt. Thanks to Maggy their privacy had not been intruded upon, though some goods in the room were in demand. At length, summoning all his resolution, he rose, took her nerveless hand in his, and looking down upon her sadly, said in a broken, almost inaudible voice, \" I cannot blame you, Mary, for your decision, though it is breaking my heart. You have every reason to call me unstable, and refuse to trust me with your future happiness; but, indeed, I did obtain the licence, and have it still. I kept aloof from South Street, until in an evil hour I met Mr. Raeburn, and"], [290, "278 STUNG TO THE QUICK. he would not take a denial. I had better have blown my brains out than have gone ! \" \"Hush, Cuthbert! \" expostulated she, alarmed at his sudden outburst. \" I had, indeed \u2014 but it is over now. God bless you, Mary ! may you live to forget me, and the sorrow I have caused you. I feel now like a castaway on the ocean, without rudder, or chart, or compass. God bless you; good-bye.\" He wrung her hand with the grip of a drowning man, and turned to the door. His hand was on the latch \u2014 another instant and he would have been gone; but Mary, touched by his despairing resignation as she had not been moved by his entreaties, sprang from her seat, and clinging to his breast, cried, \" Oh, Cuthbert ! I cannot let you go thus ; and I will trust you once more, whatever be the conse quence.\" \" My own good, true Mary ! \" Cuthbert was late at the docks, and it is to be feared made a somewhat untruthful apology for his delay, an excuse anything but satisfactory to the posse of agents, underwriters, clerks, seamen, and others whose movements had been retarded by his absence; but once there, he moved about with a vigour and elasticity more like his own self than he had shown for very many months. CHAPTER XXXIV. MISSING. Two days before the \" Polly \" sailed, Mr. Raeburn was summoned to London on urgent business, the nature of which he would not disclose even to Eva. \" So you see, darling, I have my secrets as well as you,\""], [291, "MISSING. 279 were his words, as he extricated himself from her clinging arms, stepped into the carriage, and drove off, after declin ing her offer to accompany him to the station. However reluctant to deny her request, seeing her tearful eye and trembling lip, he judged it better to allow her ex citement scope to expend itself at home, than by gathering strength during the drive, cause an unpleasant scene on the platform. Until he was gone she bore up well enough, but then this timid, loving little creature broke down utterly. It was the first time they had been separated since their union, and she felt a sort of presentiment of evil threatening him on the journey. All the accidents of which she had ever heard or read crowded into her mind at once. She sat down in a fit of abject despondency, not dissipated by the raillery of Rhoda; and as some picture more frightful than another rose before her distempered fancy, she burst into tears, and sobbed with excessive vehemence. Rhoda's plans were now ripe. As if Eva's tears had changed her banter into sympathy, she strove to calm and soothe her with kindly words and seeming interest. After a time she induced the agitated wife to retire to rest, and have a cup of strong tea to allay the headache caused by weeping. Eva, owning she was silly and nervous, assented with thanks, and went to her room. The tea was prepared. Rhoda prepared it. Was there no good genius nigh to break the cup, or spill the infusion? Was there no kindly mirror to reveal the treacherous hand which dropped oblivion into the cup ? Where had Rhoda obtained a knowledge of narcotics ? Where had she obtained the narcotic itself? Had she sifted her admiring swain for the information, using him as she had used Cuthbert ? As for the drug, no chemist in Durham had supplied it,"], [292, "280 STUNG TO THE QUICK. nor could the Newcastle apothecary have traced it to Rhoda, though she bought and paid for it. The shed in the dingle held the clue, no human being. Newcastle was sixteen miles away, yet she contrived to come and go, unseen and unsuspected. Who knew her door was locked on an empty room when she professed to play the recluse for hours ? Eva slept \u2014 slept heavily. Supper time came. A domestic was sent to inform her mistress the meal was ready. The maid came back to report that Mrs. Raeburn was fast asleep on the bed, dressed, and did not waken when called. \"Ah, well! she had better remain undisturbed. Sleep will do Mrs. Raeburn more good than supper. Let a light be placed in her chamber, so that when she wakes she can undress,\" was the order of the careful cousin, who dismissed the servants to bed at an early hour as an act of special kindness. Next morning Mrs. Raeburn did not come downstairs at her usual hour. Breakfast waited. Looking at a timepiece on the mantelshelf, \"Martha,\" said Rhoda, \"go and ascertain if Mrs. Raeburn is dressing; say I have been waiting half an hour. Or stay, perhaps if she is not well, she might prefer breakfast in bed. Ask the question.\" Martha tripped lightly up the broad staircase, and tapped as lightly at the chamber door. There was no reply. The knuckles made a louder appeal ; then Martha's voice ; and then a louder knock, but with the same result. Alarmed, she knew not why, the girl opened the door. The bed was empty. She rushed down to Miss Wearbank with consternation in her face and tone. \" Oh, please 'm, missus isn't there ! \" \" Nonsense, Martha ; she must be there, or in her dressing room. \""], [293, "MISSING. 281 \" No, ma'am, she isn't.\" \" She must be. You did not look properly, giving me the trouble of going upstairs for nothing ! \" Rhoda spoke with some asperity as she ran upstairs im patiently, followed by the girl, muttering to herself, .\"Surely one can believe one's own eyes ! \" After a glance at the empty bed, Rhoda passed into the dressing-room, with Martha at her heels, calling \"Eva, where are you? I am famishing for my breakfast.\" There was no Eva. The intervening door of an open wardrobe was moved aside, but the room was empty. Not in the drawing-room \u2014 nowhere on that floor; up-stairs to the guest chambers \u2014 to the servants' rooms \u2014 higher still to Miss Wearbank's \u2014 no sign of the missing lady! No one thought to mount the turret-stairs; the door had never been seen open, nor a key in the lock. The turret was out of the question. She was gone \u2014 but whither? The centre of a group of wondering servants, who, hearing the anxious voices and hurrying feet on the staircase, followed or met the first searchers. Rhoda reached the hall, clasping her hands, and pacing about as if wild with agony, talking strangely to herself the while, apparently too absorbed to note the presence of others (of course she could not observe them listening with eager ears). \" I thought it would come to this. Oh, if I had but warned him! How shall I break it to her father? to Mr. Raeburn? What shall I do?\" \" If you please, miss, Jane sand the front door open this mornin'; it wur nut even snecked,\" volunteered Martha. \" Why did not some one say that before ? It might have saved all this absurd commotion,\" said Rhoda, haughtily. \" Mrs. Raeburn, no doubt, wakened early, having gone to rest many hours before others, and I dare say has gone for a morning stroll. Make some fresh coffee, Jane. I shall not wait any longer.\""], [294, "282 STUNG TO THE QUICK. As if this were a decisive opinion the lady swept into the breakfast-room to sip her coffee, and trifle with marmalade and short-cake as composedly (to all outer seeming) as though she was truly dawdling through the meal in anticipation of her cousin's immediate advent. Yet there was a triumphant light in her eyes, a strange smile on her full lips, which told of consciousness that in the kitchen, close at hand, servants were huddled together, whis pering and surmising treason against their fair young mistress, on the hints she had thrown out so very unconsciously. Presently she rang the bell. \" Martha, tell Beck (the groom) to look round the garden for his mistress, and acquaint her the breakfast is spoiling.\" With a dip that was meant for a curtsey, the girl with drew on her errand, and twenty minutes later returned blank and breathless. \" Please, 'm, Beck says as he can't sand missus nowhere.\" \"Not find her! You cannot mean that!\" exclaimed Rhoda, starting to her feet, apparently aghast and hurrying from the room. \" Beck says as he's looked everywhere, m'm,\" explained Martha, as Miss Wearbank brushed past her with the air of one aroused to a sudden sense of responsibility, and a rekindled fear that there was more in this prolonged absence than a morning walk. In answer to a rapid question, Beck said, \" Aw've bin roun' baith gairdens, miss, an te the arbor facin' th' waiters a', an o'er t'e lawn te th' big yett, but aw divnt see a sign on misses nowheer.\" \" Dear me ! this becomes very alarming ! \" exclaimed Rhoda. \" She must be within the grounds. The woods must be searched instantly. Beck, do you cross the bridge, and ex amine the bankside planting. Monkhouse, you take the planting by the roadside. Send one of the gardeners round by the pond to the ravine. Jane, you had better remain in charge of the house. I will cross the grass to the south"], [295, "283 MISSING. gate, and enter the wood there, whilst you, Martha, can explore the shrubbery and the old hut.\" \"Crazy Jim's hut! I'd be heightened te gan theer, miss, blundered forth the young woman, sheepishly. \" Frightened ! \" echoed Rhoda with most supreme contempt, \" then perhaps you may have courage to go across the lawn and meet me there if I go through the shrubbery.\" It is needless to follow the search through the various winding wood-paths, by pond or ravine; we need only remark how leisurely Rhoda entered the shrubbery, not far from the cascade, and sauntered along, hidden from view, with the composure of one who was killing time. Yet she contrived to reach the hut in agitated haste just as Beck with real distress and disappointment in his face leapt across the burn, and said, \"Aw cannut fin' her, miss.\" Just then the maid, out of breath with running, came up, and Miss Wearbank remarked, \" Your mistress was partial to this spot, but she cannot have been in the shed or that cobweb would have broken down; however, I will look in.\" Snap went the dirty web as she pushed open the door, revealing only a broken tool-box and a patch of yellow fungus close beside. There were no traces of the missing lady. Beck was despatched on horseback for Dr. Grove, and pending his arrival, Miss Wearbank paced the hall, wringing her hands and lamenting audibly. Then she traversed the drive as one too impatient to wait the return of her mes senger indoors. She was very white when she met the doctor halfway down the drive \u2014 white with a genuine fear \u2014 for his was the only scrutiny she dreaded. \" Oh, doctor, I am thankful you have come. You will be able to advise. Is not this appalling? Mr. Raeburn will be distracted.\" \"Beck tells me Mrs. Raeburn is missing,\" said the doctor/ taking no notice of her remarks, but looking at her askance,"], [296, "284 STUNG TO THE QUICK. as if he would read her through. She had prepared her book for his inspection, however, and the page revealed nothing. \"Missing \u2014 since when?\" interrogated he. \" Since breakfast-time \u2014 all morning. I thought at first she had gone for a stroll in the gardens, and, oh, dear! dear! sat down to my coffee, annoyed at having to wait instead of searching the grounds at once.\" \" This is very singular, very. I cannot account for the young wife's disappearance. Can you, Miss Wearbank ? \" Did the doctor detect the faint indication of hesitation which was visible in the \"Indeed I cannot; I wish I could,\" which answered him, that he followed up the one question by another? \" Can you offer no solution of the mystery ? \" \"Really, doctor, I \u2014 I have been so taken by surprise, I have had no time to think.\" \"Humph! You don't know of any enemy the little lady had, I suppose? \" \" Certainly not \u2014 Eva was loved universally. \" Ah ! so / always understood ! You are convinced she is not in the neighbourhood ? \" \"Well, I have not sent to South Street.\" \"I looked in as I came up; she has not been there,\" interrupted he. \" I soon found that out, without a question. And you have no suspicions \u2014 no clue, Miss Wearbank ? \" \" What should I suspect, doctor ? But here are the servants, you had better question them,\" said she, as if to avoid answering. And he did question them closely; instituted a second search, and on the discovery that no bonnet was missing, and no garments, so far as could be ascertained without breaking locks, he had the pond dragged, and the deep water at the foot of the fall. Still no Eva \u2014 dead or alive. The doctor's patients had to wait for him that day while busied in his fruitless investigation. Odd words dropped by the man, having their origin in"], [297, "285 MISSING. Rhoda's first hasty ejaculations, confirmed the doctor in an impression that she could throw a light on the mystery if she chose. She appeared like one who kept something back, who had a suspicion or a reservation; yet, although she allowed this suspicion to be seen, though she admitted she had had fears and doubts, no positive declaration could he obtain as to the nature of these doubts. His own suspicions were, however, of a graver nature than Miss Wearbank dreamed, and had she seen his scrutiny in ravine and woodland, the careful peering under bushes, the turning over of dead leaves or mould wherever the earth looked fresh or disturbed, had she heard the minute inquiries how and where she had spent the evening, she would have trembled rather than have sat silent and scornful alone in the drawing-room, to which she had been quietly dismissed as useless. The doctor would fain have consulted with Mr. Hesketh, but he was away with Mr. Raeburn in Town. Mr. Marsh was but in a poor state of health, and he took every precaution to keep the dreadful news from him, especially as the whole affair was enveloped in so much mystery. There was then no telegraphic communication with London, even if Miss Wearbank had been entrusted with Mr. Raeburn's address. Mr. Hesketh's office was closed before the over worked doctor could spare time from his protracted search and most urgent professional cases; but in the morning the clerk named an hotel in Westminster, where his master ordinarily stopped, at the same time appending the informa tion that he would have left London before a letter could reach him; Mr. Raeburn and he were going into the Black Country before they returned, and a letter would be more likely to meet them at the Hen and Chickens, Birmingham, or the Talbot, Wolverhampton. \" Now, what does that deep old doctor want master's address for? He never wanted it before. Something's up somewhere! I should like to know what it is. Has Mrs."], [298, "286 STUNG TO THE QUICK. Hesketh been in her tantrums again and broken some one's head, I wonder ? There's something up, certain ! \" cogitated the clerk, when Dr. Grove was gone. Much he marvelled and much he puzzled, and not finding business too exhilarating, he assumed his dinner-time to be at least an hour in advance of the clock, and lifting down his old well-thumbed, well-brushed hat, left the office to take care of itself, whilst he indulged his liking for liberty and the attainment of knowledge. He first found it desirable to step round and see if Mrs. Hesketh or Miss Dorothea had any message for master, as he was about to write and could add a postcript or enclose a few lines; it would save postage if they did not make it over weight. There was no message, all were well. The doctor could have nothing to say about their concerns, that was clear. Presently he met Martin, who replied to his question, \"Maister's nut es weel es might be; he's raither complainin', but nowt te talk ov; he'd happen o'erdyen himsel i' this newfangled wark o' th' pit.\" Martin had evidently nothing to tell, but the wings of rumour flapped the clerk's lips long before he reached his own threshold, and his breath wafted it onward the way it should not have gone. Before Martin 's return home, a butcher's boy had carried the news in with his basket, and Bella, leaving the boy at the door, rushed, without ceremony or consideration, into the parlour. \"Oh! maister, maister; Joe Sykes saays es Mrs. Raeburn's owther gaed away or bin murdered; she cannut be sand heigh nor low.\" Dr. Grove's extreme caution or reluctance to be the bearer of ill news, until confirmed, had been a serious mistake. Far better had it been that he, a discreet man, should have taken the initiative, and broken to the bereaved parent the story of his daughter's unaccountable disappearance,"], [299, "287 THE MAPLE DESK. than leave a possibility for the winds of gossip to blow it to his unprepared ears. Startled by Bella's entrance, he turned his head; but as her heedless words, huddled one on another, reached his brain, he jumped to his feet, dropping his pipe, which shivered in fragments on his shoe, grasped both arms of his chair, and fell back\u2014 paralyzed. CHAPTER XXXV. THE MAPLE DESK. Days went by, bringing neither tidings of Eva nor replies to Dr. Grove's premonitory letters, nor the travellers themselves. Letters there were from the thoughtful husband to his cherished wife by every post (that does not mean twice or thrice a day, good reader), but those the doctor did not presume to open. After the lapse of a week Mr. Hesketh's clerk trotted up Framwellgate with the welcome intelligence that his master and Mr. Raeburn would arrive by the last train that evening. Punctually to the time, with brows as tightly set as his trousers straps, with one thumb nail between his teeth while the closed hand covered mouth and chin, and his other hand rested on his straight back, the doctor paced the platform awaiting the dila tory train, pondering the mystery he could not fathom, and nerving himself to the task before him. Physicians find it no pleasant duty to pronounce a fiat of doom to the anxious relatives of a long-suffering patient ; how, then, was he to crush the blithe hopes of a trusting husband, and tell him that his wife was false \u2014 or slain ? For his own part he believed the latter; the former was too absurd for belief. But how should he soften the intelligence if Mr. Raeburn came unprepared ? It was, indeed, a terrible blow for the young husband, elated with the success of his enterprise, and longing to gladden an"], [300, "288 STUNG TO THE QUICK. expectant wife with his news \u2014 a terrible blow. The strong man was struck down as by a musket shot, and bled internally. No art of the doctor's had sufficed to smooth the track of the story. At the first signal his awakened fear flew to his idolized Eva, and with strange impetuosity he demanded \"the worst.\" Mr. Hesketh was stunned by the story, but on Mr. Reaburn the effect was appalling. He sat forward on his seat opposite to the doctor, the light of the carriage-lamp full on his face \u2014 sat rigid, with a blank, incredulous stare, until the alarmed physician's fingers on his pulse, and a pungent essence at his nostrils, awakened the sense that was asleep and nigh oblivion, but not wandering. Roused, he fell back; his breath came and went in long gasps in a silence else unbroken save by the carriage wheels, a silence he was the first to break. \" I cannot believe this, doctor; I dare not. My wife is pure as an angel \u2014 has not an enemy in the world.\" \" Mr. Raeburn, she is not to be found,\" was the grave, deliber ate, yet compassionate reply. \"When was she first mi \" The choking voice could get no farther. \"On Tuesday morning,\" answered Dr. Grove; and, to spare the stricken man the agony of inquiry, continued slowly : \" Mrs. Raeburn, having a severe headache (the result, I believe, of weep ing), had a cup of strong tea, and went to bed within two hours of your departure. \" As she slept composedly, Miss Wearbank would not suffer her to be awaked. She was not missed until breakfast time next morning, when, finding her cousin did not come down as usual, Martha was despatched by Miss Wearbank to call her. The room was empty; \u2014 the hall-door had been found ajar in the morning, though fastened overnight.\" \" The door open ! \" \" Yes. Under the impression that Mrs. Raeburn had gone simply for an early stroll and overlooked the time, the first hasty search was made ; then a second more rigid ; then I"], [301, "THE MAPLE DESK. 289 was summoned. I scrutinized, cross-questioned, and searched again, to no better purpose. I even had the pond dragged, and the water below the fall; the result was the same.\" \" Thank you, doctor, thank you ; you have been a true, kind friend.\" \" I loved the little girl. I had been present at her birth, and shall not rest until this mystery is solved. You owe me no thanks,\" said he, abruptly. \" Why on earth didn't you write for us back ? \" blurted out Mr. Hesketh, having found his tongue. \" When I had your address I did, both to the Talbot, Wol verhampton, and to the Hen and Chickens, Birmingham.\" \"Goodness! and we just missed them by hurrying through Birmingham; and putting up at the Swan instead of the Talbot in the other grimy hole. I suppose they'll be follow ing us when of no use,\" muttered the choleric man, venting on the letters the rage he could not expend elsewhere. The wretched husband, who had sat with his hands tightly clasped between his knees, his hat over his brows, and his head bowed down during the doctor's painful recital, now asked, in a constrained voice \u2014 \" Is there no clue ? Are no clothes missing ? \" \"I believe not; we had no authority to break locks. There is no bonnet missing, I know.\" \" No bonnet missing ! My God, my brain is reeling ! \" Rhoda received the three in silence, as if afraid to trust her voice with the subject nearest all their hearts. A gentle pressure of his hand, and a sorrowing glance into his eyes, alone bespoke her sympathetic recognition of Mr. Raeburn's loss. All the pride and reserve of his nature seemed to return, as he entered the Tower and encountered Rhoda only, where Eva had been wont to spring to his embrace. He would not sully his wife's name by questioning domestics. \" Miss Wearbank, have you my wife's keys ? \" were almost his first words. u"], [302, "290 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \"No, Mr. Raeburn; I have not had them for some time.\" He rang the bell. \"A chisel and mallet instantly.\" Little reck was there for costly wood or elaborate carving, as lock after lock yielded under the tools in that determined hand. There was nothing missing, nothing. Yes. Eva's jewels ! Silence like the lull of a storm followed this announcement, while glance met glance as eloquent and intelligent. Mr. Raeburn's features convulsed as with a spasm; then, his lips compressed, a cold grey look settled on his face, as, without a word, he strode into the adjoining drawing-room, gripping the tools in his suppressed agony until the wooden handles were indented by his nails. The lamp had been already lit. Without a pause he lifted from the piano top a small inlaid maple desk, a present from himself to Eva in the sunny days of their smooth court ship, and without more ado wrenched it open. What had Frank Raeburn found that sent the quick blood purpling to lip and forehead, then drove it back and left them white and livid as death or marble? Only letters \u2014 but such letters \u2014 letters to blast the sight of any loving and confiding husband! There were genuine letters bearing the Sunderland post mark, superscribed \"E.M., Post Office, Durham,\" signed \"Cuthbert.\" Then rough drafts {not so genuine, as Rhoda too well knew) of warm replies in Eva's dainty hand, where \"Dearest Cuthbert\" introduced the theme, and \"your loving Eva \" avouched it. In short, all that simple Cuthbert had been entrapped to write lay in that maple desk, with cleverly concocted replies which might in style and calligraphy have been Eva's, could that pure-minded woman have fallen so low. A groan, which told of unutterable pain, called forth the three yet conferring in the chamber on the fact of the missing jewels and its import; but when Rhoda would have"], [303, "THE MAPLE DESK. 291 hurried with the gentlemen into the presence of the tortured man, Dr. Grove held her back. \"Miss Wearbank,\" said he, gravely, \"you had better retire. I feel assured our poor friend has made a second sad discovery. No man cares for a woman to witness his weakness or his agony; you will spare him an accession of pain and yourself much also by awaiting in another room the result.\" \" You must remember, doctor, I have been a whole week a prey to apprehension and anxiety, and if \" \"One hour more will not be a heavy addition to the week. I will grant your anxiety ; but delicacy should supersede curiosity,\" interrupted he, with marked emphasis. Without betraying further unwillingness, she acquiesced in silence, mentally chafing at the exclusion, though not daring to rebel. They found the unhappy man, with his head bowed down upon his hands, among the disordered papers, every muscle of his frame quivering, and his face working to a degree which might have alarmed even Dr. Grove, had not his experience told him it was the effort of a strong-minded reticent man to regain outward composure. A sign from the physician restrained Mr. Hesketh from untimely interference, and the twain seated themselves in the background whilst a deadly strife went on between memory and hope, and memory won. There lay the tokens of unexampled treachery and infidelity. There the shameless testimony of the friend he had trusted and the wife he had adored that there was neither faith in man nor purity in woman. So thought he, as one by one, like spectres summoned to haunt him night and day for evermore, he called back every memory of every incident which had raised a fear or jealous doubt of Eva's love, and kept his proud heart back from the hazard of a repulse ere he felt assured she loved him only. \"Assured,\" thought he; \"better ten thousand times I had"], [304, "292 STUNG TO THE QUICK. held back for ever than have risked my life's hopes on a wanton. God! that that word should name my Eva \u2014 mine? \u2014 not mine. Fool and blind that I was, did she not sing 'The Mariner' the night I spent with them first, praying the waves so earnestly to bring her sailor-lover back? Was not the watch-guard woven for me a mere pretext for the one so assiduously wrought for him? Rhoda was right; the shipping views had a deeper origin than Dr. Grove could see. And oh, the by-play in the wood, when I stood by and watched the fir cone flung as a love token, and heard the open boast that 'the scent of fir trees would ever remind her of the \"Polly\" and her master?' Then, good Heaven! the secret I was not to know until the ' Polly ' sailed ! Oh, mad, uxorious fool, to suffer myself to be so vilely duped ! to be beguiled by seeming artlessness and winning smiles. How madly, in my wisdom, I o'erleapt or overlooked all the kindly warnings Rhoda in her dependence dared not utter openly \u2014 yet ventured to look and to imply. Oh ! Eva, darling Eva! madly* loved, lost as you are, I would hate you if I could, but my heart will not obey my senses.\" Thoughts like these were followed by a tempest of rage against the seducer and destroyer; the live coal kindled in his heart and lit his eyes with a fierce light that boded ill for those who had done him this foul wrong. Thought is swift, and passion sweeps and scathes the soul like a whirlwind. The strength of a tempest is not marked by its duration. Too proud to bare his sufferings to a human being, jealous that any eyes should witness his ineffectual efforts to cast from his heart a worthless woman who had dishonoured him, Frank Raeburn, choking down all other emotions than that of stern resolve, rose suddenly, and confronting Mr. Hesketh, threw a letter down before him. \"Do you know that hand and seal?\" said he, in a voice so forced and cold it revealed to Dr. Grove much that he meant to hide."], [305, "THE MAPLE DESK. 293 \"Know it\u2014 hand, seal,\" stammered Mr. Hesketh, \"My goodness! they are our Cuthbert's. What in the name of all that is terrible is the meaning of this ? \" \"You had better read it, sir, for your better information, and see how proud you had need be ol your son and of my friend. \" If not the writing of a fluent penman, it was clear and legible enough; but Mr. Hesketh's unsteady hands, misty spectacles, and tremulous voice interfered with his task. \" Perhaps Dr. Grove will relieve you,\" suggested Mr. Raebum, in the same dry, cold tone which did not betray his compassion for the old man's evident distress. Dr. Grove read from beginning to end, without an inter ruption, that letter of Cuthbert's which promised the \" rigging for the tight little cabin-boy.\" There was the wanting clue. \"Cabin-boys do not wear ladies' bonnets, gentlemen,\" remarked Mr. Raeburn with bitter emphasis, as he tossed the remaining papers to the doctor, bidding him read them all. Mr. Hesketh, choking with indignation and wounded paternal affection, asserted, \"I'll be d\u2014 d if Cuthbert wrote that villany. It's a gross forgery.\" \"Mr. Raeburn,\" expostulated the bewildered doctor, \"is it necessary these letters should be read aloud? Why expose the raw wound to fresh cautery since you already know the contents ? \" \" It is necessary. I know the contents but in part, and I must learn to bear. Besides, Mr. Hesketh must be assured that the perfidy of his son is completely established, and you, doctor, will require to be fully informed, since I depend on your judgment and friendship to break to Mr. Marsh the news of \u2014 of \u2014 his daughter's dishonour as gently as possible. I would spare him the bitter knowledge if I could.\" And the stern look relaxed for a moment as he contemplated the father sorrowing over the shame of his only child. \"The precaution is useless, I grieve to say,\" was the sad"], [306, "294 STUNG TO THE QUICK. reply. \" Gossip forestalled me, and my oldest friend lies in an all but hopeless state of paralysis.\" \" May God forgive her then! She has broken two hearts instead of one,\" burst from Frank's livid lips. Then after a pause he added quietly, \"Doctor, proceed.\" Mr. Raeburn sat upright in his chair, with his lips com pressed, with rigid brow and folded arms, which hid. the tightly-clenched hands ; while ever and anon there flashed gleams from his eyes which told of a fiery spirit roused, and ready, yet kept in check by fortitude and will as strong. What he bore during the reading of those cruel letters none ever knew, nor how he argued with himself against their evi dence \u2014 evidence which only tended to corroborate and give a clue to the foregone flight. Meanwhile Mr. Hesketh, hot and red, nervous and fidgety, wiped his forehead, sat down, examined one by one the great red seals, the signatures, the post-marks of Cuthbert's unfortunate missives, stood up, wiped his brow again, walked about again, sat down and turned the letters over, muttering all the time a mingled jargon in which love for his only son, faith in that son, a belief in his better nature and that of Eva, the doubts in his constancy Mary herself had sug gested, the bad odour Cuthbert was in at home, and the indu bitable witness of those letters, mingled in pitiable confusion, only to end in an explosive and wrathful renunciation of him as a \"worthless scoundrel.\" What a refutation of all these suspicions lay sealed up in the Sunderland post-office under a blank cover!"], [307, "PROBLEMATIC. 295 CHAPTER XXXVI. PROBLEMATIC. \" What can Doctor Grove think ? Why did he wish to keep me out of the way ? \" were two questions rolling over and over in the surge of Rhoda's brain. \" He cannot surely suspect, cannot doubt her flight. Yet why should I dread him ? Has he the wisdom of all the seven sages that I should be unable to hoodwink him? I was a fool to be sent downstairs like a school-girl by her tutor. Have I not missed my chief revenge ? I could fain have seen for myself how the proud man bore his wounded honour \u2014 how he felt the smirching of his lily. He was stolen from me, and / had to endure ! He must endure now that she is stolen from him. / had to waken from a dream of being loved. Let him awake and think he dreamed. Let him awake to a belief that he passed the true heart and cherished only the semblance of one \u2014 let him waken to that and I am indeed a victor! \u2014 I hear no sound overhead. He bears his torture bravely. Whose step is that \u2014 not his? It will be the perplexed father of my enamoured simpleton. A pleasant fireside you will have soon, Mr. Hesketh; quite as comfortable as the 'workhouse,' I should think. But I have not done with you and yours yet, old man ; as I was stung, so will I sting. There is no Lethe to wash out the memory of your child's bitter taunt; as I remember, so will I repay.\" Mr. Hesketh and Dr. Grove found her in the dining-room looking out into the dismal night from the unsheltered window, whence waterfall and trees, blent in one shadowy mass, loomed darkly, barely outlined against the moonless sky. The soughing of the wind amongst the tossing and writhing trees and the monotonous roar of the fall were in keeping with the dark and restless thoughts of the woman"], [308, "296 STUNG TO THE QUICK. brooding over imaginary wrongs and goading herself to the perpetration of real ones. She rose as they entered, and stood as if waiting their communication. Dr. Grove was spokesman; Mr. Hesketh could not have proclaimed the baseness and duplicity of his own son to that girl for all Durham ; indeed, when he found her there, he turned on his heels with a hasty \u2014 \"Good-night, Miss Wearbank. Doctor, I will walk on.\" \" Miss Wearbank, it is my very unpleasant task to acquaint you that in Mrs. Raeburn's desk were letters confirming what I now believe was your suspicion all along. Mrs. Raeburn, it appears, has eloped with Captain Hesketh.\" \"I was afraid of this,\" said she, with a tone of desponding hopelessness very cleverly assumed. \"How could she do it?\" \" How, or why, passes my intelligence. I could have staked my professional reputation on Mrs. Raeburn's purity. But there is no accounting for the caprice of women \u2014 no diving into their motives. Mrs. Raeburn had no excuse for this act. It stands alone in the rank of infamous abandon ment, and is sufficient to overturn one's faith in human nature.\" \"How does poor Frank bear it?\" was her next question. \" Most heroically ; but, though he has covered the fox, I see it is gnawing his very vitals, and there is no remedy. I am sorry for him, very.\" Dr. Grove spoke with sad gravity, which seemed to touch his hearer, for her handkerchief went to her eyes as if she was deeply affected. \" I have prevailed on Mr. Raeburn to go to bed, though I fear there is little likelihood he will sleep. I would advise you, Miss Rhoda, to dismiss the domestics, and retire your self as soon as possible, that the house may be quiet. It is long past midnight.\" \" Had not yourself and Mr. Hesketh better remain here to-night, since it is late ? \" asked Rhoda, readily, but without any wish for their stay."], [309, "PROBLEMATIC. 297 \" Thank you, no. My patients cannot be neglected because a wilful woman has increased their number with her wicked ness. Good-night.\" The doctor was gone\u2014 gone, as much her dupe as Cuthbert or Mr. Hesketh! Rhoda breathed more freely than she had done since she met him a week before on the carriage-drive, and felt his questions like a probe. He was gone now, however, and with all his shrewdness was satisfied of Eva's guilt. She had nothing more to dread. In the two years Cuthbert, her shallow tool, must be away, what might she not accomplish ? Revenge \u2014 ambition \u2014 all \u2014 all, and she would. Since the doctor had accepted the evidence of his eyes success was certain. Scorn and self-satisfaction curled Rhoda's lip, set with determination, and no fear of miscarriage caused even the blinking of an eyelid. Ah ! Miss Rhoda, there is no certainty in wrong. Dr. Grove may be baffled for the moment, may be overwhelmed by the force of presumptive evidence; but he is not the man to decide hastily, to base an opinion on appearances which oppose themselves to mature judgment formed on years of observation and reasoning. He is no young husband jealous of his own honour, jealous of his wife's love, the wife he married on so brief an acquaintance. No; he is a hard-headed, clear-eyed, calculating man, whose duty and inclination have made him watch Eva from her birth and you from your snow-bed ; who has, from your second birth in the school playground of the Bailey, made you his special study, as a complicated and abstruse problem it was his task to solve, or a chemical analysis pursued in the interests of science and friendship. His brain is his laboratory, but he is too wary to admit strangers into his secrets prematurely; and whether the problem be still unsolved, or his tests have failed, he pursues his study in private, and you, Miss Rhoda, are not the one to penetrate the arcana."], [310, "298 STUNG TO THE QUICK. It is true he believes the evidence of his eyes ; true, he sus pects \u2014 but not Eva. Still he only suspects, and his suspicions are vague. He is too wary to take a step save on sure ground; too rigidly upright to condemn on less than certain proof; but he is too wise to proclaim himself wise prema turely, and if he drifts with the stream he has not lost his oars. Rhoda was surprised at the outward calm of Mr. Raeburn the next morning; and fain would have dived below the impenetrable surface to see the wreck beneath. Once she made an effort to introduce the subject of her cousin's flight, her surprise, regret, and so forth; but he checked her at once. \" Miss Wearbank, I must hear no more of this. Your cousin is dead to me. I ask no sympathy, but I do ask silence. Let me not hear even the echo of her name again.\" She bowed her head in acquiescence, deeming his stern repudiation of interest in his wife a token, not only of sharp sorrow, but of power to tear her from his heart. Another mistake of hers ! Nothing could obliterate from his mind the picture of Eva in her innocent seeming, nothing replace her image, nothing banish the lingering touch of the fair head that nestled on his breast, or the arms that clasped his neck so lovingly, nothing shut from sight and hearing her dancing step and voice of melody. He could but shut it up in his heart out of the sight of others. If he could have shut her shame and his up also he would have done so at any cost. All that long sleepless night, when he lay wearily thinking, and striving not to think, on his solitary pillow; when the arm flung involuntarily across fell only on the empty space and disappointment; when there was no one to hear his groans and sighs, or tax him with his weakness, he mourned for his lost love, for his vanished happiness, for the bright delusion which had made the Tower a temporary Eden. But the sob of mortal anguish would be checked in its birth"], [311, "PROBLEMATIC. 299 by the wrath that rose at the thought how utterly he had been duped, how wantonly trifled with and tortured, how thoroughly and systematically blinded. In vain he racked himself for motives either for marrying him if she loved Cuthbert better, or for deserting him when once his wife ; that she had done this he felt was undeniable, the evidence was too plain, and the motive none that he could see save that worst of all, utter, shameless, vicious self abandonment. Oh ! the intense agony of that wild strife to thrust his idol from its niche, to contemplate his treasured wife only as a degraded outcast who had outraged him by ruining herself. Oh! the effort to separate and discriminate between what she had been to him and what she was and must henceforth be, the painful difficulty to reconcile the hideous fact with his own reason and perceptions of the pure and beautiful in her. Could he, in the first outburst of his wrath, have rushed into the presence of his wife's betrayer there had been murder done, but the utter inutility of pursuit was obvious, and whilst the impossibility of immediate vengeance chafed him, powerlessness to act left leisure to reflect. Rising in the early dawn he read, carefully read, the infamous papers which had wrecked his life, and there saw what made his blood chill and his pulse stop. It was not Cuthbert who had deliberately seduced his wife from her allegiance, but she who had inveigled him. His letters were tame and cold beside hers; the offer to fly with him came from her, the man had but acquiesced and found the dis guise ! How could he blame another man for falling into the snare himself had not escaped? If he had fallen a passive victim at her feet, what shield had that soft-hearted sailor? God help the men who fall into the lures of wanton beauty! All the tiny seeds of jealousy, all the minute insidious hints Rhoda had sown in his soul had fructified, and the"], [312, "300 STUNG TO THE QUICK. fruit was the credit he gave those lying documents. Still he had loved Eva too well to raise his arm against her now ; let her go: the time would come when he would settle his account with Cuthbert, not the less surely that it was delayed. Something whispered in his heart, \" Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord, I will repay ! \" but the man so wronged was in no mood to listen. Out of this chaos of thought, this tempest of passion, came forth in the morning light a cold, stern man, more reserved, if possible, than ever; but contemplation of the rigid brow and gleaming eye told Rhoda it was but a crust of ice over a volcano. The signs were not new to her. With an aspect which repelled condolence or approach to familiarity, Mr. Raeburn visited the works, attended to all overlying business matters, inspected the progress of building and drainage, but held aloof from Mr. Marsh. His own wound was too recent and too deep to bear to look on the father's. Perhaps had he gone there his own creed had been shaken, for honest Martin, true as steel, doggedly refused to believe in Eva's guilty flight. \" Aw'll nivvar believe it o' Miss Eva, if a' th' angels i' heaven 'ud coom down an' sweer it,\" persisted the tough old fellow, wiser in instinctive perception than his educated masters in logical deduction. The persistence of Martin, however, caused Dr. Grove to take him into his counsels, and if he henceforward would hear no ill of his young mistress, he ceased his open declara tions of her innocence. After a conference in Mr. Hesketh's office, at Dr. Grove's suggestion, the former started off to Sunderland to prosecute inquiries there. The doctor might have been the cooler and shrewder for the purpose, but he could not leave his patients, and time was an object. \"Well,\" said the doctor, when the surveyor returned after three days' absence, \"well?\""], [313, "PROBLEMATIC. 301 \" Well; but it's not well. I have had nothing but disappoint ment. The only news I have is bad, and proves the lad a rascal after all.\" \" Umph! and what is it? \" and up went the doctor's thumb nail and the shrouding hand, whilst he posed himself to listen. \"That news is soon told. The 'Polly' did sail with a lady aboard whom the captain called his wife. What she was like no one could tell, the clerks had something else to do than to look at the colour of a veil or a petticoat, or to measure a lady's height; she was 'shortish,' \u2014 that was all they could tell.\" \" Humph ! and quite too much, I should say. By-the-by, I have wormed out of Raeburn's coachman that he drove his mistress to the post-office one day lately, and heard her ask for a letter for 'E. M.' Pretty bold that fora delinquent, eh?\" \" All in a piece, all in a piece ! there's no knowing the audacity of a woman. But to my story. I went next to Reed's ; the house was closed, a set of ragged urchins were scraping the blistered green paint from the door, scoring the steps with chalk and ruddle, and making dirt pies on the flag-stone within the gate. My inquiries were answered by an expansion of dirty* fingers and raising of thumbs to a couple of grimy noses, followed very quickly by a corresponding rise of my stick. 'No, you won't ; strike yen o' yor awn size ! ' stopped the descending stick, and sent me away followed by a chorus, 'All round my hat I wears a green willow.' As they had no immediate neighbours I went to the parson; but not one word, good, bad, or indifferent, could I get out of him beyond this, that he didn't choose to answer any more questions about Mr. Reed ; he 'believed he had a fresh appointment somewhere,' but he ' didn't usually trouble himself about the movements of his curates after they left him.' I did not fail to tell him he was an unmannerly churl, though he did wear a clergyman's gown, and I left him in as high dudgeon as I was myself.\""], [314, "302 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \" But you surely did not abandon inquiry there ? \" \" No ; from shopkeepers and others I gleaned that the curate was more a favourite than the parson, and consequently became a mark for all the little indignities that petty malice could heap together ; and so, when some old college friend of Reed's offered him a living elsewhere, the congregation deserted the church, and the parson was huffed, and \u2014 serve him right.\" \" Well, but where are the Reeds gone ? \" \"That's more than I could find out; it was a 'hard name somewhere, a woman said, and that was all I could discover. Oh ! yes, I heard that one of the girls, poor Mary, I suppose, was in a decline through fretting after a rascally sailor who had left her for some one else. Nice thing that for a father to hear of his only son ! A pretty life I shall lead at home now ! \" \"Umph! and that's all?\" \" All ; yes, and sadly too much, unless I could have learnt something better. I shall alter my will next week.\" \"Then don't, Mr. Hesketh; that is my advice. If it's all true, the girl has run off with him and not he with the girl, and I don't think Ned would have behaved much better \u2014 under the circumstances. But he wouldn't have been less of a scoundrel either,\" muttered the doctor under his teeth in conclusion. Apparently Dr. Grove was baffled at last. CHAPTER XXXVII. THE LOST WIFE. Of course the facts of the case, as it was known, soon oozed out. A choleric man, however good-natured and genially disposed on ordinary occasions, is apt to become testy under feminine cross-examination, when at the same time chafing with indio-na-"], [315, "THE LOST WIFE. 303 tion at the misdeeds of one whose goodness he has hitherto upheld in face of all opposition. Such was Mr. Hesketh's plight. Under the moral thumbscrew he let out the secret of Mrs. Raeburn's elopement with Cuthbert, and regretted it ever after. Such a torrent of \" We told you so ! \" and \" There's your noble son ! \" \"A pretty innocent god-daughter indeed ! \" et cetera, et cetera, until he was at his wits' end. All Durham was agog. Mrs. Coulson held a levee and was unusually important. Mr. Marsh was declared to have ruined his two girls by indulgence ; Mr. Raeburn was voted a fool to have married the giggling baby ; and as for Cuthbert, one and all averred no better could have been expected from that young reprobate. Mrs. Hesketh was \" glad he was no son of hers,\" and the community at large became at once sympathetic, indignant, and abusive. Yards of tape and ounces of tea were served out to the denizens of courts and alleys with an overweight of gossip, and higher up the social scale, in coteries where there was a rustle of collegiate gowns amongst laic silks and satins, might be heard, \"My dear, is not this a terrible blow for poor Mr. Raeburn?\" \"Scandalous affair,\" \"Pity such a handsome man,\" \"Member of so good a family,\" and other murmurs of like nature to flavour the Mocha or the Madeira. One good little woman held aloof from the gossip, though compelled to believe a portion of its truth. She sorrowed for sin, and for the sufferers by the sin, and Dr. Grove found Aunt Dorothea, with very red eyes and puffy cheeks, putting aside her bundle of knitted triangles, for which there would now be no use. \"I could not bear to finish it for anyone else,\" said she apologetically, to the doctor, who was her chief confidant. As for Lucy, she was elated. The pride of the Marshes would be taken down at last. She should think that Miss Wearbank would not carry her head so high now, the stuck-up thing."], [316, "304 STUNG TO THE QUICK. Somehow she had not improved in Christian charity under her new singing-master, whatever flexibility he had imparted to her fingers or voice, whatever pathos she had learnt to infuse into a duet, whatever skill in difficult arpeggio pas sages. Aunt Dorothy was not too well satisfied with the result of Signor Ronchetti's teachings, for she felt that Lucy was relapsing into her old habits, and becoming more than ever conceited and supercilious. But Signor Ronchetti did not seem to think so. \" La bella Signora \" might have been a miracle of perfection in his sight, for surely never was master so entranced with a pupil before, so utterly enamoured. It is true nothing of this was allowed to be seen by careful Aunt Dorothy, and if Mamma saw more warmth than was consistent with mere singing lessons, she was herself so dazzled by the graceful attentions of the Italian, that she ascribed it all to the delightful empressement of foreigners. Lucy could have enlightened her; but the love made in secret was sweet, and so she did not think it absolutely requisite to say that, more than once, she had met the Signor by the river-side, and wandered through its most sequestered paths long after the evening shadows had fallen, giving and receiving confidences in most lover-like fashion. Mrs. Hesketh never dreamt of this, or that, when she rejoiced that shame had come to the Marshes, her daughter shared her rejoicing with a sympathizing foreigner, who saw Lucy's friends and enemies only through her own eyes, and was quite willing to believe her brother as much a scapegrace as she chose to represent him. And where was Eva whilst her name sullied the lips of Durham dames and misses, whilst her indulgent father lay a helpless paralytic for her sake, and her doting husband hid the grief that ate his heart like a canker, and forbade the utterance of her name ? Where, whilst honest Martin dared to be her only open champion, and Dr. Grove kept"], [317, "THE LOST WIFE. 305 his scepticism to himself, and Rhoda seemed sad and sorry, and unobtrusively sympathetic with both the chief mourners ? The spiders have another secret now. High up in the turret chamber, high up above even Rhoda's room, with a thickly mattressed floor and an enclosed stair between herself and even a stray housemaid's ear, Eva languished, a lonely, helpless, hopeless prisoner. No clumsy elbow, no kind hand had dashed to the ground the strongly medicated tea, for which the tearful wife uttered such cordial thanks; and Eva slept a sleep like that which knows no waking, whilst her unconscious husband, in a travelling cap her little fingers had embroidered, also slept, leaning against the cushion of a first-class carriage, and was borne farther and farther away with every puff of the warning engine. Was there no voice to rouse the sleeper? no eye to watch the stealthy foot that, shod with softest fur, crept past the rooms where servants likewise slept more heavily than ordinary ? Alas, no human eye ! And Rhoda stood unquestioned by her sleeping cousin's side and tested the potency of her drug by a rude shake. Rhoda, ever strong, then doubly strong with hate (the fiends help those who do them service such as this), lifted the light and fragile form of Eva, and bore her upwards, higher, higher, higher, until she laid her burden down upon the mattressed floor and paused to breathe. But for a moment ; then down went the muffled trap, the staircase door turned on its silent hinges, was locked, and left to look as it had looked for harmless months before. Down went the fur-clad foot again, the maple desk was charged with its perilous secret (for Rhoda had already secured the keys), Eva's jewels were obtained and secreted, a meta morphosis completed, the gothic door unlocked and unbolted with scarcely a creak, and at two o'clock in the morning a sailor boy , was to be seen walking briskly down the road from the carriage gate in the direction of Durham. That v"], [318, "306 STUNG TO THE QUICK sailor was Rhoda, hastening to post a letter to Cuthbert, It ran thus : \u2014 \" Fool, \"Do you think that I, Rhoda Wearbank, spurned and insulted by your relatives, would ally myself to them? \u2014 that / should throw myself away upon a wavering dolt like you? \u2014 that I would bear the hated name of Hesketh? No. I vowed when first I saw you to trample on your heart as your sister trampled on mine. I have done it. I spurn you. I have used you as a tool to work my will elsewhere, and now cast you aside. My work is completed. The 'sailor's rigging ' suits me admirably. The sailor posts this. Captain Hesketh may sail without his wife, and look in vain for his particularly loving \" Eve.\" Rhoda's exultation had got the better of her discretion. That her missive lost its sting she could not know. She did not see it crushed in a strong hand and tossed into the river. The Tower was built due north and south, the turret win dow facing the east and the summit of the steep wooded bank, along the foot of which ran the stream which fed the waterfall. Consequently the earliest morning beams fell on its dia mond panes and on its dreaming inmate ; but the sun had journeyed southwards, made prisms of the foam bubbles be neath the fall, given a ruddier hue to the brown leaves, cast squat shadows of the bushes, of the grim doctor and his attendant seekers, and darted fiery glances through the draw ing-room window and triumphant Rhoda, before the helpless dreamer waked to find herself a prisoner. At first she thought herself still asleep and dreaming, as a heavy lethargy hung about her ; but soon she grew assured"], [319, "THE LOST WIFE. 307 of the hideous reality. As if to dispel all possibility of doubt, there lay food by her side, and a note from Rhoda. \" Eva ! \" You won and married the man I loved. I stood behind the crimson curtains and heard his first confession that memorable New Year's Eve. I vowed to separate you. I have done so. You see him no more. He will deem you false, and me a pitying angel. Am I not avenged ? \"Rhoda.\" Eva lost consciousness again, and when she recovered from her long swoon, the twilight shadows were creeping round the hill-top ; still there was light enough to read once more those coldly cruel lines. Unable to comprehend the possibility of so much villany, unable to fathom the depths of a nature so antagonistic to her own, Eva crouched upon the mattress, gazing on the scented slip of paper, her fair hair crushed back from her forehead with one hand, as if to aid her bewildered intellect. As the shades deepened on the hill, the mists cleared from her mental vision, and she saw such a picture of ingra titude and iniquity as made her shudder. Worse than all was the suggestion that her husband would condemn her as unchaste. As this blow struck her with its full force, she sprang to her feet, screaming aloud; then strove to tear the mattress from the trap with ineffectual energy. In vain \u2014 in vain. Those little fingers were never made to rend that linen tick, or raise a padding so secured. She wore out her strength in shrieks and cries for help, in a wild hope some one within the Tower might hear her; then, as she remembered how far she was isolated above"], [320, "308 STUNG TO THE QUICK. inhabited rooms, she sank sobbing on the mattressed floor in despair and exhaustion. More than twenty-four hours had elapsed since she had tasted food, yet she felt no inclination to touch that placed for her. In times of overwhelming agony like hers food becomes positively repulsive. There was milk in a pitcher, and of that she drank ; but the twilight deepened, and the stars came slowly out to glim mer in the midnight and fade before the dawn, yet she still lay sobbing and moaning, too distracted to sleep, too be numbed to think of food. Gradually the sobs ceased ; tired nature sought renewal in slumber, broken, however, by frequent sighs and moans ; and for some hours, happily for her, oblivion sealed her eyelids. She had lain in that drugged sleep whilst servants were scouring wood and meadow in quest of her, else she might have seen one or other cross the hill behind the Tower, and haply have caught a wandering eye looking upwards from between the trees ; but that chance had gone by un known to her, and as the season was too far advanced for cattle to be a-field, there was slight probability that even a wandering cow-boy should cross the meadow to see any sig nal she might make. Not that a thought of signals occurred to her when she awaked on the second morning following her incarceration. A dull sense of misery seemed to overpower active thought ; but this in time wore away, and with the returning sense of her position, of the ignominy attached to her pure name, the grief of husband and father, the treachery of the foster sister she had loved so well, came fresh paroxysms of tears, fresh shrieks for aid, and renewed efforts to reach the trap. No knife had been furnished with her food or she would have ripped the mattress up; but even then the bolt was outside, and a locked door at the foot of the stair. Alas ! for the petted child, the cherished wife. Hopelessly, helplessly immured within those strong stone walls, with a"], [321, "THE LOST WIFE. 309 gaoler harder and more pitiless than the stone, with her most sensitive fibres thrilling beneath the imputation of shame, what was to preserve her from madness or idiocy? Day after day went by in the same unvarying monotony \u2014 the same unmitigated torture. The trap was lifted in the dead of night for the supply of food. On the first of these occa sions E\\a was asleep; the second time \u2014 for Rhoda did not return the following night \u2014 Eva attempted to shriek out an alarm, but Rhoda bore down the enfeebled girl, covered her mouth closely, and threatened her with immediate deapi should she dare to raise her voice again. Rhoda provided against such a contingency in future. Eva ate and drank from sheer necessity, and slept perforce, During this sleep food was introduced; when the weather became cold a thick shawl was thrust in, and finally a book or two. Eva longed for her Bible, that comfort in all seasons of trial or affliction ; but that was not amongst them, and she never saw her gaoler to prefer her request until weary weeks had rolled by \u2014 weeks to be reckoned only by the echoes of church bells, the only sounds that reached her turret prison. For the first week or two Eva lived in the conviction, that her dear Frank would search unceasingly until he found her ; or, if he should be misled by chicanery, that nothing would deter her father from seeking his lost child. As the days and weeks went round, the hope narrowed and dwindled with the shortening daylight; and her prayers for deliverance became more intense and piteous as the prospect of escape faded out."], [322, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 310 CHAPTER XXXVIII. FRIENDS DRAWN CLOSER. Frank Raeburn was a changed man. Reserved and proud he had ever been, but his pride was not of an offensive type, and his reserve no more than sufficed to repel intrusion. From the date of Eva's supposed flight his reserve inten sified ; he spoke little, and then only when absolutely requisite. To his dependents his manner was more imposing, his orders were more peremptory; with his equals a frigid politeness marked his whole demeanour, and held question and sympathy alike aloof. The shadow of a great sorrow rested on his face, and never lifted. Still he was neither morose nor cynical. He was merely a man shut up within himself, too proud to allow the world to intrude into the private chambers of his heart and note whether regret or anger predominated. The works commenced at the colliery, both at the pit and in the village, proceeded with alacrity. Cesspools and ash-heaps disappeared from the roadway, drain age was continued, abuses connected with the pitmen's fort nightly pay abolished, and various other reforms carried out under Mr. Raeburn's eye. It was true that he had lost all interest in these improve ments ; but, having once recognised a duty in the task before him, he allowed no private grief, no selfish sorrow, to stand in the way of its performance. Yet he had no longer his active little coadjutor by his side, and many of the changes inaugurated by Eva were of a class beyond masculine inter ference. Many were the coarse jokes bandied between the pitmen's wives and daughters on the \" fine lady who cam' te' lairn poor wimmen how to be gud, and wor sae vartuous hersen.\" But Frank heard none of these; silence and respect surrounded"], [323, "FRIENDS DRAWN CLOSER. 311 him like a halo; hence it came that he heard neither comments nor rumours afloat. It had been better for both himself and Eva if he had. In forbidding the mention of his wife's name, he had not only closed the avenues of his heart against scandal and ill tidings, but had closed them against a ray of light. Had he but heard the whispers afloat, he might have pondered their meaning, and detected imposture. As it was, Rhoda had everything pretty much her own way, and was as busy as such a plotter must be under her external calm. Dr. Grove, in spite of the interdict, had detailed Mr. Hesketh's mission to Sunderland, and its unsatisfactory result. \" Did you expect anything different ? \" asked Mr. Raeburn, coldly, and, it must be told, curtly. \" I did,\" answered the doctor, as curtly. \" And Mr. Hesketh \u2014 what induced him to prosecute so needless an inquiry ? \" \"A belief that his son was incapable of villany so gross.\" \" There is no rule by* which you can measure a child's capacity for wickedness by the father's capacity for goodness. I presume he learned that much by his journey. Mr. Marsh was easier of conviction.\" \"Mr. Raeburn, you labour under a delusion; Mr. Marsh, happily for himself, is unconscious of the stigma on his daughter's fame. The fit followed so closely the abrupt intel ligence of Mrs. Raeburn's disappearance by murder or other wise, that particulars never reached him. Nor do I intend them to do,\" concluded the doctor emphatically. \"You are right,\" assented Mr. Raeburn, sternly. \"Better believe her dead than dishonoured. \" \" Have you seen your father-in-law yet ? \" asked the doctor, after a pause. Mr. Raeburn winced, but answered quietly, \"No; I thought it best to avoid a painful meeting; but if he knows nothing of the actual facts, I perhaps had better see him shortly.\""], [324, "312 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \" Better go at once. I'm on my way* thither. Give me your arm up the hill. It does not look well for a young man to neglect an old one, who is a fellow-sufferer ; and Mr. Marsh has suffered, both physically and mentally.\" \" His life is not in any danger, I presume ? \" asked Frank, quickly. \" Not now ; it has been. The use of his right side is gone, and his speech is much affected ; whether either, or both, may be restored, is at present impossible to say. With very great care he may recover, in time ; but it is doubtful. In this, as indeed in all cases, the physician waits the decision of a Higher Power.\" \" Do you not think, doctor, that Miss Wearbank's presence here would be desirable ? \" said the younger gentleman, as they reached the house, before which lay a thick mass of refuse dye-wood from the carpet factory across the river below the bridge. \" I not only think so, but have urged the point with the young lady; but Miss Wearbank is peculiar and declines.\" \" On what grounds ? \" \" Mr. Raeburn's likelihood to brood over his \u2014 pardon me, I did but answer your question, \" said the doctor, interrupting himself, on observing the contraction of the other's brow ; \" and also the disaffection among the servants whom she had hired with difficulty, and who would be sure to quit the house, and leave you to wait on yourself, if she did not remain to keep them together. Empty and singular houses, you know, do get queer names. \"Well, Martin; how is your master?\" \" Nowt te brag on, doctor. Gud day, Maister Raeburn. Aw'm reeght glad yo'an sand i' yor heart te coom an' see ar maister at last. Aw thowt 'twur hard if nobbut Nance an' mawsel an' th' doctor here cared a pin fur him. Hout, but aw am fain yor coom.\" Miss Wearbank, who had contrived to spend most mornings in South Street since the old doctor's reminder, was found"], [325, "FRIENDS DRAWN CLOSER. 313 in the chamber of the invalid, as noiseless and gentle as when she first won Nancy's favour, and confirmed Martin's distrust in the same room, by* the dying bed of another invalid. Mr. Marsh, in a few low, indistinct words, expressed his satisfaction at Frank's presence, and with the pressure of his left hand conveyed a world of mutual sorrow and sympathy. The interview was short; but it established a bond of union between the two men never after broken, and led to a direct result in the course of another week or two. As Mrs. Raeburn had said, \" Frank would never behave rudely to a lady,\" least of all to one so obviously anxious to cultivate his good graces as Rhoda. Unaware of the prize for which she strove, unaware that she aimed at winning him for herself, after beguiling him to divorce his wife, and return to Antigua, and that she calculated to accomplish all before Cuthbert's two year's voyage expired ; unaware that more cogent reasons than even these required her presence in the Tower, and, believing as he did, the doctor's rendering of her motives for remaining at the head of his household, her conduct had, nevertheless, something in it which grated harshly on his fine sense of propriety. Not more than three weeks had elapsed since the light was quenched on his hearth, yet there had been time for a delicately minded woman to perceive the false position she would occupy by remaining as mistress in the house of a young man, neither widower, bachelor, nor relative, and where there was no elderly matron to sanction her presence. Her place was by the side of her benefactor. If any undue partiality towards himself existed (as once he had more than suspected), still stronger was the urgency for her retirement. Thinking this he set a watch on her \u2014 he had no need to set a guard on himself \u2014 and saw and felt that every look and tone of Rhoda's held a mine of hidden feeling, as it were, kept in check by a strong will. Still, there was nothing in her demeanour beyond the tender sympathy a sister might"], [326, "314 STUNG TO THE QUICK. feel for a brother so wronged, no more than honest indigna tion at such an unprincipled desertion of so kind a hus band. But she was not his sister\u2014 not Eva's sister\u2014 and if she did not feel the position perplexing, Mr. Raeburn did. One by one the servants insisted on quitting. \" There was summat uncanny about the place, an' the hinnies war na like to stay,\" argued one of the men, himself infected with the general and growing fear that was creeping over them all. \" There were sounds an' seets about th' house an' grounds enough to mak' yen's flesh creep.\" He had \" seen mair than yence a shape glidin' through th' shrubbery at neet, an' vanish at the wall ; \" and one and all deposed that unearthly sounds had been heard at midnight, when there was no wind to howl or scream. So the Tower was voted \"uncanny\" and \"haunted,\" with out a dissentient voice, and the wiseacres determined rather to resign their wages than remain, with the single exception of Beck, the groom, who said \" He wur nut goin ' to leave a gude maister for nane o' their dom'd tomfoolery. He'd ne call te th' shrubbery; an' th' shap o' th' bonny queen's yead on th' goulden suvreins, an' th' chink o' them, wad mak him deaf an' blind te ivverythin' canny or uncanny.\" Rhoda combated the general disaffection for some time; but a herd-boy, who, seeking a lost sheep on the hill pasture, had caught a glimpse of a white face against the turret window-panes in the dim twilight, added his voice to the panic, and nothing remained but to acquaint Mr. Raeburn. To her surprise he asked no questions ; the place had had a weird name ever since his mother died, and his father fled in remorse to other lands. The temporary occupancy of his bachelor uncle had not, he knew, removed any mistaken impression; so Mr. Raeburn, having no suspicion of fresh food for superstition, and grown too careless about so small a matter as attendance, did not trouble himself to remonstrate with ignorance, but let itpass. \" Pay them their wages and let them go, if they are dis-"], [327, "FRIENDS DRAWN CLOSER. 315 satisfied; that is, if you, Miss Wearbank, can in any way dispense with their services until I make fresh arrange ments.\" So they went, all but Beck, who slept in one of the rooms over the stables, and gave it as his opinion, and as a slice of encouragement to Miss Wearbank, that if \"The Tower wur hanted it wur hanted by 'wick'* yens;\" and he therefore bade her keep up her heart. With Mr. Marsh's concurrence, and that of Dr. Grove, the old house in South Street was closed, and the invalid carefully removed to the Tower, accompanied by Martin and Nancy, his two faithful retainers, who had served him so long that they had forgotten the insecure tenure of servitude. Bella, however, shook her head, and elected to \" Gang back te her minnie. She couldn't bide in an uncanny hoose sic es they were ganging te.\" That arrangement had in part been contemplated by Mr. Raeburn from the hour when he stood first by the side of his afflicted father-in-law, and felt that they had a sorrow in common. It would weld the two households together, give a sanc tion to Rhoda's position, and exclude from the family al mere hirelings. As no visitors had been received since his great loss, fewer servants were required. Miss Wearbank might engage such as were necessary ; and that active young lady bestirred her self, but only managed to secure a non-resident handmaiden for Nancy. Perhaps Miss Wearbank could have told the secret of her failure, but she did not. To Martin the removal was a source of secret self-gratu lation. Rhoda had never been a favourite of his, and since Mrs. Raeburn's disappearance she was in worse odour than ever. It was his constant affirmation, \" Nowt shall persuade me that black-eyed lass didn't ken mair o' our bairn than we de, for a' she looks sae fair and fause.\" * Quick \u2014 living."], [328, "316 STUNG TO THE QUICK. He rejoiced in an opportunity to watch her movements without seeming to do so, no arguments, no evidence, having for one instant shaken his faith in Eva's innocence. Doctor Grove might analyse and reason, dovetail facts and circumstances, philosophise and deduce, and be staggered at last by so slight a coincidence as a \"shortish lady the captain called his wife.\" Martin was neither sage nor philo sopher, but instinct and affection more than atoned for what he lacked in logical acumen. Still he was not deficient in common sense or in the experience of observant age. Nancy's strong objection to removal was the change and the extra work the many flights of stairs at the Tower would entail on her, but she was soon conciliated. \" Miss Rhoda was so kind, so considerate,\" she told Martin after wards. \" Would you think it, Martin,\" said she, in amazement, \" that Miss Rhoda, who ne'er soiled her hands an' she could help it, has ne'er let a housemaid lay brush or duster on her bedroom sin she came here?\" \" An' why nut, aw should like te knaw ? \" \" Oh ! young lasses are so careless nowadays. Miss Rhoda did not mind to have her trinklum-tranklums upset.\" \" Hout ! What were her things better than Miss Eva's \" (he never compassed the \"Mrs. Raeburn,\" save on state occasions); had she owt she wur heightened o' the hinnies seein', aw'd loike te ken? She wur none sae fond o' wark as te de it fur nowt.\" \" There's nothing strange in a young lady doing out her own room, that you need to make a fuss about it.\" \"Aw made no fuss. Aw wur like te think, hinny,\" res ponded he, apologetically. \"Like to think! Then just think better o' the lass. I'm sartain she's as kind as can be. She said she would not suffer me, at my age, to mount so many stairs to the sax vants' bedrooms, and so I am to sleep in the housekeeper's room on the ground floor. It isn't every young lass would"], [329, "FRIENDS DRAWN CLOSER. 317 be so considerate. And there's master, too, has had a bed made in poor dear Mrs. Raeburn's dressing-room. I'm sure she's downright thoughtful.\" \"Thoughtful be hanged. Aw'll nivor believe but she's made away wi' our puir bairn somehow or other. Murdered her mayhap. But you hold your tongue, Nance, and aw'll ferret it out.\" \" Hout, mon ! are ye daft, that ye let your tongue wag that gate?\" interposed Nancy, with a fearful glance around, lest the kitchen walls should have had the proverbial ears. A week or two later Martin said, one night after supper, when the girl and Beck were gone, \"Aw dinnet ken what's come te Towzer sin we came here. He whines, an' moans, an' barks at times fearfu'.\" \" Belike he sees an' hears something we cannot \u2014 something awful,\" suggested the old woman, in an under tone, with a shudder and a glance over her shoulder, as if she expected the \"something awful\" to be standing there. \" Belike he divs nowt o' th' soort. He may hear an' scent what's in th' wind, an' we'll see. Lat alone me an' Towzer te ferret it oot, if theere's owt wrang i' th' wind.\" But he did not ferret it out. Padded floors and stone walls keep secrets long when curious ears are kept at a distance. About this time poor Towzer fell under a ban. He was accused of abstracting limbs of poultry or game from the larder, severed joints from griskins lying ready for a paw, and all that could be supposed within canine reach. So Towzer was once more condemned to the chain, and then \" that cat \" came in for an amount of towelling selina did not merit any more than Towzer."], [330, "318 STUNG TO THE QUICK. CHAPTER XXXIX. WHAT LURKED IN RHODA'S HEART. As a natural consequence, Dr. Grove, in his attendance on Mr. Marsh, was a frequent visitor at the Tower. Closely buttoned up in a macintosh, he defied the weather, and the sober grey steed he bestrode splashed with as little concern up the drive, which, in heavy rains, was flooded by the overflow from ravine and pond. It was a wet November, and a daily trot under dripping skies or dripping trees was not too agreeable ; but the attentive doctor, with his best friend in charge, cared neither for rain nor distance. More than once his son (over from Kelloe for the day) had borne him company, and whilst Mr. Marsh engrossed the atten tion of the elder man of science, the younger endeavoured to make himself agreeable to Miss Wearbank. He had made the most of his privilege, as groomsman at the wedding, to be as frequent a visitor at the Grey Tower as the onerous nature of his professional duties \u2014 to say nothing of distance \u2014 permitted. He had hovered about Miss Wearbank with a belief that there was a sort of mutual attraction, was himself greatly fascinated, and, though not absolutely in love, began to estimate her as a much more eligible match than \" carrotty Lucy.\" Through the rain that last day of November he rode home, fully impressed with the belief that he had only to ask and have, and he there upon determined to give Miss Wearbank the opportunity of accept ing him the very next time he found his way to the Tower. How far he was indebted to gossip for this determination is not known ; but it is quite certain that the many-tongued dame had prated of Lucy's Italian friend, and the moonlight rambles by the river, and as certain the prattle had penetrated to the labyrinths of Kelloe. Martin, meanwhile, had frequent conferences with Dr. Grove, ostensibly to receive instructions respecting his master, whom he"], [331, "WHAT LURKED IN RHODA'S HEART. 319 now served as temporary valet, but, in truth, to confide odd scraps of information he had to impart : such, for instance, as \" Miss Rhoda's new-fangled notion of makin' her own bed an' keepin' folk oot of her room ; \" and then Beck's rumours of shapes and sounds which had driven the servants away. He spoke, too, of Miss Rhoda's fancy for sitting alone in her own room \" hours at a stretch, \" her excessive attention to Mr. Raeburn, which, in his mind, \"wur unbecomin',\" her habit \" o' comin' on yan unawares,\" and a tendency to start ner vously when herself surprised. These were trifles; but trifles which renewed Dr. Grove's suspicions that Rhoda was playing a part, and convinced him as firmly as Martin that she had had a hand in the removal of Mrs. Raeburn. He had been to the Tower one fine, dry day in December, and having recommended a drive to his patient, had looked on whilst Mr. Raeburn, with the tenderness of a son, helped Martin to lift Mr. Marsh into the carriage, and Miss Wearbank hovered about with wraps and cushions. There was nothing but duty in the act, but there was something in the manner \u2014 a zeal which made itself felt. And then there was superadded a care for the younger man, who she said, \" Really should wear a shawl this chilly morning. It is so dangerous to drive through the air with throat and chest exposed, especially after your long residence in the tropics. You have grown very careless of yourself.\" It was not the mere offer of the shawl, but the modulation of the voice, the almost pathetic anxiety in the upturned eye as she offered to adjust the folds, and did it with tremulous fin gers, which came as if by accident in contact with the chin or hand of the wearer ; the expressive something which told of speechless devotion, of love subdued by fate. \" Bah ! \" said Dr. Grove, to himself, as he walked down the drive in the wake of the carriage, in his common ruminating attitude, \" that woman makes me sick. She's angling for Raeburn again, or I'm no prophet. But she might as well angle for a"], [332, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 320 stone, for he neither hears nor sees her. Calypso must fail to catch Ulysses, who is blind as well as deaf. No, no, young lady; that man's mind is pre-occupied. My Ned may be gudgeon enough to swallow your bait \u2014 the flat! \u2014 but not Frank Raeburn. What an irresistible siren that woman must be \u2014 all the fellows who come near her succumb like so many boobies. I expect Ned will be making a fool of himself one of these days, if I don't look sharp. Better have stuck to his old flame Lucy ; better the vinegar of her tongue than the gall in Rhoda's heart \u2014 better be tinged with vanity than steeped in craft. Lucy may be silly, but Rhoda is dangerous.\" The doctor stopped in his walk, and, with the one hand behind him and the other still up to his mouth, looked down on the ground as if he were asking questions of the gnomes beneath. \" What has that woman done with Eva ? I would give a thousand pounds to solve that riddle. It's clear she wanted her out of the way; she did her best to prevent the match, and I'd venture an oath she's doing her best to dissolve it. If there has been an elopement, the witch encouraged and connived at it. But I cannot bring myself to think that guileless little girl could be so infamous, even if Hesketh's son could be such a confounded rascal. No, there's been foul work somewhere. Whether she's murdered the girl \u2014 and I do not think she would hesitate if she stood in her way \u2014 or whether she has had her carried off and confined in some lunatic asylum, I am puzzled to decide. No, there were no strange footmarks about the place ; she could not do that without accomplices. She can't have her hid in her own room surely. No, that's preposterous. The whole tribe of servants searched the Tower from top to bottom.\" (With an exception, Dr. Grove \u2014 a chamber you know nothing of.) \"I never was baffled before, and I'll not be beaten now. I will get to the bottom of this mystery before I'm a month older, or I'll never write another prescription.\" There was another pause, another dive into the inner depths, and he resumed his indistinct mutterings."], [333, "WHAT LURKED IN RHODA'S HEART. 321 \"It's a ticklish thing to bring a charge of crime one can't substantiate, or I'd half a mind to accuse that woman of murder, and set the police to work to find the body. If that Raeburn's jealousy had not taken fire like tow, and his pride shut him up from consultation and argument, I'd have found it out before this. As for trusting unattested papers \u2014 bosh ! I must say that man's jealous credulity deserves the punishment it gets. I have no patience with a man who hugs a bullet to avoid a probe. Humph! I'll be off to Sun derland to-morrow. Hesketh may be a very good surveyor ; but he is a woefully lame detective. Let me try ray hand now.\" Whilst the doctor, intent on the discovery of a crude something to which he could give no definite shape, was near ing Sunderland station, Rhoda, oppressed with undefinable fears, put on a thick shawl and a garden hat and strolled into the grounds. The atmosphere of the Tower was oppres sive, not so much from the enormous fires piled up in all the grates and draining the oxygen, but every room and every corner teemed with impish shapes that mocked and taunted her with imbecility, and urged her to \"make sure.\" Martin had driven both his masters out in the phaeton, and Beck, in front of the stable, was polishing up spare har ness. She spoke to him in passing, as was the wont now (she felt the need of all men's good opinion), and stepped on briskly, humming an opera air until out of sight. Then her pace changed, was hurried at first, then slackened, and when she had crossed the extensive lawn, and reached the wooden gate which terminated the south-west boundary of the grounds, breaking the circling line of woodland, she paused and leaned thereon in moody agitation; her eyes towards the city so close to sight, and yet so far from her intro spective vision. She had overheard Nancy rate Martin for the depredations of Towzer, and Martin accuse Nancy of being drunk or dreaming, the poor brute having been chained in the stable, w"], [334, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 322 and then a final vow of summary vengeance on the cat, and for the first time since the maple desk did her service she felt a sense of insecurity. She began to feel on how slight a thing detection might hang. When there were a number of thriftless, extravagant servants about, who helped themselves to whatsoever lay handy, thrice Eva's supply of food would not have been missed; but Nancy, although not niggardly, was a careful housekeeper, who suffered no intru sion in cupboard or pantry; so nothing could be abstracted without her knowledge. She had contrived to lay in a store of dry food, biscuits, buns, tartlets; but a young lady, with a well-known face, could not walk into a baker's shop for a loaf, nor into a dairy for milk and carry them away with her unnoticed.\" Then Nancy's room door fronted the pantry and larder; the click of a latch, the jar of earthenware in contact, might rouse the old woman, who slept lightly, as most old people do. What was to be done ? While she mused and brooded, her face darkening with her thoughts, a sturdy gipsy woman with a pedlar's basket approached the gate, and after offering her wares, asked mysteriously \u2014 \"Have you seen the spirit yet?\" \" Spirit ! \" said Rhoda, \" what spirit ? \" \" Oh! the ghost, to be sure \u2014 the white lady that walks.\" \" There are no worse spirits than whisky or brandy here, my good woman ; \" and Rhoda turned away scornfully as she spoke. \" Stop, proud lady ! There is a worse spirit here than those. It is the evil spirit before me. I read the stars aright. There is murder in your eyes \u2014 murder in your heart. An evil spirit walks abroad in you.\" And the woman shook her head, and muttered as she went along. Rhoda stood transfixed. Had the woman indeed power to search the heart ? Was murder truly lurking there ? It might be so, for moodily she wandered through the wood and to the ravine ere she returned home."], [335, "DR. GROVE DECLARES HIS DOUBTS. 323 Beck was leading the horse from the shafts of the phaeton as she passed him the second time. Mr. Marsh and Mr. Raeburn were in the dining-room ; they had been to Raeburn village, and the former appeared fatigued. With how much solicitude did Rhoda bend over him, and seek to adjust pillows and footstool to his need. How much tender assiduity did she display in the promotion of his comfort. How ready were her hands and feet to do his bidding or Frank Raeburn's, and how blind were they both to the secret springs of action. How httle the black thoughts in her heart were seen through the veil of flesh. Was there no magnetic thrill to tell that good man he had fostered a serpent, who was stinging his child to death? \u2014 no recoil when he passed his hand over her shining locks of hair, and said she was \" a dear good baim \" ? \u2014 nothing to warn Frank Raeburn that his true wife pined in misery* under his own roof, and that a malignant fiend in human shape sat at his board, and smiled on him from Eva's place with murder in her heart? Nothing! Instinct was dumb, and Rhoda's star seemed in the ascendant. CHAPTER XL. DR. GROVE DECLARES HIS DOUBTS. Edwin Grove (as his father predicted) did make a fool of himself. Having found it more difficult to \"propose\" to a regal dame like Rhoda than he had calculated, he ventured to put the momentous question on paper, and after wasting half a quire in the effort, consigned his fate to the Kelloe post bag and to the gossips. Miss Wearbank coolly \"declined the honour,\" and then, instead of tossing the gentleman's letter into the ready fire. as you or I might have done, good reader, contrived, whilst"], [336, "324 STUNG TO THE QUICK. in Durham, posting her disdainful reply, to drop the fateful billet so that it reached Miss Hesketh's hands. At least Signor Ronchetti professed to have picked it up on the door-step, and protested against the spoliation of its secrets; but Lucy overpowered his feeble protests, devoured the contents, burst into a passion of tears, and tearing the \"disgusting scrawl\" into strips, threw it on the carpet. Mrs. Coulson, kind soul, came plodding through the snow to ask after Mrs. Hesketh's influenza, or the latest news, or to bring a Christmas invitation, and being shown into the unoccupied room, where the tell-tale scraps lay disregarded, from a habit of picking up such litter (the result of overweening neatness, she declared), collected the stray fragments. With a curious twinkle of the eyes, which rested on a signature and part of the superscription, she consigned to her reticule seasoning for a score of tea-parties to come; and the Gilesgate coterie was speculating on Miss Wearbank's acceptance before Edwin Grove had time to read his rejec tion, and curse his folly for being ass enough to propose. The shrewd old doctor, seeking for any information cal culated to throw a light on Eva's disappearance, or clear two fair characters from a foul imputation, pursued his inquiries in other directions than Mr. Hesketh, and in another manner. The clerk of the church \u2014 under the influence of a fee \u2014 remembered that Mr. Reed's new living was somewhere either in Lancashire or Yorkshire, and the name of the place was \" Something Bridge.\" The pew-opener, on the other hand, similarly stimulated, affirmed it was \" Owther i' Yorksheer or Darbysheer, and 'twus Somethin Dale.\" On the wharf he ascertained that, though the \" Polly \" was chartered for two years on a trading voyage from port to port, its destination was suddenly changed to Gibraltar, and it was possible that, for lack of a suitable cargo, she might return home in ballast or put into Lisbon or Oporto for a lading of fruit or wine. In either case the barque might"], [337, "DR. GROVE DECLARES HIS DOUBTS. 325 be looked for within a week or two, weather permitting. Some days elapsed before Dr. Grove reconciled the con flicting terminations \"Bridge\" and \"Dale.\" He had enlisted the services of a college proctor with whom he was intimate ; and that painstaking friend, after consulting clergy lists and documents not patent to the laity, after floundering through a swamp *of orthographical Reeds, found that the Rev. J. Reed had been inducted into the living of Pately Bridge, Wensley dale, Yorkshire. \" Oh ! one more version of the old story of the knights and the metal shield ! \" exclaimed the doctor, when he thanked his friend for the information. When Miss Wearbank dropped her gracious missive for Edwin Grove into the Durham post-office, his father was ringing the bell of the Grey Tower on an errand to Mr. Raeburn. Learning that the lady had walked into the city, he evinced some surprise that she should have passed him on the road unseen. What would Dr. Grove have thought had he been told that she had whirled past him in a phaeton at the entrance of Framwellgate, checking his progress at the crossing, and that he had regarded her attentively without recognition? He found Frank Raeburn reading to Mr. Marsh, who sat in an easy chair by the fire, in an attitude of profound attention. After a few preliminary questions to the slowly progressing patient, he said \u2014 \" You surely have not been sitting in the house all day, Raeburn?\" \" The morning had no charms to tempt me out,\" was the reply. \" The snow has been over these three hours, and the air is as bracing now as frost can make it. Put on cloak and hat, and come with me for a constitutional, instead of roasting yourself there before your time. Come, I need a refreshing chat, and have no time to loiter here for it."], [338, "326 STUNG TO THE QUICK. A glance, intended for Mr. Raeburn's eye only, enforced an invitation he might otherwise have declined, but he read in it something beyond the mere \" constitutional ; \" so, revers ing his open book on the table, as a guarantee for speedy return, he joined Dr. Grove at the hall-door. He was not the same man whose portrait formed one of the group some eighteen or twenty months ago; or rather he was the same with a difference ; the brow had contracted in the silent endurance of pain, the lips had set in stern, smileless composure; but the throbbing nostril and fierce eye told of strife and fire beneath the exterior of rigid ice. \"Well?\" said he to the doctor, who stalked on, erect and sedate, through the crunching snow, the cloudland tribute of many wintry days. \"Well?\" \" I was in Sunderland on Thursday last, Mr. Raeburn, making inquiries.\" \"Well?\" The broad chest heaved under the cloak, and the eye shot forth a sharp flash, if the monosyllable was guarded. \" I have discovered Mr. Reed's whereabouts.\" \" In what does that discovery concern me ? You speak as if you believed it of importance.\" \" I was under the impression you might desire to write, or otherwise communicate with the reverend gentleman.\" \" To what purpose ? \" The question, put quietly and with a tone of surprise, was echoed much more strongly by the doctor. \" To what purpose ! Surely I need not remind you that Mary Reed was Cuthbert Hesketh's promised wife \u2014 sweet hearts they had been many a year ? \" \" Certainly not.\" \" Very well. I thought you might like to ascertain from Mr. Reed (who had not left Sunderland when the \" Polly \" weighed anchor) whether the lady who sailed in her as the captain's wife had been Mary Hesketh or was \u2014 not his wife at all.\" Mr. Raeburn started \u2014 not so much at the shadow of hope"], [339, "DR.

He had never deluded himself with hope after the maple desk gave up its contents \u2014 never for one moment. \" You mean well, doctor, no doubt, and I thank you most sincerely for the deep interest you have evinced in me and those dear to me ; but why you should surrender your valu able time to a bootless journey, or desire me, by ill-timed questions, to remind Miss Reed of her lover's shameful desertion, I cannot understand. Had I any doubt on the subject, the earnestness of your manner might impress me; but unfortunately I have not.\" \" You take those confounded letters as indubitable evidence ?\" \" Yes.

He is as rough, as hard and impenetrable as a cocoanut, yet no doubt one might find a drop of very genial milk in his heart, if one only succeeded in cracking the shell. What can he mean?

In less than an hour Mr. Raeburn had made his hasty preparations, and, with a small valise strapped before him, was galloping along the high road which passes East and West Rainton and Houghton-le-Spring, on to Bishop Wear mouth and Sunderland. The snow, just crisping to the frost, was dashed from his horse's hoofs in showers of powdery crystals, as on he rode"], [342, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 330 through the deepening twilight and the deeper silence, with a speed communicated to the intelligent steed by the yet unuttered thoughts of his rider. Quiescent under an evil certainty, the echoes of a vague, undigested doubt had sent him, too impatient to remain inactive in a railway carriage, flying across the country roads with the wild haste of one pursued or pursuing unto death, sent him to pace the long line of Sunderland South Pier from end to end, to peer through telescopes and question grimy colliers or tarry \"salts,\" and chafe at a delay which kept him day after day in torment and suspense. At the Tower he was only known to have gone from home for a few days, more or less, and this being nothing unusual of late, no remark was made by any one save Mr. Marsh, who observed that Frank had left his book and taken leave without turning over a fresh leaf\u2014 a sign that the good gentleman was regaining not only health but cheer fulness. To Rhoda, Frank Raeburn's absence was a relief. The icy politeness which never thawed or varied oppressed her more than all the evil she had wrought. Hitherto her arts had failed to draw him to herself. Virtually she was mistress of the household. Nominally she was Miss Wearbank, with the hope of being otherwise narrowing daily. How to accomplish her aims had begun to perplex her. She had heard whispers of his probable return to Antigua in the ensuing year, and the consequent entrance of another tenant on the premises. If she could only secure him for herself, only prevail on him to sue for a divorce, she would gladly turn with him to another shore, safe from haunting shadows. She had determined Eva's death, and only hesitated between violence and starvation. It had become essential to her own safety that all trace of her imprisonment should be removed. She would destroy the mattress, and contrive it so that Eva's fate might be regarded side by side with"], [343, "DR. GROVE DECLARES HIS DOUBTS. 331 that ofGinevra in Modena's oaken chest\u2014 a fatal result of playfulness or curiosity \u2014 no more. His absence was an opportunity. Not that his presence quelled her hate, or her ambition ; but she could not look on the chill, stern brow and fiery eye, which covered a wound of her infliction, without faltering in her fell purpose, without betraying the hideous secret in her breast. Let her once be rid of the incubus of danger present, and she would wreathe her face with smiles afresh , and tune her siren voice to lure him from his melancholy. He was best away. Of Mr. Marsh she took no heed. He was a man without suspicion, and with a full belief in her. Regarding his child as dead, he had resigned himself with Christian patience to the sad dispensation; and, look ing forward to a re-union in another world, had gradually dropped any open reference to his loss, observing how painful to his sensitive son-in-law any allusion to Eva was. The snow had been coming down all the morning, when at mid-day Dr. Grove, buttoned up to the chin in his macintosh, with his legs encased in corresponding waterproof cloth, shook the white flakes from his broad collar on the threshold of the only house in Durham where there was no recognition of the season. \" How now, Martin, have you forgotten that we are on the eve of Christmas ? that you have not hung out a single red berry to welcome him ? \" \"Na, doctor aw've nut furgitten; but Miss Rhoda divn't think Maister Raeburn might like merry-makin', an' so we hevn't e'en a gowpen ov holly.

Even that shroud of nature will soil and fade in a few days; and people have been known to dance over three-months' graves.\" And the doctor pointed to the outside snow as he spoke. \" Gracious, doctor! what do you mean? We have no graves to dance over. I protest you quite shocked me ! \" So the doctor thought as he glanced askance at her white face, and felt his quick thrust had gone home. \" Mr. Marsh mourns over a grave, and Mr. Raeburn over buried hopes. I do not think my simile so very far-fetched. But has Raeburn returned ? \" No. \" Ask him to dine with me to-morrow, if he is back, and to bring Marsh. I have already* asked Hesketh.\" What would Rhoda have felt had she known that under that black macintosh lay a letter from the Rev. J. Reed, attesting Mary Reed's marriage with Cuthbert, and her depar ture on board his vessel ? CHAPTER XLI. LIVING OR DEAD ? As week after week went by; as pine and fir put on their thick winter garments of gloomy green, and bristled up to keep off the cold; as sharp gusts shook the few lingering leaves from deciduous trees, as the cold white snow fell silently, like a shower of unbleached down, against the grey sky and the far hill-top, or drifted and whirled in eddies on the flat roof beneath her prison window; as each change told the changing season, Eva's heart chilled with more"], [345, "LIVING OR DEAD? 333 than frost, and her hopes fell with the falling leaves and snow. Long she clung to the belief that Frank or her father would discover her, whatever arts were used to blind them, or conceal her secret prison ; but as days and weeks lapsed into months, despair took the place of patient anticipation. Had they not abandoned the search, she must have been found ; it was impossible she should remain under her hus band's roof, with Rhoda coming nightly, laden with food, and no suspicion be aroused, unless the watchfulness of love had been lulled to sleep. With this thought came a shower of heart-wrung tears, followed by weeks of desponding melancholy. The sight of the shepherd boy on the hill, who gazed intently on her pale face ere he fled affrighted, raised her hopes for a while, only to sink to lower depths. But for the few books Rhoda had in some remorseful moment supplied, her reason must have sunk in melancholy imbecility. She was not a strong-minded, strong-bodied woman remember, inured to suffering and hardship by rude contact with the world ; but a tender little pet lamb, delicately nurtured, frisking blithely amid flowery pastures, when roughly dragged from loving tendance to a solitary, hopeless prison, and the burden of a great shame. She might have died in weary inanition, but for a new incentive to live and escape \u2014 the prospect of maternity. In vain she searched the adjoining loft for knife, scissors, or anything sharp or pointed by which she could rip the mattress. At length after a long and painful quest \u2014 for the loft was in deep shadow, even at noon-day\u2014 she found a large rusty nail, and strove to wear it smooth and sharp against the rouo-hly plastered wall. But, although she huddled in Rhoda's thick shawl, her fingers were benumbed with cold, and she made anything but brisk work. Having sharpened her nail, which was more than one day's"], [346, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 334 work, she sat down to rip the stitches of the mattress ; a tedious task, in that imperfect light and cramped position with her rude implement. After several days she contrived to lay bare the edge of the trap, but to her consternation no effort of hers could reach the bolt beneath. That night, while she lay in the torpid sleep Rhoda knew so well how to produce, a mocking, taunting letter was placed beside her food; it ran! \u2014 \" So, Eva, you think to escape me, and have planned a nice little bit of Jack Sheppardism. What a pity you could not carry your scheme on with that prison-breaker's secrecy and success ! But I warn you escape is impossible. Unless you can reach a bolt through double deal boards and afterwards force or pick a strong lock you may give up the attempt. Clever, very, and simple, very. \" Nor think to alarm the family by any outcry ; none but myself ascend higher than the guest-chambers, on any pre tence, and only a deaf charwoman mounts so high. Scream, if you will, with your lips to the chink of the trap, and see if there be any response. Scare foolish boys with the sight of a ghost face, if you will, the rumour only binds you firmer. But, Eva, if you do, I will strangle you in your sleep, to save all further care for you. \"On the first sign of discovery, or suspicion of your where abouts, I shall kill you \u2014 kill you as I would any loathsome thing that crossed my path or threatened my repose. I weary of the nightly victualling; should the supply cease, you will know its import. \" Rhoda.\" Aghast at this further testimony of Rhoda's black ingratitude and murderous heart, she cowered beneath the window, not to yield submissively, but to meditate possibilities. Eva was young, and life to the young is sweet under all circumstances. She saw that her death was determined on,"], [347, "LIVING OR DEAD ? 335 that she should be either strangled or suffered to perish from famine if she remained passive, and as everything was to be gained and nothing lost, she resolved to persevere. Once or twice she looked out of the window, but every fibre shrank at the desperate prospect that mode of escape pre sented. So she set to work resolutely to chip away the wood of the trap as near to the bolt as she could calculate. She reckoned on reaching the bolt in process of time, and working it slowly back ; and once at the lower door she determined she would shake and batter it until concealment was no longer possible. The poor creature had overrated her capabilities. A common nail in feeble hands is a poor substitute for chisel and mallet in strong ones. Scratches, not chips, were the result, and when she had wasted her strength and the daylight, she threw down the inefficient tool and wept in hopeless disap pointment. Still, at daybreak, she resumed her wearisome task, exposed to the palpable derision of an old grey mouse, which, tame from long companionship, squatted on its haunches and watched the progress of the work, occasionally turning its lively head, and peering in her face with its bright eyes. \"Ah, my curious little friend,\" said Eva, mournfully, \" if I had but your sharp teeth, I might soon eat my way to freedom; but I suppose you want your breakfast, and so do I, mousey.\" There was no breakfast for mistress or mouse. The pitcher was empty, the plate as it had been left the night before. Was this the token of which she had been forewarned? Before nightfall she was glad to eat the remains of yester day's scraps; she had all along been sparely fed, and then was too hungry to be dainty. How should she quench her thirst? Day passed, and night came on, starry and bright, with a full round moon like a disc of gleaming opal, and as it rose above the hill and shimmered on the snow, its rays lit up her empty pitcher."], [348, "336 STUNG TO THE QUICK. With sudden inspiration she grasped the handle and dashed the vessel against the window until every particle of glass had fallen. The snow, on which, in her thirst, she had cal culated, had, however, been shaken from the narrow ledge, but with her brown battering-ram she contrived to beat down the leaden trellis stretching across the frame. Whatever noise she made was unheard, for there was no one to listen. It was Christmas Eve, and Beck, Martin, and Nancy were holiday-making in the city; even Towzer had followed his master. The snow had ceased an hour or more, a light wind stirred the branches, and, laden with a faint odour from the pines, came with a vivifying influence to the poor creature, to whom the free air of heaven was a new joy. In the first days of her incarceration she had dragged a small box from the loft, to serve at once for table and seat. This she placed beneath the window, already brought near by the thick mattress, and covering the jagged frame with old packing canvas, contrived to seat herself on the ledge, and drop down on the thickly-coated roof beneath. This was no extraordinary feat, as the roof was flat, and not more than five feet from the window. Eva's first impulse was to quench her thirst with snow and gleaming icicles. Cold as they were they moistened her parched lips. And then she shuddered, not with the cold, but with dread to persevere in her wild enterprise. She neared the battlements, looked down the depth below, and shrank from the attempt. Once more she nerved herself. \" I can but perish ; and if I fall and kill myself, my dear misguided husband will know I have not been false to him. But why should I fall ? I am very light. I have seen boys much bigger than I am climb the ivy, bird-nesting At all events I can but try, and trust in the protection of my Hea venly Father.\""], [349, "LIVING OR DEAD? 337 With a short but fervent prayer, she girt her shawl close to her body, secured the canvas round one of the slippery stone battlements, stepped carefully backwards, with a beating heart, down through the embrasure, and, without loosing her hold of canvas and coping, planted a foot securely on a firm branch of the clustering ivy. Down, down, hand under hand, step by step, when once the aiding canvas was resigned; \u2014 slowly, cautiously, amid a shower of snow dislodged from leaf or umbel ; \u2014 slowly, twigs broke, brittle with late frosts ; \u2014 her fingers cramped with cold ; \u2014 down, step by step, almost slipping, pausing with bated breath ; \u2014 slower, surer, treading on a last year's nest ; \u2014 gain ing courage with each foothold; wishing her fingers would not freeze so fast ; down, safely down \u2014 midway down \u2014 close by her own chamber-window there was a sudden stoppage ; \u2014 a fluttering dress caught on a projecting stem, \u2014 an effort to disentangle the garment \u2014 a sound of riven muslin and loosening ivy, a shriek on the still night air \u2014 a senseless body crushing down the drifted snow.* Mr. Marsh was dozing on his sofa-bed. Rhoda, left to the companionship of her own thoughts, sat with her feet on the fender staring into the parlour-fire, calculating how long famine would be in finishing her work, and debating whether it might not be wiser to adopt the speedier means, thinking with Macbeth : \u2014 \"If 'twere done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well It were done quickly.\" Scarce a sound stirred without ; the falling water's monotone, the kitchen cricket's ceaseless chaunt, the hall clock's heavy beat, but made the silence more oppressive ; a dropping cin der scared her, falling red-hot upon a conscious nerve. There was no cat to purr upon the hearth ; puss had been sacrificed to Rhoda's safety. She sat alone, her teeming * See Appendix. X"], [350, "338 STUNG TO THE QUICK. brain full of her own brave projects, the firelight of the pre sent on her face, the shadows of the future closing in be hind her. Suddenly she was startled by a faint scream, and a heavy thud on the snow beneath the kitchen window. She started up, rushed out. There lay before her, white as snow, Eva \u2014 senseless \u2014 dead. She must be if she had fallen from the battlements above ; no human being could drop thence and live. No need to murder now. Rhoda's face and lips blanched with horror. There was no pity, no womanly compassion for the fair girl whose cradle she had shared ; no remorse for the sad fate of her innocent victim. Fear of detection, dread of exposure \u2014 of punishment \u2014 these struck terror through her brain and chilled her heart. But there was no inaction in her terror, no loitering to gaze and dream. Ever prompt to decide and act upon decision, she raised the frail form with scarcely a shudder, and drew it across the snow to the path which, skirting the out-buildings, led to the ravine. But the trail was broad; so she lifted the light form in her strong arms, and strode rather than walked to the low fence, with difficulty crossing the branching stream in front of the slight wooden barrier, burdened as she was. The fence itself was no more than two barkless branches laid across the stream from a tall hedge to the hill side, and resting on two upright posts far apart, as if to make way for the occasional floods so apt to change the character of the stream hereabouts from a swampy rill to a rushing torrent. The water, which there met and diverged much as do the symbolical legs on a Manx penny, kept a triangular space clear of intrusive trees, so that the moonlight flooded the spot if water did not, peering into every secret nook and crevice with its searching glance, and silvering the icicles pendent from bar or bough. By its clear light Rhoda passed her unresisting burden"], [351, "LIVING OR DEAD? 339 between the open bars, laid it down on the snow beside the frozen stream, and following quickly, resumed her load and her tramp of the ravine into the silent depths of the shadowy gorge. There she put it down, hurried to the stable, hastily snatched a spade, retraced her steps, and prepared to dig \u2014 a grave ! Did no thoughts come over her of that Christmas Eve when she, a puny babe, lay in the snow, and that pale victim's father took her thence to warmth, and light, and love? The moon looked down, and the stars shone overhead, and saw that she remembered nothing but herself. The frosty earth defied the spade. She would leave the body where it was; no one went there even in the summer \u2014 it would scarcely be found now ; the wind would soon drift the snow over it, and when the thaw softened the ground she would come by night and bury it. Turning back she observed her footprints in the snow, and again trembled for her safety; then, swift to think, smote the rude embankment of the stream and let out the imprisoned water over the path. Down it swept, washing away footprints and snow together. Regardless, in her ex citement, that she had lost a slipper in the ravine, she waded down the current to avoid fresh tracks, and felt that she was safe. But no ; the water drifted down the drive quite away from the impress of Eva's form and her footsteps. What could she do ? Replacing the spade, with a pail she dashed the water up towards the Tower where Eva had lain beneath the windows. The marks were gone! She breathed afresh, and hurried indoors to change her dripping dress ere the servants should come home. Five minutes later and they would have found her at her midnight task. The water streaming down the drive puzzled Martin, and set his wits to work."], [352, "340 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \" What the deekins hez flooded a' this road te-neet ? \" cried Martin, as Rhoda unclosed the door to admit them. \"Dear me \u2014 how singular. I suppose the frost must have burst the embankment: such is frequently the case in Holland.\" \" Mebby yo're reet, miss. Aw'll jest gan luik at t' beestes, sin aw reckon Beck's none cum hyem yit.

The same to you, and to Nancy likewise.\" Merry Christmas indeed! with that white face looking up to the sky from the depths of the gorge! She went to her own room \u2014 to think. \"Aw dinnet like the luiks o' this; theere's bin na frost te breek doun yon bonk, aw knaw,\" cogitated Martin, as he peered round anxiously. \" Well, aw niver saw th' wayter run oop-hill afore \u2014 theer's somethin' wrang here.

Here, Towzer, lad, thoo an me '11 sand this oot.\" It was clear moonlight, so he needed no lantern; but, from force of habit, he went for one, and found \u2014 a wet pail, and a snow-crusted spade! \"Theer's some devilry here, aw'll swear,\" he soliloquized, \"an' that witch is at the bottom of it.\" He hurriedly strode up the flooded path to the broken embankment and shrewdly observed that the stones had fallen inwards as from a thrust. He glanced upwards. There was a scrap of muslin fluttering on the fence \u2014 that, alone, was nothing; but Towzer ran under the rail and brought forth \u2014 Rhoda's embroidered slipper. \" What on earth can a' this mean ? \" muttered the old man. \" Aw tremble at maw vary thowts \u2014 theer is that afoot maks maw vary flesh creep. This is an eerie spot ! \""], [353, "LIVING OR DEAD? 341 He crossed the fence\u2014 stood in amazement; footprints, visible enough, led upward, and he tracked them. On, on, painfully, for the ground was rugged and slippery, but on to the deep narrow gorge where even the moonbeams scarcely could penetrate. An undefined sense of dread stole over him as Towzer bounded forward to a heap of something blocking up the path. What if it should be\u2014 a few paces more, and he found the faithful brute licking the cold face of his gentle young mistress. How the old man (hale and strong as he was for his years) carried that insensate form to his room he never knew ; but he laid her gently on his own bed, sought Nance (osten sibly for the \" something warm \"), and, with finger on lip, beckoned her out at the back of the house. \"For the love of Heaven, Nance, be silent; we hev mich te de. Theer hez bin murder dun, aw fear,\" whispered he, placing his hand on the woman's mouth, lest she should scream as he told his tale, and hurried her across the so called yard to his room over the stable. It was a needless precaution; for Mr. Marsh was fast asleep, and Rhoda in her own chamber out of sight and hearing, even if Nancy had possessed less discretion and presence of mind than happened to fall to her share, and had screamed her very loudest. She shivered, and her teeth chattered with terror, as she mounted the outer wooden steps to the door. But she did not scream, and soon was on her knees by her well-loved young lady, striving to bring back vitality. There was no sign of life in the cold frame, but Nance maintained that life was there. She poured the warm cordial slowly down the limp throat, and bade Martin kindle a fire, while she chafed the frozen limbs \u2014 half hopelessly. At length the pulse fluttered slightly \u2014 life was not extinct. Soon strange throes began to. stir the senseless form. \" Martin,\" cried Nance, \" saddle a horse, and ride for your life for Dr. Grove. Take the bridle path through the back"], [354, "342 STUNG TO THE QUICK. woods and the short cut over the hill, and that wretch will not see you. She thinks us all abed.\" Martin's zeal required no stimulant. \" Hout, stop te saddle a horse indeed, wi' our puir baim mebby deein' th' while \u2014 nut likely !\" was his indignant muttering, as he loosened the halter from the wall, and mounting a bare-backed steed, was off and away with the haste of a younger man. The old matron relaxed no effort tending to restore animation. In time the thin lids unclosed, but only for an instant ; then she gave a wild gasp \u2014 the pangs of maternity returned : and well for Eva that they did. Before Martin returned in silence and secrecy with Dr. Grove, a babe was born \u2014 a little, im mature, emaciated creature, who died with its first breath. The birth of that babe saved the mother's life. The great effort of nature restored suspended pulsation, roused the feeble frame to vitality ; but the spark of life only glimmered \u2014 an instant, and it might be extinguished for ever. The poor victim of jealousy and hate was in good hands \u2014 loving, tender, experienced, and skilful hands; and although her chamber was lowly, and its accommodation rude, it was not bare. Martin was a favoured domestic, and had been made comfortable at Miss Wearbank's especial request, in which, however, there had, of course, been no provision for comfort as now required. Beck, having returned home, and having been partly sobered by a roughly administered cold water cure, and wholly by the shock of Martin's news, was despatched, in silence and secrecy always, over the back hill, along with Martin, for loads of linen and needful stores from the shut-up house in South Street, of which Nancy kept the key, with a view to the airing of the rooms. Not that the Tower did not contain all that was requisite, but Dr. Grove, ever cautious \u2014 over cautious, it may be \u2014 enjoined secrecy until Mr. Rae burn's return ; the removal of such articles from under Rhoda's ken might attract her notice, and excite her suspicions. \"I must leave you now, Nancy,\" said Dr. Grove, at the"], [355, "FOILED. 343 foot of the steps, about seven o'clock; \"so that I may send a nurse to release you, before Miss Wearbank comes down stairs. Should she complain that you are late, you can plead fatigue after yesterday's holiday -making ; but pray be careful that she suspect nothing, since I can take no active steps without Mr. Raeburn's authority.\" \"Never fear, doctor; I have not lived so long that I need to learn caution with our poor dear bairn's life at such a critical pass. Leave an old servant alone for making excuses with e'er a doctor in Durham.\" \" You will remember my instructions for the treatment of our patient, and on no account permit her to speak or be spoken to. Should Mr. Raeburn come before I can com municate with him, he must be told nothing, but sent to me. Should she see him, her life would not be worth five min utes' purchase! Mr. Marsh must also remain in ignorance.\" Nancy returned to her post, and the doctor rode back by the bridle path over the hill into the North-road, as being at once nearer to his own house, and beyond the range of the Cyclop's eye. Rhoda, thanks to her distant chamber, heard nothing, saw nothing, of what was passing below; but a pale face upturned to the moon reproached her with ingratitude and threatened to haunt her dreams through time and through eternity. CHAPTER XLII. FOILED. About noon, Nancy was visited by Mrs. Prosser, a cousin she had not seen for many years till she \" met her in Durham the day before, and, begging Miss Rhoda's pardon for the liberty, had asked her to spend the Christmas with her at the Grey Tower; it was so lonesome like.\""], [356, "344 STUNG TO THE QUICK. Rhoda smilingly acquiesced in Nancy's invitation, spoke a few pleasant words to the country cousin, and Mrs. Prosser (an experienced nurse, who had in fact been in attendance from eight o'clock) was free to come and go unquestioned. The doctor himself had dropped in at eleven o'clock, osten sibly to apologise for inviting Mr. Marsh so casually to his Christmas dinner, and to ask if he might expect Mr. Raeburn. \" You see, Marsh, when a fellow is on one's hand so long as a patient, one is apt to forget he is sufficiently convalescent to be one's guest\u2014 under supervision. But the day is clear and frosty; you will take no harm if well wrapped up; and Miss Wearbank here will attend to that, whilst I go and look after the vehicle and driver.\" \"Well, but, doctor, what of coming back in the evening?\" \"We'll not send you back\u2014 find a bed somewhere in the house, even if Ned turns out.\" \" Then Ned has turned up, or he could not turn out, \" chuckled Mr. Marsh, with something of his old manner. \" Ah, turned up this morning. Miss Wearbank, will you by-the-by you do not look very brisk to-day. Did you not sleep well last night? Let me feel your pulse.\" The arm was extended languidly. \" Humph, rapid\u2014 and now your tongue feverish, feverish. I'd advise you to go to bed, and have a basin of gruel for;w^- Christmas dinner. I'll send a febrifuge from Robson's as we pass. If young ladies will wear thin shoes in mid-winter, they must expect colds and physic. I'll look up in the morning to see how you go on.\" Rhoda was really unwell, and glad of the pretext to keep within her own apartment. Exposure to the keen night air unbonneted, unwonted exertion, draggled skirts and soaked stockings, combined with excitement to produce a state of feverish cold just sufficient to justify the doctor in sending her to bed out of the way. As his patient he would have her safe until she might be wanted. Wary Dr. Grove! The water Rhoda had let out upon the drive rapidly glazed to a perilous sheet of ice, and this two of the under-gardeners"], [357, "FOILED. 345 had just broken up, when Mr. Raeburn was seen tearing along, his horse all in a foam, at noon the following day. Beck, loitering as was his wont by the coach-house door, sprang forward to catch the reins hastily flung down, and to walk the over-heated horse about to cool gradually. Had the animal belonged to the man instead of the master, Beck could scarcely have displayed more anxiety for the beast, or vented stronger expletives on the rider who had used him so unmercifully. Frank Raeburn heard neither the mutterings of Beck nor the speculations of Martin as to what \"hez put th' maister oot.\" He had darted into the house, and, guided by the music, rushed upwards into the drawing-room, where Rhoda, well wrapped up on account of her cold, sat at Eva's piano, rehearsing the overture to a new opera. Without a word of premonition, as he burst into the room, he shouted, rather than said \u2014 \" Woman, where is my wife \u2014 my spotless wife ? \" Thus confronted, Rhoda, drawing herself to her full height, replied, loftily \u2014 \" What should I know of your wife, spotted or spotless ? \" Frank's lips were livid, his face distorted with fury, his eyes seemed to flash with the fierceness of his ire. He grasped her wrist and held her fast. * What should you know? \u2014 everything. And I demand once more, where is she ? \" \" And once more, I reply, I know not. Seek her on the broad sea with her paramour ! \" \" Rhoda Wearbank, you are a fiend and not a woman, to brave my resentment and sport with my feelings in such a moment. I have seen Captain Hesketh and Mary his wife, have heard the story of your intrigue to beguile him, and of the letter you had the temerity to write, which he received on deck in the presence of his wife. The letter lost its sting, Miss Wearbank,\" hissed Frank, between his teeth, \" and has identified you with the horrid calamity here. I ask you again, what have"], [358, "346 STUNG TO THE QUICK. you done with my wife \u2014 my Eva ? Mary Hesketh, his wife, was the companion of his voyage.\" Rhoda was equal to any emergency. The announcement of Cuthbert's return struck the death-blow to her hopes and projects, and she shrank at the first intimation; still her pre sence of mind never left her, convinced, as she was, her main secret was safe. \" Mr. Raeburn your grasp on my wrist is anything but pleasant and your speech is equally offensive. When you comport yourself as a gentleman, I will answer you as a lady. \" This was a mere ruse to gain time, a calculation on Frank Raeburn's weak point, but it utterly failed; the man had thrown conventionalities down, had been excited beyond them. The appeal to his gentlemanlike bearing was, therefore, lost, save that he relaxed his hold of her arm. \" Answer as a woman, madam, if you have a spark of womanhood within you. I can dispense with the lady. I trace my wise's disappearance to your agency \u2014 else why came those letters, written by Captain Hesketh to you, in my wife's desk ? \u2014 and I seek her at your hands. \" \" My letters in your wife's desk ! Mr. Raeburn, there is a mystery here I cannot fathom. Pray, sir, did the honourable, lady-killing captain show you the letter he professed to have received from me?\" \" Unfortunately he distroyed it on the spur of the moment. \" Rhoda was more at ease. She was playing a desperate game, and she played boldly. Cool and contemptuous was her rejoinder as her shoulders rose with an incredulous shrug. \" Unfortunate, indeed, when verity and identity have to be established. \" \" This is mere trifling. And, by Heaven, Miss Wearbank, you had better trifle with an uncaged lion than with me ! I saw several letters from you, fair copies of the rough drafts in the desk. \""], [359, "FOILED. 347 \" Letters in my handwriting ! \" How well her bewilderment was feigned ! \" No, certainly not in your hand, but a close imitation of Eva's \u2014 close enough to deceive even me. \" \"Have you any objection to show me those letters, Mr. Raeburn ? This is the first I have heard of them, and I must admit you perplex me exceedingly. \" \" The first you have heard of them ? \" exclaimed Frank, in blank astonishment at her cool effrontery, which bore so innocent an aspect. \" The very first. You may remember, I was not present when the desk was opened \u2014 was not considered worthy a confidence which concerned a cousin only. Dr. Grove merely informed me that you had discovered Eva's elopement with Captain Hesketh, and he desired that her name might never again be breathed in your hearing. Yourself, with not too much courtesy, abruptly checked my approach to the subject. \" Frank dropped the arm he held, and stood for some seconds in deep thought. This rebuke was at least just. \" Why Captain Hesketh should seek to palm upon me a correspondence with Mrs. Raeburn, or anyone else, to screen himself from your indignation, is one of those acts of dupli city inscrutable to an upright mind ; and wherefore you, on his bare assertion, burst into my presence, and expect me to know Mrs. Raeburn's movements, is as unaccountable. Apropos, has not the veracious captain made a marvellously short voyage ? I understood he would be absent at least a couple of years. Did he account for his quick return?\" Yes. Satisfactorily? To me \u2014 yes.

Mr. Raeburn, I am willing to overlook your unjust suspicions of myself, and attribute them to misdi rection and overwrought feeling, which I can readily excuse, \" and Rhoda sighed ; \" and now you have taken me into your confidence, I would suggest that you lay the whole case before Dr. Grove. If anyone can disentangle a knotty skein, it is he. What little acumen I possess is at your service, if you care for a woman's opinion at all. Indeed, now that my name is dragged into the matter, it becomes incumbent on me to search the accusation to the bottom, if only to exculpate myself. The doctor has been here this morning on a professional visit to me, having yesterday prescribed bed, physic, and gruel as my Christmas fare. Weary of all three, I came down stairs two hours ago to meet him. \" \"And I have kept an invalid standing all this time.\" Frank had lost all recollection of the overture. Rhoda smiled benignantly. \" It is of no consequence; you were too much excited to be observant of a lady's fatigue. But I must plead exhaustion now ; and if you will oblige me by seeking the doctor imme diately, I shall be glad to confer with you both, after dinner, to unravel this mystery, if possible. \" With a well-assumed air of languor, Rhoda retired to her own room, \u2014 a whirlwind of passion sweeping through heart and brain. Cuthbert's return had frustrated her plans; his marriage had rendered half her scheme abortive. She had hoped to break his heart : it had never been hers to break ! And now he and Frank Raeburn had met. Well, what if they had, the letters proved no connection with her \u2014 her word was as good as his. Oh, that the frost would go ! Let her but hide it out of sight, and she would defy them to bring the letters home to her. She would steal out and pass behind the premises, through the woods, and over the hill, to the ravine, to convince herself that all was safe\u2014 perhaps remove it into deeper shadow. Ah, Rhoda ! kinder hands than yours have done that ; but"], [361, "FOILED. 349 the shadow is not that of sombre firs over a narrow gorge, but the closed curtains of bed and window drawn by watchful precaution. Dumbfounded by audacity for which he was so ill-prepared, staggered by the boldness which threw the onus of falsifica tion on his informant, Mr. Raeburn had suffered Rhoda to slip from his grasp. She had made him feel he had brought a charge he could not substantiate without stronger evidence, and from the high ground of accusation he had veered to that of argumentation, almost of apology. The adroit reference to Dr. Grove had told wonderfully in her favour. He argued that a woman, willing to bring so keen an examiner to test the conflicting statements, could not be the vile creature Captain Hesketh's story implied. Yet was he unconvinced, though silenced for the time, and over powered with an anxious yearning desire to know the truth \u2014 the truth, which would prove his wife a victim or a culprit. A hurried inquiry elicited from Nancy that Mr. Marsh was at Dr. Grove's, had gone to dinner the previous day, and had not returned. \" I reckon you'll be for going down to the doctor's to see the maister. The doctor was uncommon partic'lar in his inqui ries for you, Mr. Raeburn,\" edged in the old woman, with a most peculiar expression on her faithful face. \"Who is that person ?\" asked Mr. Raeburn, observing from the hall a strange woman in a linen apron and cap walk across the kitchen. \" Oh, that is Mrs. Prosser, sir ; a cousin of mine. Miss Rhoda gave me leave to ask her here to stay Christmas over. I had not seen her for a long time, sir.\" \" Very well \u2014 quite right ; I hope you will make her com fortable.\" He was by this time out of doors, and with that strange attention to trifles we all may have felt in periods of great mental excitement, being always fastidiously neat, he called out with some asperity, \u2014"], [362, "350 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \" Martin, how comes that ivy dragged from the wall so rudely, and what is that great rag fluttering on it?\" Martin glanced upward, a strange look passed over his fea tures, \" Oh, Mr, Raeburn ! \" he gasped, \u2014 ran for a ladder, mounted, and gave the rag to Frank. It was a portion of the dress worn by Eva the day he left home \u2014 a white muslin dotted with groups of pink rose buds. He could not mistake it. \" Good God! Martin, this is a portion of your mistress's dress! I shall go mad if one mystery follows another thus! How came it there?\" \"Ask Dr. Grove, dear maister, ask Dr. Grove; mebby he can tell; he kens mair than maist folk!\" \"Ask Dr. Grove!\" repeated Mr. Raeburn, in bewilderment. \" Every one refers me to Dr. Grove. What can he know respecting this dress or the wearer?\" \" Mair than anny of us ken ; he hez guid news fer ye, maister, guid news. Ye connot hev getten his letter; he said he'd write te ye.\" Nothing more was to be got out of the old man; but in the stable was a fresh horse, ready saddled, which the thoughtful servant had provided, and in little more time than is spent in the narration, Frank Raeburn was speeding to wards Framwellgate, feverish with haste and a new anxiety. Quietly, very quietly, the doctor received him, and met his impetuous questions with imperturbable gravity. To Frank's impatient \" Doctor, I hear you have news for me \u2014 intelligence of my wife : for God's sake tell me what it is without delay, for I feel like one distraught.\" \"And look so, too,\" was the doctor's cool rejoinder, as his fingers sought the other's pulse. \" I can tell nothing whilst you are in this state of excitement.\" \" You must, Dr. Grove. I have already been tortured be yond human endurance. You know where my wife is \u2014 where she has been \u2014 with whom \" \"In part only. She has not been with Cuthbert, and is with friends,\" interrupted he."], [363, "FOILED. 351 \" Thank God for that !\" The relieved husband sank into a seat, and tears \u2014 a man's tears \u2014 found their way between his fingers as he bowed his head in grateful acknowledgment of the Divine mercy. \"She is very ill, Mr. Raeburn\u2014 in a state of extreme danger \u2014 in a most perilous condition, in fact ; still it is not impos sible that with great care she may be brought round in time.

Is she here?\" The doctor shook his head. \" I must say ' No ' to both your questions. She is not here, and to admit you to her bedside would be to peril her chance of life. You must have patience. You endured her loss and its attendant shame like a hero; do not be less now.\" \" Tell me, Dr. Grove, where she was found, and how ? There is a mystery here which Martin implied was only to be solved by you. This was found fluttering on a loosened branch of ivy near my chamber window. It is a portion of my wife's dress. How came it there? What tore the ivy from the wall ? \" The doctor had been unlocking a drawer in his study table while Frank spoke ; quietly he produced Rhoda's slipper and the other bit of muslin. \" Do you recognise these ? \" \"Of course. The slipper is Miss Wearbank's; the muslin matches this.\" \" These were found near the fence which closes the ravine, and Mrs. Raeburn was discovered by Martin and Towzer after midnight, lying in a state of insensibility on the snow in the depths of the gorge,\" said Dr. Grove, very signifi cantly. Frank Raeburn started up as if appalled, exclaiming, \" My God ! that wretch of a woman has been at the bottom of our misery after all ! \" As one by one the revelations of Dr. Grove were dove tailed with those of Cuthbert, and Rhoda's own barefaced"], [364, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 352 denial, the impression assumed certainty that Rhoda had removed and detained Eva against her will, and had left her for dead where she was found. Dr. Grove's horse was at the door when Mr. Raeburn arrived. After a few kind but hasty words to Mr. Marsh, who had been thoughtfully kept in ignorance until his daugh ter's recovery was less doubtful, the two remounted and rode with all expedition to the Tower. A glance from the loose ivy upward showed the canvas yet upon the battlements, and suggested what made Frank white and dizzy but to contemplate. The two men darted into the house, bent on securing Rhoda and handing her over to justice, both fully purposed to prosecute her to the utmost; Mr. Raeburn, with a stern, unrelenting determination in his face, which told the story of his wrongs and his inflexible resolution to be avenged.

The turret staircase door was locked. \"She will be hiding here; we must force the lock!\" cried Frank, trying the door as he spoke. \"Perhaps this may save you the trouble,\" interposed the doctor, handing him a clean, well-oiled key he had found on the floor of Rhoda's room. \"She cannot be hiding here, Mr. Raeburn,\" continued he, as they mounted the stairs ; \" she could not have drawn that bolt behind her, but,\" and his voice sank, \"I believe we are on the track of Eva's secret.\" \" You are right, doctor ! \" exclaimed the other, eagerly, as he lifted the trap and scared away two busy little mice. \"You are right; this room has been occupied.\" \" Ah ! and carefully prepared for occupation too \u2014 see ! \" Another strip of the rosebud muslin caught in the torn jags of the leaden lattice. \" And there, too, are my poor darling's little footprints in Frightened.

Had I known there was such a nook in the building I might have been sharper.\" \" I, too, mistrusted Rhoda Wearbank; but not of the hideous perfidy, the cold-blooded calculation she has betrayed.\" \"Humph! you were too jealous to think in any but one direction, I am of opinion.

Beck will be fleeter of foot than I,\" replied the elder man, turning away as he spoke. There were faint footsteps surely enough, just distinguishable in the waning light ; footsteps to and from the hill ; footsteps through the shrubbery to the shed in the dingle. On the floor of the hut lay Rhoda's dress of olive cash mere (green had been her favourite wear, varying in tint with the season and the foliage), a warm angola shawl, her petticoats, and fur-lined boots. \"The snake has cast its skin,\" cried Mr. Raeburn; \"no matter, since I know the marks of the new one. Beck, hasten over the hill, and if you overtake or meet a sailor, stop him. Martin, saddle a horse, and ride to Leamside; charge the porters to let no sailor pass unquestioned.

Bend all your energies to the task, employ money and men, post placards, scour the country. Rhoda is within reach, and yet beyond it! A messenger had been previously despatched to Saddler Street for the surveyor to meet Dr. Grove and Mr. Raeburn at the Tower on important business; and he, unprepared for the discoveries there, bustled up as fast as his fat legs would carry him; more eager to display a letter of Cuth bert's and clear his fame than to transact business, however important."], [368, "356 STUNG TO THE QUICK. He reached the entrance just as Dr. Grove crossed the open space from Martin's room, where lay, in a state of semi-unconsciousness, his still surviving patient. In his hand were two papers, one worn and tattered. The nurse had found them on cutting away Eva's garments ; an indispensable precaution, where a movement too much might have caused instant death. They were Rhoda's cruelly exulting letters ! Mr. Hesketh's exuberant delight at Eva's escape, his son's marriage, and Rhoda's defeat, was only equalled by the disap pointment of Mr. Raeburn when he joined them after his unsuccessful quest, and his anxiety to be admitted to a sight of his wife, even in her sleep. After some hesitation and precaution the latter was con ceded. With unshod feet and bated breath, the husband stood by the lowly bed where lay the wan and emaciated form of the girl he had vowed to cherish, when the year itself was full of promise. How much of remorse for the wrong he had done in suspecting his virtuous wife mingled with his gratitude for her restoration and fears for her very existence. How bitter grew his animosity against the cruel woman who had wrought so much misery, the end of which was yet dread and undefined. Mrs. Prosser had to whisper a hint of papers found on the poor dear lady before she could induce him to remove, and the emotion visible in his countenance rendered his absence desirable, lest it should break forth audibly and disturb her patient. Dr. Grove undertook the difficult task of breaking the news to Mr. Marsh, whom he had carried off to his own house only as a precaution against contingencies. It was a delicate duty. He had regarded his daughter as dead \u2014 as having met a violent death, and was scarcely in that stage of recovery to bear any very strong emotion, whether of joy or j sorrow. Besides, here were complications \u2014 the recovery of his"], [369, "DR. GROVE AND THE GOSSIPS. 357 daughter would be balanced by the ingratitude and treachery of his foster-child. Dr. Grove had certainly an onerous duty before him, yet he accomplished it skilfully and success fully. He led his invalid friend to speak of his lost child ; then, as if ruminating, remarked, as a singularity, that neither Mr. Raeburn nor Miss Wearbank had worn mourning. In short, set Mr. Marsh thinking for himself, and led from point to point until the story of Eva's imprisonment and escape were laid before him in outline. The place of her detention and Rhoda's agency were reserved for another day. It was not until his removal home that he became acquainted with the full amount of Rhoda's studied malignity: then his grief and anger were extreme ; nothing, however, to Frank Raeburn's fiery indignation, which seemed to rise in propor tion as the chances of her detection grew fewer and fainter. The penny-post was on the eve of birth, the telegraph in its infancy, and photography had not then lent its aid to the police force, so Frank had no alternative but to communicate with the Bow Street authorities, wait the arrival of a London detective, and trust to the ordinary \" Hue and Cry. \" His own impatience, however, caused him to gallop hither and thither, wherever rumour pointed, but always with one result \u2014 dis appointment ! CHAPTER XLIV. DR. GROVE AND THE GOSSIPS. Surely Durham never had a theme for gossip until now. Mrs. Raeburn's \" scandalous elopement \" was nothing to it. All the judgments, theories, and opinions formed on that occasion had to be reversed, and the Welsh pot-herb eaten ad nauseam."], [370, "358 STUNG TO THE QUICK. The \"Chronicle\" and \"Advertiser\" had each a \"leaded\" paragraph on the \" Mysterious Discovery, \" the \" Extraordinary Occurrence;\" whilst in the advertising columns \"Two Hundred Pounds Reward\" was offered for the apprehension of Rhoda Wearbank, \" supposed to be disguised as a sailor. \" Mr. Hesketh, who had been held of little account at home since his son's alleged misconduct, was so proud of an oppor tunity to vindicate his character, that he instituted himself chief trumpeter at once, though, to his credit be it spoken, he was as chary of Rhoda's name as he well could be. When pressed, he declared neither he nor anyone else knew all the rights and wrongs of the case, and until Mrs. Raeburn was able to tell them, no one would be wiser unless the run away was taken. \"Dear, dear me! Poor thing! Do you think I could be of any use to the bairn if I were to go up ? \" was Aunt Dolly's first exclamation, on hearing her brother's account; \"you know nurses require sleep and rest as well as other people, and if you thought, hinny, I should not be intruding, I would put on my things and be off at once. \" A resolve she put in practice forth with, undeterred by the sneers of her sister-in-law, who advised her not to thrust herself where she was not wanted. \" Mr. Raeburn is rich enough to pay for all the nurses in the city, if they are required, \" was her ill-natured observation. \" But not too rich to despise good will, \" said Mr. Hesketh ; \"go, Dolly; Nancy will be right glad to see you. One kind friend is better than two paid nurses. \" Mrs. Hesketh was in wondrous spirits, and laughed at Lucy, who regretted that she had joined the former outcry against her brother. \" Think of the fall of that girl's pride, and don't be glumping there because you believed what everyone else thought.

Won't there be a crowded court when she is tried ! \" \"She is not caught yet, Maria,\" suggested Mr. Hesketh, as he retreated to join a friend outside and step with him into the Waterloo, heedless of the retort hurled after him. \" Isn't she ? But she soon will be, I hope. I wonder if Mrs. Coulson has heard,\" followed in soliloquy; then, \"Lucy, make haste and get your things on.\" \" What does Edwin Grove think of the lady of his choice now, I should like to know? \" muttered the younger lady, as she hurried to obey her mother, intent on swelling the tide of gossip in the highways and byways. Little knots of men clustered round the Pant in the market place, discussing the news and diving deep into the mystery of \"motives.\" The butcher's boy, the baker's boy, and the grocer's boy exchanged the information they had severally gathered in their respective places of business, or in eavesdrop ping during an impressive oration delivered on the chemist's steps by a draper to three or four neighbouring shopkeepers. Then the industrious boys proceeded to disseminate the same through the crab-like limbs of the city. Housemaids found the news on the steps with the milk or the rolls, and mistresses went shopping to purchase the \"truth,\" along with feathers or flannel. Dorcas meetings held up their hands in astonish ment, councilmen and guardians waxed magniloquent on the evils attendant on indiscreet and indiscriminate charity, quoting, as conclusive arguments, the fable of \"The Man and the Serpent,\" and the adage, \"There's no making a silk purse out of a sow's ear.\" And sure never fable and proverb were so associated or bandied about as were those two that Christmas week. Everyone remembered that it was at Christmas Rhoda was found, and some few went so far as to say it was like a judgment on Mr. Marsh for taking up a beggar's baim, and setting up to be better than his neighbours. Reverend divines read touching homilies on the vice of in-"], [372, "360 STUNG TO THE QUICK. gratitude, and dissenting ministers improved the occasion with equal zeal. But no one thought of preaching or teaching the evil of evil speaking. No one stepped out of his way to say to that unruly member, the tongue, \" Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth.\" No one hurled the shaft of the Ninth Commandment against the Hydra of Report, though many turned it against Rhoda. No one, did I say? Yes, one. Dr. Grove had a theory of his own, and maintained it vigorously and strenuously, whenever the events at the Tower and the \"monster of iniquity\" came under discussion. On Elvet Bridge he met Mrs. and Miss Hesketh, glowing and exultant, hastening to give Mrs. Coulson the earliest reliable intelligence and claim a full meed of honour for far-seeing prophecy. \"Well, doctor, here are fine doings! Who is in the right now, pray? Did not I warn Mr. Marsh against picking up rubbish out of the dirt ? \" \" I remember you did, Mrs. Hesketh ; I was not likely to forget it,\" responded he, drily. \" Ah ! and look what has come of despising my warning ; look what an ungrateful serpent he has been fostering \u2014 a disgrace to Durham!\" \" It is a disgrace to Durham : I agree with you there. But I think we differ somewhat, madam.\" \" I should think there could not be two opinions upon the subject,\" thrust in Lucy, pertly.

Faugh ! what a colony of carrion crows society must be, pouncing as readily on sister or brother once out of the pale, as on the most offensive offal.\" Dr. Grove came in for his share of abuse ; was voted a brute and a bear on all hands, and was threatened with social excommunication ; but he went his way composedly \u2014 kept on never-minding, and when Mrs. Smiles had the next influenza, Mr. Monkhouse the gout, Captain Bell the idle ophobia, or Miss Smith the nothingania, Dr. Grove was sent for in a very great hurry, no one else being considered to turn the medical trencher upon no nicely adjusted a pivot. CHAPTER XLV. A CRISIS FOR LUCY. Rhoda might have sunk into the ground at the door of Crazy Jem's hut for all that could be known of her. Had she whisked through the air on a broomstick, her disap pearance could not have been more complete and effectual. An Indian in the woods will follow a trail like a bloodhound, and a London detective will make a regular chain of very detached links, but Rhoda had left neither trail nor links. Eva's jewels were found in Rhoda's room, though Rhoda's"], [377, "365 A CRISIS FOR LUCY. trinkets had disappeared, but not so much as a pocket handkerchief which bore an identifying mark had been removed. Months before, she had withdrawn her money from the funds and invested it elsewhere, so even that clue was lost ; and at length the official had to abandon the pursuit and acknowledge himself defeated. Mrs. Hesketh's interest and excitement increased with every fresh failure ; she waxed warm on the incapacity and imbecility of the police, whom she stigmatised as \"a set of old women,\" until one of the maligned brotherhood was moved to retort, and expressed his opinion that, \" If she'd mind her own busi ness it would look better of her, and may be she would find it quite as much as she could manage. Folks as live in glass houses should not throw stones, and somebody may sing on the wrong side of the mouth afore long.\" This was said amongst his fellows, but the circle round the pebble enlarged until the last ripple touched the margin of the stream, and Mrs. Hesketh, glancing at her distorted image in the ruffled waters, wondered at the impertinence of meddling people, and wished they would mind their own business. Not being an official \"old woman,\" she had not observed Lucy's movements as closely as had the said \" old women,\" whose observations had given so much offence, and whose recognised business it was to observe. Occupied with the important business of painting Rhoda's character blacker than the black reality, Mrs. Hesketh had'no leisure to bestow on trivialities at home, and indeed would have been most indignant had anyone hinted that a child of hers was not competent to take care of herself. The singing-lessons had been discontinued for some time on account of Mr. Hesketh's objection to the drain on his pocket. Still Signor Ronchetti drove his light phaeton to the Water loo, and, until the Christmas vacation, proceeded on foot to"], [378, "366 STUNG TO THE QUICK. the school in the Bailey, while, somehow or other, Lucy generally contrived to have an errand which took her the direct route of either his exquisite vehicle or more exquisite self. Latterly, she had been seen on the river-banks long after dark, companioned by the fascinating foreigner, who had become still more affectionate and confidential since her dis play of temper over Edwin Grove's stray love-letter. Durham, as Rhoda had once remarked, does not overflow with beaus. Students are but birds of passage, and prudent mammas hold their daughters at a distance from possible danger, while of the native commodity there is a natural dearth ; enterprising young men go out into the world to make their way in a wider field, and of those who remain indigenous to the soil, few care to take another man's cast off, when fresh hearts are to be had for the asking in plenty. Consequently Lucy, after her quarrel with Edwin Grove, stood in the terrible predicament of an old-maid-elect \u2014 a position of all others most mortifying to a girl whose ruling passion was vanity \u2014 so that, when Signor Ronchetti, with his seductive voice and bland manner, flattered her in broken English, and looked languishingly and lovingly at the des pised maiden, no wonder her vain heart palpitated and flut tered with delight at being the chosen of so enchanting a mortal, for whom a score of young misses were dying; or that her wounded self-love prompted a desire to prove she could have a better beau than Edwin any day. Aunt Dorothy had warned her that there was danger in listening to more than lessons, but she declared her aunt had \" grown a cross old frump. \" Her father spoke against foreigners in very significant terms, but her mother, to whom the Signor was particularly conciliatory, vowed he was the most refined and elegant man of their acquaintance. An odd present now and then had done much to create this interest in his favour, and to blind or reconcile Mrs. Hesketh to any scheme matrimonial he might be supposed to entertain."], [379, "367 A CRISIS FOR LUCY. After his professional visits ceased, complimentary ones com menced; and so it happened that, while Aunt Dorothy was hovering about Eva's bed and Mrs. Hesketh was holding confabs with the widow Coulson, Signor Ronchetti was hovering round Lucy Hesketh, and making very desperate love indeed. How very ardent and impassioned were the glances which found their way through the gold-rimmed spectacles to Lucy's susceptible heart; how very naturally the pressure of the waist was substituted for the pressure of the hand; how very soon the enamoured Italian became assured that the heart of mia cara Lucia was all his own! All his own ? Lucy had many conferences with the hand some Signor, but somehow she never felt it a part of duty to confide the unimportant episode of her courtship with Edwin Grove, or the amount of pique which stimulated the encour agement of his own suit. No ; she entered fully into the prevailing gossip \u2014 her rivalry with Rhoda Wearbank, when they were school-girls together at Miss Robson's establishment, and later for precedence in society (society is a gem with many facets) ; the haughty airs the poor foundling had given herself, looking down upon her actual superiors as if they were dirt beneath her feet; the absurd partiality of Mr. Marsh and his friends (her own father and brother included), and the dinoue ment which she had alway'S expected. No doubt the vile wretch belonged to people of the very lowest order. She had always said no good would come of her, and people would believe it now she was found out. She asked the Signor's opinion whether they would transport the charity-girl or not when she was taken, but her dear Jacopo, though greatly interested, was not conversant with English law; and though \" ver mush dolore he not know, he no doubt the infame woman get her desert \u2014 de bad pe-pol always do. \" No \u2014 though she conveyed to his willing ear every item of intelligence respecting the family at the Tower, which she could elicit from her communicative papa, not doubting that what so deeply interested her must equally interest her lover \u2014 though"], [380, "368 STUNG TO THE QUICK. she narrated each step of the pursuit for Rhoda, and grew impatient when the detective failed to detect \u2014 she never said one word of the faithless swain who had deserted her and gone over to the enemy \u2014 not one word. Probably she was afraid of rousing the jealous fire which is supposed to form the chief ingredient of an Italian's composi tion, and which seemed only to slumber in those very bright dark eyes behind the gold-rimmed glasses. The vacation was over. The detective had returned to Town, and the Misses Robson's pupils to their studies. Aunt Dorothy was still making herself useful at the Tower, where Cuthbert and his wife had been received with a cordial welcome, and there was no one to censure or advise Lucy, even supposing she had been amenable to advice. Betty, however, had a belief that that \"furren chap wur te thick wi' Miss Lewsee,\" and, with a shrewd suspicion her master had no knowledge of the love-making carried on under Mrs. Hesketh's very nose and behind his back, told him her suspicions. There was storm in the sky forthwith. His hatred of foreigners showed itself pretty conspicuously. In no very measured terms he forbade the admission of Signor Ronchetti into the house on any pretence, and said no child of his should have either Frenchman or Italian dangling after her. \"The fellow may be an Italian brigand for aught I know.\" \"I am sure Jacopo is nothing of the kind; he is the second son of Count Ugo Ronchetti, of Genoa, and will have a large fortune when his father dies,\" asserted Lucy, apologetically. \"I don't believe one word of it,\" objected he; \" that's the way those fellows, with their fine eyes and smooth tongues, and sham titles, come round such silly chits as you, setting your mouths watering for estates in the moon and titles to lunacy. Count, indeed! as much a count as I am a barber. And pray what does he come here for, now the lessons are over ? I've no notion of throwing any more money away on"], [381, "369 A CRISIS FOR LUCY. crochets and quavers. It is quite time you learned to be useful. What have all Rhoda Wearbank's fine accomplish ments done for her ? \" \"You don't mean to compare me to that hypocritical madam, I hope?\" asked Lucy, disdainfully. \" Well, no, not exactly. You have not her remarkable attractions, but I trust, my girl, with all your pettishness and self-will, you have a better heart at bottom. I have heard you, hinny, say very spiteful things at times even of her, but I should be very sorry if I thought they were more than lip deep.\" Lucy never spoke, perhaps conscience was whispering and kept her silent. \" No, Lucy, my bairn, I would disown you, cast you off at once, if that vain heart of yours was a well of vice and sin as deep and bitter as that of Marsh's niece. And now touching: Signor Ronchetti. The fellow comes after vou for money, take my word for it. It's pretty well known I shall have a good round sum to give you, and he means to lay hold of it, or my name's not Hesketh. But, Lucy, mark my words, he shall never have a penny of mine, and you shall have no consent of mine to your marriage, even if he meant to marry, and was not merely making a fool of you.\" Lucy's pocket-handkerchief was in request; she sobbed out \u2014 \" It is very unkind of you, papa, to say such cruel things of Signor Ronchetti; I am sure he never thought of your money, he has plenty of his own, and as for making a fool of me that he is not. I know he would be glad to marry me to-morrow, if I would only consent. And I don't see why you should object to him. Mamma admires him.\" \"The deuce she does; then probably she has already given her consent to this very desirable match, without consulting me, since she admires the gentleman so much.\" \" Well, she said she'd consider about it ; she did not appear to have any objection.\" z"], [382, "370 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \"Look you, Lucy, I should be glad to see you married to any fair-sailing, straightforward Englishman, but let you fall into the hands of a hot-headed, jealous-pated, money-grasp ing foreigner, who rambles from place to place and earns his living by singing or squalling to gaping crowds, who has no recommendation to your favour besides his voice and bewhis kered face, I'll be hanged if I do! And, mark you, Miss Lucy, if I catch him within my doors again, I'll try what my crabstick can do towards the cure of love. I'll give his fine cloak such a dusting it never had before ! \" \" Here comes mamma ! \" exclaimed Lucy, gladly. \"Does she? Well, then, tell her what I say \u2014 and mind \u2014 I mean it.\" And off went Mr. Hesketh, not caring for a scene with his wife in his then exited state. The third day following her sire's denunciation of foreigners in the aggregate, and Signor Ronchetti individually, Lucy strayed towards the Bailey in time to prevent her new lover seeking her at home, and thereby coming within reach of the threatened crabstick. Oh, that her father, and not the inquisitive clerk, had stood at the office door and watched her as she went! Oh, for the ancient portcullis to drop at her approach and bar her passage! Oh, for a strip of orange peel upon the nar row flags, that she might trip and sprain an ankle on the curbstone ! Oh, that the Misses Caldcleugh, nodding to her so familiarly, from the confectioner's shop, had beckoned or called her in and kept her in close converse, but for half an hour ! Alas, the clerk peered after her, and made a mental memoran dum, \u2014 the portcullis existed solely in antiquarian tomes,\u2014 it was the month for oranges, but the street was clean even by the theatre door, and the Misses Caldcleugh, preferring to gossip about rather than with her, stepped forward, and exchanging glances and comments, followed her retreating figure not only with eyes but feet. One chance she had \u2014 one. Edwin Grove met her face to face!"], [383, "A CRISIS FOR LUCY. 371 He flushed \u2014 stopped\u2014 extended his hand, would have spoken\u2014 but they were close to the Misses Robson's; Signor Ronchetti was bowing a graceful adieu to the prim ladies; so Lucy, elevating her head, ignored Edwin's proffered hand and passed him in scornful silence, leaving him to digest his reception with what composure he could under the bat tery of the Misses Caldcleugh's quizzical glances. \" He that will not when he ma;-, When he will, is met with nay said the younger of these laughing damsels, archly, as the rebuffed surgeon, biting his lips and occupied with his own reflections, would have walked past them without recognition. Thus suddenly called to his senses, he raised his hat with a grim smile, growled out something which was meant to be civil and was not, then strode on out of hearing, inwardly anathematising all the petticoated race as the source of mischief and misery to man. He had seen the graceful Italian, and felt the full force of Miss Fanny Caldcleugh's well-worn couplet. Meanwhile Lucy and the Signor had met, he had lifted his glossy hat from his more glossy curls, smiled, and dis played a row of firm white teeth (suggestive of a bite), then with a word of interrogation, answered by one of acquies cence, he drew the lady's arm within his own, slipping the fastening cords of his cloak towards the shoulder for the purpose. Disregarding the three pairs of envious eyes which fol lowed their movements, the two bent their steps down to the riverside, turning to the left towards the Count's Cottage. It was not a warm day for a walk, but it was at least dry ; and lovers can supply their own caloric ; at least so it is said. Lucy was in very low spirits, notwithstanding her tempo-"], [384, "372 STUNG TO THE QUICK. rary triumph over Edwin Grove ; and on being pressed for the cause, narrated the gist of her colloquy with her father, supplementing it with assurances that he would never relent, and fears that the happy hours with her dear Jacopo were at an end. But dear Jacopo would not see the matter in that gloomy light, he insisted that happiness for them was only dawning, and certainly was not dependent on the will of Mr. Hesketh. I refrain from giving the Signor's own words, since broken English, however interesting from young lips to young ears, looks somewhat ridiculous on paper; and there was no thing comic in either Signor Ronchetti's meaning or his manner. He urged Lucy to become his wife at once, and trust to obtain her father's forgiveness afterwards : insisted that Mr. Hesketh was anything but implacable ; that her mother was favourable and her aunt so genial, he was sure she would be a mediator between all parties. Then he spoke of the necessity he was under of leaving the locality, and journeying southward to fulfil engagements ; of the charm which had detained him spell -bound in an unprofitable neighbourhood, amongst people incapable of appreciating his peculiar gifts; of the misery which must be his to resign her even for a time, of the thousand chances which might separate them if they parted now, and he seconded his plea with glances so eloquent and truthful, that Lucy's tears fell fast, the sad shake of the head which signified denial terminated with a sigh, the sigh was fol lowed by a look into Jacopo's eyes, and then \u2014 she hestitated ; and when a woman hesitates we know what follows. There was something fierce in Jacopo's love-making, something fiery in his glances; the clasp which welcomed her consent was more a savage recognition of possession than a lover's joyful embrace to crown betrothal. But Lucy, blind with pique and vanity, only saw ardent attachment \u2014 the fervid love of a passionate heart, before which the cold"], [385, "RETALIATION. 373 caresses and feeble flame of Edwin Grove's emotion sank into insignificance. \"Jacopo's love is worth having,\" said she to herself, as she entered her chamber that night flushed and excited; \"there is nothing tame and calculating about him.\" Then she sat down by her toilet-table, with the loosened braids of her hair hanging in listless hands, to wonder what Edwin would think when he heard she was married to some one else. Lucy had been sulky or moping for several day's. All at once she brisked up wonderfully, and went singing about the house so merrily (or pertly), that Aunt Dorothy, who came home about that time, remarked she had never seen the canny* bairn so light hearted and cheerful before, it made her old heart glad. The gladness soon turned to sorrow. February brought more tears than fell from sky or clouds. Signor Ronchetti drove his light phaeton out of Durham for the last time. The foreign singing bird had flown, and Lucy Hesketh had flown with him ! CHAPTER XLVI. RETALIATION. The preceding days Lucy had employed in arranging her belongings in such order as she would wish them to be found, O o -* or to find them on her return ; her father's reception of the husband being an established certainty in her mind, notwith standing his adverse declaration. She made a selection of essentials, which she crammed into a small leather bag, then wrote a letter to her father, and after tea slipped out unobserved, the black bag hidden in the"], [386, "374 STUNG TO THE QUICK. folds of her long shepherd's-plaid cloak, which bore a deep cape or mantilla. Once or twice, ere she gained Framwellgate bridge, she stopped, half inclined to turn back. A revulsion of feeling had come with the closing of the door behind her. Surely it never snapped so angrily before ! Suppose, after all, her father should not forgive her \u2014 he had been a kind father to her, she must acknowledge \u2014 was it right to steal away and marry against his will ? She paused, rested her bag on the seat in one of the recesses of the bridge, and stood looking over the parapet towards the water, even at the last moment wondering if she were throw ing away a chance of Edwin Grove, and what would become of her if Jacopo, who was so jealous, should hear anything about him ? What if he should make a bad husband after her desertion of home for his sake ? But she never studied the chances against his marrying her at all. No doubt of his honour or fidelity crossed her mind. She was willing to marry one man with another's image jostling for place in her heart, was willing to deceive him with a mockery of first love, but no suspicion that he could possibly deceive her rose in her breast. Untrue to him, and to herself; of his truth she had no doubt. A rattling wheel, a stoppage, a light touch of a whip-handle on her shoulder \u2014 she was roused from her reverie, in less than three minutes was seated by her Jacopo's side, and rolling northwards. Round the corner into Millburngate, down the hill, and up again along Framwellgate, on past Dr. Grove and Dr. Grove's tall house, which seemed to frown upon them, as Lucy* sighed, and Jacopo turned a fiery glance towards it \u2014 on, beyond the irregular line of houses \u2014 on to the open country \u2014 on past an open gate, whence a dim path crossed a broad meadow to wards a sunken belt of forest trees and firs. By a strange coincidence both travellers turned their heads in that direction, and Lucy explained that in the hollow"], [387, "RETALIATION. 375 behind those trees lay the Grey Tower where Rhoda had played her pranks so recently. There was a savage gleam in the Signor's eye, an angry force in the lash on his horse's quivering flanks, strongly at variance with the \" Ah, indeed ! \" his sole acknowledgment of the information. Silence fell on both, they drove through the turnpike, on between straggling houses and pitmen's cottages, over the moor, pebbles and cinders flying beneath the horse's hoofs, the shadows of evening deepening into night \u2014 night overhead, night in the heart \u2014 on through Pityme, whose very name should have turned the travellers back. Plawsworth's scattered habitations loomed ghostlike in the gloom \u2014 the open door of a beerhouse, here and there, shot a ray* of light athwart the roadway, or a reeling fellow right in the horse's track. Now and then a vehicle was driven cautiously past to avoid collision in the dark, and a cheery \" good-night\" or \" gude-neet\" challenged a response, but in the phaeton was silence most unnatural. Fear was creeping over Lucy, a presentiment of evil, a strange longing to return while return was possible, and at length the feeling grew into words. But Jacopo, recalled from his dreams, whatever they might be, laughed and kissed away her unshaped fears and fancies, and by the time Chester-le-Street was gained, her drooping spirits had re vived. Here the lamps were lit, and a cigar \u2014 the horse baited \u2014 a glass of negus shared by the travellers, and on they whirled, leaving the old Roman ' city in the street\" far behind. Jacopo was himself again, tender, loving, and respectful withal ; nor did the pair relapse into silence until the wheels rattled over the pavement of Newcastle. At the Turf Hotel Jacopo drew rein ; an ostler touching a far-worn seal-skin cap, held the horse's head whilst the tra vellers alighted. With a whispered word of reassurance the Signor, carrying Lucy's leather bag, walked on to the bar,"], [388, "376 STUNG TO THE QUICK. nodded familiarly to the barmaid, whom he saluted as \" Bella,\" and inquired for the landlord. The Signor was apparently no stranger to that individual, between whom and himself ensued a little jocular conversa tion, followed by one of business. A crisp bank-note changed hands in payment for long hire of horse, and man, and phaeton. \" Shall I give you a receipt, Signor ? \" \"Non importa \u2014 no, I tank you, I am haste \u2014 buona notte \u2014 coom, mia cara.\" He once more lifted the bag, gave his arm to Lucy, dropped a chinking fee into the hand of the obsequious ostler, but declined the proffered aid in carrying his little luggage. He \"was not go far.\" By a somewhat circuitous route he led Lucy to the Neville, where supper, previously ordered, was prepared against their arrival. Here, at his request, the Signora was shown to a room to disrobe. Two heavy travelling trunks, a hat-box, and a small valise, lay there ready packed, and labelled \" Signor Ron chetti, passenger;\" no more \u2014 no destination was appended. The hasty supper despatched, a label \" Signora Ronchetti \" attached to the leather bag, another bill paid, the luggage carried to the railway-station close at hand, and soon Lucy and Jacopo were whirling over the iron road in a first-class carriage of the mail train to York, her own indentity lost. He had represented the impossibility of procuring a mar riage licence in the diocese of Durham, where her father's name was well known, even supposing a clergyman could have been found to perform the ceremony. In York he had friends who could witness and attest the nuptials, which, to be binding, must be performed in a Catholic and Protestant church also. Lucy had objected to a marriage at the Regis trar's, the new law then being even more unpopular amongst women than it is now. For many miles they were the only occupants of the"], [389, "RETALIATION. 377 carriage, and Lucy, feeling at last that she had launched on an unknown and dangerous sea, wept long and bitterly. At first her companion attempted to soothe her with pro mises and caresses, then waxed indignant at the insult levelled against his honour in shedding tears, as if she doubted him, and evinced so much displeasure, that Lucy had some difficulty in allaying his irritation. However, he had gained his point; there were no more tears. \"You had bettare vear thees, mia cara,\" said he, after a time, producing a wedding ring, \" it will not look veil for me vise to hav no rings. You see it would be shames to take a young ladie not my vise to de albergo; so, mia Lucia, I will put on dis leetle gold ring, for de sake of your good name, me love, and to make seem all right.\" The words cut Lucy to the soul, gentle and tender as they were ; the kindly thoughtfulness and care of Jacopo for her good name told her it was forfeited, and she at his mercy \u2014 and the world's. As she shrank from the ring with a visible start and shudder, he added \u2014 \" In von, two day, it vill be all right, mia cara \u2014 all right. You vill only be call your new name a day two before de time. I vill call you Miss Hesket if you mosh prefer \u2014 but it look bad, ver bad. I am tink for you, I love you too mosh to like see peoples look at mia Lucia ver strange. Coom, you bettare vear de ring.\" The ring was slipped on the maiden's unresisting finger, the hand kissed, and Lucy was assumed to be the Signora Ronchetti. It is probable the Signor knew how much like a culprit she felt, he took so much pains to convince her all was for the best, and in the interest of her fair fame. It was very late when the train reached York. The heavy baggage was left in charge at the station \u2014 a porter, shouldering bag and valise, undertook to open the portals of an inn for the weary travellers, and the jaws of the Black Bull engulfed Lucy and her good name."], [390, "378 STUNG TO THE QUICK, While Lucy was led into a sitting-room, which might serve very well for an inn, but very ill for a home, and there divested of cloak and bonnet, the Signor followed the luggage upstairs. After partaking of a biscuit and a glass of wine, the Signora, fatigued with her long journey, was shown to her dormitory, and the chamber-maid, with a hope that she would find every thing comfortable, retired. Lucy, sleepy and yawning, proceeded to disrobe, but on turning to unlock her bag was surprised to see the valise by its side. \"Dear me, that stupid boots has made a mistake. Jacopo will be sadly at a loss for his things in the morning,\" muttered she. \" I suppose it would be safe if I put it outside. Per haps I had better not, it may contain money. He will send if he requires it.\" Sleepy as she was, she said her prayers more earnestly than she had done for many years; then, before extinguish ing her light, would have locked her door, but there was no key, and no bolt. \"How provoking! and in a strange place, too; but I can put ;i chair against the door. I should be sure to hear if it were moved.\" It was done, and in five minutes Lucy was asleep, soundly asleep ; a peal of thunder would scarcely have awakened her. \"Madame, madame, it is almost ten o'clock; the gentleman begs me to say he is waiting breakfast.\" \"Ten o'clock!\" Lucy sprang out of bed. \"Say I will be with him immediately.\" Ashamed to have overslept herself, she hurried to effect her toilet. Before the dressing-table she stood aghast. It was strewed with brushes, pomades, and perfumery, not hers, and on an adjoining chair Jacopo's valise lay unstrapped. The chair, too, was gone from the door. What could this mean ?"], [391, "RETALIATION. 379 She sank into a seat bewildered and confounded, the room seemed to swim round, her breath was almost gone, and tears were held back by amazement and indignation. \" How dared he intrude into my room whilst I slept. It was base and unmanly. I'll let him know!\" A second summons from the chamber-maid stimulated her movements, and soon she followed her guide to a smaller room than the one they had occupied the previous night. A spark of her mother's temper lit her eyes and tipped her tongue as she approached the breakfast-table, and de manded \" by what right he had dared to intrude within her room ?\" A significant glance at the waiter entering with a loaded tray imposed caution, and an equally significant pressure of the wedding ring as he took her hand to lead her to a seat was the only answer vouchsafed until they were alone. Then followed apologies and reasons harping on the same themes, necessity, appearances, regard for her, which rang in her ears with Mephis tophelean mockery. Her reproaches of cruelty and want of proper respect were met by quiet disclaimers in deferential tones, yet every pacifying sentence was so couched it wounded like a thorn in a chaplet of roses. After many unavailing efforts to soothe and console her, Jacopo started from the breakfast-table, declaring he should be too late to procure a licence, and arrange for their wed ding to-morrow, unless he made haste. More than two hours elapsed between his departure and return, hours spent by Lucy in meditations not over-flatter ing to her self-love. On his return with beaming face, and an assurance all was arranged satisfactorily, that his friend would meet them at the Minster, and that unless she overslept herself a second time, they would be united in the morning, and she his wife in fact as well as name, her confidence was restored. She was sorry for her former suspicions, and tendered a kiss of peace. Then the pair sallied forth to saunter through"], [392, "380 STUNG TO THE QUICK. the ancient city, as any couple of strangers might have done. The day passed, the night came, dark and gloomy, with a drizzling rain ; but that did not keep them within doors. The theatre was open, and thither they went, the Signor intent on pleasing, Lucy on being pleased. With a smile, and a promise she would not oversleep her self, she left him for the night, full of hope for the morrow, and renewed faith in her dear Jacopo. From that dreamy semi-oblivious state between sleeping and waking, she was roused to the consciousness that her door was opened, the chair removed, her candle relit. Jacopo was in the room, locking the door. She strove to move \u2014 to speak \u2014 her senses were alive, her limbs and voice enthralled. Deliberately the Signor walked to her bedside, the light of the two candles full upon his face. \"Lucy Hesketh,\" said a clear English voice, which made her heart leap up with terror, \" do you know me ? \" Spectacles, moustache, whiskers, were gone, high stiff collar and stock torn away, and there, opposite to Lucy's staring eyes, stood Rhoda Wearbank, cold and vindictive. \"Lucy Hesketh,\" iterated she, \"years ago you taunted me with words of cruel, malicious scorn, you affixed to me the brand of ignominious birth, loaded my unfortunate and unknown mother's name with opprobrium, and scoffed at me as a dependent on charity. I never forgot it \u2014 I never forgave it ! From that hour I resolved to repay you with full interest. Had my resolution faded out in absence, had my purpose faltered or wavered on my return home, you would have recalled me to the duty I owed to my dead mother and myself; for never did you or your mother miss chance or opportunity to remind me I was base-born and charity-bred. Your brother I depised, and hated in that he ivas your brother. I wound him round my finger, meant to break his heart \u2014 he is better than his kith and kin; I am not sorry that I failed in that.\""], [393, "381 RETALIATION. The stern voice softened somewhat as this sentence left Rhoda's lips ; but colder grew her tones, more rigid her stony face, as she told out her story of inflexible hatred to a listening ear and tortured heart. \" Until that fatal picnic I had no settled plan to punish you. Stung to the quick before, I was goaded then to mad ness, and vowed to be revenged in kind. You were jealous of your lover that day with little cause; since, I have made cause in abundance. I stole him from you, and, as Signor Ronchetti, watched every phase of pique or jealousy your shallow mind revealed. I handed his written proposals over to you. Was not your passionate emotion a feast of revenge for me ? for me, the daughter of a beggar or worse ? \" The last word hissed through her teeth like the breath of a serpent, and the venom was as potent. \" Worse \u2014 Miss Hesketh, Signora Ronchetti, do you com prehend? worse! You are that worse now. Not with love, but hate, did Jacopo woo you \u2014 followed you for months working slowly to an end, to this Signor Ronchetti lured you from your home \u2014 and who shall prove that he did not? Willingly you came, assumed a name and ring to which you had no right, and who shall prove that marriage had been promised ? You have travelled together day and night, occupied the same chamber, and here he leaves you, defying you to prove that Signor Ronchetti and Rhoda Wearbank are one. Ere this, slander has whetted her teeth on your mother's name and yours, and those tooth-marks never die out. As you stung me, I have stung you, but deeper. You are supposed to have eloped with a man \u2014 even were it proved otherwise (as is impossible), your will was good towards the gentleman \u2014 and that will stick like a burr. Signora Ronchetti, you will be late at the church to-morrow morning. You will oversleep yourself, I am afraid,\" was said with a bitter sneer, while Lucy, powerless to speak, was convulsed with agony. \" Here to-night, in this room,\" concluded the implacable foe, \" Rhoda Wearbank lays down her name for ever \u2014 Signor"], [394, "382 STUNG TO THE QUICK. Ronchetti parts with his to-morrow. I will make myself a better name in a new career, and drop the stigma of my birth for ever. Let it cleave to you a 'beggar, and worse! I have my revenge at last.\" Compelled to listen, unable to scream for help, Lucy's torture had been unfathomably excruciating, and, though a torpor was stealing over her faculties, she saw with an accession of pain Rhoda strip off coat and vest, with a scornful laugh, and then came kindly obliviousness. The sun was high when she awaked to consciousness and dread. The valise, brushes, perfumery, remained \u2014 only the Signor was gone, only the deserted Signora left to struggle against calumny and cralt, and hide her head with shame. CHAPTER XLVII. A FRESH SURPRISE. Several days elapsed before Frank Raeburn could be per mitted to see his wife, except during her slumbers, when he would stand and gaze upon her wistfully and remorsefullv as at first, until warned by her rising eyelids to steal away. Cartloads of refuse dye-woods, procured from the carpet factory by the river, were laid down on the open space between her humble room and the Tower. The horses were sent away, one only for emergencies being kept on the premises, and that one was removed from the stable beneath to one extemporised; the carriage was left uncleaned and unused, lest the dashing of water and clatter of pails should disturb the tranquillity so essential to recovery. Beck and Martin went about their duties slowly and stealthily, as if free motion necessitated noise; and when the former be chance broke into an involuntary whistle over his work, he checked himself instantly as if he were committing a crime. Even Towzer appeared to take his tone from the bipeds"], [395, "A FRESH SURPRISE. 383 around him, and being released from durance with no stain on his character, wagged his tail to express satisfaction, but never ventured on a bark, his instinct warning him against forbidden noise. Chanticleer's clarion had been silenced summarily on Dr. Grove's intimation to Nancy, \" You had better put that bird in the pot, he may do your mistress good there; strutting and crowing in the yard here he is only doing mischief. But mind, Nancy, you must boil him to rags, and afterwards reduce the broth to a cupful. It will have to be given with a teaspoon, and to be of service must be strong. \" Only the twittering robins were undisturbed, and their notes served more to mark the stillness than to break it. His restless, eager, and almost vindictive search after Rhoda kept Mr. Raeburn, afoot or on horseback, continually in motion, and prevented him from wearing himself out in self accusation. But in his nightly solitude he would muse, and think, and condemn himself. \" I was to blame for suffering Rhoda's presence here when convinced she was in love with me. Why should I have exposed my darling to the strong passions of that woman ? Had I no sense? Did not her eyes warn me? Dolt that I was to think the danger past when Eva was my own. True, my heart was secure; but men have fallen into temp tation before now, and I owed it to Rhoda herself to avoid her. I was weak to yield to Eva's request, with a reason against Rhoda's presence withheld from the guileless pleader. Poor Eva, I have used you hardly, cruelly. My unfounded jealousy has been your under-gaoler. Had I but been true to my faith in you, I should have broken through the fabulous chain of evidence. Martin doubted, Dr. Grove doubted ; only I ! \u2014 I, who should have trusted most! I alone was hoodwinked from the first ! \" He groaned and tossed uneasily on his pillow, where he lay half dressed, as he had lain since the discovery of his wife ; her precarious condition made him a watcher, though apart."], [396, "384 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \"Oh,\" he muttered, half aloud, \" that I\u2014 with my mother's fate before me; with my father's aimless wanderings, and life of unavailing remorse as a beacon \u2014 should have surrendered to the promptings of jealousy ! Surely that insidious fiend could not have probed my heart to play upon its weakness from the first!\" He started up \u2014 \"I see it all! I remember now, the duet my darling sang would have been remembered only through her tones, had not Rhoda struck the key-note of my jealous fears with the remark 'Cuthbert's favourite!' Oh, I see it now ; she was afraid of Eva even then, and thrust ' Cuthbert's ' name as a wedge between us. I remember \u2014 I remember how she hammered the name suggestively into my* jealous heart, until I was afraid even to declare my own attachment. But having won my guileless Eva \u2014 my pure white dove, I must have been a madman to cherish those old doubts, and bring as evidence against her trifles a true man should have discarded for ever. Desdemona never was more pure and chaste than she, yet I have been as black in jealous fury as the heathenish Moor. Poor, poor Eva, when not even thy husband could raise a voice in thy defence. My ill-used angel, if thy life be only spared, no human being shall dare so much as breathe upon thy name. I will trust thee blindly, whatsoever phantasms should deceive my senses. Oh, Eva ! Eva ! how shall I make atonement ? \" And so the nights would wax and wane, with intervals of slumber, and angry chasings and denunciations of Rhoda as the quest became daily more impotent. The first blush of dawn would find him ascending the wooden steps to the invalid's room, and as Mrs. Prosser's answers varied so did his countenance. \" Thank you, sir, she is no worse ; \" or, \" If I may be so bold as think, Mrs. Raeburn is ray ther better,\" would send him down cheerful and hopeful. \" The poor lady's not so well this morning, sir; she has been very low all night,\" would fill him with fears and gloomy forebodings, and a close observer might have seen"], [397, "385 A FRESH SURPRISE. his lips and brow contract with pain, and his head bow on his breast, as with folded arms and stooping shoulders he walked through paths they had trod happily together, not caring to confront Mr. Marsh with that tell-tale countenance. In short, the cry of his heart, day and night, was \u2014 Had I but trusted her, this had never been; had I but been as active to prove her innocent as passive to believe her guilty, we had been re-united in a week; had I not shut my ears against her name, and my heart against reflection, I should have learned to mistrust appearances, and to sift for facts. I had saved her then \u2014 not killed her. Miss Dorothy came like a ray of light to the self-tortured man. She shared Mrs. Prosser's charge, and could but report what she saw; but the gentleness of her nature taught her gentleness in her mode of dealing with his anxieties. She combated Dr. Grove's dictum against his admission into the sick room, particularly when she observed that Eva's faintest moanings shaped only her husband's name. \"My dear Miss Dorothy, we must be cautious; the slightest excitement would destroy our patient ; we must be cautious \u2014 besides, she is at present unconscious.\" \" Then, Doctor, I should say there was less need for caution. The poor fellow is wearing himself to a shadow, and the canny bairn, day and night, night and day, murmurs, ' Frank, Frank,' till my heart bleeds for her,\" and the good lady wiped a pair of very moist eyes. \"Miss Dorothy, your humanity does you infinite credit, but discretion must guide the heart in cases of this nature; a sudden awakening of the senses, and a discovery of Frank by her side, might kill her. I say we must be cautious.\" \" That's all very well, Doctor, as far as it goes ; but I do not think the poor bairn is altogether unconscious, she is pining for her husband more than for life ; the sight of him might be better than physic, and it is just possible to be too cautious.\" \" Humph ! so I have discovered already ! Well, my dear AA"], [398, "386 STUNG TO THE QUICK. friend, if you think you can prepare her, or provide against a shock, we will try your remedy. Mind, I am not sanguine of its success.\" Miss Dorothy, whispering to Eva, discovered that she was not altogether insensible. She asked if there was anything she would like. \"Frank,\" was the almost inaudible answer. Could she bear to see him? \"Yes,\" shaped the white lips, almost she first lucid word which had passed them. Thereupon the kindly old maid promised, as she would have promised a child, that if she were better and patient she should see him on the morrow, trusting that the hope would strengthen her for the meeting. Prepared and fortified by the promise, she lay thin and white, with eyes and lips half closed, her tiny hand, from which the rings had slipped, colourless as the coverlet on which it rested, when Frank Raeburn, unshod, and with bated breath, approached the humble bed. He knelt down, took the wan fingers gently in his own, and murmured, \" Eva, dear Eva, my wife,\" in tones as low as a love whisper. The eyelids slowly unclosed, the dreamy eyes looked lovingly and languidly out ; the fingers clasped on his, the lips unclosed, he heard his name and bowed his head in thankful prayer over the hand he held and kissed. Further speech was interdicted, and the interview terminated abruptly, signs of undue excitement being perceptible to good Aunt Dolly in tears on her pa-tient's eyelashes. How Frank Raeburn kept his emotion under, or relieved his heart of its overflowing joy, was never known. He was seen to rush hastily to his own chamber, and the key was heard in the lock, but nothing more was seen of him for more than a couple of hours. From that day Eva's amendment was progressive. Frank sat by her pallet-bed daily, and soon had liberty of speech accorded. Gentle Mary Hesketh had gone long ere Eva was conscious of her presence, but before Aunt Dorothy resigned her post, the patient had been carried in her husband's arms like a"], [399, "387 A FRESH SURPRISE. helpless infant to her own chamber in the Tower, thenceforth to be watched with a patient devotion which savoured as much of contrition as affection. Eva, all unconscious of her husband's jealous suspicions, regarded each fresh attention as a proof only of his inexhaustible love, and garnered in her heart a store of gratitude to bless his after life. Her father, assisted by Frank and Martin to an easy chair by her side, gazed with brimming eyes on the daughter whose presence was to him as a resurrection from the dead. Too overpowered for speech, he held her feeble hand in his in thoughtful silence. Soon he grew familiarised with the fact of her existence, and long before her health was sufficiently renovated to permit her to join in conversation, his tongue was loosened, and his satisfaction expressed more audibly than was allowable in a sick room. A finger on Frank's lip was, however, a sufficient reminder, and the jest died in its birth. February brought a surprise to the Tower, and fresh motives for activity to Mr. Raeburn. Aunt Dorothy had gone home from her gentle ministration at the Tower only to encounter fresh tribulation on her brother's hearthstone. On the evening of Lucy's flight, as she quietly pushed her knitting pins through her large ball of cotton preparatory to clearing away work for the entrance of supper, her own thoughts were echoed by her brother's question: \"Where is Lucy?\" \"In her own room, I believe,\" she answered; \"the bairn spends more of her time there alone in the cold than I think good either for mind or body.\" \" I suppose she can please herself where she sits,\" thrust in Mrs. Hesketh, tartly ; \" the company downstairs is not so agreeable now, that we need wonder if she does prefer solitude in the cold. I can remember when she commonly sat in the parlour with \""], [400, "388 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \"Yes, before that foreign scamp turned her head, and be hanged to him ! \" interrupted her husband, wilfully misun derstanding his wife. \" But it is time she came to supper. Betty, call Miss Lucy down,\" said he to the domestic then coming in with the ale. \" Miss Lowcee's nut in, sur, aw heerd th' dur sneck ahint her suin ester tea. She's nut coom back yit.\" \" Not come back, and after ten o'clock ! A pretty time of night for a young lady to be out, unknown to her family. Do you know where she is gone, Dolly?\" \"No.\" \"Do you, Maria?\" \" Not I ; she never thinks it worth while now to tell me where she is going, and I don't for my part believe she has gone out at all, since Miss Dorothea is not in the secret. She is the only confidante in this house, now, \" answered Mrs. Hesketh, spitefully. Taking no heed of the sneer, Aunt Dolly said to him, conciliatingly, \" I'll go and see if she is upstairs, honey ; she never can be out so late as this.\" \" If she is out, I'll wager a sovereign she's with that sneaking Italian you've been encouraging to \" \" I encourage ! Mr. Hesketh, \" cried his spouse, in answer to his glance as much as his words. \" I encourage ! Well, I like that. If I were you I would not be quite so ready to shift my own sins to other people's shoulders. But, indeed, I do not see what there is sneaking about Signor Ronchetti. He is a very gentlemanly man, and quite as good as we are ; perhaps better. In his own country he is a nobleman : Lucy might go farther and fare worse. \" \" Then let him carry his nobility back to his own country, and keep it there ; and as for Lucy, let her fare worse, for I'll be hanged if she shall have a penny of my money if she marries a beggarly fellow who cannot speak three words of plain English.\" \"Eh, what's that, Dolly? Not there, and a letter for me ? \" It is impossible to describe the consternation in his counten-"], [401, "389 A FRESH SURPRISE. ance. Knife and fork dropped, his hands shook, his ruddy face purpled as he took the letter from his wondering sister's hands, and stared in blank amazement at the superscription with a boding portent of evil. Mrs. Hesketh's impatient curiosity overcame propriety. She snatched the unopened missive from his tremulous clasp and tore it open. Then ensued a scene in which so many feelings blent and mingled in disorder, the pen drops powerless. It was a scene of storm and recrimination, of anger conflicting with parental feel ing, a scene too painful and too unpleasant to repeat in detail. Mrs. Hesketh's violence ended as usual. Miss Dorothea wept, but her tears fell for others only, and did not hinder her activity. She had loosened her brother's white neckerchief, collar and vest, sprinkled his face, and shaken him into speech and consciousness ; and whilst words of anger, grief, affection and indignation came huddling together thick and fast from his lips, she found time to slip out and send Betty for her counsellor, Dr. Grove. Dr. Grove from his own doorstep had observed the Signor drive past, noting the circumstance more from the presence of a muffled female in the vehicle than from any connection between his own thought and the driver. Lucy had not intimated the direction of their flight ; the Doctor, however, supplied a clue. Mr. Hesketh was for an immediate pursuit, but it was then past midnight. Dr. Grove said his own horses were knocked up, or he would have lent his brougham. All the inns were closed. Even at the Waterloo neither horse nor vehicle was to be obtained that night, and sorely against his will Mr. Hesketh was compelled to wait until the morrow. \" Come home with me, Hesketh. You will only feed the gossips by hiring a trap from an inn. If you will wait -until the morning, you can have mine. I will see my most urgent cases early, and join you in your search. You are scarcely cool enough to go by yourself. Besides, we shall have to in-"], [402, "390 STUNG TO THE QUICK. quire our route. I only know it to be northward, and at this hour we can make no inquries, people are in bed.\" With an ill grace the poor old man, bowed down with grief and shame, consented; and by ten in the morning they were on the road. At Pityme a man remembered exchanging a \" guid neet wi' a furriner chap as hed a lassie wiv him.\" At Plaws worth a pitman, then scarcely sober, said he had been \" nigh o'errun by a horse o'erneet, an the chap es druv gi' me a cut wi' his whip and spoke soom dom'd gibberish or owther.\" So far their road was clear. Mr. Hesketh's mind ran on Gretna Green, a belief that the Signor was a fortune-hunter running away with Lucy for what money she might inherit having full possession of his mind. Dr. Grove assented to the possibility of the supposition, but felt inclined to hint that marriage was more desirable than probable. Nothing was said of Ned on either side, though he had a place in both their thoughts \u2014 one of gratulation, the other of condemnation. At Chester-le-Street they learned that the phaeton had stopped there en route for Newcastle \u2014 that the gentleman had a cigar and a glass of negus. They also heard that the same phaeton, driven by a groom from the Turf Hotel, had for many months passed to and fro between Newcastle and Durham, but since Christmas the young foreigner had driven it himself, unaccompanied by the servant-man. Driving straight to the Turf Hotel, the groom was interro gated. He had been paid for silence during his term of ser vice, but the service over, his obligation was over also \u2014 at least, a fee induced him so to think. He told that his wont had been to drive twice a week towards Durham, always stopping short on the North-road, where he got out, and Signor Ronchetti got in. \"An theer,\" continued the man, \" aw hed ta hing stravaigin * fur mair * Strolling about."], [403, "391 A FRESH SURPRISE. than twee or three hours at a stritch, an manny a guid weetin aw gat i' th' rain waiting fur th' trap to coom back.\" \"Ah, to be sure, the Signor did drive into Durham alone,\" quoth the Doctor, pondering; \"the North-road is a good length, my man. Did you always meet the Signor at the same place?\" \" Nut a'ways. Ye see, soom tyems aw overtook him, an soom tyems aw had ta wait; aw wur nivor te gang ayont the yett.\" \"Beyond what gate?\" was the prompt interrogation. Mr. Hesketh showed signs of impatience, not seeing the connection between the inquiry and his lost daughter. \"Why, th' yett te th' meadow as lies atween that hanted Tower in t' hollow an' th' turnpike road. Yor sarten te ken th' place, an' ye coom fro Doorham.\" He did ken the place : one more question, and he had done. \" Why not pass the gate?\" \" Aw sud hev missed th' Signor iv aw hed. He cam through t' yett, an a'ways walked oop 't road to meet ma. Aw used te walk th' horse as aw gat nigh till aw saw him on th' peth.\" \" That will do, my man. Saddle a good horse, whilst I write a note; you shall have a sovereign for yourself if you deliver it at the Tower within an hour and a half \u2014 a couple if within the hour.\" \" What is the meaning of this ? What has Mr. Raeburn to do with Lucy ? We shall miss her whilst waiting for him, \" asked Mr. Hesketh, impatiently. \" I'll lose no time, my good friend \u2014 I am almost as anxious as yourself. It is my opinion \u2014 but I'll show you the note.\" It ran thus : \u2014 \" Turf Hotel, Newcastle. Dear Raeburn, \" Lucy Hesketh has eloped with her singing-master. I am here with Hesketh on their trail. Follow with all speed. I"], [404, "392 STUNG TO THE QUICK. believe Signor Ronchetti to be the accomplice of Rhoda Wearbank. \" Verbum sap, sat. \" Yours, &c. \"J. E. Grove.\" CHAPTER XLVIII. A BEGGAR, OR WORSE. The landlord of the Turf could afford no clue to the further movements of the runaways. His bill had been discharged in full. The Signor had been most punctual in his payments. They had no luggage but a small leather bag. He remem bered the Signor's refusal of a porter to carry it, on the ground that they had not far to go. Dr. Grove bit his nail and cogitated, but to little purpose ; the trail was lost. Not a lounger about the stables could remember more than the direction taken by the lady and gentleman. From inn to inn they went, from coach-office to coach office, in prosecution of their inquiries, asked hucksters and orange girls if they had observed such a young couple, either the previous night or that day, and got back to the Turf at five o'clock, to find dinner spoiling and Mr. Raeburn pacing the carpet in stern impatience. He had suffered so deeply when his wife had, to all appear ance, fled with Cuthbert, that he could sympathise with the distressed father, the more so that Dr. Grove's suspicions pointed to a foul plot against the girl's honour rather than to marriage. The hasty meal over, the three issued from the Turf to pursue the search. \" I should have gone straight to the Neville and the rail-"], [405, "A BEGGAR, OR WORSE. 393 way station, but thought I had better wait for you,\" whispered Dr. Grove to Mr. Raeburn; \"besides, Hesketh is so wedded to his belief that Lucy has been lured away by a fortune hunter, and nothing worse than a secret marriage is in the wind, I have been forced to humour him. Poor fellow, I fear there is a shock in store that will go hard with him.\" \"I fear so,\" echoed Mr. Raeburn. Nothing was known at the Neville of a foreign gentleman and lady without luggage. The three were turning away when a dapper waiter, with a napkin over his arm,' being interrogated as he was passing, stopped, considered, and then dubiously asked, \u2014 \" Without luggage, did you say, gentlemen ? \" \"Without other luggage than a leather bag.\" \" A leather bag. Ah ! a gentleman in a cloak, lady in cloak also, \u2014 urn \u2014 Signor Ronchetti did you say? Wait one moment, gentlemen. Jane,\" this to a chambermaid crossing the upper end of the hall, \" what was the name on the luggage of the foreigner in spectacles who slept in No. 17?\" \"Signor Ronchetti, Passenger,' on the large trunks, and Signora Ronchetti on the bag. I saw the gentleman write the labels. The lady was only here last evening,\" vouch safed she, \"I thought she seemed rather down like.\" \"Had the Signor been long in the hotel?\" \"A week or two, coming and going, sir; but he went away last night for good.\" \"I hope it may be for good,\" muttered Dr. Grove. \"Did not the labels state whither they were bound?\" asked Mr. Raeburn. \" No, sir, that I noticed particular. But they went to the station close by. Thank you, sir.\" The station was in a commotion. There had been an accident on the up-lme, and all the officials were in an unusual state of bewilderment and excitement. At length it was ascertained by dint of queries, labial and metallic, in various departments, that two persons whose"], [406, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 394 dress and luggage answered the descriptions given had gone on to York by a late train the previous night. \"When is the next train for York?\" \" Not before morning, sir, if then; there has been an accident within the last hour, and it is impossible to say how soon the line will be clear.\" Rhoda's fate hung on that accident. The tramway had been uptorn, so the line was not open for traffic until the following noon. Mr. Raeburn chafed inwardly at the delay even more than Mr. Hesketh, who had been lulled and soothed by the \"Signora Ronchetti,\" and whose love for his daughter, combining with his love of ease inclined him to make the best of it, and accept the son-in-law if need be. Dr. Grove's patients had been consigned to a deputy. He had many qualms of conscience about remaining ; never theless, he had a desire, amounting to a craving, to ascertain how far, if at all, Rhoda was implicated, and What degree of blame attached to the girl who might have been his son's wife had things turned out differently. The leisure was employed by the two in communicating with home \u2014 Frank, to account for his absence and to soothe Eva. At noon the next day the road was clear for traffic : tem porary metals being laid down for the purpose. (These matters are managed with more expedition nowadays.) By three o'clock the impatient travellers reached York. Much time was lost in questioning people who either did not, or would not, know anything. Day officials professed to have no cognisance of night traffic. At length, when patience was on the wane (Mr. Hesketh in a state of despair ing collapse), the night-porter, who had conducted the fugi tives to the Black Bull, was found, and found in perfect possession of his memory. On to the Black Bull, Mr. Hesketh, through streets of frowning flint, to find your Lucy crushed by flints harder than those composing wall or pavement !"], [407, "395 A BEGGAR, OR WORSE. There was this peculiarity in the bar of the Black Bull, that neither wall nor screen divided the sale counter from the bar parlour. One end had been set apart for customers, whose wont it was to sit, drink, smoke, read the paper, and discuss politics, trade, or agriculture, or any light matter of interest (a murder, for instance) which might turn up at the assizes. Before this solemn tribunal Lucy Hesketh had been ar raigned, tried, and convicted of imposture and unnameable shamelessness. She had come there at midnight as a married woman, had remained two nights and a day with a man professing to be her husband, and when her paramour decamped, leaving the bill unpaid, had endeavoured to palm off on sensible people the absurd story that her companion was a woman, and herself a virtuous girl. It was monstrous! The vile hussy*, to disgrace a respectable house with her presence; it was like the assurance of these women, said the women-folk. \"It's eneugh to mak' a parson swear,\" exclaimed the landlord, \" and t' lass reckons t' get ower us wi' blathering. 1 Belike she thinks t' pay t' bill wi' draps o' salt watter, but ah knaw a trick warth two a' that. Nobbut aw ah thought she war an honest lass, ah'd bide till she could mak' her story good, but such a cock-and-bull story goes against all common sense,\" and he looked round for the expected approbation of his customers. Nods, and becks, and loud guffaws expressed a corre sponding opinion. \" Ah say, what ar't going t' do wi' t' lass, turn her out or tak' her up for swindlin' ? \" asked a sagacious smoker in the chimney-corner. \" Ah'm fair muddl'd about it ; if t'were na sa near t'edge o' dark 2 ah'd turn her out o' t' house, ah would.\" \"Hadn't ye better keep her here till ye ferrit it aht?\" asked one more kindly disposed. 1 Blubbering. 3 Evening."], [408, "396 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \" An' wha's t' pay my bill an' nothing comes o' my ferretin' ? \" \" D'ye think we're bound to keep such powse * as yon in our house?\" interrogated the landlady. \"Suppose ye keep her till mearn, an' then took her afore a magistrate,\" suggested the former speaker. \" More like send for a constable an' give t'lass in charge for a wastrel,\" blurted out another. \" Pretheh haud thy noise, ah'm not gaumless 2 if ah am flummoxt. 3 Wha's to pay t' furriner's reckonin' if ah send- \" \" What is that ? \" The clear- voiced, decided question caused the landlord to turn and confront the speaker, one of three new comers, a resolute man, with stem purpose in his face. \" Of what, and whom are you speaking ?\" again asked Mr. Raeburn, the interloper, without impertinence, though with the air of one who had a right to ask. \" Why, sir, we are talking of a brazen-faced lass in our best cham'er, who came hither wi' a furriner as bold as brass t'other neet, an' though she wore a weddin' ring an' called herself Signora Runketty, turns out no better than she should be, now he's gawn an' left her in t' lurch.\" \" You damned scoundrel, how dare you say \" Mr. Hesketh's raised voice dropped, and his red face waned to white as a dreadful possibility crossed his mind, and he suffered himself to be led away from the gaping crowd to a quiet room, where the landlord told his version of the s.tory. As he procedeed, Mr. Hesketh seemed bursting with over mastering passion, but at the close of the incredulous narra tion, when Mr. Raeburn's sudden exclamation, \" My God, that infamous woman again!\" startled them all, he groaned aloud, and sank into the nearest chair, too overcome for utterance.

She sat or crouched on the floor, with her head against the bed-foot, her whole attitude bespeaking self-abasement and degradation. On their entrance she shuddered, but never raised her head, doubtless thinking the creaking door a signal for fresh torment and persecution, She had learned Rhoda's lesson, \"a beggar, or worse,\" to the last letter. According to arrangement, Dr. Grove alone advanced to address her. \" Miss Hesketh, I grieve to find you in this questionable condition.\" Her first impulse was to scream for joy at the sound of a friendly voice; her next to bury her face in her hands and collapse with shame. How could she face Edwin's father, branded as she was ? What could he think of her ? \" Miss Hesketh, \u2014 am I right in calling you Miss Hesketh ? \" He saw the wedding-ring. She made no reply but a sob. \" Were you aware of the consequences of your rash step to those at home, when you fled from its shelter to the arms of a stranger ? \" She rocked herself to and fro in agony. It was Edwin's father speaking to her very soul. \" Did you think of the pain you inflicted on a good father, on a kind aunt, on your mother, and all near to you, when you abandoned them for an adventurer whose faith and love were both untried ? \" Still speechless, sobbing, swaying to and fro as she sat in a heap on the floor. \" We have heard a strange story from the landlord of the inn. How much of it is true or false I am here to learn.\" She shivered at the \" we,\" seeing only the grave spare form, of Dr. Grove; as he ended she threw herself towards him with clasped hands, crying piteously \u2014 \"Oh, Doctor! Doctor! I am not as bad as I seem; indeed, indeed I am not. It was thoughtless and wicked to run away ; but Jacopo \u2014 no, Rhoda \u2014 oh! Doctor, I was dreadfully deceived. I expected to be married; indeed I did.\""], [410, "398 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \" And you are not ? \" \" No, Signor Ronchetti was no Signor after all, but only that dreadful Rhoda Wearbank in disguise, \" she gasped, recovering her self-control a little. The two by the door came a step or so forward, Mr. Raebum with difficulty restraining his companion. \" Miss Lucy, this is not a very credible story. We can believe the Signor was in league with Miss Wearbank, but not in the personation. The Signor was giving lessons in Durham whilst she was living at the Tower. Can you explain this ? \" \" God help me, no ! \" Mr. Raeburn, whispering \" keep back \" to the agitated Mr. Hesketh, came forward, and offering a hand to raise the still more abashed girl, said gently \u2014 \" Miss Hesketh, rise. I am prepared to hear and believe your story, however strange. We also come prepared to restore you to your friends, if restoration be possible. \" \" Oh, sir, my father would not receive me; I know he would not, and Edwin \" \" Leave my son out of the question, Miss Hesketh, \" said the Doctor, stiffly; \" I cannot see what he has to do with the point at issue. \" (Oh, Dr. Grove ! men seldom do see the lever moving a woman's heart.) She shrank at the rebuke. What could Edwin have to do with her henceforth? \" Doctor, the girl is as much to be pitied as blamed, \" said Frank to him in an undertone ; \" she has suffered quite enough from the coarse people downstairs without our adding to her pain. \" Then, turning to the drooping penitent, he added, \" if you will be seated, Miss Hesketh, and relate your story as suc cinctly as possible, we shall be better able to judge of its verity. Believe me, our disposition towards you is far from unfriendly. \" Mr. Hesketh could restrain himself no longer. \" Oh, Lucy ! Lucy ! \" he rushed forward, while she stood speechless as a"], [411, "A BEGGAR, OR WORSE. 399 statue; \"Lucy, you have broken your old father's ; oh, Lucy, my poor bairn ! I \u2014 I \u2014 oh, Lucy, God forgive you ! \" He sank into a chair, and she at his knees. \u2014 She was forgiven. Forgiveness grew out of the child's sorrow and his parental love. Guilt or innocence had no part in it. The father held the penitent in his arms and mingled his tears with hers. Mr. Raeburn grew impatient. Time was flying and Rhoda with it. \" Miss Hesketh, \" at length said he, \" the landlord has told us a strange tale ; so strange as to be incredible to any but those acquainted with the woman you inculpate. I, of all men should be prepared to give you credence. If it be true, and you can enable me to trace out this fiend incarnate, I shall be grateful to you for ever. I owe a duty to my wife, myself, and society to hunt down and bring her to justice. There will be time for tears hereafter ; we must act now. Proceed, and be brief, for time presses. \" Interrupted by sobs of shame (for all her pertness and self sufficiency were gone), she told the story of Jacopo's wooing, the pressure under which she consented to elope, the flight, the adoption of his name and the ring, the discovery in her chamber and Rhoda's revelation. Fitness of place or season is lost sight of in cases of extreme excitement, else that disordered chamber in the old inn was scarcely the place Lucy or Mr. Raeburn would have chosen for her narration. Intrusion at such a critical juncture had been unthought of. There knelt Lucy by her father's side, her head bent low throughout. There Mr. Raeburn stood, with folded arms, lips compressed, stem brows, and eyes like living fire. And there, the Doctor, leaning against a bed-post, with one hand over his mouth, the other down behind him, looked from beneath his penthouse brows, and as she told her tale, mut tered from time to time, \"Clever, clever; very clever, if true \u2014as clever an invention, if not.\""], [412, "400 STUNG TO THE QUICK. When she came to to the culmination of Rhoda's disap pearance, he whispered to Mr. Raeburn; \" Ingenious this, if a fabrication to screen herself, and I think I should need some tangible proof before I was deluded by it. What say you ?\" \" I believe every syllable.\" \"Ah! you always were more credulous than I. These two girls are old enemies.\" \"And Rhoda a dangerous and unforgiving one.\" \" Miss Lucy, has the Signor \u2014 or Miss Wearbank left no thing behind to trace identity and prove your statement. Trust me, our Durham friends will doubt the masquerade unless attested by something stronger than bare assertion.\" Lucy shivered. \"I cannot tell; I have been too dis tressed and harassed to think of looking. If you will leave the room sirs, I will examine it.\" They left her to her task. Over and over she turned every article in the valise; there was nothing peculiar to a lady. The room, was ransacked, the bed. On the floor beneath the valance was the discoloured cork of a small phial. That was not much, yet she secured it. Proceeding to the washstand to remove the dust from her hands, and the tear-stains from her face, she found soapy water in the bowl and a ring of value. It had slipped from Rhoda's finger unawares. It was her own condemnation \u2014 her victim's reprieve. Mr. Raeburn knew it well; it had been his own gift on his wedding-day. Dr. Grove smelt at the cork, tried it on his tongue, and after one or two \"Humphs,\" muttered, \"Where did that woman learn this? I'd give something to know. A dangerous weapon in an unscrupulous woman's hand. A drop too much had cost the girl's life. \" Ask your own son, Dr. Grove ; perhaps he may en lighten you."], [413, "EARS FROM A FULL SHEAF. 401 CHAPTER XLIX. EARS FROM A FULL SHEAF. The innkeeper's claim was satisfied; and a hint was given that \" if all rogues were well whipped, there would be sore backs under many good coats supposed to hold Christian men.\" The \" wastrel \" did not go before a magistrate, but p?o tempore to Newcastle under Dr. Grove's care, there to await her father's return. He and Frank Raebum, bent on capturing and punishing Rhoda, who had wrought so much evil to both, had left all other matters in the Doctor's hands. Ah, Mr. Raeburn, there are no telegraph wires to set in motion ; the first to start is pretty sure to keep in advance. You are late \u2014 too late. Frank, willing to believe aught that implicated Rhoda, and confirmed in his belief by the attesting ring, set off to the railway station, taking the \" left luggage \" as his starting point. It had been reclaimed early in the morning by the person who left it, a foreigner, in gold spectacles and a handsome cloak. The same foreigner easily identified, had taken a first class ticket to Hull ; had seen his own luggage into the van ; had taken a hat-box and a parcel into the carriage with him; was the only person in the compartment. The incorruptible guard could, perhaps, have told why. The trail was open \u2014 nothing clearer. He would have the woman now and pay her back in full. Stop, Frank Raeburn, you did not see the upper labels torn from the luggage, nor the under ones left there with another name than Ronchetti or Wearbank upon them. You did not see the rapid transformation of the Signor as the train hurried on its iron path. You did not see the trousers unstrapped and rolled up to the knees, revealing woman's shoes (worn provisionally), nor yet the dress unfolded from the paper parcel, nor the shawl BB"], [414, "402 STUNG TO THE QUICK. and bonnet disinterred from the depths of the hat-box (shawls and dresses were smaller and of less bulk than in these days) ; nor did you see the cloak crushed into the small box endangering the strap, nor yet the whiskers and moustache sent fluttering through the window, with a collar and stock, to scare with visions of mischance the next ploughboy who should pass; nor did you see the toilet in that impromptu dressing-room, the re-arrangement of curls and black hair, nor the elegant lady who sat triumphantly there when the Signor was dead and buried. Equally hidden from your ken was the Miss Talbot who paced the Hull platform, awaiting the arrival of her friend, the lady who rose from the Signor's tomb. No mesmeric trance revealed the name on the travelling trunks as the porters hauled them forth, and a coachman struggled to place them on the hackney vehicle's top. Not a whisper told that Rhoda was nearing the docks, was step ping with her one school friend on an Antwerp steamer, en route for Milan, with a new life before her in a foreign land. Little did you dream, Frank Raeburn, when you struck the trail, and were so sanguine, that it would be lost so soon ; or that even then the fearless, indomitable Rhoda, fierce, vindictive, and unconquerable, no longer a heroine but a victim, had succumbed to sea sickness, as she lay in her narrow berth tossing on the German Ocean. Once more she had escaped him, and once more he tasked human ingenuity to track her steps. Woe betide her if ever they should chance to meet ! Rhoda had skilfully eluded human justice, and went her way elated, but who could say where Divine justice might begin or end! The scythe of Time has mowed down seven years' harvests. Let us reckon up the sheaves in one of his many garners. Mr. and Mrs. Hesketh have long been separated: their final quarrel being over Lucy, unfortunate Lucy."], [415, "EARS FROM A FULL SHEAF. 403 The mother refused to receive or countenance her dis graced child, utterly ignoring her own encouragement of the Ita lian, throwing the onus on Mr. Hesketh and Aunt Dorothea, who, she maintained, had contrived to ruin the girl between them. The father, seconded by his tender-hearted sister, as obsti nately declared he would not make bad worse by shutting his doors against his own child, whose greatest misfortune had been a bad mother. If Miss Wearbank had been kind enough to run away with his wife instead of Lucy, he would have let her go with all his heart, and have been thankful for the relief. Whereupon arose a final quarrel, not a mere squabble ; they parted, and Mrs. Hesketh retired to the congenial atmosphere of a Scarborough boarding-house, beyond the reach of Mrs. Coulson's good-natured tongue. Then Lucy returned home, penitent and self-abased, but wonderfully improved thereby. Indeed, as years stole on, Dr. Grove was more than once heard to say Ned might do worse then marry Lucy Hesketh. True, the gossips had made free with her name, but the ring left by Rhoda in the wash-basin, and the cork which Dr. Grove fitted to the phial before he left the hotel, were sufficient to prove her truth to all right-minded people. Still it was af firmed her elopement was voluntary, the expectation of marriage -uncorroborated; but those who best knew Rhoda's arts, her subtle and vindictive spirit, could find charitable excuses .even for that. Edwin Grove's conscience was not altogether clear. He had not been as steadfast to his first troth as he might have been ; no one knew better than he the potency of Rhoda's voice and wiles, and he had made more than once the valuable dis covery that love was not always to be had for the asking. He made overtures of reconciliation when Lucy returned from a two years' voyage with Cuthbert and his wife; and Lucy shyly, but thankfully, welcomed him back. Dr. Grove, firm and straight-backed as ever, remained a -widower, not altogether with his own consent. He had cast"], [416, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 404 an approving eye upon Aunt Dorothea from the first, but his old habit of over-caution clung to him. He watched and waited, and waited and watched, not only to make sure of his prize, but to be sure she was a prize, and when con vinced she was a treasure for any man, deliberately proposed. Whatever Aunt Dorothea said on the occasion never transpired; gentle and considerate it was sure to be, even though a negative; and so the Doctor regarded it, remaining to the last her firm friend, the gossips being none the wiser, and Lucy no loser. Mr. Marsh never went back to South Street. He and his old servants remained at the Tower, which underwent con siderable enlargement towards the hill, to provide extra ac commodation for an ample household and a young family. Over the former Martin and Nancy held dominion undis puted. They had truly earned their position as \"good and faithful servants,\" and if they had a tendency to regard their young mistress as a \"bairn,\" it was a weakness to be cher ished not rebuked. She owed life, and love, and happiness to their shrewdness, zeal, and promptitude. Eva was Lady Raeburn. Frank's long kept secret, revealed when first her proud husband led her forth a convalescent one bright spring day, was simply the prosecution of his claim to a dormant baronetcy. He had returned, flushed with success, to find all which made rank or life desirable gone, torn from him ; but then, under the shadow of the budding trees, with renewed hope, and love intensified, he gazed upon her return ing loveliness, and saluted her as \" Lady Raeburn.\" She was somewhat less sprightly and frolicsome than of yore, and ill-natured people said that her title had made her proud ; but they knew nothing of Eva's heart. Sir Francis himself would have been better pleased had she evinced more satisfaction at the \"My Lady,\" which palpably irked her, or had she more readily taken her appointed place in the society he deemed her so fitted to grace. He longed to show the world the jewel he possessed. She"], [417, "THE FALL OF THE CURTAIN. 405 preferred a stroll with him, a romp on the lawn with her father and her little ones, or a visit to her old pensioners, to the most stately drawing-room, in which she ever shrank to nothingness. Town life distracted her, but at home or in Raeburn Vil lage, seconding her husband's active benevolence, she was in her true element, and so Sir Francis was compelled to confess. He had not been idle. His active co-operation had been given to the Act by which the Legislature prohibited female labour in mines. He repudiated the old system of paying by deputy in a beer-house ; discountenanced cock-fighting, dog-fighting, and cuddy-racing; supplied a reading-room with books and a school-room with a teacher; encouraged lec tures on practical subjects; protested against the iniquity of resigning to inexperienced boys \u2014 mere medical apprentices \u2014 the charge of hundreds of human lives ; took care that no deficient water supply should be an excuse for dirt or disorder; pro vided against the accumulation of filth and garbage in the street; and saw that the Wesleyan and Ranter were not left to labour by themselves in the spiritual field, but were sup plemented by an offshoot from the Established Church. These well-directed efforts had borne fruit : intelligence made way : rags, dirt, drunkenness, and inhumanity slowly shrank into corners or died a natural death. Yet, notwithstanding all that the seven years had accomplished, there was still work for Sir Francis, and for his son after him. CHAPTER L. THE FALL OF THE CURTAIN. In spite of her reluctance, Sir Francis bore his wife to Town occasionally during the season, and when their eldest boy, Frank, was a curly-headed urchin some six years old, he"], [418, "406 STUNG TO THE QUICK. accompanied them on a special occasion \u2014 an occasion he remembers to this day. Captain Hesketh, part owner of the vessel he commanded had put into the port of London; Edwin Grove made it the excuse for a wedding trip, Sir Francis and Lady Raeburn timing their annual visit to join the party. Eva's countenance, and that of Mary, had done much to ele vate Lucy, not only mentally and morally, but in Edwin's good opinion ; and on the whole their marriage commenced with as promising an augury for happiness as falls to the lot of ordinary couples. Lucy's discipline had been sharp and severe; Mr. Edwin's potion not over palatable. Social intercourse was varied by public entertainments and amusements. The young Queen held a drawing-room, and Eva, who had been \" presented \" three years previously, complied with her husband's wish to attend, although her liking for state and ceremony was not greater than in her girlhood. Lucy was not so changed that the consequent \" shopping \" was uncongenial to her ; but envy had died out, and when she and Mary watched Lady Raeburn, in a robe of azure satin enriched with pearls, on her way towards the carriage, leaning on the arm of Sir Francis, they united with her husband in the unspoken thought \" her loveliness increases ! \" The exigencies of his profession called the bridegroom home at an early day. Yet before their departure a party was arranged for the opera. A new cantatrice, who had long been the delight of continental cities, was driving the London musical world to the verge of lunacy ; and curiosity, if nothing more, impelled the friends to spend their last evening together in witnessing the wonder, who was pronounced equally great whether as actress or vocalist. Portraits of Mdlle. Adele Merone graced the windows of music-shops, differing in feature and expression with the character pourtrayed and the skill of the artist. Critics and cliques extolled her talent, rivals depreciated her, managers were driven to despair. Her wit, her beauty, her"], [419, "THE FALL OF THE CURTAIN. 407 carriage were themes for pen and press; bouquets, with jewels in their midst, were showered in her path ; courtly gallants hovered in her train ; lordlings laid their coronets at her feet, and offers, whose lightest suggestion was degradation, swarmed like hornets around her. A rumour was afloat that an English peer, who, infatuated by the siren, had followed her from city to city, to bask in her loveliness, and dare repeated rejection, had been accepted sud denly; that he had offered fabulous sums to cancel her engage ment with the management; that the stage would give a viscountess to the peerage, the opera lose its sweetest melodist. The very difficulty to obtain tickets in all probability stimu lated the desire to procure them ; but it also operated against little Frank's desire to be of the party. \" Operas are not for little boys, \" said mamma. \" You would not understand a word, Franky, \" added papa. \" I'm afraid there will be more than Franky in that predica ment, \" laughed out Captain Hesketh. \" If that is to stand as an argument, Mary and I have no more ears for the opera than he. How do you feel, Edwin?\" \" Equally disqualified. \" Mamma smiled. Frank sidled up to papa, put a little soft hand within his, and looked up coaxingly, with Eva's eyes, saying, \" I can see, papa, if I cannot understand. \" Papa was won over; Eva made a feeble resistance, arguing against late hours ; but masculine voices carried the day, and Master Raeburn found himself, in white trousers and a dark blue velvet tunic, glorious with braid and buttons, the following evening at his mother's knee, in front of their box, staring with all a child's wonder at the circle of chandeliers, the boxes rising tier above tier, the long row of flaring foot-lights, and the large dusty green curtain which seemed to hide a mystery from curious eyes. The overture to \" Norma \" began, overpowering the rustling of dresses, the murmur of voices, the shuffling of feet, as new comers took their places. As its last vibration died away the"], [420, "408 STUNG TO THE QUICK. curtain slowly rose; a group of white-robed druids drew nearer to the foot-lights to inaugurate their mystic rites with a solemn chorus. Then at the head of a long procession, side by side with the arch-druid, walked the glorious cantatrice, Mdlle. Merone, the priestess Norma! A burst of spontaneous applause rang through the house \u2014 such a reception only accorded to a wonder or a favourite \u2014 and was acknowledged by the slightest of slight inclinations of the head. Mdlle. Merone, imbued with the spirit of her part, would not descend to recognise more palpably the enthusiastic greeting of her audience. Amidst the applause a stir in any one direction would have been unheard; but when the audience, hushed to breathless attention, and the magnificent voice of the Norma swelled to the roof and floated like a melodious vapour to every rift and crevice, an unusual commotion in one of the side-boxes, preceded by a sharp exclamation, palpably attracted and annoyed the listening auditory. A low \" hush-sh \" evinced the general displeasure ; glasses were levelled at the offending party; an aristocratic man in the opposite stage-box demanded \" silence \" in peremptory tones. And there was silence. Norma's voice stopped on a half note; her face white as ashes beneath the rouge. There had been a mutual recognition ! Years of triumph were annihilated in an instant; the wreath of victory dropped its blighted leaves; a pall woven by jealousy and revenge, in the long past, fell like doom over the priestess Norma; scorn and shame pointed their mocking fingers in her face, and there she stood appalled. One moment only. Gathering up strength, as with an agonising grip, the Rhoda of old time hurled a glance of hatred and defiance on her self-elected foes, and with a signal to the orchestra resumed her interrupted theme, unfalteringly, surpassingly grand ; mistress of herself and of her art. The audience, blissfully ignorant, kindly misinterpreted her glance, and expressed their approbation as heartily as so sub-"], [421, "THE FALL OF THE CURTAIN. 409 limed an audience might ; with just the suggestion of a hiss to mark aversion to interruption. What, then, had Rhoda seen ? She had not heard one of the ejaculations which claimed acquaintance with Mdlle. Merone by a more familiar name : nor had she seen the eager heads bent forward to assure the fact of her identity, nor the first movements of the excited group ; her attention was attracted too late for that. But at one sweep her eyes took in, as only experienced stage eyes can, the full force of all that box contained, in combination and relation, individually and united. Lucy, whom she had left to shame, was there, a bride, as her garb betokened, there, side by side with Eva and Mary, the pure in thought and deed, who had upheld her against the world? There, with Edwin Grove's hand pressed on her bare shoulder in the eagerness of the moment, as only a husband's hand dare rest. She had separated them, rejected him, and there they were! \u2014 husband and wife. There, too, Cuthbert and Mary*. Well, she had no deep hate to spare for them. But there, there, to blast her jealous sight, a fair-haired boy looked down upon her with Eva's eyes and winning smile, but Raeburn stamped upon the nose and brow. Their child, Frank Raeburn's son! Had his throat been in her grip she could have strangled him ! She saw the beseechingly upturned face of Eva, her entreating hand upon her husband's arm, but she also saw the same fierce resolution in Frank's bearing and expression she had witnessed at their last stormy interview. She had not forgiven, nor had he! Between the acts two cards were handed to the prima donna, who had that night surpassed herself, \" Sir Francis Raeburn,\" \" Captain Hesketh.\" She crushed the bits of paste board in her hand. \"I am fatigued \u2014 I cannot see them,\" was her haughty answer to the messenger."], [422, "410 STUNG TO THE QUICK. \"The gentlemen are most desirous to speak with you,\" said the messenger, returning. \"I am not at liberty. I cannot be disturbed.\" The messenger went back. \" Who are those persons, Adele, so pertinaciously requiring an interview ? \" inquired Viscount Greville, her accepted adorer (the same who had demanded \" silence \" from the stage-box). \" Oh ! a rejected admirer of mine and his friend, whom I happened to meet years ago on the Continent. Were I to receive all the fellows who send in cards, I should have no leisure for study or duty ; and now, my lord, I owe it to you to be more than ever circumspect,\" Before his lordship could acknowledge the delicate compli ment, the messenger again entered the green-room. \"The gents will not go away, mademoiselle; they insist on seeing you; and one of them looks as if he meant it, too. He told me to give you this,\" handing another card, on which were pencilled a few hasty lines. She tore the pasteboard into tatters. \" I can see no strangers here. One word is as good as twenty,\" and her breath came and went with a pant, as she struggled to keep her passion down, her terror out of sight. \"Shall I, my Adele, see these impertinent intruders for you? I should be delighted to save you from annoyance.\" \" No, no. Return to your box, there's a good creature. I am in no mood to see anyone \u2014 not even you. The inter ruption to-night has quite discomposed me. Do leave me, or I will not\u2014 there's the call-boy. I must go.\" This colloquy had been carried on at one end of the greenroom, whilst other members of the company came and went, or sauntered to and fro, adjusting a wig or a robe before the looking-glass, humming snatches of their parts, bic kering with each other, or complimenting in words like daggers. The great songstress, courted and envied, held aloof haughtily even now. With her whole soul writhing in inde scribable pain, with a thousand conflicting emotions strug-"], [423, "THE FALL OF THE CURTAIN. 411 gling for the mastery, with shame before her, conscience behind, ambition underfoot, she answered to the call\u2014 no Mdlle. Adele Merone, but Rhoda in her heart, Norma in dress and bearing. Who, that gazed and listened with eyes and ears entranced to that charmed voice, dreamed that from her own struggling soul were torn the emotions of the ideal Norma? Who, in the final chorus round the devoted priestess, heard the requiem of the singer? Only the previous week had the \" Court Journal \" startled her with Lady Francis Raeburn's name and costume amongst others at the drawing-room. The Viscount had an eye for beauty, and he had extolled the fair lady in azure and pearl. To that he owed his acceptance. Lauded as she was, great as her musical fame, wealthy as her art had made her, she was stung to find that Eva entered society from which she was excluded. To be Mrs. Raeburn had been her own highest dream. Eva, supplanting her in love, had sup planted her in life \u2014 Lady Raeburn ! Viscountess Greville would precede my Lady Raeburn. The child of the \" beggar \" should rank higher than her rival; and so, without an atom of love for the man, she promised to marry the infatuated peer. Lapse of time had brought imaginary security, no thought that past misdeeds would track her now had shadowed her ambitious future. She had buried Rhoda seven years back; could others have embalmed the memory so long? She who had been stung to the quick by a school-girl's taunt, she who had nursed revenge for fancied slight, she who had waited years to crown with crime the jealousy and hate born of imaginary wrong \u2014 surely she might have given an injured man credit for bitter feelings far more natural. But others' wrongs she had not seen, her own obscured them. From forgetful security she had been that night aroused, her sin had foimd her out, her every scheme had been a failure ; her last refuge, marriage under a changed name, was at the mercy of her former victims. Eva looked gentle and forgiving, but in the face of Sir Francis she read a fateful volume \u2014 deep, stern deter-"], [424, "412 STUNG TO THE QUICK. mination to have justice meted out, Mosaic justice. Justice on one who had wronged the being dearer than himself, and caused him to echo that wrong in his own unjust suspicions. Oh ! the intensity of love for his young wife that face of wrath disclosed! It tortured her to think of it. But she would brave it out, evade him, or deny her own identity and scorn his threats. Surging through mind and brain, in a tumultuous flood of incoherent thought and passion, all emotions of her life seemed to commingle and threaten to overwhelm her reason. Yet her indomitable will rose above all; she vowed to con quer fate. With rising pulse she noted the anxious looks and whisperings of Eva and Mary as their husbands' absence was prolonged, and felt the dogged pertinacity it boded. Yet her voice rose clear and full; not one false note betokened the strife within, not a gesture told the woman had passions and feelings apart from the actress. The effort was Titanic, it carried her to the climax of the last scene, might have carried her through; but a change of position almost at the last moment revealed Sir Francis, with folded arms and compressed lips, waiting at the oppo site wing; with Cuthbert, flushed, restless, and impatient, close beside him. Her own revengeful spirit was interpreter for them; they had hunted her down, brought her to bay at last; her for tune had deserted her, there was no escape now, no vanish ing by an unwatched door, no avoiding accusation or the Viscount's presence. He was shaking hands with Sir Francis at the wing; shame, exposure, infamy, these awaited her as certainly as the plaudits of the admiring crowds before her ! Wrought to a pitch of intense excitement, she personated Norma grandly, magnificently to the last. But the mental and physical strain had been too great. With the final notes of liquid melody came bubbling up a crimson stream in quick conti nuous flow and checked her utterance. Rhoda's fierce passions had overmastered her, a blood vessel was ruptured."], [425, "THE FALL OF THE CURTAIN. 413 Bouquets and the green curtain fell together, but no \"Norma\" responded smilingly to the enthusiastic \"call.\" In Mdlle. Merone's own dressing-room, surrounded by all the paraphernalia of her profession, paint and powder, rouge-pot and hare's-foot, tiring-pins and opera scores, bou quets and billet-doux, satin shoes and stage coronets, bottled stout and sparkling jewels, costumes for the night and street attire for the day, Rhoda lay, purpling Norma's robe with every gasping breath. Love was there \u2014 for on Lord Greville's breast her head was pillowed, his arm surrounded her. Friendship was there \u2014 in her companion Miss Talbot. Skill was there \u2014 for Edwin Grove, hastily summoned, strove to stanch the hae morrhage, and the Viscount's own physician gave his aid. Compassion, too, was there, and Charity ; for Eva and her friends had followed Edwin's steps ; and Eva saw before her not the murderess bent on her destruction, but the Rhoda she had loved, ghastly in her paint, and dying. All wrath, all animosity, whether in the heart of Sir Francis, or Cuthbert, or Lucy, faded out in the dread presence of the coming King. Eva, with trembling Franky clinging to her skirts, knelt at Rhoda's side, assuring her of forgiveness long accorded, praying and hoping she had as long repented of the evil done. That was no time to ask for explanation ; but the Viscount looked amazed, and well he might. Rhoda's name and Rhoda's life were mysteries to him. Vine\u00b0ar, sulphuric acid, all remedies attainable had been employed; but nothing stayed the welling of that ruddy fountain. Removal was impossible \u2014 quiet imperative, and that could not be had. There was a hush within the room ; the noise and bustle and activity of the theatre seemed subdued to a \"hum; \" but the quiet of the soul was wanting; the tumult was in Rhoda's heart, and baffled the physician. Despite commands, she strove for speech. Her eye had singled Raeburn out and drawn him forward."], [426, "STUNG TO THE QUICK. 414 \" I thought you came to crush me,\" she gasped out. \" To interrogate, not prosecute. Eva had successfully pleaded for mercy, and not justice, years ago. If your sight rekindled ire, her gentle influence subdued it.\" \"Only Eva to the last,\" came in faint murmurs. Then her hand sought that of Sir Francis ; she signed for him to stoop, and whispered brokenly; but the stricken lord, whose arm and bosom held her then, heard every stinging syllable. \" Frank, \u2014 for you \u2014 I \u2014 sinned \u2014 I loved \u2014 you \u2014 madly. Do \u2014 you \u2014 for \u2014 give me ? \" \"Yes!\" She had washed out his wrath with her own blood She sank exhausted. Edwin and the physician both urged calm. His lordship whispered a like entreaty to \"his Adele,\" though his own heart beat tumultuously. Awhile she lay quiet, red beads dropping from her white lips, her ghastly face more ghastly from the rouge upon the cheeks. Cuthbert, at a signal from Sir Francis, turned to withdraw from the painful scene frightened little Franky, his own weeping wife, and Lucy. The movement roused the sinking woman. She raised her head ; unquenchable vindictiveness shone in her eyes, passion thrilled in her voice, thin and weak though it fell. \" Lucy Hesketh \u2014 I hate \u2014 you ! You stung me \u2014 to the quick. I'll \u2014 live to \u2014 sting \u2014 you \u2014 yet! I will!\" No need of restraining hands to force her back ; no neces sity for styptics or for doctors now; that last passionate word brought its own penalty: the King had come! That dusty curtain, which never rises for another act or for another play, had fallen \u2014 fallen before Norma and her triumph, Rhoda and her revenge. Her own undisciplined passions had Stung her to the Quick. THE END. PRINTED AT NIMEGUEN (HOLLAND) BY H. C. A. TH1EME OF MMEGUEN I HOLLAND) AND TALBOT HOUSE, ARUNDEL STREET, LONDON, W. C."], [427, "APPENDIX. CHAPTER I. The sequestered \"Count's Cottage\" was long the residence of the some what celebrated Polish dwarf, Count Borulaski, one of a large family of which every second child was a pigmy. He was a refugee, and under noble patronage (having lost all his property in Poland) exhibited himself to fash ionable crowds. The admission was one guinea a head. Towards the close of his career his \" reception\" fee had dropped to one shilling. With the proceeds he retreated to Durham, and there died at a great age in Sep tember, 1837. CHAPTER V. The Ecclesiastical Court and the Count Palatine. Mr. Marsh did not travel so much beyond his record in his conference with Mrs. Hesketh, as in these days (1881) may be thought. Fifty years ago the Ecclesiastical Court had, or was supposed to have, extraordinary powers, not the least being its power to deal sharply with \"defamation of character,\" punishment, however, being rather inflicted on the purse than the person. As Bishop of Durham, and Count Palatine in one, William Van Mildert held both the spiritual and temporal sword ; and if in the lapse and changes of centuries the latter began to look rusty, it had not been sheathed or broken by the sovereign paramount when Mrs. Hesketh was made to tremble at its shadow; although Bishop Van Mildert was the last Count Palatine of Durham. It is well known that there are only three Counties Palatine, viz. Chester, conferred on Hugh Lupus by William the Conqueror; Lancashire, by Edward III. upon his son John o* Gaunt; and Durham, held by some pre scriptive right coeval, at least, with that of Chester. All noblemen were Counts (companions of the King), but Counts Palatine had special privileges and jurisdiction. As defined by Hutchinson the historian, \" They had power to levy taxes for the defence and service of the palatinate, and to make truces with enemies ; to raise troops, and impress ships, for war. They sat in judgment of life and death, and could inflict funishment even to extremity. They had power to create barons, who dared not disobey their summons; and most of the lands within the liberty were held of them as lords in capite. They could coin money, grant licences to embattle castles, build churches, found chantries and hospitals, could institute corporations by charter, which were legal without the interference of the Crown, and gTant markets and fairs, &c, &c. They could confiscate, for the purposes of the see, the lands and properties of treasonable nobles. They had all manner of royal juris diction, both civil and- military, by land and by water, and appointed officers by patent for every department The King could not interfere with them, nor send writs within their liberty without their sanction.\" CHAPTER XLI. As not only play-goers but the general public are tolerably familiar with an escape from an ivied tower, in the popular drama of \"Arrah-na-pogue,\" the former through stage representation, the latter through the medium of extensively exhibited coloured prints, it is just possible that I might be classed with the tribe of literary pirates, and that, too, as one who added folly to knavery, by appropriating a scene readily recognised. In order to avoid so undeserved an imputation, it becomes a duty I owe both to myself and to my readers to state that the germ of the present"], [428, "APPENDIX. story was a brief Christmas sketch written for the Durham Chronicle in the winter of 1863; the escape of Eva from the Tower being the main incident. Consequently, the tale (then called the \"Waif of the Wear\") was published about eighteen months prior to the production of \" Arrah-na-pogue,\" and may, or may not, have suggested his wonderfully effective scene to the clever dramatist. I may here observe, for the benefit of those who might think the feat impossible, that the Tower, with some few slight deviations. has its well-known prototype, once my own residence, and that the scene was suggested to me by a positive occurrence, namely, the ascent of a burly youth of sixteen or seventeen (whom my little son dubbed \" Milky,\" from his call ing) to procure a bird's nest for the child. \" Milky\" certainly did not mount to the battlements, but he did climb to a dizzy height, and, notwithstanding his weight, came back in safety with his prize. The foregoing note is simply a re-production of a foot-note introduced in the original edition (1867). But as at that time one or two critics, who otherwise gave me all credit for \"power\" and \"ability,\" suggested that in Rhoda I had \"created a demon,\" and that she and her scheme to rid herself of Eva were alike improbabilities, I think it as well to state here, as I answered one of these in his own paper, that in the first place Rhoda is not \"a creation\" but a representation, a life-portrait, in fact. The incidents and situations are undoubtedly my own, suggested in a great measure by the Tower, with its remote turret-room and scenic surroundings. But were I to give the true career of the real Rhoda, it would be quite as romanticr quite as incredible, and a little more wicked. The actual woman possessed two vices at which I have not so much as hinted. In the second place the incarceration of Eva has had several parallels in real life. One in 1865 of a young woman kept in a state of filth, nudity, and famine by her own sister for many years, undiscovered; at or near Wolver hampton, another, where two brothers shut a third up in a fress-bed, and kept him there for months before either the suspicions or interference of neighbours caused his release ; and about the time my story was in the press, a child was so \"done to death\" in London, in a house filled \"from garret to basement\" with other tenants. I wrote, as I thought, to prove the evils of evil speaking, gossip, and slander ; that one ill word might mar a life \u2014 like a bit of grit in a delicate machine \u2014 throw it out of order and work incalculable mischief. If I have failed to do this I have missed my aim. It only remains for me to add that I have considerably antedated the erection of the Tower, which had no existence when this story opens, I have, moreover, slightly extended the area of its grounds, and ignored (also for the purposes of my story) the construction of the New North Road, which has been cut through those lovely and romantic grounds, and runs at the very foot of the Tower, the now common highway, superseding the old North Road, the only one open to the Signor's phaeton. Our chief inducement to become tenants of the Tower was its uncanny reputation as a \" haunted\" dwelling, our experience having gone to prove that ghosts have the discrimination to select wonderfully comfortable quarters. It was certainly an eerie spot in winter, when the waterfall was in force, but we must have exorcised the ghosts \u2014 we never saw them.
