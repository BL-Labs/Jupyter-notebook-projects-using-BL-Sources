Her loved companion, maid Cyane, attempting to arrest her capture, was suddenly transformed into a fountain by the all-powerful robber. Ah, once the life-blood curdled in this heart Roved with a full-toned tide that drew delight From all Earth's meadows, when my life's glad part Took joy from Enna ! Clouds that overwhelm, Darkening all colour to my changed sight, Passed not before me.

To me a boy my father gave a plot Of garden ground, which I did tend so well, Weeding and watering with a thrifty care, That in the summer, lo ! a blush of flowers. And I remember how one summer-time There came to us for holidays from school My cousin Annie. Orphan child she was, And the few years that her young life had seen Had brought some joys, but taken more away. Her first sweet birthday gave a mournful gloom ; For when my cousin, with blue baby eyes, Looked in large wonder on the sunlight round, Her mother saw the Day-star in the heavens. And only she remained to heal the wound In a dear father's side : who, for her sake Living, and smiling sometimes, sorrowful, Nine years did bear his grief within his heart \u2014 Then both were buried in that wife's calm grave,"], [27, "COUSIN ANNIE. 13 And Annie had a guardian : one of those Stern thick-browed men who have no eyes for aught That shows not in the mirror of the world.

My mother was his sister ; him we called Our Bluebeard uncle. Well, when Annie came, Wearing a girlhood shining with a dower Of sparkling graces, ah ! I loved her straight Because of that sweet face and kindly look \u2014 Altho' my mother laughed, and said, ' Because Your cousin's two years older than yourself The summer loved dear Annie ; for the flowers Came out to greet her with their thousand smiles And every morning from the garden plot I took choice lilies, tying nosegays sweet With pink and pansy, mignonette and rose. And she would wear them in her breast, and I \u2014 Would wish the tourney days were come again ! Oh ! all my dreams were full of prancing steeds, Gay lists, and tents with curtains blazoned fair, All gold-embroidered, belted by glad crowds That shouted triumph as a knight rode in Astride a charger white as maiden snow, With eyes like rubies flashing fiery stars. A steed, men whispered, not another knight"], [28, "COUSIN ANNIE. 14 S Nor living man in Christendom could ride.

By Hercules! that knight \u2014 'twas I myself! And gentle Annie \u2014 she was Beauty's Queen. Ah, well ! I was but fourteen, and I dreamed. Once more 'twas June : our cousin came again Before I went to college ; flowers as erst Were blooming fair, but Annie more than they. Alas ! I had grown shy ; I who was wont To make her blush with boyish compliment, Now seldom spoke or walked with her alone ; Could scarcely see her but my face would flush, Could never touch her hand without a thrill.

At Evesham, in a grand old hall he lived, That hard-eyed guardian ; all the place was full Of varied beauty, from the shaded walks And matchless gardens to the antique rooms.

There sister Graces rung the chimes of Art. Within the carved rooms, richly wainscoted, Were gathered glorious sculptures, and the lore Of learned libraries exceeding rare : A gallery of pictures, too, warm breaths Of life on canvas \u2014 there the eye shall see A score of paintings, each a mine of thought, And opening views of poetry and God.

Well, well, he asked next If I would speak to Annie, 'for a whim, A foolish whim, had seized her, that to wed The man she loved not was a hateful thing.' \" All women have their fancies, and she hers.\" Saying, \" I take it, if that famous jade, That Grecian Helen, had been tamed aright, No broil had been to nations, and a minx Would not have led them such a pretty dance.

It appeared that the deceased was the honest and well-conducted wife of a seafaring man now on a voyage to Melbourne in the ship Hampshire. Her only income, on which she had to support herself and a large family, was \u00a32 5s. per month. In consequence of sickness and other family troubles, she often spent her little money before the end of the month, and to enable her to get food for the children she had to pledge some of the small articles of her scanty home or to run credit. A week or so ago she obtained an old skirt from a Mrs. Bates, who was her landlady, to whom she was to pay 3s. as best she could. The poor creature with some exertion paid 2s. ; and on Monday last Bates, accompanied by a man, called upon the deceased for the remaining shilling. Not possess ing the money, and knowing the violent character of Bates and her friend, deceased at first feigned being out ; but in consequence of the dis turbance which Bates and the man created at the house, she made her appearance and promised to try and raise the money. Later in the day Bates and her companion called upon deceased again, and after abusing her, only left the house on the understanding that the deceased was to raise the money and bring it to the Horn of Plenty Tavern, where they were to remain. The poor creature then took the shoes from off some of the children's feet and pawned them, and took the money as promised. Trembling and crying bitterly, she exclaimed before Bates and in the hearing of several witnesses that she could bear her troubles no longer, and that she would kiss her dear children once more and then drown herself. She then left much agitated, and was not seen afterwards until dragged from the West India Docks quite dead.

If you propose to throw him At wrestling \u2014 why, he backs out with excuses ; The man who used to pride himself on bruises Now seems to think the slightest knock would kill him. His liver's sound, the fellow's tough enough ; But, Nora, you have made Jack such a muff!"], [175, "161 TO DISMAL JAMES. Book II., Ode u. Scraping and toiling, your face Is enough to drive a man frantic. Why look forward so much ? Why try To compress the whole world in a sigh, And span with your fears the Atlantic ? You allow, John, that life is a race Soon run : well, then, little's required. Youth and beauty pass quickly away, Age eclipses love's pleasant heyday, And makes us sleep poorly when tired. We must change, then, it seems, like the flowers Of spring, or the light of the moon. 'Tis kismet; but wherefore revolve Deep problems you never can solve ? A nd why pipe to so doleful a tune ? While here, let us press from the hours All their joys \u2014 you call them, John, folly. Though India's not England, you see, My friend, an old buffer like me Thrives tolerably well and is jolly.

Mother-in-law that wouldstbe, spare me a bachelor, spare me ! I am not what I was, to fetch and carry for ladies. Love is it you would instil in an old cock close upon fifty ? Go, there are boys who will pray you to mother-in-law them for ever ; Go with daughters twain, and conquer a youthful Col- lector. Robinson \u2014 he is the man, inflammable, sportive, and handsome, Fond of returning thanks to the oft-drank toast of \"The Ladies.\" He can dance, sing, paint, and loves to play the piano. Let him come to the front, and soon will rise up a rival. Robinson rivals brings, who'll bring you many a pre- sent ; Then he will laugh and win, and \u2014 find you a home at Geneva ; Close to the bright blue lake, or a cottage Swiss in the Tyrol."], [178, "TO A WOULD-BE MOTHER-IN-LAW. 164 There you shall have fresh air and sounds of the hurdy-gurdy, Incense-breathing pines, and the music of Tyrolese maidens. Lads and lasses will dance, if you pay them, morning and evening, Dance, and be glad of the coin, to the mother-in-law from Mussooree. Me tho' woman nor youth, nor the hope of an ardent attachment, Suppers at night (or rather at one o'clock in the morn- ing), Button-hole posies, or gloves, or boots of the shiniest leather, Please as of old : ah, no ! but at times I sigh in my armchair, Sometimes silence will hold my tongue, which is otherwise fluent. Nightly in dreams I clasp \u2014 ah, what ? 'Tis a phan- tom, a shadow, Flying across Hyde Park, cold shade of one who was cruel.
