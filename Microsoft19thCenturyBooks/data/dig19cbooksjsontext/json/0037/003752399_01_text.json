N\" A T U R E has implanted in us a kind of ambi- tion, which, sometimes assisted by the importuni ties of friends, as soon as our thoughts are enlarged from the bounds of the mind, suggests to us a most prevailing inclination of ushering them into the world, tho' they are not always decorated with the most engaging dress. Some critics, I make no doubt, will immediately censure me in the severest terms for having obeyed the dictates of this inclination, alledging, that I ought to have kept to myself these productions, which, after some years had elapsed, I should think unworthy of the press, as far unequal to works of more perfection. To these I answer, in the words of a celebrated Poet, that it is an envious frost which nips the blossoms in their bud, and that it is a ridiculous absurdity to despise the moon and the stars, because the fun shines brighter. Works"], [10, "[ iv ] Works of this kind are generally soon buried in obli vion ; and I must be very partial to myself and conceited to expect a better sate than others whose blossoms were perhaps more approaching to maturity : however in this I comfort myself : \" Me vivo, moriere, liber, sortasse : quid inde ? \" S\u00e6pe fenem moritur silius ante patrem. \" Seu moriare igitur vivo me, ilve superstes \" Sis mihi ; mortalem me genuisse scio.
