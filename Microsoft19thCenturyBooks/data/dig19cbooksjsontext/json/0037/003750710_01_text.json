Jupiter, enraged at the vanity of the request, condemned him to sleep for a period of thirty years.

Let those, on whom sweet nature frowns, Seek fresh delights beyond the sea ; While I contented stay at home, And find each day new charms in thee."], [219, "AUTUMNAL LEAVES. 197 'Twas thou beheld'st each grace expand, And taught me with such magic art, To speak the language of the eyes, And act the fair Adonis' part. Whiskers, mustachios, finely turn'd, Owe their superior charms to thee : How worthless were this foolish world, Wert thou not here, mon vrai ami !"], [220, "198 AUTUMNAL LEAVES. A TERRIBLE BORE. That Astrologers, learn'd in all future events, Should omit one so great, is surprising- to me; They can tell when the Moon and the Planets will change, But they none of them tell what the fashion will be. Not that I wish to know; let it be as it may : It never can make me as young as before : There are now quite enough in its changeable train : For my own part, I think it a terrible bore. Now there's nothing in vogue but the new Figurantes, The last published novel, and song of the day ; And if fashion continue much longer to reign, E'en reason itself will be banished away."], [221, "199 AUTUMNAL LEAVES. If you meet with some friends as you're walking along, Should they happen to be in a carriage and four, They will toss up their heads with disdain as they pass ; Which all must acknowledge a terrible bore. Oh! those days of delight! \u2014 will they never return, (Has the star of refinement eclips'd their bright noon?) When lovers could sing, without being called Goths, A sweet serenade by the light of the moon? Then there's Valentine's Day : I remember the time When I used to receive some three dozens or more ; Some with roses and doves, and words full of love : \u2014 Now is not this fashion a terrible bore."], [222, "200 AUTUMNAL LEAVES. A NONSENSICAL EPISTLE If Nonsense is thought a nonsensical theme, Yet its origin merits narration ; It's a minister surely entitled to fame, When it governs best part of the nation ; It is Nonsense to dangle a filagree fan When the folks on the river are skating ; T would be Nonsense to lose a rich husband at church, For the fashion of keeping him waiting. It is Nonsense to see how some people set up For Grandees without any pretensions ; 'Twould be Nonsense to make Don Santos* a coat Without first having taken dimensions; * Don Santiago de los Santos, the Spanish Dwarf, now exhibiting in London."], [223, "201 AUTUMNAL LEAVES. 'Tis Nonsense to wear a fur tippet and muff Cloak and clogs on a beautiful May-day ; 'Tis Nonsense to see an old woman drest up, To look like a blooming young lady. 'Twould be Nonsense to talk of reforming the laws, To a gambler who's always a winner; 'Tis Nonsense to bring out Sauterne and Champaign, To a man who can not get a dinner ; 'Tis Nonsense to hear of the Saturday's routs, As though they could give them but one day ; Nay, 'tis more, when we learn by the newspaper puffs, That the dancing encroaches on Sunday. 'Tis Nonsense to see what distinctions are made, Between grades \u2014 when there's money in question, And to mark what an air of contempt they put on, If by chance they behold a pedestrian ; 'Tis Nonsense to hold forth a rival in charms, To one who's considered a beauty ;"], [224, "202 AUTUMNAL LEAVES. It is Nonsense to pay certain persons so much, When others are doing their duty. 'Tis Nonsense proposing to waltz or quadrille With a being beset with the vapours ; 'Tis Nonsense to boast about crossing the Alps, Just to lionize over your neighbours ; Then 'tis Nonsense for me any longer to prate About things that will never be mended ; And I find that my subject is threadbare almost, So 'tis time that this Nonsense be ended."], [225, "203 AUTUMNAL LEAVES. A CHAPTER OF SOMES. Some love the sun, and some the moon, And some the \" deep, deep sea ;\" Some build their skies in others eyes, And some will Stoics be ; Some two-legg'd donkeys may be seen Westward of Temple-bar, With high-heel'd boots, and low-crown'd hats, Bush'd whiskers, and cigar. Some love to range in search of change ; Some stay at home and die ; Some like to smile life's cares away, While others love to cry :"], [226, "204 AUTUMNAL LEAVES. Some are won, some sold, some worship gold ! Some rise while others fall : Many have hearts composed of stone, And some no heart at all. Oh ! could I find in life's dark book One clear unblotted page ; A heart that's warm, an eye that smiles, Alike in youth or age ; There would I pitch my tent of peace, By friendship wove together : And in this world, with all its faults, I'd wish to live for ever.
