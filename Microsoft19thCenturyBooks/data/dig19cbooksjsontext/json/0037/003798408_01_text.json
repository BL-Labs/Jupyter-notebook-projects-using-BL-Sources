As pure in thought as Angels are, To know her was to love her.' Samuel Rogers. ' WHAT a glorious day ! I do hope it will keep like this ! ' Ina Strong spoke these words out loud, stand ing by the open window in the dining-room of her father's house in Dean's Walk, Carswell, one summer morning in the month of June 1 88\u2014 . Ina was a very pretty girl indeed, with a mass of curly brown hair crowning her forehead, blue grey eyes, delicately pencilled eyebrows, a remarkably clear complexion, and a slim, elegant figure. She was the only child of the Rev. Philip Strong, Rector of St Mary's, Jessop Street, and Honorary Canon of the Cathedral, A"], [16, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 2 and was a person of no small importance in the quaint house in Dean's Walk. Not that Ina interfered in any way with the domestic arrangements of the establishment. She left all that to her mother, and very well Mrs Strong did it, too ; but she was the latter's pet and companion, while the servants made much of her. ' Miss Ina's wish ' was law to everyone. Her dresses, when it suited her, were 'built' by a tailor. If she had a fancy to have her room fresh papered or painted, it was done almost before she had time to express the wish. Ina Strong appreciated the pretty dresses, and the neat little pink and white bedroom upstairs, looking out into the quiet old fashioned garden, across the smooth lawn of which fell, of a summer's evening, the shadow of the great Cathedral spire. She appreciated these little luxuries all the more, too, because it had been her lot to know very different times to those she now enjoyed. For the first fourteen years of her life, Ina had lived in Staffordshire, in the heart of the Black Country, in the great ugly town of Walsall, where her father held a curacy. The Rev. Philip Strong was the scion of an impoverished Yorkshire family, and from the outset of his career had been hampered by a want of means. When but four-and-twenty, and"], [17, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 3 possessing, as assistant-master in a school, the large salary of \u00a3100 a year, he had married the lady of his choice \u2014 the penniless daughter of an old Peninsular officer. Twelve months, after- wards, he had been appointed to the curacy of St M \u2014 's, Walsall, and there for fifteen weary years he had struggled along on an income of \u00a3120 a year. The warfare, however, had been a bitter one, and it had left its mark upon him. And yet the Rev. Philip Strong was a clever man, and one who should have risen in his profession, had it not been for a fatal draw- back, namely, that he possessed none of those arts whereby other men rise. If he dined out, he never spoke more than a dozen words to the people sitting near him. After dinner he would shake his head, when pressed to fill his glass, and then would sit silent, as one who heard not, while the men round him talked and laughed. Even in his own home he rarely spoke. Now and then he would give utterance to some humorous thought, but such transient gleams of sunshine were rare indeed. And yet he was a man who in his own house played a large part. His wife was devoted to him, and he to her in his odd, silent way. It had been a love match, and, like so many love matches, an imprudent one. Then, too, they had gone through much together. At Walsall, there had"], [18, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 4 been times when things were grave with them indeed. And in those days, she had been good to him \u2014 good as only a woman can be. In her heart there had been a great terror at their position, but she had kept the terror out of sight, and when with him had been brave, and smiling, and confident. They had come through those troubled waters at last, and though, as I have said, they had left their mark upon him, still, in the knowledge he had thereby gained of his wife's affection for him, he considered it cheaply purchased. It was just when Ina was about fourteen that things had changed for the better. Mrs Strong had been very ill, and her husband, getting alarmed, did what hitherto in all their anxious hours he had obstinately refused to do \u2014 wrote and asked help of his distant cousin, the Rev. William Maycott, Archdeacon of Carswell. What Mr Strong suffered during those forty-eight hours, whilst he waited for a reply to his application, few can tell. He was a proud man, and the action had been painful beyond measure. Almost as soon as the letter had been posted, he repented of the deed. He had gone to the post-office, and tried to get it back, but the bag had been made up and the letter was already on its way to town. The clergyman had turned away from the"], [19, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 5 gossiping old clerk's explanation, and had gone out once more into the grimy, ugly street with a sick heart. He had done wrong, he told himself ; and in his wounded pride he had paced the streets of Walsall till long after the church steeples had proclaimed the hour of midnight. Mr Strong was alone in his study when the Archdeacon's answer came. He seized the envelope, and tore it roughly open, telling himself as he did so that it was a refusal. A slip of paper fell to the ground, and he picked it up \u2014 a cheque for \u00a350 ! Then he turned to the letter and read it. After that he went to the door and tried to call his wife, but failed. He was a big, strong man, nevertheless he was completely over come. He struck his great hand upon the study table as though angry at his own weakness, and then called ' Ellen ! ' And she had come quickly, fearing all manner of things, and had been startled to find her husband's arms about her. He was a man not much given to open demonstrations of affection ; but then he held her close, and kissed her again and again. ' You were right,' he said, ' as you always are. I did well to go to such a man in mine hour of need. Ellen, our troubles are"], [20, "6 CATHEDRAL BELLS. at end. My letter went at just the right moment. I am offered the living of St Mary's, Carswell. It is worth \u00a3600 a year, and is in the gift of the Chapter. The Archdeacon has used his influence in my behalf. Read what he says.' Mrs Strong took the letter. It was as follows : \u2014 ' The Close, Carswell, 'April ii\u2014 . 'My Dear Cousin, \u2014 I quarrel with you for writing so long a string of apologies. Know you not that our great - grandmothers were sisters, and to whom should a man turn in distress but to those of his own blood ?

'P.S. \u2014 My wife desires me to say that she looks forward to seeing Mrs Strong here.' The Archdeacon's letter had been the turn ing point. Since then things had gone well"], [21, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 7 with Philip Strong. He had come to Cars well, and was now able to sleep in peace when he lay down at night, since he had insured his life, and thus made provision for his wife and child. At the time, also, at which my story opens, he held, in addition to the living of St Mary's, Jessop Street, the post of History Lecturer at King Edward's College, and was also an Honorary Canon of the Cathedral. ' What a glorious day ! I do hope it will keep like this ! ' Again Ina said the words aloud, looking up, as she did so, at the cloudless blue sky overhead. The Dean had a garden-party that afternoon, and Ina was going to wear a new dress if it would only keep fine. Each day of the past week had dawned fair and beauti ful, and each afternoon it had changed and become cloudy and disagreeable. Who knew whether the clerk of the weather was not going to play just such another trick again? ' It was much too fine to stay indoors,' the girl thought, as she pushed the soft curly hair from off her forehead, and gazed up at a workman engaged at some dizzy height in repairing the masonry of one of the buttresses of the Cathedral. Bah ! it made"], [22, "8 CATHEDRAL BELLS. one giddy to look at him. If she went on staring, she felt he would fall. Ina turned, and leaving the room, crossed the hall and passed out into the quaint, old-fashioned garden. How still and peaceful it was that June morning, scarcely a sound to be heard save the cawing of the rooks far overhead as they circled round the pinnacles of God's great house. The air was heavy with the perfume of flowers, and the girl moved slowly along, noting lazily where she intended to come by and-by with her scissors and basket. There would be enough to fill all the vases in the drawing-room, over and above those required for the dinner-table. It would be time enough to cut them after luncheon. There was nothing to prevent her doing it at once, only she was rather tired just then, for Ina was not very robust. By-and-by the inspection was finished, and the girl, having reached the end of the garden, where a long, low basket chair was placed ready for her, seated herself therein, and listened to the chimes of the old Cathedral clock. After a bit the silvery tones ceased, and the great bell boomed forth its solemn tones \u2014 twelve. The mason at the giddy height stopped work, and disappeared. ' Dinner and a pipe,' Ina said to herself."], [23, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 9 The echo of the clock had died away, and there was nothing to be heard save the hum of the bees, the cawing of the rooks, and the sweet song of the birds. Ina felt that if she closed her eyes she would be asleep directly. She resisted the temptation, however, and contented herself with lying quietly back, enjoying the soft air. Half-an-hour went slowly by, and she was just going to rise when she beheld Martha, the parlour maid, at the drawing-room window, and directly afterwards a gentleman in deep mourn ing appeared behind her. The girl recognised the new-comer quickly enough. It was the Rev. James Romer, her father's curate, whose mother had only been buried the previous day. What was she to do ? The visitor came rather slowly across the lawn. He was a plain, insignificant - looking little man, with nothing very striking about him, except a pair of enormous feet, which Ina de clared he would one day fall over. The Curate was always a comic figure to look at, and that day he was even more so than usual. He was dressed, as I have said, in the deepest mourn ing, but the effect was marred by the fact that, as the roads were dusty, he had turned his trousers up, and consequently his low shoes and white cotton socks were, to say the least"], [24, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 10 of it, conspicuous. Everything about him was new, Ina noted, with one exception \u2014 he still carried his large dark green alpaca umbrella, and as the fastening had come Off, its elegance was not enhanced by the fact that he had slipped an elastic band over it as a temporary substitute till he could get his landlady to rectify it. She who had hitherto done these things for him, had gone away on a great journey. She would never sew the fastening on his umbrella again, or the buttons on his shirt. He had not seen Ina since she left him \u2014 had, indeed, seen no one till yesterday, when he had shaken hands with the Rector, who had read the funeral service. Ina rose slowly to meet the new-comer. She did not know in the least what to say to him. For a whole week, as I have said, no one had set eyes on him. When her father had called at the rooms in Jessop Street, the answer had always been the same, \u2014 ' If there was any question relating to the parish, would the Rector be so kind as to put it into writing ? ' Now the little man had probably come to see him, and yet why, oh ! why had Martha shown him out on to the lawn instead of into the study ? Mr Romer took the girl's outstretched hand"], [25, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 11 rather eagerly, but he did not speak. Some how, the sight of Ina seemed to bring all his loss back to him, though why it should it is difficult to say. Once in about a month the girl had been wont to call on the poor old lady who had gone away \u2014 away for evermore. Many times since Ina had heard of her death, she had felt sorry she had not been in the habit of going oftener. It had always been rather a bore. The little old lady \u2014 with her funny row of grey curls, her horn spectacles, and her plain black dress \u2014 had always been so very pleased to see her ; so eager, too, for her to remain, ' because \" James \" was sure to be back for tea. He'll be disappointed to miss you, my dear. He thinks a deal of you, honey.' Now, as Ina thought of all this, and her glance fell on the black figure before her, some thing rose in her throat, and the tears came into her eyes, though she was not one who usually showed her feelings. In spite of his turned - up trousers, white socks all in wrinkles, and the gamp-like umbrella, she recognised that she was in the presence of a great sorrow. She gave his hand a little extra pressure and looked away. 'I \u2014 I came to thank you,' he said. His voice was quite steady, but there was a"], [26, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 12 tremulous motion about his lower lip which told of a struggle within. ' You are the first person I have seen, except \u2014 except those yesterday. It was very good of your mother to come. I came to thank her. I could not then, you know.' 'Of course not,' Ina answered. 'Besides, why should you ? Mother liked to go. We were all very sorry when we heard of it,' lifting the blue-grey eyes for a moment as she spoke. She was very sorry for him \u2014 truly sorry. If there was anything in the world she could do for him, she would do it gladly ; but oh ! if he would only go ! The girl did not comprehend that by letting him stand there talking to her she was doing more than all the rest of the world could do for him. Ina knew, had known for ages. that, in the words of her girl friends in Carswell, the Rev. James Romer was smitten with her, but she hardly comprehended how completely smitten he really was. As a rule she was bored with him, and seized every opportunity of getting out of his way ; but every now and then his devotion touched her, and she could not help being kind and gentle to him. And on these occasions the little man would go home happy and contented."], [27, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 13 And James Romer? He had come to the Rectory that bright June morning because he could not stand the quiet sitting-room in Jessop Street any longer ; above all, could not stand the sight of the empty arm-chair. She for whom his heart was desolate had not been a clever woman,- \u2014 \u25a0 had, indeed, been quite the reverse, \u2014 but she had been his mother, and he had loved her. People in Carswell \u2014 the ill-natured ones, that is \u2014 had called her vulgar, but in this I think they were wrong. She had been the daughter of a small farmer, and it is true that now and then in conversation she had been wont to let slip an ' H ' ; but that was the extent of her vulgarity. She had been a good woman, had borne nobly the ills of poverty, and had kept the sacrifices she was com pelled to make out of sight. He for whom she had made such sacrifices knew full well her worth, and the love he had given her had been very great. And so, that morning of which I am writing, James Romer had come up to see the one being who could distract his thoughts from the little old woman who had left him only eight days before \u2014 only eight days ! Standing there in the quaint garden, with the rooks cawing loudly up among the"], [28, "14 CATHEDRAL BELLS. grey pinnacles of the Cathedral, and the scent of summer roses filling the air, the Curate was able to forget for a few minutes something of his great sorrow \u2014 something of those terrible things which accompany death, and which leave such a strong impression on one's upset nerves. Looking at the slim figure, every outline of which he knew so well, standing there before him in God's sun- light, he was able to put from him for the first time the recollection of the tramp, tramp of the bearers, and the muttered words of one of the men \u2014 just at the end \u2014 when she was really going, and when life seemed over \u2014 ' to twist that 'ere rope straight.' ' Do you want to see papa ? ' Ina asked at length, finding the poor Curate's gaze get ting a little embarrassing. ' I'm afraid he is out, but I can tell him anything \u2014 any message, you know.' ' Thank you \u2014 oh ! thank you very much,' he answered eagerly. He was always so over-polite, as Ina often complained. ' No, I haven't anything to say. I \u2014 I am a good boy and have a holiday to-day,' smiling a little at his feeble joke \u2014 it was the first he had made since it happened. ' Your father thought it would be better for me not to go back to parish work till to-morrow."], [29, "'DO YOU WANT TO SEE PAPA?' INA ASKED. Page 14."], [30, ""], [31, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 15 It is very kind and considerate, I am sure, but then he has been so all through, he and your mother and you. She liked the flowers you sent so very much. It was only the \u2014 only the last day she was too weak to notice them. I \u2014 I put those on her breast after it was all over,' working his square ugly fingers nervously together, and trying to steady his voice as he lifted his eyes to the girl's face for a moment. ' I am glad she liked them,' Ina answered. It was all she could think of to say. Oh ! if he would but go ! If the interview lasted much longer, she would end by having a bad headache, and be totally unfit for the Dean's garden-party. ' Oh ! yes \u2014 oh ! thank you \u2014 they were the greatest comfort to her. I can never forget it \u2014 your kindness, I mean. I ought not to come and weary you with my trouble, Miss Strong, but I hope you will forgive me. Yes, I am sure you will \u2014 it is just like you to be always kind,' trying to squeeze the large alpaca folds of the ' gamp ' tighter as he spoke. Ina was silent. She could think of absolutely nothing to say. Not a sound broke the summer stillness. Surely her father or mother must re turn soon. She had not the slightest notion where either of them were. Mr Romer stood"], [32, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 16 quietly in front os her, his brown eyes wander ing over her pretty dress, \u2014 now and then only did he venture to raise them to her face. By and-by the Curate thought of something to say. 'It is a difficult place, Carswell, to spend a whole holiday in. What, now what should you advise my doing, Miss Strong?' Ina had some difficulty in finding a reply. Through her mind flitted the idea of proposing that he should go over the Cathedral, but it was rejected instantly as absurd. The Cathedral was the one thing to see in Carswell ; when that was over there was nothing left to do. ' I shall \u2014 I shall be guided wholly by your advice,' he said eagerly. ' Whatever you propose, I am sure will be charming.' The girl's face flushed a little. It was just the sort of speech she disliked. She was about to punish him by declaring that she had no suggestion to make, when the expression of the man's face altered to one of sharp agony as through the sultry summer silence came the deep tone of the Cathedral clock telling the hour \u2014 one ! For at that sound swiftly to the man's mind returned the scene of yesterday. When he had come forth from his house in Jessop Street, when 'all was ready,' it was the first sound which smote upon his ear \u2014 the Cathedral bell tolling \u2014 tolling for her I All"], [33, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 17 along Jessop Street, and as they proceeded down ' the High,' he had heard the solemn note. Yes, even when at length they had reached the cemetery gate, far away in the distance he had caught it mingling with the shrill tinkle of the chapel bell close at hand. He had forgotten his question \u2014 forgotten even the girl he loved \u2014 in his sudden agony. 'It \u2014 it was like \u2014 like yesterday,' he ex plained. The flush died away from the girl's face. She pardoned him. ' Could you \u2014 could you not go away for a little ? ' she asked gently. ' I don't mean from this garden,' rather quickly, as the idea struck her that her words were open to misconstruc tion, and came dangerously near to the class of ' things one would rather not have said ' \u2014 ' but quite away from Carswell, for a complete change.' The Curate's face fell. He forgot his great sorrow again. He had certainly no wish to leave Carswell, and even if he had, had certainly not the means of doing so. ' I \u2014 I could not manage that,' he answered quickly. Ina remembered the clergyman's slender salary, and the fact that he had nothing be yond it. B"], [34, "18 CATHEDRAL BELLS. ' No, I suppose not,' she answered. ' But it is a pity ; it would have done you good. There is nothing like change. I am very sorry.' Her manner was so very gentle to him that the little man quite brightened up. ' But you haven't told me yet how I am to spend my holiday of one day, or rather half a day, to be exact,' looking, as he spoke, at his large silver watch, more like a warming-pan than a nineteenth - century timepiece. ' As I told you, I shall be guided wholly by your advice.' Ina looked vaguely round, as though seeking inspiration from some of the objects close at hand. She must settle the question ; till she did, he would never go. Then a happy thought struck her. ' Why not walk over to Stackfield ? ' she said. Stackfield was the great show place of the Marquis of Stackallan, distant some two miles from Carswell, and the park was always open to the public. James Romer very rarely allowed himself a holiday from his labours down among the canal population, who formed so large a part of the parishioners of St Mary's. ' It is just the very thing,' he answered eagerly. ' Fancy, I have only been there twice"], [35, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 19 since I came to Carswell, and each time it has been in charge of the school children. By-the bye, though, the family are there for the Par liamentary recess. Perhaps that will make a difference ; perhaps they will not let me in.' ' Oh, no ! it's all right. The state rooms are shut ; of course you cannot see them, or the picture gallery, or the gardens, but the park is always open.' She was going to add ' Do go,' but luckily stopped herself. Conscience makes cowards of us all. She felt her voice would have too eager a ring about it. ' And it is quite customary ? ' the Curate asked. ' Are you sure of that ? I mean, you do not think that if any of the family see me they will think me intrusive ? ' Ina almost laughed. ' No, no ! everyone goes. It is open to the public' Poor little nervous shy man ! She did not like to tell him that if the noble owner should by chance see him, in all probability he would not even take the trouble to wonder who he was. ' In that case, then, I think I may venture. It is so kind of you, Miss Strong. I shall feel all the afternoon that I am indebted for my enjoyment to your thoughtfulness. And you"], [36, "20 CATHEDRAL BELLS. will thank your mother for her kindness yester day? I shall \u2014 I shall not forget it,' the look of weary pain coming back for a moment to his face. ' Good-bye. I shall see you on Sunday at the school ? Oh, thank you \u2014 thank you ! It is so good of you to come \u2014 the children like it so much. Yes, indeed. Good-bye- \u2014 good-bye.' So he went, and Ina, left alone, sank back into her garden chair, and closed her eyes with a sigh of relief. Perhaps, if she sat quite quiet, the headache which the interview had given her might go off, and she might be able to en joy her garden-party at the Deanery. Long before James Romer had reached the end of ' the High,' which leads to the road to Stackfield, Ina had given up the struggle to keep awake, and was fast asleep under the shade of the garden trees."], [37, "CHAPTER II. ' Dead shepherd, now I find thy saw of might, Whoever loved that loved not at first sight.' ' As You Like It.' It was half-past four o'clock, and the promise of the morning had been more than fulfilled. In the blue sky not the shadow of a cloud was visible. The June sun was blazing hotly down, and on the Deanery lawn people were clustering together wherever there was a little shade. The windows of the old red - brick house were wide open, the muslin curtains in the drawing-room were moving gently to and fro in the soft summer breeze, while the flower-beds were bright with flowers. It was just the day for a garden-party. ' Very glad indeed to see you, Mrs Strong,' the Dean said, as that lady, followed by her daughter, stepped out through the open window to where Dr and Mrs Skelton were receiving their guests. The former was a broad, well-proportioned man, with grey hair worn somewhat long, and a pair of penetrating blue eyes. He possessed"], [38, "22 CATHEDRAL BELLS. an extremely fascinating manner ; but his for mer pupils \u2014 the Doctor had been head-master of one of our great public schools, and had only held the Deanery of Carswell for about a year \u2014 said that when he chose, the honied words were changed to winged ones, and that no man could be sterner than Dr Skelton when he elected to be so. 'Mr Strong not able to come?' asked Mrs Skelton, a fair, clever, kind-hearted little woman, as she shook hands with the new - comers. Oh ! of course ; I forgot how much he must have to do in the parish, with poor Mr Romer unable to attend to work. A great loss for him, poor man ! I fear she suffered at the last. My dear Ina, I hope you wont tire yourself. Maurice, whenever you see Miss Strong standing about this afternoon in the sun, go and lead her into the shade.' Maurice was Mrs Skelton's only son ; very clever at Latin verses, and full of promise, and only at home because he had overworked himself at Rugby. ' But I like the sun,' objected Ina. ' I'm like a cat. I have been lying in it half the morning ; besides, I am quite strong now that the warm weather has come. It was only that horrid winter which rather tried me.' Mrs Skelton was just about to commence"], [39, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 23 a reply, when the butler again appeared at the window, and announced ' Lord Rossmere.' Instantly there was a little flutter among the guests, consequent on the arrival of Lord Stackallan's son and heir. The young noble man had only lately left school, so that his presence at a Carswell entertainment had still an air of novelty about it. In his heart the lad hated garden parties, but being ' an old boy ' of Dr Skelton's, he had felt bound to attend at this one. He was a slight stripling of little more than nineteen, with fair curly hair and blue eyes, and a jolly, sunburnt face. He blushed crimson as he shook hands with the Dean, and could hardly help calling him ' sir.' After all, it was not so very long ago since the Doctor used to flog him, though, to do the young Earl justice, such floggings were never for more serious offences than skylark ing or idleness. It was quite evident, too, from the cordial way in which the Dean greeted him, that he had not forgotten the distinction. If Dr Skelton had a fault, it was a want of forgiveness towards a wrong doer. Lord Rossmere stood talking to his host for a little, while the latter questioned him eagerly as to whether there was any truth in the report that Sir William MacClaren, the member"], [40, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 24 for the county, had written to say that Lord Stackallan's son must be ready to step into his place the day he was twenty-one, as he\u2014 Sir William\u2014 was not only old, but even getting feeble. Yes, it appeared it was quite true, and it looked very much as if he would have to forego taking his degree. His father was much worried about it. And as the young lord gave utterance to the last sentence, his eyes fell on Miss Strong, and he stopped. He forgot the degree, forgot his father and Sir William, forgot everything \u2014 he was wonder ing who she was. Ina was dressed in soft cream colour \u2014 bonnet, frock, and all, and very well it suited her. There was a little flush of healthy excitement on the cheeks, which were usually a trifle pale, and the girl was looking her best. She stood there quite still, watching the people around her, and was at first wholly ignorant that the boy was gazing at her. By-and-by some mesmeric influence touched her, \u2014 she looked up, and their eyes met. Though she was at a good distance from him, something told her that the young lord's glance was full of admiration. He looked a nice, jolly boy, she thought, but she had no idea of letting him imagine that she had even noticed him, so she moved quietly away. Her mother had"], [41, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 25 gone with the Bishop's chaplain to get an ice, and Ina was alone. She looked round to see who was near that she liked well enough to join. First there was Archdeacon Maycott, tall and burly, with a loud voice and an autocratic manner, but whose heart was in the right place, and whose ample purse was open to all in need. And with him was Mrs Maycott, one of the most gentle and popular of women, whose business it was to go through life smoothing down those whom her husband had ruffled, and endeavouring to bring home to them all the man's real worth. The Maycotts had such a heap of people round them, that Ina refuted the idea of joining them, and looked for someone else. The next person upon whom the girl's eyes fell was Mrs Smallpiece, but she was mentally discarded at once. Mrs Smallpiece was a widow, who lived in a square flint villa just outside the town, and gave herself airs to those who resided within it, and was noted for being the chief scandalmonger of the neighbourhood. Should there be a dearth of scandal, then the lady was equal to the occasion and invented some. Ina simply hated her, and took but slight pains to conceal her dis like. Certainly she would not join her, the"], [42, "26 CATHEDRAL BELLS. girl thought, and looked round once more. This time she was more fortunate. The very people. Ina moved slowly over in the direction of two ladies in black, who were standing near a fir-tree, and not very far from where the white draperies of the tea-table were visible through some shrubs of laurestinus. The Misses Bunbury, aged respectively sixty three and fifty-eight, were among the institutions of Carswell. In the whole city \u2014 in the whole county \u2014 there were no people more respected. They were the daughters of a long dead Bishop of Carswell, and, owing to that, and also to the fact that their mother had been a Lady Jane Cluny, were among the ilite of the city, and their tiny house in ' Crossgates,' one of the very few at which the Stackallan carriage was ever known to stop. They were of medium height, dressed twenty years behind the fashion, possessed between them the enormous income of \u00a3300 a year, and were universally beloved. ' Oh ! Miss Bunbury,' Ina said, ' I'm so glad I caught sight of you ! In another minute I should have been reduced into asking Mrs Smallpiece to chaperon me. Mamma ran off with Mr Seymour and left me alone to take care of myself as, best I could.'"], [43, "CATLLEDRAL BELLS. 27 The ladies smiled. The girl was a pet of theirs. Often at afternoon tea, the quiet little house in ' Crossgates ' was made the brighter by Ina's presence, and both Miss Bunbury and Miss Eliza were always glad to welcome her. ' I suppose she thought as there was no Mr Romer to-day it didn't matter,' the younger Miss Bunbury remarked, laughing. The Curate's name was a standing joke between the ladies and Ina. Both the Miss Bunbury 's were what is called ' High Church,' and as Mr Romer was just the reverse and lost no opportunity of preaching against that school, there was not much love lost between them. ' Poor man,' the girl answered, her thoughts going back to that morning, while the black coated figure rose again before her, and she seemed to see once more the spasm of acute pain which crossed his face, as through the sultry summer stillness came the sound of the cathedral clock telling the hour. ' Poor man ! He came to see us this morning \u2014 to thank mamma for going to the funeral yesterday. He was dreadfully cut up.' Ina did not think it necessary to explain that Mrs Strong did not return to the house in Dean's Walk till nearly an hour"], [44, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 28 after the Curate had set out for Stack field. ' Poor soul ! ' The slightly sarcastic tone in Miss Eliza Bunbury's voice had died away as she said the two words. She would laugh at Mr Romer, his ways and opinions, at the very next opportunity, but just then her theo logical prejudices withered before the softer influence of her most womanly heart. She was thinking of the Curate in his lonely rooms of an evening, with no fond mother now to hang on his words and think each one of them full of wisdom, when her re flections were broken in upon by her young companion's voice \u2014 a voice which had in it a note of mischief. It was Ina's turn now. ' Miss Eliza,' \u2014 everyone called her Miss Eliza, \u2014 ' I see Canon Anson. He has just come. I will stand a little way back.' The Honourable and Rev. Canon Anson was a slight grey-headed bachelor of about eight-and-forty years of age. He was very shy of ladies' society, and the Misses Bun bury were among the select few he honoured with his friendship. Miss Eliza was, how ever, credited with being the chief favourite ; but I, myself, have heard Mrs Smallpiece say that this simply arose from her ' pursuing"], [45, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 29 him.' But then the Marchioness of Stackallan frequently called at the house in ' Crossgates,' and never at the villa outside the town, and it is possible that this fact may have had something to do with the widow lady's sharpness. ' Nay, child ! ' exclaimed Miss Eliza, laugh ing in spite of herself. ' He is no friend of mine. I tell Mary here that she is the attraction. He is her friend.' The eldest Miss Bunbury laughed quietly at this attack. Everything she did was noise less. She was a big woman, but her footfall was scarcely to be heard as she walked up the long aisle of the Cathedral. Mrs Small piece, indeed, always spoke of her as ' the Elephant.' ' You'll be pleased to take that speech, Ina, for what it is worth,' Miss Bunbury replied. ' Except to ask him whether he takes one or two lumps of sugar in his tea, I don't think I speak more than half a-dozen words to him when he comes to call. Dear me, Eliza ! isn't that young Lord Rossmere coming this way ? I'm sure it is. How the boy does grow ! It seems but yesterday he was in an Eton jacket and a lay-over collar ! ' The object of the good lady's remarks was coming slowly along the lawn. Now and then"], [46, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 30 he lifted his hat as he recognised one of the county; but for the most part all present were strangers to him. Suddenly his glance fell on Miss Bunbury and Miss Eliza, and his face brightened. He had known them ever since he was born, besides which, they were his mother's great friends. He came striding quickly across the smooth grass to greet them, when he caught sight of Ina. The very being he had been in search of! And what luck her being with the only people he knew really well on the lawn. ' How do you do ? ' he said, in his most cheery tones. ' I'm so awfully pleased to see you. I hardly know a soul here. Isn't it a jolly day ? Whenever we have a garden party at Stackfield, it always pours.' ' Your mother is not with you, I suppose ? ' Miss Bunbury asked, after the boy had shaken hands with herself and her sister. ' No ; she was tired, or she would have come. I wanted her to come because of him,' nodding his head in the direction of the Dean ; ' but my sisters thought she had better not. She hasn't been very first - class this spring, as I daresay you heard,' letting his eyes wander as he spoke to the slender form in cream colour. Why didn't they introduce him ? Perhaps"], [47, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 31 if he stopped talking, they would. He paused. The Misses Bunbury were in a dilemma. They were not quite sure what to do. In the whole town they alone may be said to have been really intimate with the Marchion ess, and they had always carefully abstained from in any way presuming on such intimacy. Besides, Ina was such a very pretty girl, that there was a certain sense of responsibility in introducing her to one like Lord Rossmere. Miss Eliza had just rejected the idea which had occurred to her of making her young favourite known to the future Marquis, and was about instead to make some casual remark, when Ina, who was rather a proud girl, nodded her head, and turned to join some other people who were standing near. This was too much. The young Earl felt that in another moment it would be too late. With a desperate effort he conquered his shyness, and said, \u2014 ' Miss Bunbury, please introduce me. I want to know her particularly.' The last in a whisper. It was impossible to refuse, Miss Eliza thought. She had not the slightest reason for doing so, besides which, Ina must have heard the request ; and not to comply with it would be to offend her young favourite."], [48, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 32 Standing under the shade of the great trees, beneath the summer sky, with the June sun shining hotly down, the introduction was made. How often afterwards the pair remembered that cloudless afternoon, when first they met ! ' May I take you to tea ? ' the boy asked, rather eagerly. 'It is so hot here, and every one is going.' He looked very nice, standing there in his light suit \u2014 not handsome, but still attractive enough. It was a relief, too, to see someone in Carswell who was not habited in the ever lasting black coat and white tie of the Estab lished Church, for if the truth be told, Ina was rather bored by clerical society. ' I'll have an ice, I think,' she said. ' It's too hot to drink tea. Will you tell mamma where I am, Miss Eliza? Thanks. I am quite ready,' turning to the young fellow again. Away across the smooth lawn, away among the groups of guests, who turned to look at them as they went, the pair strolled lazily along to where the refreshment tables had been set in a cool, shady spot. In a few minutes the girl was leaning against the trunk of a tree, nibbling at a strawberry ice, while Lord Rossmere stood in front of her sipping some cool claret cup."], [49, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 33 ' I never see anyone eating an ice,' the boy said after a little pause, during which he had been gazing admiringly at his com panion, ' without thinking of one afternoon in London. It was at my mother's \u2014 a great crowd and awfully hot, and I had got a lady a strawberry ice, and she was eating it, when suddenly she dropped it, glass, spoon and all, quietly on the ground, put her hand to her head, and said \u2014 what do you think she said ? ' 'How can I tell?' a little smile of antici pation showing two pretty rows of teeth. ' Well ! it's no use asking, for you'd never guess. She said, \" Oh, my eye ! \" ' Ina joined in the boy's laugh. ' Isn't it funny what an agony it is ? ' she said. ' I have felt it heaps of times. The only chance is to eat it very, very slowly, and always to take something after it.' ' Do you mean brandy ? ' asked Lord Ross mere, ' because, if so, I'm afraid there isn't any,' looking along the tables near as he spoke. ' Brandy ! ' echoed Ina. ' No, of course not ; I meant a wafer or a sponge cake. I should think you were always rather frightened now when you take anyone for refreshments if they ask for an ice. If you'd only told me C"], [50, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 34 the story sooner I would have chosen some thing else, however, I promise not to do anything so violent, no matter how bad the pain may be. I think I feel a threatening of it. Tell me, what did you do when you saw the ice go, and heard her say that?' laughing as the recollection of the story came back to her. ' Do ! ' exclaimed the boy, ' why, I roared. My sisters were furious with me, and the more they scolded the more I laughed. She was an awfully jolly little woman \u2014 old Lady Herrington, it was \u2014 and when she got better, she enjoyed the joke as much as I did ; but the best of it was that she didn't know she'd said anything funny, and thought I was only laughing because she had dropped the ice. Whenever I see her in town now I always say, \" There goes My Eye ! \" ' 'I suppose she never had any sons?' Ina asked. ' Ah, I thought not. I wonder if the Miss Bunburys ever heard the expression. No, I shouldn't think so, dear old souls ! I am so fond of them both. Ah, here is the Dean himself.' Dr Skelton nodded and smiled as he passed the young pair. He was talking to an Oxford Don, and as he went by, both Ina and her companion caught the well-known expression, ' To be sure \u2014 to be sure.'"], [51, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 35 ' I always feel my heart go down into my boots,' Lord Rossmere said, as he looked after the retreating figure with the long grey hair. ' Why ? ' asked Ina. ' I think he is so kind and nice.' ' So he is now,' the boy answered, laughing ; ' but if you only knew how many times he has swished me, you wouldn't be so surprised.' ' Perhaps \u2014 \u2022 perhaps you deserved it,' Ina answered very demurely, but with a twinkle in her pretty eyes. ' I think that is very unkind of you. Why, if you were to show me your old governess, and to tell me she used to scold you over your lessons, I should have called her an old cat, and said at once it couldn't have been your fault.' ' Ah, I'm more impartial in my judgments, you see,' the girl answered. ' No, I won't have anything more \u2014 not even brandy, thanks. It's very kind of you to offer it, especially as there isn't any. I see the Miss Bunburys in the same place, if you will take me to them.' ' Oh ! don't go back yet,' pleaded the boy. ' If you do I shall have to ask them to come to tea. I mean to do so by-and-by, but I don't want to now, you know. Don't. Let's go off alone first and have a chat \u2014 please,' very entreatingly."], [52, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 36 ' But perhaps \u2014 perhaps my mamma won't quite like it,' Ina answered, with an assumed little lisp, and an air of half babyish innocence, which she sometimes put on, and which made her absolutely irresistible. 'Nonsense, I'll take care of you. Come.' So Ina let herself be persuaded. After all, Carswell was dull. If she could find a com panion with whom to laugh and joke, why shouldn't she ? What did it matter, even if she was right in her conjecture that Mrs Smallpiece's black-beaded eyes were watching her intently? So away among the staring groups, away among the folk, who, for all their three services on Sunday and two each week day, still said nasty, ill-natured things, the pair went \u2014 away past the rose trees, up the bank, and even to the grey, crumbling walls. There they stopped, and resting their arms on the masonry, looked across the broad fields to the dim distant horizon. 'How long have you been here?' the boy asked at length, after a little silence. ' Four years.' ' Four years ! And I have never seen you before. Fancy ! I say, do you mean all the time, or do you only come into \u2014 into residence, I think they call it ? '"], [53, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 37 ' No, we are always here. My father is Rector of St Mary's.' ' St Mary's, Jessop Street ? ' resolving that if so, he, too, would for the future worship there. Ina nodded. ' And where were you before you came here ? ' At Walsall.' ' Walsall ? Walsall in Staffordshire ? ' speaking in a horrified voice. Yes.' ' What an awful thing ! I have been at the place. I once waited four hours for a train there. I nearly had a fit. I think it's the most awful hole I ever was in \u2014 worse than the city.' ' It isn't very nice,' Ina answered, ' even though I was born there, and spent the first fourteen years of my life in the centre of the town, I can't be enthusiastic about it. I don't hate it as much as I used \u2014 now that I know I'm not likely ever to live there again ; sometimes I even think I should like to go and see the place once more, just to congratulate myself on my escape. How I did hate it on a summer's day ! ' casting up the blue grey eyes expressively, and giving a little shudder as she spoke. ' I should think so. Why, it's in the very"], [54, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 38 heart of the Black Country. At night, going to Ireland, looking out of the railway window, that part of the world always reminds me of \u2014 of down below, you know,' his jolly face ex panding into a smile as he drew the com parison. It did not take very much to make Lord Rossmere laugh. ' How glad you must have been to get away ? ' ' I was,' fervently. There was a silence for a little while after this. Ina disregarded the cream-coloured frock, and continued to lean against the wall, watch ing the approach of the up-train far away to the right. Seen thus at a distance, the white cloud of smoke was rather pretty than other wise. By-and-by she got tired of this, and turning round, faced the Deanery with the great spire of the Cathedral rising behind it. The rooks, as usual, were circling round the grey buttresses, cawing loudly to one another as they did so. It was very sweet and pleasant to look at, that June evening, the girl thought, as she stood gazing at the well-known scene, while the air was heavy with the scent of the roses. By-and-by she looked up at the rooks. ' I wonder what they say to each other ? ' she said. ' It must mean something. And oh ! are they not exactly like clergymen ?"], [55, "'I WONDER what they say to each other?' Page 38."], [56, ""], [57, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 39 I always tell my mother that I believe, when they go on like that up there, they are holding an S. P. G. Meeting ! ' The boy laughed. ' I know what that is. They have them at the Palace, don't they ? I thought so. My mother comes in for them. Do you know her \u2014 my mother, I mean ? ' ' By sight,' Ina answered. ' I see her driv ing sometimes, and once, when I was at the Bunburys at tea time, she came in. I just met her at the drawing-room door as I was leaving.' ' What a pity ! Why didn't you stop and be introduced to her ? ' Lord Rossmere ex claimed, thinking that the girl's sweet face and pretty manners would have made a favourable impression ; for already he had resolved that, somehow, he would get his mother to call on Mrs Strong. If that could be done, then it would be easy to ask the girl to lunch at Stackfield, and spend the afternoon. His speculations were, however, broken up by the Cathedral chimes. 'What on earth is the time?' he ex claimed, pulling out his watch. ' Half-past six ! I have to be at the station to meet the down express ! My father has been to"], [58, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 40 the Castle for a Privy Council. What a bore it is ! I wish I hadn't said I'd do it. As it is, of course, I must go, as there is only the phaeton between us. If I'd only come in the dog-cart I might have stopped on.' ' You would have had to stay on alone then. Look, everyone is going. We must do the same. I shall be scolded for stop ping up here like this \u2014 dreadfully scolded,' putting on again the little air of babyish innocence which was so very captivating. ' Can't I drive you anywhere \u2014 you and your mother, I mean \u2014 on my way to the station ? ' the boy asked eagerly, and with an admiring light in his eyes. The pair were making their way slowly along to where Dr and Mrs Skelton were bidding adieu to their guests. People are wonderfully like a flock of sheep, and, at a party, when one goes, the rest follow. ' Drive us home ! ' exclaimed Ina. ' Why, we live just opposite \u2014 in Dean's Walk.' ' Do you ? And when shall I see you again ? You must introduce me to your mother \u2014 will you ? \u2014 now, before you go away ; and then \u2014 ' but Lord Rossmere's sentence was never finished, for the kindly little old Bishop, who was making his way to the"], [59, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 41 drawing-room window, caught sight of the boy \u2014 whom he had known from his birth, having, indeed, baptized him. ' Good-bye \u2014 good-bye ! ' he exclaimed, holding out one of his trembling hands. ' I heard you were here, but no one could find you. Tell me, is your father at Stackfield ? ' ' He comes back to-night,' the young fellow answered. ' The carriage is waiting for me now, and I am to pick him up at the station.' ' I half wanted \u2014 ' began the good Bishop, putting his hand on the boy's arm, and drawing him towards the house. Ina was left alone. She just caught a look, \u2014 half laughing, half indignant, \u2014 and then her mother's voice made her start. 'My dear Ina, where have you been? Miss Bunbury and I have been looking for you everywhere.' Fortunately the throng of departing guests closed in around them, and Ina was spared the necessity of answering. In another minute they were bidding their host and hostess good night. ' Such a pleasant party,' murmured Mrs Strong. ' And so good of you to come,' Mrs Skelton answered."], [60, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 42 And then they passed through the hall, and out once more into the fresh summer air. A phaeton and pair, with a coronet on the harness, was waiting at the door, and a smart groom was touching his hat to some one just behind Ina. ' Only five minutes to spare, my lord,' the domestic said, in a warning voice. ' Good - night, Miss Strong,' Lord Rossmere said, as he gave the girl's slender fingers a lingering pressure. ' Wasn't it a shame ? \u2014 the way he carried me off, I mean. Another minute, and the carriage, the horses cloud of dust, and then through the iron gates. he had sprung into plunged, there was a they had disappeared ' He seems a nice boy,' the girl thought, as she followed her mother down the gravel walk. The shadows were falling long and peaceful as they made their way up Dean's Walk to the house, which nestled under the shade of the great Cathedral \u2014 the tall spire of which stood out clearly against the evening sky."], [61, "CHAPTER III. ' Her children rose up and called her blessed : Her husband, and he praised her.' \u2014 Proverbs. It was the morning after the Dean's party, and the flag at Stackfield was waving in the summer breeze, while on the lawn, at the back of the great castellated pile of buildings, Lord Rossmere was smoking a cigarette. It was just such a day as the pre- vious one, but perhaps a trifle warmer, and the only sounds which broke the silence were the song of the birds and the hum of the bees. Away to the right was a great blaze of colour \u2014 the Marchioness's flower-garden ; but everything else was a soft green. All round the house clustered the mighty elms and cedars while fully one-half of the grey walls were covered with Irish ivy. ' A most beautiful and stately home,' wrote good Lord Shaftesbury of Wilton House, and surely the same might be said of Stackfield. How quiet and still it was ! Phew ! and how hot. Rossmere moved back a little way, as"], [62, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 44 the sun was beginning to find out the spot where he was standing. By-and-by his eyes fell on a little basket chair, and he went towards it. He was tall, and the chair, as I have said, small, but he managed to squeeze himself down into it, and went on thoughtfully puffing away. How was he to get his mother to call on the Strongs ? This was the great problem which had been occupying the boy's brain ever since he rose, and though the stable clock had chimed eleven, he had not found an answer yet. As far as he knew, except at the Palace, the Deanery, and the Miss Bunburys, she never called anywhere in Carswell. And what excuse was he to offer? He must have some reason to give. Why, oh ! why did not Ina Strong have a brother at school with him ? That would have made things so much simpler. How would it be if he asked his sister Beatrice to manage it ? No. Beatrice would do it right enough, but then she would chaff about it so. He knew that. Mary, then ? He shook his head impatiently. His eldest sister would cer tainly not be of the slightest use. No, there was nothing for it but to tell the truth \u2014 to say to his mother that he liked Ina, and would she therefore call on Mrs Strong ? If he went on sitting there till luncheon, he would not find"], [63, "HE MANAGED TO SQUEEZE HIMSELF DOWN INTO IT. Page 44."], [64, ""], [65, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 45 any better excuse, so he rose reluctantly, and moved away towards the flower-garden. Rossmere opened the iron gate, and passed along the gravel paths. The air was heavy with the perfume of flowers, and in the bright June sunlight the beds of geranium and cal ceolaria looked almost too glaring. By-and-by he came to the drawing-room windows, and, stooping down, looked under one of the heavy canvas blinds. No, there was no one there, and he passed on to the glass door leading into the conservatory. Goodness ! what an atmosphere. Sahara was a joke to it. The only cool thing about the place was the splashing of a little fountain in the centre. He did not stop by it, though, but hurried on till he came to an other glass door, which was wide open, and led into 'My lady's room.' The young lord entered softly, and, standing on the white mat, looked round for the owner of this cool, carefully shaded chamber. The Marchioness of Stackallan was seated at her writing - table, but apparently her work was finished. A great pile of letters ready for stamping were lying near, but she herself was reading. One plump little hand, covered with jewels, was moving slowly along the lines of the book, as though more easily to keep the place. Those jewels were the only"], [66, "46 CATHEDRAL BELLS. splendid things about her. She was a very little woman \u2014 a tiny woman, folks said some times \u2014 with smooth grey hair, and calm hazel eyes. You would never take her, the Carswellites often remarked, for a great lady. She was generally dressed in a short, plainly made cashmere, and wore on her head a white cap with black ribbons. She did not hear the step of her boy in the conservatory, she was so intent on her reading. The room in which she was sitting, with its costly hang ings and priceless pictures, had faded away, and she was back in the long-gone days of old Judea, listening to the voice of Him who bade those weary and heavy-laden come to Him ; and, com ing, be at rest. Sometimes she herself was weary now, she thought, and put her hand quickly to her side. Then a slight noise startled her, and she looked up and smiled. ' What ! Ross ! ' she said, and taking off her gold spectacles, laid them on the still open Bible. ' I thought you were going to work very hard this morning, my dear. You don't look much like it at present.' ' I'm going to do so, mother, nevertheless. I'm on my way to get out my books. I shall have two hours clear before luncheon, and, after all, I don't go up to Oxford before the end of September.'"], [67, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 47 ' What day do you expect Mr Stillwell ? ' Lady Stackallan asked. Mr Stillwell was a University coach who had accepted an engagement of three months, in which time he guaranteed to have Lord Rossmere fit for matriculation. The family were only at Stackfield for the Whitsuntide recess, and up till yesterday the heir had done nothing but bemoan his fate in not being allowed to go back to London, whither they were to return next week ; but now all was changed. To be sure, he had enjoyed the balls very much when he was up there, but he thought he would enjoy the neighbourhood of Carswell still more. He felt that his virtu ous conduct in remaining behind at Stackfield was about to meet with an unexpected reward. ' I don't quite know,' he replied ; ' about the 20th, I believe. I say, mother, I want to ask you something.' ' Yes, my dear. What is it ? The boy stood still on the white rug, twisting his deer - stalking cap round and round. He did not quite know how to begin. Almost he wished he had not come to ask. He could not think of anything else about which he wished to speak. He must begin. It would look so strange if he stood there doing nothing \u2014 saying nothing."], [68, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 48 And Lady Stackallan herself? After all, she was not thinking about his silence \u2014 she was thinking, instead, how well and manly he looked, standing there with his back to the sunlight. There was a poor woman, down at a cottage near the Home Farm, who only last week had to go away and leave her children for evermore. Poor soul ! poor soul ! That must be a dreadful thing ! To go away and leave them behind ! God in His mercy keep them together a while longer, she thought, looking at her son ; and while she said it \u2014 while she said it, the little woman moved her hand to her side again. ' Are you \u2014 are you busy, mother ? ' Rossmere asked, after a pause ; ' because if so, I can come and ask you another time.' He was like a timid bather, putting one foot into the water and then withdrawing it. ' No, my dear, I'm not busy. I have done all my correspondence, and am only reading. What is it you want to talk about?' ' Oh, it's only \u2014 I want you to do something \u2014 to go and see someone. You know yesterday \u2014 the Dean's garden party, I mean, \u2014 well, I \u2014 I met some jolly people \u2014 the Strongs. He is Rector of St Mary's, and they live in Dean's Walk. I wish you would go and \u2014 and call on them, mother. '"], [69, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 49 Lady Stackallan was certainly a little sur prised, and a little bothered by the request. Long ago, when first she came to Stackfield, she had wished to alter the Dowager March ioness's rule of never calling anywhere in Carswell, but little by little she had dis covered that her mother-in-law's custom was a wise one. She found out that she could not call on everybody, \u2014 that she must draw a line somewhere, and that such distinction would end in jealousies and heart-burnings. So, with the exception of the Palace, the Deanery, and the Miss Bunburys in the Crossgates, \u2014 the latter, by the way, she had known when they themselves dwelt at the Palace, \u2014 she had never been anywhere in the town. Lady Stackallan was certainly troubled by her boy's request. ' My dear,' she said, ' I don't know what to say to you. I should like to do what you ask very much, but I have never done anything of this kind. If I call on one person, then people will say I ought to call on others. You do not know what a difficult thing it is to deal with all the little ins and outs of life in a quiet country town like Carswell. If I call on Mr Strong, the Rector of St Mary's, why not on Mr Webber, the Vicar of St Philip's?' D"], [70, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 50 'But, mother, they are so nice\u2014 the Strongs.' 'Yes, dear, very likely. And so perhaps are the Webbers. Of what does the family consist, Ross ? ' The boy grew very red. The cap went round quicker than ever. 'There \u2014 there is the father \u2014 he is the Rector, you know, and Mrs Strong and the daughter.' 'No sons?' looking much surprised. ' I don't think so. Oh ! mother, I have just thought of something which makes all the difference \u2014 they are friends of the Bunburys. It was Miss Eliza who introduced me. She was chaperoning Miss Strong when I was with them.' Lady Stackallan looked relieved. ' I might call on them if they are great friends of theirs,' she said. ' I shall be in Carswell this afternoon, and I will go and see them, and if I find I can do this thing without offence to others, I will call on the Strongs before I come back. Will that content you, Ross ? ' ' Oh, thanks,' looking greatly relieved. ' I'm sure you will like them. Miss Strong met you once at their house \u2014 she came away as you were announced. Perhaps you remember her, mother?'"], [71, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 51 Lady Stackallan shook her head. Evidently Ina had not made quite so much impression on her as on her son. Then the little clock on the plush - covered mantelpiece chimed half-past eleven, and the young fellow gave a start. ' I must go \u2014 I shall only just get my two hours' reading done before luncheon, even if I begin at once.' A moment more and he was gone, and Lady Stackallan had replaced her spectacles, while her plump little hand, with the diamond and emerald rings, was moving once more along the lines of the Marchioness's ever-open Bible. Four ! Loud and clear came the deep tones of the Cathedral clock telling the hour to the half - baked inhabitants of Carswell. It was the afternoon of the same day as that on which Lord Rossmere had made his request to his mother, and in Crossgates everything was very still. As a rule, there was not much stirring in that part of the town, which consisted chiefly of large old fashioned, red brick houses, inhabited by fairly rich folk ; indeed, Crossgates was considered the aristocratic part of Carswell ; and as, in the four streets which composed it, there was"], [72, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 52 no such thing as a shop, I suppose its claim to such distinction must be allowed. Perhaps the best time to see this quiet spot was just at the very hour and on just such a day as I am now describing. In the four streets scarcely a soul was visible. Here and there some family, who suffered more from the heat than others, had gone so far as to set the door wide open, and, looking in across the hall, the passer-by could catch a glimpse of quaint, old - fashioned gardens, with large shade-giving trees and great masses of stocks and such-like homely flowers. By-and-by the drowsy, restful stillness of the June afternoon was broken by the sound of fast-trotting horses, and directly afterwards a barouche and pair appeared at the top of ' Crossgates East,' and a minute later one or two old ladies taking forty winks were rudely startled from their doze as a very tall powdered footman awoke the echoes of the quiet neigh bourhood by the aid of Miss Bunbury's knocker. ' Now, this is really kind of you,' Miss Eliza exclaimed, rising quickly as the Marchioness was shown into the little drawing-room, where she and her sister were awaiting afternoon tea. At Carswell, in consequence of the Cathedral"], [73, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 53 service being at five o'clock, the devotional part of the community were wont to partake of their afternoon beverage rather earlier than they would otherwise have done. 'I don't know what there is kind in coming to see those whose friendship I value,' the visitor said, holding her companion's hand firmly in her own. Miss Eliza and Lady Stackallan had been friends for five-and-thirty years. ' Nay, but I didn't think you'd have time to come and see us, hearing you were here but for a few days, and needing rest. Ross told us \u2014 I suppose I ought to say Lord Rossmere now, he's growing such a young man ! \u2014 that you hadn't been well. Mary and I were half think ing of taking a fly to Stackfield to see you to morrow afternoon. I think, if you hadn't come in to-day, we should have ordered it after service.' ' Do so all the same, my dear,' Lady Stack allan answered, seating herself, as she spoke, in a chair between Miss Bunbury and her sister. ' Yes, indeed, Eliza, I wish it. Is there need to ask, old friend ? Now, you'll please order that fly so as to bring you out in time for luncheon. No, I won't let you off. We go back to London on Tuesday \u2014 oh dear ! ' and Lady Stackallan sighed. ' I'm afraid it must be very hot in town,' the"], [74, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 54 elder Miss Bunbury remarked. 'And then I know you don't like it.' ' Like it ! ' echoed their visitor. ' My dear, I was going to say I hate it, but I won't. It's all ordered for the best, and it's clearly my duty to help in keeping my husband's friends together. Not that that is an easy task just now, as I daresay you have heard. The Post and one or two of the other papers have been making the most of it. Of course you Tories are delighted, but, to let you into a secret \u2014 mind, not a word of this to any one else, \u2014 I don't fancy Stackallan would be sorry if we split up, and your side came in.' ' One paper \u2014 the Standard, I think \u2014 was suggesting a coalition between the Whigs and Tories,' remarked Miss Bunbury. ' Do you think there is any chance of that?' ' Not the least, my dear,' Lady Stackallan answered. ' Mr Gledman and his Radical fol lowers would upset it at once ; but I declare I'm not going to talk politics. I shall hear enough of them when Parliament meets again next week. By-the-bye, I came to see you on business. I hear you are friends of Mr Strong and his family. What sort of people are they ? Ross wants me to call on them. He asked me so earnestly, that I told him I would talk to you about it. You know the reasons, my"], [75, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 55 dears, which have always prevented my seeing people in Carswell. Do you think I may ven ture to break through my rule ? ' ' Well,' Miss Eliza answered, with a smile, ' we like Mrs Strong and her daughter very much. The father is more in your line.' Lady Stackallan was popularly supposed to be some what evangelical in her views. ' He is a quiet, silent, odd man, but not a Churchman. Ross asked to be introduced to Ina Strong when she was with us at the Deanery yesterday, and of course I complied. She is a very pretty girl, and a great pet of ours. I say to Mary she quite brightens up this little room when she comes to preside at the tea-table if we invite a few folks in about this time of day.' ' And you think, then, I may call ? ' Lady Stackallan asked. 'Yes,' Miss Eliza answered thoughtfully; ' yes, I think so. They are discreet people \u2014 Mrs Strong and Ina \u2014 they will never go about talk ing of it, otherwise there would be jealousies and that kind of thing among the wives and daughters of other clergymen. I am sure you will like them if you do call.' 'Very well, then, that is settled. I will break through my rule for once. I have always been sorry,' Lady Stackallan went on in"], [76, "56 CATHEDRAL BELLS. her quiet, hushed voice, 'that it was thought better for me not to call upon the towns folk. Now and then, and that only when there has been trouble and sorrow, I have asked at people's houses \u2014 just inquiries, my dear, you know. It couldn't do them any good \u2014 / knew that ; but it was something ; just, as it were, to say, \"I'm thinking of you. I know what you are feeling ; my heart is with you in your trial.\" ' ' And they have appreciated it, Lady Stack allan,' Miss Bunbury answered warmly. ' They have understood it as you meant them to under stand it. Your sympathy has not been thrown away.' There were tears in the elderly woman's eyes as she spoke, and the visitor, noting it, gave her friend's hand a little squeeze. The conversation drifted away from the Strongs after this. Jane, the Miss Bunburys' factotum, brought in the tea-things, and laid the little table close to the elder sister's chair. There was not much money at the house in Crossgates, but still everything was nice, and there was an air of refinement about it all. The tea was served in Crown Derby china, and the kettle and other appurtenances were of quaint, old-fashioned silver. These were rem nants of the long-gone Palace days, and were"], [77, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 57 much valued by their owners. Once \u2014 about fifteen years before the date of my story \u2014 the silver and china had very nearly to be parted with. Old Bishop Bunbury had left his daughters very comfortably off, having bequeathed to them nearly on the income of which they had lived for many years. The old man in his anxiety had ap pointed a solicitor, in whom he had confidence, as their trustee, and things had gone well, until one day the gentleman unfortunately took him self off to Spain, leaving the Misses Bunbury with about which was all that remained of their capital. The crisis had been a sharp one, but they had come bravely through it. The few who had seen the pair in those dark hours, had seen only two quiet, calm, brave, self-confident ladies. The day it was thought the silver and china must go, the elder Miss Bunbury had cried a good deal, but it seemed inevitable, since there was something like two years' account owing to Dr Fraser for medical attendance, and there was no other way of meeting it. Miss Eliza was on her way to the silversmith's, when who should she run against but the doctor himself. She stopped to say she would send him a cheque in a few days, when it turned out that her sister had paid the account six months before. Miss"], [78, "58 CATHEDRAL BELLS. Eliza was very much surprised \u2014 so much sur prised, that the doctor had to take her into his office and produce his books, when, sure enough, there was the account struck off and duly receipted. He said it had been paid in gold, which surprised Miss Eliza very much, as she and her sister always paid by cheque, but I, who know Dr Fraser, think he spoke a parable. Miss Bunbury was a good deal startled when she heard about the affair, and denied the payment at once, which brought the doctor round. He was very angry indeed, said it was impossible for him to remember, after this lapse of time, which of the ladies had paid the account, and that he hated such carelessness in money matters. Then the physician had banged on his hat and had gone out of the house, and the Miss Bunburys were never able to learn anything more about the matter, because it made the doctor so very angry to have it mentioned. What a long way I have wandered ! Lady Stackallan had a second cup of tea, and the Cathedral bell had begun to sound for after noon service before she rose to go. She was very eager that her friends should come and see her the next day \u2014 so eager, that they pro mised to do so without fail. Miss Eliza wanted her to stay on and rest, she seemed"], [79, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 59 so tired, but she wouldn't. She didn't look ill ; indeed, the Marchioness may have been said to have been looking almost rosy ; but she kept changing her position, and putting her hand to her side. It was only a sort of ' stitch ; ' she often had it now, she said. Oh ! it was nothing. Then she laughed, and went out of the little drawing-room, and downstairs. There was a framed text on the landing, and Lady Stackallan stayed to look at it. ' The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.' She read the words aloud, and pressed her friend's hand. ' My favourite,' she said, and Miss Eliza saw tears in the calm hazel eyes. Then the two ladies kissed, and Lady Stackallan got into her carriage and drove away through the quiet streets, away into the sombre old Close, while all the time the deep-toned bell was sounding forth its summons to the house of prayer. ' Mrs Strong was not at home,' Martha said, in answer to the tall footman's inquiry. Then the cards were handed in, with a verbal message to the effect that Lady Stackallan was sorry not to have been more fortunate, and then the carriage drove away once more through ' the High,' and out into the quiet lanes leading to lordly Stackfield. And at the same hour, under the grey arches"], [80, "60 CATHEDRAL BELLS. of the old Cathedral, loud and clear, came the voice of Canon Anson in the solemn words of the litany, \u2014 ' That it may please Thee to preserve all that travel by land or by water, all women labouring of child, all sick persons and young children, and to sliozv Thy pity upon all prisoners and captives.' And as the Canon said 'sick persons,' some how Miss Eliza couldn't help thinking of her friend Lady Stackallan."], [81, "CHAPTER IV. The pearl of days.' It was Sunday in that glad midsummer time of which I am writing, and the heavens were still the same cloudless sheet of blue that they had been all the long week past. It would be very hot in church, Ina told herself, as, at about half-past ten, she stepped out into the quaint, old-fashioned garden ; she did not feel the least inclined to walk all the way through Crossgates to her father's church in Jessop Street. It would be much cooler in the great, grey, dusky Cathedral. Involuntarily Ina looked at the tall spire towering upwards towards the summer skies, while, from the belfry on the left, rang forth the music of the grand peal for which Carswell has long been famous. ' Ina ! ' Mrs Strong's voice came through the open drawing-room window, and directly afterwards that lady appeared on the stone steps which led down into the garden."], [82, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 62 ' Oh dear ! ' thought the girl. ' There goes my chance of escape. I shall have to go to Jessop Street now.' They tell us \u2014 those wise folk who are always setting the world in order \u2014 that it is well to take a hopeful view of everything, but I am rather inclined to dispute the matter with them. If we look at the blackest, gloomiest side, then, at least, happen what may, we shall not be disappointed. Ina having regarded the hot walk along the narrow streets as inevitable, was agreeably surprised by her mother's next sentence. 'What are you doing out there without a parasol ? It's enough to give you a headache for the rest of the day. I'm going off now. What I came to say was, that it's much too hot for you to go to Jessop Street \u2014 you must go to the Cathedral, especially if you are going to take a class in the Sunday school this afternoon.' ' Thank goodness ! ' the girl answered fer vently. ' I was standing here, mother, wonder ing how in the world I could get out of going to St Mary's, and had just decided that it was inevitable, when you turn up and save me. If papa says anything at luncheon, I shall refer him to you. It's not more than a fortnight ago that he told me that if I could"], [83, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 63 get out of going to our own church, I did. There ! ' laughing merrily. ' I'm not sure that he spoke without some reason,' Mrs Strong returned, with a smile. ' But, at all events, I forbid it to-day. And mind you put on something before you go into the Cathedral. The change of tempera ture from being out in this sun is wonderful. I remember Dr Fraser saying it was one of the most dangerous things a person could do \u2014 to go into a great building like that with out first putting on a shawl or something, and that the neglect of doing so was just one of the reasons why English people always catch fever in Italy.' Then, without more ado, Mrs Strong disappeared from the window and directly afterwards Ina heard the hall door shut. It was cool and pleasant, as the girl had anticipated, under the high vaulted roof in the Norman nave of the Cathedral that June morning. There was none of the close stuffiness which belonged to her father's octagon-shaped church, and which generally led her to wish the service was over before it had begun. She took her place in one of the two chairs she and her mother usually appro priated, then gave a little glance round to see who was present. Her eyes had fallen on the"], [84, "64 CATHEDRAL BELIES. Misses Bunbury, sitting side by side in their customary places, when a little stir caused her to look behind, and directly afterwards she perceived Lord Rossmere and his youngest sister, Lady Beatrice Scott, making their way up to the Stackfield seats in the choir. It was not often that any member of the family were to be seen anywhere on a Sunday morn ing, save in the little church of Waring, which was situated in the Park itself. Involuntarily there flashed across Ina's mind a question Lord Rossmere had put to her at the Deanery party, as to where she went on Sunday mornings, and which she had answered by saying that she went to St Mary's unless it was very hot, and then she went to the Cathedral. A faint flush stole over the girl's face at the recollection, for, with a woman's quick instinct, she comprehended that she her self was the real cause of the young lord's presence there that day. Then the great organ pealed, and there was a general uprising of the congregation as the long line of clergymen, followed by the kindly little old Bishop, made their way to the choir, and directly afterwards the service began. By-and-by, when some of the younger members of the congregation were beginning to get rather weary, the devotional part of"], [85, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 65 the service came to an end ; and just as the last stroke of the clock, telling the hour of noon, died slowly away, the Dean gave out his text. There was a deep silence in the old Cathedral that summer morning, and the congregation seemed to listen with greater attention than usual to the voice of Dr Skelton, as he sought to increase among his hearers the faith that was so strong in his own heart. Accustomed as Lord Rossmere was to the plain service in the little church of Waring, or the equally simple one in Curzon Street Chapel when in town, the lengthy, spun out devotions of Carswell Cathedral seemed abnormally long. Why couldn't they read the things, he asked himself impatiently, while listening to the anthem. He wanted to get out and catch Ina, and introduce his sister to her. It would be luncheon-time at that rate before the service was over ; and then what chance had he of anything like a chat ? But all this was changed when once the Dean got into the pulpit. The boy even forgot for a little the slender figure clad in pale pink, and, which, I regret to say,, he had done hardly anything else but watch all through the prayers and slowly-chanted litany. Do not be too E"], [86, "66 CATHEDRAL BELLS. shocked, kind reader, at this, but call to mind the Sunday after you first fell in love, and tell me, if you can, that you paid unremitting attention to your devotions on that occasion. Yes, and you, oh ! nineteenth century Christian Pharisee, casting up your eyes in horror at the bare idea of such impiety, tell me, do your thoughts never wander during church to things so mundane, that beside them a boy's first passion for a maid seems, as it often is, an almost sacred thing ? Yes, even Ina Strong was forgotten, or al most forgotten, as young Lord Rossmere list ened to the voice he knew so well, and which he had heard, Sunday after Sunday, in the days of old. The Cathedral faded away from him. He was back again, a little boy at school, the first Sunday after leaving home, and he was listening to the Doctor's first sermon of the half year. He closed his eyes, and the long line of familiar faces came back to him until he could have declared that he was in the school chapel once more, and the past twelve months had been but a dream. How well he remembered the place \u2014 the painted windows to dead and gone masters and school fellows, the mosaics which his pocket-money had helped to put up ; above all, the dear companions who seemed dropping so quickly"], [87, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 67 out of his life, and who had stood near him on that never - to - be - forgotten last Sunday of school life, while six hundred voices sang the touching hymn, \u2014 ' Let Thy Father hand be shielding All who here shall meet no more ; May their seed time past be yielding Year by year a richer store. Those returning Make more faithful than before.' Then the uprising of the congregation awoke the boy from his day dreams, and to the fact that the service was over. , ' Come,' he said in a whisper to his sister ; 'quickly, I say,' for the pink-clad figure had begun to gather up her books, and Lord Ross mere felt that the time was precious. ' How do you do, Miss Strong?' he exclaimed, when at length he slipped out through the great west door into the soft summer air. ' Isn't it jolly to get out of church ? Oughtn't I to say it ? I'm so sorry. I don't think anybody heard me, and I believe you think so yourself. May I introduce my sister to you ? Beatrice, this is Miss Strong.' Lady Beatrice Scott, a pretty girl with a mass of fair curly hair, put out her hand at once. ' I am charged by mamma to say she was so sorry not to have found Mrs Strong at home"], [88, "68 CATHEDRAL BELLS. yesterday, and that she hopes to be more for lunate when we come back from London.' ' Are you going to town soon ? ' Ina asked, hardly knowing what she was saying, conscious as she was of the eyes of half a hundred members of the congregation being fixed upon her and her companions. Indeed, one or two persons had even gone so far as to stand per fectly stock still, while Mrs Smallpiece's, 'Well I never ! What is the world coming to ? ' was audible enough to reach the ears of at least one member of the trio. An angry pink flush mounted to my heroine's cheeks. ' We go the day after to-morrow,' was the reply. ' That is, all except this boy, who is to stay behind and do his lessons. London dis sipations are not supposed to be good for him just at present Which way are you walking, Miss Strong ? We may as well go with you through the cloisters, then, I'm so fond of this view of the Cathedral. I always think one gets a better idea of the height of the spire.' ' Yes, but you can see it even better from our garden,' Ina answered. ' Isn't it nice and cool ? I often bring my work and sit here of a summer's morning.' ' How charming,' Lady Beatrice answered, pausing as she did so to look along the grey cloisters, and at the worn tombstones around."], [89, "'WE MAY AS WELL GO WITH YOU THROUGH THE CLOISTERS.' Page 68."], [90, ""], [91, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 69 ' To-day, with that blue sky out there, and the sunshine coming through those arches, it's quite like an Italian scene. One wouldn't be a bit surprised to see a dear old monk coming along, like one sees them in Rome ! ' ' I think he would rather startle our good Carswell people. I fancy I can see the Dean's face if he came upon a white-robed Dominican telling his beads here.' ' He'd swish him, to a certainty,' exclaimed Rossmere, laughing. ' That was always the Doctor's one remedy \u25a0 \u2014 always. My offences varied, but his punishments never changed.' The two girls laughed as they turned down the narrow walk which led to Ina's home. The white surplice and scarlet velvet hood of the gentleman in question was visible far on ahead. The young lord whistled. ' Talk of the what-do-you-call-him ! ' he said ' I'm glad he didn't hear me, even though he can't swish me now. I wonder how he gets on without it? Takes it out of Maurice, I suppose.' ' I don't believe Maurice Skelton ever did anything wrong in his life,' Ina answered reprovingly. ' Here we are at my door. Won't you come in, Lady Beatrice, and rest ? ' ' Thanks, but I'm afraid we mustn't. It's a quarter to one now, and we have two miles to go. What I want to know is, will you come"], [92, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 70 and lunch with us to-morrow? If you will, I will drive you back in my pony carriage.

I have only had them a month. Papa gave them to me for a birthday present. You must come ! ' Ina was silent, not quite knowing how she was to manage it, being already engaged to go and play tennis at Archdeacon Maycott's. She liked Lady Beatrice very much already, and the boy's eyes were saying, as plainly as words could speak, ' Do come,' but still she didn't quite see her way to it. ' I should like it very much,' she said, with a little flush of pleasure rising to her cheeks, ' but I'm afraid I have promised Mrs Maycott to go and play tennis with her children in the afternoon.' ' Oh ! that doesn't matter,' exclaimed Lord Rossmere ; ' Beatrice can order the carriage for half-past three, and you'll be there at four o'clock. It doesn't matter being a little late, tennis isn't like a train, you don't have to catch it to the minute.' 'Well, I think I might manage it,' Ina an-"], [93, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 71 swered. ' But won't it bore you, driving me in in this heat? I can just as easily come back in the fly which takes me out.' \u25a0 Bore me ! Nonsense ! Why, it's just what I should like of all things.

Come, Ross, luncheon will be over before we start at this rate ! ' ' You will come, won't you ?

' Good-bye.'"], [94, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 72 'Good-bye.' Another long squeeze, and he was gone after his sister, and directly afterwards the pair disappeared through the archway lead ing into the silent cloisters. Ina stood still for a minute or two after she was left alone, looking down the narrow path leading to the Deanery, and thinking over her invitation for to-morrow. Certainly Carswell seemed a little brighter than it did. Then she turned to enter her own door, when hurried footsteps behind made her look up, and she beheld Mrs Smallpiece ! ' Well, I'm sure ! ' the latter exclaimed, as Ina put out rather a limp hand. ' I hardly ex pected a bow from you to-day. I really feel the honour very much ! I thought, when I saw them turn down here, that they were going in to lunch with you \u2014 I did indeed ! I ran round to Miss Gaston's as fast as I could.

Fancy your going up to Miss Gaston's win dow like that ! I should think she would be very angry when she hears it. I should, I know.' ' But you are not telling me anything,' broke in the widow. ' Begin at the beginning, and tell one just what was said. And why did they come ? I saw you and the young Earl together at the garden - party. I suppose he told his mother to call ? How did I hear of that? Well, I was in Smith Street on Friday, and I saw the Marchioness drive by, and the carriage turn into the Close ; so I thought I'd just run down and see whether it was to the Palace or the Deanery she had gone. When I got through the arch, I saw the coachman had pulled up, and the footman had got down and was looking for some house. I said to myself, \" Now's my time,\" and hurried on, for I thought I might get a chance of speaking to her ladyship by asking whose residence the servant was looking for, but just as I got near, that horrid milkman came by with his cans, and the footman asked"], [96, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 74 him where Mrs Strong's house was. You might have knocked me down with a feather, you might. I followed the man up to the door, heard him ask if your mamma was at home. What a pity she was out ! If she'd only been in, I should have waited till the Marchioness was safely lodged, and then called myself.' ' What an escape for mother ! ' Ina thought, as Mrs Smallpiece paused to take breath. ' Yes,' the widow went on after a bit, ' that's what I should have done. I was disappointed when the man went away only leaving cards. I'm not sure, though, if I was you I wouldn't rather have it so. You see, if the Marchioness had come in, people would only have had your ivord for it, whereas now you can show the cards. They are just the things to do you good, if you take them to the seaside and put them in the looking-glass. Your landlady would be sure to tell people, and you'd have no end of callers. I always take Sir William and Lady Trevor's cards with me when I go into lodgings anywhere.' Sir William was a brand new baronet, and not thought much of by the county people round Carswell. Ina burst out laughing. ' I never thought of them as articles of"], [97, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 75 value before,' she said. ' When my mother gets up this bazaar for our schools, I'll tell her to utilise the contents of the card-basket. Lady Stackallan's ought to fetch a tidy little sum. How much should you think, Mrs Small piece ? Fifteen shillings? It's for a charity, you know.' ' I'd give that for it,' the widow answered, not in the least comprehending that her young friend was turning her into ridicule. ' Or, say a pound, with the Marquis's thrown in. I'd go as high as that, my dear, any day.' Mrs Smallpiece was quite excited about it. ' I'm afraid it wouldn't be right,' Ina answered gravely, ' but I can ask my mother, if you like. Ah ! here she is. Mrs Smallpiece wants to know if you will sell her the Stackfield people's cards for a pound ? She wants to put them in her looking-glass next time she goes to the seaside.' ' What nonsense are you talking, Ina ? ' Mrs Strong answered, giving Mrs Smallpiece's hand anything but a warm shake. ' Really, it's much too hot, child, for you to be standing here. Won't you come in for a little and rest ? ' The last words were addressed to the widow. Mrs Smallpiece looked at her watch, and shook her head.

To be unpunctual with meals on Sunday was one of the unpardonable sins in the clergyman's eyes. His wife and daughter forgot Mrs Smallpiece and vanished quickly, just as Martha rang the hand-bell shrilly to announce the mid-day meal. The Cathedral bells were pealing loud and clear for service on the afternoon of the same day, when Ina turned out of Smith Street into the quiet of Crossgates. She was on her way to perform her weekly penance by taking a class in her father's Sunday School, and she felt just a little inclined to be cross. She could feel the fierce rays of the sun through her parasol. ' Why, oh, why did she ever undertake this duty?' she asked herself im patiently, as she made her way along, past"], [102, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 78 the old red-brick houses, from the gardens of which came the scent of honeysuckle and sweetbriar. Oh, if she might only open the Miss Bunburys' door, and creep upstairs to the little drawing-room and lie quietly on the sofa till her two old friends returned from their afternoon devotions ! The bells had stopped by this time, and the stillness of the quiet thoroughfare was unbroken. It was no use to think nonsense, she told herself, and went quietly on up ' Crossgates East ' past the livery stables \u2014 which had been redecorated by the enterprising owner with a view to keep himself well before the public \u2014 on through Jessop Street, and past her father's ugly octagon church, till she came to the school house. ' If I don't feel tempted to box one of the children's cars before it's over, it will be a wonder,' she thought; then, opening the. door, passed into the hot, stuffy atmosphere, where about a hundred children were assembled, and the business of the day begun. Ina made her way to her own desk, and sat down with something of a sigh. What last Sunday's lesson had been about, she had totally forgotten. She nodded to the children generally, and then, as her eyes fell on one of them she knew personally, she made the little girl a sign to come to her."], [103, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 79 ' How is your mother, Maggie?' she asked. ' Better to-day, thank you, Miss,' dropping a little curtsey as she spoke. ' Does the Doctor come every day ? ' ' Yes, Miss, thank you, Miss.' ' Tell her I will come and see her very soon. I should have been before, only I haven't been very well. And, Maggie \u2014 ' ' Yes, Miss.' ' What was the lesson I set you for this afternoon ? ' Please, Miss, you didn't set no lesson, Miss.'

' Oh ! that will do, thank you, Maggie. And don't forget to tell your mother what I told you about coming to see her. You can go back to your seat.' The little girl dropped another curtsey be fore turning away, and Ina began hunting in"], [104, "80 CATHEDRAL BELLS. her desk for a Bible ; she felt very cross at Miss Hopkins' selection. Long ago Ina had made a stand against teaching little children out of the Old Testament. ' I don't under stand half of it myself,' she had said, ' and I'm certain they can't. Besides, even if they could, what's the good of their knowing all about the Kings of Israel and Judah ? It's all very well for clergymen, but for these poor little brats \u2014 it's ridiculous ! If I can't teach them out of the Gospels, I won't teach them at all.' Ina had got her own way, as a young person who knows what she wants generally can ; but several of the other teachers had been greatly scandalised at the girl's sensible remarks. Miss Hopkins was one of these last. She herself had always taught out of the Old Testament ; besides which, she was jealous of the Rector's pretty daughter, and had known, when setting the lesson the previous Sunday, that it would annoy the girl, and, like the spiteful old maid that she was, had rejoiced thereat. Ina found her Bible at last, and began turning over the leaves till she came to the chapter she wanted. ' Adonizedec, King of Jerusalem! She thought to herself, as her eyes fell on the first verse, ' What ridiculous non sense to set children of ten I ' ' Wherefore"], [105, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 81 A-idonizedec, King of Jerusalem, sent unto Holiam, King of Hebron, and unto Piram, King of Jarmuth, and to JapJiia, King of Lackish, and to Debir, King of Eglon, saying, Come up to vie and bring help, that we may take Gibeon, because it hath gone over to Joshua and to tlie children of Israel.' The pretty pink flush which always mounted to the girl's cheeks when she was annoyed, came quickly then. Miss Hopkins had done it on purpose to vex her, just because she knew she hated to have such lessons set for her children, and the blue-grey eyes gave quite an angry little glance in the direction of the delinquent. School at St Mary's began at half-past three, and Ina had been ten minutes late in arriv ing, and now she had lost so much time talking to Maggie and thinking about Miss Hopkins, that she was surprised to hear the Cathedral clock striking four. Only half-an hour left, and she had not put a single question ! Through the half-open door leading into the boys' room, she could see Mr Romer moving about, and every now and then she caught the sound of his voice, but what he was saying she was unable to distinguish. All round her the other classes were in full swing, only hers was silent. 'And foshua F"], [106, "82 CATHEDRAL BELLS. smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen even unto GibeonA Ina's eyes fell on the closing verses, and her annoyance increased. She would not hear the children their lesson that day ! Until the clock struck half-past four she would sit in silence at her desk, and they could stay silently on their forms, but not one word of what Miss Hopkins had set them to learn would she ask them. It was very warm and close in there. She looked to see if the windows up in the roof were open. Yes, as much air as could come in from the hot silent street outside was doing so. Phew ! how baking it was. And how \u2014 well \u2014 how very disagreeable was the smell of cheap pomade on some of the children's heads, to say nothing of the smell of pepper mint from some unknown quarter near her ! The time seemed very long to the girl, sitting there with the warm flush of annoy ance on her cheeks, while the poor little children round fidgeted, wondering why on earth they were not to be asked any ques tions about the long hard names, which some of the more industrious among them had been at such pains to get up. Ina was just wonder ing when it would be half-past four, when she became suddenly aware that the Rev. James"], [107, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 83 Romer was standing not very far off, looking at her and her class in no little astonishment. She scarcely knew why, but somehow she was vexed that he should see her sitting there idle, and yet she was too proud to begin the lesson Miss Hopkins had set to annoy her. Besides, it wanted only five minutes to the time when school would be over for the day. No, she would do nothing ; and if it ever happened again, she would give up her class once and for all. The teachers round were setting the tasks for next Sunday ; Mr Romer was still looking at her and her scholars in surprise. She couldn't go on sitting there in absolute silence. ' Maggie,' she said to her little friend, ' what was the chapter I set you to do the Sunday before last ? ' ' Please, Miss, the fourth of John, Miss.' ' Then take the next chapter for next time.' ' Please, Miss,' from a little girl on the left, a most proper-looking little girl, with her hair plastered so close to her head that it quite hurt one to look at it. 'Yes?' Ina answered. ' The next chapter of John, Miss, or Joshua, Miss?' ' St John, of course,' answered the girl, and raising her voice for the benefit of Miss"], [108, "84 CATHEDRAL BELLS. Hopkins, who was standing near. ' You know perfectly well that I never set you lessons from the Old Testament. It's a great deal too difficult for you to understand. If ever I am away again, and a lesson should be set you in it. you are to say that I object to it for you, and that I wish something given you out of the Gospels. That will do. You may go now.' Away clattered the children out of the close, hot, stuffy schoolroom into the pure air out- side, making the silent street resound with their noise, while the sunshine came floating in through the open doors, and causing the dusty, whitewashed room to look almost pretty. Ina was some little time arranging the con- tents of her desk. She had not been there for a fortnight, and someone, probably last Sunday, had tumbled everything over in looking for the class list. When she rose to go, she found the place empty. Mr Romer was standing at the door with the key in his hand, ready to lock up. The girl nodded her little head at him as she passed out into the glare of the summer sunshine, and went quietly on up the street. She had nearly reached her father's church. Mr Strong took the whole service himself in the afternoons, and she was listen ing to the congregation singing\u2014"], [109, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 85 ' If some poor wandering child of Thine Have spurned to-day the voice divine, Now, Lord, the gracious work begin, Let him no more lie down in sin,' when the sound of someone running made her look round. She guessed who it was even be fore she saw him. ' How do you do ? ' Mr Romer asked, or rather panted, eagerly. 'The key was so stiff I couldn't get it to lock. I was afraid you would be out of sight before I got it done, and I wanted to catch you.' ' Watch by the sick, enrich the poor, With blessings from Thy boundless store ; Be every mourner's sleep to-night, Like infant's slumber, pure and light.' ' How pretty the singing sounds ! ' Ina said, not inquiring why the Curate was so particularly anxious to see her. 'Yes \u2014 yes, very pretty. And that hymn is one I like so much. Don't you ? Perhaps, though, I like it because she was so fond of it. I read it to her on one of these last evenings,' he added, after a little pause, and in rather a husky tone, glancing as he spoke at the house next the church, where he lodged, and where his old mother had lived with him ever since they first came to Carswell. There was a card in the window of the room in which she had died \u2014 ' To let, furnished.'"], [110, "86 CATHEDRAL BELLS. ' I can understand your liking it,' Ina an swered, and then for a few minutes the pair walked on in silence. Presently the Curate spoke again. 'Didn't \u2014 didn't your class know their tasks this afternoon, Miss Strong?' ' I didn't trouble to find out,' the girl an swered rather shortly, her annoyance coming back to her as she spoke. And why did the man say ' tasks ? ' Why couldn't he say lessons, just like anybody else? ' Didn't trouble ! ' in an amazed voice. ' That's \u2014 that's very unlike you.' No answer. ' I'm afraid \u2014 afraid you must have been feeling unwell. The room was so very close. I thought so at the time. I didn't like to say anything , then before the children, because I know \u2014 know how sensitive you are, and how you always bear everything so well. I wish now I had done so. I could so easily have asked Miss Hopkins to take your class with hers. I know she would have been pleased \u2014 more than pleased, to oblige you.' ' I don't know anything she would dislike much more,' Ina returned, getting rather pink. ' What \u2014 taking your class ! Impossible. She said herself this morning that very likely you wouldn't be equal to coming to the schools to-"], [111, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 87 day, in this heat, and should she do your work for you, as she knew you were delicate, and \u2014 ' ' I'm not delicate ! ' exclaimed Ina, now really angry. And as the girl, in common with many other young people, had only suffered during the previous winter from the severe cold, her annoyance was, I think, excusable. ' Not delicate ! ' echoed Mr Romer, ' oh, I think you are \u2014 oh, I beg your pardon for con tradicting you, and I know it must sound very rude, but \u2014 but what I mean is \u2014 well, that you are often \u2014 often ailing.' 'I'm not often ailing,' broke in Ina. 'Just because I am not an absolute cart-horse like Miss Hopkins, and occasionally catch cold or have a headache, it's to be spread all over the town that I'm dying ! Upon my word, it's too bad ! The wish is father to the thought with her, I expect.' ' With her- \u2014 with whom ? ' in a tone of amazement. ' With that odious woman \u2014 Miss what's-her name \u2014 Hopkins.' Mr Romer looked down in dismay at his companion. ' Oh \u2014 oh, indeed I think you wrong her,' he answered nervously. Hitherto he had always respected the lady in question, but at his companion's words he"], [112, "88 CATHEDRAL BELLS. became conscious of a feeling of antipathy towards Miss Hopkins. It is wonderful how weak the best of men are when the woman they love is concerned. Mr Romer was per fectly aware that if it had been anyone else but Ina who had uttered the above, he would have been able to throw the proper amount of reproof into his reply. As it was, his protest \u2022was of the very mildest kind, and he knew it. Nothing but an earnest desire to do his duty would have led him to utter it on this occasion. ' I'm sure I do not wrong her,' Ina returned. The girl was feeling hot and tired, and she knew that Miss Hopkins had set that lesson out of the Old Testament simply and solely to annoy her. To do Ina justice, I may just as well state that her surmise was perfectly correct. ' I don't wrong her. She knows quite well \u2014 how can she help knowing, after all that fuss last year? \u2014 that I object to setting little children of ten lessons out of the Old Testa ment. It's ridicidous ! If it's ever done again, just because I happen to have a headache, I will give up the school once and for all. I daresay, though, you would be rather glad if I did ? ' She knew he wouldn't be anything of the kind in reality, but, being upset and tired, she felt inclined for a little flattery. ' Glad ! Oh, Miss Strong ! When you"], [113, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 89 know \u2014 must know how much it is \u2014 that is \u2014 checking himself in time \u2014 ' that is \u2014 I mean \u2014 that, of course, if you wish to retire \u2014 then \u2014 yes, exactly \u2014 I should not stand in the way \u2014 though you must allow me to say it would be a great disappointment to me. I hope \u2014 I hope, Miss Strong, you won't think of it ? ' ' If that horrid creature is ever again allowed to set my class \u2014 ' Ina began. ' Indeed she shall not,' broke in the Curate. ' If you should be absent again, then I will myself set the tasks for the next Sunday. And I will hear the class their lesson, too.' Mr Romer. as a rule, never took any one but the boys. What a thing it is to be a pretty girl ! There is hardly anything one wants that one cannot get. 'Thanks.' Only that one word, but the little grateful look the girl shot at him sent a thrill of rapture through him. Then it passed away, and his heart seemed to go down into his boots. He had remembered something he had a moment before made up his mind it was his duty to say. Could he say it ? He thought of the gentle look, the sweet smile which but a moment before had made him so happy, and which had hardly yet died away from the girl's face. They went on in"], [114, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 90 silence through deserted Crossgates and down Smith Street, and were nearly at the Arch leading into the Close, and still he could not bring himself to utter the words. And yet it was his duty. He must do it. He cleared his throat nervously, began, and then stopped. Ina knew as well as possible he had got something to say which he did not like. Well, if he was going to do it, he must do it quickly, James thought. He must do without any more gentle looks, \u2014 must be content to be regarded by his idol as a hard, ungrateful wretch. 'Miss Strong.' ' Yes.' ' You \u2014 you won't be offended at what I am going to say ? ' ' That depends entirely, Mr Romer, on what it is,' with a little light of amusement dancing in the soft eyes. The girl's ill - humour, never a lasting affair, was passing quickly away, and she felt kindly towards her companion. The Curate was always a ludicrous person to her, but at the same time it is difficult not to have a certain amount of regard for a being who regards one with profound devotion. Besides, the girl had always respected the man from the day she had first heard him preach in her father's church. Pure and full of goodness herself, she was filled"], [115, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 91 with high moral purpose. Her standard for a man was certainly lofty, but when she met with one whom she believed to be true and unselfish in his life, she gave him no slight respect. For Mr Romer, as I have said, she had a sincere admiration, and the knowledge that he loved her, pleased her. The girl was ever full of diffidence, and at times, especially when a little out of sorts, inclined to believe herself destitute of all goodness. In these moments, the idea that one so rich in moral characteristics as the Curate admired and cared for her, was the only thing which pre vented Ina from believing herself utterly worth less. ' But if \u2014 if, Miss Strong, I am only going to say it because I think it \u2014 ' Mr Romer came to a dead stop. ' Think it your duty ? ' Ina broke in. ' I hope it's not going to be anything absolutely horribly odious. I generally notice that when people are going to say something particu larly disagreeable, they begin by calling it a duty.' ' I'm \u2014 I'm afraid it is disagreeable.' Oh dear, if he might only let the matter drop ! It would be so easy to do so. And if he spoke, perhaps it would hurt her, and that would be worse than anything."], [116, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 92 ' Well, go on with it, please, if you must say it,' Ina replied. ' I suppose it's something about my having wasted the whole afternoon in school. Do make haste. I hate having a thing hanging over my head, like that man papa talks about \u2014 Damo \u2014 Damo something.' ' Damocles,' suggested the Curate mildly, and thankful even for this trifling delay. ' Yes, Damocles. Please go on.' ' Well, I was sorry the class did nothing, but it wasn't so much that I was going to speak about as \u2014 as the real cause of their doing no thing.' Miss Hopkins. Well, what about her ? ' ' No, nothing about answered meekly.

It was the first time in all his life Mr Romer had ever even hinted that anything the girl did was not absolute perfection. A hot flush came over Ina's sweet face, and the lower lip trembled with mortification. She walked on through the Arch in silence, on into the still, quiet Close. ' Don't \u2014 don't you think it would have been better if you had conquered that little piece of pride, and heard them something of the lesson ? ' No answer. The girl hurried on towards the ivy-covered lane which led up to the quaint old house in which she lived, and the Curate paced beside her, looking down at her, and hoping for a glance of forgiveness. Pre sently they reached the corner where they were accustomed to separate after afternoon school. ' Good-bye,' said the girl shortly, turning away. ' Good-bye. Miss Strong ? ' ' Well,' very shortly this time. ' Won't \u2014 won't you shake hands ? ' Ina stopped. She was looking her very best just then, with the colour mantling in"], [118, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 94 her cheeks. Presently the blue-grey eyes were lifted and the laughing look came back at the sight of the Curate's woe-begone face. ' I'll do so,' she said, ' on one condition.' ' And that ? ' he asked eagerly. ' That you will own you are sorry for what you said just now.' ' But I \u2014 I am not \u2014 I cannot. I am only sorry I had to say it,' he answered nerv ously. Ina turned, and without a word went up the lane between the ivy-covered walls. Pre sently the door of St Mary's Rectory was reached, and the girl turned her pretty face, all flushed with vexation, to him. ' I won't ask you to tea,' she said. ' It's Sunday, and Mr Mackinnon always comes, and I know you do not care for him.' Mr Mackinnon was a partner in the local bank, an ardent admirer of Ina's, and the man whom the poor Curate most feared. After this parting shot the girl disappeared into the house, and Mr Romer was left alone outside in the silent Close. What a fine thing it is to do one's duty ! Yes, but it is not always an unmixed pleasure. Certainly James had not found it so that afternoon."], [119, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 95 Service at St Mary's was at half-past six on Sunday evening, and in return for the Rector's complacency concerning afternoon church, the Curate generally had the pleasure of conduct ing all the devotions himself. The Sunday of which I am writing was no exception to this arrangement. Occasionally \u2014 about once in three months \u2014 Ina graced evening service with her presence. She had not been for a long time, poor Mr Romer thought, as he put on his surplice in the vestry, while the old clerk prosed on with some story the purport of which his listener completely sailed to catch. Was she vexed with him still? he wondered. If she should be in her seat in church he should look upon it as a good sign, \u2014 should regard it as a token that he was forgiven. Then the organ in the gallery pealed, and the Curate made his way, in a procession of one, to the lofty, old-fashioned reading-desk. He looked eagerly towards the Rector's pew. Yes, there was a bonnet in it! His heart gave a great leap, and then sank within him as the dismal fact came home to him that the owner of the bonnet was only Mrs Strong. And then, as he rose from his knees, and was turning to open the book in front of him, the horrible idea struck him, what if Mr Mackinnon was still at the Rectory?"], [120, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 96 All through the psalms, all through the first lesson, which was no other than the stirring history of David and Goliath of Gath, the thought would obtrude itself.

He found it, however, a difficult task, and it was with a feeling of intense satisfaction that, just as the clock was striking eight, he closed his sermon and prepared to descend the pulpit steps. It was pleasant out in the dusky twilight, the Curate thought, as he stepped forth into the silent street, leaving Hudnot, the clerk, to lock up the church. He still kept the parlours in the old lodgings next to St Mary's, and he usually went in to eat his supper directly service was over; but that Sunday he did not feel inclined for it. He would let it wait, and went on past the Livery Stables, through ' Crossgates South,' away across the Railway to the Canal.

But James Romer was not going to visit anybody that night. He went on, now and then exchanging a word with some of the bargees he knew, but not stopping to talk. The Canal population were a rough lot, and it was not considered very safe to be down there after dark ; but the Curate was a privileged person. It was not that the bargees were fond of the clerical element \u2014 quite the contrary! \u2014 but it was understood that Mr Romer was a different sort of person to those clergymen who lived in great houses in the Close, and had footmen to wait on them. That the Curate possessed a salary of ninety pounds a year was well known, and the fact that he was willing, as long as he had a shilling in his pocket, to share it with them, was also fully comprehended. Sometimes he hadn't a shilling left, and then he told them so quite truthfully. I don't know that any of them thought the worse of him for being in that plight occasion ally.

Somehow he seemed always to be thinking about her now. To be sure, he had been doing that for a long time past. It appeared to him that he had thought of her always, ever since he had first seen her, when she had been in short petticoats, and wore her hair hanging down her back. How sweet she had looked that day, standing under the trees in her father's garden, \u2014 how sweet she always looked. He would be a happy man who should win her! He went on down the deserted Towing-path. The night was warm, and he took off his hat, and walked along with it under his arm. The stars were shining brightly overhead. Was she still angry with him ? How lovely she had looked with that flush of vexation on her face ! Was that fellow Mackinnon with her then ? He hated the fellow, \u2014 mistrusted him, \u2014 loathed his smooth face, pointed features, and penetrating eyes. What right had he to hate and mistrust any man, much less one of whom he knew"], [125, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 99 nothing? Why should he disbelieve him, be cause, when he had gone to the banker for assistance to this or that charity, he had always received the same answer \u2014 that he had too many private calls upon him. But if this was true, how was it the man was able to give to anything which published a list of subscribers in the Carswell Gazette. He had no right, though, to judge this man, James told himself. Still, he hoped the girl would never marry him. It was quite likely though. People had been talking about it for a long time. It would be a suitable match, too, for her. Yes, they said so \u2014 the world \u2014 the little world of Carswell, that is. He did not think so. He would rather she married any one else. He would rather see her going to the altar with some of the big bargee fellows, than with that smooth tongued banker. Ah, there he was at it again ! And Ina would marry one day. It was not likely that men would be inclined to pass so much sweetness by without coveting it. He himself coveted it, he knew that. What a fool he was to think of such a thing \u2014 he a Curate, with no prospect of ever getting a living \u2014 without one farthing of his own beyond what he earned.

He to think of such a thing ! And when Ina married \u2014 Mr Romer stopped to think. What would life be like if she did so marry \u2014 life, to him ? Why, everything would be over, that was all. In the dark, still night, standing there by the silent water, the full knowledge of what this girl was to him came home to him. Why, it was Ina that made life worth living. It was the knowledge that she was near him that made the sunshine seem bright and cheerful when he woke in the morn ing. And suppose \u2014 suppose this miracle came to pass and she did become his wife \u2014 what then ? Life would be bliss indeed in that case. He stood still as this thought came to him, and, looking up at the bright stars, asked the Maker of them to give him this girl's love. But a moment ago, and he had been laughing at him self for dreaming of such a thing, and now \u2014 now he was praying for it ! He did not mind how long he waited. Jacob had waited seven years for Rachel. He would be willing to wait twice that for his Rachel. It was impossible. No, nothing was impossible to Him whom he served. Waves, greater than those of the Red Sea, were being held back, day by day, from His chosen people. The arm of the Lord was"], [127, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 101 not shortened. If God should give him the desire of his heart, then would he serve Him in thanksgiving all the days of his life. And if not \u2014 why, if not this life was not all. He would labour on, and in heaven he would see her. He must be content to wait in that case also. ' I will win her love if so be it pleaseth Him,' he thought, looking up at the bright stars overhead. Then he turned homeward, but before he did so he went round by the Close, \u2014 round by the ivy-covered walls and the quaint house nestling under the shadow of the grey Cathedral. The night was still, and the air heavy with the scent of the sweetbriar and jessamine. He would like to have lingered there till midnight, but feared to be noticed. ' God's angels be about her,' he said to himself. Then he crept down the silent path \u2014 crept, in his creaking shoes and with his white socks showing clearly in the pale, silvery moonlight \u25a0 \u2014 \u2022 home to his stuffy lodgings and his cold meat."], [128, "CHAPTER V. 1 Parks of oak and chestnut shady, Parks and ordered gardens great ; Stately homes of lord and lady, Built for pleasure and for state.' Lord of Burleigh. ANOTHER glorious day ! What delicious weather they were having, Ina thought, as, at about half past one, she found herself being driven through the park at Stackfield. All around rose the mighty elms and cedars, while here and there she caught a glimpse of antlers rising amid the grass and fern. A haze hung round the horizon, and the heat was so great that the girl was thankful when at last the fly came to where the trees clustered so thickly that it was dark and pleasant after the blinding sun shine of the open park. She hadn't much time, however, to enjoy it, for almost immedi ately they came out again into the open, and there was the great pile of castellated buildings, with the flag waving from one of the pointed turrets, and directly afterwards they were at the door. ' I'm afraid you must have had a very hot"], [129, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 103 drive, Miss Strong,' Lady Stackallan said kindly, when her young guest was shown into the morning-room. The Marchioness was alone, resting in an easy-chair, with a copy of Principal Tulloch's sermons on her lap, but she rose and gave the girl a pleasant greeting. ' It was rather warm,' Ina answered, looking round the lofty room, so cool and luxurious. How nice to live in lofty rooms, she thought. ' Yes ; but then you young people never mind heat. Do sit down \u2014 just move the easel \u2014 so ! Yes, an excellent likeness. Her Majesty gave it me herself, so I am very proud of it. As I was saying, though, I don't think heat tries you young ones as it does us elderly folk. I'm sure yesterday my children were playing tennis when I could hardly move. It was as much as I could do to even knit ! Do you knit ? ' ' N \u2014 no. I'm afraid, Lady Stackallan, that I like doing pretty things best \u2014 fancy work, I mean.' Her companion smiled. ' I daresay,' she said. ' Once I too liked fancy work, but now \u2014 now it is different. Unless I'm working it for a present for a friend, T don't care for anything which is not of use to my poorer neighbours. Ah, here"], [130, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 104 is my daughter \u2014 the one you don't know, I think. Mary, my dear, this is Miss Strong.' Lady Mary was a very tall, very thin girl of about six-and-twenty, not in the least handsome, but possessing a fine figure, and having about her an air of distinction. She was remarkably clever, and generally passed the whole morning in her father's library, assisting him in his work. Mr Welbore, Lord Stackallan's private secretary, lived, I believe, in positive terror of her. ' I know you very well by sight,' she said. as she took the girl's hand. ' I did not know who you were, but I have often seen you in the High Street. What a promenade it is, is it not ? One seems to meet all Carswell there.' ' Yes, I think one ' does,' Ina answered, after which there was a pause till the booming sound of the gong announced luncheon. ' How do you do ? I'm awfully glad you have come, and awfully sorry Beatrice and I were both out when you arrived. We were down at the stables, and my watch has stopped, and hers doesn't go. I suppose that is why she is late now. Oh, here she is ! ' and Lord Rossmere gave the girl's hand a final squeeze before seating himself beside her."], [131, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 105 ' Very pleased to see you, Miss Strong,' said her host. Lord Stackallan, who looked the English statesman, was a short, stout man, with grey hair and a fresh healthy counten ance. ' It's not often anybody comes out from Carswell to see us, so I hope you have brought all the news. In my father's time we used to be au fait with all that was on the tapis, but somehow I seem to have lost sight of people who used to give one information about what was going forward.' ' I don't think anything ever does go for ward,' Ina answered, laughing. ' Carswell is always more than half asleep. The silence of the Close is typical of our lives.' ' How nice ! I envy you. I wish there wasn't quite so much movement in other places.' Lord Stackallan was a Whig of the old school, and, it was well known, did not by any manner of means approve of the fussy activity of the Radical wing of the Liberal party. ' I suppose though,' he went on, ' it's the order of the day, and one must resign oneself to the inevitable. Tell me, how do you like your new Dean ? ' ' Oh, very much ; but it's not fair to ask me. Your son,' with a laughing look in her eyes, ' your son knows him so much better than I do !'"], [132, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 106 ' Know him ! I should think I did.' 'You should have seen him, Lady Beatrice, at the garden party last week,' Ina continued. ' He was so frightened, he could hardly talk sense whenever Dr Skelton came near.' ' Does he ever talk it ? ' Lady Mary asked, a little sarcastically. ' All right,' retorted Lord Rossmere. ' You wait till you want something done. See if I don't pay you out for that! By-the-bye, father, I quite forgot to tell you before. I had a message from the Bishop. He wanted to see you about the Orphan Asylum, \u2014 told me to ask you to let him know when he could do so.' ' Ah, I suppose his Reverence guessed that such a youth wasn't to be trusted very far, for he wrote for an appointment. I rode over and saw him on Saturday afternoon. Dear me ! it's very extraordinary how that Asylum seems to breed ill-feeling. Does every Com mittee quarrel in Carswell, Miss Strong, or is it only that one unfortunate Board?' 'Oh, it's a little way we have,' Ina answered, with a smile. ' We always quarrel over every thing. It's the one thing we do, and it pre serves us from utter stagnation. You oughtn't to grudge us our pet little naughtiness, Lord Stackallan, especially as it blows over after-"], [133, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 107 wards, and we don't bear each other any permanent ill-will.' ' Oh, of course, if you like it. I confess myself I prefer to do what I have to do, without threatening to break the heads of those with whom I am acting. But, then, every one to his own taste.' ' I'm like Miss Strong,' broke in Rossmere, ' I like a row.' Then every one laughed, and Lady Mary, feeling the conversation was becoming too frivolous, turned it by asking her father's opinion on an article on Irish Land Tenure which had just appeared in the Nineteenth Century, and which had attracted a good deal of attention in the thinking world. Luncheon went on. The canvas blinds were lowered outside the windows, and the light came in in a gentle, tempered way, while the tall, powdered servants moved noiselessly about, and Ina found the iced claret cup very refresh ing after her hot drive. What a different sort of life it was from that which she herself knew at home. Seen once in a way it was pleasant enough, but to last always \u2014 well, she wasn't quite sure that it would not end by boring her dreadfully. She liked Lady Beatrice and her tiny, gentle, kindly hostess, as well as Lord Stackallan, but about Lady Mary she wasn't"], [134, "108 CATHEDRAL BELLS. sure. How very tall she was ! And how could she have come to know all she was talking about. She would listen a little and try to improve her own mind, and perhaps in time she herself would be able to speak in the same learned way. ' He can hardly have fully studied the compensation for disturbance clause in the Act he speaks of, or he would have treated that part of his subject differently,' Lady Mary re marked at that moment, and Ina abandoned then and for ever the idea of making any attempt to understand the Irish Land Question. She turned away from the tall girl and looked at the honest, sunburnt face of the boy beside her. How nice he was, and pleasant to look at too, only she wished he wouldn't stare at her so. She was afraid Lady Stackallan would notice it. Then the meal came to an end and the party rose from the table. ' Come out on to the lawn ! ' Lord Rossmere exclaimed eagerly, as the girl prepared to follow the ladies across the large and well-appointed hall. ' Beatrice wants to show you the green houses and the garden, and I want to take you over the stables.' ' But won't Miss Strong find it very hot out of doors ? ' Lady Mary asked, pausing with her hand on the door of her father's library. ' I should think she would much sooner sit quietly"], [135, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 109 in mamma's room than go out in that sun directly after luncheon.' ' Oh, I don't mind the heat,' Ina answered, ' that is, not much, and I should like to see it all.' ' Of course, if you like it, that is different,' and then Lady Mary's tall figure disappeared into the Lord Stackallan's sanctum, and the younger members of the party were left alone. ' I'll run and get my hat. Take Miss Strong on, Ross ! ' exclaimed Lady Beatrice, and the next minute Ina found herself stand ing under the great shady cedars on the soft lawn. 'I'm so awfully, awfully glad you have come. I was so afraid it was going to rain last night, or that something would prevent your coming over to-day. Directly I was awake this morning I jumped out of bed and looked out of the window. I zuas pleased when I saw it was going to be an other lovely day.' ' It's very kind of you to care about my visit, I'm sure,' Ina answered demurely. ' I assure you I was looking forward to it also ; ' then noticing a rather too satisfied look on her companion's face, a mischievous demon came to her, and she went on, \u2014 ' I have often driven through the Park, but I have never"], [136, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 110 been up near the house before, at least, not near enough to see the gardens properly, you know, and I want to do that.' ' Well, you are a girl ! ' exclaimed Rossmere, half laughing, half cross. ' You might have left that last part out, I declare. Of course I thought you meant you were looking for ward \u2014 well \u2014 that is, I mean, I didn't know you only wanted to come because of the garden. If I had known it, I wouldn't have told you about my getting out of bed and looking out of the window.' The pretty eyes danced with fun at the boy's manner. ' Never mind,' she said, casting down her eyelids demurely as she spoke. ' If I had been looking forward to \u2014 to seeing anything else besides the gardens, I shouldn't have said so \u2014 I never say civil things. When you know me better you will understand that I am sometimes horribly rude, and that I get into scrapes in consequence.' ' I don't believe a word of it. I don't believe you ever say anything rude, and I'm certain no one could \u2014 ' ' Don't,' broke in Ina ; ' don't pay me silly compliments. There is nothing I dislike so much. I always hate people who do it. I don't mind very, very pretty speeches, but"], [137, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 111 they have to be so carefully framed that it is only one person in a hundred who ever succeeds in quite satisfying me.' The boy stopped and looked at her. They were standing under the shade of the great trees, and the sunlight fell softly on the girl's fair face. ' I will never pay you a silly compliment again,' he said earnestly. ' I don't know what I should do if you hated me.' ' Hate me back, probably,' Ina returned. ' I shouldn't \u2014 I couldn't \u2014 I should \u2014 ' ' Take care ! ' cried the girl, in a warning voice, and trying to conquer the laughter she knew was in her eyes. ' You are on danger ous ground.' ' Bother ! Well, I won't say what I was going to say. Come and sit down on this bench,' catching hold of her hand and drag ging her towards it. ' I hope the green stuff won't come off on my frock,' Ina said, looking down suspiciously at the wooden seat. ' If it does, I shall scold you,' trying to disengage her hand. Lord Rossmere let it go very reluctantly, then he threw himself on the soft grass at her feet. 'Isn't it jolly?' he said, looking up at her with his honest, sunburnt face. ' What time are you going ? '"], [138, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 112 ' I should like to know who is a civil person now ? Your sister was kind enough to pro mise to drive me home at half-past three, but I daresay she wouldn't mind going before, particularly as you seem so anxious to get rid of me. I suppose you are one of those who speed the parting guest ? ' ' What a tease you are ! ' exclaimed the boy. 'You know quite well I didn't mean anything of the kind. I meant must you go to this tennis ? Don't. Stay and have tea here, and then Beatrice will drive you home afterwards when it's cooler, and I will ride beside the carriage.' Ina shook her head, though, if the truth be told, the proposal was not without attraction. Her life was rather a lonely one. Her father was almost always in his study, and when in society rarely spoke, while her mother, devoted as she was to her, was much preoccupied with household affairs and parish matters. The girl had found it very pleasant, even in that short time, to listen to Lady Beatrice's merry laugh, and to hear her and her brother joke together. She contrasted the stillness of her life with theirs, and, in so doing, told herself that companions of her own age would mean much to her. How often she had wished for a brother. And how nice it would be to see"], [139, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 113 a good deal of the boy who was then lying at her feet. He seemed to have taken a wonderful fancy to her. And the girl was one who liked that people should care for her and make much of her. He had done more than merely take a fancy. Ina could see that. He was in love with her just at present, but then he was only a boy, little more than nine teen, so she need not trouble herself about that. In six months' time he would probably be confiding to her, in a brotherly way, his love for some other divinity. Then the girl's train of thought was broken in upon by the boy's voice. ' Well, are you going to stay till after tea?' ' I'm afraid I mustn't. I promised mamma to be at Archdeacon Maycott's at half-past four, so I must not disappoint her. Besides, your mother would be tired of me if I stayed till then.' ' No, she wouldn't. She doesn't mind, so long as we are happy. I'm awfully glad I'm not going back to town with them to-morrow. A week ago ' \u2014 looking up with a blush and a half shy look on his boyish countenance \u2014 ' a week ago I was dying to go, but now \u2014 now I'm glad to be left behind. I wish, though, they were stopping too,' nodding H"], [140, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 114 his head in the direction of the great house visible through the elm branches, ' because then you could have come over here. You wouldn't be allowed to come and lunch with me alone ? ' Ina's merry laugh rang out in the clear summer air. ' Ask mamma,' she said. ' Perhaps she might say \" yes,\" you say. Well, of course, she might, but then, on the other hand, you know, she mightn't. I wouldn't mind having a bet what her answer would be. I can see her looking at you when you proposed it,' going off into another laugh. ' No ; I know she wouldn't,' the boy an swered. ' I was only joking. I shall come and see you often. I may, mayn't I ? Do you ride ? ' ' No ; because I haven't a horse. That is rather against riding, you must admit.' ' I'll lend you one of mine, and we'll have a gallop of an evening through the Park and over the Downs.' Ina shook her head. ' I can't accept your offer,' she said, rising from her seat, while Lord Rossmere struggled up and stood beside her. ' Shall I tell you why? Stoop down a little so that not even a gardener may hear \u2014 I shouldn't dare to,"], [141, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 115 for fear of throwing the animal down and breaking his knees.' The boy whistled. ' Can't you ride ? ' he asked compassionately. ' Oh, yes, I can do that ; but it's one thing to trot along the highroad on a quiet pony, and another to ride across country on some body else's horse.' ' Yes ; all the same, sooner or later, you will ride with me. I mean \u2014 that is, I'm sure we are destined to be great friends. Aren't we ? ' 'What makes you think so?' Ina asked, looking at her companion. ' I think so because I want it. Directly I saw you that day under the trees at the Deanery, I wanted it. Will you be my great \u2014 great \u2014 greatest friend?' holding out his hand. ' It's too soon to say,' Ina answered, with a little smile. 'You mayn't like me when you know me better. And perhaps I sha'n't like you. We had better make it conditional, as one takes a servant on a month's trial. Why, what's the matter ? ' for the boy had turned away with a flushed face and an impatient stamp of the foot. ' If you don't care about being friends, I'm sure I don't ! ' he exclaimed hotly."], [142, "116 CATHEDRAL BELLS. 'It's easy to comprehend how perfectly in different you are,' Ina returned, with one of her merry laughs. ' My dear boy, don't be cross. I didn't mean to offend you. Come, let's make it up, and swear eternal friendship.' The girl, as she spoke, held out one of her slim hands. Lord Rossmere seized it eagerly. ' Promise to be always my friend ! ' he ex claimed. ' I promise,' smiling at his eagerness. ' And I promise to be yours,' he answered, and then shyly, and half as though he was afraid of what he was doing, bent down and kissed the girl's hand. ' Like the knights of old,' he explained, looking up with a hot blush on his face. There was a silence for a minute, and then in the distance, near the house, they heard the sound of Lady Beatrice's voice calling to them. ' Here,' shouted Rossmere. ' Come and see the stables,' the girl said as she joined the pair. She guessed from her brother's face that he could have dispensed with her presence just then, but she had taken a quarter of an hour to put on her hat, and consequently felt that she had done all that could be expected of any one ; besides, she had taken a great fancy to Ina herself, and wanted"], [143, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 117 to see more of her. ' Come and see the stables,' she said again. The two made their way along the green lawn till they came to a gate in the grey stone wall which skirted the pleasure grounds. Rossmere opened it with some difficulty, for it was but little used, and then having made their way under a clump of great elms, came out at last in front of the entrance to the stables. The courtyard was deserted save for a big black retriever, who awoke the echoes of the silent place, and tried to break his chain in his endeavours to reach his master's side. Ina was taken up to be introduced. ' Isn't he a beauty ? ' the boy asked. ' Yes, indeed,' Ina answered, patting the creature's head, in return for a friendly lick. ' Have you any dogs of your own ?' 'One \u2014 a splendid little terrier. Some day you must be introduced to him. Every one says he's perfect.' ' And now come and see the ponies ! ' Lady Beatrice exclaimed. ' I'm dying to show them to you. I haven't had them very long. They are going to take you home by-and-by. We shall fly into Carswell like the wind.' Ina followed her friend across the yard. The ponies were a pair of thoroughbred roans,"], [144, "118 CATHEDRAL BELLS. an exact match, and well worthy of a visit. The girl, having inspected the pretty creatures, they condescended to eat sugar out of her hand, while one of them, rather ungratefully, sneezed all over her. 'Jack's dreadfully wanting in manners,' Lady Beatrice exclaimed. ' It's his one fault. I'm always trying to break him off the habit, but I can't. He always ends each conversa tion I have with him in exactly the same way. Well, shall we go and see the carriage horses ? ' The carriage horses lived on the opposite side of the yard, and were also well worth a visit. A pair of splendid greys among the number Ina knew well by sight, as they were the ones who always drew Lady Stack allan's carriage. After this was over there were the saddle horses to see, each in his loose box, and the young Earl sounded the yard bell, and would have his groom out in order that Ina might see everything there was to be seen. At last the man was dismissed back to his ease, and Lady Beatrice, her brother, and their guest began to retrace their steps across the stone quadrangle. ' I wish there was something else to show her,' Beatrice said ; and then suddenly, ' why, Ross, she hasn't seen the old coach ! '"], [145, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 119 ' Nor she has ! Would you like to see it?' ' What is it ? ' Ina asked. ' The coach \u2014 the old family coach. My father's grandfather and grandmother used to go to London in it, so you may judge of what it's like. It's the sort of thing Adam and Eve would have gone out to dinner in.' The girl laughed, and followed Lord Ross mere, while Lady Beatrice took her arm. ' I can't tell you how glad I am you came. Stackfield is so dull. The others don't care for visitors, and there's no one round \u2014 no one of my own age, I mean \u2014 whom I care to see. I do hope you will come over often when we come back ? And I shall come to you in Carswell \u2014 that is, if you'll have me?' ' Have you ! We shall be only too de lighted,' Ina answered. ' I shall be so glad, for though I know plenty of girls in Carswell, I haven't any real friends among them.' ' We are in the same boat, so nature evi dently intended us for allies,' Lady Beatrice answered, and then they reached the coach house door, and the conversation was at an end."], [146, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 120 ' Bother ! ' exclaimed Rossmere ; ' he's gone and locked it up.' ' Then we can't see it, that's all,' Lady Beatrice answered. ' Nonsense ! she shall see it if she wants to. I'll ring the bell and have him out' ' Good gracious, don't ! You know how cross he is!' JAVho is it?' Ina asked, amazed. y)\\d Phelps the coachman. He's been here all his life. He drove my father and mother home on their wedding-day ; he was here when my father was born, and once when he was about fourteen, and Phelps caught him doing something or another, he shook him. Isn't it true, Ross ? ' ' Ouite. Father's often told me about it.' ' But he must be very old ! ' Ina exclaimed. ' I have often seen him driving your mother, and he didn't look above sixty.' ' Oh, that's not Phelps \u2014 Phelps never drives any one now. That's Marks who drives the Mater \u2014 the jolliest old fellow in the world. Phelps is head coachman, and does nothing but bully every one all round. We'll have him out for the fun of the thing. Hi, you, sir,' to a stable boy with a bucket, ' is Mr Phelps in ? Send him here \u2014 tell him I want him.' ' Yes, my lord.'"], [147, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 121 A long time elapsed before the lad returned. He looked rather frightened, but there was a lurking grin on his countenance as he an nounced that Mr Phelps would be down directly. He went across the yard, and took up a good place in a doorway from which to see the fun. Another long pause. The sun was very hot, and Ina was just beginning to get very tired of waiting, when steps were heard, and from a back yard there appeared a little old man of between seventy and eighty years of age, thin as a whipping-post, and with a face on which the word 'sour' was distinctly written. ' Oh, Phelps, we want the key of this place. This young lady wants to see the old coach,' Lord Rossmere said. ' Key of the place, eh ? I don't know as I could lay my hand on the key just now. I ain't quite sure, my lord, as it's a good thing to keep on opening and shutting the place. I must speak to your papa about it.' Phelps always treated the young heir as if he were about ten years of age. ' Constant opening ! ' exclaimed the other, ris ing to the bait, for the old man dearly loved to annoy any one, and to tell a young man of nearly twenty, before a remarkably pretty girl, that you must speak to his ' papa ' before you"], [148, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 122 can do what he wishes is, it must be admitted, exasperating in the highest degree. ' Constant opening! What the \u2014 what the dickens do you mean ? The coach-house hasn't been open for me since last Christmas afternoon.' ' Well, if it ain't you, it's some one else, my lord.' ' Well, never mind who it is, Phelps. Get the key and open the place.' ' I ain't got no key, I tell you ' Where is it, then ? ' very angrily. ' Somewhere safe, my lord, I don't doubt. ' Safe ! Do you call it safe when you can't say where it is. By George, suppose the place was on fire, how then ? ' ' I can't suppose what ain't likely to happen, my lord, leastways not as long as I'm head of these stables.' Then as his eye fell on the youth with the bucket gazing on, he made a step towards him. ' What are you doing there, looking at your betters ? If I was a bit younger, I'd have given you some thing to remember,' as the lad fled from sight. ' Boys are very different from what they were in my day,' with a disparaging glance at the young Earl. ' Look here, Phelps. This young lady has come down to see the stables. If this door is not opened in about \u2014 '"], [149, ""], [150, "' WHY, I'LL SEE IF I CAN FIND A KEY AS WOULD FIT IT.'

Your papa, he's given me charge of these places, and I'm responsible to him, my lord, and no one else. Now, as this young lady's here, and as I shouldn't like to disappoint no young lady, above all not a young lady like this ' \u2014 Phelps was commonly reported to have been an ardent admirer of the fair sex in the days of his youth, and he turned an approving glance as he spoke on Ina's sweet face \u2014 ' why, I'll see if I can find a key as would perhaps fit it.' As he spoke he produced a key. Natur ally, as it was the right one which he had brought with him, it fitted exactly. ' What a curious old thing ! ' Ina exclaimed, as she stood in front of the coach with its enormous wheels and quaint hammer-cloth. ' And what a huge thing. Why, six people could have driven in it easily ! ' ' If he wasn't here we'd get inside,' whis pered Lady Beatrice. ' In old days, when we were children, we used to \u2014 only I never really enjoyed it, for fear Phelps should come and catch us. Do you see the drab lining ? Oh, it smells so disgusting you can't think ! Thank you, Phelps,' \u2014 aloud \u2014 'very much, Miss Strong likes it. Come on, you silly boy,' in a whisper again, as the sight of a"], [152, "i24 CATHEDRAL BELLS. very flushed face and an angry look in her brother's eyes warned her that the old coach man's muttered remarks were of a particularly annoying nature. 'Well,' said Ina, when they got out of the courtyard, ' I have enjoyed it all very much, above all, Phelps. I do hope \u2014 I do hope,' with a mischievous look in the lovely eyes, \u2022 that your \" papa \" won't be angry with you, Lord Rossmere, but I'm afraid if he listens to what that old gentleman says, he will.' The angry look faded away from the boy's face, and he burst out laughing. ' So long as he amused you, I don't mind ; otherwise, I own he does try me.' Then they reached the house and entered the hall. Lady Beatrice insisted on taking Ina to see her own room, while Lord Ross mere fussed and fumed, waiting for his divinity to return. Alas ! the pony carriage had come round to the door before the two girls had finished their chat and descended the stairs. Perhaps the disappointment which was so plainly written on the boy's face touched the girl, for she let her hand linger in his, and even returned his warm pressure. The young Lord stood on the steps watching the carriage as long as it was in sight."], [153, "CHAPTER VI. Shall I for this indulge complaint, Turn traitor and cry shame on life ? No ! Be my prayer, however faint, Lord, help me to live out my strife.' ' GOOD-BYE, and thank you so much for bring ing me.' The Cathedral clock was striking five, the bell for afternoon service had just stopped, and Ina spoke the above words holding Lady Beatrice's hand as she prepared to alight at Archdeacon Maycott's hospitable door. ' No thanks, please. I enjoyed the drive, only I wish you could have waited till it was cooler. Mind and come over and see us directly we come back at the end of next month.' Here Lady Beatrice gave a little crack with' her whip, and turning the ponies' heads towards home, started off. Another minute and Ina had lost sight of the little carriage and entered the house. ' My dear child, I thought you were never coming ! I have been waiting for you since"], [154, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 126 four o'clock. Every one has gone out on to the lawn !

' After luncheon they took me to see everything. Oh, mother, such lovely gardens ! \u2014 a perfect blaze of colour. And the stables! There are about twenty -six horses in them, and each horse has its name done in gold letters over the stall. We were quite an hour going through them, I should think. They were all so kind ; and Lady Stackallan told me to be sure and tell you she hoped you would come out and spend the day when they came back from London.' 'Very kind of her, I am sure. I wonder what makes them so very civil all of a sudden?' Ina was silent. Perhaps she guessed who it was in the first instance had caused them to be made so much of. She did not answer, but suggested instead that they should go out on to the lawn and look for their hostess. The gardens of the Chantry, and other residences on the south side of the Close, have beautiful lawns, which at their further \u25a0extremity slope up to the top of the old"], [155, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 127 boundary wall of the City, along which is a gravelled, or, in some cases, grassy path.

All the gardens are rich in trees, flowering shrubs, and shady nooks, and the thick grass is al most too velvety to please the votaries of tennis. Ina having said ' How do you do ? ' to Mrs Maycott, stood watching one of the many games of tennis which was going on near her. It was a very warm afternoon, more like August than June, and she felt rather glad that the sets had been made up before she arrived. She stood in the shade watching the balls flying, and listening to the voices of the players, and thinking about Stackfield, and Lady Beatrice, and her brother, till a step beside her made her look up. It was Mr Mackinnon, the junior partner in the firm of Hammer, Highlight, Festing & Company, Bankers, of High Street, Carswell. Mr Mackinnon was a tall, thin, rather Jewish looking man, with dark, lustrous eyes and very white teeth. It was impossible to deny that he was handsome, and yet it was not quite an agreeable face to every one. The young ladies of Carswell, however, as a rule, ardently admired him, and there was no small"], [156, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 128 amount of heart-burnings when it became known that the young banker was devoting himself to Miss Strong. The girl herself was not quite sure, at times, whether she really liked him. It amused her to see the jealous looks which mothers of marriageable daughters cast at her when the young banker appeared at her side, but there were hours in which she asked herself the question if he was wholly to her taste. It was only when she was apart from him that the girl was able to do this. In his society she fell under some unknown spell of fascination, and each time she was with him it seemed to increase, and her ability to analyse her feelings respecting him became less and less. During the last few weeks Mr Mackinnon's attentions had increased so much that people were beginning to ask whether something would not shortly come of it. The junior partner in the firm of Hammer, Highlight, Festing & Company was, as his name denotes, a Scotchman. At the time when he is first introduced to my reader, he was about thirty, and had been a resident in Carswell for the last nine years. Of his family, people knew nothing. When, nearly a decade before, Mr Highlight had died, he had answered the advertisement in the Times requiring a new"], [157, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 129 partner with a capital of ten thousand pounds ; and after some lengthy negotiations, and many very careful inquiries on the part of Mr Mackinnon's solicitor, things had been arranged. And since the day when the deed of partnership had been signed, Messrs Hammer, Highlight, Festing & Company (as they were still called) had had no reason to complain of their bargain. The new partner had not been many weeks in the bank before his colleagues discovered that whatever else he might be, he was a very clear-headed man of business. From the morning in which Mr Mackinnon had first taken his seat in the glass room of the bank, things had gone well with the firm, and it was whispered by lawyers, and one or two others of the ' know ing ones' in Carswell, that the young banker's investment was paying him at the rate of seven per cent. That he never, or hardly ever, spoke of his family, was nothing to any one. Beyond the bare fact that his father had been a physician, and was dead, and that he had some relatives living in Scotland, nothing more was known of him. Had Archdeacon Maycott been acquainted with the true state of the case, I doubt if he would have opened his doors quite so readily to the junior partner. Mr Mackinnon's father had been a success- I"], [158, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 130 ful Edinburgh physician, or rather, one who would have been successful had his life been prolonged. Dr Mackinnon having lived through the drudgery of his profession, had at last got together a fair practice, and was talking to his wife of how he meant, now that he could afford it, to insure his life and begin to put by, when he was smitten down by a sudden and deadly illness. A few weeks later and his widow found herself left with a son of sixteen, two rather delicate daughters, and a life annuity of two hundred and fifty pounds a year. Under the circumstances, she did the best she could. She gave her son a first-class education, and when, shortly after his twentieth birthday, the lad's godfather died leaving him a legacy of ten thousand pounds, she felt that her reward had come. The health of her two daughters had become more delicate, and their position, if aught should befal her, had long been a nightmare to poor Mrs Mackinnon. She proposed to her son that as soon as he was of age she should insure her life for the benefit of her girls, and that as it would cost about one hundred and fifty pounds a year to pay the premium on five thousand pounds, he should assist her to the amount of one hundred pounds annually."], [159, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 131 Gregory Mackinnon listened to the proposal without comment. He never committed him self to it in any way, but, to avoid the annoy ance of importunity, neither did he reject it. He waited till he was twenty-one, and then took the whole of his capital to purchase his share in the Carswell Bank. He left his widowed mother and sisters in Edinburgh, under the impression that as soon as he was fairly established he would make the neces sary allowance, and it was only when com fortably settled in his cosy rooms in West Street that he wrote saying, that he con sidered money passing between relatives a bad principle ; that he himself had to push his way in the world, and that he did not think the health of his sisters sufficiently delicate to prevent their doing the same, and that consequently he must decline his mother's proposal. Mrs Mackinnon wrote two indignant letters to her son, but as she received no reply the correspondence dropped, and the split between the young banker and his family became com plete. During the following nine years in which he had resided in Carswell, Mr Mac kinnon had seen or heard nothing of his relations. ' I was almost afraid you were not coming,'"], [160, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 132 the banker said, holding Ina's hand and look ing down at her where she stood in her pretty pink cotton frock. ' I was just going to give up waiting and take myself off to the Club, when I saw you emerge from the drawing room window. Too bad of you to come so late, especially as I left the Bank soon after three, much to my partners' disgust, and it was all on your account.' Ina looked up, and smiled. ' I hoped you would wait,' she said. ' I was lunching out, and didn't come with mamma. That was how I was late.' 'Where were you lunching?' 'At Stackfield.' ' Stackfield ! At Mr Malcolm's, I sup pose ? ' Mr Malcolm was the agent of the property. Ina did not answer. She did not wish to say anything about the Stackallans, for fear it should sound like swagger, so she held her tongue, and hoped the subject might drop. Vain idea, Mr Mackinnon was one of those people who like to know everything about everybody. ' Eh ? ' he said interrogatively, after pausing for the girl's answer. 'What?' asked Ina. 'Oh, look at that peacock. I didn't know the Archdeacon had"], [161, "'WHAT?' ASKED INA. ' OH, LOOK AT THAT PEACOCK.' Page 132."], [162, ""], [163, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 133 peacocks. I think it must have come in from the Deanery. They are very hand some, but I hate them because they scream so.' ' Yes, they do that. How are the Miss Malcolms?' ' Very well, I believe,' ' I thought I understood you to say you had been lunching there?' 'No.' 'At Stackfield itself?' Ina nodded, and Mr Mackinnon lifted his eyebrows. ' Something new,' he said. ' It's not often their High Mightinesses condescend to Cars well ; still ' \u2014 looking at the girl admiringly \u2014 ' I'm not surprised. This exception to their general rule does them credit.' The girl did not answer. A compliment, she was wont to declare, was a penal offence, but I fancy this did not apply if the person who uttered it was something of a favourite. ' Come and sit down,' the banker said, after a pause. ' Let's get away from the rest of the world. I want to talk to you, for I haven't seen anything of you for a week, except at yesterday's tea ; and that didn't count, for those Miss Mildmays took up your whole time. Come.'"], [164, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 134 The old spell of fascination was working in Ina, and she complied. Together the pair wandered away from the lawn tennis, and from the onlookers, to a shady nook, and there on a rustic bench they sat down. In the distance they could still see the players and the people who were watching, but they were too far off to be interrupted. 'And so you condescended to hope that I should wait, did you, Miss Ina ? ' Mr Mackinnon said, after a few minutes' silence, during which his dark eyes had been fixed on the girl's sweet face. ' It was weak of me to say that,' Ina answered, with a little laugh. ' You men are all quite vain enough without our doing anything to make you more so.' ' But you did hope it all the same ? ' not taking any notice of this attack upon his sex. ' Perhaps,' with rather a mischievous look. ' You know you did. You said so \u2014 unless it was a story.' I never tell stories,' putting on the little air of half-babyish innocence which she was won't to assume, and which gave her such an indescribable charm. 'Don't you really?' he said, bending over her. ' No ; I don't believe you do. What a"], [165, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 135 dear, good little girl it is. Child \u2014 for you are almost a child to me \u2014 you rouse my faith in humanity, \u2014 or you would if I saw much of you. I must see more of you. My time is almost wholly taken up with business cares, but somehow I must make a way.' Ina did not answer, but she looked up at him and smiled, and Mackinnon saw that the idea was not displeasing to her. ' Don't you get very tired of being shut up there in that dreary bank?' the girl asked, rather suddenly. ' Sometimes, yes ; but then I am working for a purpose,' laying a marked emphasis on the last word. ' Whether it will ever be accom plished I do not know, but the hope of it keeps me at my work.' Ina did not ask what the purpose was, though perhaps she guessed, or thought she did. A little flush came on her cheeks, and her eyes, which had been cast down, were listed, and travelled round in search of some thing to say. By - and - by they lighted on Canon Anson walking up and down a shady path by himself, and then something occurred to her. ' Are you going to the concert ? ' she asked. ' The concert ! What concert ? ' ' The one for the Orphan Asylum. Canon"], [166, "136 CATHEDRAL BELLS. Anson says he thinks it will be a success. There was great trouble over it. At the meet ing Mrs Smallpiece \u2014 she does give largely, I will say that for her \u2014 well, she asked in such an odd way how the money had been applied which had been obtained at last year's concert, that everybody was furious. Of course, there was nothing in the asking, only it was the way in which it was done. Canon Anson told mamma that if he had been the Treasurer he would have placed all the accounts before her and then resigned, unless she did so. Good gracious, there she is ! Talk of \u2014 it's so funny how often that comes true.' 'Does it? I'm sorry for that. If I were you I wouldn't talk about her then,' Mac kinnon answered, while his eyes wandered uneasily to where the lady in question was walking slowly along. He didn't want her to see him with Ina. Much as he admired the girl, and much as he desired to have her for his wife, still he had by no means made up his mind to pro pose. I will not say that he loved her, for that is to degrade a noble sentiment, but her beauty enthralled his senses, and he wanted to possess her, but only if he could do so with prudence. She was an only child. Surely"], [167, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 137 she must have some money, but still he was not absolutely certain. And unless she had, he would not marry her. He had seven hun dred a year now, but he required something more than mere comfort \u2014 luxuries were neces sary to him, and he would never marry till he had a clear thousand a year, because only then could he live as he liked. The truth of the matter was simply this \u2014 that Mac kinnon was incapable of loving any one but himself. Self was his god. He knew, too, that his passion for Ina would probably not last for any length of time, and then if he should find himself saddled with a wife for whom he no longer cared, and who brought no grist to the mill, things would be bad in deed. Often during the last few weeks he had tried to find out what her prospects were, but each time he had been baffled. As he sat there in the quiet sheltered corner of the Archdeacon's garden, looking at the slim, elegant figure and the sweet face of the girl beside him, his passion was still sufficiently cold-blooded for him to be able to reflect that he must on no account commit himself till he knew about the money. He bent forward a little, so as to prevent Mrs Smallpiece's sharp eyes detecting who it was that was with him, and then"], [168, "138 CATHEDRAL BELLS. as the lady in question passed cut of sight and without, as he devoutly hoped, noticing them, he leant back and laughed rather con temptuously. 'Look,' he said, 'just look at that fellow walking with Mrs Maycott. I wonder he isn't ashamed to come, such a scarecrow as he is. It's ungentlemanly.' Ina lifted her eyes and looked to where her hostess was standing. And there in his black coat, with his trousers turned up and his white socks showing, and his hand grasp ing the Gamp-like umbrella, still fastened with the indiarubber band, she beheld Mr Romer. The Archdeacon's wife had seen the black figure going down the Close, and knowing the deep sorrow he was in, and also his parti ality for his Rector's pretty daughter, had stepped up to the low stone wall and begged him to come in. She had some little question to ask him about schools, she said, with gentle, womanly tact, so as not to let him sus pect that she had brought him in there be cause she hoped a glimpse of his enchantress might cheer him up a little, and she was now walking him about hoping that they might meet the girl. 'Poor Mr Romer!' Ina returned, rather amazed at Mr Mackinnon's attack on the"], [169, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 139 Curate. The little man was so good and thoughtful for her that she did not like to hear him ridiculed. ' Oh, I don't agree with you at all ! ' she went on. ' He is very funny, and his dress is ludicrous \u2014 always ludicrous, but he is a thorough gentleman.' The banker gave a little sneer. 'He is just a beggar,' he said; 'just that. Next time he comes to my rooms I shall \u2014 ' 'Shall what?' Ina asked, feeling her annoy ance increase. ' Nothing,' he said. ' Tell me,' she urged. ' No. He's a devoted admirer of yours, isn't he, Miss Ina? Always walks home from the Sunday school with you, doesn't he?' ' Generally ; yes. Why ? ' 'Well, I don't think I need be jealous of that guy,' Mackinnon answered, glancing down with approval at his own well-cut trousers and patent leather boots. ' I give my leave for that, if he amuses you, but no one else, mind \u2014 not Maxwell of Saint Margaret's, or any one like that.' Mr Maxwell was a very rich, handsome. young clergyman, holding a small living in the neighbourhood of Carswell. 'And, pray, what right have you to give me leave, or attempt to control me?' Ina"], [170, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 140 asked, pretending to be offended, though in reality she liked Mackinnon's assumption of authority over her. It was an awkward question to have put to him without his committing himself in some way, but he was a clever man and equal to the occasion. ' The right of one who \u2014 ' he began eagerly, then stopped. A flush crept over the girl's face ; she looked down on the ground, and waited. ' In a little time, perhaps, I may be able to tell you why I think I have some sort of right, but not to-day. Good-bye, Ina. I mustn't stop now, for I have a business appointment, and must not keep the man waiting.' It was the first time he had called her by her Christian name, and it was a clever stroke on his part just then. She returned the pressure of his hand, and looked up with a little shy light in her eyes, and a resolution in \u25a0 her heart not to allow Mr Maxwell to attend her anywhere in the future. ' Good-bye,' she said softly, and then she drew her hand away, and the banker turned to go. He had no appointment, but he deemed it a wise move on his part to retire just then. As he closed the gate behind him, Mr Romer, who had been watching the pair"], [171, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 141 \u2014 watching with jealous glance and a sharp pain in his heart \u2014 stepped across to where the girl was standing, and held out his hand. ' I hoped I should meet you,' he said. ' I shouldn't have come in but for that,' and he gave the little hand a warm pressure ; but he had chosen his moment badly, and Ina did not return it. ' Something about that tiresome school, I suppose ? ' she asked. ' Really, I think I shall give up my class ; it is getting such a bore. Amy or Ethel Festing would be delighted to step in and take my place.' The Curate's heart sank down into his boots. The walk home with Ina from the school-house was the one thing which he looked forward to from week's end to week's end, and which made the waking up on Sunday morning different from the waking up on any other day in the week. To be sure the walk only lasted a quarter of an hour, but then he went over it again and again in memory during the seven days which followed. No wonder then at the girl's words his heart sank within him. ' Oh, I hope not,' he answered nervously. ' Oh, I do hope not. Oh, I am sure the Miss Festings would not be equal to it \u2014 oh, I'm sure they wouldn't, \u2014 not \u2014 not as a rule,"], [172, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 142 I mean. I hope you won't think of it. The children would feel it very much \u2014 yes, indeed I am sure they would. They think so much of you \u2014 yes they do. No, I'm sure you can not have the heart to give them up, and I \u2014 I should \u2014 that is, I hope you will not do it.' The pair by this time had said farewell to Mrs Maycott, and were following Mrs Strong, who was walking with another lady towards the Rectory. ' You haven't told me yet what it is you wanted to see me about,' the girl said at last, without taking any notice of the Curate's last speech. She didn't mean to give up the school in the least, only sometimes he was so silly, so annoying, that she determined to leave him in suspense, by way of a little punishment. ' Oh, I beg your pardon. I \u2014 I hadn't any thing \u2014 anything particular to say. What I meant when I said that I hoped I should find you at the Archdeacon's, was that I hoped I should see you for a little chat. One does not always want to talk busi ness. Sometimes one likes to see a friend, and \u2014 ' The Curate stopped, not knowing exactly how he was going to put it. 'What a difference it makes to one's pleas-"], [173, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 143 ure when one's companion is not the right person,' Ina said to herself, as they turned in between the ivy-covered walls. How amusing and clever Mr Mackinnon was, she thought, and what a bore that he had to go off to keep that appointment, otherwise he would certainly have escorted her home, and then very likely her mother would have invited him to remain to dinner. ' You \u2014 you are very silent this afternoon, Miss \u2014 Miss Strong,' Mr Romer ventured to say, after a somewhat lengthy pause. How he would like to call her ' Miss Ina,' even as he had heard that fellow Mackinnon do, once or twice. How he hated that horrid, snake-like creature, with his tall figure, hand some face, and long purse ! She was always cold to him when he had been with her. He wished the banker would go away from Carswell, and never come back again. ' You are very silent this afternoon, Miss Strong,' he repeated. ' What ? ' The girl had been thinking about some thing else, and had not heard the question which had been put twice. Mr Romer sighed. ' Nothing,' he answered sadly. ' I said it twice. It isn't worth repeating.'"], [174, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 144 ' I beg your pardon,' Ina replied, suddenly penitent at the sight of her companion's face of woe. He was so truly devoted to her, \u2014 - had indeed ever been so since the first day that they had met, when she had been but a child of fifteen, that in her intercourse with him she was continually thawing. ' I am very rude,' she went on, in her gentlest way. ' It's lucky we are at home. Perhaps after I have changed my frock and rested a little I shall be equal to the society of my fellow creatures. At present it is evident I am not' ' Won't you come in and dine quietly with us, Mr Romer ? ' Mrs Strong said, when she had shaken hands with him at her own door. ' The Rector will be glad to have a chat about the parish afterwards.' The Curate glanced at the girl beside him, but unfortunately her thoughts had wandered back to Mr Mackinnon, and she did not even hear what her mother said, so that there was no response in the blue-grey eyes. His pride came to the rescue, and he resisted the temptation. ' Thank you \u2014 oh, thank you, but no \u2014 not to-night. I \u2014 I \u2014 I am \u2014 that is, not this evening.' He had meant to say he had an engage-"], [175, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 145 ment, but remembering that he had none, refrained from saying it. Ina noticed the con fused sentences, saw what he had intended to say, and did justice to the reason which prevented the shy, nervous man from making the polite excuse. The sweet eyes gave a little look of approval at him, the only one which, by the way, she had bestowed on him that afternoon, but he was saying good-bye to Mrs Strong, and never saw it. He lifted his hat to the girl and went away without attempting to shake hands, feeling that it would hurt more to have her hand lying un responsive in his than not to touch it at all. He turned and went down the path between the ivy - covered walls, went away with hurried, nervous strides, with his trousers turned up, and his white socks showing, and looking ludicrous enough, I daresay, but yet for all that I do not think Ina quite liked it. She was accustomed to be adored by him, and for once she had been rather snubbed. She went into the house and upstairs, and somehow, as she dressed for dinner, she for got to think about Mr Mackinnon, and found herself thinking about James Romer instead. It was rather a novel situation for Miss Ina not to have everything her own way. The clock struck seven as the Curate turned K"], [176, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 146 into Smith Street. He strode along 'the High' and down Jessop Street to his own rooms thinking \u2014 thinking of Ina. He opened the door with his latch-key and went in. The little parlour was simply and plainly furnished, and his supper was laid ready for him. He cut himself a slice of cold meat, and broke some bread and ate hurriedly. In ten minutes his solitary meal was over, and he went and sat in his arm-chair and tried to think. He sat there till the church clock chimed the half hour, and the sound roused him. He would go out and walk. He could think better when he was walking. He rose and went to the head of the kitchen stairs. Mr Romer wanted to know if there had been any one there for him on parish business ? No, the landlady said she thought not. To be sure she hadn't been in all the afternoon, but still there had been no note thrust under the door or put under the knocker, as was the general custom, so the Curate concluded that his work was done for that day, and taking his latch-key went out into the twilight. Where should he go ? he asked himself as he turned once more into the High. It was getting on towards eight o'clock, and the shopkeepers were beginning to put their shutters up. In a little while the place would"], [177, ""], [178, "HE WOULD GO DOWN TO HIS BELOVED CANAL. Page 147."], [179, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 147 be alive with those who had been boxed up all day behind the counter, but at present it was quiet enough. Still he did not want to be disturbed so soon. He would go down to his beloved Canal, down to where it was quiet and deserted on the towing path. James Romer turned the corner by the Cross, and went along Smith Street, over the Railway, past the Gas Works \u2014 smelling objectionably as it is the manner and custom of Gas Works to do \u2014 and then down on to the pathway^ He had come the long way round, instead of going through the timber - yard, because he didn't want to see any of his parishioners just then. He went on along the deserted footway for a mile and more, went at a rapid pace, as one who had some object in view, and not as a man usually walks who has absolutely nothing to do. Presently he came to where the narrow path widened for about a hundred yards or so, and here he began to pace up and down. What was he going to do ? That was the question he had come out there to ask him self in the quiet still eventide. Things could not go on like this. The constant thought of Ina was getting to affect his work. He knew it. There was no use in disguising it."], [180, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 148 He could not sleep properly at night, lying wakeful, thinking always of her sweet face. No one could do his work properly who did not get his night's rest. And his work was not his own to neglect or not as he chose. The Rector paid him ninety pounds a year, and it was but fitting that in return he should give him all his powers. Ay, there was another reason, too, why he should not neglect it. Had he not taken upon himself to serve One who required that his service should not be a half-hearted one. He was neglecting that which he had undertaken to do. True, he still went about the parish, visited the sick, was at the call of all who might need him, but his heart and his mind were no longer in it. When he ought to be thinking about this charity or that, he was thinking instead of Ina \u2014 always Ina. And it was getting worse daily. He knew it. This thought of Mackinnon would drive him mad. Before that had begun he had been content enough, and able to go about his work right willingly ; but now it was altogether different. If it was anybody else he would not have minded quite so much. To some good man, perhaps, he could have borne to have given her up \u2014 at least he would have striven to bear it better \u2014 but this fellow! He was"], [181, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 149 unworthy of her. God forgive him if he judged harshly, but he believed him to be so. Only three days ago he had had an in terview with him. A number of the cottages by the Canal had been bought up by Mr Mackinnon, and he \u2014 the Curate \u2014 had gone to him and pointed out that they were in an unsanitary state, and that the rise in the rent, which the Banker had just made, was wholly unjustifiable. And the man had laughed at him \u2014 and when he had said that though there was no sickness there then, still the hottest part of the summer was yet to come, and fever might break out, \u2014 the only answer he had received was that there were far too many people in the world, and that a few bargees more or less would not make much difference. That had been the reply of this wretch \u2014 this inhuman monster, sitting in his comfortable drawing-room in West Street. What would Ina have thought, he wondered, if she could have heard him ! He could not tell her. No ; the banker was his rival and he would take no mean advantage of him. And yet, surely, he ought to warn the girl that this being was wholly unworthy of her, even if, in so doing, she should believe that his act was only jealousy, and his words the words of slander. If he had not loved Ina"], [182, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 150 as he did, it would have been easy for him to have gone and hinted that Mackinnon was not, in his opinion, the kind of man to make a girl happy for long. How he hated to see them together, \u2014 this sweet trustful being who had so completely stolen his own heart from him, and that handsome snake-like creature. It was horrible to him to note the look in the man's eyes as he regarded Ina. He him self held her ever in his thoughts in the most sacred reverence. Everything that was sweet, and pure, and fresh reminded him of her. She knew he loved her \u2014 he was sure of that. If Mackinnon and he had not been rivals then it would have been easy for him to approach her with words of warning, but he felt that such rivalship closed his lips. And his own love for her was so hopeless. He knew it. Was it likely that one so lovely would condescend to think of a beg garly Curate like himself? He understood that he was poor and mean-looking. His love for her was folly. If he were man enough to rise up and put it from him,\u2014 thrust it from out his life, then, perhaps, he might approach her. When he said put it from him, he knew that that was impossible, \u2014 knew that the wound was too deep, had indeed burnt down into the very core of his heart ;"], [183, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 151 but at least he might veil it. Then he could go to her after a while, and tell her not to give herself to Mackinnon. But then was not the task beyond him ? Day after day he had gone about his work thinking only of her. And if that which he proposed was to be done, then he must fight and struggle with his proneness to carry her image about with him. He must let her think that he was changing to her. Her little rudeness of this afternoon would be sufficient excuse for a coolness to begin between them. He must avoid her too. Next Sunday he must leave her to walk home alone, and afterwards he must be careful not to allow himself to give any excuse for this sudden change of his usual habits. When he woke up next Sunday morning there would be no prospect of a walk with Ina. Yes, he must do these things. So long as he could save Ina from the man he distrusted, that was all that mattered. Discipline, indeed, he himself stood in need of, and what better discipline could he have than this ? Yes, he must put the girl as much out of his thoughts as possible. Ex cept when morning and evening he knelt in prayer to his God, then surely it was fitting he should think of her \u2014 then, when it was his custom to ask that angels might be"], [184, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 152 about her path to shield her from all harm, and that He, the Lord of all, would be her strength in her little trials and temptations, and that in her hours of perplexity He would go before and show the way, even as in the days of old He had gone before His chosen people in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. At such moments it was fitting that his thoughts should turn to wards the girl he loved so dearly ; but at other times he must seek to put her image from him. It would be hard work. Ay, he knew that. But then it was for a noble object. If he could shield her from this man, that was what he cared about. Of course she would marry some day. Yes, it was not likely that one so fair could be passed over. So long as it was a good man he could bear it \u2014 at least he would try to. He would go away, take a Curacy in the Black Country \u2014 she had lived in the Black Country once ! \u2014 when that time came ; but till all danger of Mackinnon was at an end, it was his duty to remain. He would suffer \u2014 yes, but then it was for her sake. That was sufficient. Up and down, up and down in the pale silver light of the summer moon the Curate paced. He did not know how long he had"], [185, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 153 been there. Once he took out his watch and peered at it, finding that it was past mid night. He would go home, he resolved, and then began thinking again about Ina \u2014 his Ina \u2014 and forgot all about the resolution. No, not his. Had he not said that he would put her from him ? She was going to belong to some other man, some good man, who would love her and take care of her. He would go away then. He couldn't stay in Carswell. Suppose he heard the Cathedral Bells pealing on her bridal morn ? It would kill him, or drive him mad. Bah ! was this the way to maintain his new-made resolution ? The future was in God's hands. He must leave it to Him. He was All-wise. It seemed a mystery then to him in his bitter weary pain why such great love should have been put into his heart if it was to be of no purpose \u2014 of no avail. Hush ! he had no right to think like that. This world was not all. It was only a little, brief, passing affair. In that better land they would be together. He would no longer then be small and insig nificant. Their paths here might lie apart, but hereafter, perchance, they might stand side by side at God's great Harvest Home. He took off his hat and stood still, looking up at the violet skies as he thought this, and"], [186, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 154 asked that it might be so. If that were granted he could bear the solitude of his life. He would ask it night and morning \u2014 night and morning. That was the way to be heard. \u2022 I shall see her in heaven,' he thought, as he looked up at the stars again. Then he turned and went home through the quiet streets. The dawn was breaking as he closed the door and crept upstairs to bed."], [187, ""], [188, "INA WAS SITTING IN FRONT OF A LITTLE TABLE. Page 155."], [189, "CHAPTER VII. ' . . . .

Guinevere. ' I WISH this tea would make haste.' It was the last week of July, and in Carswell the heat was even more stifling than it usually is in that quaint old town in the 'dog days.' The Cathedral clock had just boomed forth the hour of five, and in the silence which reigned in the Strongs' garden the organ could be distinctly heard playing the opening voluntary. Ina was sitting in front of a little table waiting for the tea to ' draw,' and stretched at her feet, dressed in riding costume, was young Lord Rossmere. The family were still absent from Stack field, and during the past month the boy had rarely missed spending at least part of the afternoon of nearly each day in Ina's society."], [190, "156 CATHEDRaAL bells. In the mornings he had been engaged with his tutor, but directly luncheon was finished, he was on his horse, and trotting rapidly in the direction of Carswell. ' But people will talk,' Mrs Strong had said once or twice to her daughter, after the young fellow had remained at the Rectory almost up to the dinner hour. 'What does it matter,' Ina answered, push ing back the curly hair from off her forehead. ' He is only a boy \u2014 I always told you I wanted a brother. I destine him to fill the vacant office.' I wonder if young Lord Ross mere would have been quite pleased if he had heard the girl's words. ' Those horrid gossips will be sure to say he is in love with you,' Mrs Strong urged. ' So he is,' Ina answered, looking up from her work. ' Desperately too. I'm not sure I'm not a tiny little bit in love with him myself Then the girl had turned once more to her occupation, and nothing further was said. Mrs Strong saw that Ina was bent on con tinuing the friendship, and knowing her own utter inability to thwart the girl's wishes, allowed the matter to drop. If it had been anybody else she would not have minded. For instance, young Ellis, the son of the"], [191, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 157 Vicar of Moberly, might have come as often as he pleased, for every one round knew that his father had not one penny in the world ; but Lord Rossmere was an altogether different person. He was heir to a large fortune and a great name. If he chose to marry, there was no one after his twenty-first birthday who could prevent him. The estates were entailed. Nothing that anybody might say need have the slightest effect upon him. And then Carswell was such a curious place. The jealousy, malice, and uncharitableness which existed under the very shadow of the old Cathedral, was enough to startle one. Mrs Strong knew perfectly well that Ina had always been a mark for envy. If it should get about that young Lord Rossmere was continually at her daughter's side, there was no knowing to what insane depths of jealousy people might go. Mrs Strong was much bothered about it. He was such a nice boy. She herself liked him much. If only he had not been so desperately in love with her daughter. And Ina ? Well, certainly the young Earl's devotion was not at all displeasing to her ; on the contrary, she liked it. She did not think of it as a serious thing. To a girl of nineteen, who has seen much of the world,"], [192, "158 CATHEDRAL BELLS. a boy of twenty is a very boy indeed. Now, though Ina had never undergone the glories of a London season she knew much more than other Carswell girls. A certain Augusta Vane, who stayed a good deal at the Palace, and who was no longer very young, had taken a liking to the girl, so that Ina may have been said to have looked at things through the spectacles of her friend's experi ence. The girl liked Lord Rossmere's honest face, his jolly laugh, his high-bred aristocratic voice and manner, while his devotion to her touched her. In years to come, when he was really grown up, he would make a charming husband to some one, she told herself. She did not think of his present infatuation as a lasting thing. Sometimes, when they were alone to- gether, he would get the better of his youth- ful timidity, and would catch hold of her hand, and imprison her slender fingers in his, blushing meanwhile at his own audacity. At such times she would laugh at him, but, even while doing so, she would tell herself that he was a dear boy. But such pass- ages of tenderness were few and far between. As a rule, when they were alone together, there was little else but peals of laughter to be heard. Rossmere would tell the"], [193, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 159 girl stories of tricks he had played at Eton ; of the scrapes he had been wont to get into ; or he would drag away her work - basket, saying she was not attend ing to him, and then the pair would pelt each other with lamp spills, or anything which came within reach. Ever since the hour they had met beneath the elms in the Dean's garden, Rossmere had devoted himself to her. And she was so fond of him, and he was such a complete boy, that she had got into the way of allowing him privileges which she was certainly not in the habit of granting to his sex as a rule. When of an afternoon they were together in the garden, and the hall-door bell gave forth its warning of visitors, she would let herself be persuaded not to go in, but to sit quietly where she was under the shade of the trees, while he himself lay talking in whispers at her feet. ' I wish this tea would make haste.' Ina repeated the words the afternoon of which I am writing, while at the same time she seized a spoon and stirred the contents of the teapot round and round, in the hope of making the mixture stronger. ' I think it will do now,' she said at last. ' Run in, there's a dear good boy, and tell mother that we are only waiting for her.'"], [194, "160 CATHEDRAL BELLS. Lord Rossmere struggled up from his place, and walked slowly towards the house. By and-by he returned, with somewhat more alacrity. Mrs Strong was engaged \u2014 they were not to wait for her. The boy delivered his message, and sank down once more on the soft grass, only too glad that their tete-a-tete was not yet ended. ' You'll get a letter to - morrow morning,' he said, looking up from his cup. ' No, thanks, I won't eat anything. It's much too hot to eat' 'A letter! Who from?' Ina asked. ' From my mother \u2014 at least a card. I heard from Beatrice to-day, and she said she had sent an invitation to you all for a garden party.' 'When is it?' ' The seventh of next month. Generally I think ours awful rot, but now \u2014 ' looking up with a bright, glad smile \u2014 ' now it will be different.' 'Is that meant as a compliment to me?' Ina asked. 'Oh, it is, is it? Don't you know I don't allow compliments ? I have told you that a hundred times, sir ; but when you do pay them, I wish you wouldn't put them so that I don't know what they are. Very often you make some remark soon after you come,"], [195, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 161 and it's only when you are about half way home to Stackfield again that I discover it's been meant for a pretty speech. If you go on making them, I think I shall begin to adopt a system of fines.' ' What sort of fines ? ' the boy, asked curiously. ' Stand on your head for a quarter of an hour,' Ina returned, giving a vicious hit at a wasp who was desirous of contesting her bread and butter with her. ' Or, walk round the garden backwards three times, with your eyes shut.' ' Jolly for the flower beds,' laughed Rossmere. ' Listen, there's a bothering ring ! I do think you people have more rings in one day than we have all the year round at Stackfield. I hope it isn't that horrid brute \u2014 What's-his-name ? \u2014 Mackinnon.' ' Lord Rossmere ! ' ' Oh, I know you like him, but I hate him. Perhaps if you didn't like him so much, I shouldn't hate him quite so badly.' ' I don't think it's a very nice way to speak of other people's friends,' Ina answered, rather coldly, while a little flush of vexation mounted to her cheeks. The young Earl rarely stayed after six, and Mr Mackinnon seldom left the bank L"], [196, "162 CATHEDRAL BELLS. before that hour, so that the pair did not often meet ; while Ina, knowing how fond the boy was of her, and how jealous he was of the Banker, was rather in the habit of keeping secret the fact that Mr Mac kinnon had adopted the habit of looking in most evenings for an hour or so before dinner. 'Well, I can't help it,' the boy answered, after a pause. ' I do hate him. There is something about him which I can't stand. He knows I dislike him, and he looks at me like a \u2014 like a devil ! ' Lord Rossmere dropped his voice, and looked rather frightened after he had used the expression, not being quite sure how Ina would take it The girl, however, did not seem to notice it. ' Nonsense,' she said. ' It's all your fancy. I don't suppose he ever thinks about you.' ' I tell you he does,' retorted the young Earl. ' He hates me almost as much as he does Romer.' The Curate had been there once or twice at the same time as Lord Rossmere and the Banker, and the boy, being a shrewd lad, had seen in a moment that there was no love lost between the pair. Perhaps the very fact"], [197, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 163 that the shy, nervous Curate and the young nobleman had struck up rather a friendship, had not increased Mr Mackinnon's affection for his clerical rival. Lord Rossmere rarely addressed the Banker, and when he did, only in a coldly polite manner. The latter would have been pleased to have been on friendly terms with Lord Stackallan's son, and to have spoken about it in the Glass Room at the bank before his clerks, but the boy gave him nothing to go upon. The latter was young enough to be extremely sensitive about his age, and Mr Mackinnon, out of spite, rarely lost an opportunity of making some allusion to it. I do not, however, think the Banker much improved his position with Ina thereby. She was excessively fond of her youthful admirer, and particularly disliked his being annoyed. ' I don't think Mr Mackinnon hates Mr Romer,' the girl answered, after a little pause. ' True, he laughs at him ; but then it is difficult to prevent oneself from doing that sometimes ; and, besides, laughing at a person doesn't mean hating them.' ' No, I know that ; but he does hate him, all the same, and some day you'll find out I'm right. I say, what has become of Romer ? I haven't seen him for ages.'"], [198, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 164 ' Busy with his beloved bargees, I suppose,' Ina answered, stooping down to look at some thing on the grass. Truth to tell, the girl herself had noticed the continued absence of Mr Romer. Twice only since the tennis party at Archdeacon Maycott's had he been at the Rectory, and on each occasion it was only by chance that she had seen him, and then he had hardly spoken to her. He had been introduced to the young Earl, and had talked to him almost exclusively. He had, as we know, resolved to avoid Ina, other wise he would have died rather than seem inclined to push himself into the society of the great. But Lord Rossmere was a boy, he told himself, and did not count. He had been at Oxford, and the lad was going there. He was able to answer all the questions which the youth wished to put to him, but while so doing he was careful to explain the position which he had occupied when there. ' I was only a servitor, you know,' he said. ' My poor old mother could not afford that I should pay like the rest. A servitor is \u2014 well it is a little difficult to explain to you what it is \u2014 something like being on the foundation at school, only inferior \u2014 very in ferior, I should say.'"], [199, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 165 He was not ashamed of it. He was too simple-minded to be ashamed at what seemed quite natural to him born as he was \u2014 and as he often said \u2014 in a lowly rank of life. Looking at him as he stood there in his black clothes and wrinkled white socks, and grasping the stout ' Gamp ' which he always carried, the young Earl conceived an affec tion for the comic-looking figure. ' He is a gentleman,' the boy told himself while he listened to the simple, manly avowal of poverty, and then as Mackinnon sneered when the word servitor had been explained, Lord Rossmere had struggled up from the grass and had taken the Curate's arm and walked with him up and down the old garden, talk ing of Oxford and ' Little goes,' while the Cathedral Bells chimed the quarters, and the sun began his descent in the far west. ' I think I shall go and look him up on my way home. He lives next to the church in Jessop Street, doesn't he ? ' Lord Rossmere asked, when he and his companion had been sitting silent, while Ina wondered for the thousandth time whether her rudeness during the walk back from the Archdeacon's tennis party had offended Mr Romer beyond recovery. ' Yes, next the church,' the girl answered. ' Poor man ! He'll be frightened out of his"], [200, "166 CATHEDRAL BELLS. wits at a visitor. I don't know, though. He seemed to get on with you very well.' ' I like him,' the boy replied. ' What a comic figure he cuts, and yet what a thorough gentleman he is ! ' ' Yes, that is what I have always said,' Ina made answer. ' I'm afraid I must have offended him in some way. He never comes to see me now, and at one time \u2014 at one time he used to come very often, almost as often as you do,' with a little smile. ' I wonder if you will go away and desert me too ? Some day, I suppose.' ' I shall never go unless you send me,' the boy answered, in a whisper, while the hot blood mounted to his cheeks. He listed his eyes and looked up shyly at the sweet face before him. A boy's first love is always full of reverence. ' Ah, so you say now', Ina answered, with a shake of the head, ' but when you have been a term or two at Oxford you will be much too fine a young man to come and spend your afternoons with me. I daresay you'll think it a great favour to stop your horse and have a chat in 'the High.' ' I sha'n't ! ' exclaimed the young fellow passion- ately ; ' you know I sha'n't. You only say it to tease me.'"], [201, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 167 ' Indeed I didn't,' Ina answered. ' I really think it. No, now don't be cross. Very well then, you won't be too fine. There ! ' ' I shall go,' said the boy. ' You are horrid and disagreeable this afternoon. I don't know what's the matter, I'm sure. Good-bye.' ' Are you really going ? ' the girl asked. ' No, you mustn't, till you have had your second cup. You know you always have two cups. And I won't be cross any more, though I didn't know I had been ; at all events, I didn't mean to be.' ' Shake hands,' Lord Rossmere answered, kneeling down preparatory to laying himself once more on the soft grass at Ina's feet. Then the girl stretched out one of her soft white hands and the boy put it to his lips. ' Like a courtier, you know,' he said. And then finding it pleasant, he grew bolder. ' Mayn't I ask for something better ? ' he went on, blushing crimson at his own temerity. ' I don't know whether you ever had your ears boxed,' the girl returned, 'but I have a good mind to do it.' And considering that the young gentleman had only known her for about a month, I must say that if the threat had been carried out, I don't know that he would have had much right to complain."], [202, "168 CATHEDRAL BELLS. ' Mayn't I ? ' pleaded the boy. ' Certainly not, Lord Rossmere. I'm very angry with you. I think I shall go into the house now, as I am tired.' Ina rose slowly as she spoke, and the young fellow sprang to his feet as if he had been shot ' Don't ! ' he exclaimed. ' Oh, I didn't mean to offend you. Please, please forgive me.' ' I have a good mind not to,' Ina answered, sitting down once more. Truth to tell she wasn't really angry. Standing there before her, looking so frank and manly, with such great devotion to her written on his sunburnt face, the girl felt that she would not have been very sorry if he had ventured to carry out his proposal without waiting for leave. If you promise to be very good \u2014 ' she began. ' Oh, I promise anything, so long as you are not offended,' Rossmere broke in. ' Very well then, shake hands again, sir,' the girl answered, stretching out her own once more. The boy put it to his lips. ' This is allowed,' he said. Ina laughed. ' If it gives you the slightest pleasure I'm sure I don't mind. Ah, here is your friend Mr Mackinnon. What, are you really off? I"], [203, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 169 suppose you'll be in to-morrow ? ' Then the girl turned to greet the Banker, and the young lord strode away into the house, hardly deign ing to nod to the junior partner. ' Does Mr Romer live here ? ' inquired Ross mere of that gentleman's landlady, who was standing at the doorway of the house in Jessop Street looking out for the long over-due milk man. If an archangel had come and in quired for her lodger, I don't think she could have been more surprised, \u2014 indeed, I doubt if she would have been half as much. 'Yes, my lord. Does your lordship wish to speak to him ? I'll send him out, my lord, in one minute,' and the landlady turned to acquaint her lodger with what was in store for him, when the young Earl stopped her. ' No, no ! I'm coming in to call on him. Here, little boy, hold my horse,' and then Lord Rossmere jumped down, and followed the amazed Mrs Podmore into the house. ' This is very kind \u2014 very kind, I am sure ! Mr Romer exclaimed, rising hastily from the table, where he was making a homely meal off tea and bread and butter. 'You'll take a cup, won't you ? Oh, I am very glad of that. Mrs Podmore, another cup,' he shouted, going to the door ; then he returned, and taking a pile of magazines and papers of all kinds out"], [204, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 170 of the leather arm-chair, he signed to his friend to sit down. It was the first time any one had sat in it since the old lady with the grey curls had used it. Her portrait, in a horrible gilt frame, hung over the fireplace \u2014 that was all that was left of her now to him ! He would like to have purchased the chair of his landlady, and kept it in his bedroom, \u2014 but then he must have purchased another for visitors, and consequently he would have had so much the less for his poor. Sentiment was all very well when it did not clash with duty to one's neighbour. So he kept the piece of furniture in the front parlour, and put Lord Rossmere in it, only a pain went through his heart like a knife for a minute when he saw the boy sitting there. But then no one could tell that. He smiled at the young Earl, and poured out the tea, and congratulated him self that the milkman had come just in the nick of time. ' I can have some too myself now,' he said, with a smile, as he poured part of the contents of the white milk-jug into his own teacup. 'Why, were you drinking yours without any milk ? ' Lord Rossmere asked. ' What a fellow you are ! And what a deuce of a hurry you"], [205, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 171 must have been in, not to have been able to wait just another five minutes or so.' ' Oh, it wasn't so much that,' the Curate answered, with a little laugh. ' It was only that I thought I would go down to the Canal after tea, and it seemed a pity not to get down in good time. Very often I am able to carry off one or two of the men to our new Reading Room that way, whereas, otherwise, they would only spend the evening in the public house, wasting a lot of money, and doing themselves harm, and making their wives wretched. In the Rooms they can't spend more than three pence, because no man is allowed to be served with more than one pint of beer. Horley and those other temperance fellows were dead against me, and I thought I should never have been able to get a licence, but I managed it in the end. \" What's the use of making a new sin ? \" I said to them. \" There is plenty of wrong done down near the Canal without our inventing evil. Why shouldn't a man drink a pint of beer with his evening pipe if he likes?\" They were up in arms, but I won the day. Dr Fraser stood to me like a man. If it hadn't been for him, my bargees would have been left with nothing but slops.' ' Do you go down there just on the spec"], [206, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 172 of getting a stray man or two in, every even ing?' Lord Rossmere asked. ' Very nearly.' 'Isn't it an awful bore?' ' Why \u2014 why, yes, it is ; sometimes, that is \u2014 not always. I quite like it \u2014 the walk, and the waiting about, in summer when the heat has been oppressive during the day. It's cool down by the canal.' ' And do you go on winter evenings ? ' 'Yes, oh yes. There's a deal more drinking spirits in winter time. Poor fellows ! They want something \"just to keep the cold out,\" and so they take that. It's very foolish, and I can't make them see that it does them harm, and takes away the money which should be spent in food and fuel, and in making their poor wives and children comfortable during the long winter evenings. It's very difficult to bring home to men of that class, too, the fact that selfishness is such an ugly thing.' Lord Rossmere sat in his arm-chair without speaking. He looked at the Curate, and saw that he was just as comic-looking as ever, but somehow, what had struck him on a former occasion, , truck him again now, and that was that when this man talked earnestly, you forgot there was anything to laugh at in him. He was less nervous, too, with him \u2014"], [207, "LORD ROSSMERE SAT IN HIS ARM-CHAIR WITHOUT SPEAKING. Page 172."], [208, ""], [209, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 173 Rossmere \u2014 - than he was with others. This little lean Curate was worth knowing, the boy felt sure of that. He put ideas into people's heads. ' That selfishness is such an ugly thing.' He had never thought of it in that light before. He had known very selfish fellows at school, and had seen them disliked in con sequence, but now the boy began to wonder whether he himself was not more affected with this ugly thing than he had dreamed of. He liked to drink his cool claret after dinner, and to smoke and chat with pleasant companions, while this man whom he was listening to, stood about, yes, even on winter evenings, at street corners, hoping to keep great rough bargees away from the public house for a couple of hours or so. And that, too, not after a good dinner and generous wine, but after a meal of tea and bread. The boy looked at the Curate. And while he looked he was learning a great lesson, only he did not understand that he was doing so. ' You ought to come down and see the Reading Room I have set up. I wish you would. The men would like it so. Have you any engagement for this evening ? ' There was dinner for himself and the tutor at eight o'clock at Stackfield. If he did not return Mr Stillwell would, of course,"], [210, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 174 sit down without him. He was rather hungry, and very thirsty, but he could go without his dinner for once, and have a late supper. ' The men would like it.' If Romer could take all this trouble about these sort of people every day in the year, surely he might give up one evening to them ! ' No, I haven't any engagements, old fellow,' he said ; ' only give me another slice of bread, and I'm ready to go and see the Rooms and the men.' Lord Rossmere was taking in the lesson very quickly, I think. The Curate helped his friend with a beaming face, and even in dulged in a similar luxury himself. It was not often that he could find any one to take an interest in his bargees. By-and-by when the homely meal came to an end the pair went out into the quiet street. Lord Rossmere put his horse up at the Livery Stables, which stood in close proximity to Mr Romer's rooms, and having lighted a cigarette, put his arm through the Curate's, and they walked away through the silent Crossgates. People looking out of their windows in that quaint locality were greatly surprised to see the heir to Stackfield arm-in-arm with the poor despised Curate of St Mary's. Old Mr Bone, the rich surveyor, who lived in one of the best"], [211, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 175 houses in Carswell, made a note of it, and told his wife that night before he went to sleep to be sure and ask the clergyman to dinner. ' To dinner, William ! ' she exclaimed. She had just been 'dropping off' but that woke her up thoroughly. ' Why, you have never called on him ! And the only time he ever came here, about some subscription, you wouldn't see him ! ' ' No, my dear, very true ; but then I hadn't seen him walking with Lord Rossmere.' After that candid explanation, the worthy couple slept the sleep of the just. Romer and his young friend waited about the different narrow streets near the Canal, and even carried off one or two bargees from the door of the '\u25a0Sailors' Delight' itself. It was half-past eight before they got to the Rooms, which were very fairly full. The men were sitting about at little tables, smoking their pipes and drinking their one pint of beer \u2014 drinking it slowly and thoughtfully, and not at all in the reckless way which belongs to those who know that when the contents of the pewter is gone they can call for more. The arrival of the ' Markus's son ' on the scene was quite a pleasant excitement. The boy with his slight figure, and sunburnt face and cheery smile, was soon popular with the"], [212, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 176 men. He went from table to table just as he saw James Romer doing, and talked, and asked questions about barges, and life on the Canal. And he told a couple of great hulk ing fellows about his uncle \u2014 the Duke of Berwick's yacht, and how he had been on board her the day she had won the great In ternational Race, and a thousand other things about her, till one of the men said he guessed life was more fun aboard her than on 'a blooming barge.' He didn't say blooming, though, because it was too refined a word, and bargees, as a class, are not refined. And then Romer came to his young friend and asked would he sing something \u2014 anything that had a chorus to it. So Lord Rossmere sang 'We'll all go a hunting to-day,' and the bargees joined in with right good-will. This was so popular that it was encored, and then they had ' Rule Britannia,' and half-a dozen others, till Romer said it was time for them to go. And then one of the older bargees thanked their young visitor for com ing, and expressed a hope that it wouldn't be the last time that they should see him there. ' That it sha'n't, my men,' the boy said, at which there was a shout of approval. And directly afterwards there was a call for three cheers for the young lord, and these"], [213, "SO LORD ROSSMERE SANG ' WE'LL ALL GO A HUNTING TO-DAY.' Page 176."], [214, ""], [215, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 177 were given with right good will. Then he and Romer were out in the dim, dirty street, making their way homeward, and the Earl remembered for the first time that he had had no dinner and was very hungry. ' I'm sure I can't thank you enough \u25a0 \u2014 no, indeed I can't \u2014 half enough,' the Curate said, as Lord Rossmere flung himself into the saddle, and tipped the head man at the Livery Stables, just as the Cathedral bells chimed the half after ten. ' Bosh ! ' said the boy ; ' I liked it. I will tell my father about it. I daresay he will send books and things. Good - night. Perhaps I shall see you to-morrow \u2014 that is, if you come to the Strongs'. I say, why don't you ever come now ? She was remarking on it to-day, just before that horrid fellow turned up.' ' She \u2014 who ? ' asked the Curate. ' Miss Ina,' the boy answered, and James knew by the tone of his voice that what he had suspected was true, and the young Earl had lost his heart. He felt a stab of pain as he thought of all the wealth the boy was heir to, and how he could wed almost where he chose ; then he schooled himself. What was the use of a poor, penniless clergyman thinking of all that loveliness? In a few years, when his M"], [216, "i7S CATHEDRAL BELLS. beard was grown, this boy would make a fine manly husband. He would be almost content to give her up to such an one. By the tone of the boy's voice when he said the words ' Miss Ina,' he knew the lad held her in reverence. ' I hate him,' Rossmere said, breaking up the Curate's train of thought. ' Don't you? ' 'Hate who?' the latter asked, but he guessed. ' That fellow \u2014 Mackinnon.' ' I \u2014 I do not like him ' Like him ! ' echoed Rossmere. ' I should think not indeed ! ' ' And she remarked my absence, you say ? ' ' Yes ; she said she was afraid she had offended you. It isn't true, is it ? You're not offended with her, are you ? Come there at tea-time to-morrow, will you ? ' Rossmere, much as he liked his friend, did not want him at the Rectory before that time. He wanted to have Ina all to himself for an hour or so. At five he wished him to come, because he hated Mac kinnon, and Ina could not talk so much to the Banker if there were three of them there. ' Mind you turn up, old fellow,' he said,"], [217, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 179 stooping down to shake hands. ' Good-night, and I have enjoyed it very much.' ' What a nice young fellow he is,' James Romer thought, as he stood still in the street in front of his own lodgings. 'If I could bear to give her up \u2014 Psha ! I have done so. I keep forgetting that. God give her to some one who will guard and cherish her always,' he said, half out loud ; and he listed his hat and stood bareheaded in the pale, silvery moonlight. Then with a sigh he turned and went into the house. ' Well, of all the beautiful days we have had yet, I think this is the best,' Miss Eliza Bunbury said, as she and her sister settled themselves in the Strongs' fly on the after noon of the great garden-party at Stackfield. Mrs Strong and Ina were already in the cab, so that they were able to start straight from the Bunburys' house in the Crossgates. As the quartette, with the exception of the Palace and Deanery families, were the only people invited from Carswell, they had de cided on sharing the expense between them. The Bunburys were, as I have before said, far from rich. Stackfield was two miles out, and the fly would have to wait some hours for them."], [218, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 180 ' Yes ; I don't think we could have had a more perfect day,' Mrs Strong answered, but I doubt if the Misses Bunbury heard the answer. They were both looking at Ina, who, dressed entirely in grey, was looking her best. During the last few weeks, the fact that young Lord Rossmere was constantly at the girl's side had been the one topic of conversation, and mothers of marriageable daughters had grown irritable to a pitch that made such irritability dangerous. Certainly both the maiden ladies thought a prettier girl it would be difficult to find, but then what would Lady Stack allan say? The drive to Stackfield seemed long to the occupants of the fly. The day was a typical August one, and the heat of the sun was tremendous, while the clouds of dust which rose from under the wheels of the vehicle was anything but pleasant. It was with a feeling of relief that all four found themselves driving up to the great entrance, just as the turret chimes sounded five. Ina followed the rest of the party through the wide hall and a large airy sitting-room out on to the smooth lawn where Lady Stack allan and her daughters were receiving their guests. The girl had hardly shaken hands"], [219, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. \u25a0 i8r with her friend Beatrice before Lord Ross mere, who had been talking to Mrs Skelton, ran up to welcome her. ' You must come and have some tea,' he said. ' How late you are ! I thought you would never come.' There were only one or two chairs in the refreshment tent, originally intended for elderly people, but the boy secured one for Ina and made her sit down and take her tea in comfort. The tent was a thick one, and the sun's rays could not penetrate, while the long narrow tables looked very pretty indeed, covered with choice fruits and flowers, and made resplendent with the rich silver gilt tea services and purple china. And when Ina had finished her refresh ments, the two wandered off once more, first to the greenhouses to see the ferns, and then to a quiet spot where it was cool and pleasant ' But you ought to go and look after your other guests,' Ina urged more than once ; but the boy sat beside her on the rustic bench and declined to move. It was very still up there on the rising ground, under the shade of the trees. Far away at their feet they could hear the murmur of the gay crowd upon the lawn, and through the dense mass of leaves could distinguish now and then some-"], [220, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 182 thing of the moving mass of colour. ' Your mother will be vexed I am sure,' Ina said half-a-dozen times, but her warning had no effect. ' I have been looking forward for days to spending this afternoon with you, and I'm not going to be cheated out of it,' was the only reply she got. So Ina let herself be persuaded against her better judgment, and the pair sat on through the sultry August afternoon, sat on till the roll of carriages and the strains of ' God save the Queen,' from the military band, told that the hour of departure had come. ' I wonder how long it will be before we sit here together again ? ' the boy said, as they rose from their seats. 'Ah, I wonder!' ' My dear,' said Lady Stackallan, drawing her friend Miss Eliza Bunbury on one side, as Ina and Lord Rossmere came slowly towards the few visitors who yet lingered on the green lawn, ' my dear, it seems to me my son is always with your pretty little friend. All his letters have been full of her, and to day he has spent the entire afternoon with her. I am afraid this will lead people to make remarks. For rank or wealth, you know that I care nothing, but still, one in his posi-"], [221, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 183 tion cannot enjoy the freedom which belongs to other young men. Tell me, has there been any talk concerning it in Carswell ? ' Miss Eliza was truth itself. ' I'm afraid, dear Lady Stackallan, there has. People are very jealous, and the child is very pretty. Yes, they are talking.' Lady Stackallan shook her head. ' I must do something. His father has always been so anxious that he should marry my little niece Daisy Barrington, and it is what her own people desire above everything. For myself, I do not know. I do not like first cousin matches, and if I were alone should prefer to leave the boy unfettered in his choice. I am getting old now, but I am romantic still, you see,' with the quiet smile which all who knew Lady Stackallan loved to see upon her face. Lady Margaret Barrington was the only daughter of Lady Stackallan's brother the Duke of Berwick. She had been the acknow ledged beauty of two seasons, was six months younger than Lord Rossmere, and, it was thought, did not find that young gentleman the least bit in the world disagreeable. ' I am afraid he is very much smitten,' Miss Eliza answered, alluding to Ina and her young lover, and looking to where the pair were"], [222, "184 CATHEDRAL BELLS. bidding each other farewell. ' She is a dear little girl. Don't vex her, if you can help it, Lady Stackallan.' ' I'll try not. Good-bye.' Then the Strongs and the Bunburys put themselves into their fly and drove away. A breeze stirred the leaves as they did so, and it seemed to Ina as though they whispered good-bye too. ' If you please, Miss, Lady Stackallan is in the drawing-room, and wishes to see you.' Ina was sitting in her own room at the Rectory, about four o'clock on the afternoon of the day after the garden-party at Stack field, when Martha made the above announce ment to her. 'Wants to see me? Did you tell her Mrs Strong was out?' 'Yes, Miss, but she asked if you were in, and when I said yes, she said she wished to see you. It was her ladyship who rang the bell herself. She left the footman down along with the carriage at the Dean's Gate.' ' I am so sorry mamma is out,' Ina said, as she entered the drawing-room, and found Lady Stackallan waiting for her. ' She has gone with papa to a meeting at Littlemore, and I don't expect them back till seven o'clock.'"], [223, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 185 ' Never mind, my dear,' the visitor an swered, taking the girl's hand in hers and giving it an affectionate squeeze. ' Truth to tell, I am not sorry to find you alone, for I want to have a little chat with you.' 'Yes, Lady Stackallan?' Ina said, glancing at the little woman who looked at her so kindly \u2014 so very kindly, the girl thought. ' It's not an easy subject to mention, \u2014 what I am going to talk about. My dear, you must forgive me if I say any thing which hurts you. Indeed, I do not wish to do so. People who have known me for a long time \u2014 people like the Miss Bunburys, for instance \u2014 will tell you that I am not one who likes saying things that seem unkind.' 'I am sure of that,' Ina answered, with a little smile. ' Thank you. And now, my dear, it's this. My boy has been here a great deal lately, and though I have the utmost horror of interfering in this sort of thing, you know his position is not like that of other young men. Do not think, dear child, I care for, or value, this world's honours. I do not. I have lived long enough to know what poor things they are, even at their best ; still, they bring their duties and responsibilities."], [224, "186 CATHEDRAL BELLS. Now it has always been my husband's great wish that our boy should marry Daisy Bar rington, my niece. She would bring him a great fortune, and though to my mind he has enough \u2014 more than enough \u2014 still, it is my husband's chief wish, and that of my brother, the Duke. Now, I hear that people are talking of his devotion to you, and if it was to reach my husband's ears, he would be seriously annoyed ; and as to the Berwicks \u2014 well, I do not know what effect it might not have ! Do not think I am blaming you. I am not ; but I am afraid if his father should hear of it, he would send him quite away \u2014 perhaps for a year and more. My dear, I do not wish that. I have a reason \u2014 a strong, strong reason,' laying her hand on the girl's shoulder, and speaking with extra ordinary earnestness, ' for wishing that he should not be far away from me now. Per haps, some day, you will know what I mean, and then \u2014 then you will understand \u2014 you will understand. Now, what I am going to ask you, is that you will tell him he must not come to see you again for the present. He will be going to Oxford in October, and then I hope that you will come and stay with us. Do you forgive me for asking this ? ' ' Oh, Lady Stackallan, yes ! But I hope"], [225, "187 CATHEDRAL BELLS. \u2014 I do hope you don't think me to blame. He is such a dear, sweet boy, but then he is only a boy. I never thought it could matter. I know that he is devoted to me just now, but he will quite forget me very soon. At his age it doesn't last \u2014 at least, so people say. Of course I will tell him, but I am afraid that he will be dreadfully hurt ; and I can't tell you what it will be to me. He is just like a favourite brother, coming and going as he likes. It will be hard,' and the blue-grey eyes looked very sad. ' Thank you, my dear,' the Marchioness said. ' And now I had better go. Ross said he was coming here this afternoon, so I don't want him to find me, though of course you may say I asked you to stop his coming. Good-bye, my dear. I thank you very much.' Lady Stackallan kissed the girl twice. ' I don't wonder that he found you very sweet, dear,' the little woman said, and then with a sigh went down the Dean's walk to her carriage. ' Not come any more ! you can't \u2014 you can't mean it ! ' exclaimed Lord Rossmere as with flushed face and flashing eyes he stood in front of Ina in the little drawing room, just an hour after Lady Stackallan had driven away."], [226, "188 CATHEDRAL BELLS. ' But I do mean it.' The girl's face was very white, and her hands shook. She was very nearly crying herself. ' But why ? What have I done ? ' pleaded the young fellow. 'Oh, Ina, don't send me away \u2014 don't \u2014 don't ! ' ' My dear boy, I must. People \u2014 it's very stupid of them, but there it is \u2014 people are talking. You mustn't forget that you cannot do the things that other young men can. You have a great, stupid title tacked on to you. Come, don't look in such a way. It's no use to get into a passion, and it's not my fault. We are not going to be enemies ; and I daresay in a few months you will be allowed, if you are very good, to come and sec me. Now, though it's not the young lady's place to suggest it, still, as you have been quite a nice little sort of temporary brother to me, I'll do what you asked the other day ; only if I do, then you must go away quietly. Come and give me a kiss, and say good-bye.' ' Ina,' the poor boy gasped, flinging him self on his knees and pressing his lips to hers, ' oh, Ina, I can't say it. Listen \u2014 I love you I want to marry you.' ' My dear, dear boy, you mustn't be so"], [227, ""], [228, "\u2022I LOVE YOU ! OH, DON'T SEND ME AWAY.'

It's very sweet of you to care for me like that, and I shall always feel very proud of the offer you have made me ; but, dear, I cannot think of it. No, you mustn't ask me any questions. And now I think you had better leave me.' ' I cannot,' bursting into a flood of boyish, passionate tears. ' I love you. Oh, don't send me away,' and he flung his arms round the girl. For a minute Ina remained quite quiet. She felt if she ventured to speak she should burst out crying, and for the first time she realised that she was very nearly in love with the boy herself. By-and-by she schooled herself. ' Ross,' she said, calling him by the name he was called at home, ' Ross, you mustn't. You say you love me \u2014 well, prove it. Take your arms away, and leave me. There \u2014 that's a good old boy. And now go, dear, and God bless you.' 1 If I go I'll never come back ! I'll shoot myself. If I mayn't see you, I don't wish to live.

' And that \u2014 that is all you have to say to me?' ' No, dear, not quite all,' Ina answered. ' Listen, Ross. I am very sorry for all this. Indeed, dear, I did not know you cared so much about me. And now, good-bye. Come, won't you shake hands? \u2014 do \u2014 just to show we don't part in anger.' ' Will you let me come as I used ? ' ' I cannot.' ' Then I won't shake hands with you. I\u2014 you \u2014 you are cruel \u2014 cruel.' ' Good-bye,' Ina said softly again, and moved towards the door. Rossmere started up. ' Stop ! ' he exclaimed hoarsely. ' You needn't do that. I'll go, but I will never speak to you again. You are not the girl I thought you were.' Then without another word the boy turned, and dashed from the room. A moment later and the door banged behind him. And Ina \u2014 Ina sat down again, and burst out crying. When Mr Mackinnon called at the usual hour of six he received the unusual answer, ' Not at home.'"], [231, "CHAPTER VIII. ' A villain with a smiling cheek A goodly apple rotten at the heart ; O what a goodly outside falsehood hath ! ' Merchant of Venice. It was a week after the events recorded in my last chapter, and Mr Mackinnon was sitting at the breakfast-table in his comfortable rooms in West Street. He had finished his morning meal, and was lazily glancing through the Times before setting forth for the bank. A pile of letters which had just come in re mained unopened beside him. Mr Mackinnon occupied the whole of the first floor of an old-fashioned house nearly opposite the Cathedral. There was a draw ing-room looking out into the quiet street, and out of it a dining-room, while beyond this again was the bedroom, the whole three apart ments being not only well, but even handsomely furnished. The junior partner in the house of Hammer, Highlight, Festing & Co. \u2014 Mr Mackinnon, like Mark Tapley, being the Co."], [232, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 192 \u25a0 \u2014 was in receipt of the tidy income of seven hundred a year, and could, therefore, afford to have things nice about him. He sat there glancing at the Times, and thinking \u2014 thinking should he propose to Ina. He laid down the paper and began to revolve the question. He had done this very often during the last week or two. Had the girl got money? That was the point. He wished he could find out. True, he had more than sufficient to marry on if he liked, but then he did not so like. He had always told himself that he would not marry under a thousand a year, and unless Ina had a prospect of three hundred pounds a year in the future, he would be some way off that comfortable sum. What a pity it was that Mr Strong did not bank with his own firm instead of with the Carswell Banking Associa tion, Mackinnon thought. If he had only done so, then he himself would have known all the ins and outs of the reverend gentleman's pecuniary affairs. True, he knew Prior, the manager of the before-mentioned Association, but then he and Prior were on the worst possible terms ; besides, it would never do for him \u2014 a partner in another firm \u2014 to inquire concerning the account of a customer at an opposition bank ; added to which, no manager"], [233, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 193 would answer such inquiry, much less Prior. Who was there who could tell him of old Strong's affairs ? There wasn't any one. By the-way, though, there was \u2014 Romer ! Very likely the Curate knew. Strong was on in timate terms with the fellow, Mackinnon re flected, as he leant back in his chair. He would see what he could do with him. If that failed, then he must endeavour to get some thing out of one of the clerks at the Carswell Banking Association. They had just taken a fellow on there of the name of Prentice. He \u2014 Mackinnon \u2014 had spoken to him on busi ness when he had called there with reference to some cheque only last week. He might get more out of a new hand than an old one. It would, however, be more convenient if he could get the information from Romer. Cer tainly it would be very nice if he found that Ina had money of her own. In such case, he would without doubt ask her to be his wife. There was no one else so generally admired as the girl, and he would enjoy the triumph of carrying her off from the other men. That fool of a Curate, whom he was going to ' pump,' was in love with her too. He hated the starv ing idiot who was always coming to ask him to subscribe to this charity or that. And that boy- \u2014 that young lord \u2014 he was also smitten N"], [234, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 194 with Ina's charms. He had not been there lately. He must ask Ina about that. He did not want the intimacy broken off, because if he himself married the girl, it would suit him well that his wife should be intimate at Stack field. With the exception of those old women in the Crossgates, the Strongs had been the only people invited to the garden-party. It would be pleasant if he should succeed in getting into the county set. And then he wanted the girl for himself, \u2014 wanted her because her beauty ap pealed to his senses, and he would take a pride and a pleasure in it. Of love in its truest and noblest sense Mackinnon knew nothing. The clock on the mantelpiece ticked away, and presently the little chimes rang forth ten ! The Cathedral bells had stopped, and it was time for him to go to his work. Mr Mac kinnon rose slowly from the table, and as he did so his eyes fell on the unopened letters. He took them up one by one, and glanced at the writings. When he came to the last of the batch he gave a start. It bore the Edinburgh postmark, and was from his mother. More than eight years had elapsed since Mr Mackinnon had received a letter from home. Never since his answer to his mother's last appeal to assist her in insuring her life for the benefit of her daughters, had he received"], [235, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 195 any news of his relatives. He held the letter in his hand, but he did so without emotion. No tender thoughts of bygone days, no longing to know how things were with those nearest to him in blood, came to him. He was simply wondering why his mother had written. Then he turned the envelope over and tore it open. It was long indeed, wrote Mrs Mackinnon to her son, since she had heard of him, and they had been speaking of him the night be fore. She was an old woman now, and though her health was yet good, still in the ordinary course of things she could not hope for her life to be prolonged for any very lengthy period. ' Think not,' she went on, ' that I have any other purpose than this in writing to you. I have none, indeed. The old question of the insurance has been solved by the girls them selves. I daresay you will remember how clever they always were at dressmaking, and for many years past they have been in respon sible posts in Wilson's, the great milliners here ; and what they have earned annually has been nearly equal to the sum which I originally asked you to contribute towards the insurance. I, out of my income, have paid"], [236, "196 CATHEDRAL BELLS. the remainder ; and thus I can rest comfort ably in my bed at night, feeling that at my death the girls will receive five thousand pounds. They work hard, poor things, but they have got accustomed to it, and the evenings, when they have returned home, are very pleasant. I wish that you could share them with us. Is there any prospect of your coming north dur ing your next vacation ? Annie and Char lotte join me in this hope. I daresay you will have noticed that I write to you, after this long lapse of time, on the anniversary of your dear father's death ! ' No, Mackinnon had not noticed it. The seventeenth of August. So it was. How well he remembered that day. Of his father's failing health he, as a boy, had known nothing. The Doctor had been home to luncheon, and had started off on his rounds again, and he \u2014 Gregory Mackinnon \u2014 had been standing in the hall when the two rings had come quickly one after the other. He remem bered the door being opened and seeing a little crowd on the steps, and recollected his mother coming out on to the landing, and Mr M'Bean, the clergyman, trying to lead her away, and she striving with him and saying, ' No, no \u2014 no, no ! ' over and over again, and"], [237, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 197 wringing her hands. He put the letter in his pocket and went and stood in the draw ing-room window, looking out into the quiet thoroughfare. A great author has said, and said truly, that there are yielding moments in the lives of the hardest among us. As Mackinnon stood there, with the echo of the Cathedral chimes still sounding in his ears, a vague feeling of regret for the past seemed stealing over him. He thought of his mother's face on that day when his father had been taken so suddenly from them, \u2014 thought of his sisters weeping, and clinging to her, and he felt that an opportunity had been given to him, and that he had failed to grasp it. As he stood thus, silent and alone, there came over him the impulse to sit down and write, then and there, before going to the Bank, saying how welcome was the home-letter, and that he would certainly strive to run down and see them in the course of the next few weeks. He turned towards the writing-table to carry out the idea, when he remembered that the letter would be a difficult one to write. No ; he would not attempt the task then, but in the evening, after his day's work was done. Then he took up his hat and went downstairs."], [238, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 198 Very handsome and spruce the Banker looked in his well-fitting clothes as he made his way under the limes towards 'the High.' Some of the windows were open in the great Cathedral, and he could hear the organ peal- ing, and the voices of the choir chanting the praises of the common Father of all. It was very pretty. Mr Mackinnon stopped to listen. Yes ; certainly the effect was pleasant. It was all nonsense, of course, and waste of time, but that was no business of his. He himself went there every Sunday, because, for a man occupying the position which he did in Carswell, it was only respectable that he should do so, he thought. He did not be- lieve a word of the whole thing, but he joined in the singing for all that, because it looked well. He was a clever man, and well- read in a way \u2014 that is, he made a point of reading most of the articles which appeared in the Nineteenth Century, the Fortnightly, and other magazines, from the pens of leading men, and it seemed to him that modern science had swept away God. As he went slowly along the quiet street, listening to the voices of the choir, a vague regret came over him for the loss of his childish faith. As a rule, he was inclined to sneer at it all, but just then, with his mother's letter in his"], [239, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 199 pocket, and the sound of the chanting in his ears, he did not feel tempted to do so. Then, steps coming towards him broke up his train of thought, and Mackinnon, looking up, saw the very person he wanted to see, \u2014 namely, Mr Romer. 'How do you do, Romer?' he said, stopping and holding out his hand, much to the Curate's astonishment. ' Very pretty, isn't it, to hear the singing? I often stop and listen as I go along to the Bank. Easier work than mine. I wish I could make money by intoning for half an hour morning and evening. I tell you what it is, the Church is a first-rate billet for a man who has got interest to push him, and I'm almost sorry I didn't go in for it ' \u2014 he wasn't in the least, \u2014 'why, there's old Fisher at Aldermere, who has been drawing one thou sand five hundred pounds a year for the last forty years ! Some of those fellows here, too ' \u2014 nodding his head in the direction of the Close \u2014 ' they have snug things. Our friend Strong, for instance, with his living, and the Lectureship at King Edward's \u2014 he makes a tidy little sum. Has private means, too, I suppose ? ' ' I \u2014 I do not know,' stammered the Curate. ' Don't know ! ' echoed the Banker ; ' why, how on earth have you been with him all these years, and yet not found that out ? '"], [240, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 200 ' It is not likely that Mr Strong would confide to me a thing which concerns himself alone, and it is not very likely that I should inquire about what can be no possible concern of mine,' the Curate answered stiffly, drawing himself up as he spoke. Somehow, Mackinnon forgot the short trousers and wrinkled socks as the clergyman spoke. ' Concerns himself alone ! ' repeated the Banker. ' I don't see how you make that out. Strong can't live for ever. I should think his wife and daughter would consider his private means had a good deal to do with them, that is, if pretty Miss Ina doesn't marry before the sad event takes place,' laughing a little, as though the Rector's death could hardly be regarded as a matter of the smallest possible import ance. ' Judging, though, from what I have seen, I should say he had three or four hundred a year of his own, eh ? What do you think ? ' ' I do not know \u2014 I have no idea \u2014 I have never thought,' Romer answered. ' Good heavens ! What a fool the fellow is ! ' reflected the Banker. ' I suppose, though, he knows what a sight he is, and that no girl would look at him ; still, for a man to be in love, and yet never to wonder whether the woman is likely to possess any money \u2014 a starving man, too ! \u2014 that beats anything.' ' Ah,"], [241, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 201 I forgot, Mr Romer,' he said aloud, 'that you belong to another world, and despise the things of this one. I was thinking you were a poor mundane creature like myself.' The Curate did not answer. For all his nervous manner and peculiar ways, no one had a clearer brain than James Romer, and he saw in a moment that he was being pumped. For an instant he did wonder what it could possibly matter to one in Mackinnon's position whether Mr Strong had money or not to leave behind him ; then the scales seemed to fall from his eyes, and he compre hended the reason of the Banker's inquiries. Conscious of his own deep love and veneration for Ina, the crafty, calculating instincts of his rival seemed horrible beyond description. If he could have told Ina, \u2014 could have warned her of the sort of man Mackinnon really was ! But it was impossible. He was a rival. She would naturally think that he was actuated by jealousy. And then he hated to attack any one behind his back. He must be silent, and pray to God that she might be kept from linking her life with one so utterly unworthy of her as Mackinnon. How different were this man's feelings from his own ! how completely inferior to those of the poor love-sick boy, who in his wretched-"], [242, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 202 ness had come to him, and poured forth his tale of Ina's dismissal of him, and all his woe ! ' Well, I must be going ! ' exclaimed the Banker, preparing to pass on. ' Time is gold, you know. Ta-ta.' 'Stop! \u2014 I mean \u2014 I beg your pardon, \u2014 but will you please wait a moment!' James ex claimed. ' I wanted to speak to you upon a matter of great importance \u2014 indeed I was thinking of calling at your rooms. You know those cottages on Piffin's Wharf, which I spoke to you about a long time ago?' 'What cottages on Piffin's Wharf?' asked Mr Mackinnon sharply. ' Those you purchased, you know \u2014 the ones I asked you about in April.' ' I wonder who told you I had purchased them ? ' ' Mr Manley did. I went to him to ask the landlord's name last March, for I heard they had changed hands, and he told me you were the owner.' ' Manley is an old fool, and if it wasn't for the trouble of the thing, I'd take the whole of my papers away from his office. A nice solicitor indeed, to go chatting over his clients' investments ! ' ' I don't think he meant any harm,' broke in Mr Romer eagerly, fearing he might have"], [243, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 203 done the poor old lawyer an injury; 'indeed, it is pretty well known now, for only a few weeks ago one of your tenants told me that Charting had informed him you were the owner.' Charting was the chief builder in Carswell, and the man who, from time to time, repaired the Cathedral walls and roof. ' Hang Charting,' Mackinnon answered. ' Well, what is it you want to say to me, Mr Romer?' ' The same thing I said last time. They are not in a sanitary state \u2014 indeed, they are not. Three years ago we had several cases of typhoid fever in them, and this hot weather makes me very anxious. Only a day or two ago the Parish Doctor told me there were several nasty throats there, and one case of diphtheria \u2014 young Jollick.' ' Bother the Parish Doctor, and young Jollick too! What the deuce do I care? The cottages are all right. If they don't like them, let them take houses elsewhere. I can get plenty more tenants.' ' I know that,' Romer answered, ' because of the situation. Men whose labour calls them to the Canal, must live near it, and Piffin's Wharf is about the best site I know for bargees' cottages. People of that class have but little knowledge of sanitary science. They do not reflect that bad drains may"], [244, "2o4 CATHEDRAL BELLS. mean death to some of their families. I wish you would have it rectified.' ' Nonsense ! Pooh ! Why should I ? The drains are all right. I can't afford to do any thing, letting them at the low rental I do.' ' Low rental ! ' echoed James Romer. ' Why, Mr Mackinnon, they are more expensive than any other cottages in the parish ! ' ' Haven't you just said they stand in the best position ? Exactly so. And do you suppose I'm to charge nothing for that? I call them low rented \u2014 absolutely low rented.' 'And I call them high,' the Curate answered firmly. ' D \u2014 nation ! ' was the Banker's only reply. ' And you will do nothing then ? ' Certainly not. Why should I ? ; ' I have done my duty, Mr Mackinnon,' Romer answered. ' No doubt the Parish Doctor will speak to you. He told me he wrote some time ago to Mr Manley, who collects the rents, but that he could get nothing done. You will forgive my saying so, but you assume a serious responsibility.' ' All right \u2014 that's my affair,' the Banker re torted, and then, with a curt nod of the head strode away. The clock of the Cross chimed the quarter to eleven as Mr Mackinnon passed that grey"], [245, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 205 memorial of the past, and he hurried along ' the High ' till he came to the glass doors leading into the Bank. His usual hour for arriving was ten or fifteen minutes after the doors were open to the public, but being a partner, his late appearance on the scene was of no importance to any one but himself. He passed the long line of studious clerks poring over the ledgers, and casting up great columns of accounts, or entering cheques \u2014 ' stuff,' I believe, is the correct banking ex pression \u2014 in the big books, nodded to one of the firm standing near, and then entered his own little sanctum. Then he touched the hand-bell on his table, and a clerk rushed in. ' Yes, sir.' ' What time do the clerks leave the Cars well Banking Association ? ' ' Between half-past five and six, \u2014 none of them after six, sir.' Mackinnon nodded, and sat down to his day's work, in which he was usually deeply engrossed whilst he was at it. He had only been banking nine years, but he knew more about it than Mr Hammer, who had been at it for half a century ; 01 Mr Festing, who had sat in the Bank for the last thirty years. Both the senior partners were aware"], [246, "206 CATHEDRAL BELLS. of this, and though they valued their junior, I do not think either of them liked him. The clerks simply detested him. But somehow that morning Mr Mackinnon found that his attention wandered. His mind kept going back to things of the past, \u2014 to his home in far-off Edinburgh, and to his mother's face as he had last seen it. He wondered if she was much changed, and as he thought this, he took out the letter, and read it through again. The Cathedral clock had gone half- past five, when Mr Mackinnon left his room, and putting on his hat passed out into ' the High.' The junior partner did not, as was his usual custom, turn to the left, and hurry off to Saint Mary's Rectory to receive a cup of tea from Ina's fair hands ; on the contrary, he turned to the right, and began to lounge slowly along towards the Farmers' Exchange, a great, ugly Heathen-Temple sort of building situated nearly opposite to the Carswell Banking Asso ciation. Up and down he went looking into this shop window or that, until raising his eyes, he saw coming towards him the very person he was in search of, namely young Prentice, the new clerk of whom I have already spoken. He looked at the sandy-haired youth absently and then as the latter touched his hat, he"], [247, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 207 allowed a light of recognition to appear on his face. ' How are you ? ' he said, in a friendly tone. ' You haven't seen Shorley, have you ? ' Shorley was the Town Clerk. ' No, sir ; I have not, sir.' ' Confound it ! Here have I been waiting about to catch him for the last ten minutes. By - the - way, I hope that cheque affair was all right \u2014 I mean the one I brought across to you?' ' Oh, yes, sir. It was a mistake of the Dublin bankers.' Mackinnon laughed pleasantly. ' The worst set of fellows to do business with that ever lived. Let a man set up in Dublin or any part of Ireland, either as a bootmaker or a banker, I care not which, and deal with him, and you'll find he's a dunderhead. How do you like banking ? ' ' Pretty well, sir, thank you.' Prentice was beginning to regret that he had not waited till there was a vacancy in Messrs Hammer, Highlight, Festing & Co.'s establishment. \u2022 And you'll like it more if you stick to it, Mackinnon answered cordially. ' There's no reason why a clerk shouldn't die a bank manager, even perhaps a partner, if he will"], [248, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 208 only keep his eyes open. That's the great secret \u2014 keep your eyes open \u2014 know all about it \u2014 have everything at your fingers' ends. I daresay now you know the amount of most of your customers' annual incomes, eh ? That's the sort of thing a man should remember. Of course a customer may baffle his banker by keeping two accounts, but most people in Carswell have only one. In a nice sleepy place like this, we have not the worldly wisdom and worldly distrust which belongs to the London man of business. Do you find you begin to know these sort of things ? ' ' You mean, sir, the customers' incomes ? ' ' Exactly ; and from what sources they are derived, and all that sort of thing?' ' I don't think I do, sir ; certainly not the last ; but if you think it is of importance for a clerk who wishes to rise, of course I will take notice of it' ' Do, and you will find it of service. I expect I and my partners will be trying to induce you in a short time to desert your present post and come over to our shop,' smiling pleasantly. ' I only wish such good fortune was likely to happen to me,' answered the elated Prentice- ' Eh ? \u2014 do you mean you really wish it ? asked Mackinnon. ' Very much so indeed, sir.'"], [249, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 209 ' H'm ! Well, it is quite possible it may lie in my power to assist you. We shall, I think, be making changes this autumn, and if so, I will let you know, and do my best for you. By the way, Mr Prentice, now I come to think of it, it is in your power to assist me in a little affair, only, of course, this is in strict confidence. A friend of mine \u2014 a customer of yours, in fact ' \u2014 speaking as though Prentice was already a banker himself \u2014 'talks of being involved, and all sorts of things. I believe myself it's a mere delusion, but if you could find out for me, I should be much obliged. It is Mr Strong, the Rector of Saint Mary's. What I want to know is, how much he has besides the six hundred pounds a year from the living, and the one hundred pounds from the King Edward Lectureship, and from what sources it is derived. It is so difficult to get him to explain matters ; and though he is most anxious that I should help him in the management of his affairs, still, really he is in such a state of confusion, that unless I find this out, I can't do much for him. Of course you understand that this is all in confidence between you and me ? ' ' Oh yes, sir, certainly, sir,' Prentice answered, much flattered. ' Well then, let me know as soon as you 0"], [250, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 210 can, will you ? It's only the private income I want to know about \u2014 in fact, anything you can tell me. His banking books for the last few years would help you.' ' Yes, sir ; I will endeavour to let you know, but it would be difficult just at present. I believe Strutt who has the customers' banking books, is going to give up shortly, in which case, the head cashier told me the other day I should be promoted to his place, and that Mr Prior intended to take on a new clerk to do my present work. Of course, if this happens, I could very soon let you know, sir, all you wish. I will endeavour to get a sight of Mr Strong's books before if it is possible, so as not to keep you waiting, but it will be difficult. But, sir, I hope you won't let out anything about me ? It's as much as my crib is worth.' ' Rely on me,' Mackinnon answered, ' and run no risks. I would far rather wait a few weeks, or months, for the information, than that there should be any fuss ; for poor Strong is a funny fellow, and very touchy. As to your crib, I don't think you'll want it very long. If I find you the sharp fellow I think you are, I fancy I can put a good thing in your way at no distant date. By-bye. It is no use my waiting here any longer for Shorley.' It was with rather a jaunty air that the junior"], [251, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 211 partner passed along High Street, through the quiet cloisters, to the door of Saint Mary's Rec tory. Mrs Strong was out, and Ina was lying in her garden chair alone. A little tea-table stood near, and Mackinnon was soon regaled with a cup. ' What's become of young Rossmere ? ' the Banker asked. ' He used to be always here, but now I never see him.' A little flush came on the girl's face. The boy had been very dear to her. It was only after he had actually given up coming that she found how very much she really liked him. He had been so completely her slave, that even if she had not been fond of him she would have missed his presence. Once only had she seen him since their parting, and that was when she was driving out with Mrs Maycott, and they had come across the young Earl riding sadly along, lost in thought. He had just lifted his cap \u2014 that was all, and Ina \u2014 Ina had come home sad for her 'play fellow,' as she used laughingly to call him. ' Why do you want to know ? ' she asked carelessly, not wishing to tell the tale, and yet knowing the power Mackinnon had over her, and that if he pressed for a reply, she would be compelled to give it. ' Only because he seemed a nice young fellow,' the Banker answered."], [252, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 212 ' I don't think he thought you were,' Ina returned, breaking into a merry peal of laughter, recalling the boy's furious jealousy of Mr Mackinnon. The latter laughed also. ' Perhaps it was natural on his part,' he said, with rather a vain laugh. 'Why natural?' the girl asked a little coldly, and Mackinnon saw that he had made a mistake, and hastened to rectify it. ' Natural that he should wish to be here alone \u2014 to have you to himself. I have never seen any one more in love at that age.' ' And that is why he is not allowed to come,' Ina answered. ' He is destined to marry a rich cousin. Don't ask me any more about it. I assure you I miss him dreadfully, hourly. He is just the dearest, jolliest boy in existence, and if it hadn't been for his having a tiresome title, no one would have thought of troubling about it, or if they had, it wouldn't have mattered.' Ina, as she spoke, rose slowly from her chair, and began to walk towards the end of the garden. ' What are you going to do ? ' Mackinnon asked, rising and joining her. 'Only to gather some flowers. Why?' 'Oh, because I haven't much time to-night,"], [253, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 213 and I wanted to sit and talk to you. I haven't seen you for ages \u2014 not since the day before yesterday.' I'll come and sit down, if you like,' the girl answered, ' though, goodness knows, I should have thought you'd had enough sitting at the Bank ! ' Mackinnon smiled, ' That kind of sitting doesn't give much rest,' he said. 'This is the sort of chair to sit in, not a hard Oxford one, which suggests work the moment you look at it. There, now you are down too. Tell me all the news.' 'News!' echoed Ina. 'Who ever heard of news in Carswell ? Mr Romer is coming here presently, that's all I can tell you. He hasn't been for weeks, but sent a note in to mother to-day, saying he wished to see me about the Sunday School, and would look in at seven o'clock.' ' I wish the Sunday School was further,' Mackinnon returned. ' Why do you trouble yourself with it ? Sunday afternoon is the only afternoon in the week which I could spend with you, and as it is, I have to wait till half past five before I can come and call. I wish you would give it up. I am sure it's much too hard work for you in such hot weather as this. Do give it up.'"], [254, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 214 ' It's a great bore, certainly, but my father would scold me if I resigned my class, and poor Mr Romer he would be so disappointed. His whole heart is in the school.' Mackinnon did not answer for a moment. It would not do to abuse Romer to the girl \u2014 he had found that out. He hated the lean Curate, had always done so, indeed, ever since he first saw him ; but since that morning he hated him more than ever. The Sunday School class was a great nuisance. But for it there was no reason why he should not come to the Rectory at four o'clock, or even earlier. Be sides which, it would hurt Romer if the girl gave the thing up, and he wanted to hurt him. Hang the fellow ! what did he mean by coming and attacking him about those cottages ? He would pay him out for that. He would spoil his opportunity of seeing Ina. Every time he put the question to the girl, ' Who brought you home from the school ? ' he received he same answer \u2014 ' Mr Romer.' He would try and put a stop to it. ' But there are plenty of other young ladies who could take your place \u2014 plenty who are stronger, and not so much wanted elsewhere as you are, Ina.' ' Oh, I shouldn't like to give it up,' the girl answered. ' Poor man ! he has had enoueh o"], [255, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 215 trouble lately without my adding to it. And he is so proud of the School, too, and he thinks the children like me.' ' I can believe that,' Mackinnon answered So you won't do it then ? You prefer to oblige Romer to me ? ' He turned his dark, handsome eyes on Ina as he spoke, and let a ring of disappointment come into his voice. ' You know I don't,' the girl returned softly. ' Won't you prove it then, Ina ? Sunday is the only afternoon I can spare. We might spend such pleasant times together out here. No, I see you won't, and all because of this fellow.' ' It isn't only that,' Ina began, and then stopped. ' Well ? ' ' I mean I think it's right to do it, ' Right ! ' echoed Mackinnon. ' Ah, child are you sure of that? Are there not dozens of young ladies in the parish capable of in structing these children in their Catechism ? Did it never strike you that you might do a thousand times more good by taking me in hand, than by teaching these babes, who no more doubt that God reigns and is good than I do that the sun is shining, or that you are fair and beautiful and full of everything that is best ? '"], [256, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 216 ' And do you doubt it ? ' the girl asked, turning to him a face across which a shadow of pain had fallen at his words. ' Ina \u2014 yes. It is better that I should tell you this. In your presence, child, I feel an inclination to return to the belief of my childish days. When I am with you, I seem to get back something of what I have lost. Little by little that which was once as dear to me as it is now to you, has gone from me amidst the toils and cares of business. You are the one sweet and holy influence in my life. When I leave your presence, I go forth a better man. Think what those two hours alone with you of a Sunday afternoon would be to me \u2014 an oasis \u2014 a spring of water in the dreary desert of my life \u2014 my lonely life. Take me in hand, Ina ; hand over these little ones to some one else. Your sweet influence, your trust and faith in God, will lead me back. I am storm tossed by doubt, beset by a thousand tempta tions. When I am with you, Ina \u2014 you, so pure and innocent \u2014 I believe that, after all, there is something good in humanity. Child, child ! it is the dawn of faith. Till I knew you I did not believe in any man or woman on earth. You have given me back my belief in humanity, lead me on to believe in the Maker of it' He caught the girl's hand in his as he"], [257, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 217 spoke, and for a moment, partly brought there by his own eloquence, partly by the beauty of the fair innocent face before him \u2014 the light of something better than mere passion shone in his eyes. ' Choose, Ina,\" he said, after a little pause, and in a quieter tone, ' choose between pleasing me or Romer.' For a moment the girl was silent. She knew in her own heart that she intended to do as Gregory Mackinnon asked. But poor James ! It would be a bitter disappointment to him. Well, after all, that was partly his own fault. If he never took the trouble to call except upon business, he could not be surprised if she did not put herself out of the way for him. 'Which is it?' Mackinnon asked again, break ing in upon the girl's train of thought, and as he put the question he turned his handsome face full on her. ' I will do what you ask,' she answered ten derly ; and then after a little pause, she added, laughingly, and in her usual playful way, ' it's much more than you deserve, sir.' ' Much, I know,' Mackinnon answered gravely, listing her hand to his lips. The conversation drifted away after this to other and less serious topics, and it was past seven before the junior partner rose to go. Ina went with him to the hall door, and, just as she turned to re-enter"], [258, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 218 the house, she beheld Mr Romer coming up Dean's Walk with rapid strides. ' Give up the class ! \u2014 the School ! ' echoed the Curate, when Ina, a few minutes later, in formed him of her intention. He had not spoken to her all these weeks except on business, and then only for a few seconds at a time, but when he heard that there was a danger of his no longer enjoying even that much of her society, his heart sank within him. He had resolved to give her up, and during these past weeks he had striven with all his might to put her image from him, at least he believed he had so striven, but now he saw how poor such struggle had been, and how the girl was just as dear to him as ever. 'You can't mean it,' he went on after a moment's pause ; ' I'm sure you can't.' ' But I do,' returned Ina. She was hurt with him for never once having been to see her, and piqued at his altered manner. She supposed he had changed to her because he had seen some one he liked better. Very likely it was that stupid, fair haired Miss Boulderson, whose father was the Canon then in residence, and whom some people called pretty. Ina thought her an idiot, and it must be admitted that she knew nothing save about Sunday Schools and Dorcas"], [259, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 219 Meetings. After pretending to be devoted to her all this time, to desert her as he had done. Canon Boulderson's term of residence would only last another fortnight, and then, where would he be ? Well, it would just serve him right. ' But I do mean it,' Ina said again. ' But why ? ' James asked, standing in front of her in the deserted garden, in the sweet coolness of the sunset hour. 'Why? I never knew you dreamed of such a thing ! And I came here to know if you would take the first class of girls for the next six weeks, as Mrs Herriott is going away for that time ? I would rather you took them than any one else.' 'Would you?' returned Ina, making him a mocking little curtsey. ' Are you quite sure ? I'm dreadfully flattered, I assure you, or rather, I should be if I believed it, but I don't. I suppose Miss Boulderson refused, and then you came to me.' ' Miss Boulderson ! ' echoed James. ' I never thought of such a thing. Why should I ask her ? ' Then after a moment's pause, ' Would you mind telling me why you said that ? \u2014 why you mentioned her name ? ' Only because I understood she was such a great friend of yours,' Ina answered. 'What made you understand such a thing?' the Curate asked."], [260, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 220 All his nervousness had vanished. He stood in front of the girl he loved, calm, almost stern. I heard it \u2014 every one says it. 'Please tell me their names, Miss I \u2014 Miss Strong.' 'Certainly not. Do you fancy I am going to be dragged in for a real Carswell dispute ? ' ' You don't suppose I should say you told me, do you ? ' he asked. ' I think you would very soon be made to give up your authority. I certainly sha'n't say who told me. Besides, why should you mind ? She is nice-looking, at least some people say so, and she \u2014 no, I won't say what I was going to say. Really, Mr Romer, it sounds horribly rude, but I must go in. You know how punctual papa is about dinner, and besides, Canon Anson is coming and both the Miss Bunburys. I have only a quarter of an hour left to dress. I can't stay now to talk about a substitute for the School. Mamma told me you said seven o'clock in your note, but it was ten minutes past when you came.' ' And you mean what you say \u2014 you give up the children \u2014 everything ? ' ' Yes, I mean it' She was sorry, now she came to think about it, but she believed it was right. She had a duty to perform to Mr Mackinnon,"], [261, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 221 only she could not tell James Romer that. The Curate's own disappointment was so plainly written on his countenance, that a shade of regret came on her fair young face. James saw it directly \u2014 he who knew each look so well. ' There is some reason perhaps ! ' he exclaimed eagerly. 'Just now you looked a little sorry. I know your expression so well. Tell me, is there anything I can do to keep your services ? ' She shook her head. ' Will you not take a little time for con sideration \u2014 at least, put off your final answer till to-morrow ? ' seeing an opportunity for another tete-a-tete, and speaking more eagerly than ever. ' It is no use. I have promised to give \u2014 ' then she stopped. She had not meant to say that James Romer had seen the girl wish Mackinnon good-bye as he came up Dean's Walk, and just as a flash of lightning has before now revealed to the benighted traveller the highwayman's figure, so at the girl's words he saw whom she had promised \u2014 saw who it was who had stolen her away from her Sunday duties, and robbed him of his treasure. She was engaged then, he supposed. His face grew very white, but his voice was steady. An that case,' he said, 'it is useless for me"], [262, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 222 to press you. I have no right to ask your motives. No doubt they are wise ones. You need not trouble about Sunday. I will find a substitute. Good-night' Then he turned and left her. ' And he never offered to shake hands with me,' reflected Ina, as she made her way upstairs to dress. ' He must be really offended this time.' Then she began to think about Mac kinnon, and forgot the Curate. Mackinnon who had gone to the Club, and who, as he studied the Money Markets while his dinner was pre paring, allowed the idea of answering his mother's letter to die slowly away. It would not be comfortable, to say the least of it, for him, if it were known in Carswell that his sisters were milliners' assistants. Would he not, if he wrote, be compelled to put his hand in his pocket and pay the insurance money, and so release Annie and Charlotte from their daily drudgery? He could not afford such payment, he told himself. If he meant to marry Ina it was his first duty to her that he should keep his income well together. No, it would be better that things should remain as they were, \u2014 that no answer should be sent to his Edin burgh home. He took the letter from his pocket and tore it up, throwing the pieces into the waste - paper basket. Then the waiter an-"], [263, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 223 nounced dinner, and he went into the dining room to eat it. The Cathedral clock struck eight as he sat down to table. And Ina! Ina at that same hour was seated at her father's table, trying to look as if she was listening to the jokes of Miss Eliza Bunbury, and to seem interested in Canon Anson's simple chit chat, while all the while her thoughts were with Mackinnon. She sat there in the soft candle-light, smiling at the talk, and returning civil answers to all that was said, but in reality hearing nothing. ' You are the one sweet and holy influence in my life.' The deep tones of Mackinnon's voice, and the light which had illuminated his face as he made his appeal that afternoon, came back to her mind. She be lieved in his love, and was beginning to think she returned it. It was very sweet \u2014 the fact that she alone had power to lead him back to better things. Surely, as this was the case, it was her duty to do her utmost for him ? The hard round of business had dealt cruelly with him. Poor fellow ! How glad she would be to lead him, as he said, back to faith in humanity and the Creator of humanity. Her life would not be lived in vain then. And it would be a happy one, too, since he loved her. If his lips had not actually told her so, still she knew it for all that. Poor Ina \u2014 so"], [264, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 224 sweet and pure, innocent and unselfish, how little she comprehended the man's true char acter \u2014 how she would have shrunk away from him in horror had she been able to look into his heart ! But she did not know him as he was ; and through the hours of the evening, and for many, even, of the still night, her thoughts were with a man wholly unworthy of her. ' She must be engaged \u2014 she must be engaged to him,' James Romer told himself over and over again, as he paced his bedroom thinking of Ina. The stars were shining faintly in the morning skies, when at length he lay down to rest. 'It is all for the best \u2014 all for the best,' he murmured, but even as he spoke the words, he knew that his heart contradicted what his lips spake. ' In a little time \u2014 in God's time \u2014 we shall understand.' Then he forgot his misery for a while in a heavy sleep. It was late when he woke."], [265, "CHAPTER IX. ' A gentler feeling crept Upon us ; surely rest is meet, \" They rest,\" we said, \" their sleep is sweet,\" And silence followed, and we wept. Our voices took a higher range, Once more we sang \" they do not die, Nor lose their mortal sympathy, Nor change to us although they change.' 'In Memoriam! The month of September was half over, and things were not well at Stackfield. Lord Ross mere had been harder hit than any one had fancied, and seemed quite changed. Mr Stillwell, the ' coach,' was yet at the house, and the young Earl read with him daily, but the tutor had told Lord Stackallan more than once that his son read 'without spirit.' He did just what was required of him, and no more. And then the moment the read ing was over, the boy would order round the dogcart, and start with his gun for some outlying cover, and from such expeditions he rarely returned till it was dark. He would not take a keeper with him, and he would not go P"], [266, "226 CATHEDRAL BELLS. with his father. There had been no shooting parties as yet, for Lady Stackallan complained of not seeling up to it, so they were postponed till October, and the great house remained quiet. During the first week of the partridges, one of the Marquis's colleagues in the Ministry came down, but even during the days that Lord Meltonbury went out, Rossmere declined to accompany his father and the guest. Even Lady Beatrice scarcely saw her brother. After dinner he would go off to his own room and sit there smoking far into the night, and on Sundays he disappeared altogether. Where he went no one knew. Certainly he did not go to Carswell, for he started off soon after breakfast in his shooting dress, but minus the gun and dog. During these long Sabbath hours the boy would walk miles, hardly noticing where he went, and holding imaginary conversations with Ina, in which sometimes she was made to beg him to return and be friends, while he went through the process of what is com monly known as 'cutting off your nose to spite your face,' by declining ever to speak to her again. But, as a rule, things termin ated in a happier way. Ina, after four or five years of mutual misery, was made to say she loved him ; and then they"], [267, "HE STAR1ED OFF SOON AFTER BREAKFAST IN HIS SHOOTING DRESS. Page 226."], [268, ""], [269, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 227 were happily united under the arches of the great Cathedral, with the bells pealing triumphantly overhead. ' Silly boy,' you say. Yes ; but what boy who was worth anything has not gone through this? 'The maiden passion for a maid ' is not a bad thing for a lad, depend upon it. At noon, on these occasions, Rossmere would sit down to rest, and break his fast with a few sandwiches, and copious draughts of sherry and water from his big flask. And then he would smoke a cigar or two, thinking still of Ina, and wishing that he had not been born a Marquis's son, until it was time to turn his face homeward. The only person he ever went to see during these days was James Romer. ' You must pull yourself together,' the Curate used to say, but Rossmere shook his head, and answered, \u2014 ' I can't.' ' Nonsense ! we none of us know what we can do till we try. Work harder than you are doing. There's nothing like work for putting this sort of thing out of a man's mind.' ' You love her, too \u2014 you know you do,' Rossmere said once, but the Curate answered nothing. He could not speak about his love \u25a0that great love which filled all his heart."], [270, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 228 Ina seemed to him too sacred to be talked about. His face looked so stern that Ross mere was half awed, and did not allude to the Curate's feelings for a long time after wards. ' You must come down and see my bargees again,' Romer said, one afternoon late in Sep tember, when the young Earl had driven his dogcart up to the clergyman's quiet rooms in Jessop Street, with a couple of brace of partridges for his friend lying on the seat beside him. 'What's the use?' Rossmere asked moodily. 'The use?' echoed the Curate. 'Why, to show that you are interested in them \u2014 to show that though you are born a great man's son, that still you don't consider yourself too fine to come among them. You are very young, and your boyish heart is sore just now. There are many men who would laugh at your trouble \u2014 don't think I do \u2014 I don't in the least ; but there are others who have greater troubles than your disappointment. Such things happen to men, and when they do, men must simply grin and bear them. It doesn't matter your coming here and talking to me, but you mustn't talk about Miss Strong to others. It isn't even a good thing to talk to me. Try and bear it all in silence. Come down with me to the"], [271, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 229 Canal and I will show you things which, if they don't quite make you forget your own feelings, will at least show you that there are others with troubles in the world. Come with me, and I will show you a poor mother who had, till but the other day, a child she loved. She was a widow, and it was all that was left to her, and now it is dead. The house she lived in was unhealthy, and the child died from blood-poisoning. Come and see her sitting at her work, now that all is gone from her. Will you ? And there is a man, too, who just a year ago married the girl of his choice. I read the burial service over her last Sunday afternoon. I can't ask you to come and see him, for he is like a madman ; but I can take you somewhere else \u2014 a poor woman \u2014 the mother of a large family \u2014 the sole means of their support \u2014 well, she is dying \u2014 dying of cancer. Sometimes she screams \u2014 I can hear her right down Wall Street \u2014 such screams ! These are the things to take a man out of himself ' I'll come soon' the boy answered, looking up. ' What a good fellow you are, Romer ! And tell the men at the Rooms I'll be down one day. And look here, give that to the poor woman with the cancer,' pushing a sovereign into the Curate's hand. ' It's a"], [272, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 230 dreadful disease, isn't it ? Oh, I thought so. Fancy any one belonging to oneself dying of it ! Good-night.' Then the boy went out, and drove away homeward to dinner. 'Wrhy don't you go and sit with your mother sometimes now, Ross ? ' Lord Stack allan said, resting his arm on his son's shoulder as they passed out of the dining-room that evening. Mr Stillwell had gone away for the night, and the pair were alone. They were stand ing at the foot of the grand stairs, and the remark had been called forth by the boy turning as though to go to his own room. ' With mother ! Why, she always likes to read in the evening.' 'We are not very bright, I know,' Lord Stackallan answered, 'but she complains she never sees you now. You are always alone. Come into the drawing - room this evening. I daresay, if you do, she will put aside her reading for once ; besides, she won't be here to-morrow. She wants me to take her to town for two or three days. Come.' But poor Rossmere forgot the lesson James Romer had been teaching that afternoon. He felt wretched, and was longing for a glimpse of Ina."], [273, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 231 ' I can't,' he said, and strode away to his own sitting-room. Lord and Lady Stackallan went to town the next day, and drove through the silent, hot, deserted streets to their own residence in Carlton Gardens. The house was all shut up except one or two rooms on the ground floor, and there was no one there but a couple of women servants. Lady Stackallan wanted her husband to go and get his dinner at ' Brooke si but the Marquis was no epicure, and preferred a plain meal in his wife's society to a first-class one without her at the Club. So the pair dined tete-a-tete, and afterwards went and sat in Lady Stackallan's little room at the back of the house, which was nearly all covered up with brown holland sheets. Carlton Gardens is always quiet, but that sultry autumn night, with all the West End houses closed, and the great world out of town, it was doubly so. The husband and wife sat on till long after their usual hour for retiring, talking of long-gone times, \u2014 of their wedding-day, and the birth of their children. And then they read a chapter from the Great Book, and afterwards went up stairs, hand in hand, like two young lovers instead of middle aged folk who had been married over thirty years. And once or twice in the dark hours"], [274, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 232 of the night Lady Stackallan put out her hand and touched her husband's arm. ' What is it, dear ? ' he asked, with a start. ' I only wanted to know that you were there. How still it is, isn't it ? ' And the next day Lady Stackallan told her husband she was out of sorts, and that she had an appointment at the great Quilter's, and asked him to go with her. So the pair went, and when the patient was shown into the Physician's room, Lord Stackallan sat in the dining-room and read an interesting treatise, on the physiology of the brain, and quite forgot the flight of time. There were one or two other people in the apartment, and there was a doctor's carriage waiting at the door. By and-by the hall door slammed and this carriage drove away, but Lord Stackallan went on read ing until the door opened, and a grey-headed man looked in and beckoned him away. 'Just come here for a minute,' he said, and led the way into a sort of little dressing-room. And there the great man told him that the wife he loved so well was dying fast of cancer. ' But you may be mistaken,' Lord Stack allan said, when at length he comprehended something of the calamity with which he was threatened. ' Tell me the names \u2014 send for some other doctors \u2014 now \u2014 here.'"], [275, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 233 ' I am not giving you my own opinion alone,' Dr Ouilter answered. ' Your wife's own doctor, Phipps, was here to meet her, and at her own wish he brought Sir William M'Bean. That was Phipps' carriage they went away in.' Phipps' carriage ! He had heard it go. He had not known then what it meant ! ' And you say the same \u2014 all of you ? ' ' Yes. There is no mistake.' They went out of the room after that, the Statesman and the Doctor, and the latter led the way to his consulting-room. Lady Stack allan was quite ready. She looked up at Dr Ouilter, and then peeped behind him at her husband, and smiled \u2014 such a smile ! \u2014 so full of loving tenderness and trust, sympathy and resignation. She pressed the Physician's hand, and then took her husband's arm. She had walked well enough when she had arrived there, but now she moved feebly, as do those who have seen a long span of life. Sentence of death had been pronounced, and it was hav ing its natural effect. ' Tell me all,' she had said to those great men. ' I have a husband and children. I must know \u2014 don't be afraid \u2014 besides, before you speak, I know.' And she had been right. As she had thought, so it was. They drove away from Saville Row \u2014 they twain who, thirty-five years before, had been"], [276, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 234 made one \u2014 drove away through silent deserted Bond Street, past the empty clubs, and back to Carlton Gardens. The house had been still before, but now it seemed more so. Through the mellow afternoon the husband hardly left his wife. She lay on the bed, and he sat beside her holding her hand. Once, about five o'clock, he went downstairs to answer a Government telegram, and passing through the carpetless hall, saw on one of the marble slabs, bottles from Savory & Moore's, and so seeing, his mind went back to those days when her children had been born, and he had been so anxious about her. He took the medicine up himself, and administered the dose, and was pleased with the effect. Then he wrote to his daughter Mary, saying that they would be home the next evening, and that her mother was not well. That was all. Time enough to tell them when they met, poor things \u2014 time enough. At six o'clock the next evening they were back at Stackfield, and Lady Stackallan went at once to her own room, and when her hus band had seen her comfortably resting, he went down to the library and tried to realise what had happened. The daylight was fading away, and over hill and dale the twilight deepened rapidly. It was a still, grey evening, not a leaf stirring,"], [277, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 235 and the old house was very quiet, while the owner sat motionless in his chair, gazing at the elms visible from the library windows. No, he had no right to complain. More than once he told himself so, and yet even in so doing he knew that his heart contradicted him, \u2014 knew that in its bitter, weary pain it com plained, and complained bitterly. And yet to him God had been good, \u2014 had dealt mercifully, since he had been prosperous above the lot of the children of men. His title had come to him impoverished, but he had lived carefully, and gradually the encumbrances had been paid off, and the name which had been sullied by the evil doings of his father, had come to be respected and honoured. Land which had been sold or mortgaged had been redeemed. His tenants were better housed than those of other men. Far as eye could reach was his own, was the future birthright of the boy for whose com ing he was now waiting feverishly, \u2014 his boy whose life had been so happy till the other day. This sorrow would blot out the other, the grey-headed statesman thought. Could it be true? Impossible! It could not. Life without his Lizzie ! how would that be ? He could not even fancy it. More than thirty-five years of wedded bliss. He bowed his head as he thought this, and gave"], [278, "236 CATHEDRAL BELLS. thanks to God for it, while the hot tears started to his eyes. It would not be long now ! The Doctor's words came back to him. What did the man mean ? He had forgotten to ask him. Was it weeks, or months, or days? Not that\u2014 not that last! A little while \u2014 a little respite \u2014 that was what he craved. How strange yesterday and to-day had seemed ! He had a difficulty in recall ing events. He remembered going back to Carlton Gardens after leaving Saville Row. Yes ; he remembered that, because she said once that the jolting of the carriage hurt her. And then the evening. He had dined alone, because she was tired ; and afterwards had gone out for a little, and walked along the Terrace, but still it was all confused in his brain. How late Ross was! Where could he be? Not in Carswell, poor boy ! Very likely out shooting, thinking over his little disappoint ment. Poor lad \u2014 poor lad ! He wished he would come in. Suppose he heard him in the hall and called out, would the boy understand by his voice? How long he was ! It was getting dark. Hush \u2014 yes, there was the stable clock striking seven. Perhaps he would go round by the drawing-room window, and knock to be let in. But no,"], [279, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 237 the others were out too. And he must tell them also ! He covered his face with his hands, and asked strength of God to bear the trial. And as he prayed, he heard the boy's step in the hall, and called him, \u2014 ' Ross. Lord Rossmere came slowly in, pulling his cap lower over his brow, as though anxious to conceal his face. He shook hands with his father, and then went over to the mantelpiece, when he was startled by Lord Stackallan's arm being put round his neck. He looked up quickly, and knew in a mo ment that something was wrong. ' What is it ? ' he asked hoarsely, his thoughts flying to Ina at once ; but then he remembered he had himself seen the girl driving with Mrs Maycott not two hours before, and was reassured. 'What is it?' he said, almost crossly this time ; and then, ' where is the mater?' in rather a frightened tone. ' She is in her room,' Lord Stackallan an swered. ' I'm glad you are the first in, Ross, because you must help me when Mary and Beatrice come. My boy, my heart is broken. I have seen the doctors in London \u2014 your mother is dying.' The lad gave a cry of horror."], [280, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 238 ' What \u2014 what is it ? ' he asked at length. ' Cancer, in its worst form,' was the brief answer. 'Will it be \u2014 will it be \u2014 ' the boy began when Lord Stackallan broke in \u2014 ' Will it be long, you mean ? No ; a few weeks at most, I think. They say the agony will be very great.' After that there was a silence in the library. Ross lay with his head against his father's arm, too crushed to speak. Lord Stackallan loved the boy as he loved all his children, but that night he felt that they were dearer to him than he had ever dreamed. He seemed to realise that they were part of her. The lad had taken his life from her. As he thought of this, he bent down and kissed his forehead. Then the door opened, and Lady Mary and her sister entered, and started at the sight of the pair. ' Tell them,' Lord Stackallan whispered, and Ross, looking up at the girls' wondering faces, did as he was told. At first they could not realise, could not comprehend it. They knelt upon the ground and clung to their father and brother, saying it could not be \u2014 could not \u2014 something might yet be done, but gradually, as Lord Stackallan let fall all he knew, hope died away within their breasts."], [281, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 239 The time crept by unnoticed. The dressing bell pealed forth, but it passed unheeded, and it was only when the dinner-gong sounded that Lady Mary seemed to realise that responsi bilities had fallen on her which two hours ago did not belong to her. She took her brother and sister into the dining-room and tried to induce them to eat, and with her own hands carried some refreshment to her father in the library, and stayed with him while he partook of it. Then he went upstairs to his wife's room, and sat there till she woke up from a heavy slumber. ' Do they know ? ' she asked anxiously. ' An hour ago and more,' he answered. ' Bring them to me, dear,' she said, with a smile ; and he went. 'You must be very quiet,' he said, pausing at the door. ' Promise,' he said, and then, as they promised, he opened it, and they went in. Lady Stackallan was sitting up among the pillows, with her beautiful complexion looking just as usual. They had always thought it a sign of health before, but they understood now. She looked up, and smiled. ' Dear children ! ' she said. ' Such helps and comforts to me.' Then the sight of her boy with his swollen eyelids seemed to make her"], [282, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 240 lip tremble, but she controlled herself. 'We mustn't forget the doctors,' she said, with her gentle little smile. ' Dreadfully strict people doctors. If we make a fuss we sha'n't be allowed to see each other, and that will never do. We must see a great deal of each other. Kiss me, my dears. Mary, you will take my place from to-day. I have done with work, and am going to have a holiday now. God bless you, dear children.' They got outside somehow, and along the corridor, and then into Lady Mary's little sitting-room, and there burst out into loud weeping. And Lady Stackallan ? Lady Stackallan, left alone with her husband, hid her face in his breast, and after a little grew still and more calm. ' Thy will be done,' he heard her say, and through the dark hours of the sleepless night, heard her say it again and again. She was a good woman. I have said so before. The days \u2014 the sad days of which I am writing \u2014 went slowly by. October came, and in time merged itself into chill November, and in the park at Stackfield the leaves were falling fast, while the branches of the giant elms swayed to and fro in the keen blasts."], [283, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 241 Winter had come early, folks said, and drew closer to their warm firesides. At Carswell, things seemed dull. Daily people asked each other for news of Lady Stackallan, and each day seemed to bring worse tidings. She was going fast, they said sadly, as they stood chatting in 'the High,' and they spoke of the good she had done, and of the loss she would be to the poor around. ' She was always their friend \u2014 always,' mild Canon Anson said, as he stood in the cloisters one bitter afternoon at this time, and then opening the door, went in and took his place in the choir. There was a nervous tremor in the good little man's voice when a few minutes later he rose to ask the prayers of the congregation for Elizabeth, Marchioness of Stackallan, who was lying at the point of death. The Misses Bunbury, as usual, formed part of the congregation, and many a curious face was turned towards them. They, among all the Carswellites, had known her well. It would be a great loss to them. Mrs Smallpiece turned her black, beady eyes full on the maiden ladies, and reflected, not without satis faction, that in a few hours they would no longer be on terms of intimacy with a Marchion ess whom she herself did not know. She felt quite glad about it, only she did not own Q"], [284, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 242 it, even in the privacy of her own heart. She thought of speaking to the pair as they came out of church, but Miss Eliza drew her veil over her face and hurried home. Her kind heart was full. Thirty-five years of loving friendship ! It was a long span. Neither of the sisters spoke as they paced along through the cold twilight to their little home in Crossgates. In the drawing-room a bright fire was blazing, and Ina was waiting for them. ' Oh, Miss Bunbury ! \u2014 Miss Eliza ! is it really true? Is it possible that Lady Stackallan is not expected to live through the night ? ' Miss Eliza uttered an exclamation. ' Is it as bad as that ? ' she asked. ' She was prayed for in the Cathedral \u2014 indeed they did say at the point of death. I suppose it is true \u2014 I suppose it is so,' shaking her grey head sadly. Ina could hardly speak. Her sweet face, always a little pale, looked paler than usual, and her pretty slim hands shook so she could hardly pour out the tea. Miss Eliza saw it, and took the duty from her. ' I should like to have written him a little note,' the girl said, for the maiden ladies of course knew all the truth about Rossmere's de votion to her \u2014 ' but I thought it better not. I think I will write to him by-and-by \u2014 that is,"], [285, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 243 if it should be so,' not liking to allude more directly to the dreaded event. ' She was so kind \u2014 so very kind to me that day, and she seemed so wrapped up in him. What will he do ? ' and the sweet eyes grew moist in their compassion. He had been very dear to her, this boy. Sometimes she even thought it was just as well he did not come to see her. It is not very difficult to become attached to any one who is perfectly devoted to oneself. ' She was always kind,' Miss Eliza said, look ing at the fire, and wiping away the tears that rolled down her cheeks, ' always kind. Dear me ! how well I remember that first afternoon we ever saw her, when she came to the Palace, a young bride, to return our visit. Our own dear mother was dying then, and I recollect how full of sympathy she was, and through it all, what she was to me ! God bless her.' Then the door opened, and Canon Anson was announced. At any other time, Ina would have been inclined to smile at the arrival of Miss Eliza's supposed admirer, but that evening, mirth was far away from them. They shook hands in silence. ' I shouldn't have come in,' the Canon said, for I knew full well what a loss it must be to you, but I thought you would like to know"], [286, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 244 that I went round to the Palace after service and saw the Bishop. He was dreadfully upset. He was there at two o'clock this afternoon, and gave her Communion. She was quite conscious, having refused all opiates for several hours, because she wanted to have her senses about her at the solemn time. Wonderful courage ! They were all with her \u2014 her husband and children, some of the old servants, and Romer. ' Mr Romer ! ' echoed the three listeners. ' Yes. He was sent for first several days ago, and since then he has been constantly there. I hear they all like him greatly, and that the Bishop is much pleased with him.' ' I am glad,' Ina said softly. ' I can quite imagine he would be a great help in time of trouble,' with a little glance at Miss Eliza, who disliked anything Low Church; but the poor lady was too down-hearted that night to be roused to battle for any theological prejudice, however dear. They sat round the fire while the wind moaned round the house and along the deserted thoroughfares of Crossgates, and though they spoke of this thing and that, their thoughts were still with her who was even then on the brink of Jordan's flood. In that death chamber stillness reigned. A great life was passing away. She had been"], [287, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 245 born a Duke's daughter, by marriage she was a Marchioness, her husband was a Statesman and a Knight of the Garter, and a power in the land ; but it was none of these things which had made her great. To her they had been as nothing, or next to nothing. Her life was great because it had been hid in Christ. The Bible that lay just then upon the bed had been an ever open volume. As she believed He had taught, so she had striven to live. And this life was bringing its own reward. Her husband and children were dear to her beyond compare. In the dark nights since the terrible sentence had been pro nounced, she had wept bitter tears at the thought that she must pass from them, but now \u2014 now that was at an end. The desire to remain had left her. She was going, and she was content to go. ' My dears,' she said, looking up at the weep ing faces bending over her. ' Oh, my dears ! ' She closed her eyes again after this and lay quiet. Her right hand rested in that of her husband, while her three children clung to the other. ' Presently she opened ' them again and looked hurriedly round. ' Is Ross there ? ' she asked. For answer, the boy bent down to kiss her. ' Poor boy,' she said, and then whispered"], [288, "246 CATHEDRAL BELLS. something in his ear. The others did not know that it was her love she was sending to Ina. 1 If your dear father had not wished otherwise about Daisy, I should have been well content. A sweet face \u2014 a fair face ! Kiss me again, my dear ; ' and then, after a pause, ' My love to Eliza and Mary Bunbury.' ' Would you like to see them ? ' her eldest daughter asked. The dying Peeress smiled. ' Oh, no, my dear,' she said, ' I have done with earth now.' For a long time afterwards she lay still. The clock outside the door ticked away noisily, and that, with the occasional heavy gusts which swept round the building, were the only sounds which broke the hush of the death chamber. The lamps burned softly. It was very quiet \u2014 very peaceful. They could hardly believe it when the end came, it was so easy. There was just a little sigh \u2014 a sudden and very beauti ful smile, as though some sight fairer than aught she had beheld on earth smote on her eyes, and that was all ! Dong ! Through the howling, wintry wind came the sound of the great Cathedral bell telling the inhabitants of Carswell, in the darkness of"], [289, ""], [290, "INA, SITTING BY THE FIRE IN THE RECTORY DRAWING-ROOM. Page 247"], [291, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 247 the winter's evening, that Elizabeth, Marchion ess of Stackallan, had passed away, and at the sound Ina, sitting by the fire in the Rectory drawing-room, burst out crying, while in the little house in Crossgates Mary and Eliza Bunbury wiped away the tears which rolled slowly down their withered cheeks. The grey November days crept by. Away at Stackfield the flag on the great tower was flying at half-mast, while in Carswell, at intervals, the great Cathedral bell boomed forth its solemn tone. At street corners people paused to speak of her. She had been a good woman, they said, and I, who knew her, answer, ' None better.' It came at last, that day that was to see the earth close over her whose face and figure had for so long a time been familiar to the inhabitants of Carswell. There was no show, no state. It was of funerals the very simplest. In front of the plain coffin walked the Steward, carrying on a black velvet cushion a coronet. Except for this one mark of rank, it might have been the funeral of the humblest depend ant on the estate. The procession passed in to Waring Church where, Sunday after Sunday, she had bowed her knees and worshipped God with all her strength. And then they went out to where"], [292, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 248 in a corner of the green churchyard a plain earth grave was ready, and there they laid her down, while in the still November air rose the voices of the mourners, in her favourite hymn : \u2014 ' Brief life is here our portion, Brief sorrow, short-lived care. The life that knows no ending, The tearless life is there.' And as they sang, it seemed to her husband and children as though for the space of a little while the gates were rolled back, and they could see in where she had gone. ' Yes, I will see him,' Lord Rossmere said late in the afternoon of that same sad day, in answer to an inquiry by one of the footmen as to whether he would wish to receive Mr Romer. The boy was sitting alone in the twilight in his own room. Lady Beatrice was lying on her bed weep ing, and attended by the faithful old nurse of the family, while Lady Mary was still with her father, with whom, indeed, she had re mained ever since the return from Waring churchyard. ' I hope they gave my message right,' the Curate said, holding the young lord's hand in a tight grasp. ' I said that they were to tell you that you were not to think of seeing"], [293, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 249 me unless you really wished it. I thought perhaps, though, that you would wish it. I'm glad of that. Oh, of course, I know what it is. I have been through it so lately \u2014 that is why I came.' ' It hurts \u2014 it hurts,' sobbed the poor boy. He was barely twenty, and all his nerves were unstrung by what he had undergone. ' I know it hurts,' James answered. ' I know it ; but in a little while the worst will pass away. ' And then you must think of her happiness. Think of the good, useful life she spent. All round, the people speak of what a friend the poor have lost. She worked so hard for them, thinking and writing about their affairs, and giving all she could in charity. You mustn't think of her as dead. A Chris tian never dies. She has only gone home before you, \u2014 gone to her holiday rest. That is how you must look at it' ' I'll try,' the boy answered, very sadly. ' Just now I feel better \u2014 now that you have come. It was so dreadful all alone. I seemed to remember things I didn't want to \u2014 I mean about \u2014 about to-day. Ah, you know what I mean,' as a great light of sympathy shone on the countenance of that most lean Curate. Somehow he did not look so lean as usual that day. All his nervousness appeared to"], [294, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 250 have deserted him too. He seemed to throw quite a protecting air over him, the lad thought, as Romer moved the cushions and settled him in a more comfortable position. ' I'll try,' the young lord repeated again, ' but it is very difficult. You are sure I shall see her again, are you not ? ' ' I know that you will see her again,' James answered earnestly. ' Thank you.' In the room a hushed silence reigned for a while. The tired youth lay quietly on the sofa while the Curate sat beside him. More than once Rossmere put out his hand and touched his friend. It was better now that he was no longer alone. He could forget, for a little, those heavy shuffling feet, \u2014 -could forget how every now and then the wintry wind had lifted the heavy pall and showed the plain oak coffin \u2014 the coffin in which she was. How impossible it seemed ! To go into her room, and she would not be there, \u2014 into the conservatory, where it would matter nothing to her whether this flower bloomed or not. The flowers of earth were nothing to her now. And to think, too, that whatever befell him \u2014 her boy \u2014 would affect her not at all. All the past years of his life, whether things were well or ill with him, had made all the difference to her. Why, she had even"], [295, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 251 cared about the cricket matches at Eton, and had known the name of every boy in his house. It was all over now. Never, never again would she care. His self-command gave way at the thought, and he sobbed out the piteous idea into his friend's ear. Mr Romer gave quite a start. ' Surely you don't think that \u2014 surely not ? Love does not end with this life. I am sure my dear old mother looks down at me, and cares about my work and happiness just as much as ever she did on earth. Sometimes I even fancy she aids me in it. And why not ? While she was with me she never sat idle. I do not think any of us will sit with folded hands hereafter. We shall have work to do, depend upon it ; the only difference will be that there it will be a pleasure, \u2014 that we shall no longer labour in the sweat of our brow.' ' I like that thought,' Ross answered. ' I shall love to think she still cares about my little affairs. She did so, too, up to the last moment of her life,' thinking, as he spoke, of her message to Ina, ' so, as you say, why should she change now?' ' Why, indeed, since the Gospel tells us that even Dives in torment still retained his love for his brethren.

Often and often when some little bit of pleasure turns up, or some little unlooked-for piece of success occurs in my work, I feel rather inclined to fancy dear old mother has had some sort of a hand in it, just as on earth she loved to give me a little sur prise. I can see her now, in her arm-chair, and a quiet twinkle in her eyes, waiting till I found it out. Very often it was only a little thing \u2014 just perhaps a brown loaf for tea, which she had brought because she knew I liked it. And if it was a real thing \u2014 a really great thing \u2014 something about my work, oh, what pleasure it gave her ! But there, I must not talk like this. It is very selfish of me. I know not how I came to wander from your sorrow to my own. It was giving that illustration about that little piece of pleasure, I suppose.' ' Fancy your calling yourself selfish,' Rossmere said, glancing up at the Curate, with some thing very like a smile of amusement on his face. The idea was so wonderfully, startlingly im probable, that it was impossible not to seem a little comic. ' So I am,' the Curate answered, in perfect good faith. ' We all are a little, I suppose,' with a sigh of regret, ' but sometimes I get quite frightened about myself. It is the sort"], [297, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 253 of thing which creeps over a man if he gives way to it the least bit in the world.' I do not think you need be afraid,' Ross mere answered, with another smile. ' The men down by the Canal at the Reading Rooms looked so much as if they thought it, didn't they ? How are things going on ? I promised to go again, but then \u2014 then this came. I don't seem to have done anything since they came back from London \u2014 the day my father broke it to us.' ' Of course not \u2014 of course not. How could you ? And she liked to have you near her. On those afternoons when I had the honour of reading to her, she talked a great deal about you. I told her how I had carried you off to see my bargees. She was much pleased, \u2014 said she would like you to interest yourself in those sort of things, and how, if she had been well enough to do it, she would like to have driven down and inspected the place.' ' I will come next week,' Rossmere said, but Mr Romer objected. ' No, not just at present \u2014 at least, not till I have had time to ask Dr Fraser what he thinks. There have been one or two cases of that typhoid down there lately. I believe you are not likely to get it by just visiting a case \u2014 not as you can smallpox or scarlet fever, but"], [298, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 254 still, it is better to be on the safe side. The drains and water, I am sure, are all wrong. I wanted the landlord to take it in hand, but he would not. I spoke to him most earnestly.' 'Who is he?' the boy asked. Almost all the land round, and more than one half of the houses in the town of Carswell, belonged to his father, so that the question was a natural one for him to put. ' Mr Mackinnon, the Banker,' James answered. Young Lord Rossmere gave a start, and his heart seemed to sink within him. The name brought back so much to his mind. He had hated the man, and had been jealous of him \u2014 nay, his jealousy was as keen now as on the day when he had been banished from Ina's society. He forgot the attempt he had been making to interest himself in the discussion, \u2014 forgot even that which had wrung his boyish heart, \u2014 forgot everything save one fair, pale face, a pair of blue-grey eyes, and a mass of curly brown hair. ' I hate him ! ' the boy said, below his breath. 'I hate him! \u2014 I wish that he was dead!' The Curate laid his hand on the speaker's arm. ' Hush,' he said. ' You must not talk like that. I \u2014 I \u2014 I do not greatly like him myself \u25a0that is, I should not wish that any one I cared"], [299, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 255 for should belong to him, \u2014 should be in his power, I mean,' getting very red. Somehow, Rossmere guessed at once what was passing in the Curate's mind. ' Nor should I,' he said, almost below -his breath ; and then, ' You \u2014 you do not think Ina \u2014 Miss Strong that is \u2014 will marry him ? ' ' I am not sure. I \u2014 I do not know,' James answered. ' I \u2014 I think perhaps that it will be so.' The Curate spoke each word distinctly, paus ing once or twice till he was quite certain he could command his voice. When he had finished he put out his hand and took the young Earl's in his. ' There is no need to speak of it,' he said. ' I will let you know if \u2014 if it should come to pass \u2014 if there is an engagement. But, my boy, you should put the idea from you. Your family wish that you should wed, I believe, with one of your own rank, when you are older. You should put this thought from you. I know that it is hard and difficult.' For a minute there was a silence, and then the boy looked up and said, \u2014 ' Might I not say the same to you ? \u2014 I mean that you, too, should put the thought from you.' The Curate started."], [300, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 256 ' Yes \u2014 yes,' he answered, ' you might indeed. I intend to do even as I advise you. I mean to try and begin again better to-morrow,' with a smile lighting up his face. The conversation ceased for a while after the last words. It was a curious thing that though each was acquainted with the other's love for Ina, yet neither of the pair were jealous. Partly this may have been from the sincere liking which existed between the Earl and the humble Curate, but more probably it arose from the simple fact that each re garded the other as harmless. To Romer, Rossmere was little more than a schoolboy ; while to the latter, the fact that his friend was absolutely without a penny in the world, seemed to him, the heir to fifty thousand a year, a barrier which was absolutely insurmountable. There was also another tie between them, namely, the belief each entertained that his own position regarding Ina was hopeless. Mackinnon, to use a sporting phrase, was the only favourite. ' And he would not help them \u2014 the tenants ? ' Rossmere asked, after a pause. 'No.' ' But you can compel him \u2014 at least, I think so,' the boy replied. ' I will ask my father, as soon as he is able to attend to any-"], [301, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 257 thing ; or I tell you who could tell you at once, and that is Malcolm.' 'But I do not know Mr Malcolm\u2014 at least, only by sight.' ' Never mind ; I will give you a note to him.' Lord Rossmere rose from the sofa on which he had been lying, and walked across the room to his writing-table. For a moment he had forgotten his sorrow, but the sight of the russia - leather cases filled with broad black edged notepaper brought it back to him. He gave a deep sigh, and abandoning his pur pose of writing a letter, simply wrote across a sheet of paper, \u2014 ' Please give my friend Mr Romer all the in- formation you can. ROSSMERE.' ' It is very kind of you \u2014 very kind indeed,' the Curate said, as he put the envelope into his pocket. ' Something ought to be done before the winter damps set in. It is too late to call on Mr Malcolm to-night, but I will walk over and see him in the morning. If the cottages were in the town there would have been a stir long ago ; but down there by the Canal, it is so far off \u2014 nobody cares about the poor things. I must go and see how they are getting on. I should have gone this afternoon, only I wanted to see you. I knew what you R"], [302, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 258 were feeling. And I have been a little help? Oh, I am glad of that. It makes it so pleasant when one lies down at night to feel one has been of service. And if I start off now I can be of use down at the Canal. It is half-past five. I shall be there in three-quarters of an hour.' Lord Rossmere rang the bell and ordered tea for his friend, and insisted on his returning in the brougham. ' But indeed I would much rather walk,' pleaded the poor Curate, as he stood with his friend under the grey portico. ' Nonsense ! It's blowing and raining hard. And thank you for coming. Yes, indeed you have done me good.' Then the carriage drove off, and the young Earl, turning, re-entered the great still hall, while the footman closed and barred the doors."], [303, "CHAPTER X. ' Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend, More hideous when thou showest thee in a child, Than the sea monster.' \u2014 King Lear. December came, and at Stackfield a great quiet seemed to reign always. Lord Rossmere's departure for the University had been postponed the moment the nature of his mother's malady was known, and now it seemed probable that the idea of his taking a degree would have to be given up. The young Earl was past twenty. The old member for the County was getting more and more feeble. He would endeavour, he said, to hold the seat till Lord Stackallan's son should be of age, but that was all he could do. Nine months at Oxford was not likely to be of much service, it was thought, and so the matter was allowed to drop. Perhaps on the whole it was just as well, for Lord Rossmere was certainly not in a fit state to undertake a course of severe study. Truth to tell, the deplorable shock of his mother's illness and death coming at a time"], [304, "260 CATHEDRAL BELLS. when he was suffering from his bitter disap pointment about Ina, had had a serious effect on the lad's nervous system. He started when spoken to. The nights were almost sleepless. He would not go out with his gun, or do anything. Instead, he sat in his own room, over the fire, a book open on his knees, but at which he rarely glanced. Now and then he would rise and walk impatiently to the window, and look at the drive along which they had walked on that never-to-be-forgotten day when they had laid his mother to rest in Waring Churchyard. Sometimes, too, his eyes would wander to where in the distance rose the great spire of Carswell, beneath the shade of which Ina dwelt. Those had been happy hours he had spent at her side, the poor boy thought sadly. He could not forgot her, \u2014 was, indeed, always thinking of her. If she had but cared for him \u2014 if ! Rossmere had not seen Ina since his mother's death, now more than six weeks ago. A few days after all was over he had received a pretty little note of sympathy from the girl, and he had answered it at once, telling her how his mother sent her love to her just before the end. Hot, bitter tears had fallen on the paper as he had written, and the sight of the soiled sheet had caused Ina's eyes to fill."], [305, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 261 She wanted to write to her boy-lover again, but felt that perhaps she had better refrain. She could not, however, let such a communi cation pass without notice, so she wrote a letter to her friend Lady Beatrice, enclosing a little note to her brother, just saying, \u2014 ' Your dear mother's message touched me deeply. I shall never forget it or her. INA.' Through the winter days that followed, Rossmere kept this and the girl's previous note beside him, reading them over and over again, long after he knew them by heart, and now and then kissing them passionately. 'Very silly,' you say, O unsentimental reader ! Perhaps. I do not know. One of the Kings leys has made some rather strong remarks in favour of this sort of thing ; and I, who know something of young men's careers, am inclined to think there is much wisdom in his words. It is true that a lad may occasionally waste his time in foolish dreaming, but that is all \u2014 the love for a pure, sweet maid has a wonderfully restraining influence on a young man's life. ' How do you find him to-day ? ' Lady Beatrice Scott asked, meeting the Rev. James Romer one cold afternoon as he was cross ing the hall on his way out after a somewhat lengthy visit to the young Earl."], [306, "262 CATHEDRAL BELLS. ' Very low \u2014 very low indeed,' the Curate answered. ' He doesn't seem to get on at all. I think he is more difficult to rouse than at first. That is the worst of not being compelled to work. Even in telling him a little piece of news about myself I could see it was an effort to him to express his pleasure, though I am sure he meant all he said \u2014 I didn't mean that he did not,' stammering in his old nervous way, ' only it was difficult, as I say, for him to express his feelings. The only time when he seemed at all roused was when I told him I was going away. He did not like that.' 'Going away!' exclaimed Lady Beatrice. 'Oh, I don't mean permanently. So stupid of me to express myself so badly. I am going \u2014 obliged to go \u2014 to Edinburgh, for a fortnight. I have been left quite a little fortune \u2014 at least to me it is \u2014 a thousand pounds ! ' ' I am glad.' The girl's face showed that she meant what she said. ' Thank you \u2014 oh, thank you very much.' ' Stay, Mr Romer ! ' Lady Beatrice exclaimed. I have just thought of something. Why shouldn't Ross go with you ? We have been trying for weeks to get him to take a change. True, Scotland is cold, but it will brace him up.'"], [307, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 263 The Curate smiled. ' My dear young lady,' he said, ' nothing would give me greater pleasure than to have your brother with me, but you forget that his means and mine are very different. I shall go by the third class in a slow train, and put up at a fourth-rate hotel. That would hardly suit Lord Rossmere's position, would it?' Lady Beatrice was silent for a minute ; pre sently she said, \u2014 'Would you mind waiting a few moments? I will not keep you.' ' Certainly,' the Curate answered. Lady Beatrice's minute was a rather long one \u2014 ladies' minutes, I notice, generally are. Mr Romer stood before the great, burning logs for fully a quarter of an hour before the sound of a quiet footstep made him look up. It was Lady Mary, appearing taller and thinner than ever in her deep mourning. ' Will you come and see my father ? ' she said, when she had shaken hands. ' He par ticularly wishes you to do so. I fancy he has some savour to ask you.' James gave a little smile. The idea seemed to strike him as comic, \u2014 that it could possibly lie in his power to oblige a Marquis with fifty thousand pounds a year ! Lord Stackallan was standing at his writing-"], [308, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 264 table in the warm, cosy library when the Curate was shown in. It was the first time the latter had seen him since the funeral. When the pair had shaken hands, the nobleman toyed nervously with the great heaps of papers on the table before him. Presently he cleared his throat, and began saying that he had heard through his youngest daughter of Mr Romer's little stroke of good fortune, \u2014 that he was anxious that his son should go somewhere quite away, for a short time, and that if the Curate would undertake the office of guardian, so to speak, he should wish him to go up to Scotland with him. If Mr Romer could arrange with his Rector for three weeks' holiday, so much the better. That would bring it up to within a few days of Christmas, which would be a good time for coming back. Lord Stackallan gave a deep sigh as he spoke of the festive season of the year. By-and-by he went on, \u2014 ' My daughter told me of what you men tioned as to your mode of travelling, Mr Romer. Of course, if you go as a companion to my son, the expenses of the journey are mine. That is only right and fair ; besides, the obligation is still on our side. What do you say? Are you willing to oblige me?'"], [309, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 265 'My lord, I shall be only too glad. It is most kind \u2014 most flattering \u2014 I \u2014 ' ' Tut, tut,' Lord Stackallan answered, with a sad smile. The Curate's nervous manner brought back to him one day when the little man had been reading to Lady Stackallan, and the end was not far off. After he had left she had praised him ; and then, with a sparkle of her old fun, had taken him off to the very life. He could see her lying there among the pillows, and the smile on her dear face. She had been bright and cheery to the very end \u2014 his Lizzie ! And so it was settled before the Curate left the house that he and Lord Rossmere were to start for Edinburgh the next day. ' If you get through your business sooner than you expect, take him wherever you like. And I don't want him to be bothered about the money or anything on this trip. Will you kindly take that off his shoulders ? Thank you. Then I will give you this \u2014 if it is not enough, write for more.' Lord Stackallan, as he spoke, put a cheque for one hundred pounds into the Curate's hand. A hundred pounds ! and to last but for three weeks ! Why, he had only ninety on which to keep himself all the year round ! Poor Mr"], [310, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 266 Romer felt bewildered as he put the order on the Carswell Banking Association into his breast pocket, and hurried off towards the grey old city to make his arrangements with the Rector for three weeks' leave instead of a fort night. And yet, before he had gone a dozen yards, he forgot the hundred pounds and every thing else \u2014 his own legacy included. He was going to the Rectory. Perhaps he should see Ina ! \u2014 Ina, whom he had not set eyes on for six weeks and more ! The wind howled as James Romer journeyed along the muddy lanes which lay between Stackfield and the sombre Cathedral town, but he hardly noticed the storm. It was past five when he found himself at the door of the house, opposite the ivy-covered wall. His heart beat quickly as he pulled the bell. 'Yes,' the maid believed the Rector was in, and as the Curate was following the domestic across the hall he heard a gay young voice singing. The owner of the voice was coming down stairs, coming down in an exquisite blue tea-gown, while the lamplight fell softly on the pale fair face and curly masses of brown hair. She was singing ' Annie Laurie,' and did not see the clergyman until she was quite close to him ; then she gave a start. 'Mr Romer!' she said. 'Why, you are a"], [311, "INA'S HOUSE, CARSWELL. Page 266."], [312, ""], [313, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 267 stranger. Come in and have some tea. It is in the drawing-room all ready.' James took the little hand he knew so well. It was six weeks since he had seen her, and all that time, though he had avoided the girl as he would the plague, he had never been free from the one great longing which haunted him day and night \u2014 to look upon the face he loved so dearly. He held her hand for a minute in a strong grip, while his eyes rested on the fair face, with its expression of mingled sweetness and decision. Then he let the hand fall. She was nothing to him. She was going to belong to the man he loathed. ' I haven't congratulated you yet, Mr Romer, on your good fortune,' Ina went on. ' Papa was telling us of it at dinner last night \u2014 perhaps he ought not ? Perhaps it was a secret ? ' ' No, oh, no ! \u2014 that is \u2014 why, of course, I haven't mentioned it to any one, or hardly any one yet. I don't know why I should mind, though. I am starting for Scotland to-morrow to see the solicitors about it. I am taking a friend of yours, too, with me \u2014 at least, I mean, I go as a sort of companion to him \u2014 Lord Rossmere.' ' Lord Rossmere ! ' echoed Ina, a little warm"], [314, "268 CATHEDRAL BELLS. flush of pleasure coming on her face as she spoke. 'Tell me how he is? Poor boy \u2014 poor dear boy.' ' He is in a low, nervous state, and Lord Stackallan wants him to have a complete change. I am to be a sort of private tutor, companion, and nurse all in one for the next three weeks, his father says. I think it will do him good. He seemed more roused, Lady Beatrice said, when she told him of the plan.' 'Dear boy!' Ina replied. 'Give him my love ! I suppose I oughtn't to send it, but I shall, all the same. Sometimes it's nice to do what one ought not. Don't you think so? Oh, no ; I know you don't ! You are a tire some person who always does just what is correct. But why should we stand out here in this cold hall ? Come in and have some tea !' ' I \u2014 I must go to the Rector. I have to see if he can spare me for three weeks. I had better not keep him waiting any longer. He may think it rude ; besides, he is sure to want to get away to the Reading Rooms. I know he likes to look in about the time of the even ing papers. Good-night' Poor James Romer ! He knew it was im prudent to see the girl who cared nothing for him, who, he felt, had given her heart away to"], [315, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 269 that handsome Banker. For six weeks he had avoided her, and was even then holding out his hand to take leave of her after exchanging half a dozen sentences, and yet in his own heart he knew that he was longing madly that she should invite him to come across to the drawing - room as soon as his interview with the Rector should be over. 'Good-night!' echoed Ina. 'Nonsense! you must come in and see mamma. Tell papa he is not to keep you. If you are more than five minutes I shall take the cosy off the teapot, and let it get cold,' laughing merrily as she made her way to the drawing-room, while James \u2014 poor, foolish, idiotic James \u2014 entered the study. Mr Strong gave his Curate the three weeks' leave, congratulated him again on his little legacy, and then expressed his pleasure at Lord Stackallan's confidence in selecting him to go with Lord Rossmere. After that the Rector hurried off to read the Globe, and James walked across to the drawing-room. Mrs Strong was in the dining-room arranging flowers, so after she had bidden her visitor welcome, she went back to her occupation, leaving Ina to entertain him. The girl gave him his tea, and when that was over, went and sang quaint old Scotch songs for him. His mother had been the daughter"], [316, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 270 of a Scotch farmer, and had often sang them to him in a cracked voice on a winter's evening, and he liked to hear them again, at least he liked that Ina should sing them to him, though I doubt if he could have borne to hear them rendered by any one else. He sat by the fire, with a great lump in his throat, and twisted his fingers nervously together as he sought to subdue the emotion which the familiar words of 'Annie Laurie' occasioned him. By-and-by she grew tired, and came and sat by the fire, chatting Carswell gossip, with a little amused smile on her face at the stupidity and frivolity of some of the people. And James? \u2014 James told himself that it was wrong of him to laugh as he did over Mrs Smallpiece's impudent curiosity ; at Archdeacon Maycott's sharp sayings concerning poor Canon Anson's firm belief in his own delicate health ; at Dr Fraser's quarrel with the Dean because the latter had an inclination for what was High Church, and the Physician treated the things which belong to that school with a certain amount of contempt. ' What the deuce can it matter whether a man wears a long coat or a short one,' he had roared across the luncheon-table that very day. ' Do you think he'll go to heaven any sooner because he's got on half a yard more cloth than"], [317, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 271 his predecessor? You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Mr Dean.' Ina, who had been present at the party which had taken place at Mr Festings', the Banker, took the Doctor's manner off to perfection. James, who knew the Physician well, and had, besides, all his sympathies with the Low Church party, leant back in his chair and roared again. He had not laughed so much, he said, for months. So he sat on in the pretty drawing room, with the lamp burning brightly, while he warmed his feet at the blazing fire, and watched the light dance on the animated face, crowned with the masses of curly brown hair. It was seven o'clock when he rose to go. She had been even sweeter and kinder than he ever remembered before, and she let her hand linger in his when he was bidding good-bye. ' Oh, Mr Romer,' she said, looking up at him, ' I have got something to tell you,' with an amused light dancing in her eyes. 'Something to tell me!' James' heart sank within him as he echoed the words. It was coming then \u2014 that which he had dreaded so long. She was going to tell him she was engaged. He let the white hand fall, and put up his own to his mouth. In the lamplight Ina did not notice that the colour had fled from his face, leaving it an ashen grey."], [318, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 272 ' Yes,' he said at last ; ' yes ; what is it ? ' ' Oh, I am not going to tell you now,' still looking up, and laughing. ' I'm shy about it. I'll tell you when you come back. Ah, here is mamma ' \u2014 as Mrs Strong entered the room ; ' Mother, you are just in time to wish Mr Romer good-bye.' How he got out of the house James hardly knew. It was better when the door had closed behind him, and he was out in the keen wintry air, with the stars shining brightly overhead amidst dense masses of white clouds, scudding along at a great pace. He went on down the narrow path, and out on to the broad drive in front of the Dean's gates, which were situated a little way from the archway leading into the Palace grounds. It was better out there in the cold air than in the house. ' Something to tell you. I am shy about it. I will tell you when you come back,' James repeated the words to himself. The sound of the sweet voice was still in his ears. He could see her standing before the fire with her face upturned to his, \u2014 could see the slender, graceful figure in the long blue robe. Good heavens ! how he loved her. And she was going to tell him that she was about to become the wife of another man. What was he to do? He must conquer this madness \u2014 this blind folly. Had"], [319, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 273 he not long ago resolved to give the girl up \u2014 long ago when he had seen the rich Banker's attentions to her? And for a time he had done it \u2014 for a time ! Why even till that very night he had succeeded fairly well. Now he had been weak. When she had asked him to go in and have tea he ought to have refused the invitation sternly. That was what he must do in the future. Good God ! why, in a few weeks she might be this other man's wife ! This was no question of prudence or imprudence. In the near future it would be one of simple right or grievous wrong. He saw the precipice now. There must be no dallying with the matter. He must put Ina's image from him with all his might, \u2014 must fight night and day till he had conquered his folly. When she was married he would go away from Carswell \u2014 would resign at once. Now that he had fifty pounds a year of his own he could do as he liked about that. He looked back at the Rectory. Lights were gleaming in the upper windows, where the inmates were preparing for dinner. He took off his hat and stood still for a minute. I think he was praying to God to bless and guard his treasure. Then he went on down the Close and out into busy Smith Street. The gas lights were burning in the shops. People were going about here, there, and S"], [320, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 274 everywhere. Now and then some passer-by laughed, and James heard it and went on homeward with the dull aching pain in his heart. Do you laugh, unsentimental Reader? Perhaps. He had loved this girl ever since he had first seen her. He had expended all the wealth of his affection on her \u2014 he had none to give any other woman. If she could not be his bride, then, though work and duty still remained, all the gladness would have passed out of his life. Sometimes it is like that with men. Many forget quickly, but with others it is different \u2014 they remember always. Do you understand ? The next day was a busy one for James Romer. He rose early after a sleepless night, packed his things, and then went down to the Carswell Banking Association. It was a minute or two past ten when he got there \u2014 the doors were only just open, and there was no other customer present. The Curate presented Lord Stackallan's cheque for a hundred pounds, and took the change, mostly in ten pound notes. Mr Prior, the manager, was walking up and down the bank. He had nodded a good morning to the Curate when the latter came in, but when he saw the large quantity of gold and notes being made ready for him, some-"], [321, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 275 thing seemed to strike him. He stopped, and then turning, stepped quickly up to the paying cashier, and looked to see the signature on the cheque which Mr Romer had presented. He lifted his eyebrows when he saw whose it was. Then he leaned across the counter and ad dressed the Curate. ' I wish you would step into my private room,' he said. 'You are just the man I want, though I did not think of it till I saw you.' It was Mr Romer's turn to look surprised as he followed Mr Prior into the glass room. The manager shut the door carefully. ' I hope I am not detaining you from any thing important,' he said. 'You are not in a great hurry, I daresay? Just sit down.' The Curate took the chair indicated, before he answered, \u2014 ' As a matter of fact, I am in a bit of a hurry. The truth is that I have to go to Scotland to-night on business for a few weeks \u2014 three at the most \u2014 and Lord Stackallan has asked me to act as a sort of tutor-companion to young Lord Rossmere during the time I am up there. We leave by the one o'clock fast train.' ' Going away, eh ? ' said Mr Prior. ' I wonder your Rector can spare such a hard working man as you. By the way, I'm told"], [322, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 276 he is not up to much any longer, \u2014 very low and nervous.' 'Who is?' James asked. ' Why, Mr Strong, to be sure. You ought to know.' The Curate laughed. He was a big, solemn man was the Rector, not given to emotion, and to hear him talked of as nervous amused the little man. ' I haven't found it out then,' he said. ' I was with him last evening, and he did not strike me in the least as being low, much less nervous.' ' Really ? ' Really ? ' echoed James. ' Why, what do you mean ? I see him, I suppose, oftener than any other man in Carswell does, and if there was anything the matter with him, I should be the first to find it out' ' Hem ! You did not think it necessary, did you, at any time, to make inquiries as to Mr Strong's mode of managing his income, \u2014 \u25a0 how much he had, and all that sort of thing ? ' ' I ! ' exclaimed James. ' Good heavens, no ! What are you talking about ? ' ' All right. Don't excite yourself,' Mr Prior answered. ' I see it wasn't you. If you are not in a great hurry, I will tell you why I put the question.'"], [323, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 277 Mr Romer was in a great hurry, but he was too much interested in the affair to say so, so he merely settled himself in his chair, and prepared to listen. ' Well,' Mr Prior said, ' I live over the Bank here, as I daresay you know, but beyond break fasting in my rooms, I get all I want at the Club. Once or twice lately I noticed a clerk of ours had not left the Bank when I went to my dinner at seven o'clock, but I didn't think anything of it. However, last night, hav ing a bit of a cold, and there not being the usual number for a rubber of whist, I came home early \u2014 very early \u2014 just after nine o'clock. Well, as I let myself in, I noticed a light in the Bank, and looking in through the glass of the door, what was my surprise to find the young fellow still here, and working away very industriously. I opened the door and walked in. He jumped up, got very red and confused when I asked him what he was doing at that hour of the night, and finally I walked over to see for myself what he was about. Well, I found him surrounded with Mr Strong's bank books for all the years he has been in the town, with old cheques and all sorts of things, and a credit and debit sheet in front of him, in which he appeared to be working out, as far as I could see, Mr Strong's income. Well, I turned on"], [324, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 278 him, and asked what all this sort of hanky panky work meant, when he burst into tears and said he didn't mean any harm. Presently he went on to say that a gentleman \u2014 whose name he wouldn't mention, but who was a great friend of Mr Strong's \u2014 had told him the Rector was in a low, nervous state, fancied he was ruined, and I know not what else. This friend, he said, did not like to trouble the family until he was more certain of the state of affairs, and therefore had asked him to find out Mr Strong's exact income, and also whether he had any private means.' Mr Prior ceased, and Romer gave a start. Like lightning there flashed across his mind the remembrance of a conversation which had passed between himself and Mr Mackinnon under the limes in front of the Cathedral one August morning. He had seen then that the Banker was trying to 'pump' him as to Mr Strong's means, and he had guessed that his reason was that he wished to know if there was any private income before committing him self with Ina. He felt convinced that the clerk had been actuated by Mackinnon to make these researches, but he had nothing to prove it, so held his tongue. ' Well, Mr Romer,' asked Prior, after a pause, ' what do you think, eh ? I see you have got"], [325, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 279 something in your mind. Tell me what it is.' ' I think \u2014 I know \u2014 at least, that is, I think I can guess who the person was who made these inquiries. I think I know his reason for doing so too. I had a question put to me also, by the man I suspect, only a few months ago, concern ing Mr Strong's income, and the sources from which it was derived.' ' The deuce you did ! ' whistled Mr Prior. ' And what answer did you give him, pray?' ' I told him that I hadn't the slightest idea, \u2014 that I hadn't the slightest wish to know.' ' And you say you comprehend his motive for making this inquiry ? ' ' I believe I do.' ' Come, Mr Romer, out with it. Who is the fellow ? ' ' That I certainly cannot tell you. I have not the slightest proof to go upon. Can't you see that for yourself? As to his question to me, it might have been caused by mere idle curiosity. I say it might. Mind you, I don't believe for a moment that it was. I believe 1 know as well as possible the reason which prompted the individual to make these inquiries, but my belief is worthless, inasmuch as belief is not proof ' Hem ! Well, but in confidence to me.'"], [326, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 280 James Romer shook his head. ' No,' he said. ' I will not, even to you. The only person I should deem myself at all justified in mentioning my suspicions to, is the Rector himself 'Well, well, perhaps you are right. Shall you see Mr Strong before you go north ? ' ' No ; he went by the early train to Pegmouth for the day. I shall be off long before he returns.' ' You won't object to my mentioning what you have told me ? ' ' N\u2014 no.' James rather hesitated. Very likely if Mac kinnon's name did come out Ina would think that it was simply jealousy on his part that had caused him to mention it, and the Banker would probably have some good excuse to offer for his inquiries. Still, James felt that he must risk that. It might be that even yet he might be the means of preventing her from throwing herself away on such a selfish, worthless man.' ' No,' he said again ; ' but I beg you to inform the Rector that I have no proof, and that the questions put to me last August might have been prompted by mere curiosity. Who was the clerk, if I may ask, who has been tampered with ? ' ' Young Prentice. Do you know him ? ' ' By sight. He lives in my parish, but never"], [327, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 281 attends Saint Mary's. He goes to Saint Dunstan's, \u2014 sings in the choir, I believe.' I know. Pye's church, you mean. I see Pye walking about in a sort of black dressing gown. I wonder he doesn't have a cord round his waist \u2014 will soon, I daresay,' the Manager answered, and then, after a few more words, they parted. It was nearly eleven when the Curate got away from the Bank, and he had one or two things to buy in the town. Now that he was going off in company with a young nobleman, it behoved him to dress a little above his usual average. He invested in some new ties, collars, and a couple of pair of gloves. James and Lord Rossmere started from the Carswell Station by the one o'clock quick train. It seemed very strange to the poor Curate to find himself taking first-class tickets, ordering hot-water tins, and requesting the guard, at his companion's wish, to keep a carriage for them. At three o'clock they steamed into London, which they found enveloped in a thick yellow fog. The train by which they were to leave town was timed to depart from Euston at 8'5<o p.m., so they had plenty of time at their disposal. They drove to Carlton Gardens and deposited their luggage, and then went to several shops. At seven they returned, and"], [328, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 282 dined in the large, carpetless dining-room, half covered up with brown holland. It was the first time Rossmere had been there since his mother's death, and the place was almost too much for him. Both were glad to get away, and to find themselves steaming north in the swift-flying carriage of the Scotch mail. The first few days at Edinburgh were almost completely taken up with business for Mr Romer, so that Rossmere had to amuse him self as best he could. 'Is it announced yet?' he asked his friend abruptly one night, when the latter returned late from the Solicitor's office. He did not mention Ina's name, but the Curate understood, and answered as quickly as he could, \u2014 ' Not yet \u2014 I think it will be soon, Then the hands of the man and boy met in a warm clasp of sympathy. Poor Lord Rossmere found it rather dull wandering through the streets of Edinburgh by himself, so that, when one morning his friend informed him that after that afternoon he would not be required again at the lawyer's office, he was glad to think that he should have some one to talk to, and go about with. He could get through that day alone, but"], [329, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 283 somehow he felt as if he could not manage another. Romer and he beguiled the hours of the morning by a second visit to Holyrood Palace, and then came back to an early lunch at the hotel, after which James went away to the Solicitor's, and Rossmere sat smoking cigar ettes in the deserted smoking-room, and idly glancing through the papers. About five he had a cup of tea, and then, putting on his coat, went for a walk, in spite of its having been dark for the last hour. He determined to see as much of the town as he could, since Romer had agreed, now that business was finished, to go on the next day to Inverness, and it would probably be some little time before he again found himself in Edinburgh. Dinner was ordered for eight o'clock, so that Lord Rossmere had no need to hurry. The young Earl had been out a long time and had walked several miles, and was just be ginning to congratulate himself on the fact that he now thoroughly understood the geo graphy of the Scotch capital, when on taking out his watch he was surprised to find that it wanted but a quarter of an hour to the time when the evening meal was ordered at the hotel. He had no idea it was so late. He was quite twenty minutes' walk from the Royal \u2014 in fact, he was not very far from where James'"], [330, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 284 solicitors lived, and for a moment it did occur to him to go round and ask if his friend was still there, but thinking that the Curate must have left long since, he gave up the idea, and set off hotelwards at a rapid rate. The street in which Lord Rossmere found himself was dark and badly lighted. He had just noticed this, when he perceived that a girl, whom he had passed a few minutes before, and who had been running then, was now walk- ing close behind him. He checked his pace a little to let her go by, when he noticed that she at once checked her own. A little startled, he went on at his former pace, and observed directly that she regulated her own so as to keep close to him. Seriously annoyed, he was wondering what to do, when he became aware of the figure of a man who appeared to be watching them, and who was walking along on the other side of the street, a little in advance of them. It was too dark to see what he was like, but as far as Rossmere could make out he appeared to be a man no longer young. Every now and then the individual paused, and looked round to see if they were coming. Feeling perfectly certain there was something wrong, and wondering whether the two were in collusion to rob him, or whether the girl was really trying to protect herself from the un-"], [331, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 285 known, the boy determined, in the latter case, to see the thing out. The street was a side one, and very quiet. He stopped suddenly, and drew back a little, and let the girl pass him. Looking at her in the dim light of a solitary gas lamp, he could see her start and stop ; and then, as though not knowing what to do, go slowly on. Before she had gone many paces she turned and looked back, just as Rossmere went slowly up the steps leading to one of the houses. There was a porch to it, and the moment he had entered it he could not be seen. He peeped cautiously between the pillars, and saw the girl come to a dead stop. Evidently she had not expected this, and believed he had entered the building. At the same moment he saw the man on the other side turn round and run across the road, and seize the girl's hands. Directly afterwards there was a scream, and then he heard the man say, ' Shut up, you little idiot ! ' Rossmere waited another second, and saw that the girl was endeavouring to get away, and that the man was preventing her from passing. In another moment he was down the steps and along side the pair, just as the girl screamed ' Help ! ' again. ' What is it ? ' exclaimed Rossmere, as he saw the man drop the girl's arm, and run. ' Let"], [332, "286 CATHEDRAL BELLS. me catch the fellow,' he said ; but his companion seized him, and detained him. ' No, no,' she panted. ' He frightened me \u2014 don't leave me, he might come back. This is the second time this has happened. It was some while ago \u2014 six months and more, and for a time I could not walk home from business alone, but I thought it was quite safe, and that he had gone away, until we met to-night. That was why I was trying to keep close to you. He tried to catch hold of my arm at the corner of the street, but ran across the road when you came by. Oh, don't leave me ! ' The girl's teeth were chattering in her head, and she clung close to her companion's arm. ' All right, I won't leave you,' Rossmere answered kindly. ' No, you needn't be afraid ; I promise to stay. And you see there is no fear of his coming back. Why, the instant I came up, off he cut.' Yes, I know ; still, I am so frightened.' How far off do you live ? ' Not far \u2014 in Silver Street' ' Silver Street ! ' echoed Rossmere. ' I know where that is, \u2014 it's where M'Caw & Turing are.' M'Caw & Turing were Romer's solicitors. ' Yes. Their offices are just opposite to where my mother lives.' ' Do you think you can walk there ? If I could"], [333, "'DON'T LEAVE MF, HE MIGHT COME BACK.' Page 286."], [334, ""], [335, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 287 leave you anywhere, I would go and get you a cab, but I don't see how I could do that' ' Oh, no, please do not leave me. I can walk quite easily.' The girl moved a few steps, just to try her strength. She found it was not worth much. ' I think perhaps you had better take my arm,' Rossmere said. The pair went slowly up the street, and had just turned to the right, when hurried footsteps approaching them made the girl start. Directly afterwards, a figure in a black coat and white tie hurried by. It was James Romer, returning from the solicitors' to his hotel. He stopped in amazement as the gaslight of a public house revealed his charge. ' Hullo ! ' exclaimed the boy. ' Fancy meet ing you ! I thought you'd have been at the hotel an hour ago ! I am just taking this young lady to her mother's house in Silver Street. She has been frightened by some silly scoundrel who ran after her. Luckily I saw what was up, and the fellow made off. I wish you had been there : I would have given him chase \u2014 as it was, I was unable to leave her.' ' I see,' Romer answered. ' How shameful ! Did he try to rob you ? I hope you are not afraid now? I assure you there is nothing more to fear. I will come back with you also. Now"], [336, "288 CATHEDRAL BELLS. you have quite a powerful escort,' laughing a little as he spoke, and noticing how much the poor girl trembled. The trio made their way along a couple more streets, and presently stopped before a com fortable-looking dwelling in Silver Street. ' This is the house,' the girl said. ' Please come in. My mother will wish to thank you.' She opened the door, and led the way into a plain but comfortably - furnished room on the ground floor, where a bright fire was burn ing, and a table spread for tea. A lady, no longer young, was sitting in an arm-chair sew ing. She looked up with a smile on her face as her daughter entered, but rose with a start when she saw the girl was not alone. At the same moment she perceived there was some thing wrong. ' My dear Annie,' she said, speaking with a slight Scotch accent, ' my dear child, what is it?' ' I have been frightened, and these gentlemen have been very kind ; ' the girl answered, and then she burst out crying. ' Nay, I must disclaim,' Romer broke in. ' It was my friend here, Madam, who was fortunate enough to come up in time to rescue your daughter from this pickpocket, or whatever he was. I had nothing to do with it. I only"], [337, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 289 met my friend a street or two from this, and came back with him and your daughter.' 'I cannot thank you enough!' the lady ex claimed, turning to Rossmere. ' Annie, my dear, you are better now, I see. Tell me about it ! Gentlemen, pray sit down.' The lady, as she spoke, motioned them to a couple of chairs, and then seated herself on the sofa beside her daughter, who was now drying her eyes, and trying to smile. She was a rather pretty girl, with crimpy hair and dark eyes, and, somehow, both the faces of mother and daughter seemed familiar to James Romer. Where had he seen them before ? ' It was the same man, mamma \u2014 you remember \u2014 last summer ? and we thought he had gone away. I shall never dare come home alone again.' ' No ; you must not,' the elder lady an swered. ' Even if I have to pay some re spectable person to fetch you of an evening. Indeed, I think I had better send Jane to night to bring your sister back.' 'There is no need, mamma. Mrs Maguire is there, and they are coming home together at ten o'clock.' ' Mrs Maguire is a host in herself, so I think I may set my mind at ease about her. I am not able to go out myself into the night air,' she went on, turning to the Curate and Lord T"], [338, "29o CATHEDRAL BELLS. Rossmere. ' The doctors forbid it. At one time I used to go and fetch them both home from business every evening, but for the last two winters I have not been allowed out after dusk.' ' Is it far, Madam, to where your daughters are engaged ? ' Romer asked. ' A good step. They are at Wilson's, the great milliner's in Princes Street. I daresay you may have noticed the shop \u2014 a very large one on the right-hand side. Yes, that is it. They have been there a long time now \u2014 seven years,' with rather a sad smile. ' Seven years ! ' Rossmere exclaimed. ' At a milliner's!' he went on in dismay, and then came to a dead stop as he noticed a flush come on the girl's decidedly pretty face. ' It must be \u2014 must be such hard work \u2014 that is what I mean,' he stammered. ' Yes,' the elder lady answered. ' They are long hours \u2014 eight till eight \u2014 and often it is much later, when they are busy. My eldest daughter is in the mantle-making department. and as there is some special order which must be attended to at once, she will not be home till ten o'clock. You would not think, to look at her,' pointing to where her daughter was sitting, ' that she has been engaged in business seven years. I often tell her she does not look eighteen, even now.'"], [339, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 291 Rossmere did not answer for a moment. He was so surprised, and he could not quite make it out. They seemed ladies \u2014 in fact, it was im possible to hear them speak and to doubt it \u2014 and yet the girls were milliners' assistants \u2014 just that. He was sorry, \u2014 a little disappointed. He would have preferred rescuing some one who was not engaged behind a counter all day. Perhaps, with a woman's quick perception, the elder lady per ceived this, for she turned to the boy, and said, \u2014 ' Yet I do not think that, upon the whole, it has disagreed with them, though it is cer tainly not a position to which they were brought up. My husband was a physician in this town, and just when things seemed getting a little brighter, and prosperous ways appeared opening to us, he died suddenly. I did the best I could, but \u2014 but as things went, it was necessary in the end that they should work. The one who should have aided us \u2014 the one to whom I had a right to look \u2014 failed me in the hour of trial. By the unfortunate wording of a will my money dies with me, so as I wished to leave my girls with a comfortable provision, it was necessary to insure my life rather heavily, and as I could not afford to pay the annual amount, these girls work for it and pay it themselves. They will have their reward by-and-by. When I am gone, they will have no further need to work."], [340, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 292 ' Dear mamma, please don't ! ' exclaimed her daughter. ' My Annie is soft-hearted, you see,' the lady answered, with a pleasant smile. 'My dear, I daresay you have many years of labour behind the counter in Princes Street in store for you yet, so that you need not distress yourself. Listen ! \u2014 surely it is your sister ! Charlotte ? \u2014 so it is ! My dear, we thought you were not coming till ten o'clock.' ' The people who ordered the things do not leave now till the week after next, so any time in the next few days will do.' The new-comer, as she spoke, looked curi ously at the two strangers, and at her sister's tear-stained face. 'These gentlemen have been very kind,' the elder lady said, introducing them to her daughter as well as she could without knowing their names. ' My dear, that horrible man who frightened your sister so much before, has turned up again. Fortunately this brave young gentleman arrived at the right moment, and the wretch fled. Then his friend met them, and together they escorted her home. Why, Charlotte, how wet your coat is.' 'Yes, it began to rain just as I got here. Listen ! there it is, coming down in floods.' ' I hear it. Gentlemen I hardly know"], [341, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 293 whether you will deem me impertinent, but you must wait. May I hope that you will share our homely meal ? That is all there is, you see \u2014 cold meat and tea, or ale, if you prefer it. Let me at least show you some little return for your goodness?' James Romer did not quite know what to do. Had he been alone, he would have ac cepted at once, but about his companion he was uncertain. He did not quite know whether Lord Stackallan would like his son to accept the hospitality and companionship of milliners' assistants. Rossmere, however, guessed what his friend was thinking of, and fearing that their would-be entertainer might fancy if her offer was declined that the refusal was dictated by pride, determined to let the hotel dinner go by the board, and answered,\u2014 ' I for one shall be very pleased. It's twenty minutes to nine now ; they must have given us up at the hotel by this ; and oh, I am so hungry ! I don't think I have been so hungry since I arrived in Edinburgh.' Romer, hearing his friend accept, of course did the same, and the party quickly gathered round the table. Some bottled beer was brought in for the young men, and I do not think either of them much regretted the dinner in the dull room of their hotel."], [342, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 294 After the simple meal was over \u2014 which was not for some time \u2014 the party drew round the fire, and began to talk. Somehow or other the conversation turned back on the event of the evening, and Romer inquired whether the matter would not be placed in the hands of the police. ' Surely it ought to be,' he urged. ' I suppose it ought,' their hostess answered, gazing, as she spoke, with a thoughtful air at the blazing fire ; ' and yet one hesitates. Three women alone \u2014 a police court ! \u2014 such an un pleasant proceeding ! If there was any gentle man belonging to us ; not but what we have many kind friends, but it is different not being relations. Still, our solicitor, Mr Read, or my husband's successor, Dr Omerod, would, of course, go with us.' ' I really strongly advise you to see your lawyer about it. A young lady should not be subjected to such a thing; the second time, too, you say ? ' 'Yes, it happened just six months ago. Two or three of the girls in the shop met with the same annoyance. The man is of middle age, and from what I can gather, is undoubtedly deranged. I do not think he is the least danger ous, still, such a thing should not be permitted.' ' I did not know he was off his head,' Ross mere remarked."], [343, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 295 ' We think he is,' the girl who had been frightened answered. ' From the description Kate Steele gave of the man who spoke to her, I am certain he is the person who came up to me last summer, and again to-night. He did just the same to her, caught hold of her wrist, and asked would she not like to marry a prince ? I don't quite know what he said to me, \u2014 I was too frightened to listen, \u2014 I only know there was something about Prince Charlie in it.' 'Oh, the fellow is mad!' exclaimed Rossmere, ' Mad as a hatter ! ' ' Certainly it sounds like it,' Romer remarked. ' Still, mad or sane, it is a thing which ought to be put a stop to, and I would strongly advise you, Madam, to call on your Solicitor to-morrow morning. I suppose there are often similar cases in a big town like this \u2014 a man cannot, of course, be easily traced. Now, in our little town of Carswell a fellow would be tracked at once.' ' Carswell ! ' exclaimed the mother and daughters together, ' Carswell ! ' ' Yes ; do you know it ? ' the Curate asked surprised. There was a silence for a minute, and then the elder lady answered quietly, \u2014 ' My son \u2014 my only son lives there.' 'Indeed! May I ask his name?' with a little smile, and settling his white tie."], [344, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 296 ' Mackinnon \u2014 Gregory Mackinnon.' ' Mackinnon the Banker ! ' exclaimed Romer and the young Earl together. ' Yes.' ' Good heavens ! ' exclaimed Rossmere, and then for a minute there was a dead silence. Presently Mrs Mackinnon spoke again in the same quiet voice. ' I daresay you are surprised to find his sisters, who you can see are delicate girls, working for their daily bread behind a counter. And yet my son had a handsome fortune left him, and with it he purchased his share in the Bank at Carswell nine years ago. And from the day he left home I have never received one farthing's assistance from him, even when I pleaded that he should pay the annual amount of my insurance, so that there should be an income for his sisters when I am gone. It is to pay this that the girls work at the shop.' ' What a villain ! exclaimed Rossmere, his face growing scarlet with honest indignation. ' What a mean, selfish wretch ! I always did hate him, but now I hate him more \u2014 Oh, I beg your pardon ! I ought not to have said that.' ' Gregory Mackinnon is not so great a favourite in his own home that you need mind the slip you have just made, sir,' the elder girl remarked. ' For myself, I am willing and ready to work"], [345, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 297 as long as I can. It's not for myself I say that I am indignant, but for my mother and Annie, yonder.' 'Ah, well, maybe he'll turn over a new leaf some time and be good to us,' Mrs Mackinnon said. ' My words just slipped out this evening. Perhaps I should not have spoken so harshly of my own son, and to strangers, too, but at times I feel sorely on the subject, and especi ally to-night, when, if it wasn't for his cruel selfishness, my poor girls would not have to be about the streets of Edinburgh after dusk.' The party sat on round the fire for a little while longer after that, but the conversation was difficult, and as soon as the clock struck ten the young men rose to take their leave. ' And now you have never told me your name,' Mrs Mackinnon said, as she gave the young lord a hearty shake of the hand. ' Rossmere,' the boy answered. ' Well, Mr Rossmere, I thank you much for your kindness and bravery. We shall not easily forget it' Then Mrs Mackinnon turned to Mr Romer, and the young fellow made his escape into the hall. ' I will call in the morning,' the Curate said, ' and see you after you have returned from your lawyer's. Of course, if he advises your follow ing the matter up, we shall both be required as witnesses.'"], [346, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 298 Then he said ' Good-night,' and joined his companion in the street. The rain had stopped, and the stars were shining overhead as they walked back to their hotel. ' I shall go back to Carswell \u2014 I shall go and tell her \u2014 tell her everything \u2014 about this \u2014 and about the cottages where the fever is. I shall let her know his true character,' Rossmere said, speaking of the Carswell Banker. Then they entered their hotel, and the porter handed them their letters. The Curate took his and looked at it. It was from the Rector, saying, \u2014 ' My dear Romer, \u2014 What is this about my accounts at the bank ? Prior tells me you know the individual who is so much interested in my private affairs, and the why and where fore thereof! Is this so? Not that I care so much about it as Prior does, but still it is a nuisance and an impertinence. \u2014 Yours, ' Philip Strong.' Then an exclamation from his companion startled him. He looked up at Rossmere. ' It is from my sister,' the latter said. ' She writes, \" We heard in Carswell to-day that Ina Strong is engaged to Mr Mackinnon the Banker. Perhaps it is not true, but people think it is.\" ' ' Then we are too late to do any good,' the"], [347, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 299 Curate answered. ' Let us pray that she may be happy.' He spoke quietly, only his faced showed what the news was to him, ' I shall do more than that,' the boy answered. ' I shall do as I said, and tell her all we have learned about him.' James Romer was silent. Somehow it seemed disgraceful to attack a rival, but still, her happi ness \u2014 her lasting happiness, must be the first consideration. It was late before he went to bed, and when he did so his slumber was broken. The next morning Mr Romer saw Mrs Mac kinnon, who informed him that her lawyer had advised her to just let him speak to the In spector of Police privately, and to do nothing publicly unless they were obliged. So James left his address, and that of his companion, in case they were wanted, and departed, leaving the good lady much disturbed and astonished at finding young ' Mr Rossmere ' turned into an Earl. The Curate went back to his hotel after that, and packed his portmanteau. The Inver ness trip had been given up. Both wished to be in Carswell as soon as possible. After dinner the same evening they left Edinburgh, travelling south through a blinding snow-storm."], [348, "CHAPTER XI. ' Enough !

I did not sleep. One cannot in a train \u2014 at least I cannot To-morrow I shall be better \u2014 much better.' ' Hem ! ' said the Rector, and poked the fire.

My only ground for supposing that I know who it was consists of the simple fact that similar inquiries were addressed to me last August.' ' Well, who made them, man ? ' I would rather not say.' ' I daresay \u2014 no doubt ; still, I think you owe it to me to tell me.' 'Something \u2014 something has happened which makes it difficult for me to do so. And then, too, it may have been idle curiosity, and the second inquiries may not have been made by the same person.' ' That is possible, but not probable,' the Rector answered, stroking his huge grey beard thought fully. ' Come, Romer, suspicion or not, I have a right to ask you to help me in the matter. \u25a0It's not a pleasant thing to reflect that all one's accounts have been in some one else's hands. I repeat, you are morally bound to help me.' ' If you put it like that, I suppose I must,' the Curate answered. ' I fear, after what we heard in Edinburgh, that I shall give you pain. It was \u2014 it was Mackinnon.'"], [350, "CATHEDRaAL bells. 302 ' Mackinnon ! Hem ! Yes. I suppose you mean you heard he was engaged to Ina ? ' Romer nodded. He could not speak. ' Well, he is not then,' the Rector answered. ' He pro posed to her a few days ago \u2014 on Tuesday last, after lunching here. When it came to the point she couldn't quite make up her mind, and asked for a week to consider of it, which he rather reluctantly consented to. I don't know that she is best pleased with him, for I hear that he has given out that she has accepted him \u2014 several folks came and congratulated her, and she didn't like it. Women are funny cattle. They don't like a man who takes too much for granted. I think I can guess Mackinnon's reason for these inquiries. Well, I'll go down now to the Bank and see Prior. I wish I could say to you, \" Go home and rest,\" but I cannot. If you had not turned up like this to-day, I should have had to telegraph to you to come back. There is trouble down by the Canal. Typhoid fever is hard at work in those cottages by Piffin's Wharf. I remember your mentioning before you went' that you didn't like the look of it. It passed out of my head then, but directly you had gone the epidemic seemed to increase.

My wife has been my right hand \u2014 almost living down there, and the cook is at it all day, making beef tea and jelly. I wish you'd go off there now, and I will join you after my interview with Prior.' So James went off down the narrow path where the snow was falling fast. He did not feel tired then. There was a ray of hope in his heart. Perhaps \u2014 perhaps it would not be after all. And as that thought came to him he turned suddenly round and went back through the grey cloisters and into the quiet deserted Cathedral. And there for a few minutes he covered his face with his hands. I think he was praying that Ina might marry any one rather than Mackinnon. Then he rose, and hurried off to the Canal, where he spent the busiest morning he had ever spent in Carswell. ' Yes, I have found out who made the in quiries, at least I believe I have,' Mr Strong said, as he sat in the glass room with Mr Prior. ' No, I would rather not tell you who it was, unless I am obliged. Look here. Call young Prentice in if you like, and get him to tell the whole truth. Then we shall know for certain.' Mr Prior touched a little bell, and one of the clerks appeared."], [352, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 304 ' Send Prentice here,' he said, and in another minute the youth presented himself. He looked white and wretched. ' Prentice,' said Mr Prior, ' you remember that we have never yet cleared up the question relating to your exploits with this gentleman's accounts. The time has now come when it must be settled. If I had not meant to have got at the bottom of it sooner or later, I should have dismissed you the day you told me of the affair, when I found you here at nine o'clock at night. Now, you are very young to business life, and I am unwilling to spoil your chance on the very threshold of your career. If you will at once disclose who urged you to these investigations, \u2014 in fact, tell me all about it, \u2014 I will allow the matter to drop, though I can tell you I shall always keep a sharp eye over you for the future. That is only natural, after such a misdemeanour on your part. I cannot be expected to put the same trust in you that I do in the other clerks. Come now, speak out. I warn you that it is your best chance.' 'Yes, sir, please, sir,' stammered Prentice. ' Indeed, sir, I should never have done it, only the gentleman represented himself as the friend of Mr Strong, and said he was so anxious about him.'"], [353, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 305 ' Yes, yes. Well, never mind your reasons. Who was it ?' ' Please, sir, Mr Mackinnon from the Bank opposite.' ' I thought as much,' the Rector said, Mr Prior whistled softly. ' Now, Prentice,' he said after a bit, ' tell me, what did you tell him, and how much did he give you ? ' ' Please, sir, I told him I hadn't been able to find out much ; and that I was too new to banking ; and that I hadn't charge of the banking books ; and he said I was to keep my eyes open, and let him know. I have only seen him once since, and then I told him I could give no information, but last week I saw a cheque for two hundred pounds, payable to self, signed by Mr Strong, and then I met Mr Mackinnon and told him (I didn't think under the circumstances it was wrong) that I had reason to believe Mr Strong had large private means \u2014 that was what he wanted most particu larly to know.' 'And what did he give you?' ' H \u2014 h \u2014 half a sovereign ! ' exclaimed the youth, bursting into tears. ' Bah ! ' said Mr Prior. ' He might have done a little more. Well, it serves you right, so don't go on like a great baby.' u"], [354, "306 CATHEDRAL BELLS. ' May I ask when the last transaction took place ? I mean, about your informing Mr Mac kinnon of my drawing a cheque for two hundred pounds?' the Rector inquired. He did not speak unkindly. ' Last Tuesday, sir.' ' Tuesday ! What time ? ' About half-past twelve, sir. It was when I went to get my dinner.' Mr Strong smiled grimly. ' He came to luncheon at my house on that day \u2014 about an hour afterwards. I think I know the reasons which have led him to make these inquiries. Well, I never liked the man. Mr Prior, I hope you will forgive this youth. He is very young, and I am sure will try to do better for the future.' Indeed, indeed I will, sir. ' Well, Prentice, take yourself off,' Mr Prior said, after a few moments of deep thought. ' Mind, I shall keep my eye on you, and if I ever hear or see anything to make me suspect that you are talking to outsiders about this Bank and its customers, out you go, neck and crop, and that without a character too. And keep your tongue between your teeth about this business. Do you hear? Good. And now, be off.' ' This is a disagreeable affair,' the Rector said,"], [355, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 307 as soon as he and the Manager were left alone. ' Most disagreeable,' the other answered. ' Of course, I shall have to let him know that this has come to my knowledge.' ' Of course.' 'And then he will understand that you know it also.' 'Exactly,' returned Mr Prior, laughing. 'And consequently he will hate me a little more than he did before, if that is possible. I suppose, Mr Strong, there is no truth in a rumour which has been going about these last few days, in which Mr Mackinnon's name has been mentioned in conjunction with that of a member of your family ? ' ' He proposed to my daughter on Tuesday, after he had received the news of the two hundred pounds cheque. She did not accept him, but asked him to wait till to-morrow for her answer. I think, after what I have learned here that I need have little doubt of what that answer will be.' It was nearly luncheon time when the Rector returned home. He opened the door with his latch-key, stamped the snow from off his boots> and then, instead of entering his study, opened the drawing-room door and walked in. Some one in deep mourning, wearing spurs and holding"], [356, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 308 a riding-whip, was standing with his back to him, while Ina was sitting by the fire. The girl had evidently been crying, for her lashes were still wet. She looked up at her father with a sad little smile, and the stranger turning round, the Rector beheld Lord Rossmere. The pair shook hands in silence. ' I had better tell papa,' Ina said, in a quiet voice. ' Lord Rossmere heard a report that I was engaged to Mr Mackinnon. He has thought it his duty to come here and tell me some things about him which he has learned in Edin burgh, where his family live. They \u2014 they do not redound to his credit.' The Rector sighed. ' I, too, have heard similar things this morn ing,' he said. ' I find Mackinnon was the gentleman who was kind enough to interest himself so much in my private affairs. It appears he had already tried the game last August of finding out how much I am worth, from poor Romer, who, by the way, saw what he was up to. I daresay, Ina, you can guess the reason which prompted him to make these inquiries ? Some days ago I had occasion to draw a cheque of considerable value, pay able to self, \u2014 in fact, to do it, I had to over draw my account.

That, Ina, was on Tuesday morning.' The girl said nothing, only a little flash of indignation shot from her usually soft grey eyes.' ' Perhaps you will send and tell him to come and see me this afternoon ? Say I am ready- to give him his answer to-day instead of to- morrow.' The Rector nodded, and after a few minutes went out of the room, leaving Lord Rossmere and Ina alone. ' You \u2014 you won't accept him now ? ' the boy asked, after a pause. ' Accept him ! ' Ina echoed in dismay. ' After what I have learned from you, and after find ing out that he wanted to know if I had money before he proposed to me ? ' ' No ; of course you would not,' Rossmere answered ; and then, in a whisper, ' I am so glad \u2014 at least, that is if \u2014 if you are not very unhappy. Are you, Ina ? ' The girl shook her head. ' I am disappointed,' she said. ' I did not think he was like that. How could I guess? Do not look sad about me. I am not broken hearted. I had almost made up my mind to accept him ; but still, perhaps, when it came"], [358, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 310 to the point, I should not have done so. When I have been with him he has fascinated me, and I think perhaps if he had been worth it, and I had married him, I should have grown to love him. I thought that he had lost faith in all that is best, and I believed he loved me, and that if I married him I should lead him back to better things. He used to tell me this would be so, \u2014 that I was the one being who could give him back what he had lost. Now I understand that he did not really love me, and that the qualities which I believed he possessed were utterly wanting in him. No ; the only feeling I have left for him is one of contempt.' ' Fancy your thinking of marrying a man without loving him.' ' I thought that would come,' the girl an swered. 'And then I thought a mission to bring him back to ' all he had lost a grand thing.' ' I don't think you would have accepted him,' Rossmere answered, ' not in the end. At all events, you will not think of him now. You should think of those who really love you, and care nothing if you have money or not.' ' But I don't know who they are,' echoed Ina, with a little laugh.

' What nonsense ! Why, I am older than you \u2014 more than three months,' speaking loftily. ' In actual birthdays, yes ; but I am old for my years. My great friend Augusta Vane is thirty-five, and she has been about the world so much, and taught me to look at things from her point of view, so that to me you seem ten years younger than myself. Age is different in the two sexes. A woman of forty is an old thing, but a man at that age is in his prime. I say, if you think of it, this is so. And you haven't told me who the others are ? Oh, yes, I know who you are going to say \u2014 Mr Romer. Yes, I know he likes me. He has done so ever since I was a child of fifteen. And how good he is ! I wish, though, he wasn't so nervous, and so dreadfully funny to look at.' ' Yes, he is that, but he is a first-class fellow in spite of it. But we won't talk any more about this. I can see you are knocked up. You are sure \u2014 sure that you do not care for Mackinnon \u2014 that you are not unhappy ?

I could not bear you to be unhappy.'"], [360, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 312 The girl was deeply touched, not only by the young fellow's devotion to herself, but also by his unselfish heroism. ' Dear boy,' she said. ' I am not unhappy. I feel that I have had a great escape. My life might indeed have been one of wretchedness had not all this been discovered. Believe me, he is nothing to me now. He may even marry Mrs Smallpiece if he likes.' ' She is the woman we used to see in the Cathedral, isn't she ? Yes, I thought so. Per haps she was to old Smallpiece's taste.' ' Perhaps ; but what funny taste his must have been,' with a little laugh. ' Listen, there's the luncheon bell. I won't ask you to stay to-day. I would rather be quiet with papa and mamma. And then, you are not meant to come and see me, you know.' ' Don't send me away again,' pleaded the boy. ' I have been so wretched. Let me come !

Page WI-"], [363, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 313 rather a failure. Another minute, and he was gone. ' Ina, what is it ? I see that something has happened ! ' It was Mackinnon who spoke. He had just entered the Rectory drawing-room, and the girl was standing on the white mat in front of the blazing fire. She was dressed in dark green, and wore a little bunch of sweet-smelling violets. There was something in the girl's eyes which frightened Mackinnon. ' What is it ? ' he said again. ' I sent for you to give you my answer. It was better to give it this afternoon than to morrow. It is \" No.\" I do not even thank you for your offer.' ' Ina, what have I done ? Tell me ! ' 'Shall I tell you, Mr Mackinnon? I do not think you will like to hear, but still, if yon wish it, I will.' ' I do wish it ! ' His face had grown very white, and he moistened his lips. ' I refuse you then because of your action with regard to the clerk at my father's bankers. Yes, I know of it, and Mr Prior knows it too. That is one reason.' ' Good God, I shall be ruined !

I thought it more prudent to \u2014 ' 'Mr -Mackinnon, I- have not the slightest wish to hear what your thoughts are on the subject of prudence.' Such a calm, contemptuous tone ! He had never heard Ina speak like that before. Each word seemed to cut him like the lash of a whip. An ugly light came into his eyes. ' Perhaps you thought I had more money than I have,' he said. ' Perhaps it was only the knowledge that I had to be prudent that made you cry off?' ' You know you think nothing of the kind,' the girl replied. ' Such an answer is worthy of the man who in the hour of his prosperity refused to help his widowed mother, and has left his sisters to toil day after day in an Edinburgh shop ! Ah ! you see, I know all about it ! I know, too, of other things, \u2014 of the poor woman who, because of your selfishness in neglecting the unsanitary state of her cottage, died.

' Mr Mackinnon, there is no use in our pro longing this interview. It will be better, I think, for you to go now. I have given you my answer, and the reasons for it. You gave out our en gagement too soon, you see.' Mackinnon's face seemed, if possible, to grow whiter than before. He looked at the girl, and knew then that, selfish as he was, he had loved her better than he had thought. He recognised all too late the fool he had been. Ah ! what matter if she had money or not, so long as he could win her. ' Ina,' he gasped, ' for God's sake forgive me ! I love you ! Try me again ! ' ' What you ask is impossible,' the girl an swered quietly. ' If these things had not come to my knowledge, I will tell you frankly what I believe my answer would have been. Thinking that I could lead you back to better things, and that you loved me, I should have told you that I was willing to be your wife. Life seems to me very useless \u2014 my kind of life, I mean \u2014 and the idea of helping you seemed to me a sort of vocation. I did not actually love you, but I thought that would come, because, as I said just now, I believed you loved me, and"], [366, "316 CATHEDRAL BELLS. that you were an honest, honourable gentleman. Now, the bare idea is odious to me. That is my answer. There is nothing more. Leave me, I beg.' 'Is that final?' 'It is!' Then Mackinnon turned, and with an oath went out of her presence. As he went down the narrow path he knew so well, he understood what his selfishness had cost him. I think in all Carswell there was no man more wretched that afternoon than the junior partner in the house of Hammer, High light, Festing & Co. Ina stood alone by the fire for a long time after Mr Mackinnon had left her. There was a special service in the Cathedral that afternoon at half-past three instead of at five o'clock, and the bell had already begun to sound before she moved from the spot where the Banker had left her. She was, as I have said, a girl full of high purpose. She had never loved Mac kinnon, but she had been fascinated by him, and the belief that she was in reality what he often said \u2014 the one holy influence in his life \u2014 had led her to think that in marrying him she would be doing a great work. She had let"], [367, "CATHEDRaAL bells. 317 this idea grow on her until she had almost learned to believe it was her mission in life to save this man. . She, felt stunned at the whole affair. The knowledge that if she had carried out her intention, her life would have been ship wrecked, frightened her. She felt she could hardly realise the escape she had had. Standing there by the warm fire, she began to wonder how it was that Mr Mackinnon should have fascinated her, \u2014 how it was that she could have been so willing always to do what he wished. He could never have really loved her, yet when she thought of some of his tender speeches, she felt that in a way he must have cared for her. But he had not loved her like the boy who had been with her that morning, and whose first thought had been not his own, but her happiness. No, it had not been love of that kind, which was very similar, in its unselfishness, to that which the poor little lean Curate enter tained for her. She was too young, too innocent, to be able to distinguish between the mere passion of the Banker and the great pure love which filled alike the hearts of the humble clergyman and his friend the Earl. She only comprehended that there was a great distinction. Then the bell stopped, and she started. She had meant to go to the special service. If she started at once she would not be very late. She went up-"], [368, "318 CATHEDRAL BELLS. stairs and put on her hat, and then made her way through the cloisters into the Cathedral. ' Oh, Miss Ina, there is a message from Mrs Strong to say we are to send down a jar of beef tea, and another bottle of brandy, as quickly as possible ; and it's Martha's birthday, and Missus gave her leave to go home to tea ; and William's gone on a message for Master right up to the Hospital, and I don't know when he will be back ; and please, Miss, what shall I do?' Ina was standing in the hall, having just come in at the conclusion of the service, and the speaker was the Cook. The girl looked at her pretty little gold watch. It was a quarter past four, and would soon be dusk. Still, the matter was evidently important. She ordered the things to be put in a basket, and wrapping a thick white cloud round her throat set forth with it herself. It was bitterly cold. The snow had ceased falling, and it was now freezing hard. The girl looked about her as she hurried through the Close, hoping to see some one she knew, meaning to ask them to walk with her, but there was no one about. She turned into Smith Street, and hurried along down to the Railway, and then turned off into the narrow dirty streets"], [369, "CATHEDRaAL BELLS. 319 which lead to the Canal. It was getting very dark, and several of the men gazed at her with looks which rather frightened her. She began to think she had done a stupid thing in coming into that low neighbourhood without some kind of escort. It was too late, however, to do any thing then, so she stopped, and asked a dirty looking woman, who was standing at the door of a house, which was the shortest way to Piffin's Wharf. ' Up the Canal, on the right, and then down Creek Alley,' was the reply, and Ina hurried on. She turned up the narrow ill-smelling court, and made her way across it, when loud angry cries coming from the street she was entering made her stop. She saw a crowd of some twenty or thirty men hurrying straight towards the spot where she was standing, and by the loud voices and brutal curses guessed at once that it was one of those street fights which she had often heard her father and Mr Romer lamenting over. She stopped, and shrank into a doorway, hoping to escape notice, while her hands trembled so that she could hardly hold the basket. Directly afterwards the crowd swept into the Alley, and the girl caught the sound of stray sentences such as 'Look out there!' 'Don't let him get by!' 'Stop him!' 'Split his head open ! ' and then came another voice"], [370, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 320 which Ina knew well \u2014 the voice of Mr Mac kinnon. ' Will you let me pass, man ? Do you know who / am ? You had better not touch me! Keep off, I say \u2014 keep off! Help \u2014 help ! ' 'Keep off!' sang out a rough, fierce-looking bargeman. ' Do you think that's likely, you black devil? Don't I tell you it's you as killed my Sal? What do you care about that, so long as you have the rent ? The Doctor said that she was poisoned by them drains. It's no thing new to you to hear of them. The man what came for the money said he had spoken this many a time to you. Keep off! A likely tale! Why don't you answer? I'll knock them teeth of yours down your throat if you don't ! ' ' Do not be violent, I beg,' Mackinnon answered, in a frightened voice. ' I \u2014 I didn't know about the drainage. I am very sorry for your trouble. Here is some money for you.' A frightful oath, and the clink of a coin on the pavement, was the answer, followed by a sudden scuffle \u2014 a blow and a groan. Ina looked wildly round for help. To call for the police was useless. She thought of rushing out and appealing to the crowd, when from the narrow"], [371, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 321 Alley a little figure all in black darted out and flung himself into the thick of the crowd. A moment later and Mr Romer \u2014 for it was he \u2014 was standing beside the Banker, and the people fell back. The backs of both gentle men were towards Ina, so that they did not see her, but they were so close that she could hear distinctly what was said. She shut her eyes and leaned against the wall, while she endeavoured to conquer the faint feeling which had come over her. ' I fear you are hurt,' she heard the Curate say. ' The scoundrel ! ' gasped Mackinnon, holding his jaw, and almost dancing with pain as he spoke. 'The scoundrel has knocked out my front teeth ! Good God ! I shall be disfigured for life, if they don't kill me before I get out of this. If the police would come, I would soon have that fellow arrested.' ' Ay ! Have me arrested ! ' cried out the bargeman who had struck the blow. ' Do you think we here ain't a match for both of ye? Have me locked up! Why, man, I'll brain you, if you don't keep that there tongue of yours quieter. You're the murderer of my girl. Do you hear ? By ' \u2014 here he swore a frightful oath \u2014 ' I'll do the same to you.' x"], [372, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 322 As he spoke he flung himself forward, amidst a wild yell from the crowd. The Banker gave a cry of terror, and in another second the bargeman would have had him by the throat, had not James Romer flung himself between them. Stand back ! ' he said sternly. He was a little man \u2014 this Curate \u2014 with scanty muscular powers, and the bargeman could have carried him under one arm with ease, nevertheless, at the sound of the quiet de termined voice, he fell back. He knew whose it was. He had heard it last that very morn ing whispering comforting words into his Sal's ears. He owed him much for what he had done during these last few days. Terrified beyond measure at the approach of death, at the thought of a life lived in defiance of God's commands, the poor pretty creature \u2014 pretty in spite of her unwashed face and matted, disordered hair \u2014 flung herself from side to side on her wretched mattress and shrieked aloud at the thought of meeting her offended Maker. She was so young to die, not twenty, she couldn't die, she wailed, but her cries were of no avail. She lay there in the wretched room with the big, half-savage bargeman who had been her ruin holding her hand in his. And then James Romer had come and spoken wonderful words, telling her of a"], [373, "'STAND BACK!' HE SAID STERNLY. Page 322."], [374, ""], [375, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 323 loving tender Father ever ready to have com passion on the greatest sinner. And as she listened to the clear, gentle - toned voice, Sal grew calm, and before he left her it was settled how if she grew strong again, Jim and she were to begin and lead an altogether different life. And James had been with her, too, when she had died \u2014 died with her hand in Jim's. The great bargeman had been half beside himself with grief ever since, wandering up and down the narrow lanes muttering curses, and waving back those who would have sought to comfort him. Now he looked at the little Curate in the light of the dim lamp, and remembered how he had been good to his girl,\u2014 good when all others had failed \u2014 staying with her for hours in that poisoned atmosphere, bathing her fevered brow from a little bottle of eau de Cologne which he had brought her, and every now and then wetting her parched lips with the cool lemon drink which he had showed them how to make. He wasn't one ' to hold with parsons and such like,' the bargeman told himself, but this man was different, and had a claim upon him. He fell back at the order of the clergyman, panting a little, and glaring with hot, feverish eyes at the terrified Banker cowering away behind the Curate. ' If it wasn't for you I'd kill him,' he said."], [376, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 324 ' You were good to my poor girl \u2014 very good. If it wasn't that he was your friend, I wouldn't keep my hands off his throat a minute ! ' ' You would not get at his throat till you had settled me, Jim,' the Curate answered. ' I should be good, too, for a few minutes, even against your stout arms, for I am more wiry than you think. You will let him go,' he went on, ' not because he is a friend of mine, because I tell you plainly before his face that he is nothing of the sort, but on account of what some one said to you to-day, \"You will live a bit steadier, won't you?\" Yes,' he added, turning to the crowd, 'that is why Jim is going to let this man who has injured him pass out of the court without further harm, and he expects that you will follow his example. Mr Mackinnon, you may go in safety.' Could this be the shy, nervous Curate whom she had known so long, Ina wondered \u2014 this quiet brave man, speaking so firmly ? She gazed at him in astonishment and admiration, and then her eyes fell on the white, frightened face of the Banker. Good heavens ! to think that she might have married this creature ! She looked at him with contempt as he stood there holding his handkerchief to his mouth, which"], [377, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 325 was still bleeding, and giving frightened glances at the crowd. ' I can't go alone,' he said, in a nervous voice to Romer. ' They might kill me. You must come with me.' 'Jim.' ' Yes, Parson.' ' Tell your friends to stand back, and to let this person go.' The Curate felt as he looked at the wretched being beside him, that he could not give him the grand old title of gentleman. The bargeman, in a rough, yet half eloquent speech, did as he was bid. ' He be one of the righteous sort he be,' pointing with his hand towards the Curate, ' but he be very good to us poor folk, and he stood by my Sal and never left her till he saw her safely through, and the quiet kind of look come on her face. For Parson's sake, we'll let him go' In a hushed silence Mackinnon turned to depart, when his eyes fell on the slender, grace ful figure he knew so well, standing in the doorway. That she should have witnessed his last disgrace \u2014 for he knew that he had been a coward \u2014 stung him to the quick. He gave a cry, almost like the howl of a beaten hound, and shrank away. As he passed along a"], [378, "326 CATHEDRAL BELLS. neighbouring street the silence was broken by a cheer. It was the crowd wishing James Romer good-night as, with Ina clinging to his arm, they hurried down to the house where Mrs Strong was keeping watch beside the deathbed of another bargeman's wife. Let us, Reader, wish him good-night too, for, me thinks, he is something of a man. At least, so Ina thought, as she held his hand, bidding him adieu, when he had seen her safely home from Piffin's Wharf that same evening. How good and true he was ! How much he loved her! If only she could have returned it! but that was impossible. Love does not come by order."], [379, "CHAPTER XII. ' Bell ! thou soundest mournfully, Tellest thou the bitter Parting hath gone by. Bell ! thou soundest merrily, When the Bridal party To the church doth hie.' Longfellow. The violets were out, and scenting all the country round Stackfield, three months after the events recorded in my last chapter. It was the first week in April, wanting only six more days to Easter, and in the Cathedral at Carswell services seemed to be going on all day long. The place was crowded, but there was an air of mourning about the throng which seemed to increase as the days went on. Alas ! there was need for it ! All through the winter a low, virulent form of fever had continued down by Piffin's Wharf and about the neigh bourhood of the Canal, but since the middle of March it had increased fourfold, and in vaded every part of the town. Mrs Strong had got into a fright, and wanted to send Ina"], [380, "328 CATHEDRAL BELLS. away, but the girl refused to go. There were no cases in the Close as yet. No one else had gone, and she did not like to be the first to fly. True, Mr Mackinnon had taken rooms five miles out, but then the conduct of the junior partner was not much to go by. Ina shook her head, and called to Lord Rossmere to get ready to come and escort her to church, for the Cathedral bell was sounding for after noon service. It was the first day of the Holy Week of 1 88\u2014 . ' What was your mother saying ? ' the young Earl asked, as he followed his divinity out into the mild spring air. ' Only about this fever. She keeps on wanting me to go away, but I sha'n't. I don't want to,' and Ina turned up her nose and shook her head. The young fellow's face fell. It haunted him perpetually, this dread of the girl contract ing the deadly malady. Then suddenly his face brightened. ' I know,' he said. ' You shall come and stay at Stackfield. Will you?' ' What would your father say ? ' He would be delighted. I know he would. Will you ? ' ' If he asks me, and your sisters care to have me.'"], [381, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 329 ' Care ! Why you know how fond Beatrice is of you, and I am sure Mary likes you as much as she can like anything that isn't my father, or a political article ! ' Ina laughed. Lady Mary's great devotion to useful and serious things was rather a stand ing joke between these frivolous young people. ' It seems a little cowardly to run away though,' the girl said, and her face wore rather a thoughtful expression as she and Lord Ross mere made their way under the grey arches into the Cathedral. Day after day the pair had come through this sad Lent time, and people had got as a rule quite accustomed to see them together, and even mothers of marriageable daughters turned less green than they used to do. ' If I do go there I must come in for after noon Sunday School,' the girl thought, as she settled herself in her place. ' I couldn't disap point the poor fellow again.' The poor fellow was Mr Romer. ' Do you remember my telling you before you went to Scotland that I should have some thing to tell you when you came back?' she had asked the Curate, in the gloomy twilight of Christmas Eve, as she and the clergyman were binding wreaths in the dusky Octagon Church. ' Yes, I remember.'"], [382, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 330 It was not often he forgot anything she said, he thought. ' Well, when I said I had something to tell you, I meant I had a favour to ask you ; but I don't like to be refused. Will you grant it, I wonder ? ' ' I think I may say yes. If you ask it, then it is sure to be good.' Ina shook her head. She never believed that she herself was worth anything at all. ' It is this. I \u2014 I want you to let me have back my old class at the Sunday School again. Will you ? ' looking up at him shyly, diffidently, and yet knowing all the time that she was delighting him. ' Let you ! ' was all he said, but the recol lection of the sound of his voice, and the bright happy look on his face, made the girl feel that she could not again disappoint him in connection with the school. She did not love him \u2014 could not \u2014 he was so nervous, so utterly awkward ; but his deep devotion to her touched her, and all she could do to avoid giving him pain she did, with one exception. This exception was allowing Lord Rossmere's constant attendance on her. Gradually the boy had fallen back into his old ways of coming, and nearly every day tea time found him in the quiet Rectory draw-"], [383, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 331 ing-room. At first Lord Stackallan had fussed and fumed, but as he saw the deep cloud which had fallen on his son lifted from off his spirits, he began to give way. After all, it was only his own wish that Daisy Barrington and the lad should marry. There was no real neces sity for this first-cousin match. To be sure, the immense dower which would go with the Duke of Berwick's only daughter would have been a great thing for the property, but, after all, money was not everything. He himself had been a poor man when he had wedded his Lizzie, and the Berwick property had not then been what it now is, for the great coal mines had not been opened. Yes, they had had to think and consider at first, but he would not have changed his bride for all the gold of India. Ah, how gladly too would he not lay down his worldly wealth and honours to have her back again. Hush ! No ! Such a wish was selfish. His Lizzie ! By-and-by he would see her again. In a little while. Oh, that it might be soon ! ' Your mother wished it, you say ? ' Lord Stackallan asked his youngest daughter one afternoon when they were alone in the library, and discussing Rossmere's improved looks since he had been once more allowed to visit at the Rectory. ' Your mother wished it ? '"], [384, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 332 ' Perhaps I have put it too strongly. What our dear one said was \u2014 he has often told me of it since \u2014 that if you had not wished other wise she would have preferred that his choice might have been unfettered. She sent her love to Ina Strong, and told him \" It was a fair face ! \" ' ' I never knew of this till to-day,' Lord Stack allan said, in a husky voice. ' Why was I not told ? And tell me, does this girl care for him ? ' ' I think she is very fond of him, but she looks upon him as such a boy. She is old for her years.' Does he speak of her to you ? ' Lady Beatrice laughed ' He never speaks of anything else when he is with me.' Lord Stackallan smiled \u2014 a sad smile \u2014 and looked out of the window at the park in the early spring sunlight. The violets and crocuses and other simple homely flowers that she had loved were coming up everywhere. That was over now ! Doubtless where she had gone the flowers were fairer than the flowers of earth. ' If she likes him, the rest will come. They are of the same age, you say ! Well, I will make no objection, if in two years they are both of the same mind. For my part, I am in"], [385, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 333 favour of men marrying young. I myself was only two - and - twenty the day I brought your dear mother home,' looking away at the car riage drive, beneath the lordly trees of which he and his loved one had driven on that long gone wedding-day. ' How people are standing about ! ' exclaimed Ina, as she and Lord Rossmere passed out of the Cathedral into the churchyard the after noon of which I am writing. ' Why didn't we go through the cloister door ? What a lovely afternoon \u2014 just as warm as summer.' ' Oh, Miss Strong,' exclaimed Mrs Skelton, coming up at that moment, ' have you heard ? \u2014 poor Mr Romer is down with fever ! My husband saw Dr Fraser just before service, and he says it's a bad case. He was at the Wharf this morning, and did not seem very ill then, but about one o'clock he fell down in the street, and they had to get a cab and take him home. A nurse is there from the hospital already.' ' Mr Romer ! ' Ina said. ' It is impossible. Surely my father must have heard.' ' Alas ! you will find it is quite true,' the Dean's wife replied, and then with a kindly nod went on down the narrow lane to the Deanery. ' Dear old fellow ! I hope it isn't so bad as all that ! ' Lord Rossmere exclaimed, and then they entered the hall of the Rectory."], [386, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 334 ' So do I,' Ina answered. A lump rose in her throat. He was so good, \u2014 had loved her so. ' Oh, my dear ! ' exclaimed Mrs Strong, com ing to the drawing-room door, ' such trouble ! Poor Mr Romer is down with fever, and Dr Fraser is most anxious about him. Your father is there now. He is in such a dreadful state about it ! ' So it was true then ! They went into the drawing-room and drank their tea almost in silence, and then Rossmere hurried off to make inquiries at the Curate's rooms, while Mrs Strong occupied herself about jelly and beef tea, leaving her daughter sitting alone by the fire. Very ill ! How strange it seemed ! He had never been ill before that she could remember. To be sure, he had always looked thin and pale, but that was only because he would half starve himself in order to be in a position to give to the poor. Those years of self-denial were but poor things to build up a constitution against an attack of fever such as this. That was what every one had said about the poor bargees and their wives and children. If they had been properly nourished, they would not have died off directly the malady seized them. How much he had cared for her ! She was very glad now she had retaken the class at the"], [387, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 335 Sunday School. How pleased he had been about it ! And how he had enjoyed the walks back to the Rectory when the work was done ! He had told her so more than once. Far back as she could remember him, this man had loved her. Ina knew it, \u2014 was sure of it. Even as a child of fifteen he never used to take his eyes off her. What a pity she could not return it ! That was impossible, \u2014 doubly so now when she was beginning to comprehend that, in spite of calling him ' a boy,' her boy lover had pretty well stolen her heart away. But that night she could not think much of anything except James Romer. A great womanly tenderness filled her breast for this lean Curate, whom every one had laughed at, whose manner had, in truth, been ridiculous, but who, long ago, had won his way into the hearts of the Carswell people by his simple, noble, unselfish life. He was going from them now. Something seemed to tell Ina so, and she knew it spoke the truth. The girl did not sleep much that night. The next day Mr Romer was in the same state. ' Very prostrate ' was the word Dr Fraser used, and at the afternoon service in the Cathedral he was prayed for. Ina covered her face with her hands as the name was read out, and Lord Rossmere"], [388, "336 CATHEDRAL BELLS. toyed nervously with the leaves of his prayer book. Wednesday came, and Thursday \u2014 Maundy Thursday, and in the sunset hour Mr Strong stood beside the Curate's bed, and gave him the Bread to eat and the Wine to drink. It would be in the Father's Kingdom when they drank it together next, the Rector thought On Good Friday he was slightly better, but early the next morning he sent in haste to Dr Fraser. 'I am dying!' he said. 'Am I not?' ' You may pull through yet, but the odds are against you. I can tell you better later in the day, my dear friend.' Then the physician pulled his hat low over his eyes, and went down the street, and growled fiercely at a person who wanted him to talk just then. He came back to the Curate's rooms at two o'clock, and again at six. Congestion of the lungs had set in then. ' The end is not far,' said the Doctor. ' You are sure ?' 'As far as a human being can be about anything.' 'Is this fever infectious?' ' Yours , is not. The majority of cases in the town are ; but this is of a different type.' ' Good. Fetch the Rector.'"], [389, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 337 The Rector was in the church close by, assist ing his daughter and Lord Rossmere in putting some lilies in the font for Easter Sunday. 'What is it?' Mr Strong asked, bending over the sick man. He was not one given to ex hibiting emotion, but then his face worked, and he clasped the hand of the dying, fast. ' What is it ? If there is aught that I can do, tell me.' ' I should \u2014 I should like to wish Miss Ina good-bye.' ' I thought as much. Poor fellow \u2014 poor fellow.' The Rector went back into the church. Ina had finished the lilies, and she and Lord Ross mere were standing in the church door. ' He wants to see you to bid you good-bye. He is going fast' ' I'll come too,' Lord Rossmere said. In the little room it was very peaceful. Mrs Strong was there, standing by the mantelpiece. She went to the door when she heard the foot steps coming up the stairs, and, bidding the others wait, returned with Ina alone. ' Dear friend,' she said. ' I have brought some one to see you.' Then she drew back a little, and Ina stood beside the couch. The dying man looked up and smiled. ' Thank you for coming,' he whispered. ' I Y"], [390, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 338 wanted to see you once again. Please don't cry. I am so very happy, \u2014 everything that I could wish for. Your dear mother and father so kind \u2014 so good. Oh, indeed, I am not worth it. And then, to see you like this ! I wanted to tell you something, \u2014 to let you know that I love you, \u2014 that I have always loved you.' There was a pause after these words, and in the still room the laboured breathing which told of the congested condition of the lungs was painfully audible. By-and-by Ina spoke. She tried to tell him that she thanked him for his love. ' I shall always think of it as a great honour that one so truly good and noble as you should have cared for me. I thank you \u2014 I thank you.' ' It could never have been, I know,' Romer answered. ' Anything so poor and unworthy could never have possessed you, and so \u2014 do not grieve \u2014 I am glad, \u2014 very, very glad to die \u2014 above all, to die just at Easter. It is a beautiful time to go. And then, to have you here like this, and to see you like me a little. I think I have never been so happy before.' He had been very poor all his life, \u2014 had known what it was to have to toil, and to see others suffer without being able to relieve them ; but it was over and done with now. He"], [391, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 339 would be sad or sorry no more. The mother whom he had loved had been taken from him, but their separation was over. In a few hours at most they would meet to part never any more. The girl he had loved with a great, pure love was beside him then, thanking him for that very love, and weeping for his going. Her parents were his dear friends. He lay there thanking and blessing God for His goodness and his own happiness. By-and-by he spoke again. ' Ina,' he whispered, ' I mustn't keep you. Did you say Rossmere had come to see me ? How good of him ! Will you fetch him ? Stay, though \u2014 bid me good-bye first. Won't you kiss me before I go ? ' A little flush came on the girl's delicate cheeks. She bent down, and complied. Save his mother's, hers were the only lips that had ever touched his. The young Earl came and sat on the bed, and held his friend's hand in his. He could hardly speak for crying. 'You will marry her, I think,' Romer whis pered once. ' I never thought so before, but now something tells me it will be so. Your father has consented? Yes, I am glad of that. Of course, it hurts me a little just to think of it \u2014 yes. You'll take good care of her, will you not?'"], [392, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 340 The young fellow bowed his head for answer. He could not speak. By-and-by they gathered round the bed, to wish the occupant a last good-night, saying they would come again in the morning, since only Mrs Strong was to remain through the night. He smiled when they spoke of to morrow, and then, lifting his feeble hands, he joined those of Ina and the young Earl. ' God bless \u2014 bless and guard you both ! ' Then the eyes closed, and he fainted away. Throughout the night at intervals he spoke to Mrs Strong of all her daughter had been to him. A little before three he fell into a light slumber, and woke just as the sun was beginning to gild the roofs of the houses. ' Very early \u2014 the sun being now risen,' he murmured, and then ' God bless Ina \u2014 Good-bye \u2014 Saviour of men, have mercy,' and once again he spoke the word ' Christ' After that he turned on his side, and died without a sound. The Easter sun fell full upon his face as he passed through the gates of Death into Eternal Life. ' It's all over, my dear,' Mrs Strong said, going into her daughter's room when the bells were pealing for early service. ' All over, and so peaceful,' then she stopped, and Ina burst into tears."], [393, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 341 It was a glorious Easter Day that \u2014 warm as summer, while all the sky was one great sheet of blue. And in the grey Cathedral, and in the Octagon Church of Saint Mary, the people sang 'Jesus Christ is risen to-day,' and thought of James Romer, doubting not that already he had seen Him whom, while life was his, he had endeavoured to serve with all his might. And in the church porch, and in the streets, everywhere, they spoke of him. A noble life had passed away. He had been poor and nerv ous, and they had laughed at him, but they had known all the while the beauty of his bright, unselfish, homely character. He had lived not for himself but for others, and in death he had his reward. Let us, Reader, thank God that there are in the world such men to preach to us by their lives a more eloquent sermon than ever fell from the lips of mortal preacher. Charles Gordon was such a one as this \u2014 Charles Gordon whom England left to perish ! And so in Carswell there was mourning far and wide that Easter Day, above all, there was mourning in the cottages by the Canal, and in the quiet Rectory of Saint Mary's in the Close. In the Cathedral, people noticed that Miss Strong did not come in till the second service, and that then she wore a thick veil."], [394, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 342 And on the third day in Easter week they laid James Romer to rest in the cemetery of Carswell, beside his mother. Lovely and beau tiful in their lives, in their deaths they were not long divided. Just ten months from the very day that he had walked behind her coffin, they bore him through the cemetery gate, ' feet first.' The Cathedral bell tolled forth its solemn note, and the shrill bell of Saint Mary's followed suit. There was a simple service in the Octagon Church, when a few privileged friends were present, but the bulk of the mourners waited quietly for the procession at the entrance to the cemetery. ' Even such an awful soothing calm We sometimes see alight On Christian mourners, while they wait In silence, by some churchyard gate, Their summons to the holy rite. And such the tones of love which break The stillness of that hour, Quelling the embittered spirit's strife, The Resurrection and the Life Am I : believe, and die no more.' The bargemen from the Canal bore him to his place beneath a cypress tree. It was very still and peaceful. But when the final words of the service were spoken, through the crowd a sudden murmur ran, as though they said his life had been well spent."], [395, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 343 A year had passed. May came, and by-and by the golden days of golden June. And on the day which is the longest in the year, under the grey arches of the Cathedral, Rossmere and Ina were made man and wife. And loudly pealed the bells, and through the dim aisles echoed the triumphant strains of the Wedding March, as side by side the bridegroom with his bride passed through the great door on their way to the Deanery, which had been placed at the service of Mr and Mrs Strong. And late in the afternoon, the carriage drawn by four horses drove gaily from the door amidst a shower of rice and slippers, away towards lordly Stackfield, for the young Earl would do just as his father had done before him, and brought home his bride upon the wedding-day. ' I don't think we shall ever forget the dear fellow,' Ina said, as her hand lay in that of her husband, and the cortege swept past Jessop Street, where once James Romer and his mother lived. ' I am sure I never shall,' Rossmere answered. ' He taught me that to live for others is better than living for oneself. I have great oppor tunities in my power. Darling, till death us do part, you must help me to make the best use of them.' And Ina answered, \u2014"], [396, "CATHEDRAL BELLS. 344 ' Love, I will ' Then the carriage rolled under the last triumphal arch, and they were out in the green lanes, and the cheers of the people were left behind. Only, as they drove beneath the swaying branches of the trees, ever and anon they caught the silvery tones of the Cathedral bells. It was the last sound they heard, too, as they entered the great hall at Stackfield, and Rossmere bade Ina welcome to her new home. THE END. v. : M. : 4.4.89.
