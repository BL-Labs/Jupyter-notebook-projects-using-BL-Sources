It was a keen January day ; the air, though still, Avas grey; and the sun had not even \u2022attempted its frequent struggle AA'ith the Lon- don smoke and the English atmosphere of winter in a town. The feAV unhappy foreigners avIio reared pale and melancholy faces out of English great-coats and English comforters, and aa'Iio crept out by gaslight, to be driven in by siioav or fog, had long ceased to hope for anything but this \" vilain temps.\" Madame de Stael, indeed, had said, \" Repondez, etran- gers \u2014 la nature est-elle chez vous belle et bienfaisante ? \" But her compatriots, or the natives of even more favoured climes, who saAv London (as Margaret did from her AvindoAv), and for the first time, had never been guilty of repeating the question. A thin and iron-mould stained blind was"], [16, "MARGARET. 6 drawn half over the one window of which I speak.

Her look AA'as not that of a happy AA'oman settling to a busy day's AA'ork ; rather did she Avear a somewhat distressed and anxious ex pression, as, leaning back in her chair and unbuttoning a pair of very Avorn and rubbed kid gloves, she kept her eyes and her mind fixedly on the board before her. Small hands, and very Avhite they Avere, to be clothed so poorly ; but there are little hands that can do great things, and a mean covering has sometimes held a great spirit. These little hands seemed to Avield a very effective pencil and, Avith a sigh, she disemburdened herself of a large share of her anxieties, AA'hatever those"], [17, "MARGARET. 7 might be. In a quarter of an hour's time she Avas fully as engrossed as she had found her brother. Presently there Avas a pause. She laid down the pencil, held up the board, and surveyed it carefully; her head a little on one side, the arched eyebrows raised, half critically, half wearily. \" I think it will do,\" she said, re placing it on the easel. \" It will do.\" Poor words, with which we have so often to satisfy ourselves. Not, \" It is right,\" or, \"I am content,\" only, \"It will do.\" I suppose the Avords will be said until time is over \u2014 till avc can aAvake up in God's likeness, and be satisfied Avith that. The paint-box lay beyond Margaret's reach as she sat there ; to reach it she must move the easel and her chair.

Yes, she had better have a copy. And Gaspar had wished there should be something over the left shoulder.

Gaspar Marshall Avas to have a deep crimson fold across his portrait, and across the portrait's heart. He Avould have liked a purple better, I think \u2014 purple is suggestive of kingly blood and of laurels, and neither of these does he despise. Margaret Avas a wise girl, but I think she Avas foolish enough really to believe and tu tliink as she arranged the flannel folds that no crimson and no purple were too good for Gaspar. If he were appreciated \u2014 if his great talents Avere only developed and made knoAvn !

Practical \u2014 no, Gaspar Avas hardly that ; but Avhat great man ever Avas practical ? at least, what man like Gaspar, with talents such as Gaspar had ? What Avould the article be like? When should she see it in print? Would Gaspar remember that Elspet's Avages had been a"], [20, "A/AR GARE/. 10 month due, and that the ten pounds he could earn by the few strokes of his ready pen would just pay them ?

For Margaret would not go abroad Avith her brother : he had many friends of Avhom she kneAV no thing ; and it Avould not be the first time she had been left alone.

Suepeise or vexation at the idea of her brother's possible absence and impracticable scheme was not, however, the paramount cause of the troubled expression which (immediately that he had turned his back) came upon Margaret Marshall's face.

Margaret's strongest conviction, next to her belief in Gaspar (and ahvays excepting her faith, which reigned supreme, and influenced every action of her life), AA'as that great genius must to some extent be accom panied by and inseparable from refinement. Joshua Pickering's pictures had seemed to her to speak from the soul of a great man.

The difficulty, how- ever, cannot make us doubt the too apparent fact.

It was nothing more than she expected, for this AA'as the latest day alloAved him, and there lay the unfinished manuscript upon the table.

The dull afternoon quickly Avaned, and shades crept closer and thicker over Mar garet's easel. They had reached the fold across Gaspar's heart ; they had strayed into his red-broAvn beard.

Now that the shadoAv touched the beard, she rose hastily, and, pushing back her chair, turned to the fire she had quite neglected. Women have strange fancies, imaginative women especially ; and Margaret had the gift and its consequences in large share, though she might be of the earth, earthy. At this moment her fancy Avas to avoid seeing the evening shadows pass over Gaspard's painted face. I suppose men are not troubled by such Avhims, but a Avoman (if she be alone especi ally) is haunted by them perpetually, and at every turn. Is it the weakness of a Aveaker mind, or is it the life that is by circumstances so often forced upon her?

These whims are, let it be said, generally but momentary. Margaret poked the fire, went to her brother's room to do the same kind office there, and left the easel and the picture to be devoured by shadoAvs. When she returned to the sitting-room she took a match from the bundle on the mantel piece, so as to be in readiness when Gaspar's footstep should be heard on the stairs.

Gaspar was in the habit of return ing home for a cup of tea or coffee, and to dress for dinner in the not uncommon event of his being asked to dine with friends, or at a friend's house. Margaret had not long enjoyed the fire and quiet when the familiar footstep was heard. Almost at the same instant she rang the bell, and lighted the gas. But Gaspar came up stairs with unusual speed, and he Avas in the room before she could throAv away the match. \"Look out, Margaret!\" he said, excitedly (and Gaspar is seldom excited), \" a friend has come in with me.

The morning service being too long for the children, she had gone alone ; and the sermon over, she felt she could not repent of having left them behind.

And then preachers are a recognised butt, a bone of contention ; poor Prometheuses bound to a rock, afterwards to be torn to pieces by ravenous eagles.

Indeed, according to her account, the greater part of the parish was probably feeding too. She met Margaret a hundred yards from the house. \" He do knock Scripture at ye, ye see, miss, like as Ave were convicts a-going to be hanged \u2014 you'd never go to think we was a respec tible, steady parish, miss, without no pertikler sins, so to speak, to hear him letting on \u2014 now would you, miss?

His eyes grey and keen, and withal very truthful, were reflected in his daughter, minus the keenness. Hers were larger, softer per haps, very wide open, and of a deeper grey.

And finally, Ellen Williams, in a brown dress, with a collar that did not meet by two inches, but scrupulously neat and clean, came into the room, and held out a square white hand to Margaret. \" Papa and I are very glad to see you,\" said she. \" I saw you in church, and I wanted to know you.

How it is accepted, in how limited a manner, and what influence the acceptation bears upon our life, I hope in turn to consider. Lastly, I would lay before you the reasons I find for believing that we may accept it, in a very grand, and lofty, and extensive sense. \" Firstly, then, how it is accepted. And I need not repeat that I mean by the avowed professors of Christianity. ' God Avith us.' Sometimes we have it as a text at Christmas. It then conveys to us the remembrance of the actual presence of our Saviour on the earth. According to our various dispositions or imagi nations, the mind leads us from this point to other things.

Kind to the good, a punisher of the wicked, seated upon a throne, and following with a judicial eye the footsteps of all earth's little children. \" Or again, do Ave not sometimes (some of us, I fear, at all times) view Him, as an abstract Being, ruling the universe perhaps, but quite apart from us men and our doings ? \" Or as a fate, from which we cannot by any means escape ? \"Or as perfect holiness Avithout the element of love, failing which, holiness is no longer holiness ? \" Brethren, the God of all the earth has mercy so vast that none dare exclude his"], [183, "ATARGARET. 173 brother from His presence, nor condemn any conception of Him, so long as it savours not of irreverence and unbelief. But may Ave not hope to enlarge our own miserable and small conceptions? The age is progressing, science is progressing, all things are progressing around us : why, then, should belief Avax cold, and our ideas of God alone remain stunted ? Nay, they have shrunken and grown small, for David of all men had the most elevated and enlarged conception of his Creator and his Friend ; and David lived a thousand years before Christ. \" And it is in this Avay that our ideas may be enlarged. By extending God every way, if so I may speak; not raising Him to that pinnacle of greatness at Avhich He cannot reach us, but giving Him all power as well as all glory. And all power does not concern itself with mighty things alone, but with all things, small or great. He that could say, ' Arise,"], [184, "MARGARET. 174 take up thy bed,' to him that could not rise, could also forgive all sin. He that made a universe can make a man to walk upon one small spot of that universe. Our Creator, and yet our Father and our Friend, our elder Brother and our King, our High Priest and the Lamb for sacrifice. \" But I anticipate ; for I Avould now speak to you of the cold and meagre acceptation of this truth as shown by the influence \u2014 shall I say the lack of influence? \u2014 it has upon our lives. \"Do we believe in the continual presence of God when we use in common conversation the words 'chance,' 'luck,' 'misfortune,' 'acci dent ? ' If He is ' with us,' He is not a passive observer, I imagine, but an Agent, a Father, a directing hand. \"Do we believe in God's actual presence when we speak of Him with irreverence, with"], [185, "MARGARET. 175 distrust \u2014 when we drive His Spirit from the inner temple by lightness or by wilful sin ? \" Do we believe that He is with us when we fret continually under a petty trial, under a trial of any sort or kind, and struggle restlessly to be free from that which He has suffered shall be for a little time our portion? Do we believe that the grave is in His hand, and that through the dark valley He leads us when we murmur and rebel (I do not say when we mourn, for to mourn is Christ-like and is blessed), that one whom we would have here is taken to a better country ? \" My brethren, surely to believe is not to realise. We all believe that God is with us ; how many realise it as a noble truth ? . . . . \" But while I speak, a certain disease of man's soul comes to my remembrance ; and lest any in this place should now labour, or in bygone times have laboured, under it, I would,"], [186, "176 ATARGARET. by the help of the God who is with us, speak a word of comfort and of hope. \" The disease I mean is an inability to realise the presence of God. \" You have all felt, my hearers, I am per suaded, more or less, aware of it or unaware, this torpor, this languor, this miserable searching for a God you cannot find \u2014 a_God who has heretofore been yours, who heretofore has heard your prayers, who never heretofore has failed you. \" I beseech you let not this cause you to despair.

It is too much for most women; I know it was too much for Margaret. \" Mr. Carew ! \" she said gently, and it sounded to him as if heaven opened and an angel spoke. There was such a look of ex pectant hunger in his face when he looked"], [201, "ATARGARET. 191 up, that Margaret was almost frightened. He began to rise. \" Please sit still,\" said she quickly, \" and listen to what I am going to say. I want you to forgive me for having been rude and scornful to you. I know what you are doing when you ask me to be \u2014 your wife. I know that you have got over your pride, which I wounded last year. I knoAv that you are stooping, as no one else would stoop perhaps, and \u2014 oh, indeed you don't know how unhappy I am ! it is that that helps to make me rude to you. I don't know why it is I am so stony. I cannot love you yet.\" \" Oh, Margaret, did you say not yet?\" And there came a glory of sunshine all over his face, as if she had said, \" I love, and love, and love you.\" Margaret wanted to answer : she wanted to say, \" I don't knoAV if I shall ever be able to"], [202, "ATARGARET. 192 love you; but I grieve for you in my very heart.\" She wanted to say, \" Gaspar is away, and I have not heard from him.\" She wanted to say everything of her misery, except that she was very poor. But she broke clown instead, and said nothing. She held her handkerchief to her face and cried like a little child. There come ridiculous episodes in the greatest dramas of life. Luke Carew was going down on one knee with a vague wild desire of thus comforting Margaret, Avhen a patter of feet brought him to his own. Mar garet escaped lest the children should see her tears. \" What was you doing to my Aunt Mar g'ret?\" said Charlie. \" Was you saying your prayers ? \" \" Something very like it,\" said Luke to himself; but \" What have you done with the"], [203, "MARGARET. 193 boat I gave you?\" he said to the children. His face looked like a summer day after a thunderstorm \u2014 some of the trouble left, but a deal of glory shining through. \" 0 we've got it here in the tub, come and see.\" \" 0 do come,\" said Dolly, pouting her red lips out of her white sun-bonnet, and wag gling her stiff newly-washed frock behind her, as they darted like sun-winged dragon-flies into the garden. \" Here, in the garden,\" they called shrilly ; and Luke followed them, moving his head backwards and forwards, and up and down, as if he had just recovered from a stiff neck, and thinking what a beautiful day it had become all of a sudden. \"What have you got for sailors, eh?\" he asked, not caring the least for the answer. \" Look here ! two jolly blue-bottles. That's VOL. I. o"], [204, "MARGARET. 194 Aunt Marg'ret, and that's you.

Aunt Marg'ret's seek a good sailor.\" The garden gate clicked, and Ellen Wd liams's broAvn hat came up between the lilac and the toav of wallflowers. Luke Carew sighed. Margaret up-stairs thanked God. She feared another tete-d-tete more than she could say. She ran down cheerful and bright, with red marks round her eyes, but a lighter heart. She would be very careful in her behaviour. What had she said or done when she cried?"], [205, "ATARGARET. 195 How could she cry before Luke Carew? She would be quite at her ease noAv, neither cold nor too friendly. She showed him her latest picture of the little village girl, with the brown hair and the primroses.

I suppose not.\" \" But it is not finished,\" put in Ellen apologetically. \" You have not made the hair tidy yet, Margaret. What a pity you did not tell me in time, and her mother would have put it in curl papers.\" Margaret smiled. Luke Carew smiled too, but not at Ellen.

I have"], [210, "ATARGARET 200 so little time for reading now, and I love it so. \" Of course I will come, clear Margaret,\" said Ellen, earnestly. \" And I hope you will look happier after I have read.\" She evidently looked upon it as a dose to be administered for the re-establishment of her friend's mental health ; enjoyment to be derived from it for herself poor Ellen did not for a moment dream of. \" I know a girl that did not marry the man that asked her,\" said she, after a pause, her mind having wandered back to the old sub ject ; \" but then she liked a man her father did not like, and that Avas very Avrong, of course.\" \" Was he a bad man ?\" asked Margaret. \" I don't know.

Obedi ence is good, disobedience is bad : Mary Green was disobedient, therefore she is bad. That was about the extent of Ellen's argument and conclusion. Every clay Margaret became more puzzled as to the conduct of Mr. Williams, and more distressed at its results.

Margaret marvelled and grieved ; some others in the parish grieved and marvelled too. But for the most part anger and bitterness against the poor, ill-judging man SAvallowed up all other feelings. Yet a few remained, alas ! to lay upon the Almighty Being the sins and offences of this prophet that was called by His name. There seems to me no solution of the problem if it be not here : \u2014 \"Men shrink more from skin diseases than from any other. . . .

But he has something yet to say : \u2014 \" I say good people ; I do not say very good, nor do I say Christ-like, for that they are not.\" If this, I say, be not in some degree a solution of the existence of such men and of such con duct as Mr. Wdliams's, I know of no other.

They had met in a coAvslip field, where each had brought her little ones to play and to pick the sweet, maizy blossoms with Avhich the ground was carpeted ; and Avhile the childred played, Margaret had talked to the pale young woman with the paler baby on her knees, and had elicited from her her story.

The summer had come in real earnest ; despite a certain fear and a certain sorrow at leaving her little ones, it seemed to Margaret that the summer had crept into her heart too, as well as into the"], [237, "ATARGARET. 227 heart of the rose. She gave a sigh, part anxiety, part happiness, and part thankfulness for the new blessings of the day, and then she turned into the dining-room, where Charlie and Dolly Avere catching blue-bottles behind the blinds.

As a desperate resource she dragged in Gaspar's name : at other times she maintained a pro found and contemptuous silence with regard to him and his opinions. \" What'll Mister Gaspar say, Miss Mar'gret?\" she asked. \" I don't know Avhat he will say,\" said Mar garet sadly ; \" but go I must, Elspet.

Ominous sniffs and significant sighs sounded through the house all day as she went about her business. After this she gave herself up to calm resigna tion and the concoction of some palatable story to be offered to Mrs. Hobson \u2014 with a"], [239, "MARGARET. 229 view to further and extensive currency in the village \u2014 in explanation of Margaret's length ened absence. That Margaret would not herself be cautious, Elspet knew well enough. She therefore deter mined that for no shortest period of time should Mrs. Hobson and her mistress be alone to gether. A handle of the door needed polishing at that precise moment, or an extra rose was brought in to adorn the vases, or Margaret's presence was imperatively needed elswhere. Margaret's movements village-wards were ner vously watched ; but, blessedly for Elspet's peace of mind, her mistress was too busy at home during those last days, to allow more than a hurried visit to Jeanie Carter and one or two of her poor friends.

There were one or two books that she felt she had rather not see in Ellen's hands, that she Avould rather not hear in Ellen's voice. She had time to save some of them.

She liked the quiet, and she felt she had nothing in common with the party at Beauchamp Towers. She was mistaken, however ; for with two at least she had much in common, or would have hereafter. The grass waves gave ominous warning of approaching footsteps. Margaret looked round. \"Walking alone, Miss Marshall?\" said Mr. Leslie, to whom she had merely bowed across a large table. \" How is that ? \" He had a pleasant open expression, that atoned for much that was faulty in Margaret's eyes ; such as an exceeding white and pink ness, a perfectly girlish smoothness of face,"], [251, "ATARGARET. 241 and a sunny head of hair, too \" pretty,\" she thought, to be manly, according to her ideas.

But how his father came into it is a different thing. The son was not ashamed of it, why should he be so ? \" My father Avas a son of the soil,\" said he to Margaret. \"He made all his money in mills.

The story of Mrs. Beauchamp's invitation list was cut short just as Mr. Leslie related with much gusto that Miss Beauchamp had once suggested to her mother that the busi ness would be best settled by asking people alphabetically. \" Only the day all the S.'s come, I shall have a sick headache, mamma, and not come down.\" They had noAv reached the church, and Mar garet had no further conversation AA'ith Mr. Leslie for some time ; for on their return homewards he escorted Miss Beauchamp, and she found herself walking by a most amiable old-maid relation of the family, Avho, being"], [257, "MARGARET. 247 Avithout settled home, vocation, will, property, or gifts of any sort (barring the angelic temper), was at the beck and call of any one, kin or no kin ; and, moreover, was under unceasing and overpoAvering obligations to them, as she thought, for favours tossed at her sideAvays, and gratefully gathered up.

It was something very new to her to see a life so full of sunshine, and she Avatched it with the interest of a phenomenon. Philippine soon discovered this. \"You have had a great deal of trouble, I can see that. And beginning to teach seems a good opening for fresh annoyances.\" \" I am happier than I have been for some time past,\" Margaret ansAvered, \" because my mind is at rest about \u2014 those I care for, and I see my way to helping myself at last \u2014 and them.\" And she blushed involun tarily.

Did that artist, Mr. Pickering not put you up to that?\" \" He would not think of it,\" said she \" and, I must say, I never thought of it either, at least, of making any definite arrange ment. I must leave it to Mrs. Beauchamp.\" Mrs. Beauchamp and Mrs. Penrhyn came in at that moment, Miss Middlemay folloAving in the rear. \" I hope you are earnest, my dear, over your Avork,\" said the mother. \" Remember that such opportunities must not be throAvn away. Have you any card of terms, Miss Marshall, by you ? \" Margaret coloured again, and said, \" None.\" Mrs. Beauchamp wore an eyeglass, and"], [276, "MARGARET. 266 so did Mrs. Penrhyn. They both brought them into play at once. Phil had taken the precaution of throAving her unsuccessful daub to the other end of the room at the sound of approaching voices, but Margaret's stood on a chair before her. There AA'as a long silence. She did not work for she could not, Avith those criticising eyes upon her. Mrs. Penrhyn Avas Avaiting to hear what Mrs. Beauchamp would say ; so Avas Miss Middlemay. Mrs. Beauchamp, being no judge, gave her opinion very positively. \" You have got that arm too long by far.\" Margaret ventured to differ, and to prove that the arm was exactly as it should be. \" Measurement or no measurement, no one will persuade me that is in proportion. Don't you agree Avith me, Mrs. Penrhyn?\" \"It certainly appears so,\" responded that lady."], [277, "ATARGARET. 267 \" appears so,\" echoed Miss Middlemay from the background. \" I think it is a great pity you have so little colouring in your picture,\" continued Mrs. Beauchamp ; \" who ever saw a girl with those broAvn shades on her neck ? \" \" I quite agree Avith you,\" said Mrs. Penrhyn, nodding her head sagely. No echo from the background this time. Miss Middlemay saw that Margaret Avas being assailed, and that she Avas fighting single handed, or rather bearing it all patiently. And after this she could not be induced to corroborate Mrs. Beauchamp's statement. This Avas the less difficult, because her opinion Avas never asked for. AVe must be prepared to find in all our avocations, Avhatsoever they may be, that even the measure of real merit Avhich does exist and transpire, will not by the ignorant among our"], [278, "268 ATARGARET. friends and critics be recognised and acknow ledged. Superiority can afford to stoop, and to single out such beauties as are to be found. A botanist by a muddy roadside will see the one rare or interesting plant that lifts its tiny head, Avhen common passers-by AA'ould only see the mud. The very difficulties, too, that genius must surmount to reach its pinnacle make the man of genius (of Avhatever degree) merciful to the short-comings of others, and appreciative of Avhatsoever of good and great they have attained to. And, again, nothiug is so easy as to de preciate. To find fault, it might seem, at first sight, would necessitate that the fault-finder be on a certain moral elevation ; but there is no doubt that to appreciate demands a higher still. And haA'e we not fallen to the loAvest stage of degradation Avhen, unable to conceive or to create beauty, intellectual, artificial, or"], [279, "MARGARET. 269 moral, Ave are also incapable of admiring the creation or the conception of others ? Poor Margaret, she suffered Avhat all as pirants must suffer. The first time the heart aches, ay, and the second time too. Perhaps the third time the heart takes courage, and rebels, and cries, \" AVhat care I ? \" and the fourth time it is part sorrowful, part doubtful, part thankful. The first fury is past ; the self-satisfaction, too, is past. There remains a little wholesome indecision, a certain won dering over the criticism given, a deal of doubtfulness of self, a little courage at the thought that all men, great or small, that toould be great must pass through the ordeal.

Life without hope ; death Avithout hope \u2014 Avhich is hardest ; which most awful ? \" Kill me and put me out of my pain ! \" said Phil Beauchamp hastily ; but had she paused a moment she might have shrunk, I think, from parting Avith the only happiness she was ever to know \u2014 from laying aside the"], [282, "ATARGARET. 272 beautiful face she Avore, and the pure, glad heart, even the paltry pleasure of teasing Jack Leslie \u2014 for a yawning grave, and corruption, and silence everlasting.

It is strange that that nature that Mr. Cargrave Avorships \u2014 that we too worship under another name \u2014 should for once so bitterly deceive us. Margaret was thinking someAvhat in this strain on the evening folloAving her argument, when she Avas disturbed by the rustle of Mrs. Beauchamp's dress, which fold after fold was composing itself in a chair beside her. Mrs. Beauchamp gave it an admonitory pat, and"], [283, "A/AR CARET. 273 then a smooth of approval. Lastly, she shook out her lace sleeves, and tried to disentangle one from the clasp of her bracelet. She began talking to Margaret in a manner so changed and affable that she seemed to be a totally different person. Margaret had heard Mrs. Penrhyn say that Mrs. Beauchamp was a most charming woman. Noav she began to think so too. \" I am so surprised to hear you are a near relative of my very dear and old friend, Lady Margaret Marshall. Mr. Leslie has been tell ing me she is your cousin,\" she said, after some conversation. \" She married my cousin,\" said Margaret. \" I do not know her at all ; I have never seen her.\" \" AVe hope to go to Levington next month,\" continued Mrs. Beauchamp, taking a cup of coffee from the tray held before her; \"and VOL.

The wilful colour had mounted into Margaret's face, and she had drawn herself up threateningly. \"I think I am not mistaken in supposing you are first cousin to Marshall of Levington, Miss Marshall?\" And Mr. Penrhyn next smiled blandly, and raised his someAvhat ner vous eyebrows into interrogative shapes. The same form of question and answer was gone through again. It Avas wonderful what a difference this \"connection\" made in the eyes of the small world at Beauchamp Towers. Margaret became quite a subject of interest and conversation. Every one knew Levington,"], [285, "ATARGARET. 275 and the Marshalls thereof, either personally or by hearsay. By the end of the evening the news had percolated through the entire assembly; and even Miss Middlemay had con veyed her veiled congratulations to Margaret.

Next day, when Philippine Beauchamp ran up-stairs with a paper in her hand, and told Margaret that a gentleman was calling there, Avho spoke of a Gaspar Marshall as his friend, she was greatly surprised to find that Margaret \u2022did not seem more anxious to meet him. \"What, Margaret?\" she said, \"not go down and see the man Avho may have seen your brother later than you ? \" For Margaret, with tears in her eyes, had little by little dis covered to Philippine the secret of her affection for her brother ; each time retracting half she had said, as if it were too sacred for strangers'"], [286, "276 ATARGARET. ears, and each time forgetting herself again in praise of the beloved one, and under the seductive charm of the girl's manner. \" You have not said anything about me ?

I came up as soon as I had heard him mention the Something RevieAv for some month, ' in which,' he said, ' my friend Gaspar Marshall wrote a first-rate paper.' \" \" I cannot go,\" said Margaret nervously - \" don't ask me, please.\" And she squeezed twice too much light red on to her palette by mistake. \"Do you knoAv avIio he is, Margaret?\" asked Phil kindly. \"No, not at all.

It almost seemed as if she were ashamed of the position in which she found herself at Beauchamp ToAvers. Could Margaret know such miserable shame ?
