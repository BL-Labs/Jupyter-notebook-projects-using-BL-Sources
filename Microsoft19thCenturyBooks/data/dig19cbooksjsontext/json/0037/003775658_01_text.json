CHAPTER I. \" A knight there was, and that a worthy man, That from the time that he first began To riden out, he loved chivalry, Truth and honour, freedom and courtesy.\" It seemed to him that the old church looked quainter than ever. He had been ten years away from his native parish, so that it was natural enough that he should find most things strange \u2014 and yet familiar too. The Autumn sunshine shot a ruby bar of light across the family pew, direct from the side window, with exactly the same precision as when he was a boy, and his great-grandfather glared down upon vol. i. 1"], [10, "THE HON.

But something about the whole con ducting of the service struck him as being ludicrous. He was not in any wise profane, he had an honest, healthy, love for his church ritual, and his belief in his God was as sound as the church bell itself ; but there was a touch of old-worldism, of a comfortable drowsiness, about everything that amused him. Certainly the churches abroad, with their florid pictures, and flower-decked altars, and dim soft lights and shades, and glittering candles that shine like stars, and music so heavenly sweet as to move the very soul within one, were a bad pre paration for the calm appreciation of a country with its droning, out-of tune, choir, and its windows, for the most part of plain glass, through which the light"], [11, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 3 fell with a coarse whiteness that was, to say the least of it, distinctly inartistic. And yet, after all, there was a sense of rest in this quiet, dull, old building \u2014 a nearness to the desirable oblivion of the grave, that held and enchained both mind and heart, and satisfied them de licately. When last he sat in this worm-eaten pew he was nineteen, to-day he was twenty-nine. Ten years ! a terrible lapse of time ! All the faces round him, with the exception of one here and there, were new to him, though some at least amongst the younger mem bers of the congregation must have been pretty nimble on their limbs when he left home. Then, his father, the old squire, was alive \u2014 now, there was no one to keep house at the grand old place up there amongst the nodding pine trees, that even from this distance cast their shadows across the chancel, save he.

August sunshines were no doubt the same everywhere ; years cannot change them. He was a little glad, perhaps, when the sermon, which was about the death of Absolom, and had been full of graphic descriptions of how that perfidious person must have looked when dangling midway between earth and sky from his treacherous locks, came to an end, and he was free to leave the sombre shadows within, and wander forth into Nature's magnificent display of light outside. Mrs. Mardyke, the rector's wife, was waiting for him. He remembered her well, with her soft intelligent eyes, and iron grey hair ; it was scarcely greyer than when last he saw her ten years ago. Many a time and oft she had done him good service, standing between him and the rector's wrath, when that fatal Latin grammar had once again been the cause"], [13, "THE HON. MRS.

He would have liked to stay and talk with her about old times, but a slender hand was thrust through his arm and a charming face was uplifted to his. Both belonged to his cousin Dorothy Aylmer. He had renewed acquaintance with her a fortnight ago in town, so that her greeting was empty of the solemnity that marked the other. \" So you have really come ! \" said she, with a little, pretty, affected air of aston ishment. \" In spite of your assurance in Berkeley Square, and the interest with which I have watched the idling of that army of workmen up at the Chase for the last ten days, I never really believed you would condemn yourself to a solitary confinement of this kind.\" \" I can't be solitary.

It isn't fair. The proverbial forty winks might at least be conceded to me.\" \" Make them fifty,\" said she. \" What I want to know is about the afterwards.

He could see his father, too, moving from tree to tree, admiring the one flower that was his own special hobby, and scarcely heeding the endless cackle of the old lady who hobbled after him, volubly discoursing on the rival virtues of this treatment and that for the beloved plant. He pressed her hands very warmly, and quite won her heart by the two or three judicious remarks he made. He was very like his father, she said, but perhaps not quite so handsome, not quite \u2014 but good enough to look at, in spite of all. The cackle was of the same order as he remembered, and amused him in part. He gave her his arm, and took her down to where her carriage waited for her at a small side gate, and refused her pressing invitation to luncheon, because he felt there must still be some of the old folk who would expect to shake him by the hand.

He stood, and stared at her, and as he stared, defence less, thoughtless of armour, she walked, albeit unconsciously, into his heart. She stood just a little way from him, full of a lovely indecision, and then her body swayed a little and she came to him and very shyly held out her hand. \" Everyone seems to be claiming you as an old friend. Why not I ? \" said she softly, she was looking at him in a gentle friendly fashion. Her face was entirely colourless, except for her mouth, which was red as one of Mrs. Mackenzie's roses. Her eyes were dark, and so mournful as to give him even at this early moment a sharp pang of regret for her. They rested on him sombre and thoughtful even whilst the red mouth smiled. \" I expect I am the oldest acquaintance"], [18, "10 THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. os all,\" went on this lovely apparition as he held her hand. \" I was quite a baby when last we met, and parted. Moreover,\" with a little low laugh, \"I am afraid I must confess that I remember nothing at all about it.\" \" A baby ! \" repeated he, amused and fascinated. \" So young ! Surely then I may be excused if I too declare I have forgotten.\" Who was she, this beautiful girl ? He tormented his brain to try and recall something that might lead to the solution of the mystery. \" No ; you will not guess it,\" she said, as if reading his dilemma. She shook her head slightly ; she seemed very young, barely twenty, yet there was an air about her that puzzled him. \" I was one of the Eowtons of Eyelands ; and I know that I know you, because the boys have so often told me about you, and talked of you, and, indeed,"], [19, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 11 made me quite friendly with your name, at least.\" \" Why, of course,\" cried he, brightening. \" And you are like your father, too.

It almost seems to me, indeed, that your very name comes back to me. Cis \u2014 was it ? or Cissy ? or \" \" Cecil now, an' it please you !

Surely the faintest shadow deepened the already too mournful curves of the young lips. \" Why, what matters that,\" said hey ea\u00b0\"erlv, \" if the world has sained a new Cecil ? \" \" Ah ! I don't know that,\" she said, quickly. \" Old days, believe me, have their charm.\" \" But,\" said he, as if puzzled, \" when"], [20, "THE HON. MRS.

Then I came home, and \" She paused abruptly \" They are all gone,\" she went on again presently, speaking nervously. \" Charlie is in India, Tom in Africa, and dad \u2014 dad is dead. I only am left.\" She spoke with indescribable melancholy. To St. John, indeed, it seemed more than that. The low delicate accents were suff- gestive of despair. But in a moment she had shaken off her depression, and once more turned her eyes on his. \" And so, as a fact, you had forgotten our past friendship,\" she said. She was smiling again; she had ap parently entirely flung off the touch of dejection that had caught her, and was looking at him with a glance that was brilliant."], [21, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 13 \" And if I have,\" said he, boldly ; \" and if I even declare that I do not so much as regret it, can you wonder, when I see before me the chance of a fresh friendship before which that earlier one sinks into insignifi cance ! \" The words in themselves were sufficiently impressive to attract her, but the look that accompanied them, though altogether re spectful, was so ardent, so undeniably admiring, that it startled her. As if displeased by it, and surprised, she moved back a step or two, and a touch of hauteur grew upon her face. With a last courteous word or two, that were, however, entirely devoid of that first friendliness that had charmed him, she turned aside and slipped into a group near her, and presently he could see that she had gone down the central path, and had stepped into a perfectly appointed carriage that stood outside the entrance gate. A carriage in connection with the"], [22, "14 THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. Eowtons \u2014 in his time a sadly deficient race, so far as money was concerned \u2014 struck St. John as strange. They had always been poor \u2014 nay, ever on the verge of bankruptcy ; but, perhaps, that old aunt in Brighton had done the correct thing by her, and had left her her money at her death. He stood staring after the carriage as it rolled away, lost in thought, until a gentle tap on his arm roused him."], [23, "CHAPTER II. \" That fairer was to seen Than is the lily upon his stalke green, And fresher than the May with flowers new (For with the rose colour strove her hue I n'ot which was the finer of them two.)\" \" Bewildered, sweet cousin ? \" asked Miss Aylmer, saucily. He smiled at her in turn, throwing off the touch of glamour that was holding him, and told himself, as he had often told himself during the last fort night, that she was indeed very pretty. Her face was piquante, original, delicious ; more decidedly lovely perhaps than the one that though beyond his sight, still stood out in a bold, if soft light before his mental vision ; but to him there could be no com- parison. \" Are you losing your head amongst all the intricate windings of these new old"], [24, "16 THE HON.

I launched you safely when I sent you to Mrs. Mackenzie, but I fear since that, you have gone hopelessly to wreck. To judge by your face, you are quite lost, it \u2014 Oh ! how d'ye do, Captain Farquhar,\" with a brilliant smile and a glance, that said plainly this smile was meant for him alone. The young man thus favoured drew up by her side, and looked distrustfully at St. John. That he had accepted that charm ing greeting as specially his own, one could see at a glance by his undisguised delight- Misguided youth ! \" What I was going to say,\" continued Miss Aylmer blithely, addressing herself again to her cousin, \" is, that to avoid the social shoals and quicksands that abound in this benighted neighbourhood, would take a Stanley.

VEREKER. 17 callow young man, and giving him a smile the very sac-simile of that just bestowed on Farquhar. That the new-comer regarded it as a tribute to his own charms was beyond question. He too ranged up alongside, and glowered with equal polite ness on Farquhar and St. John. \" I thought you were still in town,\" said he. \" I'm never still anywhere,\" returned she ; which was the literal truth, though she didn't mean it. \" I've an aunt, as,\" \u2014 with a swiftly comprehensive glance at him \u2014 \" you have good reason to know, and she draws me whithersoever she listeth. At present she is determined I shall vegetate down here, and muse upon my sins, so that What ! you, Mr. Sunder land!

He was feeling intensely amused."], [27, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 19 The three strange young men stood round her, whilst she conversed with him, and seemed not to think it at all derogatory to their dignity to wait upon her moods. It was evident that she had them in very good training. He would have liked to say so, but it would have been impossible with those six pairs of watchful ej'es. \" Ah ! you will see later on,\" said she, answering his last remark. \" Good natured doesn't express it. I simply seem to live for others. A perfect saint I am, if only I get my due. I do \u2014 sometimes ! Well,\" with a vague, friendly, sweeping glance around her, that includes all her attendant satellites. \" It's getting late, isn't it ? There is something suggestive of luncheon in the air, and I don't fancy the rector will like us to bivouac amongst the tombs, so I'll sajr good What ! are you coming with me ?

Farquhar looked black. \" I shall be only too glad. Need I say it? Good-bye, Hilary, if you can come down to-morrow, I will give you a lesson or two in deportment.\" \" Why shouldn't I come now ? \" said St. John. \" I can't come under the head of trumpery, as there are three already.\" \" Another ! \" cried she tragically. And then changing her tone to one of the utmost suavity. \" Four ! How nice ! Auntie will be pleased ! \" Here she caught Farquhar's eye, and that gallant Hussar, overcome by whatever he saw in hers, gave way to sudden mirth. \" It is so many years since I have seen our mutual aunt,\" said St. John, \" that I can hardly flatter myself I have still a place in her regard ; but \" \" Hope for nothing,\" said Dorothy calmly. \" She remembers you perfectly. Now \u2014 are you ready ? \""], [29, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 21 \" I think if you were to introduce me to your friends I should feel more at home,\" said St. John graciously. And the cere mony having been gone through, they all crossed the stile into the deep woods beyond, and strolled leisurely towards the tiny mansion over which Miss Aylmer senior lorded it triumphantly. After all, auntie wasn't pleased ! As they walked up the trim, short avenue that led to the pretty little house, half smothered in roses \u2014 Dorothy flanked bravely by her attendant cavaliers\u2014 a blind was suddenly jerked up in one of the lower windows, and a tall, gaunt woman, colossal in proportions, and armed with a binocular, presented herself. There was something apparently terrifying in this figure, because St. John found that the three other men stopped dead short in the middle of the avenue, and that Dorothy stopped with them."], [30, "22 THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. Meantime, the binocular had been laid aside and the sash flung upwards. Across the mild August air a voice that would not have disgraced a drill-sergeant rang with a startling force : \" Dorothy ! What means this 'indecent display ? Have you forgotten that this is the sabbath ? \" She took no notice whatever of the stricken men. Her steady glare seemed to go right through them, as though they were not. This they all felt to be trying. \" Why, no, Auntie,\" said Dorothy meekly. \" You see we've all just come from church. It was there I met \" She paused, and by an eloquent gesture pointed out the trembling young men around her. \" I shall countenance no such ungodly thing as callers on the Day of Rest,\" said Miss Aylmer senior, in enormous capitals. ' Whoever those persons may be, I refuse"], [31, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 23 to receive them in my house. Go home ! \" waving her mittened hand majestically. \" Go home at once ! Quit my premises ! \" With this, and without more ado, she slammed down the window-sash with a resounding bang, lowered the blind indig nantly, and retired from view. Dead silence ensued. St. John, who was conscious of having grown exceedingly red, looked nervously at Dorothy to see how she was bearing up under this most unfortunate contretemps. If he expected to find her writhing in the throes of shame and embarrassment he was soon extra- ordinarily enlightened ; he was quite prepared to pity her, to help her, so far as lay in his power, out of her painful dilemma, but one glance at her was suffi cient to dispel all thought of a necessity for such kindly intervention. Miss Aylmer was bending slightly forward and had given herself up a prey to silent but agonizing mirth. There was"], [32, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 24 not so much as one sign of chagrin or shame about her, and, as his eyes travelled still farther, he could see that her three companions were following her example and were choking with suppressed mirth. After a surprised contemplation of them all, St. John, to his .further aston ishment, found that he too was laughing, immoderately, but in the same noiseless fashion, and was beginning to consider whether it was a disease of an infectious order belonging alone to the avenue of the Aylmers', and whether he had not caught it, when Dorothy once more found her breath. \" Let us run ! \" said she. \" There is the side walk, let us get to it without loss of time ; she might draw up that blind again, and if so, I, for one, would not answer for the consequences. I have heard of an old blunderbuss of my grandfather's that is hidden away somewhere in one of her secret recesses.\""], [33, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 25 She caught up her skirts, and led the way to a secluded walk hedged in by laurels, where safety might indeed be supposed to dwell. \" She must have been reading her Bible,\" said Dorothy, when she had wiped her eyes. \" She is always specially bad when full of Holy Writ.\" \" Why on earth doesn't she go to church and hear it read there ? \" asked St. John with some just indignation. \" The Rector is young. She doesn't approve of him. Crabbed age and youth you know cannot dwell together without sanguinary engagements taking place every now and then.\" \" At that rate, poor you ! \" said her cousin compassionately. \" Oh, as for me, I'm temper-proof. I defy her,\" complacently, \" to rouse me. All this astonishes you because you are new to it. But,\" with a little sapient nod at the other three young men, \" these all know,"], [34, "26 THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. and now nothing surprises them. You can't imagine what a comfort that is, when it comes to a passage of arms such as took place just now. We are all quite aware that there are certain days when Auntie will not have us at any price. This,\" with another low, irrepressible laugh, \" is one of them. Unfortunately, we never know when the attack is coming on, or I should have been able to warn you. I am sorry,\" with a pretty contrite smile, \" that she should have been ' taken bad,' as Betty calls it, on this, your first day, but, believe me, you have gained something by getting rid of her so easity. And now go away, do, all of you, or I shall get a lecture the length of all your arms put together.\" Obedient to her command, they dwindled away slowly one by one. St. John remained to the last. He had a question to ask that he felt he could not take home with him unanswered. \" You told me you would be my Mentor,\""], [35, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 27 he said. \" Instruct me before I go in one small matter. I met Miss Rowton to-day. Where does she live now ? Alone, at Ryelands ? \" \"Miss Rowton?\" Dorothy stared at him as if only half understanding. \" There is no Miss Rowton now, and Ryelands is a thing of the past save for four gaunt walls.\" Then a light broke in upon her. \" Cecil! you mean,\" she 'said. \"But you are all wrong there. She is no longer Miss Anything. She is the Hon. Mrs. Vereker ! \""], [36, "CHAPTER III. \" And saide, ' Cousin mine what aileth thee That art so pale and deadly for to see ? Why cried'st thou ?

With age all is past (in every sense of the word), and there is nothing reliable, not even the future, which, even if obtained, holds out no prospect of pleasure. Mrs. Mackenzie was a clever, perhaps a rather unpleasant old lady, but she certainly liked St. John, and believed him an acquisition to the rather mawkish society around, and deemed it high time that he should settle down amongst them, and marry, and have heirs, as all respect able people do. She had two nieces \u2014 \" The Mackenzie girls \" as they were universally called \u2014 who were glad enough to stay with her the greater part of every year, their father's parsonage holding high rank amongst the uncomfortable places on the earth. They were what rude people called \" terrible girls.\" Tall, ugly \u2014 plain, at all events (I believe there is no such thing as an ugly"], [38, "30 THE HON. MRS.

To one of these nieces it was Mrs. Mackenzie's dream to see St. John wedded. If the laws of the country had permitted of his espousing both, she would have regarded him with even a more loving eye. There was quite a goodly gathering at the Grange on this particular day. There was Colonel Scott, a confirmed old bachelor, beaming away amongst the girls, with a face as red as a sunbeam, and a smile that stretched his kindly mouth from ear to ear. There was Bobby Blair, a friend and cousin of St. John's, who had come down with him, and who ran the colonel very close with the girls, and, indeed, at the present moment, was dis tinguishing himself, and utterly routing"], [39, "THE HON.

They were a little depressed, perhaps, because he hadn't been able to blacken his face, but, so far as it went, the performance was a great success. There were more girls than surrounded Bobby and the colonel, and through the openings in the shrubberies, and amongst the roses, and in all the private walks, pretty figures could be seen, flitting here and there, generally with a taller, less Graceful form beside them, whilst on the several tennis courts momentous battles were being fought, and victories lost and won. To the right there were tents that cleamed like conical suirar loaves in the rays of the autumn sun, in which tea, iced claret, and other cups, and, indeed, anything you might desire was to be found"], [40, "32 THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. To do Mrs. Mackenzie justice, lack of hospitality was not one of her failings. St. John, as was but natural, was the hero of the hour. All the girls, attached or unattached (except a few benighted beings who were very far gone indeed in other directions), gravitated towards him, and angled for, or openly asked for, introduc tions to him. Dorothy Aylmer, who held a little court of her own, and was independent of stray admirers, whispered to him softly, as he stood by her side for a moment, that she hoped he would not lose sight of the fact that a haughty spirit went before a fall, and try to keep humble. She in sinuated, too, that it behoved him to walk circumspectly, and with his eyes upon the ground, as, in the present backward state of the laws in England, harems were not openly acknowledged. He had laughed at her, and was quite aware that all her saucy whisperings were only meant to bring that scowl to"], [41, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 33 Farquhar's dark face ; but in truth he had hardly heard her. Just then he had seen someone sitting over there beneath the barberry bushes, that were weighed down with their wealth of yellow bloom, and he had thought for nothing else. It was Mrs. Vereker. They had met once or twice since that first Sunday in the churchyard, and he had become accus tomed to see her in many colours ; but never until now without them. She was dressed in a plain white cambric gown, without a suspicion of blue or pink, or maize anywhere. It seemed the simplest of gowns, yet the experienced eye could see at a glance that it never was made out of Paris, and that the few little scraps of lace that lay in it here and there were priceless. This charming costume was crowned by a big white hat, rather of the coal-scuttle type. It struck St. John, as he moved nearer to her, that she was singularly pale to-day, VOL. i. 3"], [42, "34 THE HON, MRS. VEREKER. paler even than was her wont. Her eyes looked larger, darker, and \u2014 though the idea seemed absurd to him\u2014 -frightened. The red lips, too, betrayed more openly that suspicion of melancholy that had sug gested itself to him on first seeing her, and that had somehow fascinated him more than all the radiance of her beauty. He was a man, indeed, strangely alive to im pressions of this sort \u2014 tender-hearted, honest, and ever ready to be touched by real distress in man or child or woman. He could hardly fail to see that she looked nervous, restless, and anticipatory. From time to time she turned her head from -right to left and back again, as though expecting, but not desiring, the approach of someone. St. John was still a good way from her when he saw this expectancy die, and the dark, troubled eyes concentrate themselves upon some object that to him as yet was unknown. Her pallor died too, and a hot and"], [43, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 35 almost cruel colour flamed into her face. It dyed cheek and throat and brow and gave him the idea that for the moment she was suffocating. She seemed, too, to shrink a little ; and yet she bent deliber ately forward, and compelled her un willing features to form themselves into a smile, the saddest St. John thought he had ever seen. What could it mean ? He had paused somewhat in his easy stride towards her, and now looked in the direction her eyes had taken. There he saw a man emerging from one of the tents, who, with a rather indifferent air, was walking direct towards Mrs. Vereker. That it might be Mr. Vereker never for a moment suggested itself to St. John. It was stupid of him if you will, but so it was. He was a middle-sized man, powerfully built, with a remarkably repulsive ex pression. It was not so much the thick, soddened features that displeased you, or 9#"], [44, "THE HON. MRS.

Just now, added to all these other charms, a dash of sullenness was thrown in, that heightened each. As he reached Mrs. Vereker, he paused and bent slightly over her, and muttered something to which she apparently made no answer. He waited a moment and then went on, much to St. John's unacknowledged relief. He was some disagreeable acquaintance no doubt, some fellow belonging to the county, whom it was impossible quite to ignore. He was glad the stranger had seen the wisdom of not continuing the con versation with her, as, if he had, he, St. John, would have felt it his duty to interfere, considering the very unpleasant condition"], [45, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER.] 37 in which it had seemed to him that the repulsive-looking guest decidedly was. Who could he be? St. John felt an intuitive hatred towards him, yet he could hardly have explained why. And one thing that should have been in his favour seemed only to militate the more against him. In spite of his brutish appearance, it was impossible for one in St. John's position not to see that the man was \u2014 or at all events was originally meant to be \u2014 a gentleman ! \" How d'ye do, Mrs. Vereker ? \" said St. John, coming up a little from behind, and therefore bending over her chair to make his presence known. She started sharply, as if still a little unstrung, and then turned a pale but distinctly relieved face towards him. It was more than relieved, it was pleased. St. John was doubly glad, first, in that she was so unmistakably sincere in her welcome of him ; and secondly, because he hoped to be able to combat for a"], [46, "38 THE HON. MRS.

It was, as I say, stupid, but he did not as yet connect that trouble with the man who had addressed her in passing by. \" Is that you ? \" she said, moving her skirts to one side so as to make room for him beside her on the broad garden chair. \" I quite thought you weren't here to-day, as I hadn't seen you \u2014 until \u2014 now ! \" Was there a suspicion of reproach in her tone ? There was none in her smile certainly, which was soft and friendly. \" You should not hide yourself away like this,\" responded he, gaily. \" How could one hope to see you, shut up in such a leafy bower ? What a place to choose ! Did you really want to escape us all, or was there some particular ogre ? \" He stopped dead short, feeling as if, innocently, he had made some be'tise.

It was plain that his absurd remark, with the word \" escape \" in it, had touched some grievously sore spot in her nervous nature. How painfully anxious she was to do away with the impression that she believed he had formed. The sudden hurt colour in her cheeks re- minded him instantly of the flush he had noticed just before the coming of that unpleasant fellow who had said a word or two to her before he, St. John, had joined her. Somehow this remembrance caused a connection to arise in his mind, and he vaguely wondered if she had indeed felt fear at the approach of that man. It seemed impertinent the very idea, and yet he could not divest himself of it, and"], [48, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 40 somehow he hated himself in that he, too, by his injudicious, ill-chosen remark, had brought that cruel colour to her brow. It annoyed him, too, that she should seek to make excuses for herself in that nervous, miserable way. It seemed to put him out side the pale of her friendship, and yet surely \u2014 though he did not as yet know why \u2014 yet surely instinct told him that she wanted friends. But \u2014 could he be her friend ? \" Why make excuses about it ? \" said he, with an assumption of lightness so well done that it deceived her, but which he was far from feeling. \" Do you think other people have not known the charms of solitude on a heavenly evening such as this ? The one great wonder that remains is, why we are here ? Why not deep in some mystic wood, with the book most beloved of our souls between our fingers, and a silence unspeakable, and therefore delicious, to hedge us in.\" \" The woods would probably prove"], [49, "THE HON. MRS.

She had seemed so eager, so glad, in her past memories, that he was anxious to keep her mind there.

A sudden passionate desire to fling him backwards, to loose her at all hazards from that contaminating touch, took possession of St. John, and he half raised his arm.

It was a revelation ! \" Come ! \" said the man in a surly tone of indisputable authority. But one man on earth could have had power thus to address her! At once the truth lay bare to St. John.

St. John was conscious of a shock that"], [53, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 45 for an infinitesimal space of time \u2014 so short as hardly to be noticeable \u2014 paralyzed him.

He took no more notice of St. John than if he had not been there. \" If it is tea you still want, you can get plenty of that when you reach home. And a damned sight better quality too. I'm not going to waste any more of my time in this infernal hole.\" Mrs.Vereker remained speechless \u2014 in spite of her hope of a moment since, degradation had descended upon her, and before St. John.

A wild longing to tell him to go away had held her as she saw her husband approaching, though he was by no means so drunk as usual, but she had not had the courage to do it. \" Why don't you get up ? \" said Vereker with an angry snarl. \" D'ye think I'm going to stick here all day, dangling after you ?

An intensely anguished ex pression grew upon her lips. \" D'ye hear me ? \" continued he in a thick threatening tone, and as he spoke he gave her a little shove.

He came quickly forward, smiling. \" Going so soon ? \" he said, pleasantly. \" Well I can't but say there is reason in the move.

He spoke rapidly, as if afraid if he once stopped he would not be able to go on again. Vereker growled out a civil word or two that as he gave them sounded uncivil, and St. John, feeling more despicable than ever, gave his hand to the sottish-looking brute before him.

Such a sound could come only from horses com pletely lost to all control. A second later brought into view a phaeton swaying wildly from side to side, and coming towards them with a fearful rapidity. It was apparent to anyone looking on that the two cobs in it were wild with fear, and had ceased to pay any heed to the admonitions of their driver, could that driver have been equal to an argument. But she was not. The cobs were well-known to St. John, and it needed not the second glance to tell him that Mrs. Vereker was the sole occupant of the phaeton.

In a minute or two they would pass where he stood, with Black Sandy beside him, and he realised that now or never was to be made the effort that would fling them on their haunches, and reduce them to reason. He glanced at the man beside him and saw that he was leaning forward, a wild look of exultation on his face. It was a horrible look, and, at the time, maddened St. John. His help was necessary, and he should have it. He caught Black Sandy by the arm and swung him fiercely to and fro. \" Man ! 'Tis a woman ! \" he said. At this instant the infuriated cobs rushed by ; he sprang forward and seized the reins. They were powerful brutes, and would in all probability have mastered"], [115, "THE HON, MRS.

Together they forced back the ponies, and presently, with a soothing word or two, and the instinctive knowledge that they had found their masters, the terrified creatures stood quite still, trembling, but subdued. Mrs Vereker was very wdiite, but when he had time to go to her, she had recovered her composure. \"It was such a mere nothing,\" she said, in a rather panting little way. \" Only a sow and her little ones that crossed the road ; but Magic,\" pointing to the off pony, \" cannot endure a pig.

I had better go on to Colonel Scott's and send a messenger from there.\" \" You needn't,\" said St. John, who was gazing down the road behind her. \" I can see him on the top of the hill, he is running to you ; I am sure from his bearing he is all right.\" \" Oh ! what a comfort,\" said she eagerly.

She had lost her colour because of the ponies' misbehaviour, but white as she was when St. John stopped them, she was not so white as she was now, when she made him this small request. His heart seemed to die within him. Without knowing \u2014 whilst even sternly forbidding himself to believe it \u2014 he knew the truth ! She was kept penniless ! Any married woman will under stand the cruelty, the degradation, of such tyranny as that. A miserable shame had crept into her lovely eyes, and it hurt him like the stab of a knife. But he was careful to conceal from her all knowledge of her confusion, and his voice was just ordinarily cheerful and courteous as he answered her. \" Is that all I can do for you ? \" he said. \" You are going on to Colonel Scott's, 1 sup pose.

St. John went round to where the man stood, still with his hand on the bridle of the cob near him. \" Mrs. Vereker is very much obliged, she desired me to give you this,\" said he, holding out the half-crown. Black Sandy, who so far had stood motionless as if dazed at the ponies' heads, now suddenly grew into life. He upreared his gigantic frame, and looked first at St. John, and then at Mrs. Vereker. His expression changed slowly, from stolid indifference to a slow rage and from that to a boiling fury. Deliberately he took the coin that St. John offered him, spat upon it, and without a word, flung it right into Mrs. Vereker's face. A second later he had cleared the wall, and had disappeared into the thick brush wood on his left."], [119, "CHAPTEE IX. \" If no love is, 0 God ! why feel I so ?

It had all happened so suddenly, so unexpectedly, and now the fellow was so far ahead that to run him down was out of the question. His second thought was for Mrs. Vereker ; she was lying back in the phaeton, very pale and nervous. \" You are frightened ! \" said St. John. He was pale too, and his eyes were flashing."], [120, "112 THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. \" That scoundrel, I shall take care that he lives to regret this day.\" \" No, no,\" said she eagerly. She leaned towards him and laid one trembling hand upon his arm. \" That is what I feared. But to oblige me, if I ask you, you will take no notice of it. Promise me you will not move in this matter.

She stooped, as if to arrange her skirts, but in reality to hide her face, and the little action was so ineffectual, so childish, that anyone would have been sorry for her. Old Colonel Scott's revelation about Black Sandy's daughter rose to St. John's mind, and of course he understood. \" Well, as you wish,\" said he carelessly. \" But it is over good of you to let that scoundrel go unpunished.

She moved to one side, and very willingly made room for him.

That you would not rather turn and go home ? \" \"Home! No!\" said she, with a quick certainty that told its own tale.

She loved her brother too well not to shrink from anything that might compromise him in the eyes of his world. She wanted to marry him, and marry him well, and to see him deliberately com promise nimself would ruin all her schemes. The fact that Mrs. Vereker was looking very white and nervous as she crossed the"], [123, "THE HON. MRS.

He is just the sort of man to let pity be akin to love, and of course she is to be pitied. One must admit that. But I wish she would look for consolation elsewhere.\" In the meantime, Mrs. Vereker, having greeted Colonel Scott, had gone swiftly to where Dorothy Aylmer was sitting beneath the branching limbs of a huge beech. \" Dorothy, can you let me have half a-crown ? \" she said softly, yet with such evident, even painful, anxiety that Dorothy, turning her shoulder to Mr. Vesey, who was sitting as nearly in her pocket as he could manage, drew her down caressingly on the seat beside her. \" Now don't give way to vulgar excite ment,\" she said, \" when I tell you that I am at present not only the proud possessor 8*"], [124, "THE HON.

I came out without my purse, as you know, but Dorothy has been my banker.\" He coloured slightly, but his tone when he spoke was studiously careless. \" Was that privilege denied me ? \" said he. \" What a hurry you were in to get out of my debt.

She crossed the lawn to where Lady Bessy was sitting, all unaware of the thoughts with which that rather highly-strung person was regarding her. She looked so dejected, however, that Lady Bessy, who preferred to think she was suffering the throes of slighted love, received her very kindly. \" Can't even such a day as this throw a little warmth into you?\" she said. \" You"], [128, "120 THE HON.

She was playing with a huge fan that she waved to and fro indolently, yet with a suspicion of rising anger. \" You and I hold such entirely different views,\" she was saying, in a clear, con temptuous tone, without troubling herself to look at Vereker, who was gazing at her with a most objectionable admiration.

His heart was beating ; to see her, so young, so helpless, so given up body and soul to her tormentor, was anguish to him. Until to-night he had done great battle with his love for her, but at this instant he knew himself vanquished. The little winged god reigned triumphant, and all hope of peace within him, from this time forth lay dead. \" You do not speak,\" he said unsteadily. \" Am I nothing to you ?

St. John saw it. \"Did I do that?\" said he, shocked. \"Did I hurt you?\" He took the hand again, very gently this time, and pressed the reddened spot with tender vehemence to his lips. \" I am tired,\" said she, very faintly. \" I will return to the house, alone. Alone will be better \" \"Oh! don't say that. Have I offended you ?

Wouldn't she come to his rescue, and save him from the damsel ? That young old girl had fastened upon him again, and was growing so fond, that he felt death or instant flight were all that were left him. There was no intermediate course. \" Oh ! no, you mustn't dream of giving"], [257, "THE HON. MRS.

Lady Bessy gave way to grim mirth Then she relented. \" Well, if you will be so good,\" she said, speaking reluctantly for the benefit of the Damsel, and slipping her dainty fingers through his arm she led him away, deter mined to be revenged upon him for all that. If she didn't give him a dance, she certainly led him a dance for the next twenty minutes or so. At the end of that time, having enjoyed herself beyond measure, she came up with Dorothy, wdio was standing somewhat within shadow in the outer hall. \" Not dancing, Dorothy ? \" said she."], [258, "250 THE HON.

They led her to a group at the upper end of the hall, near the door, which stood open. It consisted of Mrs. Vereker, and St. John, Farquhar, and the Hon. Francis. The latter was not exactly drunk, but he had evidently taken enough to let loose within him the Devil that possessed him. Neither Lady Bessy nor Dorothy had heard what had just been said, but they could see Mrs. Vereker shrink away from her husband, and, unfortunately, the step she"], [259, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 251 took led her to St. John's side. It was the last straw, the one thing wanted to drive Vereker's smouldering anger into flame. The evil passion, the uncertain jealousj^, that all night long had lain rankling in his breast, stirred within him, and grew full of life. \" Do you mean to stay here indefinitely ? \" he said savagely. \" Am I to consider myself well rid of you ? Do you choose him for your \" When he had got so far, as though even ashamed of himself, he stopped short, and, going up to his wife, laid his hand with a wicked grip upon her soft rounded arm. She did not even flinch, though the cruel fingers sunk deep into her flesh ; and only that her face grew whiter, she showed no sign of any feeling whatsoever. St. John, with a swift movement, caught him and flung him backwards. He would have fallen but that Farquhar put his arm out and steadied him. \" Oh ! I should not have come,\" said"], [260, "252 THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. Mrs. Vereker, in an agonised tone. It was all she said, and she spoke very low. St. John's eyes were blazing, and his nostrils dilated. \" Take care ! Take care ! \" said Farquhar sharply, with a glance at him that went on to Mrs. Vereker, and meant a good deal. Dorothy at this moment went quickly across the hall, and stood by Mrs. Vereker. \" Hilary, it is your own house,\" she said, with a touch of severity. Farquhar, in the meantime, had drawn Vereker into a private room. It had been very quietly done, considering all things, and the fear of a public expose was almost at an end. \" Are you going home with him ? \" asked St. John, addressing Mrs. Vereker. He was still pale, and almost trembling with ungovernable disgust and fury. \" Why should you ? Lady Bessy will be only too pleased to receive you for to-night.\" Lady Bessy, who heard this, though she was herself unseen, made a little face. She"], [261, "THE HON. MRS. VEREKER. 253 felt sorry for Cecil. But to compromise Hilary ! After all, who was there she could consider before him ? \" Or come to me,\" said Dorothy ; \" that will be better.\" \" I shall go home with him,\" said Mrs. Vereker slowly. \" But why, why ? \" cried Dorothy, impa tiently. \" Beally he looks unsafe. Don't be so impossible, Cecil. Do what is wisest for you.\" \" Yes. That is what I must do,\" said Mrs. Vereker, her face like marble, her eyes on the ground. \" I shall go where ever he goes.\" At that moment the door of the room on their left opened, and Farquhar came out again with Vereker. The latter looked sub dued but sullen. Whatever Farquhar had said to him, had brought him to a sense of the fitness of things, for the moment. \" Are you ready ? \" he said to his wife in' a thick surly tone, that to the listeners"], [262, "THE HON.

Mrs. Vereker, without answer, moved towards the door, and Farquhar gave her his arm. The carriage was waiting outside, the horses impatiently pawing the gravel. He handed her into it, and then, giving a very necessary shove to Vereker, with as impassive a countenance as he could manage considering the contempt that filled him, he drew back, the footman closed the door, and presently it was all over, save for the distant roll of the carriage wheels in the distance.
