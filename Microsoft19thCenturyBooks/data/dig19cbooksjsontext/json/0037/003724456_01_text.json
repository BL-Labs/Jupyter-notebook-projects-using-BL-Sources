The task which devolved upon me, when I had the honor to be called to the direc tion of the Light-house, &c, Service, has been lightened by the hearty co-operation of others. The Engineers of the maritime Departments have directed, with their habitual devotion, and with entire success, the works confided to them, which were sometimes attended with danger, aud often very difficult of execution ; and my asso ciates of the Central Service (the Engineers, Messrs. Degrand and Allard) have most usefully co-operated with me in studying new dispositions to be made of apparatus, and also in the numerous experiments which will be found recorded in this work. I must not omit to add, that the Administration of Public Works, appreciating fully the great importance aud usefulness of the aids to navigation on our coasts, in the double aspect, of the general interests of humanity, and of the development of the naval and commercial greatness of the nation, has always accorded its approbation to the recommendations of the Commission of Lights ; its encouragement in the prosecution of experimental researches and promising innovations ; and its assistance in carrying out the great undertaking embraced in the original plan of illumination, which is now nearly completed.

DISTRIBUTION OF LIGHTS. The entrances to ports and the mouths of navigable streams were for a long time regarded as the only places at which it was needful to establish lights for the benefit of the mariner, and the chief object aud effort then was to give as great a range as possible to the lights thus placed to mark those points. It is now, and has been for some time, quite different ; the requirements of navigation having become so much greater, it follows, as a necessary consequence, that they shoidd be more amply and fully met, and, in being more fully developed, the illumination of maritime coasts rests upon very different laws from what it formerly did, as it is now recognized that the greater number of the localities hitherto considered of primary importance need only be provided with lights of a secondary character, while the primary lights are assigned to positions where they will render better service to the mariner. As it is near the line of the seacoast that the most formidable and serious obstacles to navigation exist, it is, as a natural consequence, the coast line, above all, which shoidd be first pointed out to the approaching vessel. The line of the seacoast presents a series of capes, (headlands and deep indentations,) variously marked, which may be considered as the salient angles of a polygon, circumscribing all outlying rocks and reefs, and a light is now.placed to mark each of these, so that the mari ner is warned of danger at as great a distance from the land as the elevation of the light and the power of the illuminating apparatus will"], [14, "6 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. allow. The distances between the positions of these primary seacoast lights are so arranged with reference to their respective range that it is now impossible for any vessel to approach the coast within a reason able distance during clear weather without seeing at least one light to warn the master of danger. These lights, which have been established, essentially and primarily, to mark the approach to the coast line, are designated as seacoast or land-fall lights. They are of the first order and class, and have the greatest power and range. After having warned the mariner by the.se outlying lights, placed on the most salient points of the seacoast, of his proximate distance from the coast line and dangers, and given him a first instruction as to the course he should steer, it then becomes necessary that he should be provided with the means for safely steering to the place to which he is bound, and for that purpose recourse is had to lights of less power and range. In the sea space or indentation, of greater or less extent, and more or less open, embraced between two first-order seacoast lights, there are points, or secondary capes, islands, rocks, reefs, and sand banks, the positions of which it is the interest of the navigator to know; there are channels also whose direction it is both necessary and useful to mark for his safety, and these places are now marked by lights whose powers and ranges are regulated by the distances at which it is needful for them to be seen. These lights differ from those of the first order not only in intensity, but some of them illuminate only a small arc of the horizon, others larger arcs, and others again the entire horizon, accord ing to circumstances. Finally, the course for the vessel being thus carefully marked out, to near the port or anchorage which is to end the voyage, it suffices to place a small light on one or each of the banks, piers, or breakwaters, to point out the entrance. Many of these small lights belonging to tidal harbors are not exhibited until the tide has reached a certain determined height. The greater number of the harbors of this descrip tion are lighted by two lights, one employed as a tide light, and exhibited only at certain heights of the tide, while the other is kept as a perma nent light, to mark the locality and position at all times. During foggy or thick weather, when the ranges of the first order seacoast lights are greatly diminished in power and extent, the second ary lights come in and fill up the gaps in the primary illumination, and thus maintain its continuity, or at least diminish in a great degree the extent of those portions of the coast which are not lighted. The range (or distance at which they may be seen) assigned to first order lights varies from IS to 21 nautical miles,* according to their *lnanticalmileof 60 to the degree = 1,852 meters 2,025.4 yards, in round numbers. 1 meter = 39.371 inches = 1.094 yards. 1 kilometer = 39,371.0 inches = 1,093.6389 yards."], [15, "7 DISTRIBUTION OF LIGHTS. character. The other orders and classes of lights, being more diverse in character, have ranges varying from two to twenty miles. These latter lights are divided into three orders, according to the quantity of light emanating from the focus of the apparatus. Lights so greatly multiplied would expose the mariner to the risk of making fatal mistakes, were it not that ample means have been de vised for varying their characteristic distinctions in such a way as to render it easy to provide distinctions so that one may not be mistaken for another. Those means were not available when the light was neces sarily produced by the combustion of wood or of coal ; at least only to the extent of grouping several lights at or about the same point or locality, which would be extremely limited in practical utility, and would besides be attended with great annual expense. But the in vention and introduction of parabolic reflectors with double current of air (Argand) lamps, and the still later and much more valuable inven tions of Augttstin Fresnel, allow the characteristic distinctions to be varied as far as may be necessary or desirable, and increase enormously in proportion, at the same time, the powers and ranges of the lights. It is of the greatest importance that the lights of the first order, and those which, on some particular points, fulfil the necessary requirements of great seacoast or \"land-fair* lights, should be very marked in their characteristic distinctions, so that the mariner may be duly and unmis takably apprised of his true position, and enabled to rectify any errors of his \"reckoning\" before lie shall have approached the coast too near for safety, under all circumstances of weather. But it is not necessary that each light should have a particular or special characteristic distinction. It will be quite sufficient that the distances between those of the same characteristic distinction, on the same and adjacent coast, exceed any error of position which might result under ordinary circumstances of weather and navigation. To fix a limit to that error is doubtless by no means easy; nevertheless, the \"Commission des Phares\" determined that a navigator should not be more than SO miles in error of his true position, (out of his reckoning,) except in rare and extraordinary cases, and under such circumstances of weather and want of opportunity for accurate observations for latitude and time, he should be extremely cautious in approaching the land at night. Warned, however, of his approach to the land by seeing a light, if in doubt as to his position and the light seen, he should keep well off the land during the night, and until he satisfies himself of his position. It may be remarked, however, that a mistake which might be easily made when but one light is in sight, would not prevent its instant recognition when several lights are visible at the same time, of differ ent characteristic distinctions, numbers, and relative positions. Under such circumstances, shorter distances may sometimes be allowed than"], [16, "8 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. those already spoken of. For example, the first order fixed lights of the Isle of Groix and the Isle of Yen are only distant 72 miles from each other; but the first one cannot be seen on the same bearing as the second, without seeing at the same time either the fixed light varied by flashes on the Isle of Penfret, or the eclipse (revolving) light show ing a bright flash once in every minute on Belle-Isle-en-Mer, which will prevent the possibility of error on the part of the navigator. Analogous considerations allow the use of the same characteristic distinctions for the light at Oarteret, and the one on Cape Freliel, al though they are only forty-six miles apart. It is thus seen that the general principles upon which the illumina tion of the coasts of France are based may be summed up as follows: The approaches to the salient points of the coast line are marked by lights of the greatest power and range, sufficiently diversified by diffe rent characteristic distinctions to properly define their respective posi tions, and placed in such proximity to each other as to prevent the navigator from getting within the limit of outlying dangers during clear weather, before seeing at least one seacoast light to warn him of his approach to the land; and then the inshore illumination, by lights varied in appearance, and the ranges regulated by the distances at which it is necessary to see them in guiding safely into port. These principles were set forth and adopted for the first time in the report and programme presented to the \"Commission des Phares,\" by Admiral Rossel, and approved September 9, 1825. They have never been lost sight of, but it may be readily understood that it has not always been possible to apply them rigorously. A coast line of such great extent, and so broken and varied in its character, would not allow of any absolute plan being unexceptionally carried out. Thus, externally to the sides of the ideal polygon, of which the lights of the first class and order occupy the summits, an islet, the head of a rock, or a sand bank may exist, which it may be necessary to mark, and a light secondary in character may suffice to meet the require ments of the navigator. Thus, on our Channel coast, for example, the group of the Seven Isles is situated to seaward of the line which con nects the first order lights at the Heaux de Breliat and the Isle de Bas, and upon which a light of the third order is placed. A similar arrange ment obtains at the Isle Yierge, between the lights at the Isle de Bas aud Ouessant. Sometimes, too, the configuration of the coast line is such as not to permit the placing of two first order lights sufficiently near to each other for their arcs of illumination to cross, and in such cases the dark spaces left between the two first order lights are filled up by establish ing a secondary light. A case of this kind will be seen by referring to the lights of La Heve aud Barfleur, which are separated by a deep bay,"], [17, "CHARACTERISTIC DISTINCTIONS OF LIGHTS. 9 and which latter is lighted by a third order light exhibited from the point of Yer; also to the lights of Belle-Isle and Isle of Yen, between which the Fiber light is placed; to the lights of Agde and Faraman, the intervening space between which is lighted by the light at Aigues- Mortes. It may also happen that a light which does not occupy the position of seacoast or \"land-fall\" light, should, however, have the power and range of a first-order light. The light of Fatoiiville, at the mouth of the river Seine, furnishes such an example and illustration, the object for which it was established and the configuration of the coast line at that point rendering it necessary to place it at such a distance inland that a less powerful intensity, and a tower of less height, would have produced a light of an insufficient range for the purposes of navigation. And, lastly, when a cape whose position would seem to designate it as the proper- place for the establishment of a first class light, but not being well marked or very prominent, and having points on either side of it which it is necessary to have lighted, such, for example, as the entrances to ports possessing a certain degree of importance, it will be well to leave it unmarked by a light, and erect the seacoast or \"land fall\" light upon one or both of thqse minor points. For example, the Cape Antifer, which is situated between Fecamp and Havre, is not lighted, and the first order seacoast lights are placed on the heights which overlook the entrances to these ports. The low7 cape between Dunkerque and Gravelines, which has been treated in the same way, may be cited as another example. For the remainder of the lights, it will suffice to examine the chart, where the positions wdl be seen, and their characteristic distinctions compared, to judge how far the general principles have been applied to them, and what were the geographical requirements and circumstances which sometimes intervened to prevent their being strictly conformed to. II. CHARACTERISTIC DISTINCTIONS OF LIGHTS. The programme agreed upon by the Light Commission, (Commission des Phares,) in 1825, approved of only three different kinds or charac teristic distinctions of lights of the first order: 1. The fixed light ; 2. The revolving light, with eclipses succeeding each other once in every minute, (1' to 1\";) and, 3. The revolving light, with eclipses succeeding each other once in every half minute (30\" to 30\".) A fixed light was always to be placed between two revolving or"], [18, "10 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. eclipse lights having different intervals of time between the flashes and eclipses. Lights of the same characteristic distinction would thus be separated as much as was considered to be necessary; but experience has shown that navigators of merchant vessels do not always pay suffi cient attention to observing the differences of elapsed time between the flashes or eclipses of revolving lights which have been s] token of ; besides, the number of lights has necessarily been so greatly increased beyond the anticipations of those who prepared the report and pro gramme of 182.1, that it was found necessary to introduce a much larger number of characteristic distinctions than was originally de signed. One distinction, which may be said to belong to the infancy of the art, was adopted since the close of the last century for one of our most important seaports, that of Havre, and was continued exception ally at this point by the programme of 1825. It consists of the exhibi tion of two first-order fixed lights side by side, at such a distance apart as to prevent their rays from blending into one beam, within the limit of their range of visibility, and so as always to be seen as belonging to one light station, or group. This kind of characteristic distinction is, without doubt, objectionable, on account of the expense, which is nearly double that of a station with only one light, both for the original outlay for construction as wrell as for the annual maintenance and repair; but it has the merit of being very sharply and well defined, and is highly appreciated by naviga tors approaching that part of the coast. Many examples of this sort are found on the coasts of Great Britain. This distinction has been employed on the coast of France, within the last few years, in lighting the low, dangerous coast line in the vicinity of the mouth of the Canche, and also to that of the Gulf of Gascony, along the space comprised between the light of Cordouan and the basin of Arcachon. Another distinctive characteristic, which was at first reserved for apparatus of the second and third orders, has since been applied to lights of the first order, viz., the fixed light varied by successive flashes and partial eclipses once in every three minutes, (3' to 3',) and of once in every four minutes, (4' to 4',) that is to say, having sufficiently long intervals between the brilliant flashes to prevent the lights from being mistaken for the ordinary revolving or eclipse lights. This distinction has been selected for the lights at Calais, Isle de Sein, Porquerolles, Sanguinaires and Porto- Yecchio, in order to avoid mistaking these lights for others in the same vicinity. This may be reversed, to insure to an eclipse light another charac teristic distinction, not less marked ; that is to say, the rapidity with which the flashes succeed each other may be greatly increased. The \"Commission des Phares\" has adopted recently, for a first-order light to be placed on a point of great importance, and one at which"], [19, "CHARACTERISTIC DISTINCTIONS OF LIGHTS. 11 there should be no risk of confusion in the mind of the mariners in de termining its true character and position, an apparatus whose eclipses will not be separated longer that for one and a half second, and thus produce a kind of scintillation. This is denominated a scintillating light. No fixed light will be seen between the intervals of the flashes. Lastly, colored lights have been introduced to serve as characteristic distinctions. This mode of distinguishing lights was condemned at first in the most absolute manner ; and they certainly present inconve niences which ought to prevent their use, except very rarely, and then only with great reserve. One serious objection to the use of color in distinguishing lights is, that the coloring matter reduces, in great pro portion, the intensity of the light; and another is, that atmospheric conditions sometimes determine the color, Avhich may lead to mistakes as to the real color of the light. But it is now known, and has been acknowledged, that these phenomena are not of so grave a character as had been previously attributed to them; and the \"Commission des Phares,\" yielding to the solicitations of navigators, permitted at first the introduction of the red color as a means of distinguishing the lights of the smaller orders, aud afterwards introduced it even for distinguish ing lights of the first order. It also approved of the introduction of green as a distinction in some exceptional cases. The subject is one of too serious import not to have it seem necessary to make known the reasons upon which these decisions were based. There are only three colors which are sufficiently marked and defined to be united with white as a means of distinguishing lights \u2014 red, green, and blue. They are produced by passing the rays of light emanating from the lamp-burner through properly -colored glass, and the photo metric experiments made under ordinary circumstances, that is to say, at short distances, establish the fact that the tints sufficiently decided cause a loss of light which may reach even to 95 per cent. Bed is, of all colors, that which is the most distinct for an equal amount of ab sorption of the luminous rays ; and this is not its only comparative merit, considered in regard to maritime illumination, but it possesses another which is considerable, and has been proved bythe experiments which will be reported and discussed when the question as to the dis position of apparatus arises. With equal intensity, the red light will be seen farther than the white light. If two lights, one red and the other white, appear to be of about equal intensity, as estimated according to the usual photometric means and processes, the flash or brilliancy of the red light will be carried beyond that of the white when they are both observed at great distances, and that effect will be still more marked as the distance from them is increased. The white light will cease to be visible before the red light. This phenomenon is above all very marked in certain states of the atmosphere, which will be readily under-"], [20, "12 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. stood, since fog generally has the effect of changing the color of white light to red,* from which it should be concluded that it offers less obstruction to the transmission of the red than to the other rays of light. Ls The observations which have been made at the light of Pontaillac, at the mouth of the Gironde, may be cited in illustration of this subject. This apparatus is arranged so as to exhibit a light which is alternately red and white, without any intervening eclipse between these appear ances. Measured by the photometer, at about 8 meterst distance from the light, and at about 3 meterst distance from the instrument, the in tensities were estimated to be 1,100 burners of the carcel lamps for the white light, and about 700 burners tor the red light. When near the light the white light appeared more brilliant than the red, but farther off it appeared to be equal, and still farther yet, the red was sometimes seen better than the white light. It has also been affirmed by some navigators that during foggy weather the red flashes have been seen before the white ones were visible. The distances at which these phe nomena are produced vary with the state of the atmosphere. It is seen, then, that the loss of light caused by coloring it red is not so great as had been previously supposed from experiments made upon lights at short distances, and, above all, that the red light becomes much less rapidly impaired during the existence of the most ordinary fogs than the white light, that is to say, under those circumstances which make it highly important to have brilliant lights. The green and blue lights show, in this respect, the opposite of the red, as, indeed, might easily have been foreseen. They diminish in in tensity much more rapidly in proportion than the white as the distance increases, and still more so as the atmosphere becomes thicker. This subject will lie recurred to again. It is a recognized fact that different states of the atmosphere cause lights to appeal- to be of different colors. It has been observed that during foggy w7eather white lights become of a reddish color or tinge, green approach in color or become white, and blue lights are not visi ble, or change to so pale a violet tint as to be mistaken for white. These phenomena ought assuredly to be gravely considered, but they lose much of their intrinsic importance when, instead of a single isolated light, there are two lights of different colors, and especially when one of them is red and the other white. If the white light should have a * Some heavy fogs allow all the luminous rays to pass through them equally, and only have the effect of diminishing their intensity ; they dim the lights without color ing them. t 1 meter = 39.371 inches = 3 feet 3.371 inches. t The carcel burner is the unity of the measnre of light adopted iu the lighting service, as will be seen further on in this work."], [21, "13 CHARACTERISTIC DISTINCTIONS OF LIGHTS. red tinge, then the red one becomes more intensely red; and thus both preserve their distinctive characters. The effect, however, would not be the same if the. green were substituted for the red, they would still be distinguished, the one from the other, but instead of seeing white and green, they would appear to be red and white, without there being a very marked difference in color, and it would require an acuteness of sight which cannot be expected always to be found among observers to determine the true colors. The red color, therefore, appears to be superior from this point of view to any of the others. Such were the considerations which caused the introduction of color as a characteristic distinction in light-house illumination, and the adop tion of red almost exclusively for that purpose. They have equally determined the manner of using and the circumstances which will render the introduction of color advisable. Fed fixed lights have only been established at points where one or more fixed white lights are necessarily placed at the same time, in such a way as to render mistakes of color impossible. No colored fixed light of the first order has been established, as it is of primary importance that the over-sea voyager should not be led into error, or even have any hesitation in deciding as to the true characteristic of the first single light which he sees in approaching land. Fixed lights of short range are often colored red for the sake of distinc tion, when it is feared those of the natural color might be mistaken for those on the streets, in dwellings, or on wdiarves, &c. When piers or breakwaters of a port are distinguished by lights, one is habitually white and the other red. The same rule applies equally to range lights, where it is necessary to diversify them ; when their positions are such that the most distant may not always appear to the navigator above the other, one is always colored. Recourse is sometimes had to green, where there is danger of confusion from groups of lights in the vicinity. Bed is equally used for lights of the first order when they are not fixed. It is very evident that there can be no inconvenience in color ing lights by means of flashes varied in the manner afready spoken of, when these flashes are not required to increase the power and range of the light, but merely to give the station a distinctive character. In stead of varying a fixed white light at intervals of three or four minutes by a period of much greater luminous intensity, it may be varied by changes to red. Color is substituted for the flash, and it ahvays pre serves its distinctive characteristic, for the reason that white immedi ately succeeds it. A similar disposition has been made for revolving or eclipse bghts. The flashes of these lights are colored, some red and others white ;"], [22, "14 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. sometimes they alternate, and sometimes a red flash is succeeded by twro white flashes. It will be seen, further on, that the apparatus is then arranged in such a way as to receive more of the luminous rays upon the colored panels than upon the others. Finally, a new characteristic, based upon the intervention of two colors, has been recently adopted for a light of the third order which.was not required to be seen at a great distance, and might lead to mistakes, if it had not been very decidedly and sharply distinguished from its immediate neighbors. This light is white, and becomes alternately red and green for some seconds, without there being intervening eclipses between the diverse luminous apparitions. When there is fog, the green flash will be reduced, in proportion more or less marked, and it may also become an eclipse at a certain distance ; but navigators are not ignorant of the effects such a state of the atmosphere produces, and will always recognize the light as distinctively characterized. Some apparatus, similar as to their general disposition, only vary the white light by red flashes. Thus, in the actual state of the lighting service of France, the first class seacoast lights have nine different distinctive characteristics: WHITE LIGHTS. 1. Fixed light. 2. Eclipse light, once in every minute. 3. Eclipse light, once in every half minute, 4. Scintillating light. 5. Fixed light, varied by flashes. 6. Two fixed lights. COLORED LIGHTS 7. Fixed white light, varied by red flashes. 8. Eclipse light, with alternate red and white flashes. 9. Eclipse light, with two white flashes succeeded by a red flash. It would be easy to obtain a greater number of characteristic dis- tinctions by means of other combinations of the same elements, but, so far, there has been no necessity for them. The same appearances, and others besides, such as the fixed red before referred to, the red eclipse light, and the alternate white and red with or without eclipses, the alternate white, red, white and green, are adapted to apparatus of the second and third orders. As to lights of the fourth order, they are mostly fixed, and are distinguished by either position or color. They are not generally dis tinguished by eclipses, for the reason that the navigator is too near to the shore at the time when they are required to serve as his guides to"], [23, "15 RANGES OF THE LIGHTS. allow of their ever being lost sight of. The arrangements which pro duce the different characters of lights will be pointed out when the subject of illuminating apparatus is reached. III. RANGES OF THE LIGHTS. The distance at which a light may be seen depends upon its inten sity and upon its height above the level of the sea. There is, then, to be considered, the luminous range and the geographical range. The considerations upon which these valuations are based will be examined in the order of succession. LUMINOUS RANGES. The power of illuminating apparatus is determined by means of pho tometric measurements, and the unity of measure adopted in experi ments is the light of a carcel lamp, whose burner has a diameter of two hundredths of a meter, (0.02\u00ab/.,) and consumes forty grammes (4(1) of colza oil per hour. If the lights transmitted their rays or beams through a vacuum, the ranges would be in proportion to the square roots of the intensities. and it would be sufficient to know the distance at which a light of a known power may be seen by a person endowed with ordinary vision to determine the range of a light of a different intensity. Thus, in admitting that the light produced by a carcel lamp may be seen at the distance of 10 kilometers, it woidd be concluded that a fixed light of the first order, the intensity of which is equivalent to (530 carcel burn ers, ought to have a range of 251 kilometers*, and that the maximum brilliancy of the flash of an apparatus of the same order of eclipses once in every minute, which is equal to 5, 075 carcel burners, should be 712 kilometers.* But the atmosphere is not a transparent body; on the contrary, it is more or less opaque, which has the effect, concurrently with the dis tance, of weakening the luminous rays ; and its action varies between extreme limits. There are some intensely dense fogs that arrest our most powerful lights at the distance of only a few meters. The ranges are then less than those which would be deduced from the law7 of which we have just spoken, and they depend upon the state of the atmosphere. It is evident, besides, that they also depend upon the clearness and acuteness of vision of the observer. Elements so variable and difficult to accurately estimate, do not admit of our obtaining great accuracy of calculated results to express the ranges, nor of according to them much confidence, and yet there is inducement, even in a practical point of view, to study the question, and subject it to calculation. * 1 kilometer = 39,371 inches = 1,093.6389 yards."], [24, "16 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. I Let L be the luminous intensity of an illuminating apparatus, or the quantity of light sent upon the unity of surface to the unity of dis tance, the quantity of light which comes from the carcel lamp already spoken of being taken for unity; a the fraction of received light which can pass through a stratum of atmosphere whose thickness is equal to the unity of distance; '>\u25a0 the smallest quantity of light, at the unity of distance, which the observer can see in an atmosphere whose transparency is complete; x the range of the illuminating apparatus. We should then have \u2014 - = ', if the transmission of light were x 2 L a x through a vacuum, and \u2014 , 2 \u2014 = I, if it were transmitted through the atmosphere. It belongs to experiments to determine and make known the values to be given to the coefficients a and '. Bouguer has made observations upon the quantity of light which comes from a full moon at different elevations, to determine the diminu tion caused by a serene atmosphere, aud the results found led him to assign to a the value of 0.973, the kilometer being the unity of distance. A series of experiments have been undertaken by the engineers of the service, (Commission des Phares,) to determine the values which belong to that coefficient during a more or less foggy atmosphere, and to determine that which should be given to /. They have consisted of observations, under diverse atmospheric circumstances, ot lights of dif ferent intensities, and differently defined, and to measure the distances at which they ceased to be visible to an observer possessing ordinarily good sight. The illuminating apparatus was placed in front of the windows of the central lighting establishment, and the observations made from the Champ de Mars. They employed, in succession, different apparatus, and a lamp or candle, in front of which were placed a certain number of panes of glass, which absorbed a greater or less quan tity of light, which had been previously ascertained.

The points of construction are enclosed by small circles, and each of the lines carries the number assigned in the preceding table of the experiments, which express the conclusions. There is, without doubt, something a little arbitrary in the tracing of these lines'; there are some drawm in the direction which had been given to them. The observations lead rather beyond what the precise figures show, and that could hardly lie otherwise, as well on account of the variations of the luminous intensity of the lights (foci) as in regard to the indecision which exists when it becomes necessary to fix a limit to the visibility. However, it is seen that the different lines deflect sufficiently little from the points where they should have been found in their course, if the experiments were made with rigorous exactness, and that they all unite in the same point of the axis of the ordi nates. The height of this point of concurrence gives the value, log ;. = \u2014 2.00 from whence i =0.010. The circumstances under which the observations were made would seem to establish the fact that this value of /\u2022 may be admitted in prac tice without the risk of errors. There were always three, and sometimes four, observers, and all wore spectacles but two. A mechanician em ployed in the operations, and possessing an excellent vision, continued constantly to observe the lights at the times when the observers were agreed that they had disappeared. Finally, some gas lamps were lighted upon the perimeter of the Champ de Mars, and even near the lights under observation, for experiment, aud the contrast, as well as the fatigue of the eyes which observed without cessation the lights, more or less intense, must have injured the delicacy of their perception. The same persons could have seen the lights at a greater distance, and found consequently a smaller value for *, if they had observed them in a space not illuminated by street lamps, or with visual organs in greater repose or less fatigued. The preceding results have been verified by observations made at many of our light-houses. These observations certainly do not allow the assignment of a value to the coefficient under consideration, for the reason that the degree of transparency of the atmosphere at the mo ment when the proceeding takes place is ignored, but they suffice to establish the fact that the figures 0.010 may not be regarded as a minimum."], [28, "20 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. The following table is a recapitulation of some of them : The first column shows the place of observation ; the second, the name of the light; the third, the intensity of the light; the fourth, the dis tance at which it is sometimes seen; the fifth, assigns a high limit to the value of '\u25a0, in the double hypothesis that the coefficient of trans parency of atmosphere had, at the moment of the observations, the value of 0.973 which Bouguer assigned to it, and that it was equal to unity; that is to say, that a complete transparency of atmosphere ex isted at the time the observations were made. It has been calculated from the formula given above \u2014 x 2 It is seen that, if the coefficient of Bouguer be adopted, all these ob servations, except the last, give the figures notably lower than 0.010, and that one of them brings A below 0.007, when it was at the same time admitted that the atmosphere was perfectly transparent. It is also to be observed, that these figures are the maxima, as the lights were in sight, and some of them reported as very brilliant at the moment the observations were recorded. The observations made upon the light of the Isle Harbour took place during the months of December, 1860, and January and February, 1861, establishing the tact that the light was seen during forty-five nights, and that it was found very brilliant twen ty-one times. The light of Nouvelle, which gives the lowest figure, has not been seen, on the other hand, but fourteen times in nine years, but it is but just to add that the keepers of the light of Agde never observed it but from the interior of their lantern, and did not attach any great importance to having discovered it. Besides, this figure is, under every hypothesis, below7 that which we have admitted. This being stated, let us return to the study of the result of the ex periments made, in the Champ de Mars.

But some of these expressions of a show, that if the' means adopted to define the degree of transparency of the atmosphere is irreproachable, in a purely scientific point of view-, it leaves much to be desired in prac tice, on account of the number of figures or of the form which it exacts during the prevalence of dense fogs. Thus, log a has 9 for its charac teristic on the 23d of January, and more than 200 on the 29th of the \u2022same month. And, on the other hand, it should not be forgotten, that the coefficient ft does not represent sufficiently to the mind the atmos pheric circumstances of which it gives a rigorous definition. But all these inconveniences will disappear, if the degree of trans parency of the atmosphere is expressed by the range of the unity of bght to the unity of distance, for an observer of ordinary vision, which is represented by the ?\u2022 = 0.010 with the kilometer for unity. The value of this new7 coefficient will be deduced from the formula \u2014 \u00ab p = 0.010 j)2, which gives p = 10.00 for ft = 1, that is to say, in the case of a com pletely transparent atmosphere, and p = 8.859 for a = 0.973, the co efficient assigned by Bouguer. From the experiment made on the 29th January it may be concluded that p = 0.025, the 23d of the same month the mean value of p has passed from 0.329 to 0.309. ft r The relation L .,- =' shows how the ranges varv with the lunii- x 2 nous intensities of the focus and the degree of transparency of the atmosphere, ami it becomes very expressive in a graphic interpreta tion. The curves of Plate 2 correspond each to a determined value of \u00ab and of p. Those of Figure 1 have been traced in carrying the luminous intensities upon the axis of the abscissa? to the scale of 0.005w*. for 1,000 burners, and the ranges upon the axis of the ordi nates to the scale of 0.02 m. for 100 kilometers. The Figure 2 is exe cuted upon a larger scale, to the tenthfold; it is only an amplification of the .square comprised between the dotted lines upon the Figure 1, but it gives a larger number of curves. The upper curve in each figure belongs to a = 1; it is a parabola. The last curve of Figure 2 belongs to au atmosphere the coefficient of whose transparency will be equal to 0.00000625, that is to say, in which the light of unity will not reach farther than 500 meters. It will be seen immediately, by an inspection of the figures, and espe cially of the first, in what very great proportion the luminous ranges"], [30, "22 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. are reduced by the defect of atmospheric transparency, however little marked it may be. When there is sufficient fog to prevent a carcel lamp from being seen at a greater distance than 1,000 meters, there is not a sensible difference in the graphic expression between the range of a light equivalent to 4,000 burners and that of a light five times more intense. , The calculation gives 2.42km. in the first case, and 2.12km. in the second. The range of a light of 4,000 burners, wiiich will be 632 kilometers in a vacuum, becomes reduced to 98 in an atmosphere of 0.902, and falls to 16 when this coefficient descends to 0.632, wiiich is not rare, inasmuch as the unity light is seen then at 4,000 .meters distance. It is not more than 1.07km., when that last distance is reduced to 500 meters. It is seen, also, that the curves approach each other much more rapidly from a parallel to the axis of the absciss\u00e6, as the value of a is smaller, and it may be concluded from that, that within a certain limit, there is no very great necessity for increasing the intensity of the focus. This last order of considerations is very important, and it may be remarked in regard to it that it is outside of all hypothesis. An alto gether different value for i. might be adopted, as the conclusion will be the same. The equation of the ranges is not one of easy application, in that it requires long calculations for determining x, which is the value which it is usually proposed to obtain; but it may be replaced by the graphic constructions, from which will be immediately obtained the solutions sought, with all the rigorous correctness which is practically required; and even the curves which the reader has before his eyes give indica cations which will appear to be sufficient in the greater number of cir cumstances and cases. It is doubtless unnecessary to insist further upon this subject, and we will proceed to examine now how the points which have just been established allow the fixing of the luminous ranges to be assigned to the apparatus of the different orders. They cannot be determined in an absolute manner; they are necessa rily the function of a certain state of the atmosphere. To take the co efficient 0.973 of Bouguer, would not do for habitual circumstances; to descend to a very low7 figure wonld be to remove it outside of the limits which actually exist, and would give a false idea of the power of our maritime illumination. There would be no advantage in taking this last position, for navigators know7 full well that they cannot count upon the admitted ranges when the atmosphere is foggy. We have stopped at the figure 0.903, which corresponds to the range of 7 kilometers of the light of unity, and which appears to represent a mean state of the atmosphere in our climates."], [31, "23 RANGES OF THE LIGHTS. INTENSITIES AND LUMINOUS RANGES. The table which follows shows the luminous intensities upon which it is allowed to count in practice, and the corresponding ranges in three states of the atmosphere, which are defined by the expressions \u00ab, = 0.966, \u00ab = 0.903, and ft = 747. From the observations made at our lights, it seems to be established, that along the whole of our seacoast the mean transparency of the atmosphere is greater during one month than is indicated by the first of these figures, dining six months than is indicated by the second, and during eleven months than is indicated by the last. In the last column of the table are inserted the ampli tudes, at the moment of emerging from the apparatus, of the flashes of the eclipse lights, and of those which illuminate only a part of the horizon. Only white lights are considered, and it will be found further on in what proportion it will be proper to reduce the figures of the intensities to apply them to colored lights."], [32, "24 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS, TABLE OF INTENSITIES AND LUMINOUS RANGES.

The ranges assigned to these lights are those of the principal fixed light."], [36, "28 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. Plate 1 represents in a very striking manner the luminous intensities of our principal illuminating apparatus, and the corresponding ranges, in an atmosphere in a mean state, that which gives to the light of unity a range of 7 kilometers. The drawings which form the lower series of figures show the general dispositions of the apparatus and the direc tions they give to the luminous rays. The curves of the upper series represent the intensities; they have the durations of the luminous appearances for absciss\u00e6 to the scale of 0.03m. per minute, and the intensities for ordinates to the scale of 0.004wi. per one hundred burn ers. The figures relating to the ranges occupy the intermediate spaces; they are drawn to the scale of 0.001 per nautical mile, or of 0.00054\u00bbt. per kilometer. It has been sought to render an account, in these last figures, of the variation of the luminous intensity, which is not the same in the whole illuminated zone.* On the inspection of that figure, the reader will doubtless be much more impressed than he has been by the preceding calculations, or even by the curves of Plate 2, with the small augmentation of range which corresponds to a marked increase of intensity after it reaches a certain limit. GEOGRAPHICAL RANGES. The distance at which a light-house may be seen is limited more pre cisely by the spheroidal form of the earth than by the intensity of the light at the burner or focus. The geographical range depends upon the height of the light above the level of the sea, upon the radius of Fig. 2, * The conception of this last mode of representation belongs to Mr. Bollard, the Engineer-in-chief, and they have been executed under his direction."], [37, "29 RANGES OF THE LIGHTS. curvature of that part of the earth's surface at which it is placed, and upon the value of the atmospheric refraction. The luminous rays which traverse the atmosphere come in contact with strata of air whose density diminishes in proportion to their eleva tion ; they meet successive refractions, and describe, consequently, curves, when they are not directed normally to the surface of the earth. These curves are concave below, and the refraction has the effect of increasing the ranges, as is shown by Figure 2. Let A B be the surface of the sea, F the focal point, P F its height, F n m the curve, which is tangent to the surface of the sea at m, F r the tangent from the point F. The geographical range will be equal to I' m, whilst it would have only P r for its value, if there had been no refraction. The luminous ray, which, departing from the point F, directed tangentially to the surface, makes, with the horizontal line traced in the same plane, an angle a, which is less than the angle <p of the tangent F r with the same line. The atmospheric refraction is not constant, but in questions of that kind a mean value may be readily admitted, and deduce the ranges from the formula D = / RH V 0.42 in which H is the height above the level of the high water, and li the radius of curvature of the surface. For this last coefficient the value E = 6366953m. has been adopted. This represents the radius of cur vature of the meridian at the latitude of 45\u00b0 11', which may be con sidered as the mean for the lights on our seacoasts. The results deduced from that formula give the geographical ranges, in supposing that the eye of the observer is placed at the level of the sea. If it were elevated to a height h above that surface, it would ex tend the tangent point, without losing sight of the light, until at a distance equal to / R \\ \u25a0 The general formula for ranges is, then, V 0.42 p _ / R H , / R h ~ V 0.42 \"+~ V 0.42 There is another element which belongs to the same question, and which is very necessary to be taken into consideration in establishing illuminating apparatus ; it is the angle, a, which the tangent to the curve at the point, F, forms with the horizon, since that is the direction in which the most intense luminous beam should be directed. This subject will be returned to when the question of the disposition of the apparatus comes up.

All of our lights are not plaeed on a sufficiently great elevation to be seen as far as the limit of the ranges assigned to them by an observer from the deck of a vessel, and the numbers of tins table, or, in their default, the formula from which they have been derived, allows the recognition of the point at which it is necessary to be elevated above the level of the sea to observe at the horizon a light whose position is known with reference to the same plane. Navigators may thus judge approximately at what distance they are from a light at the moment it appears to come up out of the sea. The heights of the light-houses being given in the lists and nautical books, with reference to the level of the highest water,* it will become necessary, in order to proceed with exactness, to add to the height of the lighthouse seen the difference between that level and that of the sea at the moment the observation is made. Thus, let us suppose it shoidd be necessary to have an elevation of 1- meters above the level of the sea to see a light whose height is 42 meters emerge, and that, at the moment of observation, the level of the water is 3 meters below that of the highest tides, it will be found from the table that the distance is 21.39 miles from the foot of the tower. This is certainly not a method of rigorous exactitude, but it will be readi ly seen that approximate results are quite admissible in such a matter. IV.\u2014 RELATIVE POSITIONS OF MULTIPLE LIGHTS. The association of lights together at any one station has two dis tinct objects \u2014 either to produce a very marked characteristic distinc tion, or to serve as a range line to avoid dangers. In the first case,. the distance between the lights to be observed from a distance should be such as to prevent their being blended into or supposed to be one Ught at any distance within the limits of their range ; in the second, they must be so arranged that the navigator will always see them separated, aud perceive the moment he departs from the straight range line they are placed to mark ; that is to say, to enable him to discover any departure from that line before he runs into those dangers which these lights are placed to guide clear of. The elements of the question are limited to the phenomena of the irradiation, when it is simply proposed to obtain a distinctive character; but when it becomes a question of range lights, it will be necessary, besides, to make the range line so direct that it may be caught by a glance of the observer, or, in other words, the value of the angle which ought to make in horizontal projection two luminous points situated at different heights, so that men who are little accustomed to forming estimates of the kind may see at once that these luminous points are * The light-house list of the United States gives the heights to mean low tide.\u2014 T.

It is known that the amplitude of the irradiation depends upon three things \u2014 the luminous intensity of the object, the darkness of the back ground upon which it is projected, and the degree of shortsightedness of the observer. It increases with each of them. EFFECTS OF SHORTSIGHTEDNESS. In order to illustrate this last point more definitely, we will cite the fol- lowing experiments made upon the gas lamps of the city of Paris, by four persons of different powers of vision. These lights, placed on two sides of a bridge, were observed from one of the adjacent quays, which extended in a right line. The observers withdrew from the bridge and marked the points where the luminous halos, which to their eyes encir cled two lamps opposite to each other, appeared to them tangent, yet leaving the lights .perfectly distinct to their vision. Three of these observers were shortsighted, and the numbers of the glasses required by them were No. 8 for the first, No. 11 for the second, and No. 16 for the third. They did not on this occasion use glasses. The fourth had excellent sight. The distances at which the lights were observed varied from 95 to 626 meters; the night was, dark, the atmos pliere very clear, and distance does not seem (between these limits) to have had any appreciable influence upon the phenomenon. Each per son made several observations, agreeing- within a few minutes. The mean results of the observations gave the following for the size of the apparent irradiations: 1st observer 1\u00b0 12' 15\" 2d observer 1 7 22 3d observer 57 7 4th observer 12 0 It is thus seen how important it is that near-sighted persons should not be employed as pilots.* The more important experiments which follow were made by persons who had good sight, or wTore spectacles to assure it. Two men who possessed remarkably acute sight took part in the work, but did not think proper to submit their observations, because they were considered as belonging to exceptional organizations. They only served to estab lish the fact that the other observers were within the ordinary condi- tions found in practice. * It is to be remarked that spectacles, which so well assist that infirmity under ordinary circumstances, are but an insufficient palliative at sea, where the glasses soon become covered with moisture, or with crystals of salt, and thus lose their clearness. L 3"], [42, "34 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. ANGLES OF BLENDING OF THE LIGHTS. The first trial was to determine the smallest angle under which two lights ought to.be seen to appear markedly distinct. Trial was made in succession with carcel lamps, apparatus of 0.30;/;. diameter, parabolic refleetors of 0.29w. of opening, lenses of fixed light apparatus of the first order, and with large annular lenses of the same class. The observers, to the number of three, placed themselves at different distances from the lights, and indicated, by means of signals previously agreed upon, the direction in which the illuminating appa ratus placed upon a horizontal track should be moved. They always agreed in their estimations. The night was dark, and the atmosphere clear. The following table will show the results obtained : | r* LUMINOUS INTENSITY. \"3 3 31 V. _ \u0153 _, .

It is seen that, excepting some slight anomalies, inherent in experi ments of this sort, the irradiation augments, not with the power of the focus, but with the luminous intensity, by unity of surface of the illu- minating body. If the luminous intensities decreased in proportion to the square of the distance, the amplitude of the irradiation would be the same what ever might be the distance of the observer. But it is not so. The decrease is more rapid, and the irradiation diminishes with the distance in a proportion just so much greater as the atmosphere diminishes in clearness, except, however, during rain and thick fog, as has been established by observations, of which we will hereafter speak. It fol lows that the figures deduced from experiments which have not gone beyond 2,750 meters may be considered as maxima, with the benefit of that reservation, and to be regulated by them, would be making a quite prudent allowance. Nevertheless, the Lighting Service judged that it would be well to go further, and not wishing to enter into details which could not be easily reconciled with the exigencies of practice, and which would be of too absolute a character, it has fixed the fol lowing as the least angle which two lights ought to make in order to appear sufficiently distinct : For beacons 8' For lights of the three largest orders 15' INFLUENCE OF THE STATE OF THE ATMOSPHERE. Observations made from the sea upon multiple lights, and in different circumstances, established the fact that there need be no fear of mis take in relying upon these figures. They have shown, besides, that fog and rain exert upon the phenomena under discussion au influence which may be easily conceived, but which had not been well estab lished. Although the lights lose part of their brilliancy in these states of the atmosphere, yet their irradiation appears to augment in a cer tain proportion. This may be attributed to the fact that those drops of rain or vecicles of fog nearest to the light are illuminated with sufficient vividness to send luminous rays to the observer, and increase in that way the dimensions of the illuminating body. Still, that irra diation does not exceed the limits which have just been stated. Thus, the two tide-lights of the port of Boulogne, which are elevated three meters one above the other, have been distinguished at a distance of two miles iu clear weather, and were blended at less than one and a half mile during a fog. They were seen, in the first case, under an angle of 2' 17\", and in the second under an angle of 3' 43\". These observations were made by a pilot who had good sight, as is proved by the small value of the angles under which the vision was distinct. Thus, again, the two fixed lights of the first order, at the mouth of"], [44, "36 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. the Canche, are seen from the light at Alpreck, under an angle of 4' 10\", at a distance of eleven and a half miles, and they appear distinct or blended according to the state of the atmosphere. In 1,029 observations made during a course of one year, the lights were visible 206 times during fog, but they appeared distinct only 94 times, being 4G per cent ; during rain they were seen 63 times, but appeared distinct but 14 times, being 22 per cent ; during clear or clouded sky, without rain or apparent fog, they were seen 533 times, and remained distinct 409 times, being 77 per cent. MULTIPLE LIGHTS. These figures of 8' for beacon-lights, and of 15' for lighthouses, being admitted, the solution of the problem of the establishment of multiple lights, with the view to constitute a distinctive characteristic, is very simple, especially when the simplifications which practice permits are introduced in the data. Let M X (Fig. 3) be the portion of the shore line which it is designed to light, O the centre of the line which will join the two lights, the arc of the circle X Y Z the limit of the range of these lights, (arc described from the point O, and which may be substituted without sensible error for the near identical arcs drawn from each light as centres,) VOW the angle embracing all the directions iu which a navigator has interest to recognize the character of the illumination of the point O, that is to say, where he may find himself in the presence of these lights before having seen any other. The line joining the lights ought to be per pendicular to the line bisecting the angle V O W, and, if we call x the distance A B of the two lights, p the line O V or the range, \u00ab the angle vow V O Y = > we will be able to lay down sin 4' x = 2 \u00bb \u2014 \u2014 j 1 COS a if it relates to simple beacon-lights, and sin 7' 30\" x = 2 p , 1 COS a if more powerful lights constitute the illumination. Fig. 3."], [45, "37 RELATIVE POSITIONS OF MULTIPLE LIGHTS. When there is no objection, we usually give to x a higher value than these relations indicate, Thus, for the light-house of the first-order at the mouth of the Caliche,;? = 37,000m:, a cannot have a valuation greater than 45\u00b0, we find, according to the formula, x = 228,31m., and the intervening space has been fixed at 250 meters. The disposition of which we have just spoken admits implicitly that lights can only preserve their distinctive character in an angular space much less than 180\u00b0. Such is the condition of all of those of this de scription which have been established on the coasts of France. It allows the same elevation to be given to each of the lights belonging to the same group or station, and it is easy to see that there is a double advantage in this regard; there is economy in the expense of construc tion, for two heights would require to be separately regulated to suit the required range, besides, two lights of different elevations are liable to be differently affected by fog, and the navigator might then believe that oue of them was much farther oft' than the other, and deceive him self in regard to the character of the illumination. But, if the group of lights ought to be seen in a horizon of 180\u00b0 and beyond, it will become necessary to construct the light-houses of differ ent heights, and to place them in another direction, so that the lower may never be screened or obscured by the other. The line which joins them ought to divide the space to be illuminated into about equal parts, and the difference in height should be determined theoretically, according to the condition that the two lights should uot be seen from any of the points where they should appear distinct, under a less angle than 8' if they are small lights, and of 15' if they are light-houses. But it is easy to judge that, on account of their great range, it is almost impossible to satisfy this last condition when applied to apparatus of the two larger orders. Even if we admit that the lights would appear sufficiently distinct under an angle of 12', a difference of 100 meters in the heights would not prevent confusion beyond a distance of about 15 miles. The problem is hardly ever susceptible of a practical solution when the angle a approaches 90\u00b0, or goes beyond that term ; the lights then blend into one, in a part more or less extended of the maritime horizon. RANGE LIGHTS. There are many range lights on our channel and ocean coasts, where there are numerous narrow passages. There is a small number only in the Mediterranean. The power of these lights varies with the local circumstances. The light at Fatouville, which has already been spoken of, is of the first order, and is associated with a light of the third order upon the pier of the hospital at Hontieur, to guide navigators clear of the Easier"], [46, "38 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. Bank, which is distant nearly ten miles. The entrance to the harbor of Brest is marked by the lights of Portzic and of Petit-Minou, the one of the second aud the other of the third order. The range line of the main channel of the mouth of the Loire is marked by two lights of the third order, the Commerce and the Aiguillon. But almost everywhere else lights of the fourth order are called into requisition for this kind of service, for the reason that the distance at which they are required to be seen does not exceed their range. Many experiments have been made with the purpose of determining the minimum of the angle which two lights seen one above the other should make in a horizontal projection, so that it may be judged im mediately that they are not placed upon one and the same vertical. The question is no longer one of physics; it rests upon observations of another order, and great anomalies were expected in the results. But they have been generally very few; the agreement has even been re markable, and allows us to treat the subject with a precision of which it did not appear to be susceptible. We will limit ourselves to the cita tion of one of these experiments. The lights were from small apparatus of mould-glass, whose intensities were estimated to be equal to six carcel burners. The vertical distance which separated them could be varied, and the lower light was movable on a horizontal rail perpen dicular to the line joining the upper light to the station of observation. This station was 772 meters distant from the lights. The observers were three in number, and after having placed the lower light on the same vertical line with the other, it was moved 10 centimeters at a time, until it was so clearly shown to be out of that line that there could be no possible indecision, even among persons httle versed in such matters. The table which follows shows the tacts observed : It is seen that the separation measured in horizontal projection increases in proportion as the vertical distance is greater, but that nevertheless, the angle formed with the vertical by the line joining the two lights diminishes at the same time. The results deduced from the observations may be represented bv a VERTICAL DISTANCE. Linear. Angular. HORIZONTAL DIVERSION. Linear. Angular.

In taking for ordinates the vertical angular distances, and for abscissae the horizontal angular distances, we obtain a series of points belonging to a regular curve, leaving out of account the two anomalies of which we have just spoken, which, however, are not very marked. The lower light being placed at A, the origin of the coordinates, the successive positions of the upper light may be represented in the lim its of the observation by an arc of a parabola of the third degree, A n p, wilich will have for equation y = 1. 88 x + 0.0054 a.H. Fig. 4. But it is to be re marked, that two lights would blend near the origin, and that that curve ought not to be admitted, except at a distance of 8' from the point A, if the lights are of weak or little in tensity, and of 15' if we consider lights of the three larger orders, these angles being those which are regarded as the smallest under which the lights are well denned, as ha sheen previously said. The geometrical place for the position of the up per light is then deter mine d by the arc of the parabola n p and by the"], [48, "40 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. arc of the circle n o in, in the first case, and by the curve ri p and the arc ri o' m', in the second. The calculation of the value of x appears rather long for practical operations, and it has been thought best to substitute for the parabola a right line, which approaches very near the middle part, and has for equation y = 4 (./\u2022 - 4'.) This light passes through one of the points of observation, and leaves all the others nearer to the vertical. The solutions which it gives are, then, more favorable to the interests of navigators than those of the parabola. It is indicated upon the figure by the letters B C. The points marked 1, 2, 3, and 4 upon the same rij;-ure belong to a series of observations made with parabolic reflectors. The curve which may be deduced from it supposes a little more of correctness in the view taken by the observer than the preceding one admits of; that last is that which exacts the most angular space between the two lights. It is much better that the heights of two lights for a range be regu lated in such a manner so that the one farthest off is never exposed to the risk of being masked to the eyes of the navigator by the construc tion which supports the other. But it is not always possible to fulfil that condition, and it is then essential that the limits of occultation should be sufficiently distant from those of the channel that one may be assured of being in good water even when one light only is seen, and that there is time to return when the second is clearly shown. If the passage is very contracted, a moment of inattention, an acci dental occultation of the more distant light, or a momentary extinction, might cause serious consequences, and it would be prudent not to light a passage in a case where it will be impossible to place the lights in such a position that they would be always simultaneously in sight. We proceed by way of false position in the studies relative to the sites to be assigned to two lights to serve as a range. The site A of the lower light is usually determined by local circumstances, and to the higher one is assigned the position which at first appears most suitable. Examination is then made to ascertain if this last-named light can not, without entailing too great expense, be established at such an elevation above the other that it may be seen through the entire length of the channel or passage. If this cannot be arranged, and if no other point appears to fulfil that condition, care is then taken that the angle of occultation m B n shall not exceed the wished for limits. Finally, it is sought to ascertain whether, at each of the points where the navigator ought to avoid a danger, a value will be found for x. (that is to say, for the anjde which the two lights will make in hori-"], [49, "RELATIVE POSITIONS OF .MULTIPLE LIGHTS. 41 Fig. 5. zontal projection,) at least equal to that which is deduced from the formula y = 4 (x - 4',) without the real angle ever being inferior to 8' or 15', according to the intensities. The same characteristic distinction maybe assigned to both of the lights, when their heights are such that the most distant one will be seen above the other throughout the entire length of the channel to be lighted. But when that is not so, it will be proper to have their appearances different, as has already been said, so that the navigator may discover at once in what direction he should steer to place himself upon the line to follow. A fixed light may be associated with a fixed light varied by Hashes, or a fixed white with a fixed red light, and the upper or higher light should have morepower, in proportion as it is sepa rated from the othei. by a greater distance. In such cases, long eclipse lights are not employed, for the reason that both lights should always be in sight in the channel, or at least that one of them should dis appear only at rare and short intervals. The two range lights for the channel of the Sables d'Olonne, for example, are both fixed white, because that of Chaume is seen above the other throughout the whole extent of the channel. The lights of St. George and of the sand hills of Suzac, which beacon the entrance to the Gironde, are in an analogous position, and are both fixed, but they have been colored red to distinguish them from the numerous light houses lighted in the same navigable waters. The entrance to the port of Brest is lighted by the fixed white light of the Petit-Miuou (third order) and by the light varied by flashes on the point of Portzic, (second order,) and that distinction in the characters and in the ranges has been judged necessary, for the reason that the latter appears below the other when they are seen at a short distance, and is separated from it by a space of 6,400 meters. It frequently happens that it is only necessary to illuminate a very small arc by one light. The navigator then has but a single light in sight in the greater portion of the sea horizou, but it makes known to him, before he approaches the channel, the course which he should steer to enable him to see the second one before encountering dangers. This circumstance is availed of to diversify the distinctive character istics or the ranges without an unnecessary augmentation of expense."], [50, "42 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. When the distance at which the lights ought to be seen does not exceed a few miles, a small catadioptric apparatus of the fourth order is used to illuminate the entire horizon, aud a parabolic reflector of 0.29wi. of opening for the one required to light the small arc. When one of the two ought to be colored, it is to the latter that the application is made, because, more intense than the former, without requiring to be of greater range, it may be deprived of a part of its brilliancy without inconve nience. The value of the first varies from nine to eighteen burners, and that of the latter is reduced by the color to about the same rate. If the distance which separates the lights is considerable, and if, as often happens, the catoptric apparatus is the farthest from the channel, it will be necessary either to have recourse to a longer reflector, so as to augment the brilliancy by a greater concentration of the luminous rays, to place two or three in juxtaposition, or, finally, to employ the lens apparatus of the character of those represented in the figures 7, 8, 9, and 10 of Plate 12. Thus, the lighthouse of Pontaillac, which, in conjunction with that of Terre Xegre, distant two miles, marks one of the passes at the mouth of the Gironde, is alternately red and white, and is lighted with three reflectors when red, and by two when white is used. It only illuminates an arc of about twelve degrees. It is seen that the solution of the question of lighting a determined direction depeuds essentially upon local circumstances, aud each par ticular case should be thoroughly studied. It is above all important never to forget that an alignment is so much the more precise as the lights are the more distant, and that the limits heretofore laid down should not be reached unless in case of absolute necessity. All of our range lights are greatly withiu the limits, as it is easy to see by an inspection of the charts."], [51, "CHAPTER II. ILLUMINATING APPARATUS. The illuminating apparatus of a lighthouse is essentially composed of two distinct parts : 1st. The luminous focus. 2d. The optical system designed to direct to the maritime horizon the rays of light which would diverge to the heavens, towards the earth, or to the foot of the tower. The apparatus in actual use are illuminated by lamps, and colza oil is the combustible generally employed in them. They are divided into catoptric apparatus or by reflectors, and dioptric apparatus or by lenses. Both can be so arranged as to show colored lights. We will examine, first, what are the considerations which govern the general arrangements of these apparatus and their accessories, after which we will describe the apparatus in most general use in the light house service. We will conclude with a study of the different modes of producing light. I.\u2014 CATOPTRIC APPARATUS. Catoptric apparatus do not appear to have been applied to the illumi nation of light-houses before, towards the close of the last century- They existed at that time upon a number of points on our seacoast, and, among others, on Cape Ailly, La Heve, on the isles of Ee and Oleron, and upon the tower of Cordouan. This latter dates 1782, and although it had no less than eighty lamps, each with a reflector, they produced so bad a light that navigators asked earnestly for a return to the preceding system, which consisted of a light produced by coal, which had been substituted for wood within a few years. The apparatus, it is true, was very defective ; the lamps, supplied with flat wicks, pro duced but little light and much smoke, and the reflectors, in the form of spherical segments, received but a small part of the. luminous rays, aud did not transmit them in the direction necessary to render them most useful. The chief engineer of the province, M. Teulere, who owed his dis tinction, at a later period, for increasing the height of this same tower of Cordouan, was charged with the examination of the question and the study of the means by which to remedy the evil complained of. This resulted in the production of a very remarkable Memoir, dated"], [52, "44 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. 26th of May, 17S3, in which he exposed the inefficiency of the system with great clearness, and pointed out the principle which gave value to the catoptric apparatus. He suggested that each reflector should be parabolic in shape; that they should be illuminated by a double cur rent of air lamp placed in the focus of the paraboloid ; to place a num ber of reflectors in the same plane ; and, finally, to give to the apparatus a movement of rotation around a vertical axis, in a way to show in suc cession upon all the points of the horizon the luminous beam emanating from the reflectors. This constituted in this way the eclipse lights.* But it was not at Cordouan that the new system was first applied. It had already been experimented with successfully at other points of our seacoast, when, in 1790, the largest catoptric apparatus which had been constructed up to that date was placed upon the summit of the tower which Teulere had completed. This apparatus consisted of three groups, each of which was formed of four reflectors, ranged above each other in the same plane. These groups, separated by spaces of 120', so as to divide the circumference into three equal parts, being supported upon a frame in the form of a triangular prism, to which a pendulum movement machine gave rotation. The flashes succeeded each other every two minutes. The reflectors had thirty inches (0.812m.) of open- * Borda has the credit, generally, of being the inventor of parabolic reflectors and eclipse lights, and Argand of double curreut-of-air lamps. But, it was in 1784, after having heard of the Memoir of Teulere from Marshal Broglie, then Minister of Marine, that the learned academican caused to be executed for the port of Dieppe, and without claiming the merit of others, a small revolving apparatus, consisting of five parabolic reflectors. The application of the new system to the tower of Cordouan was probably delayed, for the reason that the question at that time was the raising of the tower. The project of that important work was pre sented in 1786, and was immediately commenced. Borda charged himself then to make the apparatus conceived by Teulere, who could not find at Bordeaux a suffi ciently expert artist to do it. As to the inventor of the double curreut-of-air lamp, it is to be remarked that the authors who attributed it to Argand only go back to 1784 or 1786, while the Memoir of Teulere bears date 1783. Besides, that engineer, who is named as the inventor of the parabolic reflectors, does not insist upon that which relates to the burner of the lamp. He contents himself with saying that Argand had the same idea that he had, and took a prominent part in regard to it. Without doubt, the title of Teulere to an absolute priority may be contested. It would be very strauge if no one before him had thought of utilizing, for the trans mission of light, the property best known of the parabola ; and it appeared that a small revolving apparatus, of three reflectors, (probably spherical shells,) had beeu placed at the entrance to the port of Marstrand, iu Sweden, prior to 1783. But the French engineer invented it himself, aud had the merit to conceive a complete aud rational system in all its parts. He has been the real inventor of catoptric lights, in this sense that they are very defective under all the aspects in which the question has been viewed, and that there has been nothiug essential found to add to his con ception. Except the proportions and some few details of construction, the actual catoptric apparatus, the most used, are in entire conformity to those of Teulere."], [53, "CATOPTRIC APPARATUS. 45 Lug. Illuminated at first by lamps, the dimensions of whose burners were too restricted, they gave little divergence; the flash was very quick, but it only' continued during five seconds. In 1793, the diame ters of the burners were augmented, and the duration of the flashes reached then to ten seconds. About the same time, Teulere fitted in the lighthouse of Chauine, at the Sables d'Olonne, an apparatus composed of only three reflectors, in the focus of each of which was a burner of 0.033m. diameter. This mode of illumination constituted a considerable progress, and had a marked success. The greater part of the maritime nations adopted it with eagerness, and until within a recent period it has been exclusively used on the coasts of England, as well as by the most of maritime pow ers of the north of Europe. CATOPTRIC APPARATUS ACTUTALLY IN USE. The catoptric apparatus most iu actual use iu the lighthouse ser vice of France is composed of one or several parabolic reflectors, each one illuminated by a double current-of-air lamp, fed by colza oil. These reflectors are of two kinds : One kind, which is often designated by the name of plwtophores, (concave mirrors,) having but one piece, aud is formed by the revolution of an arc of a parabola around its own axis, as with those of Teulere ; the others are in two pieces, whose surfaces are formed by the revolution of a parabola around the vertical axis passing through its focus. These last were invented by Bordier Mar cet, and named by him sideral apparatus. The Figures 11, 12, and 13 of Plate 12 represent a photophore mounted upon its stands, and the Figures 14 and 15 of the same plate show a sideral apparatus enclosed in a portable lantern. PARABOLIC REFLECTORS OF ONE PIECE. It is easy to see, from an inspection of the figure below, that the pho tophore concentrates into one single luminous beam the greater part of the rays emitted from the focus (O) of the paraboloid, all those which are comprised in the angle O A P B except the losses due to the absorption by the metallic surface and to the occultation produced by the burner of the lamp- The rays emitted directly from the focus, and included in the angle A O B diverge and form a luminous cone, the upper half of which is without useful effect for illumination. If the luminous focus be reduced to a point, all the reflected rays will be par allel to the axis, and the transverse section of the combined beams of light will be at all points precisely equalto the opening of the photo phore, but such is not the case ; the dimensions of the illuminating body are marked relatively to those of the reflector, and each point of the surface reflects a conical beam, whose divergence is as much greater"], [54, "46 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. Fig. 6. as the reflecting point is nearer to the focus, and the flame is more expanded. The beams which come from the reflector are not then cylindrical, but conical. Besides, the luminous rays are not equally distributed, in the entire extent of the cone, which it will be easy to see by observing the direction which they take after having been re flected. Let u x y z, Figure 6, be the horizontal section of the flame ; the most divergent rays in the horizontal plane, are those which tangents to that circum ference come in contact with the reflector at its summit P and the angle L P K represents the horizontal divergence of the apparatus. The extreme rays, such as z A, n A, are reflected following the lines A M, A _N, which form with the axis of the angles equals between them, and with the angles z A O, O A u. The angle of divergence of these luminous rays is equal to M A K. We may determine, in the same manner, the value of the divergence produced by any point whatever, as C of the reflector. That divergence is pre cisely equal to the angle which subtends the tangents coming from that point to the circumference of the flame. Iu the horizontal plane, on that side of the point where the lines A I, B F come in contact with the lines P L and P K, the angular space L P K embraces all the reflected rays. To the right and to the left is an angular space com prised between the lines L P and Sz,orKP and S' z, in which we see the rays coming direct from the focus ; lastly, in the angles SAT S' B T,' we find but a part of these rays, which diminish at leaving these lines A S, B S,' and disappear at A T and B T.' We may see, in the same way, the course which the luminous rays take in any plane whatever. Let us take, for an example, the vertical plane. Let A P B, Figure 7, the section of the reflector x y z \u00ab, be that of the flame, and O the focus of the paraboloid, the ray z M, coming from the point z nor mally to the parabola, mark the limit of the divergence of reflected rays below the horizontal plane, and the normal u N, coming from the point u, is that of the divergence above the same plane. Any point"], [55, "47 CATOPTRIC APPARATUS. C of the upper part of the reflector brings below the horizon all the rays coming from the flame to the right of the line O C, and reflects above that plane all the rays coming from the other side. The former are comprised in the angle LCK=OC\u00ab, and the latter in the angle L' C K = Q C x. The inverse effect is produced by all the points of the parabola which are situated below the focus. fig 7. The divergence which operates iii the horizontal plane and be- low it is useful to the illumina tion, for, if it diminishes the luni- inous intensity, it has the effect \u00b0f expanding the light upon a greater surface, and there is no thing to regret. But it is not the same with the rays sent above the horizon, as they are lost. Besides, that which is of more importance still than to draw part of all the reflected rays, is to illuminate to the greatest pos- sible distance, to direct the most intense luminous beam tangenti- ally to the horizon, and that is accomplished by placing the flame at such a height that the most brilliant part of it will be in the focus of the paraboloid. That disposition has above all the merit of trans mitting more of the rays below than above the horizontal plane. When the apparatus is greatly elevated above the level of the sea, it is so inclined that its prolonged axis will be tangent to the horizon ; but, in most cases, the height is not such as to render it necessary to re sort to that measure, for the tangent to the horizon is sensibly horizontal. The reflectors of one piece, which still now constitute some of our illuminating apparatus, are of three sizes. Those belonging to the old light-houses, received since the invention of the lens system, are habit ually called reflectors of Lenoir, the name of the maker. They have an opening of 0.85m., with a depth of 0.345m., and their focus is situated at 0.131m;. from the summit. They are always lighted by lamps whose burners have a diameter of 0.024w., which consume about 60 grammes of colza oil per hour, and whose intensity is equivalent to 1.60 of car cel burner. Becourse is had to lamps with two concentric wicks, when circumstances render it necessary to have at the same time greater brilliancy and greater divergence. The burners of those last lamps have a diameter of 0.039m., their consumption reaches to 175 grammes of colza oil per hour, and their intensity may be estimated as high as five carcel burners. The divergence of the reflected rays in the hori-"], [56, "48 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. zontal plane is equal to about 12,\u00b0 when the lamp has a single wick, and to 18\u00b0 when it has two wicks. Other parabolic reflectors of one piece have an opening of 0.50m., a depth of 0.195/m., a focal distance of 0.08m-, and are illuminated by lamps with one wick of 0.024>h. diameter.' They have a divergence in the horizontal plane of about 20\u00b0. The reflectors now in most common use have only an opening of 0.29>\u00bb., and a depth of 0.125m. Their focus is situated at 0.042\u00bb*. from the summit. They are for the most part illuminated by lamps with one wick, of 0.021\u00bb\u00ab. diameter, consuming 50 grammes of colza oil per hour, and in intensity estimated at 1.30 of carcel buruer. Inferior to the preceding ones in relative useful effect, they are, on the other hand, lighter, more easily placed, and less expensive. Their divergence in the horizontal plane is abotit 36\u00b0. DISTRIBUTION OF THE LUMINOUS RAYS. The following table exhibits the distribution of the luminous rays by different apparatus in the horizontal plane. The numbers therein inserted have been adopted by the light-house service as representing sufficiently near that which has been found in practice. They are deduced from numerous experiments, which have not been without anomalies, which may be readily conceived on account of the irregu larities in the focus, of which the reflectors are rarely exempt. The maxima which have been found in these essays have beeu reduced to about i, in taking into account the imperfections of the service, and the absorption of the luminous rays by the plate glass of the lanterns.

The brilliancy in the axis, and the divergence in the horizontal plane of a reflector of 0.85m., illuminated by a double-wick lamp, consuming 110 grammes of colza oil per hour, and presenting an intensity of 3 burners, may be valued, respectively, at 580 burners and of 16\u00b0. ADVANTAGES OF PARABOLIC REFLECTORS Fig. 8. Parabolic reflectors possess the advantage of being lighter and less expensive than lens apparatus. They suit well, and are frequently used under the follow ing circumstances : 1. For the illumina tion of narrow passages, or to form one of the range lights of a chan nel. 2. To strengthen, in a fixed direction, a light whose range is sufficient for other parts of the sea horizon. It is for this purpose that a small parabolic reflector has been placed in the lan tern of the light-house at Terre _N~egre to in crease the intensity of the light in the direction of the North Pass of the mouth of the Gironde. 3. For illuminating floating lights, which, however, may, without doubt, admit the use of lens apparatus, but for which they are not so well suited as they are for fixed structures. 4. For the apparatus of temporary lights. F L 4"], [58, "50 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. The apparatus represented above, Fig. 8, in plan and elevation, is such a one. It is seen composed of nine reflectors in three faces of an equilateral triangle. A small revolving machine gives it motion, and causes eclipses, more or less frequent, according to the rapidity of its motion. The range of this Ught is about 15 miles. Fig. 9. Parabolic reflectors are better suited to the forming of eclipse than for fixed lights until the whole or greater part of the horizon is to be illuminated. In the first case, it allows the successive transmission of the same luminous beam to every point of the horizon, and with the same range in every direction; whilst it will be necessary to greatly multiply them to obtain a uniform distribution of the light in every part of the zone to be lighted. This last point, however, is of little importance when the illumination of a pass is under con sideration, because there is almost always ad vantage in directing the greater part of the luminous rays along the axis of the channel. But it is not so under ordinary circumstances. Thus, the illuminating apparatus for fixed lights on board of light- vessels, and such is the character of the most of those lights, are re quired to illuminate the entire horizon, and are formed by a series of reflectors (photophores) of 0.29/m. of opening, arranged in a circle in a lantern, with a mast in the centre, around which it hoists. The first apparatus of this descrip tion, which was made in France, consisted, like those of England, of only eight reflectors, (photophores,) equally distant from each other, aud it resulted that the observer perceived a very brilliant light when it was placed in the axis of one of the reflec tors, and he only saw the light coming direct from the two focii in environs of the bisection of the angle formed by the axes of the two con tiguous reflectors. To an angular space of 36\u00b0, in which the luminous intensity may range from 60 burners to 2, succeeded an angular space of 9\u00b0, in which the light was uniformly distributed, and reached no greater power than of two burners. The curve a a a, of the Figure 9 above, shows the distribution of the light emanating from one of these apparatus in the extent of a semicircle."], [59, "CATOPTRIC APPARATUS. 51 It has been constructed, in taking the angular spaces for absciss\u00e6, to a scale of 0.01m. for 15\u00b0, and the luminous intensities for ordinates to a scale of 0.01m. for 20 burners. A more equal illumination will be obtained by increasing the number of reflectors, because then the curves of two contiguous reflectors cross each other. With 24 reflectors, the luminous intensity will not vary more than from 67 to 68 burners from one point to another, which may be considered as a uniform distribution. The intensities will not differ out of proportion if but 16 reflectors are used. Their maximum will be 60 burners, and their minimum about 25 burners. But such a large number of reflectors make it necessary to give to the lantern dimensions which militate against the special conditions which belong to floating lights, and will, besides, conduce to a consump tion of oil far beyond those of the ordinary lights of the same range. The apparatus for floating fixed lights, recently established at dif ferent points on our coast, have been so arranged that they consist of 10 reflectors, (photophores,) each illuminated by a lamp of one wick of 0m.021 diameter, consuming 50 grammes of oil per hour, and in which the flame has been placed, but at O.Olw*. nearer to the summit of the parabola, so as to give a greater divergence. The crave b b b, of the figure 9, shows how one of these apparatus distributes the light iu the horizontal plane. The decentralization produces a marked reduction of intensity in the axis of the reflector. The most brilliant parts do not attain a greater intensity than of 38 burners ; but the minimum of intensity does not descend below' 18, and it suffices for a range for the height of these lights above the level of the sea. The plate 13 repre sents an apparatus of this description. The divergence of these apparatus in the vertical sense is at the same time more marked than if the flame were in the focus of the paraboloid ; but it has the merit of preventing the occupations which the motion of the vessel tends to produce. The luminous rays which are uselessly thrown up towards the sky when iu a state of repose are sometimes usefully brought to the sea by the motion of the reflectors caused by the sea, which are not placed always immediately in the ver tical plane, notwithstanding the system of suspension employed. Lens apparatus might be substituted for parabolic reflectors and thus realize an economy in the combustible. But that advantage has not appeared sufficiently great to counteract the inherent inconvenience of the system, and the studies which were commenced in that direction have not been followed up. In revolving apparatus for floating lights, the reflectors are to the number of eight or more, and they are sometimes so arranged in groups as to produce very brilliant flashes. The apparatus recently constructed for one of the light-vessels off Dunkerque, is composed of eight reflec-"], [60, "52 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. tors of 0.37m. of opening, 0.185w. of depth, and0.047m. focaljdistance, the flames of which are not uncentred. It is represented ou plate 14. If it be desired to employ reflectors for the illumination of a Light house for a fixed Light to be established under ordinary circumstances, and to illuminate far off and an extended horizon, it will be necessary not only to take care to place the burner out of the focus, as in the case of the fixed fights for light-vessels, but also to employ through choice the large reflectors similar to those of Lenoir, so as to reduce the divergence in the vertical plane as much as apparatus of this sort will allow. It is useless to enter into the examination of the dispositions which it might be convenient to adopt for that purpose, for they vary accord ing to given circumstances, and are, besides, easily imagined. Not a single apparatus of that kind is now in actual use on the coast of France ; those which existed heretofore have all been replaced by lens apparatus, in the double interest of navigation and of the public treasury. There are cases in which circumstances will render the employment of these large reflectors useful ; such as has been previously stated, when it becomes necessary to illuminate a long passage or channel having an angular space of 12\u00b0 to 15\u00b0. The light at Poutaillac, for example, had to fulfil that office, and it was necessary, besides, to give it a character which would prevent its being mistaken for other lights at the mouth of the Gironde. It is fitted with three reflectors of 0>\u00ab.85, directed to the axis of the channel. Two of them are each illuminated by a single-wick lamp, and the third by a double-concentric-wick lamp with a red chimney. A revolving machine gives a motion which alter nates a screen which masks the colored reflector light, then uncovering it, and places a red pane of glass before the two others. That revolu tion is rapid, and changes at regular intervals of 20 seconds, so that the light appears alternately red and white during that interval of time, without interposed eclipses. There was some thought of having the red-light reflector revolve, instead of masking it for the purpose of utilizing in a particular direction the rays which are actually lost dur ing the entire appearance of the white light ; but the local circum stances did not seem to warrant the expeuse which such a disposition of the apparatus would necessitate. SIDERAL APPARATUS. In the sideral apparatus, the luminous rays are distributed uniformly to every part of the sea horizon, with the exception of those which the lateral reflectors send back, which will be spoken of hereafter. If the luminous focus were reduced to a point, the only lost rays \u2014 allowance being made for the absorption of the reflecting surface \u2014 would be, as"], [61, "53 DIOPTRIC APPARATUS. shown by the figure below, those which are situated in the space com prised between the horizontal plane passing through the focus of the paraboloid, and the conical surface generated by the rotation of the line O M around the vertical axis O P. But, as in the reflec- Fig. 10. tors of a single piece, the loss is much greater in pro portion to the dimensions of the illuminating body. It is easy to determine it by follow ing the .graphic illustration which has been submitted above, and it therefore ap pears unnecessary to pursue the subject further. Whenever a sideral apparatus is not required to illuminate the entire horizon, and that is habitually the case, the reservoir of the lamp is placed in the dark or dead angle, and on each side of it parabolic reflectors, which unite with the two pieces of the apparatus, and return to usefulness the luminous rays which diverge from the land side. These apparatus are of but very limited dimensions, and produce lights having only a short range. Their brilliancy does not exceed about 3J burners. They are always placed in small movable lanterns which hoist upon a wooden scaffolding, or upon a chandelier between two directing posts. Sideral apparatus recommended themselves heretofore by their light ness and small price, and they have been used to a certain extent in illuminating our coasts. But the small dioptric apparatus of mould or polished glass, which will be noticed hereafter, are preferable to them under all circumstances, have caused them to be abandoned and the newr ones substituted for them. MODE OF CONSTRUCTING AND ATTENDING UPON REFLECTORS. All the reflectors are made from sheets of copper, plated with silver, which are shaped upon a matrix. It is their defect that they lose a great deal of their reflecting power when their polish has been changed, or when they are not kept per fectly clean. It is not necessary that either one of these defects should be very marked to reduce the quantity of the light emanating from the apparatus. I.\u2014 DIOPTRIC APPARATUS. The property possessed by convex lenses, of refracting nearly parallel to their axes, all the rays emanating from a focal point, called them to fulfil an office analogous to that of the parabolic reflectors ; but they"], [62, "54 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. could not be applied to the illumination of lighthouses in preserving the continuous spherical form which belongs to them. Constructed necessarily upon larger dimensions, they would have been very thick at the centre; and thence three grave difficulties: considerable absorp tion of the luminous rays by the lens ; deviations more or less numer ous in consequence of air bubbles, of stri\u00e6 or of differences of density in the mass of glass; and of such weight as to render it very difficult to arrive at a proper disposition of the apparatus. LENSES IN ECHELON. Button saw dimly the solution ; without dreaming, for other reasons, of maritime illumination, he had proposed to set up the lenses by echelons. But he supposed that they would be formed of a single piece, and did not discover the meaus which he might have drawn from that arrangement to direct the luminous rays in the/most satisfactory manner. The invention was neither practical nor complete, and it was forgotten for a long time, when, iu 1819, a young engineer of the Corps of Bridges and Roads, already a celebrated natural philosopher, was attached to the light-house service. (Commission des Phares.) Like Button, and without doubting that the idea was new, Augustin Fresnel conceived the echelon lenses, but he did not rest there; he immediately judged that that form ought to conduce to correct the spherical aber ration, a defect so much graver as the lenses increase in dimensions; he recognized all the applications of which the new system was sus ceptible, and he resolved upon the means of execution, leaving to a not distant future the care of perfecting them. His lenses were composed of a central part and of successive eche lons, cast and worked separately, and afterwards solidly joined together. Their profile was formed, on one side, by a right line, so as to facili tate the execution, and the centres, such as the radii and the ampli tudes of the arcs of circle of the opposite face, were calculated upon the condition to reduce as much as possible the spherical aberration and the thickness of the glass. DISPOSITION OF THE LENSES The profile adopted, two systems of lenses naturally flow from it : 1st. In giving to it a movement of rotation around the horizontal axis passing through the focal point, a lens of annular elements is obtained, possessing the property of reuniting in one bundle or beam of parallel rays all the luminous rays emanating from the focus, in the same manner as by parabolic reflectors. As several of these lenses are placed so as to form a prism to a polygonal basis, having for axis the vertical passing through their focii, but one source of light occupies"], [63, "DIOPTRIC APPARATUS. 55 that point, aud which is made to turn around the axis of the lenticular drum thus composed ; the luminous beams emanating from the lenses being brought successively to all points of the horizon, aud none of the light beiug seen in the intervals. We shall have an eclipse light. 2d. If the same profile turns around the vertical axis passing through the focus, it will form a cylindrical surface, which has the property of distributing uniformly upon the entire horizon the luminous rays ema nating from the focus which come in contact with it. That constitutes a fixed light. LENSES OF VERTICAL ELEMENTS, A third kind of lens, to which recourse is sometimes had, consists in transporting the profile parallel to itself in a vertical plane ; this move ment creates a plane lens with vertical elements, which has the prop erty to reunite all the rays emanating from the focus in one beam com prised between two vertical planes. It is easy to judge that in placing one lens of this description in front of the rays which have already passed through a cylindrical lens, they collect them all into one beam \u2022similar to those produced by annular lenses. The first acts horizontally, and the second vertically. Although they double the number of lenses and are little favorable to the economy of light, that arrangement is sometimes employed in lights varied by flashes, as we shall see further on. The figures 1 and 3 of the plate 6 show au example of au appa ratus of this description. HEIGHT OF THE LENSES The height of the lenticular drum ought to be kept in a certain rela tion with the focal distance. There is a limit outside of which there will be loss, by the reflection upon the interior face of the lens, of a marked portion of the luminous rays, and on the other hand, the salient angles of the echelons the furthest from the centre will become so sharp that their execution will be very difficult, in the same time fail ing to present sufficient guarantees of durability. The angle at the focus which subtends the drum of the lens apparatus has been fixed at first at 45\u00b0, but it has been judged that it might go further with advan tage, aud it varies actually from 56\u00b0 to 67\u00b0, according to the nature of the apparatus. DISPOSITIONS RELATIVE TO RAYS PASSING ABOVE OR BELOW THE LENTICULAR DRUM, The rays passing belowT the drum uselessly light the foot of the tower ; those which are raised above it spread themselves out iu the upper parts of the atmosphere, and they will be consequently all lost to niari-"], [64, "56 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. time illumination if recourse is not had to dispositions of the proper kind to direct them to the horizon. Different systems have beeu conceived by Augustin Fresnel, with the view to utilize these two parts of emitted light. In 1822, in the first large apparatus which he had constructed, and which was placed upon the Cordouan light-house tower, eight small lenses of 0.50wi. of focus, forming a kind of pavillion above the lamp, collected all the upper luminous rays, and sent them out in beams upon the large plane mirrors which were placed to direct them to the horizon. The apparatus was for eclipses, and its section octagonal. Its upper part revolved with the drum, but the panels of the two divisions of the system, instead of being placed upon the same axes, were deviated in such a manner that the two flashes were consecutive and not simul taneous. He could have employed the quantity of light obtained by the new dispositions to augment the intensity of the flashes. He pre ferred, and with good reason, to use them to prolong their duration. The rays thrown out below the drum only form a small part of the light emanating from the focus, and Augustin Fresnel did not at first attach much importance to the means of collecting them. However, he announced, in a note placed at the end of his Memoir of 1822, that they could be directed to the horizon by means of small plates of silvered glass, fixed below the large lenses, and arranged in a manner similar to the pieces in a loindow-blind, with the proper inclination to reflect the rays in the wished-for direction. That idea was carried out in several apparatus, but the small panes of glass, being plane, only solved the problem approximately. Some years after, they were replaced by the horizontal zones, com posed of curved silvered mirrors, and zones of the same kind were substituted in the moveable part of the apparatus above the drum. Each of these zones, of which the mirrors were iu juxtaposition, could be considered as generated by the revolution of an arc of a parabola, having for focus that of the apparatus, and revolving around the ver tical passiug through the same point.* The luminous rays collected by them were no longer devoted to the prolongation of the duration of the flashes in the revolving lights ; they were distributed uniformly upon the entire sea horizon, and they constituted a fixed light, which, appearing during the eclipses, was for the purpose of allowing naviga tors never to lose sight of the light seen while approaching the coast; that is to say, from the moment it became of most importance to know their exact position. In the lighthouses with fixed lights, these para- * However, in eases where it was impossible to give au exact parabolic curve to the mirrors, they were ranged according to oscillating spherical surface of the fragments of paraboloid which they ought to have formed."], [65, "DIOPTRIC APPARATUS. 57 bolic mirrors increased the intensity of the light. The dispositions adopted above and below the drum were the same as in all the light houses.* That solution left something more yet to desire, although it was very happy in theory. It was necessary above all, that the mirrors should utilize the light quite as well as the lenses, at least when they were new, and their reflecting powers should only diminish in a great pro portion from the time the silvering becomes worn. They are liable to become deranged iu their positions by the necessary cleaning, and the keepers are not always careful to replace them properly. Finally, their construction offered such difficulties that the engineers were obliged to become very tolerant in inspecting and receiving them, and the price, though very high, was not considered sufficient by the constructors. CATADIOPTRIC RINGS. An entirely new and completely irreproachable arrangement was conceived by the illustrious inventor. It consisted in transmitting the rays to the horizon by the way of refraction and of total reflection by means of rings of triangular section. But the theoretical conception could not always be put into immediate execution. The fabrication of the lenses have proved it. Before obtaining them under the regular forms which gave to them the actual machines, it became necessary to give them up, and to accept iu their stead the polygoual shape, and to compose them in a series of small spherical surfaces, ranged vase fashion. Recourse could not be had to the same method for the new rings, and he was compelled fora longtime to limit himself to the appli cation of them to the small apparatus for which the wrork of turning did not require implements, which was considered too expensive. t Figure 11 show's the course of a luminous ray in one of these rings. Starting from the focus F, it is refracted at A, follows the direction A B, becomes totally reflected ou the surface M N, takes the direction B C, and at last leaves the ring, following the horizontal line H. C. The profile of the catadioptric rings being given, it may, as in the case of the lenses in echelon, receive a revolving motion around the * This system having been abandoned, we do not think it necessary to represent it upon a special plate, inasmuch as it will be found in a great many apparatus actually in use. The figures 2 of the plates 19, 20, and 24 appear to give, besides, a sufficiently correct idea of it. t The fixed light of the Gravelines light-house was the first light of the third order which received the catadioptric rings, and its construction bears date 1842 ; they were applied the following year to fixed lights of the first order. It was not until 1852 that the annular catadioptric panels of the first order were, for the first time, constructed. They were executed by Mr. Heury Lepaute, placed in the light-house of Ailly, and employed to prolong the duration of the flashes."], [66, "58 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS, vertical axis F G, passing through the focus, or take this movement around the horizontal axis F I, leading through the same point. In the first case, it distributes the light uniformly around the en tire horizon, and consti tutes au element of fixed light; in the second, it reunites all the rays into one band or beam, after the manner of the lenses employed iu the eclipse light apparatus. These Fig. 11. two applications were made during the lifetime of Augustin Fresnel, but only to the small apparatus. The first to the fixed-light apparatus of the kind represented by the figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Plate 12 ; both at the time to the apparatus of still more limited dimensions, which were employed for sometime for the lighting of the canal of St. Martin, at Paris. The front part of these last distributed the light equally upon one-half of the circumference, after the manner of a fixed-light apparatus of 180\u00b0 arc, and prolonged at each extremity by a half lens in the dioptric and catadioptric parts, which produced a luminous beam, comparatively very intense, directed normally to the meridian plane of the apparatus. Thus were found united on a small scale, and for a Fig. 12. useful purpose, the two principal systems of panels of both kinds of profiles. This gives an almost complete summary of the valuable invention. Figure 12 represents one of these appa ratus, which is rigorously preserved in the Museum of the Commission of Lights, among types of the most ancient lenses. They are given in lateral elevation, and the horizontal section taken at the height of the focal plane. The essential was established. The just praise which has been awarded to the French illuminating apparatus, the devel opment which all the maritime powers wished to give to the illumination of their coasts with the new inven tion which favored it, encouraged our constructors, enabled them to"], [67, "DIOPTRIC APPARATUS. 59 erect establishments for their manufacture upon a large scale, and brought forth incessant improvements and ameliorations in their pro ductions. Mirrors are no longer constructed, and the catadioptric rings are applied under various and different forms to the largest apparatus. SPHERICAL REFLECTORS When an apparatus is not required to illuminate the entire horizon, it is important to direct to the sea the rays which would diverge use lessly from the landside. For that purpose, recourse is had to spheri cal reflectors, which cover the dead angle of the apparatus, and return to the focal point the rays which, leaving that point, come in contact with them. These rays, pursuing their course, strike the lenses oppo site, which refract them in the same way that the others are refracted. However, it is not upon the exact focus that the reflected rays come to cross each other, it is a little higher, for the centre of the spherical reflector is fixed at a little height above that point. Two motives con cur in causing the adoption of this disposition. If the centre of the spherical surfaces coincide with the focal point, a large part of the reflected rays will be arrested by the body of the lamp, and, on the other hand, the burner will be exposed to be burnt (fused) and the wicks carbonized, for the reason that they will become too much heated. It results, therefore, that the greater part of the reflected rays are sent through the lenses, following the lines more or less inclined to the horizon, aud which increase the flash or brilliancy of the light in a much greater proportion at a short than a great distance. It is seen that there would not be any economical advantage to substitute for these reflectors much more expensive apparatus, even when these last would possess the merit of absorbing less of the luminous rays, and such are those which may be obtained by means of catadioptric double reflection rings. It is not possible to make a reduction of expense in questions of that kind. In some apparatus of the first order the reflectors have been placed on the landside, not only in the height of the drum, but, also, both above and below. That has been abandoned, for the reason that the quantity' of rays uselessly brought back by the reflectors from above aud below, have not been thought sufficiently great to compensate for the expense of placing them ; besides, it has been found that it is not without interest for the supervision of the service to transmit a little light landward. These reflectors are always made in sheets of copper plated with silver. One of our constructors, 'Mr. L. Sautter, makes them of glass, silverplated on the exterior surface. A much better polish is thus obtained, while the attendance upon them is much easier; but, perhaps, the shape is not equally regular."], [68, "60 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. DIMENSIONS AND INTENSITY OF THE FLAMES. In the catoptric apparatus the number of lamps is increased when it is necessary to have a more powerful light. In the lens apparatus it is upon the lamp itself which it is necessary to act upon, and to make it vary for that purpose the number and the diameter of the wicks- The dimensions of the apparatus regulate themselves by those of the flame. The diameters of, and the spaces between the wicks actually in use, were determined in 1821 by Augustin Fresnel and Arago, and the long experience to which they have been subjected since that time have fully justified them. They were fixed in a way to insure regularity of the service, and to allow the utilizing of the best part of the expended combustible. ORDERS OF THE LIGHTS, The burners of the lamps of lights of the first order carry four cou centric wicks, those of the second order three, those of the third order two, and all the apparatus illuminated by a lamp of a single wick are ranged as of the fourth order. The Plate 15 represents these burners on a scale of one-half, as well as the flames generated by them. The burners are seen in elevation on one side, and iu vertical section ou the other. The plans are taken from above. The table below shows the regulation dimensions, and the luminous intensities of the flames: DIMENSIONS OF THE sVPPARATUS. It is easy to see that it is necessary to observe a certain relation between the dimensions of a lens apparatus and those of the flame which illuminates it, as much to maintain within proper limits the ex penses of the first fitting and establishing, as to derive the full benefit of the best part of the light produced at the focal point.

These considerations have led to the regulating of the dimensions of the apparatus of the different orders, as shown by the figures of Plate 3 and the following table : DISTRIBUTION OF THE LUMINOUS RAYS. Let us now examine how the luminous rays directed from the fiame upon the ditt'erent parts of a lens apparatus act. The following figures represent a fragment of the plaue and profile of an apparatus of the first order of eclipses, each panel of which embraces one-eighth of the circumference. The focus of the drum which forms the dioptric lenses is situated at Fig. 13. O on both of them. AJ1 the rays emanating from the focus, as O M, O N, are refracted parallel to that which, starting from the same point, passes through the axis of the lens; the others diverge more or less, follow the part of the flame which sends; aud the extreme limits of the divergence, in the horizontal plane, are given by the lines A (J, B D, which are, respec tively, parallel to the two tangents at the flame brought through the centre of the lens. In the vertical plane, it may be said that these limits are marked by the lines Q R and S T, which are, respec tively, parallel to the two lines passing through the centre of the Order of the apparatus. _. g g.i-3 \"BSe ffi =__; I Height of the optical parts.

All the rays which have their point of de parture above the focus give dipping lights ; those which have their point of departure below the focus are sent back towards the upper parts of the atmosphere. When the drum is circular, in place of being polygonal, the lenses are cylindrical, and not annular. The luminous rays are distributed uniformly iu the horizontal plane, aud they act in a meridian section in the same way as those of the annular lenses. The section of the luminous beam presents an inverted image of the flame on that side of the point where the ascending and descending rays cross each other. The angular amplitude of that image, referred to the focus, is iu the inverse proportion to the actual dimensions ; they diminish as the distance increases, and it, therefore, results that it is not indifferent, in the photometric operations, to take a short or a great distance from the lens whose effects are to be determined. The inten sities will be found greater when further off, if the thickuess of the atmosphere does uot cause differences in the results. Thus, at the time when the experiments were made, with precision, in 1852, in the galleries of the wine-vaults at Paris, the intensities, as proved by the photometer, augmented to a distance varying from 80 to 150 metres, but they diminished in the reverse manner, which would have been produced if the atmosphere had been entirely transparent. The figures below give some idea of the variation of amplitude and of brilliancy of the luminous beam emanating from an annular lens of the first order, embracing the eighth of the circumference, according as it is measured, at 25 metres or 100 metres from the focal point. Fig. 14. The curves abede, f g h i I; of the Figure 14, represent the luminous rays iu the horizontal plane most illuminated. The degrees"], [71, "63 DIOPTRIC apparatus. are carried on the axis of the abscissae, and the luminous intensities upon those of the ordinates, upon a scale of one centimeter for one thousand burners. The first of these curves is taken at 25 metres dis- tance, aud the second at 100 metres. Fig. 15. The curves m n o p q, r stu vf of the Figure 15, upon the same scale, and also taken at 25 metres and 100 metres, show how the rays are distributed in the vertical plane passing through the focus and the axis of the lens. All of these lines have been traced from the mean results deduced from numerous experi ments, and often making allow ance for slight anomalies.* Starting from the distance of 100 metres, the variations of amplitude, and, consequently, of intensity, are little marked, and it was not thought neces sary to go beyond, for fear of losing too much influence by the default of transparency of the atmosphere. It is then at that limit at which have been taken the measures relative to the different apparatus which will be given further on. * It seems necessary to show how these photometric experiments have been made. The method habitually employed consists in comparing the shadows thrown upon a table or white screen by an object which illuminates the two lights under test. The two lights are moved nearer or further away until they appear to be of the same shade; and the comparative luminous intensities are calculated according to the law of the square of the distances. That instrument, has the great merit of being impro vised at any time. A sheet of paper and a pencil is all that is required to construct it, but it has the inconvenience of failing in precision, for the reason that the observer finds difficulty in placing himself exactly between the two shadows, and in a normal direction to that of the table, and that, besides the determination of the line of the space which is well illuminated, from which the dark shadows are detached, depends, in a certain degree, upon the delicacy or acuteness of the vision of the observer. The photometer used in the service of the Commission of Lights was constructed bv the engineer, Degrand, to the comparison of moveabie shadows ; he substituted those of luminous bands, thrown upon a black surface. It is represented by the"], [72, "64 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. The residts are sensibly the same, with the exception as to the in clination of the rays, so far as the axis of the flame coincides with that of the apparatus, and that of the focus of the lens is situated in the in terior of that flame. The preceding figure will then show how the flame ought to be placed with reference to the optical focus, according to the end proposed. If the coudition was to oppose it to the dispersion of the luminous rays above the horizontal plane, the point below the flame will be the one which the focus should occupy; that will be the most brilliant which corresponds to the zero of the figure if it be desired to illuminate to the greatest possible distance on the horizontal plane. It will soon be seen how to place this point with reference to the focus, according to the height of the light-house above the level of the sea. figures above, (16,) in section and elevation, and may be described as follows : The rays emanating from each light L I are received upon a pane, m n m \u00ab', covered by a sheet of paper or a coat of lacca, after having passed through an opening p p' operated in the axis of a vertical screen, interposed between the pane of glass and Fig. 1C."], [73, "DIOPTRIC APPARATUS. 65 After having been reflected by the catadioptric rings, the rays emanating from those parts of the flame situated above or below the Fig. 17. optical focus act in the inverse way to those which re turn from the diop tric lenses. The first, as M N P, M N'P',(Fig.l7,)are directed towards the heavens; the second, such -as Q N R, Q N' R', are brought down be low the horizontal plane. In this way calculation is made of the greatest part of these rings for other optical focii besides those ot the dioptric lens. In each direction in which the flame ot a lamp is seen, corresponds a thin section of maximum intensity, wrhere it may be supposed the light is uniformly distributed, and whose centre of gravity ought to be the lights. The observer places himself on the other side of the paue of glass, which is moved further from, or nearer, to compare the intensities of the two luminous bands or beams which are seen. The band or beam seen to the right is produced by the light L, aud the other by the light I. The screen may be moved, which is placed upon a board, q q q' </, which moves between two grooves, according as it may be souud to be most convenient, to place the bands in coutact, or to open them more, as they become more dim or brighter, from the illumination of the two focii. It is essential that the rays emanating from both lights should be equally inclined upon the pane of glass, and that will be assured of, and that conditiou fulfilled, when the line of separation of the two bands blends with a vertical dividing the pane into two equal parts. For that purpose the photometer is turued upon the plane which sup ports it. It is equally necessary that the two lights and the centre of the pane be on the same horizontal plane, and the instrument may be raised or lowered, at will, by means of a support, which slides in a case or sheath, and is maintained there by a screw, r. Every part of the photometer is painted in dead black, so as to prevent reflections of the luminous rays, and a large black curtain fixed at its upper part, s s' \u00ab', permits the obsorver to completely isolate himself. The distances to be measured are those of the lights to the centre of the pane of glass. In designating them by D and d. we have \u2014 D 2 F l 5"], [74, "66 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. taken for the focus of the ring situated on that side. Doubtless, neither the position nor the limits of that brilliant part is susceptible of being recognized with much precision, for it depends upon the form and con stitution of the flame, which are variable and irregular ; but there is not such a difference of intensity between two rays starting from points very near the illuminating body as to make it of real interest to obtain a rigorous solution of the problem. The focii of the rings under discussion have been determined in the following manner: the flame has been placed in the middle of the dioptric drum of the apparatus in such a way that the centre of the horizontal section of the greatest brilliancy coincides nearly with the optical focus; after that, the focii to be assigned to the rings are fixed in accordance with considerations which are to be discussed. In this way it was determined to adopt the same focus for all the catadioptric upper rings, and to establish them in the lights of the two first orders at 0.01 above those of the dioptric lenses. The foci of the rings placed below the lenticular drum have been raised now, because no account could kbe taken of the luminous rays which the lamp burner intercepted. Their height above the dioptric focus of one ring to another has beeu varied from 0.010m. to 0.035m. for the first order, to 0.032m. for the second, to 0.022m. for the third, and between the limits much more restricted for the apparatus of less dimensions. The same considerations have allowed other profiles, of which an account will be given further on, for the apparatus illuminated by oil of schiste, petroleum, or an electric current. The profiles of Plate 3 exhibit very neatly the tracings of our principal apparatus. The Figures 1, 2, and 3 apply, respectively, to the first, second, and third orders, and the Figures 4, 5, and 6 to the apparatus of 0.50m., of 0.375w., aud of 0.30m. in diameter, illuminated by colza oil. Figure 7 is that of an apparatus for schiste oil. Figures 8, 9, 10, and 11 give the profiles of the lenses of vertical elements corresponding to the dioptric drums of the four largest. Experience has proved that the different sections of the apparatus thus disposed, transmit, horizontally, or rather following a little in clination, the most brilliant part of the beam generated, when the flame which illuminates them occupies the position, and has received the development which has served as the basis for the determination of the optical focii. It is easy to see that, if it has not fulfilled that condition, there will be a loss of luminous rays which will be still greater when it is separated more from the normal state.

But, with regard to the habit ual elevation of the lights, and to the dimensions as well as to the oscillations of the flame, the two first modifications are not really necessary except in exceptional circumstances and cases, and it is scarcely ever thought necessary to have recourse to this last.

The lumin ous beam of the greatest intensity coming from the apparatus complete, whatever otherwise the character of the Light, is slightly inclined towards the horizon, following the angle which varies with the degree of perfection of the mounting of the prisms, and the oscillations of the flame, and more of the r'ays are carried below than above the horizontal plane. Fig. 18. It is evident that that angle cannot be deter mined with great precision; neither the pro cess of construction, nor the practical means of verifying the apparatus permit it; but it is, however, authorized to be admitted within, that it is about 15 minutes, when the appa ratus is treated with the degree of precision which our able constructors know so well how to obtain. But in the lights under considera tion, the lines thus inclined may be considered as tangents to the surface of the sea; the error of which they are liable may be entirely neglected. An example will illustrate this point, which is essential and has not always been under stood. The Figure 18 shows how the illumin ous rays emanate from a complete apparatus of the first-order fixed light, distributing themselves in the vertical plane above and below the dioptric focus, when the burner of the lamp is fixed at 0.028m. below that point, and of a flame fully developed. The angular spaces have been carried upon the axis of the ordinates on a scale of 0.01m. per degree, and the intensities are ex pressed upon the axis of the abscissae on the scale of 0.01m. for 200 burners. The focus of the apparatus is placed at zero of the axis. The most intense part of the beam A B makes with the horizon an angle of about 15 minutes. The rays above are projected towards the heaven ; all those which are below, and those are the most numerous, cut the surface of the sea, when the height of the light is a mean between the limits spoken of. FORM OF A LUMINOUS BEAM. The following figure is of a kind to give an idea of the subject. It represents the real form of the section through a vertical plane passing through the focus of the luminous beam from an apparatus of a first-"], [78, "70 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. order fixed light, in that which we may consider as a mean state of the atmosphere, that is to say, when the light of unity reaches to 7 kilo metres. The distances are recorded on a scale of 0.007m. per nautical mile. At F is the focus, and the line of the greatest luminous inten sity, F O, is that which ought to be directed tangentially to the hori zon. The part of the luminous beam situated above that line is lost to the mariner, and that which is placed below a line reaches the sur face of the sea. Fig. 19 . It is seen, then, in what proportion the range will be reduced if it is wished to utilize the whole of the light sent by the apparatus, and it is also seen that the curve is sufficiently flattened at its summit for a variation of some minutes in the direction of the line F O, not to exert a sensible influence upon the range of the light. MODIFICATIONS TO INTRODUCE IN THE APPARATUS BECAUSE OF THE HEIGHT OF THE FOCAL PLANE. Modifications become necessary when the focal plane of the lighthouse is more than 100 metres above the level of the sea, and they are of two kinds \u2014 those relative to the luminous beam passing through the lenticular drum, and the others to those reflected by the catadioptric rings. In those which relate to the drum, the burner of the lamp is raised, according to the height of the focal plane and conform ably to the figures inserted in the foregoing table, in such a manner as to have the beams properly inclined. But the dis tance 0.028m. of the crown of the burner at the centre of the drum, being established in view of a mean elevation of about 70 metres, ought not to be reduced more than the difference existing between the figures of the table and those which cor respond to that latter height, 0.004m. Thus, for a light having 150 metres above the level of the sea, the crown of the burner should be held at 0.028m.\u2014 (0.0058m.\u2014 0.0040/...) __= 0.0262m. be low the horizontal plane passing through the centre of the drum. A loss of light results from the form of the lenses, but it is insignificant ill the practical limits. In the eclipse lights whose elevations are very considerable, such as that of Cape Carbon in Algeria, which is 220 metres, the lenses of the. drum are inclined in such a manner as to render them normal to the line directed tangeutially to the horizon, and the burner of that light is placed at 0.028m. + 0.004m., which is 0.032m. below the focus. The drum presents the form of a truncated pyramid. This can only be done in"], [79, "DIOPTRIC APPARATUS. 71 fixed apparatus, because it will be necessary to give a conical form to the drum, from which would result difficulties of construction which would not be sufficiently justified. Moreover, great heights above the level of the sea are rarely selected, for the reason that very high points are subject to being covered or obscured by fogs. In raising the burner, the catadioptric parts of the apparatus are operated upon inversely to that upon which it acts upon the drum ; it causes the luminous beam to be above in place of lowering it upon the Fig. 20. horizon, and it becomes necessary to calculate a special profile for each height if it is desired to proceed with the greatest accuracy. This would be a serious inconvenience, but the problem niay be solved more simply, and with the degree of rigorous accuracy which the subject requires. Is the question one of a ring for a fixed light ? Each of its parts is gently iucliued in such a way that the mean inclination of the reflecting face of each fragment is directed upon the hori zon and above the most intense beam. Is it a catadioptric auuular panel such as those used for eclipse lights ? A movement is giveu to it analogous to that required for the dioptric panel of the drum. It is easy to understand that approximate solutions are admissible without difficulty in similar cases, and that an extreme precision will at the same time be without any real object, on account of the incessant modi fications which are taking place iu the state of the tlame. VARIATION OF THE LUMINOUS INTENSITY WITH THE DISTANCE. It is to be remarked that, although the beam having the greatest intensity is directed to the limit of the horizon, the quantity of light seeu by the navigator increases in augmentation in starting from this point, in proportion as the light is approached, then to diminish, and soon after disappear. Figure 20 shows the dis tribution of the luminous intensities of a fixed light of the first order, whose focal plane is 60 metres above the level of the sea. The distances are laid down on a scale of 0.007/h. per nautical mile upon the axis of the abscissa?, aud the quantities of light are carried"], [80, "72 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. upon the axis of the ordinates on a scale of 0.10m. per hundred (100) burners. It is seen that, in the state of the atmosphere taken as the basis of the calculations, it is to about 1.08 miles from the foot of the light-house that the light appears most brilliant to the eyes of the navigators. The tangent point of the luminous beam is at O. POSITION OF THE FLAME IN THE APPARATUS OF THE SECOND, THIRD, AND FOURTH ORDER. The same means are taken into consideration in directing tangen tially to the surface of the sea the most intense part of the luminous beams emanating from the apparatus of the three other orders. With regard to the constitution of the flames of these apparatus, it is regu lated so that it follows distance to be observed between the focus of the drum and the crown of the burner for mean heights : Light of the2d order: Mean height, 45m.; distance, 0.026m. Light of the 3d order : Mean height, 25m. ; distance, 0.024m. Light of the 4th order : Mean height, 12m. ; distance, 0.022m. In those of the last lights, which are illuminated with the oil of schiste, the burner occupies another position, which will be shown when combustibles are treated of. GENERAL DISPOSITIONS OF THE APPARATUS The apparatus for fixed lights of the first order is composed of eight panels in each of the three parts in which it is divided, and these panels are placed upon the same axes, as shown by Figure 2, Plate 6. The largest annular lenses of the apparatus of the same order only embrace one-eighth of the circumference. They belong to the lights whose eclipses succeed each other every minute. The duration of the flash which they produce is very restricted, because of their little divergence, of eight seconds at a short distance ; they diminish in proportion as the observer recedes from them. It is greater in the reflector lights, and that merit is highly appreciated by mariners. It would doubtless have been easy to remedy the inconvenience which the new system presented, for it would only have beeu required to render the lenses more divergent; but more would have been lost in intensity than w7ould have been gained in duration, and that would have been a bad solution of the question. The same result has been obtained by not placing the annular cata dioptric panels upon the same axes as the dioptric panels; they are deviated a little, as shown in Figure 4 of Plate 5, aud Figure 2 of Plate 7, in such a way that the flashes follow each other in place of being supeiposed. They first make an angle of 4\u00b0 with the seconds in horizontal projection, and they precede them in the sense of the rota-"], [81, "DIOPTRIC APPARATUS. 73 tion movement. The navigator sees at first the flash of the catadioptric panel, and then the flash of the brilliant dioptric panel. The figure below shows the variations of the intensities of the total flash ; it is shown on a scale of 0.01m. to the degree, and 0.001m. to 100 burners. The curve A B C 13 E is that of the distribution of the luminous rays emanating from the dioptric panel in the plane of the greatest intensity, and the curve F C H I J that of the catadioptric panel. The intensities join in the place where they are superposed, and the Fig. 21. curve FGHKL C D E represents the effect produced by the two united panels. There is a point of inflexion, and the height of the first curve extends notably beyond the second. It might be feared, on one side, that the flash would be separated by an eclipse of a kind to deceive the navigators as to the character of the light ; aud on the other, that the benefit of prolongation would not be assured but upon a small part of the illuminated extent. But the curve of the ranges answers to the intensities in the different directions in which it is represented by the line MNO P, which is represented on a scale of 0.001m. per nautical mile, exhibited in such a way that the errors are sufficiently small to be left out of the account. The lower catadioptric rings are not arranged in panels in the lights now uuder consideration ; they are for fixed lights, as were produced by the parabolic mirrors of the old apparatus. The same dispositions may be adopted for the nearer eclipse lights. It will be sufficient to cause the revolving motion to increase in the inverse ratio of the duration of the intervals to be observed between the luminous apparitions ; but the duration of the flashes will be reduced iu the same proportion, and it is preferred to multiply the lenses, although the intensities are thus diminished in nearly the same degree."], [82, "74 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. The apparatus of the first order, whose eclipses reproduce themselves in every thirty seconds, have sixteen panels in its circumference instead of eight. When the flashes succeed each other at shorter intervals, of twenty to twenty seconds, and below that, the attempt to prolong the duration is given up for fear of reducing too greatly the power, and at the same time suffers the fixed light to add to them, reunited iu beams, the luminous rays which would have constituted it, three annular panels are superposed upon the same axis. Three principal systems are employed to produce what is called the fixed light varied by flashes, of which are the fixed lights which present white or colored flashes at regular intervals of time, more or less intense. These flashes are sometimes preceded and followed by eclipses of short duration. The first of these systems consists in causing several lenses of vertical elements to revolve in front from a fixed-light apparatus. These lenses are of the same height as the dioptric drum, and produce concurrently with it an effect analogous to that of an annular lens; they bring together iu a beam the luminous rays which, without their interposition would be distributed uniformly in the angular space which they subtend. An eclipse precedes the flash, and another follows it. They are not total except at great distances from the light-house, because the movable lenses only cover the drum without extinguishing the rays brought from catadioptric rings. The Figures 5, 8, 12, and 15 of Plate 1, give an idea of the distribu tion of the luminous rays in apparatus of this sort. There are no lenses of vertical elements in the second system. The drum of the apparatus of the fixed light is cut by a certain number of annular lenses at equal distances, and the revolving motion is given to the entire drum, sometimes even to the whole apparatus, when in a fight of the lower orders. The luminous appearances are the same as in the preceding combination. Preference is given to one or the other disposition, according as the apparatus is to illuminate the whole or only a part of the horizon. In the last case, the lens of vertical elements serves best, because it allows a reduction of the angular space in the fixed apparatus in which the luminous rays should be sent out, leaving an open space to facilitate the service of the keeper, and does not require so heavy a weight to put it iu motion. But there is an advantage, iu the first hypothesis, to employ the annular lenses, for the reason that there is economy in the expense of the establishment, aud at the same time economy of light, since the rays which produce the flashes have but one lens traverse instead of two. The apparatus of the third system have no eclipses. They are com posed of two parts upon their heights, which are established, one after the manner of the fixed light apparatus, the other like those for eclipses."], [83, "75 DIOPTRIC APPARATUS. This last only is put in motion, when the apparatus is not required to illuminate the entire horizon, and is placed above the other. The Figures 7, 8. aud 9 of Plate 5 represent one of the apparatus of the third order. When it is desired to color the flashes, each of the panels which pro duce them is covered by a colored pane of glass, and also add to them habitually small thin sheets of the same glass, which change the color of the fixed white light during the entire duration of the flash. The same figures, and tfiose of Plate 10, furnish examples of that disposition of the apparatus. APPARATUS OF THE LOWER ORDERS. The apparatus of the smaller orders are disposed in the same manner as'those of the first order, according to the effects which are desired to be obtained, but they do not in general carry an equally large number of panels. APPARATUS FOR THE ELECTRIC LIGHT. The relation which it is necessary to observe between the dimensions of the apparatus and that of the illuminating body which occupies the focus, under pain of erring by excess or by default of divergence, at least to have recourse to the special profiles, allow the use of appa ratus of more restricted dimensions, that is to say, those of 0.30m., for lights to be illuminated by the electric light. A flame of that kind has no more than from 0.01m. or 0.012m. to 0.015m. of elevation, and the divergence in the vertical plane of one of these small apparatus is only about 6'; it is very near that of an apparatus of the first order. as has been found by experiment. It has been determined, besides, that it was necessary to have re course to new dispositions for the catadioptric rings of the apparatus. They have been calculated for the same focus as the lens, and the manner to return the .luminous rays, uot horizontally, but tangentially, to the surface of the sea. Finally, the smallness of the electric flame does not allow of the prolonging of the uprights of the armature in the entire height of the apparatus, for they would almost totally obscure it, and at the same time would direct the joints and indented work of the lenticular profile of the apparatus, not in following the horizontals, as is done ordinarily, but according to the direction which is taken in the interior of the glass after a first refraction of the rays emanating from the focus."], [84, "76 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. The Figure 22 represents an apparatus of a fixed light disposed in view of the new mode of producing light. APPARATUS FOR OIL OF SCHISTE, OR PETROLEUM, The form of the tiames produced by the oil of schiste, or of petro leum, also requires special apparatus. The Profile 7 of Plate 3 has been established for double current of air lamps, as those whose burner and flame are repre sented by Figure 10 of Plate 15. The cen tre of the flame, or rather that of the mushroom, has been taken for the focus of dioptric lenses, and the focus of the cata dioptric rings has been placed at the same height, but to 0.017m. of the axis, upon the side of the flame the most distant from the profile for the high, and upon the side the nearest for the first of those below. The fo- Fig. 22. cus of the lower ring has been more eccen tric still, and carried I ii ii ii l 'i I (hi i i lit Bd i>l in-.il Brtlrrt to Brill- Aluminous the |ll<H below. The little height of the flame renders also the divergence in SecOe of Centimetres. the vertical plane notably inferior to that which is produced by appa ratus of the same order, illuminated by colza oil; and for the joints of the dioptric profile, a disposition has been adopted analogous to that which was referred to in speaking of the electric light. It is understood that the lens apparatus is susceptible of extremely varied forms, and it belongs to the engineers to adopt, in each particu-"], [85, "77 DIOPTRIC APPARATUS. lar case, those which appear the best adapted to the circumstances. Further on, numerous examples will be given. LUMINOUS INTENSITIES OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE APPA- RATUS.

Intensities of the luminous beams on eaeh side of the axis of the apparatus. The figures of these two tables have been established by reducing of about one-tenth those which have been obtained in our experiments, to compensate for the practical imperfections, besides in diminishing the results one-tenth more, ou account of the absorption of the plate glass of the lantern. MODE OF CONSTRUCTING THE LENSES. The glass of Saint Gobain is used exclusively in the construction of our lenses. The manufacture has been greatly improved \u2022within a few years, and leaves but little to be desired now. Lt is free from color, hard, homogeneous, and absorbs but a small portion of the rays which pass through it ; takes a very beautiful polish ; resists the action of the atmosphere perfectly, and contains but a very small number of air bubbles, or of stri\u00e6. Its composition is actually as follows : Silica 72.1 Soda ' 12.2 Chalk 7 15.7 Alumina and oxid of iron, traces loo.o Its index of refraction, which was formerly 1.50, has been actually raised to 1.54. The glass is run into iron moulds of the proper dimensions for the required pieces to be worked, after which the unpolished glass is placed upon the turning lathes, put in motion by a steam engine, where it is tinned in a way to give it the exact forms prescribed, and until a perfect polish is made. That operation takes time, and requires the services of skilled workmen. ~ .

The correctness of the work is determined by the method of conjugate focii. In calculating the lenses, regard is had to the reduction, as far as possible, of the thickness of the glass, so as to diminish the absorption of the luminous rays ; but, in doing so, a certain limit canuot be exceeded for fear of failing to obtain the required solidity, of rendering the construction too difficult, aud above all, of incurring too great expense. These considerations, and the progress which has been made within a short time in the moulding of glass, have led Engineer Degrand to think that this last mode of construction may be advantageously ap plied to the establishment of lenses in echelon, which will allow the thickness to be considerably reduced. It is expanding the idea of Buf fon, but with better incentives, and much greater chances of success. The glass is run into the cast-iron moulds, turned with the greatest precision in regard to reentering angles, and the small apparatus thus made have been very successful in their results. It has not, unfortu nately, been so in others. The economy of luminous rays resulting from the reduction of the thickness of the glass has not compensated for the dispersion due to the irregularity of the surface, and, from all calcula tions made, it does not appear that the new process is susceptible of extension in the present state of glass manufacture. The apparatus represented on the Plate 10, and by the Figures 5, 6, 7, and 8 of Plate 12, have been constructed of mould glass. TIL\u2014COMPARISON OF THE TWO SYSTEMS OF APPARATUS. The superiority of the dioptric apparatus to the catoptric will be seen by the following facts : 1st. The reflection upon the most highly polished metallic surfaces absorbs more of the luminous rays than the passage of those rays through lenses of a proper thickness. 2d. According to the dimensions in general use, which have been very judiciously adopted, the divergence of the luminous rays is very much greater in the catoptric apparatus than in the others, and a great part of that divergence cannot be utilized. 3d. The dioptric apparatus allows the distribution of the light uui formly upon the entire or only a part of the horizon, which cannot be properly done with the catoptric apparatus, unless by multiplying the reflectors out of proportion, except with those which have received the name of \" Sideral Apparatus,\" which are not capable of producing a great luminous intensity."], [88, "80 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. 4th. Flashes of much greater intensity are obtained from dioptric apparatus than from the most powerful catoptric apparatus. These last apparatus possess ahvays the advantage over the dioptric in the economy of expense iu first fitting or establishing the lights; but this merit is nearly always counterbalanced by the great increase in annual expense of the catoptric, as compared with the dioptric lights. In other words, the useful effect of the dioptric apparatus is far beyond that of the catoptric, as will be shown by some examples. Let us take, for comparison, not the quantity of light emanating from the apparatus, but that which is sent or brought into the horizontal plane. This last alone imports, in effect, as regards the object which we have in view, inasmuch as, directed, as it is said, tangentially to the surface of the sea, it determines the range of the light under ordinary circumstances of the atmosphere. It is evident, that no account can be taken of the rays thrown above the horizontal plane, for they are entirely lost. As for those which descend below, they are no doubt useful to the maritime illumination ; but it is to be remarked that in all of our apparatus, being more numerous than would be rigorously necessary, since the apparent intensity of the light increases in pro portion as the foot of the tower is approached, in the whole extent of the zone which it is required to illuminate. There is, it is true, some interest to have during foggy weather a great number of plunging rays, but it is known that under these atmospheric circumstances it is necessary to have au enormous difference between the intensities, to obtain a slight increase of range. Thus, the divergence below the horizontal plane becomes habitually useless so soon as it passes a cer tain limit, which is greatly affected in dioptric apparatus, and for which there is no real interest to look for in foggy weather. There is theu authority to leaye it out. The useful effect of an illuminating apparatus may be deduced from the formula L I+D' in which L is designed to represent the quantity of light ; by I the annual interest of the cost of the purchase ; and by 13 the annual ex pense of keeping up the light, including the consumption of oil, wicks, chimneys, salaries of the keepers, keeping the apparatus in order, the repairs, &c. The cost of the unity of light sent to the horizon, is I+D L If the comparison between the apparatus of the two systems should be made the occasion of the establishment of a new light-house it would be necssary to operate with exactness, include in the value of I"], [89, "81 COMPARISON OF THE TWO SYSTEMS OF APPARATUS. the interest of the sum required, or that will be required, for the con- struction of the edifice. APPARATUS OF THE FOURTH ORDER. Let us first compare the small apparatus, illuminated by the same lamps, a reflector, (photophore,) a \" sideral\" apparatus, and an apparatus of mould glass, such as is represented by Figure 6, Plate 12, each en closed in a small movable lantern, and allow that the two last ought to illuminate the entire circumference. The quantity of light sent to the horizon by the \" photophore \" should be represented by the sum of the mean intensities of each illuminated degree, and those which corre spond to the other apparatus, should have for expression the product of the intensity multiplied by 360. According to the following figures, the quantities of luminous rays distributed in the horizontal plane are : For the photophore 1005 b.

Twenty -four reflectors of 0.29m. of opening, illumi nated by lamps consuming 50 grammes of oil per hour, being uniformly placed around the circumference, would give a fixed light whose in tensity would be of about 67 burners, and whose estimated value for the entire horizon would reach, according to what has been heretofore said, to 24,120 burners. The inherent expenses of this sort of apparatus may be set down at 13,698 francs, as follows: Twenty-four lamps and reflectors 1608. 00 Jr. Armature, lantern, different kinds of supplies, trans- portation, and placing as above stated 12090.00 Total 13698. 00 From which I = 684.90 Jrs.

APPARATUS OF THE TAVO LARGEST ORDERS. To spread around the entire horizon, with a catoptric apparatus, a quantity of light comparable to that which would be produced by a fixed lens-light apparatus of the second order, it woidd be necessary to have one hundred reflectors of 0. 59m., consuming 50 grammes of oil per hour, or of sixty reflectors of 0. o$m., consuming 61) grammes. The luminous intensity of the lens apparatus being 335 burners; that of the reflector apparatus reaches to 279 burners in the first case, and varies in the second from 350 to 352 burners. The hourly consumption of oil by the two apparatus would be, respectively, 500, 5,000, and 3,600 grammes. Besides, the placing and attendance of the catoptric apparatus of this description would present such difficulties to be overcome that none have ever been constructed, and it therefore appears to be useless to push the comparison further. Should it be a question of a light of the first order, it would be found that, while the lens apparatus consuming 760 grammes per hour sends upon the entire horizon 630 burners, sixty reflectors of 0. 85m., wfiose consumption reaches to 3,600 grammes, would only give an intensity varying from 550 to 630 burners. But a similar apparatus would be much less allowable still than those already spoken of, of the second order, and consequently there is no occasion to say more in regard to these. It is necessary, however, to add \u2014 to point out that which is true and to omit nothing having an important bearing on the subject \u2014 that if it should become necessary not to illuminate the entire horizon, as has been discussed, but a small angular space, the catoptric system will at once lose its want of power and its superiority in an economical point of view. Thus, let us suppose that the luminous rays only are to be"], [93, "COMPARISON OF THE TWO SYSTEMS OF APPARATUS. 85 distributed iu an angle of 45% it will require but eight reflectors of 0.85m., with lamps of 1.60 b., to have about the equivalent of an ordi nary lens apparatus of the first order; for, as has been already said, the dispositions employed to collect, in these last apparatus, the divergent rays towards the dead angle does not exercise a very great influence upon the augmentation of the range. The c nsumptiou of oil of the catoptric apparatus will diminish then to 480 grammes, while it had been 760 grammes with the lens. The expenses of first establishing and of maintaining would be, besides, about the same iu both systems. Doubtless it would not be difficult to conceive an arrangement of lenses better suited for a case like this than that which has been adopted, in case of a horizon exceeding one-half of the circumference; but it is easily conceived how inconvenient it would be, practically, to introduce a new type for each exceptional circumstance which might present itself. The only conclusion to arrive at, from what has pre ceded, is conformable to that which has been announced when the question of catoptric apparatus has been under consideration, and that is, that it recommends itself alone for illuminating very restricted angular spaces. From what has been said of lights of the two larger orders, required to illuminate not less than the half of the horizon, the comparison between the two systems can only be made with the eclipse-light appa ratus. We will limit ourselves to a single example, omitting all unnecessary details, except such as are required to put the question beyond all doubt.

The intensity of their flashes does not exceed 2,700 burners, and it was, consequently, greatly inferior to those of the light-houses fitted with lens of the two larger orders, with which they were compared. At the light-house at Ailly, near Dieppe, the reflectors are twelve, disposed in groups of three, and the maximum intensity of the flashes was 1,650 burners ; that is to say, little superior to that of an annular panel, complete, of the third order, embracing the eighth of the circumference, which gives 1,266 burners in the axis. It is, doubtless, unnecessary to insist longer with the view to make the merits of the new system fully appreciated. It is proper, however, to add to that which has been said already in regard to the superiority of the lens apparatus, that the attendance upon the lenses is much easier for the keepers, and consequently more sure and reliable than with the reflectors, as regards the economy of the luminous ray s IV.\u2014 COLORED LIGHTS. In pointing out the different characteristic distinctions given to the lights on the coasts of France, we have said that, after long hesitations, the Lights Commission (Commission des Phares) had allowed some of the lights to be distinguished by color, since it was established by satisfactory experiments that color did not cause the effect upon the ranges, which it was supposed up to that time was attributable to it. Some observations made upon red lights have put the engineers of the lighting service on the right track in this regard. One of them was often surprised at the brilliancy which these lights presented at long distances, and it was asked if the action which produced a red"], [96, "88 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. light upon the retina would not diminish in a less degree than that of the white light, in proportion as the distance increases.* It is known that, in clothes, paintings, glass, it is almost always tin red color which strikes the sight the most vividly, and it is known also, that the blue and green, complimeiitaries of the orange and of red, afford to weak eyes a kind of relief, while the red produces upon them an impression almost painful, and, at the same time, to have for that organ fatal results, if prolonged beyond a certain limit. The first condition to make of the experiments, for solving, if not rigorously, at least with a sufficiently close approximation, the problem which is presented, was to compare the power of lights of different colors, and to see if they are of the same intensity, or rather if they are equivalent as to visibility. But, in placing before a photometer, arranged as has been said before, two lights, one red, the other white, and in observing the two illuminated bands upon the screen, it is proved that, according as one of the lights is brought nearer, or moved further off from the instrument, the illuminated band, which corre sponds to it, appears sometimes more and sometimes less brilliant than the near one, or, in other words, is sometimes more and sometimes less visible than the latter. Whatever may be the difference of coloration, a great nicety or sharpness may be given to that sensation of inequality between the two bands, in moving away properly one of the lights to be compared. It is conceivable, then, that a certain practice of the experiments of this sort, aud some groping, permits the restricting more aud more the limits on the side of which there is certain inequality, and to arrive at a determination thus, in an approximative manner, of the photometric distances corresponding to equality. The appreciations of one observer differ sufficiently little, to allow the accordance of a certain scientific value to the means deduced from a great number of measurements; but all the organs are not affected in the same way by color, the judg ments of different persons may be dissimilar, as will be seen further on. That granted, the photometric experiments, although made necessa rily at short distances, show that the law which obtains as to the decrease of visibility of colored lights, is not that of the square of the distances, which belongs to the white light. For the red, for example, if the observer placed near the photometer has established the equality between the two bands in separating properly the lights, and if it comes then further off, the red band will appear more brilliant than the white, and the difference will be much more marked, as it is further from the instrument. If it is desired to maintain the equality, it will become necessary to bring back the white light in proportion as it is moved * A memoir has been presented, iu 1858, to the Academy of Sciences by Monsieur the Engineer Degraud and myself."], [97, "COLORED LIGHTS. 89 further from the photometer. The reverse takes place when the color is green or blue; the comparative value of the colored light diminishes as the distance increases. Numerous experiments have put these phenomena beyond doubt; some of them will be given. It is known that color is obtained by placing colored glass before the the lamp, or by surrounding the flame by a colored chimney. Both systems are employed in our lights, but recourse was had only to the first in the experiments referred to. The red color is produced by the salts of copper, silver, or gold, and the shades which correspond to them are, respectively, red with a deep purple tint, orange red more or less intense, aud the rose red. The first of these colors is the most marked, aud appears to absorb the most of the luminous rays, when observed at a short distance; the last possesses the opposite properties. The tones above all of those of red, from copper and from silver, vary otherwise, between sufficiently extended limits. Observations have been made by many persons who were successively placed at different distances from the photometer. The light taken for unity has been, as ordinarily, that of a carcel lamp consuming 40 grammes of oil per hour; but colored glass was also placed before lights of greater inten sity, so as to have the colors sufficiently bright upon the photometer. The intensities of these last flames have been otherwise very exactly appreciated by the observations made before the interposition of the colored glass. These glasses were placed at 0.30\u00bbh. in front of the flames, and the photometer was 5 metres distant. The following table shows the results of the experiments; the ob served luminous intensities are expressed in the same way as of those which had given the same light not colored : * The figures marked with an asterisk show anomalies and indicate an accidental and sudden modification in the flash of the flame. The observations upon the green and the blue cannot be relied upon, the first beyond six metres, the second beyond two metres, because the colored belts were not very apparent.

The figures may appear to be too greatly multiplied; but they relate to phenomena which have not been before signalized, and are of great importance to maritime illumination.

It will lie remarked, that in the red lights the greater part of the reports are much higher as the color is intense, and that the copper red, which absorbs most of the light at short distances, is that which gains the most in proportion as it is observed further off. Experiments made with more powerful apparatus, seen at the distance of several kilometres, have equally shown, as will be soon seen, that it ends by being longer visible than the silver red. The Figure 2'.i, following this, represents, in a manner perhaps more striking than is shown by figures, the results arrived at in the last Fig. 23. column of the first of these tables. It has been constructed by carry ing the distances of the observer to the photometer upon the axis of the abscissa*, on a scale of 0. 015m. per meter, and the luminous inten-"], [100, "92 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. sities on the axis of the ordi nates, or 0. 15m. expresses the value of the un colored light. The broken line 1 is that of the gold red; the lines 2 and 3 those of the silver red; the lines \u00b1 and .5 belong to the copper red ; and the lines 0 and 7 are green. The blue, only having been observed twice, is rep resented by a right line, (8.) In all the experiments it was sought, as far as possible, to guard against the influence which arises from accidental colors, and care was always taken to manage the photometer in such a way as to separate the white band from the colored one, by a black band of sufficient extent to prevent that source of error, which had given a green tint to the white when placed by the side of the red, or a red tint in the ex periments upon green. The black band should produce, it is true, a contrast; but the white does not feel it less than the colored bands, and the effect was, otherwise, independent of the position of the observer. Other experiments, made at greater distances, seemed to possess a greater value iu a practical point of view. In the first, five flames have been regulated in such a way, that, four of them being covered with red glass of the copper, silver, or gold, they all appeared to be of the same intensity to the photometer observed at 0.80m. distant. That intensity had been fixed at 0.005m. of the carcel burner, so that it might reach the limits of the ranges without going outside of the circuit of the Champ de Mars, in which the experiments were made. The sky was clear, the night still, aud the observers, to the number of four, have reported as follows : 1. At a distance of about .500 metres, the white light ceased to be seen, whilst the red light, except that of the gold, was still bright. 1.'. At 750 metres, the same lights remained visible, but the red dis tinction was not distinct, except of the light which had been covered bjT a glass of deep copper-red color, whose absorption had been esti mated at T9o9o of the white light. Another series of experiments was made with more powerful lights of parabolic reflectors of 0.29m. of opening, illuminated by lamps of an intensity equal to 1.30 b., and giving consequently in their axes flashes whose intensity may be estimated perhaps at 00 burners for the white light. Before two of them copper-red panes of glass of different shades were placed, and before another a silver-red pane of glass. Two white reflectors have been brought back byuncolored panes, or of stone color or Spanish white, to present the same intensity at a short distance as the colored reflectors. The lights were too intense, even to the limits of their range. The observations were not carried bevond 3,300 metres; but the intensity of the red lights was always found to"], [101, "COLORED LIGHTS. 93 be, as compared to the white lights, apparently increasing with the distance. At 800 metres, the five lights presented sensibly the same intensity : at 1,400 metres, there was a difference very appreciable in favor of the red lights; at 3,300 metres, these last, aud especially those of the copper, exceeded greatly the others. Two reflectors alike, the one covered with a copper-red glass, the other white, have been observed at that same distance of 3,300 metres. The report of their intensities, measured at a short distance, was \u2014 L 1 20' and yet the first appeared more brilliant than the second. Of analogous expei-iinents made with green and blue, results diame trically opposite to the preceding were obtained. All the colors lose their character when the limit of their range is approached, and end by being no longer appreciable ; but that effect is much more marked with the green and blue than the red, and with the gold-red than the others, and, above all, with the copper red. It is essential to add that all the experiments have been made during a clear and transparent atmosphere, so that the property of some fogs to give lights a red color has been without sensible action upon the phenomena. The white lights remain uncolored to the limits of their ranges. During the fogs referred to, the red are still more superior to the others, for they have little effect upon them, while they only allow the red rays of the white lights to pass, and diminish the green lights rapidly after having brought them back to white. On this subject the following experiment may be cited : Five reflectors, producing about 60 burners of white light in the axis, have been observed during fog. The light of the first was white, that of the second colored gold red, that of the third copper red, that of the fourth green, and that ol the last blue. The white light and the red light ceased to be seen at the distance of 1,600 metres; the color of gold red was distinguished with difficulty at 1,500 metres, whilst that of the copper-red light was .sufficiently well marked. The green light disappeared at 1,000 metres and the blue light at 530 metres. Finally, the observations made at long distances upon the red-colored lights in light-houses lead to the same conclusions as those of which account is about to be given, and in recurring to the subject may recall that which has already been said in regard to the light at Pontaillac. It has been admitted, consequently, in the light service, that the red color, by a glass of copper-red color of suitable shade, will not reduce the intensity of the white light more than a quantity comprised between one-half and two-thirds, or in other words, that to obtain a red light and a white light of the same range in ordinary states of the atmos phere, it will be sufficient to allow to the first two to three times more"], [102, "94 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. of white rays than to the second. There is doubtless not much pre cision in this rule, but it may be said that the subject does not admit of it. It is upon this basis that apparatus are established in which the red beams alternate with white ones. Thus, the apparatus of the first order, represented by the Figures 5 and 0 of the Plate 5, produces a light of eclipses in every twenty seconds, in which a red flash alternates with a white flash, and its cupola has been so arranged that all the luminous rays which it sends out are added to those which come from the colored panels of the drum and the lower rings. The apparatus of the third order, Figures 7, 8, and !\u00bb of the same plate, presents a fixed light, which is produced by the greater part of the dioptric drum, as well as by the catadioptric rings below, and this light is varied by alternate red and green flashes every twenty seconds, produced by annular panels, which are dioptric in the lower part and catadioptric above. In white lights the fixed light is equivalent to 60 burners, and each of the panuels will give in the axis of flash of 420 burners, which is reduced to about 150 burners at 2\u00b0 on each side. The colored flashes are seen a little further than the white light, and those which are green are seen at a less distance than the others, especially during fogs. Fig. 24. The sketch opposite represents the plan of an apparatus equal to the third order, whose dispositions in general come near the preceding, but which is designed for a fixed light varied by flashes every half minute, alternately red and white, without intervening eclipses. The large sides A B, C D, E F, G H, of the polygon, which forms the base of the mova ble part, belong to the panels which are required to produce the red rays ; the angular spaces which they em brace are double of those which cor respond to the white panels. When Vs\"To jiucler. there is no fog, the range of the white flashes is a little greater than the others. MODE OF COLORING. In the fixed lights the flame is covered by a colored chimney. In the eclipse-light apparatus sheets of colored glass are placed ou one side or the other, opposite the lenses which are to produce the colored"], [103, "TYPES OF APPARATUS. 95 flashes. They are mounted upon the bronze frames so as to be opened to allow dusting and cleaning of the glass itself, and also of the lenses. V.\u2014 TYPES OF APPARATUS. The disposition of the illuminating apparatus varies according to the conditions to be satisfied. We shall limit ourselves here to giving the principal actual types of the apparatus most in use upon the coasts of France, or which present the greatest degree of interest. 1 . APPARATUS OF THE FIRST-ORDER FIXED LIGHT. The Figures 1 and 2 of Plate 5 represent the plan and elevation of that apparatus;* its section is shown by Figure 1 of Plate 6, to the right. The Figure 2 of the same plate shows the elevation of one of its panels, which embraces an eighth of the circumference, and com prises eighteen catadioptric rings above the dioptric drum and eight below it. The fourth of the horizontal section of the apparatus occu pies the angle C of the Figure 1 of Plate 4. The plan of the lamp is represented in d upon that last figure. Intensity of the apparatus - 630 burners; Range in ordinary states of the atmosphere 20. 2 miles. The Figures 1 of Plate 1 represent the distribution, the intensity, and the range of the luminous rays produced by an apparatus of this sort. 2. APPARATUS OF THE FIRST-ORDER FIXED LIGHT, VARLED BY FLASHES EVERY FOUR MINUTES. This apparatus does uot differ from the preceding one but in having three vertical element lenses at equal distances revolving around the drum, which they encircle through their entire height. They each sub tend an angle of 34\u00b0 12', and they collect into beams the luminous rays already refracted by the cylindrical lens. The flashes which they pro duce are preceded and followed by eclipses of less duration than those of other revolving lights. These eclipses are, however, not total, ex cept at great distances, since nothing obstructs the way of the rays. sent out through the catadioptric rings. After the fixed light produced by the entire apparatus, comes a dimness very well marked, which con stitutes a total eclipse beyond the distance of 16. 2 miles under ordinary states of the atmosphere, and whose duration is about twenty seconds. at a short distance; then presents a very brilliant flash, which is sue- * Plate 3 gives, upon a large scale, the different lenticular profiles actually in use."], [104, "96 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. ceeded by an eclipse similar to the preceding one, and followed by tlie fixed light. The Figures 5 of the Plate 1 represent the distribution, intensity, and form of the luminous beams answering to these different conditions of the light. The left side of the Figure 1 of the Plate 6 shows a section of the apparatus taken through the axis of one of the vertical element lenses, and the Figure 3 is an elevation of one of these lenses. The fourth of the horizontal section of the same apparatus occupies the angle B of the Figure 1 of Plate 4, where, at c, the revolving machine is shown. Thus, as has been said iu treating of the general dispositions of the illuminating apparatus, recourse is only had to vertical element lenses but for lights having a dead angle of 45\u00b0 or less. For those which are required to illuminate the entire horizon, annular lenses are introduced in the drum, and the entire system receives the movement of rotation, as shown by the small apparatus of Plate 11. Habitual intensity of the fixed light, 030 burners ; range, 20. 2 miles. Intensity of the fixed light during the eclipses, 190 burners; range, 16. 2 miles. Intensity of the flash, 4,000 burners; range, 27. 0 miles. 3. APPARATUS OF THE FIRST-ORDER ECLIPSE LIGHT, ONCE EVERY MINUTE, (PROLONGED FLASHES.) The Figures 3 and 4 of Plate 5 give the plan and elevation of that apparatus, the half of the horizontal section of which is represented on the left side of Figure 1 of Plate 4. The Figure 1 of Plate 7 gives, to the left, a section taken, following the axis of one of the panels of the drum, and to the right, a section directed through one of the angles of the polygon. The Figure 2 of the |same plate, is the elevation of one of the panels of the apparatus. The annular catadioptric leus shows in horizontal projection an angle of 4\" with that of the drum to which it is attached, in a way to increase the duration of the flash, and the lower catadioptric rings constitute the fixed light. The drum and the catadioptric crown only are put in motion by the revolving ma chinery. That machine is seen in elevation and section, and indicated at c on the plan. The Figures 2 of the Plate 1 represent the distribution, intensity, and the form of the luminous beams of that apparatus. Intensity of the flashes, 5,075 burners; range, 27.9 miles. Intensity of the fixed light between the flashes, 60 burners; range, 12.7 miles."], [105, "97 TYPES OF APPARATUS. 4. APPARATUS OF THE FIRST-ORDER OF ECLIPSES, ONCE EVERY THIRTY SECONDS, (PROLONGED FLASHES.) This apparatus differs from the preceding one, in so far that the reg ular polygon which forms its base is composed of sixteen sides instead of eight. The Figure 3 of the Plate 7 represents one of its faces, and the Figure 3 of Plate 1 shows its effect. Intensity of the flashes, 2,525 burners; range, 25.2 miles. Intensity of the fixed light between the flashes, 60 burners; range, 12.7 miles. 5. APPARATUS OF THE FIRST-ORDER OF ECLIPSES, ONCE IN EVERY TWENTY SECONDS AND BELOW. The number of sides of the polygon of this apparatus is twenty-four, and, the luminous appearances being in very quick succession, it has not been judged necessary to prolong the duration of the flashes, nor to preserve a fixed light between the intervals; each dioptric panel has two catadioptric annular panels placed upon the same axis with it. The Figure 4 of Plate 7 gives the elevation of one of the faces of the apparatus, which turn entirely around. The armature, the lower cata dioptric panels, and the drum, are disposed, as may be seen by the Figure 6 of the Plate 5. In the revolving apparatus, which is to be described, the lower zone is fixed, which allows entrance to the interior, by a passage through an open ring, which occurs when it is not neces sary to illuminate the entire horizon, or when the fixed light in a space of 45\u00b0 may be dispensed with; but here, the movement of rotation being given to the whole apparatus, it becomes necessary to have recourse to a special arrangement, so that the keeper may reach the lamp without arresting the revolutions of the apparatus. The place of entrance has been lowered for that purpose ; the uprights which rest upon the chariot are brought together in such a way as not to obstruct the passage around the foot of the apparatus; they are only six in number, and three steps lead to the landing on the service table. The Figures 4 of Plate 1 point out the distribution, and show the intensity and form of the luminous beams emanating from an apparatus of this sort. The upper figure shows, to the left, the flashes which suc ceed each other every twenty seconds, and, to the right, flashes with only three seconds between them. Intensity of the flashes, 2,450 burners; range, 25. 1 miles. 6. APPARATUS OF THE FIRST ORDER OF ECLIPSES, OF TWENTY SECONDS' INTERVALS AND BELOW, IN WHICH A RED FLASH ALTER- NATES WITH A WHITE ONE. This apparatus is represented in plan and elevation by the Figures 5 and 6 of Plate 5. The panels of the lower zone aud of the drum are F L 7"], [106, "98 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. twenty-sour in number, and there are but twelve in the upper zone. Two of the first produce white flashes ; and to constitute red flashes, one of the last is added to them. The color is given by pieces of plane glass placed in the interior of the apparatus, before the lenses. Those of the two first zones are vertical, the others are inclined, and form a kind of pyramidal roof. All are fitted in light bronze frames, which open with hinge joints. Intensity of the white flashes, 1,825 burners; range, 24 miles. Intensity of the three superposed panels, if not fitted with red glass, 3,075 burners. By recalling what has been said about the absorption of the luminous rays by color, it may be judged from these figures that, under ordinary circumstances of atmosphere, the white flashes ought to have a little greater range than the red ones. In an apparatus of this description, which illuminates the light-house at the Point of Creac'h, (Isle of Ouessant,) two white flashes alternate with one red. The upper cupola is divided then into eight panels, and the intensity of the colored flashes would reach 3,725 burners if they were white. About double the quantity of luminous rays is employed for the red flashes as for the others, from which it follows that the range of the two kinds of beams is about the same. This last charac teristic is, under this aspect, preferable to the preceding. The intensity of the red flashes of this last, might, it is true, be aug mented byr applying to she first zone the same disposition as to the third ; but that woidd have been at the expense of the white flashes, whose intensities were found to be insufficient. 7. APPARATUS OF THE SECOND-ORDER FIXED LIGHT. This apparatus is similar to that of the first order, differing only in dimensions and the number of rings. The half plan of this apparatus is represented by the part B of the Figure 2 of Plate 4 ; the half section is seen to the right upon the Figure 1 of Plate 8. The Figure 2 of the same plate gives the elevation of one of these panels which embraces one-sixth of the circumference. Intensity of the light, 335 burners ; range, 18 miles. 8. APPARATUS OF THE SECOND ORDER OF ECLIPSES. The apparatus of the second order of eclipse lights are similar to those of the first order. The sides of the polygon are eight in number when the intervals are one minute, and twelve only Avhen the flashes succeed each other every thirty seconds. The number of panels is not doubled as in the first order, to prevent too great a reduction of the intensity. The apparatus takes only six minutes to complete its entire"], [107, "99 TYPES OF bVPPARATFS. revolution instead of eight minutes, and the duration of the flashes is reduced in like manner. These flashes are prolonged, as in the first order, by the panels of the cupola. When the interval of the eclipses is twenty seconds and below, the number of panels is increased to twenty, the fixed light is suppressed, and all the lenses of a panel are placed upon the same axis. In the apparatus of the second order, varied by flashes, the vertical element lenses always embrace an angular space of 433 40', and only cover the drum. To the left of the Figure 2, Plate 4, and of Figure 1, Plate 8, is rep resented the half of the plan and half of the section of an apparatus of the second order, whose eclipses succeed each other every thirty seconds. The Figure 3 of this last plate gives the elevation of one of these panels.

Intensity of the flash, 950 burners; range, 21. 6, 11. APPARATUS OF THE THIRD ORDER, VARIED BY FLASHES, WITH- OUT ECLIPSES. The arrangement which constitutes this new characteristic has been applied, for the first time, to the light of Walde, the lantern and appa ratus of which are represented upon Plate 10. The lower half of the drum, and the catadioptric rings above and below, constitute a fixed light, which spreads its rays upon the entire horizon, except in the dead angle on the land side. The upper part of the drum is composed of twelve annular half lenses; they revolve and produce the flashes, which succeed each other at intervals of every twenty seconds. The apparatus is illuminated bjT a lamp with two wicks, consuming 175 grammes of oil per hour. The cylindrical drum has only 0. 40m. of interior diameter. Finally, to render this light more characteristic, the annular half lenses of the drum are covered with red glass, aud embracing an angu lar space of 9D, which corresponds to the divergence of these lenses; bands of the same glass have been placed above and below in a way to color the fixed light, and to prevent the blending of the white rays with the others. The Figure 3 shows very neatly and clearly this arrangement. This apparatus has been constructed, not like the preceding ones, of polished glass, but of glass run simply in moulds prepared with great care. Intensity of the fixed light, 18 burners ; range, 9. 4 miles. Intensity of the uncolored flashes, 270 burners; range, 17.3 miles. The more important apparatus, which has not been spoken of yet, is treated in the same general way. One of them is represented in horizontal projection and in elevation by the Figures 7, 8, and 9 or Plate 5. The profile of its lenses is the same as has been adopted lately for third-order eclipse lights. The part which constitutes the fixed light is composed of the lower catadioptric rings, and of the cylindrical lens of the drum, including the first echelon which follows the joint ring; its height is 0. SOm. The movable part occupies the"], [109, "101 TYPES OF APPARATUS. summit of the apparatus, and is formed of ten annular panels, which embrace all the upper catadioptric rings and the five upper echelons of the drum. The lenses are in part dioptric and in part catadioptric. They are covered outside by colored glass, forming a drum having a decagonal base, which turns with it. Each of the faces is extended downwards by a small glass band, as in the apparatus of Walde, and for the same reason. The panels are colored alternately red and green, and the revolution is made in three minutes and twenty seconds. The apparatus then produces a fixed white light, varied, at intervals of twenty seconds, by alternate red and green flashes. The duration of each of these flashes is about two seconds at long distances. Intensity\" of the fixed light, 60 burners, range 12.7 miles. The intensity of the flash, when it is not colored, reaches to 420 burners in the axis, and falls to about 150 burners at 2\u00b0 ou each side. Under ordinary states of the atmosphere, the colored flashes have a greater range than the fixed light ; in foggy weather, the green flashes are soonest lost in leaving the light, as has already been stated when treating of colored lights. It may be remarked that the revolving machinery is placed in the pedestal which supports the apparatus ; that arrangement will be spoken of again, as the application of it has been multiplied lately. If the colored glass is removed, there will be a fixed light, varied at intervals more or less close, by flashes, which will be neither preceded nor followed byr eclipses. The Figure 11 of Plate 1 exhibits an apparatus of this kind, in which the flashes are not colored. 12. APPARATUS OF THE THIRD ORDER OF ECLIPSES. The apparatus of the third order of eclipses, once a minute or of thirty seconds, only differ in regard to dimensions from those of the second order of the same character ; the drum is composed in first case of eight lenses, and of twelve iu the second. It has not appeared to be necessary to give the drawings, which can be easily prepared accord ing to the elements already furnished to the reader, and it will suffice to say that the Figure 10 of Plate 1 represents the distribution, the intensity, aud the form of the luminous beams which emanate from an apparatus of that class of prolonged flashes whose eclipses succeed each other every thirty seconds. Whenever the interval of the flashes come down to twenty seconds and lower, the drum has for its base a polygon of sixteen sides, the fixed light between the flashes is suppressed, aud all the annular panels of each face are placed on the same axis, for the purpose of assuring to the flashes a suitable intensity."], [110, "102 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. Intensity of the flashes of a third-order eclipse apparatus. Once every minute: 845 burners; range, 21. 2 miles. Once every thirty seconds: 550 burners; range, 19. 7 miles. Once every twenty seconds and less: 590 burners; range, 20. 0 miles. Intensity of the fixed light between the flashes of the two first appa- ratus, 7 burners; range, 7.2 miles. 13. APPARATUS OF THE THIRD ORDER, (SMALL MODEL.) This name is given to apparatus of 0. 50m. diameter in the interior, illuminated by a double-wick lamp, which consumes 110 grammes of oil per hour. The Figure 13 of Plate 1 represents an apparatus for a fixed light of this description. Intensity, 30 burners; range, 10. 8 miles. The Plate 11 represents one of these apparatus, giving a fixed light varied by flashes. In place of being produced by lenses of vertical elements passing in front of the drum, the flashes are produced by annular lenses, including all the catadioptric rings. The eclipses which separate the fixed light from the flashes are total. In other apparatus of the same character, lenses of vertical elements, which only cover the drum and the lower catadioptric rings, are ad mitted. The Figures 10 and 11 of Plate 5 give the plan and elevation of an apparatus of this description, in which the flashes succeed each other at intervals of two or three minutes, according to the velocity of the revolving machinery. - The Figure 15 of Plate 1 renders an account of the effects of one ot these apparatus, in which the movable lenses only cover the drum, and where the intervals which separate the flashes are extended to three minutes. Eclipse apparatus of the same dimensions have been constructed. Some of them, composed of six annular panels, comprise the whole or a part of the height, and their flashes always succeed each other every minute. Others contain ten panels, and the intervals between their flashes descend to thirty seconds and less. The Figures 12 and 13 mi Plate 5 give the plan and elevation of an apparatus of that order, in which the eclipses succeed each other every minute. The upper catadioptric rings constitute a fixed light, which appears between the flashes which are produced by the aunular lenses com prising the drum and the lower catadioptric rings. The Figure 14 of Plate 1 represents the distribution, the intensity, and the form of the luminous beams emanating from an apparatus of the third order (small model) of eclipses, every twenty seconds, in which the fixed light is limited to the lower catadioptric rings. The intensity"], [111, "TYPES OF APPb\\.RATUS. 103 of the flashes reaches to 175 burners, and that of the fixed light to 2.5 burners. Intensity of the flashes of an eclipse light, with fixed light produced by the upper catadioptric rings. Once every minute: 275 burners; range, 17.4 miles. Once every thirty seconds and less: 165 burners; range, 15.7 miles. Intensity of the fixed light, 6 burners; range, 6.9 miles. Intensity of the flashes of an apparatus of total eclipses, similar to that ou Plate 11, 340 burners; range, 18.1 miles. 14. APPARATUS OF THE FOURTH ORDER. The lens apparatus of the fourth order are of two principal dimen sions; those of 0.375m., the others of 0.30m. diameter in the interior. They are illuminated by single-wick lamps, whose diameter varies from 0.024m. (large burner) to 0.021m. (small burner) when colza oil is used. The Figures 1 and 2, 3 and 4, of Plate 12, represent two of these ap paratus for fixed lights, illuminating three-fourths of the horizon, and fitted with constant-level lamps. Recourse is had to moderator lamps when it is necessary to illuminate the entire horizon. There is nothing to prevent the establishing of eclipse lights upou these restricted dimensions, but there are none of them on the coast of France. The lights of short range are almost always placed in such a position that the navigators are interested in having them always visi ble, and as they are much less exposed than the others, to lead to mis takes. They only differ in color, and sometimes by the flashes succeed ing each other every two, three, or four minutes. The most of the apparatus of this order are actually illuminated by the oil of schiste or of petroleum, consuming 05 grammes per hour. The Figures 10 and 17 of Plate 1 show the effects produced, the first by an apparatus of 0.375m. diameter for a fixed light, the second by an apparatus of the same dimensions, in which the flashes which succeed each other every two minutes are produced by vertical element lenses of the same height as the apparatus, aud, consequently, accompanied by total eclipses. The Figures 5 and 6 of Plate 12 represent a small apparatus for a fixed light of 0.30m. diameter, which is made of mould glass. It has no catadioptric rings, but the height of its drum has been carried to 0.40m. Placed in a small lantern designed to be hoisted upon a spar, it is necessary to have it very light. The apparatus of this description do not admit of the use of the oil of schiste on account of the currents of air to winch they are exposed, and their intensity does not exceed about six burners, but they are"], [112, "104 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS, better under all circumstances than the sideral apparatus which they succeed. One of the constructors, Mr. L. Sautter, constructs these apparatus in cut glas-, which are somewhat better than the others. The Figures 7 and 8 of the same plate give the elevation and section of an apparatus of mould glass designed for a range light. The rays which would diverge to the side of the land are brought back by a spherical reflector, the others are refracted by a large annular lens. Such of these last as would come in contact with the plane of the lens, under too open an angle, are divided first of all by a small conical lens. The Figures 9 and 10 represent the elevation and the section of an apparatus of the same kind, which has been constructed in cut glass. It is composed equally of a reflector and au annular lens ; but that lens is formed in part of dioptric and iu part of catadioptric rings. It has more intensity and less divergence than the other. .Neither the one nor the other of these apparatus has come up to the expectations of their constructors; they possess less merit than the large reflectors of 0.95m. diameter. The drawings have only been reproduced to state the fact and to meet objections. The Figures 11, 12, and 13 of Plate 12 give the plan, front elevation, and the lateral elevation of a single-sheet reflector or photophore of 0.29/h. of opening, which is mounted on a pedestal aud illuminated by a constant-level lamp fed by colza oil. These small apparatus, which are very economical, are usually placed upon a table in front of one of the windows of the light-keeper's house, and are frequently used for forming a range-light line. Lastly, the Figures 14 and 15 represent a sideral apparatus, fitted in a movable lantern. Apparatus of 0. 375m. of fixed light. Lamp of large burner : intensity, 13 burners ; range, 8. 6 miles.

Plate 13 shows the drawings of an apparatus for a floating fixed light, placed in its lantern. As has been already stated, this apparatus is composed of ten reflectors of 0.29m. of opening, lighted each by a constant-level lamp, consuming 50 grammes of colza oil per hour, aud whose burner is not placed in the focus of the paraboloid, for the reason that the luminous rays should not be too unequally distributed in the plane of the horizon. The curve b b b of Figure 9, page 50, shows the distribution of these rays. The maximum of intensity reaches to 38 burners, and the minimum to 18. The rauge is com prised between 11.4 and 9.4 miles. Each lain]) reposes upon a small chair of iron, to which it is attached by two clamps, and carries its reflector fixed in the same way. It is so arranged that the centre of gravity of the upper reservoir finds itself upon the same vertical as that of the lower cup when the reflec: tor is in its normal position. That position \u2014 that is to say, the hori zontality of the axis \u2014 is assured by means of a leaden weight placed under the reservoir. 'Each reflector is suspended in such a manner that it oscillates in every direction independently of the motion of the vessel ; the chair which supports it turns upon two axes in the same plane, parallel to each other, normal to the paraboloid. The amplitude of the movement in each direction does not exceed 60\u00b0. It is indicated on the Figures 5 and 6 by the dotted lines. The suspension rings of the ten lamps and reflectors are fixed upon a horizontal circle made of bronze, which move by means of rollers upon a fixed circle of the same material, whose section is in the form of"], [114, "106 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. armor plates. The lateral frictions are reduced by small horizontal rollers to the number of ten. The fixed circle is supported by four up rights, which constitute the fulcrum of the lantern arouad the mast. The movable circle is sustained during the night by a clutch, in such a position that each reflector is kept in the axis of one of the pj.uels of the lantern. This lantern is decagonal in shape. It is 1.44m. in diameter, between two opposite uprights, and 1 metre in height, exclusive of the cornice. Glazed in its upper part 0.46m. in height, it is closed everywhere else by sheets of copper, and in every alternate panel it is open below by a door of two sides. The dark panel panes open below; their frames slide in the lateral grooves arranged upon the uprights. ByT means of these doors, the interior sides of the panes of glass are cleaned ; one pane is lowered for the purpose of lighting, to remove the reflectors, or to replace them and the lamps, &c. The ventilation by means of ten ventilators, placed in the bottom of the lantern, whose movable part can be opened more or less; the dis engagement of the products of the combuston is effected by means of chimneys in position, as shown by the section of Figure 2, in such a way that the external air cannot penetrate the lantern with sufficient force to cause the flames to become unsteady. The lantern slides up and down the mast in attaching its four interior uprights to as many directing ledges, aud two of these uprights carry jaws which embrace the corresponding ledges. That disposition is shown by the Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4. Two vertical rods of iron traverse the lantern, are sustained byT a screw on the lower circle, and are fastened at their top by- the suspension chain. The lantern is con structed entirely of bronze, except the panels, which are of copper. The total weight of the apparatus and its lantern may be estimated at 830 kilogrammes.* Fig. 1.

An apparatus for a floating eclipse light is represented on Plate 14. The reflectors are eight in number. They are 0.37m. of opening, and illuminated by constant-level lamps, consuming 00 grammes of colza oil per hour, and whose flames are placed in the focus of the parabola. * 1 kilogramme = 2,206 pounds."], [115, "TYPES OF APPARATUS. 107 The maximum of intensity of the luminous beams emanating from one of these apparatus may be put down practically at 100 burners ; the divergence in the horizontal plane is about 30\u00b0. The range in the axis is 14. 2 miles. The lamps and reflectors are arranged similar to those described. The revolving movement is communicated to the circle which supports them by a large fixed-tooth wheel upon the upper surface of the circle. That wheel, whose teeth are turned towards the side of the mast, unites with a pinion placed at the summit of a vertical hollow iron shaft, which causes the revolutions of the machinery by the intermediary ot a toothed wheel and another pinion. That machine is moved by a weight which descends with little friction between four iron directing guides. It is placed below the deck at the foot of the mast. The revolving shaft is covered throughout its length above the deck by a half-cylinder of brass, which is fixed to a ledge nailed to the mast. Its foot carries a stem or point made of steel, which turns upon au agate set at the head in a glass which allows its elevation or depres sion by a small quantity. Its length is divided into three or four parts, and its parts are re united by boxes, which render them solid, so far as the rotation move ment is concerned, but allows them to dilate or contract without arresting the revolutions, when it bends a little under the action of a storm. A small door opens in the cylindrical covering of the shaft in front of each of the expansion boxes. Whenever the lantern is hoisted, its toothed wheel need not be fitted immediately with its pinion ; that last wheel is then hoisted by the first, and is rested upon it byr a spiral spring, which compels it to redescend from there by means of the movement of the machine, the teeth of each wheel being thus in their proper position. This spring is shown by Figure 6. It is important to provide the means of keeping the lantern lower during bad weather than in good, which may be done in the following manner: A pinion similar to that at the summit is fixed halfway up the shaft, and that last piece, as well as the large-toothed wheel of the apparatus, is maintained iu a certain position whenever it may be necessary to raise or lower the lantern, in such a way that nothing opposes its passage, and it may be stopped at either of the pinions. The clutches are raised before the machinery is put in motion. The lantern is the same in construction and arranged in the same manner as the preceding one, with the exception of the dimensions and the number of sides. Fig. 1. Section of the lantern aud of the mast taken along the line A B of the plan. The lantern is represented in the position which it occupies during the night, the directing shaft or rod, the revolving"], [116, "108 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. machine, and the motive weights are shown in elevation, and an alarm bell, o, is seen, which is sounded as soon as the motive weights come near the end of their course.

REVOLVING MACHINE \u2014 ACCESSORY CONSTRUCTIONS. Revolving machinery puts the movable parts of the apparatus in motion. They are moved by weights, and their number of revolutions is regulated by a flying pendulum. Always placed alongside of the apparatus, they are connected with it by a toothed wheel, so arranged as to be geared or thrown out of gear at will. The cord which sus pends the motive weights passes through the vault or the floor which supports the illuminating apparatus in a groove fitted for that purpose, and the weights sent by a roller and pulleys descend in a vertical enclosure fitted on one side of the tower. Some new apparatus have their revolving machinery placed in the foot of the armature, which has been enlarged iu consequence. The Figure 9 of the Plate 5 offers an example of this sort of arrangement. The weights are of about 75 kilogrammes in the revolving machine of first-order lights actually in use; it is muffled, and its estimated rate of speed is one metre per hour. Armatures. The armatures of the apparatus of the three largest orders are sup ported upon hollow cast-iron columns, which are screwed at their feet in the vault, and which are crowned by the table of the apparatus. That table, which was formerly of wood, is now of cast iron ; it is upon it that the keeper stands when it becomes necessary to touch the lamp. The tables of the first order are fitted with drawers, iu which different articles required iu the Service are kept. The uprights of iron which unite the tie pieces start from the table; they rise to the entire height of the drum, and the circle in which they are assembled above serves as the point of support for the catadioptric panels of the crown. These panels are sustained in their positions by screws, and are surmounted by a cross bar which holds the pin of the cent-rage in the fixed apparatus, aud carries iu the revolving apparatus"], [117, "TYPES OF APPbVRATUS. 109 the horizontal rollers, which move around a vertical iron collar fixed to the lantern. In eclipse lights the whole or a part of the armature is movable, according to the arrangement of the apparatus. The movement of rotation is operated upon a chariot of vertical rollers, which turn between the lower table of the movable apparatus and that which supports the capital of the cast-iron column. The horizontal rollers are introduced to reduce the friction. This latter table has been constructed heretofore iu wrought or cast iron, and was not long in becoming worn by the wheel-work and the action of the rollers ; at present it is constructed of steel, aud the rollers of bronze. The wear rests especially- upon these last works, which are easier to replace than the table, and are so arranged, besides, as to allow of their being renewed. The vertical rollers may be removed out or in ; they are fitted for that purpose with movable washers, which surround their axes and are applied at will to either of their faces. Lanterns. The lanterns are polygonal. The table below shows their forms and their uniform dimensions : The uprights, the fastenings, and the arcs of the cupolas of the lanterns of the three largest orders are constructed of iron. The uprights are covered outside by a strip of bronze fastened by screws and pewter solder. The sills and fastening are of bronze. The cupola is formed of sheets of copper secured by small bolts, fitted with covered joints, which are directed according to the meridians aud bolted after soldering in place. The fourth-order lanterns are of such restricted dimensions that the cupolas are constructed of one single piece, and are simply fixed to the upper tie. Iron is not used iu the construction of these small lanterns. The uprights are of bronze, as well as the ties. Heretofore the uprights were planted in the masonry walls, forming the bed of the lantern. Now they are placed ou the interior rim of the circle, and that plan has been found to give the advantage of augment ing the interior diameter of the sub-base, and the width of the small Order of light.

The first system is always retained for the greater part of the lights, where, on account of a deficiency of space, it is necessary to reduce as much as possible the diameter of the tower. The ventilation of the lantern is a most essential object, and many plans have been successively adopted with the view to render it as efficacious as possible. The object is twofold : to assist greatly in the consumption of the lamp, and to diminish the aqueous precipitations produced ou the interior of the lantern glass, which has the effect of reducing more or less the brilliancy of the light. A chimney, which is principally designed to carry off the products of combustion, and the air which the flame puts in motion, is fitted to the summit of the cupola. It is capped with a sphere pierced with holes at its lower part. In the lanterns of the three largest orders the air necessary for proper combustion comes through the hollow column designed for the descent of the lamp weights bythe half opened ladder door, and often by the open ventilators in the masonry sub-base of the lantern, which are adjusted by registers. The longitudinal openings, which are opened or closed at will, are employed, besides, iu the lower floors of the lantern, and above each of them. At the foot of the cupola is a small ventilating chimney which assists in expelling the hot air, and consequently iu bringing in cold air. The Plates 6, 7, 8, and 9 show these arrangements. A large copper basin is suspended in each lantern above the top of the apparatus to catch the falling drops of water, whether of nitrations or precipitations upon the cupola, which might fall upon the flame or chimney. It is represented upon all of the sections of lanterns. The glazing is done with panes of plate-glass of 0.008m. thickness. These panes are placed in the rabbets and kept in their positions by slats fixed bjr means of screws, as well upon the uprights as the traverses. Care must be taken to give about 0.002 of play all around the plate of glass to prevent, as far as possible, their rupture by the oscillations caused by tempests ; they rest upon small pieces of lead, after which they are puttied all around. Many panes of lantern glass have been broken, notwithstanding their thickness, by the shock of birds, such as ducks and geese, attracted by the brilliancy of the light. Nine of these panes of glass have been smashed in one night at the Cape Ferret light-house. At the Brehat lighthouse a wild goose passed between two courses of mirrors, after having gone through the lantern pane, and fell upon the lamp. The lanterns of the lights which are most exposed to accidents of this sort, on account of their positions, are surrounded by fenders made of brass wire of 0.0012m. diameter, with meshes of about 0.08m. of openings. This"], [119, "COMBUSTIBLES. 111 causes a little weakening of the brilliancy of the lights. It is to be remarked, however, that the number of birds which have come iu con tact with the lanterns have so greatly decreased, from year to year, since the lights have been established, that probably the greater part of these fenders may at no distant day be dispensed with altogether. All the lanterns are provided with lightning-rods, with platinum points, made of large copper-wire rope. Lamps. It will be necessary to speak of the arrangement of the lamps when an account is given of the principal properties of the combustibles em. ployed. VI.\u2014 COMBUSTIBLES. The light-houses of France are nearly all illuminated by lamps fed with colza oil. That oil is produced from colza, (bras.sica campestris,) which is cultivated in various parts of our territory, but chiefly in the department of the North and Normandy. The greater part of the lights of the fourth order have beeu lighted lately with petroleum or the oil of schiste, and the electric light is now being tried in one of our light houses. Other modes of producing light have been proposed at differ ent times, but they have not yet been practically applied. FAT OILS. Experiments have been made at the Central Establishment of Lights upon the different oils which might be employed in light-house illumi nation, and it seems useful to report here not only what justifies the preference given to the oil of colza, but what appear to be the condi tions to be considered in regard to the productions of other countries, or of economy, which may induce to the employment of oil from other productions. These experiments were made in 1861 and 1862. The oils were fur nished by Messieurs. Guillou, Bucquet & Co. They were, each kind, of excellent quality, except the colza oil from India, for which was substi tuted, as soon as its inferiority was discovered, the od from the same production which the corporation of the Trinity Board of England uses in its light-houses. The different oils tested have been burnt successively in small jacket"], [120, "112 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. lamps, in single-wick lamps, and in multiple-wick lamps. The trials were numerous, and the results will be found in the following table : An absolute value should not be given to these figures, for the same kind of oil gives different results, according to its quality and the length of time which has elapsed since it was made, But it is allowed, with this reserve, to deduce from them useful conclusions. It is seen that the different oils are differently classed, according to the quality of them ; that which burns longest in a jacket lamp is not that which sustains combustion longest in an Argand lamp; and that which, for the same quantity consumed, gives the greatest intensity from a single wick lamp does not possess the same merit when used in double-wick lamps in light-houses. Thus, olive oil, which appeared to possess advantages over colza oil when used in the first-named lamps, was inferior when used in those of the second kind. The influence which the number of wicks showed was more marked in the lamps of the first order than in the others. Two of these lamps were fed, one with colza oil and the other with olive oil. Afterburning four hours, the first presented a handsome flame, while the second was with difficulty kept burning, and the mean luminous intensities, for 40 grammes of oil consumed, were respectively 1.24 burner and 1.17 burner. These two lamps were left burning for three hours longer, and the flame of the olive-oil lamp fell to that point where there was uo longer any comparison, and the snuffing became indispensable.

The mean intensity of the colza-oil flame has been found to be 0.71 burner, with 40 grammes of oil consumed in that time, while that of the flame of the olive-oil lamp was only 0.53 burner. The difference would have been much greater if the wicks of the first had been trimmed at the same time those of the second were. This last fact tends to show that the olive oil deteriorates much more than the colza oil in passing through the burner, where it becomes heated. Cocoanut oil has given excellent results in a lamp of the first-order. After three-hours1 burning, the flame was very brilliant, and had an intensity of 1.. '55 burner with a consumption of 10 grammes; aud at the end of eleven hours, when it became necessary to trim the wicks, it had only decreased to 1.23 burner. It only produces a very small thief on the smallest wick. This oil is used for burning in the light house at Cape St. Jaques, in Cochin China. Other elements ought to enter into the consideration of oils than those under discussion ; those are, the price and the temperature at which they cease to remain in a fluid state. The following table shows the mean prices at Paris, which, however, are subject to variations far from narrow limits, the density, the co efficient of expansion, and the temperature at which they congeal and liquify.

The order in which they ought to be classed, following the quality in view, may be seen below : Colza oil (French and English) excels greatly all the other oils in two essential respects : that of intensity in multiple- wick lamps, except cocoanut oil, and that of the resistance in passing into the baked state (crusty) by the action of the temperature. It is not far from the best in regard to the duration of combustion and intensity in single-wick lamps, and it is, above all, greatly superior to olive oil for use in multi ple-wick lamps. Finally, in regard to price, it is preferable to all the others, except whale oil, which is otherwise inadmissible on account of the short duration of its combustion, and the necessity for frequently trimming the multiple-wick lamps. It should be stated that the multiple-wick lamps used in experiment ing with these different oils were constructed to burn colza oil, and perhaps the other oils would have given better results from lamps whose forms were better adapted for burning them. No trials have yet been made in that direction, for the reason that the colza oil has, in France, an incontestible superiority, and possesses higher claims than all the others ; but the engineers of the light-house service design to undertake them in the interest of our colonies in which maritime illumination appears to be beginning to extend and to receive attention. LAMPS. In all the lamps fed by colza oil, the wicks are cyhndrical, and are placed between two currents of air, so that the combustion may be as active as possible. The glass chimney is contracted at a certain height above the burner, so as to project the air against the middle and upper parts of the flame. The number of wicks varies with the order of the light, as has been said before.

The figures in the last column exhibit very clearly that merit. To prevent the burners from becoming too much heated by the action of the flames to which they are exposed, it is necessary to cause much more oil to pass through them than is consumed, and that arrangement is besides favorable to the brilliancy, in maintaining the flame in its normal state. Experience has shown that at least three times as much oil should pass through the burners as is consumed. Thus the lamps are regulated so as to cause to pass through the burner, per hour : In the first-order lights 3. 040 kg. of oil. In the second-order lights 2. 000 \" \" In those of the third order: large model 0. 700 \" \" In those of the third order : small model 0. 440 \" \" Some keepers exceed these figures in a much greater proportion, so as to manage their lights with greater ease ; but it may be remarked that that excess of feeding has the effect of raising to a certain extent the most brilliant point of the flame, which, consequently, renders it necessary to modify the distance to be observed between the crown of the burner and the focus of the apparatus. Plate 15 represents the different kinds of lamp burners, and the flames produced by them. These drawings are made half-size.

Figures 3 and 4, 5 and 6, 7 and 8, give, respectively, the plan, eleva tion, and the section of the burners and the flames of second, third, and of fourth-order constant-level lamps. These drawings show exactly all that enters into the composition of a lamp burner, but it appears unnecessary to enter here into the details which the instructions upon the light-house service explain fully. Figures 9 and 10 relate to the oil of schiste, which will be noticed further on. The most of the lamps having but one-wick burners, and some of those of the third order, smaller model, are of the kind called constant level. These lamps are too well known to require to be described. It is known that their reservoir is enclosed in the body of the lamp, and carries at its lower end a valve which opens the moment it is put in place, aud causes it to communicate with the burner. Below that valve is a small tube which regulates the height of oil in the burner, whose lower extremity should be held at some millimetres below the crown of the burner. The capillarity causes the oil to rise in the wick. That arrangement is inadmissible when the flame is required to illu minate the entire horizon, and then recourse is had to lower reservoir lamps in which the ascension of the oil is produced by a mechanism. The only lamps of this description actually used in the lighthouse ser vice are the moderator lamps. Their mechanism is placed in the reser voir, aud consists of a spiral spring whose base is fixed in leather, placed upon the oil which forces it up through a tube which traverses it, and comes out below the burner. The movement of the oil is regulated by an iron stem fixed to the burner, which is fitted in the tube upon a length which is reduced in proportion as the piston goes down, and the tension of the spring diminishes. The oil flows to the burner iu ex cess, and that which is not consumed flows back in the reservoir. With the exception which has been spoken of above, all the lamps of the three largest orders are mechanical lamps. Those which Messieurs. Fresnel and Arago employed iu their experi ments of 1821 were the constant-level lamps ; the reservoir, more elevated than the burner, received the air through a sliding tube in a leather box, which could be raised or lowered at will, so as to regulate the level of the flow as required. But this system appeared to be ill adapted in practice, on account of the large volume required as well for the reservoir as for the cistern designed to receive the surplus of oil, and, besides, the obligation which it imposed to cause the oil to be replaced in the reservoir from time to time. The mechanical lamps in most general use in the light-houses are of two kinds: 1st. Clock-work movement lamp, system of Wagner. \u2014 It has for motor"], [125, "117 COMBUSTIBLES. an exterior weight which descends in a column of the armature of the apparatus. An alternating movement of rotation is transmitted to two vertical arbors by means of cranks and wheel-work used in clocks. These arbors traverse the oil reservoir, and are armed by two fixed levers at their upper extremities, which put the feed pumps in play. A fly-wheel regulates the motion of the mechanism. The supply of oil to the burner may be moderated, besides, by turning an endless screw placed in the body of the pumps, and arranged so as to reduce in pro portion to the accession the opening designed to introduce the com bustible. 2d. Moderator lamp, by weights. \u2014 A cast-iron piston, fitted with leather stamped on its circumference, is weighted, and moves with little fric tion in the body of the lamp. A chain wound around a horizontal arbor allows it to be wound up. It descends by the action of the weights, and causes the movement which raises the oil in a vertical tube. The regulator consists of an orifice of small diameter, occupying the upper part of this tube, in which a conical needle passes, and raised more or less, according as it becomes necessary to increase or diminish the flow. In some of these lamps the movement of the needle is regu lated by that of the piston, so that the orifice, opening in a measure as the piston descends, overcomes a greater pressure. The instructions for the light-house service furnish minute details in regard to the composition and the attendance upon the lamps, and render unnecessary further development here of this subject. WICKS. The quality of the wicks exerts a marked influence upon the regu larity of the flame, and above all upon its being properly maintained. It is essential that they should be woveu of cotton of excellent quality; that their tissue be uniform ; also as supple as possible, and neither too openly nor too closely woven. Specimen samples, adopted after a long course of experiments, have been deposited at the central Light house Establishment in Paris, and all new wicks are required to con form strictly to them. The woof is of cotton, in wicks which should offer a certain degree of resistance, and such are required for sideral apparatus, which are not as well kept up as the others ; it is of silk for the most of the lamps."], [126, "118 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. The table below shows the sizes (width) of the wicks when laid flat, the number of ends of each strand, the kind of woof, and the weight per metre of length. The wicks of lamps for petroleum or oil of schiste have cotton woof. It is of great importance that the wicks be kept free from dust and the effects of dampness, to place them regularly in the burners, and to trim them with the greatest care and precision. GLASS CHIMNEYS AND DAMPERS. The burners of all lamps are covered by glass chimneys formed with long curved elbows. Above each of these is enclosed, without being fastened laterally, a regulator or damper made of sheet iron, which is used to regulate the combustion in conjunction with it. In the lens apparatus of the fourth order, the regulator or damper is supported upon the upper crown of the armature ; in the others, it is kept at its summit by a sheet-iron sheath w7hich is fixed to the apparatus. That sheath is always open at its upper end, and the products of the com bustion are freely raised to escape outside, in passing first through the openings of the chimney of the cupola, and afterwards by those of the bowl which covers them, as shown by Figure 1 of Plate 9. In some light-houses the sheath has been closed at the top and three sheet-iron tubes, fixed upon its cover, have been arranged for conducting the pro ducts of the combustion into the chimney of the cupola, so as to preserve all the parts of the lantern free from smoke. This system is shown by the Figures 1 of Plates 6, 7, and 8. The chimney of the lamp is supported by a cylindrical holder, which is raised or lowered by turning it to the left or to the right. Too high, the chimney renders the flame reddish with diminished brilliancy; too *1 millimetre = 0.03937 inch. 1 1 gramme = 15.444 grains, Troy. 1 gramme = 0.035 ounce, avoirdupois.

The same effects may be produced by the proper movement of the key of the damper; the flame lowers and whitens in proportion as the pas sage is opened; it rises, reddens, and tends to become smoky, when the opening is reduced in size. MINERAL, PETROLEUM, OR SCHISTE OIL. The oils which have been used advantageously within a few years past, both for domestic purposes and for lighting many of our small light-houses and beacons, are not included among those already spoken of, for the reason, that they differ entirely from all others in every respect, and cannot be burnt in the same kind of lamps ; these are the esseutial oils of schiste and petroleum. The first of these oils is produced from distillation of bituminous schiste ; the second is produced principally in North America, where large quantities have been recently found. These are from the hydro carbons. The densities of those which are best adapted to illumination vary from 0.80 to 0.83, taking the density of water for unity. When more dense, they are difficult to burn, and tend greatly to create a thick smoke ; when lighter, they are liable to cause serious accidents, inas much as they become too inflammable. These oils possess, compared to the fatty oils, the triple merit of being less expensive, produce more light for the same amount of con sumption, and give lower flames, and less useless divergence in the small apparatus; but they are more apt to smoke in case the current of air is not properly regulated, and the attendance upon them requires much more care than with the others. From the numerous experiments to which these oils have been sub jected, the following results have been reported : 1. The oil of schiste or petroleum, of suitable quality, gives about one burner of carcel for 30 grammes consumed per hour. 2. The lamps used in the light-house service, which have a burner of 0.0255m. of diameter, burn about 70 grammes per hour during the first hours of lighting, and only 52 grammes at the end of twelve or fifteen hours ; for a lamp well attended, a mean consumption of 65 grammes per hour may be allowed, and an intensity of 2.2 burners. 3. Petroleum and the oil of schiste act about alike. In estimating the price of colza oil at 1.51 franc per kilogramme, and that of petroleum or schiste at 1.10 franc, delivered at the light-stations, it is seen that the unity of light comes to 1.51 fr. x 0.040 = 0.06 fr. with colza oil, and to i-io.fr xaoes = 0.033 fr. with the others, deduction being made for the cost of wicks, chimneys, &c."], [128, "120 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. Two descriptions of lamps are used for these new oils ; one is the ordinary constant-level lamp, regulated .so that the level of the oil maintains itself at about 0.04m. below the crown of the burner ; the other consists of a simple reservoir in which the wick is thrust, and from which the oil rises by capillarity in sufficient quantity, so long as the level does not descend 0.16/h. below the burner. The first consume a little more, and are in a manner more self sustaining than the second, and they give consequently a better flame, which continues more uniform during the entire combustion ; but they do not offer other facilities for the service, and they are not adapted to lights required to illuminate the entire horizon. The burner of these lamps has a double current of air, but that is not sufficient to insure complete combustion \u2014 above all, a long combus tion \u2014 and it is necessary to fit upon it a small brass disk, which throws the air upon the interior face ot the flame and cools the wick. This arrangement is represented by the Figures 9 and 10 of Plate 15. Figure 9 is in plan taken from above, and Figure 10 gives, on one side, the elevation, and on the other, a section through A B of the burner and the reservoir. The screw for moving the wick is seen upou that section. The chimneys are enlarged at the bottom so as to unite the form of the flame. That form necessitates a special profile for lens apparatus illuminated with petroleum or oil of schiste, or at least a modification of the posi tions of the catadioptric rings, as has been seen iu discussing the ques tion of illuminating apparatus. Some schiste or petroleum lamps are supplied with flat wicks, which are thrust into a lower reservoir. They have not the brass disk, and the forms of the chimneys are not special. All the efforts thus far made, to apply the oil of schiste to the illu mination of the three largest orders of lights, have been unsuccessful. They did not succeed in giving much more intensity to the flame with out causing it to smoke and rendering it very difficult to manage. Some success has been obtained by insufflation of air; but the system has not appeared to be susceptible of practical application, and the result left, besides, much yet to be desired. GASEOUS COMBUSTIBLES Other modes of producing light have been proposed at different times; but they have not been thought worthy of being adopted for light-house illumination, and it will be sufficient to mention them in making known very succinctly the reasons for rejecting them. Hydrogen gas produced by the distillation of bituminous coal is more economical than colza oil, about in the same proportion as the oil 'of"], [129, "COMBUSTIBLES. 121 schiste. It brings the price of the unity of light per hour to about 0.03 fr. The objections to it are, that it does not give a flame as bril liant on the surface equal to that of oil, and the danger of causing explosions. The gas from oil produces a very beautiful flame, but it has not the merit of economy, aud does not offer more security than the other. Oxygen gas, employed to vivify any flame whatever, has produced excellent results as regards the luminous intensity. The cost of this gas and the fear of explosions have caused it to be rejected. The oxyhydrogeu or Drummoud light has been recommended many times, and has received modifications more or less beneficial. The expense of it, the danger which attends it, and the irregularity of its movements, have not allowed its practical use in light-houses. Its luminous intensity is not, besides, very great; it varied from three to six burners in the tests to which it has been subjected. ELECTRIC LIGHT. For a long time the electric light from currents produced by batteries of different descriptions, especially from that of Bunsen, has been asked for. The results obtained have been excellent so far as the luminous intensity is concerned, but the manipulations necessary for the apparatus, the chances of extinction, the irregularity of the pro ducts, and the greatly -increased expense, do not seem to warrant the application of this mode of producing light for the illumination of light-houses. A new arrangement, based upon the induction currents developed by the magnets, has made a long step on this subject, and, after having been experimented with for three years at the central Light-house Establishment at Paris, it is now applied upon trial at one of the first order fixed lights at Cape La Heve, near Havre. Mechanism The magneto-electric machine which produces currents* is repre sented in section by the Figure 25, below. It is composed of forty horse shoe magnets, distributed by five equidistant vertical planes, upon the edges of a right-angle prism with an octagonal base, and the bob bins passing between the groups of magnets closely placed. These bobbins are fixed upon the circumference of vertical disks, which re volve around the axis of the prism, and are put in motion by a small steam engine. The bobbins number thirty-two. There are eight to the disk, as well as there are eight magnets in each vertical plane. The poles of the magnets alternate upon each of the horizontal ranges in * This machine belongs to the Alliance Company, which has patented it."], [130, "122 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. such a way that one bobbin is always placed between two opposite poles, and but one current establishes itself in the wire which surrounds it, from which it ajiproaches one magnet, afterwards reverses from the one from which it goes. Sixteen changes of direction correspond to each revolution of the cylinder. The maximum of intensity was obtained when the machine made from 350 to 400 turns per minute, and the current then changes nearly one hundred times per second. The partial currents of the same kind reunite, and are alternately put in communication with the one and the other of the cheeks of the frame of cast iron of the machine, which are separated by insulating substances. It is at the summit of these cheeks where the con ducting wires are fixed which take, successively, the total currents to con duct them to the electric Fig. 25. lamp. These wires are covered by an insulating material throughout their entire length. The magnets have each the power of 60 kilogrammes. The steam engine is of high pressure, and of nearly four-horse power, when the tension of the steam in the boiler is carried to six atmospheres, and it suffices for four atmospheres and a, half to give the normal velocity to two machines similar to that described. It is fed by fresh water, which is collected and retained in large cisterns. Regulator. The carbon points, which produce the light, are supported and main tained at a proper distance by a regulator or electric lamp. That appa ratus has for its object to bring the two points near to each other, so that they will burn without' coming iu contact, which would cause their extinction. Numerous systems of great ingenuity have been conceived for that purpose. All of them are based upon the same principle \u2014 upon the intervention of an electro-magnet which traverses the currents."], [131, "123 COMBUSTIBLES. That which has been adopted for the illuminating apparatus of the light-house at La Heve is by Mr. Serrin. It consists of the following : Two carbon carriers are fitted each to a vertical stem, which moves in one sheath. These stems are so bound together that when the lower one rises the other descends, so that the last is moved by its weights. This movement is moderated and regulated by a fly with toothed wheels. The sheath of the lower pencil earner is supported by a double parallelogram, jointed, which is fitted with a small stop stem, which, according as it descends or rises, unites with one of the wheels and stops the movement, or leaves it free and allows the carbon points to come near to each other. This parallelogram is subjected to two oppo site forces; one produced by a spiral spring tends to raise it, the other, due to two electro-magnets which traverse the current, tends to lower it, in drawing a fixed armature to the lower part of that piece. The apparatus is regulated in such a manner that, when the carbon points are at the desired distance for the production of the light, the wheel-work is united, which insures the immobility of the carbon hold ers. That distance increases with the combustion, the current becomes weakened, the electro-magnet loses its power, the parallelogram yields to the spring and raises the uniting stem, the carbon carriers are imme diately put in motion, approach each other, and do not stop until the moment is reached when the current has regained sufficient intensity to determine a new connection. The current which passes through the electro-magnets is that which unites the lower carbon point. Although the currents pass alternately from one to the other carbon point, experience has shown that the lower one is consumed a little faster than the other, at a rate which varies, as the matter is not per fectly homogeneous, and which appears to be about fg|. Consequently the diameters of the pulleys, upon which the chains used to uuite the movements of the two stems, are regulated so that the position of the luminous focus does not change, or at least does not vary beyond very restricted limits. That effect has only recently been verified, and it was not estimated at first at its true value. The consumption of the carbon points will have the effect of altering the existing relation between the weights of the two stems, and conse quently the movement of the system. That inconvenience has been remedied by means of a small chain wound at one of its extremities around the lower stem, and the other upon a fixed point ; the stem sup ports a longer part as the carbons become shorter. Other dispositions of detail ought to be mentioned : 1. A button moving up the arm of a lever, which carries two pullies to bring back the chain of she two stems, allows the luminous focus to"], [132, "124 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. be raised or lowered within practical limits, without interrupting the movement of the mechanism. 2. Another button moves upon the spiral spring in such a way that the machine may be easily regulated to suit the intensity of the current. It is evident that the spring ought to be much tighter, as the current, which is antagonistic to it, is more powerful. 3. The stops properly placed at different parts of the system limit the extent of the movement. 4. A kind of small crutch, turning around the summit of the upper sheath, allows the carbons to be placed very regularly in the position and at the desired distance, and the upper carbou may be brought exactly in the axis of the other by means of buttons which regulate the movements of their carriers in every direction horizontally. 5. The carbon carriers are liable to be burnt, if after the consump tion of the carbons they come too near to each other, and the machine is so fixed that they are still distant 0.06\u00bbi. when they have reached the limit of their course. 6. A box of brass covers the whole of the machinery, and protects it from diist aud moisture. This machinery is sufficiently complicated, without always being so much so as to make it necessary to have the pieces before one's eyes to describe it without difficulty ; but it is solidly placed ; each of its parts offers more resistance than is rigorously necessary, and it appears to be of a kind which presents neither difficulty in attending upon it, nor requiring frequent repairs. It satisfies all the special conditions demanded of it in practice.* Carbons. The coal points have a square section of 0.007\u00bbi. of the side ; they are 0.27m. long, which gives to each 0.20w. for burning, the remainder being lost on account of the carriers covering a part, and, besides, not coming in contact. Their quality has a great influence upon the length of time they burn, and at the same time upon the intensity of the light. Those which are now employed are made of the densest of the deposits of the * A new regulator is now being tried by the light-house-service engineers, aud every thing leads to the hope that it will give better results. Conceived by Mr. Faucault, t to whom electric illumination owes already a most ingenious automatic apparatus and the substitution of angular carbous in place of those hitherto employed,) it has been constructed most perfectly by one of our most skilled artists, Mr. Duboscq. The mechanism consists of a differential movement joining to two wheels which may be geared either simultaneously or alternating, by the pallet of the bent lever which causes the regulating bobbin to move so as to cause the arrest, approach, or recoil of the carbons automatically. The apparatus is extremely sensitive."], [133, "125 COMBUSTIBLES. carbon which form in the retorts for distilling coal. Their mean con sumption may be estimated at 0.05w. per hour, exclusive of the waste. Luminous intensity. The intensity of the light generated by the apparatus about to be described, presents great variations, caused not by the electric current, (that is constant so long as the motion is the same,) but for want of homogeneousness of the coal points, the slight modifications in the form and the distance between the points, and, above all, by the displace ment of the voltaic arc, which moves from one side to the other. It is very difficult to measure it by the photometer, fpr the reason that these variations are incessant ; however, it has been done when it was known a sufficient degree of precision could be had. In the actual state of things, that intensity may be estimated at the mean value of 125 burn ers, a maximum value of 180 burners, and a minimum of about 75 burners. Placed in an apparatus for a fixed light like that at La Heve, which is represented on page 76, (Figure 22,) this luminous focus gives a divergence of about 6\u00b0 in the vertical plane, and a mean intensity in the flame most illuminated which ought to be valued at 3,500 burners, deducting the rays absorbed by the plate-glass of the lantern. The electric light has not yet been applied to eclipse-light apparatus, but there is no serious difficulty in making the application. The inten sity of the flashes will vary with the angular space which the lenses may embrace, and might reach to about 30,000 burners. Electric light at La Heve. The uninterrupted exhibition of lights, which is of primary impor tance in light-houses, requires the adoption of proper measures to anticipate any extinctions to which they may be liable, whether on account of the necessity for renewing the carbons, or of accidents to the machinery or the electric lamp. It has been deemed prudent to have in the same establishment a double set of all the parts of the system. In that way there is, besides, the additional advantage of being able, if desired, in the time of fog, for example, to put the two magneto-electric machines in motion, and thereby double the brilliancy of the light. The dispositions adopted for the lighthouses at La Heve, which illu minate three-fourths of the horizon, are as follows : Two steam engines and two electric machines have been placed, as shown by Figure 26, in a temporary building on the west front of the south tower.

The two electrical machines may be put in motion separately, or both together, in such a way as to be conducted by a single motor. A very simple mechanism allows, for that purpose, to unite the two axes or to render them independent of each other. The conducting wires ought to pass up through the interior of the tower, but in the execution of the works theyT have been placed in a vertical case outside, against one of the reentering angles of the struct ure. They are kept in their position by porcelain insulators. Fig. 26. The catadioptric apparatus are placed in the same lantern which has been established in front upon one of the angles of a square chamber, di vided into two sto ries, which takes the place above the plat form of the tower, the old lantern and its base, (see Plate 19,)andhasbeehput outside, in harmony with the rest of the idifice.

For that purpose, the iron table is in communica tion with one of the conducting wires, and the other wire in con tact with an electric comb speigne electrique) which is fixed upon that table, below the lens ap paratus, with the inter position of an insulating substance, and presses with its elastic teeth a metallic plate placed under the lamp. That plate conducts in the electro-magnets the cur rent which it receives. The other current is introduced into the body of the lamp, in passing by the railroad. The time necessary for the substitution of one lamp for another does not exceed two seconds. The existence of a duplicate apparatus, always ready for use, allows means, besides, of preventing, for however short a time, the extinction which that operation causes. Whenever the lighted lamp ought to be removed, for any cause whatever, and always for renewing the carbons, a commutator placed under the control of the keeper, allows the in stantaneous passing of the current into the other apparatus, and the intensity of the light is diminished for only a very short time. All the operations are executed with the greatest facility."], [137, "129 COMBUSTIBLES. It is very important, in view of the restricted dimensions of the light and of the illuminating apparatus, that the position of the luminous focus should vary only within very narrow limits; a displacement of 0.005m., in any direction, would cause an elevation or depression of about 2\u00b0 of the beam of light emanating from the apparatus, and no ray will be carried to the limit of the horizon, if the error reaches to 0.008m. But, in admitting that the keepers will fully appreciate the necessity for keeping the variations within the limits of some milU metres, it would be hard to impose upon them the obligation to have their eyes continually upon a light of such great intensity, that the colored glasses of green or blue will not relieve them unless of so deep a color as to be seen through an ordinary light. The service has been facilitated, and one of the gravest inconveniences attendant upon elec tric illumination partly remedied, by means of a small lens which, placed in the dead angle of the apparatus, throws against the opposite side of the chamber an amplified and renewed image of the light, (S, Figure 27.) The amplification is such, that an actual variation of 0.001m. corresponds to a represented variation of 0.022m. The keeper is not required, nor is it necessary for him, to look at the electric light, but at the image, to satisfy himself of the continuation of the proper opera tion of the apparatus, and the least deviation shows itself with the greatest preciseness. The study' of the means of regularly registeriug the extinctions and the displacements of the focus, without the intervention of the keeper, upon a paper sensible to the action of the light, has been commenced, and is still prosecuted. COMPARATIVE MERIT OF THE ELICTRIC LIGHT. To estimate the merit of the electric light, in so far as relates to the economy of expense, the comparison should not be limited, as has been done for the oil of schiste, to establish the cost of the combustible consumed. This light necessitates the employment of expensive mate rial, as well as the attendance upon a machine besides the lamp, and these two sources of expense cannot be omitted. The calculation would seem to be as follows : Cost of the first establishing : Magneto-electric machine of four disks 8000. 00 Jr. Steam engine and accessories 3000. 00 Regulator, conducting wires, &c 1500. 00 Total 12500. 00 In calculating at ten per cent, interest, and the extinguishment of that F L 9"], [138, "130 FRENCH COb\\ST LIGHTS. sum, admitting, as in our lights, 4,000 hours of combustion annually, aud allowing two furnaces to the steam engine, the expense per hour will be found from the following figures: Interest and funding of the capital, 1,250 fr., will be per hour 0. 3125 fr. Fuel for the steam engine, 10 kg. at 40 Jr., the 1,000 kg . 0. 4000 Salaries of two firemen, 2,800 Jr. per annum, and per hour 0. 7000 Salaries of two keepers, 2,000 Jr. per annum, and per hour 0. 5000 Carbon, 0.16m. per hour, including waste, at 2.25 Jr. the metre 0. 3600 Lubricating oil, water, attendance, &c 0. 1275 Expense per hour 2. 4000 The mean luminous intensity being estimated at 125 burners, the cost of one burner per hour, for the light burning freely in space, comes to 0.0192 Jr. The cost of the same quantity of light, when it is furnished by a first-order lamp fed by colza oil, may be estimated as follows: Interest and funding the cost of the lamp, ten per cent. per annum, will be 65 Jr. and per hour 0. 0163 Jr. Salaries of two keepers as above 0. 5000 760 gr. of oil per hour, at 1. 51 fr 1. 1476 Wicks and glass chimneys, 119 Jr. per annum, aud per hour 0. 0298 Attendance, waste, &c '. 0. 0583 Expense per hour 1. 7520 The luminous intensity being equal to 23 burners, the cost per hour and per burner is 0. 0762 Jr. If the cost of the unity of light obtained with colza oil, burnt in a lamp of the first order, be represented by 1, the electric machine will give the same quantity of light for 0.252 fr. The second of these modes of production is near to four times more economical than the other, under the conditions which have served as a basis of our calculations. If the source of the electric light were of less intensity, the cost of the luminous unity would be increased, for the principal elements which constitute it are independent, within a certain limit, of the quantity of light produced. And, on the other hand, if the currents are made more intense in their development, the"], [139, "131 COMBUSTIBLES. cost per hour is increased, but will reduce the cost of the unity of light. One of the inconveniences of the electric light, in its present state of development, is that it is not adapted economically to lights of feeble intensities. To estimate justly the advantages which this light presents for light house illumination, it will be necessary to include in the account the cost of the lens apparatus and of duplicate machinery, as well as the cost of construction necessary to the establishment and placing of the machinery aud the furnaces aud boilers, and to take into account the Interest to navigation to have the intensity7 of the light increased. It is not deemed necessary to enter into a discussion upon this subject, since the conclusions must vary according to the circumstances which are presented, and the figures, as well as the methods of calculation shown in this memoir, furnish all the other elements of questions of this sort, which may be called in for treatment. There is, nevertheless, a reserve in presenting this subject; it ought to be observed, however, that of the lights of different kinds to which the photometer assigns the same intensity7 have not always the same range. It has been seen, when the question of colored lights was under review, that the red rays increased more freely in the atmosphere than the white ones, while the green ones appeared to be in the reverse way, so that the range depends at the time upon the intensity aud the nature of the light. A luminous focus may be very brilliant, and at the same time have but a very limited range during the existence of certain kinds of fog, if the red rays cause its defect. An experiment made by the engineers of the light-house service upon a new mode of pro ducing the electric light conceived in England, comes in to the support of that assertion. A thin fillet of mercury7 falling into a capsule was substituted for the coal points ; the light had an intensity analogous to that obtained with them, and two apparatus, the one of mercury and the other of carbons (coal points) lighted simultaneously, appeared equal at the distance of 1,500 metres in a calm atmosphere. But red, colored glasses having been placed before them, the first was almost completely extinguished, while the other retained a very handsome brilliancy. The green color produced an entirely different result, as was expected ; the light by coal points (carbons) is not extinct, but it is not much more brilliant than the other. It was concluded from these ex periments, that if useful, as it might be under many aspects, the system which was employed was probably not of a nature to be applied to the illuminatiou of light-houses, and the inventor has not kept the promise which he made, to submit his system to new trials. But observations made upon the electric light actually in use, both at long and short distances, tend to establish the conclusion that, as at"], [140, "132 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. present composed, it is inferior to the light produced by colza oil. These experiments are still in progress, as the observations made are not sufficiently numerous to warrant the enunciation of formal con clusions.

The proper signals to be made during fogs and thick weather, to in dicate to navigators the entrance to a port, or the position of a danger, have been objects of numerous studies; but the question which they raise has not yet been regarded as solved. The entrances to the greater part of our ports are marked in foggy and thick weather by7 bells which are sounded at will, with suitable variations of intervals, and some of the isolated light-stations on the sea-coast are also provided with similar apparatus; in the United States of America, where fogs seem to be more frequent than they7 are on our sea-coast, they7 have not hesitated, on account of the great ex pense, to provide sound as an aid to navigation, but have established at a great many points, fog-bells weighing 1,000 lbs. and over, sounded by7 clock-work machinery7, and at other places powerful whistles worked by compressed air.* Numerous experiments were made in 1854 by the Lighting Service Engineers upon different instruments, which seemed to be of a character from which good results might be expected. different instruments. Fire-arms having been discarded on account of the inconvenience and danger attending their use, or at least the supplies they require for use, the apparatus successively tried were bells, tam-tams, and a kind of large rattle made of wood, such as is used in the East, metallic plates, trumpets, and whistles. The clock-work-movement bells, whistles, and trumpets w7ere at once found to be superior to all the others. And at the same time, among these last, there are some of them which, at a short distance, produce a very lively impression upon the ear. We -will cite especially the tam-tams, Avhich are used in England on board * Since the date of this Memoir, (November, 1864,) the U. S. Light-house Board has made a great many experiments with sounding instruments, with the view to the adoption of the one best suited to give warning during fogs, snow storms, and thick weather. Steam whistles, trumpets, sirens, and bells, are in use at present. T. A. J."], [142, "134 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. of most of the light-vessels. They7 cannot be heard much over 500 metres, but they possess the merit of emitting a characteristic sound, which recommends it. A trumpet made by Mr. Darche, a capable manufacturer of musical instruments, has been heard at a much greater distance than either one of the other instruments. It is terminated by a mouth iu the form of a paraboloid of revolution, aud is provided with a reed valve, which a spiral spring maintains opposite to the opening by which the air comes, and which vibrates under the double action of this spring and the elastic force of the gas. Its sounds have been heard at more than two kilometres'* distance, against a strong wind, while a bell of 100 kilogrammes could not be heard more than 700 metres. But the range of that instrument diminishes in proportion as the observer is removed from its direction, and if it be necessary7 to make it heard upon a horizon of a prescribed amplitude, it will be necessary to give to it a rotating motion during calm weather, so as to give the greatest intensity of sound successively7 on all the lines of direction. The whistles, similar to those used on locomotives, cannot be heard so far as the trumpets of which we have' spoken, but they possess the advantage of distributing uniformly7 around the horizon, and if no great importauce is to be attached to that merit, it is probable that, by means of a reflector, properly7 fitted, their range might be increased so as to give as much, if not more, power to them than the trumpet. May not the sounds produced by them be mistaken for those made by7 the winds passing through the riggings of the vessels ? Would the trumpets be considered more characteristic I These questions canuot be sufficiently7 answered except by7 numerous experiments made at sea. Besides, these instruments present the grave inconvenienc of requiring to be compressed to several atmospheres, and to expend a like quantity when it becomes necessary7 to make them heard at sufficiently7 short intervals of time, rendering it necessary7 to have recourse to machinery7 to keep up the amount of consumption. It has not been judged, in the actual state of things, that the naviga tion of our coast has sufficient interest to require sounds to be heard at a great distance to justify the expense which the establishment and maintenance of these machines would entail. BELLS. The bells then remain. They involve the following questions : At what distance can they7 be heard, according to their calibre and the force and direction of the wind? What dispositions are required to be made to increase their range ! What are the modes of striking the best adapted to render the sig- * 2,187 yards."], [143, "135 FOG-SIGNALS. uals characteristic, aud prevent their confusion with sounds produced by other bells ? What is the mode of placing applicable under most circuni stances ? In regard to ranges, observations have been made iu the ports of Cherbourg aud Boulogne. They have established that the noise which may be made by the stroke of a hammer upon a bell is heard at a greater distance than the sounds of several bells together, and still greater as the strokes, each one being distinct, are more rapid. Thus, the range is increased in the ratio of 1 to 1.14, when the number which was 15 per minute was increased to 25. We admit that we may, with risking the rupture of the bell, make the weight of the hammer falling 0.20/m. upon a bell of 100 kilogrammes, 5 kilogrammes ; and for a bell of 200 kilogrammes, the hammer falling from the same height, may be 9 kilo grammes. From numerous experiments, it has been concluded that a bell of 100 kilogrammes, well placed, and thus worked, may be heard, during what sailors call a good breeze, at about 1,200 metres distance when the wind is against the sound, at 2,000 metres when it is at right angles to it, and at 4,000 metres when with the wind. During calm weather, or with a light crossing breeze, the range of a bell of this description should be heard at the distance of 2,500 metres. No experiments have been made during violent winds, but we know that, when they7 blow against them, the strongest and loudest sounds are arrested. We kuow, also, that, in general, fogs do not exist under such atmospheric circum stances ; they7 almost always come from sea, it is true, but are accom panied by a slight breeze. The ranges increase with the weight of the bell, aud, to a certain point, with the height of the tone. Iu order to have the sounds, which ought to be heard in succession, distinctly and readily noted, they should have au interval of at least one second of time. The intervals to mark the termination of a number of continuous strokes should not be less than six seconds. Two means present themselves for increasing the range of a sounding instrument: to have recourse to apparatus of a kind to increase the souud, or to transmit, by way of reflection, the uudulations which are otherwise lost in the direction in which they are not required to be heard. The first has been tried without producing the effects which were desu-ed, at least without sufficiently great benefit to justify the expense. Neither a reinforcing tube nor a large wooden deflector, arranged some what like a sideral apparatus, so as to act both by vibration and reflec tion, have produced sufficiently marked results, aud we ceased to con tinue experiments which were long and expensive. It is probable that"], [144, "136 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. greater skill might succeed better. We have abandoned the system without condemning it. Simple reflection has given increase of range much more marked. Sound was treated as light. A bell was placed in the focus of a large parabolic reflector, or rather a hemispherical one, as a certaiu amount of divergence was seared, made of material little liable to vibrations. That apparatus, of 1.50m. of opening, was formed of an iron shell en veloped in a bed of Portland cement of from 0.06m. to 0.08m. thickness. The hammers of the bell were put in motion by machinery. The ex periments were made in 1861 and 1862, in the harbor of Boulogne, by the engineers, Messrs. Legros and Saint- Ange Allard. The bell with the reflector was placed on the extremity of the west pier, and, for the pur pose of comparison, an exactly similar bell was placed immediately above. Each one weighed 100 kilogrammes, producing sensibly the same sound or tone, and were struck by7 hammers weighing 2.50 kilo grammes at first, and afterwards 5 kdogrammes, which fell from a height of 0.20m., and were immediately after striking released from con tact by the springs. The two bells were put in motion in succession, and observers placed upon different points of the sea horizon, embracing a semicircle, made known by signals the moment the sounds were not heard by7 them. Two observers, suitably stationed on the coast, fixed the exact positions at the time. These points were afterwards noted on a drawing, and they were sufficiently numerous to allow the curve of ranges to be traced of each experiment, with every degree of accu racy which the subject admitted of; then were noted on the curve the ranges of 9\u00b0 to 9\u00b0 on each side of the axis of the reflector, which afforded the means of making, in figures, a comparative resume of the observa tions. The experiments were made under different circumstances of inten sity and direction of the winds. If the experiments had been made during a perfect calm, the curve of the ranges of the bell without the reflector would have been an arc of the circle, with the exception of the modifications caused by the position of the hammer, and the other would have been more or less lengthened iu the direction of the axis of the reflector and contracted on the sides. But the wind had the effect of altering these curves the most when it was strongest, and it gave to the maximum intensity of the reflector bell nearly the same direction as that of the other bell. The reflector always increased the range in the offing, but not in the lengthening of its axis. The reflected sonorous undulations were carried away very7 nearly like the others, so that, except during calms, there was no real advantage, contrary to what many persons expected by giving to the reflector a rotary motion in the horizontal plane ; but"], [145, "137 FOG-SIGNALS. by moving it thus, to all the points of the horizon in succession, the greatest range was not attained. The summary of the experiments, seven in number, and sufficiently complete to allow of the tracing of the curves referred to, with all the desired exactness, established the mean ratio of the range of the bell without the reflector to that of the one with the reflector to be 100 to 147, in the angular space of 60\u00b0, where the sound was heard furthest, and that the bell without the reflector was only superior outside of 100\u00b0 of the line of the greatest range. It was also found that during calms, or when the wind blew from the bell with the reflector, that the com parative value was increased; the mean ratio of the greatest ranges was found to be about 10 to 17 under these two conditions, while the latter was reduced to 1.3 under a good breeze which was nearly directly against the direction of the sound. These results having been obtained, it became necessary to inquire, whether or not an increase of the weights of the bells would give, at less cost, equivalent results to those of the reflector, and a new series of experiments w7as made, in which two bells were compared, one of 100 kilogrammes with a reflector, the other of 225 kilogrammes without one. The hammers of each fell from a height of 0.20m., and struck sixty times per minute ; that of the first weighed 5 kilogrammes, and that of the second 9 kilogrammes. The greatest range of the heaviest bell reached to 6,140 metres, and that of the other to 7,625 metres, with a strong breeze blowing nearly7 directly7 from the bell and in the axis of the reflector. In an angular space of 60\u00b0, comprising the arc of greatest ranges, the mean ratio deduced from all the observations was found to be in favor of the bell with the reflector nearly as 128 to 100 ; and this proportion was found to be about the same for the combined observations which gave a mean average over au angle of 115\u00b0. It will be necessary to have a much heavier bell to transmit a louder sound in the desired direction than by a reflector ; thus, the economical value of that apparatus is incontestable. However, its application is restricted on account of the few places at which it could be generally placed\u2014 upon the ends of piers and on the galleries of lighthouses. DISTINCTIONS. Special notations have been adopted in sounding the bells, so as to prevent confusion and mingling of sounds. The strokes of the bell made by simple machinery are arranged in groups, which embrace an equal number of strokes for each group, struck in regular succession, and each group is separated by intervals of greater or less duration. Thus, six, eight, or ten strokes, struck at 2 to 2, 3 to 3, or 4 to 4 seconds, followed by an interval of 15 or 20 seconds, and reproducing them-"], [146, "138 FRENCH COAST LIGHTS. selves. At the seaports, the minimum height of the water iu the chan nel is made known by adding a simple stroke or two in the middle of the interval which separates the two succeeding groups of sounds of the bells. There is an advantage to the range of the sound in making the strokes as near together as possible, provided each one is heard distinctly ; but there is an inconvenience in this on account of the neces sity for more frequently7 winding up the machinery7 thus required to do more work. The number of strokes upon the bell being much more easily7 noted than the elapsed time between the intervals, it is the former which is taken as the characteristic distinction, and it is readily seen that this sy7stem of distinctions is susceptible of still greater diversity than our illuminating apparatus.
