Weary at last of her efforts to lose herself and her hateful thoughts in unconsciousness, she determines to rise, and try what study may do for her.

He might, perhaps, have said more about the promised help but that at this instant his father's voice calls to him. Both men look up. Old Gregory Dysart is coming slowly down the pathway, leaning upon his stick. His gaze is fixed upon the ground, so that the wild, strange, fiery eyes are hidden, and with the long white silvery locks escaping from beneath the skull-cap, and with his bowed figure, he looks the very essence of reverend old age. ' Hah ! talking to Taylor,' he says, address ing his son, but looking at Tom, who reddens slightly. 'Don't idle him \u2014 don't idle him.

What more felicitie can fall to creature Than to enjoy delight with libertie ? Lady Riversdale kept her word. She sent for Seaton, and discussed with him the advis ability of trying to gain his father's consent to the proposed visit of Vera and Griselda to The Friars.

Ah, she knew she could rely on him. He was, as she told Griselda, the one dependable person she knew. Really, young men nowadays were all froth and frivolity \u2014 no getting a serious word out of them ; but Seaton was different. And when would he attack his father ? He was not to be discouraged, mind. No doubt dear old Mr. Dysart, whom she had always understood to be a deliciously eccentric creature, would object to the pro position at first, but judiciously managed would no doubt give in to it at last.

' The look the old man flashes round at him is full of a sharp fear ; he shrinks, as it were, beneath his son's words, as if struck by a lash, and waits in a sort of nervous tension for what may come next.

' You forget, sir, that she is as far from me now as though the poles divided us.'
