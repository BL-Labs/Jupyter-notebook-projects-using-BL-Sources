It was only when rioters or other rough people were about that doors were bolted during daylight in the last century, or indeed in the early years of this. A slim girl, not more than eleven years of age, was pacing the floor with a baby-brother in her slender arms. She answered cheerfully ; VOL. I.

Her keys would have dangled from another chain, but that out of doors they were slipped into the right-hand pocket, and were consequently invisible, even the chain being lost under the over-gown. It was summer-time, and a scarf-like mantle of black silk covered her shoulders, as mittens covered her arms, leaving her fingers bare and free to use ; the bonnet on her head towered high above her lappet-like cap, and assisted by her high-heeled shoes (buckled across the instep) imparted height and im portance to a short figure. Emptying from one pocket a store of cherries, and cakes from the other, she kissed the girl on the forehead, and said, \" Divide these amongst you,\" and without waiting for thanks quitted the room and marched upstairs. b 2"], [18, "FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. 4 She sound her daughter, Mrs. D'Anyer \u2014 quite a young-looking woman to be the mother of five children \u2014 on her knees in front of a carved oaken coffer, her own gift to the married couple. She was counting and arranging her household sheets and napery fresh from the airing, with little Sara, a fair-haired beauty of three years, watching her movements, and hindering- under the pretext of help. Without a word of prelude Mrs. Bancroft began, in a broader vernacular than I care to inflict on my readers, common as it was then to the manufacturing class ; \" I tell thee what, Ellen, I shall not leave Muriel here any longer to be kept from school, and sacrificed to that boy. She is not strono enough.\" Mrs. D'Anyer rose to salute her mother, but her gentle \"How do you do ? \" changed to a faltering apology, \" Well, mother, I should not have kept her at home to-day, but I was very busy \" \" And always will be \" interrupted her"], [19, "PRELIMINARY. 5 mother: \"every day brings its own duties, and every household its own work ; only con trivance and management can keep the hour's work to the hour.

She shall go home with me ; I'll see her educated. John won't miss her. I don't think he has cared for the lass since the illness that seamed her face and spoiled her beauty ; \" and she wiped a handkerchief over her own face, warm with the excitement and energy of her speech. \"Oh, mother!\" was all the younger woman could interject in remonstrance, as she placed the last pile of linen in the coffer and closed the heavy lid. \" Ah, thah may say, ' Oh, mother ! ' but thah knows its true. I'll go and have a talk to John in the warehouse. I suppose I shall find him there ; \" and off she went, determined not to let her project cool. It has been said that Mrs. Bancroft was a furrier. It may be added that she had for many years carried on most successfully the extensive wholesale business of her dead husband, in premises situated in the rear of her handsome double- fronted red brick house"], [21, "PRELIMINARY. 7 on Red Bank, Manchester, and was accounted a wealthy woman in her sphere. Wealthy, that is, as the world goes ; her possessions could be reckoned in houses and land, bought and sold as merchandise ; but she had scarcely the true riches, though she went regularly to church, stood in good repute, and had a pro found veneration for religious profession in others. Dingy enough now is the thoroughfare known as Red Bank ; even fifty j-ears ago the deterioration had begun, smoke doing more than the finger of Time to tone down tints of brickwork and stone ; nay, a publican had set his sign over what had been Mrs. Bancroft's door, there were shops where had been private houses, and inferior structures were creeping up the steep hill-sides to ob literate every trace of grass or of the red sand from which the road took its name. Yet was the verdant country close at hand in Mrs. Bancroft's time, grass and flowers and bushes were plentiful atop of the rugged red banks left on either side by successive lower-"], [22, "FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. 8 ino-s of the hill, over which then ran the main road to Rochdale and Bury from Scotland Bridge and the valley of the Irk upwards, and Mrs. Bancroft's house at the foot of the brow was a residence of some pretensions. Twelve years prior to this decided enuncia tion of opinion relative to her favourite grandchild Muriel, her own daughter Ellen was a dark-haired, dark-eyed, vivacious dam sel of sixteen, the youthful roundness of whose cheeks softened the high cheek-bones, which age or illness might define and sharpen as they had done for the elder woman. They were alike short in stature, alike active and notable, but the resolute set of mouth and the energy of the woman had no signs of development in the girl. At that period dancing was an accomplish ment more for the aristocracy than for traders, but a certain Madam Bland had opened an academy in a fashionable part of the town for such as could afford to pay well for instruction, and Mrs. Bancroft did not hesitate to enrol Ellen among the select circle of Madam"], [23, "PRELIMINARY. 9 Bland's pupils, as a finishing touch to an education which had, to say the least, cost much. No retail trader could have gained admis sion for son or daughter into that circle ; the line was drawn at merchants and manufac turers ; but of all those who did most honour to Madam's professorship was John D'Anyer, who, though but the son of a Manchester manufacturer, yet boasted he had blue blood in his veins as in his name. He was barely twenty, yet he stood six feet high, and had a figure as finely propor tioned as his handsome face. Dancing was only one of his many accomplishments, but it was the one in which his peculiar graces of form and manner were most likely to move impressionable hearts ; and Ellen Bancroft was only one of the damsels who sighed for him. But in her case the attraction was mutual. And not alone in minuet or cotillion had they seen and admired each other. The Bancroft and the D'Anyer pews in the Colle giate Church adjoined, there was speaking"], [24, "FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. 10 acquaintance between the elders, and the two young people might be said to have grown up under each other's eye. In Madam Bland's academy the acquain tance ripened rapidly ; it furnished occasions for mutual intercourse unsuspected at home, and led to a step not in the Terpsichorean programme. One sunny morning when early May blos soms scented the air, Miss Bancroft, arrayed as for a fashionable assembly in a dress of cherry colour-and-white satin brocade, her hair elaborately coiled by the peruquier, was handed by her admiring mother into a sedan chair at the door of the house on Red Bank, as was customary on dancing days, and it slightly struck the mother that \"the lass was in an unusual flurry.\" Be this as it may, the chairmen bore the sedan, not to Madam Bland's, but to the Collegiate Church ; and when they again set her down at her unsuspecting mother's door she was the wife of John D'Anyer. No one's advice had been asked, no one's"], [25, "PRELIMINARY. 11 counsel taken. The girl, captivated by a handsome face and graceful figure, had allowed his dominant will to control her. Had any reason existed for secrecy beyond their immature age, it was unknown. Three months later a loud ran-tan, tan, tan, tan, on the heavy knocker, startled the echoes in the Red Bank house. Mrs. Bancroft had just come in from the warehouse for her four o'clock tea, and a maid was carrying the mahogany tea-board, with its freight of tiny handleless cups and saucers, into the house hold room, and almost dropped it in her fright. The clang on the knocker had not ceased when she opened the door, and Mr. John D'Anyer, in a fashionable suit of plum coloured kerseymere, with silver buckles at his breeches' knees and on the instep of his high-heeled shoes, crushed past her into the lobby, and in thick but imperious tones demanded to see his \" wife.\" Margery insisted that he had mistaken the house, and failing to convince him, turned back to seek her mistress in the kitchen."], [26, "FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. To her amazement he followed her, not too steadily, down the passage, to be confronted by Mrs. Bancroft, who stood with her face towards him, by the white deal table, under the broad window, at which Ellen was washing, in a large bowl, lace ruffles and lawn kerchiefs, too dainty to be sent to a common clear-starcher. It was evident the young man had taken too much wine ; his three-cornered hat was awr}T, the ruffles at his wrists, the falling neckcloth edged with lace, were sullied and disordered ; and so Mrs. Bancroft thought were his wits, as he repeated, \" I have come for my wife ; I want my wife.\" \" Your wife ? \" she echoed, and would have added, \" There is no wife of yours here,\" but she chanced to glance towards her daughter, and the words died upon her lips. It needed not his iteration of \" Yes, Ellen ; \u2014 my wife ! \" that white face, that shrinking, trembling figure told all. Whether in wrath, or to keep the girl from fainting, she could never decide with herself,"], [27, "PRELIMINARY. 13 she took up the earthen bowl and dashed its contents, water and lace together, upon the daughter who had deceived her. \" Take your wife, take her ! and never let her darken my doors again ! \" she cried, sternly, and passed out of the kitchen, not to return until the door had closed upon them both, as she had closed the door of her heart. Though an only daughter, Ellen was not an only child. She had a brother three years her senior, training to succeed his mother in the business. His intercession for his sister might have been expected. Nothing of the kind occurred. Samuel Bancroft had not a thought beyond self. He sat down to the tea-table, after a rough pre liminary scrub in the scullery, rendered neces sary by his duties in the skin-yard \u2014 was briefly told what had occurred, bidden never to name his sister again, \u2014 and had no desire to transgress. He could have told, had he been so minded, that he had been deputed to break the secret"], [28, "14 FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. to his mother ; but he preferred to assume ignorance, and wipe his clean hands of the offending pair, as he hoped to wipe his sister out of the mother's will by-and-bye. Months went by \u2014 months which sharpened and hardened the outlines of Sarah Bancroft's face. An idol had been shattered, and nothing had replaced it. Her seat in the Old Church was vacant ; she resolutely passed its walls and trudged forward to St. Ann's (there being no church nearer home at that time) ; but though she heard the words \"Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation,\" Sabbath by Sabbath, she refused to take their import to herself. If there was any softening of her heart, it was unknown ; the silence peremp torily enjoined at the outset became habitual ; her business did not throw her in the way of the D'Anyers, and she knew nothing even of her daughter's whereabouts. Whether she felt more keenly the barb of her child's ungrateful secrecy, or the prolonged estrange ment, could not be told ; but unspoken feeling of some kind brought out more sharply the"], [29, "PRELIMINARY. 15 prominence of her cheek-bone, and ploughed fresh lines on her brow. She had several brothers and brothers-in law in different trades ; but their places of business lying away across the town, they did not often meet. One sleety afternoon in the following Feb ruary, as she was shaking hands with a Bolton hatter, to whom she had sold a large parcel of rabbit-skins (to be felted into veri table beaver), her brother Ralph, a cotton merchant, stepped into the warehouse, amongst piles of skins, and barely waiting until the hatter's back was turned began, \u2014 \"Sarah, dost thah know the tale that's goin' about the town ? \" \"What tale? \" said both eyes and lips. \" Why, that thy daughter Ellen was turned out of the house Avringin' wet, with no clothes but what she stood up in, and is iioav livin' on the charity of the D'Anyers ! \" Mrs. Bancroft changed countenance. \"Wringing wet!\" \"No clothes!\" she echoed, as if unaware Iioav literally Ellen's"], [30, "16 FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. dismissal had been taken, but her pride caught up the one Avord \" charity,\" and her breast heaved as with a pent-up burden. \" Charity ! charity!\" she exclaimed. \"My daughter living upon charity !

But no living on charity!\" and the word came out with a gasp. \" There has been no charity, my good friend,\" said Mr. D'Anyer, with a genial smile. \" No one regretted John's secret and precipi tate match more than myself and Mally \" (his Avife), \" but my son's wife is my daughter, and as such we made her welcome.

Steam poAver had not been introduced into manufactories, and very feAV were fitted up with elaborate machinery. Outlay Avas chiefly for raAv material and Avork-people's Avages. In John D'Anyer's, for instance, Avarpers \u2014 generally women \u2014 carried home great hanks of yarn in their canvas bags, or \" pokes,\" and brought it back on their heads in huge flat balls, Avarped ; that is, threads of sufficient number and length for the piece of cloth, arranged and grouped together sys tematically by means of pegs in the Avar per 's cottage wall. The handloom Aveavers took home the Avarp, with twist for the weft, and brought it back in the piece ; again it Avent out to be bleached or dyed, and, in the case of fustians, to be cut. In these days so many processes are carried on in one set of premises that immense capitals are required. Then John D'Anyer was considered to start under very favourable auspices, and expected to make a fortune, as others had done before him."], [35, "SETTLED. 21 But they Avere plodders, he was not. He Avas proud to p>e his oavii master, and the master of others ; had taken to the business kindly, and Avas not too proud to doff his coat and lend a hand either to putter-out or packer. Then, being vain of his penman ship, he conducted his own correspondence, not a very onerous duty, and kept his own books, with a clerk under him ; and Avas as good a buyer and seller as any on 'Change.

That concerned no one but the people at home. And it must not be supposed that John D'Anyer's proclivity for convivial society was such as to interfere with his business, or make him other than a gentleman, although he had demanded his girl-wife in most unseemlv fashion. He Avas wont to say he \" Avould not give a button for any man Avho could not be anything in any society,\" and certainty the polished gentleman occasionally descended. He Avas, however, a strict disciplinarian in business or out, and his devoted little wife, Avho had not her mother's strength of will, Avas too timid to oppose act or word of his, too nervous to propose aught to which he might object ; and neither years nor mother hood brought her self-reliance. Mrs. Bancroft was loth to admit it even to herself; but Ellen D'Anyer had never quite recovered from the effects of the wetting she had given her tAvelve years before. Her im prudent and impetuous young husband, too"], [37, "SETTLED. 23 excited to reason, had hurried her away at Mrs. Bancroft's harsh bidding, drenched as she Avas ; and though he hailed the first sedan chair they met, there Avas nearly a mile to traverse betAveen Red Bank and Cannon Street, and explanations to folloAV, before dry garments could be substituted. Rheumatic fever was a natural sequence, and life-long delicacy ; mental suffering having been super added to the physical.

This Avas not a very auspicious home-coming for Muriel. She could not forget her glimpse through the sedan window of her father and his companions, or the fright she had before he Avas recognized, and he, on his part, could not forget that she had so seen him. The want of cordiality in his first greeting wTas followed by a restraint not observed toAvards the others. He was conscious that his eldest daughter had seen him at a disadvantage, had seen him guilty of an act of discourtesy to an elderly stranger in the street, and wounded self-esteem suggested that her respect for him and his authority would thereby be lessened. In the clear eyes which said plainly enough, \" Why am I not loved like the rest? \" he read only the glance of a searching spirit to probe his soul, and not feeling comfortable himself, he was not likely to set her at ease.

Now, Muriel, throwing herself, as it Avere, as a soft cushion between them, came in for more than a share of his ill-humours and suspicions, nay, the very alacrity with Avhich she ran to anticipate his Avishes only increased his disfavour. \" A pair of meek lackejTs Avith out a grain of spirit,\" he styled them on one occasion in his scornful cups ; and yet the man could be generous and noble on occasion. Nor were her sisters more amiable after the first few days. They felt themselves super seded, and began to be jealous of her superior manner and accomplishments, as one after another, aunts and cousins, came in and noticed her and her needle-work with out spoken admiration.

At which Miss Marion again turned up her long nose. From this it will be seen that kindliness did not spring up in Muriel's path at home.

At the same time they did not hesitate to take her gifts, or to tax her skill and obligino nature to the uttermost, and scarcely gave thanks for the Avilling service.

Was John D'Anyer's fastidious palate to be catered for, or baking, pickling, preserving, wine-making about, Muriel's untiring activity might be counted on ; but whence came her patience and cheeriness under discouragement only her good mother knew. She, however, had not been at home quite a fortnight, when her mother, Avhose stay-at home habits Avere proverbial, taking advan tage of her husband's absence on a business journey, and of a fine day, said she thought it was about time she Avent to see Lydia, and"], [238, "FORBIDDEN TO MARRY. 224 that if Muriel felt inclined she might bear her company. The April sunshine Avas not brighter than the smile of Muriel as she tripped upstairs for her hat and cloak, and she carried something of the sunshine into the quaint old house and the shaded chamber Avhere sat Lydia in a big easy-chair between the heavily draped four post bed and the fire. She was Avrapped in a blanket, had a pilloAv beneath her feet, and pillows behind her, all tokens of Maggy Black burn's good nursing.
