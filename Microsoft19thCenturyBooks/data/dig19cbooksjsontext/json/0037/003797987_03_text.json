He was seated on the sofa, tugging at a pair of new boots, which seemed exceedingly reluctant to enter upon their functions. \"Nelly,\" said he, suspending his operations, \"I met Lord Alargate in the street an hour ago, and he told me that your friend Compton has refused the appointment just offered him, and intends to return to India immediately. AVhat on earth is the meaning of it ?\" \" Yes, papa,\" she replied, in a voice scarcely ver. in. n"], [10, "ON THE BRINK. 2 audible ; \" he has just been here to announce his intention. It appears that he has received an application of so urgent a nature from his old general, that he does not think he would be justified in neglecting it. He left it with me to show y-ou.\" \"Nonsense, Nelly. It is just a piece of caprice. I confess I have no patience with him. He gets an appointment exactly suited to him, for which he has been waiting for months ; one which requires considerable ability7 and the peculiar experience he has acquired to fill well, and he rejects it. And for what ? To go scampering about the country with five or six hundred men at his back, which any subaltern of a few months' standing would do as well. I am grieved and disappointed, for I like him, and had formed a high opinion of his firmness and consistency. I cannot tell you how much he has fallen in my estima tion.\" \" Father,\" said Lady Tenby, laying her hand on Mr. Halsted's sleeve, \" you must not"], [11, "ON THE BBINK. 3 say a word against Arthur. He goes, because he is the noblest and most generous of men. He returns to India because he loves me, because he knows I love him.\" \" Good God, Nelly ! what is it you mean ? Do you know what you are saying ?\" exclaimed Air. Halsted, sinking back upon the sofa. \" Yes, father, perfectly. We love each other, and Arthur goes, lest a shadow of suspicion should rest upon my name.\" \" Aiy child, my poor, dear child,\" he said, taking her hand and drawing her to him. \" Tell me how it all happened.\" -She sat down beside him, and told him, with the utmost unreserve, the story of her love, from the first moment when she was aware of it herself to the events of the preceding day, and Mrs. Thorpe's visit to Compton that morning. Her heart was so full that it was a relief to her to pour out her feelings to one of whose sympathy and compassion she felt secure, although her confidant was a man, and that man her father. She recounted all the pre-"], [12, "4 ON THE BRINK. cautions she had taken to preserve her secret, and how she had allowed that secret to escape her. And with the same reliance on her father's belief in her truth, she expressed her deep repentance for her weakness of a moment, and the firm resolution she had taken never again to expose herself to a repetition of it. And her father believed her. It would have seemed to him like sacrilege to doubt the purity of his daughter's mind. That her intercourse with Compton had been marked by a want of caution she had herself admitted ; but perhaps those about her, her aunt, himself, were more to blame than her. And then how much was to be said in extenuation ! How natural that in her isolated position she should seek for support in the attachment of so devoted a . friend ! In the impulse of an unguarded moment they had been betrayed into an act of great indiscretion, to say the least of it, but Nelly had assured him that it would never occur again, and he felt convinced that it never would. And how could he"], [13, "ON THE BRINK. 5 presume to sit in judgment on the offenders, when his own culpable negligence was the primary cause of the offence ! He certainly- had been greatly startled, if not shocked, by Lady Tenby's first abrupt avowal, but as she went on with her disclosures this feeling changed into one of deep commise ration, not only for her, but for Compton. He had long dwelt with satisfaction upon the thought that when, in the natural course of things, his daughter should be deprived of the support of a father, she would still find an efficient protector in her adopted brother. Under this idea he had encouraged their intimacy to the utmost of his power, and had almost taught himself to believe that the imaginary bond which united them was a reality. At all events, it had never entered into his head to suppose that the attachment which existed between them exceeded the limits of fraternal affection. And yet he might have taken warning by the suggestions of his own brain, for he had occasionally"], [14, "ON THE BRINK. 6 speculated upon the possibility of Lord Tenby's death leaving his widow at liberty to form other ties, and where could she make a better choice than in the tried friend of her youth ? AAliere could he find a son-in-law more agreeable to himself? And now all these dreams were dispelled by one moment of weakness. He could not help wishing that Airs. Thorpe had either seen and heard nothing, or that she had been less rigid in her scruples. He could not at first bring himself to believe in the absolute neces sity of the measure ou which she had insisted. Notwithstanding his daughter's confession, perhaps in consequence of it, he still had the firmest confidence in her high 'principles, in Compton's sense of honour. Had he been in Auntie's place, in all probability he would have been less exacting. Still, if she had erred, it was on the side of prudence, and he felt that she had a right to expect his support. After what had passed, supposing Compton were to remain in England, he could no"], [15, "ON THE BRINK. longer, as a father, sanction the familiar intimacy of his intercourse with Lady Tenby, and yet it would be extremely difficult to put an end to it without exciting remark. He now opened his eyes to the risk she had run of an unfavourable interpretation being put upon her actions. She had escaped hitherto, but he shuddered to think that it was rather owing to good fortune, and to the unsullied reputation she had maintained through so many years of trial, than to any care of his. How could he ever have forgiven himself had the breath of censure, through his imprudence, rested upon the daughter of whom he was so proud r As these thoughts gradually passed through his mind, he became to a certain extent recon ciled to Compton's departure. It was in evitable, if they all wished to escape the possibility of still greater evils. He did not however think it necessary to take Nelly into his confidence on this point. He saw that she was nearly heart-broken, and his"], [16, "ON THE BBINK. 8 business was to console her as well as he was able. When she had finished her tale, he drew her to him and kissed her. \" My own poor darling,\" he said, \" I ought perhaps to say something in censure of y-our conduct, but the suffering you have brought upon y7ourself is so severe, that I have not courage to add to it by words of blame. Moreover, I believe every word y-ou have uttered. I believe you are now fully aware of your imprudence, that y-ou deeply7 repent it, and that it would never be renewed. And I will say the same of Compton, though his fault is less excusable than yours. At all events, he certainly7 shows his desire to make all the reparation in his power by the course he has taken, and by so doing he has acquired a fresh claim to my gratitude and respect.\" If Lady Tenby had entertained a hope that her father would have been satisfied with something short of Compton's actual banishment, these words effectually- dispelled it. Still she derived some comfort from the tone of deep"], [17, "ON THE BRINK. 9 sympathy iu which they were uttered, still more from the manner in which he had spoken of her lover, for it was on his account that she had dreaded the effect of her revelations on her father. She had commenced them on the impulse of the moment, for it had never entered into the head of either Compton or herself to make a confidant of Air. Halsted, but now that they were made she felt greatly relieved. She thanked her father over and over again for his kindness and forbearance, and then gave him Compton's message. \"I am sorry,\" he said, \"not to see him to day, but I hope that while he is still in England he will make no alteration in his habits, as far as we are concerned. I will call on him early to-morrow and tell him so. You will not be the only one to miss him, Nelly, when he goes.\" The evening passed away drearily enough. The subject which engrossed the thoughts of all was not again alluded to, but on the following morning Air. Halsted paid his promised visit to"], [18, "10 ON THE BRINK. Compton, who was fully prepared for it. Lady Tenby had taken the precaution of informing him by a few lines, dispatched the evening before, of all that had occurred since they parted, and of her father's intentions. Mr. Halsted entered at once upon the subject which had brought him. He said that he had no wish to make any allusion to the past. AVhat was done could not be undone, and though he deeply regretted the necessity for Compton's departure, under the circum stances he thought it unavoidable. He had had a long conversation with his daughter, and placed such reliance on her assurances, and Compton's honourable feelings, that he would put no impediment in the way of their inter course as long as the latter remained in England. He expected Compton to dine with them that day, and indeed on every day that he was not otherwise engaged. \" Poor Nelly has much to go through,\" he said. \" We must endeavour to make it as easy lor her as possible.\""], [19, "ON THE BRINK. 11 Having said this, he took his leave at once, barely giving Compton time to express his thanks for the indulgence with which he was treated, and which he was the first to acknow ledge he was far from deserving. The consequence was that Compton passed all his leisure hours at Ealing ; but it was very rarely, and then only by accident, that he found himself alone with Lady- Tenby. They were both desirous of avoiding a tete-a-tete. Circumstanced as they were, the presence of a third person seemed necessary to save them from embarrassment, for their thoughts were wholly engrossed by the one forbidden topic, any allusion to which would have been a violation of the generous confidence reposed in them. But for this abstinence Lady Tenby, at least, indemnified herself to the best of her power when protected by the presence of her father or Airs. Thorpe. Poor Auntie was still unforgiven, and her niece seemed to take peculiar pleasure in addressing Compton, in her hearing, in terms of the most affectionate"], [20, "ON THE BRINK. 12 familiarity. There was certainly nothing in her language that she might not have used with perfect propriety to a brother, but after what had passed, some of her expressions rather grated on the good lady's sense of decorum. She made no comment however, for she pretty well understood Nelly's motive, and she remarked with satisfaction that Compton himself, who always showed her the same respect and attention that he had ever done, so far from taking advantage of these demon strations, seemed at times annoyed by them, and desirous of repressing them. She com forted herself with the hope that, before long, her niece would return to a more placable frame of mind, and do justice to the motives by which she was actuated. AVhen Mr. Halsted was present, as was always the case in the evening, Lady Tenby's manner to Compton was perfectly natural and unaffected. AVithout giving open ex pression to her feelings, she made no secret of them. Sitting on the sofa, with her father's"], [21, "ON THE BRINK. 13 hand in hers, she would make Compton bring his chair close to them, and put question upon question respecting all that was likely to befall him in India, discussing her own plans in return. But as the time for his departure approached she fell into a state of restlessness and depression, from which at times it was almost impossible to rouse her. Still she did her best to assume a cheerful manner before Compton, for she felt how greatly his distress of mind would be increased by the sight of her own. Her greatest, almost her only source of consolation, was in his promise to write to her by every opportunity. On the last night of his stay in London she was particularly urgent on this point, returning to it over and over again with increasing excitement. Compton, of course, promised compliance, but at length he could not refrain from saying, \" Is it because you doubt me, Nelly, that you repeat your injunctions so often ?\" \" Doubt you ! Oh no ! AVhat injunctions ? What have I been saying ?\""], [22, "14 ON THE BRINK. He saw that in her agitation she had seized upon a phrase as a sort of safety-valve, and had been using it without a meaning. To calm her, he said, \" We were talking of our corre spondence. You may depend upon my writing to you whenever I have it in my power, but you must not expect to hear by every mail. I shall be up the country, and the communica tion is any-thing but regular.\" \" But you promise to do your best. And, oh Arthur, you will take care of yourself! You will not needlessly7 expose yourself to danger. How should I ever forgive myself if any7 harm happened to you I I, who drove you to it ! Arthur, remember my life is bound up iu y-ours !\" \" Nelly, Nelly !\" said Air. Halsted, reprov ingly. \" Yes, father, I know ; but it is true, and at this last moment the truth may be told. Though half the world divides us, we shall still be all in all to each other. Is it not so, Arthur ?\""], [23, "ON THE BRINK. 15 \" Nelly, how can I answer you without repeating the offence for which I have received forgiveness ? But of this rest assured, that I shall never love my sister less than I do at this moment.\" Mr. Halsted felt exceedingly uncomfortable at the turn the conversation was taking, and he awoke to the consciousness that his present position was not a very dignified one. \" Now, Nelly,\" he said, \" we have had quite enough of this. Y'ou may be quite certain of Compton's regard and friendship. Alore than this he cannot offer, nor the Countess of Tenby accept.\" \" Ah, yes,\" she replied. \" I forgot ; the Countess of Tenby is tied to the stake. Now I begin to feel that our separation, painful though it be, is better than living in the same country on the terms to which we should be condemned. That indeed would be worse than death itself.\" \" Nelly,\" said Compton, after a short silence, \" give me y-our hand.\""], [24, "ON THE BRINK. 16 She obeyed, and he led her across the room to where Airs. Thorpe was sitting, a silent, but not inattentive observer of the scene which had just been enacted before her. \" Auntie,\" he continued, \"\"we are come to tell you that we are convinced that in all you have done y7ou have only had our good in view. We know that you grieve for us, and for having been the unwilling instrument of our un happiness. If we have not always done justice to your motives, forgive us, for all doubt of them is passed. Nelly- will tell y-ou that her trust in your affection is the same as ever ; she knows that in her greatest distress she can always turn to you as to a mother.\" Lady Tenby hardly needed this exhortation. For the last few days her heart had reproached her for the pain she was inflicting by the per sistence with which she rejected all her aunt's advances. She was desirous of expressing her contrition for her past conduct, but hardly7 knew how to set about it,\" and now eagerly availed herself of the opening offered her."], [25, "ON THE BRINK. 17 \" Forgive me, Auntie,\" she exclaimed, throw ing herself into Airs. Thorpe's arms ; \" forgive me, but me alone. Arthur has never partici pated in my wicked conduct, though he tries to shield me at his own expense.\" It is difficult to say to whom this reconcilia- tion gave most pleasure. Mrs. Thorpe and her niece both rejoiced at the termination of the unnatural state of estrangement in which they had been living for the last fortnight ; Compton felt greatly relieved at having been the means of restoring a good understanding between Lady Tenby and the aunt to whose devoted affection she was so greatly indebted ; and even Mr. Halsted, who, notwithstanding his respect for Airs. Thorpe, had at times felt rather jealous of her influence with his daughter, confessed that he was delighted to see that Nelly was at last willing to listen to the voice of reason. Compton intended to take his leave of them that night. He and Nelly were about to part, with the conviction that many years must c vol. in."], [26, "ON THE BRINK. 18 elapse before they met again, if indeed they ever were to meet again ; without a hope to cheer them, or, if a hope there was, it was one they dared not whisper to themselves. Mr. Halsted was less scrupulous, and, being of a sanguine temperament, looked forward to the time when Compton might avow his love without fear of reproof. Of all the party, to all outward appearance, Auntie was the most overcome. \" God bless you, dear Arthur !\" she said. \"We are not likely to meet again on this side the grave, but you take with you an old woman's blessing and her eternal grati tude.\" \" Nonsense, Auntie,\" Compton replied, with an attempt at cheerfulness. \" You prophesied when we last parted that you would see me return a colonel, and your prophecy came true. The least you can do for me now is to say that you expect me to be a general when next we meet.\" He rose to depart. \"Arthur, Arthur,\" ex- claimed Lady Tenby, \"you must not, you"], [27, "ON THE BRINK. 19 shall not go without saying one word about your return. Give me some hope, something to look forward to. I care not how long ; ten, twenty years ; but do not leave me in this un certainty ; it will kill me. You cannot mean that we are taking leave of each other for ever.\" She threw her arms around him, as if to enforce his stay, while the tears streamed down her face. It was the first time she had ever given way so completely. Compton's agitation was almost as great as hers. \" No, no, my love,\" he replied, scarcely knowing what he said \" not for ever ; not for a day, if it lay with me. I go, because I have no choice; because I have given my word to those who had a right to exact it from me, and who alone can decide upon my return. It is the penance due \u2014 -most justly due \u2014 to my fault, and it is for your father, whom I of fended, to fix its duration.\" Mr. Halsted was considerably embarrassed by this appeal, which took him completely by"], [28, "20 ON THE BRINK. surprise. He thought it hardly fair in Compton to throw the whole onus upon him, nor was he much edified by the terms in which that gallant gentleman had just ad dressed his daughter, and which appeared to him, not unreasonably, as an infraction of the tacit compact existing between them. But the sight of that daughter's pale and tearful face, if it did not entirely remove his dis pleasure, at all events induced him to moderate its expression. \" You are altogether mistaken, Sir Arthur,\" he said. \"Believing in your repentance for the offence to which you allude, I forgave it freely and fully, without a thought of imposing upon you what you are pleased to term a penance. But when a man allows himself to tell a married woman that he loves her, unchecked by her, the least that her friends can do is to insist on their separation, not as a punishment, but as a measure of common prudence. This penalty you and Nelly have brought upon yourselves, and I am bound to say that what has passed in the last"], [29, "ON THE BBINK. 21 ten minutes confirms me in my conviction that it is absolutely necessary-.\" \" But not for ever, father,\" said Lady Tenby. \" I know it is right Arthur should go, but not for ever. Remember where he is going, think of the dangers to which he will be exposed, and set some term to his banishment. Not for my sake, but for his, for I think you loved him once.\" \"And do still,\" said Mr. Halsted. \"God knows it is no pleasure to me to see you both miserable. If I grieve for you, Nelly, I grieve for him, too ; but as long as you both retain your present feelings, I cannot ask him to return. No doubt, though you may not think so now, time will deaden them in both of you, and leave in their place a friendship which you may both avow. AVhen that time arrives, no one will welcome Arthur back more cordially than I shall.\" \"But, father, name some time, however distant, some certainty. Or will you refuse me in my misery the first prayer I ever made"], [30, "ON THE BRINK. 22 you ?\" She threw herself on her knees at his feet, and tried to take his hand. \"Nelly, Nelly,\" said Mr. Halsted, raising her up and kissing her, \" try to calm yourself, and tell me what it is you wish.\" The fact is, he did not know what to say, his intense love for his daughter struggling against his better judgment, and gaining ground every- moment. \" What I wish is, that you would say when Arthur may return to England.\" \" Well, my love, that must depend in a great measure upon yourselves, and the control you obtain over your own feelings. Of course a reasonable time must elapse. You said you would be content if in ten or twenty years \" \" Oh, father, do not turn against me the words wrung from me by my despair. Twenty years is a life. Who knows which of us will be alive in twenty years ?\" \" My love, if you had not interrupted me, I was going to say that I at all events could not reckon upon living twenty years. I meant to propose ten years.\""], [31, "ON THE BRINK. 23 \" Ten years or twenty is the same thing. I said ten or twenty as I would have said a hundred.\" \" Aly dear Nelly, what can I say to please you ? Auntie,\" he continued, turning to Airs. Thorpe, \" come and help us. After all, you were the person to pronounce the sentence, and it is but just that you should fix its dura tion.\" Airs. Thorpe was anything but grateful for this invocation. She saw that Air. Halsted was gradually yielding to his daughter's in fluence, and half expected to hear him rescind the decree of separation altogether. But while she lamented what she thought inexcusable weakness on the part of her brother-in-law, she was all the time congratulating herself on being permitted to keep aloof from the discus sion. This immunity was now lost. Her opinion was asked, and she had no excuse at hand for refusing to give it. She saw Nelly's imploring eyes fixed upon her, and her heart \u2014 the heart she had flattered herself was so hard"], [32, "24 ON THE BRINK. \u2014 gave way at once. \"I think,\" she said, \"that if Arthur cannot return with a clear conscience in five years, he never will.\" It certainly was not exactly a solution of the question, but was accepted as such by all con cerned. \" Five years be it,\" said Mr. Halsted, carefully avoiding anything that could lead to a renewal of the debate. \" God bless you, Comp ton. You know you have the best wishes of every7 one in this house.\" \" And our esteem,\" said Mrs. Thorpe. \"And our affection,\" murmured Nelly7, as, assuming the privilege of a brother, he kissed her forehead. In another minute he was gone."], [33, "ON THE BRINK. 25 CHAPTER II. With Compton's departure Lady Tenby's strength of mind returned. She made the discovery, as others had done before her, that misfortune, when consummated, is easier to bear than when only in anticipation. She regained her cheerfulness, and when she alluded to her absent friend, it was always in free and unembarrassed terms. It would pro bably be too much to say that she felt any great amount of remorse for having given way to her feelings, or indeed that she made much effort to overcome them ; but she certainly did reproach herself for not having confined them to her own breast, for having allowed her"], [34, "26 ON THE BRINK. secret to be wrested from her. She felt more over deeply grateful to her father for the indulgence with which he had treated her, and she fully determined to avoid, to the best of her ability, everything which could give him any further cause of annoyance. She thought that the best return she could make for his kindness would be to banish all appearance of discontent, to return to her old habits, and resume as much as possible her wonted anima tion of manner. She did this with a facility that astonished him, but the explanation was not so very difficult. In Nelly's view of the case the worst was past, and she had obtained far more favourable terms than she had any right to expect. No doubt five years were a long term, but they would come to an end at last*, and what were they compared to the unlimited separation with which she had been threatened ? She was also quite aware that in Compton's absence alone she could hope to regain that command over herself which had deserted her in her hour of need. Notwith-"], [35, "ON THE BBINK. 27 standing her father's predictions, she did not for a moment believe that her feelings for Compton could ever change ; but, at least, long before they again met she would have learnt to keep them under control. From one source of anxiety she was free. She was not one to doubt where she loved ; and of Compton's affection and constancy she felt as certain as of her own. They were bound to each other by ties which death itself would hardly loose. They could never be more to each other than they were at present, but she felt assured that they could never be less. Auntie was completely restored to her good graces, though at times she was a little im patient at the anxious looks which that worthy lady bestowed upon her, whenever Compton's name was mentioned by strangers. On such occasions Lady Tenby had more than once attacked her with a recklessness which made poor Airs. Thorpe tremble in her shoes, from fear of what might be coming next. Once Lady Windermere expressed her astonishment"], [36, "28 ON THE BRINK. at Compton's conduct, and Lady Tenby, seeing her aunt's eyes fixed upon her, volunteered an explanation. \"I dare say,\" she said, \"it does seem odd, but I will tell you, in strict confi dence of course, that it was all Auntie's doing. She it was who drove him into banishment.\" \" Nelly, Nelly7, what are you saying ?\" ex claimed Mrs. Thorpe, in great alarm. \"You must know, Cecilia,\" continued her ladyship, not heeding the interruption, \" that an attachment, pour le bon motif, of course, has long existed between Sir Arthur Compton and Miss Elizabeth Thorpe. But Auntie is am bitious, and I am convinced, though she will not acknowledge it, that she has refused to accept the hand of any one under the rank of a general. It is to comply with this condition, I verily believe, that Arthur has returned to India.\" \"He must be a great loss to you?\" said Lady Windermere, inquisitively. \" The greatest,\" was the ready reply. \" But he will come back to us some day or other.\""], [37, "ON THE BRINK. 29 Months passed on, and during the whole of that winter Lady Tenby flew about from one friend's house to another, sometimes alone, sometimes accompanied by7 her father. The longest visit she paid was to Sir Philip Compton's, and there, if she had not previously schooled herself into an appearance of in- difference, her powers of endurance would have been tried to the utmost. In both Lady Winifred's mouth and her husband's Sir Arthur's name was familiar as a household word, always accompanied by some expression of regret ; on the part of the gentleman, that his cousin had not been satisfied with the distinction he had already obtained ; on that of the lady, that her plans for uniting Sir Arthur and Mabel Langley in the bonds of holy wedlock had not been more successful. \" They would have suited each other so well, Nelly,\" she said ; \" and now in a few months more I suppose she will be Mrs. O'Hara, for she will be one and twenty in the spring, and I see no chance of her changing her"], [38, "30 ON THE BRINK. mind. She is positively infatuated with that man.\" \"Then, dear Winnie, do not try to influence her. Her father was quite justified in opposing her engagement at the time it was contracted, as he might well suppose her to be too young to know her own mind. But that is not the case now ; she has had the run of society for four years, and has never wavered for a moment. Let her be happy in her own way. We can do so little for the happiness of others, that I make it a point of conscience never to interfere, when by so doing I may mar or obstruct it.\" \"Yes, if it will be for her happiness, but that is exactly the point in question. Banish ment and poverty are but sorry ingredients in the cup of happiness.\" \"The banishment will be but for a time, and the poverty will not seem poverty to them. In short, I like Alabel so much, and I have heard Captain O'Hara spoken of in such high terms, that I quite espouse their cause.\""], [39, "ON THE BBINK. 31 \" Ah, in that speech I recognize Sir Arthur's influence. But confess you were disappointed when, after all I told you of their mysterious conversations, you found that he had only been pleading the cause of another. If he had married Alabel, in all probability he would not have thought of returning to India.\" Before Lady Tenby could answer, Aliss Langley herself, who was staying in the house, entered the room. \" Alabel,\" said her cousin, \" we have been talking of you. Nelly has been fighting your battles, and has half converted me ; so as you are not likely to quarrel, I will leave you together, and go and see what I am to give you for dinner to-day.\" \"I saw you had a letter from India this morning, Lady Tenby,\" said Miss Alabel. \"I hope it contained good news.\" Which, being interpreted, meant: \"Does it contain any message for me ?\" Compton had been as good as his word. From every place on his journey out at which"], [40, "32 ON THE BRINK. a letter could be posted, he had despatched one to Lady Tenby, and since his arrival in India he had written with as much regularity as circumstances would admit of. In these letters he always expressed himself with all the affectionate warmth of a brother, but without an allusion to any stronger feeling, and Nelly was in the habit of reading them out, without missing a word, for the edification of her father and aunt. She answered them in the same strain, and, as far as these appearances went, they both seemed to be reconciled to their fate. Perhaps the seals on the envelopes said more than the letters themselves. They both bore the old emblem of the leaf, with its motto, \" Je ne change qu'en mourant.\" Compton's had been given him by Nelly on the last day he had passed in England ; hers was its facsimile, made expressly7 for her. In one of these missives Compton men tioned O'Hara, and begged Lady- Tenby, if she could find or make an opportunity, to let Miss Langley know that it was her lover's fixed"], [41, "ON THE BRINK. 33 determination to come over to England as early in the following year as he could obtain leave. This message Nelly had found means to convey to Alabel ; and it is not therefore to be wondered at, if that young lady took peculiar interest in the letter with the Indian postmark, which had been placed in Nelly's hands at breakfast time, when the Compton post-bag regularly made its appearance. To Miss Langley's question Lady Tenby replied, \"Excellent. The rebellious tribes, alarmed probably by the preparations made against them, have sent in their submission, and there will be no fighting. It appears also that a certain Captain O'Hara has obtained leave of absence on urgent private business. Sir Arthur say-s that the general impression is that he is going home in search of a wife, and as he may be expected in April, he advises any young lady who may have designs on him to prepare to receive him, and set her house in order.\" \" Oh, Lady Tenby, what am I to do ? My VOL. III. o"], [42, "34 ON THE BRINK. father must be warned, and he will think that I am in correspondence with Alyles.\" \" Not at all. Just tell him that you heard of Captain O'Hara's intention through me, that you cannot doubt with what intention he is coming, and that as the term fixed by Lord George will then have expired, you hope, after so long a probation, he will not refuse his consent any7 longer.\" \"I think,\" said Alabel, \" I will write that to mamma, but I fear he will be very angry7. Ought I not to tell Winnie ?\" \" Yes, certainly. I would not tell her, that it might come from y-ou.\" Lady Winifred was not pleased with the information, and was inclined to be rather hard upon her cousin, but Sir Philip stopped her. \" That would have been all very well yester day,\" he said, \"while the matter was still in abeyance, but now that it is settled, join with me in wishing Mabel joy, and every happiness she cau desire.\" And Lady AVinifred, who really- loved her"], [43, "ON THE BRINK. 35 cousin, and had clung to her grievance rather from habit and the suggestions of others than from conviction, complied with a very- good grace. But matters were not so easily- settled with the father as with the cousins. Lady George wrote back to say that she and her husband had never been so disagreeably surprised in their lives as by the receipt of Alabel's letter. That, never having heard Captain O'Hara's name mentioned for years, they had naturally concluded that the whole thing was at an end. \" However,\" she continued, \" Lord George desires me to say that if you wish to make a fool of yourself you are at liberty to do so ; he will make no further attempt to prevent it, but washes his hands of the whole concern. This, however, is not to be taken as expressing his ap probation, and he will not further what he con siders as a piece of madness, by word or deed. He will not ask Captain O'Hara into his house, nor will he allow you to be married from it. Still less will he consent to give yrou away, nor"], [44, "36 ON THE BRINK. must you expect any pecuniary assistance from him.

But then followed a postscript. \" Aly darling, I have only just time to smuggle in these few words, to say7, that though y-our father is much displeased just now, I hope he will calm down by degrees. So keep up your spirits, and trust to me to do my best for you. \" Al. L.\" But, notwithstanding these words of comfort, Alabel was in despair. \" What am I to do ?\" she said to Lady Tenby. \"I shall not see more of Alyles than if he remained in India, for I am to return home next week.\" \" Ask Winnie to invite you to accompany them to London.\""], [45, "ON THE BRINK. 37 \" Oh, no, I cannot do that. \" Why not ? I am sure Sir Philip will have no objection, and I can see that Winnie is coming round to our way of thinking.\" \" Yes ; but there is a reason why I cannot ask her.\" \" Shall I ? \" Oh, no. The fact is,\" she continued, in a hesitating manner, \"her brother wished me to marry him, and of course it would annoy him if he were exposed to meet Alyles at his sister's house.\" \" Do you mean the duke ?\" \" Y^es ; but please not to mention it to any one. He was here a short time before you came, and proposed to me then. I cannot tell you what pain it gave me, and he was so kind and gentle when he saw my mind was made up, and positively forbade Winnie's talking to me about it. You see I cannot do anything that muiht distress him.\" \" No, certainly not. You are a dear, good girl, and well deserve the happiness which I"], [46, "ON THE BBINK. 38 am sure is in store for you. And to pave the way to it, it seems to me the best thing you can do is to return with me to Ealing, and re main there till you are Mrs. O'Hara.\" \"Oh, Lady Tenby, are you really- in earnest ?\" \" Quite so, subject to my father's approval. But for that I can answer ; so you had better lose no time in writing home for permission to accept my offer.\" Mabel could not find words in which to ex press her gratitude, and no doubt it was an act of good nature on Lady Tenby's part, who thus relieved her from great embarrassment. But how few of our best actions even are entirely free from a selfish motive ! Certainly this one was not. O'Hara was a clear friend of Compton's, and in addition to the pleasure of obliging one who had such a claim upon her, by possessing herself of that gentleman's cynosure she was pretty certain of insuring his constant attendance at Ealing, when she promised herself to extract from him a minute"], [47, "ON THE BRINK. 39 and detailed account of his colonel's sayings and doings since his arrival in India. Comp ton's letters were as full of his proceedings as they well could be, but when was a letter ever satisfactory, when each phrase suggests a question, or relates a fact which seems to require some explanation ? Aliss Langley had no difficulty in obtaining her father's permission to accompany- Lady Tenby-, instead of returning home. He had no town house of his own, and his daughter during the London season had always been a guest of one or other of her numerous connections. His assent was signified as usual by Lady- George, who could not refrain from hinting her suspi cions of what was in agitation. Her husband either was, or pretended to be, profoundly ignorant that Mabel had any other object in view than that of opening the campaign as early as possible. There was one sign, how ever \u2014 at least, so his daughter interpreted it \u2014 of his relenting a little. On other occasions he had always given her an extra fifty pounds,"], [48, "40 ON THE BRINK. in addition to her small allowance, for extra ordinary expenses; on the present one it was doubled, accompanied by a hope that she would make a good use of it. A few clays later Lady Tenby and her charge were installed in the villa at Ealing, both in a state of feverish excitement ; the one from anticipations of happiness soon to be realized, the other from recollections of happi ness never to return, recollections which every room, every piece of furniture, almost every7 flower in the garden, recalled but too vividly. From these, the scenes in which the last two or three months had been passed had for the time, and to a certain extent, drawn off her thoughts, but now at home, they returned in full force. To meet them she summoned up all the energy of her nature. She was deter mined not to be beat, and she succeeded ; but she was obliged to call in to her aid every resource that society placed at her disposal. Alabel was the scape-goat, and though she sometimes remonstrated, her objections were"], [49, "ON THE BRINK 41 overruled. \" My clear Alabel,\" Lady Tenby once said, \"pray- remember this is the last season you will probably pass in London for some y-ears to come, and I mean y-ou to make the most of it. It will be quite time enough when Captain O'Hara arrives to withdraw from the world.\" And in this reasoning she was encouraged by Mr. Halsted, who, for more reasons than one, thought it expedient that his daughter should resume her former way7 of life. Compton had already7 passed out of the recol lection of most of those who a y7ear before had been in the habit of meeting him daily ; but had his departure been followed by Lady Tenby's retirement from the busy scene, in all probability- they would both have been the objects of surmises more ingenious than chari table. Auntie, indeed, thought that her niece was not taking the right way to acquire the forti tude and resignation from which alone she could hope for permanent peace of mind. Night after night she saw Nelly7 rush off to"], [50, "42 ON X.HE BRINK. some ball or party with a feverish flush on her cheek, while every morning she appeared at breakfast pale and restless, complaining of lassitude and broken sleep. Airs. Thorpe once ventured on a remonstrance, and asked if it was absolutely necessary- to keep some engagement which Lady Tenby- had just predicted would be anything but amusing. \" YTes, Auntie, absolutely necessary. In the first place, it is my duty to Mabel ; in the next place, cest mon metier. I do not mean to say that, if I were to begin my7 career over again, I would adopt the line I have, but it is too late now to draw back. There are many7 changes I would make if I could.\" Mrs. Thorpe said no more, for they were getting on dangerous ground ; but she asked herself more than once how it was to end. AVhen the excitement of dissipation came to an end, as it must do sooner or later, what was there to replace it ? It was not an easy ques tion to answer, for as yet Nelly7 had not learnt to look for support in affliction where alone"], [51, "ON THE BBINK. 43 it is to be found. AVould that time ever come? One exception there was to this perpetual round of gaiety. On the days when the Indian mail was expected, nothing would have tempted Lady Tenby to stir out of the house till the letters had been delivered. Again Alabel was cited as the cause of this excep tional proceeding. It would be so hard upon her, poor girl, to take her out when her whole heart was in the Alarsculles post-bag. And Alabel believed, and was grateful. At length a dispatch was received by Lady- Tenby from O'Hara himself, to announce that he meant to return by the next steamer, and that he might be expected early in June. He had of course learnt from Compton that his ladye-love was residing at Air. Halsted's, and accordingly one fine morning he made his appearance at the villa. When he was an nounced, Lady Tenby very discreetly- with drew, taking Auntie with her, and leaving Miss Langley to receive him alone, notwith-"], [52, "ON THE BRINK. 44 standing that young lady's entreaties and remonstrances. She returned however to the drawing-room before O'Hara concluded his visit, not a little curious to see the hero of Alabel's romance. She found him a fine, tall, soldierlike man, with all the polished refine ment of an Irish gentleman united to a frank, hearty- cordiality of manner, which seemed to compel intimacy at once. Aluch to her relief, he had not in his speech the least tinge of brogue, which she held in great horror ; but when he was excited, or spoke rapidly-, an attentive ear might detect a slight foreign accent, for he had been brought up in France, and all his early7 life had been passed abroad. They were mutually attracted to each other, and before long were talking as familiarly7 as if they7 had known each other all their lives. After the first few sentences the conversa tion naturally fell upon Compton, of whom he gave very satisfactory accounts, adding, \" He would not trust me with a letter ; he said I should be sure to forget it, or give it to the"], [53, "ON THE BRINK. 45 wrong person ; but I understood that he had written himself by the same steamer which brought me.\" \" Yes,\" Lady Tenby replied, \" I received it last night. He tells me he has been appointed to settle the terms of submission with these insurgent tribes.\" \" And very well he will do it,\" rejoined O'Hara. \" It is a great compliment paid him ; but the fact is, whatever he undertakes he suc ceeds in, and I suppose the government are beginning to find it out.\" \" How did you think he was looking ? He talked of being a good deal harassed.\" \" Well, he was. The regiment was a little out of order, and he had to put matters to rights. But that is all satisfactorily settled now7. He is, or was when I left him, well enough ; but somehow, I notice a change in him, of manner I mean. He is so much more serious and sedate than he used to be, some times almost stern if things do not please him. In short, you have not sent us back the"], [54, "46 ON THE BRINK. Compton we sent you. He looks ten years older. But he is, and always will be without an equal in the world, in my estimation at least.\" Lady Tenby might have replied, \" And in mine too ;\" but she confined the thought to her own breast, and O'Hara continued: \"I told him I was certain he had left his heart in England, for I remember having experienced something of the same sort myself once upon a time ; but he assured me that the only chance he had had of making himself agreeable to any young lady was to a Aliss Langley, Mabel Langley I think was the name he mentioned, and she would have nothing to say- to him.\" \" Then he told you what was very7 far from the truth,\" said Lady Tenby-, laughing. \" I heard a great deal of his intercourse with Miss Langley at the time, and I know from the best authority that she had a great deal to say to him, of what nature I leave you to conjecture.\" \" Well, I hope she will be able to reconcile"], [55, "ON THE BBINK. 47 it to her conscience. But, Lady Tenby7, you seem so good-natured, will y-ou allow me to ask your advice on rather a delicate point. Do you not think I ought to write to Lord George ?\" \"Alost decidedly, by this day's post, and Mabel must write to her mother. Have yon had time to form your plans ?\" \" I have had nothing else to do for the last six weeks. I wish to get our marriage over as soon as possible, that we may make the most of my leave. We will go straight to Ireland for a week or two, and then pass the next year in wandering all over Europe, and seeing all that is best worth seeing.\" \" A capital plan. What do you say7, Alabel ?\" \"I think,\" said Miss Langley, \"I ought first to ascertain the wishes of my7 father and mother.\" \" I do not suppose they will interfere with your projects,\" replied Lady Tenby. \" I think Lord George gives y-ou carte blanche.\""], [56, "ON THE BRINK. 48 Mabel could not repress a sigh. She was deeply hurt by her father's conduct, which threw her so completely on the kindness of a comparative stranger in her hour of need. AVhat steps she could take, with a view to soften him, had been discussed more thau once between her and her hostess, but without any7 satisfactory result. Lord and Lady Henry Langley7 had promised to attend at the mar riage, as well as the Comptons, Sir Philip undertaking to give her away-; but the pre sence of her father and mother, the one thing needful in her ey-es, seemed past praying for. O'Hara, to whom all this had been communi cated during their tete-a-tete, was indignant. In addition to the vexation it inflicted on Alabel, he looked upon it as an insult to him self, though from motives of delicacy he kept this feeling concealed. \" Never mind, Mabel,\" he said, for he well understood the cause of her disquiet ; \" the first visit we pay shall be to Lord George.

We breakfast at ten, lunch at two, and dine at half-past seven. At all or any of these meals we shall be delighted to see you, and you had better begin by dining here to-day-, and making my father's ac quaintance.\" O'Hara was only too happy to accept this invitation, and promised to be back as soon as he had seen his agent. \" I am enchanted with him, Mabel,\" said Lady Tenby, as soon as his back was turned, \"and congratulate you most sincerely. But we must not keep him to ourselves. We will have one or two regular gatherings, to present him in form to your connections. He is not a man to be ashamed of.\" She was as good as her word, and better, for she never took up a matter by halves. VOL. III. e"], [58, "ON THE BRINK. 50 Unknown to Miss Langley, she wrote to Lady George, representing to her how earnestly Alabel desired the presence of her parents at her marriage, and offering them an apartment at the villa for the occasion. She also ex tended her invitation to two of Alabel's younger sisters, on the plea that their services would be required as bridesmaids. A few days elapsed before an answer arrived, pro bably spent in conjugal negotiations ; but at length a letter came from Lady- George, most thankfully accepting Lady Tenby's offer for herself and daughters. Lord George, she regretted to say, had lately had some pre monitory7 symptoms of a fit of the gout, which made it imprudent for him to think of leaving home. Lady- Tenby- was not discouraged. She was determined Lord George should come, and she struck her great blow. She wrote to the Duke of Lowestoft, with whom she was well acquainted, and begged him to use his influence with his uncle. The duke, who was the most good-natured of men, complied, and,"], [59, "ON THE BRINK. 51 in consequence, a week before the wedding Alabel was made happy by the arrival of her father at Ealing. Having thus broken the ice, he at once took his daughter and her lover into favour, and promised to pay them the interest of her little fortune till his death should put them in possession of the capital. The wedding took place with great eclat, immediately after which the whole party separated, and Lady Tenby, having provided so satisfactorily for the happiness of others, was once more left to a contemplation of the fatality- which had marred her own lot in life, and which ere long was to make still greater trial of her fortitude and powers of endurance."], [60, "ON THE BRINK. 52 CHAPTER III. Perhaps the reader will remember that in the course of Airs. Thorpe's narrative of the various events which had marked Lady7 Tenby7 's girl hood and early- married life, she had mentioned, in very- disparaging terms, a certain Mr. Alarshall, as Lord Tenby's inseparable com panion and bosom friend, to whom she had imputed much of that noble lord's laxity of morals, and whom she had denounced, not unjustly perhaps, as his evil genius. It is true, Mr. Marshall's family professed to lament his intimacy with Lord Tenby in equally strong language, and probably with equal justice, attributing the excesses and indiscretions bv"], [61, "ON THE BRINK. 53 which their kinsman's early- career had been marked to the vicious precepts and bad example of his companion. There was, of course, much to be said on both sides ; but there could be no doubt that Marshall's spirit was the most determined, his mind the strongest of the two, and that he soon acquired an undisputed ascendancy7 over the more vacillating disposition of his friend. In real ability, he was as inferior to Lord Tenby as he was in polish of manner; but he was active and energetic, Lord Tenby indolent and averse to any intellectual exertion, conse quently disposed to submit to the guidance of one who would take the trouble of thinking off his hands. Still the task of managing him properly was one of considerable delicacy-, for he had moments of independence which called forth all Alarshall's tact and discretion. In these qualities, however, he was by no means deficient, and as he never attempted to draw the reins too tight, these temporary fits of rebellion generally ended by strengthening his authority."], [62, "ON THE BRINK 54 Their intimacy began at Eton, where Marshall, who was a couple of y7ears older thau Lord Tenby, then the Honourable Henry- Mortimer, at once took the young boy under his protection. His father, a distant connection of the Tenbys, was employed in a public office, and in the enjoy-ment of a good salary, but he had never thought it necessary to make any further provision for his son than to give him a good education and the opportunity of making useful friends. At a very early7 age it was impressed upon him that for his success in life he had no one to look to but himself, and the seed fell upon good soil ; but till young Mortimer's appearance on the scene, he had found no opportunity of carrying the precept into practice. Somehow, he was not popular with boys of his own age, but his superior strength and knowledge of school life enabled him to confer daily obligations on his new protege. They migrated in due time to Oxford together, where Alarshall played his cards so well, that in a short time he was, not only the"], [63, "OA' THE BBINK. 55 intimate friend, but the confidential adviser of his late schoolfellow. The same tastes and a general similarity- of disposition cemented a union in which both found their interest. By the death of his elder brother, Mr. Alortimer became Earl of Tenby, and Marshall, whose father was now dead, and who had his way to make in the world unaided, thought he could take no better course for attaining that object than by7 attaching himself closely to the fortunes of his friend. He took upon himself, under the modest title of secretary, the direction of all Lord Tenby's affairs, at the same time enacting the part of privy7 councillor in all those delicate transactions in which, from time to time, his patron found himself involved. It cannot be said that his ad ministration was particularly7 successful, in financial matters at all events ; for under his auspices, aided by Lord Tenby's reckless extravagance, the embarrassments of the firm increased daily, till at length it was clear that without some stroke of good fortune a crash"], [64, "ON THE BRINK. 56 was inevitable. Then it was that Mr. Marshall suggested a marriage with Mr. Halsted's heiress as the readiest means for extricating themselves from their dilemma, for he had long looked upon himself as Lord Tenby's partner, and with him he must sink or swim. The plot succeeded. Eleanor Halsted became Countess of Tenby, but with that event Marshall, much to his disgust, found his occupation gone. Mr. Halsted firmly7 refused to allow him to have anything further to do with the Tenby property, which that gentle man, as we have seen, took under his own care, and managed by means of agents ap pointed by himself. Nor was Mr. Marshall more fortunate in cultivating the good graces of Lady Tenby7. He began by treating her with a familiarity to which she was not disposed to submit, and when he assumed the merit of having raised her to her present position, and laid claim to her unbounded gratitude in consequence, in terms more than usually arrogant, she at once desired him to"], [65, "ON THE BRINK. 57 leave the house, and never more venture to address her. This w7as in the early7 day7s of her married life, and she lost no time in informing her husband of what had passed. Lord Tenby was not disposed to take up the cudgels on behalf of his friend. In fact, he was not sorry for so decent an excuse for getting rid of him altogether. As long as he was a bachelor he submitted to the govern ment of one who was fertile in expedients, who never raised any difficulties, or was troubled with unnecessary scruples, and whose services, from long habit, had become almost indis pensable ; but he was quite aware that he paid a very heavy price for the accommodation. The secretary had no fixed salary7, but helped himself as occasion required, and the occasions were frequent. He certainly could not be said to rob his employer, for there was no mystery7 in his proceedings. Every shilling Marshall drew for himself was entered in his accounts, which he was careful to have regularly audited ; nor were any remonstrances"], [66, "58 ON THE BRINK. or objections ever offered to this system. Lord Tenby, by his silence at least, acquiesced in the arrangement. The case was now altered. Provision was made for paying off all incumbrances on the noble bridegroom's estates, who, in the mean time, was placed in possession of a large income, but not large enough to be divided with another man whose expenses were almost as great as his own. Lord Tenby found less difficulty than he had anticipated in inducing his friend to listen to reason. He told him that from some un accountable caprice Lady Tenby had taken an invincible aversion to him, and declared, that if ever he set foot in her house again, she would w-alk out of it. He represented that, for the present at least, it was necessary to humour her, if they were not to forfeit all the advan tages they had anticipated from the marriage. That it was for the interest of both that they should part for a time, but that whatever career Marshall should adopt, he would further his views to the utmost of his power, and that"], [67, "ON THE BRINK. 59 neither money nor interest should be wanting to insure him success ; with much more to the same effect. Mr. Alarshall was a man of strong and vigorous intellect, more especially7 where his own interests were concerned, and he was easily- convinced that Lord Tenby's view of the case was a sound one. Perhaps, too, he was tired of dependence, though it was such but in name, and wished to create a position for himself. In short, the terms on which the separation was to be effected were soon the only subject left for discussion. Mr. Marshall naturally- set a very high value on the services he had rendered his patron, while the patron, as naturally, seemed to think the advantage he had derived from those services considerably overrated. However, after some wrangling, Marshall prevailed. He received a very large sum of money down, which Lord Tenby raised as he best could, and which was to be doubled at Mr. Halsted's death, and with this he departed to push his fortunes in the far East,"], [68, "60 ON THE BRINK. where he had heard of an opening likely to suit him. Five years elapsed before he again made his appearance in England. His return, which took place shortly after Lord Tenby's separation from his wife, was anything but an agreeable surprise to the noble lord. After the first two or three letters, no communication had taken place between them since Marshall's departure ; and if ever Lord Tenby did think of his absent friend, it was to hope that he would never see or hear of him again. It was on a wet and gloomy- afternoon that Lord Tenby7, on returning home in no very placid mood from an unsatisfactory- visit to his mother, was informed by- his servant that a gentleman, who had declined giving his name, was waiting for him in his sitting room. He went upstairs, determined to make very short work with the intruder, whoever he might be, who had chosen so unseasonable a time for an interview. His resolution was a little shaken when he heard a voice he well remembered"], [69, "ON THE BRINK. 61 exclaim, \" At last, old fellow ! I was almost tired of waiting for you.\" \" You here, Alarshall !\" said his lordship, in a tone indicative of anything but pleasure at the meeting thus forced upon him, and but just touching the hand held out to him. \"What the devil has brought y-ou back to England ?\" After so long an absence, Alarshall no doubt might have expected a more cordial greeting from an old friend, but he was not fastidious, and contented himself with a literal answer to the question addressed to him. \" Because the devil would have it so,\" he said. \" I have not found India answer, and am come to see if I cannot do better here, where I have friends, or at least one friend, able and willing to assist me. I fact, I am ruined, and had very little more than enough to pay my passage home.\" \" What !\" exclaimed Lord Tenby. ' ' Lost all your money, when the last I heard of you was that you were making a colossal fortune !\" \" Even so. The colossal fortune has vanished, swallowed up in the most magnificent railway"], [70, "ON THE BRINK. 62 speculation that mind of man ever conceived, but which came to a dead lock just when I was on the point of drawing my chesnuts out of the fire, by realizing my shares. And to whom do you think I owe my ruin ?\" \" How on earth should I know ?\" said Lord Tenby, who anticipated what was coming, and was busily employed in calculating what was the smallest possible sum for which he could hope to escape. \" Your precious father-in-law, old Halsted,\" rejoined Mr. Marshall. \" He was largely in terested in it, and persuaded the London directors to send out an agent to examine into our proceedings, and report upon them. But I need not go into details. The long and the short of it is that the concern was wound up, and every shilling invested in it irre coverably lost. My only comfort is that Halsted must have been hit pretty hard him self. He is too rich however to feel it, but as I do not happen to be so fortunately situated, it is but fair that what he has been the means"], [71, "ON THE BBINK. 63 of my losing should be made good by his son-in-law. I am sure you must see it in the same light.\" \" Well, not exactly. Nor will you either, I suspect, when I tell you that I have signed a deed of separation from Lady Tenby.\" \" The devil, you have !\" exclaimed Marshall, evidently disconcerted by this piece of in telligence. \" So it has come to that at last. But at least you have taken care of your own interests.\" \" My interests ! Mr. Halsted threatened legal proceedings, and I was glad to accept any terms that were offered me.\" \" And those terms were ?\" asked Marshall, pertinaciously adhering to the main point. But Lord Tenby was not inclined to satisfy his curiosity. He hummed and hawed, and said it was such a complicated arrangement that he could not at that moment call to mind all the particulars. He had not yet had the courage to ask his lawyer for a copy of the deed. When he did, Marshall should see it."], [72, "64 ON THE BRINK. With this that gentleman was obliged to be satisfied. The two allies dined together at Lord Tenby 's, and in the course of the evening Mr. Marshall obtained a full and particular account of all that had occurred in the Tenby family since his departure. Lord Tenby had no occasion to fear any austere reproofs from his guest, and discarded all reserve. It was only on the subject of the arrangement which he had just concluded that he was impenetrable, although his companion brought back the con versation to it more than once. \" From all which,\" said Marshall, when the tale was completed, \" I gather that you have made a thorough fool of yourself. Halsted no doubt was delighted to save the allowance he made you, and Lady Tenby to get rid of you. Between ourselves, I do not believe she ever cared a straw for you. She caught at the position which your rank and connections gave her, and now, finding that she can fly alone, she takes advantage of so favourable an oppor tunity for casting you off.\""], [73, "ON THE BRINK. 65 \" Of course she is sure of your good word.

I most humbly beg your lordship's pardon, and beg to assure you of my profound respect for your lordship and your lordship's wife.\" It is impossible to describe the sneering insolence of tone and manner with which these words were spoken. The blood rushed to Lord Tenby 's face, and he half rose from his VOL. III. F"], [74, "66 ON THE BRINK. chair, as if determined to inflict personal chastisement on the offender. But other thoughts prevailed and he resumed his seat, endeavouring, though not very successfully, to assume an appearance of indifference. \" Well, never mind Lady Tenby now,\" he said. \" I presume it is not on her account that you have sought me out, but to talk over your own plans. What do you intend doing ?\" Marshall was satisfied with the advantage he had gained. The first words which Lord Tenby had uttered on seeing him had convinced him that, whatever feelings of friendship that noble individual might have once entertained for him, were now completely effaced. The only course left for him was. to endeavour to regain his old position by a coup de main, and he flattered himself that he had succeeded, at least to a certain extent. Under this impres sion he smoothed his ruffled plumes, and at once proceeded to business. \"As you say, Lady Tenby can have nothing to do with our discussions, more especially as your partner-"], [75, "ON THE BRINK. 67 ship is now dissolved. With regard to my plans, I intend to regain in England the money I have lost in India. I have acquired a thorough knowledge of business, and have no doubt of turning it to good account.

The only available resource I have is your bond for ten thousand pounds, payable at old Halsted's death, and which, in case of your dying first, is but so much waste paper.

When do you think I can see your deed of separation ?\" Marshall was evidently bent upon re assuming the office of Lord Tenby 's con fidential adviser, and his lordship was deter mined that he should not ; though how the attempt was to be resisted, without giving offence, he did not exactly see, and offence he could not afford to give. There were various considerations which rendered it inexpedient for him to make an enemy of his ex-secretary, though had he been at liberty to declare war"], [78, "70 ON THE BRINK. he would have done so on the spot, then and there, for he felt his irritation increasing every minute. He was conscious, moreover, that Marshall was perfectly aware of the state of his feelings, and he regretted, now that it was too late, that he had not met his old friend with a greater show of cordiality. Perhaps then a little cajolery might have been used with effect, now probably it would be thrown away ; but at all events there could be no harm in trying what a more friendly tone would do. \" Yes,\" he said, \" I know of old that you are a capital hand at getting a fellow out of a scrape, and if you can see any way of managing it, I need not say that I shall be delighted to be of service to you. But as for raising ten thou sand pounds it is quite out of the question, as you will see yourself.\" \"And about this deed of separation,\" persisted Mr. Marshall. \" When can I be favoured with a sight of it, for upon that our operations must in a great measure depend.\" \" Ah, true, the deed of separation. I will"], [79, "ON THE BRINK. 71 see about it to-morrow, or rather the day after, for to-morrow I shall be engaged all day.\" \"To-morrow I also must go into the country but I shall return on the following day, so pray lose no time about it.\" \" What on earth can take you into the country so soon ?\" Lord Tenby inquired, more for something to say than for any interest he took in the question. \" I am going to see my poor sister. You have not forgotten her, have you ?\" \" Your sister ! Oh no, certainly not. During your absence I have received regularly every three months a report of her health, and I conclude the duplicates have been forwarded to you.\" \" All but the last, which must have crossed me on my way home. How was she when you last heard ?\" \"Still in the same state as regards her mind ; hopelessly insane. But Dr. Wells thinks her bodily health is beginning to give way.\""], [80, "ON THE BRINK. 72 \" Poor Mary ! When she does go it will be a release to herself and everybody con nected with her. However, I must be off now, for it is late. To day is Tuesday. I shall see you on Friday, and hope to find you prepared with the deed. Good night.\" Lord Tenby was now left to his meditations, which must have borne some analogy to those of Sinbad the sailor when he found the Old Man of the Sea firmly seated on his shoulders. For something like five years he had enjoyed and learnt to appreciate the pleasures of independence, and he shuddered at the thought of again falling under the power of a mayor of the palace, whose sway, however mild in the commencement, had by degrees slid into pure and unmitigated despotism. Moreover, like most spendthrifts when smitten with a passion for ecouomy, his lordship had become exceedingly close, not to say stingy, in his expenditure, and he knew by experience that he was not likely to effect much in the way of saving and retrenchment under the auspices"], [81, "ON THE BBINK. 73 of his quondam friend. Long he revolved all these considerations in his mind, and at length he determined, though not without some misgiving as to the prudence of the measure he contemplated, to signify openly and boldly that, while he was ready to assist Mr. Marshall to a moderate extent, he could admit of no interference in the management of his own affairs. He did not conceal from himself, that with a man of Marshall's stamp this was rather a dangerous experiment. That gentleman was acquainted with . all the particulars of his early life, and amongst them were some which he would fain have buried in oblivion; but then, on the other hand, it was obvious that this dangerous confidant was completely dependent upon him for the means of making a fresh start in life, if not for those of existence itself. It was not likely that one so situated would risk an open breach with the only person able and willing to befriend him. But, be that as it might, Lord Tenby resolved to dare the worst effects of"], [82, "74 ON THE BBINK. his wrath, rather than' submit again to his dic tatorship. Nothing could be worse than that ! Mr. Marshall lost no time, on his return to London, in calling on Lord Tenby, whom to his great relief he found at home, for he had half expected to hear that the bird had flown. In this he was guilty of great injustice. Lord Tenby had plenty of pluck, and having made up his mind as to the course to be pursued, was only anxious to have the explanation over as soon as possible. His first question naturally had reference to Marshall's journey, and the object of it. \" How did you find your sister ?\" he said. \"Precisely in the same state, recognizing no one, and apparently taking interest in nothing. Wells says that her fits of violence are more frequent, and she is longer in recovering from the effects of them ; altogether he thinks her gradually getting weaker, though she may last for years.\" \" Poor thing !\" said Lord Tenby. \" I hope she is well taken care of, and has every comfort"], [83, "ON THE BRINK. 75 about her. The payments to Dr. Wells have been made to a day.\" \" In that respect there is nothing to complain of. She has her two rooms and an attendant to herself. And now about this money. Have you got a copy of your deed of separation yet ?\" \" No ; I have not even asked for it. It is quite out of my power to assist you to the extent you require. I am already so ham pered that I do not know which way to turn, and I will not add to my embarrassments. What I propose \" \" Unless you propose to pay me down ten thousand pounds,\" said Marshall, interrupting him, \"it is needless to propose anything else. That sum I must have, and, my lord, I will have it.\" \" I think, Mr. Marshall,\" rejoined Lord Tenby, \" you would do well to hear me out. I propose paying you four hundred a year, the interest of the money at four per cent., till Mr. Halsted's death, or till, through my"], [84, "76 ON THE BRINK. influence, you procure a government appoint ment with a salary of double that amount. Those are the terms I have to offer, and more than that I cannot do.\" \"And I decline accepting them. Four hundred a year may be a very proper allow ance for a cast-off mistress or a natural son, but I am something more. Four hundred a year is of no use to me, and as for a govern ment appointment, I would not accept it. What I want is a sum of money dowrn. You can procure it for me if you please, and if you will take the trouble to reflect, you will acknowledge that I have a right to expect your assistance.\" But though this last phrase was pronounced in the most impressive manner, it failed apparently in producing any effect on Lord Tenby, who contented himself with repeating, \" I have told you my terms, and beyond them I cannot go.\" \" Say you will not, my lord,\" said Marshall, angrily."], [85, "ON THE BRINK. 77 \" And beyond them I will not go,\" rejoined his lordship, obediently. \"Lord Tenby, it appears to me you quite forget our relative positions.\" \"I forget nothing, Mr. Marshall. I re member that, when we closed our accounts before you went to India, I gave you ten thousand pounds in bank notes, and a bond for a similar amount payable at Mr. Halsted's death, and with this you expressed yourself perfectly satisfied, as a settlement in full of all demands. If this has escaped your recollection, I can show you your own letter, in which it is set forth in black and white. I regret that your speculations have failed, and that you have lost your money, but that is no fault of mine. For the sake of old friendship, although you have no further claim on me, I offer you an annuity of four hundred a year, which you treat with dis dain, although in my altered circumstances it is more than I can conveniently spare. Take it or not, as you please, but, as I"], [86, "ON THE BRINK. 78 have already said, I neither can, nor will do more.\" \"With your permission, my lord, we will leave all allusion to friendship, past or present, out of the question. This is purely a matter of business. You know, as well as I do, that your only motive for offering me four hundred a year is to secure my silence, and in my opinion it is insufficient. I shall now take my leave, and give you eight and forty hours to reconsider your decision. If, at the expiration of that time, I hear nothing further from you, I shall consider myself at liberty to take any steps which I may deem most conducive to my own interests. Whatever effect they may have upon your lordship, after this warning I wash my hands of the consequences.\" He took up his hat, but paused a minute to see if Lord Tenby showed any signs of repen tance. None appeared ; his lordship was in an obstinate fit, and remained mute. It was useless to prolong the interview. Mr. Marshall moved to the door. \"I have the honour of"], [87, "ON THE BBINK. 79 wishing your lordship good morning,\" he said, casting one longing, lingering look behind ; but as he saw Lord Tenby in the act of ringing the bell for the servant to let him out, he took his departure without any further observation."], [88, "ON THE BRINK. 80 CHAPTER IV. The eight and forty hours elapsed. Lord Tenby had made no sign, and Mr. Marshall w7as a good deal embarrassed as to what his next move should be. It was perfectly true that there was one particular transaction in wdiich Lord Tenby had taken the prominent part, the revelation of which would no doubt be amply rewarded by the injured party ; but then his own share in the business had been such, that he would necessarily appear in even darker colours than his principal. It would stamp them both with infamy, but in Lord Tenby 's case the partiality of friends might perchance discover some extenuating circumstance, which would be totally wanting in his own. Besides, he knew quite enough of the world to be aware"], [89, "ON THE BBINK. 81 that equality before the laws of the land, if indeed it exists at all, does not extend to the laws of society. By the aid of his rank and connections, Lord Tenby might contrive to float his bark again ; but his own, once wrecked, would remain a wreck for ever. To him even wealth would be valueless, if con demned to live in obscurity, shunned by his fellow-men ; for, though not insensible to the enjoyments which money can give, he valued it still more for the power it confers, and the consideration with which it is attended. He was ambitious, but in him ambition was an ignoble passion. He would rather have been the first man on 'change than the most success ful statesman or general of the day. With his usual activity, he had already opened a new career for himself. As soon as he landed in England, he sought out one or two men of the highest commercial in fluence, with whom his Indian transactions had brought him into connection, and they at once offered to further his views to the utmost of a VOL. IIT."], [90, "82 ON THE BBINK. their power. That he had been unfortunate they knew, but his integrity was unimpeached, while his energy and knowledge of business were universally acknowledged. By their means he obtained a seat at two different boards of direction for most promising specula tions, and he already saw the road to fortune open to him. To take any step which might have the effect of blighting these brilliant prospects was out of the question, but to follow them up efficiently, money was absolutely necessary. At present it was clear that he had not much to hope for from Lord Tenby, but he began to think that four hundred a year was better than nothing, and he regretted that he had been so precipitate in his rejection of it. And as, for the present at least, he felt that he could take no active steps to that noble lord's detriment, he thought it would be more to his advantage to be on good terms with him than in a state of hostility. His former in fluence was gone, and after all it was natural enough that it should not have survived an"], [91, "OS THE BRINK. 83 absence of five years ; but by judicious manage ment it might be revived, and he might once more exercise the desirable post of confidential adviser. At all events, he determined to make the attempt, though no doubt it cost him much to make an act of submission to one whom he had once looked upon as a mere tool, and whom he still considered as an animal of an inferior order. On the other hand, Lord Tenby, though firmly resolved not to yield a jot, was not altogether free from apprehension of the results of his interview with his late ally. He could not, however, bring himself to believe that they would be very dangerous, knowing how seriously Marshall himself would be affected by any untoward disclosure ; and if the worst came to the worst, he saw a germ of consolation in an idea which presented itself to his imagination. Altogether he was pleased with himself and the firmness he had exhibited, and great was his triumph when, after the lapse of three or four days, he received a letter from"], [92, "84 ON THE BRINK. Mr. Marshall, in which that gentleman ex pressed his regret for the seeming misunder standing which had arisen between them. \"I take all the blame of it upon myself,\" he said, \"for upon reflection I feel convinced that, in the offer you made, you went to the extent of your ability, and I am free to confess that it was more than I had any right to expect. As some excuse for my warmth of temper, I may plead that I had heard of an opening which seemed to promise well, but which required a large sum of money to start with. This, of course, I am now obliged to decline, and must be content to build up mj shattered fortunes again, as I best may, inch by inch. As a preliminary step, I accept with gratitude the annuity you had the kindness to offer me, and shall feel greatly obliged by your informing me how and when I can receive it. \"Believe me to be, \" With unabated friendship, \" Very sincerely yours, \" Thos. Marshall.\""], [93, "ON THE BRINK. 85 Lord Tenby was justly proud of this, the first victory he had ever obtained over his coadjutor. For a moment he was tempted to follow it up by declaring that the time for reconciliation was passed, and that Mr. Marshall must no longer reckon on the annuity which he had so contemptuously rejected -, but he 3'ielded to the voice of prudence, and answered Marshall's letter in sufficiently cordial terms, inviting him to come and settle the details of their little affair in person. Unfortunately, there was a vein of supercilious pleasantry and condescension running through the whole epistle, which was something new, and anything but pleasing to the object of it. The first phrase, \" Well, old fellow, I am glad you are come to your senses at last,\" struck him as particularly offensive, and he muttered to himself as he folded up the document, \" And I will see if I cannot bring you to your senses before I have done with you.\" They met, however, as old friends. The late breeze had purged the air of its noxious"], [94, "ON THE BBINK. 86 vapours, and they were soon conversing, as of old, on various topics, with the utmost seeming openness and unreserve. But for all that, they both felt that the time for confidence between them had passed away for ever, and the words which fell so glibly from their lips wTere carefully weighed and considered, lest they should contain any admission of which the adversary might take advantage. On the whole, however, Lord Tenby main tained his superiority. Mr. Marshall felt humiliated and disgraced by the defeat he had sustained from a man whom he despised, and against whom a bitter feeling of hatred had sprung up in his heart, coupled with a desire for revenge, which the fresh obligation just conferred upon him only served to increase. It is true, he was pretty well able to divine the motives by which Lord Tenby was actuated, and they were not such as to call for any extravagant demonstrations of gratitude, par ticularly as he had just made another request, which met with a refusal. He asked Lord"], [95, "ON THE BRINK. 87 Tenby to charge the annuity upon his estates, probably with a view to raising money on it, and this Lord Tenby declined. He said it was exactly what he wished to avoid, as it could not be done without coming to the knowledge of his trustees, who would naturally view such a transaction with great suspicion. Mr. Marshall might depend upon receiving his money regularly, but he must be content with the donor's word of honour; and with this Mr. Marshall was obliged to express himself satisfied, though it rankled in his mind as a fresh grievance. This, however, did not prevent his accepting Lord Tenby 's offer to pay him the year's annuity in advance. It was really a movement of good nature which prompted his lordship's liberality on this occasion, but Marshall's only feeling was that, after all, Lord Tenby could not be as hard up as he pretended to be. Another item to be added to his catalogue of wrongs. When all these knotty points were arranged, Marshall said, \" And now tell me all about"], [96, "ON THE BRINK. 88 your separation from Lady Tenby. Do you consider it final, or have you any hopes of a re conciliation ? In your position, I should leave no stone unturned to bring it about if possible.\" \"Nor do I, but as yet unsuccessfully. I suppose I must allow time for her anger to evaporate. Between ourselves, it is a most infernal business, involving the loss of the only woman I ever truly loved, loss of income, loss of consideration.\" \" Loss of consideration ! I never expected to hear your lordship dwell upon that. I think I have heard you express great contempt for the opinion of the world, and your actions have certainly not belied your words.\" \" Perhaps, but those are things of the past. At all events, I wish to stand well with the world now. I have done with all my youth ful follies, and mean to devote the rest of my life to politics. But to succeed in these days as a public man it is necessary to maintain an appearance of respectability. As far as position aud connection go, I have every right to look"], [97, "ON THE BRINK. 89 forward to office. I have an uncle, my mother's brother, in the cabinet, who is very well dis posed towards me ; but even he, though God knows not much of a saint, told me that it was impossible to do anything for me as long as I was separated from a woman so universally respected as Lady Tenby, or at least till the scandal of it had blown over.\" \"And in the mean time,\" said Marshall, \" you sit down quietly with your hands crossed, waiting upon Providence.\" \" Not at all. I have made several attempts to enter into communication with my wife, but, as I said, in vain. Her father's influence no doubt is used to the utmost against me. But I am far from despairing of success in the long run. There is a man in whom I have the greatest confidence, and who, I am convinced, will do his best to serve Lady Tenby and myself in this matter, when he thinks the proper time has arrived. He is an intimate friend of Mr. Halsted and Eleanor, and naturally, when the eclat took place, sided with"], [98, "90 ON THE BRINK. them ; but he did it like a gentleman, express ing his regret at being obliged to act as he did. I have the most perfect confidence in Colonel Compton.\" \" Compton ! Colonel Compton, did you say?\" exclaimed Marshall. \"What Colonel Compton ?\" \" Oh, you must have heard of him in India. Colonel Arthur Compton, in the Company's service.\" \" Heard of him ! I should think I had, damn him ! He was the first person who struck a blow at our credit. He had invested some money in our shares, but took fright, and, backed by a Mr. Collins, an engineer, actually bullied the directors into buying them back of him. I only wish I had been at the board that day; he would not have succeeded so easily. So Colonel Compton is a friend of Mr. Halsted's ?\" \" An intimate one. He knew Eleanor in her childhood.\" \"Ah, I see it all now,\" rejoined Mr."], [99, "ON THE BRINK. 91 Marshall. \"I never could understand what raised old Halsted's suspicions. Of course he talked the business over with Compton, and Compton gave him his version of it. I am glad to know at last to whom I am indebted for my ruin, and if ever the chance is given me I will endeavour to repay the obligation with interest.\" \"Nonsense, Marshall. I dare say, if the colonel thought the speculation a bad one, he told his friends so, as anybody else would have done ; but as for your ruin, it seems to me, even by your own account, that you have nobody to thank for it but yourself. You intended to make your fortune at the expense of the shareholders, and as they objected, your plan fell to the ground. I cannot say I regret it, for bad as my position is, it would have been worse with a bankrupt father-in-law. And of one thing I am certain ; whatever version my friend Compton may have given, it was the true one. He is one of the most honourable men I know.\""], [100, "ON THE BRINK. 92 \" As to his being one of the most honourable men you know,\" replied Mr. Marshall, \" all I can say is that you are not very complimentary to the rest of your acquaintance. At all events, even your lordship's testimony in his favour will not alter my opinion of him. The manner in which Colonel Compton contrived to get out of his liabilities is hardly reconcilable with the honourable character with which you have been pleased to invest him ; and I have no doubt that, to exonerate himself in Halsted's eyes, he painted the affairs of the company in the blackest possible light. He may have the honour of being your friend, but he has proved himself to be a bitter enemy to me, and I grieve to say I have not Christian charity enough to forgive him, till I have squared accounts with him, even for your sake.\" At this ebullition Lord Tenby only laughed, notwithstanding the offensive tone in which it was uttered. He thoroughly enjoyed Marshall's discomfiture, and his own good humour seemed to increase in the exact ratio of his companion's"], [101, "ON THE BRINK. 93 irritation. \"My friend is very well able to take care of himself,\" he said, \" or I might think it right to warn him of your amiable intentions. But the one thing I have never been able to comprehend is, how you have con trived to live through so many years without ever having been called to an account for your impertinence.\" \" I have no doubt many would have liked to do so, my lord, but as yet none have dared. I do not imagine your lordship wishes to set them the example.\" \" What !\" said Lord Tenby, with the blandest of smiles. \" Expose you to the chance of being shot yourself, or of shooting your annuity! No indeed, it would be hardly fair to place you on the horns of such a dilemma.\" \" No dilemma for me, I promise you,\" exclaimed Marshall vehemently ; \" for rest assured that, if ever an occasion demands it, I shall not hesitate for a moment.\" Then calming down in a moment, apparently with out an effort, he continued, \" But this is all"], [102, "94 ON THE BRINK. idle talk. We understand each other too well, and have too many interests in common, for any serious cause of dissension to arise between us. As for Colonel Compton, it is natural we should not view him with the same eyes. He has done me irreparable injury, and I say so to you, as I would to him; you, on the other hand, expect to profit by his good offices with Lady Tenby, and uphold him. All fair, and I have nothing to say against it. Only concede to me the same liberty of speech that you assume for yourself.\" \"There is no necessity that I cau see for his name ever being again mentioned between us,\" said Lord Tenby with a yawn ; for now7 that Marshall had adopted a more pacific tone, his interest in the conversation was greatly diminished. \" Well then,\" said that gentleman, \" I think we have nothing further to discuss, and I will take my departure. Lever o I'incommodo, as we used to say at Florence.\" Lord Tenby made no opposition, but"], [103, "ON THE BRINK. 95 languidly shook his friend's hand. In all pro bability he thought the Italian phrase very applicable. Mr. Marshall after this interview did not seek to force his society upon Lord Tenby. He saw clearly that, for the present at least, he had no chance of obtaining more than he had already done, and Lord Tenby 's manner had not been such as to encourage a renewal of his visits without sufficient cause. In addition to this, being an active-minded man, he was soon involved in schemes and projects for his own advancement which fully occupied his time. Nor did he lose sight of the inten tion he had expressed of bringing Colonel Compton to the stool of repentance, for his share in exposing the Great West of Asia swindle. In one respect Marshall was a man after Dr. Johnson's heart\u2014 he was a good hater. He hated Compton, he hated Mr. Halsted and Eleanor, and could he but con trive to wreak his revenge upon all three, it would be a great ingredient in his cup of"], [104, "96 ON THE BRINK. happiness Lord Tenby at the present moment did not stand much higher in his favour, but he did not despair of again laying his lordship, sooner or later, under heavy con tribution, and till that was accomplished it would be the height of folly to break with him entirely. The sweetest of all revenge is that which transfers your adversary's wealth to your own pocket. At first Marshall's plans for demolishing his enemies were extremely vague. One of his first steps was to make himself acquainted, as far as he could, with all the particulars of Compton's daily life, and he soon learnt that Lord Tenby had in nothing exaggerated the intimacy of the colonel's intercourse writh Mr. Halsted and Nelly. It was a promising opening. He had no great faith in the virtue of either man or woman, and he determined to spare no pains in ascertaining the real nature of the relations existing between Lady Tenby and her friend. Could he include them both in one act of accusation, it would indeed be a"], [105, "ON THE BBINK. 97 triumph, the consequences of which would recoil upon Mr. Halsted himself. Not having much leisure himself, he was obliged to call in the aid of an assistant, but though he was well served, the information he obtained amounted to little or nothing. It was just before Compton 's departure for Egypt, when that gallant gentleman still retained sufficient control over himself to avoid anything that could throw the slightest shadow of suspicion over his visits at the villa. They were frequent, no doubt, but never made at an undue hour, or when he was likely to find Lady Tenby alone. When there, he was on the footing of a friend of the family, and nothing more. All this was conveyed in due course to our friend Marshall, who thought it anything but satisfactory. He did not doubt his agent's zeal or intelligence, but nevertheless he felt convinced that there must be more behind the curtain than he had been able to penetrate. The worst of it was that the prosecution of VOL. III. H"], [106, "98 OA THE BRINK. these inquiries was expensive, and cut deep into his slender resources, and as he was determined not to give them up, he thought it but fair that the friend who was most in terested in them should bear the expense. At all events, if he could but shake Lord Tenby 's confidence in Compton, it would be something gained. The fewer friends his lordship retained, the more likely he would be to fall into the dependence of the one who remained faithful to him. He had not called on Lord Tenby for some time, but now sought him out at once. He found his lordship apparently on the point of going out. I am afraid I have come at an unlucky time,\" he said, \" but it is so long since I sawr you, that as I was passing by, I thought I would run up to see how you are.\" \" All right,\" his lordship replied. \" I am in no particular hurry, so sit down and tell me what you have been about, and how you are getting on.\" \" Oh, pretty well. I am on the direction of"], [107, "ON THE BRINK. 99 two boards. And, by the bye, if that sort of thing suits you, I think I can answer for your being made chairman of the Sprat Fishery Company. It is always advantageous to have a man with a handle to his name at the head of a board.\" \" To catch flats with, eh ? No, thank you.\" After this the conversation for some time took a desultory turn, till Mr. Marshall asked what progress his lordship was making with Lady Tenby, adding that he heard Colonel Compton passed a great deal of his time at the villa. \" Yes, he does, I am happy to say,\" replied Lord Tenby. \" I fancy he dines there when ever he is not otherwise engaged. I mean before very long to ascertain from him the state of Eleanor's feelings towards me.\" \" Well,\" said Marshall, \" you are more of a philosopher than I gave you credit for. I know I should not like such a good-looking man to be pinned to the apron-string of any woman I took an interest in. Of course if he"], [108, "ON THE BRINK. 100 is inclined to make love to her he has plenty of opportunities.\" \" Once for all, Compton is not the man to make love to Eleanor, and if he were, she is not the woman to allow it. Their intimacy has not only my perfect approval, but that of my mother, my brother-in-law, and, in short, of all my friends. I have already explained to you how important it is for me to be reconciled to Lady Tenby; and my mother, wrho sees her frequently, and from whom Eleanor has no secrets, saj^s that she is con vinced my best chance lies in Compton's influence, although she is always preaching patience.\" In short, Mr. Marshall soon saw that, till he had something more than mere surmises to bring forward, he had no chance of shaking- Lord Tenby 's confidence in his wife, or at all events of rousing him to take any active steps. Indeed, it occurred to him that very possibly, with facts staring him in the face, Lord Tenby would refuse to be convinced. It was evident"], [109, "ON THE BBINK. 101 that the great motive of his desire for being on good terms with his wife was to further his own success in political life, and perhaps he would not be unwilling to connive at offences which should place Lady Tenby so far in his power as to compel her to submit to a nominal reconciliation. All his fine-sounding phrases might, after all, be only intended to conceal an artfully-constructed trap. This was quite in accordance with Marshall's ideas of policy, and he determined to refrain from all interference for the present, unless appealed to, and to let matters take their course. But, like most men who indulge in far fetched conjectures, Marshall was wrong. The explanation of Lord Tenby's conduct was simple enough. He was by no means inclined to jealousy, and least of all as regarded his wife. Notwithstanding the worse than neglect with whieh he had treated her ever since their marriage, he could not refuse his tribute of respect to the high principles and unsullied conduct which had won for her the esteem of"], [110, "102 ON THE BRINK. all who knew her. Strange as it may seem, he was proud of her, proud of her successes in society, proud of the universal approbation bestowed upon her, and the lustre she con ferred upon his name. As regarded Compton, he had taken a liking to him, which even the part he had taken in advising the separation could not shake ; and when once Lord Tenby took a liking to any one, he invested him, as long as it lasted, with every good quality under heaven. Consequently, as far as regarded all further investigation into the proceedings at the villa, Marshall's occupation was gone. Then came Compton's departure for Egypt, and a couple of months later he was informed, on knocking at Lord Tenby's door, that his lordship had left town for the continent. In process of time Lord Tenby returned, after persuading the superior of a convent at Boulogne to take charge of the Lady Fatima, at that time about three months old. His intercourse with Mr. Marshall was renewed, though not on very"], [111, "ON THE BRINK 103 cordial terms. Still, old habits began to resume their sway, and though he carefully avoided all domestic confidences, Lord Tenby frequently discussed with his companion the line to be taken on the political questions of the day. On such subjects no man was better qualified to give advice than Mr. Marshall, for he was shrewd and sagacious enough on all occasions when he did not allow his passions to get the better of him, and Lord Tenby was not sorry to pass a few hours occasionally with a man of intelligence and education. For, though his acquaintance had been gradually dropped by most of his early friends and com panions, his natural refinement had always kept him aloof from low society, of the male sex at least. His pursuits had frequently brought him into contact with men of doubtful or disreputable character, but while making use of them, and even, which was more frequently the case, while they were makiDg use of him, he had always held them at arm's length, and never permitted the slightest"], [112, "104 ON THE BRINK. approach to familiarity. At this period, therefore, he may be said to have been without a friend, or even an associate in the world, and at times the sense of his complete isolation became very oppressive. Thus it was, that though he both disliked and distrusted Marshall, he encouraged his visits, for he found his society better than none; at all events it afforded him a respite from his own thoughts. His manner became more gracious, and his old ally flattered himself that he was fast regaining the position he had held previous to Lord Tenby's marriage. But he felt the necessity of making his advances with caution, and step by step. There was a great change in the noble lord's temper ; formerly he had seldom raised an objection to anything pro posed by his confidant ; now he was self willed and capricious, sometimes inclined to be quarrelsome, and disputing with angry vehe mence about the merest trifles. Marshall did not know what to make of it. He was warm tempered himself, and found it a difficult task"], [113, "ON THE BRINK. 105 at times to refrain from some cutting retort. On the whole, however, not being inclined to quarrel with his own bread and butter, he thought it better to meet these attacks in dig nified silence, or at most with a smile of conscious superiority. The two friends, or rather the patron and the client, were dining together at the house of the former on the evening of the day on which Compton had declined the appointment offered him by Lord Margate. Lord Tenby, who knew nothing of the rejection, expatiated in very florid terms on his own disappointment. \" In fact,\" he said, \" my only consolation was that it was already promised to my friend Compton. I could not have borne to be cut out of it by any one else.\" They had both been drinking a good deal of wine. \" If you do not take care,\" rejoined Marshall, \" he will cut you out of something else, if he has not done so already.\" \" And what may that be ?\""], [114, "106 ON THE BRINK. \" My Lady Tenby. He is at Ealing more than ever, morning, noon, and night. Riding with her, dining with her, passing the evening with her, escorting her everywhere. What more would you have ?\" \"What I would have,\" replied Lord Tenby, in great wrath, \" is that you should remember what I have already told you \u2014 that I will not tolerate the slightest disrespect to Lady Tenby. She is an angel. I am quite aware, knowing you as I do, that with your feelings towards her and Sir Arthur Compton, you will stick at nothing to injure them ; but, by G \u2014 d, if ever you do so again in my hearing, I will give you cause to repent it.\" \"Your lordship has been drinking too much wine,\" said Marshall, \" or you would scarcely have made use of such language. To prevent a repetition of it, which might lead to conse quences disagreeable to both of us, I will leave you to your own reflections.\" Months passed away before they again met, but a few days after Mabel Langiey's marriao-e"], [115, "ON THE BRINK. 107 Marshall paid Lord Tenby another visit. His lordship happened to be in high good humour. \" Ah, Marshall,\" he said, \" glad to see you ! What au age it is since you have been near me. Been abroad, eh ?\" Seeing that Lord Tenby forgot, or ignored what had passed between them at their last interview, Marshall followed the cue given him. \"No,\" he replied, \"I have had no time for that. My time is so engrossed by business that I have not a minute to myself. And now that I have come, it is with a melancholy piece of intelligence. Mary is dead at last.\" \" Good God ! you don't say so ? Poor thing! Was she restored to consciousness before she died ?\" \" They thought so for a short time ; but discovered their mistake when she began to babble about a husband and child. Strange fancy, was it not ?\""], [116, "108 ON THE BRINK. CHAPTER V. The unfortunate lady who, under the name of Mary Marshall, had lived and died in Dr. Wells's establishment for the reception of persons of infirm mind, might well allude to husband and child during the few hours of lucid recollection vouchsafed to her before her release, for she had both. She was the wife of Lord Tenby, the mother of Hugh Graham. Mary7 Graham was the daughter of a Scotch minister, and had become acquainted with Henry Mortimer when that young gentleman, in company with his friend Mr. Marshall, was making a strolling tour through the western counties of Scotland, soon after their emanci-"], [117, "ON THE BRINK. 109 pation from Oxford. How or where the intimacy first began, and how it ripened into love, matters not. Her mother had been dead some years, and when her father first received hints of stolen interviews in the glen or by the river side, her heart was no longer in her own power. Of Mr. Mortimer's real position both father and daughter were in equal ignorance. Mr. Graham probably gave the stranger credit for no very honourable intentions, but even if they tended to marriage his objections were the same. Mr. Graham was a man in whom the uncompromising harshness of Calvinism was more than usually developed. The idea of an Erastian and prelatic wolf stealing into his fold was intolerable, and he determined to cut the matter short at once. He sent for his daughter, and told her what he had heard. \" I want no explanations,\" he said, \" and I will not expose you to the temptation of telling an untruth by asking you any questions. I simply warn you that, if you are again seen speaking to that young man, I will renounce you for"], [118, "ON THE BRINK. 110 my daughter, and cast you forth, even as Abra ham cast forth Agar. You may go.\" Mary attempted no reply, but fled from the presence of tbe man she feared to the arms of the man she loved. No time was lost. The three, for Marshall still accompanied them, took their departure for the south, but Mary steadily refused to trust herself alone with her lover till they were pronounced to be man and wife. Mortimer, mad with passion, would have consented to anything, and his friend, though he shrugged his shoulders, offered no objections. As soon as they thought them selves safe from pursuit, they stopped at a small Highland inn, where the lovers were married with every formality required by the Scotch law, and a certificate duly attested was placed in the hands of Mrs. Mortimer. Soon after they all went abroad, and, after a few months' wandering, took up their abode for the winter in a villa not far from Florence. When they were fairly established, Marshall, who had seen quite enough of his friend's honeymooning, and"], [119, "ON THE BRINK. 111 was rather tired of it, left Italy for England, to raise money, and generally to watch over the interests of the firm. The accounts he sent of Lord Tenby's health were such, that Mortimer, in the course of the summer, also determined upou returning, that he might be upon the spot in case his presence was required. He took a small house at Brompton, in which Mrs. Mortimer was installed, and where, in the course of a few months, she gave birth to a son. She now hoped that her husband would perform the promise he had made her of presenting her to his family, and which he had hitherto evaded under the old plea of com plete dependence upon an overbearing brother, whose anger and indignation at his marriage with a woman who had nothing but beauty and amiable qualities to recommend her, would be extreme. His passion had somewhat abated, it is true, but she had no cause to complain of unkindness or neglect, and he fully intended sooner or later to produce her as his wife. But by Marshall's advice he still urged"], [120, "112 ON THE BRINK. the necessity of delay. \" Far better wait,\" said that able adviser, \" till you are Lord Tenby, which is now a question of weeks. The world might look a little shy upon a Mrs. Henry Mortimer of whom no one has ever heard, and who has nothing but a Scotch marriage to support her claims ; but as Countess of Tenb}', with your large fortune to back her, she will be accepted without further inquiry. Besides, now your own family might head the opposition ; as Lord Tenby, you will be able to speak en maitre.\" The advice was good, whatever the motives that dictated it, and Mary acquiesced in the reasons which her husband alleged, and which were supported by his friend, in whom she had every confidence. But soon after Hugh was weaned, and a short time before her brother in-law's death, she gave the most unmistakable signs of insanity, and even attempted to strangle her child, who had been incautiously left alone with her. Her husband immediately despatched a note for Marshall, who arrived"], [121, "ON THE BRINK. 113 without delay. When informed of what had happened, and that Mrs. Mortimer had been with the utmost difficulty prevented from throwing herself out of window, he made up his mind at once with his usual decision. \"Mortimer,\" he said, \"you must leave this entirely to me. I shall send at once for Dr. Wells, and till we have heard his opinion we can settle nothing. I think, however, for many reasons, which I have not time to explain, that you should not be present when he makes his visit. Go to my lodgings, take the boy and his nurse with you, and wait there for me.\" Mortimer was too much shocked and overset by the events of the morning to attempt any observations. He sent for a cab, and departed with nurse and child, instructing the servants to obey Marshall as they would himself; and soon after he was out of the house, Dr. Wells, who had been sent for, arrived. As soon as he saw the patient, and heard all that had occurred, he said, \" The case is too serious VOL. III. i"], [122, "114 ON THE BRINK. for me to pronounce decidedly upon it at present. I will return in the course of the afternoon, with two of my medical colleagues, for a consultation, but if their opinion coincides with mine I shall advise her being removed at once to a proper asylum. Here it is impossible for her to receive the attention she requires. May I ask her position in life ?\" \"With Dr. Wells,\" replied Marshall, \"I can have no secrets, as I am sure he will hold my confidence sacred. She is my sister, Mary Marshall, but upon the events of her past life you must permit me to be silent. I believe you have a private establishment in the country, and should it be decided that she ought to be removed, it is to your care I should wish to confide her. There will be no difficulty about the terms. All I wish is that no expense may be spared that may tend to her comfort and the chance of her recovery. I shall be happy to give you the most satis factory references, should you require them.\" The upshot of it was that Mary Mortimer,"], [123, "ON THE BRINK. 115 alias Marshall, was that same evening trans ferred to Dr. Wells's care, the house at Brompton given up, and the servants dis charged ; but in the confusion of packing and sending away, Marshall had lit upon and taken possession of Mary's marriage certificate. He had not formed any plans certainly, but he was not a man to overlook anything, not even a scrap of paper, which might be of use to him hereafter. Mortimer's affection for his wife was not yet extinguished, and he gave way to a very natural burst of grief when informed of the result of the consultation, which seemed to cut off all hope of recovery, nor did he conceal his displeasure at the change which had been effected in her surname, without consulting him. Marshall, however, pacified him without much difficulty. He represented to him how disadvantageous it would be to him to make his entrance on the scene as Earl of Tenby, with a countess in a lunatic asylum. \" At present,\" he said, \"no one need know anything"], [124, "116 ON THE BRINK. about your marriage. If, hereafter, Mrs. Mortimer should recover sufficiently to take her place in society', you can always claim her. In the mean time you have the satisfaction of knowing that she is much better taken care of than she could be in your own house.\" \"But the child! What am I to do with him ?\" said Mr. Mortimer. \" I will see about that to-morrowr. For to night he must remain here. I will speak to my landlady about it.\" The next day Marshall contrived to ferret out the wife of a gardener, near C roy don, whom he engaged to take charge of Hugh ; the nurse was informed that her services were no longer required, and with her disappeared every trace of Henry Mortimer's married life. In another week Lord Tenby died, and his title and estates devolved upon his brother, who began his career of unbridled extravagance and dissipation almost before the tomb had closed upon his predecessor. Mary was for gotten, or, if remembered, it was as an incum-"], [125, "ON THE BBINK. 117 brance, a perpetual obstacle to his full enjoy ment of all the advantages which rank and fortune, youth and good looks, are supposed to confer upon their possessor. At first Dr. Wells had thought it probable that death would close the sufferings of his patient in the course of a few months ; but, as time 'passed on, her mind settled down into a state of gloom and melancholy, varied by frequent fits of violence. With her treatment not a fault could be found. The doctor was not only one of the cleverest practitioners of the day in that particular branch of medical science, but he was conscientious and kind hearted. Nothing that art or experience could suggest was left undone which could conduce to Mary's recovery, but he wa3 at last obliged to confess that it was all in vain, that in the whole course of his practice he had never seen a more decided case of hopeless insanity. Nothing short of a miracle could restore her, and a miracle of that nature he had never witnessed."], [126, "118 ON THE BRINK. Then it was that Marshall urged upon his friend the necessity of his adopting, once for all, a decided plan by which his future life should be regulated. He suggested that, dropping all mention of his marriage with Mary Graham, her death should be announced to her father, as also the fact that she had given birth to a son, illegitimate of c'ourse, who was still alive. There was a long debate as to the expediency of mentioning that Hugh's father was now known as the Earl of Tenby, but Marshall insisted so strongly upon the danger of introducing more mystery than was absolutely necessary, that Lord Tenby ac quiesced in that, as he had in everything else, and to Marshall was intrusted the execution of the plot. By his care Hugh was transferred to Scotland, and consigned to the care of one of his father's stablemen. He it was who wrote to Mr. Graham to announce his daughter's death and the birth of his grandson ; a piece of information which was acknowledged by the return of his letter, and an intimation"], [127, "ON THE BBINK. 119 from Mr. Graham that his daughter died to him on the day when she left his house ; and that as for any children, illegitimate or not, she may have left behind her, he disowned them as he had disowned her. Thus far Mr. Marshall had succeeded in making things pleasant, and in process of time his genius took a bolder flight. Not withstanding all his financial skill, he had the mortification of seeing that the expenditure of Tenby and Co. greatly exceeded the income, large though it was, and that it was absolutely necessary to lose no time in devising some means for replenishing their exhausted coffers. He had long since expatiated upon the folly of considering Lord Tenby's union with Mary Graham in the light of a marriage. The idea of a young man being tied for life to a mad woman was repugnant to reason, an outrage upon common sense. In this view Lord Tenby fully coincided, but when Marshall hinted at his seeking in a second marriage with some wealthy heiress the happiness which"], [128, "ON THE BRINK. 120 had been denied him in the first, he demurred. He had a vague notion that, however much his first marriage was opposed to the dictates of reason, it was supported by the law of the land ; and that to take a second wife while the first was living was commonly called bigamy, an offence to which certain very ugly pains and penalties were attached. Besides, just then he was much occupied with Lady Emily Brooklyn. Marshall was disappointed, but not discouraged. He lost no opportunity of returning to the charge, dwelling much upon the fact of his friend's marriage being a pro found secret, known only to himself, and the impossibility of its being ever brought to light. By degrees his arguments made an impression, which was greatly heightened by the pecuniary difficulties in which they were by this time involved, and at length he boldly declared that his expedients for raising money were at their last ebb, and that, unless Lord Tenby adopted his suggestions, they must make up their minds to pass the remainder"], [129, "ON THE BBINK. 121 of their lives upon the scanty allowance which the creditors might be induced to make them. \" But where is this fountain of wealth to be found ?\" Lord Tenby asked, at length. \" I know of no one who would suit me; for, of course, nothing but coming at once into a sum of money sufficient to clear me, and give me a fresh start, would induce me to take such a step, and that I take it would re quire something like three hundred thousand pounds.\" \" What do you think of Miss Halsted, the banker's daughter ?\" \" I think that her father is a banker, as was his father before him. I do not ask for rank, but I must have good blood as well as money.\" \" That is an objection I should have ex pected rather from a peer of new creation, in want of connection, than from the representa tive of one of the oldest families in the kingdom. A Mortimer can marry whom he likes. Besides, Halsted is a gentleman, and I am told, for I have never seen her, that his"], [130, "122 ON THE BRINK. daughter has great beauty, and is perfectly ladylike in manner.\" \"Oh, I know Miss Halsted well enough, and a very nice girl she is. But her father may have a son, or may marry again, if Lady Miranda dies.\" \"I know from good authority,\" replied Marshall, \" that Mr. Halsted has declared his intention of making his daughter his heir in case she marries to please him. Lady Miranda must be near sixty, and he will never marry again, take my word for it.\" \" There is that fellow De Lacy always about her,\" said Lord Tenby; \"and I am told he says everywhere that they are engaged.\" \" And I say that he has been refused by the daughter and ejected by the father.\" \" You seem to have been making very minute inquiries, Marshall. Why do you not try your own luck ?\" \"Because even success would be a failure. Miss Halsted will not have a shilling if she marries against her father's consent, and he"], [131, "ON THE BRINK. 123 has set his heart upon having a peer for his son-in-law.\" At length Marshall's arguments and repre sentations were so far crowned with success, that Lord Tenby agreed to follow the Halsteds to Switzerland, and if circumstances were pro pitious, to make his proposals in due form. Mrs. Thorpe has already informed us of the uneventful termination of that expedition, and favoured us with her own conjectures as to the causes of Lord Tenby's backwardness. The real truth, however, is that, when free from Marshall's influence, he recoiled from the con sequences of an act which, if discovered, would cover him with infamy, and bring him within the clutches of the law. During his tour he had not written one single line to his confidant, and it was in a great measure to avoid an explanation that he had whiled away so many weeks at Paris. On his return to London it could no longer be avoided. To Marshall's anxious inquiries as to his proceedings, and the success which had attended them, he"], [132, "ON THE BRINK. 124 replied by saying, \" I could not do it. When I found myself alone day after day with that innocent, pure-minded girl, I could not bring myself to inflict such an injury on her. I could not so basely repay the confidence her father reposed in me.\" \" Well done, Tenby ! Ou la vertu va-t-elle se nicher? The air of the Swiss mountains must have turned your brain. Why what injury could be inflicted upon innocence and purity7 of mind by making their possessor Countess of Tenby, for such she would be to all intents and purposes? And as for the confidence reposed in you by the father, it was reposed in you for that very7 purpose. I own I am dis appointed, but I will answer for it Mr. Halsted's disappointment is far greater than mine.\" But Lord Tenby was in no humour for listening to his friend's representations, jocose or serious. \"For God's sake,\" he said, \"give me a little respite. I have plenty of annoy ances as it is.\" \" And will have plenty more. It was with"], [133, "ON THE BRINK. 125 the utmost difficulty I could raise the five thousand pounds for Colonel Brooklyn, and now I consider it as so much money thrown away. As long as there was a chance of Miss Halsted it was desirable to avoid an exposure, but my own opinion is that he could not have recovered a shilling in a court of law.\" \" Damn Colonel Brooklyn ! I wish I had never heard his name.\" \" To that I say most heartily, Amen. But that will not help us. You are protected by your privilege, but I see the doors of a prison opening to receive me. I suppose there are at least ten thousand pounds' worth of your bills flying about the world with my name on the back of them.\" And indeed Lord Tenby's affairs were in a desperate state of insolvency, when to add to his tribulations, he received Mr. Halsted's polite intimation that he had become his principal creditor, and was desirous of a settle ment. \" Here is a pleasant communication,\""], [134, "126 ON THE BRINK. he exclaimed, throwing Halsted's missive across the table to Marshall, who was breakfast ing with him. \" What the devil is to be done now ?\" \"There are but two ways of meeting the difficulty,\" replied his friend, after perusing the obnoxious document. \" You must either pay him what you owe him, or you must marry his daughter. Now, as the first is completely out of the question, the second is the only course left you to pursue.\" \" Nonsense, Marshall ! I wish you wrould be serious. How can I ask a man who writes me such a letter as that to give me his daughter ? Why, it is a regular declaration of war.\" \" The object of all war is peace,\" said Marshall, \" and if you take my advice, yTou will be able to dictate your own terms. I was never more convinced of anything in my life than that Halsted means to have you for a son-in-law. He has abundance of energy and determination, and will carry his point sooner"], [135, "ON THE BRINK. 127 or iatei\\ So you had better yield with a good grace at once.\" \"How can I,\" said Lord Tenby, petulantly, \" with that infernal millstone round my neck ? Does Wells hold out no hopes of her dying ?\" \" None whatsoever, I am sorry to say. Her bodily health is as good as ever, and she may outlive both of us. But, dead or alive, she can never interfere with any projects you may form, and in considering them you may put her out of the question as much as if she had never existed. Who can identify Mary Marshall with Mary Graham, who is supposed by all those who ever knew her, or heard of her, to be dead. But even were anything so improbable to occur, who would think of hunting out the proofs of a marriage which took place some years ago at an obscure Scotch inn, before witnesses who knew nothing about either of you, and who probably by this time have forgotten the whole transaction.

Whether he felt quite as much confidence as his tone was intended to express, may be doubted. \" Well then, what is there to stand in your way ? I presume, after this rough specimen of Mr. Halsted's style of wooing, for it is nothing else, all y7our scruples as regards him have vanished.\" \" Oh, after this letter, old Halsted can have no claim on my consideration, but I confess I should be sorry to bring that beautiful girl to grief.\" \"Grief!

To return from this long, but necessary digres sion. We left Lord Tenby and Mr. Marshall together, the latter having just announced Mary7 Graham's, or, to give her her proper title, Lady Tenby7's death, coupled with the information that in her last moments she had called upon her husband and child. For a minute or so Lord Tenby7 remained silent, shading his face with his hand. \" When did it take place ?\" he said at last. \" Yesterday morning,\" Marshall replied. \"And I am come to take your instructions for the funeral.\" \" Mv instructions !

In short, your word and your bond seem to me to be of equal value.

A woman who cohabits with a man is either his wife or his \u25a0\" But before he could utter the offensive word, Lord Tenby sprang at him, and caught him by the throat. \" I warned you,\" he exclaimed, \" but you will have it, and you shall.\""], [145, "ON THE BRINK. 137 Lord Tenby was slightly built, and appar ently destitute of all physical strength, while Marshall was a large, powerful man ; but whether it was that the latter was taken com pletely by surprise, or that his assailant derived vigour from his rage, Lord Tenby flung him to the ground, and seizing a cane which happened to be at hand, gave him half a dozen severe blows on his arms and body. Then opening the door, he dragged him by the collar to the landing-place, and left him to his medi tations. For a few seconds Marshall remained half unconscious, as if unable to realize what had occurred. At length, slowly raising himself, he descended the stairs, and let himself out into the street. The blows he had received were painful, and nothing more, but the fall had inflicted on him more serious injury. The air revived him, and enabled him to recall his scattered thoughts. Dragging himself along with some difficulty, he hailed the first cab he met, and told the man to drive him to the"], [146, "138 ON THE BRINK. nearest police office. It was, however, already late in the afternoon, and the office was closed. With an imprecation of disappointment, he drove back to his lodgings, fully determined on the morrow to apply for a warrant against Lord Tenby, on the twofold charge of assault and bigamy7. In the course of the evening, however, he felt so unwell, that he was obliged to send for medical assistance. The worthy practitioner who came at his call, and to whom he related a somewhat confused story of having fallen among thieves, took him in hand at once. He soon ascertained that no bones were broken, but the system had sustained a severe shock ; there was danger of fever supervening, and the patient must submit to a regular course of treatment, and must upon no account whatsoever think of leaving the house for some days. Marshall, who hardly knew what fear was when he could see and appreciate his danger, had a great terror of illness, and was easily persuaded to acquiesce in his doctor's decision. He promised not to leave the house,"], [147, "ON THE BRINK. 139 or even rise from his bed without permission, and more than a week elapsed before his able attendant, who visited him regularly three times a day, removed his prohibition. Marshall thus had ample time for reflection, and it struck him that, if he proceeded with the charge of bigamy before he had made his terms with Hugh Graham, his revenge indeed might be gratified, but his purse would be none the heavier. He ascertained, mean time, that the young gentleman himself was attached to the mission of San Marino, and consequently a personal interview with him at present was out of the question. Moreover, as he was still under age, and incapable of entering into any legal contract, Marshall decided that his first application ought to be made to Mary Graham's father, as her son's nearest relative, although, from what he recollected of the stern old minister, he anticipated no very pleasant recep tion, fraught though he would be with good news. Then the recollection of Mr. Halsted swept"], [148, "140 ON THE BRINK. across his mind. Was no money to be made out of him ? Of course there was, and he was the first person on whom the experiment ought to be made. No doubt, when informed of the secret of which Marshall was sole possessor, he would give to the half of his fortune to shield his daughter from disgrace. Or, if he should be mad enough to refuse, it would then be time enough to have recourse to Mr. Graham. Then ensued a very7 delicate discussion between Marshall and his conscience, with a view to ascertain how far, in case Halsted purchased the silence which was to disinherit Hugh Graham, the said Marshall would be bound to observe his part of the compact. The dis putants could not arrive at any satisfactory solution ; and like church-rates, the Protestant establishment in Ireland, and other vexed questions, it was left for future deliberation. The only determination at which Marshall arrived was that his first visit, when he was permitted to leave the house, should be to Mr. Halsted."], [149, "ON THE BRINK. 141 That gentleman and Nelly were in great affliction. Good, kind-hearted Auntie was dead. On the day of Mabel Langley-'s marriage she caught cold, which turned to bronchitis, and carried her off in a few days. Her niece's grief amounted to despair. \" Take me with you, Auntie,\" she cried, a few hours before Mrs. Thorpe's death. \" There is no happiness or peace for me to hope for on earth, and I am so weary. I so long to be at rest.\" \" Oh, Nelly, my child, say not so ! You have still duties to perform on earth which will bring you happiness, if not here, at least here after. Think of your father. What would be his fate without you? Think of Hugh, who loves you so well.\" \" But to lose you, Auntie, my mother, my more than mother !\" \" Well, my love, it must have come at last. Now, or a few years later, matters but little. And Nelly, if it is permitted me, I shall still watch over you ; I shall pray for your happiness where I am going. Aud do not grieve for me ;"], [150, "142 ON THE BRINK. I am going to my rest. I have endeavoured to do my duty here to the best of my ability, and I feel sure that God in His great mercy will pardon my failings.\" \" Yes, yes, you are sure of pardon ; you who never said an unkind word, who never offended a human being ; you whose whole life has been one of charity- and forbearance, who never had a thought y-ou would wish to disown. Would that I could say the same, for I feel I am not fit to die.\" \" My love, I never was tried as you have been. I have had no great temptation to resist. You have, and may- have still greater ; but promise me, Nelly7, promise a dy-ing woman, that whatever may befall yTou, in whatever extremity you may find yourself, your first act shall be to ask strength of God to bear it, and be very sure He will not fail you \" \" I do. I promise it in all sincerity of heart.\" \" And Nelly, when you write to Arthur, give him my love and blessing, and my thanks"], [151, "ON THE BBINK. 143 for the great sacrifice he made. Tell him that, next to you, he had the first place in my heart.\" She died, and was buried ; and it was on the second day after her funeral that Mr. Marshall presented himself at Ealing, and asked to see Mr. Halsted on most important, business. Halsted was sitting alone with his daughter, talking over the melancholy scenes of the last few days, when the message was brought to him. \"Marshall!\" he said. \"Who is he? Did you ever see him before, John ?\" \" No sir. He is a tall, middle-aged gentle man.\" \" Surely, papa,\" interposed Nelly, \" it cannot be the Mr. Marshall who was Lord Tenby's secretary !\" \"No, I should think not. At all events, John, tell him that I am suffering from a severe family affliction, and that I am not at all equal to business to-day. Say that unless it is really of an urgent nature, and admits of no delay, I must beg him to defer it till next week.\""], [152, "144 ON THE BRINK. John departed upon his mission, but returned in a few minutes. \" The gentleman says, sir, that the communication he has to make is of the most important nature, and he is sure that, when you have heard it, you will admit as much yourself.\" \" Very well, if it must be so, show him in. Leave me now, Nelly, and let me know as soon as the carriage is ready. It will be a good excuse for cutting matters short, and getting rid of my visitor.\" As one door closed upon her, Marshall was introduced by the other. Mr. Halsted recog nized him at once, and as he did so his brow contracted. \" Mr. Marshall,\" he said, \"lam at a loss to know what the nature of y7our business can be ; but if it is connected with Lord Tenby-, I at once refuse to hear you, and refer you to my attorney7.\" \"Mr. Halsted,\" the other replied, \"my business does undoubtedly refer to Lord Tenby, but it is entirely without his know ledge that I am here, nor do I appear as his"], [153, "ON THE BBINK. 145 friend or agent. My object is to disclose to you circumstances which deeply affect your daughter's welfare, and which it is impossible to relate to any one but to you or to her. If, when you have heard my story, you still think it advisable to refer me to your attorney, you will be at full liberty to do so.\" He spoke with so much solemnity that he made an impression on his auditor, who begged him to take a chair and to proceed. He complied, and gave Halsted the whole story of Mary Graham, from the time of her first acquaintance and marriage with Henry Mortimer to that of her death. He did so with the utmost caution, almost with gentle ness, which seemed to increase as he proceeded. He saw that Halsted was no longer the strong, resolute man, whom he had left a few years before in full vigour of mind and body, and as it would by no means have suited Marshall's purpose to throw him into a fit, he followed Isaac Walton's advice as to the best method of impaling a frog, and handled him as though he VQL. III. l"], [154, "146 ON THE BRINK. loved him. Still it was impossible that such a tale, though told with the utmost care, should not produce an effect upon the most impassible of human beings. No one could exceed Halsted in his power of self-control, extending even to his features ; but as Marshall proceeded, the quivering of his lip and eyelid, the perspiration gathering on his brow, showed how powerfully he was affected. He did not ask a question, or make a remark till the revelation was complete, and then he said, \" Mr. Marshall, bad as my opinion of Lord Tenby is, I do not think him capable of a crime like this. I do not believe a word you have said.\" \" It is quite natural you should say so, Mr. Halsted,\" Marshall replied, unmoved, \"nor do I expect you to believe my bare word. I come, therefore, prepared with proof. In this packet you will find copies of all the documents necessary to support my charge against Lord Tenby ; viz., the certificate of the marriage of Henry Mortimer with Mary Graham, the"], [155, "ON THE BBINK. 147 address of the house in which they lived as man and wife at Brompton, the baptismal certificate of their legitimate son, Dr. Wells's agreement to receive Mary Marshall as an inmate of his establishment, and the certificate of her death, which occurred ten days ago. To these, which are only copies, I add two letters in Lord Tenby's handwriting to myself, in which he speaks of the lady known as Mary- Marshall as his wife. I have half a dozen more to the same effect in my possession, which can be produced, if required. In short, you will see that the chain of evidence is complete, independently of my assertions, which I could substantiate upon oath. But I have no such intention. Although I have no great reason to feel grateful either to yourself, who deprived me of the management of Lord Tenby's affairs, or to your daughter, who insisted upon my leaving her house, I have no wish to carry my animosity so far as to drive her from the position she occupies. I alone am in possession of the information which"], [156, "148 ON THE BRINK. could effect this, and, as far as I am concerned, she may remain Countess of Tenby to the end of time. As a man of the world, of course I mean to make use of my secret for my own advantage ; but you will not find me ex orbitant in my demands. What I would suggest now is, that you should examine these documents carefully, and take any means y-ou may deem most satisfactory for ascertaining the truth of my story. This will require some days, and then \u2014 suppose we say this day fortnight \u2014 I will wait upon you again, and make my proposals. I have every wish to act towards you and Miss Halsted in a friendly manner, and if you meet me in the same liberal spirit, there can be no reason why everything should not be adjusted to our mutual satisfaction at our next meeting. I will now close this most painful interview, and take my leave. I have the honour of wishing you good morning.\" During this oration Mr. Halsted had not made the slightest attempt at interruption,"], [157, "ON THE BRINK. 149 either by marks of assent or dissent. The blow had, to a certain extent, deadened his faculties \u2014 for he could no longer disbelieve \u2014 and made him but dimly conscious of the present. His thoughts were busy with the past, with Nelly's mother, the wife of his early love ; and he could almost fancy that he heard her voice ringing in his ear, and in a tone of rebuke asking him what care he had taken for the welfare of her child. That he understood what was said was evident from the flush which swept across his face when he heard his daughter spoken of as Miss Halsted, but he made no further sign. He did not return Marshall's parting salutation, and the only notice he took of his exit was by the mecha nical action of ringing the bell. Marshall departed, and a few minutes later the carriage drove up to the door. Nelly, who was rather slow at her toilet, went down as soon as she was readv, to summon her father when, to her horror, she saw him lying on the floor, breathing heavily, with his eyes open,"], [158, "150 ON THE BRINK. and grasping a bundle of papers in his hand. The only sign of consciousness which he gave, if such it could be called, was closing his eyes, as if in pain, when they fell upon his daughter. Her first movement was to loosen his cravat, and then to ring the bell with such violence that all the servants rushed into the room. Their master was carried upstairs and laid in his own bed, Nelly- having taken possession of his papers. A messenger was dispatched in search of the village Esculapius, and the carriage was sent to London with a summons for the best medical assistance. Dr. Jones, the general practitioner, was the first to arrive, and being a man of sense and decision, as well as skill, at once adopted the measures which in his judgment the case required, without waiting for the arrival of the two more renowned, if not more learned gentlemen, whose attendance Lady Tenby had requested. When they did make their appear ance in the course of the afternoon, they entirely approved of all that had been done, and all that"], [159, "ON THE BRINK. 151 was proposed to be done. Mr. Halsted had had a slight apoplectic seizure, but though it was impossible to pronounce him out of danger, he was doing as well as could reasonably be expected. It would be necessary to keep him perfectly quiet, and above all to avoid every thing that could excite or agitate him. Nelly promised to do her best, but she felt how much more easy it is to give such an injunction than to follow it. Dr. Jones had promised, as soon as he had gone through his daily round of visits, to return to the villa and pass the night there, and till his arrival Nelly kept her watch in the sick room. Her father recognized her, and seemed to derive pleasure from her presence, though at times, when his eyes were turned on her, there was the same expression of pain which she had remarked when she first found him on the floor. It grieved her, though she could hardly tell why ; and when, on the doctor's arrival, she took her leave of him for the night, she kissed his forehead with more than usual emotion."], [160, "152 ON THE BRINK. Nelly had not thought it necessary to mention Marshall's visit, when giving her account of the state in which she had found her father. She knew that, as a man of business, he was exceedingly tenacious of the secrets of the prison-house, and this might be one of them. The grief he had felt for his sister in-law's death, the comparatively idle habits into which he had fallen since he had given up his business, the annoyances he had undergone at the hands of Lord Tenby, wdiich were matters of public notoriety7, advancing age, and rather a full habit of body7, were quite sufficient to account for his attack to the pro fessional gentlemen, but not to Nelly-. She knew how temperate he was, how fond of riding and every sort of outdoor exercise ; she knew that all irritation in consequence of Lord Tenby's transgressions had long since passed away, and that his grief for Auntie's death, though deep and sincere, was not of such a nature as to have an effect upon his bodily health. There must be some other"], [161, "ON THE BBINK. 153 cause, and she connected it with Marshall's visit. Then she recollected the papers which she had taken out of her father's hands. \u25a0 They, in all probability, would reveal the secret of his sudden illness, and she felt that, under present circumstances, she would be not only- justified in opening them, but that it might be her duty to do so. As far as she was aware, for some time past her father, even on matters of busi ness, had not had a secret from her, and it was very- possible that these papers might have reference to some affair on which it was neces sary to come to a prompt decision. Mr. Halsted was not able to attend to it himself, and the duty of replacing him naturally devolved upon her, his daughter and heiress. She opened her desk, in which these documents had been hastily locked up, and if any- doubt had existed in her mind as to the propriety of her proceeding, it would have been removed by the words which first caught her eye : \"Documents relating to the Earl of Tenby's marriage with\" Mary- Graham.\""], [162, "154 ON THE BRINK. With impatient hands and eager eyes she undid the packet, and ran through the proofs which established the legitimacy of Hugh Graham, for at first this was the point which struck her most forcibly7. Lord Tenby's base ness, and the unnatural hatred he showed towards his unfortunate son, filled her with the greater horror that she could not conceive the motive for it, for even, after casting her eyes over the certificate of Mary Graham's death, which she did without noticing the date, she failed to perceive the effect which these dis- closures had upon her own position. It was only when she came to a sort of summary of the case, which Marshall had drawn up, that her ey-es were opened. It concluded by these words : \" Thus you will see that, at the time when the Earl of Tenby led Eleanor Halsted to the altar, he had a wife living, and conse quently this second pretended marriage is null and void.\" \" Great God !\" she exclaimed, \" what cau he mean ?\" and then she took up the certificate"], [163, "ON THE BRINK. 155 of her predecessor's death, and, as well as her agitation would allow her, read it carefully over till she came to the date, which fully con firmed her misfortune. She let the paper drop, and hid her face amidst the cushions of the sofa, as if to hide from herself the burning blush which covered her neck and face. \" Oh, Auntie !\" she cried, in a voice of anguish and despair, \"why would you not take me with you from this world of misery and sin !\" It was a cry wrung from her heart, nor was it made altogether in vain. It seemed as if she, whose devoted love for the child of her adoption had never failed in life, was still per mitted to watch over her in death. While the well-loved name was still trembling on her lips, Nelly recalled the last promise she had made her aunt, and throwing herself on her knees, implored, in humble and self-accusing accents, the protection of Him who alone could assist her in her need. She prayed as she had never prayed before, with a fervour and single ness of heart which proved how firm was her"], [164, "ON THE BRINK. 156 trust in the divine mercy she invoked. Prayer has been said with truth to be its own answer. As she acknowledged, with the tears of contri tion streaming down her face, the justice of the punishment which had fallen upon her, and how little she deserved the many mercies which had already been vouchsafed to her, every word she uttered seemed to meet with a response full of consolation and fatherly love. She asked for strength to bear with resignation all the afflictions with which it might be His pleasure to afflict her, and the prayer was heard. She rose from her knees strengthened and comforted. She had need of it, for there was much to do and no one but herself to do it. It was nearly eleven o'clock, but she felt that it was useless for her to seek for rest, at least till she had arranged some plan. But what \u2014 and how was she to set about it ? Once more in her per plexity she prayed for guidance and assist ance. Her maid knocked at the door. \" If you"], [165, "ON THE BRINK. 157 please, my lady,\" she said, \" Mr. Burnthwaite is below. He has just heard of master's illness, and is come to know how he is.\" Burnthwaite ! The only man who possessed her father's entire confidence ! Nelly-'s mind was made up at once. She saw in his arrival at that late hour something like a miraculous answer to her prayer. She would tell him all, md be guided by his advice. \"Show Mr. Burnthwaite into my father's study,\" she replied, \" and tell him I will be with him in a minute.\""], [166, "ON THE BRINK. 158 CHAPTER VII. Nelly went down with Marshall's papers in her hand, and found Mr. Burnthwaite anxiously expecting her. Although he had begun life in the humble situation of clerk in the banking house of old Mr. Halsted, he had, partly by his own merits, and partly through circum stances which have already been detailed, risen to the position of his son's most trusted con fidant, a position of which he proved himself worthy by his attachment and devotion. On Nelly's regard he had if possible still stronger claims. He had known her mother ; he had been the firm and consistent friend of her aunt ; and by all he was an acknowledged member of"], [167, "ON THE BRINK. 159 the family, and moreover, he was one of her trustees. He was now nearly sixty, and had never married ; but many thought that if he had met with any encouragement from Mrs. Elizabeth Thorpe, he would have resigned with out a sigh all the advantages of single blessed ness. \" How kind of you, Lady Tenby,\" he said, as she entered the room, \" to see me yourself at this time of night ! I only returned home half an hour ago, when I heard in a confused way of this grievous misfortune, and could not rest till I knew more. They tell me he is going on favourably. Is that the case ?\" \" Yes. The medical men all speak cheer fully, though they cannot yet say all danger is passed. They will be here again to-morrow at twelve, then we shall know more.\" \" Well, then, I will now say good-night, and God bless you. I trust you will forgive this intrusion.\" \" Intrusion ! Oh, Mr. Burnthwaite ! it is God who has sent you here, for I am sorely"], [168, "ON THE BRINK. 160 in need of a friend and adviser. Can you spare me an hour now ?\" \"As many as you please, my dear young lady, so tell me at once what it is that troubles you.\" She told him shortly the events of the morning, and then put the packet of papers into his hand. \" Read these,\" she said, \" and then tell me your opinion of them honestly and truly. You cannot hurt my feelings by so doing ; the blow is already struck, for I have not a doubt in my own mind that they7 are genuine. What I want is to know how I am to act. In the mean time, while you are look ing them over, I will see if my- father wants anything.\" \" She went upstairs to a sort of dressing room opening into Mr. Halsted's bedroom, and there she found the doctor busily employed in writing letters. He looked np as she entered, and put his finger to his lips. \" Hush !\" he whispered, \" we are doing charmingly. He is asleep, and his breathing is like a child's. In"], [169, "ON THE BBINK. 161 another four and twenty hours I trust I shall be able to congratulate your ladyship on seeing our way out of the wood.\" \" Thank God, and next to him, thank you,\" she said, holding out her hand to him. \" But there is something about which I wish to con sult you. I cannot doubt that this attack has been in a very great measure brought on by some information of a nature distressing to us both, of which he supposes me ignorant. Chance has made me acquainted with it.

If your ladyship will permit me, I will tell you when, in my judgment, the proper time for mentioning it has arrived.\" \" Thank you, again. Have you got every thing you wish for ?\" \" Everything.

If I could pro cure one \" In the midst of her grief Nelly could hardly7 refrain from a smile. She promised to do her best for him, and after a searching inquiry the desired head-dress was procured from the coachman. Her meeting with Burnthwaite was more painful than she could have supposed. He took her in his arms and kissed her forehead. \" Forgive me,\" he said, \" but, though I have never ventured to express it, I have loved you like a daughter of my own, and now to see you the victim \" He could not finish the sentence, but sobbed like a child. Instead of receiving consolation, she was obliged to give it. \"Dear old friend,\" she said, \" if I have much cause for sorrow, I have also much to be thankful for when I find such"], [171, "ON IHE BRINK 163 as you to support me in my distress. Try to compose yourself, and give me yrour advice. What is the first step I ought to take ? for I see you are as much convinced as I am of the truth of this hateful story.\" \" I fear it is but too true,\" he replied. \" No one would have ventured to invent a tale so easy of detection, if false.\" \" But what could have been Mr. Marshall's object in bringing it forward now ?\" she asked. \" To make money somehow or other, the villain ! But we will not think of him now7. The first thing to be done is to obtain proof positive that the certificates are genuine. Till assured of that we can do nothing, and for that purpose it will be necessary to employ some confidential agent. I must think it over, and to-morrow- will let you know my opinion. But one piece of advice I can give you now. Send for Sir William Claremont at once, and consult him. The secret will be safe with him.\" \" Sir William is at Brighton with his"], [172, "164 ON THE BRINK. mother,\" she observed ; \" and, besides, he is Lord Tenby's brother-in-law. It will not be right to mix him up in such a business as this.\" \" He is your trustee, and a man of honour. He will see justice done you, and I should feel a sort of delicacy7 in taking any step in this matter without at least informing him of it. Let me telegraph for him the first thing in the morning.\" She consented, and as nothing more was to be done that night, Mr. Burnthwaite took his leave. As he shook hands with her, he said, \" Ah, how I wish we had Sir Arthur Compton here ! His cool head and sound judgment would be invaluable in such an emergency.\" Her thoughts, too, had reverted more than once to Arthur Compton, but had been as often repressed, as an offence against His laws on whose protection she had thrown herself. In the confusion of mind into which the dis covery of Lord Tenby's crime had thrown her, she had failed to realize all its consequences."], [173, "ON THE BRINK. 165 She felt that for years she had been usurping the place of another, that she had been bearing a title to which she had no right ; but it was not till some time after Buruthwaite's de parture, while malgre elle she was pondering his last words, that the whole truth flashed upon her. If she was not Lady Tenby she was Eleanor Halsted ; if she was not a wife, she was free to give her hand where she had given her heart ; and, in the wildness of her joy, for a time she forgot the degradation by which her freedom was purchased. Then other thoughts arose. Would Compton con sent to unite his fate to that of one at whom, how7ever unjustly, the finger of scorn might be pointed ? But even while asking herself the question, her heart reproved her. She knew his noble nature too well to doubt for a moment his constancy- and truth. Her misfortunes would but make her dearer to him than ever. There was more difficulty- in disposing of the next idea which presented itself. Ought she to accept his generous devotion ? How would"], [174, "166 ON THE BRINK. his friends, how w7ould Sir Philip and Lady Winifred look upon a marriage w7hich should bring into their family a woman with a tainted name. While she was endeavouring to recon cile these difficulties, nature asserted her rights. Worn out with all she had gone through, Nelly fell asleep. When she awoke next morning she was greeted with the agreeable intelligence that her father had enjoyed some hours of refreshing sleep, and was perfectly conscious, though his speech was so thick as to be almost unintelli gible. Jones was gone, but had left a note addressed to Lady Tenby, in which he said he should be back at ten o'clock, and recommended that for the present no disclosure of an agitating nature should be made to his patient. As soon as she was dressed, Nelly- went to her father's room. His eyes lighted with pleasure as she entered, but when she knelt down bv his bedside and kissed his hand, they were dimmed with tears. \" Poor, poor Nelly !\" he contrived to falter out."], [175, "ON THE BRINK. 167 \"No, no,\" she cried; \"happy Nelly, who finds you so much better. But you are not to attempt to speak, and to take away all tempta tion to do so, I will read you the paper.\" She remained with him for a couple of hours, when the doctor again made his ap pearance. \" I think,\" he said, \" your ladyship may now dismiss all apprehension. I shall stay here till my learned brethren arrive from London, and then we will make vou our formal report, which I have no doubt will be a satis factory one.\" Mr. Burnthwaite was now announced, and Nelly went down to receive him. He had telegraphed to Sir William Claremont, and brought that gentleman's answer, to the effect that he should come up by the first express train, and might be expected at Ealing about two. \" And then,\" said Burnthwaite, \" you will have a really efficient counsellor and protector.\" \" I desire none better than you.\" \" Yes, but I am old, and unable to serve"], [176, "168 ON THE BRINK. you as I wish. I will do what I can, however. I will be here to meet Sir William at two, and in the mean time will make some inquiries as to the events which are said to have taken place in London.\" \" I suppose it is necessary,\" she replied. \" I thought I had strengthened myself to bear it all, but I cannot tell you how I dread, how I shrink from going into these details. If these charges are confirmed, as confirmed they will be, I shall stand before the world a convicted impostor.\" \" No, no. As the innocent victim of a most nefarious conspiracy7. I am glad to hear that your father is going on so well. Do you think he would like to see me ?\" \" Not to-day ; not till I have found au opportunity of explaining to him what we are doing. It would be such a comfort to me to know that we have his approbation before going further.\" Burnthwaite departed on his mission. The London doctors arrived at the hour they had"], [177, "ON THE BRINK. 169 named, and pronounced Mr. Halsted to be in a fair way of recovery. Every7 symptom was favourable, and they all agreed that they had never seen such rapid progress in a similar case. \" A constitution of iron,\" said one of them, \"and I congratulate your lady-ship on it, in a double sense, for such constitutions are generally hereditary.\" Poor Nelly hardly knew whether this, as regarded herself, was a subject of congratula tion, or not. Jones remained a few minutes after the others, to tell her that he thought she might now make the communication to Mr. Halsted, of which she had spoken, with good effect. He had fully regained his powers of memory, and if there was anything on his mind likely to harass him, it was desirable to relieve him from it as much as possible. She thanked him, and said that she would take an oppor tunity of doing so in the course of the after noon. It struck her that it would be better to wait till she had seen her two trustees, and had"], [178, "170 ON THE BRINK settled with them the course to be taken, before speaking to her father. He was in no state to take part in the deliberation, and it would no doubt save him from much excite ment if he found their plans already formed. Of course, if he made any7 strong objection to them, they must be modified and altered to meet his views. Shortly before two o'clock Burnthwaite returned to give an account of his mission, in which he had been only top successful. He had found the house at Brompton in which the Honourable Mr. and Mrs. Mortimer had lived for more than a y-ear ; and he ascertained at the registrar's office that the child born to them had been entered by the name of Hugh, son of Henry- Mortimer and Mary his wife. In this case the \"honourable\" had been omitted, whether intentionally or not, it was of course impossible to say7. He had then called upon Dr. Wells, whom he was fortunate enough to find in London. Burnthwaite was not un known to the doctor, who banked with the"], [179, "ON THE BRINK. 171 house in which he was employed, and he had no difficulty in obtaining all the particulars of Mary Marshall's case. Wells said that, from something Mr. Marshall once let drop, he had reason to believe that his patient had been a Mr. Mortimer's mistress ; and he was con firmed in this opinion by the fact that all payments had been made by the Earl of Tenby-, the head, he believed, of the Mortimer familv. \" Was she really mad ?\" asked Nelly. \"Beyond a doubt,\" Burnthwaite replied. \" Wells is a man of the highest respectability. Moreover, she was supplied with every comfort and even luxury that could be required. Dr. Wells was enjoined to spare no expense.\" \"Thank God for that, at least.\" At this juncture the door-bell was rung. \" Sir William, no doubt,\" said Nelly. \" You must tell him all. I could not bear to be present, and shall go to my own room, for my father would be sure to remark my agitation."], [180, "172 ON THE BRINK. You must send for me as soon as you have explained everything, though how to meet him, or indeed any of my old friends, I know not.\" For half an hour she paced up and down her room, her heart beating as if it would burst, when a message was brought her that Mr. Burnthwaite wished to see her. She went down stairs, but stood for nearly7 a minute with her hand on the lock of the door before she could muster courage to turn it. At length she entered the room, but as she saw Sir William advancing to meet her, a dizziness came across her, and it was all she could do to reach the nearest chair and sink into it. Sir William knelt down and kissed her hand. \"Ah, Lady7 Tenby,\" he said, \"I can well understand that vou shrink from the si\u00b0ht of *>\u25a0 O any one connected with the villain who has done y7ou such grievous wrong ; but believe me, there is not one of his kindred who would not stand forward as y7our avenger. God knows how dearly I loved my wife, but if her brother and I were to meet this moment with swords"], [181, "ON THE BBINK. 173 in our hands, I would do my best to take his life.\" \" Sir William,\" she said, laying her hand on his arm, \"there must be no violence. Promise me. The thought of such a thing would only make me more miserable than I am.\" \" Yes, you are right. There are crimes which no man of honour could chastise without being defiled. This is one of them, and for the punishment of such we have gaols and the gibbet.\" \"And, Sir William,\" she continued, \"I will not hear of a prosecution. Upon that my mind is made up.\" \"My dear Eleanor, for, even if no longer connected, I trust you will still allow me to address you by that name, w-e must leave the discussion of these questions till your father is able to take part in it. What we have now to do is to get up our case. Mr. Burnthwaite has employed his time most ably, and the only thing remaining to be done is to ascertain if"], [182, "174 ON THE BRINK. this alleged marriage really did take place. Of this I grieve to say there can be no reason able doubt, but we must have legal proof. Burnthwaite thought of sending down Cox's confidential clerk to make inquiries, but in such an investigation as this the less we have to do with lawyers and lawyers' clerks the better. I propose going down myself. I shall start to-night, and hope to be able to get through my work to-morrow. Iu that case I should be back on the day after, or at the latest on the day7 after that.\" \" Oh, Sir William,\" she said, with the tears in her eyes, \" how can I ever thank you as I ought ! But y7ou will be killing yourself with fatigue. There can be no occasion for such excessive haste.\" \" When once I undertake anything,\" he replied, \" I like to get through it at once, and as for fatigue, Compton could tell you of much greater feats than this which we have performed together. I only wish we had him here now.\" \" And, Sir William,\" said Nelly, trying to"], [183, "ON THE BRINK. 175 keep down the colour which rose to her cheeks at mention of Compton's name, \" when once Mary Graham's marriage is established, we must lose no time in seeing that justice is done to her son. Ought not his grandfather to be informed of it ?\" \" Undoubtedly. If you will trust that to me, I will do what circumstances may make advisable. Perhaps I may find it necessary7 to see Mr. Graham myself, in which case I should not be able to return as soon as 1 mentioned, but you shall hear from me daily. In the mean time, let me strongly- advise you to say nothing on the subject to any living being, till we have well considered our next steps.\" \"Ah, the news of my disgrace will be public soon enough.\" \" Your disgrace J Lord Tenby's, you mean. You can never be other than the object of the deepest and most respectful sympathy7.\" The two gentlemen took their leave soon after, and then Nelly thought the time had"], [184, "176 ON THE BRINK. arrived for informing her father of what had passed. He was dozing when she entered the room, but woke as she approached the bed. He gazed at her for a moment, and then with a deep sigh closed his eyes. \" Father,\" she said, kneeling down by the bedside, \" will y-ou not look at me and bless your Nelly ?\" \" Ah,\" he said, \" if my blessing were of any avail ! But y-ou little know \" \" I know all, father. I have read through the papers which Mr. Marshall left with you. and know that I am not, that I have never been, Lord Tenby-'s wife.\" \"What! You know that, and you do not curse me, the author of your misfortune !\" \"Oh, father, how could such a thought enter your mind ? Do you not know that you are the object of my love and veneration ; that for the unceasing care with which you minister to my happiness I owe you a boundless debt of gratitude ? And in this matter you are not more to blame than I am. We both made a sad mistake, but it was"], [185, "ON THE BRINK 177 one against which no human prudence could have guarded. The consequences fall upon us both, but we must endeavour to comfort and support each other. Thank God, you are still spared me.\" For a time he was silent. \" Kiss me, Nelly,\" he said at length. \" While we love each other we can never be quite unhappy, but the bitterest feeling of all is to know how little my affection has been, or can be of use to you. And now, when I most need my health and strength, to be confined to a bed of sickness, for weeks, for months perhaps. Did Jones tell you when I should be about again ?\" \"No. He said no one could be making better progress, but he is afraid of all agitation, and therefore I have taken upon myself to act as I thought you would wish me. I have consulted Sir William Claremont and Mr. Burnthwaite.\" She then related all that had been done. When she had concluded, his mind was VOL. III."], [186, "ON THE BRINK. 178 evidently more at ease. He praised in the highest terms her strength of mind, and the judgment she had shown in her proceedings. Nor was he sparing in his expressions of gratitude to the two gentlemen who had so warmly and so promptly espoused her cause. \"I should like to see Burnthwaite when he comes this evening,\" he said. \" I shall know no rest till we have taken measures for the punishment of that villain.\" \" Oh, father, leave him to his own conscience. Think how mercifully God has dealt with you, and for His sake, who has just saved y-ou from death, forgive him.\" \" Nelly, in such a matter as this, whatever our own wishes may be, the duty we owe to society supersedes them. But we will not talk of this now. We have plenty- of time before us to consider how we are to act.\" Nelly very wisely allowed the subject to drop. He had already talked more than was good for him, and she contrived to turn the conversation into other channels. Soon after"], [187, "ON THE BRINK 179 Jones looked in agaiu, and was pretty well satisfied with the state of his patient, though he thought it necessary to repeat his caution against all unnecessary excitement. Then came Burnthwaite, and as he had been duly warned, he contented himself with confirming Nelly's statements, and positively- refused to allow himself to be dragged into any discussion. \" When you are able to leave your bed, sir,\" he said, \"it will be quite time enough to talk matters over ; and the quieter you keep now, the sooner you will be able to get up.\" The following day Mr. Halsted was allowed to sit up for an hour ; and in the evening a telegram arrived from Sir William, stating that the information they had received was perfectly correct. He had seen and conversed with three persons who were present at the ceremony, and remembered the circumstances connected with it. He was on the point of setting out in search of Mr. Graham, with whose address he had been furnished. He expected to be in London in two or three days ;"], [188, "180 ON THE BRINK. but it was nearly a week before he made his appearance. Mr. Graham had left home to attend a meeting of the clergy ; and as it was idle to suppose that he would occupy himself with temporal matters till his spiritual concerns were settled, Sir William had nothing for it but to wait his return. In the mean time Mr. Halsted rapidly re covered his health ; but as he did so his mind reverted with fresh irritation to the cruel position in which his daughter was placed, and he exerted all his ingenuity in devising some means for extricating her from it. It wras not easy, but at length he thought he saw a loophole of escape. That Lord Tenby's wife was living when he married Nelly was certain ; that Hugh Graham was his legitimate sou and heir was equally- so. Halsted was a just and honourable man, and, even for his daughter's sake, would have scorned to employ any unfair means for depriving Hugh of his inheritance. But the date of his mother's death was a secret ; why should it not remain so ? It had"], [189, "ON THE BRINK. 181 been announced to her father long before Nelly's marriage; and if that was assumed as a fact, his daughter might still remain Lady Tenby without injury to any one \u2014 Lord Tenby would no doubt be only too happy to connive at it \u2014 they had no children, and as of course their separation would continue, he saw no valid objection to this arrangement. Probably his mind had not recovered its full vigour, or he would have discovered many obstacles which he now completely overlooked ; amongst others, the possible opposition of the person most interested. He explained his views one evening to his daughter and Burn thwaite, and was most disagreeably surprised to find that they did not meet with the approbation of either. Nelly flatly refused her consent to them. She said that for the last six years she had usurped a title and position to which she was not entitled \u2014 hitherto unconsciously, and therefore inno cently; but were she to lend herself now to such a fraud upon society, her conscience would"], [190, "182 ON THE BRINK. never again allow her a moment's peace, to say nothing of the perpetual terror in which she must live, lest it should be discovered. Mr. Burnthwaite, on his side, represented the complete dependence on Mr. Marshall into which such a plan would throw every one connected with it. His estimate of that gentleman's character was not a high one. \" Depend upon it,\" he said, \" that when he has extracted from y-ou every shilling y7ou possess, he will throw you over if he sees his advantage in so doing.\" Mr. Halsted did not even attempt to oppose this reasoning. He was silenced, if not convinced, and his only answer was a sigh of bitter disappointment."], [191, "ON THE BRINK. 183 CHAPTER VIII. At length Sir William Claremont returned from a mission which had tried his patience to the utmost. Mr. Graham had been far from meeting the champion of his grandson's rights with the gratitude he deserved. On the first mention of Hugh's name, he had refused to listen to anything concerning the child of sin whom he had cast off, and Sir William had some difficulty in making him comprehend that the object of his visit was to inform him of his daughter's marriage to Lord Tenby, and her son's legitimacy. Even then he only condescended to say that he was glad, for his daughter's sake, that she had not this"], [192, "ON THE BRINK. 184 additional offence to answer for ; but that, when she had set her father's commands at defiance, she had broken the commandments of God, and incurred the penalties denounced against dis obedient children, and neither she nor her posterity could have any part in the kingdom of heaven. He wished the yToung man no harm, but it would ill become him, as a minister of the gospel, to hold out to him the hand of relationship ; for is it not written, \" The sons shall suffer for the sins of the fathers to the third and fourth generation ?\" This was not cant on the part of Mr. Graham, but simply the expression of the sentiments in which he had been brought up, in which he lived, and breathed, and had his being. Sir William, however, did not look upon it in this light. He thought Mr. Graham displayed great want of feeling and hardness of heart \u2014 in which, no doubt, he was right ; but he also accused the reverend gentleman of hypocrisy \u2014 in which he was wrong. Probably there was a little of the odium theologicum mixed up in this. Lady"], [193, "ON TBE BRINK. 185 Margaret Claremont had been very High Church and something more, with an utter detestation of everything that smacked of Calvinism ; and Sir William, who had not much turn for religious controversy himself, had very judi ciously- accepted his wife's opinions. To Mr. Graham's observations he replied with con siderable warmth, \" That the sins of the fathers are visited on the heads of the children, we have striking evidence in the present case. As a child, Hugh suffered much for his father's sins, and would have suffered more, but for the angel who took him under her care, when he was left to die in a hovel by all on whom he had a claim. His poor mother also suffered long and grievously, very possibly for the sins of her father ; but all this has nothing to do with the present question. Hugh Graham is undoubtedly Lord Mortimer, heir to the title and estates of the Earl of Tenby, and eventually of the Duke of Glencoe. Next to his father, who has done his best to deprive him of his inheritance, y-ou are his nearest"], [194, "ON THE BRINK. 186 relative. Will y7ou, as he is still an infant in the ey7es of the law, step forward and see him righted ? We will give you all the assistance in our power.\" M Mr. Graham was so little used to be ad dressed in this independent style, that he did not immediately- find an answer. For nearly forty y-ears he had preserved undisputed ascendancy7, not only7 over the members of his own flock, but over all those with whom he came in contact, laying down the law with an assumption of authority which few- were bold enough to resist. When, however, he did meet with an opponent who was not inclined to submit quietly7 to his despotic sway7, like many others of the same frame of mind, he usually preserved an obstinate silence, pro bably thinking it more dignified to decline the contest altogether than to risk a defeat. On the present occasion this was impossible. He was called upon for a decision, which, what ever line he took, could not fail to be a source of embarrassment. On the one hand, he must"], [195, "ON THE BRINK. 187 abandon the principles which he had main tained without swerving through a long life, and expose himself to the imputation of being influenced by a hope of participating in the worldly advantages of his grandson's altered condition; on the other, he felt that, if he still persisted in refusing a helping hand to that grandson, he would incur the just reproaches of the world at large, and perhaps hereafter those of his own conscience. Influenced by these feelings, he at length said, \" I must have time for reflection. Your proposal involves too many considerations to be lightly accepted or rejected. I must seek for higher guidance than I can find in my own unaided powers.\" \" Be it so,\" Sir William replied. \" My time is limited, but I will remain till to-morrow, when I trust you will be able to give me a decided answer.\" \" In the mean time, Sir William, if you will accept the hospitality of a Scottish manse \u2014 \u2014 \" But Sir William cut him short. He had no"], [196, "188 ON THE BRINK. wish to pass the evening in the society of a man with whom he felt every disposition to quarrel. He thanked Mr. Graham, however, in sufficiently courteous terms, but alleged that he had letters to write which would occupy his time for some hours. The following day Mr. Graham intimated his intention of taking up his grandson's cause, and promised to proceed to London as soon as he could make the necessary arrangements. Sir William gave him his own address, and offered to introduce him to a lawy-er who would undertake the case, and be content to w7ait for the payment of his expenses till Hugh Graham should be established in his rights. But this Mr. Graham declined. He had a legal cousin of his own established in London, and to him he meant to have recourse. Claremont's letters had kept his clients at Ealing fully informed of all his proceedings, but his return was an immense relief to Mr Hal sted. In Burnthwaite's zeal and integrity he had the most perfect confidence, and in any"], [197, "ON THE BRINK. 189 commercial transactions would have placed his interests in his hands without a second thought ; but this was altogether a different matter. It was a case in which the experience of the man of the world would be far more useful than the most accurate acquaintance with the state of the exchanges and the money market. Besides, Burnthwaite had all his life been in a subordinate position, alway-s ready to execute to the best of his ability the wishes of his superior, for whom he had the most pro found respect, but he was not much in the habit of making suggestions of his own. Sir William, on the other hand, was full of decision, with a well-founded reliance on his own judgment, generated by7 his long habits of command. He was one to whom Mr. Halsted felt that he could in all safety7 delegate the authority which his illness made him incapa ble of exercising himself. The conclave were assembled in Mr. Halsted's study on the evening of the day on which Claremont had returned from Scotland."], [198, "190 ON THE BRINK. They all felt that the time had arrived when something definite must be settled, and yet no one knew exactly how to open the debate. It was Nelly who broke silence. \" Now that we know the worst,\" she said, \" what is the first step to be taken ?\" \"I think,\" said Sir William, \"that the opening of the campaign ought to be preceded by a declaration of war. Lord Tenby ought to be informed of the discovery of his crime, and of our intentions. If you all approve of it, I will make the communication to-morrow.\" \" If I had my way,\" said Mr. Halsted, \" the first notice he should have would be a warrant.\" \"Father,\" said Nelly, \"you promised me there should be no prosecution.\" \" I did, though against my own judgment ; but I shall most undoubtedly proceed against him for the sums of money of which he has been robbing you for the last six years.\" \" I wish, father, you would let that go too. Money can do us no good now.\""], [199, "ON THE BBINK. 191 \" In this, Eleanor,\" said Sir William, \" your father is right. To let him keep the fruits of his villany would be an encouragement of it. But to proceed; the next point to be considered regards Hugh Graham. I think, if you have no objection, I will call at the Foreign Office to-morrow, and apply for leave for him to return to England without delay on urgent private business. He himself may- simply be told that you want him, That will insure his compliance.\" \" Ah, that Hugh Graham !\" exclaimed Mr. Halsted. \" I always had a presentiment that sooner or later, Nelly, you would have cause to repent your kindness to that boy; that he would work you harm. He is now Lord Mortimer, and you, his preserver, his guardian angel, what is your fate ?\" He spoke with so much vehemence, and iu such a state of excitement, that they were all alarmed. \"Dearest father,\" said Nelly7, \"my misfortune is not his doing, and I feel certain that he would renounce every advantage for"], [200, "192 ON THE BRINK. himself, could he by so doing restore me to im position.\" And then Sir William struck in. \" Indeed, Mr. Halsted, I do not think you are quite just. The sole cause of all om misery is Lord Tenby ; and whether he had a son or not by Mary Graham, the fact of his marriage would have been the same. Am I not right, Mr. Burn thwaite ?\" \" I confess I agree with y-ou, Sir William ; and, if I may be permitted to say so, I think no one will grieve more sincerely than Mr. Hugh for the misfortune by which he will profit.\" \" Well, well,\" said the old man, querulously, \" you are all against me, and we will say7 no more of my Lord Mortimer. But what are we to do with the villain Marshal], who will be here again in a few days? Have you any thing to say in his favour ?\" \"Well,\" said Claremont, \"as yet we have nothing but presumption against him ; but I must say the presumption is so strong that I"], [201, "ON THE BRINK. 193 do not see how he can clear himself of it. He comes no doubt to make terms for his silence, as I will be bound he has hitherto done with Tenby. He has quarrelled with him after sucking him dry, I suppose, and now comes to drive a bargain with you. Of course it is out of the question for you to see him. Leave him to me and my friend Burnthwaite. We will hear what he has to say, tell him that you and your daughter reject his proposals with horror and contempt, and then kick him ont of the house. My word for it, he will then see what he can make out of old Graham. Luckily he will be a day after the fair.\" After some further discussion the whole of this programme was approved, Mr. Halsted expressing his deep regret that he was not in a state to confront Mr. Marshall himself. Sir William had no occasion to write to Lord Tenby. On his way to Downing Street the next day he met his brother-in-law, who advanced to meet him with extended hand, exclaiming, \" Ah Claremont, I had no idea VOL. III. o"], [202, "194 ON THE BRINK. you were in London. Where do you come from ?\" \"I come from Scotland, my lord, where I have been engaged in obtaining proofs of your marriage with Mary Graham, and in concerting measures with her father for establishing the rights of her son. By- the request of Miss Halsted and her father, I was to have written to you this day to inform you of these facts, as also that they are aware that the late Lady Tenby7 has not been dead above two or three weeks. My lord, y7our infamy and the disgrace you have entailed on your family- must make you an object of loathing and contempt to every right-minded man ; but I so far yield to my regard for your unhappy mother, and for your sister's memory-, as to give you one piece of advice. Leave England at once ; to-morrow it may be too late. You have not much mercy to expect from Mr. Halsted or Mr. Graham, and what your relations may be with Mr. Marshall you know better than I do.\" He walked away, leaving Lord Tenby- half"], [203, "ON THE BBINK. 195 stunned by what he had just heard. More than a fortnight had elapsed since his last con- versation with Marshall, and as during that time no hostile demonstration had been made, he had persuaded himself that Marshall had become convinced of the impolicy of giving publicity to transactions in w-hich he was himself so deeply implicated. Now his guilt was known to those by whom it would be most deeply- resented, and he felt that nothing but flight could save him from the penalties he had incurred. But he had a mind fertile in expedients, and, as soon as he recovered his self-possession, he began to devise means for extricating himself from his difficulties. He went instantly to his lawyer, to whom he explained the position in which he was placed, with as much candour as could reasonably be expected. He dwelt much upon the hardness of his fate in having been linked to a wife who was condemned to a lunatic asylum for life ; he expatiated upon the passionate love he had felt for Eleanor Halsted, and the pernicious"], [204, "196 ON THE BRINK. counsels of Mr. Marshall, both of which had united in driving him to the commission of an offence which he now deeply repented, and for which he intended to make reparation by an immediate offer of marriage to Miss Halsted, and the acknowledgment of Hugh as his lawful son and heir. He concluded by entreating Mr. Lawson to give him his advice as to a friend. Mr. Lawson appeared by his answer to be insensible to the honour of having a peer for his friend. \"My lord,\" he replied, \"I will give you the advice of an attorney- to his client. It is that y-ou lose no time in making your offer to Miss Halsted ; and, as you have brought yourself within reach of the law, you ought to leave London this night. I should recommend your retiring to France, where you will be within twelve hours' postal communica tion with me, and y7ou can request Miss Halsted to send her answer to my address.

I will however undertake to find some attorney in that particular line, in whom you may confide.\" \" Thank you, Lawson ; I will follow your advice in every particular. I will start this evening for Boulogne, where you may direct to me, poste restante. Thank you, once more, and good-bye.\" He held out his hand, but Mr. Lawson did not notice the movement, or at least did not avail himself of it ; and this neglect Lord Tenby felt even more deeply than his brother-in-law's remarks, though they too had cut him to the quick. \" Eveu he,\" he exclaimed, as he left the house, \" even he, an attorney ! Am I then indeed such an object of contempt and abhorrence to all men !\" For the first time in his life he saw himself in his true light : his punishment was beginning. In the mean time his victim was regaining"], [206, "198 ON THE BRINK. her composure. She knew the worst ; she had nothing more to fear, and there was a hope at the bottom of her heart which gave her courage to meet the inevitable ordeal of scandal, or, at the best, of gossip, to which she must be exposed. As soon as Sir William Claremont had taken his departure on the pre ceding evening, and while Mr. Burnthwaite was wrestling himself into his great-coat, Nelly followed the latter gentleman into the hall. \" I have a great favour to ask of you,\" she said. \"Here is Sir Arthur Compton's address, and I wish you to write him an exact account of all that has occurred, omitting no particular, however trivial. Tell him I had not the courage to write myself. Mention my father's illness, and that he is now out of clanger and recovering fast. Will you do this for me ?\" \" Oh, my dear young lady, can you doubt it? This, or anything else; indeed, it oc curred to me that Sir Arthur ought to be informed.\""], [207, "ON THE BRINK. 199 \" Thank y-ou, and please lose no time. The day after to-morrow is post-day.\" This point settled, Nelly's mind was tran quillized, for the present at least. Sir William called after his interview with Lord Tenby, of which he gave an account, and said that he had been unable to see the minister about Hugh's leave, as he was out of town, and not expected back for a couple of days. He intended therefore to run down to Brighton for a day or two, unless Mr. Halsted thought his presence in London desirable. Both Nelly and her father urged him to go, assuring him that there was nothing likely to occur in which his advice or assistance would be required. They felt that they had already taken but too much advantage of his kindness. \" Say nothing of that, I entreat you,\" he said ; \" I have but done my duty. I shall be here in time to meet Mr. Marshall, and then I much fear it will be necessary to inform my poor mother-in-law of what is hanging over her. I cannot allow her to hear it by chance."], [208, "ON THE BRINK. 200 Without some sort of preparation, it would kill her.\" \" And I, too,\" said Nelly, \" have friends to whom I must write, if indeed I may7 still venture to call them so.\" \"Believe me, my dear Eleanor,\" rejoined Sir William, \"to those really deserving the name you will be dearer than ever.\" Not long after Sir William's departure, a letter was brought to Mr. Halsted, while his daughter was out of the room, on which his attention was still riveted when she returned. \" What have you got there, papa ?\" she asked. \" A letter for you inclosed in one to me.\" \" For me ! Ah, from Lord Tenby !\" she ex claimed, flinging the letter down as she recog nized the handwriting. \"Read them both,\" said her father, \" for you alone can give an answer.\" She obeyed. The first was merely a note to Mr. Halsted, to say that Lord Tenby enclosed a letter for his daughter, left open for his perusal."], [209, "ON THE BBINK. 201 That to Nelly herself ran thus : \u2014 \" Eleanor, I will not attempt to excuse or palliate my past conduct. My object in writing now is to make the only reparation in my power, by offering to marry you at the earliest possible time, before late events have transpired. It may be so managed with regard to secrecy, that the public will know nothing of it, aud you will continue, without a question being asked, to fill the station which you have hitherto occupied with so much honour to yourself. I know not what terms to use most likely to obtain a favourable answer to my proposal, but at least I entreat you to believe that it is my most earnest wish to devote the rest of my life to your happiness, and to prove to you the sincerity of my repentance for the wrong I have done you. \" Devotedly yours, \" Tenby. \"P.S.

Address yTour answer to Mr. Lawson's.\" \" Well, Nelly,\" said Mr. Halsted, anxiously, when he saw she had finished. \" What answer do you intend to send ?\" \" What answer ! I shall refuse his offer with the scorn it deserves. An offer which is only made to save him from the consequences of his misconduct.\" \" Nelly, Nelly, reflect, I entreat you, before coming to a decision. I confess, he appears to me to be sincere, and there is no doubt that he has taken the only course he could to atone for the evil he has done. You may still, as he says, be Lady Tenby, without letting the world into the secret of his crime and your misfortune. Or, if the truth should be suspected, no one could condemn you, at all events.\" \"And Arthur, father,\" said Nelly-, \"what would he think of me ? Not but what my de cision would be the same, if no such person"], [211, "ON THE BRINK. 203 were in existence,\" she added hastily, as she noticed the contraction of her father's brows. \" Six years of insult and misery have taught me what I may expect from Lord Tenby ; for how can I believe in a repentance wrung from him by a fear of punishment ! Had I loved him as I ought to have loved the man I consented to marry, what would my fate have been ? My heart would have broken long ago. As it is, he is the object of my aversion and contempt. How could I take such a man for my husband ? No, father ; I have had a bitter lesson, and I will profit by it. In this instance, I must act according to my own judgment.\" \"Ah, yes, my child,\" exclaimed Halsted. \" You trusted to mine once, and it has brought you ruin. Act as you will ; I shall not attempt again to influence you.\" He was greatly excited, and it was some time before his daughter succeeded in calming him. She then sat down to write her answer to Lord Tenby. It was not an easy task, for"], [212, "204 ON THE BRINK. she felt greatly tempted to tell him all she thought of his conduct in the strongest language with which her imagination could supply her. But she refrained ; she contented herself with rejecting his offer in the most explicit terms, with the coldness of contempt oozing out at every word. \"If,\" she said in conclusion, \"you are sincere in your expressions of repentance for the evil you have done, I am not so far your enemy but that I rejoice for your sake. For my own part, I hardly know whether I ought to mourn over my degrada tion, or to welcome it as the means of breaking those bonds which for the last six years have been the bane of my existence. \"Eleanor Halsted. \" P.S. In compliance with your request, we will not write to Lord Mortimer for two days.\" Sir William Claremont returned, bringing with him a pressing invitation from his mother"], [213, "ON THE BRINK. 205 to Nelly and her father to pay her a long visit at Brighton. \"Another proof of your kindness,\" said Nelly. \"Not so, I assure you. As soon as she heard your story, my dear mother proposed it herself.\" At length the morning appointed by Mr. Marshall for the renewal of his visit arrived, and soon after twelve that gentleman made his appearance at Ealing. On inquiring for Mr. Halsted, he was shown into the dining room, in which were seated Mr. Burnthwaite and Sh William. The former gentleman was well acquainted with their visitor, having had frequent opportunities of seeing him at the time of Lord Tenby's marriage, and conse quently on him fell the duty of opening the conversation. \"Mr. Marshall,\" he said, \"Mr. Halsted has had a serious attack of illness, and is still far too unwell to attend to business. He has consequently requested this gentleman, Sir"], [214, "206 OA- THE BRINK. William Claremont, and myself to receive you, and to hear what you have further to say, as he has reason to believe that you have some proposal to make. It is almost needless to add that we are acquainted with every7 par ticular of your former conversation.\" \" What !\" said Marshall. \" Has Mr. Halsted informed you \u2014 \u25a0 \u2014 \" \" He told us,\" said Burnthwaite, interrupting him, \" that you accuse Lord Tenby of bigamy-, by intermarrying with Eleanor Halsted, his former wife being at that time alive. He also put iuto our hands the summary7 you had drawn up of the whole affair, as also the docu ments by which you supported y-our charge. These we have since verified. Sir William took the trouble of going himself to Scotland to ascertain the truth of Lord Tenby's first marriage with Mary- Graham. Will you have the goodness to inform us of the object of your present visit ?\" Mr. Marshall would have much preferred dealing with Mr. Halsted alone ; still, he derived"], [215, "ON THE BRINK. 207 great hopes of success from the presence of Sir Wilh' am Claremont. The general's con nection with the Tenby family seemed to give a guarantee that he would willingly accede to any proposal which would save his brother in-law from exposure. \" I greatly regret Mr. Halsted's dlness,\" he said, in his blandest tones, \" but am perfectly- satisfied with the representatives he has selected. I trust I need not say, that for that gentleman himself and his daughter I feel nothing but sentiments of respect and commiseration, and my most anxious desire is that, by burying Lord Tenby's infamy in oblivion, they may be rescued from the very painful position in which it places them. With regard to Lord Tenby himself my feelings are different. He has treated me in a manner which would justify me in proceeding to any- extremity of vengeance. I refrain, solely from the con sideration that any punishment inflicted upon him must of necessity recoil upon his innocent victim. I have, however, devised a plan which,"], [216, "ON THE BRINK. 208 while giving me the indemnity justly7 my7 clue, will affect him in a point on which he is peculiarly sensitive. To this I limit my revenge.\" \" And that is ?\" asked Burnthwaite. \"Gentlemen,\" said Marshall, \"with men of the world like yourselves, I will come to the point at once. Miss Halsted's position, rank, and even honour, are in my power. If I speak, they are gone for ever ; if I remain silent, no one else can deprive her of them. I have not the least wish to injure her, but I must be paid for my7 forbearance. Mr. Halsted must make over to me the principal which secures Lord Tenby's annuity. His lordship will not refuse his concurrence when he knows that his own safety- depends upon it.\" \" But, Mr. Marshall,\" objected Burnthwaite, \" you forget Hugh Graham, Lord Tenby's heir. What do you propose about him ?\" \"Hugh Graham ! He will remain as he is. Thanks to Miss Halsted, he has had the"], [217, "ON THE BRINK. 209 advantage of an excellent education, and will make his way in the world. He will never know his loss, and if he does he ought not to regret it, when it is for the benefit of one to whom he owes so much.\" \" If that is your opinion, Mr. Marshall,\" said Burnthwaite, \" it is not that of Mr. Halsted or his daughter. They expected some proposal of this nature, and through us they reject it with the indignation it deserves. Miss Halsted has been the victim of an infamous fraud ; she will never make herself an accomplice. In this view Mr. Halsted entirely concurs. I regret that you should have supposed for a single moment that their decision would be other than it is.\" \"I should have thought,\" rejoined Marshall, \"that Mr. Halsted would have shown more care for his daughter's honour.\" Mr. Burnthwaite had conducted the con ference suaviter in modo. Sir William, who had not yet opened his lips, now took it up fortiter in re. \"Miss Halsted's honour,\" he VOL. III. p"], [218, "210 ON THE BRINK. said, \" can never suffer in the opinion of those whose opinion is worth having through the villany of her betrayer or his agent. Con nected as I am with Lord Tenby, this shocking proof of his depravity filled me with horror and dismay, but I derive some consolation from what I have just heard. Till y7ou spoke I thought my brother-in-law the greatest scoundrel with whom I had ever come in contact, but I am now convinced that in that unenviable distinction he is surpassed by his friend Mr. Marshall. As we can have nothing further to say to each other, I request you to leave the house with all possible expedition.\" \" I will do nothing of the sort, Sir William Claremont, if such is your name. I came here with the most friendly intentions, and you insult me in the grossest manner. You say you are speaking in the name of Mr. Halsted. I do not believe you, and I will not stir till I have seen either that gentleman or his daughter.\" \" Mr. Marshall,\" replied Sir William, \" having"], [219, "ON THE BBINK. 211 some idea of the sort of man with whom we should have to deal, we secured the attendance of a policeman. He is probably at this moment dining in the servants' hall, and I should be sorry to disturb him. Still, if you insist upon the formality of a legal expulsion, I will send for him at once.\" \"Very well, Sir Wilbam,\" exclaimed Marshall, \" it is your turn now ; make the most of it. Perhaps some day- it will be mine. At present, I can only reach you through those with whom you are connected, and whose interest you have at heart ; rest assured I will not spare them.\" He left the room and the house, and the two negotiators proceeded to give an account of the interview to those whom it so nearly concerned."], [220, "ON THE BRINK 212 CHAPTER IX. Mr. Maeshall left Ealing in no very amiable frame of mind towards the inmates of the villa, but at that moment he had not leisure to reflect upon the disagreeable truths he had heard, and the ignominious treatment he had received. His mind was occupied with thoughts of a still more engrossing nature. He had failed where he thought himself most certain of success. Well aware that Eleanor's marriage had been principally owing to the ambitious views which Mr. Halsted had entertained for his daughter's aggrandizement, he had felt convinced that the banker would stop at no sacrifice to prevent the utter ruin"], [221, "ON THE BBINK. 213 with which his schemes were now threatened. As for any considerations of honour or principle, he ignored them so completely himself that he could not comprehend their existence in the breast of any practical man. Even now, he was inclined to attribute the failure of his negotiation to any cause but the right one, and rather thought it must be owing to the impossibility of his furnishing any sufficient guarantee for the fulfilment of his part of the contract. However, that was past ; he could drive no bargain with the Halsteds, and if he did not wish to lose all chance of benefit from the revelations he had it in his power to make, it behoved him to be quick in his operations. That very night he started for Scotland, and after a hasty breakfast at Glasgow, departed for the scene of Mr. Graham's spiritual ministrations. It was late in the evening when he arrived, and on calling at the manse received the satisfactory information that Mr. Graham had gone up to London three"], [222, "ON THE BRINK 214 days before, and that the time of his return was uncertain. With a hearty imprecation on his ill luck, Marshall, after ascertaining Mr. Graham's present address, returned to the very indifferent inn at which Sir William Claremont had taken up his abode ten days before. On the following morning he took his departure for Glasgow, and there taking his place in the first train that started, was safely deposited in London at an early hour in the morning, thoroughly done up and out of temper. After a few hours' sleep he set out on foot for the purpose of looking up Mr. Graham. That reverend gentleman was for the present located with his cousin, the lawyer, in Clement's Inn, and this time Marshall had a gleam of good fortune ; he found Mr. Graham at home. During the whole of his walk Mr. Marshall had been endeavouring, though with indifferent success, to concoct a speech by which he might explain the object of his visit, without insisting too strongly- on his own share in the trans-"], [223, "ON THE BRINK. 215 actions which he had to narrate. He was not easily abashed, but when he was ushered into Mr. Graham's presence his confidence did for a moment desert him. He soon recovered himself, however, and when Mr. Graham asked what was the object of his visit, he said, without further preface, \" Circumstances have made me acquainted with facts affecting the position of your grandson, now known as Hugh Graham, but in reality the legitimate son and heir of Lord Tenby, and it is my wish to give you such information as will enable you to secure for him his inheritance.\" \"Indeed!\" said Mr. Graham. \"Will you take a chair and explain yourself more clearly ?\" Thereupon Marshall seated himself, and related the story of Mary Graham's marriage and all the circumstances connected with it, offering to produce all the documents necessary7 for substantiating his assertions. \"But it is right I should mention,\" he continued, \" that in making these revelations I of course lose Lord Tenby's friendship for ever, and forfeit"], [224, "216 ON THE BRINK. all claims to his assistance. Had I consented to conceal his villany I might have made my own terms both with him and Mr. Halsted. As it is I shall be utterly- destitute, and it is but just that I should be indemnified for the sacrifice I am making. Before going further, therefore, I wish to know if your are prepared, on the part of your grandson, to enter into an agreement to pay me a reasonable sum, to be settled hereafter, for my services, as soon as he is restored to his rights.\" \" Permit me to ask you, Mr. Marshall,\" said Graham, \"if what you have now stated, and which you say you can prove, comprises all the information you have to give ?\" \" All ! Why what can you want more ? It will make your grandson Lord Mortimer, and the undoubted heir to the Tenby estates.\" \"No doubt it would do all this,\" rejoined Mr. Graham ; \" but the fact is, we are already in possession of all these details, and conse quently shall not require y-our assistance.\" For a few seconds Mr. Marshall was utterly"], [225, "ON THE BRINK. 217 at fault. \" Have a care, Mr. Graham,\" he said, at length. \" I am the only man in England who can establish your grandson's claims ; and should you reject my services, I can easily make terms with others.\" \" We will take our chance of that, Mr. Marshall. I will even tell you that my cousin, with whom I am now staying, and who is a lawyer, has laid my grandson's case before counsel, who says that he never saw a clearer one in the whole course of his professional career. Besides, we have every reason to believe that Lord Tenby will offer no opposition to the recognition of his sou's legitimacy.\" Marshall waited to hear no more. He rushed to the door, and in another moment was in the street, rage and disappointment con tending in his breast. Hugh Graham acknow ledged by his father ! A good understanding perhaps restored between that father and Eleanor Halsted, to be cemented by a marriage ! In short, his enemies triumphant ! It was not to be borne. If he could not make"], [226, "218 ON THE BRINK. money by denouncing Lord Tenby, at least he could have his revenge. He went straight to Bow Street, and, making a deposition upon oath, applied for a warrant against the Earl of Tenby for bigamy-. The magistrate, however, would only grant a summons upon such an ex parte statement ; and when the attempt was made to serve it, the officer was informed that his lordship had gone abroad in the course of the preceding week, and that all his letters were forwarded to his lawyer. And here, to Mr. Marshall's intense vexation, all active pro ceedings stopped, it not being a case to which treaties of extradition apply. As some con solation for his disappointment, he took care that his application at the police-court should occupy a prominent place in the public papers. While Marshall was thus occupied, Eleanor Halsted had been schooling herself to bear with resignation her altered position. All secrecy with regard to it was at an end. Indeed, one mysteriously worded paragraph had already appeared in one of the daily papers, which"], [227, "ON THE BRINK. 219 evidently had reference to her. At her earnest request, Sir William Claremont, for Mr. Halsted was unequal to the task, assembled the house hold at the villa, and informed them of the infamous deception to which their mistress had fallen a victim. All the upper servants, and some of the others, had been for years in Mr. Halsted's service. They had known Miss Eleanor when she was little more than a child. She had grown up under their eyes ; they were proud of her beauty, her fashion, and popularity. There was hardly one amongst them who was not indebted to her for some act of kindness, rendered still more valuable by the manner in which it was conferred, and the words by which it was accompanied. They felt the injury inflicted on her as one done to them selves, and when Sir William had concluded, the butler, after a short consultation with his fellow-servants, requested him to give their humble duty to her ladyship, with their thanks for the confidence she had shown them, and to assure her that they would endeavour, by an"], [228, "220 ON THE BRINK. increase of attention and respect, to prove that they7 were not unworthy of it. Then came communications from her friends. Old Lady Tenby indeed could not write. Although Sir William had taken the precaution to break the story to her himself, the shock was too much for her. \" It is my death-blow,\" she said. \" Tell that poor, suffering angel, that I entreat her forgiveness for the part I may have had in her misfortune. I would ask her to come to me now, but the sight of her would be too much. I have loved her as a daughter, and I shall die with the same feelings for her in my heart. Thank God, her aunt was spared this blow.\" She lingered a few weeks and died \u2014 of a general break-up of the constitution, the doctors said, and no one thought it worth his while to set them right. Nor did Lady Windermere write ; she came to Ealing herself, although Nelly's letter had found her in Lancashire. Miss Halsted had given strict orders to admit no one, but this"], [229, "ON THE BRINK. 221 time in vain. Lady Windermere burst through all barriers, and flew up to her friend's room. \"Nelly, Nelly!\" she exclaimed, throwing her arms round her, \" surely your orders do not apply7 to me ?\" \" Dearest Cecilia, how could I expect you ? But indeed I am not fit to see any one, not even a friend like you.\" \" What is a friend good for,\" rejoined Lady Windermere, \" if you are to exclude her when you are in distress ? But we will not talk of that now. I have Lord Windermere's positive orders to bring you and Mr. Halsted back with me. We are quite alone, and you can have no excuse, so set about your preparations at once.\" But Nelly was obliged to decline. They had still much business to get through, and could not think of leaving London at present. In short, she gave such good reasons for her refusal, that Lady Windermere, much against her will, was obliged to acknowledge their validity. \"Well, dearest,\" she said, \"you"], [230, "ON THE BRINK. 222 must give me a bed for to-night, and to-morrow I am afraid I must leave y7ou again.\" Nothing could have tended more to restore Eleanor's peace of mind than this visit from one who had been her dearest friend in the days of her prosperity, and whose affection still remained the same, notwithstanding the wide gulf which now yawned betwen them. Long and unreserved was the conversation which ensued. Once Compton's name was mentioned, and Nelly tried in vain to keep down the tell-tale blood that rushed to her face. Lady Windermere could not but notice it. \" Nelly,\" she said, \" tell me truly ; was it military zeal alone that sent Sir Arthur back to India ?\" For a moment Miss Halsted struggled with herself, and then it all came out. It was such a relief to tell the story of her love, her past despair, her present hopes, to one who could understand her feelings and sympathize with them. \" Thank God, dearest,\" said Lady Winder-"], [231, "ON THE BRINK. 223 mere when the story- was finished, \" your future fate is secure. Windermere calls Sir Arthur the Chevalier sans peur et sans reproche.\" \" Oh, but Cecilia, ought I ?\" \" Ought you ! What on earth can you mean ? Do you ask seriously if you ought to make the happiness of a man you love, who loves you, and has given such proofs of it ? who, to save you from the shadow of reproach, sacrificed everything for which he had been struggling, and which he had so well earned !\" \" Yes, I suppose I ought, if he still wishes it ; but will he ?\" \"My dear Nelly, if anything that has occurred could change his feelings, I should despise him as heartily as I now admire him. Surely, y-ou can have no cause to doubt him !\" \" Oh no ; only it is such a comfort to hear my opinion confirmed by yours.\" Lady AYindermere departed ; and then hardly a day passed without Mr. Halsted and his daughter receiving some invitation from their former friends, accompanied by expres-"], [232, "ON THE BRINK. 224 sions of the warmest sympathy. They were unable to accept them ; but it did Nelly good to find that she was not abandoned and deserted by her old associates. By this time Mr. Marshall's proceedings at Bow Street had been duly chronicled, and all the world was now in possession of Lord Tenby's mis deeds. Amongst all classes and in all quarters there was but one feeling of abhor rence for the offender and of pity for his victim ; and in all probability-, if Lord Tenby had made his appearance in any place of public resort, he would have experienced the effects of popular indignation. From this, his absence from London saved him ; but there was more than one amongst Nelly's male acquaintance who vowed that, sooner or later, he should be brought to an account for his villany7. The Comptons and Henry Langley7s were amongst the warmest of Miss Halsted's par tisans; but perhaps a letter received from Mabel O'Hara gave her more pleasure than any other. The writer was still in Ireland,"], [233, "ON THE BBINK. 225 but on the point of returning to England, whence she and her husband intended pro- ceeding without delay on their continental tour, and she urged Nelly and her father to join them. \" It will be such a real pleasure to us,\" she wrote, \" and I am sure you will both be better for a thorough change of scene. We are going to see countries, and not society, and shall be quite content to leave our plans to be settled by you. We mean to wander about Europe till our leave is up, and then to go to India without returning to England; and it would add so much to our happiness to have with us till the last moment one to whom we owe such an immense debt of gratitude. Our first visit on reaching London will, of course, be to you ; and, dearest Nelly, I have a great favour to ask of you. When this sad story- reached us, Myi es swore that he would endea vour to find out Lord T., and compel him to fight a duel with him. I never saw him in a passion before, or heard him use bad words, but I really thought he was going mad. VOL. III. Q"], [234, "226 ON THE BRINK. Do, dearest, if you still love me, try to persuade him to leave that wicked man to the punishment of his own conscience. They say Lord T. is abroad, and I am sometimes so terrified at the thoughts of what might happen if those two met, that I lay awake half the night.\" Yes, Nelly would certainly do her best to divert Captain O'Hara's sanguinary intentions ; but it gave her a feeling of intense pleasure to find so warm a champion in Arthur's friend. The most painful meeting was yet to come. Hugh Graham might now be expected daily ; and much as she longed to see him, Nelly dreaded the effect which the sight of him might have upon her father. As far as bodily7 health was concerned, Mr. Halsted had quite recovered from his late attack ; but his mind was in a state of great irritability7, which some times tried his daughter's patience severely7. He had at no time felt any great liking for Hugh, and now he connected him, though how it would have puzzled him to say-, with the"], [235, "ON THE BRINK. 227 transgressions of the father who had cast him off. He began by7 declaring that Lord Mor timer should never set foot in his house. Nelly did not enter upon any expostulation, but represented that Hugh's being npon good terms with them was of the utmost consequence. That if he were known never to enter the house which had once been his home, the ill natured part of the community- might say that he had reason to believe that his pretended benefactress had been an accomplice in the conspiracy to deprive him of his inheritance. \"The world,\" she said, \"will not know- that it is you who forbid him the house. They will see that he never comes near us, and will draw their own conclusions. It is for you to decide, but it appears to me that at this moment Hugh's friendship and support will be invaluable.\" These, and similar arguments, were at length successful. Mr. Halsted yielded, but not with a good grace. \" Be it so,\" he said. \" I will not oppose you longer, but he comes of a bad"], [236, "228 ON THE BRINK. race, and we shall see that, sooner or later, you will have cause to repent y7our infatua tion.\" Nelly thanked him for the concession, though grieved to the heart by the terms in which it was made, but she could make every allowance for the asperity of his language. She knew that it was occasioned by his love for her, and the bitter feelings of self-reproach, which night and day filled his heart, for the wreck he had made of her happiness, and which all her ingenuous affection was unable to remove. She could only pray that time, the most certain remedy for all our ills, might here also effect a cure. At length the moment, half-dreaded, half desired, arrived. Hugh had received a letter from his father on the same day that brought one from the Foreign Office granting him per mission to return to England. Lord Tenby merely said that an event of an extraordinary nature had occurred, which rendered an inter view between them absolutely necessary in the"], [237, "ON THE BBINK. 229 interest of them both. He begged Hugh to lose no time in coming to him at Boulogne. It was impossible to enter into explanations in a letter ; but he assured him that it was in all sincerity that he signed himself his affectionate father. To say that Hugh was astonished, would be to say little. He was utterly bewildered, and passed the few days of his journey to Boulogne in speculating upon what could have caused this change in his father's sentiments towards him. On arriving, he went straight to the address whieh Lord Tenby7 had given. In a few minutes he was in his father's presence, and very soon after in full possession of all the facts of his mother's history. Lord Tenby had determined to make a clean breast of it, and he did so, but not in any spirit of bravado. \" I have instructed my solicitor, Mr. Lawson,\" he said, in conclusion, \" to take the necessary7 steps for establishing your rights, about which there can be no difficulty. As soon as you arrive in London, see him. If you can, forgive"], [238, "ON THE BRINK. 230 me ; if not, at least think of me as one who is sincerely desirous of repairing the wrong he has clone you.\" \"But, my lord,\" said Hugh, \"I hardly understand all y7ou have told me. You say that y-ou married my mother, and that I am your son and heir. You also say that she is only lately dead. How does this affect Lady Tenby ?\" Lord Tenby was silent, but his silence was as expressive as words. \" Oh, my7 lord,\" said Hugh, rising up, \" for any- wrong you have done me I freely forgive you ; nay more, I thank you from my heart for the tardy7 interest you now show me ; but if you have inflicted injury- upon her, my more than mother, who saved me from death, and to whom I owe all that makes life desirable, expect no forgive ness from me. Even if my lips could frame the words, my heart would reject them with horror.\" \" Hear me, Hugh, before you utterly- con demn me. God is my witness that, when I"], [239, "ON THE BBINK. 231 married Miss Halstead, I looked upon her as my wife, as the Countess of Tenby-, with a settled conviction that she was so to all intents and purposes, as much as if your poor mother had never existed ; for Nature herself seemed to release me from the mockery of a marriage with a woman in her deplorable situation. I firmly believed that nothing could ever arise to shake Eleanor's position, for the secret was known but to one man, who was bound to me by- every tie of gratitude, and whom I had every reason to believe my friend, though he it is who has betrayed me. But I will not attempt to justify myself, further than to say that what I have done for you I wished to do for Eleanor. As soon as this story came to light, I wrote to her, entreating her to allow me to repair the injustice I had done her, by another marriage, and she refused my offer in the coldest and most contemptuous terms. I deserved nothing better, but it was a grievous disappointment, though I cannot yet abandon all hopes of success. I depend upon you and"], [240, "232 ON THE BRINK. y-our influence over her; for do you not agree with me that it would be the best thing for the happiness of us all ?\" \" I do, my lord,\" Hugh replied, after a short pause, \" provided she sees it in the same light, and can bring herself again to trust the man who so cruelly deceived her.\" \" You will do what you can for me, Hugh,\" said Lord Tenby, eagerly ; \" and to prove how sincere I am, y7ou may say that, should she insist upon it, I will consent to a separation the moment the ceremony is concluded. Speak to her father. He hates me, as he has good cause, but in this he will support y-ou.\" \" I will tell them both what has now passed between us, my lord,\" replied Hugh, \" and I will add that, as far as I can judge, the ac ceptance of your proposal seems to me to be most desirable for all parties ; but beyond this it would be great presumption in me to offer any advice.\" For the first time in their lives Lord Tenby and his son parted on something like friendly"], [241, "ON THE BRINK. 233 terms. Hugh lost no time in proceeding on his journey, and on the evening after this interview arrived at Ealing. He would not allow the servant to announce him, but hastened to seek Nelly in her own sitting room. She was writing when he entered, but as soon as she saw who it was, she started up and almost ran to meet him. \" Hugh, Hugh !\" she exclaimed, \" tell me that, though fallen from my high estate, I have lost nothing of your affection and regard.\" \" Oh, mother, best and dearest of mothers, can you doubt me ? Can you doubt that I would have resigned with pleasure every ad vantage of birth and fortune to save you from grief? Though innocent of this' great wrong which has been done you, I almost feel as if my advancement made me an accomplice in it, and that others will think so too.\" \" My dear Hugh, every one must know that the wrong inflicted on you was as great as that of which I was the object. Nobody could dream of blaming you ; but even were it not"], [242, "234 ON THE BRINK. so, we must learn to brave censure when undeserved. But we will not talk of this further now. Tell me all you have been doing.\" They talked on indifferent subjects for some time, and then Hugh asked whether he could see Mr. Halsted. \"My father,\" replied Nelly, \"has been very ill. This blow was too much for him, and though now tolerably7 recovered, you will find him much altered. And, Hugh, if he should be cold in his manner to you, you must for give him. He cannot disconnect you from Lord Tenby.\" \" How can he, when he sees me profiting by the discovery which has destroyed your happiness ? This is exactly what I meant when I said that others might look upon me as an accomplice. Probably- he will consider my visit as an intrusion.\" \" It must be made sooner or later,\" she replied, \"so come with me now. He is at home, I know ; probably in his study.\""], [243, "ON THE BRINK. 235 Nelly entered her father's room, holding Hugh by the hand. \" Papa,\" she said, \" I bring you a visitor, who fears you will visit the sins of the father on the son.\" Mr. Halsted looked up and saw Hugh standing before him. He changed colour, and his excitement was so great that his speech became thick and troubled. \"My Lord Mortimer,\" he stuttered out, rising from his seat, \"I hope I have the pleasure of seeing your lordship well.\" Hugh was so much shocked by the change in Mr. Halsted's appearance and manner, although to some extent prepared for it, that he could only mutter out a few words in reply ; and Mr. Halsted continued : \" You wdl find a great change here since we saw you last, but we are always glad to see an old ac quaintance. Nelly, I hope his lordship will dine with us.\" \" Oh, with pleasure, Mr. Halsted, if you will call me Hugh, as you used to do ; if you will look on me as kindly as when we parted."], [244, "236 ON THE BRINK. God knows I deplore the change of which you speak as sincerely as you can do. Do not make me responsible for the faults of others.\" \" I believe you, my lord. But to call you Hugh would bring back the thoughts of other days, when we were yet happy, when my child, my Nelly, the darling of my heart \" He could not continue, but burst into tears, while his daughter led him to a chair. Hugh was greatly moved by the sight of such emotion in a man whom he used to think cold and hard as the rock of Horeb before Moses smote it with his rod. He actually knelt down and reverently kissed the old man's hand. \" Mr. Halsted,\" he said, \" your daughter knows that I feel for her the affec tion of a son, as well I may. Look upon me in the same light. You will nowhere find one more anxious to show you duty and affection.\" Mr. Halsted was softened. He laid his hand upon Hugh's head. \"God bless you, Hugh."], [245, "ON THE BRINK. 237 Nelly always said you were a good boy, and I believe her. Make this house your home, and be to us what you were in former days.\" Another drop of comfort in poor Nelly's cup."], [246, "238 ON THE BRINK. CHAPTER X. Hugh, as soon as he found himself alone with Mr. Halsted after dinner, told him all that had passed between himself and his father, nor did he fail to set forth all the advantages which he thought Nelly would derive from the ac ceptance of Lord Tenby's offer. To his sur prise he received but little encouragement from Mr. Halsted. \" I once thought as yrou do,\" that gentleman said, \" and urged Nelly to reflect seriously7 before coming to a decision ; but I found her repugnance invincible, and she gave me such reasons for her refusal, that I was satisfied to leave matters as they are. If yrou have promised Lord Tenby7 to speak to"], [247, "ON THE BBINK. 239 her on the subject, you must do so ; but take my advice, and do not press it, if you find her mind made up. It would only agitate her needlessly.\" Hugh did mention to Miss Halsted in her father's presence Lord Tenby's anxiety to repair his crime, as far as was possible, but, as had been predicted, without success. She heard him to au end, and then said, quietly, \"Now, Hugh, you have done your duty to your father, and that being the case, let the subject never again be mentioned between us. Lord Tenby is aware of my decision, and from that nothing will ever tempt me to swerve. I cannot tell you all my- reasons for it, but my father is aware of them, and approves them.\" Mr. Halsted gave a grunt of acquiescence, which was all that his conscience would allow him to do, and he took advantage of a mo mentary silence to change the conversation. \" Hugh,\" he said, \" to-morrow you must call on Mr. Lawson. He told Sir William Clare mont that by Lord Tenby's instructions he has"], [248, "240 ON THE BRINK taken your case out of the hands of Mr. Graham, and I fancy by this time y-our rights are fully established. At all events he will give you every information. Your father seems to be quite in earnest in this, and he has paid all the expenses which Mr. Graham has incurred, even to his journey from Scotland and back. And that reminds me \u2014 y-ou ought to call on Mr. Graham, if he is still in London. Lawson can give you his address.\" \" Call on Mr. Graham, sir !

The next day he had a most satisfactory interview with Mr. Lawson, who hailed him as Lord Mortimer, and informed him that his recognition as Lord"], [249, "OA- THE BBINK. 241 Tenby's son and heir was complete. After this Hugh proceeded to seek out Mr. Graham at Clement's Inn, though not without consider able reluctance, and a slight disturbance of the nervous system. He was even doubtful under what name he ought to present himself, but eventually announced himself as Lord Mor timer. His grandfather, a tall, upright, stern looking old man, advanced to meet him, saying as he did so, \" You are in a great hurry, young man, to assume your title. I fear the vanities of the world have already taken hold of y-ou.\" Hugh coloured at this speech, but the tone in which he was addressed roused his spirit. \" I call myself Lord Mortimer,\" he said, \" because it is the only name to which I have a right, and I certainly thought it the most appropriate one to assume when coming to thank you for your exertions in my behalf.\" \" Exertions which I might have spared myself, it appears. Have you seen Lord Tenby ?\" VOL. III. R"], [250, "242 ON THE BRINK. Hugh told him shortly that he had met his father at Boulogne, who appeared to be desirous to atone for his past conduct \"Yes,\" said Mr. Graham, \"I can quite understand that. He wants to get you into his toils, and it is my duty to prevent it. I intend making an application to the Court of Chancery7 to be appointed your guardian till y-ou are of age. I believe your concurrence will be necessary, but I presume you will offer no objection, and under the circumstances I am told it will be granted as a matter of course.\" \" Pardon me, sir. Lord Tenby having acknowledged me for his son, it seems to me that I owe him the duty of one.\" \" What, has the tempter thrown his spells over you already7 ? Be warned in time, before he delivers you over to destruction, body and soul.\" But Hugh was in no humour to listen to advice thus tendered. If he had no great cause for gratitude towards Lord Tenby, he had quite as little as regarded Mr. Graham. By"], [251, "ON THE BRINK 243 both he had been cast off and abandoned without any fault of his, and might have died in a hovel, but for the providence which threw Nelly in his way. Father and grandfather had been equally culpable, equally indifferent to his fate ; and yet there was something in Lord Tenby which, now that the ice was broken, powerfully- attracted his son towards him, notwithstanding his many crimes and misdemeanours. At all events, as far as Hugh was concerned, he had frankly- confessed his offences, and apparently- was desirous of making up for the past. To a certain extent Mr. Graham was right. Lord Tenby had thrown his spells over his son, who had, like so many others, felt the full charm of his fascinating manner ; nor could Hugh restrain an immense feeling of pity for one so full of talent, and born to every advantage which rank and fortune can confer, now cast off by all, without a single friend on whom he could rely, and with the voice of the whole world raised against him in condemnation."], [252, "244 ON THE BRINK. On the other hand, the grandfather had not uttered a single expression of regret for the past; he had never even alluded to their relationship, but had received him with an austerity and assumption of authority ex- ceedingly distasteful to a diplomatist of the mature age of eighteen, who, during the absence of his chief, had conducted with skill and sagacity7 the affairs of the British nation in their relations with the republic of San Marino. Apart therefore from his desire to give Lord Tenby no further cause of annoy ance, he felt a very- natural dislike to falling under Mr. Graham's tutelage. In reply- to that gentleman's last observation, therefore, he said : \" I am not aware of having fallen under any spells ; but it certainly7 would be a most ungracious act in me to take a step, which Lord Tenby could only- construe as a deliberate insult, more especially as, being in the public service, the guardianship would be a mere formality. But even were I inclined to consent to such an application,"], [253, "ON THE BRINK. 245 there are others whom I should feel bound to consult.\" \" And who may they be, whose advice you prefer to mine ?\" \" Mr. Halsted and his daughter, to whom I owe everything.\" From the commencement of their interview Mr. Graham had found considerable difficulty in restraining his wrath at Hugh's inde pendence of speech and manner, but now it burst out into a storm of indignation. Sir William Claremont, from motives of deli cacy to Nelly, had not thought it necessary to mention to him the date of his daughter's death, but when once his cousin began to make inquiries, he soon learnt the state of the case. Perhaps, with his ideas of patriarchal authority, he felt no remorse for his conduct to his daughter or her offspring \u2014 he certainly manifested none \u2014 but this seemed only to make him more severe in judging the conduct of others towards her. Amongst other freaks of imagination, he chose to assume that Miss"], [254, "246 ON THE BRINK. Halsted was cognizant of the existence of a Countess of Tenby at the time of her own marriage, and that she and her father were accomplices in an act of bigamy. \" What,\" he exclaimed, when Hugh mentioned their names, \"do you dare to allude to the shameless harlot who for so many years usurped your mother's place ? who only adopted you lest, if you fell into the hands of others, your story and her infamy should become known !\" Lord Mortimer had no hereditary claim, either on the father's or the mother's side, to the virtues of patience and forbearance, and what he might have acquired by education was quite unequal to the occasion. On hearing this foul accusation against the object of his almost idolatry, the being he most loved and honoured upon earth, he fairly- trembled with passion, which he did not make an attempt to control. \" And you, sir,\" he cried, \" how dare you use such an expression when speak ing of the innocent victim of an infamous conspiracy ! You, whose harsh and unforgiving"], [255, "ON THE BBINK. 247 treatment of your daughter was the cause of all this misery. You, who left me to die on a dunghill, and where I might have died, but for her whom you so falsely accuse. And as for her taking charge of me to prevent my- story being known, did she not appeal to you on my behalf as soon as she knew who I was ? and did you not in the most unfeeling terms write back that there could be nothing in common between you and the child of sin ? Ah, sir ; I know not what are the doctrines you preach, but if they are in accordance with your practice, they cannot have much of Christian charity to recommend them.\" Mr. Graham was so much astounded by this outbreak, that for a few moments he found nothing to reply. Truth to say, he was cowed by his grandson's vehemence. \" If you wish to prove to me,\" he said, at length, \"how utterly unfit the woman into whose hands you fell was for the task she undertook, you have succeeded. You set at naught the common respect to which my age, my sacred calling,"], [256, "ON THE BRINK. 248 and our near relationship entitle me. But I shall not condescend to argue with you. Make y7our choice between me and them. Accept me as y7our guardian, and return with me to Scotland this evening, or never expect to see my face again.\" \" My choice is made,\" Hugh replied. \" I will not abandon the friend, the mother, raised up for me by7 heaven when I was cast off by all those on whom I had a claim.\" \" Be it so,\" said Mr. Graham. \" From wrhat I have seen of y7ou I do not think I shall have much cause to regret your decision.\" \" And yet, sir,\" Hugh rejoined, \" I should be sorry7 to part in enmity from the only7 relation I have on my7 mother's side. If I addressed y-ou with unjustifiable warmth, pardon me, and make some allowance for my very natural irritation at the unfounded accusations which placed the woman to' whom all my veneration is clue on a level with the lowest of her sex. And accept my heart-felt thanks for your recent efforts in my favour.\""], [257, "ON THE BRINK. 249 \"Keep your fair phrases, young man, for those who may value them. For me, I prefer a grain of honesty- to all the fine speeches which ever were made. I wish you no ill, but I trust we shall never meet again. It was said by Him whose servant I am, ' Those who are not for me, are against me !' I would not willingly look upon you as my enemy, but you throw in your lot with those who are. There can be nothing in common between us. Go.\" Mr. Graham's wish was fulfilled. They never did meet again. At a later period Hugh offered him an annuity of five hundred pounds a year, which was refused in very ungracious terms. Mr. Graham never again left the Highlands; he lived to a great age, respected, if not beloved, and died at length, enjoying the good opinion of his neighbours as well as his own. Round his neck, fastened by a ribbon, was found a locket with M. G. engraved on it, and containing a lock of golden hair. It was thought to be his daughter's."], [258, "250 ON THE BRINK. When Hugh returned to Ealing he was naturally questioned as to what he had been doing. His account of his interview with Mr. Lawson was diffuse in the extreme, but when it came to Mr. Graham's turn, he merely said that they had quarrelled on the subject of his grandfather's wish to be appointed his guardian, that their parting had been a cold one, and that in all probability it was their last meeting. It was clear from Hugh's manner that there was something behind, but neither Mr. Halsted nor his daughter pressed him for an explanation which it was evident he had no wish to give. Nelly soon began to count the days and even the hours which must elapse before she could hope to hear from Compton in reply to Mr. Burnthwaite's dispatch, and with each succeeding clay her agitation increased. She kept repeating to herself that she did not feel a doubt of his constancy ; that if ever love and chivalrous devotion existed in the heart of man it was to be found in his ; but still at"], [259, "ON THE BBINK. 251 times something like a sense of insecurity took possession of her. Already she had heard from him in answer to the letter announcing Auntie's death, and certainly in that there was no -diminution of interest or affection. But that letter was addressed to the Countess of Tenby-, and now she was \u2014 What? In one particular it was of use to her, as it enabled her to calculate to a nicety the day on which she might expect to hear again. It wanted a week of that time when her father one morning came into her room with a slip of paper in his hand, and a smile on his face, the first that had appeared there for many a long day. \" Nelly,\" he said, \" I have just received this telegram ; but as it seems to concern you more than me I have brought it to the right owner.\" She stretched out her hand for it, and just read, \" Arthur Compton to William Halsted,\" when a faintness came over her, which pre vented her continuing. \"Read it to me, father,\" she said ; \" I cannot make it out.\" He complied, and read as follows. \"B.'s"], [260, "ON THE BRINK. 252 most distressing letter just received. Tell N. there is not the slightest change since- we last met. I am writing by this mail, but send this to be telegraphed from Alexandria. As soon as my arrangements are completed I shall return to England.\" \" Well, Nelly7, what do you say now ?\" asked Mr. Halsted, from whom his daughter had not quite succeeded in concealing her anxiety. \" Is there anything more, or is that all ?\" \" All ! Why, it is the longest telegram I ever received, and, I may add, the most to the purpose.\" \" Yes, yes, it is. But give it me, that I may read it myself. Oh father, you do not know from what an agony of mind it has relieved me.\" Mr. Halsted was in high spirits. Perhaps, when Lord Tenby made his last offer, he would have been better pleased had no such person as Sir Arthur Compton been in existence ; but he knew his daughter's determination, and he had not much difficulty7 in reconciling himself"], [261, "ON THE BRINK. 253 to the idea of having for a son-in-law a man so distinguished and so universally well-spoken of as Sir Arthur Compton, a man too for whom he himself entertained no common feelings of friendship and regard. Unconsciously, perhaps, his daughter's tremors had a little affected him, for it was with an exuberance of joy that he had hailed the advent of the telegram. He felt inclined to be jocose, and, when his daughter alluded to the sensation of relief she ex perienced, he exclaimed, \" Et moi done ! For if your knight had proved disloy-al, I must have called him out ; and what chance should I have had against a man trained to the use of arms from his youth up ?\" Hugh, who had resigned his diplomatic office, was to depart on the following day to pay a short visit to his father at Boulogne ; and Nelly could not refrain from making him a participator in her happiness, to the extent of telling him that Sir Arthur Compton would probably be in England before very long. This piece of information Hugh, in the"], [262, "254 ON THE BRINK. innocence of his heart, communicated to Lord Tenby, who did not receive it with much satis faction. \" Compton ! \" he exclaimed. \" What brings him back just now ?\" Hugh could not tell, but thought it probable he was coming back to finish his leave, which he had sacrificed when he thought his services might be required in India. Lord Tenby made no reply-. For the first time a suspicion of the truth dawned upon him, and a very uncomfortable feeling of jealousy took possession of him. In due time Compton's letter arrived, and if a doubt had remained on Nelly-'s mind, it must have now been completely removed. \" My Nelly, my own Nelly, for such I trust I may now venture to call you,\" was the satisfactory exordium. It was rather a voluminous dispatch, extending over ten closely written pages, and, as is usual in such cases, contained little besides the most passionate expressions of love and devotion, the same ideas being; re peated over and over again, with a uniformity7"], [263, "ON THE BRINK. 255 of language which would have been inex pressibly wearisome to any one but the person to whom they were addressed. Nelly however was so far from finding fault with it that she read it over several times, and probably before she went to bed that night could have said it by heart, without missing or changing a word. Mr. Halsted was favoured with a sentence picked out here and there with extreme cir cumspection, and he did not press for more. He was quite satisfied with the general effect produced. The most important part of the letter was that in which Sir Arthur announced his inten tion to leave Bombay by the next steamer. \" I believe,\" he said, \" I shall have no difficulty about my leave. Dear old Roden says he feels under such obligations to me, for my coming out to him in his hour of need, that he will undertake to procure it for me. I hope, dearest, you will blush on reading this, as I did on hearing it. But, however, hap what may, I return with the next mail, even if I have"], [264, "ON THE BRINK. 256 to resign my- commission, which I shall have to do sooner or later, I suppose. Do not, therefore, write to me any more out here, but a line addressed to me at Malta will be most gratefully- received.\" Sir Arthur got his leave, and found some thing more than a line waiting for him at Malta. Landing at Marseilles, he made his way to Boulogne without let or hindrance. A steamer was on the point of starting, and he was hurrying down to the quay, when he was accosted by the last man he wished to meet. \" Sir Arthur,\" said Lord Tenby-, \" I wish to speak a few words to y7ou.\" \" You !\" exclaimed Compton. \" You ! Do you think any7 honest man would so far degrade himself as to listen to you for a moment? Stand back, my lord, and let me pass.\" The unhappy man shrank back as if he had received a blow. He slunk off amidst the crowd, and Compton in another minute stood on the deck of the steamer, which in somewhat"], [265, "ON THE BBINK. 257 less than two hours deposited him safely at Folkstone. Mr. Halsted and Nelly were lingering over their dessert in somewhat moody silence, 01: the part of the lady at least. \" Is it not odd. papa, that there is no news of Arthur?\" she said, at length. \" The arrival of the Bombay mail was telegraphed from Malta some days ago. Surely7 he would have sent one line to say7 we might expect him. He must know how anxious we are.\" \"Why should he?\" said some one, who, quietly opening the door, had entered the room unperceived. \" Why should he telegraph what. he has come to say himself?\" Miss Halsted turned deadly pale, and sank back in her chair. Of course her first words were those of reproof. \" Arthur ! Oh, how cruel to take us by surprise !\" In a moment he was kneeling by her side, and took possession of an unprotected hand. He almost feared she was going to faint, but that was a practice to which she was not vol. in. s"], [266, "ON THE BBINK. 258 addicted. \"Oh, my love!\" he said, \"it was cruel, it was thoughtless. I only considered my own gratification. Can you forgive me my selfishness ?\" The look she cast on him was not one of inexorable displeasure; but before she could reply, Mr. Halsted said, \"Nelly, as that gentleman appears to be an acquaintance of yours, perhaps you will do me the favour of introducing me to him.\" \"Oh, Mr. Halsted,\" exclaimed Compton, springing up and going towards him, \" pardon my seeming rudeness, but my first duty was to her.\" \" God bless you, Arthur, my- son. Nelly, you had better order the candles to be lighted in my7 study7. I am going to pay7 poor Burn thwaite a visit, who has been laid up with lumbago these two days, and if Sir Arthur were disposed to do the proper thing, he would accompany me.\" \"Not to-night, Mr. Halsted,\" said Compton, laughing. \" I have no wish to be accused a"], [267, "ON THE BBINK 259 second time of cruelty for taking any one by7 surprise. But give him my kind regards, and assure him I will call on him to-morrow.\" \" Very well ; I will give him your message. I conclude I shall find you here on my return, and I hope Nelly will take proper care of you in the mean time.\" When the lovers found themselves alone, for some time they were too much absorbed by the happiness of the present moment to have thoughts for anything else; but when these first transports had a little subsided, Nelly thought it incumbent upon her to give some account of the events which had effected such a change in her destiny. The first words, how ever, had hardly- fallen from her lips, when Compton stopped her. \"My love,\" he said, \"do not let us revert to what is past, and which I am certain you cannot even allude to without pain. From Mr. Burnthwaite's very clear account I know all that it is necessary for me to know ; indeed I doubt if you can have much to add to it. Perhaps at some"], [268, "260 ON THE BRINK. future time, when you have given me the privilege of a husband to console you, you may find a sort of melancholy pleasure in looking back to past sufferings, but now they7 are of too recent a date. Besides, at present we have much more pleasing occupation, to me at least, before us. We have our future plans to settle, and in that the principal part of the work will fall upon you.\" These plans were not so easy of adjustment ; a considerable difference of opinion existed between the high contracting parties. Compton was anxious for an immediate union, and the arguments by which he supported his opinion were not deficient in ingenuity7. He repre sented in forcible language, though with the utmost delicacy, the very embarrassing position in which Miss Halsted was placed, since she had been obliged to lay aside the name by which she had been so long known. He urged the necessity of her giving herself a protector, under whose auspices she could emerge from her forced retirement, and again enter that"], [269, "ON THE BRINK 261 world in which for years she had played a prominent part. \" I am convinced,\" he said, \" that no one who knows you, or who has even heard of y-ou, would ever say a word in your disparagement ; but that is not enough. God knows, I have no love for the vanities of the world myself, and had you continued the solitary life of your childhood at Longwater, I should be the last to wish you to change it for one of glitter and frivolity. But as things now are, I think it most desirable that, for a few months at least, you should resume the place in society you once held. And the sooner the better, before you are forgotten. You cannot, or rather will not, do it as Miss Halsted, but you can and ought to do it as Lady- Compton. I will not speak of my own selfish wishes, because I wish you to be convinced that I have only your interest in view.\" \" Of that I am quite sure,\" Nelly replied ; but there her acquiescence stopped. She saw plainly enough that so hasty a marriage would but too surely denote a foregone conclusion,"], [270, "262 ON THE BRINK. and that her best friends would see in it a proof that, while still bearing the title of Lady Tenby, her friendship for Sir Arthur had not been of the innocent nature which she wished the world to suppose. This she could not bring herself to avow to Compton. She took the course of throwing herself upon his mercy-. \" Arthur,\" she said, \" I am yours to deal with as you will. How can so degraded a creature as I am reject the wishes of one who has raised me from the abyss into which I had fallen ? If you insist, I must yield, but in so doing I shall lose for ever the last vestige of self-respect. Will y-ou refuse me the year's delay7 which would have been mine had I lost a husband by death ?\" \" Nelly, Nelly !\" exclaimed Compton, \" do you indeed think it necessary to appeal to me in such terms! How shall I convince y7ou that your happiness is the principal, the sole object of my thoughts ? In this, as in every thing else, be it as y-ou will.\" AVhen Mr. Halsted returned he was informed"], [271, "ON THE BRINK. 263 of this particular topic of their conversation, and either was, or affected to be, indignant at Compton's proposal. \" Had Nelly,\" he said, \"been weak enough to consent to such an outrageous violation of all decorum, she must have found some one else to give her away. The coolness of lovers in these days is something astounding.\" \" Oh, papa, Arthur gave it up the instant he found I was averse to it.\" \" Lucky for him, I can tell him.\""], [272, "ON THE BRINK. 264 CHAPTER XL Compton had taken an apartment in his old hotel in Jermyn Street, where, on the morning after his visit to Ealing, he was occupied in writing a letter to his cousin, Sir Philip, when the waiter announced a gentleman who wished to see him ; and in another minute Lord Tenby stood before him. \" What is the meaning of this intrusion, my lord ?\" Compton exclaimed. \" I thought I had told you at Boulogne in sufficiently plain terms that I would have nothing to say to you.\" \" Sir Arthur,\" replied Lord Tenby, \" listen to me patiently for one minute ; it will be better for us both. I have only one question"], [273, "ON THE BRINK. 265 to ask. Are you come back to England to marry Eleanor Halsted ?\" \"I insist upon your leaving my room instantly, my lord,\" said Compton, rising from his chair. \" I refuse to answer that, or any7 other question you may put to me. I refuse positively to hold any communication with you, and if you do not depart at once, I will ring for the waiters to turn you out.\" \"No, Sir Arthur,\" replied Lord Tenby, in great and increasing agitation, \" all the waiters in the world shall not make me stir from hence till you give me your word of honour that you will not many my wife ; for my wife she is in the eyes of God. It is a promise I have a right to exact, and unless you give it me,\" he continued, drawing a revolver from his pocket, \" you shall not leave this room alive.\" There was no mistaking the insanity which gleamed from his eyes, and Compton, com prehending all his danger, threw himself upon him and endeavoured to wrest the pistol from him.

He then rang the bell violently, and in a moment his own servant and several other persons \u2014 for the report of the pistol had been heard downstairs \u2014 entered the room. \" Lord Tenby is seriously injured by a pistol-shot,\" said Sir Arthur; \"send instantly7 for a surgeon.\" \" Mr. M. has this moment left the hotel ; I will run after him and bring him back,\" said a waiter ; and in less than ten minutes one of our most eminent surgeons made his appearance. The room was cleared of all but Compton, his servant, and the master of the hotel. Lord Tenby, who was in a state of insensibility7, was undressed, and Mr. M. began his examination,"], [275, "ON THE BBINK 267 which did not occupy- many minutes. \" How did this happen ?\" he asked, in a very serious tone. \" Lord Tenby threatened to take my- life with this pistol,\" Compton replied, \" and in the attempt to disarm him it went off. But what of the wound ?\" \" May I ask your name, sir ?\" said Mr. M. Compton told him. \" Sir Arthur,\" he continued, \" the wound is mortal. The ball has penetrated the intestines, and it would only be putting him to useless pain to attempt to extract it. He will probably live two or three days. In about eight and forty hours mortification will set in, and then in a few hours all will be over. But it is most essential for your justification that he should make his deposition before a magistrate.

He may7 be expected very shortly-.\" \" I understand you ; my- dying deposition. But, Mr. M., how long have I yet to live ? I have so much to do. Is it a week ? I will pay thousands for a week.\" \" Oh, my lord,\" said Mr. M., \" you must not talk of dying. While there is life there is hope.\" \" Compton, Compton!\" exclaimed Lord Tenby, \" you have no reason to love me, but you will not treat me as a child.

Then indeed I have no time to lose.\" At that moment the magistrate was an nounced, and after a few preliminaries Lord Tenby- deposed as follows : \" I called on Sir Arthur Compton this morning, with the inten tion of exacting from him a promise, which I am now convinced I had no right to demand, and which he very naturally refused. I drew out a revolver, for the purpose of intimidating him, and threatened to take his life if he per sisted in his refusal. He threw himself upon me at once, and in the struggle the pistol was discharged. But it was still in my hand, and I alone am to blame for the consequences.\" As soon as this deposition had beeu read over to Lord Tenby and signed by him, he"], [278, "270 ON THE BRINK. said, \" Compton, I do not know, I cannot tell, if I really- meant to injure you. If I did, for- give me.\" \" Oh, my dear lord !\" rejoined Sir Arthur, \" you can need no forgiveness from me, for I am convinced you had no deliberate intention to harm me. God knows no one can deplore this most unhappy accident more sincerely than I do.\" He took Lord Tenby's hand and pressed it, and as he did so let fall a tear. \" Is this for me ? I did not think there was a being in the whole world who would shed a tear for me.\" By this time they were alone. \" Compton,\" he continued, \" I have no one here to apply to for assistance but your self. I did not even bring a servant with me. Can you give me up a few hours ?\" \" Tell me all you wish done ; I am quite at your service.\" \" First, I wish to see Hugh and Claremont. Will you find out where they are and send for them, as well as for Lawson, my solicitor. And if you think there are any others who"], [279, "ON THE BBINK. 271 ought to be informed of what has happened, I leave it to your judgment to do so.\" \" I understand, and will do what you wish.

I shall go at once, that I may be back the sooner.\" \" God bless you, dear Compton. It is such a comfort to me to feel that I am in your hands.\" Sir Arthur had heard the preceding evening that Sir William Claremont was at Brighton, with Hugh for his guest. He proceeded in the direction of the nearest telegraph office, to send off a summons to them at once, when, on turn ing into Regent Street, the first person he met"], [280, "ON THE BRINK. 272 was Sir William himself. After the first ex clamations of surprise at this fortunate chance, Compton related to him as shortly as possible the events of the morning. Sir William was greatly shocked. Great as was his detestation of his brother-in-law's conduct, there was a lingering regard for him at the bottom of his heart, which now made itself felt. \"Poor fellow ! poor Tenby !\" he said. \" So this is the end ! How fortunate I was obliged to come up on some business at the Horse Guards to-day. I will go to him at once. Hugh is at my house in Brighton. Telegraph for him, and add a word to say that I shall not return for some days.\" \" And stay with him till I come,\" rejoined Compton. The dispatch was forwarded to Brighton, and then Sir Arthur went in search of Mr. Halsted. Fortunately it was board- day, and he was certain to be at his bank. Mr. Halsted's surprise was at least equal to Sir William Claremont's, and his sorrow was expressed in"], [281, "ON THE BBINK. 273 very7 decent terms. Sorrow he certainly did feel ; but it is a question how much of it might be attributed to his regrets that Nelly had not accepted Lord Tenby's proposals, which, as it turned out, would have only presented a tem porary barrier to her union with Compton. Very absently he undertook to break the news to his daughter, and it was not till he had nearly reached Ealing that he recollected that, if Nelly were now Lord Tenby's wife, no col lision would have taken place between the rivals. On Compton's return to his hotel he found Claremont in close conference with Lord Tenby. The latter was the first to address him. \" Compton,\" he said, \" during your absence I have been writing a letter to Eleanor, which I wish Claremont to deliver to her. But I want you to read it first, and tell me what your advice to her will be.

It is a case in which her own feelings must decide ; or, if she want advice, she has her father and Sir William to apply to, and two more competent councillors she could not have.\" \" Then you will not oppose my application,\" said Lord Tenby. \" Neither oppose it, nor promote it. And to prove my sincerity, I also will write a note to Miss Halsted, which I will read to y-ou, and which Sir William will have the goodness to give her at the same time with yours.\" He wrote a few lines, which he gave Sir William to read out. They were as follows : \u2014 \" Dearest Nelly, \"I am acquainted with the contents of the letter which Sir William Claremont will deliver to you from Lord Tenby. I have said that I will not seek to influence you one way or the other. The decision must come from"], [283, "ON THE BBINK. 275 yourself alone ; but of this rest assured, what ever that decision may be, it will meet with my approbation, and whatever you may do in my eyes will be well done. \" Ever affectionately yours, \" Arthur Compton. \" Nothing can be fairer,\" said Sir William. \" Do not you think so, Tenby ?\" \" Quite so. Compton, tell me truly, are you and Eleanor engaged ?\" \" We are.\" \"I was sure of it, as indeed the terms of my letter to her indicate.\" A sigh escaped him as he said it, but after a short pause, he added, \" May God bless you both, and make you as happy as you deserve !\" Mr. M. paid his second visit, and did what he could to alleviate the intense pain which his patient was suffering, but there was not much to be done. No murmur or exclamation of impatience, however, escaped the sufferer, though h e could not always stifle a groan. As"], [284, "276 ON THE BRINK. the paroxysms passed, he resumed his cheerful ness, and when he found himself alone with Compton his conversation showed much of his former animation. It rolled, however, princi pally upon trifling, not to say frivolous topics, till Compton endeavoured to give it a more serious turn, one more befitting a man who stood on the brink of eternity. \"Not y7et,\" said Lord Tenby, \" not yet, dear friend. Do not think me hardened, or unconscious of my7 awful condition, but I cannot turn my thoughts to heaven till I have Eleanor's answer. Ah, if she refuses my last request, I shall feel lost indeed.\" In the mean time, Sir William Claremont proceeded on his mission to Ealing. Orders had been given to refuse all visitors, but on his sending in his name he was admitted at once. He found Miss Halsted in the deepest distress. She had shed tears of genuine and unfeigned sorrow when her father told her of what had occurred, for though she had never felt love for Lord Tenby, she could not forget"], [285, "OA7 THE BRINK. 277 the time when he enjoyed her friendship aud regard, when she had looked upon her union with him as the precursor of domestic hap piness. Her father was with her when Sir William entered. \" How is Lord Tenby ? for I am sure you come from him,\" was her first question. \" I do. I come from a very unhappy man, and am the bearer of the last communication you will ever receive from him. I may men tion that I am acquainted with its purport, and entreat you, as you value your own peace of mind, to give it your most serious considera tion.\" She took Lord Tenby's letter without saying a word, but evidently in a state of the most painful emotion. \" Eleanor,\" it began, \" I am dying \u2014 dying overwhelmed with sin ; but of all the offences of which I have been guilty, that of which you were the victim is the one which weighs most heavily on my conscience, the one which"], [286, "278 ON THE BRINK. seems to deprive me of all hopes of pardon. Eleanor, I entreat you by all your hopes here and hereafter, give me even at this last moment the opportunity of atoning for my crime, as far as I am able, by making you my wife. Can you reject my7 prayer at such a moment ! Can you refuse to postpone your own happiness for a few weeks or clays, to soothe the last moments of a dying man, who bitterly repents the injury he inflicted on you, when y-our refusal may endanger the salvation of an immortal soul ! \" Tenby.\" \" Oh, my God, direct me !\" she exclaimed, when she had finished, and giving the letter to Mr. Halsted, \" direct me in my decision, for I know not what I ought to do. Oh, if Arthur were but here !\" \" My dear Eleanor,\" said Claremont, \" he could not assist you. Tenby showed him his letter, and Compton has written you a few fines, which he sends you byr me.\""], [287, "ON THE BBINK. 279 She snatched the note, rather than took it, out of Sir William's hands. \" He, too, refuses to advise me,\" she cried, when she had read it through. \" Will no one assist me ? Father ! Sir William ! will y-ou not tell me how I ought to act ?\" \" My child,\" said Air. Halsted, \" I have no right to advise. Compton says truly that in such a case the decision ought to be left to your own feelings. And yet, if you really wish for my opinion, I should say that you ought to comply. I think it is your duty to do so. Not duty to Lord Tenby, for you owe him none, but duty to God and to yourself ; and believe me, if you refuse, the time will come when you will bitterly repent it.\" \" And as you appeal to me, Eleanor,\" said Sir William, \" I must confess that I agree with your father entirely. And I will add another reason for your compliance, though it is a delicate subject to touch upon. I know how you are situated with regard to Compton. Tenby asked him point-blank if you were"], [288, "280 ON THE BRINK. engaged, and he frankly acknowledged that you are. Now Arthur himself is above all such considerations, but very possibly some of his connections may think that it will look better iu the eyes of the w7orld if he marry the Countess of Tenby rather than Miss Halsted.\" \" Thank you \u2014 thank you both. I asked your advice, and I will follow it. Sir William, you may tell Lord Tenby I am ready to marry him.\" \" And, my dear Eleanor,\" resumed Sir William, \" in Lord Tenby7's state there is no time to be lost. We must procure a special license, and get it over as soon as possible. Will y7ou allow me to propose twelve o'clock to-morrow ?\" \"Yes, yes, anything you please. But oh, my God !\" she exclaimed, bursting into tears, \"how horrible to think that I only consent to marry him because I know that he is on the point of death !\" \" My dear Eleanor,\" Sir William replied,"], [289, "ON THE BRINK. 281 \" you marry him to give him the only conso lation he is capable of receiving, to enable him to prove his repentance by- the only means in his power. Believe me, it is a holy deed in the eyes of God as in those of man.\" \" Yes, I know you may put it iu that way. But still \" It was nearly six o'clock before Sir William got back to the hotel. After briefly narrating his success, he again started for Lambeth in quest of a license. It was after hours, but Lord Tenby's affairs were a matter of public notoriety, and in consideration of the urgency of the case the precious document was deli vered, but the ambassador's labours were not ended. On his return to Jermyn Street, he found not only Compton, but Hugh, who had just arrived, and Air. Lawson, the attorney. \" All right, my dear fellow,\" he exclaimed, on entering the room, \" I have the license in my pocket.\" \" All wrong,\" groaned out Lord Tenby, who was only just recovering from a terrible"], [290, "282 ON THE BRINK. paroxysm of pain ; \" all wrong. Lawson has just brought me letters from the factor of my poor uncle, the Duke of Glencoe, and his Edinburgh agent, announcing his death two days ago. As I inherit the title, the license must be made out for me accordingly. Will it be possible to get it altered ?\" \" Give me the letters, and I will see about it immediately,\" said Claremont, preparing to leave the room. \" Dear William,\" said his brother-in-law, \" what trouble I give vou.\" Sir William's second negotiation wras as successful as his first. The Lambeth func tionary- was civil and obliging. \" By good rights,\" he said, \" I ought to charge y-ou a second fee, Sir William.\" \"Of course you ought, but you must take my7 cheque for it. My money is exhausted.\" \" Nonsense, Sir AVilliam, I was only joking. We are not all wolves in sheep's clothing.\" During the intervals of ease which he en joyed, Lord Tenby devoted himself to settling,"], [291, "ON THE BRINK 283 as well as circumstances allowed, the various matters of business which pressed upou his mind. His greatest anxiety was to secure the repay-ment of the money- which, under the name of an allowance, he had obtained from Air. Halsted. Lawson told him that that gentleman's solicitors had accepted the terms proposed. The sum was fixed at thirty-five thousand pounds, to be paid by instalments. \" And, my lord,\" continued the lawyer, \" if your grace persevered in living as economically as you have done for the last year, we should have cleared it off in three years.\" \" And now ? But do not ' grace ' me ; it seems like mockery. Let me die Lord Tenby.\" \" Well, my lord, it is a very difficult ques tion to answer. All your unentailed English property was made over to Mr. Halsted and others for the payment of your encumbrances aud for other purposes. I presume that deed might now be set aside, but not without going to the Court of Chancery, and entering upon"], [292, "284 ON THE BRINK particulars which are better avoided. Of yonr Scotch property you are only tenant for life, and all charges upon that die with you. Lord Mortimer, indeed, when he comes of age, can do what he pleases. He is the last in the entail.\" \" Hugh,\" said Lord Tenby, \" this is Eleanor's money, which I obtained from Mr. Halsted under false \" \" Oh, my lord, trust to me. I will do honour to your engagements to the uttermost farthing of which I may become possessed.\" \" God bless you, Hugh ; but, with the ex ception of this, I am tolerably free from em barrassment ; at least I believe my affairs are coming round. Have you any idea, Lawson, of the amount of my present liabilities. I do not wish to begin, or rather to end, by ruining my son.\" \" Your lordship need be under no apprehen sion on that score. The debts you contracted before your marriage with Miss Halsted will be paid off, or nearly so, by the time Lord"], [293, "ON THE BRINK 285 Alortimer attains his majority, and then the English estates will be free and unencumbered. The money you have raised since has been all by way of annuity, and will be covered by the insurances on your life ; so that with the ex ception of your debt to Mr. Halsted, I should say the money we have in hand will cover all the rest. Besides, there is now the Glencoe property. The late duke was not rich for a man of his rank, but still it will be a very pretty addition to your lordship's income.\" \" Or rather to my son's. Thank you, Law son. You will be here to-morrow at twelve, if you please. The last time we parted you refused to take my- hand. Will you take it now? \" And esteem it an honour to be permitted to do so. Your lordship has nobly endeavoured to repair the errors of your past life.\" As soon as he had left the room, Lord Tenby said, \" Now if he had had a spark of imagina tion or poetry in him, he would have said, 'Nothing in your life becomes you like the"], [294, "ON THE BRINK. 286 leaving it.' But though he may not be deep read in Shakespere, he is a good lawyer and an honourable man. The Lawsons have been our attorneys time out of mind, and I strongly advise you, Hugh, to continue to employ them.\" \" My lord, in that, as in everything else, I will be entirely7 guided by your wishes and advice.\" \"Hugh, I have never been a father to you, and yet you cannot guess the pleasure it would give me to hear you call me so.\" \" Oh, father, so willingly7. I did not like to do it without your permission.\" At this juncture Compton returned. He had been despatched on rather a delicate mis sion. As soon as Sir William had delivered Eleanor's message, and departed in search of a license, Lord Tenby said to Compton, \" Now I should like to see a clergyman. How am I to get at one ?\" \"Whom would you like to see, my lord ?\" Compton asked. \"Your cousin, the Bishop"], [295, "ON THE BRINK. 287 of Chelmsford, is in town ; shall I go for him ?\" \" No. He is a good man, I believe, and a learned man. But I do not wrant dignitaries of the church or learned men. There is a young man, a Air. Edwards, a curate some where in the city. He came to me last year to ask for a subscription to some schools, and I made him breakfast with me. I took a great fancy to him, and I wish you would write him a note for me. His address is, I know, in the Court Guide.\" \"I will go for him myself,\" said Compton ; \" it will save some hours.\" He was absent little more than an hour, and returned with the information that Air. Edwards would call in the course of the evening. \" I also thought it right,\" said Compton, \" to give him a hint that his services might be required to-morrow.\" \" What, Compton ! for my marriage ? You do not, then, disapprove of Eleanor's complying with my request ?\""], [296, "288 ON THE BRINK. \" I think Miss Halsted's decision does honour to her feelings, and I wish to show my appro bation of it by being present at the cere mony7.\" \" Oh, thank God for that. I was so much afraid \u2022 AVell, Claremont,\" he continued, as Sir William entered the room on his return from his second mission, \" what success ?\" \" It is right enough now,\" his brother-in-law replied. \" Here is the document, with your proper title of Duke of Glencoe.\" \" Poor old uncle !\" said Lord Tenby. \" I am glad, however, that I survived him, if but for a couple of days. Eleanor will not care for it, but Mr. Halsted will like to hear his daughter called ' your grace.' \" Soon after the surgeon paid another visit, and expressed his astonishment at finding his patient in such good spirits, for he well knew what pain Lord Tenby- must be enduring. \"All owing to these dear friends present, and to one still dearer, absent,\" was the reply. \"Mr. M., you must contrive to patch me up"], [297, "ON THE BRINK. 289 for four and twenty hours, for to-morrow I am to be married, and I invite you to the cere mony.\" \" Oh, yes, my lord ; but we have plenty of time to talk about marriages,\" said Air. M., humouring him, for he thought his mind wandering. \" Air. M., you think me mad, but to-morrow at twelve o'clock, as these gentlemen will tell you, I am to be married to Aliss Halsted, and I wish you to be present.\" \" Aly lord, I shall not fail you,\" said the surgeon, with a total change of manner ; \" and permit me to say that I most sincerely- rejoice to hear of your intention.\" \" Ah, you too know, all the world knows, mv shame.\" A little before ten Mr. Edwards was an nounced, and by Lord Tenby's request the others retired for the night, Compton's servant being left to keep watch in the adjacent room.

Compton had taken for himself an apartment adjoining that now occupied by Lord Tenby, and in this Mr. Halsted and his daughter were received by Sir William Claremont on their arrival at the hotel on the following morning. In a very few minutes it was announced to them that everything was ready for the ceremony, and Nelly, leaning on her father's arm, entered the room where Lord Tenby lay propped up by cushions in his bed, so changed from what he was when she had last seen him, that he hardly seemed to be the same man. He was now under the influence of the restora tives which had been administered to him"], [299, "ON THE BRINK. 291 to enable him to go through his part; a hectic flush burnt upon cheeks of ghastly paleness, and his eyes flashed with unnatural brilliancy. Miss Halsted, by a powerful exertion of her will, managed to subdue all outward signs of agitation, though she was pale as marble. Sir William had informed her of Compton's intention to be present, and the motive that prompted it excited her deepest gratitude. She knew that he was there, within a few paces of her, she even felt that his eyes were fixed on her, but she could not trust herself so far as to acknowledge his presence. AVithout looking to the right or left, she walked with apparent composure to the side of the bed, but when she spoke her voice betrayed her emotion. \"I trust, my lord,\" she said, in trembling accents, \"that you are suffering less pain.\" \" Eleanor, Eleanor, say7 that I am forgiven. ' \" Believe me, my lord, if I could not say from my heart that I most sincerely forgive"], [300, "ON THE BRINK. 292 you any wrong y7ou may have done me, I should not now be here.\" \" My lord, my lord,\" said Mr. M., \" this is wrong. You had better allow Mr. Edwards to proceed.\" His injunction was complied with, and in the presence of her father, Sir AVilliam Claremont, Compton, Hugh, Air. Lawson, and Mr. M., Nelly- once more received Lord Tenby's hand, but on this occasion no one had the courage to wish them joy. Mr. Edwards alone said, as he closed the book, \" My lord, I congratulate you on having been permitted to accomplish this great act of justice ; on having so far made your peace with Heaven.\" It was not till the ceremony7 was concluded, when they came to signing the register, that Mr. Halsted was made aware of his son-in law's accession to a ducal coronet, and he may be pardoned if a slight flutter of gratified pride took momentary possession of his breast. The new duchess, as her husband had predicted, took it with greater composure."], [301, "ON THE BBINK. 293 \" Mr. Halsted,\" said Lord Tenby, when the representatives of law, physic, and divinity had taken their departure, \" it was my most anxious wish to renew the settlements formerly made on Eleanor, but Mr. Lawson assured me that it would be impossible to get them com pleted in time.

I cannot allow our marriage to become a source of pecuniary advantage to myself.\" \" Oh, mother !\" said Hugh, \" would you refuse me the pleasure \" \" There is not much I would refuse you, Hugh,\" she replied, \"but this you must not ask of me.\" \"Well,\" rejoined Lord Tenby, \"at least, Mr. Halsted, you will accept from him the repayment of the money due to you. That is"], [302, "294 ON THE BRINK. a debt of honour, which, unpaid, would not allow me to rest quiet in my7 grave, and Hugh has taken it upon himself. You may trust him, though he is my son.\" \" Yes, my lord,\" said Air. Halsted, \" that we may accept, though I think the duchess perfectly7 right in declining anything in the shape of a settlement.\" He could not refrain from naming his daughter by her new title, though he coloured a little as he did so. \" As for Hugh,\" he said, \" I would trust him certainly for his own sake, but none the less for being your son, since you have allowed y-our better nature to make itself heard.

It is easy to see how much fatigued you are.\" \" Yes, I feel it. Adieu, Mr. Halsted, with many thanks for your kindness. Eleanor, may I hope to see you once more ?\" \" Oh, my lord ! I am now your wife, and my place is by your bedside. I shall not leave you.\" He tried to say something, but the words stuck in his throat. He could only take her hand and kiss it. The rest took their leave for the present, with the exception of Compton, whom Lord Tenby requested to remain. \" Compton,\" he said, as soon as the door closed on the others, \" I have remarked that you have not said a word yet to Eleanor. Do you disapprove of her remaining here ?

You see how selfish I still am, but it will not be for long.\" It was an embarrassing moment for Nelly when she first found herself alone with her husband. She drew a chair to the bedside, and allowed her hand to rest in his, but neither of them attempted to say a word ; and before long so violent an attack of pain seized upon him, that her whole thoughts were engaged in devising some means for giving him relief. The perspiration fell from his forehead in streams, and his groans were all the more heart-rending from the efforts he made to repress them. \" Oh, my dear lord !\""], [305, "ON THE BRINK. 297 she exclaimed, \" is there nothing I can do to give you ease ?\" \" Nothing, nothing,\" he murmured out. \"M. says there is nothing. It feels as if I had swallowed coals of fire. But it will pass ; indeed I already feel a little easier. And how little it is in comparison with what I deserve ! Eleanor, pray for me, that my sufferings may not be prolonged after death.\" By degrees the pain subsided, and he appeared to doze, but not for long. \" Eleanor,\" he said, but in a voice hardly audible. \" I am here,\" she replied. \" Can I do any thing for yon ?\" \" Eleanor, there is a little child at Boulogne, who in a few hours will be without a single friend in the world.\" \" I understand you, my lord, but be under no apprehension about her.

He was summoned back to Brighton by the sudden and alarming illness of his mother. \"You are in such good hands,\" he said to Lord Tenby, \" that I leave you without scruple. God only knows if we shall meet again upon earth, but, whether we do or not, you have my most earnest prayers for your welfare.\" \" Farewell, dear William.

In about an hour they were told that Mr. Edwards was gone, and they returned to Lord Tenby's room. At the door they met Air. M., who was just coming out. \" How did you find your patient, Mr. AI. ?\" said Nelly. \" Easier, your grace.\" She and Hugh passed into the room, but Compton was stopped by the surgeon. \" Her grace ought to be warned,\" he said. \" Morti fication has set in sooner than I expected, and in a few hours all will be over. I shall call again before morning.\" \" Thank you, Mr. Al. I will attend to it.\" Compton stopped for a moment to send a messenger for Air. Halsted, and on entering the room he found the communication [already made. Nelly's first words to her husband had been, \"lam so glad to hear that y-ou are more free from pain.\""], [308, "300 ON THE BRINK. \" Thank you, Eleanor, but do you know what it means ? It means that mortification has begun, and that my life may now be counted by hours.\" \" Oh, my lord !\" she cried, greatly shocked, \" forgive me my thoughtless words.\" \" Dearest Eleanor, there is nothing to forgive. My life has not been such that I wish it prolonged. I sometimes fear that the little dread I have of death may savour of presumption ; but, even when offending God daily- and hourly-, I never felt a doubt of the truths which He has revealed to us. From the sin of infidelity at least I am free, and now I have such immense faith in the divine mercy promised to a penitent sinner, that I trust even my imperfect repentance may- not be rejected. I almost look upon the cessation of pain as an earnest of it, and M. tells me it will not return.\" For the next hour or two he dozed and talked by turns, but evidently growing weaker by degrees. \" Compton,\" he said, during one"], [309, "ON THE BRINK. 301 of his waking intervals, \" what a mass of contradictions we are.

Compton made out the word \" useless,\" repeated several times. \"AVhat is useless, my lord?\" he asked."], [310, "302 ON THE BRINK. \" I was thinking,\" he said, in a faint voice, \" of what I might have been with such friends and such a wife, and then I reflected how useless such retrospections are now.

Ah, if the prayers of such a sinner as I am can meet with acceptance, your happiness here and hereafter is secure.\" He sank back exhausted by the effort, and lay for more than an hour so still, that they began to think life was extinct. \"Is that you, Eleanor?\" he faintly said, as she hung anxiously- over him. \" Yes, my lord.\" \" One kiss, Eleanor, one kiss for the love of God.

He never spoke again, but passed away without a struggle, and so quietly that no one could say when he died. In fact it was not till Mr. M., who paid his promised visit about two hours after midnight, an nounced that Lord Tenby had ceased to breathe, that they were aware of the fact. Nelly retired to her own room, where she found her father waiting for her, and shortly after she returned with him to Ealing. Compton and Hugh, now Duke of Glencoe, kept watch till morning over the dead. \" I feel,\" said Hugh, \" that I could have loved him well.\" \"Yes,\" replied his companion; \"I never knew a man whose manners were more calcu lated to inspire attachment. And yet this man, so full of talent, and whose last moments prove how good was his natural disposition, has not left more than two or three to mourn his fate. It is a lesson to us all, Hugh.\" As soon as the funeral was over, Nelly, accompanied by her father and Hugh, at the"], [312, "304 ON THE BBINK. suggestion of the latter, removed to the feudal seat of the Glencoes in Scotland, where for upwards of a year she remained in strict seclusion, broken once by a visit from the AVindermeres, and once by one from Sir Philip and Lady- AVinifred. Sir Arthur himself oc casionally- ran down for a few days at a time, generally on the plea of business connected with his guardianship, but he carefully abstained from appearing in the light of an habitual inmate of the castle. No doubt that twelvemonth was a time of trial both to him and Nelly, but at length they had their reward. Lord Tenbyr's death occurred in the early part of November, and a few days before Christmas in the following year the Duchess of Glencoe gave her hand to Sir Arthur Compton, in the chapel of Compton Manor. None but their nearest connections were present, who, as soon as the ceremony was completed, took their departure, the Comptons, who were going abroad, having placed their"], [313, "ON THE BBINK. 305 house at the disposal of the new-married couple till Easter. \" Do you remember, Sir Arthur,\" said Lady Winifred, as Compton was handing her into her carriage, \"I prophesied that you would pass your honeymoon here ?\" \"Perfectly. I believe you even took the trouble of communicating y-our thoughts on the subject to Nelly. I hope Alabel O'Hara was quite well when you last heard from her.\" \"Quite well,\" she replied, laughing; \"but you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking after her on your wedding day.\" \"Ought I? Well, I can only say, Honi soit qui mal y pense.\" The place to which Lord Alargate had, in the first instance, nominated Sir Arthur Compton, had been filled up long since, and there seemed to be very little chance of his obtaining such another offer. He retired on half pay. The first two years of his married life were passed in comparative idleness, and he was astonished to find how easily he slid VOL. III. x"], [314, "ON THE BRINK. 306 into it. His wife, perhaps, regretted the want of active occupation for him more than he did himself. But time, as it passed over their heads, brought with it many changes. During the first season after her marriage the duchess resumed her place in society with more popularity- than ever, was presented at court, gave a couple of balls, and a few small parties, but it was, as she confided to her intimates, her farewell to the world in general. She had no longer any occasion to court the excitement of pleasure abroad, as a substitute for happiness at home. On his coming of age the Duke of Glencoe had insisted, in such terms that refusal was impossible, on Sir Arthur's allowing him to settle on his wife a small property in Hertford shire, consisting of a few hundred acres of land and an excellent house, known as Mortimer Lodge, which had been the country residence of old Lady Tenby during her widowhood. The villa at Ealing was given up, and at the Lodge Compton, his wife, and father-in-law,"], [315, "ON THE BRINK. 307 set up their household gods. Here, in due time, the family circle was increased by the addition of a young lady and gentleman, who were popularly supposed to bear an ex traordinary resemblance to Sir Arthur Comp ton and his wife, though which resembled which was an open question. The life of a country- gentleman opened to Compton a new field for his activity. He hunted, he farmed, and threw himself headlong into the vortex of county politics, when, at length, another event gave freer scope to his energies. One morning at breakfast Air. Halsted declared that he found his increasing duties as a grandfather incompatible with those of a Alember of Parliament, and that it was his intention to resign his seat. This resolution he carried into effect ; and so well did he take his measures, that his son-in-law was elected in his stead without opposition. Sir Arthur Compton is now member for Guzzlebury.
