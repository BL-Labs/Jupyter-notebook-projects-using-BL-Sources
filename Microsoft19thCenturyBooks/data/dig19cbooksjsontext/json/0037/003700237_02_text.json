' Well, Miss Gray,' Susie suddenly changed her tone, like the most accomplished actress, as she took a step or two forward and greeted, in a way the most disengaged and free from any tinge of consciousness, the dangerous person. - 1 trust the nest was worth the trouble of going in search of it.

In the meantime Jane was left to hang back and look miserably glum, as if she had been VOL. II.

' I am absolutely frightened to open my ignorant mouth before you and Jane,' ran on Susie, showering her sugar-plums of speech all around. ' Is not Haybridge delightful ? The garden, like everything else, so fresh and flourishing, and without any little plagues to do mischief within its bounds.' ' I hope you include the master of Haybridge in your compliments to the place, Susie,' said Mat, raising his hat with a little mockery. He had interposed to cover a slight confusion on the part of Miss Gray, who had echoed ' Nest ! ' in a bewildered voice, as if she had already forgotten all about the wonderful specimen of bird architecture which she had gone aside for the purpose of inspecting. She bit her lip the next moment, and stood silent, but she looked bright and contented ; and Mat Crabtree, too, had a gay and well-entertained air. When the party returned to the house, the"], [15, "LEARNED LADIES 3 host took the ladies into his study to have tea, while the children gathered again round the dining-room table, under the auspices of the housekeeper. Mr. Crabtree's study was his snuggery and sanctum, where he spent the most of his time. It was a comfortable, really good library, not seriously marred by traces of a country gentleman's pursuits. These were the ' Agricultural Calendar ' above the writing table, part of which was fitted up like a cabinet, only the specimens were not of coins or shells, but of grasses and seeds : the local newspaper folded- to show the market prices ; the barometer and rain-gauge inside and outside the window ; the gun, about to be used against the young crows, still standing in one corner. But it was to the well-filled bookcases that Jane and Miss Gray were irresistibly drawn, while Susie prowled mouse-like about the room, and peeped knowingly at everything. Mr. Crabtree joined the young women. He b 2"], [16, "BURIED DIAMONDS 4 had a scholar's pride in his choice and com plete editions, and liked to have them valued ; but it was not a mere grasping, grudging, dilettante satisfaction in the possession of treasures, and in denying an approach to them to less fortunate mortals, lest a touch should impair spotless perfection, or render what was rare cheap and common. His stores had been more particularly at Jane Prior's service ever since she had coveted them. He invited her to take from them now what ever she cared to have. ' What is it to be to-day, Jane ? ' he asked cheerfully. ' Has your cormorant appetite exhausted my modest larder, or have you got quite beyond me ? I warn you that in spite of Max Miiller I have not a single word of Sanscrit. My Hebrew literature is confined to the Talmud \u2014 in Eng lish \u2014 absolutely a translation. Did you ever hear of anything so cowardly and compro mising? Will you condescend to patronise my book-shop after you have heard that ? '"], [17, "LEARNED LADIES 5 But Jane hung back determinedly from the shelves laden with massive or subtle philo sophies, and waved forward her companion. ' Miss Gray may profit by your liberality also, Mr. Crabtree, may she not ? ' said Jane, a little in her solemn cathedral manner. ' She has gone a great deal further than I have into ancient history and literature, and I happen to know she wants Grote and Merivale, and particular editions of Thucydides and Livy and Sophocles.' ' Now this is crushing,' exclaimed Mat Crabtree, looking from the one to the other, with all the merry marvel in his eyes with which he had been accustomed to regard Jane alone. 'You do not mean to say that there are two of you in the same country and of the same generation, in the same house, out of Oxford or Cambridge, or ancient Padua, where one woman was a professor. There were not two Sapphos or two Hypa tias in the Greek isles, or in Alexandria, at"], [18, "6 BURIED DIAMONDS their respective eras. It is too hard on a belated man who has not even his college at his back. Say, Miss Gray, that you never heard of a battle in C\u00e6sar, that you have not read a line of Homer or YirgiL' ' I am afraid I cannot, Mr. Crabtree,' answered Bennet, with her tuneful laugh, ' not even to please you ; ' and there was undoubtedly a shade of grateful emphasis on the pronoun. ' Then there are two young ladies who read Latin and Greek, and, no doubt, beat men to sticks on the ground which we poor male wretches used to hold undisputed. I can't and I won't believe it. Save my credit, Miss Gray. Profess you do not even know whether the Greeks or the Romans came first. Profe.s any amount of ignorance you like. Why, ignor ance is as divine as melancholy \u2014 in a woman. Only restore my self-respect ; give me back my proper intellectual supremacy in the creation.' ' Not in the way you wish,' refused Bennet."], [19, "LEARNED LADIES 7 ' But, oh, dear ! I am only a poor scholar ; comfort yourself; you would soon convict me of a thousand inaccuracies iu particles. Women are proverbially inaccurate, aren't they ? Though I will not flatter you more than I can help, I do believe it has been by reason of the poor creatures' defective education, as a rule. Ahd do not blame me too much for feminine presumption. I learnt in order to teach, and do you know there was an idea of little boys like Tom and Sam grown a few years older, as well as of little girls like Ally, profiting by my instructions at the same time ?

I assure you there are men, nice enough fellows, with whom it wouM be quite easy and pleasant to live in other respects, who have not won laurels in the schools.' Again there was the twinkle that Jane had caught before of fun, and of a mutual understanding between him and one of the company, in Mat Crabtree's blue eyes. There was an answering flash, half of uncontrollable amusement, half of lively indignation, which overcame the confusion in Bennet Gray's eyes, as she looked up, and replied with spirit \u2014 ' I do not know whom you call nice enough fellows, but any really nice fellow \u2014 any man worthy of the name I have ever known \u2014 would never wish to strip a woman of whatever small triumph she had gained. He would not need ; he would have plenty of triumphs of his own of another kind. He would be proud \u2014 the proudest of all though it would be foolish, for her sake.'"], [21, "LEARNED LADIES 9 She stopped with a little catch in her voice, for she had spoken so fast that she had lost breath. 1 You are right,' he said cordially, smiling benignly on the eager speaker. The conversation, if not idle words, was completely mystifying, a veritable dead lan guage, to Jane. Not only did she fail to understand a syllable of it, at no time could she have bandied jests and kept her own with Mat Crabtree as Miss Gray was doing. Jane had always been too much in earnest in the argument. No wonder he liked the badinage and looked full of admiration at his antagonist. Even when they talked seriously afterwards, Jane could see it was no pretence \u2014 that it did seem to him an amazing, admirable, diverting thing for a girl like Miss Gray \u2014 a simple enough young girl, made to be taken care of \u2014 bundled about, petted and found fault with by people who were come to"], [22, "BURIED DIAMONDS 10 man's estate when she was born \u2014 a pretty creature, too, as he had ever seen \u2014 to know what she knew. She could prattle with the wisdom half of a child, half of a sage, as it sounded to him, of the hoary campaigns of vanished empires. She quoted with sponta neous, keenest appreciation the very passages which were his favourites in the sweetest, the most sonorous of tongues which no living lip now spoke. He was reminded of pictu resque stately figures among the learned ladies of Old England, of ' Sidney's sister, Pembroke's mother,' of gentle, hapless Lady Jane, of the noble shrew, Queen Bess. Just so, Mr. Crabtree had been wont to stare and to smile at Jane's attainments. Now Miss Gray shared both the surprise and the ridicule. Somehow it had no galling side for her. She was able to pay him back lightly in his own coin. It was something strange for- Jane to stand aside and witness the transfer of the tribute, such as it was,"], [23, "LEARNED LADIES 11 that Mat Crabtree had paid her to another. She had never cared for it when it was entirely hers; indeed, she was convinced it had rather provoked her and silled her with disdain. Why should he be astonished at what girls could do in learning any more than he would be struck by the small feats of lads? Above all, why should he laugh ? Jane could solemnly pledge herself \u2014 and it was balm to her hurt mind to be able to do so \u2014 that she had never for an instant regarded her relations to Mr Crabtree in the odious light in wliich Susie had represented them. But when all was said and done, Mat Crabtree's books and his talk i if them to a woman, his interest in a woman's studies, had been her peculiar property till this day. It was bewildering, to say the least, to be called on at a moment's notice to share her propei ty with some one else, even though the sharing was at her own suggestion, and the sharer was her chosen friend. The position was rendered still more be-"], [24, "BURIED DIAMONDS 12 wildering aud trying by the circumstance that, during the whole time the conversation lasted between Mat Crabtree and Miss Gray by the bookcases, Susie kept casting covert significant glances from them to Jane, and from Jane to them back again at the same time. Susie pointed the glances by imperceptible shrugs of her graceful shoulders, elevations and depres sion of her beautiful eyebrows, and instan taneous raisings and sinkings of her small, DO ~ expressive hands. Jane was above betraying any vestige of pique, but she was very silent in the middle of the children's chatter, and after it had subsided into cross drowsiness in the drive home. She was unusually silent and thoughtful for days to come."], [25, "'3 CHAPTER II. THE MEETING AXD PARTING AT THE RATS' DITCH. It is difficult to believe, nevertheless it is true, that the fiery trial to which John Prior was subjected had lasted till within a week of this time. With hardly an exception he had gone every lawful day, no longer unobserved, it is true, for the secret could not be kept so long \u2014 but, however speculated upon, unmolested, and with his privacy uninvaded, to Redcot Quarry, under Redcot Spinny \u2014 now all bursting into tender green and alive with feathered choristers. He had stood for stated intervals settled upon between the man and himself, at his post, watching for his ruin or his deliverance. On the surface he did not look much gaunter and"], [26, "BURIED DIAMONDS 14 greyer than he had looked in the beginning, though under the skin the ordeal had done its work. When, after sundry signs of abating energy and dying out hope, about a week before a certain day in the beginning of April, the bor- ing implements and tackle which had been in persistent use for seven or eight months were carted away from Ladslove finally, John Prior stood and gazed at their departure as he had gazed at their arrival. He was not taken by surprise. He had been reduced into entering on debateable dealings with one of the borers formerly in his employment. This worthy man had eventually, like the illustrious John Churchill Duke of Marlborough, and many other famous magnates, consented to sell him- self to both sides. He was paid by Lambert Crabtree for giving him the double benefit of the collier's skill as a borer at Ladslove, and of his old acquaintance with the dip of the mine rals at Redcot. The enterprising miner was"], [27, "MEETING AND PARTING 15 also, it has to be owned, paid privately by John Prior for bringing to him the practical result of the boring in such abstracted specimens of rocky soil as the operation produced, and as the operator could carry away hidden in his blue cotton handkerchief. It was further understood that this obliging and unscrupulous gentleman should act in his acknowledged master's employment \u2014 rather as a decoy-duck than as a faithful guide \u2014 while all the time John Prior comprehended perfectly that Mr. Jacob Evans was, for his part, closely watching, as far as his obtuseness would allow, the run of what he called luck, and that it rested on the turning of a straw whether he would ultimately betray his new master or his old. Alas, alas ! Mr. Jacob Evans was not a unique specimen of humanity. There have been great captains, great statesmen, ay, and great so-called Christ ians seeking to make the best of both worlds, who have not been beyond playing the same lucrative but not very noble game."], [28, "16 BURIED DIAMONDS John Prior had gone through his last inter view under cloud of night, behind the disused mill, with the spy whom he had consented to keep. Once more Mr. Jacob Evans had by the light of a candle, that was found among other conveniences in his jacket pocket, drawn forth a moist, irregular calico ball. It had unrolled itself, as before, into a small pudding of clay, with morsels of stone stuck in it by way of raisins. The manipulator of the pudding had kneaded it into fresh proportions, as if it were a dish to set before a king, and had been guilty of slowly closing one bloodshot eye while he repeated his formula. ' This here stuff ain't no go, maaster, and I'll be blowed if it ever do be a go. Not a crumb of coal as would sile a babby's fingers, or of the black slaty layers as might be lying aboon the coal has come to light ; no, nor never will in any of them shifts.' The prophecy had been uttered in loud, boastful defiance."], [29, "MEETING AND PARTING 17 ' The chances are it will not,' Mr. Prior had been wont to say coldly and evasively. When the busy man who had so many irons in the fire was forced reluctantly to con template the withdrawal of one iron in the admission that the gang of borers at Ladslove had received their dismissal, his employer had awakened to something like animation. 'Then you need not come again, Evans. There is your pay, and I'm obliged to you.' ' Oh, yes, I'll write a line to Mr. Willet,' naming the manager of the Redcot collieries at Kershaw, ' and he will take you on again.' John Prior was in a hurry to get rid of the unattractive instrument of his will, and to forget the dirty piece of work he had engaged in the moment the need for it was at an end ; at the same time the promise he felt bound to keep was suffi cient in its fulfilment to expose the nature of the recent connection between the two men. After all, the world held that stratagems were allowable in love and war, and the squire vol. 11. c"], [30, "18 BURIED DIAMONDS of Redcot was only treating his son-in-law as his son-in-law had treated him. If only John Prior coidd have forgotten that there had been a time in his hfe when he would have scorned such stratagems and declined to deal in such debateable ware. How does a man feel when he is reprieved from an impending doom? Dazed, incredu lous, giddy, mentally-intoxicated for days and days. John Prior was well aware that he was only reprieved, not finally delivered. Lambert Crabtree might bore again on Ladslove next year, or he might let the farm with its minerals to a better-informed, more fortunate speculator. He might sell the land out and out, and its sale might involve new perils, as well as put the Rats' Ditch farther beyond John Prior's reach. But it was always something to have the evil day indefinitely deferred. Gradually the squire of Redcot yielded to the comfort, the positive exhilaration of the rehef. Under its influence he allowed himself"], [31, "MEETING AND PARTING 19 to do what he had not dared do during the months of suspense when the borers had been engaged at Ladslove. He turned his feet, as he had turned them on many a previous occasion farther back in his history, to the field known as the Dutch clover field. He had to leave the road and climb over a stile to get to the spot, but he had taken out with him a young fox terrier, and for the first time for many a day his master had whistled on old Tommy to join company with his young foxy brother. As it was easy to imagine beforehand, the dogs had shown an inclination to stray and to wal low in the shallower part of the rat-haunted ditch in a manner which threatened Tommy with hopeless rheumatism for the rest of his life. John Prior whistled in an abstracted fashion at intervals, and stood with his hands in his pockets staring fixedly at the ground wherein his treasure \u2014 no, his it had never been, might never be \u2014 somebody's treasure lay hid. This man had known of it and dreamt of c 2"], [32, "BURIED DIAMONDS 20 it for the better part of his whole existence, till it had gained a desperate fascination for him, and changed him from a person naturally care less in money matters to a covetous craver of the inheritance of another. But he had no more title to the strip of land on which he was gloat ing with greedy eyes, than the poorest pauper in the parish could claim. It was another Naboth's vineyard. The hour of the afternoon was that at which the master of Redcot had accustomed himself to go to the quarry and watch what was going on in the meadows below, where the borers had sometimes advanced and sometimes retreated. And they had once been within so small a number of yards of this ditch that, in looking back, the fact that the men had missed its secret struck John Prior anew as if Provi dence had interposed and worked a miracle on his behalf. It was a blustering, windy day, with bursts of sunshine and shade. The effect was in-"], [33, "MEETING AND PARTING 21 creased by the gusts bending and lashing the boughs of :he trees, ruffling the leaflets on the hedges, and twisting the blades of grass and spring wheat, until it seemed as if every five minutes or so all the world was seen on its wrong side \u2014 that paler reverse side on which everything is dimmed and loses its individual character, much as distant slaudng rain washes out the landscape. The time was far distant as yet from the midsummer and autumn wealth of rank reeds and rushes, meadow-sweet and brook-lime, iris and horehound, the indisput able property of the ditch. But the primroses were beginning to blossom thickly at the hedge roots, and the duck-weed was showing patches of vivid green. Though the water ranunculus remained snugly ensconced in its muddy lair. and Crazy Betty, the Bride-of-the-Sun, would wait till Lent and Easter were past before she ' shone like fire ; ' impulsive, tall kingcups were already shooting their way through the withered tangle of the last year's growth of weeds. The"], [34, "BURIED DIAMONDS water ousel, as well as the rat, frequented the ditch, and the lark hovered over the field beyond, pouring forth his spring song. But it was not to look at early wild flowers or listen to ' dicky birds ' that John Prior was there. He did not even notice his four-footed companions, that had ostensibly led him across the fields, whisking round, whining, scraping, and indulging in sudden plunge-baths that would have filled Tommy's mistress with well founded apprehension. After staring down at his feet in a brooding way for a little space, John Prior advanced as close as he could to the ditch without missing his footing. The sea son had not been a wet one, and the water was comparatively low \u2014 several inches beneath the ordinary level. He stooped and stretched forward, pressing back all he could gather in his arms of the straggling fringe of sedges, and keenly scanned the discoloured side of the ditch, down to the stagnant water, as if he vainly sought to penetrate its sullen depths."], [35, "MEETING AND PARTING 23 The dogs, mistaking his action, turued and tore to his side, under the innocent impres sion that he was summoning them to a raid 011 the denizens of the place, with whom it was their natural duty and delight to wage war. ' Get away, Fly ! Down, Tommy, you old idiot,' Mr. Prior cried impatiently, driving his satellites back. As he did so he was hailed by a loud voice from behind. ' Hallo, Prior, what are you doing there ? ' John Prior started back with the tremor of a guilty man, and saw the burly figure of Lambert Crabtree in his white cords and hunting-coat on a tall bay horse in the grassy field a few paces off. The appearance of the man happened in broad day in the open field \u2014 moreover, it was his own field, where he had every right to be, yet the apparition was as appalling as could well be imagined. John Prior was ashy white"], [36, "BURIED DIAMONDS 24 as he staggered up to his feet from between the dogs. His challenger was moved to call, ' Good Lord, man, what is the matter?

Remember though there's water handy, I'm on the back of my beast, and Proossian is a tearer in a fix. I saw you from the road, and spotted you by the dogs.

'There will be no occasion,' said John Prior, who had recovered himself. He was on the man's ground, and though when he thought what ground it was, every nerve in his body tingled, still there was no longer even the apology for a quarrel ; and a quarrel here \u2014 while the idea of it flashed across John"], [37, "MEETING AND PARTING 25 Prior's mind as an ominous coincidence \u2014 would be the most ill-judged, reckless pro ceeding which angry passions could bring about. ' I suppose stooping and struggling with the dogs made me dizzy,' muttered Mr. Prior ; then he added with grim, abrupt ceremony, ' I ought to ask your pardon for trespassing, Crabtree.' ' Oh, you're welcome to come here or on any of my fields ; they ain't very many. It is you and Mat who are the landowners,' answered Lambert, carelessly, shrugging his brawny shoulders and flourishing his riding whip. ' We are near relations when it comes to that ; and at this season in these meadows, where there is no game to be disturbed, I should be a curmudgeon if I refused you an exercise ground for poor old Tommy. I thought you had given up taking him out \u2014 left him to toddle after his missus. Mange ain't showing, really ?

There was one thing .to be said for Lambert Crabtree, that he was not naturally a hypocrite. ' I told you I wished to speak with you, sir,' he said, with a greater effort of courtesy the next moment. ' and there is no time or place hke the present. We shan't be disturbed here. No listeners or interlopers save the dogs and Proossian. Plague take the beast, how am I to dispose of him?

' If I keep the bridle over my arm, the devil will paw and prance in a circle round us in a fashion an elderly gentleman with ticklish nerves might not stand.

Every second that passed rendered the necessity the more urgent. Wherever the interview was to take place, whatever was to be its nature, it coidd not be on the haunted ground where the men had met. The dogs were restlessly scrambling down the bank again. Was it possible the dumb animals could tear down the screen of weeds and nozzle out a black morsel of more moment than any yellow nugget in Australia or California ?

'Then it is to be peace, Prior, since I've given up my diggings for the present ? ' questioned Lambert Crabtree sharply.

Then the brutal doggedness of the man came into play. * No, I am not going up to your house,' he said, as he sprang from his horse and strode off towards the pollard. ' I don't want any witnesses \u2014 any women at hand, to pry and carry tales. I don't mean your women in particular, so you need not look blood and thunder. We can settle our dif ferences here as well as elsewhere.'

' Well, Prior,' began Lambert Crabtree, coming back with an inevitable swagger from fastening his prancing, evil-eyed horse, his own big red face looking swollen and shghtly bloated, either from the effects of the wind or of the agitation under which it began to be plain he was labouring. \u2022 I have been sold as regards this cursed farm. The search for coal has been fruitless, though, according to every recognised sign, it ought to have been in these meadows. Where the foul fiend is it ? ' he cried passionately. ' I have made up my mind to ask you what you know ; you must have an idea. You cannot have been all these years the owner of the Redcot mines without speculating on what might blow you up any day.' ' How should I know,' stammered John Prior, ' and why on earth should I tell you if I did know?' he added, recovering from a crazy fancy that the ground on which they"], [42, "BURIED DIAMONDS 30 were standing ought to find a voice and speak the truth. ' Because I'm the very man you should tell if you have anything to say on the subject,' announced the other boldly. ' Look here, Prior,' he went on, with his half assumption of bluff frankness along with something in his voice wliich was at once slyly coaxing and savagely threatening, and of the two inflections of the voice, his hearer liked the first the worse. It silled him with sick disgust. ' I'll show you why you should join forces and go halves with me. I'll make it as good as that if you'll come to the scratch. You're all but used up at Redcot. If you have any knowledge to sell it won't pay you to keep it up. You can't buy Ladslove \u2014 for that matter it ain't in the market again \u2014 not yet.

If you'll put me up to a wrinkle or two I'll come round and make an arrangement, so that you, and Mrs. Prior, and Jack and Jill after you may have an equal share in the benefits of my purchase and the profits of any minerals that may be worked on Ladslove. Come, I cannot promise fairer than that, and you'll be a dashed fool if you refuse my offer.' ' I may be permitted to judge for myself, I suppose, on the worth of the proposal,' said John Prior, with dry lips, stung to madness, and restraining himself by a tremendous effort. ' You have my answer. I can only repeat what I have already said. You have no reason to suppose that I have anything to tell you, and you take still more upon you, for which you have still less right, when you imagine that if I"], [44, "BURIED DIAMONDS 32 had I should tell it to you, of all people. My opinion of my son is my own affair. I have yet to be informed that he has been guilty of anything which merits your contempt. When it comes to that I do not know what I myself have done that you should propose to buy me up.' Lambert Crabtree had exchanged his grin for a scowl. ' Take care, John Prior, you had better think twice what you are about. I don't mind letting you into a secret which will be public property very soon, if you don't think better of it. I'm on my last legs. That infernal bank for which I've done my best \u2014 drudged \u2014 and lied, and cheated, I suppose you would say \u2014 is coming to grief as sure as fate.

At the same time, it is a fine stoiy for you to come and tell me, or any other listener, at this time of the day, considering the gross extravagance of which you have been guilty.' 'It is as true as gospel \u2014 rather truer, I daresay,' said Crabtree, with shameless bravado.

John Prior was an undersized man beside Crabtree, he was nearer twenty than ten years the elder of the two, and he was a man broken by disappointment and disaster, but he sprang straight at his son-in-law and caught him with such force by the neckerchief that Crabtree, totally unprepared for the attack, was wheeled half round, and reeled on his feet.

He struck his spurs into his foe without mercy; he tugged and tore at the bridle, galling the animal's distorted mouth. The issue seemed to hang in the balance.

Great red peonies, nodding white narcissus \u2014 flowers and tulips \u2014 striped all the colours of the rainbow or the sunset sky, were paving the way for the roses. As for the lambs, it is to be feared a goodly number had passed under the butcher's knife, and figured at good men's tables. Those Oxford examinations in which Jane"], [54, "BURIED DIAMONDS 42 Prior and Bennet Gray desired to figure were close at hand. Jane had never swerved from her determination that Miss Gray should have the same opportunity of distinguishing herself that Jane had. It made no difference that Mat Crabtree took a frankly acknowledged interest in the subject. After the breaking of the ice, which his brother's operations had created for a time between Haybridge and Redcot, Mr. Crabtree came more frequently than ever to the Priors'. It was evident to all that he had a great regard for Miss Gray, and that there was a growing friendship between them. In addi tion to lending her books, as he lent them to Jane, and discussing their contents, it was clear that he liked to talk on other topics with Bennet, and availed himself of every oppor tunity for a tete-a-tete. The air of a good un derstanding between the two, which had existed since the day at Haybridge, increased till it approached to a co fidential intimacy. Such an intimacy between an exceedingly attractive"], [55, "RETURN OF A LAGGARD AND TRIFLE R 43 young woman and even a ' confirmed old bachelor ' like Mat Crabtree, especially if his years do not exceed forty-five, is apt to receive only one interpretation even from the least match-making of onlookers. For the last three months Susie Crabtree had been saying more and more pointedly, ' I told you so.' She had plaintively reproached Jane for her imprudence in bringing such a governess to Redcot, and her parents for their supineness in the interests of Piers ; Mr. and Mrs. Prior ought to have seen at once what Miss Gray's httle game was, without meaning any great offence to her. It was positively a woman's duty to better her position. But it was also the duty of the master and mistress of Redcot to nip the governess's chances in the bud, by throwing cold water on Mat Crabtree's visits till she was honourably got rid of. Even Mrs. Prior had alluded in conversation with Jane to such a termination of the acquaint ance between the squire of Haybridge and Miss"], [56, "BURIED DIAMONDS 44 Gray, and in place of pouring forth wrath had bestowed pleased, disinterested smiles on the latter's brightening prospects. For surely, how ever well-equipped, independent, and satisfied the young lady was as a schoolmistress, there was some foundation still for the old-fashioned prejudice in favour of a happy marriage and a comfortable, secure establishment. It would be a love-marriage on Mat Crabtree's part, and there was nothing to hinder it from being the same on Miss Gray's. He was his own master, and could please himself. He was an excellent, scholarly man, not past his prime, fine-looking for his years, in high repute in the neighbourhood \u2014 a man that any girl might be proud to win and not slow to love. It would be a lucky thing for everybody if, after they had all learned to be fond of Miss Gray, she should be estab lished for life so near them. Of course, Mr. Crabtree might have chosen a wife with available connections and some amount of fortune, but he knew his own requirements best, and Mrs."], [57, "RETURN OF A LAGGARD AND TRIFLER 45 Prior believed he had more than sufficient for the kind of hfe he preferred. He was in the habit of calling himself a farmer, though everybody knew the Crabtrees were gently born and had always been in the rank of squires. But he was totally without his brother's taste for display and passion for filling the first place. It was nonsense about little Piers's being deprived of his inheritance. It was one of Susie's idle affectations. Mrs. Prior looked affronted and even angry when she referred to this extreme view of the case. The child s father and mother had no right to coimt upon his uncle's remaining unmarried for his sake. It was most unjust \u2014 a piece of selfish impertinence. It would show much more proper regard for little Piers and Molly's interests, if Lambert Crabtree and Susie sought to make retrenchments in what had become the gross extravagance of the Bank House. Jane listened and assented sedately to what her mother said. She delivered it as her"], [58, "BURIED DIAMONDS 46 opinion, not without a certain haughtiness and hardness, as wesi as an unswerving rectitude of tone, that nobody had the slightest call to inter fere with Mr. Crabtree and Miss Gray as to what they thought fit to do, either in marrying or in not marrying. For her part, she thought people would often do better not to marry ; but let the world judge for itself. It was plain Miss Prior was not going to forbid her friend's banns if it ever came to that. Jane was not the style of woman who played the dog in the manger. She did not even change her mind about Miss Gray's being easily spared by the children to go for a day or two to Oxford. When it came to that, the candidates' presence in the town with the examiners was not absolutely necessary. It was the women's papers and not themselves that were wanted. The matter might have been managed by correspondence, only it would be so much more exciting to be on the spot, to learn their fate at once. The little Woods could"], [59, "RETURN OF A LAGGARD AND TRIFLE R 47 remain under the care of their grandmother, to whom Bennett's views on their education had been bringing the children nearer, thus restor ing some of the privileges of the relationship which Jane had begun by impairing. Neither did Jane Prior cause the whole project to crumple down like a house of cards by withdrawing from her share in the expedi tion, when she heard Mat Crabtree announce, half coolly, half mischievously, that he thought he would improve the occasion. He would see them to their destination, revisit his college, and be at hand to witness their triumph, though it should cause him to hide his diminished head. He even insisted on writing to an old landlady to secure lodgings for the ladies. Jane accepted all these demonstrations very much as a matter of course, with a gravity of acquiescence that fitted in with the extent to which she was engrossed by her final prepara tions. The last ' reading up ' was so close and persistent that Jane was driven to be more than"], [60, "BURIED DIAMONDS 48 ever, during all the moments she could call her own, reduced to the company of her books, and buried in them. She drifted away from her fellow-competitor no less than from her interim coach. Bennet Gray could not give herself up so thoroughly to the coming contest, but the absorption did not seem unnatural in Jane. Mat Crabtree was the only person who remarked upon it and was disturbed by it to no purpose, so far as producing any relaxation on Jane's part. ' She'll study herself ill,' he complained to his ally. ' She is in a fair way to break down. Think of a Trojan of a young woman like Jane breaking down ! and how will she stand it ? It is too bad. I wanted this visit to Oxford to be pure enjoyment, an instance of \" veni, vidi, vici\" to everybody ; and here is Jane, will not give an old friend the rise of making her angry, not to say of making her laugh. Why, I have not seen her eyes sparkle for a month. She has ceased to pay me the compliment of putting me down.' But if Jane had become so impervious to her"], [61, "RETURN OF A LAGGARD AND TRIFLER 49 friends' influence as not even to be nettled or amused by them against her will, she was in capable of standing in their way or of doing what is vulgarly called spoiling sport.

It would not signify whether the inter ference were successful or unsuccessful. They should never have that service to thank her for. Distrait as Jane Prior's manner was apt to be at this time, while she was accused of being con stantly in a brown study and laughed at because of it, there was a dignity about her sdent, austere self-restraint that made itself dimly perceptible.

Whatever was the truth concerning Berkshire and the gentleman and lady's encounter or non-en- counter there, together with Miss Gray's reasons for making a mystery of it, the responsibility of that too was shifted from Jane's back, and rested on Mr. Crabtree's broad shoulders. He had become accountable to his friends for the knowledge he possessed, so far as they might become implicated in its consequences. But if what people began confidently to anticipate were to be fulfilled, the matter concerned him- self much more nearly than it concerned any other person. And Jane Prior was large enough minded, and pure enough hearted, to be able to trust both Mat Crabtree and Bennet Gray in the sequel. An unthought-of and, in Jane's mood, a vexatious interruption to the object on which the girls were bent thrust itself in between them and their visit to Oxford. Lambert"], [63, "RETURN OF A LAGGARD AND TRIFLER 51 Crabtree was Colonel of the Newton Volunteers, and, as one among his many noisy bids for popularity, he had established the practice of giving his men an annual jovial entertainment, to which each volunteer could bring one of his friends. Sometimes the entertainment had been a dinner, sometimes a railway excursion, supplemented by abundant opportunities and means for refreshment. This year it was to be a ball given in the Volunteer Hall, with the services of the adjoining White Hart Inn called into requisition. For Lambert Crabtree's credit it behoved his friends to support him in what was sometimes called his noble generosity. The feminine element in the entertainment this year also rendered it Susie's affair, and she had set her heart on its being a complete success. It would be dreadful if her own family did not stand by her in her laudable wifely exertions to do her husband honour. There were so many things against her, she pleaded E 2"], [64, "BURIED DIAMONDS 52 quite piteously, casting up her big dark eyes as if she were appealing to Heaven to interpose on her behalf. It was a bad time of the year for a ball, though it suited Lamb and the volunteers. The member, on whom they might have depended for help, was up in town in the heat of his duties at Westminster. Several families in the neighbourhood had started earlier than usual, after an epidemic of measles among the children, for their summer stay at the coast. Painters had been in the Bank House, which had been running to seed and calling in the most crying manner to be done up. Susie and Lamb and the children had been cooped into corners and all but poisoned with the smell of paint. The smell was there yet, and the whole house was in disorder.

She had done what she coidd. She had gone evening after evening to be present at drill. She had taken rooms in the White Hart for any ladies with whom she could use the liberty of inviting them for a single night, and then finding accommodation for them out of her house. But the arrangement could neither be comphmentary nor comfortable \u2014 though the White Hart was charming as an old inn \u2014 and naturally she had been disappointed in a good many of her guests. She might make a toler able muster on the stand at the review, but she was very much afraid the attendance of her friends would fall short at the ball. It would look like a slight to the poor dear men, who had always been so good in presenting arms to her when she walked along the sine. It would do Lamb harm with them and with everybody \u2014 especially since that low, pottering branch of a London bank had been opened"], [66, "BURIED DIAMONDS 54 in the town.

She had probably not been at many balls \u2014 they could hardly have come in her way \u2014 so that this one, though it went without saying that it was of a mixed character, might be quite a little treat for her. She, Susie, would try and settle every thing so as to suit the two young ladies from Redcot. She was aware they were just starting for Oxford to give an account of their studies and reap the fruit of them, in acquiring a right to put certain letters after their names \u2014 was not that it? It would be a most imposing conjunction, and the ambition to command it was meritorious in the extreme. Her anxieties did seem those of a frivolous wretch beside"], [67, "RETURN OF A LAGGARD AND TRIFLER 55 their aspirations. But what could she do? She was a married woman, and must do her little best to keep up her husband's dignity and please him, poor soul !

She' would not detain them a minute longer than she could help, as they were to leave early the next morning. But for the very reason that the ball would be the last thing, even their books \u2014 if these were to be taken with them, though it sounded like carrying coals to Newcastle \u2014 -would be packed, and minds like theirs were too superior to be unhinged by a poor piece of gaiety. No, she was not jesting. She had never been further from jesting in her life. She felt hurt that they should think she was laughing when she was begging a tremendous favour of them. She would not ask her sister and Miss Gray to do more than dress comfortably at home, drive straight to the hall, dance a"], [68, "56 BURIED DIAMONDS couple of dances or so, and, if the girls could not stay for supper, they might drive right out to Redcot, and be back by twelve o'clock.

The dear citizen soldiers were not hard to please, though she liked to give them her best \u2014 of course it was a different thing where she was concerned \u2014 their colonel's wife, who belonged to them as Lamb did in a way. Jane Prior could not refuse to lend her countenance to Susie and her husband in such a trifle, especially after Susie whispered aside to her sister that there was only one reason which could reconcile her to the absence of Jane and Miss Gray. Susie had a terrible fear that her brother-in-law might expose his de plorable infatuation. He might dance with Miss Gray, though he had said as far back as when Susie married that his dancing days were over, and he had not danced for a century."], [69, "RETURN OF A LAGGARD AND TRIFLER 57 He might set all the laws of etiquette at defiance \u2014 he had always been a bungler when he had to do with these very necessary rules \u2014 by taking in Miss Gray instead of some officer's wife to supper. The expression of that appre hension decided the question for Jane. Susie's importunity prevailed with her sister whatever might be at its foundation. For it remained doubtful what caused Mrs. Lambert Crabtree to be so very urgent. It might be a deter mination on Susie's part to get her own way, which had always been a passion with her. Or she might have an ardent desire to appear before the un appreciative Jane, and the more appreciative Bennet, in the glory of the unap proachable dress Mrs. Crabtree had provided for so humdrum and mixed a gathering as a Newton volunteer ball. Or she might really be prompted by a principle of policy in reference to Lambert Crabtree's interests.

To Mrs. Prior's secret disappointment there had been no lightening of the gloom coinciding with the withdrawal of the borers from Ladslove.

' John Prior asked himself. * I incline to think not, from sundry disquieting symptoms that have come under my notice lately. I wish to goodness people would take alarm and make themselves safe in time, if there be time. Good heavens ! Crabtree's Bank coming to grief would mean desolation far and wide round Newton. At the same time, for him to serve up the bank difficulties so as to make them appear in the worst light to me, in order to suit his own purpose, would be of a piece with the rest of the scoundrel's conduct.' But Mr. Prior did not forbid the attendance of his daughter and her friend at the festivity. He felt himself standing there gagged and fettered, unable, it might be, to prevent a"], [71, "RETURN OF A LAGGARD AND TRIFLER 59 great public wrong, but at least he would not precipitate it. He would not expose to the world any more than he could help \u2014 any more than he had exposed already \u2014 the terms on which he stood with Lambert Crabtree. What had occurred in the clover-field by the Bats' Ditch must remain for ever a secret between the two men, even though its pro clamation were to save the pockets of Newton and the neighbourhood from being turned inside out. The night before the volunteer ball Newton from the highest to the lowest was astir, and engrossed with its. preparations. One or two bon a jide upholsterers, and a score of willing amateurs of both sexes and every degree, were transforming the drill hall into a huge bower with evero-reens. Susie had commissioned such C_ a superabundance from Bedcot and Haybridge, that not only were the stairs of the hall converted into an avenue \u2014 the box, holly, yew, and ivy flowed out into the streets, and"], [72, "60 BURIED DIAMONDS littered both pavement and causeway there as with trophies strewn in a conqueror's path.

There was a great addition of traffic at the station where Miss Gray had made her first acquaintance with Newton six months before. But the traffic was so thoroughly local, and belonged so entirely to the volun teer movement, that any traveller outside the special cause attracted less attention than usual. It was a rainy evening, though the state ment did not imply a tempest \u2014 on the contrary, a soft summer rain, more full of promise than of threat to the corn in the ear, the root crops in fresh green leaf, the fruit beginning to be well set.

Without looking round or asking his way, or even giving up his ticket, he walked through the gateway. He left the ticket collector, who was at that moment hailing a batch of volunteers in the act of entering the station to wait for their train, to account for his neglect of duty to the station-master, similarly engaged"], [75, "RETURN OF A LAGGARD AND TRIFLE R 63 in receiving another detachment of the country's defenders. The traveller who set the railway authori ties at defiance, was a young man, under-sized, rather thick-set than slim, and at a single glance almost grotesquely plain, under an unusual amoimt of tanning. The bullet fore head, the shaggy eyebrows, the somewhat Tartar nose were a singularly close replica of the forehead, brows, and nose of John Prior as those might have been when he had just at tained the five-and-twenty years of young manhood, fairly emancipated from the last lingering touches of boyhood. The full sensi tive mouth might have been the same also, but it was hidden in this case by a heavy dark brown moustache, which, while it relieved the odd plainness of the features, and lent them a certain dignity of vigorous young manhood, was also too weighty for the thinness of the cheeks, and increased the bizarreness of the face otherwise. The face, barring the mous-"], [76, "BURIED DIAMONDS 64 tache, was the face of John Prior of Eedcot grown young again ; the figure, though stalwart enough, was inferior to his, and lost the quality of distinction which his amount of height con ferred. This shorter, squatter figure was not that of a weakling. The walk and general gait were firm and easy, like those of a man who had been well trained, who might have come to the front in the cricket-field, and even been the best dancer in a ball-room when dancing and not lounging was the order of the day. In spite of these reservations the figure was not elegant any more than the face was handsome, and it was less striking for a figure than the face, with its gurgoyle peculiarities, was for a face. People had always thought and said that young Jack Prior, who was so Hke his father bodily, bore not the smallest resemblance to him mentally \u2014 in fact, that he carried his mother's spirit in his father's person. Nothing was more bewildering than to detect the kindly,"], [77, "RETURN OF A LAGGARD AND TRIFLER 65 unworldly, fanciful, and determinedly-cheerful attributes of the one as they were expressed by traits which bore a very different association in the other. But to-night Jack Prior looked as splenetic as his father was fit to do. In place of showing the pleasure which the young man might have been expected to feel on his unexpected, un announced return safe and sound from his voyage to Australia ; instead of displaying the liveliest inclination to shake every woman by the hand and take every man by the button hole to exchange inquiries and congratulations, he looked decidedly out of sorts and verging on sulkiness-. It may as well be said that this was a condition of mind remarkably foreign to the individual in question. But, as not infrequently happens with sweet-tempered mortals, wrath was no joke with Jack Prior, and tended to perpetuate itself in a kind of mulish dogged ness, the germs of which he might have inherited from both father and mother.

If any enemy such as Lambert Crabtree had seen Jack Prior coming back in that mood, the assailant might have pointed to the lad and cried, ' The Prodigal's return,' with some apology in his bearing for the slander. As Newton was not Bedcot \u2014 was, indeed, distant from it by a longish drive, and had not been frequented to any great extent by Jack Prior \u2014 above all, as the town was at that moment over head and ears in its volunteers and their ball, the newcomer carried his point and was not hailed and stopped while he pur sued his way. It was not till he was well quit of the station, and entering the street in which the Volunteer Had and the White Hart were"], [79, "RETURN OF A LAGGARD AND TRIFLER 67 situated, that he was sufficiently roused from his bad humour to observe the festive element in the town. ' What the mischief is up ? ' he asked himself more irritably than sympathetic ally. ' Has there been an election, and is the new member coo-tooing the free and indepen dent electors ? Is the Duke dead, and has the new Duke come to his kingdom ? Oh ! the volunteers, is it ? ' Comprehending the situation as he approached the lit-up Volunteer Hall, with its trail of evergreens, ' then, of course, Susie and Crabtree have their fingers in the pie.' He hesitated. Before him lay the road through the outskirts of the town to Bedcot, which he could reach either by taking a trap from the White Hart, if an available trap were procurable at such a season, or by walking. He was a good walker, and it would be a relief to his hot young blood and the trouble on his mind to tramp through the wet and the friendly shrouding darkness all these miles. But in that case Jack Prior would not arrive r 2"], [80, "68 BURIED DIAMONDS at home till after midnight. He would have to ring up the house and alarm his mother \u2014 not to say incense his father. No, Jack's home coming was not likely to be so welcome, unless where his mother was concerned, for him to propose to accomplish it with a ringing of bells.

Jack had met with one ' extinguisher,' as he called it, since he landed in England, and it had not only ruffled him to gil unwonted extent, it had shaken his faith in what else might befall him. He had missed all the last letters from Eedcot, and he had heard nothing of his family for a long time.

A sudden consternation and cowardice seized upon the young man of another sort from the mere reluctance to encounter his father's bitter disapproval. Jack Prior's steps grew slower and heavier as he drew near the High Street, at right ansles from Market Street. Crabtree's Bank __- and the Bank House, with the church and a cluster of the best houses in the town, were situated at the aristocratic end of the High Street. Should Jack Prior shirk for this night the ordeal that lay before him? Should he decline to face the worst without being fore warned and forearmed ? Should he take refuge with Susie, who would at least be gushingly good-natured and amusing? Susie was not like Jane, who sat upon a fellow as if she were his senior instead of his junior, and had, to say the least, a maiden aimt's right to find fault.

He was obliged to confess it looked like it after his interview with that prim young woman \u2014 that born schoolmistress, that ready-made spinster, Miss Burton. How on earth could Bennet pin her faith to such a stick, and lavish her confidence on a stickler for school forms and social etiquette ? He had burst in on Miss Burton on his way south, after leaving his luggage at Hull, to ascertain at once \u2014 as he had a right, and she knew he had a right to know \u2014 whether Miss Gray had left Berkshire. She had thought it probable she might do so when he last saw her, and in that case he wished to learn where she was to be found, in"], [83, "RETURN OF A LAGGARD AND TRIFLE R 7i order to prevent vexatious mistakes and delays. And Miss Burton had got red, and hummed and hawed, and been as much flurried as if she was Miss Gray, and had yet to be made acquainted with his intentions. She had man aged to make him feel that it was an unwarrant able indiscretion for him to be there at all in the schoolmistress's reception-room. She had hurried him away without a particle of satisfac tion. Satisfaction ! It had been anything save that. She had admitted that Miss Gray was no longer in Berkshire, but she had refused, absolutely refused, knowing what she knew, to give him Bennet's present address till she had time to think and consult the person principally concerned. This detestable Miss Burton had been agitated, as if there was sufficient cause for what appeared to him her unpardonable reti cence. Moreover, she had prevented Jack from seeing her father, who, as he was a man, might have listened to reason.

In the end Jack Prior had departed from the girls' school half-stunned and wholly ex asperated and affronted, without condescending to give Miss Burton any hiut of what was to be his next destination. The interview had only taken place that afternoon. The young man, who had been travelling for the greater part of the day, had not recovered from the effects of it, or made up his mind what step he should take to procure the information Miss Burton had most unjustifi ably denied him. He had come on to Newton and there the question forced itself upon him, should he go straight to Eedcot and perhaps receive another blow \u2014 be told that somebody was ill or .

Jack paused irresolute. The man or woman who hesitates is lost, says the adage. If ever human being was so lost it was Jack Brior. At that moment two ways lay before him in more senses than one, for that was the turning point, not only of his journey for the night, but of the journey of his life. He chose, as so many of us choose, the nearer, shorter, easier way, and suffered for it, as so many of us suffer for listening to the arguments of sloth and ____ C. cowardice.

As if he was destined to be overwhelmed' with strangeness on his arrival, he was shown into the newly painted hall, up the newly-painted staircase, into the newly-painted, freshly-arranged draw ing-room. It was harmonious and dark in grey greens, olive browns, dead gold, and wrought brass, not unpleasant to contemplate first and last, but making him feel as if he had never been in the house before. Susie might only have taken possession of the house that"], [88, "BURIED DIAMONDS 76 day, with nothing save the fundamentals in the public rooms set in order. The mistress of the house was absent, out at the drill-hall, if Jack had been told. On the whole, he did not look a suspicious char acter, so the* servant who had answered his inquiry left him, though the hour was not a canonical hour for any visitor, save the habitues of the house, to wait for Mrs. Crabtree's return. Jack had time to fret and fume, turn over the newspapers and club books, wonder if the children were in bed so that he might not ask for their company, speculate what Lambert Crabtree did with himself in the evenings, and question what on earth Susie could be about abroad at this hour. She could not be at church, because it was too late for any service, even for choral practising ; besides, Mrs. Lam bert Crabtree held advanced views which dis pensed with all save the most perfunctory church attendance. She could hardly be out at dinner, else the servant would have men-"], [89, "MRS. CRABTREE AND HER BROTHER 77 tioned it. He had time to doubt and feel remorseful, to think he had better have gone on to Bedcot, faced his father's caustic cold ness, and given the fragments of the first evening to the mother. He owed it to her. He was giving her cause to reproach him, though certainly the reproach would never be uttered. At last Susie came in, still wearing her hat and light summer mantle. The same servant who had admitted Jack had told her mistress that there was a gentleman \u2014 a stranger \u2014 in the drawing-room who had asked to see her. Susie had made a little moue as if her patience was worn out. She had come up the stairs slowly as if she felt tired, and was turning over in her mind how she might dismiss the intruder most plausibly and urbanely, for Susie was plausible and urbane if she was anything. She must have been very wearied and worried, apprehensive of fresh fatigue and trouble, for she entered the room quietly, with"], [90, "BURIED DIAMONDS 78 almost an intermission of her wonted graces. In place of casting a sidelong, languishing look at Jack from her lovely eyes, she darted out sharp glances from under her lowered eye brows straight at him. The servant had lit the lamp, and of course Susie knew her brother instantly, though he had grown a large mous tache and was tanned considerably deeper than she had ever seen him. With a little spontaneous shriek of delight, she sprang to him and clutched at him rather than clung to him. ' Jack, you here ! come back to stay with me ? ' she cried so breathlessly that her accents were broken with joy. Jack had entertained an impulsive liking rather than a deliberate preference for his sister Susie. What man could refrain from admiring and seeking to cherish so beautiful, pleasant, and dependent a creature? But the truth in Jack Prior had been enough to inspire an uneasy, mortifying suspicion, even when this vision was most agreeable, that the pleasantness"], [91, "MRS. CRABTREE AND HER BROTHER 79 was too sweet to be wholesome, and did not ring true. However, the most sceptical could not have doubted that Mrs. Lambert Crabtree was glad to see her brother. The proof of her affection coming at such a time not only helped to restore Jack's self-respect, it touched him keenly. ' Thanks, Sue,' he said quickly as he kissed her ; ' it is good that somebody is happy to have me back.' ' Happy ! ' cried Susie enthusiastically, and there was actually moisture glistening in her fine eyes. * Happy is not the word. I am enchanted, my dear boy; and I shall have you all to myself, for Lamb has been called up to town on business this very afternoon. Horrid, isn't it, with all this volunteering going on? However, he hopes to get down to the ball at least. But you will stay with me, and take care of me, and keep me company, dear.' She heaped up the affectionate, appealing words.

We have always to get Mr. Parsons to stay in the house \u2014 not to leave it to unprotected females, on account of the bank \u2014 when Lamb is from home. I cannot avoid inquiring if Mr. Parsons is made comfortable, and bidding him good night, when he will call me \" ma'am,\" and detain me with long-winded speeches about giving me trouble and being in my way.

' As she spoke she pulled off her long gloves and laid aside her mantle and hat, putting them down on the sofa beside her. She was left in the demi- toilet of a faint coloured thin evening gown, with sleeves reaching to the elbow and a square-cut bodice finished with frills of lace. It was a pretty and becoming house dress in itself, but the dimness of the colour seemed to be reflected in her face, and to cause her warm and brilliant brunette complexion to pale to a wan sallow ness \u2014 the change in such a colour as hers when VOL.

Jack observed the effect with a little vague surprise and regret, and referred to it the next moment. He had been saying, ' You are the old woman, Susie, spoiling a fellow through his baser appetites. Do you think I have been feasting on game pie and lobster salad in the bush ?' \u2014 when he broke off to add with brotherly, blundering, plain-speaking, ' But what have you been doing to yourself, httle woman ?

Jack ought to have known that he could not have said anything more certain to offend his sister, even though the speech was off-hand and half in jest. But he was not prepared for the something more serious than petulance, the passionate vexation and alarm in her voice when she answered him. ' What do you mean by speaking like this to me, Jack ?

' Not a corner quite in order, not a hole we could call our own till the tradesmen departed finally with their brushes and pails yesterday.

Ben saw me to my . own door ten minutes ago. I have just come from them, and I ought to have stayed with them. I don't deserve to be rewarded by a cosy supper and chat with you, Jack dear, which will be so much nicer and more refreshing.' Susie was as good as her word. After she had despatched a message to Mr. Parsons, Lambert Crabtree's head clerk, that his ser-"], [98, "86 BURIED DIAMONDS vices would be dispensed with, she ordered up everything that the heart of man could desire for Jack's bodily solace. She set her self to entertain him, and when she had recovered from the fatigue she complained of, and the affront he had inadvertently dealt her, she was her bewitching, amusing self again. ' Poor little thing, she has been done up, and was out of sorts, I suppose, with all this fuss,' Jack thought. ' It is kind of her to exert herself on my account. I did not give Susie credit for so much family affection,' he reflected remorsefully. But Jack did not approve ; nay, he was secretly aggrieved, and a good deal ' riled ' by what might have been called the irreverent affectionateness of the tone in which Susie spoke of their father and mother's foibles, and made good stories out of pap-pa's growls and close-fistedness and mam-ma's weakness for Tommy. Still, it was done so lightly and divertingly that Jack"], [99, "MRS. CRABTREE AND HER BROTHER 87 laughed agaiust his conscience, and could not put a stop to the raillery. ' Let me see,' said Susie, resting her two elbows on the table in a- free-and-easy fashion which had recently found favour in polite society. In doing so she lifted up her slender arms \u2014 from which the lace fell back, and sup ported her chin on the httle clasped hands. There sapphires and emeralds blazed in a style hardly in accordance with the position of the wife of a local banker, even though she was a Brior of Eedcot, and he a Crabtree of Hay bridge.

Oh, I have it, the advent of Janie's idol, the Eedcot governess.

'That makes me dispassionate, but, on the other hand, it hinders me from being so appreciative as I might have been even with a heart devoured by jealousy. She is reckoned handsome, and she's quite awfully clever \u2014 knows both Latin and Greek \u2014 that goes without saying \u2014 and I daresay could Solve a problem In Euclid before she could speak. What is of more consequence to her and to everybody,' went on Susie, with her affectation of cynicism, ' she is perfectly well aware on which side her bread may be buttered. If you will believe me, she has been employing her self making up to my elderly brother-in-law, Mat, and I am not at all clear that I may not have to welcome her as a sister-in-law, one of these days, with all the grace I can muster.'

' And Miss Gray has \" come over him,\" as Lamb says, where that vulnerable region is concerned.' ' Miss Gray !

In reality she was saying to herself, ' Mr. Jack has been in mischief again.

But mind, I don't pledge myself that you will lie perdu, since there are hundreds of chances against it, and birds of the air carry tales.

' ' It is well when a fellow can be accommo dating,' said Jack, dryly, ' and can kill two birds with one stone.' After Susie had bidden Jack good night she came back, put her two hands on his shoulder, and looked wistfully in his face. These two members of one family were totally unlike ; but because of their very unlikeness, and also because they were brother and sister, and not two brothers or two sisters, they had been happy together in many a light-hearted hour of the past. Was there compunction in Susie's woman's breast as she looked into the homely young face, with the weariness and trouble in it, which made it look, for the"], [114, "b i 'PIED DIAMONDS 102 moment, so much more like her father's than it had ever looked before ? Had she a passing yearning simply to comfort Ja<\"k, returned from his wanderings and come first to her before he had gone to his mother? Did she relent in her half-defined purpose to make gain of his trouble, and employ it to render more secure the tottering plank on w*hich she might have to cross a yawning gulf, not caring though Jack, too, were dragged down with her to perdition ? What Susie did say when she opened her mouth was, ' Now, Jack, speak the truth. Is it your candid opinion that to have things on your mind \u2014 your conscience, if you will \u2014 to be forced to keep secrets you never can tell the world, must make you haggard and hideous, and cause all your good looks to go off before your time ?

Nobody can pretend it is in my line,' with a sneer that only half hid an ancient soreness. ' You have had your share and mine too, you grasping individual,' he said more lightly, ' and it has made you a conceited little wretch for your pains.' Next morning, having tossed and tumbled through a miserable night, Jack abruptly de molished the flimsy fabric of a stratagem which Susie had reared, and to which he had con sented the night before. He was not going to the volunteer ball. It was high time that he and some other people, who should be nameless, had done with balls. For his part he was sick of them. No, he would not go in morning dress, and he could not send out to Eedcot for his clothes without letting his people know that he had come, and was staying in the neigh bourhood, and so giving fresh offence in that quarter. But he would tell his sister what he would prefer to do, if she would let him. He"], [116, "BURIED DIAMONDS 104 did not care to go to Eedcot without a farther notion of how the wind blew in reference to his father. He (Jack) would like to have a word with Jane first. He would be glad of a day's rest and respite, for he was about done for; but next morning he could take a run down to Oxford, catch up the party from Eed cot, get out of Jane what he wanted to hear, and make up his mind there what he ought to do. After all, he wound up grimly, he might be of some service in preventing the proposal among the academic groves which Susie had predicted. Jack was sulky again, contradic tory and cross, in a mood which, though rare, was not altogether unprecedented with him. One might have thought that Mrs. Crabtree would have been grievously disappointed by this frustration of her benevolent intentions and high moral aim3 \u2014 to wit, the rescue of a gentle man of mature years incapable of looking after himself from the snare into which he had fallen, together with the exposure and disarming for all"], [117, "SUSIE'S DESCRIPTION OP MISS GRAY 105 time to come of a young woman found guilty of a too vaulting ambition. Arguing from Susie's zeal the evening before, it would seem as if the weight of her vexation at its being baulked should have been considerable. Above all, one might have fairly expected Susie to be exceedingly piqued by the necessity for that word with Jane, to which Jack confessed after she \u2014 Susie \u2014 had expended upon him ever so many words.

' Well, do as you please, Jack,' was the carte blanche she accorded him at last ; and though she spoke in the pathetic, dependent way which was a habit of hers, at times, she had recovered completely from the signs of over-exertion and strain which she had shown the evening before. She was almost radiant in her alertness, flying here aud there, the moving spirit of the scene, her eyes beaming, her cheeks glowing, her mind working with marvellous quickness, precision, finesse It was as if excitement suited her, and she found in it the most powerful, subtle, and exquisite of stiuiuLints."], [119, "SUSIE'S DESCRIPTION OF MISS GRAY 107 As for poor, distrustful, credulous Jack. with poison working in his mind and despair knocking at his heart, he hung about the Bank House drawing-room and garden, playing lan guidly with the children, smoking innumerable cigars, exchanging a word with Susie when she darted in occasionally, but speaking to no one else, and religiously abstaining from quitting the place, or even from looking out of the front windows.

JACK PLAYS THE SPY. Jane Prior and Miss Gray were dressing in their several rooms for the volunteer ball at Newton. Jane had put off the necessary duty to the last moment, but, while she went about it reluctantly, she accomplished it with charac teristic despatch. However, she had not acted on Susie's accommodating suggestion that any old-fashioned soiled evening dress might do for the occasion. Jane had too much self respect to be a sloven, though she had a fancy for being severely plain in her attire. She was plain to-night, in a quite simple white gown, with no ornament except the crimson flowers in her hair and bosom. But the plainness suited"], [121, "JACK' PLAYS THE SPY 109 her wonderfully. Had the red flowers beeu absent she woidd have looked like a vestal virgin, or Norma ere she was wooed and won and undone. Even the red flowers in Jane's breast and hair had something earnest in their depth of colour \u2014 something of the solemnity of a sunset. The hue recalled the words, ' angry and brave,' which George Herbert applied to it. Jane was not angry, but she was brave with a good and true woman's courage not to fail in what was required of her \u2014 to be just, generous, magnanimous in whatever trial she had to encounter and overcome. Jane's todet was so soon made that her mother \u2014 with no tremor shaking her from a presentiment of who was at Newton \u2014 coming to help to dress her daughter, and bringing her jewel-cases with her in order to ask Jane to choose what she liked best among their con tents, was disappointed to find herself too late. 'I am all ready, mother, thank you; but I think I am better without ornaments. They"], [122, "BURIED DIAMONDS 110 don't suit this dress ; you see I have these flowers, and jewels would not harmonise with the flowers, as Susie would tell you if she were here. We may safely leave jewels to her ; we may be sure she will have enough.' Mrs. Prior hesitated. Then she went on, with Tommy waddling at her heels as if he, too, had an interest in the toilets. In spite of his canine sagacity Tommy, as well as his mistress, remained profoundly unconscious of whose footsteps were sounding fitfuliy in the near distance. The mistress of the house, with her velvet-lined morocco cases still in her hand, knocked at Miss Gray's door, and was admitted gladly and gratefully. Bennet had committed the extravagance of having a dress from town. The gown was not sufficiently fine to attract attention ; it was not so choice as the delicate plush at which she had gazed ruefully on the evening of her arrival at Bedcot. Still the creation did its artiste credit. It was a charming lacy, feathery,"], [123, "JACK PLAYS THE SPY 111 peachy-coloured composition, in which the fresh youthful bloom of the wearer was set off to perfection. The moment Mrs. Brior entered, she cried out with delight, ' What a pretty dress, my dear !

' It is so nice to have you look at it and praise it. It is so kind of you to come up.

She opened a little nervously the jewel cases, exposing tlieir not veiy extensive contents. ' I have been wondering whether I have anything which you are without that you would care to wear,' she said. 'Jane has refused the loan, but you may like something here, though I am afraid the sets are all old-fashioned.' Bennet did not so much draw back as shrink back. * Oh, no,' she cried, -with a gasp and flush"], [125, "JACK PLAYS THE SPY 113 of shame and distress. ' I cannot take any thing of yours \u2014 I could not bear to wear it.' ' Of course there is no occasion for it, if you do not hke it,' Mrs. Prior acquiesced hastily. evidently hurt by the refusal and the manner in which the refusal was given. ' I know some people do not care to appear in bor rowed plumes,' the elder woman went on, with a forced laugh to get rid of the awkward ness ; ' but I had already offered these to my daughter,' Mrs. Prior added the next instant, feeling compelled to defend herself, ' so that there need not have been any thought of offence.' ' I am not offended ; if you will believe me, I never was further from being offended. Don't misunderstand me, dear Mrs. Prior,' implored Bennet, in her agitation. 'It is not that.

Was"], [127, "JACK PLAYS THE SPY 115 - her way \u2014 modest and tender it was sure to be \u2014 of granting her forgiveness and - wing her blessin c? For a moment it hung in the balance whether Bennet would not act on the strong impulse which had laid hold on her : whether she would not steal her arms round Mr- Prior's neck, and with hidden face appeal her as ' mother ' \u2014 Jack's mother, who was already in her good motherliness replacing the mother whom Bennet had lost when a child ? But too much was at stake to be risked on an impulse, and before it was fully entertained the sudden flash of hope had faded. Mrs. Prior, in place of waiting aa misht have been expected for such a move ment, was already turning away from Bennet. and placidly examining the cases she held. \u2022 No*.-*, which shall it be ?

The whole set might be conspicu ous, but do you fancy any of these ?

' Yes, if you will be so good \u2014 the little brooch,' murmured Bennet, not recovered from her burst of feeling. ' It was John Prior's first gift to me,' said Mrs. Prior, looking at the trinket with pensive interest as she prepared to fasten the pin in Bennet's dress. ' Then please don't put it in,' objected Bennet in renewed trouble. ' It is far too precious. I would rather not have the responsibility.' ' Nonsense ! ' said Mrs. Prior, shaking off her pensiveness as she persisted in fastening the brooch. ' There, it is quite secure. I do not remember its coming loose once. It is not"], [129, "JACK PLAYS THE SPY 117 a bad omen\u2014 we must all expect failures and shortcomings \u2014 but the sign of the true love of an honest man can never be a bad omen.' Bennet only looked the sweeter because of that perplexing passage of arms between her and Mrs. Prior before the girls started. Bennet's fluttering heart lent a softness to her whole aspect. The charm which old fashioned writers were fond of descanting on under the term ' sensibility ' was in her varying colour, her eyes, more frequently cast down than usual, the tender curves of her lips. Her heart felt very warm beneath the quaint little brooch which had been John Prior's first gift to his love, and under the locket which had been another John Prior's first gift to his love. Surely the two gifts were well met on that kindly bosom. Nobody looking at Bennet Gray that night could fail to see that she was a very happy, very lovely girl, and that there was a meaning in her happiness and loveliness \u2014 the"], [130, "BURIED DIAMONDS 118 meaning which constitutes a woman's earthly bliss. But Bennet was not the queen of the Newton Volunteer Ball. What she had said proved true. Susie far outshone all rivals. Any person in search of mere beauty would not look twice at another woman when Mrs. Lambert Crabtree was by. Nay, there was more than beauty in Susie on this occasion. There was an indefinable fascination as she stood near the door of the room receiving her guests unsupported by a foil in the shape of her big red-faced husband, but eagerly backed by every man in his troop, to which she was doing honour. She outshone herself to-night. It was not in her dainty, exquisite Titania size, or in her glowing beauty, beside which every other woman appeared colourless and insipid. It was not in her cooing, caress ing ways, alternating with the summer lightning of her playful wit and malice. It was not in her magnificent dress, which everybod)* who"], [131, "JACK PLAYS THE SPY 119 did not pronounce it glorious, called utterly absurd for a volunteer ball. To be particular, Susie wore a gown which had some of the burning glory of fire in its rich nasturtium colour, toned down, as in the flower, by depths of brown. Instead of short sleeves, the white arms were only encircled below the shoulders by long trailing wreaths of orange and brown nasturtium flowers, with their cool, round green leaves. In opposition to Jane's theory, Susie's neck and wrists were glittering with jewels, before which Mrs. Prior's modest sets would have sunk into utter insignificance Susie's very hair was powdered with diamond dust, so that every time she turned her shapely head a thousand tiny sparkles came into play. But it was not in her dress any more than in her grace and beauty. It was more in the bearing \u2014 a certain imperious challenge and triumph of defiance \u2014 a faint reflection of what dazzled and blinded old corrupt civilisations and barDarous tribes in the beautiful, sleek"], [132, "BURIED DIAMONDS 120 traitresses and human tigresses of history and myth. The unholy spell arrested and held fast the spectators, who did not pause to ana lyse the secret, from which they would most of them have recoded if they had suspected its nature. But they contented themselves with saying there never was such a wonderful little woman as Mrs. Lambert Crabtree. Even Lambert Crabtree, though he must have been tolerably used to his wife's fascina tions by this time, showed himself anew impressed by them, as he came in close upon supper for his brief stay. He loomed immense in his volunteer's uniform, in spite of the fact that uniforms have long been at a discount in a ball-room. His large, light goggle eyes were lit up with admiration when they fell upon the entrancing vision. He went up to his wife's side, and spoke for her ear alone. ' You are in high feather to-night ; that's right. You are a beauty and no mistake, Sue, and, what is better, you are a brick.'"], [133, "JACK PLAYS THE SPY 121 'Do you think so?' she asked, sharply, as if the lateness of his arrival or something in his speech provoked her. She turned a white shoulder to him, and spoke over it \u2014 - What I am I owe to you. Lamb.' But there was no gratitude iu her voice ; for the second time it was hard and cold, and cutting like a knife. To Bennet's surprise Jane Prior danced a great deal in a somewhat stately, steady, grave way, as if she were going through with a duty she was bound to perform. Her popularity was not entirely personal ; sho was the hostess's sister \u2014 she was a Prior of Eedcot, the last un married daughter ; but there was no doubt that Jane also made an impression as a fine-looking girl, when it came to that, with a repose about her which Susie, in her brilliance, lacked. And Jane did not seem to desire to shirk her obli gations. She was very often on the floor, the consequence being that she could not interfere with the arrangements of the sitters. Bennet did not dance nearly so often, though"], [134, "BURIED DIAMONDS 122 she might have had plenty of mtroduct: - Her remaining seated frequently was not due to her being a stranger, but to her being com monly attended by Mat Crabtree He did not dance with her. or with anybody else for that matter, thus showing a due sense of his weight of years.

Many comments were made on the conspicuous association of the couple, and on the rumour of a marriage on the tapis between Mr. Crabtree of Haybridge and the beautiful governess at Redcot who had been so injudiciously brought forward by Jane Prior."], [135, "JACK PLAYS THE SPY 123 ' A stick to break her own head,\" - cynical tongues quoted. The notice which Mr. Crabtree and Gray drew down upon them culminated at the moment when the two were standing together apart from others, but certainly not aware thai they were die observed of all observers, looking at some conservatory flowers which had been brought to do duty among the evergreens at the head of the room. The pair lingered as if they were counting the petals of the camellias and the leaves of the pelargoniums.

If any lady had been near enough to have heard the conversation between Mat Crabtree and Bennet Gray, the reality and the supposi tion did not quite correspond. Mat was saying emphatically, ' In what request Jane Prior is to-night! That is right.' 'She is looking very well,' Bennet had an swered, with hearty satisfaction. \u2022 Yes,' he had resumed with fervour, ' and it is good for her to meet her kind, and have her play. Why not? She is as handsome a girl as any of them \u2014 handsomer, to my mind, since she does not care about it. But her looks are not the best of her. I have known her since she was not much older than her niece Molly, and a more sterling soul never breathed \u2014 the daylight is not more transparent.

But we must think for her, take care of her. and see that she does herself justice. Eh. Miss Gray : ' * Yes, indeed, Mr. Crabtree,' acquiesced Bennet cordially, but still a Httle mechanically and absently. For a new light was dawning upon her as she saw and heard more of his interest in the subject than he had any idea that he was exhibiting, or than he perhaps ac knowledged, even to himself. She vras trying to read between the lines an open secret which was filling her with surprise, jov, and indignation at her own stupidity. Dear wise Jane, who had been so good to her ! And he was worthy of her, and Jack and everybody at Eedcot would be pleased. Bennet had great difficulty in restraining herself, and answering as if she suspected nothing. No wonder the lustre of her eves was getting always brighter and brighter, and she became more and more con spicuously invested with an atmosphere of"], [138, "BURIED DIAMONDS 126 glad content, which was yet wistful in its fulness. At the main door, mingling with the humbler, more bashful volunteers, was a small, rather motley crowd made up of townspeople, commercial travellers, and servants who could be spared from the neighbouring inn, standing lounging and looking in at the fine sight. There was a certain element of confusion and a shift ing character about these outstanding groups, which rendered it possible that an intruder in the throng, a comparative stranger, and a secret spy, might pass muster and escape detection, if not absolutely, at least to a great extent. There was a young man in that unpleasant inde fensible position, with a rough coat buttoned up to his ears and a travelling cap drawn down to his eyes, much as he had worn them the pre vious evening. He stood where he could see into the hall, while he kept himself as well back from observation as he could contrive. He watched a girl whom he had known intimately"], [139, "JACK PLAYS THE SPY 127 at a previous stage of her history, though he had not seen her for many months. He had never beheld her in this guise \u2014 this softly gay peach-blossom gown delicately flowing, daintily trimmed, implying to him something fat costlier than the reality \u2014 with the white flowers in her hair. It formed a whole very different from the demure schoolroom costume, or even the quiet economic holiday clothes of the school mistress abroad. This was a change which, as it seemed to him, only one justification \u2014 the speedy termination of the days of bondage \u2014 could warrant. He had seen her face wear an expression akin to that it wore at this moment, for a false woman's face can take the look it should bear only for one, and hold it up to every new-comer who plays the same part. But never had he beheld the open brow so unruffled, the eyes so clear, the mouth so peace ful \u2014 though the lips trembled a little with sub dued feeling in the middle of the brightness of their snide. Before, when he had seen that face"], [140, "128 BURIED DIAMONDS happy, it had still been clouded with a lurking doubt, a haunting trouble, a shade of fear \u2014 even of forced condemnation \u2014 together with a determined struggle to do right, at whatever cost, warring with the sweet, tumultuous hap piness. The woman was certain of her happiness at this moment. She had acquired some later good, which caused her to cast care to the winds. Her mind, her conscience \u2014 strange as it seemed \u2014 were both at rest. Whoever broke iu upon her recently won satisfaction, and startled her by an inopportune presence which she did not expect, would scatter her hopes, shatter her prospects, and do her a wrong which she would never forgive.

The great old trees in St. Giles's and in the college gardens were in full foliage without having lost the early flush \u2014 free from sombre ness \u2014 of their summer green.

' The others will get this piece of news,' he told himself vaguely. ' They may leave Oxford and return home without delay. Crabtree will, I have no question. I must see Jane at once when I have too good an excuse, if I am to intercept her.' Mat Crabtree went through the Turl with its colleges, looking cool and grey in the summer morning. Jack Prior walked up the High Street. The two men came upon each other"], [181, "THE NEWSPAPER PARAGRAPH 169 at the corner of Broad Street. Jack, who was looking straight before him, was the first to recognise the other and hesitated. Mat Crab tree had his eyes cast down, and was only roused from anxious thought by the half pause of the man in the act of passing him. Mat looked up. ' Hallo, Jack Prior. How have you come here? Have you fallen from the skies?' he cried in genuine amazement, which overcame every other feeling. ' When did you return ? Did you come on from New ton last night? I say, what is this about the bank robbery ? ' And he eagerly button-holed Jack, who, taken aback in his recent hostility to the person addressing him, out of which he had been, as it were, driven by the extraordi nary tidings of the morning, stammered out, 'I know nothing about it. I slept at Susie's the night before last, and left early next morn ing, when there was no word of a robbery. I missed the train at the junction. I was on my way to Jane.' He ended stiffly, with a suspicion"], [182, "BURIED DIAMONDS 170 of sudenness coming into his voice. What had Mat Crabtree not done to him, though it might have been unadvisedly, that he should be thus stopped and cross-questioned in the public street ? ' Ah ! ' said Crabtree, with a gulp, half of disappointment, half of relief, ' then you are in the dark also. But I cannot make it out,' he added, in perplexity. ' You say you were at Newton the night before last, yet you did not appear at the ball, while your mother will take it ill that you should make a halt so near home. I'll engage Jane does not know of your arrival \u2014 Susie must have said nothing of it. Perhaps you came too late, when Susie was gone and the fun half over. Well,' he added, knitting his brows sharply, ' it seems it has been followed fast enough by a calamity. Come along, Jack,' Mat resumed, as if he were recalled to the exigencies of the moment, ' I have no time to lose. I, too, was going to your sister to tell her what has happened. She may not have"], [183, "THE NEWSPAPER PARAGRAPH 171 seen the papers, and she might be startled and put out if she heard the thing spoken of with out warning. Besides, I can't go without bidding the girls good-bye. Of course, I must leave by the next train.' Jack did not appear to have any choice. He did not see how he could avoid accompany ing Mat Crabtree, incongruous as the action was, after what had been in Jack's mind, unless he were prepared to come to an awkward explanation then and there. In the midst of his steady tramp past Badiol there flashed upon Mat Crabtree through the cloud of family trouble which had fallen upon him a recodection that had a great deal to do with two people in whom he took a natural interest. His step involuntarily slowed, a half smde broke across the gravity of his comely middle-aged face. ' You know who is in Oxford besides Jane ? ' he inquired tentatively, and now that you have turned up so opportunely, wonders wdl never cease,' he said, with a shrug"], [184, "BURIED DIAMONDS 172 and a forced laugh, which would not have been forced yesterday. ' My boy,' he went on kindly, ' you are the luckiest beggar in every respect that I know \u2014 luckier than you guess ; though I don't mean that you are not ac quainted with your greatest piece of luck. But I have not time to expatiate on all your good fortime and the marvels that have come to pass on your behalf \u2014 I must leave that to a more fitting occasion. I'll just ask if you have written home. There will be no difficulty there ; but you ought to make the explanation easier for her.' Jack stared blankly. What could Mat Crabtree mean ? Was he mocking him ? Had the man taken leave of his senses ? But there was no further opportunity for enlightenment. The couple were at the weU known house in St. Giles's, at which both men looked up with strangely mingled feelings. There were no faces at the windows, out of which Jack and his comrades had been guilty"], [185, "THE NEWSPAPER PARAGRAPH 173 of leaning smoking, and, when they were on their worst behaviour, chaffing their acquaint ances among the passers-by. A young maid-servant answered Mr. Crab tree's knock. ' Yes, the young ladies were at home.' Somebody behind corrected the state ment, and the girl made a corresponding amendment. One of the young ladies was at home, but the other \u2014 Miss Prior \u2014 had gone out for a book which she said she wanted, while the other young lady was getting ready. ' I know,' said Mat Crabtree, ' Jane must have gone to Acock's for one of Price's books which we looked at yesterday. She must have been in the shop when I passed. I'll go back and meet her, and leave the field free for you, Jack. There is your good fortune again, my lad ; ' and Mat Crabtree faced about actively, and was retracing his steps before Jack had recovered himself. Yes, however oddly it might be brought"], [186, "BURIED DIAMONDS 174 about, and by Mat Crabtree of all people, it was a lucky chance, it was better to see her first alone, and have it out with her, as he had said. He let the girl show him up, though he could have found his way blindfold. As he entered his former sitting-room, where a scarf and a parasol lying on a side-table, a bit of embroidery, not Jane's, on the broad window sill, a different arrangement and a greater profusion of flowers on the chimney-piece, made the place look as it had been wont to look in Commemoration Week, Bennet Gray came in from an adjoining bedroom, wearing her hat and jacket, and in the act of buttoning her long gloves. The eyes of the two met and spoke volumes. Bennet's lighted up instan taneously as by a lightning flash \u2014 danced \u2014 ran over with unspeakable joy and thankfulness, while Jack's sought to read her soul. She came forward with one step and took hold of his two hands, surprised out of herself. She was nearly as tall as he was, and she could"], [187, "THE NEWSPAPER PARAGRAPH 175 look straight into his brown face, more bizarre than ever when it was working with emotion, as if she distrusted her eyes, as, indeed, she distrusted them for the moment. ' Jack, you have come back safe ! ' she crieel in exultation that was so vibrating with gratitude, it was more pathetic than any lamentation. ' The sea is crossed \u2014 it is all over \u2014 there will be no more parting.' If one can imagine a human being standing on the eternal shore and hailing a friend after ad the waves and bidows of time are past, the greeting will be hke that which Bennet Gray gave Jack Prior when he returned to her, safe and sound, from the Antipodes. Mortal love cannot say more\u2014 nay, the love is immortal which expresses itself in such simple, universal language. Jack, who had been so easily touched by Susie's welcome, was moved to his heart's core when truth itself, and love stronger than death, thus met him. He could have humbled him self in the dust for his doubts \u2014 his disbelief in"], [188, "BURIED DIAMONDS 176 this woman who had honoured him with her pure, tender, deep affection, restrained and scarcely shown hitherto, only leaping up and bursting its bounds at the sudden shock of his presence. He kept her two hands in his, and kissed them before he kissed her hps, and said again awkwardly in his agitation, ' Then you're happy to have me back, Bennet, little worth as Iam?' ' Happy ! ' she too exclaimed reproachfully, with her head against his breast ; ' if this is happiness, I have never known what it is to be happy before. It is not a question of being little or much worth, Jack, it is of being ad the world to one joyful woman.' Then her generous heart flew straight to another whose share in her joy Bennet was more inchned to hug than to spurn. 'How glad Mrs. Brior must have been at your arrival. Do you know, I am a httle sorry that I did not see the meeting with your mother ? but, per haps, she would prefer it unseen. And did"], [189, "THE NEWSPAPER PARAGRAPH 177 Tommy know you again? Did the dear old beast leap up to your head ? ' ' I have not seen my mother yet,' he said, more gravely than he had before spoken ; for he had done her wrong, and he had wronged his mother also, while he was aware of diffi culties at home which would not be improved by the disaster to Lambert Crabtree. Bennet, though she had by an incomprehensible arrange ment been living in the house for the last six months, could not clearly understand these difficulties. He tried to shake off his gravity. ' The dear old beast, as you cad him \u2014 to think Tommy should be a personal acquaintance of yours, Bennet \u2014 has had no opportunity of so much as licking my feet, which he abased him self to do the last time I saw him.' A throb of pride which was half a pang of pain swelled her bosom. She was the one woman, supplanting all others \u2014 even his oldest and best friend \u2014 to whom he had come first to announce his arrival, by a right and natural VOL. II.

Yet she had a sense as if she had defrauded, as well as deceived, the woman who had known and loved him so much longer, to whom he was so much, who had O \u25a0* ' been so good to her \u2014 Bennet. She looked up wistfully in his face, prepared to urge him to quit her and go at once to Eedcot, while he was pursuing a totally different line of thought. 'What made you go and be a governess at Eedcot, of all places, Beunet? ' he asked. ' Was it for my sake ? How did it come about ? ' ' Why, I told you the whole story in my letter,' she answered quickly. ' What letter ? ' he inquired as quickly. ' I did not get a letter from you except the one on landing. I accounted for it by your not having any settled address to which you could write until I got to Tumut, where I did not wait for the arrival of the mail.

He had no fear of that news now, and no devouring c uriosity to hear it ; but he felt it would be a satisfaction to him to pour out to this sympathetic listener some part of his story, what he had suffered since he set foot iu England acain. ' I went to Miss Burton, from r: whom you said I could always hear tidings of you in case of any difficulty,' he said, a httle reproachfully, ' and the deuce was in it, Bennet dear, I cannot think what came over your IT 2"], [192, "180 BURIED DIAMONDS friend. She owned you had left Berkshire ; but not another word could I get out of her, till she waited and took counsel with some other schoolmistress, I suppose,' complained Jack resentfully. ' You rude boy, you forget that I am a schoolmistress,' cried Bennet, bubbling over with laughter. But Jack was too full of his grievance to apologise. ' What business had she to keep back the knowledge from me, when she was aware that I had a right to hear ? She would not even say where you were gone or what you were doing. She put me out horribly; any fellow would have been nonplussed ; I cannot tell what she did not tempt me to think.' ' Oh, dear old foolish Jack,' cried Bennet again, rather relishing the ddemma in which she had not been involved, that, hke the voyage to Australia, was over and done with ; ' and oh, poor dear Mary, how you must have taken"], [193, "THE NEWSPAPER PARAGRAPH 181 her by surprise, and frightened and bewildered her. I hope you did not stay long, Jack, or argue loudly in the schoolmistress's parlour \u2014 Mary is so prudent and particular.' ' Very prudent and particular,' grumbled Jack ; ' but the qualities strike me as slightly overstrained and morbid.' ' For one thing, she knew that I was at Eeelcot \u2014 where, by the way, she did not ap prove of my going, unless the family knew everything \u2014 she could not tell how you would receive the information.' 'She might have tried to find out. She might have guessed that I should ascertain it for myself the moment I went home. She had better have prepared me,' retorted Jack. ' Perhaps,' admitted Bennet, ' but I dare say you did not ted her you were going home.' ' I told her nothing I could help,' acknow ledged Jack. ' I was too much taken aback. I was completely knocked on the head, and in too great a rage.'"], [194, "BURIED DIAMONDS 182 ' There, you see, you were as bad as poor Mary, and she had other things weighing upon her mind which I know she did not like to mention without getting liberty. No doubt she believed she ought to leave it to the person principally concerned to tell her secrets at her own time and in her own way.' Bennet was smiling all over like a chdd. There was little question she would break to Jack in the pleasantest fashion a certain matter Mary Burton had declined to impart which would work a revolution in the lovers' affairs. Not a word had been said of Mat Crabtree ; not a syllable of his attendance on Bennet the night of the ball. Indeed, she had as yet a confused idea of the precise date of Jack's arrival, the length of his stay at the Bank House, and the manner in which he had em ployed his time there. Susie's malicious gossip, and what had appeared confirmation strong at the time, faded into a trifle light as air before Bennet's welcome, in Jack's mind. He was not"], [195, "THE NEWSPAPER PARAGRAPH 183 only quite content without further explanation ; he had a wholesome dislike to enter on the subject in detail. Since he was restored to his right mind he had a tolerably correct realisation of the light in which a right-minded, high spirited woman like Bennet Gray would view his doubts and suspicions. She would regard them as smad honour to him and no compli ment to her. The moment Bennet was about to introduce a different element into the conversation, the steps and voices of Mat Crabtree and Jane Prior were heard approaching, and the pair in the httle sitting-room were conscious of nothing save a shy inclination to draw apart from each other. Mat Crabtree had told Jane of the robbery of his brother's bank, and of her brother's return. He had even found time to say some words which, if his mind and Jane's had been sufficiently disengaged, might have sounded equady significant and astonishing, though they"], [196, "BURIED DIAMONDS 184 had not been breathed till that day \u2014 that there was a previous acquaintance between Jack Prior and Miss Gray, who were awaiting the others in the old lodging. But Jane, who was matter-of-fact and straightforward to excess, was too overwhelmed by the first communica tion to pay much attention to what followed. She knew enough of the reckless extravagance of the Lambert Crabtrees ; she had too plainly before her mind's eye Susie as she had appeared at the ball two nights before, in glaring contrast to what might be just coming on her and her husband, not to have a tolerably clear convic tion that the misfortune of the robbery meant subsequent ruin and disgrace to Jane's sister and brother-in-law. Jane's honest, honourable nature shrank from the pictures thus placed side by side. She looked in Mat Crabtree's face, and saw how the lines about the eyes and the mouth had deepened, as if by a miracle of the Great Graver's chisel, since her friend had parted"], [197, "THE NEWSPAPER PARAGRAPH 185 from her in high glee last evening. She saw further, for she held a talisman which rendered her eyes keen here ; she recognised what others might have overlooked \u2014 a deadly sickness of apprehension, a haggard horror of the shame that another day or hour might bring forth, which ought not to have lurked on a good man's face and voice behind a veil of decent composure and ordinary comment and surmise. Her own heart was ready to faint at that under current of expression which she detected coming and going on Mat Crabtree's countenance and in his tones. Before the misery of it she had little notice to spare to the facts of the sudden turning up of Jack as a roving brother, who, like a rolling stone, gathered no moss, with the additional abrupt intimation that he had known Miss Gray 'all the time.' Yet oddly, Miss Gray had not chosen to mention the acquaint ance, which had been made somewhere at some time before she came to Eedcot ; it might have been in a previous state of existence for"], [198, "186 BURIED DIAMONDS anything that Jane knew or cared to know for the moment, when all the world seemed turning upside down, and nobody could tell what might happen next. Jane only heard the vague announcement in a faint, faraway manner, like a truth communicated in a dream. It aroused no other feeling than a dull, sore sense that Miss Gray had a superfluity of mysterious acquaintanceships, and unadmitted, unaccounted for incidents in her past. But that was her affair, and possibly Mr. Crabtree's ; it was certainly not Jane's. A more definite impression was preiduccd on Jane by the circumstance that when she came hurrying in with Mat Crabtree, went up to Jack, and hastily bestowed on him a sisterly kiss, as a necessary accompaniment to the half-mechanical questions, ' When did you come, Jack ? Why have you followed us ? ' then sat down, looked round with her blanched face, and demanded generally, ' Isn't it dread ful ? A bank robbery 'at Newton ! What"], [199, "THE NEWSPAPER PARAGRAPH \u25a0'- will Susie have done ? ' Miss Grav uttered an exclamation, as if the word had ad the rousing freshness of novelty to her. ' A robbery ! ' she cried. ' What robbery ? When and where did it happen ? You dont mean to say it had to do with Mr. Lambert Crabtree's bank ? ' Explanations ensued, everybody speaking at once, but through the hubbub the thought crossed Janes pre-occupied mind. \u25a0 Mr. Crab tree said he left Jack at the door here. He must have had ten minutes in which to renew his acquaintance with Miss Gray, yet he never told her of the robbery at Newton, of which the greater part of England must be talking this morning What could they have found to speak about which occupied them so com pletely that a bank robbery only a day old, happening to Jack's brother-in-law's bank, and when, as it transpired, Jack himself was sleep ing in the Bank House on the very night in question, should be passed over like the most common trivial cxcuiTence ? '"], [200, "BURIED DIAMONDS 188 After a brief consultation with Bennet, Jane made known their determination not to go on with their examination, but to return with Mr. Crabtree and Jack. Mat Crabtree, with a pained recollection \u2014 almost fatherly in its tender consideration of the enthusiastic preparation for the examina tion, of the high hopes with which the candidates had come up, and of yesterday's proud parade of Oxford, tried languidly to combat the resolution. But he could not avoid the perception that the women's minds were upset. He had to grant that it was better to withdraw than fail. He had even to yield to the secret, unpalatable conviction that Jane recoiled from further publicity to her family at this crisis.

' Seen the papers ? Heard of the bank robbery at Newton, in shire ? Most audacious thing of the kind that has happened for a long time. Bankers, had better look sharp.' Sometimes the remarks were more personal. Crabtree's Bank was mentioned, and Mat Crabtree began to wince at the association of the two words, while his companions felt conscious and uncomfortable. A knowing stranger was heard to observe, 'The banker's having been absent was a dooced un lucky coincidence \u2014 I should not like to be the fedow,' then Mat Crabtree frowned heavily aud Jane Prior felt furious for him. It was that strangest experience which comes to some of us in the course of our lives, which strikes us with a curious disembodied sensation \u2014 as if we were dead and buried, and the surviving world were discussing us and our affairs im partially over our graves.

Jack Prior said least of all, which was not like him, for he had naturally plenty to say, and when a burden had been lifted off his mind, he might have been expected to show himself diffuse in his lightness of heart. He only declared, in answer to questions, that, except for the Bank House's having been repainted, the place was the same on the night he had slept there as it had always been. He was not prepared with the slightest statement of anything that had happened where he was concerned. He said this a little impatiently and doggedly, as if it annoyed him to be brought into the story, and as if he did not wish his mind to dwell on his personal contact with it, which was a mere accident. Indeed, Jack had happier things to think of. His course was not clear, so far as he saw, by any means. But the simple fact that he vol. 11. 0"], [206, "BURIED DIAMONDS 194 had been grossly mistaken in his temporary misjudging of Bennet Gray, together with their present relations to each other, was joy to him.

Bennet was stid happier than Jack, in spite of her sympathy with Mr Crabtree and Jane, and her alarmed, vague comprehension that there was sorrow on its way to ad the Priors through the robbery of Mr. Lambert Crabtree's bank. But she herself could not be very sorry \u2014 not on this day, which had brought back Jack to her. How brave and manly, and a thousand times better than handsome, he looked. But for that matter he was ' handsomely ugly ' ; he had turned the corner and arrived at that pitch of plain looks which is as good as beauty, and has a more unique attraction. Besides, beauty fades, whilst Jack's ugliness would never fade. Dear, short, broad, hard favoured Jack, his mother's darhng and hers !

She had shown far greater courageous self-denying application and diligence, she had no particular reason to feel proud of him according to the common standard. Yet she had honest pride and delight in his truth and disinterestedness. She so longed that he should have the full credit of the qualities, and they were so sweet to her that she dallied still with her secret and kept it back, though it could not be much longer withheld, especially when Mr. Crabtree was privy to it.

True, it was Jack his father pitched upop \u2014 Jack, who knew nothing, whose scatter brains, where the grave conduct of his life had been in question, would not have been likely to have either profited or suffered by any amount of business knowledge.

Jack complied with his father's request"], [249, "A JOINT ERRAND 237 without offering an objection, though he had reasons of his own which made Newton and Crabtree's Bank highly distasteful to him that morning.

He would even have been thankful for an opportunity of com ing to an explanation with his mother or Jane. But neither among Jack's attractive qualities, nor among his failings, had there been de veloped hitherto a facility in saying No ; and, as he looked more directly at his father when he was speaking to him, a painful conviction smote upon Jack. How his father had aged since he (Jack) had gone away, and how terribly cut up the governor must be about this abominable robbery !

He was secretly pleased that his father had not been above applying to him for the smallest assistance which had been John Prior's repedent attitude to his son formerly. Jack wished to Heaven he had not been such a heedless ass, and had been a little more comfort to his father. So the young squire of Eedcot rode in betimes on a sultry, cloudy, summer morning to Newton, and there he saw such a sight as amidst more personally overwhelming spectacles he never afterwards forgot. In the first place, he met Mat Crabtree also on horseback. He had turned aside, and was spurring along in order to intercept John Prior or his representa tive. The road was not iu general much frequented, leading, as it did, only to a few scat tered country houses and cottages, and as vet"], [251, "A JOINT ERRAND 239 there were not many wayfarers.

Jack Prior could only mutter he was sorry, without any absorbing pity for his brother in-law. He had a tolerable share of what was likely to be the public s sweeping condemnation of the man who had bidden for its favour swaggeringly and with a fair amount of success, whde the delusion lasted. 'The worst of it is Coplestone's bonds.' said Mat Crabtree, almost with a groan, fain to make a clean breast of it, even to no more qualified a councidor than Jack Prior, before the two entered on the sharp contest.

Mat Crabtree ground the last words through his teeth. ' That is about the sum-total of what I am able to do for the sufferers by the fadure of Crabtree's Bank.' Not a word had Mat Crabtree or Jack Prior spoken of Bennet Gray ; not a thought had they spent on her. For, though love stands between birth and death the greatest earthly factor in human existence, the giant power is at rest for long intervals and does not by any means pervade every idea and action of the man. The two riders were already on the outskirts of the town where it was entered from the railway station. As the men came in sight of the road, 'Look there, Jack,' said Mat Crabtree, indicating numerous groups of old and young, men and women, some of them in working clothes, the pedestrians making their way as fast as they could hurry towards the church end of the High Street, in which the bank stood.

At the date of its establishment there had been no other bank in the place, and the gentleman who founded the firm, a man at once sagacious and kindly, had afforded the greatest facihties which the laws and customs of banking would allow for the use of the bank by the smad est admissible depositors, thus antedating die savings bank, which had only taken a slight hold on Newton.

But, as the couple slowly made their way in the centre of the throng, even Jack Prior, who was much less at home in Newton than Mat Crabtree, could not fail to identify homely figures striving for precedence with a strange, tragic element of fixedness and fatality of circumstance in their very convulsive eager ness. Yonder was the big old yeoman, more slouching in figure and less ruddy in colour than formerly, who had sold his inheritance of Ladslove for deliverance from a debt which he had never contracted unless in becoming surety for its payment. What was left over of the purchase money had set him up as a coal agent. But even the Bank House patron- age had not caused the leased coalyard, so grimy an exchange for the paternal fields, to flourish. It flourished the less, doubtless, because the ale-house had become the more congenial resort to the broken-down man."], [266, "BURIED DIAMONDS 254 The coal bank was pledged already, and if the slender store of ready-money in Crabtree's Bank were gone also, the ex-yeoman was in a worse condition than a day labourer, who could hire himself out to-morrow and earn enough by the sweat of his brow to keep his wife and sick daughter from starving. The elderly woman in a thick jacket and battered straw bonnet, who was squaring her shoulders and elbowing a path for herself like a man, was Widow Maxey, who had been left an unprotected female with a house full of young children a quarter of a century before. The family's sole means of support were the horse aud cart with which her late husband had driven coals from the Kershaw heaps, before the railway and the agencies which had sprung up in its track had come into play. She had been a comely young woman then, when she put her shoulder to the wheel and entered the ranks of the carters. She had grown weather-beaten, and learned to smoke"], [267, "A BROKEN BANK 255 a tobacco-pipe in self-defence against the elements, but had shown no worse signs of deterioration. On the contrary, she had main- tained a spotless reputation which no man lared assad, in her Amazonian occupation and surroundings. But toil and exposure had told upon her robust constitution, so that she had aged rapidly, and had been forced by rheu- matism to resign her seat at the head of the cart, yield her whip to a half-grown lad, her son, and return, perforce, to the corner of the hearth. It had become as much alien ground to her as it would have been to a man over- taken by infirmity, cut off from an active out- of-doors life, and reduced to hang about the house, in which he was a useless and listless supernumerary. Widow Maxey had only be come reconciled to her abdication because, as was wed known, she had remained in pos session of the sinews of war \u2014 that is the actual proprietorship of the horse and cart, in addi tion to her savings. She had been for years"], [268, "BURIED DIAMONDS 256 proposing to lay the savings out in the purchase of a new horse, to replace the worn out animal which had in its turn replaced her husband's old mare. She had held frequent solemn consultations on the important trans action, which was never likely to take place, with Jack Prior, for she was one of Jack's Kershaw acquaintances. He dreaded to meet her eye now, as if he was at the bottom of her cruel disappointment. It was still harder for Mat Crabtree than for Jack in the melee, since Mat not only knew dozens where Jack knew one person involved, but these persons, by common consent, appealed to the squire of Haybridge to see justice done. It was exactly what he was seeking to do, but in a far less effectual manner than they were quick to conceive. They knew him as one of the Crabtrees, who had always owned the bank ; nay, as the elder brother of the banker. Mat had a name for liberality and kindness, and the suppliants could not realise how"], [269, "A BROKEN BANK 257 powerless he was in the emergency. 'You'll see us paid, Mr. Crabtree, won't ye ? ' was the unanimous, importunate cry. ' We might never have had ought to do with the bank if it had not been for your name \u2014 the name of your father, as was well known far aud uear fora just and honourable gentleman, the friend of the people.

A long, lean man, a gardener, who had been conspicuous for his aggressive respecta bility and the crustiness which has distin guished all gardeners since Adam partook of the fatal apple, was the first to be betrayed into sentiment.

As Jack Prior had conjectured, the clock on the church tower close to the bank had not struck the hour for the bank's opening. But the pressure was so great round the building that he had some trouble in following his companion's example. They had to edge in their horses like mounted policemen on a public show-day, so as not to produce another description of panic and stampede, till the riders found themselves stationed as if on guard on each side of the great bank doors. Other horsemen and a variety of vehicles were in attendance, but none had got so far forward, none had been made way for like these two.

From their saddles the two men commanded a sea of heads which filled an open space into which the street suddenly spread after the fashion of some old-world streets. It left room for a smad green, with an old elm in the centre, and behind it the parish church, with its square Norman tower. This was the aristo cratic as well as the ecclesiastical centre of Newton. Good old houses, with white facings round the long French windows, and pillared entrances to extensive gardens, marked the quarter. The house next the church was the vicarage, other houses belonged to the prin cipal doctor, the principal lawyer, the retired military and naval officers \u2014 a few specimens of whom are generally found settled in a country town.

The train had arrived with the London newspapers, and in the list of bank rupts figured the name of ' James Metcalfe, Gentleman.' This was the bank partner to whom Mat Crabtree had referred in conver sation with Jack Prior half an hour before as a man who cut a dash like Lambert, who had been going at such a pace for years that only a bank behind him could have kept him up.

It was clearly understood that as an issue from the bank they were utterly rejected, till their credit should be restored, if that day ever dawned.

' We'll be fair enough if your brother the banker act fairly to us,' was called back roughly in the passion of the moment, and the squire of Haybridge stiffened into silence as before. Jack extricated himself and his horse, and lingered on the outskirts of the company. He was fain to see the end of the day's work, whether the eager flow would relieve the current eddying in one elirection with fatal con centration \u2014 whether the supply would meet the demand after all.

A muffled roar of baffled desire and despair rose on the heavy air. Men gesticulated furiously. Women hid their faces and wept aloud. Jack could distinguish Mat Crabtree's voice again from where he stdl sat on his horse by the bank-doors. ' Men and women, I can do nothing for you at this moment,' he told those who pulled themselves together to listen. ' Nobody can do anything in the meantime. But go home. Have patience.

He was likely enough to display the unrepentant prodigal's alacrity in repairing to his injured relations \u2014 not to say that he has sinned, but to dare them to dissever the tie they- did not knot, which has long been a whip to scourge them.

Mat Crabtree rode with bent head and a weight upon his breast, locking neither to his sheep on the hill nor to his cattle in the meadows.

All the rosiness had gone out of Mat Crab tree's face when he confronted his visitor. Mat was paler than the sallow invalid. When the latter looked at honesty abashed in the person of his host, he rose gallantly to the occasion, and played a soldier and man's part in remembering old friendship, and showing himself just in awarding blame only where blame was due. ' Never mind, Mat,' he said, wringing the hand he had to take ; ' it is not so bad that it cannot be borne. I heard from my solicitor the day after I landed that the bonds were a missing.

Perhaps it is best for them, after all.' ' I wish I could change places with you, Jem Coplestone, I do indeed,' was Mat's sole reply. But the generous forbearance ofthe injured man did the other good and helped him to judge less harshly and be less resentful with regard to his own share of the wrong which had been inflicted so unsparingly.

The merciful blue sky was overhead. There was only a soft bank of pearly clouds far to the south to show where the storm rack had rolled. Mat was riding to a railway station, but not to Newton. As it happened, he had taken a road which his brother and he had often traversed together as boys, when they went to say their lessons with the vicar's sons at the neighbouring vicarage.

How had he fulfilled his obligation when his brother and he had drifted so far apart ? Had he, the elder, been high-handed, domineering, impatient ? He had been a scholar, while Lambert was but a sorry student. He recalled his affront at the lad's deficiencies, though it was small blame to Lambert that he had not been endowed with the pondering brains which make men book-learned. Would that the lack were the worst which could be laid at Lambert's door to-day.

How would it have been if he had been larger-hearted, more liberal minded, as a love of truth and knowledge ought to have made him ? Where was Lambert now ?

As Jack looked round him he was assailed by fragmentary recollections of trying interviews with the head of the house following hard upon youthful delinquencies, especially by that most painful tete-a-tete when Jack had to divulge to his father the extent of his college failures and debts. John Prior himself had for once forgotten the unpalatable past in the grievous present. 'And so it is ended,' he kept saying, as he walked up and down the room. ' Crabtree's Bank is broken.

Jack's presence served two purposes. He had not much know ledge of business \u2014 indeed, his father had always resented his son's ignorance in this respect \u2014 but he knew a good deal more than the women. He was, in proportion, a better qualified listener to the calculations and speculations which the stoppage of Crabtree's Bank called forth from every man in the district.

Susie, who ought to have been the most smitten by the ruin of the bank and tortured by the uncertainty of her position, took everything quietly, and was, unless by fits and starts when she elected to bewail herself as a martyr, remarkably cool and composed.

There was no occasion for Jane's mounting her high horse and calling for redress to pillaged shop keepers. Miss Gray had a fine faculty for being struck dumb, but it was wasted in the present instance. She, Susie, wished that Lamb were only at Eedcot to laugh a little at their doleful, angry faces. However much or little of her assurances Susie believed, it was evident that she attached no significance to her husband's continued absence. Yet the other women were beginning suspiciously to avoid reference to it.

From the moment of the betrayal which Jack's blunder had brought about the preceding evening, a door had been closed and an iron bolt drawn, shutting out all save the most formal intercourse between the two women, who, in spite of the difference in their ages, had so much in common, and had been so strongly attracted towards each other.
