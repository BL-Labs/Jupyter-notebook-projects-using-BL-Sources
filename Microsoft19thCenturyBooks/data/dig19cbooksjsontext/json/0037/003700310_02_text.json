IELLFIELD was at last in such glory as Cinderella was in after the fairy had transported her to the Prince's ball. One would scarce have known the little de pendent town, when private carriages, smart grooms with riding-horses, and groups of county paladins, were for ever stopping the way. It was a season looked forward to alike by the young squire, bent on running his cherished, paddocked three-year-old, in fond trial for the further honours of the Derby day and the Oaks; by the young aristo- VOL.

Of course, the Wellfield races were only a mild version and small abridged edition of the great races. Indeed, they were almost a private institution of the Exmoor family, maintained by them for the improvement of horse-flesh and horsemanship, and, per haps somewhat like the gladiator shows of old Rome, to keep the people in good hu mour. They were a healthy primitive in-"], [13, "Wellfield in its Glory. 3 stitution, running a little, of. course, into the narrow byway of patronage and partisan ship, only, however, to keep the more clear of the flood-gates of riot and excess. But it is due to their patriarchal character to re cord, that they were in a great measure free from the vices of race weeks and race courses. Lord Exmoor used all his influence to con fine the Wellfield races to their original in tention. The result was, that, though emi nently respectable, they would have proved slightly tame dowager races to highly sea soned palates. But they were sources of simple enjoyment and pride to their noble promoter, and of solid advantage and plea surable excitement to the Wellfield towns men, with the specialty that few people con nected with them suffer from a bad taste in their mouths for weeks or even months after wards. As to sport, the Wellfield races bore about the same relation to the Ches- b 2"], [14, "Noblesse Oblige. 4 ter week, the Epsom, the Doncaster, or the Newmarket, as an old-fashioned, discreet carpet-dance does to a huge heterogeneous public ball. In the exigency of the inroad of company, Brockcotes and the neighbouring country houses were literally filled from top to bot tom. The Exmoor Arms and the Wrio thesley Branch Hotel were likewise cram med. Naturally enough, the applicants for bed and board did not have recourse to the Temperance Hotel till every other refuge failed them, and only the bond fide working men, and, indeed, not very many of them, quartered themselves in the Working Man's Rights' Tavern, which uttered its small plucky protest against the tyrannous order of nobles, and dragged out a semi-socialist, semi-chartist, but languishing and spasmodic life, which would have collapsed entirely ere this had it not been indebted once and"], [15, "Wellfield in its Glory. 5 again to the secret forbearance and aid of Lord Exmoor. The private houses of the town were pressed into the service. The best families in Wellfield opened their doors on the plea of obliging Lord Exmoor, while they did not repudiate the liberal pecuniary douceur for their hospitalities. Elderly spinsters like Miss Rowe were thus enabled to in dulge without inconvenience in additional kettledrums for the rest of the year ; while large families like the Medlars could afford late sea-side trips and new campaigns in the wide, wealthy field of Folksbridge, and in the wider, wealthier field of London, during the winter and the spring. Even people who no longer needed an addition to their incomes, like Mrs. Wooler and Mr. Moss man, did not like to feel stuck-up and unso cial. So they \" let \" their houses, to be neighbour-like. All were rewarded by a"], [16, "Noblesse Oblige. 6 little high-life experience, both above and below stairs, on which they could draw till they got a fresh stock next race-time, and which completely superseded and cast into the shade such old sources as those of Miss Rowe, with her naval and military authori ties. Thus, although the people of Wellfield were compressed into back-parlours and attic bed-rooms for six days, to admit of accommodating the distinguished strangers, the compression was so universal, and was so magnanimously borne, that it became like the old squeeze at the play and the race-ball \u2014 one of the racy, informal charms of the gaiety. On the eve of the Wellfield races the townsmen and their families were quite prepared for their full bit of pleasure, and, in the meantime, feasted their eyes and ears on the nicest tit-bits of aristocratic gossip."], [17, "Wellfield in its Glory. 7 Mr. Dick Vernon and Miss Dugdale had been seen riding alone together, like bro ther and sister ; and she was not even his cousin, as she was Lord Wriothesley's ; be sides, she was spoken of for the last, in the shade and retirement of the Brockcotes Mall, before breakfast. Young Lady Lucy Ingram had positively gone back to Miss Rowe's in the sulks that morning, and would not enter her carriage, after she had put her foot on the step, because of the smell of cigars, Mr. Ingram having taken it upon him to shut himself up in it and smoke as he returned alone from dining at Brock cotes the evening before. Old Mr. Edge cumbe had swallowed three raw eggs to his coffee, after Mrs. Paston had taken care to provide him with a sweet pigeon-pie and a pair of beauties of cutlets. Ph\u0153be enjoyed the commotion immense ly, perhaps all the more because of her girl's"], [18, "Noblesse Oblige. 8 trouble just past, although even this brilliant exceptional life had its rubs for her. Barty Wooler and his loss might sit lightly on her conscience, but Mrs. Paston, though she en joyed the race-week in her own way, was even more plaintively helpless than usual, and more impressed with her responsibility in having to answer for two persons with minds of their own, and with odd ways. But, notwithstanding this impression of her mother's, Ph\u0153be, at least, consistently pro tested that she was exactly like other peo ple. Mr. Paston, who hated bustle and excitement, although he loved spectacles, was out of spirits and out of looks, and sometimes his appearance struck Ph\u0153be re proachfully in the midst of her experience and light-heartedness. By his looks and ab sent ways, he forced her to think, with a pang, that she, who was his Ph\u0153be, his friend and pet, had thwarted and vexed him,"], [19, "Wellfield in its Glory. 9 however inadvertently and inevitably on her part. Ph\u0153be was foolish enough to have a little regret that her family were to have no more novel and interesting guests than Mr. and Mrs. Edgecumbe, of Appleby, who had stayed in Wooers' Alley for the races almost ever since Ph\u0153be could remember. And this, notwithstanding that the Edgecumbes had been very generous and kind to her, so long as she had been a child, in gifts of flowers and fruit, in coral necklaces and turquoise lockets ; though, it must be con fessed, they were not immaculate in other respects, but had been rather a sad couple in their young days, and only passed muster now because of rank and age wiping out follies. Ph\u0153be would have liked that they should have had young Lady Lucy Ingram, the last married county lady, who had come to St."], [20, "Noblesse Oblige. 10 Basil's in bridal white silk, and even now wore no wrap more sombre than ermine ; or, when gentlemen preponderated, that they should have had some of Lord Wriothes ley's friends, who would swear less, and drink less, than Mr. Edgecumbe ; who would wear delicate French-grey, and picturesque heather-brown morning coats, instead of Mr. Edgecumbe's faded and bat tered tweed frock-coat, like nothing in the world so much as a singed sheep-skin ; and who would be gay and gallant, with a polite reserve, where Mr. Edgecumbe was either glum, or, without meaning offence, boister ously free. But although Lord Wriothesley had lots of friends dropping in, for the purpose of killing two dogs with one bone, \u2014 by attend ing the Wellfield races (which might taste a little like cheese-curd), and shooting in the Brockcotes preserves, about which"], [21, "Wellfield in its Glory. 11 there could not be two opinions \u2014 he did not bring his friends near Wooers' Alley, al though he had to promenade Wellfield in search of a lodging, with waifs and strays for whom he could not find the form of a resting-place in the loftiest bachelor's retreat at Brockcotes, and that within five minutes of the first dressing-bell. He rather worked upon the fidelity and humanity of Mr. Med lar to allow mattresses, mirrors, and basins to encumber the very sacred precincts of the bank, morning and evening, for the first three days. It was not that Lord Wriothesley was re sentful at having been gently warned off from the painter's quarters. Nor did he seem to conclude that the Pastons had no sym pathy with aristocratic jockeys. So far from that, he came out of the cigar-shop in the High Street and stopped Ph\u0153be for three minutes to tell her that in one race he was"], [22, "Noblesse Oblige. 12 going to show in silk himself, just to support the jockeys. \"Aren't we right, Miss Paston?\" said his lordship, quite frankly. \" The Countess does not object. She is to wait till the last sweepstakes but one to-morrow for the pur pose of seeing her son beaten. Lady Doro thea is to be there, having a notion that races are patriotic and political, like the Olympic games. She holds that it is worth a man's while to be a winner, even on the Wellfield course. Remember, Miss Paston, that it is the last sweepstakes but one to morrow, and that my colours are white and coral, like your jacket and studs.\" Still Lord Wriothesley did not humour Ph\u0153be's girlish hankering for the mere acci dental association with spirited magnificent race-goers who might frequent Wooers' Alley. At least he was not tempted by any levity of spirit, or any craving for confirmation of his"], [23, "Wellfield in its Glory. 13 taste, to transfer Lord Dacre, Bob Bertie, Dick Vernon, Mr. Edmund Blount, or any man save Frank Hall, from the highly cul tivated artificial parterres of Brockcotes to the comparatively virgin soil of Wooers' Alley. Ph\u0153be did not always know what to make of Mrs. Edgecumbe. She would have the girl in to talk to her when she was by her self, for Mrs. Edgecumbe had a great dis like to getting low. To keep herself from getting low was one of the great objects of her life, and the public held that she was remarkably successful in this. She would be very condescending and indulgent to Ph\u0153be on these occasions, but, as Lady Dorothea had said, she occasionally let out strange experiences, which it distressed and scared the young girl to hear. \" Ph\u0153be Paston,\" Mrs. Edgecumbe would say, \" I like you, because you have an idea"], [24, "Noblesse Oblige. 14 in your head. One can see it in your eye, and a very good eye it is, child, if you only knew how to use it.\" At this Ph\u0153be would colour and turn away her head, but this would only provoke Mrs. Edgecumbe to a stronger assertion of her opinion. \"Yes, Ph\u0153be Paston, I have known eyes not half so good as yours draw down showers of diamonds and pearls \u2014 real jewels, mind you \u2014 as grand as those in the Devonshire tiara, or the Brockcotes necklace they speak so much of. But I must confess to you I don't know that they made their possessor much richer in the long run. I have heard they all turned to pebbles and slate stones on the green cloth. You see, she was a French dancer, and she was as fond of play as your cat is of fish. I knew her when she was a friend of Lord Dacre's father, and he was very soft and sweet upon"], [25, "Wellfield in its Glory. 15 her. We used to have rnerry parties all to gether at Richmond \u2014 not very proper, but nobody went in so much for propriety in those days ; how could we, when Mrs. Fitz herbert was received by the Court at Brighton, and Lady Conyngham went everywhere? There was my old man Edgecumbe too, who was not my old man then, for the Dean's sister had not divorced him yet, and Chin Bagot, my first husband, was not dead \u2014 everybody called him Chin, and I don't know how he could take it amiss, for his chin, though it was ever so large and knotty, like the handle of a stout blackthorn walk ing-stick, was, after all, the most harmless point about him.\" Ph\u0153be could not help looking her sur prise at the old lady's manner of speak ing, if she did not venture to express any objection ; but Mrs. Edgecumbe put aside looks."], [26, "Noblesse Oblige. 16 \"Tut, child, what makes you look scared? Chin Bagot is dead now, poor soul, and we must not speak ill of him. Edgecumbe and I never do, though we do not fear his memory, for the man was his own worst enemy. Oh ! young country lasses of your sort are like novices, Ph\u0153be Paston ; and that is why I am so fond of them, before even my carpet-work and my dog Crab, when they are pretty and clever, like you, my dear. I am as fond of a pretty girl as ever Edgecumbe was, but a great deal more particular about her being clever. At the same time, Edgecumbe al ways respected parts in a woman, and prin ciples too, where he could find them. He never carried his whiskers and his hands where a woman had either the wit or the will to keep him off \u2014 I will say that for him \u2014 and so I always knew whom to blame.\""], [27, "Wellfield in its Glory. 17 \" Oh, Mrs. Edgecumbe !\" was all Ph\u0153be could say to this lax speech. \" You need not go, Ph\u0153be. Edgecumbe never comes from the ordinary till it is late, and when his son Struan is here, Edge cumbe is the latest of all. He must wait, you know, till the ill-mannered prig has retired, and Edgecumbe can say to his com panions, ' Now that the old man is gone, boys, we'll have another cobwebbed bottle. I always send a contribution from my own binns to the ordinary, so that you need not fear Derby-day champagne or Epsom mo selle.' His man generally puts him to bed after that, whether drunk or sober. Hughes can manage him ; he is easily managed now. And I tell you he would not annoy you, girl, for, rough as the squire is, he was a man of breeding in his day, and knew when he was in the presence of a lady and an honest woman, whether she was his own c i<rvoL. ii."], [28, "Noblesse Oblige. 18 wife or another's. That was more than could be said for all kings and royal dukes. But my tongue goes too fast, Ph\u0153be ; I see that by your face. But remember, you little saucebox, that you know nothing of what the world was when a certain terrible old man, blind of an eye and deaf of an ear, sat, within the memory of people I knew, in his balcony in Piccadilly, with a parasol over his head, and neither decency nor ruth in his one eye. Yet seventy wo men, of all ranks, were found in England to cover his shameless deathbed with their notes of inquiry and condolence.\" Mrs. Edgecumbe's conversation had a high flavour, and Ph\u0153be really shrank more from it than from encountering the purple faced, gouty, chuckling, cursing squire. As for Lord Wriothesley's friends, they merely glanced aside at the painter's pretty daugh ter, with a passing wonder, if Wriothesley,"], [29, "Wellfield in its Glory. 19 made of flesh and blood, were the least in the world smitten by his sister's friend. Only, it must be confessed, that Mr. Ed mund Blount was bold enough to stare Ph\u0153be out of countenance, in turning upon her his own swarthy, sodden face, with his moustache a TEmpereur. He made Ph\u0153be angry with Lady Dorothea for her partial toleration of him. To think that a girl like LadyDorothea Latimer could put up with such degradation, and almost make terms with such people, all because they were of her class, and in the persons of Blounts ! The concession, Ph\u0153be felt, was unbecoming, and unworthy of Lady Dorothea. Ph\u0153be might have rested content. A hundred, or even fifty years back, this Mr. Edmund Blount would have been dogging her, spying on her, and bribing the giddiest and most stupid of the maidservants in Wooers' Alley to betray her service. Nay, c2"], [30, "Noblesse Oblige. 20 he might even have been waylaying Ph\u0153be in the dusk in the loneliest road near Well field, snatching kisses from her, insulting her, and frightening her out of her wits. Hear how Mrs. Edgecumbe spoke of those gallant adventures in the light of trifles light as air. But all that was over. Mr. Edmund Blount must stoop to much humbler, ruder prey. He must soil himself by the contaminating contact of those who were his equals and su periors in passion, impurity, and grossness, whatever might be their rank, every time he caused a woman to fall, either in appear ance or deed. The utmost he could do to a girl like Ph\u0153be was to create in her an un conquerable antipathy, and a vehement in dignation, by turning into her cool, brown cheek and olive eyes defiant fires of virtue to meet the unhallowed fires which lay smouldering in his prominent, hard eyes, and in the unhealthy flushed blotches on his"], [31, "Wellfield in its Glory. 21 smooth, flaccid cheeks, that no honourable cruise on her Majesty's service, or fresh, free sea-breeze had been able to brace and tan. To think such a fellow, whose antecedents Lady Dorothea slid over in the generalisa tion \" one of our black-sheep,\" should be by marriage entitled to call himself Lady Doro thea's kinsman \u2014 near enough, surely, when he was the heir-presumptive of her husband \u2014 and so to affront and disgrace her in the eyes ofthe country ! But it was not Mr. Ed mund Blount Lady Dorothea was to marry, as Ph\u0153be herself had said. And Ph\u0153be, having no right to raise her voice against the match, was in a measure reconciled to Lady Dorothea's throwing herself away on a well disposed, powerful, young Marquis, with great lands and long descent, but with dis creditable connexions, as some of their de generate fruits. Ph\u0153be gave herself up to a kind of fine despair on the subject. She"], [32, "Noblesse Oblige. 22 believed that there never would be found the man and nobleman quite worthy of the stately, winsome, black-and-white little beauty, the high-hearted, sweet-tempered lady and woman, the faithful daughter, sis ter, and friend."], [33, "On the Course. 23 CHAPTER II. On the Course. IH\u0152BE was at the course in good time on the first day ; although she had a struggle to accomplish this. Mrs. Pas ton, who was curiously balancing herself, in a series of breathless difficulties, would fain have detained her with questions and obser vations till it was too late. Ought it to be the thing to wear her lace on her French cashmere shawl ? Should it be a worked or a plain cambric handkerchief she should hold in her hand to wave when the horses came in at the winning-post? Such were the"], [34, "24 Noblesse Oblige. problems with which Mrs. Paston teased Ph\u0153be, who had announced that she wished to put on her white pique\" gown with the green ruches like riband grass, and held to her original idea (\" rash, headstrong girl as she was in every act of her life I\") though her mother suggested the China silk, which, to be sure, had short sleeves, or the blue grenadine, that was so badly torn the last time she wore it. Mrs. Paston, of course, deemed it a matter of deep and engrossing interest \u2014 nay, something affecting the credit of Wellfield, and the tone of the races, \u2014 that she and Ph\u0153be should appear in becoming ?arb. 5 Ph\u0153be did not choose to avail herself of Lady Dorothea's pass to breathe the air of the grand-stand. With her mother and the wives of the civic dignitaries of Wellfield, she took her place on a lower stand, from which, in the dignity and ease of simplicity,"], [35, "On the Course. 25 she could command a fair sight of the course. The scene was charming to her. She had not arrived at the invidious superiority of the \"forty Miss Medlars,\" who having caught and culled a young man from one of the sets located at some distance, proudly wore the honour on the occasion. This precocious specimen of a Folksbridge sper maceti merchant had run up to town so many times that he had lost count of the number, and freely reckoned that he had gone in a swell-break every season to the Derby. He had come provided with a blue veil hanging down from the brim of his white hat, for which there was no call in the green meadows of Wellfield. This bit of dress it was which chiefly caused him to be pointed at by the Wellfield youngsters as a walking instance of man-millinery; whilst he was supposed, by older and more reflective people, to have borrowed one of the Miss Medlars' veils,"], [36, "26 Noblesse Oblige. which surely argued a degree of intimacy pointing to a marriage among the Miss Med lars at last. Of course the young man was disgusted. There were no favours, neither did the colours of popular riders appear in scarfs thrown across the shoulders of man or wo man ; and hardly anything of the horses was known by the innocents who boasted of having their races every year, and came out to gape at them like so many women and children. There was not a single dead lock, such as occurred in the miles of vehicles wending along Cheap and the Strand, and again at the Elephant and Castle ; there were only a half-dozen or so of really \"nobby\" carriages, with coronets on the panels. Nor was there any chaffing to speak of, except the screeching personalities ofthe horrible Wellfield children. There was nothing, either, in the way of betting,"], [37, "On the Course. 27 save what was of the safest and tamest for a young mercantile gentleman, whom it was impossible to confound either with aristocrats or black-legs. And, worse than all, there was little to refresh and comfort him \u2014 save light fiery sherry, and the host of great Med lar girls, who hampered and harassed him. No wonder the Miss Medlars' man burst out into the reverse of flattering comments long before the middle of the day. He had never been so much taken-in or so much disap pointed in his life \u2014 the Wellfield races were the most despicable trash, without even a local claret-cup. No inducement would make him stay for another day, notwith standing that Mr. and Mrs. Medlar and the Miss Medlars were very kind, and he highly appreciated their hospitalities. Ph\u0153be, not having the disadvantage of being experienced and fastidious, had seen nothing on the Grand Tour to dis-"], [38, "Noblesse Oblige. 28 qualify her for admiring the Wellfield races. The course was no longer two or three rural fields divested of their June wild flowers. It was infinitely gayer than when striped and flecked with poppies and bug loss. It had living brilliance and perpetual motion of men, women, and children, aristo cratic and rustic, in carriage and cart, on horse back and foot. It was a scene cool and grey in its English soberness of costume and bearing, but by no means wanting in warm, juicy bits of colour, and of eager, vigorous action. It showed no want of restraint, strength and fervour. There was a thorough blending of all classes, as in Mr. Frith's pic tures, forming a combination of the most characteristic bits of Watteau, Wouvermann, and Teniers. Nor did it lack a healthy, if somewhat prudish, absence of the rascality and profligacy which crop out largely on the great race-courses. The last feature was"], [39, "On the Course. 29 something like a testimony that running horses, and even winning and losing sweep stakes, did not necessarily lead to what was immoral and depraved. The minister ofthe Independent chapel and his deacons were the only disapproving voices, and two of the latter were credited with being at the course on the sly. But, possibly enough, the Wellfield races were quite undeserving the attention of any gentleman who attended the Derby. The horses entered had not cost, even at the present exorbitant rate of horse-flesh, more than from six hundred to a thousand pounds, and did not carry on the combined heads of themselves and their joc keys more than another thousand \u2014 a very tame affair to those who had seen a portrait of Eclipse, and heard of his most distinguish ed successors.

Neither could she hope to equal the solemn mono tone in which Milly Medlar accompanied Bella's tittering treble, as she prated and prosed about the unlawfulness of race courses, and questioned whether they were rendered more desperately dangerous by bettings of five to one. Milly had been led to believe that there were as many as twen ty to one taken on Bluebottle. She recited the vices of the turf, as she sat there, a pro minent spectator. She drew gusty sighs, shook her head portentously, and never ceased to consult the out-of-sorts young man, and to take his opinion on the lawful ness of the diversion, till he asked himself, in a panic, whether the head of the forty thieves were not flying at him, in thus con spicuously electing him her conscience in"], [41, "On the Course. 31 the room of the High or Low Church parson. The Brockcotes party came upon the ground early, without any effort at eclat, but with the impressiveness inseparable from those who were the sovereigns \u2014 the first objects of the field after the horses and the jockeys. Ph\u0153be had a little solace for her troublesome doubts as to whether Lady Dorothea, who could not err, was doing well for herself in recognising and being able to point out Lord Fairchester in his place of honour in the Countess's phaeton. She even began to have a kind of pleasure in the sight of the couple, and to take her self to task as a fault-finding girl, whose private and selfish motives were at the bot tom of her carping objections to the sever ance of the old tie between her and her friend. At the second or third glimpse, she decided that the heavy-featured, sandy-"], [42, "32 Noblesse Oblige. haired young man might have sense and worth, as well as prestige and great posses- sions. The Countess, to avoid all fuss, took up her position at once in the central front seat of the grand-stand ; and then Lady Doro thea drove Lord Fairchester round the course. Lady Exmoor might, in this case, have saved herself all precaution, for the occupants of the carriage were the real attraction. A withered, elderly woman, were she thrice a countess, could not for the time have competed with such a pair. But Lady Exmoor did not want to compete, proud woman though she was reputed. Clearly, her greatest pride this day was in yielding the palm to her daughter, whose progress she was intently following with her glass in a true mother's style.

He sat with his arms crossed, and now and then stooped to listen with a half smile to Lady Dorothea, who was very much herself, as she tickled the ears of the Coun tess's grey ponies, conducting the conversa tion in an eager monologue \u2014 what Lord Wriothesley called her favourite fashion \u2014 doing the honours of the field, and pointing out local celebrities. When Lady Dorothea discovered Ph\u0153be, the acknowledgment was made with some thing like a radiant flash of consciousness, in addition to the hearty greeting. Accom panying the nod and the smile there was a little special separate speech to Lord Fair chester, who then looked at Ph\u0153be, not at all as his cousin had done, but with a cour teous and kindly interest. Now and again, when the phaeton got into the thronged parts of the course, or into the neighbour hood of animals more restive than the VOL.

Ph\u0153be, in her loyal fondness of her friend, keenly appreciated Lady Dorothea's remembrance of her at such a moment ; and was fain to persuade herself that Lord Fair chester and her ladyship might prove rea sonably suited to each other, and that their progress round the course might be typical of their progress through life. Next to Lady Dorothea and Lord Fair chester, Ph\u0153be and the world of Wellfield gazed with most curiosity on Miss Dugdale of Summerley. She sat in the Countess's party fully aware that she was one of the very select circle \u2014 spoken of by public-spirit ed Lady Dorothea herself as being Countess in the bud \u2014 to whom Lord Wriothesley might justifiably, and with the consent of"], [45, "On the Course. 35 all in authority, fling his handkerchief. Ph\u0153be at once recognised the favoured young lady at the corner of the stand. She was surrounded by a group of gentlemen, and was amiably interesting herself in their betting, till, to initiate so charming an ama teur in its mysteries, they became conde scendingly graphic in the details. Lord Wriothesley was not prominent among these gentlemen, and nobody made way for him when he joined the group, so that there was no plain announcement of a second family alliance with the prospect of its speedy ful filment. Ph\u0153be unhesitatingly hoped this match, with all that depended upon it, would fall to the ground. She looked at Miss Dug dale critically, and she did not like to think of her as the future Countess. Every body around Ph\u0153be was captivated with the young lady's beauty, or style, or suavity.

And no won der ! Such a duck, such a darling, such a jollily beautiful fine lady of a dear !\" Ph\u0153be heard this chorus on every side. Miss Dugdale was the popular beauty. She was far before Lady Penelope and Lady Louisa Blount, who both had a share of Lord Fairchester's heavy irregularity of feature, and of Mr. Edmund Blount's em purpled swarthiness.

Miss Dugdale was even higher in public opinion than the young matron, Lady Lucy Ingram, whose frizzled crop of hair struck the ignorant Wellfield natives as untidy in the dressing, and uncommonly closely allied to carrots in the hue. Indeed, the mass of the spectators disappointed and offended Ph\u0153be very much by thinking little, spirituelle, black-and-white Lady Dorothea not fit to hold the candle, so far as mere beauty went, to languid, ivory-and-carmine tinted Miss Dugdale. Straight were Miss Dugdale's black, silky brows, straight her delicate nose, straight the scarlet thread of her lips.

She watched Miss Dugdale, as in her sweet way she was evincing an immense appetite for general admiration and particular attention. Notwithstanding the regularity of the fea tures, and the vividness of the colouring, Ph\u0153be thought she saw, as if peeping out behind a lovely mask, a certain hard, sensu ousness, indicating a contracted, mean, and stubborn character. This subtle effect ex isted in spite of the contour, which was round with youth. The chin was even inclined to fulness, while the only palpable defects ofthe face were the nearness of the eyes, and a shade of something cynical in the shortness of the upper lip.

There was only one great difference between the stands, and it was of a nature which would have gently titillated and highly gratified Lady Dorothea. Both stands were exposed to the sun, which, for the season, blazed un usually, so that what in the morning was re garded as a golden boon, rising higher and higher in the sky, became after noon a brazen bane.

The wives of the bankers, the attorneys, and the rich tradesmen, on the other hand, perspired at every pore, struggling fatuously, with loosened bonnet-strings, open shawls and jackets, as they plied toy-fans, flowers, and handkerchiefs against their intangible foes. The posting for the race of gentlemen jockeys, for which many persons were wait ing, restored relish to the discussers of the programme.

It might have had the \" not bad \" which John Bull is proud of bestowing on the fine arts, not as mere applause, but as a kind of sedative, with its composing phlegm and pinch of wholesome scorn. Mr. Paston, who had come out on purpose to see the race, and should have known the merit he attributed to it, called it exceeding- ly picturesque. And what with the flood of sunshine in which it was bathed, the beauty of the horses, the half-unconscious mixture of pluck and grace in the riders, the semi fantastic, yet sufficientlyEnglish jockey-dress, here seen to the best advantage, with its boots and tops, buckskins and silk jackets \u2014"], [54, "44 Noblesse Oblige. it must be confessed that there was much to justify Mr. Paston's opinion. Certainly Lord Wriothesley was there in white and coral-red, like Ph\u0153be's jacket and studs.

Though he rode well to look at him, riding was not his business, and his short sight was against him in winning races. He was his own chief mourner, and went first to condole with the Countess on her son's being \"nowhere.\" Alittle while afterwards he happened to pass below the town-stand. Ph\u0153be was not so wise as not to feel a tumult of vanity, of honest pleasure, arch consciousness, and perplexed doubt \u2014 a genuine girlish mixture of sensa tions.

She could not, like the grand dames, remain long under fire and make no sign ; but per haps she was more easily made the happiest of the happy, though she was not allowed to retain the cause of her happiness. Lord Wriothesley hailed one of 'the considerable supply of John Thomases on the ground, and sent him, with gingerly step, to procure and unfurl a carriage-umbrella for Mrs. Paston's benefit.

Cannot peace be made ?\" While he closed with the whisper, \" Tell them Lady Ogle has unfurled her brother-in-law's great Eastern shade which he carried to the very steps of the throne of the Nizam.\" Mrs. Paston, at all events, had the conso lation of dwelling on the young lord's kind intentions, which must have impressed every one within ear-shot ; and she enjoyed the di version of teasing Ph\u0153be, during the hour that remained of the day's races, upon the propriety of taking steps to return the um-"], [58, "Noblesse Oblige. 48 brella \u2014 quite a new and handsome one \u2014 to its owner.

She was indebted to the magnanimity, the mature sense and consider ation of Barty Wooler, for doing his best to give the world the general impression that it had made a mistake in its vague conclu sion respecting the Woolers and the Pastons. But the debt was only an additional burden to her. Frightened, grieved and worried, she asked herself, had she injured this man in any degree ? had she wrought an evil beyond remedy to her father's friend ? and was her tenderness of heart to be wrung by the fancy, whenever it occurred to her, all her life afterwards ?

Ph\u0153be was aware there were men, most ly in the humbler ranks \u2014 rough, natural men \u2014 who were still plainly, as well as wo fully, marred by having come across the wrong woman. There was, for instance, an underkeeper of Lord Exmoor's in whom Lady Dorothea had taken an interest. This had not been a common young man. He was the chief stay of a widow-mother, and of a young family of brothers and sisters, and was so unmistakably the paragon of the night-school, that Lord Exmoor had express ed a doubt whether he was not thrown away"], [70, "60 Noblesse Oblige. as a keeper, and, indeed, had entertained an intention of getting the Brockcotes steward to take him in hand. The young keeper's path was crossed by a girl, certainly neither the most attractive nor the best in Wellfield. Enough that she cast a glamour over the poor young fellow, and aggravated and un settled him. When the mischief was done, she went off to service in Folksbridge, and left him to mope and fret over her absence. Within three months, in heedless, heartless triumph, she wrote that she was off with all her Wellfield friends, and was on the point of being married to a master-tradesman, who had just started a flourishing business in the great town.

Ph\u0153be had a vivid recollection of the blasting of the poor old mother's hopes, and the partial downfall of a whole family.

Ph\u0153be was persuaded that she did not love Barty one bit as girls love, \u2014 that she was more or less offended with him, and ag grieved at him, though he was now doing what he could to make up to her for his folly and rashness. Still he troubled her. She had a very distinct perception that, in spite of all his failures, there was still in him the making of a man ; and that it was very likely she would never see his like again.

Barty Wooler was going his own way, getting over his short furlough of the race week, chewing the bitter cud of his reflec tions and imaginations, totally unconscious ofthe degree in which he was troubling Ph\u0153be, and the burden of care he was cast ing upon her. Knowing little of the true quality, save from the old pages of George Selwyn and Horace Walpole (which, more than Burke or Debret, should be the Englishman's text-book), Barty supposed the race had neither improved nor degenerated since then, but had only accommodated itself to the march of time and the progress of the world."], [74, "64 Noblesse Oblige.

He had no doubt that Lord Wriothes ley was of such a set, white-washed and vir tuous, as became a Latimer, but man enough to have his individual tastes, although peer enough to hanker after forbidden fruit. Lord Wriothesley could not have Ph\u0153be Paston any more than the Prince of Wales could have had her ; but he could admire her, court her, and dangle after her in a dilettante, virtuous Latimer fashion, only robbing her of her virgin fancy, her maiden meditations, the first bloom of her heart.

Such was the way of the world. Paston could not foresee the harm, nor hinder it. The girl's mother was a fool ; and such an affair, even though it closely affected her dear Wellfield god-daughter and friend, was very far below a Lady Dorothea's notice. Barty himself, instead of arresting it, as he would have gone through fire and water to do, had accelerated it and brought it to a climax. Lastly, he was assured, that if he told any man or woman, even his old mother, of his agonies of mortification, suspicion, and jealousy, he would very soon come to be re garded as stark, staring mad.

Lady Louisa is to sing : besides, it would be too heavy a tax on people's ima gination to impose her also on them as a beauty without any particular ancestress to carry off the liberty. Chetwynd Dugdale is a beauty, therefore it is a necessity she should both sing and act. We omitted Mary Queen of Scots for Chetwynd, as the perso nation is hackneyed and stagey, in addition to being in the same generation as Lady Rich. We must vary our epochs, for in such an affair if we have not variety we have no thing. We passed over Sarah of Marlbor ough, because this would have been outra geously a dove personating a hawk. We pitched upon Venetia Lady Digby, to an un known Sir Kenelm.

Mr. Hall won't be so very much out of character, Lady Dorothea, for I always tell him that, like the rest of his class, he is already mentally stuffed out.\" Both girls laughed, and Lady Dorothea resumed \u2014 \" But, Ph\u0153be, Mr. Hall shows courage in this adventure. Every one else minds such a thing, and Wriothesley would expire of the weight of the stuffing which he would have to stand.

Indeed, Wrio thesley sees a likeness between you and Har ding's picture of Molly Lepel.

Your cousin, Mr. Hall, is there, and I expect will form one of the company. Surely, with me and Wriothesley you are not a stranger, either.

You would only have to come up this evening and help us to ar range matters ; and when you are there, you had better stay, for we women are going to beg off from the races to-morrow as much as possible, to study the groups and the general plan. We shall have a cabinet luncheon and a dressing-gown tea, and that part of the play will be quite easy.

But there is not a moment to be lost, my dear child ; and if you don't mind, I should much prefer you to anyone else, when it is for the credit of the race-week at Wellfield \u2014 perhaps the last race- week I shall cater for.\" It was clear that Lady Dorothea had set"], [89, "Not to be Beaten. 79 het heart on tableaux, and if tableaux, why, of course, the best of the kind, so far as she could make them. Hence her anxiety to find it perfectly practicable that pretty, clever Ph\u0153be Paston should be one of the per formers. Ph\u0153be hated to disappoint Lady Doro thea, just because Lady Dorothea bore dis appointment so admirably, never uttering a word of vexation, or, indeed, saying another word on the subject. Again, it must be confessed, Ph\u0153be secretly hankered after the fine doings and the fine people. She longed to be just for once in the centre of Lady Dorothea's circle, to try the effect of the high rarefied atmosphere. She thought that, after all, she could undertake what was required of her, if it were only to do as the others did \u2014 stand up with Lord Wriothesley and make a picture for a few minutes. She did not allow herself to encourage any con-"], [90, "Noblesse Oblige. 80 siderations which could render it a difficulty, when Lady Dorothea ignored such scruples. She did not think that her father would ob ject to her going up to Brockcotes, when he and Frank Hall were with her. There was nothing conspicuous in that, and the Countess had consented to it. If her own mother objected, Ph\u0153be knew very well the objection would not hold for a day. She could easily reconcile her mother to the step. Besides, she had as much vanity as to like to think of appearing as one of the Brockcotes company before all the assembled world of Wellfield \u2014 the Medlars, the Staceys, Miss Rowe, and even Miss Adelaide Coke, who did not think Ph\u0153be of rank sufficient to visit at the White House. This, Ph\u0153be felt, would be a triumphant proof of the es teem of the Exmoor family towards her father. And she would show her independ ence of Barty Wooler \u2014 the man towards"], [91, "Not to be Beaten. 81 whom she bore a grudge, because he had compelled her to do him a wrong. Ph\u0153be said yes, conditionally on receiving her father's consent, and sent Lady Dorothea away to walk over the course, not only in good heart (since she never lost heart), but in high spirits, and confident assurance of attaining a great success. Mr. Paston did not say no to the proposal. He had grown to have great faith in the dis cretion which characterised all the Brockcotes arrangements for Ph\u0153be, the force of Barty Wooler's protests against them having faded away with his right to make such protests. Mr. Paston, during all his artist life, had been in the habit of treating invitations to Brockcotes like royal mandates, a result arising as much from the formality as from the grateful loyalty of the man. Mrs. Paston the one moment asserted that Ph\u0153be ought to go, and the next that she VOL. II. G"], [92, "Noblesse Oblige. 82 ought not. At the last she agreed to Ph\u0153be's going, reserving to herself the right of com plaining, in boastful lowness of spirits, to every ready ear which she could secure for a day or two, of the expense, the exposure, and the risk inseparable from the boldness and the eccentricity of her husband and daughter. Ph\u0153be's promotion had one disadvantage. She was so full of the performance to which she was invited at Brockcotes, that on the second day she lost her appreciation of the races, and attended them as a matter of course, and a little as a task. She was full of impatience to have done with them, to get up to Brockcotes, and pass the rubicon by making her appearance among the play ers in the tableaux."], [93, "Ph\u0153be makes her Debut. 83 CHAPTER VI. Ph\u0153be makes her Debut. IHE introductory passages were settled for Ph\u0153be, and were accomplished easily. She was not allowed to walk, but was carried rapidly in one of the return carriages to Brockcotes, where she waited in Lady Dorothea's familiar room while the company were at dinner. In order to keep her in countenance at tea, Miss Thorpe left her place of honour at the first hall table (where she was sitting in state after dinner, trying, with Mrs. Bald's help, to freeze Miss Dugdale's maid and Thorpie into becoming G 2"], [94, "Noblesse Oblige. 84 propriety), and repaired to Lady Dorothea's room. Ph\u0153be had time to feel daunted and de pressed by the solemn mystery in which Miss Thorpe thought it her duty to veil the most trivial affairs of the family, and by the overpowering dignity and decorum of the lady who, in her evening silk and yellow lace, was more grandly dressed than the Countess ever was, save when she wore the Brockcotes necklace. So much was this the case, that a terror and shyness, such as she never felt in this room before, came over her, culminating in a lively wish to be at home again, and, at the same time, admit ting a rush back of Barty Wooler's most vehement remonstrances and warnings. But it would be out of the question for her to think of running away now. Nay, more, it would be selfish, when the temporary as sociation was for a purpose, and when Lady"], [95, "Ph\u0153be makes her Debut. 85 Dorothea had put it as U Ph\u0153be's acquies cence was an act of grace. All these uncomfortable feelings vanished when Lady Dorothea appeared. Her lady ship expressed her astonishment at finding Thorpe sitting up there like a crow in the mist, and caused the crow to rear her skinny neck and caw in indignant defence of her conduct. Lady Dorothea came to herself immediately, and was grave and humble in extenuation of her hasty inference, thus de claring her satisfaction with Thorpe for her attentions to Miss Paston. \" Thorpe is so easily affronted, except with mamma,\" her ladyship went on to ex plain, the moment the girls were left to themselves. \"And do you know that is a weakness of valuable servants ? Mrs. Bald shares it, but I think the men are more reasonable. We owe the women every con sideration, however; and I am sure the"], [96, "86 Noblesse Oblige.

The fact is, I kept looking at mamma, who was fixed by her trumpet to old Mr. Hammond, and could not move from her own table. However, we have made the great adjournment at last, and the hanging-committee of the women are already in the gallery, where, if you will come with me, I shall settle you comfortably before the men come in, and then none of them need be named to you, except those you like, and Wriothesley and I like. Lord Fairchester, of course, and a picked man or two, you must speak to ; but you will not be troubled"], [97, "Ph\u0153be makes her Debut. 87 with noticing the rest. Now, will that do, Ph\u0153be ? \" Ph\u0153be thought it would do excellently, and was almost recompensed for her regrets by seeing how balsam-bright Lady Dorothea looked in her light evening-dress, with clus ters of autumn berries in her loosened hair, and her opal and diamond clasps, half hidden in the unobtrusive details of her dress, flash ing finely when one's eye hit on them. But for these clasps Ph\u0153be's Indian muslin might match with her ladyship's dress. The women in the Beauty corner of the gal lery faithfully followed Lady Dorothea's cue. They received Ph\u0153be each more graciously than the other, \u2014 Miss Dugdale, who was in satin and pearls, as if she were representing a bride, most graciously of all. To such an extent indeed did her graciousness go, that it became ungracious in commiserating Ph\u0153be for having had to come all the way"], [98, "88 Noblesse Oblige. from Wellfield by herself. But Lady Dorothea put that down with quick em phasis. \" Of course, Chetwynd, my friend Miss Paston did not walk here, and the drive really does not call for condolence.\" Miss Dugdale gave her snowy shoulders the least little jerk, and then did something like looking Ph\u0153be over with one glance of her slate-coloured eyes, before falling asleep over the contemplation of her bouquet, as Lord Dacre had set her the example of doing over his claret in the dining-room. Ph\u0153be on her side remarked that Miss Dug dale's speech, carefully and artificially mask ed and minced as it was, afforded an indica tion of the sluggish thickness which clung to the tongues of the Dugdales ; and that dur ing the shortest conversation Miss Dugdale had to turn and bend down her head in or der to catch the words."], [99, "Ph\u0153be makes her Debut. 89 The two Miss Hammonds were not resi dent at Brockcotes, but came from the next country-house. They were highly respecta ble versions of their solid, gruff father. The Wellfield public was accustomed to look at them as they bowled along in the paternal carriage year after year. Ph\u0153be had no thing to expect from them but blunt gra ciousness. They would no more have been guilty of patronising her than of insulting her. Lady Penelope and Lady Louisa would have taken Ph\u0153be in their arms, and sworn an eternal friendship to her on the spot, al though they might cut her dead to-morrow. But Ph\u0153be would not be taken into anybody's arms without her own consent, \u2014 a peculiar ity which made the Ladies Blount look at her, and remember her a little longer than they might otherwise have done. Yet it was hard work to keep off Lady Louisa, who"], [100, "90 Noblesse Oblige. was as impervious to repulses as the most pushing member of a mob. The ladies were engaged in criticising the chosen pictures. The Rose of Raby had been found to have one eye lower in the cheek than the other. Lady Rich wore watchet blue, a shade of colour which could not now be had for love or money ; and Venetia Lady Digby had an ivory rose miniature on her breast, doubtless one of the Oliver miniatures, but there was not one like it to be found at Brockcotes. Lady Dorothea had ordered chests to be carried in from the wardrobe room ; and faded falling-to-pieces tunics, wimples, sur coats, and saques littered the floor. Miss Dugdale suggested softly that old clothes smelt mustily, and elevated the sharp tip of her nose as she spoke. Lady Penelope and her sister tripped here and there among the heap with disparaging rapidity. Lady Doro-"], [101, "Ph\u0153be makes her Debut. 91 thea was disposed to dwell fondly on every article, and record the history of its probable owner. As for Ph\u0153be Paston, she wished the accumulation out of sight. She thought the ancient dresses, with their shadowy seri ious memories, put the idle play to shame. It was still more so with the pieces of ar mour which had been lugged from the ar moury, bearing dints on the cuirasses and the steel helmets, and splashes of rust on the arm and thigh pieces. Ph\u0153be would ra ther have made up dresses and Don Quixote armour than mock the old relics of human work and suffering by using them in a traves ty of her father's trade. No business was done till the gentlemen came. Lord Wriothesley greeted Ph\u0153be with the empressement of a man who has secured a desirable partner, and with the consideration due to a woman who had put herself out of her way to oblige him and his"], [102, "92 Noblesse Oblige. party. Mr. Paston (who had dined at Brock cotes) and Frank Hall followed, supporting Ph\u0153be, so that she could now summon courage to inspect the rest of the men. Lord Fairchester, who was to be presented to her forthwith, and do his best to recom mend himself to his future wife's dear friend, certainly looked quite above caring whether she were of high or low degree. Mr. Ed mund Blount, though he was of set purpose not named to her, spoke to her before the evening was over, and called her \" a deuced proud little thing \" ere the tableaux were brought to an end. He had no part in the representations, and could hardly have had a part, unless he had gone in for a hulking black sheep of high rank. He was there with the futile intention of being kept from getting into mischief.

It might be true that undreamt of reserves of wisdom and accomplishments lay in this large-limbed, light-haired, light-eyed man of thirty, whose chin was constantly sunk in his white choker ; but he never showed it, except, as Ph\u0153be learnt long afterwards, when Aunt Sally happened to be resuscitated in the course of conversation. Lord Dacre had been one of the gentlemen who had in troduced Aunt Sally to fresh fields and aris tocratic pastures, stood sponsor for her, and backed her to any amount. Smouldering flames of resentment still woke up in him when the expulsion of the jaunty old woman and the substitution of her commonplace rival, croquet, were spoken of. Once, during the exigencies of the tableaux, Ph\u0153be and Lord Dacre were mentioned to each other,"], [104, "Noblesse Oblige. 94 but she was persuaded that he was half asleep at the time, and that his bow was as much a nod in honour of Somnus as of her. She was therefore amazed to have him bow to her the next time she met him galloping up Wellfield High Street, with no one to remind him of their introduction, unless his groom received intimation of his master's acquaintances, and put him through his paces in them as in horsemanship. After lengthened meditation on the subject, Ph\u0153be came to the conclusion that Lord Dacre was a gentleman, whether asleep or awake. Mr. Bertie was introduced to her, and Mr. Vernon was not. But Ph\u0153be was certain that this was accidental, for she could not then, or at any future time, discover a pin's point of difference between the two, beyond what belonged strictly to the outward man. They were both about the age of Lord"], [105, "Ph\u0153be makes her Debut. 95 Wriothesley, both in the army, both had yachts and hunters, to which they alluded frequently, and both belonged to the Carl ton. They had each gone through all of Europe that was worth seeing, and it struck Ph\u0153be that their tours were precisely mas culine editions of those of Lady Dorothea, Ladies Penelope and Louisa, and Miss Dug dale. Ph\u0153be was led to understand that both men were eligible, in being eldest sons of men of property. The two were also alike in haunting Miss Dugdale, in fetching and carrying for her, and in fighting a hard battle to avoid Lady Penelope and Lady Louisa, to either of whom Lord Dacre fell an easy victim. It was a point of some im portance, as respects the personal identity of the two men, that Mr. Bertie made faces. With regard to this practice, Ph\u0153be caught an incautious whisper of Lady Louisa's, that Bob Bertie was still unable to resist mowing, A"], [106, "96 Noblesse Oblige. and that they had better look out for his falling down among them in one of his epileptic attacks. Ph\u0153be had no doubt that both of the young men were mirrors of that fashion which is so high that it does not look fashion at all, but merely \"the thing\" on this and on every other occasion. But, after all, she suspected she would soon have tired of these perfectly cut heads of hair, of the morning's delicate grey and picturesque brown, or the evening's quiet elegance of black and white, with a single scarlet cam ellia in the button-hole, and exquisite gro tesque vagaries in gold and mosaic by way of studs, and would have been tempted to prefer rough and racy Mr. and Mrs. Edge cumbe as lodgers in Wooers' Alley.

Lady Dorothea had said no time was to be lost, and Mr. Paston was ready to bestow on the players a little of his hard-earned leisure and valuable advice. The pictures were here patiently waiting. The old dresses were at hand for models of costume. Thorpe stood saturnine, snuffiug the air in her silk and lace. Thorpie was officious and saucy, to the despair of her worthy relative.

Lady Louisa was insisting on practising Gr etch en's wayward heart-broken snatch of \"There was a King in Thule,\" to the accompaniment of a cracked old spinnet, contemporary with the late Beauties, and deposited as a fitting adjunct in that corner of the gallery. Lady Penelope was squabbling with Mr. Edmund. Even Lord Exmoor was showing Mr. Paston over the pictures which the painter had seen hundreds of times before, and Lord Wrio thesley and Frank Hall had drawn aside to discuss a paper on logarithms which had been communicated to the Royal Society, and the substance of which had been propounded by the last six senior wranglers.

She resorted to a coup d'etat, and recalled some of her troop by dismissing Mr. Paston, or rather by accepting his pre sumed resignation of office. \" I shall not keep you longer, sir, a wit ness to our trifling with our duties.

By the aid of specimens of medi\u00e6val costumes, she had managed to get constructed an in dividual example ; and she did not stick even at the horned head-dress of which she had spoken to Ph\u0153be.

This was a good beginning. But when Lady Dorothea stood up, in perfect gravity, her low little head surmounted by the gro tesque triple horns, like the horns in a vision of ancient prophecy, adding at least three feet to her stature, but taking away every tittle of its grave propriety, the effect was so irresistibly ludicrous, that even Lord Fair chester and Ph\u0153be joined in the laughter which greeted the extraordinary spectacle. - Lady Dorothea was neither angry nor abashed, but simply annoyed. \" What do you mean, good people ?

Of course I shall wear it, and become it, too, I hope. It is not the cap which makes the woman, but the wo man who makes the cap.\" Here Lady Dorothea composedly resumed the nodding horns, but only to call forth fresh bursts of laughter, at which she at last looked round, disturbed and reproachful, the rather that she found the most ringing"], [115, "The Tableaux Vivants. 105 peals came from Ph\u0153be and Lord Fair chester. \" I tell you, Dolly,\" declared Lord Wrio thesley, recovering his breath and wiping his eyes, \" that we shall die of these horns, if you wag them at us in that way. What is worse, Wellfield will be unable, if it is human, to keep from following our ex ample.\" With some difficulty, Lady Dorothea was persuaded to resign the horns for a hood of the fourteenth century. Like all really high-bred natures, she was sweet-tempered ; but she continued to regret, privately, the substitution of the vague hood for the horn ed head-dress, and of paste-board imitation for the true armour, as being subversive of what she was pleased to consider the in structive authenticity of the spectacle. \" Did you ever notice this defect in Lady Dorothea's composition, that the sense of"], [116, "106 Noblesse Oblige. humour is absent ? Now, don't feel affronted, and flash up at this ; for so it is, and you know it is my own sister I am speaking of,\" observed Lord Wriothesley, sotto voce, to Ph\u0153be, who could not resent the criticism, simply because it was his own sister he was speaking of. Moreover, it was \" a true truth\" which he was subtly presenting, though the subject of it was \" good, and wise, and fair.\" The original armour could not have been worn for half-an-hour by the players, so much had men and times altered. Yet when Lord Wriothesley took up a casque and tried it on, Ph\u0153be was struck by the knight ly character of the studious, speculative face, and could not but think of the amount of noble manhood which must lurk in the delicate stripling's features, to be thus brought out by the iron shell and its hard frame."], [117, "The Tableaux Vivants. 107 No hitch occurred in any of the other tableaux that were passed in review that evening.

In the entire absence of her natural prey, Miss Dugdale's conduct gave signs that if she had lived in a happy Rasselasian valley she might have taken to her own sex, in stead of largely overlooking them. She would have quickly discovered satellites and slaves, masters, and tyrants, among them also, and have proceeded to woo them as assiduously as she wooed their brethren.

On this dull women's day at Brockcotes, Miss Dugdale showed her objection to Ph\u0153be by an en grossing consideration of billiards and operas. All the other women knew billiards as a necessary part of education, and could play more or less well on their own account ; or, at the lowest, in fits of humility and use fulness they could mark for the men, and incite the most skilled players to perform their finest feats. Miss Dugdale, in her slow, low way \u2014 all the more impressive that it was slow and low \u2014 sung the praises of billiards, rung the changes on billiards, and exalted the importance of billiards, until the game stood even higher than the meet and the hunting field as the shibboleth of a class, with whom not to know billiards wras to be one's self un-"], [128, "Noblesse Oblige. 118 known.

Lady Penelope wrote letters to several friends whom her brother Fairchester did not approve of her associating with, and to other friends who had been inclined to cut the whole Blount family for being on terms with Mr. Edmund. She took care ostenta tiously to proclaim the names of her corres pondents in both cases. Lady Louisa persecuted Ph\u0153be with con fidences, and declined to be silenced.

Fairchester does not care for for bidden fruit, or for wild oats, or anything of the sort. He is such a very exemplary young fellow of a peer.

Even Lord Dacre was wide awake now. Standing on steps with his hands above his head, he nailed together the improvised frames. If Lady Dorothea was the leader of the company, Lord Wriothes ley was their ubiquitous servant ; and he was particularly helpful to Ph\u0153be, in her outly ing strangeness.

But her children caught at her words as pearls and diamonds of en couragement and counsel, and eagerly adopt ed her faintest hint. Lord Wriothesley put his hand on his mother's shoulder enthu siastically. \" Mamakin,\" he declared, \" what would we do without you?

Lord Dacre was seized with irresistible fits of the gapes, as like as not to attack him at any moment of the tableau, and shifted from one foot to the other, not merely in an unpictorial, but in a forlorn, unsoldierly, un- Mountjoy fashion, because he was not at liberty to drop down on the instant, and rest himself. But he made up for these symptoms of weakness by the size of his trunk-hose and the puffs of his sleeves, and by his being a real live baron. To crown all, he wore for a collar the actual, match less Brockcotes necklace, more renowned in Wellfield and the county than that other necklace which cost poor Marie Antoinette so dear. In the eyes of some of the rever ent gazers it was a reckless profanation to"], [147, "A Drawback. 137 have the Brockcotes necklace out of the charter-room and the fire-proof safe with the Chubb lock. But, on the other hand, an opportunity was afforded to many people of feasting their eyes on its lustre and water, and exercising their minds in calculating its value \u2014 people who were not on intimate terms with Mr. Clarges, the butler, and who at the same time were out of the count as regards drawing-rooms and coronations. The two next were bumper couples, who looked their parts, and were sure to draw down rounds of the vociferous applause which is so dear to the stagey heart of man and woman. Miss Dugdale was so beautiful in her falling collar and falling sleeves, with a red rose in her taper, unadorned hand, that she dragged through with her in her triumph Frank Hall's too accurate represen tation of the foolish, fat knight in Spanish mantle and Vandyke cuffs, who stood in the"], [148, "Noblesse Oblige. 138 centre of all the agate cups, bronzes, ivories, and miniature pictures which could be crowded within the compass of the frame, to indicate Sir Kenelm's mania. One could excuse the tradition of \" the strange medica ments \" with which he tried to preserve the beauty of the lady by his side, and the fact of his being deaf to the brazen tongues that clacked of that beauty as a whited sepulchre over dead men's bones. At last came Ph\u0153be Paston, who, though she might be exalted among the Brockcotes company, would appease her jealous town's people by maintaining their credit. She was the daintiest chit of a maid of honour, arrayed in peach, primrose, and cherry-red, with a rippling curl on her crown, and de mure mittens on her crossed arms.

He was a fine young fellow, although he might have had more flesh and colour without any loss of gentility. He was too slim for an English beef-eater, such as even a well-endowed earl who had been accumulating lands and hon ours all these centuries, ought to' be ; but Mr. Clarges vouched for his being a perfect gentleman of the right stock.

These old bodies, while they pro tested it did their hearts good to see the stately quality costume again, would be able to say how true to the life it was. There was not one of the great people to-night but clapped hands and cried \" Bravo !\" at this tableau. Venetia Miss Dugdale refrained from reminding Ph\u0153be of her ignorance of billiards, and contented herself with pointing out that the little em broidered heirloom mittens were a shade too small for her. A stitch had started in one of them, which Venetia would be en chanted to \" take up.\" These old embroi dery stitches were peculiar, said Miss Dug dale, almost hereditary, like those in her cousin Lady Exmoor's hangings, and were the next thing to unattainable by a novice,"], [151, "A Drawback. 141 while they were perfectly simple to the ini tiated \u2014 the one stitch being the key to the other.

This was the Dugdale-Latimer stitch. Ph\u0153be could afford to smile at this array of stitches. She was of the same opinion still. She felt she could work the most difficult one, even in the Countess's hangings, better than Miss Dugdale, and long before that young lady could gird herself up to anything requiring so much application and industry. The real drawbacks to Ph\u0153be's pleasant excitement and lively admiration of herself and her neighbours came from others than Miss Dugdale.

Mr. Edmund anew brought home to her, with a sharp quivering pang, that she was out of her element at Brockcotes. But Lord Wriothesley answered both Mr. Edmund and the ballad-maker : \"Who would not go to the bad, eh? What a miserable turn of a sentence ! What a base description !

I won't have it my Caprera. No ; it is not the wines, though the white port is pretty fair. I drink better at the Garrick.\" \" Granted, Frank ; but the wines are not everything,\" suggested Ph\u0153be. \" You must have enjoyed the shooting.\" \" Oh, as for the shooting, I'll never make a dead shot.

With regard to the last, one gets used to it soon enough, and finds its members, after, dolls of men and dolls of women.

Of course, I accept the real Jezebels and Lady Macbeths ; I allow they have a footing both in nature and art.\" \" I never expected you to speak with so much enthusiasm on such a point,\" alleged Ph\u0153be. \" Well, perhaps I may be excused, Ph\u0153be; it's a woman who has done for me.

I could close my eyes at the present moment, and see a pale, bright-eyed woman, simple in her dress and inexpensive in her habits, flitting about my writing-table, keeping guard at my elbow, never weary of reading notes, looking over ' copy,' correcting proofs, learning shorthand to report in her turn, and never flagging in her interest and zeal. I open my eyes, and am tempted to curse poor innocent Lord Fairchester, plain and heavy and sensible \u2014 holding thousands of acres, booked for the blue riband, possibly for the strawberry leaves. I don't envy the man his other goods, particularly since he seeks to do the best he can with the burden which weighs upon him and renders him as silent as Dutch William.\" \" You strike me as being rather fanciful to be in earnest, Frank.\""], [159, "Frank Halls Retreat. 149 \" Excuse me, Ph\u0153be, if I say you are wrong there. I don't deny that Fairchester is a fair match for her ; only I won't play (since playing is the order of the day) the bachelor Sir Christopher Hatton to my Queen Elizabeth ; so I'm off with the train to-morrow. What are your commands, Ph\u0153be, should I take Folksbridge on my way to town, or should I find anything to do in town beyond secretly writing for your dear, little, hearty, bumptious benefit in The Bat?\" Ph\u0153be could not tell whether there was or was not the slightest foundation of fact in Frank Hall's rhapsody. He had got into the habit of general mystification, till it was hard for any simple man or woman to follow him in his flights, and tell whether he was making a saucy pretence, in order to turn round and deny it absolutely, and thus cover the credulous listener with ridicule,"], [160, "Noblesse Oblige. 150 or whether he was, after all, speaking in genuine earnest. Ph\u0153be thought that sim plicity of tongue had its revenge. Frank Hall had gone so far in clever affectation, that now he was on the point of bewilder ing himself, and was so unfortunate as not quite to know his own mind, and what he would be at, in more instances than one. Certainly Ph\u0153be had remarked that Frank Hall and Lady Dorothea had taken latterly to noticing each other, and spar ring with each other, very considerably. If there was a shade of suspicion on Frank Hall's side that he was gradually more and more venturing his all in the light drawing-room strife, he was a wise man to draw off his forces, and retreat with flying colours, while it was still in his power. He might carry with him the bitter sweetness of the conviction that Lady Dorothea's lightest hair was unsinged by his closest fire, and"], [161, "Frank Hall's Retreat. 151 that even though it had been otherwise, there would have been nothing on earth for him to hope from such a woman so circum stanced. Frank Hall's susceptibility was an un counted-on triumph to Lady Dorothea. On the other hand, his hurt, however slight, was a wound from the great upper-class to the literary and artistic ranks, to which they extend a dubious right hand of fellowship. In her uncertainty, Ph\u0153be could not re gret Frank Hall's departure, as Lady Doro thea did, in perfect unconsciousness. \" I am so sorry that the autocratical, con ceited cousin of the press is called away, Ph\u0153be,\" her ladyship confessed; \"for, be tween you and me, he was teaching me a thing or two. Wriothesley calls his leaders incisive, luminous, epigrammatic, and says that that is what ' takes' in the present day ; but I am not sure whether his conversation,"], [162, "152 Noblesse Oblige. like Dr. Johnson's, is not better than his leaders.

IN former years the race-week as- sembly had been, to the ladies of Wellfield, the most momentous and accept able event of the year. But in this, Ph\u0153be's first grown-up year at Wellfield races, her imagination went far beyond balls. And she was farther tempted to forget the assem bly on the very morning of its occurrence. First, Mrs. Edgecumbe sent for her, that she might get the news, and cross-examine the girl on the arrangements at Brockcotes. When she had made her report, she was"], [164, "154 Noblesse Oblige. puzzled by the unusual reserve of the old lady, rather than troubled by her wonted freedom. \" You are to be my young lord's partner,\" Mrs. Edgecumbe said, with a meaning look. \" Well, well, times have changed ; and you are a good girl, Ph\u0153be Paston, and one of nature's gentlewomen ; Edgecumbe, whose immense penetration I can trust, acknow ledges it.

But for that matter, I think all young men are virtuous, now-a days, and I can't make out where the con tinual wickedness of the world can come from, unless from the women.

Even Mrs. Edgecumbe was silenced by this rebuke, and Ph\u0153be hung her head a little at the recollection of her own particu lar aversion to Miss Dugdale.

When Ph\u0153be began to dress, she entered into the spirit of the thing, and was careful about the fit of her gown, the size of her gloves, and the wreath of oak-leaves which Lady Dorothea had chosen for her to wear in her hair, like Norma, the British princess"], [167, "Inopportune. 157 and priestess.

Ph\u0153be had read them ; and, in opposition to her father's appreciation of Mr. Pope, simply detested them. After all, Ph\u0153be's anxious toilet was made greatly with the intent that not even Miss Dugdale should have cause to observe, with a mild shudder and a slight elevation of the straight line of her eyebrows, what a rustic dowdy, or obviously vulgar creature, Molly Lepel, was in modern clothes, and on the uneven floor of the Wellfield ball-room."], [168, "Noblesse Oblige. 158 Arrived at the ball, Ph\u0153be found that she was a person of consequence \u2014 to the Well field world, at least.

Had it not been for her, who would have answered the breathless questions as to all that had got abroad of the amateur con cert, and the spectacle which was to follow at Brockcotes ? Ph\u0153be had not counted on Barty Wooler being at the assembly ; although when she came to think of it, she remembered that everybody, young and old, who had no scruple of principle or purse, attended to see the race-company, and enjoy their own and their neighbours' fine clothes.

Having had her eyes open to the matter of-factness of Barty Wooler's presence, the next thing Ph\u0153be had not anticipated was the probability of his dancing, and dancing with her. It was not that he was too old to dance \u2014 Lord Exmoor had opened the balls up till this year, and even old Mr. Edgecumbe stood up on the floor sometimes when his gout allowed him, and when he was sufficiently stimulated, and could per suade the facile old wife, or very young daughter, of a tenant or tradesman to make the not very improving exhibition with him.

Barty Wooler early in the evening asked Ph\u0153be to dance with him, and she had no choice but to comply with his request, al though she would rather not have done it. The county people, after the example of the Exmoors, behaved very well at the race-balls, which were moves for popularity to begin with. They mixed freely with the town's people, and were apt to select them only too persistently for their partners and vis-a vis. But the town's people were not in the habit of taking the initiative.

Ph\u0153be could readily and speedily undeceive Lady Dorothea when her ladyship was at leisure, and Ph\u0153be did not profess to care what Lord Wriothesley thought, any more than what Miss Dugdale thought, on the matter.

But she did not know what it was to live (metaphorically) till Barty Wooler asked her, almost within hearing of the others, U it could be true that she was going to row in the same boat with the noble players. On being answered in the affirmative, Barty urgently and emphatically protested against it. \" I have a delicacy in mixing myself up in your father's relations with Brockcotes, and therefore I am remonstrating with you.

But as it happened, the great merging in to each other of the houses of Blount and Latimer was postponed. Lord Exmoor's gout transferred itself as pure rheumatism to Lady Exmoor, threatening to render ac tive movement impossible for the rest of her life. It did not seem so inappropriate or in tolerable a fate considering the habits of the Countess in relation to the world without. But Lady Exmoor's immediate circle rallied round the still, stiff-natured woman, threaten ing now to become stiff-jointed also.

Lady Dorothea's marriage, with its ceremonies and festivities, as coming in the way of Lady Ex moor's cure, was deferred indefinitely in spite of the Countess's remonstrances. Dr. Mit ford, who devoted his best skill and the most of his time to the Exmoor family, keeping an assistant for the rest of the world, and who, in spite of his most conscientious exertions, was said to be growing rapidly grey and nervous under the weight of his responsi bility, requested further professional advice, and despatched the whole family to town a month before Christmas \u2014 three whole months before Parliament should open. n2"], [190, "Noblesse Oblige. 180 Everybody the Exmoors knew were then at their own country places, or at Brighton, or abroad.

Casting objections to the winds, and spurning obstacles, if they might but spare the elasticity of an ankle or a thumb, her faithful people carried the Coun tess thither. The escort consisted of Lord Exmoor and Lady Dorothea, Mr. Richard son as factotum, Mr. Simmons, his lordship's man, Thorpe, her ladyship's woman, and Thorpie, Lady Dorothea's maid, with their satellites.

Ph\u0153be had always thought Wellfield more or less desolate when Brockcotes was given over to Mr. Clarges and Mrs. Bald. But she contemplated with edification the sacrifices the men of the family made for the Countess. It was not that she thought her father would not sacrifice even art itself to confer real benefit on her and her mother.

As the winter deepened, there was a gene ral impression in Wellfield that it must be lonely for Lord Wriothesley, living all by himself up at Brockcotes. He was mostly there, of course ; Swinely, and the other localities in which the name of Exmoor flourished as that of the ruling proprietor, having less call for the presence of a mem ber of the family. But if Lord Wriothesley must be lonely, most people, the men especially, said what an excellent opportun ity it was for his lordship acquiring those business habits which would be of immense importance both to him and his dependents afterwards. The old Latimers had set him a good example. They had been very much their own chamberlains and inspect-"], [195, "A Lull. 185 ors of works, and Lord Wriothesley seemed inclined to avail himself of the opportunity. He did not shut himself up with his books or his canvas and brushes, as had been fear ed. He was interested in more things than the meets of the hounds. He did not con tent himself with dilettante patronage of me chanics' institutions, parish clubs, and little essays at speechifying, which might be of use to him after he stepped into a borough. He really set himself to know his work, and do it much as Lady Dorothea would have done; only where his sister would have been largely practical, he theorised and generalised, and was full of schemes and visions. In the morning he was about in the gardens, the stables, the kennels ; after luncheon, he was abroad on his horse or in his drag, going far and near over the estate in all weathers. He looked into the boun daries, and investigated clauses in leases,"], [196, "186 Noblesse Oblige. and disputes founded on them ; he visited and ascertained for his own private satisfac tion the state of the line of railway in pro cess of being made, in which Lord Exmoor was the great shareholder ; he inspected personally the wood-mills, the tile-works, the new farm-buildings with which Lord Exmoor was then busy. He had been sworn in as a justice of the peace, and he now took his seat on the bench almost as regularly as his father had done. He sur prised the market-town of Nannton by ap pearing occasionally in the market, and gravely applying himself to prices, very much as if he meant business. Certainly no stout young farmer at the ordinary at Nannton, nor fervent young high-church curate within three parishes, rode or strode about in more unwavering pursuit of his calling than did Lord Wrio thesley. If he did not return home to"], [197, "A Lull. 187 write sermons or keep accounts, he audited the steward's papers, burrowed in the charter-chest, kept up with the literature \u2014 both classical and scientific \u2014 of the times, and dined out in the few neighbouring country-houses on a visiting level with Brockcotes. Lord Wriothesley's subjects were ready to smack their Ups approvingly on him as one of the right sort. They spoke of him as an active-minded and public-spirited young nobleman \u2014 neither a milksop, nor a wilding, nor a nincompoop. The country worthies were rather doubtful when his lordship's ta lents were spoken of, regarding these in the light of brittle, precarious ware ; but at least his lordship's talents did not interfere with his attention to business. They saw in him a solid yet sharp youngster, with a brain, a heart, and a conscience. When it was found that Lady Exmoor"], [198, "188 Noblesse Oblige. could not return till Easter, Lord Wriothes ley, with his father's approval, set on foot a new clearing of the more overgrown por tions of the Brockcotes woods, and took the first steps towards bringing in water at the family's expense to the town of Nannton, in the same manner as it had been brought in to Wellfield. These were the improvements which he had convinced himself were the most desirable in the meanwhile, and with which he would do well to commemorate his deputy-reign. To his other duties, and at the risk of being dubbed a busybody, he added an energetic individual superintend ence of the two works which he had in augurated.

Of course she would ap prove in a way of anything useful ; but were these quite small, commonplace endeavours any sign of the great enterprise with which Lord Wriothesley was to signalise his wear ing of the Earl's coronet, and still further ennoble Exmoor? Were they even indi cations of the legislative genius, the finan cial skill, which were one day to promote Wellfield 's young lord to be the head of Her Majesty's Cabinet, or the Chancellor of her Exchequer ?

Why should he not visit intimately in the house which, with its advantages and its patent defects, had taken his fancy ? Why should he not cultivate the friendship of the girl who was his sister's friend, and who had taken his fancy also ?

If we had not let Lord Wriothes ley come here of an evening, he would have worked himself into a fever. He could not go up to town, and get distraction at his club or the opera.

Lord Wriothesley was also different. He had not recovered the dispersion of a mirage of which he was the half- guilty creator. There was a sense of something on his mind, of a terribly serious fact which self-question ing had made vividly clear and undeniable.

No wonder Lord Wriothesley looked su premely serious, and solemnly in earnest, when he came through the still biting east wind of the spring, with his evening coat but toned across his chest, and his thin boots damp and soiled. What might in one light be regarded as a great misfortune, almost as great as any that could threaten Lord Fair chester, had so risen up and confronted Lord Wriothesley, that he could no longer refuse to realise it.

After the usual offers of executing commissions, and carrying messages to the family, and one or two more lingering, wist ful looks, Lord Wriothesley said that he would venture to intrude on Mr. Paston in order to take leave of him, and that he could find the way for himself. Ph\u0153be agreed with him, but Mrs. Paston would not suffer Lord Wriothesley to run the risk of losing himself in the limited labyrinth of the old rectory passages ; so he parted from Ph\u0153be with a simple \" We shall meet again soon, Miss Paston.\" Ph\u0153be was left alone.

He was Lady Dorothea's brother, and she was Lady Dorothea's friend, and her father and mother were more or less occupied. That was all. He had never paid her particular attention, or made court to her. She had never thought of such a thing. In their position it would not have been fit ting: it would neither have added to his self-respect nor to hers. Thinking of it now, the idea shamed her, as the first vague con ception of it had filled her with perturbation at the Wellfield gate.

It was so whenever she had work to do, though it were no more than trimming an apron for herself or a cap for her mother.

Once, indeed, he had driven home early from Cholmondley, and come in for a mo ment to tell them that he had hurried back on purpose to let her mother and her know that the Bishop was really to deliver an ad dress at Nannton the next day, and to ask them if they should like to hear it ; and to"], [245, "Mrs. Paston reviews the Situation. 235 inform her father that Sir William Chol mondley would be charmed to put at his disposal the new President's work in Lady Cholmondley's portrait.

His Lordship had only made one offering to the family in Wooers' Alley, and certainly it had been made to Ph\u0153be, and had pro mised such happiness that she had not stopped to think before accepting it.

Ph\u0153bewas one of those people in whom the love of dogs is like an additional faculty. The chief envy which little Lady Dorothea had excited in the child Ph\u0153be's breast had been with respect to the amount of her canine companionship. As an only child Ph\u0153be had had few pets. The possession of one, even at this late date, to trot at her heels, and sit at her foot, and creep into her lap when she was quiet, \u2014 beg behind her chair at meals, and sleep in the basket by her bed at night, was a far greater source of joy to her in her womanhood than ever a doll was to her in her babyhood. She doted on Bess, and in her infatuation maintained"], [247, "Mrs. Paston revieivs the Situation. 237 that it had special attractions. No. sleepy, fine-haired King Charles, or shadowy Italian grayhound, could compare with her little terrier, hardy, honest, wise, and gay. It came of his Grace of Northumberland's Prudhoe breed, with slightly curled, whitey yellow hair, sufficiently wiry to be crisp on the back, yet soft as silk on the forehead and breast ; and with those large, liquid, loving eyes, which are a good dog's main charm. Ph\u0153be's affection for her pet was no fine lady's pretence to please the noble donor, as some of the natives of Wellfield gratuitously supposed. It was the simple Gog-given love of animals, which existed in as great strength in her enemy, Mrs. Wooler, as it existed in her.

Her faded complexion was rosy again, and her blue eyes bright. She looked almost young, and foolishly pretty, as when Mr. Paston thought her prettiness and folly worth all the wis dom in the world. She poised herself on a corner of a chair, at the imminent risk of overbalancing herself, as she cried in shrill exultation \u2014 \"Ph\u0153be, have done with that sUly trifling with a brute beast, when you have so much more to think of.

From the top of every lane, at the rise of every market-road in the neighbour hood, she looked down upon another wide sweep of the noble privacy of the park, or a fresh prospect of the open country still within the vale of Brockcotes, all owned and legislated for by the Latimers, with the exception of a detached frag-"], [267, "To be or not to be. 257 ment or two, which looked to those who knew where to discover them, the merest intersected morsels. She had learnt that it was just possible that she, a middle-class girl, and a simple artist's daughter, might live to be the lady of the land \u2014 that great Countess of Exmoor, whose fiat sounded law, whose power and pleasure were some thing queenly to the women of Wellfield. No wonder that Ph\u0153be swerved from her self-control and composure at the bare idea. It was a very remote possibility, but such things had been. Judging from the tenacity and devotion to an object which belonged to Lord Wriothesley and his sister, he was likely enough to realise his desire. Ph\u0153be was too innocently proud and true hearted to dream of rebellion and disobedi ence, far less of intrigue and treachery, as the offering which Lord Wriothesley would lay at her feet. She keenly remembered VOL. II. s"], [268, "Noblesse Oblige. 258 now what she had heard Lord Wriothesley reply to Mr. Edmund Blount's insolent quo tation. If Lord Wriothesley was so infatuated as to love her, in place of a lady of high degree and an heiress, according to the old Exmoor forethought and self-dedication to the race, the great probability was that, in spite of the requirements of his house, he would disappoint everybody, and die a bachelor for Ph\u0153be's sake. That would be the catas trophe which would come, in this nineteenth century, of a young lord's passionately and romantically misplacing his affections. Or had Ph\u0153be's mother, seeing sooner than wiser people into the real attraction which drew Lord Wriothesley to Wooers' Alley, hit, as if by inspiration, on a great truth, when she suggested that this mar riage, so unequal, and so sure of opposition, was the deed or the prelude to the deed"], [269, "To be or not to be. 259 which Lord Wriothesley had been designed to achieve ? Was it necessary to his coming out from the noble mediocrity of the Ex moors (to achieve the renewal, if not to perpetuate the very existence of the race), that he should by a decisive step break down the generations of barriers between the Lati mers and the robust, striving middle-classes, before he could do anything which should vindicate his own and the Exmoors' claim to be great thinkers or originators in any department ? Ph\u0153be, though she was a spoilt, and at times a silly young girl, was far from being incapable of the strivings of a noble woman liness and a worthy ambition. She felt with a thrill of eager aspiration that she could, by God's help, become a noble help meet even for such as Lord Wriothesley. She was conscious that she could rise to his duties and cares, could comprehend them, s2"], [270, "260 Noblesse Oblige. instigate and support him in their full dis charge, though the effort and the burden to such as her might still be heavy. Regarding the promotion in this light, as well as in the lower light of the world, Ph\u0153be asked herself why she should not wait and look forward to it ? It might come within her reach. Lord Exmoor, in the hopelessness of any change in his son's sentiments, might be brought to consent to Lord Wriothesley's marriage with her. Lord Exmoor must die (yet Ph\u0153be -wished earnestly that the good, fidgety Earl might see a ripe old age). Lord Wriothesley and Ph\u0153be could wait \u2014 wait without doubting, during half a Ufetime. When she thus be came a great lady, she would not dishonour the station and the name. There were not many women, perhaps, who would consent to such a probation. When she thought of it, her rounded young face grew keen with"], [271, "To be or not to be. 261 a delusive far-sightedness, a blinded eager ness, which brought out wonderfully her resemblance to her father when he was a young man, and Barty Wooler's friend. Had Barty Wooler seen Ph\u0153be now, he would have been startled by the likeness. But Ph\u0153be was persuaded at last, by her own instincts and her own reason, that her imagination was not a delusion. If she were mistaken, she would cry mercy on her sense of shame, and rise up so bravely, that she would only be the stronger once she had detected and trampled out the weak ness, as other women had found power to do in similar circumstances. But while she had the maidenly discretion to tell herself this, she did not believe in any delusion. On the contrary, she had a deep conviction of the great choice which might be hers. It was present with her as she walked along Wellfield streets, or in the lanes and mea-"], [272, "Noblesse Oblige. 262 dows about the town. She voluntarily ex iled herself at this time from the miles on miles of chase in its glory of green ; from the breaks of flowering thorns and crab trees within the bounds of the park ; from the shrubberies in their season of lilac, guelder-rose, and laburnum, melodious with piping thrush and chattering finch ; from the gardens in their splendour of tulips and hyacinths ; and from all the old delights of May at Brockcotes. In her exile she held up her head with a strangely mingled sense of honour and humility, and scarcely felt the ground she trod on. Two obstacles, besides the fundamental objection of birth, proceeded from two very different persons and sets of influences, affecting Ph\u0153be within two strictly separate circles. The centre of these were Lady Dorothea and Barty Wooler. How could Ph\u0153be be the means of griev-"], [273, "To be or not to be. 263 ing her friend, outraging Lady Dorothea's sense of what was right, and bitterly disap pointing her in the brother on whom she set such store ? She felt it would be hard to do this, even if Lady Dorothea had not had trials of her own to contend with at this time. But then it was not her doing ; it was not even altogether in her power to prevent it. Lord Wriothesley would not be easily answered and set at naught by her, any more than he would be guided and controlled by the traditions of race, the exigencies of position, or the force of old use and wont and parental will. Lady Do rothea would immediately and unhesitating ly expect Ph\u0153be and Lord Wriothesley to sacrifice themselves for the good of the Lati mers and of mankind (their retainers), as she would have sacrificed herself, \u2014 as in deed she had done, schooling and disciplin ing herself to accept the arrangement which"], [274, "264 Noblesse Oblige. gave her to Lord Fairchester. Ph\u0153be was aware that Lady Dorothea pushed her creed unconsciously to the extent of claiming that every person and every thing should yield to the interests of society, as represented by the Exmoors, and judging that service, if done to them, was its own reward. Not withstanding this, she could not call Lady Dorothea selfish, when she was the chief and the most sorely- worked of the servants. But Ph\u0153be knew also that Lady Doro thea, like the rest of the world, would often be doomed to find her expectations fail. None were more alive to this than herself, or better armed for failure and the adop tion of new resources, though the family tenacity would render the yielding up of her plans for her brother a painful experi ence. When all was said, Ph\u0153be could not save her friend from the experience. And dearly as she loved Lady Dorothea, much"], [275, "To be or not to be. 265 as she would suffer for her friend, it was genuine friendship which existed between them. She was not false to herself in it, and so could not be false to Lady Dorothea to the extent of desiring that, at all hazards, and in the face of all losses, she should spare Lady Dorothea the experience which might be best for her. If only Lady Dorothea would not mistake her motives. She did not mean to say that they were untinged by worldliness, that there was no under-valuing of her own cir cumstances and over-valuing of those of others in her mind. To her, too, though they came less in the way of natural ambition, the satin hangings of the Countess's rooms and the gold toilette-plate were attractions. She would like to dispense the Brockcotes hos pitalities and charities, to take the lead on the grand-stand and at the county-ball, to have carriages and horses, troops of servants"], [276, "266 Noblesse Oblige. and suites of rooms. She would prize the treasures of art and literature, the Queen's drawing-room, the choice set in the season, and the opportunity of foreign travel. With a girl's restlessness and ardour, she counted all these gains ; but if Lady Dorothea would credit it, she did not think of them first and most. She might gaze around her with pride and delight in the boudoir which Lady Dorothea had spoken of approvingly for her own portion, but certainly she would hardly feel at home there for many a day. The great gardens would be something of an op pression to her after her own pocket-hand kerchief beds and old court and orchard at Wooers' Alley. Instead of being monarch of all she surveyed on the Brockcotes ter- races and in the Brockcotes greenhouses, she would no longer be able to peg down a carnation or tie up a phlox, far less call a heath or an orchid her own, because of the"], [277, "To be or not to be. 267 tyranny and the caprices of ever so many lofty, learned gardeners. Still, she was not without the germs of wise moderation and simplicity. It was not for diamonds and satins solely or principally that she would seek an entrance among the upper ten thou sand. If Lad}' Dorothea would but see that she could not have been Lady Dorothea's gossip and companion all these years without appre hending, from her very example, that there was something far nobler than personal en joyment, or even personal improvement, in the true possession and enjoyment of great rank and riches. She trusted much to Lady Dorothea's own nobility to recognise this higher sense in her. At the same time Lady Dorothea had strong prejudices, and among the strongest was the appropriation to her own class of the noblesse oblige, which is wide as the gifts of humanity."], [278, "268 Noblesse Oblige. It was not easy to see what Barty Wooler could have to do with Ph\u0153be's situation, so far as the Exmoor family were concerned. He had prophesied correctly when he had denounced in his brusque philippic the inex pediency of her intimacy with the family, and particularly of her being coupled with Lord Wriothesley in the tableaux. But so far as Ph\u0153be was affected, her first inclination was to cry out in triumph, what would he say now about her being made a toy of, or a butt even, by the great people up at Brock cotes, and of the certain injury she would sustain from the connexion ? But he would not have faith in her intimate union with Lord Wriothesley, or if he put any weight on the young lord's intentions \u2014 and Barty was too honourable himself to dare to brand Lord Wriothesley's intentions as other than honourable \u2014 he might consider an all but indefinite engagement no great acquisition to"], [279, "To be or not to be. 269 either the man or the woman concerned. Not less striking was the disparity between Barty Wooler and Lord Wriothesley than that between Mrs. Wooler and the Countess and Lady Dorothea. Here was Lord Wrio- thesley, perilously exalted and with innumer- able complicated responsibilities imposed upon him, at half Barty Wooler's age. There was Barty, a wanderer on the face of the earth, frankly owning no allegiance unless to his mother. Certainly his allegiance to the Clays and their commercially-gathered wealth was not very marked. They might hold the reins of their business and fortune in their shrunk and shrivelled hands to the last. Barty's was an isolated, desultory life, and Ph\u0153be had repulsed his one serious overture for a settlement and a home. She was not to blame for this, any more than for the conquest of Lord Wriothesley. She would have held herself the vainest, most"], [280, "Noblesse Oblige. 270 presumptuous, and unwomanly girl to have predicted either to herself beforehand. Ph\u0153be was impatient with herself, be cause Barty's forlorn state and unachieved fame would rise up in her mind, and, in the midst of her flutter of ambition and gratifi cation over Lord Wriothesley's marvellous tribute, confront and smite her with a pang at the contrast. And Barty Wooler's attributes sank to zero beside those of Lord Wriothesley, when Ph\u0153be thought of the two men. There was only one point in which Barty could claim pre-eminence, but it was in a strong point to a generous heart, for it was in that of a beaten man. Although Ph\u0153be was indig nant with herself, she could not help being disturbed with pity and compunction on his account. Ph\u0153be pursued her endless speculations in endless errands and walks abroad, under"], [281, "To be or not to be. 271 the May skies, with no escort or companion but little Bess. She was fleeing from her mother's tongue and her father's eye ; she had on her the fever of spirit which would not let her sit still and contemplate her own rising sun. Yet she had greater freedom than she had ever possessed. Mrs. Paston had never been so long of one mind before, and her present mind was to allow Ph\u0153be all her own way, unless when she wounded and piqued her, by fairly paying her court. As to Mr. Paston, he had said never a word to Ph\u0153be on the development of his relations with Brockcotes. He was rather incUned to avoid his daughter at the present stage of the proceeding. It was true, as Mrs. Paston had said, that he could not stand in his own child's light, and that, in his perfect innocence, it seemed harder still that anyone should ask him to do so. But all his relations with Lord Exmoor, his pri-"], [282, "272 Noblesse Oblige. vate history, and his honour, about which he was morbidly sensitive, filled him with a tumult of distress. He would not stand in Ph\u0153be's light, but he would have shut his door against Lord Wriothesley, and not thrown it wide to him, if he had guessed what his Lordship's step on the threshold boded. He would have thrust his right hand in the fire to have seen Ph\u0153be the wife of Barty Wooler. In the meantime, Mr. Paston was by no means so sure as Ph\u0153be was of the staunch determination of Lord Wriothesley. The young man might be turned from an un suitable fancy, born of excitement, over exertion, and succeeding languor. It might be but an idle fancy, after all. Very unfortunate was it that Mrs. Paston's mind was so much of a sieve ; but then she was under a certain amount of restraint to wards the public, and she would not dare,"], [283, "To be or not to be. 273 for fear of the Exmoors, and lest she herself should mar her daughter's great expecta tions, to do more than hint to the world the probable exaltation of a member of her family.

Mrs. Paston was like a child indulging in fantastic day-dreams \u2014 practising spiritual curtsies to Ph\u0153be in her drawing-room at Wooers' Alley. Mr. Paston was moody and unhappy as he worked in his painting-room.

Moreover, she was so formidable an old lady, that Ph\u0153be had very little doubt, that if she did not go down to Mrs. Edgecumbe of her own will, Mrs. Edge cumbe would think nothing of sending up to fetch her down by force. When Mrs. Edgecumbe had received Ph\u0153be, and seated her beside herself on the box-seat, she drove off with the assurance that there was not the smallest cause for nervousness, since she had learned to drive a drag in Chin Bagot's day.

The Latimers, contrary to expectation, remained in London, until it did not seem worth while to come down and celebrate Lady Dorothea's marriage till the end of the season. It was no disappointment to Ph\u0153be, but a reprieve. She did not long for another look of Lord Wriothesley, and she was even piteously sensitive to the fact that she had always wished and wearied for the coming of the family and Lady Doro thea."], [305, "A Surprise. 295 Then Ph\u0153be had other engagements. On the first of June her cousins, the Halls, paid a long-promised visit to Wellfield. Though it was only of three days' duration, on ac count of the Halls being on their way to the seaside, where Jane \u2014 Mrs. Connel \u2014 had been ordered to recruit from an illness, it had the effect of relieving somewhat the even tenor of Ph\u0153be's days. \" We are packed off a month before other people,\" Olive had complained confidentially to Ph\u0153be ; \" but it is so like Jane, not merely to have an illness \u2014 perhaps she could not help that \u2014 but to expect the family plans to be changed and upset for her, as if she had remained a member of the family.

But you must not be angry with us if we don't swoon with wonder and delight at the provincial palace.\" Ph\u0153be was glad that they had come to Wellfield when the family at Brockcotes were from home. Yet how should she feel now at going up to the great old show-place, and making a display to her cousins of the relics and the magnificence which might one day be hers, in which she had already a breathless interest, and when she was not sure if it were not sacrilege in her to approach them?

Ph\u0153be was still gladder that the Halls had arrived at an epoch when her mother, unable to stand alone, and receiving no sup port from her father and her, was suffering from reaction. She had fallen from a state of exultation into one of despondency, when she could do nothing save hear Folksbridge V news, and deliver fitful, feeble moralisings on the uncertainty of human affairs, the de ceitfulness of men, the sauciness of girls, and, above all, the folly of putting reliance on the great. \" I suppose Aunt Paston is vexed because you have contrived to lose sight of Barty"], [309, "A Surprise. 299 Wooler,\" argued Olive Hall, who was the clever woman of the family. \" I don't wonder that she is displeased by that per formance, Ph\u0153be ; for most mothers would take it to heart, and most daughters would live to regret it. Of course, I hope you may be the exception, though I gave you good advice the other way, you perverse puss. Kate, with all her fine-lady feelings and fancies, is not half so perverse. I suppose, besides, that my aunt attributes a good deal of your sauciness to your chance association with these besotted great people up yonder.

Naturally it was not particularly agree able to Ph\u0153be to be reminded, at this date, of the inequality of her companionship with Lady Dorothea, but she would a thousand times rather have it so than that Olive, or any of the Halls should have the faintest inkling of the real state of matters. She could not be sufficiently thankful that Frank,, who had a lawyer's acumen for a secret, had not accompanied his sisters to Wellfield. Without Brockcotes, Ph\u0153be would have found it a little difficult to entertain her cousins. They were accustomed to the stir and variety of a large town. They visited a great deal without having anything like"], [311, "A Surprise. 301 hereditary friendships or intimacies between them and the members of the wealthy mer chants' families at Folksbridge. The Halls had become wonderfully dependent for en tertainment, in the course of their single generation, on the appendages and luxuries of the coach-house, the toilet, and the table, and missed them, as Jane showed, even for the shortest interval. Olive was energetic, and testified her dissatisfaction by restless ness and uncertainty of temper. Jane and Kate suffered from languor and ennui. Olive was clever, once. Ph\u0153be had thought Olive almost as clever as Frank ; but a wider experience of cleverer, more original people, in Barty Wooler, Lord Wriothesley, and Lady Dorothea, had shown Ph\u0153be that three-fourths of Olive's cleverness consisted in a strong will, some power of application and comparison, toge ther with a quick capacity for detecting"], [312, "Noblesse Oblige. 302 errors, and a ready sense of the ridiculous. But Olive was certainly warm-hearted \u2014 more so than Jane and Kate ; and Ph\u0153be, who had lived a year and a half at Garnet Lodge, had yet to learn that this warmth of heart was limited like other gifts of Olive's, and that it might degenerate into family self ishness, which is but an extension of per sonal selfishness. Kate Hall, on the other hand, was not clever, and was without any claim to mental superiority, but she was a much prettier woman than Olive, and had more taste and more pretension to accom plishments. She had even some natural grace and elegance. She had a talent, as all the family knew to their cost, for music and drawing. Ph\u0153be was in the court with the Halls, receiving the somewhat \u2022 damping opinion from Olive that all the Wooers' Alley roses, carnations, and heartsease were worth no-"], [313, "A Surprise. 303 thing, with the additional depressing infor mation that to get and keep fine specimens, such as they had at Garnet Lodge, called for an ample outlay of money, and at least one trained gardener. At the same time, Ph\u0153be was trying to divert Kate from pulling idly at the whole of the salvia for a bouquet, when Mrs. Connel came running out to them with an important piece of in telligence. \" See how Jane can run when she has got something in her head,\" commented OUve. \" I declare she looks as animated as she used to do before her marriage.\" \"You may be glad Walter Connel did not hear you say that,\" corrected Kate. \" I don't think I may.

Mrs. Connel interrupted Olive. \" Come into the house, you three,\" she summoned the others breathlessly. \" There is a visitor, and who do you think ? Lord Wriothesley. He came down from town yesterday. I heard him say so, and that the rest of the family are coming to-mor row. If we are to see Brockcotes, it must be to-day ; and if you wish to see him, you had better be quick, for he was shown into the drawing-room beside Aunt Paston and me at the very moment when I was letting her see how we arranged our table-napkins ; and, of course, I cannot tell how long he may stay.\" \" Oh, do make haste !\" Kate urged, as poor Ph\u0153be blushed and hesitated. \" I"], [315, "A Surprise. 305 should like above all things to be in com pany with Lord Wriothesley.
