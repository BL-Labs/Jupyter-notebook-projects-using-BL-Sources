The wedding was over, or perhaps it Avould be more correct to say, the marriage ceremony, for with the word \" wedding \" are associated ideas of festivity and rejoicing, of Avhich, on the present occasion, there Avas a lamentable de- ficiency. Escorted by the beadle, avIio for his services received from the bride the munificent donation of one shilling, William Ashford entered a cab Avith his new-made wife and his daughter, and returned to his own house, a dingy looking tenement in one of the streets near the NeAV Road. Some twenty years be fore, he had been a model of health and activity, pulling a good oar, handling a bat like the man VOL. i. l"], [10, "2 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. who had invented it, singing a good song, en joying life Avithout an ache or pain, without a care 'or sorrow. Now, at forty-five years of age, he was a decrepit old man, with Avatery eye, trembling hand, and vacillating purpose. William Ashford's father had been private secretary to one of the members of the Ad dington Administration, and tAvo years before his death had obtained for his son \u2014 at that time a youth of eighteen years of age \u2014 a clerkship in one of the public offices, Avhere his polished manners and attention to his duties soon Avon for him the regard and confidence of his superiors. Before many years elapsed, when an increase of salary allowed him to indulge in such a luxury, to took unto himself a Avife. The young lady whom he selected Avas Miss Mary Baines, the orphan daughter of Archdeacon Baines, a man of good family, and who, had he lived, Avould in all probability have been pro moted to the episcopal bench. She was a pretty, amiable girl, with a small fortune of her own, and some of her friends hinted to her that she might do much better for herself in the matrimonial market. But both her parents"], [11, "3 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. were dead, she had no near relations, she was her OAvn mistress, she was in love, and. she persevered in the choice she had made. Nor for some time had she any reason to repent it. Two children Avere born, a boy, and a few years later a girl, and the happy mother was congratulated by all her acquaintance, and con gratulated herself, upon affording a specimen of perfect domestic happiness. Their income, without being large, was quite sufficient for all the comforts and some of the luxuries of life. Mrs Ashford Avas an excellent manager, and her husband even contrived to insure his life for a small sum. But alas ! this happiness was not destined to be of long duration. William Ashford, Avho during his bachelor days had never knoAvn Avhat it Avas to pass an evening at home, avIio was naturally of a convivial turn, Avhose tender ditties and comic songs made him the enfant gate of the society in which he lived, began to grow Aveary of domestic pleasures, and to sigh for the old scenes of his social triumphs . Invitations AArere given and accepted. Mrs Ashford Avas not in strong health, and she found that she had too much to do Avith her"], [12, "4 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. children and her household duties to be able often to accompanyhim. Soon she got the repu tation of being a moping, poor-spirited, unsocial being, and it not unfrequently happened that her husband Avas asked out without her. Poor William Ashford Avas universally pitied, par ticularly by the ladies of his acquaintance, for being tied to so uncongenial a companion, a delusion which I am afraid he did not discourage. It is so pleasant to be the object of female commiseration, and every one felt him, or her, self bound to make him all possi ble amends for his unhappy fate. Mrs Ashford made no complaints, not even Avhen some good-natured friend informed her of a surreptitious Avhite-bait dinner given by her husband to a select party at BlackAvall, from AA'hich the said friend had, to her great indig nation, been excluded. It is true,' Mary Ash ford could not very Avell have joined the party, being in close attendance upon little Harry, Avho Avas dangerously ill Avith the hoopino-. cough. But Avhen she found that monev was every day more difficult to obtain for her house hold expenditure, when the servants were un-"], [13, "5 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. paid, and tradesmen grevv clamorous for the settlement of their \"little accounts,\" she thought herself justified in remonstrating. But not Avith much success. Her husband felt, or at all events professed, surprise at the embarrassed state of his affairs, and could not understand hoAv it had all happened. It must be Mary's mismanagement. The first day he had time he Avould look into it, and put things to rights. Unfortunately he never had time, and things, instead of being put to rights, went from bad to Avorse. The fact is, his position was materially al tered from Avhat it had been before his marri age. From being the entertained he found that he Avas now expected to be the entertainer, and even in joint affairs he Avas generally called upon to pay the score of some two or three thoughtless individuals avIio had forgotten their purses. It Avas no wonder therefore that Avith a Avife and two children, notAvithstanding the addition to his income from Mary's little fortune, he should be perpetually in Avant of ready money, and shrank from the sorroAving face which greeted him on his return home. His"], [14, "6 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. hours became more irregular, or rather more regular in their irregularity, and Avhen he did make his appearance it was generally in a state of semi-intoxication. He had culled many choice aphorisms from his favourite bards, inculcating the doctrine that good liquor is the best antidote for dull care, and he certainly did his best to prove his faith in its efficacy. More than once had he thrown himself on his bed, after stumbling up-stairs, dressed as he was, and snored away the hours of night in the feverish slumber of the drunkard, while his wife, with the tears trickling down her face and heavy forebodings in her heart, tried to catch a few moments' rest in the arm-chair by his side. It is but justice to say that the first time this disgusting exhibition took place, he was greatly shocked on waking, gave signs of deep and sincere penitence, and promised amend ment on his knees. ' But what are promises, what are vows or oaths, to the victim of a dom inant passion. Before a week had passed the same thing occurred again, and this time, in stead of penitence, was succeeded by a fit of sulkiness."], [15, "7 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Mrs Ashford, finding that she had no assist ance to hope for except from herself, did her best to counteract the evils with which she was beset. Her only brother, much older than herself, had emigrated many years before to Australia, and, as he had not been heard of since his departure, it was very generally sup posed that he was dead. Her other relations, disgusted Avith her husband's conduct \u2014 some of them even insulted by him for what he termed impertinent interference \u2014 had gradually ceased to frequent his house. Thus, she stood alone in the Avorld, Avith no one to support her, no one of whom she could ask advice. But she had to provide, if possible, for the welfare of her two children, and she did not shrink from the task. She began by introducing the strict est economy into her household. One of their two servants was dismissed, and she undertook without a murmur her share of the house-work. The clays were past when she could take a pride in the appearance of her darlings, but at least by her care their dress was still decent and scrupulously clean. All their early edu cation came from her, and well she thought"], [16, "8 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. herself repaid by their affection for the atten tion she lavished upon them. Of their father they saAv but little, and desired to see less, for he hardly noticed them, except to utter a re primand or a drunken curse. But even this made less impression on them than the taunts and abuse with Avhich he loaded his helpless Avife, whenever he came home in an ill-humour, and of which they were but too frequently the witnesses. For he no longer thought it neces sary to put the slightest restraint upon himself in his own house, and was fast sinking into the loAvest depths of degradation. The only person of whom he seemed to stand the least in awe was Sarah, their solitary servant, a strapping north-country Avench, who gave him plainly to understand that, though he might bully Avife and children with impunity, he had better attempt nothing of the same sort Avith her. She was certainly not a servant that Mrs Ashford would have selected in her palmy days, but it was not easy to find a maid-of-all-work for such an establishment as theirs ; and Sarah Penge, though coarse and rough in manner, and not distinguished by any particular de-"], [17, "9 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. votion to cleanliness, appeared to be honest, professed a certain amount of attachment to \"the Missus,\" and Avas undoubtedly hard working. The most frequent subject of contention betAveen William Ashford and his Avife Avas, naturally, money. The interest of Mrs Ash ford's fortune, amounting to about one hun dred and eighty pounds a year, had fortunately been settled entirely upon herself, to her separate use during her life. If she died before her husband, he had a life-interest in it, and then it was to go to her children. This was all that she had had of late years to keep the house going, for the Avhole of her husband's salary was spent on his OAvn pursuits, generally before it AA*as due, and consequently he made repeated but ineffectual onslaughts on his wife's little horde. Coaxing and threats were equally unavailing. Upon the few pounds she could call her OAvn her children's bread de pended, and she guarded them Avith the most jealous care. But she felt her health gradually sinking in this continual strife, and she Avas filled with the most alarming apprehensions for"], [18, "10 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. the future fate of those Avhose only protector she was. She had ahvays been delicate, and noAV she noticed symptoms Avhich induced her to speak to Dr Scott, the medical man who at tended the family, and he thought so seriously of them that he persuaded her to consult an eminent physician, a friend of his own. The great man listened, and said but little. He gave her a prescription, advised her to live generously, to avoid all occasions of mental excitement, and to pass the ensuing winter in the south of France, or some mild climate. He might as well have recommended her to pass it in the moon. She thanked him Avith a sickly smile, and returned home to prepare for death. She determined to make a last appeal to her husband, hoping that a knoAvledge of her clanger, and of the unprotected state in Avhich her children Avould be left by her death, might awaken him to some sense of Avhat he OAved to her and to them. She was destined to be grievously disappointed. That very evening. he burst into the room in Avhich she Avas sit ting Avith her children, hearing little Harry his Latin lesson, for to teach her son she had"], [19, "11 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. learnt it herself, and frantic \"with drink de manded money of her with more violent threats than he had ever before used. Her ansAver Avas a refusal couched in the gentlest terms she could select, but Avhich only served to inflame his passion. In vain she entreated him, if not for her sake, at least for his own, to remain quietly at home for that one night. She might as well have argued Avith a madman . He seized her by the arm, and notwithstand ing her resistance dragged her keys from her pocket, opened her desk, and seized upon every farthing it contained. It was not a bad haul, for she had received her half-year's divi dend only a few days before. Fortunately, she had paid her few outstanding debts. Clinging to his knees in desperation, she en deavoured to prevent his leaving the room, Avhen Avith a fierce execration he struck her, and flung her off with a violence that left her lying half stunned upon the floor. Then rushing downstairs he left the house, and did not make his appearance for eight and forty hours. Slowly raising herself, Mary Ashford threw"], [20, "12 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. herself on the sofa in an agony of grief and tears. Physically, the blow she had received was little or nothing ; morally, it Avas mortal, for it deprived her of her last hope. Harry and his little sister, almost stupefied by the scene they had witnessed, approached the sofa, and, as if guessing at the need she had for sympathy, endeavoured to attract her atten tion by their caresses. But for a time they were unheeded, although it was for them that her tears were flowing. At length she started up and, drawing them to her in a passionate embrace, kissed them, as if each kiss were to be the last. \" Promise me, Harry,\" she said, \" that you will never drink wine or spirits.\" \" I never will, Mamma,\" he replied stoutly. \"And I too, Mamma,\" interposed Susan. \" Make me promise too.\" \"And Harry,\" continued Mrs Ashford, \" you will always love your sister. She is the youngest, and will need your protection.\" From this time her health gave way alto gether, though not rapidly. It seemed as if the intense love she felt for her children en abled her to contest the ground with the ene-"], [21, "13 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. my inch by inch, but, though sIoav, his pro gress was sure, and the end came at last. At times, in some half sober intervals, her husband appeared to have a perception of the truth, and then in a fit of maudlin remorse he Avould throw himself on his knees, implore her pardon, and for the thousandth time promise amendment. Her death was rather sudden, and Avhen Sarah hurried off in search of her master she found him, Avith some little difficulty, occupying the president's chair of some convivial meeting of real good felloAvs like himself, singing one of his most rollicking drinking songs, and already considerably the worse for liquor. Sarah did not find it by any means an easy matter to gain admittance, nor when she did, to make him understand the urgency of the case. Some of his companions declared that it was all a sham of his Avife's to get him home, that if he Avas such a milksop as to obey, they would never acknowledge him as their president again, and finally that they Avould not allow him to depart. But there were one or two' not quite so far gone, with a little more feeling, or at least with a stronger sense of decency,"], [22, "14 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. AATho insisted upon his going home, if it were only to ascertain the truth ; if it was a sham he could ahvays return, and it Avould be a Avarn ing to him for the future. At length a com promise Avas affected. On condition of his singing another song, and Sarah's drinking a glass of hot gin and Avater, a demand with which she very readily complied, she Avas al loAved to carry off her captive. AVith some trouble she got him up-stairs, when throwing open the bed-room door \u2014 \"Well, old woman,\" he exclaimed, \"A\\4iat's the row- iioav ? \" \"Silence, Sir,\" said Dr Scott, aa*1io had been summoned; \"sflence; you are in the presence of death.\" And seizing him by the hand he dragged him forward to the bed, on which Mary Ashford's inanimate form re posed. She had died a quarter of an hour before, probably about the time when the cheers and encores Avhich greeted his last song Avere still ringing in his ears. The shock sobered him at once. He fell upon the bed, and gave vent in loud lamenta tions to his unavailing repentance. He stretch-"], [23, "15 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. ed out his arm to his weeping children, but his children recoiled from the preferred embrace, and Harry, with a scoavI upon his countenance, drew his sister to the other side of the bed. The doctor retired, and Sarah, partly by force, partly by persuasion, prevailed upon her master to leave the room. She then returned and carried off the children, who sobbed them selves to sleep in each other's arms. Well might they Aveep for the death of one Avhose loss was irreparable to both \u2014 to her daughter especially, AA'hose excitable and pas sionate temperament required the most judi ous management and the unremitting vigilance of a mother's eye. During the few days that elapsed before the funeral, Ashford remained at home, never stirring out of the house except when his brandy bottle required replenishing, passing his time in tears and bewailing his own misfortunes. Of his children he saw but little. BetAveen him and his son a sort of mutual antipathy seemed to have sprung up, awaiting only the occasion to break out into open dissension. With Susan he got on better, but even she"], [24, "16 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. could scarcely conceal her repugnance, when he took her in his arms and kissed her, with lips reeking of spirits and bad tobacco. The day for the funeral arrived, but he was not in a state to leave the house. It Avas conducted on the most economical scale, and was attended by Dr Scott and the two children. Sarah, by dint of actual bullying, had extracted from her master money enough to put them into some thing like decent mourning. On occasion of his wife's death Ashford had obtained leave of absence from his office for a month, Avhich he took upon himself to prolong from day to day, till a peremptory or der summoned him back to his duties on pain of immediate dismissal. His irregularities for some time past had been the subject of very unfavourable comments, and Avhen he pre sented himself before the Chairman of the Board with blanched lips, trembling hands, and Avatery eye, that functionary eyed him Avith a look in Avhich there Avas a strong mixture of severity, contempt, and compassion. He had knoAvn Ashford's father Avell, and it was through his influence that the young man had been in-"], [25, "17 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. troduced into the office. For some years he had prided himself upon the regularity and attention of his protege; but when his love of dissipation had become a habit, when day after day he made his appearance an hour or two later than the proper time, he remonstrated Avith him on his conduct in terms which gra dually became more severe. Latterly, finding that his forbearance was of no avail, he had administered some sharp reprimands to the offender, which for a day or two produced some slight amendment. On the present occasion he felt that the time for indulgence was past. Ashford had been ten days absent without leave, and even now was evidently not in a fit state to resume his duties. \" Mr Ashford,\" he said, \" I have sent for you to tell you that, on the very next occasion of neglect or violation of the rules of this office, you will be summarily dismissed. The public has a right to expect the service for which it pays to be performed scrupulously and punc tually.\" Ashford Avhimpered out something about his recent affliction. VOL. I. 2"], [26, "18 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" I am quite aware of the loss you have sus- tained,\" was the reply. \" You had a month's leave of absence in consequence, which you have thought proper to extend to nearly six Aveeks. I shall not inquire into the manner in which that time has been spent. That is no business of mine, but it is my business to see that my subordinates do their duty. For that I am responsible, and it is quite clear to me that Avith the habits you have acquired you will never be again fit for yours. As I have already said, your next transgression will be your last, but I have no wish to be hard upon you. I had, as you know, a great regard for your father, and, as long as your conduct war- ranted it, for you too. For the sake of old times, I Avill yet make an effort to save you. There is going to be a reduction in the num- ber of clerks, aud if you choose to send in your resignation, I will undertake to obtain for you, in consideration of your service of twenty-five years, a retiring pension of two hundred a year. If you refuse this, and are dismissed in consequence of any complaint of"], [27, "19 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. your conduct, of course you will lose all claim to it.\" Again Ashford's tears began to flow, as he protested that he Avas the victim of the envy and jealousy of interested persons, but his chief did not give him time to enlarge on this topic. \" Go home,\" he said, \" think it over, and let me have your decision to-morroAV.\" He did go home, but as for thinking it over, that Avas an exertion of which he Avas in capable. He called Sarah into council, and by her advice accepted the proposal. The arrangements were easily completed, and Wil liam Ashford Avas superannuated upon an al loAvance of tAvo hundred and fifty pounds per annum. The chairman had been better than his Avord. Since his wife's death, Sarah, or Mrs Penge as she noAV insisted upon being called, had acquired great influence over her master. As soon as Mrs Ashford's funeral Avas over, she had announced her intention of seeking another situation, a piece of intelligence Avhich in his helplessness struck Ashford Avith dismay. With tears in his eyes, which were now ahvays"], [28, "20 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. ready to Aoav upon the slightest occasion, he threw himself upon her mercy, entreating her not to desert him in his utmost need. She took pity on him, aud consented to remain, but upon her own terms, and if they Avere ex orbitant, they were, at all events, the only ones upon which the household could be maintained in anything like respectability. His income was to be paid over to her as it came in, out of which he Avas to receive a weekly allowance ; the rest was to be devoted to the support of the family at her discretion. He undertook to contract no debt without her knowledge and consent, nor to admit any of his boon com panions into the house. All this he promised with a readiness which almost made it appear that he was receiving a favour, instead of giv ing up his independence. And yet this same man, who yielded so readily to the imperious exigencies of a coarse, resolute servant, had invariably rejected with something like scorn any suggestion of a similar nature coming from the lips of his unfortunate wife ! But if Sarah thus established a despotism as her form of government, it was a despotism"], [29, "21 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. tempered by gin and Avater. She never at tempted to insist upon her master's breaking off those habits which had become to him a second nature, but she did attempt and actually succeeded in making him pass his evenings at home. Ashford had long since been rejected by the more respectable circles in Avhich he had begun his career of self-indulgence, and now, after passing through various stages of degradation, had sunk into the habitue of the tap-room. But this by no means suited Mrs Penge's ideas of gentility. Her pride revolted from the idea of keeping house for a fre quenter of the gin-palace or public-house, the associate of pugilists and dog-fanciers, and \"them Ioav scum.\" The victory had not been Avon without a contest. Mr Ashford Avas fond of society of some sort or other, or rather he had a horror of his own, and in asserting his rights in this particular he shoAved more resolu tion than Avas usual to him. But at length he was forced to succumb. Sarah's first great success was depriving him of his latch-key, and this was the key of his position. AVhen she had achieved this the rest Avas easy. The first"], [30, "22 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. night after this deprivation he returned home about twelve o'clock, and raised such an alarum that a policeman made his appearance, and insisted upon the door being opened to the truant. He cast a look of drunken tri umph on the baffled foe as he staggered up stairs, but on the next night his star set for ever. The knocker had been removed, and the bell was muffled. After nearly an hour spent in vain attempts to gain admittance to his own house he raised the siege, and was glad to find a bed for the night in the public house he had just quitted. When he returned home next day it Avas Avith a very penitent and sheepish look, and he subsequently acknoAV ledged his conversion to his housekeeper's creed, that the proper place for a gentleman to take his liquor in is in his own parlour. And as, after all, drinking alone is but an uninteresting occupation, Mrs Penge by de grees allowed herself to be persuaded to bear him company \u2014 partly out of compassion, partly because she was not averse to a cheerful glass herself, though, to do her justice, it was ahvays in moderation \u2014 partly because it was useless to"], [31, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 23 keep two fires burning in kitchen and parlour when one Avould suffice, and partly because her eyes Avere opening to more ambitious views. Her authority over the household was now paramount, established upon too firm a basis to be shaken. She had made the acquisition of a stout, red-haired girl from the workhouse, Avho did all the drudgery for half-a-crown a week and her food, Avhile Susan was employed all day long with her needle in darning, mend ing, and patching the linen and furniture. She and her brother were tolerably fed, and warm ly, if coarsely, clad. On the subject of their material wants they had no great cause for complaint, but great was their indignation Avhen their father's housekeeper took upon her self to call them by their Christian names. Harry rebelled in all the dignity of sixteen, persisted in calling her Sarah, and Avas only reduced to silence, though not to submission, by having his ears soundly boxed by his fa ther, to whom Mrs Penge had carried com plaints of his impertinence. Fortunately for the boy he found a friend when he most needed one. Dr Scott, pitying"], [32, "24 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. the forlorn condition of the two children, thus in a manner left orphans by the death of the only parent who felt an interest in their fate, did his best to befriend them. He had taken a great interest in the unhappy Avife who had borne her misfortunes with so much gentleness and resignation, and he extended it to her off spring. To Susan it was not of much use. Backed by Mr Ashford's authority, Sarah re fused to allow his daughter to accept any of the kind-hearted doctor's invitations. Susan Avas wanted in the house ; Susan had no time to Avaste in visiting about, she must learn to make herself useful. But Avith Harry it Avas different. Ashford had no wish to have per petually under his eye the son whom he inva riably designated as a mutinous scoundrel, AA'hose sullen looks and short answers were a constant source of irritation and reproach, and Avhose untimely fate at the hands of Mr Cal craft he would generally predict and deplore before the last tumbler was drained. Nor was Mrs Penge more anxious for his society. He treated her Avith a sort of contempt extremely offensive to her feelings, and she looked upon"], [33, "25 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. him in the light of a spy upon her actions. Moreover, she made the discovery that Susan was much more amenable to her control in his absence. No opposition therefore Avas offered to Dr Scott's proposal to take him as an ap prentice Avithout a premium, and bring him up to his OAvn profession. He Avas still t.o sleep and take his meals at home. The field being thus clear, Sarah pursued her operations Avith as much skill as vigour, and, before the expiration of the second year after Mary Ashford's death, received and gra ciously accepted the- disconsolate AAidower's proposal to her to fill the vacant post. Harry had seen what was going] on for some time past, and had warned his sister of Avhat she might expect before long ; still Avhen Mr Ash ford screAved up his courage to make knoAvn his intention to his children, it sounded like the knell of the small portion of happiness Avhich they still enjoyed. They remained silent, till their father, irritated at Avhat he justly considered as a sign of disapprobation, asked them sharply if they had nothing to say, instead of standing there like a couple of fools."], [34, "26 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" lAvishyou very happy, papa,\" said Susan, in a trembling voice. \" And you, sir, what have you to say ? \" asked Ashford of his son. \"I think, sir, you cannot fail of being happy in so suitable a marriage.\" Ashford's pale face reddened at this reply, but as he had no retort at hand, and as Harry, avIio Avas now in his eighteenth year, was a little too old and a good deal too stout to have personal chastisement inflicted on him, he contented himself Avith dismissing them from his presence, with an injunction to treat Mrs Penge with the respect due to his future wife and their mother. \" Our mother ! \" exclaimed Harry, as soon as he was alone with his sister, \" Sarah our mother ! Fancy our oavii mother replaced by such a woman as that ! \" \" Oh, Harry, try to be civil to her. You will only make things Avorse,\" said Susan. \" I do not Avell see how that can be. But as far as I am concerned I shall be neither civil nor uncivil to her, for when once she is"], [35, "27 SIR HUBERT MARSTON.

And on the present occasion the cause of Susan's grief was to her one of triumph. She had got rid of one whom she disliked, and instinctively felt might be a dangerous enemy, and she could not bear that any one should deplore his loss. SheAvas one of those Avho expected every one else to laugh when she smiled, and to weep when she was annoyed. Mr and Mrs Ashford, having but little ro mance in their compositions, did not think it necessary to celebrate their honeymoon by spending their money in a second-rate inn or uncomfortable lodgings. Like sensible peo ple, they settled down at once in their own house, and made no more difference in the usual routine of their daily life than if they had been married tAventy years. The only exception Avas a rather more elaborate din ner than usual on their wedding-day, to which Mr Samuel Penge, the nephew already alluded to, Avas an invited guest. That young gentle man, although at the epoch of his aunt's mar-"], [39, "31 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. riage only twenty-two years of age, had ex perienced many vicissitudes of fortune. His first appearance in public life had been as a factory boy, but his tastes were far too ele vated to allow him to remain long'in that capa city. He was fortunate enough to procure a situation as pot-boy in a well-known establish ment in his native town, and after a sufficient probation he was promoted to the more re sponsible office of Boots. In this employment he remained for about a year, till, at the promptings of ambition, and aided by a loan which he successfully negociated with a purse that had been forgotten in the pocket of a coat he was employed to brush, he deter mined to transfer his domicile to London. Here for some time he occupied himself in provid ing nutriment for the canine and feline inhabit ants of the neighbourhood in which he lived. Then he might have been seen parading the streets in gorgeous attire, a component letter in an ambulatory placard. Lower than this he never sank. By a sudden turn of the Avheel he found himself driver of a Hansom cab, but having, by some unexplained act of injustice"], [40, "32 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. on the part of the sitting magistrate, been de prived of his licence, he was at the present moment employed in the stables of an eminent horse-dealer, in which school of the fine arts he had acquired a certain polish of manner, Avhich his previous avocations had left him but little leisure to cultivate. From that time feAv were the evenings on which Mr Penge did not favour the Ashfords Avith his company. To Mr Ashford all society Avas pretty much alike, as long as he found some one to drink and smoke Avith him, and listen to his interminable and not very inter esting stories of the injustice Avith which he had been treated by an ungrateful country. Mrs Ashford was naturally glad to see a nephew, of whose accomplishments she was proud, established on a footing of intimacy in the house she had made her OAvn, and Mr Penge himself suffered no ill-timed bashful ness or timidity on his part to interfere Avith his aunt's benevolent designs in his behalf. Still there were limits to this indulgence. He might call Mr Ashford \" old chap,\" and \" old felloAV,\" and address Susan by her Christian"], [41, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 33 name Avithout reproof; but he was never able to obtain permission to introduce any of his friends and acquaintances into his terrestrial paradise. Mrs Ashford had strong family affections, and this Avas her best point. She did not grudge her nepheAv his suppers and his tumblers of toddy, but she had no idea of being eaten out of house and home by any one unconnected Avith her by blood. Besides, she could noAV ahvays bring the conviviality of the evening to an end, Avhen, in her opinion, the two companions had had as much as was good for them. \" A., that's your last glass,\" was a decree from which there wras no appeal, and Avhich no amount of coaxing could ever induce her to rescind. Husband and nephew bowed to it alike, but with strangers it Avould be ex- tremely difficult, if not impossible, to enforce her authority with the same effect. After one or tAvo attempts on the part of Mr Samuel to induce his aunt to take a more extended view of the duties of hospitality, he gave it up as a bad job, and as for Mr Ashford, he Avas too Avell contented with the existence provided for him to Avish for a change. VOL. I, 3"], [42, "34 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. But if Mr Ashford was contented with his existence, it Avas far from being the case Avith his daughter. In fact, it is impossible to con ceive a more unhappy position than that in which Susan now found herself; without a friend or companion, without any mental oc cupation, with scarcely a book to read, with no one to shoAV her kindness or sympathy, driven back upon her owai miserable thoughts and melancholy recollections. She dined Avith her father and step-mother, it is true, but that Avas nearly all she saw of them, except when Mrs Ashford brought her some fresh piece of work, some old table-cloth to be mended, or some stockings of her oavii to be darned. The Ashfords were not early risers. Mrs Ashford, avIio before her elevation had been a hard-working Avoman, Avas fast giving way to habits of self-indulgence, and Susan had gener ally had her breakfast in the kitchen with Jane the maid, some hours before the other two made their appearance. This Avas perhaps the least unhappy part of her day, for she could take her work into the parlour, in Avhich a cheerful fire was burning, and steal a hasty"], [43, "35 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. glance at the shipping news in the penny paper, in the hopes of learning something of the Blake, the ship Avhich bore Harry and his fortunes. As soon as her father or Mrs Ash ford appeared, she Avas dismissed to her own room, in wrhich she generally remained till dinner time. From the evening symposium she Avas excluded, quite as much by her oavii wishes as by anything else. The degradation of her father, the vulgarity of Mrs Ashford, the insolent familiarity of her nephew, filled her with disgust and shame, and something like fear. The day closed pretty much as it had begun. She retreated to the kitchen and had her tea with Jane, avIio enlivened the evening Avith recounting some of her work house experiences, generally more curious than edifying. Jane was a good-natured girl, but as she placed the summum bonum of life in en suring the greatest amount of 'wittals' at the least possible cost of labour, she could not quite enter into Susan's feelings. And at night, Avhen she sought the cold dismal attic that Avas allotted to her for her bed-room, the sense of her utter desolation"], [44, "36 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. came upon her Avith redoubled force. One by one she Avould take out and contemplate, with something like veneration, the little memorials of the mother Avho had so loved her, Avhose darling she had been ; of the brother, Avhose temper was so violent and uncertain, and avIio yet to her had ever been gentle and tender. Once she had heard from him since his de- parture, by a letter dispatched by some ship they had fallen in with near the Line, in which, amidst the most passionate expressions of af- fection, he had promised to write on his ar- rival. There had been plenty of time for him to redeem his promise, but no letter had been received. Was she already forgotten by the only being she loved upon earth, to Avhose pro tection her mother had so earnestly recom mended her ? Thus things went on for some time ; Avhen, in the second year of her Avedded life, Mrs Ashford made the unAvelcome discovery that she was likely to be a mother. Unwelcome in every sense, for she did not like children, she had an almost superstitious dread of the trial that awaited her, and she began to look with"], [45, "37 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. anxiety to the future. Her husband was not likely to be a long-lived man, and his pension died with him. At his death, his children by his first marriage Avould inherit their mother's fortune, and all she could hope for Avas the thousand pounds for Avhich his life was in sured ; the policy on Avhich had always been kept up \u2014 in the first instance by the care of her predecessor, latterly by her own. Under these circumstances, she determined upon a course of rigid economy. Her first move was to give up the house they were iioav living in and to take a cheaper one in the suburbs. Her next idea AAras a brilliant one. \"A.,\" she said, one morning after break fast, \" I do not mean to keep Jane any longer. It is an expense we cannot afford. Susan is hoav fourteen ; she is a strong girl of her age, though she does not look it, and she must help me in the house-Avork. I dare say Ave shall manage it very well betAveen us. At all events we must try.\" Mr Ashford sighed, for though at times he seemed to be almost in a state of imbecility, he recollected the day Avhen such a proposal"], [46, "38 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. would have filled him with indignation ; per haps he thought of the AAife of his youth, and AArondered what her feelings Avould have been, could she have been told that her daughter would be reduced to such a situation. But he hazarded no objection. \" You must do as you like, my dear,\" he said. \" I leave it all to you ; but I must say it is very hard upon me to be brought to such straits in my old age. Only two hundred and fifty pounds a year for having given up all the best years of my life to the service of my country ! \" And the wretched man began to cry, and tear his hair after a fashion of his OAvn Avhen in a state of excitement. This plan was carried out to its full extent. Jane Avas discharged, and a small house taken at BaysAvater. Mrs Ashford Avas certainly very active in her superintendence, but beyond that she did not do much in the Avay of Avork. It all fell upon Susan, aat1io, notwithstanding her step-mother's assertion, Avas not a strong girl of her age. But though taxed beyond her powers, she made no complaint ; indeed, she"], [47, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 39 had almost lost the power. She had sunk into a state of apathy from Avhich there was nothing to rouse her, not even hope for the future, for no new*s came \"from her brother, and she felt completely abandoned by all. Something seemed to tell her that things could not go on much longer in this Avay, that the burthen cast upon her Avas more than she could bear, and she looked forward almost with satis faction to the time, when she should find in death that peace which she had scarcely ever known in life. At length a new direction wras given to her thoughts by the birth of a sister. When first she had heard of the probability of such an event, she thought that the intruder must be an object of abhorrence to her, but when she looked down upon the poor, 'little, helpless being, just born, as it seemed to her, into a Avorld of endless misery and suffering, the w*onian's heart that was beginning to beat within her breast warmed to it at once. She took it in her arms, and kissed it tenderly, an action that seemed to awaken some spark of grateful feeling in the mother."], [48, "40 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" You are not a bad girl, Susan,\" she said. To this compliment Susan made no reply ; she could not bring herself to exchange Avords of courtesy with a woman whom she looked upon with a very natural feeling of dislike, but she showed herself so expert and handy in the management of her little sister, that she was soon recognized as that young lady's especial attendant. By this arrangement her labours Avere someAvhat lightened,. Mrs Ash ford finding it necessary to call in the services of a regular charwoman, who came for several hours every day, and took upon hefself the hardest part of the house-work. And this change did not come before it Avas wanted, for Susan's health and strength were fast sail ing her. Indeed, the doctor who attended Mrs Ashford in her confinement had been so struck by Susan's wan and care-Avorn appear ance, that he had warned her step-mother that, unless more care Avas taken of her, she would in all probability go into a decline. Had she been up and about, in all probability, Mrs Ashford Avould have treated the worthy man as she had Dr Scott, and turned him out of"], [49, "41 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. the house, but that not being the case, she said, ungraciously enough, that Avhen she was out of bed she would see Avhat could be done. But in her heart the doctor's intimation Avas anything but displeasing to her. AVere Susan and her brother out of the Avay, she fancied that there Avould be no difficulty in securing the reversion of their fortune to herself and her child. A short conversation Avith her hus band dispelled this illusion. She learnt that in that case their money would return after Mr Ashford's death to their mother's family. This discovery did not increase her good-Avill to the young girl, who could not be useful to her, even by her death. She was obliged, hoAvever, to treat her with a little more con sideration than formerly ; for Susan, on more than one occasion, had shown something of her brother's spirit, in addition to Avhich she had so completely ingratiated herself with her little charge, that it never was happy or quiet except in her presence. It was not an inter esting, nor even a particularly good-tempered child, but it always had a smile for Susan. Susan could still its cries in its most fractious"], [50, "42 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. mood ; Susan had the art of putting it to sleep when every other expedient failed, and Mrs Ashford Avas delighted at being able to trans fer her duties to other shoulders. And Susan clung to her nursling Avith a love almost ma ternal, as to the only being from whom she could hope for any return of affection. She looked forward to the time when little Rose would console her for the loss of the brother avIio had forgotten her Unconsciously, she did Harry Ashford great injustice. So far from having forgotten her, he had written to her three times from the Cape of Good Hope, Avhere he and his master were established. On arriving there, they heard of a good opening for a medical man, and Mr Barker determined to avail himself of it, instead of proceeding to Australia ; a plan in which his assistant had readily acquiesced. But Harry had done more than write. In each of his last two letters he had enclosed an order for five pounds, payable to Miss Susan Ashford, money painfully scraped to gether, shilling by shilling, or saved by deny ing himself almost the necessaries of life. With"], [51, "43 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. what a feeling of happiness, of honest pride, Avere these missives dispatched ! How anx iously he calculated the days that must elapse before they reached their destination, when Susan would be able to gratify any little fancy she might have to buy a Avarm dress for the Avinter or a bonnet for the summer, without the humiliating necessity of appealing, per haps in vain, to the charity of Sarah, her father's wife. Alas ! this care for his sister's welfare was the cause of unspeakable misery. The letters without the money might have reached her and gladdened her heart ; with it, they Avere not destined to come into her hands. Mrs Ashford, like all good house keepers, kept the key of her letter-box herself, and carefully examined the address and seal of every letter that came to the house. With a very natural curiosity she took upon herself to open those addressed by Harry Ashford to his sister, and, no doubt thinking it a danger ous thing to place so much money in the possession of a young and inexperienced girl, confiscated it to her own proper use. She was not a very ready penwoman, but she con-"], [52, "44 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. trived to indorse the bills with the name of Susan Ashford ; and taking them herself to the bank on Avhich they were drawn, had no dif ficulty in getting them cashed. Of course, the letters in which they had been enclosed were destroyed, and for many months Susan cried herself to sleep each night with vain lamentations over her brother's neglect. Harry himself Avas vexed and surprised at receiving no answers, but, more just, concluded that they had miscarried. He ascertained that the bills had been received and paid, and no suspicion of foul play entered his head. The next year or two passed aAvay without bringing any change in Susan's domestic po sition; but the greater freedom that her office of nurse to her sister had conferred upon her, had been attended by the most beneficial effects to her health. She uoav got regular air and exercise for some hours during the day, Avhile employed in wheeling the child about in a perambulator in Kensington Gar dens or Hyde Park; her manner Avas more cheerful, her spirits more elastic, while her delicately-formed features began to give pro-"], [53, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 45 mise of beauty of no common order, which even the poverty of her dress could not con ceal. She was noAV about sixteen, rather tall for her age, and with a refinement of manner, inherited from her mother, Avhich the menial occupations in which she had been engaged for the last few years could not erase. Even Mr Samuel Penge, Avhose ideas of female beauty in general were not of the most elevated de scription, had more than once expressed his admiration of her charms in exceedingly ener getic and professional language, SAvearing that she Avas the sweetest young filly he had ever set eyes on. But time, under whose auspices Susan's per sonal appearance had improved so rapidly, had not dealt as leniently with her father. He had already had several attacks of delirium tremens, and on the last occasion the doctor had shaken his head in a manner that made Mrs Ashford feel exceedingly uncomfortable. No need to recommend to her the greatest care and attention. She tended the invalid as one on Avhose existence her fortunes de pended. By saving here and paring there"], [54, "46 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. she had put by nearly five hundred pounds, and all he had to leave Avas secured to her by will, \u2014 but Avhat was that ? It would not give her more than sixty or seventy pounds a year at the outside for herself and her child. There were moments when she regretted that she had not treated her step-daughter with more con- sideration. Could Susan be persuaded to keep house with her, she might still manage to live in tolerable comfort. She did make some slight advances, but they were so coldly re- ceived, that, not being endued with much patience or self-control, she lost her temper, and made things, if possible, Avorse than they were before. Besides, it Avas not improbable that the late Mrs Ashford's family, aa-Iio had completely dropped her husband's acquaint ance since he took to his disreputable courses, might in the event of his death come forward, and assert their right to the guardianship of his children. The more she thought of the poverty into which she was likely to be plunged, the less did she see how it Avas to be avoided. At length, after much reflection,"], [55, "47 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. she hit upon a plan Avhich seemed to promise a solution of the problem. \" Sam,\" she said to her nepheAv one even ing, \" I Avonder you have never thought of establishing yourself in life. A good-looking young felloAv like you ought to find no diffi culty in picking up a wife with a bit of money ? \" \"Well, I don't knoAv,\" was the reply. \"Marriage ain't much in my line. There's plenty of good-looking young fellows a-look ing out for rich Avives, and not so many girls as has got the tin to be had.\" \" Ah, but if you have got the girl under your thumb, and an aunt to help you to her, what would you say then ? \" \" If you mean Susan, it's no go. Why, Lord bless you, I can see with half an eye she'd have nothing to say to me. She'd gib and mill too if you come for to try to put that collar over her head. \" \" Well, if you Avon't have her, I dare say there's them that will. She'll have a tidy bit of money when A. goes.\""], [56, "48 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" And that won't be long first, I'm think ing,\" observed Mr Samuel, philosophically. \" But, hoAvsomever, if you must knoAv, there's a young Avoman down Colchester Avay as says she's married to me ; and that's all how and about it.\" Mrs Ashford was a little taken aback by this piece of information, Avhich was perfectly neAv to her, but she Avas not a woman to be daunted by difficulties. \" Well, I never,\" she exclaimed ; \" to go and make a fool of your self like that ! But does she know wThere you are now, and what you are about ? \" \" Not as I knows of. I haven't heard of her these two year and more. No, she can't know much about me, or she'd have been up at our yard long afore this. Leastways, if she didn't, the parish would.\" \" Then she never will, you may depend upon that. So if you like to chance it, I will do my best for you.\" Sam scratched his head. \" I say, aunt, it ain't hanging matter, is it ? \" \" Hanging matter ! no.

Five hundred down, and five hun dred more in case we win the double event. Them's my terms.\" Mrs Ashford looked at him with consider able contempt. \" Then we can't deal,\" she said. \" And, indeed, I think I can do better without you.\" This apparent indifference on the part of the aunt inspired the nepheAv Avith more eager ness to take the bait than he had hitherto mani- i VOL.

She played her fish admirably, and at length the conditions between the two high contracting poAvers were settled according to the programme laid clown by the lady. It was further agreed that when the marriage should take place the happy family should keep house together. Having thus satisfactorily disposed of their hare, the next thing Avas to catch it ; and for this there Avas no time to be lost. It was essential that Susan should be married during her father's lifetime, to prevent the im pertinent interference of relations and guard ians. AVith this view*, Mr Penge Avas instructed to commence operations without delay."], [59, "51 CHAPTER III. Mr Samuel Penge was, as his aunt had fondly predicated of him, a good-looking young man, with a slender, active figure, and an amount of modest assurance that promised Avell for his success Avith the fair sex. He was not Avrong in supposing that he Avas no favourite with Susan, and having a shrewd suspicion that his free-and-easy Avay of addressing her Avas in a great measure the cause of this coldness on her part, he determined to try Avhat a \u25a0change of manner Avould effect. The difficulty Avas to find opportunities, for Susan never made her appearance in the evening, except when she Avas summoned into the parlour to bring fresh glasses or boiling Avater, Avhen her ears Avere generally greeted with Mr Penge's"], [60, "52 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Now, Susan, look sharp, we are all waiting,\" varied occasionally by some refined piece of jocularity, such as, \"Look alive, Susan, one wrould think you had a sAveetheart in the kitchen, you are so long a-coming.\" During the clay she was ahvays occupied Avith the child, Avhile his duties detained him in the stables. On the morning after the conversa tion with his aunt he absented himself from his yard without leave, and Avent on a Avild-goose chase after his intended in Kensington Gardens, but without success, and he got such a sharp reprimand from his master that he Avas not tempted to repeat the experiment. He con sulted his aunt, and by her advice made his appearance in the kitchen on the following evening. \" I am come to give you a hand, Miss,\" he said. \" It's a shame to see such a pretty girl doing all the work.\" But Miss Avas not so easily propitiated. She let him take the kettle, and followed with the glasses. As soon as she had set them down she prepared to depart, but Mrs Ashford stopped her."], [61, "53 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Sit doAvn, Susan,\" she said, \" and have a glass of something warm.\" \" Thank you, Mrs Ashford, I never drink spirits;\" and so saying she left the room, with out giving time for any reply. She Avent straight up-stairs to the nursery, which had also become her own room, and in Avhich, when the weather was very cold, she was indulged with a little bit of fire for baby's sake. Here she sat down to ponder over the unusual civil ities of which she had been the object. In the monotonous life she led, any event, how ever trifling, was matter for speculation, but this Avas one so extraordinary that it quite baffled her. The following morning it was partly ex plained, as she thought, by Mrs Ashford's telling her that her father Avished to see more of her. \" You see, Susan,\" she said, \" his spirits get worse and wTorse, of an evening especially, and it's beyond my poAver to rouse him. So you must see what you can do. As soon as baby's in bed you must come and join us. You ean bring your Avork, and you needn't drink"], [62, "54 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. nothink if you don't like, but it will make it more cheerful for him. Besides, you're getting a great girl noAV, and it's time you should see something of life.\" The life that Susan was likely to see in Mrs Ashford's parlour had no great attractions for her, but little as she owed to her father's care or affection, she felt that it was her duty to contribute to the best of her ability to the comfort of his declining years. He Avas the only link that seemed iioav to connect her with the Avorld, and though the protection he af forded her Avas merely nominal, she shuddered to think of Avhat her fate Avould be when de prived of it altogether. She knew nothing of the small provision to which she was entitled, and saw before her only a life of domestic servitude, happy if she could earn her bread by the most menial offices. She made no opposition to her step-mother's proposal, but joined the party doAvn-stairs the same evening, and Avas gratified to find that Mr Ashford recognized her presence by a nod and a vacant smile. The poor man had not much left to make life enjoyable. His potations were now"], [63, "55 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. reduced to one tumbler of the very weakest gin and Avater. Smoking was altogether prohibited. Mr Penge Avas not idle in availing himself of the opportunities afforded him for prosecut ing his suit, and ovenvlielmed Susan Avith his delicate attentions, but Avith no great amount of success. In vain he selected for her the most tempting bits of tripe and bullock's heart, the dishes of Mrs Ashford's especial predilec tion ; in vain he offered her sips from his own tumbler of grog ; Susan neither eat nor drank, nor did she seem to take much interest in the sporting anecdotes with Avhich he enlivened the supper-table. His overt acts Avere received Avith even less favour. Every attempt to take her hand or press her foot Avith his beneath the table was evaded, and at length Avere dis concerted altogether by her establishing herself in a chair by the fire-side, from which she never stirred, notAvithstanding Sam's sulky looks and his aunt's scowl. Although far from guessing at the full extent of the con spiracy, still less at its motives, she saw quite enough to put her on her guard."], [64, "56 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. One evening, Sam brought her an immense bunch of Avail-flowers ; and, laying them down on the table before her, said that he hoped she would accept them. She had no time to say yes or no, when Mrs Ashford exclaimed, \"What a beautiful nosegay ! I am sure Susan can't refuse you a kiss for such a present as that. AVhat do you say, A. ? \" Ashford gave an idiotic sort of laugh, Avhich Sam evidently interpreted as a sign of approbation, and, wiping his lips with the back of his hand, prepared to reap his reward, but Susan, starting up, flung the flowers on the fire. \" I want nothing from Mr Penge, neither flowers nor anything else,\" she said, as she left the room. As this Avas her first open act of rebellion, its novelty struck those most interested with surprise. Samuel looked sullen and crest fallen, and expressed his feelings in appropri ate language. Mrs Ashford, her face inflamed with grog and passion, muttered out, \"I'll bring down that proud stomach of hers before I've done with her, I warrant you.

He had fallen into a gentle doze. Before they separated for the night Mrs Ashford held a long consultation with her nephew, the result of which was a determina tion to adopt more stringent measures against the culprit. Accordingly, she entered the, nursery on the folloAving morning at an early hour, with an ominous frown on her broAv. \" Susan,\" she said, \" I am downright angry at your behaviour last night. Such rudeness and ingratitude I never heerd tell on. When my nephew took the trouble to bring you a nosegay, as the Queen on her throne might have been proud of, for to go and treat it in that Avay was enough to make the blood freeze in one's veins.

She had no lack of courage and firmness in her composition, although till the present oc casion those qualities had never been called out. During the last twelve hours she had had ample time for reflection. She felt intui tively that a crisis Avas at hand, though of what nature she could not divine ; and, knoAV ing that she must depend upon herself alone, she armed herself for the contest. Unfortun ately for her, the best support failed her. Since her mother's death her education in reli gion, as in everything else, had been entirely neglected. Mrs Ashford II. was no church goer. She \" detested them idle Avarmint as is ahvays coming, prying about and asking for their church-rates and Easter-dues ; \" and the voluntary system, by which the ministers of dissenting congregations are supported, Avas a still greater stumbling-block. Susan, it is true, always said the prayers Avhich her mother"], [67, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 59 had taught her, morning and evening, but without attaching much meaning to them, and solely because that mother had enjoined her so to do. For the same reason, she read a chap ter in the Bible every day Avhen she had time, but, without some one to explain its meaning, she might as well have read it in its original HebreAv and Greek. Of all the great doctrines and duties of Christianity she had about as much knoAvledge as a heathen. And in all matters connected Avith the outer Avorld her ignorance was as great. She had not the slightest idea how far her step-mother's authority might extend, or what protection the law Avould afford her in case of need. But she had a vague sort of notion that policemen Avere bound to assist all in distress, and that in some remote and undefined district a potentate, called the Lord Mayor, reigned in great pomp and splendour, avIio Avould perhaps listen to her appeal, should she be driven to extremities. But of her future fate she thought but little ; it could not well be worse than the position in which she now found herself. Her present difficulties fully engrossed all the powers of"], [68, "60 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. her mind, and she determined to fly from her father's house, should no other way present itself of freeing herself from the persecutions of Mr Samuel Penge. It Avas therefore with an air almost of de fiance, very different from her usual subdued manner, that she ansAvered Mrs Ashford. \" I should have thought, ma'am, that it was Mr Penge's business to apologize to me for the insult he Avas preparing to offer me.\" \" Insult, indeed ! I should like to know Avhat insult there is in a young man kissing a young woman in the presence of her father and mother, and Avith their permission. But these fine lady airs won't go down Avith me, I can tell you ; so it's no good trying them on. A. and me think Sam will make you a good hus band, and so I expect you'll receive him as such.\" \" I will sooner throw myself out of this window,\" said Susan Avith quiet determination, and without any apparent excitement. \" AVell, I never ! Things are come to a pretty pass !\" exclaimed Mrs Ashford, in great wrath, and not a little perplexed as to what"], [69, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 61 her next move should be. \" But I tell you Avhat it is, Miss,\" she continued, after a short pause, \" when your father goes \u2014 and that may happen any day; \" here she fumbled with her handkerchief,and Aviped an imaginary tear from her eye ; \" whensoever that happens, out you go from this house, as sure as your name's Susan, for whatsoever he has got to leave he has left to me, and you have no claim on me. I'll keep no idle, good-for-nothing, ungrateful vixens in my house, I can tell you. So you had better take a good husband Avhile you can get him.\" Susan made no answer. She had sat doAvn and taken up a piece of work with which she Avas occupied. \" Give me none of your sulks,\" cried Mrs Ashford, \" for I won't stand it. I'll slap your face for you, I will.\" But Susan's temper was fully roused. In self-defence she took up the scissors. \" If you strike me, Mrs Ashford, it will be the Avorse for you,\" she said. There Avas a dangerous look in her eyes, which made her step-mother turn pale. She"], [70, "62 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. felt that one bloAv might repay years of op pression, and with due regard for her own safety, not only refrained from the threatened aggression, but retreated from the room with considerable expedition, muttering her favour ite phrase, \" Well, I never ! \" and slamming the door after her Avith a violence that Avoke the child, and set it screaming. When she found herself alone, Susan felt neither repentance for the unfeminine threat which she had used, nor fear for its conse quences, although quite aware that the contest would, before long, be renewed in a manner which Avould probably end by leaving her at the mercy of her adversary. But this seemed to give her no uneasiness. That adversary she felt she had for the time cowed, and she triumphed in the thought. The bitter train ing she had gone through for the last feAV years had hardened her nature, and perverted a dis position, violent indeed, but full of good quali ties. Naturally affectionate, her heart Avas now filled with hatred ; guided by a word as long as her mother lived, she now breathed nothing but rebellion and the most vindictive"], [71, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 63 feelings. The milk of human kindness was turned to gall, and even the power of shedding tears seemed dried up Avithin her. Hitherto she had borne every act of oppression without a murmur or word of complaint. She would not give Mrs Ashford the satisfaction of know- ing hoAv deeply her feelings were wounded, by being placed in a position from which a beggar would have recoiled. She, the daughter of Mary Baines, the grand-daughter of a digni- tary of the Church, could not but feel deeply hurt, when she found herself reduced to the condition of Sarah Penge's servant. And yet it did not lower her in her self-esteem. She kneAv that it Avas through no fault of hers that she had fallen so Ioav in the social scale ; and hope, which nothing can entirely extinguish in the human breast, Avhispered to her that it could not last for ever, that better times Avould come if she were but true to herself. But to marry Samuel Penge the groom, the nephew of the woman who, by practising on her father's vices, had succeeded in usurping her mother's place, Avas a depth of degradation from which she could never recover, a degradation which"], [72, "64 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. would sink her irretrievably in the Avorld's opinion and her own, and to which nothing should induce her to submit. Of Avhat na ture the next attempt to overcome her resist ance Avould be, Iioav or Avhen it Avould be made, she kneAV not, and indeed did not much care. That it should be equally unsuccessful with the last she Avas fully determined, even should it cost her her life ; and Avith rare self possession she dismissed that part of the sub ject from her mind, and resumed her usual occupations. But the intense dislike and de sire of revenge which for years had been sloAA'ly accumulating in her breast against Mrs Ashford reached its height. Like some beast of the chase brought to bay by its pursuers, she thought of nothing but hoAv to inflict upon her enemies the greatest possible amount of injury, before she fell herself. In the mean time, Mrs Ashford, furious at her failure, and still more so at the frip-ht she had undergone, hastened to hold a consultation with Mr Penge, aa*1io happened to be in the house at the time. For Sam had been obliged temporarily to give up his situation at the"], [73, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 65 horse-dealer's. A Sussex farmer, with more money in his pocket than sense in his brains, having lost all his ready cash and a silver hunting-watch to boot at a skittle ground, to Mr Penge and two of his friends, took it into his head that he had not been fairly dealt with, and, making known his suspicions at a police office, obtained a warrant for their apprehen sion. His two associates were taken, but Penge himself contrived to escape. Fearful, however, of his place of employment being known, he discharged himself from the horse dealer, and was now in a very attenuated sense leading the life of a man of wit and pleasure about town. Fortunately for him, he had never disclosed the secret of his connection with Mrs Ashford to his felloAv servants, from a sort of false shame at not being able to make them free of her hospitable mansion, so that Avhen he sought a refuge beneath her roof, he left no trace of his whereabouts. She could not give him a bed, but he passed the greatest part of the day and took his meals at his aunt's. Mrs Ashford told her nepheAV the tale of VOL. I. 5"], [74, "66 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. her discomfiture ; but as she proceeded in her narration her passion almost overpowered her, and Sam had some little difficulty in making out what had passed. A copious discharge of threats and maledictions somewhat relieved her. \" And now, Sam,\" she said, in conclusion, \" when you get hold of her, if you don't break the owdacious heart of her, I'll never forgive you.\" Disappointed in her expectation of gain, braved and threatened by one whom she had hitherto looked upon as a mere child, and treated as a servant, no amount of punishment seemed to her sufficient to wipe out the hu miliation she had received. She stamped her foot in impotent rage, and asked Sam what they were to do now. Sam scratched his head. \" Once let me get her in harness, and I'll soon cure her of these tricks.\" \" Yes, you fool, but how will you get her in harness, as you call it ? You won't find it so easy a matter as you think for. A good thousand out of both our pockets, and she"], [75, "SIR HUBERT MARST0N. 67 lording it like a queen over us ! It's enough to drive one mad to think of it. And there's no time to be lost. A. is very shaky, I can tell you. \" Penge had quite as many reasons as his aunt \"to wish for a speedy and satisfactory solution. He was quite aware of Mr Ashford's precari ous state. A thousand pounds would make a man of him. It would, in the first place, enable him to make all square with his skittle victim, and in the next place it would enable him to gratify the height of his ambition, and start as a dealer in horseflesh on his own ac count. And in addition to this there was another motive. In the course of the last few weeks he had conceived for Susan a passion, which in animals of that description passes for love. To gratify this, and at the same time to exact ample retribution for the scorn and contumely with which she had treated him, was the dearest wish of his heart. In imagina tion he saw her sewing buttons on his shirts* cooking his steaks, fetching his beer from the public-house, and receiving, in all humility, a kick or a blow for any neglect of domestic duty."], [76, "68 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. In many particulars there was a great re semblance between the aunt and nephew, and in none more than the clogged pertinacity with which they adhered to designs once formed. Neither was troubled with many scruples as to the means by which their ends were to be attained, but with this difference \u2014 Mrs Ash ford, who, with all her blustering, was at heart a coward, preferred the by-paths of cunning and deceit ; Samuel, on the other hand, who had the courage and ferocity of a bull-dog, was all for carrying his point by violence and the strong hand. Under the influence of this feeling, he exclaimed, as a sort of response to his aunt's observations, \"Ah, if we could but get her down into the country for a day, I would soon have her in a place where she would never be heard of till she came out as my wife. There's one or two of my pals as wouldn't ask for a better lark than to help me in carrying her off.\" \" If that's all you have to say, you may just shut up at once. There's no likelihood of getting her into the country.\""], [77, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 69 \" Well, I don't say but it might be done here, if so be we could get her out at night. Only it will be a deal more risky, and the chaps will expect to be paid heavy in proportion, as is but right.\" \" It won't do, Sam. You will only be get ting yourself into trouble. But I'll turn it over in my mind, only just now I'm in such a flustration that I cannot think of anything rightly. Howsomever, the first thing to be done is to smooth her down a bit. I shall just tell her that you are very sorry to find she won't have nothing to say to you, but, as that is the case, that you give it up as a bad job, and will leave her quiet.\" \" Very well, aunt. Just pitch it in strong, though, and tell her how she's been and cut me to the heart, but sooner than vex her, I give it up, and I hope as how we shall always be friends, seeing we are relations like.\" In pursuance of this policy, Mrs Ashford, in the course of the afternoon, again presented herself in the nursery, and addressing Susan, as if she had lost all recollection of the way in"], [78, "70 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. which their previous interview had terminated, told her that she had communicated her de cision to Samuel. \" Of course, poor fellow,\" she said, \" he was very much cut up ; but he says he will never worrit you any more about it, and hopes you'll forget it, and meet him as usual when he drops in of an evening. He hopes it won't be the means of keeping you out of the par lour. If he thought so, he would stay away altogether.\" \" Mr Penge's absence or presence is nothing to me,\" was Susan's reply. Mrs Ashford bit her lips, but contrived, though with some difficulty, to refrain from giving utterance to her anger. \" Then, I suppose,\" she said in what she flattered herself was a conciliatory tone, \" you will pass your evenings down-stairs as usual, as your poor father seems to like it so much.\" Susan was strongly tempted to say, No ; for the evenings down-stairs were productive of anything but pleasure to her, and as for her presence contributing to her father's happiness,"], [79, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 71 he hardly seemed to know whether she was there or not. But she would not yield a step to the enemy. She fancied that Mrs Ash ford's altered tone was entirely owing to the determination she had shown in the morning, and she resolved not to lose the advantage she had gained. Without looking up from her work, she replied quietly, \" Of course I shall come down in the even ing. There is nothing that I know of to pre vent it.\" \" You'll do nothing with her by fair means,\" was Mrs Ashford's observation to her nephew, when she rejoined him down-stairs. \" Then we must try something else, for I swear that somehow or another I will get hold of her. I didn't care much about it yester day, but I'm not going to be treated in this way by that young devil, who thinks of me no more than the dirt under her feet. She will be glad enough to be my wife before I have clone with her, and then I'll take the nonsense out of her \u25a0 see if I don't. His thoughts always ran upon abduction, but not being blessed with a fertile imagina-"], [80, "72 SIR HUBERT MARST0N. tion, and the difficulties of such an enterprise being somewhat greater in London than in Connaught or Munster, he was never able to form any satisfactory plan. Nor would his aunt assist him. In the mean time Susan followed the routine of her daily life, taking her place regularly in the evening by the side of Mr Ashford, who passed his life in nodding over the fire in a state of imbecility. She could not feel, nor did she profess, affection for the father who had embittered her mother's life, perhaps caused her death ; who had been the occasion of her brother's exile, of her own degradation. Still she felt that the mere fact of his presence was some sort of protection, and as long as he lived she thought herself safe from the machinations of his wife. Once seated, she never raised her eyes from her work, and, but for an occasional Yes or No to any question directly addressed to her, she seemed to be be reft of the power of speech. Mrs Ashford and her nephew felt themselves completely baffled, and their good-will to the young girl was not increased by the discovery. Once Sam hit"], [81, "73 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. upon what he conceived to be a masterpiece of strategy. He told Susan that two tickets for the play had been given him, and presented her with one, offering himself as her escort. Susan had never been inside a theatre but once in her mother's lifetime, she had not even witnessed the dramatic performances of Punch half a dozen times in her life, and he natur ally concluded that the temptation would be irresistible. What his ulterior projects may have been is uncertain. Probably he had not decided upon them himself. Mrs Ashford urged Susan's acceptance, and with unwonted good nature offered to take charge of the baby herself for that evening, and even to smarten her up with sundry articles of toilette from her own wardrobe, but it was all in vain. Susan steadily refused. She had never been out at night, and she had no wish to begin now. The conspirators were in despair."], [82, "74 CHAPTER IV. At length an event occurred which brought matters to a crisis. Mr Ashford had a stroke of paralysis, and though he did not sink under it at once, and even seemed at times to be re stored to a little more intellectual power than he had manifested for some time past, the medical man who had been called in warned Mrs Ashford that, in all probability, her hus band would have another attack before many days were over, which would be fatal. This intelligence she communicated to Susan, who, now that the end was so near at hand, could not hear the mournful tidings without emo tion. Taking advantage of this, Mrs Ashford proceeded, \" I have thought it right to tell you this"], [83, "75 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. in time, that you may form some plan for yourself. You can remain here till after the funeral, but then you must look out for your self. I cannot rob my child for you.\" Whatever she may have felt at these cruel words, Susan repressed all outward sign of agitation. Her only reply was, \" Very well, ma'am, I will think of it.\" \" Then you had better lose no time about it,\" said Mrs Ashford, viciously. \" Do not be afraid, ma'am, of my being any encumbrance upon you, I have no greater wish to remain here than you have to keep me. I shall endeavour to find a situation.\" Mrs Ashford was a little startled. \" What a foolish, obstinate girl you are, Susan. Situations are not so easily found, I can tell you. The best situation for you is to marry Sam, who's over head and ears in love with you ; more fool he, say I ; and is ready to take you, for all that is come and gone. A fine, likely young fellow, who will keep you in comfort, with a good house over your head. You may wait long enough before you get"], [84, "76 SIR HUBERT MARST0N. such another offer. For the last time, will you have him ? \" \" No, Mrs Ashford, I will not.\" \" Then you must take the consequences,\" said that good lady, flinging out of the room in high dudgeon. Another long and mysterious conference took place that afternoon between Mrs Ash ford and her nephew, at which it appears some definite course of action was resolved upon. Her last words to him, as he rose to depart, were, \" I'll do all I can, and then you must help yourself. There's the money for the license.\" \" All right, aunt, never fear me. We'll have the wedding to-morrow,\" he replied, with an intelligent nod, and pocketing the money, he left the room and the house. Having made some trifling purchase at a chemist's, he proceeded to Doctors' Com mons, where, after making oath that the mar riage was to be solemnized with the cognizance and approbation of the young lady's father, he took out a license for the marriage of Samuel Penge, bachelor, and Susan Ashford, spinster."], [85, "SIR HUBERT MARST0N. 77 Putting the precious document into his pocket, he retraced his steps to Bayswater, and arrived in time to join Mrs Ashford in discussing the merits of a roast leg of pork, with apple-sauce. Susan was in her father's room, for the invalid could not be left alone. What were her thoughts as she thus kept watch by the bed of the father whose days were numbered, it would be difficult to say, for they crowded in such variety and confusion on her brain that she found it impossible to disentangle them, or reduce them to order. At one moment a feeling of deep pity would arise for the helpless sufferer, so^ soon to be called to an account for the use, or abuse, he had made of the talent intrusted to him. But there was in this none of the affection of a child for a parent. That had been quenched long ago. It was only the innate commisera tion of her woman's heart for one lying on the bed of illness, from which he was never again to rise. Then her present position would flash across her mind, contrasted with what it might have been, had her father but acted a father's part. She thought of the mother she"], [86, "78 SIR HUBERT MARST0N. had lost, recalling the most minute circum stances of her childhood with the accuracy of a memory on which few pleasant reminiscences were engraved. Then again she thought of the brother she had so clearly loved, now apparently dead to her for ever by the silence of neglect, or what was scarcely more painful to bear, the silence of the grave. For the first time she fully realized the utter isolation into which she would in all probability be so soon cast. She almost regretted having so constantly re jected the advances made to her on her daily walks with the child by the girls she fell in with, engaged in a similar occupation. Her pride would never allow her to consider herself as one of their class, although not one of them would have changed places with her; but now she recollected, that perhaps through the good offices of someone amongst them she might have found the means of earning her bread. This feeling, however, was not of long duration. She had immense self-reliance, united to com plete ignorance of the difficulties with which she would have to contend. The parks and"], [87, "79 SIR HUBERT MABSTON. gardens were filled with girls of her own age, evidently in the employment of respectable families ; what was to prevent her from finding a place as good as theirs ? She found herself at times almost wishing that the time were come when she would be thrown upon her own resources. At least she would be inde pendent. And this brought back to her mind the step-mother, whose hardness and tyranny had made her what she was, and whom every day she hated with a more perfect hatred, extending to all connected with her. She was almost indignant with herself for the love she felt for her little sister, when she reflected who was its mother. While occupied with this chaos of thought, she heard the house-door shut, and in a minute Mrs Ashford made her appearance. \" Sam has gone home,\" she said, \" and you can go up-stairs to the baby, Susan. I mean to sit up with A. to-night, but before you go to bed, come down to see if any thing is wanted, and bring the child with you. I shall feel lonely and timoursome all by myself, and baby"], [88, "80 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. is better than nobody. And Susan, before you go up bring in the tea-things.\" Susan obeyed in silence, and about ten o'clock returned with the child. \" Wait here a few minutes, Susan,\" said Mrs Ashford, \" while I go and make myself comfortable. I have kept a nice cup of tea for you and a bit of toast. I dare say you won't be the worse for them before you go to bed.\" A cold \"Thank you, Ma'am,\" was Susan's only reply to this gracious attention; and while she proceeded to lay the child on a small mat tress that had been arranged for it, Mrs Ashford, after giving a hasty glance at her husband, who was lying motionless and apparently asleep, left the room. Susan then sat clown by the fire and began her supper, but she was not hungry, and had little inclination to eat. She felt feverish, how ever; and taking up the cup, drank off a considerable portion of its contents, when she Avas startled by a harsh and inarticulate cry from the bed, and turning her head, was hor rified by seeing her father sitting up, and"], [89, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 81 making the most frantic gesticulations and attempts to speak. Supposing him to be seized with another fit, she flew to the bed-side, and endeavoured to lay his head on the pillow. He was a frightful object to look at, paler than the sheet on which he was lying, with his few grizzly locks hanging down over his face, look ing more like a spectre than a living man. He resisted all his daughter's attempts to compose him, and continued to utter a hoarse sound, which he in vain attempted to reduce into words. Susan saw that there was some thing he wished to communicate to her. She said to him, in a very low and distinct tone of voice, \"Father, you have got something to tell me ; lie down and try to whisper it to me. It will perhaps be easier to you. Do you under stand me?\" He made a gesture of assent, and allowed her to replace him in the bed. Then kneeling down with her ear close to his lips, she asked him what it was he wished to say. For a minute or more, which to Susan, fearful of her .step-mother's return, appeared an age, all his VOL. I. 6"], [90, "82 SIR HUBERT MARST0N. efforts were in vain. At last he contrived to murmur out in tones sufficiently distinct for his daughter to catch, \" Tea \u2014 don't.\" In a moment she understood his meaning, while a horrid suspicion and feeling of terror crossed her mind. She started up, but by a great effort resumed her self-possession. \" You wish me not to drink the tea, Papa,\" she said, the first time she had so addressed him for many a day. Again he made the same sign of assent, but more vehemently than before. \" Thank you, Papa. May God bless you.\" And kissing his forehead, she returned to the table. She carefully examined the cup. Nearly half of its contents were gone ; and she now noticed a peculiar smell in it, and fancied there was a peculiar taste on her palate, which she had not remarked before. Hastily she flung the remainder of the tea amongst the ashes under the grate, carefully rinsed out the cup, and filled it up again from the teapot. Then holding it to her lips, she turned to her father, who gave no sign of disapprobation. The fresh tea was free from all noxious smell or taste. She drank a little to calm her agitation,"], [91, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 83 if possible, and then fell into deep thought. That her father had seen Mrs Ashford put poison into her cup she thought clear, that he had done his best to save her was equally so. Had he succeeded ? Had she taken enough to kill her, before his warning cry struck her ear ? Falling on her knees, she implored the mercy of God, in case it should be His will that she should die, with an earnestness of supplication as sincere as it was new to her. With death, and such a death, before her eyes, for the first time she seemed to recognize how weak, how powerless she was to assist herself without the aid and support of an omnipotent arm. But with these feelings there was also another. If she were condemned to die, she would not die unrevenged. Taking a piece of writing paper she scrawled on it, \" I die poisoned,\" and pinned it within her gown. At this moment she heard steps upon the stairs. Mrs Ashford entered in her toilette de mat, which, being adapted rather for comfort than elegance, and not remarkable for its cleanliness, made her anything but an attractive object. \" Well, Susan,\" were her first words, \" I"], [92, "84 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. have been so long, I was almost afraid I should find you asleep. How is your poor father now r \" Quite quiet, ma'am, now ; though he was a little restless a short time ago.\" \"Ah, well, poor man, we must expect it now and then, the doctor says. But you have eaten nothing. Did not you like your tea ? \" \" Yes, ma'am, thank you. It was very good, indeed,\" Susan replied, with very pardonable hypocrisy ; \" but I was not hungry.\" \" Well, finish your tea,\" said Mrs Ashford, looking at it, \" and then go up to bed. You need not come in here in the morning till I ring or call.\" Susan said nothing, but drank the tea re maining in the cup, lit the small candle-end allowed her, and withdrew. She could not bring herself to say \" Good night ; \" but that excited no surprise ; it was set down to sulki ness. As soon as she reached her own room, she locked the door, and began to reflect seri ously on what was the next step to be taken. She felt convinced that her life was no longer safe under that roof, though it still seemed"], [93, "85 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. incomprehensible to her that her step-mother should incur such a risk without any adequate motive. Still there is no disputing about tastes, and she took it into her head, not with out some show of reason, that Mrs Ashford's ran in the direction of the occult science of poisoning ; though in setting down that good *ady as a murderess, she did her great injust ice. Mrs Ashford held all unprofitable crime in great contempt. Susan, however, remained impressed with the idea that she was intended to be the victim of the hatred which had never been concealed, and which she was conscious her rejection of Samuel Penge had raised to the highest pitch. To avoid the fate prepared for her, she determined to fly from her father's house as soon as it was light, and immediately set about her preparations. She made a bun dle of her scanty wardrobe, and the few articles she could call her own, and then sat down on a chair to watch for the first break of day. Her candle soon burnt itself out, and a feel ing of drowsiness came over her which she found it very difficult to resist. She tried to overcome it by walking about the room,"], [94, "86 SIR HUBERT MARST0N. creeping about in the dark, and moving with stealthy steps for fear of being overheard. But nothing would do. An intense desire to lie down for a short time came over her, and trusting to her habits of early rising for wak ing in time, she threw herself upon her bed, and almost before her head touched the pillow was fast asleep. In this state she may have remained for little more than an hour, when she was startled from an uneasy dream by a noise in the room. The staple of the lock, the screws of which had been loosened, fell on to the floor, the door was pushed open, and a heavy step was heard making its way towards the bed. In inexpressible terror, and with her thoughts still in confusion, Susan jumped up and ex claimed, \"Who's there?\" But the only re sponse, in a voice she recognized only too well, was a muttered \" Damnation ! she's awake,\" while a powerful arm encircled her waist, and a large hand covered her mouth. In vain she endeavoured to release herself. In vain she attempted to utter a cry. After a short strug gle, partly from fright and exhaustion, partly"], [95, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 87 from the effects of the narcotic she had swal lowed, she lost all consciousness, and remained completely in the power of the ruffian who held her. But at that moment a succession of violent knocks was heard at the front door, which shook the house, and Samuel Penge, still hold ing Susan in his arms, approached the win dow, and saw two policemen on the steps. He heard the window below open, and his aunt ask what was the matter. \" Open the door, ma'am. You've thieves in the house,\" was the answer. Hardly knowing what she did, Mrs Ashford lit a candle, and went down-stairs j but before doing so, called in a loud whisper to her nephew to come down, and wait in Mr Ash ford's room till she had got rid of her trouble some visitors. Throwing Susan from him, with a muttered imprecation, Samuel obeyed. Mrs Ashford then opened the house door. \" Well, perliceman, what is it? \" she said. \" Sorry to disturb you, ma'am, but me and 1004 have been watching a man for the last half-hour, who has been hanging about your"], [96, "88 SIR HUBERT MARST0N. house ever since the lights was out. When he saw all quiet, after looking about him for a bit, he went up to your door, put his ear to the key-hole, and then let himself in, either with a false key or one you have lost ; so if you please, ma'am, we'll just search the house.\" \" You must be mistaken. There is nobody in the house but my husband, who is danger ously ill, and my nephew, who is staying with us. It must be in one of the houses next door. Had not you better try them ? \" \" No mistake, ma'am. We saw him enter this house plain enough.\" Mrs Ashford was afraid of exciting suspicion by any further opposition, so she told them they were welcome to search. She went back to her husband's room, 1004 remaining at the foot of the stairs, while his comrade began his investigations by the upper floor. In the mean time a whispered recrimination went on be tween the nephew and aunt, he reproaching her for having mentioned his being in the house instead of concealing him ; \" for if the gal knew me, and peaches, it is all U P.\""], [97, "89 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. And she, reviling him for not having walked straight up to the door, and opening it boldly, like a man entering his own house, instead of exciting suspicion by lurking about. In about ten minutes the policeman came into the room. \" Well, ma'am,\" he said, \" I suppose the bird is flown by the trap-door in the roof ; but there has been some mischief a-going on. There was the servant girl a-lying on the floor in a faint. I put her on the bed, and you had better go and look after her, and see if you can bring her to. You must bring her to the office to-morrow. I suppose the gen tleman in bed is your husband. I hope we have not disturbed him. And that other young man is your nephew, is he ? \" Sam, who was dressed in the classical cos tume of the stable, seemed rather out of place in the bed-room of an invalid. Nevertheless, he was standing by the side of the sick man, and was occupied in shaking up his pillow and arranging his bed, carefully keeping his features in the dark. Ashford himself was utterly unconscious of what was going on."], [98, "90 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \"Yes,\" said the lady addressed, \"that is my nephew, Sam Penge.\" A warning look from Mr Penge came too late. \"All right, ma'am,\" said Sergeant Wick ham, going to the door. \" Martin, just step up here.\" One thousand and four made his appear- ance. \" Martin, there's no thief in the house now. But I understand all about it, except the young woman's faint up-stairs. Samuel Penge,\" con tinued he, going up to that gentleman, \" you are my prisoner. I have had a warrant against you these ten days. Take charge of him, Mar tin, and carry him off to the station.\" Mr Penge tried to show fight, but was soon overpowered ; policeman Martin slipping the handcuffs on him with an adroitness, that showed considerable experience in that par ticular branch of his profession. \"You see, Martin,\" continued the other, \" Mr Penge is the nephew of this good lady, and no doubt has been playing hide and seek in her house. So when he comes home to night a little after hours, he looks about him"], [99, "91 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. to see all safe before he ventures in, and that's the very way by which he gets nabbed.\" \" But what is it for ?\" sobbed out Mrs Ash ford. \" Won't you take bail ? \" \" Oh, it's no great matter, ma'am. Skittle sharping, that's all. I can't take bail, but I dare say the magistrate will to-morrow, \u2014 good housekeeper's bail.\" At this moment the house-door was opened and shut. \" Hallo, what's that ? \" said the sergeant, rushing to the window. \" A woman leaving the house ! I'll follow her \u2022 take away your prisoner, Martin.\" And without any more ceremonious leave taking he ran down-stairs, three at a time, and Avas out of the house in a moment. While these matters were being discussed down-stairs, Susan had gradually recovered consciousness.

It Avas just after Martin had been summoned from his post of observation. Seeing no one, and hearing no thing, without a moment's thought, she slipped noiselessly down-stairs, opened the house-door, and, without knoAving Avhere she was going, fled up the street. But she had not gone far, when she heard the sound of footsteps, as if in pursuit, and fast gaining on her.

In a small house at Kensington, quite a gem in its Avay, to use the language of auctioneers, Mr John Digby was sitting over the fire in his dining-room, sipping his Avine with very evident satisfaction and complacency, while his pretty young wife was seated opposite to him, daintfly peeling Avalnuts for his consump tion, regardless of the stains she inflicted on her own taper fingers. It is needless to add that they had not been very long married. John Digby, although only the junior mem ber of the Avell-knoAvn firm of Digby, Cramp, and Digby, Solicitors and Attorneys, of No. 5, Capias Court, Lincoln's Inn, was a man of very good family, and, what Avas still better, had received an excellent education. Perhaps"], [102, "94 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. with a vieAV to his forming valuable acquaint ances, and thereby increasing the clientele of his house, old Mr Digby had sent his only son to Eton and Oxford ; but if this was his calculation, he Avas very near defeating his own object. The tastes Avhich John Digby ac quired in those aristocratic seminaries of learn ing were not precisely such as qualified him to appreciate as it deserved the dry practice of the laAV in an attorney's office ; and when informed of the destiny that awaited him, John rebelled. He would be a soldier, a sailor, a civil en gineer, a surgeon,\" anything, in short, rather than a laAvyer. But Mr Digby was equally firm. Though he had only one son, he had a quiver full of female arrows ; in plain English, he had five daughters : and as his intention was to divide the greater part of his accumulations between them.he had no idea of alloAving the ex cellentbusinessAvhichhehadhimself created, and which was the best inheritance he could leave his son, to pass out of the family. All this he represented to John, and John showed himself quite as reasonable as could fairly be expected. As the only male scion of the family he had"], [103, "95 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. naturally been petted and spoiled by his sisters, whom he bullied and loved. He was not selfish, and he quite agreed with his father that their fortunes ought not to be diminished on his account, and that he must adopt some profession by which he could live without coming upon them. The only difference of opinion was as to what that profession should be. At length a compromise was effected. John gave up all thoughts of army and navy, and received permission to travel abroad for a year, during which he was to make up his mind. \"If you come into the office,\" said his father, \" I will take you as junior partner after a pro bation of two years. If not, you must be con tent with your present allowance of five hun dred a-year from me for the rest of your life. Do not take a resolution without thinking the matter well over.\" John Digby thanked his father warmly, and assured him it was quite as much as he ex pected. He departed from England Avith the full conviction that five hundred a-year was more than he could ever by any possibility re-"], [104, "96 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. quire, and looked fonvard to a life of roving independence. But a change came o'er the spirit of his dream, Avhen, during a tour of some Aveeks in SAvitzerland and the Tyrol, in company with Mr Baines and his daughter Lucy, whose acquaintance he had made on board a Rhine steamer, he found himself fall- ing in love with the young lady. The attrac- tion appeared to be mutual, and certainly was not founded on contrasts. They were both good-looking, in fact the lady Avas remarkably pretty ; they were both good-humoured, and, as far as the hypocrisy of lovers Avill alloAV one to decide, they had both the same tastes in literature, in music, in painting, in sculpture, and especially in a detestation of the law. The declaration was made and accepted as they were watching the rising of the moon at Chamouni, and Mr Baines gave a consent conditional upon Mr Digby's approval. But as he was a practical man, and had but a small portion to give his daughter, he insisted upon her lover's accepting his father's proposal, and entering the office. \"Till you have the means of maintainine"], [105, "97 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. my daughter in comfort I Avill not allow her to marry. And in no case would I hear of it till she is eighteen, that is to say, in two years.\" \" Two years ! \" exclaimed John Digby, in despair ; and if Lucy's lips did not repeat the words, her looks gave evident signs of sym pathy. But Mr Baines was inexorable. John Digby was obliged to promise compliance ; returned to England, and had no difficulty in obtaining his father's consent to a marriage which was in every way unexceptionable, and was apparently the means appointed for secur ing a compliance with the old gentleman's wishes. Mr Baines and his daughter also settled in London after their return from the continent, and an intimacy ensued between the two families equally satisfactory to both. John, having once entered the legal profession, de- Aroted to it all his abilities and attention, and at the end of two years received the reward of his zeal by being admitted into partnership with his father. But various circumstances had caused a postponement of his marriage, VOL. I. 7"], [106, "98 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. which had only taken place a few months pre vious to the time at Avhich the reader has the pleasure of making his acquaintance. \"That will do, Lucy,\" said her lord and master, filling up the glasses into Avhich he had put the kernels with wine ; \" that will do, and now come round and help me to dispose of them. This arm-chair will hold us both, and the labourer is Avorthy of her hire.\" Lucy complied, and by dint of some little squeezing \u2014 crinolines not being as yet in vogue \u2014 contrived to make herself tolerably comfortable. \" Well, I must say there are many worse berths than this,\" continued her husband. *\" There are only tAvo things I regret, \u2014 one is that we lost so much time in getting into it. Years of happiness lost to us and our heirs for ever.\" \" Best as it is, John,\" said Lucy. \" You Avould have been tired of me by this time.\" \" Don't tell fibs.\" \" No, I am quite serious. I do not believe that any girl of sixteen is a fit companion for a clever, well-informed man \u2022 at least I am sure"], [107, "99 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. I was not. I have tried hard since then to make up for my deficiencies, so you must not be too severe upon me, dearest, Avhen you find them out.\" Of course John did not alloAv this little piece of self-abasement to pass unre- Avarded, which stopped her eloquence for a moment, after which she resumed, \" But what is the second thing you regret?\" \"That dear old Marston is not here to witness my happiness.\" \" After all you have told me, do you think it would give him much pleasure to Avitness ihe happiness of others ? \" \" Of others, I Avill say nothing ; but mine, yes. You do not know what Ave are to each other.\" \" I shall be jealous of him, if you say much more,\" replied Lucy, Avith the least little bit of a pout. \" I am sure I hope not. But I Avish I could hear of his arrival. He is some Aveeks over due, to use post-office phraseology.\" A discreet knock was heard at the door of the room. \" Come in,\" said Digby, Avhile Lucy in vain endeavoured to extricate herself"], [108, "100 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. from the arm-chair. \" Sit still, dear, it is only Anne.\" \" If you please, sir,\" said Anne, making heT appearance, \"here is a gentleman, who will not give his name, and wants to see you.\" \" Tell him I see nobody who will not give his name, and that if it is on business he must come to the office to-morrow. I see no one on business in my private residence.\" \" You will see me, I think,\" said a tall figure, who appeared behind Anne, with a sun-burnt face, and a long beard, rather an unusual appendage in England at that time. \"My God, Hubert!\" exclaimed Digby, making in his turn attempts to rise, and with equally bad success. \" Where on earth do you spring from ? It's all right, Anne ;\" and he sank exhausted Avith his efforts into his chair, Avhile Lucy mechanically covered her face with her hands. The apparition could not help laughing, as he approached and took Digby's hand. \"Keep quiet,\" he said; \" you cannot be better situated for presenting me to Mrs Digby.\""], [109, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 101 \" My dearest love, this is Sir Hubert Mar ston.\" By this time Lucy had got clear, and took the hand Marston offered her, blushing deeply as she did so. \" I must trust to your good nature, Mrs Digby,\" he said, \" to excuse my intrusion at such an hour, but I was anxious to see and congratulate my old friend.\" Lucy said all that Avas proper, and added, *' Your name Avas on his lips when you Avere announced.\" She moved towards the door as she spoke, that she might be no restraint upon the tAvo friends, but Marston stopped her. \"No, Mrs Digby, I cannot alloAv that. If you attempt to leave the room I shall take the hint, and go at once. We have no secrets to discuss, and besides I Avant to make your acquaintance, for I hope in time to deserve and obtain your friendship.\" Sir Hubert Marston had begun life as a younger brother, with a younger brother's for tune. At Eton he had formed a juvenile at tachment for Digby, Avhich succeeding years had ripened into warm friendship, and Avhich"], [110, "102 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. the difference of their subsequent careers could not diminish. While his friend went to Oxford, he obtained a commission in the Guards, and dashed Avildly into all the pleasures and attrac tions of a London life. Also, he fell in love Avith Miss Caroline Wood, the daughter of a country neighbour ; and being both of them nearly penniless, as a matter of course they Avere speedily engaged. Unfortunately, or fortunately, he was ordered with his regiment to Canada, and during his absence, his eldest brother, Sir Charles Marston, contrived to per suade his faithless betrothed, that it Avould conduce much more to her Avell-being and comfort to accept the hand of a baronet, with a large rent-roll, than that of the said baronet's younger brother, Avith little more than his pay. Miss Caroline, under the dictation of her mother, wrote a long and exculpatory letter to her absent lover, breaking off the engagement, but protesting that it was chiefly regard for his interests and welfare that induced her to take a step so painful to her feelino-s. Her parents were entirely opposed to their union ; and nothing would induce her to marry with-"], [111, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 103 out their consent, which it was hopeless to ex pect. Under the circumstances, therefore, her duty to them, and even her affection for her beloved Hubert, compelled her to the sacrifice of her dearest hopes, though no words could express Avhat that sacrifice cost her. In the course of time, she hoped that they should meet as friends, etc., etc. Altogether, it was a very proper and sensi ble letter, explicit enough, but with a strain of tender regret running through it, which was in tended as a sort of balm to her lover's wounded feelings. And in fact, had it not been followed so closely by the announcement of her accept ance of Sir Charles's proposals, not a word could have been said against her. Her en gagement to Hubert Marston was an act of folly, the fulfilment of Avhich must have inevitably en tailed misery on them both. It was the having apparently secured a second string to her boAv before she discarded the first, that stamped her conduct with such a heartless and merce nary character. And, in truth, the step she was persuaded to take cost her much ; not quite as much, perhaps, as she wished Hubert"], [112, "104 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. to believe ; but, without feeling any very deep attachment for him, she certainly loved him as well as, probably better than, she loved any body else. It Avas not till every sort of home influence had been brought to bear upon her, that she consented to listen to Sir Charles Marston's suit. The effect upon the deserted lover was ter rible. By an unlucky chance, he had been absent for six weeks on a tour through the United States, too uncertain in his movements to alloAV of his letters being forwarded, when on his return he found, not only Caroline's letter, but one from his brother, dated a month later, announcing his marriage. He had loved her so Avell, so truly, his confidence in her had been so unbounded, that the shock of her in fidelity was more than he could bear, aggra vated as it was by finding a successful rival in his own brother. He had a long and dan gerous attack of illness ; and as soon as he was sufficiently recovered, obtained leave to return to England. His first visit Avas to his old and tried friend, John Digby, with whom he took counsel as to his future proceedings. He"], [113, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 105 Avas considerably involved \u25a0 there was no chance of active service, still less of rapid pro motion. He sold out, paid his debts, Avhich reduced his capital to a feAv hundred pounds, and determined to emigrate, to begin life again under other auspices. Sir Charles, not sorry to get him out of England, gave him a couple of thousand pounds to assist him in his projects. He sailed for the Cape of Good Hope, where he bought a large tract of land on the extreme frontier. Here he settled down resolutely to the rough life of a colonial farmer, varying his pleasures by hunting ex peditions into the interior, and occasional visits te Cape Town and other parts of the colony. In all his pursuits he was eminently success ful ; he was in a fair way of realizing, if not a large fortune, at least a competence, and Avhat was of still greater importance, he regained his peace of mind. But he yearned for civilized society, and anxiously calculated the years and days Avhen it would be in his power to return to England, with the means of living there in comfort for the rest of his life. This hap pened sooner than he expected. In the fourth"], [114, "106 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. year of his exile, Sir Charles Marston died, in consequence of injuries received from a fall from his horse, without children ; and John Digby lost no time in informing his friend of the event, and urging him to come back at once ; advice Avhich he adopted with, as little delay as possible. Having thus accounted for the first five lustres of Sir Hubert Marston's career, we will return to Mr John Digby's dining room. Lucy resumed her seat upon Marston's invit ation, nothing loth, for she was more curious than she would have liked to have avowed, to see her husband's friend, and listen to his narrative. \" But you have not answered my question, Marston,\" said Digby. \" Where do you spring from?\" \" Well, to begin at the beginning. I was aAvay from home when your letter arrived at the Cape, as I told you in my answer, and then I had to take measures for the sale of my property ; no easy matter out there, I can tell you ; but I was determined to complete every-"], [115, "107 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. thing before I left.

But I do wish I had been here in time, for your sake, Mrs Digby. I should have warned you against the monster you have married.

Upwards of seven months has elapsed since the death of Sir Charles, and I understand that Lady Mar ston says she has no reason to expect the birth of a child. In fact, acting upon the power-of attorney you sent me, I have entered into com munication Avith her solicitor on various sub jects, and he informed me \u2014 officially, I may say \u2014 of AAThat I have just stated to you.\" \" Five hundred a year seems a very small jointure,\" said Marston."], [117, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 109 \" It was all Sir Charles was able to settle on her, by the terms of your grandfather's will, without your concurrence ; and that, I suppose, he did not choose to request.

She restored all the family jeAvels which Sir Charles had given her, and even sent back the carriage and horses which took her away.\" Sir Hubert said nothing, but something"], [118, "110 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. like a sigh escaped him. He rose to depart. \" I shall call on you at your office to-morrow, for I suppose you have plenty of business for me. And tell me which is my nearest way home.\" \"You will find me at Lincoln's Inn any time after ten.\" \" Do have some supper, Sir Hubert, before you go.

And Lucy Avill breAV you a glass of Avhisky-toddy. You have no idea Avhat a capital hand she is at it, though I says it as shouldn't, seeing she learnt the art of me.\" Marston complied. There is no meal to compare with supper for sociability, and time slipped imperceptibly away. Sir Hubert had so much to tell, and he told it so well, so many incidents of his adventurous life to relate, and he related them Avith so much spirit, that his auditors lost all thought of everything else in"], [119, "111 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. the interest he excited, and Lucy quite forgot her shyness and jealousy of the stranger, who threatened to divide her husband's heart Avith her. \" And I have brought all sorts of odds and ends with me,\" he continued. \" I have a lion-skin, which Avill make a capital rug for your drawing-room, Mrs Digby. The original owner had me fast by the shoulder, till one of my Caffres came up, and, putting his gun to his ear, shot him through the head. Splendid fellows those Caffres. It will take me some time, I suspect, to get reconciled to civilized life.\" The clock on the stairs struck tAvelve. They all started at the sound. \" I must be off,\" said Marston, \" or I shall never get into my lodgings.\" \" Oh, pray don't think it necessary to make any excuses for not keeping us up till sunrise.

All love for her had been long since extinguished, but there still lingered a tenderness in his recollection of her, which made him feel a wish to befriend her, if he could but see how he was to set about it ; a problem, the solution of which it was by no means easy to find. And then his"], [121, "113 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. thoughts reverted to the friends he had just left. \" By Jove,\" he muttered to himself, \" Master John has taken care of himself. What a dear little wife he has contrived to pick up. I wonder if I shall ever persuade such a woman as that to Avedge herself into an arm-chair with me.\" And he laughed aloud at the recol lection. He had nearly reached the turning that led to Oxford Terrace, when he perceived something on the other side of the way that attracted his attention, and crossing over, he saw a policeman standing over the inanimate body of a young Avoman. \" Hallo, my man,\" he exclaimed, \" what have you got here ? A murder ? \" \" No, sir, not quite as bad as that, I hope - but I am glad you have come up, for I want a hand to help me.\" \" Good heavens ! \" said Marston, stooping doAvn and looking at the figure before him, \" what a lovely girl !

Is that all ?\" said Marston ; and taking off a plaid which was wrapped across his chest, he threAV it carefully around the unconscious girl, and lifting her from the ground as if she had been a feather, Avith the utmost caution and tenderness, held her in his arms, Avith her head resting on his shoulder, her long dark hair streaming over her face in"], [124, "116 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. the night breeze, while an occasional tear forced its way from her closed eyelids. For a moment Marston stood motionless, gazing on her beautifully-shaped head and finely-chiselled features, as pure and as pale as if they had been cut in marble. He could not refrain from kissing her forehead. The action aroused her. She made a faint struggle as if to free herself from the arms that encircled her, and murmured out, \" Save me, save me.\" \" My clear young lady,\" said Marston, in a voice so gentle that it seemed a miracle how it could have issued from that gigantic frame. ' My dear young lady, you are Avith friends. We are taking you to a place of safety ; and believe me, I would rather die than injure a hair of your head. Noav, policeman, Avill you go first and shoAv us the way.\" The sound of his voice seemed to have reassured her. She made no further effort to release herself, but lay on his breast as quiet and as helpless as an infant, her deep blue eyes fixed on the honest, manly face towering above her. They had not far to go, Wick ham's house being in the neighbourhood of"], [125, "117 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. the Great Western Station. He soon woke up his wife, little expecting so numerous a party. She was an active, good-natured avo man, and as soon as she understood the state of the case, bestirred herself to make her un expected lodger as comfortable as circum stances Avould permit, insisting upon giving up to her her own bed. As soon as he had carried his charge up stairs, Marston prepared to leave the house, promising to call the next day early, to see Iioav she Avas going on. \" Mr Wickham,\" said he \u2014 he had found out the policeman's name \u2014 \" here is my card, and I Avish you could call on me as soon as you are off duty to talk this business over.

If there is anything you prefer, ask for it, and if it is to be had, you shall have it.\" Wickham complied without further pressing, and was soon deep in the mysteries of a pigeon-pie. \" Six months ago,\" continued Marston, \"if we had met in the country I come from, I Avould have offered you broiled elephant's feet or giraffe cutlets.\" \" Cape, Sir Hubert ? \" asked the policeman, with his mouth full."], [128, "120 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Yes, do you know anything about it ? \" \" I was there for two years, Sir Hubert, Avith the 200th.\" \" Ah, an old soldier.

The only difficulty is to know Avhat to do Avith her ; for if her father sends down to Scotland Yard about her, I should get into sad trouble if I kept her in my house unbeknown.\" \" I will consult a legal friend of mine about it,\" said Marston, \" but rely upon it, come AA*hat may, you shall be no loser by your hu manity.

That will be the truth, you know, Sir Hubert,\" he added, with a sly wink. \" Yery good, Wickham. You have me there. I will do what I can for you.

When the tale was ended, Sir Hubert announced his intention of calling on Miss Ashford at once, and ascertaining her own wishes as to her disposal, after which he would see his friend, the lawyer, on the sub ject. \" Best lose no time, Sir Hubert. And wmen you do take her away, I had rather not know Avhere she goes to,\" said the cautious sergeant, as he took up his hat to depart. Sir Hubert took his advice, and was soon on his way to Mrs Wickham's. The good lady let him in herself, and at once recognized the visitor. Opening the door of the parlour, \" The gentleman come to see you, Miss,\" she said.

The next moment, as if first aAvare of the strange nature of her proceeding, she stood trembling before him, like a culprit before his judge. \" Oh, sir, forgive me,\" she said. Marston took her hand, and leading her to the small horse-hair sofa, seated himself beside her. \"My dear Miss Ashford,\" he began, \" I hope you will allow me to consider my self as an old friend, if, as I have reason to believe, you are the sister of a very dear friend of mine, Henry Ashford.\" He had struck the right cord. \" Henry Ashford!\" she exclaimed; \" my brother Harry ! Oh ! tell me, is he alive ? Where is he now ? \" \"He is at Cape Town, and was very Avell Avhen I saAv him about two months ago. Prosperous and happy, but for his sister Susan, who would not answer his letters.\" \" His letters ! I have never received but one ; and how could I Avrite to him, not know ing where to direct. Ah ! the thought of his unkindness and neglect has been the bitterest of all my miseries. I could have borne all if I had dared to hope he still loved me. It was"], [132, "124 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. almost a relief to me to think that he was dead.\" \" He Avrote to you regularly every six months, and not only that, but sent you money in every letter. I can ansAver for the last two remittances of ten pounds each, for they were made through me, and I know they have been paid. Who received the letters that came to your father's house ? \" \" Mrs Ashford always keeps the key of the letter-box herself. But tell me about Harry. Hoav ungrateful he must have thought me ; but, indeed, I have never received but one letter from him since he Avent aAvay. Does he love me still, do you think? \" In her eagerness, she forgot that Sir Hubert was an acquaintance of not more than tAvelve hours' standing. She felt as if he must enter into all her feelings ; and he did. \" Well,\" he replied, \" he talked of Susan incessantly, and looked forward to the time when he should be able to come to England, and take you back Avith him. I think you need be under no fears on that head.\" \" How can I Avrite to him ? \""], [133, "125 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" I shall write to him myself by the next mail, and if you will have a letter ready for him in the course of the Aveek, I will under take to forward it. As for those he has writ ten to you, I will consider Avhat is best to be done. And iioav alloAv me to introduce my self, and tell you Avhy I have a right to take an interest in you. My name is Hubert Marston, now Sir Hubert, by the death of my brother, Sir Charles. For four years I was an emigrant at the Cape of Good Hope. Tavo years ago, I re turned to Cape Town Avith a fever I had caught on a hunting expedition, and which brought me literally to death's door. Your brother, Avhom I had known slightly, attended me, and for ten days and nights never left my room. To his skill and attention, under God, I owe my life. Since then, Ave lived on terms of brotherly intimacy whenever Ave were thrown together. Judge, then, what happiness it gives me to be of use to a sister he so dearly loves.\" \" Oh, Sir -Hubert, how can I ever thank you as I ought for all you have already done for me. But for you, what might have been my fate last night ! \""], [134, "126 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Nay, you must not exaggerate. My friend Sergeant Wickham has a claim to half your thanks. But I wish to know if you have formed any plans ? I presume you have no Avish to return to your father's ? \" \" Oh, no,\" she replied, with a shudder. \" I have no plans. If I could but get a situation, somewhere out of London, if possible.\" \" Well, Ave will think about it, but you must leave it to me. As your brother's friend, Avill you accept of me as your temporary guardian, for it appears that your father is not in a state to afford you the protection you require.\" She burst into tears. \" Oh, forgive me,\" she said, \" if I do not say all I feel, but I am not used to such kind ness, such happiness. It is too much.\" \" Then I have your permission to act for you. That being so, the first thing will be to remove you to some more suitable abode. Here is one of my cards. I shall not pro bably come myself, but you may safely trust yourself to anybody bringing one like it, but to no one else. There is also another circum-"], [135, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 127 stance I must mention to you. Your brother is exceedingly anxious about you, and begged me to use my best endeavours to find you out ; and he also intrusted me with tAventy pounds, which I was to place in your own hands, and, in consequence, I have brought them with 35 me. \" Dear, dear Harry ! \" exclaimed Susan ; \" so kind, so considerate ! But does he not want them himself, and what am I to do Avith them ? \" \" As for the first part of your question, you may take the money without scruple. I assure you Ashford is doing very well, Avith a capital business. And, with regard to the second, though it is rather a delicate subject to touch upon, I am sure you wdl forgive me for hint ing that Henry Ashford's sister is not quite dressed as he Avould like to see her.\" Susan coloured, and murmured out some thing about a better gown at home. \" And now I must leave you,\" said Sir Hubert. \" I have all your business and some of my own to attend to. When next I see"], [136, "128 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. you, I hope to have some good news to tell you. Remember, on no account to stir out till I come or send for you.\" He took her hand, which trembled in his, and by the quivering of her lips he saAv it was with difficulty she could restrain herself. \" Is there anything you Avish to say to me before I go ? \" he asked. It was evident there was, but the Avords re fused to come. At length she said, but with out venturing to look up, \" Will it be long ? \" He caught her meaning. \" I hope to see you to-morrow, but at any rate, I will write. So good-bye for the pre sent. God bless you.\" For a moment Susan remained looking at the door which had just closed on him ; then hearing Mrs Wickham's step, she rushed to the table on which he had left his card; snatched it up, kissed it, and hid it in her bosom. Of course, Mrs Wickham was dying to hear the news, but her guest was by no means in clined to gratify her. It Avas only by down-"], [137, "129 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. right hard pumping that she contrived to ex tract, bit by bit, all that had passed. \" Well, only to think of his knowing our Master Harry. Did he tell you his name ? \" \"Marston, I think he said.\" She could not bring herself to utter \" Hubert \" to ears profane. \" Ah, yes ; that's it. And he is a barrow night. Wickham has got his card, and just shoAved it me. Sir Somebody Marston. I will ask Tom all about him when he comes in, for he went to breakfast with him this morn ing.\" \u2014 Susan felt very jealous of the Sergeant. \u2014 \"And a nobler-looking gentleman I never see,\" continued Mrs Wickham. \" My Tom ain't bad-looking either ; but la ! he ain't to be compared to him. And] not a bit of pride about him, except Avhat's right, I'll be bound. ' Hoav are you, Mrs Wickham ? ' says he ; 'I hope I see you well ? ' He's a real gentle man ; one of the right sort.\" \" Do you think so, Jane ? I have seen so few, you know.\" \" Ah, that he is ; and I knoAv what I'm say- VOL.

There Avould not be many a handsomer couple in England that day, I'll lay a penny.\" \" How can you be so silly, Jane ! \" said Susan, kissing her, nevertheless ; perhaps as much to conceal her own burning face, as from any other motive. In the mean time, Marston, hailing a cab, was soon on his way to Lincoln's Inn. \" How late you are,\" said Digby, as his riend entered the room. \" You would not say so if you knew all that has happened since Ave parted.\" And then he proceeded to give him a full and particular account of the events of the night. \"By Jove, Avhat an extraordinary story!\" exclaimed Digby, when Sir Hubert had con cluded. \" You are a regular knight-errant of the olden time ; a champion of injured inno cence. Not twenty-four hours in England, and you find yourself the hero of an adventure Avhich would make the fortune of a dramatic writer of the present day. But this is only"], [139, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 131 the first act. Hoav do you mean to carry it out ? \" \" That is just what I want you to tell me. Old Mr Ashford, it appears, has been in a state of imbecility for some time, and is said to be dying. So there is nothing to be done with him.

But Avhat could have been her motive ? \" \"Probably, Miss Ashford Avill be entitled to some money at her father's death, and the plan was, to force her into such a position as to make a marriage necessary.\" \" What infernal villany ! But at all events she has been saved from it once, and must not be exposed to it again. But how ? For all publicity must be avoided for Miss Ashford's sake.\" \" Yes ; it is out of the question to make a neAvspaper business of it. It would do her irreparable injury. Are you sure those re mittances of her brother's have been paid, and not to her ? \""], [140, "132 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Sure. She knows nothing of them, and that the last tAvo have been paid I knoAv, for I gave Harry Ashford bills for them on my banker, and they figure as paid in the last ac count he sent me to the Cape.\" \" Can you get the bills, so that Ave may see the endorsement?\" \" No doubt. They must be at the bank- er's. \" Then get them, and bring them Avith you Avhen you come to dinner.\" \" But there is another thing. She must be moved.

I will talk it over with Lucy. Be tAveen us, Ave shall strike out something.\" \" Ali right. Then I'm off to the banker's, and then I must return home, for I have ap pointed half a dozen tradesmen to call this afternoon.\" While Marston went off in one direction, Digby jumped into a Hansom, and hurried off"], [141, "133 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. to Kensington. He found his Avife with her bonnet on, just preparing to go out in her brougham, a Avedding-present of old Mr Digby's. \" John,\" she exclaimed, on seeing her hus band enter the house, \"Avhat can bring you back at this time of day ? \" John, Scotch-fashion, answered her question by another. \" Lucy, did not a cousin of yours marry a Mr Ashford ? \" \" Yes, cousin Mary \u25a0 papa's first cousin.

But aftenvards, papa Avould not let me go there any more, and all intercourse was broken off between us. I have a sort of idea that Mr Ashford did something or other that was not right. But why do you ask ? \" \" I will tell you.\" And then he related to her the history of Ashford and his tAvo children, to which she listened Avith breathless interest, and many \u25a0tears."], [142, "134 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Poor dear Susan !\" she said ; \" poor little cousin! We Avere so fond of each other, though she Avas quite a little toddle in those days. What a life of misery ! and I have been so happy !

Where Avill you put her ? \" \" She must put up with an attic. We have nothing else for her. I suppose she will be contented with that.\" \" I suspect, after all she has gone through, she Avould be contented with a bed on the stairs. Now then, you had better be off. Here is the address Avhich Hubert gave me.\" In less than a quarter of an horn*, Mrs Digby was at Mrs Wickham's door, but she found it no easy matter to gain admittance to Miss Ashford. The good lady of the house watched over the safety of her charge Avith the most"], [143, "135 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. commendable vigilance. It was only after re peated assurances that she came with a mes sage from Sir Hubert Marston, that Lucy was introduced to her cousin's presence. Susan started up in astonishment when she saw a young and [pretty woman, in the most irre proachable costume, approach her, and taking her by the hand and kissing her, ask her if she did not knoAv her. \" No, indeed, ma'am,\" replied Susan, hardly knoAving whether she was greeted by an ap parition, or a real living being of flesh and blood. \" Have you forgotten cousin Lucy, Avho used to come and play with you and Harry ? \" \" Are you indeed my cousin Lucy ? \" \" Indeed and indeed. But you may well ask ; it is so long since we met. It Avas not my fault, Susan, believe me, but I had quite lost sight of you. It is only to-day, not an hour ago, that I heard where you were, and I am come to take you home with me, so get on your bonnet and come at once.\" \" Yes, ma'am,\" said Susan ; but she gave no sign of moving."], [144, "136 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Well, then, set about it,\" said Lucy, Avho was rather of an impatient turn. \" My hus band Avill be expecting us, for I am married, Susan.

He told me not.\" \" AVhat a tiresome, obstinate child you are, Susan,\" said Mrs Digby, sharply. \" Cannot you trust me ? \" \" Oh, yes, indeed. But he charged me so strictly not to go with any one who did not bring something from him.

Do you know where Sir Hubert lives ? \" \" No, but I think Mrs Wickham does.\" Mrs Wickham was summoned, and gave the address. \" I shall be back in ten minutes, Susan. Mind you are ready by that time.\" She then AAdiisked into her brougham, and in a few minutes was at Marston's lodgings. \" Is Sir Hubert in ? \" she asked, almost before the door was opened. The answer was in the affirmative. \" Then pray tell him Mrs Digby is at the door, and AA'ishes to see him immedi ately.\" The servant vanished, and Avas soon replaced by Marston himself. Lucy had con cocted a little plan for keeping him in ignor ance of the connection between Susan and herself. \" Oh, Sir Hubert,\" she exclaimed, as soon as she saw him, \" I am just come from your heroine. John has told me all about her, and I have found out an admirable asylum for her, but she refuses to stir unless I bring her some token from you ; \" upon which she re lated to him the contest in which she had been engaged, and her OAvn defeat."], [146, "138 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Marston could not help laughing. \" What a determined young lady she is ! But you must not be annoyed Avith her. She was quite right.

I must see her again, for I take a great inter est in her, for her brother's sake, as well as for her own.\" \" Oh, it is too long to tell you now, and I have no time to lose. You shall knoAv all about it at dinner.\" Armed with her talisman, Mrs Digby drove back to Mrs Wickham's, to the great per plexity of her coachman, who hardly kneAV what to think of all these eA'olutions. \" There it is, Susan,\" cried Lucy, as she entered the room and flung the card on the table. \" And"], [147, "139 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. I have something better \u25a0 a letter from him to tell you that I am a perfectly trustworthy person.\" \" A letter for me ? ' \" Yes, there it is. See what he says of >j me. Susan turned to the window to read the precious missive unobserved. \" May I see it ? \" said her cousin, when she had finished it, and was folding it up. Susan did not quite like parting Avith her treasure, but she gave it to Mrs Digby, Avith a tolerably good grace, watching her anxiously all the time, and astonished at the composure Avith Avhich that lady perused its contents- At length it Avas restored to her, to her inex pressible satisfaction, for she had half expected to see it thrown into the fire. \" There it is, Susan, and I hope you will take great care of it, for the sake of the good character it gives me and my husband. And now let us be off.\" Mrs Wickham had lent Susan a bonnet and shawl of her own, not exactly adapted for a young girl, but still better than nothing, and"], [148, "140 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. not forming any great contrast with the rest of her homely attire. The leave-taking with the worthy dame was the most trying part of the business. Susan threw herself into her arms, and assured her over and over again that she should never forget the kindness she had received from her at the hour of her great est need ; while Mrs Wickham rejoiced at the opportunity that had been afforded her for proving her affection to Miss Susan and her dear mother, and in the same breath lamented the necessity of their separation. \" And not to know, Miss Susan, Avhere you are to go to ; no, nor the name of your friend who is come to take you away,\" she added, with a reproachful glance at Mrs Digby. \" My clear Mrs Wickham,\" said that lady, partly in exculpation, and partly to put an end to a scene Avhich, in her opinion, had lasted long enough, \" your husband and mine think it better that at present you should be able to say, if anybody asks, that you know nothing at all about it, and, like good wives, you know Ave are bound to do what our husbands tell us.

As soon as she found herself alone with her cousin, Susan's fortitude gave Avay, and she burst, for the first time in her life, into a fit of hysterical sobbing, so violent and prolonged as somewhat to alarm her companion. Lucy, however, did not lose her presence of mind, but, pulling down the blinds, and drawing Susan to her, by dint of soothing and caress ing, restored her to something like composure before the carriage stopped at her own door."], [150, "142 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Hurrying her importation past the inquiring eyes of the servant, she led her to her own room, and began making immediate prepara tions for her accommodation. Deeming some explanation necessary, she turned to the serv ant who had folio Aved them up-stairs. \" Anne,\" she said, \" my cousin, Miss Ash ford, is come to pass a feAv days with me.

They will require a little alteration, so Ave will set about it at once.\" a Anne could not understand it. She was thoroughly mystified, but, being full of good nature and willingness, promised her cordial co-operation. \"She is a treasure, that girl,\" said Mrs Digby, in a whisper loud enough for Anne to hear."], [151, "143 CHAPTER VII. Punctual as clock-work, Sir Hubert Mar ston made his appearance at seven in Mrs Digby's drawing-room, in Avhich he found no one but that lady and her husband. \" Sir Hubert,\" she said, \" I was afraid you would find it dull passing another evening alone with John and me, so I have asked a young cousin of mine to meet you. But you must not expect much from her, for she has never been out.\" \" I shall be delighted to make the acquaint ance of any friend or connection of yours, Mrs Digby,\" said the outer voice that issued from Marston's lips ; but there was an inner one that muttered, \" What a bore it is that women, even the best of them, cannot let a felloAV alone,"], [152, "144 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. but must always be slipping a sister or a cou sin at him.\" \" I Avon der what she can be about,\" pur sued Mrs Digby, \" I left her quite ready to come doAvn. I had better go and look after her.\" She had not far to go. Susan was stand ing in the passage, with her hand almost on the lock of the door, trying to screw up her courage to make her entrance en scene. A short whispering took place, and then Mrs Digby, taking Susan by the arm, opened the door, and almost dragged her into the room. \" Sir Hubert Marston ; my cousin ; \" was all she said by way of introduction. Sir Hubert was already deep in conversa tion with Digby on \" my cousin's \" affairs. He just raised his eyes, glanced for a moment at the tAvo ladies, bowed, and resumed the discussion. Miss Ashford, Avho Avas already advancing Avith extended hand to greet him, shrunk back, with difficulty concealing her mortification, while Mrs Digby clapped her hands in triumph. \" I was sure of it,\" she cried ; \" I told you he Avould not knoAv you again, Susan.\""], [153, "145 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. And that he did not was no great imputa tion against his poAvers of observation. The tAvo hours before dinner had been so well em ployed, that, though Susan was taller than her cousin, by letting out here and letting doAAm there, one of Mrs Digby 's quietest dresses had undergone such alterations as to enable Susan to put it on with comfort, and to defy the scrutiny of any but a practised eye. Lucy herself, struck with the beauty of her hair, had undertaken the task of dressing it, and Avas justly proud of the success of her efforts ; but the hands resisted all her attempts to ob literate the traces of hard work. The aid of almond paste and other auxiliaries was invoked in vain. Though the hands and fingers still retained their delicate shape, the skin remained rough, and not of the whitest hue. \" Never mind, Susan, they are very pretty hands,\"said the comforter, kissing them. \"They will be all right in a week.

No indeed, I am ashamed to say I did not know her again. But Avhat does it all mean ? I thought you called her your cousin ? \" \" Well, Sir Hubert, is there any law against her being my cousin ? And not only my cousin, but I think I may say my oldest friend.\" \" I hope you will explain the mystery, Mrs Digby, for if it was your intention to surprise and puzzle me I must confess you have com pletely succeeded.\" Dinner was announced. \" One thing at a time,\" said Lucy ; \" let us eat our dinners uoav in peace, and afterwards John shall tell you all about it.\" Nothing so trying as a dinner-party to one not much used to society; but Susan got through it very well, partly by her oaati natural"], [155, "147 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. tact and absence of anything approaching to vulgarity, partly by the incessant though im perceptible efforts of her companions to put her at her ease. Her greatest discomfort Avas that she found herself placed exactly opposite Sir Hubert, and she could never raise her eyes without encountering his ; but by degrees she got used to it, and though her replies to any observations addressed to her Avere monosyl labic, she began to take an interest in the con versation, and thought Lucy in a desperate hurry to leave the gentlemen by themselves. As soon as Digby found himself alone with his friend, he gave him a full explanation of the connection existing betAveen his Avife and Miss Ashford, and then proceeded to detail the steps he meant to take, to free the latter from the tyranny of her step-mother. \" Old Ash ford,\" he said, \" is and has been for years a drunken blackguard, and by his daughter's account is, if not actually dying, in a state of hopeless imbecility.

I shall represent to my father-in -laAv that it is his duty to come forward to protect his cousin's child.

It is a shocking habit to get into. Don't you think so, Susan?\" \" I don't know,\" was the rather unsatisfac tory answer. She certainly had thought the time long, but it was not likely that Sir Hubert could have any very bad habits. \" That is right, Susan,\" said Digby, good naturedly. \" You ought to take our parts, for we have been discussing your affairs, and to-"], [159, "151 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. morrow I mean to discuss them Avith Mrs Ashford.\" \"Do you mean to tell her where I am, sir?\" asked Susan, turning a little pale. \" That depends upon circumstances ; but you need not be afraid of her claiming you.\" \"And if she did,\" said Lucy, \" you need not be afraid of our giving you up.

They seemed to say that she Avould have no objection to the case occurring, which would secure to her such efficient protection. Perhaps Mr Digby so interpreted them when he said, \" There Avill be no need of that.

According to him her good-humour was never at fault.\" \" Ah, with him, perhaps ; but that was so different.\" \" Susan,\" said Mr Digby, interrupting the conversation, \" I wish you would Avrite your name on this sheet of paper, to enable me to compare it with the endorsements on the bills.\" She complied, and scrawled out a large straggling Susan Ashford in a childish hand. Digby covdd not refrain from giving a glance"], [162, "154 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. at his friend as they inspected the autograph. Susan caught the look, and guessed its mean ing. Blushing deeply, she said, \" It is not my fault, indeed. I did my best to keep up what Mamma had taught me, but I had so little time, and, since Harry went I have had no one to help me.\" \"My dear Susan,\" replied Digby, \"you cannot suppose for a moment that any one would be so unjust or cruel as to reproach you for the culpable negligence of others. Marston and I have been discussing the best plan for you to adopt, to make up for lost time. As soon as I have seen Mrs Ashford, we will talk it over.\" \" For my part, Miss Ashford,\" said Marston, \" I can only say that I am surprised at finding you Avhat you are, considering all you have undergone.\" After this the conversation took a more lively turn, and by Mrs Digby's express desire, Sir Hubert related more of his adventures on African soil, to Avhich Susan listened Avith breathless interest, her large intelligent eyes fixed upon the speaker, and the colour rising"], [163, "155 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. to her cheeks whenever he mentioned any ex ploit more perilous than common. It seemed to her as if she was in the presence of one of the mighty men of old. Seated on the sofa with her cousin, ever and anon, in her excite ment, she gave Lucy's hand, wdiich was clasp ed in hers, a grip Avhich, though it brought a smile to that lady's face, nearly brought tears into her eyes. At length the narrative was concluded, and Marston rose to depart. It was already late, and he would not remain for supper, though he invited himself to dinner for the following day. \" I hope to have all my treasures unpacked in a day or two, Mrs Digby,\" he said, \" and if you were disposed to be very amiable, you Avould make John bring you and Miss Ashford to luncheon some day, to look them over. You could take your lion skin back with you, and I hope you will be able to persuade your cousin to choose some thing as a recollection. There are one or two monkey-skins Avhich Avould make capital muffs.\" \" Oh, I should like it of all things, should not you, Susan? Never mind asking John;"], [164, "156 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. I will give him no peace till he names a day.\" When the heads of Mr and Mrs Digby were laid that night on their respective pillows, the lady, after various restless movements, said, \" Would it not be nice, John ?\" John, who Avas thoroughly tired, and very sleepy, Avas not particularly anxious for con versation at that moment. \" What Avould be nice?\" he groAAded out. \" Oh, you knoAv Avhat I mean. If Sir Hu bert and Susan Avere toTike each other.\" \" No ! it would not be nice at all ! \" replied Digby, rousing himself. \" I have nothing to say against Susan Ashford. I dare say she is a very good girl, and, as far as we can judge, has escaped untainted from an association Avith persons who Avould have corrupted a weak-minded person, body and soul. But she is not, and never can be, a proper Avife for Hubert Marston. So I must beg of you not to encourage any such romantic ideas in her. They can only conduce to her oaati unhappiness. Women are ahvays thinking of marrying and giving in marriage j but take"], [165, "157 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. my word for it, after what he has already ex perienced, Marston is not the man to fall in love Avith the first pretty face he meets. If I thought there was a chance of it, I should regret her having ever entered this house. But there is not. He quite agrees with me, that the best thing for her is to educate her for a governess.\" \" A governess ! \" cried Lucy. \" Susan a governess ! No, that she shall never be. She might as Avell have remained with her step-mother.\" \"And, pray,\" \"said her husband, \"AAdiat plan have you formed for her? For she is Avithout fortune, and must earn her liveli hood.\" Lucy had no plan to propose, which natur ally only made her more vehement against the one proposed by Digby ; and the discussion which ensued assumed a more angry tone than any Avhich had occurred since their marriage. Driven from her intrenchments, one by one, by her husband's logic, but unwilling to acknow ledge her defeat, not very well pleased Avith herself, and a little out of temper at her want"], [166, "158 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. of success, she closed the debate by saying, in rather a lachrymose tone of voice, \" You are so cross, John, I will not talk to you any more.\" It is to be hoped that John found means of making his peace, \u2014 a duty the more incum bent on him, as he Avas undoubtedly in the wrong. For I have always understood, that, by imprescriptible right and custom imme morial, the lady alone can lecture in the con jugal couch, and that the gentleman can only, and that merely by sufferance, venture from time to time upon the gentlest of expostula tions. Be that as it may, whatever schemes Mrs Digby may have formed, she saAv the expediency of keeping her own counsel for the future. Next morning, as soon as breakfast was over, Digby departed in quest of Mrs Ash ford. He found no difficulty in obtaining admittance to that lady's presence; indeed, she opened the door for him herself, and as soon as she learnt his wish to speak to her on business, ushered him into the parlour, and"], [167, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 159 desired to knoAv his name, and what he had to say to her. \" My name is Digby,\" he said, handing her his card, \" and I am come to inform you and Mr Ashford that Miss Susan Ashford, avIio was compelled to leave this house tAvo nights ago, has found a safe asylum Avith some friends.\" Susan's name acted 'on her step-mother much as a piece of red cloth is supposed to do upon the bull. \" Susan !\" she exclaimed, \" Susan is an im pertinent, ungrateful wretch ! If you come from her, sir, the best thing you can do is to send her back here directly, or it will be the worse for her.\" \" I presume, ma'am, you are speaking in the name of her father.\" \" Her father ! \u2014 her father is dead ! He died two hours after she ran away. Her in gratitude killed him. But he has left me her guardian, and I insist upon her returning to my house, or I will take measures to make her.\""], [168, "160 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" That alters the case, no doubt,\" said Digby. \" Would you have any objection to show me the will, that I may be able to make my report to my client ? \" Mrs Ashford produced from her pocket the document in question, which she allowed her visitor to peruse, without however trusting it out of her OAvn hands. It Avas perfectly regu lar, and evidently drawn up by a professional man. It was dated a year back, and by it Mr Ashford left everything he had to leave to his dear wife, Sarah Ashford, constituting her sole executrix and guardian to his daughter. When he had read it through, Digby said that there could be no doubt as to the testa tor's intentions, and advised her to sit down at once and Avrite to the person in whose house Susan was staying, demanding her immediate restoration. Charmed with the advice, Mrs Ashford, having found with some little trouble a clean sheet of paper, wrote as folloAvs, from Digby's dictation, and under his supervision : \u2014 \" Sir, as the guardian of Susan Ashford, so appointed by her father's will, I require you to surrender her to me within twenty-four hours,"], [169, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 161 to prevent the necessity of legal proceedings. Yours obediently, Sarah Ashford.\" \" Who is it to be directed to ? \" she said. \"Anybody you please, Mrs Ashford. To me, if you like,\" he replied, going to the Avin dow with the letter in his hand, and compar ing it Avith a piece of paper which he took from his pocket-book. \" What is it you mean, sir ? \" \" I mean that Miss Ashford is in my house, under my protection, and that I have not the slightest thoughts of giving her up to yours.\" 33 Mrs Ashford Avas furious. She saAv that she had fallen into a trap, though she could not quite make out of Avhat nature. \" You a gentleman, to come and insult a lone widoAv in this way ! Why, the dustman is a better gentleman than you. But I'll have you up for it. I'll go to a magistrate. I'll have Susan back this night, if there is laAv in the land.\" \" I am going to a magistrate myself,\" re plied Digby ; \" and I was on the point of ask ing you to accompany me, just to explain Iioav A'OL. I. ll"], [170, "162 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. you came to sign yourself Susan, instead of Sarah, Ashford.\" \"Why, I have just signed myself Sarah Ashford. Susan, indeed ! I scorn the name ! \" \"You seem to forget, Mrs Ashford, that Avhen you got those two bills cashed, you in dorsed them as Susan Ashford.\" For a moment Mrs Ashford Avas taken aback, but she soon recovered herself. \" I Avas not going to leave a young girl,\" she said, \" in possession of so much money.\" \" I fear that you will find Avriting another person's name to a bill of exchange productive of much inconvenience to you. Had you your husband's authority?\" \"His authority ! No. Every one knows that A. has been little better than an idiot for many years past. I acted for him, of course.\" \" An avvkward admission, Mrs Ashford. Do you not see that if he has been so long in the position you describe, it -will invalidate his will, if we attack it ; and where will you be then?\" Mrs Ashford felt that she Avas beat, and at Digby's mercy. She began to Avhimper and"], [171, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 163 talk about her wretchedness, with her husband lying dead in the house. Profiting by this, Digby proceeded to offer terms. \" We have no wish to be hard on you, Mrs Ashford, but you must renounce the guardian ship of Susan Ashford ; in Avhich case you will not be molested, and your late husband's Avill may remain undisputed. Should you refuse, it Avill be contested, and in all probability set aside ; proceedings \\\\Till be taken against you for forgery, and an inquiry instituted into the occur rences of the other night. It appears certain that something of a deleterious nature Avas put into Miss Ashford's tea ; the policeman and the gentleman avIio picked her up, and the Avoman of the house to which they took her, are all -of opinion that the state of insensibility in which she Avas found was not natural, and moreover Miss Ashford perfectly recognized your nephew's voice in her room. Many people have been sent out of the country for less.\" \" It's a pack of Avicked lies,\" exclaimed Mrs Ashford."], [172, "164 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Very well,\" said Digby, taking up his hat. \" I see I have nothing further to do here.\" But before he opened the door, she caught hold of the skirt of his coat, and entreated him to give her a few minutes for reflection. A long scene ensued, consisting of protestations of innocence on her part, mingled with asser tions of her unvarying affection and kindness for Susan ; not without some reflections on that young lady's ingratitude and obstinacy ; to all of which Digby answered only by mono syllables. When she had concluded her tirade? he gave her ten minutes for making up her mind, and the end of it was, as might have been expected, that she submitted, though with no very good grace, to the condition im posed upon her. Digby dreAv up a short but explicit renunciation of all rights of guardian ship, Avhich she signed and he witnessed. Recollecting also Susan's request, he then asked after her little sister. Mrs Ashford, de lighted at an opportunity of venting her spite and vexation, replied that she had nearly cried herself into fits when she found that Susan had deserted her. Unfortunately for her"], [173, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 165 \u25a0character for veracity, Digby, as he Avas leaving the house, met the young lady in the arms of a girl who had been called in to attend her, showing no signs of indisposition or affliction. When they all met at dinner, Digby made his report of the interview between himself and Mrs Ashford. He further stated that he had seen Mr. Baines, Avho had consented to act as Susan's guardian, provided another Avas named avIio would relieve him from all trouble and responsibility. \" I Avould have offered myself, Susan,\" he said, \" but connected as I am Avith Mr Baines, it is perhaps as well that you should select some one else. I am sure my father Avill consent to act, and if you approve, I Avill apply to him.\" Susan thanked him warmly for all the trouble he had taken ; but when it came to forming a decision about another guardian she hesitated, and murmured out something not very intelligible. Luckily for her, Mrs Digby Avas quick-Avitted enough to guess her meaning. \" Of course,\" she said, \" Sir Hubert is the proper person to be her guardian, after all he has done for her.\""], [174, "166 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. She carefully avoided looking at her husband, who Avas at no pains to conceal the annoyance the proposal gave him. \" Nonsense, Lucy,\" he replied ; \" Marston has plenty of business of his oavu to attend to, without undertaking that of another person.\" \" By no means,\" said Marston ; \" I shall only be too happy to undertake the office, if Miss Ashford Avill confer it on me. In fact, I should have proposed it myself, had I not feared it might look like intruding my claims. For I have a claim, Avere it only as being, to a certain extent, Harry Ashford's representative, who would be the proper person, were he in Eng land. It therefore remains for you to decide, Miss Ashford. You will not find me a very severe guardian.\" Susan's acquiescence Avas not long doubtful. For a moment she felt as if she had nothing further to wish for on earth. \"Is not that well managed, Susan?\" said her cousin, when they had left the tAvo gentle men to their potations. \" I could not bear the thought of your being given over to the tender mercies of two old men, though one of them"], [175, "167 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. is my own father. We will make Sir Hubert do what Ave like.\" Mr John Digby had to swallow his vexation as best he might, but his wife's turn came before long."], [176, "168 CHAPTER VIII. For, much to Mrs Digby's disgust, Sir Hu bert Marston loudly proclaimed his anxiety to see all the business that detained him in Lon don settled Avith as little delay as possible, that he might be able to proceed at once to Thornwood Priory, where his presence was re quired. In this Digby encouraged him to the utmost of his power, and did his best to facilitate his departure. The necessary ar rangements for constituting him Susan Ash ford's guardian were got through with unex ampled despatch ; inquiries were set on foot in every direction, with a vieAV to finding some suitable person to take charge of that young lady, and Digby entertained well-founded hopes of getting his friend heart-Avhole out of"], [177, "169 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. London. It is true that Marston dined almost every day at Kensington, but his attentions Avere so equally divided betAveen Lucy and her cousin, that it Avas impossible to detect the slightest preference for one or the other. One evening the conversation took a more intimate and confidential turn than usual, and Lucy, either thoughtlessly, or from malice prepense, hinted at the probability of the Priory not be ing long without a mistress. \" Ah, Mrs Digby,\" said Marston, avIio Avas aAvare that the love-passages of his early life Avere no secret in that house, \" it avuT be long, very long, before I again venture to love with a hope of return. You must not be offended with me, if I acknoAA'ledge that my confidence in woman's constancy is much shaken. Per haps I ought rather to say that I no longer feel confidence in my own poAver of inspiring it. Lucy was provoked, not only with Sir Hu bert for this avowal, but Avith Susan for the composure Avith Avhich she heard it. To judge by her looks, her only feeling Avas that of in tense sympathy for his sufferings, mingled"], [178, "170 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. perhaps AAith a feeling of detestation for her avIio had been the cause of them ; for in the course of conversation Avith her cousin, she too had heard all that related to Marston's early career. In her Avildest imaginings the possibility of his marrying her had never en tered her head. To be his servant, his slave, to Avait on him in the most menial capacity, with the chance of an occasional kindly look and kindly Avord, seemed to her the summit of earthly happiness. She Avas as fully convinced as Digby could possibly be of her unfitness to be his Avife ; still, it was some comfort to knoAv that there was no immediate probability of an other being called on to fill that enviable post. To cover the embarrassment she felt at having introduced such an unlucky topic, and piqued by the declaration Avhich it had elicited, Lucy retorted with a forced laugh, \" It is well, Sir Hubert, that your last words qualify the censure you pronounce upon us, and in con sideration of your humility Susan and I will try to forget it. But it is a pity, Avhile you were there, that you did not select a bride amongst your favourites, the Caffres.\""], [179, "171 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Well, when once one's eye gets accustomed to the colour, there is great beauty to be found amongst them, and they have, generally speak ing, splendid figures ; but I confess I should not like to have to teach my wife the alpha bet.\" Another unlucky speech ! Susan, conscious of her oAvn deficiencies, blushed to the roots of her hair ; Avhile Lucy, really angry at the effect produced upon her cousin, maintained a moody silence, which Marston himself, perceiving the construction Avhich seemed to be placed upon his words, felt no inclination to break. The only person, who was unembarrassed was Digby, aaIio rather enjoyed his Avife's discomfiture, and Avho thought this a favourable opportunity for mentioning, that he believed that he had at last found a person in every way qualified to take charge of Susan. He was proceeding to enter upon details, but Marston stopped him. \" It is out of the question,\" he said, \" to enter upon business at this time of night. To morroAv is the day fixed for Mr Ashford's funeral, which Ave have both promised to at tend. When that is over, I will return here"], [180, "172 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. with you, to talk the matter over quietly, and see if it meets with Miss Ashford's approbation; for, after all, her comfort is the first thing to be considered in any arrangement of this nature.\" And during the rest of the evening he did his best to efface any painful impression his words might have occasioned, by devoting himself entirely to Susan. With no great success, hoAvever, for she guessed his motive ; and though she exerted herself to the utmost, she had too little experience in the art of con cealing her feelings, to conquer her depression and mortification. Not that she had supposed for a moment that Marston had alluded to her, but his Avoids had aAvakened a painful sense of her own inferiority to other girls of her OAvn age and position. She had been informed of the intentions of her guardians respecting her, and had cheer fully acquiesced in them. She knew that it Avas necessary to repair by her OAvn exertions the neglect of which she had been the victim, and her oavii good sense pointed out to her that she could not remain for ever an inmate"], [181, "173 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. of the home in which she had passed the hap piest, or at least the most tranquil, days of her life. She thought, too, that she perceived a sort of change in Mr Digby's manner toAvards her, and this lessened the regret she felt at quitting his house. The death of her father had caused her greater pain than she could have conceived possible, considering how slight had been the nature of their intercourse. She could not forget that his last act had been one which had, in all probability, saved her from a fate Avorse than death, and her tears fell fast when she reflected that it Avas now out of her poAver to shoAv her gratitude for his intervention. She had expressed a wish to attend his funeral, but this she Avas persuaded to give up, and to allow herself to be represented by Sir Hubert, aa'Iio had also secured the attendance of Mr John Digby, as the substitute of his father in -law. Susan had insisted on retaining five pounds out of the money sent her by her brother, for the purpose of buying some souvenir for Mrs Wick ham, rather to her cousin's vexation, who had"], [182, "174 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. been informed, under an injunction of secresy, that the sergeant and his wife had already re ceived an ample reward for their services from Marston . But Susan Avas resolute, and Lucy Avas obliged to submit, though she protested that it Avould be impossible with the rest of the money to buy half the articles of dress Avhich Avere absolutely indispensable. HoAvever, the ques tion of toilette was at last satisfactorily settled, no great variety being required for a person in deep mourning. Even a sum of tAvo pounds some odd shillings was placed in Susan's hands, as a balance legitimately her due ; but I have a strong suspicion that Lucy drew pretty largely on her own small fund of pin-money to accomplish this desirable result. After the funeral, as had been arranged, Marston and his friend returned to Kensing ton, and found the tAvo cousins impatiently Avaiting their arrival. It was the first time that Sir Hubert had ever seen Miss Ashford becomingly dressed, for hitherto she had con tinued to Avear the goAvn Aviiich Lucy had provided for her. Black became her style of beauty Avell, and Marston Avas obliged to con-"], [183, "175 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. sess to himself, that not even in Caffre-land had he ever seen a more graceful figure. His evi dent look of admiration as he entered the room was not lost upon Mrs Digby, who re- Avarded him for it by Avelcoming him Avith one of her sunniest smiles. \" I am so glad you are come,\" she said, in a half whisper. \" Poor dear Susan has been in such a Ioav, nervous state all the morning, that I could hardly persuade her to meet you noAV. She is reproaching herself for not hav ing shoAvn her poor father more affection, for not feeling more sorrow for his loss. Do say something to comfort her.\" \" My dear Miss Ashford,\" said Marston, going up to her and taking her hand, \" your sorrow is most natural, but at least you have the consolation of knoAving that you showed your father all the affection you were allowed to shoAv. It was not your fault if he did not make you more of a companion to him Avhile living ; and in the state to Avhich he Avas re duced, poor man, a prolongation of life would have only been a prolongation of misery. And be assured that, if you have lost him who ought"], [184, "176 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. to have been your best friend through life, you have found others avIio will do their utmost to supply his place.\" \" I know it,\" she replied ; \" I know it well. Still, if I could have been by his bed-side at the last \" \" Nay,\" said Marston, \" let not that idea be a subject of self-reproach, for it Avas the fault of others that you were not there. It Avas simply impossible.\" \" Of course it was,\" said Digby. \" I am sorry to interrupt you, but I must go to the office before dinner, and Ave have much to settle in the meantime. But first, I will tell you Avhat Ave have done. I had informed the undertaker that we meant to attend, and had desired him to provide a proper carriage for us. We entered it at once, Avithout going into the house. There Avas one other mourning coach at the door, and after a delay of some ten minutes or so tAvo persons got into it, whom we afterwards found out to be the medical man and an attorney of the name of Saa*ril The procession then set off for Kensal Green and, as soon as the ceremony Avas over, Mr"], [185, "177 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Swan proposed to us to return to the house to hear the will read, which we declined, being already acquainted with its contents. I must not forget to tell you that Marston has ordered a stone to be put up over the grave.\" \" Oh, thank you,\" said Susan, turning to Sir Hubert. \" It is the very thing I should have wished. But did you see nothing of Mrs Ashford, or my sister ? \" \"I think I caught a glimpse of her behind the blind, Avith the child in her arms. And now for your own business, Susan. The lady Avith whom Ave propose to place you is the widow of a clergyman, of very small means, living at Acton. She will take you for sixty pounds a year, instruction included. She is perfectly competent to finish your education, having lived for many years as governess in Lord A.'s family. Marston, who is acquainted AAith them, has made the necessary inquiries, and the answers have been most satisfactory. Her name is Tinclal ; she is about fifty, ap parently good-tempered, and decidedly lady like. She is coming to dine here to-morroAV, that you may see hoAv you like each other. VOL. I. 12"], [186, "178 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. She knows nothing of your history, except that you have just lost your father, and that, owing to the early death of your mother, your education has been much neglected. If you take my advice, you Avill keep all further de tails to yourself.\" \" How can I ever sIioav my gratitude to both of you,\" said Susan, \" for all the trouble you have taken for me ? \" \" By making the best use of the opportuni ties now afforded you,\" was Digby's reply. \" By the time you are qualified for it, I have no doubt that we shall find some situation to suit you. But always bear in mind that your future fate depends entirely upon yourself.\" He meant to be kind, but there was some thing so dogmatical in his tone and manner that Susan involuntarily turned towards Sir Hubert. \" My dear Miss Ashford,\" said the latter, \" Ave have mentioned the profession of a governess to you, as being the one most desir able for you, but that is, of course, an open question. Should you feel any repugnance to it when the time comes for making a choice,"], [187, "179 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. we must endeavour to find out something else.\" \" If Susan has the sense 1 give her credit for,\" observed Digby, \" she will make no dif ficulties about it. It will be by far the best thing for her. And noAV to go to another sub ject. From Avhat my father-in-law tells me, I believe you and your brother will have about eighty pounds a year each. Of this, thirty will be allowed you for your OAvn expenses, and the remainder will be put by, to form a small fund in case of any unforeseen emergency.\" \"But how is Mrs Tindal to be paid ?\" asked Susan. Sir Hubert was preparing an elaborate ha rangue, but his friend interrupted him. \" With regard to that, Marston, who is un der such deep obligations to your brother, wishes to take it upon himself.\" \" Oh, no ! \" exclaimed Susan, \" that must not \u2014 cannot be. It must be paid out of my income ; the rest Avill be quite as much as I shall require.\" \" Would you really be so cruel, Miss Ash ford,\" said Marston, \" as to deprive me of the gratification of doing this very trifling ser-"], [188, "180 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Aice to the sister of one of my best friends ? \" \" Do not press it, Sir Hubert, I entreat of you. The services you have already rendered me I can never forget \u2014 never repay. But this is different. It Avould humiliate me, it would loAver me in my self-respect, to alloAv another to pay money for me, when I am able to do it myself.\" \" So proud, Miss Ashford ?\" \" Oh, no ! it is not pride. AVhat have I to do with pride ? Am I not right, Lucy ? \" \" Quite right, dearest Susan,\" replied Mrs Digby, avIio had taken no part in the discus sion, although not a Avord of it had escaped her. \" Quite right ; and I told John last night Avhat your decision would be.\" \" She did, indeed, Susan,\" said Digby, \" and though, in my opinion, you carry your scruples too far, I must honestly confess that I think all the better of you for them.\" And this avowal, be it observed, did him great credit, for he saw witli uneasiness everything that might tend to exalt Susan in his friend's eyes. \" Well,\" said Marston, \" as you all seem to be against me, I suppose I must give in, but"], [189, "181 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. I am not the less mortified, I assure you. It looks almost as if Miss Ashford Avished to repudiate my friendship.\" \" Oh, indeed, Sir Hubert, you must not think that,\" began Susan ; but Lucy inter rupted her. \" I really think you do deserve some com pensation, so Ave will allow you to name a day for exhibiting your museum to us.\" \" Will to-morroAV suit you, Mrs Digby ?\" \" Ask John. All days are alike to us.\" \" Oh, you do not want me,\" said Digby. You and Susan can take care of each other.\" \" No, no, John ; I do not choose to trust myself without your protection in the clen of a lion-hunter. He might take a fancy to shut us up in a glass-case.\" So John was forced into a reluctant consent. The invitation for the folloAving day Avas ac cepted ; and as Digby saw no present signs of his friend falling in love Avith his Avard, he gradually resumed his amenity, and made himself more agreeable than he had done for some days past. He even made Susan some sort of apology for the coldness of manner"], [190, "182 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. which, he was conscious, she must have per ceived in his bearing toAvards her latterly. \" Noav, Susan,\" he said, \" that all our busi ness is transacted, you must no longer look upon me as a mere lawyer, but as a cousin, Avho is delighted to have vou under his roof, and AA'ho will be glad at all times to be of service to you.\" \" Exactly,\" said Marston, laughing. \" Dig by, representing his father, is to be the indul gent guardian, and I am to be the severe one. So I hope, Miss Ashford, you are prepared to stand in profound awe of me.\" But Miss Ashford was not in a jocular mood. If she did not precisely stand in awe of Sir Hubert, .she had a morbid fear of doing or saying anything that could excite his dis approbation. Her feelings for him bordered on veneration, and were far too sacred to jest with. When alone with Lucy, although still shy and reserved at times, she had plenty to say for herself when the mood was on her ; but in Marston's presence she was tongue-tied. On the present occasion she could only repeat that she could never forget the kindness of both."], [191, "183 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. The visit to Sir Hubert's lodgings was a very successful one. He gave them a capital luncheon, and had really many curious things to exhibit. To most of them there was some story attached, to Avhich Susan, at least, list ened with breathless interest. When they departed, Mrs Digby carried off her lion-skin in triumph, and a muff was promised her cousin as soon as it could be made up. Digby's protection being no longer needed, he remained behind with his friend, while his Avife an nounced [her intention of performing her pro mise to Mrs Wickham, by taking Susan to see her. As soon as the ladies had left them, Digby asked Sir Hubert what his plans were, and when he thought of leaving town. \" I think of going the day after to-morrow. I suppose we have now settled everything that relates to Miss Ashford, and I am anxious to be at home, that I may get through all I have to do there, so as to return here as soon after Easter as possible. I have asked my sister to meet me there with all her children. Will you join us ? \u2014 with Mrs Digby of course.\""], [192, "184 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" We could not manage it conveniently just now. By-the-by, I forgot to mention to you that I received this morning a letter from Lady Marston's solicitor. She has left her father's, and has taken a small house some where on the south coast. But the most curious part of his communication, and which most concerns you is, that she declines, Avith her most grateful thanks, the addition you proposed to make to her income. She says that the provision made for her is amply suf ficient for her Avants.\" \" Poor Caroline ! \" said Marston. \" What have not her father and mother to ansAver for ! \" Digby, who seemed to consider himself as the attorney for his friend's heart as well as for his property, did not much admire this ex pression of lingering regret. \" At all events,\" he remarked, \" as she has raised up such an insuperable barrier between you, it must be some comfort to you to knoAv that you will not have her as a near neighbour at Thorn wood.\" \" No doubt ; but her disinterestedness now"], [193, "185 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. confirms me in the suspicion I have always had, that her marriage Avas forced upon her.\" \" Perhaps ; but in these clays a Avoman can ahvays say No, if she is so minded. Of course you dine with us to-day ? \" \" No, I think not ; I should be in the Avay, probably. The fewer people present, the more easily will Miss Ashford and Mrs Tinclal make acquaintance. I Avill call in the course of the morning to-morrow, to know how it goes off, and ask you for a dinner afterwards, \u2014 my last in London for some Aveeks.\" When Marston paid his promised visit, he had the pleasure of hearing from Lucy that Mrs Tindal had Avon golden opinions from them all, and that she and her future pupil were mutually pleased with each other. But,\" she continued, \" it is but fair that Susan should tell her own story. I am going up-stairs, and Avill send her doAvn to you.\" Miss Ashford fully corroborated all that Mrs Digby had said, and expressed, in very proper terms, the satisfaction she felt at the prospect before her, promising to use her ut most endeavours to prove that the kindness of"], [194, "186 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. her friends was not thrown aAvay. It was a little set speech, upon which she had expended infinite pains ; but she was far from satisfied AA'ith it. There was so much more she could have said, had she only knoAvn how, but her courage and her poAvers of speech failed her at her need. Her last words were rather mur mured than spoken. To relieve her from her embarrassment, which he could not help remarking, Sir Hu bert said, \" Pray, Miss Ashford, never speak of Avhat we have done for you in such exag gerated terms again. It has been but a sim ple act of duty on the part of us all. Mrs Digby, and consequently her husband, are your near relations, and I am your brother's SAvorn friend ; so you see you had every claim upon us.\" Then, to change the subject, he continued, \" Has Digby told you that I leave toAvn to-morrow ? \" \" Yes, he mentioned it last night. Will it be for long, Sir Hubert ? \" \" Six weeks, or two months at most. But I hope when you are settled at Mrs Tindal's"], [195, "187 SIR HUBERT MARSTCN. you Avill Avrite to me, to tell me how you like it. I Avill leave you my address.\" Willingly she promised. It was a boon she Avould have solicited on her knees. \" And now tell me, Miss Ashford, as this is, in all probability, the last time I shall see you alone before my departure, is there anything else you Avish to say to me; anything I can do for you ? \" \" Oh ! nothing. You have already done too much. But do you really think, Sir Hubert, I shall ever be able to instruct others ? \" \"I have not a doubt of it. But, between ourselves, I think, before you come to any de cision on that head, you ought to consult your brother. And that puts me in mind, to-mor toav is post-day. I have written him a long despatch, and if you will have a letter ready for him this evening it shall go Avith mine. And noAV I must be off; but one more word before I go. If it ever should happen that you are in any trouble or difficulty, if ever you Avant the advice or assistance of a friend, you will apply to me. Promise me, Susan.\""], [196, "188 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. At the sound of her name, her heart swelled almost to suffocation. She could only falter out her thanks. It was the first time he had ever called her Susan, and the sound vibrated in her ears long after he had left the house. The dinner Avas not a gay one. Digby Avas sorry to lose his friend, yet glad he was going \u25a0 Lucy regretted the interruption of her plans, and was speculating upon what might occur on his return ; Susan was buried in her own thoughts. Sir Hubert was the most cheerful of the party, yet he, too, felt that he Avas leav ing friends not easily replaced. The adieus Avere at length said, the letter to Harry Ash ford delivered ; but it was past midnight when, after many false starts, Marston finally took his departure."], [197, "189 CHAPTER IX. The sister whom Marston had mentioned, as having been asked to meet him at Thorn- Avood Priory, was Lady Deptford, his half-sister, the daughter of his father by his first wife. She Avas now a AvidoAV, and many years older than her brother ; her eldest son, Lord Deptford, being twenty years of age, and a lieutenant in a cavalry regiment. She had moreover another son, Charles Wilmington, a boy at school, and three daughters, Cecilia, Mary, and Edith. During the sort of schism between her two brothers, occasioned by Sir Charles's marriage, being a Avoman endowed with more than an average share of wordly Avis dom, and with a very small jointure, she had firmly stuck by the head of the house. Charles"], [198, "190 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. was in a position to marry anybody he liked ; in Hubert it Avould have been an act of down right madness to marry a girl without a shil ling. In fact, he ought to have been grateful to his brother for having removed temptation out of his reach. But now the case was altered. Le roi est mort, vive le rot ! tlubert Avas now Sir Hubert, master of ThornAVOod and twelve thousand a-year. Should he die without children, Avhat so natural or proper as that he should leave it to hers ! Perhaps her thoughts did not go quite so far as this ; but at all events, as long as he remained unmarried \u2014 and that in bachelor independence he might long con tinue, she devoutly hoped \u2014 she had no objec tion to do the honours of his house for him. She had therefore accepted, with infinite satis faction, her brother's overtures, andwas already established at the Priory with all her family, except her youngest son, Avhen he arrived. Sir Hubert had hardly expected such a sudden move, and was not altogether pleased at find ing his house so completely taken possession of, before he had set foot in it himself; but the invasion Avas a fait accompli, and there was"], [199, "191 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. nothing for it but to make the best of it. It Avas however one of the principal reasons which induced him to hurry his departure from London. He Avas quite alive to the peculiari ties of his sister's character. He had been much hurt by her conduct previous to his expatriation, at a time Avhen he stood most in need of kindness and sympathy ; and though on his return he wished to bury in oblivion every trace of family feuds, her avowed parti sanship Avith his elder brother had made on him a very painful and lasting impression. Of her children he knew little or nothing. When he left England, Lord Deptford Avas at Eton\" and the others in the school-room. On arriving at the station nearest to Thorn wood, Sir Hubert got out, and Avas occupied in looking after his luggage, Avhen he Avas accosted by a young man nearly as tall as himself, though much more slightly built, his handsome features beaming Avith good-nature, and bearing a very strong family resemblance to the Marstons. \" I am sure you must be Sir Hubert Mars ton,\" said the new-comer."], [200, "192 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Well, I believe I am. And you ?\" \" I am your nephew Deptford, come, as in duty bound, to see you safe out of the hands of the Philistines.\" \" My clear Deptford, I am delighted to see you, though I certainly should not have recog nized you. I had no idea you were at Thorn- AATood.\" \" I came the day after my mother. She thought you would like to see all the members of your family around you on your arrival.\" \" She thought quite right. But there is my servant Avith a fly. Shall I take you home, or have you any conveyance of your own ? \" \" To tell you the truth,\" replied Lord Dept ford, \" I drove your OAvn drag over here. I took it into my head that perhaps you would like it better than being shut up in an old rattletrap of a fly.\" He said it rather hesitat ingly, for he had had a discussion on the sub ject with his mother in the morning. On his arrival at Thormvood he had at once assumed the direction of the stables, for Avhich, to do him justice, no one, of his years at least, was better qualified. When he announced at"], [201, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 193 breakfast his intention of driving to the station with the four sleek animals Avhich, till he took them in hand, had been enjoying for some months perfect immunity from work, Lady Deptford ventured upon a mild remonstrance. Of all her family, her eldest-born was the only one whose displeasure she deprecated, but on the present occasion she thought it her duty to suggest that perhaps Sir Hubert would not admire such a free and easy way of his making himself at home. \" He used to be rather particular,\" she said. \" Oh ! it is to be hoped,\" he replied in his usual light, off-hand manner, \" that he has left all his bad habits behind him at the Cape. Depend upon it, one ought always to begin by putting people on the footing on which one intends them to remain, and I intend him to be the most obedient and submissive of uncles.\" Brave Avords ! But it struck him now that his mother might be right after all. He was speedily reassured. Marston said he should greatly prefer the box-seat to the inside of a fly, rattletrap, or not ; and thanked A'OL. I. 13"], [202, "194 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. him for having thought of it. His servant Avould folloAv them with the luggage. \"Then we had best be off,\" said Lord Deptford, \" for the infernal train was half an hour late, as usual. Will you drive, or shall I ?\" \"Oh, you, by all means. I am afraid I have forgot all my coaching lore.\" \" He's a brick, and no mistake,\" said his lordship to himself as he mounted the box, enchanted Avith this concession. As soon as they Avere fairly under Avay, Sir Hubert remarked that they seemed a nicish team. \" I did not even knoAv I had such horses in my stable.\" Lord Deptford was now in his element. \" Oh, they are not bad ones,\" he said, at the same time favouring the near leader with a smartish touch under the bars, which made him lash out. \" The horses are not bad, but I am afraid old Philpotts is getting past his AA'ork. He has not the slightest idea of putting four horses\" together properly. I Avas obliged to shoAv him everything. Fancy his wanting to put that off-leader at wheel. Perfectly ab surd! They are pretty handy now. I have"], [203, "195 SIR HUBERT MARSTO\"N. -given them an airing nearly every day since I have been here, and I think they'll do. As for Philpotts, he is a good old felloAv as ever lived, and has been in your family, he told me, since he was a lad, but he is decidedly too slow for the present day. It would break the poor old man's heart if he were to be set on one side, but I think, if I Avere you, I Avould look out for some smart, active man to be under him, for all the stable-people of course take their cue from their chief, They want some one to brighten them up a little.\" He stopped for Avant of breath, rather than lack of matter. . \" What has become of my poor brother's hunters?\" Sir Hubert asked. \"I was just coming to them,\" said Lord Deptford, eagerly. \" There are eight in the stable ; first-rate nags every one of them , though hardly up to your weight, and in no condition. You know horses are never the better for Avant of work, and as I am a light weight, I thought you would like me to give them a bit of a gallop now and then. Well, the day before yesterday, we had a fastish"], [204, "196 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. thing from HolyAvell Wood, and I give you my word of honour, Captain, the horse I rode, was fairly blown in the first twelve minutes, and wound up by giving me an awful purl over a gate into a road. I confess that, when I came home Avith all my bones aching, I felt uncom monly savage, but poor old Philpotts showed such real sorrow for my mishap, and made such tender inquiries into the state of my limbs, that I had not the courage to say any thing to vex him.\" \" Well, Ave Avill look the stable well over to morrow,\" said Marston. He had not time to utter more, for by this time they had arrived, and Lady Deptford, with her daughters, Avas standing in the hall to greet the new-comer. Sir Hubert embraced his sister with great cordiality, and then turned to his nieces. He took up the youngest in his arms, and kissed her. \" I know you must be Edith,\" he said ; \"but Avhich is Cecilia and which is Mary is more than I can tell.\" \" I am Cecilia, uncle,\" said Miss Wilming ton, \" and this is Mary.\""], [205, "197 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" No wonder you Avere puzzled, Hubert,\" said his sister, leading the way to the draw ing-room. \" It is so long since you saw them last. I hope you approve of them ? \" They were a remarkably good-looking fam ily. Lady Deptford herself had been distin guished for her beauty, and Avas still a hand some woman. Her three daughters took after her, though in different degrees. Marston looked from one to the other. \" I must indeed be hard to please,\" he said, \"if I did not.\" \" Tant mieux,\" she replied. \" And now you had better go and dress, for I suspect din ner is almost ready.\" The evening passed pleasantly aAvay. Mar ston had been so long estranged from his nearest relations, that it gave him a new sen sation of happiness to find himself once more in the midst of them. His affection for his sister was not of a very fervent nature, but the sight of her brought back the recollection of old times, Avhen their father and brother Avere still alive, and he the spoilt child, probably because the scape-grace, of the family. His"], [206, "198 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. nieces seemed to be amiable, unaffected girls, though rather shy in the presence of the hand some uncle between whom and themselves so slight a difference of years existed. Edith, the youngest, Avho had not yet numbered tAvelve summers, by virtue of her age took her uncle under her especial protection, and established herself comfortably by his side on the sofa. \" And AA*hy did not you honour us with your company at dinner, Pussy ? \" said Marston, stroking her long fair hair. \" Oh, Edith dined with her governess, Miss Smithson, at tAvo o'clock,\" her mother replied. \" Yes, but, Uncle Hubert, to-day was the first time. Till you came, I always dined down-stairs.\" \" And AA-hat has my coming to do Avith it ? \" \" Mamma thought I Avas not old enough to dine in company.\" \" In company ! My dear Emily,\" said Mar ston, turning to his sister, \" I protest against being considered company. I hope you will allow Edith and Miss Smithson to dine with us to-morroAv.\""], [207, "199 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. This request met Avith a gracious acquies cence on the part of Lady Deptford, to the young lady's intense delight. \" Deptford, Deptford,\" she cried, \" I am to dine down-stairs every day at seven o'clock.\" But Lord Deptford was too busily employed to heed her. He was in deep consultation Avith his two eldest sisters, and presently, lead ing one of them in either hand, he crossed the room to Avhere Marston was sitting, and made him a profound bow. \" Sir Hubert Marston,\" he said, \"the Hon ourable Cecilia Wilmington, the Honourable Mary Wilmington, and my unworthy self, James, Baron Deptford, are in a state of the greatest embarrassment, from which you alone can relieve us. We wish to know what we are to call you. Sir Hubert sounds very for mal, while, on the other hand, in my eyes you are infinitely too young, and in the eyes of these young ladies infinitely too good-looking, to come up to our pre-conceived notions of that venerable relative commonly known as an uncle.\" \" Drop the Sir and Uncle too, and call me"], [208, "200 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Hubert, if you like,\" replied Marston, laughing. \" And may I call you Hubert ? \" asked Miss Edith. \" Yes, you and your sisters too ; but I shall expect a kiss from each of you.\" \"By-the-by,\" said Lord Deptford, \"the hounds meet at the third milestone to-morroAV. Do you think of going out with them ? \" This was a leading question of the noble lord's on a subject about which he felt a little anxious. He had a capital stud of his OAvn in Leicestershire, but the winter had been very mild and open, and, as his horses required rest, he had brought none of them to Thorn wood. Consequently, he was entirely at his uncle's mercy as regarded the most serious occupation of his life, and he wished to know at once what he had to expect. He Avas not long kept in suspense. \" No, I shall not go out this year,\" Marston replied, \" so I must confide the honour of the family in the hunting-field to your keeping What horses are there in the stable ? \" \" There are the four carriage-horses, eight hunters, and two or three capital hacks.\""], [209, "201 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. :' Well, I place the hunters at your disposal as long as you remain here ; and that, I hope, will be as long as I stay myself.\" Lord Deptford was profuse in his acknow ledgments, and promised to ride Avith unusual care. But Edith interrupted him. \" And do you know, Hubert,\" she said, losing no time in availing herself of the privi lege just conceded to her, \" there is such a beautiful lady's horse amongst them. Coach man said it was the one that Aunt Caroline used to ride.\" Lady Deptford and her two eldest daugh ters, Avho Avere in the secret, could not help giving a hasty look at Marston, avIio coloured a little, as he said, \" Why, Iioav come you to knoAv so much about the horses ? \" \" Oh, Deptford often takes me to the stables Avhen he goes himself.\" After tea, Miss Edith Avas dismissed to bed, and her mother secured Marston to her self on the sofa. \" I am not sorry,\" she began, with a little embarrassment, \"for that silly girl's observa-"], [210, "202 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. tion, as it has served to break the ice on a subject on which I wished to speak to you. Lady Marston is not now at her fa ther's.\" Sir Hubert intimated that he was aware of the fact. \" You see,\" she continued, \" during our poor brother's lifetime, attached as I was to him, I Avas obliged to see a good deal of her, though I always felt indignant at her heart less conduct to you. HoAvever, that is all over now. We are not likely to see much of each other in future, and, if Ave do meet, it will, of course, be only as common acquaint ance. But I own I am in a little difficulty about the Woods. They were naturally here a great deal, and somehoAv a sort of intimacy sprung up between Mrs Wood and myself. Poor Charles was so anxious that I should be civil to them, that it was impossible to avoid it altogether. Now, as soon as she heard that I was here, Mrs Wood called on me and, to my great annoyance, Avas admitted before I had time to say ' Not at home.' What ought I to do? \u2014 to return her visit or not? Or"], [211, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 203 rather say Avhat you Avish me to do. I will be guided entirely by your wishes.\" \" My dear Emily,\" replied her brother, \" I have 110 wish on the subject, either one way or the other. If you ask my advice, it is, not to act with marked incivility towards a person with Avhom you Avere on terms of intimacy a few months ago. Mrs Wood is now, I pre sume, precisely what she was this time last year \u2014 neither better nor worse; and, there fore, you can have no reason for dropping her acquaintance.\" \" Well, then, as that is your opinion, and you seem to wish it \" \" Stop, Emily ; I thought I had explained to you that I had no wish on the subject. Pray do not drag me into the question. You ask my opinion, and I give it ; but personally, I do not care two straws whether you return Mrs Wood's visit or not. Unless, indeed, you could find or make occasion to say that I have no intention of renewing my acquaintance AAith them.\" And here the discussion closed, Lady Dept ford mentally resolving that this return visit"], [212, "204 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. should be the last ; but, as she made it a point of conscience to escape all enmities and quarrels, she determined to let it ooze out that she had to choose between her brother and her friend. The folloAving days Marston devoted entirely to matters of business, Avhich fully occupied his time, for his brother's indolent and pro crastinating habits had allowed everything connected with the property to get into great confusion. He and his nephew were on the best possible terms, though they saAV little of each other during the day, but they all met at dinner ; the evenings were passed agreeably together, and by degrees Marston became greatly interested in the relations with whom he had become so recently acquainted. On his nieces their mother's Avorldly feelings had as yet apparently produced no injurious effect, and in hisnepheAvhe could discern an amount of good sense and good feeling which seemed to promise that, in judicious hands, he might turn out something better than a mere man of the Avorld. At present he appeared to be en tirely devoted to field-sports, but his perform-"], [213, "205 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. ances in the hunting-field Avere brought to a premature close, for that season at least. One afternoon, a fly drove up to the door, from which Lord Deptford emerged, covered with mud, and looking rather paler than usual. He Avent straight to his uncle's study. \" Was that you, Deptford,\" said the latter, \" AA*ho drove up to the door just iioav ? \" \" Yes. We have had a stiffish thing of it. Ladybird was quite done up, so I left her be hind, and came home on Avheels. But I am going to ask a great favour of you. I want you to sell her to me. She can never carry your Aveight.\" \" Oh, nonsense about selling. If you like her, keep her.\" \" A thousand thanks, but that Avould be too much like asking for her.\" \" Well, and why should you not ? Uncles are not good for much else.\" \"Yes, you are,\" replied Lord Deptford, taking his hand and pressing it with unusual warmth. \" But if you really wish to oblige me, you will sell her to me. Will you take a hundred and fifty for her? \""], [214, "206 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" A hundred and fifty. That is a large sum. Are you sure she is worth it?\" \" You may trust me in horse-flesh, if in no thing else. A horse of that stamp is Avorth double the money in Leicestershire.\" \" Well, be it so, if you wish it. But I do not half like it. It seems such an unnatural proceeding ; really looks as if I were doing you.\" \" Thanks,\" said Lord Deptford, leaving the room, and speedily returning Avith a cheque for the amount. \"And now,\" he continued, \" I must go and get some of this dirt off 33 me. A feAV minutes after his departure, Mr Philpotts requested an audience. On his ad mission, Marston informed him that he had just sold Ladybird to Lord Deptford. \" Sold Ladybird to my lord ! \" exclaimed the groom. \" Yes ; he pressed it so much, that I could not well refuse. But is there anything so ex traordinary in the transaction that you look so astonished ? \" \" Sold Ladybird to my lord ! But haven't"], [215, "207 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. you heard, Sh Hubert ? Did not my lord tell you?\" \" What do you mean ? I have heard no thing,\" said Marston, a little impatiently. \" Why, my lord jumped into an old stone quarry. The mare broke her back, and was obligated to be killed on the spot ; and my lord, he was so terribly shook, that they sent for a fly for him. But he wouldn't let nobody come home with him, for fear of frightening the family. He is a rare-plucked one, and a des perate hard rider, they tell me.\" \" Good heavens ! It is not possible !\" ex claimed Marston. \" He was in this room a minute ago, and here is his cheque for the mare. Where did you hear all this ? \" \" From the driver of the fly that brought him home, Sir Hubert. He saw Ladybird lying dead, and helped my lord into the car riage himself, for he AATas hardly able to stand.\" \" If that is the case, Philpotts, there is no time to be lost. Send off the brougham at once for Dr L., or rather, go yourself. You can tell him what has happened.\""], [216, "208 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. The groom took his departure, and Marston, Avith the cheque in his hand, rushed up to his nepheAv's room, Avhich he entered without the ceremony of knocking. \" My dear felloAV,\" he began, \u2014 but the first sight that caught his eye was Lord Deptford lying senseless on the floor. In great alarm he rang the bell, and, with the assistance of the servant who ansAA^ered it, undressed him and put him to bed. The doctor soon arrived, and pronounced that, though no bones were broken, the whole frame had sustained a se vere shock, and that the greatest care and attention would be required to prevent the most serious consequences. Great was the consternation in the household. Lady Dept ford's agitation at the danger of her favourite child was such, that she was peremptorily re fused permission to enter his room. Her daughters wandered about the house with stealthy steps and Aveeping eyes. The Avhole task of watching over the sufferer fell upon Marston and Miss Smithson, avIio, notwith standing her youth and seeming inexperience, proved herself invaluable as an assistant, which"], [217, "209 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Avas all the more generous on her part, as she fancied, though Avithout reason, that Lord Deptford had more than once amused himself by ridiculing her shyness and retiring man ners. At length all alarming symptoms disap peared. Youth and a strong constitution triumphed, and Lord Deptford was pro nounced to be out of danger. But his con valescence was long, and lasted during the Avhole of the time Avhich his mother remained at Thornwood. Easter came at last, and with it the Avhole party prepared to return to Lon don. Lady Deptford made some faint at tempts to induce her brother to set up his household gods in her house in town, but the proposal met with so little encouragement that it Avas not repeated. With this excep tion she had every reason to be pleased with her visit, and she cordially accepted an invita tion to return with her daughters in the course of the ensuing autumn. Her son, who, on the strength of his accident, had obtained a pro longation of leave, preceded her by a couple of days to London. VOL. I. 14"], [218, "210 CHAPTER X. Sir Hubert Marston's entree en scene on the theatre of society was a brilliant one. While only Captain Marston and a younger son, he had always been popular \u2014 popular Avith men, and popular with his partners ; and if he had not obtained, in the same degree, the good graces of mammas and chaperons, such want of favour might almost be regarded in the light of a tribute to his merits. Now there was no cloud to obscure them. He shone forth in all the lustre of a man of old family Avith a good rent-roll, and Avhat Avas more to the purpose, young, and unmar ried. On his return from ThornAvood, he took a small bachelor's house in Mayfair, Avith a suitable establishment, which promised well"], [219, "211 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. for the favoured few whom he admitted to his intimacy. Not that he had any thoughts of secluding himself from general society. Strange to say, although he had ar rived at the mature age of six-and-twenty, he Avas not yet blase. His youthful attach ment to Caroline Wood, his forced absence in Canada, his emigrant life at the Cape, and, in justice it must be added, his own right feeling, had preserved him from all the coarse excesses of dissipation. His mind re tained much of its joyous, boyish tone ; and his long banishment prepared him to enter upon the pleasures of the world with the zest of a man just emancipated from restraint. Still, he could not forget that he had trusted and been deceived by the Avoman he had loved, by the man who was bound to him by the nearest and dearest ties of relationship, that few had shoAvn any sympathy for him in his affliction ; and that, during his long exile, scarcely one of those Avhom he called his friends had thought it worth his while to inquire after his fate or future prospects. The pre sent change was pleasant, no doubt, but it"], [220, "212 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. was anything but flattering to his self-love- He was not, however, Avithout a strong tinge of philosophy in his composition, and he made up his mind to enjoy the good things of this world, without too close an investigation of the motives of those by whom they were offered. And yet, truth to say, although Marston's inclinations tended strongly that wray, in all probability he Avould not have plunged at once into the vortex of general society, but for the incessant exhortations of one, Avho deservedly had great influence over him. Digby had very ambitious views for his friend. The first and dearest Avish of his heart was to see Marston in Parliament, occupying a promi nent place amongst the leading men of the day ; his next, was to see him married to some woman of high family and great con nections, who might be of use to him in public life. For the attainment of both these ob jects, he thought it most essential that Sir Hubert should mix with the Avorld, and be admitted to the intimacy of those from whom society receives its laws. Although Marston"], [221, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 213 adopted Avith alacrity the means proposed, it Avas different with regard to the ends towards which they were directed, and many Avere the lectures he underwent in consequence. One merit he undoubtedly had \u2014 constancy in his friendships \u2014 which not all the disap- pointments of his early life could shake, Avhen he had reason to believe them Avell bestoAved. Digby was one of the very feAv Avho had stuck to him in the days of his obscurity through good report and ill report. OAving to his re- latively inferior position in society, the attorney could not be of much use in defending his friend against the hundred and one rumours, more or less ill-natured, which were in circu- lation respecting the causes of his leaving the army, and his subsequent emigration. But what he could do he did, and scarcely a mail sailed for the Cape without a letter to his old school-felloAv. Contrasting, as they did, Avith the neglect of others, these acts of kind- ness made a deep impression on Marston's grateful nature. We have seen that his first visit on his return to England had been to Digby, and it is not surprising that many days"], [222, "214 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. did not elapse after his arrival in London, before he again bent his steps to Kensington. He found Mrs Digby alone, as he had ex pected ; Digby, he knew, was in all proba bility at his office, and he had purposely selected this hour, in order to have an unrestrained conversation with his wife, as he took care to inform her after his first greeting. \" For,\" said he, \" I Avant to knoAv all about Susan, and I do not think John is quite such an admirer of her as you are.\" \" I do not know about admiration,\" she re plied, \" but I think he does her justice now. The fact is, he was half afraid that I should Avish to keep her here as a permanent guest ; and as he professes to like my society tete-a tete better than any other, I suppose I must not be angry with him for being rather cold in his manner to Susan.

You shall judge for yourself when you see her.\" \" Because,\" he continued, \" I confess I have been rather disappointed by the two or three letters I have received from her. The hand writing, no doubt, is much improved, and the orthography faultless, but the contents were exceedingly common-place. In short, they Avere much the sort of letters that I can fancy a school-girl of twelve or fourteen would Avrite, under the supervision of her mistress, to some morose old guardian of sixty or seventy. And yet I am sure I wrote to her as I should have Avritten to you, for instance. I told her all I had been about, and I think I even made one or tAvo attempts to be facetious. In vain ! My jokes were throAvn away, and she seemed to take no interest in my proceedings.\" Lucy could not refrain from a smile, though she tried to suppress it, Avhile she replied, \" But you are her guardian, you know ; and I suppose, in the eyes of their Avards, all guardians are sixty or seventy.

I have already observed that, in your presence, she does not do herself justice. She is painfully conscious of the deficiencies of her education, and is perpetually haunted by a fear of exposing herself. She is a singular mix ture of pride and humility.\" \" Well,\" said Marston, \" I think the best thing I can do is to resign my office, for I have no idea of making myself a bugbear to young ladies.\" \" You must do nothing of the sort. You are the only person to whom Susan has to look ; for my poor father is, or thinks himself, too great an invalid to attend to business, and John has no time to spare. I have half a mind,\" she added, after a short pause, \"if I Avere quite sure you would not betray me, to shoAV you a letter she Avrote me not very long ago. It is something better than the letter of a school-girl, twelve years old.\" \" Oh, do.

She Avould never forgive me.\" The required assurance Avas given, and the letter put into Sir Hubert's hands, avIio read it through Avithout observation ; and Mrs Digby remarked, Avith considerable satisfaction, that he seemed to scan the latter part of it Avith peculiar attention. The passage which ex cited his interest was as follows : \u2014 \" I do so Avish, dearest Lucy, you Avere here to help or advise me. I have received such a long, kind letter from Sir Hubert, in ansAver to a few stupid lines I Avrote as soon as I Avas settled here, telling .me all he is doing, and inquiring so anxiously about my comfort, and the progress I am making. I must write to him, and I do not knoAv how. I had written two letters, and tore them up. It seemed such presumption in a girl like me to Avrite to a man like him, as if I thought myself his equal.

Oh, Lucy, if he should think me ungrateful ! \" \"Yes,\" he said, returning the letter, \" that is indeed different from the epistles with which she is in the habit of favouring me. A clever, sensible, affectionate letter. No danger of my thinking her ungrateful ; but I wish she Avould get rid of that constraint which she feels in her intercourse with me. Do tell her I am not the monster of perfection she seems to imagine. Does she treat Digby in the same manner ? \" \" No, indeed ; very far from it.

I wonder what John Avould think, or, rather, what all my friends and acquaintance would think and say, if they heard that I had been driving with you all over the country.\" \" I suppose you are right ; but what absurd nonsense all this formality of civilization is,\" exclaimed Marston. \" I shall begin to Avish Ave were all safe amongst my friends the Caffres.\" \" For my part,\" replied Mrs Digby, \" I prefer Kensington, with all its drawbacks."], [228, "220 SIR HUBERT MARSTON.

After a short greeting, they rang, and Avere admitted. The maid aat1io let them in appeared to knoAv Mrs Digby well, as the latter dismissed her, telling her that they could find their way Avithout her assistance.

Mrs Digby stopped short, and put a finger on her lips as a sign to her companion. \" Dear Mrs Tindal,\" said a youthful voice, which Sir Hubert recognized, \" how I am trying your patience and good-nature, but I know I can do it, and I Avill do it.\" \" My dear Susan,\" replied the person ad dressed, \"you had better give it up for to-day.

That her features were beautifully formed he had discovered Avhen she lay in his arms on the night of their first meeting, but there Avas now an air of intel lectual refinement thrown over them, which forced him to confess to himself that he had rarely, if ever, seen a more lovely or attractive being. When last they met, he had addressed her with something of the familiarity of a pro tector ; now he approached her with a degree of deference and respect almost incompatible Avith their relative positions. If his intention was to put her at her ease, it had not the de sired effect. Taking her hand, which was as cold as ice, and pressing it Avarmly, he said, \" My dear Miss Ashford, I am delighted to see you again. I need not ask if you are Avell and happy in your present abode.\" Susan made some unintelligible reply. \" I only regret,\" he continued, \" that we did not arrive a little earlier, before your singing lesson was over.

Fortunately he hit upon the only topic sufficiently interesting to lure her out of her reserve. \" I expect,\" he said, \" by the next mail to hear from your brother Harry, and no doubt you will receive a letter too. I enclosed him yours.\" \" Oh, Sir Hubert, and I never thanked you for your kindness. Dear Harry ! So many years have passed, and so much has happened !

Marston looked up, and saw a hen scratch ing and dusting herself in a sunny ' corner, more carefully tended and better raked than the rest. Susan ran off in pursuit of the aggressor, and Marston after her. \" Oh, is it not provoking? \" she said. \" Yes, very,\" he replied, as he gazed at the disorder produced in the trim flower-bed ; \" but a gardener will put it all to rights in a few minutes.\" \" Oh, no, he can't ! You must know,\" she continued, with increasing confidence in his sympathy, \" that dear Mrs Tindal has given me this bit, from here to here, to be my own garden, and I take so much pains to keep it in order.

Sir Hu bert offered his arm, which she accepted Avith a blush, hardly venturing to rest the tips of her fingers on the sleeve of his coat. The gardener's house Avas soon reached, and a net of ample dimensions purchased. \" I think, Miss Ashford,\" said Marston, \" you must give me a share in your garden, and allow me to contribute to its beauty."], [235, "227 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Let us see if we can find anything here to suit us. Are you fond of roses ?. After alb there is nothing to beat a good, old, vulgar cabbage-rose.\" Yes, Susan quite agreed Avith him. There certainly Avas nothing so sweet or so beautiful as a cabbage-rose. Had he expressed a pre dilection for a hollyhock, it Avould have been the same. Half-a-dozen plants of different sorts were selected, and intrusted to the care of a boy, who accompanied them to Mrs Tin \u25a0dal's. \" Are you fond of a garden, Sir Hubert? \" Susan ventured to ask. \" Very ; and I flatter myself I am a pretty good gardener. I have rather a fine garden at Thornwood, which I hope to show you, if Ave can persuade Digby to pay me a visit during the long vacation.\" Susan could find no words to thank him. An involuntary and almost imperceptible pres sure of his arm, no sooner made than repented of, alone spoke her gratitude. By this time they had reached the cottage. The boy Avas dismissed, and Marston announced his inten-"], [236, "228 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. tion of planting the roses at once. Susan brought him a spade, and taking a rake her self, in a short time the flower-bed Avas re duced to order. \" And now, Miss Susan,\" said Sir Hubert, holding up his hands all stained with mould, \" you must show me where I can get a little water.\" \" Come with me to the kitchen window, and I will ask Jane to give you some water and a toAvel, \u2014 unless indeed you had rather go into the house.\" But Marston was quite satisfied Avith per forming his ablutions outside, and Susan showed him the Avay. Jane placed on the window sill a basin of warm water, Avith soap and towel, while Susan held a jug of cold water, in case it should be needed, looking on with eyes of eager curiosity, as he deliberately drew off his signet-ring and turned up his cuffs. Her demure look, as she watched his proceedings, amused him so much that he could not refrain from filliping a few drops of Avater into her face ; but he Avas not a little astounded by the consequences of this aggression. In a moment"], [237, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. her eyes lighted up ; the little shy spirit who had so long established his domicile in her bosom, and Avho no doubt had groAvn negli gent in fancied security, Avas expelled from his seat by the demon of fun and mischief, and using her hand scoop-Avise, she retaliated with such effect that Marston's face Avas deluged. Entering into the contest Avith the zest and spirit of a school-boy, he returned the com pliment ; and in a feAv minutes, amidst peals of laughter, they were both completely drenched ; and only desisted Avhen their stock of ammu nition Avas exhausted. \"Romping !

Guilty, but with des cir con stances attenuantes ! In the mean time, the sounds of this uproar ious mirth had penetrated the draAving-room. \" What on earth are those two about ? \" said Mrs Digby; \" I must go and see, and then I Avill send Sir Hubert to you, as I knoAv he Avishes to speak to you.\" When Lucy made her appearance, she found Susan mopping Marston's coat and Avaistcoat with her pocket handkerchief, alternately exclaiming \u2014 \"Oh, I am so sorry,\" and laughing at the water Avhich Avas still trickling from his whiskers. Marston's explanation Avas ex tremely simple, though hardly in conformity Avith the known laws of hydrostatics. \" I dirtied my hands gardening, and Avhen Susan procured some water for me to wash them, somehow or other it fleAv up in out faces.\" Mrs Digby marked Avith pleasure the fami liar appellation, and turning to Susan, noted her flushed cheeks \u2014 the smile on her lips \u2014 the"], [239, "231 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. merry twinkle in her eye. Satisfied Avith the good understanding evidently prevailing be tween the two, she sent off Sir Hubert to Mrs Tindal, and accompanied Susan to her own room, fully determined to extract from her all the particulars of her tete-a-tete. Marston's manner to the old was particu larly ingratiating, and he soon succeeded in establishing himself in Mrs Tindal's favour. He thanked her, and complimented her in the most courteous terms on the immense improve ment that had taken place in Miss Ashford's manners and appearance; though, Avhen he mentioned the former, recollecting the scene that had just occurred, he could hardly refrain from smiling. \" I am sure,\" he said, \" she will never for get the obligation she owes you. She names you with respect and affection.\" \"lam sure of it, for she is one of the most grateful and Avarm-hearted girls I ever met.

Had it pleased God to give me a daughter, I could have wished that in most things she had resembled Susan.\" \" And in what would you have Avished her to be different?\" asked Marston. \" Susan has her defects. Perhaps I see them all the more clearly, that I feel a sincere attachment for her, and cannot but fear that, if she does not check them in time, they will mar her happiness. She is self-Avilled and passion ate, and though her outbursts are soon over, and she is full of repentance, acknowledging her faults with the utmost candour and humil ity, I cannot see that she makes much effort to correct them. This, in all probability, is the effect of Avant of proper training as a child. The other defect I have noticed is, that Avith the most affectionate heart she is intensely jealous.\" \" Jealous ! Why, what cause for jealousy can she find here ?\" \" None, of course, Sir Hubert, in the sense you mean, but a jealous disposition betrays itself in very insignificant actions. I had a little niece staying with me for a few days,"], [241, "233 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. and though she was kindness itself to the child Avhile it remained here, and really devoted herself to its amusement, I could see that she did not half like my making much of it, and that it Avas a relief to her Avhen Mary Avent aAvay. Why, I have seen her colour Avith vexation if the cat jumps on my lap Avhen she is in the room.\" \" Well,\" said Sir Hubert, laughing, \" let us hope that her husband, when she has one, will give her no cause for jealousy.\" \" Ah, you treat it as a laughing matter, but I cannot. I look upon it as a great misfortune. And now, Sir Hubert,\" continued Mrs Tindal, more cheerfully, \" I have told you the worst, indeed all I know to her disadvantage, and believe me she has many excellent, I may say great, qualities to counterbalance them. She is utterly unselfish \u2014 never so happy as when rendering a service \u2014 charitable to the poor ; not merely in almsgiving, though in that she is generous beyond her means, but in the real interest and sympathy she sIioavs them in illness or distress.

And yet it is impossible not to love her dearly. I tell you all'this, Sir Hubert, because I know how much she respects and looks up to you, and a Avord from you would do more than a long sermon from me.\" \" Rather a delicate task,\" replied Marston ; \" but I will think it over. In the mean time you will permit me to say that I am convinced that she could not be in better hands than yours. Hoav does she get on in her studies ?\" \" Oh, in that respect, I have nothing to do but to praise. She has great quickness and still greater perseverance. At her age I thought it better to alloAV her to choose her own subjects of instruction. She will be a good linguist, and has a decided talent for music. And if it enters into your views, I should say she ought to have a regular singing master. Her voice is magnificent, though uncultivated, and decidedly worthy of better instruction than I am capable of giving.\" Marston assured her that he Avould attend"], [243, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 235 to her recommendation ; and at that moment Lucy and Susan entered the room. \" Now, Sir Hubert,\" said Mrs Digby, \" if you have finished your confabulation with Mrs Tindal, it is time to depart. I Avant to be at home, and I do not mean to stir till I have seen you safe out of the house.\" \" Pray Mrs Digby, do you exercise this sort of tyranny over John ? \" \" John tyrannizes over me, and I retaliate on his friend, which is but fair play. So pray take your hat and depart. I can see Mrs Tindal and Susan are dying to get rid of you.\" \"Is that really the case?\" asked Marston, addressing Mrs Tindal, but looking at his ward, who smiled and shook her head, blush ing of course as she did so ; Avhile the elder lady hastened to reply, \" Oh no, you could not think me so uncivil.

It sounded like a hint to her that she was not to presume upon the famili arity with Avhich he had treated her Avhen they last met. The flush of pleasure with Avhich she had received her brother's letter faded from her cheeks. She thanked him for the trouble he had taken, but in a tone very dif ferent from that in Avhich she had bade him farewell at Acton. Both he and Mrs Digby noted the change, but the latter alone under stood the cause. \" Come in, Sir Hubert,\" she said, \" if but for five minutes, and tell me what Mr Ashford says. And you, Susan, go up to your room, and read your letter in peace.\" As soon as they Avere alone in the draAAing room, Sir Hubert said, \" What an extraordi nary girl that is.

He looked uneasily at both, but Susan's back Avas turned, and on Marston's countenance he could see nothing but an ex pression of kindly courtesy. He then turned to his wife, but as she had observed his glance at their two visitors, and knew that her turn Avould come, she Avas so busily occupied in adjusting the boAv of her sash, Avhich most perversely would not set right, that he failed to catch her eye. But he thought he detected something like a smile of triumph, which pro voked his wrath, Seizing the bell-rope, and exclaiming, \" Five minutes past seven !

During the repast he gradually recovered his good humour, though he made it a point of conscience, as often as Marston addressed his ward as \" Susan,\" to speak to her immediately afterwards as \" Miss Ash ford,\" a particularity which that young lady did not appear to remark. As soon as he was left alone with Marston, he asked him what he thought of his ward, to Avhich the guardian replied in the innocence of his heart, that he thought her a remarkably attractive and lovable girl. \" I do not mean about her attractions,\" re plied Digby, rather impatiently, \"but about her qualifications as a governess.\" \" That is exactly what I Avant to speak to you about, and is, I suspect, the subject which she alluded to before dinner. Her brother, it appears, has got into high favour with some great man from India, who came to the Cape on sick-leave.

He seems to expect her in about three years, by which time he says he shall have a comfortable home to offer her. I confess I think it a very good plan, and it has certainly taken a great weight off my mind, for, between ourselves, I hardly think the governess-plan would ansAver. I am afraid she has begun learning herself too late in life, to enable her to undertake the education of young ladies in all its branches. Moreover, she is too handsome. Few mothers with sons Avould like to have her as one of their family. And, after all, it is a life of drudgery, of which she has had enough. I think India is the very place for her.

His only regret seems to be, that we could not bring Mrs Ashford to account for her villany without compromising his sister's name.

She did not allude to her intended"], [253, "245 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. translation to India, although she could not contemplate it without a sort of terror ; but it had already been discussed between her and Lucy, avIio advised her to say nothing about it at present. \" Of course, my dear, we shall not let you go,\" said the privy councillor. \" But Ave must not begin by openly opposing your brother's wishes, especially when he has be haved so liberally. Three years is a long time, and there is no saying what may hap pen betAveen this and then. Very likely Harry himself will return and settle in England, or he may marry, and not Avish for you, so think no more about it. ' Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.' \" Somewhat consoled by these suggestions, Susan promised to follow her cousin's advice, and it Avas to a totally different question that she called Sir Hubert's attention. \"It is impossible,\" she said, \"that I can accept Harry's money. I must write and tell him so. After all he has done for me, and Avishes to do for me, I should feel it like robbery.\""], [254, "246 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Sir Hubert assured her that she might set her heart quite at ease. \" Harry, in his letter to me, explains all his affairs, and he can do it without the slightest inconvenience. He has already laid by a small sum, and, as he has no doubt told you, has good prospects before him. But you cannot return it if you would. Harry has legally transferred this sum to your guardians in trust for you, and my learned friend John will tell you that it is out of our poAver to alter the arrangements he has deliberately made.\" Digby confirmed this statement, and the subject dropped. A short silence ensued, Avhich Avas broken by Marston. \" Is John jealous, Mrs Digby ? \" The question Avas so sudden, and so little in accordance Avith her thoughts, that she looked up in astonishment. \" Jealous ! I am sure I don't know. Yes, reasonably so, I suppose.\" \" Well, if he is unreasonably so, tant pis pour lui, for I have a commission to execute from an old admirer of yours. Harry sends cousin Lucy his love, and Avishes to knoAv how"], [255, "247 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. it comes to pass that she forgot her promise of being his little wife ? \" \" Oh, you may tell him that I Avaited for him for many a long year, and finding he did not make his appearance, married John in despair. Remind him, too, that les absens ont toujours tort. Though I do not know that he was much better off Avhen present. Do you re member, Susan, how I used to box his ears?\" \" Yes, poor boy, and how well he used to bear it.\" \" Oh, yes ; you always played peace-maker in our quarrels. Ah me ! how old it makes me to look back to those days. I recollect, as if it was yesterday, your dear mother taking us all to Astley's. Harry fell in love with Columbine, and I Avas so jealous that I would not speak to him for a week.\" \" Upon my word, Mrs Digby,\" said her husband, \"your ancient history seems to have been anything but edifying.\" Lucy told him that he had nothing to do with her ancient history, and Sir Hubert asked Susan if she had often been to the play. \" Only that once, and I was so young I do"], [256, "248 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. not recollect much about it, except that there Avere horses, and an elephant Avhich roared and frightened me.\" \"Now Mrs Digby,\" he said, \"if you and Digby are disposed to be very good-natured and obliging, you Avill alloAV me to take you and Susan to the Opera one night this Aveek.\" \" I should like it of all things. I vow, John, if you make any objection, I will never speak to you again, unless I change my mind.\" But John made no objections, aud it was settled that they should all dine with Marston, and proceed aftenvards to the Opera. Sir Hubert then mentioned, that, at Mrs Tindal's suggestion, he had engaged Signor Doremi, the best singing-master of the day, to give Susan lessons three times a-Aveek ; and having re quested and obtained a private audience of Mrs Digby, he begged that lady to provide a proper evening dress for her cousin. \"You knoAv,\" he said, \" I spoiled one of her two gOAvns, poor girl, and it is but fair that I should make reparation.\" In short, he behaved ex actly as a rich, old guardian ought to do by a young and handsome ward."], [257, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 249 \" A sensible young man Harry Ashford seems to be,\" was Mr Digby's remark to his Avife, Avhen they found themselves alone. \" India is the very place for Susan. With her youth and beauty, she is sure to marry Avell there, and when her manners are a little more formed, she will be quite in her proper place at the head of some rich civilian's establish ment.\" \" Susan Avould be in her proper place at the head of any establishment, rich or poor,\" said Lucy quietly, for, though considerably piqued by her husband's observations, she had no Avish to be drawn into a discussion. She con sidered herself in the position of a general, against Avhom the enemy has made a recon naissance enforce, Avith the view of compelling him to disclose his strength or weakness, and this intention, being a consummate tactician, she took measures to frustrate. \"At all events, my dear,\" replied Digby, \" you may abandon all thoughts of seeing her at the head of Marston's establishment. lie is heartily in favour of this Indian scheme.\" \" Oh, Sir Hubert ! Yes, I do not think he"], [258, "250 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. is a marrying man. I Avas thinking of a much less brilliant lot for Susan, when I said she Avas qualified to be at the head of any estab lishment. Brought up as she has been, and Avith the training she is now going through, she Avould make an excellent clergyman's wife. She is orderly, she is economical, she is affec tionate to those she loves, and her little fortune Avould always help to keep the Avolf from the door. I confess I should greatly prefer seeing her settled in England, even in a humble home, to her going to India, with the chance of filling a brilliant position.\" \" Well, Lucy, I am glad to hear you speak so rationally ; but confess that you did make a little plan in your own head for her exalt ation.\" \" Yes, I did think it Avould be a capital plan for both, as I remember telling you, but Sir Hubert evidently is not in love Avith her, or likely to be. He seems to look upon her as a new sort of plaything. So you may take her into favour as soon as you please, for hitherto you have shown her no -great liking.\" \" My dearest Lucy, do not say that. I do"], [259, "251 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. like her, not only as your cousin, but for herself; but I have no wish to see her Marston's Avife, and, not being quite blind, have endeavoured to foil your little transparent stratagems. And I will also own that I thought she might be the cause of dissension betAveen us. But all that is past. Hubert has no more thought of marrying her than of marrying his sister-in law. Mark my words \u2014 when he does marry, it Avill be for ambition. I give you free leave to do your Avorst.\" Oh, Mr Digby, Avhy could you not leave Avell alone ! \" Thank you for the permission, after hav ing assured me that success is impossible,\" replied Lucy, Avhile something like a smile flitted across her features. But she added to herself, \" No, my dear, good husband, neither Susan, nor anyone else, shall ever be a cause of dissension betAveen us, but I will not sit quiet, and see her made unhappy, if I can help it.\" Sir Hubert had not invited any one to meet them at dinner, but no one seemed to regret the omission. Susan, radiant with pleasure,"], [260, "252 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. present and to come, really looked beautiful. The dress that had been provided for her under her cousin's supervision became her well, and showed off her rather tall and graceful figure to great advantage. At first she Avas reluctant to accept it. \" It is really treating me so much like a child,\" she said; \" and noAV that I have so much money of my own!\" Digby, who chanced to be present at the discussion, cast a look of triumph at his Avife. He quite agreed with Susan, that it Avas treat ing her like a child, and accordingly set to Avork to remove her scruples, by representing that it Avould be very ungracious on her part to refuse what had been expressly provided for her. \" As for your money,\" he added, \" al though your brother wishes you to receive the Avhole of your income, if you take my advice, you will make a point of laying by a part of it. You will find a little nest-egg very useful when you have to fit yourself out for India.\" Susan's countenance fell. India Avas the one bitter drop in the cup of her existence, and it was hard to be reminded of it in the midst of her happy anticipations. But she soon re-"], [261, "253 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. covered herself, Avhen Lucy Avhispered to her, as they were getting into the carriage, \" Never mind India noAV. Plenty of time for that, and, after all, nobody can send you there against your will.\" In accordance with a suggestion of Mrs Digby's, the dinner Avas an early one, that they might not lose a note of the opera, Avhich happened to be Norma. Standing on the landing-place, they found Sir Hubert Avith two magnificent bouquets, Avhich he presented to the tAvo cousins, and then ushered them into the drawing-rooin. \" Oh, what a charming room,\" exclaimed Lucy, rushing about in a sort of ecstasy to examine the various pictures, statuettes, china, and bronzes with Avhich it abounded. For Marston had bought the house Avith all its contents, just as it stood, on the death of its last proprietor, a well-known amateur and collector in the Avorld of virtu. \" What a shame,\" she continued, \" that a bachelor should have such a house as this ; is it not, Susan ? But I think bachelors contrive to monopolize all the good things of this world.\""], [262, "254 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Susan said not a word, but gazed around in a state of bewilderment, occasionally bury ing her face in her flowers. \" One thing at all events they have not, and that the best of all,\" said Digby ; \" they have not Avives, Avithout Avhom no house can feel like home.\" Lucy looked at him in real astonishment and affected alarm ; \" My dear John, are you ill ? I am afraid the atmosphere of the house must have affected your brain. I assure you, Sir Hubert, it is the first pretty thing he has said to me since our honeymoon.\" \" Because, Lucy, you require no pretty things said to you to be assured of my affec tion. But I am perfectly serious in what I said, and I maintain that the one thing want ing in this house is a mistress, and I advise Marston to supply the defect as soon as pos sible.\" \"Thank you,\" said Marston, laughing. \" There is no such desperate hurry.\" Dinner was noAV announced, to the great relief of more than one of the party. It was"], [263, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 255 not unduly prolonged, but to Susan it seemed as if it Avould never end. She Avas in a fever of excitement, and could neither eat, drink, nor speak. At length it was over \u25a0 they all Avent up-stairs together, coffee Avas brought in, and soon after the carriages arrived. But at the last moment \u2014 strange contradiction \u2014 she felt almost umvilling to depart, and Avhen Digby offered her his arm, she cast one longing, lin gering look behind. They arrived just in time. The house Avas already Avell filled, and the curtain was in the act of being drawn up Avhen Sir Hubert's party entered their box. As Susan advanced to the front to take her place, she Avas so much struck by the magnificence of the scene before her \u2014 the size of the house, the splen dour of the decorations, the blaze of lights, so far surpassing anything she had imagined; that she involuntarily shrank back a step, and covered her face Avith her hands. Mrs Digby almost pushed her into her chair, and from that moment she was so completely absorbed by what was passing on the stage, that she"], [264, "256 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. had neither ears nor eyes for anything else, and Marston, to leave her undisturbed, devo ted his Avhole attention to her cousin. When the curtain fell after the first act, he rose, and said he must pay some visits. This was a bitter disappointment to Susan, who was dying to ask him question upon question. She began to examine the inmates of every box with curiosity, and to speculate upon the one in which he Avould first make his appearance. She had not long to wait. Exactly opposite were seated two ladies, evidently mother and daughter, the latter in the first bloom of youth and good-looks. The door of the box opened and Marston entered, both of them extending a hand to him ; and the youngest of the two greeting him with a smile, which to Susan seemed to savour of intimacy, if not familiarity. He ceated himself betAveen them, and after a few Avords to the mother addressed himself exclusively to the daughter. He took her fan and began playing Avith it. He then possessed himself of some flowers she held in her hand, and, after considerable coquetting on her part, prevailed on her to give him a rose, which he"], [265, "257 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. forthwith put in his button-hole. Susan, who had Avatched all these proceedings, and had cor rectly interpreted Avhat to her was but dumb sIioav, felt sick at heart, and letting her own bouquet fall, silently trampled it under her feet. The bell rang, the curtain rose \u2014 but Susan could no longer direct her attention to the stage. What to her were the mimic woes of the British priestess ! In her OAvn bosom she felt them magnified a thousand-fold. Lucy had not been unobservant of the scene enacted opposite to them, and noticing the contraction upon her cousin's brows, pretty well guessed the state of her feelings. At this juncture Marston returned. Determined to know the worst, Mrs Digby attacked him at once. \" What a very pretty girl you have been flirting Avith, Sir Hubert. You seem to be coming out in quite a new character.\" \" Put woman for girl,\" he replied, \" and those are the very words she applied to my very innocent conversation with you. But I am glad you admire her. I am rather proud of her myself.\" VOL. I. 17"], [266, "258 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \"It really seemed to me,\" rejoined Mrs Digby, \" that you were determined to lose no time in acting up to John's advice, and were seriously thinking of turning your house into a home.\" \" How so?\" asked Marston, much amused. \" By asking the lady opposite to take charge of it. If she is as amiable as she is good-look ing, she Avill do credit to your choice. I hope when everything is settled you will let us know in time, that Ave may send our congratulations.\" \" Well, yes, she is as good as she is pretty, and, as you justly observe, that is saying much. Perhaps in the course of time she may take charge of my household, but not exactly in the capacity to which you allude ; for,\" continued he, laughing, \" though Ave returned convicts are a sad demoralized set, Ave do not go the length of marrying our own nieces.\" \" Your niece ! \" \"Yes, those two ladies opposite are my sister, Lady Deptford, and her eldest daughter, Cecilia, who, I am glad to find, has made so favourable an impression on you.\" During the Avhole of this conversation,"], [267, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 259 \"Susan had sat with her eyes resolutely fixed on the 'stage, though she saw and heard no thing that was passing on it, while her ears drank in every syllable that was uttered in the box. At the last words, she gave a little start, fortunately unnoticed by any one, while a burning blush of shame and remorse covered her face and neck. What would she not now have given for the. flowers so hastily trampled under her foot ! In the vain hope of recover ing them, she let her libretto fall, to have an excuse for stooping down ; but Digby, Avho was seated behind her, was too quick for her. He caught it up, and to her great confusion, exclaimed, Avith a handful of rose-leaves in his hand \u2014 \" My dear Susan, you have let your bouquet drop, and I am afraid it is entirely spoiled.\" The tears almost stood in her eyes, as she said, \" Oh, I am so sorry, so very sorry.\" \"Never mind, Susan,\" said her cousin, \" you shall have mine. It Avas too much to expect you to think of flowers at your first opera.\""], [268, "260 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Oh, it was not that,\" replied Susan, \" but'* \u2014 and here she stopped. \" At all events you have the satisfaction of knowing that they would have been dead by to-morroAv morning,\" said Sir Hubert, good naturedly coming to her relief. \" These Covent Garden floAvers never last more than a few hours. I hope our roses will do better.\" \" Oh yes, indeed,\" she exclaimed, her thoughts taking another direction, \" I counted five buds on one of them this morning.\" A little restored in mind, she listened to the rest of the performance with renewed pleasure, and at its conclusion found courage to thank Marston, as he handed her into the carriage, for quite the happiest evening she had ever spent."], [269, "261 CHAPTER XII. It was now the height of the London season, and Sir Hubert was fairly involved in a round of invitations. Although past the age at Avhich the young men of the present day generally abandon the ball-room, the dancing mania was strong upon him still. A few of his for mer partners still remained in the field, and he found no difficulty in filling up the gaps in their ranks which marriage, or other causes, had made, by new acquaintances. He was equally successful in re-establishing his former claims to almost universal popularity, for, in addition to his fortune, his youth, and good looks, he was an agreeable companion, always cheerful and good-humoured, and abounding in the most original ideas. No ball, no break-"], [270, "262 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. fast was complete Avithout him. He possessed, moreover, that dangerous quality of appearing exclusively devoted to any woman whom he might be at the moment addressing, not from any spirit of coquetry, but from a sort of innate deference to the sex of which she formed a part. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, if before the end of July he had been given to half-a-dozen most eligible young ladies in suc cession, to the perpetual discomposure of his sister, and the elation of Digby, Avho contrived , by means best known to himself, to acquire accurate information of his friend's proceed ings, till, as each successive bubble burst, he found the glorious summer of his hopes turned into the winter of disappointment. And yet, though Marston undoubtedly en joyed his successes in society, as who would not, he was obliged to confess that if they gave him pleasure, they were far from giving him happiness. Without acknoAvledging to its full extent the necessity of his immediate marriage, so pertinaciously urged upon him by Digby, he certainly did feel a void in his heart, Avhich the calculating attachment of Lady Deptford"], [271, "263 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. and the more honest and artless affection' of his nieces could not fill. Perhaps, unknoAvn to himself, it was this feeling Avhich made him such a diligent attendant upon scenes in which the noblest and fairest, the youth and beauty of the land, passed, as it were, in re view before him. But if he expected to find amongst them the ideal of perfection which alone could satisfy him, he was disappointed. His standard of female excellence Avas too high, formed upon what he had once imagined Caro line Wood to be. With most men the dreams of boyhood are toned down, or vanish entirely by contact with the world. The angel be comes a woman. But it Avas not so with Marston. The solitary life he had led for so many years \u2014 solitary, at least, as far as re garded interchange of thought \u2014 had left him to brood over his early recollections, and con firmed him in his ideas of impossible feminine perfection. In short, he required too much. Youth, beauty, amiable and attractive man ners, power of intellect, a warm welcome, were all there, but still there was something want ing. What it was he could not tell, but it was"], [272, "264 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. the one thing needful for domestic happiness, and it was generally with a sigh of weariness that he returned to his own house. Notwithstanding his numerous engagements, Sir Hubert always found time to see his friends the Digbys ; and it came at last to be an un derstood thing, that he was ahvays to dine with them on Sunday. At first, Mrs Digby had been kept in a state of perpetual hot water by the various rumours of his being engaged to some Lady Clara, or Miss Laura ; but the frank and open manner in which he laughed them off soon reassured her. \" It is but the penalty one pays for noto riety\" of any sort,\" he said. \" Depend upon it, when anything of this nature is likely to take place, you shall be the first to hear of it. But if it Avere not for the fear of giving John a fit, I would assure you that I do not see the slight est probability of it, at present, at least.\" Susan was generally present on these occa sions ; but the Sunday evenings Avere not the only occasions on which she saAv her guardian. Once, a very severe cold had prevented her coming to Kensington as usual, and the sol-"], [273, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 265 lowing day Marston rode over to Acton to in quire about her. Mrs Tindal Avas delighted to see him. \" I hope, Sir Hubert,\" she said, \" you will give Susan a good scolding. She chose to stand out in the rain one day last Aveek, gardening, and the consequence was, as might have been expected, a cold, and sore throat.\" \" Of course I shall scold her, if it was only for having deprived me of the pleasure of see ing her last night. I assure you, Susan, we all felt quite dull without you.\" \" And then,\" continued Mrs Tindal, \" she has been obliged to suspend her singing les sons. However, the worst is over, and she has permission to go out to-day for an hour.\" \" Well, then, suppose you pass that hour in the garden AATith me, if Mrs Tindal has no objection.\" That lady's permission was easily obtained, and Susan went up-stairs to put on her things. On her return, Marston insisted on putting on her shawl for her, and wrapped her up with innumerable precautions. As soon as they were alone, Marston, in redemption of his pro-"], [274, "266 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. mise, proceeded to lecture her upon her im prudence, \u2014 \" unless, indeed,\" he added, \" it was a stratagem to avoid meeting me at Ken sington yesterday.\" Susan had lost a great deal of the shyness which had oppressed her so painfully in the early days of her acquaintance with Sir Hu bert, although in the presence of strangers it seemed to return. Always treated by him on a footing of perfect equality, she began to feel herself his equal, and even, in some points, his superior. He could not be called a well-read man. The life he had led since he first en tered the army had not afforded him any great facility for study ; and it is doubtful if he had added much to his stock of knoAvledge by books since he left school. In fact, he had always greatly preferred active to sedentary life. He had, however, great natural power of observation, contriving, by some means or other, to acquire a vast amount of information on subjects that interested him; and as he had the tact to avoid the discussion of topics with which he was unacquainted, his ignor ance remained unsuspected. Susan, on the"], [275, "267 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. other hand, Avas passionately fond of reading, and had the happy knack of seizing upon, and fixing in her very retentive memory, the pith of the works which she literally devoured. By Mrs Tindal's advice, her studies, with a feAv exceptions, were directed to the more serious branches of literature ; and she was fast repairing the deficiencies of her neglected education. Naturally, she was fond of ex hibiting to her guardian her little stock of newly- acquired learning; and the various mer its of Greeks and Trojans, Romans and Car thaginians, Saxons and Normans, Cavaliers and Roundheads, were frequent subjects of conversation during the evenings spent at Kensington. Mrs Digby, it is true, Avas con siderably bored by them, but submitted with good grace to the infliction, when she saw the animation with which Susan defended her opinions, and how much that animation height ened her beauty. Digby encouraged them, partly because he took an interest himself in these historical disquisitions, partly because they excluded any more dangerous topics of conversation. Marston himself Avas at first"], [276, "268 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. amused, and then attracted, by Susan's eager ness, who soon made the discovery that her own knowledge on such subjects, however limited, was greater than her adversary's ; and it was Avith childish delight and a laugh of triumph, that she compelled him to acknow ledge his ignorance on some point of history or geography. But though all this tended to diminish the awe with Avhich he had once in spired her, it made no alteration in her feel ings of passionate devotion, to which, as yet, she had never ventured to give a name. When, therefore, his little lecture on her exposing herself so rashly to the Aveather was concluded, she entered upon her defence AAith great vigour, arguing that, having been obliged to rough it for the last seven or eight years of her life, it was nonsense to suppose that her having been caught in a summer-shoAver could have had anything to do Avith her cold. \" Luckily, the cold is gone, or nearly so,\" she continued, \" and there is no use in saying anything more about it. But come and look at our garden ; you will see that I have not been idle.\""], [277, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 269 She certainly had not, to judge by the ap pearance of the nook which had been made over to her, and Avhich she delighted in calling \" our garden.\" The roses were in full bloAv, the mignionette had sprung up, and was scent ing the Avhole air, while every vacant spot Avas filled with geraniums, heliotropes, and other plants. \" Well, it really is beautiful,\" said Mar ston, \" and in such good taste. It does your gardening talents great credit.\" \" Is it not ? \" she replied, \u2014 \" beautiful, I mean. And all my oavii doing. I put in every plant myself; and it Avas Avhile I Avas washing the roses with tobacco-Avater that I was caught in that tiresome rain. My fingers smelt of tobacco for tAvo days afterwards, and I do not think I have quite got the stains out of them yet. As for the tea-pot in which it was made, we were obliged to break it. You really might scold, if you knew the fortune I have spent on it all.\" The confidence with Avhich she seemed to reckon on his feeling interested in her opera tions was catching."], [278, "270 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Of course I go halves,\" he said, \" in all the expenses of our garden. As for the stains on your fingers, I do not believe in them. Let me look.\" She held out her hands. \" I see nothing the matter with them,\" he continued, taking one of them, and kissing it. She made half an effort to prevent it, blushing as she did so, and even Sir Hubert's colour rose a little. \" Of course you mean to give me one of our roses.\" \" No, indeed I cannot. Please do not ask me ; I am keeping them.\" \" Keeping them ! For whom ? \"For ,\" she stopped, embarrassed. \"It is a secret,\" she added, at length. A very disagreeable sensation took possession of Marston's mind, as he replied, \" Oh, if it is a secret, I have nothing to say. But I think Ave had better return to the house. You have been out quite long enough, and it is time for me to be off.\" His manner Avas so changed, so cold, that it struck a chill to Susan's heart."], [279, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 271 \" You are not angry with me ? \" she said, timidly. \" Angry, my dear child ! for what ? \" The \" dear child \" at once brought Susan to a recollection of their relative positions. \" I thought perhaps I ought not to have a secret from my guardian.\" \" My dear Susan, you must not treat my guardianship so seriously as that. I have no right to pry into your secrets. I knoAv all young ladies have secrets now and then, and I am quite sure you will never have any of which you have cause to be ashamed.\" It was more kindly said, though she derived but little comfort from it ; and still less when, after taking leaAe of Mrs Tindal, he shook hands with her as he wished her good-bye, and begged her to run no more risks for the future, even for the sake of her garden \u2014 \"our garden\" no more. With a sorrowful heart, Susan went up to her OAvn room, \u2014 sorrowful, but unre pentant. Nor did Marston recover his equanimity immediately. He was not only a kind but an indulgent master to his servants, but on the"], [280, "272 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. present occasion, seeing his groom holding the horses beneath the shade of a large elm tree at a little distance, he exclaimed in a voice of thunder, \"What the devil are you dawdling there for ! Are you going to keep me waiting till to-inorroAv morning?\" A mode of address which only made the man mutter to himself, \" What's up now, I wonder, that master's in his tantrums!\" Nothing like a good rattling gallop for shak ing off disagreeable thoughts. So thought Marston, as he turned the head of his aston ished horse in the direction of Hampstead, and set off at the rate of twenty miles an hour. In the present instance the receipt Avas a fail ure. Pulling up, he sent his groom home, and continued his solitary ride without any definite object, his thoughts perpetually reverting to the roses so carefully treasured up, and the mysterious individual for whom they were destined. \" Perhaps,\" he muttered half aloud, \" as her guardian, I ought to have insisted on some explanation, for it is certainly some love-"], [281, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 273 affair, and it is my duty to herself and her brother to take care that she does not throAv herself away. But avIio can it be ? Whom can she have seen ? No doubt Mrs Tindal has visitors \u2014 though I think she ought to have mentioned them \u2014 curates, and people of that sort. I sup pose it must be one of them. Or the doctor perhaps. After all, as long as she is respect ably married, it is no business of mine. Not that I shall give my consent under two years' probation, at least. Susan is much too young to marry yet. What a bore it is to be guard ian to a young girl.

The follow- ing day was devoted to preparations for his departure, amongst which is to be included a visit d' adieu to Mrs Digby. She Avas not at home, but he left a note for her to say that, being unexpectedly obliged to leave London, it would be out of his power to dine Avith her on Sunday, with all sorts of kind messages for Digby. He had omitted all mention of Susan ; but before sealing the note he relented, and added a postscript for her, containing his kind est regards. But on the morning of the day on which he entered his twenty-eighth year, an event oc curred that brought with it a considerable change in his intentions. He was still at his toilet, Avhen his servant announced that a young man insisted upon seeing him, having a letter and a parcel which he Avas strictly charged to give into no hands but his.

But I should never forgive myself if I did not thank you in person for your very kind recollection of me, though how you found out that it is my birthday I cannot divine.

I want to see if our garden is quite a desert. \u2014 Your affectionate guardian, Hubert Marston.\" The Acton messenger was again en route"], [284, "276 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. before he had half-devoured the breakfast set before him, Marston giving him a sove reign, with directions to take a Hansom cab, and keep the rest for himself. As soon as he was alone, Marston read Susan's note over again, and actually went the length of kissing the signature. \"What a fool I am,\" he said to himself ; \" if anybody Avere to see me, he would think I was in love with her. But the fact is, she is a clear, good girl, and I really take a great interest in her. I am glad to find she has no love-nonsense in her head, for I feel sure her brother Avould not approve of her marrying so young. By-the-by, I must tell the servants I am not going to-morrow.\" Once more he found himself at Mrs Tin dal's door, and, as luck would have it, that Avorthy lady Avas not at home. Susan Avas alone in the drawing-room, occupied, or trying to occupy herself, with an Italian exercise. Her quick ears had caught the sound of the door bell, and she strove, with indifferent success, to assume an air of composure. \" Sir Hubert ! \" she exclaimed. \" I had no"], [285, "277 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. idea you AA7ould be here so early. It is only half an hour since I received your note.\" \" Does that mean that I have come at an undue hour? But you must forgive me this once. I Avas so impatient to tell you what pleasure your magnificent present gave me. How on earth did you make the discovery that it was my birthday ? I ahvays keep it a profound secret when I can.\" \" Mrs Tindal has an old peerage. But Avhy do you Avish to keep it a secret ? \" \"Well, I do not see the fun of being congrat ulated upon adding a year to one's age ; that is to say, seeing one's life shortened by a year. Do you knoAv, Susan,\" he continued, writh a sigh, half in jest, half in earnest, \" I am get ting quite an old man, and must soon begin to look for grey hairs.\" She glanced at him a little anxiously, but could discover no signs of decrepitude about him. \" I think,\" she said, \" I am older than you ; I have never felt young.\" \"Not yet, perhaps,\" he replied. \"Your youth is all to come, and we will try to make"], [286, "278 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. it a pleasant one. You have had trials such as feAV girls have gone through ; and you have come out of them like gold tried in the fur nace. I feel proud of my Avard.\" And he took her hand. Something she tried to say, as she raised her eyes to his, but the Avords died aAvay on her lips. After a moment's silence, she changed the conversation. \" Mrs Tindal Avished me to tell you that she always goes about this time of year for a month or six weeks to her brother's in Hertfordshire. She can take me Avith her, and wants to know if you approve of it.\" \" What are your ov?n wishes ? \" \" I hardly know. I will do as you like.\" \" Have you already forgotten, Susan, that you made me a sort of promise to pay me a visit at Thornwood ? \" \" Oh, no ; only I thought perhaps you had changed your mind.\" \" My dear Susan, I do not change my mind so easily. What I say, I do ; especially Avhen another person is concerned.\" Apparently, he had forgotten all about his late preparations"], [287, "279 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. for leaving London at twenty-four hours' no tice. \" It remains, therefore, Avith you to de cide betAveen Thornwood and Hertfordshire.\" \" Oh, Thornwood, then,\" she exclaimed. \" Well, then, Ave must manage it with the Digbys. And that puts me in mind \u2014 who in the name of wonder can that be ? \" he ex claimed, as they heard a carriage drive up to the door. \" I shall leave you to receive your visitors alone, and make my escape by the verandah and garden. God bless you. We shall meet on Sunday.\" But he had only just passed out through the window, when a voice he knew struck upon his ear. \"My dear Susan,\" were the first words he heard, \"only think, that wretched man has left London without seeing any of us. I am so provoked, I declare that I could beat him with pleasure.\" Susan had just opened her lips to ask what wretched man, Avhen Marston himself stepped back into the room, and knelt at Mrs Digby's feet. \" Pray, do,\" he said, \" if it is any relief to"], [288, "280 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. your feelings. But strike gently, for I am a penitent sinner, and I Avas on the point of riding round by Kensington to tell you that I have been able to postpone my departure, and hope to be admitted to a share of your good things on Sunday.\" \" Well, if you can explain your capricious behaviour to my satisfaction, perhaps you may.\" \" Oh, it is not worth an explanation ; busi ness, which I find can Avait. But Ave stand in need of your assistance. I want you and John to pass the summer at Thornwood, and to bring Susan Avith you. Can it be man aged? \" Mrs Digby looked from one to the other, but there was not a trace of embarrassment on Sir Hubert's countenance ; and Susan's blushes were of too frequent occurrence to throAV much light on the subject. \" I hardly know,\" she replied, at length ; \" I should like nothing better myself, but John has set his heart upon going to SAvitzerland this long vacation. He says,\" she added, Avith a little laugh, \" that he wants to go once more"], [289, "281 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. over the ground where he made my acquaint ance. I am afraid he will be disappointed if Ave do not go there ; but, after all, it is for his OAvn good. We shall be saving money instead of spending it, and next year will do just as well. Can you find him anything to do at Thornwood for you? Professionally, I mean ? \" Of course, I can. In real earnest I shall be very glad of his presence and assistance to look through all my title-deeds. Not the work of a day, I can tell you.\" \" That will do admirably. Just propose it to him ; and then add that of course you ex pect him to bring me, and then a few days after, you can ask him to bring Susan. Do not let him suppose that Ave have been plot ting together against him. Poor, dear John ! I really do feel a qualm of conscience at inter fering AAith his plans.\" And so it Avas arranged, and eventually carried out. \" Poor, dear John,\" as his Avife compassionately called him, not only being obliged to give up his projected expedition, which he did with a very good grace, but to"], [290, "282 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. become an active, though happily unconscious, agent in Mrs Digby's domestic treason against himself. Mrs Tindal's visit to her brother \u2014 all mention of the proposal to take Susan with her being suppressed \u2014 Avas the ostensible rea son given by Lucy for Marston's invitation to her cousin ; and Digby, completely reassured by his friend's apparent indifference Avhenever Susan Avas mentioned, and the .paternal tone he assumed towards her whenever they met, did not dream of making any opposition to Avhat seemed to him to be the most natural thing in the world. If Sir Hubert's feelings towards Susan had undergone any change, he was quite as much in the dark as Digby himself. It is true that his last thought at night, and his first in the morning, were of her. It is true that, when preparing to go out in the evening, he felt something like a pang of regret that he had no chance of meeting her, and being greeted by her warm and kindly smile. It is true that he greatly preferred the quiet Sunday evenings at Kensington to any of his more brilliant and fashionable engagements. It is"], [291, "283 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. also true that, oAving to some delicate touch of equine instinct, his horse gradually acquired a taste for the Acton road, in preference to any other, without any resistance on the part of his rider : but all this failed to open his eyes. That the interest which he had origin- ally felt for the young girl, so strangely throAvn upon his protection, had greatly increased of late he was quite aware ; but he accounted for it entirely to his own satisfaction, by at- tributing it to every cause but the right one. The debt of gratitude Avhich he oAved the brother could only be repaid by his solicitude to promote the sister's welfare. Hitherto he had done no more for her than he Avould have done for any one else, under similar circumstances ; but, for Susan Ashford that Avas not enough ; she had peculiar claims on him which ought to be satisfied. In his sagacity, he proposed to himself to adopt her as a daughter. \" I have not the least wish to marry,\" he argued ; \" but I confess I should like to have a cheerful home, and some one to take care of me in my old age.\" Poor old man ! He never stopped to think of the construction that might be"], [292, "284 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. put upon a girl of seventeen undertaking to make a cheerful home for a man of seven-and tAventy. Still less did he reflect upon the possibility, that she might not have the same disinclination for matrimony Avhich he pro fessed himself. Good Mrs Tindal Avas so far from seeing anything extraordinary in the frequency of Marston's visits to the cottage, that she very innocently furnished him with an excuse for increasing their number. \" I do AATish, Sir Hubert,\" she said, \" that you could contrive to come some day Avhen Susan is taking her singing-lesson. I think you will be pleased with her progress.\" Against this, however, Susan, turning pale at the bare thought of it, vehemently pro tested, and declared that she could not sing a note if any one Avas present. It would make her so nervous. \" But I am nobody, Susan,\" Marston re plied. \" If you really Avish me not to come, I Avill certainly forbear ; but you will be de priving me of a very great pleasure. I am very fond of music, and sing a little myself,"], [293, "285 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. though sadly out of practice. I should not be sorry to come in for a little instruction from Doremi, and perhaps Ave could find some thing to sing together. I often try a duet with Cecilia, my eldest niece.\" This was putting matters in quite another light ; and Susan gave in at once. In fact, if Sir Hubert must sing at all, she thought she should greatly' prefer his singing with her to his singing AArith Miss Wilmington, though she Avas his niece. And thus Marston found himself domiciled at Acton tAvo or three times a-Aveek for hours together. \" Hoav good it is of you, Sir Hubert,\" said Susan, upon one occasion, \" to give us so much of your time, when you have so many other engagements.\" \" Selfishness, my dear Susan, \u2014 pure, unmi tigated selfishness. You have no idea Iioav Aveary I am of it all. Hoav I shrink from Digby's perpetual exhortations to marry, and from my sister's Avarnings against the ma n\u0153uvres of Lady This and Mrs That. Here, I know I shall find a Avarm welcome, and a kind friend, Avho will bore me with neither Avarning"], [294, "286 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. nor advice. This cottage is really to me a fountain in the desert.\" Susan replied nothing : but she felt in expressibly happy. Nor could she refrain from thinking Lady Deptford, notwithstanding Sir Hubert's murmurs, the most affectionate and meritorious of sisters \u2014 the Avisest and most sagacious of her sex."], [295, "287 CHAPTER XIII. At length the time arrived when Sir Hu bert Marston effected his departure from Lon don in earnest. Digby Avas still detained in town, and Marston in vain endeavoured to persuade Mrs Digby to accompany him to Thornwood Avith Susan, leaving her husband to follow at his leisure. But this Lucy would not hear of, and it was arranged that they should all folloAv in a week or ten days. Marston was not quite alone, as Lady Dept ford allowed him to take his youngest niece, Edith, with him. Lady Deptford, herself, was going on a round of visits with her tAvo eldest daughters ; and as the governess, Miss Smithson, had left them rather suddenly, she"], [296, "288 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Avas very glad of the opportunity of bestoAving Miss Edith in such safe and unexceptionable quarters. Marston had pressed his sister to take up her abode with him during the Avhole of his residence in the country, but when she found that the Digbys Avere likely to be his only guests for the first month or tAvo, she pleaded her previous engagements ; the truth being that she had no inclination to waste her sweetness on an attorney and his wife. She kneAv that Marston expected a long succession of more fashionable guests during the shooting season, and that was the time she selected for her own visit. Poor Hubert would want her to do the honours of his house ; and be- sides, after piloting him through the perils of a London season, it Avas doubly incumbent on her to see him safe through the still more formid- able clangers of life in a country house. This arrangement was very agreeable to Marston, who had his doubts as to the wisdom of bring ing the Digbys and Susan into such close con- tact AAith his sister. Edith Avas in raptures Avith the plan. For the first time in her life she found herself in"], [297, "289 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. a state of blissful independence, free from the control of nurse or governess, mother or sisters. The matronly airs she gave herself Avere par ticularly amusing. The servant selected to accompany her Avas a young girl very few years older than herself, Avhose duties had hitherto been confined to attendance on the governess and school-room, and on her Edith threAv the mantle of her protection. On ar riving at King's Cross, the first words she uttered were \u2014 \" Hubert, I should greatly prefer my maid travelling in the same carriage with us. She is not used to find herself alone on a rail- 33 way. \" Oh, she will be perfectly safe with my servant in a second-class carriage.\" \" I do not think that a proper arrange ment. I had much rather have her AA'ith me. You knoAv I am responsible for her now.\" Where she had picked up her fine words and fine sentiments puzzled her uncle not a ittle, but he had nothing to say against such very proper and decorous feelings. Having VOL. I. 19"], [298, "290 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. secured this point, before they had got far on their journey she opened on another. \" We are to dine together every day ? \" she asked, rather anxiously. \" Certainly, Ave are. Breakfast, lunch, and dine together ; and I shall expect you to make tea for me.\" \" Of course, I shall make tea for you. Men never knoAv how to make tea. And I am to sit at the head of the table?\" \" If you will do me that honour,\" he replied, Avith mock gravity. And having thus settled her position in Sir Hubert's household to her entire satisfaction, her thoughts Avent to other subjects, and a long and animated discussion ensued upon the weighty question, of how she Avas . to amuse herself during the next six Aveeks. Riding, driving, boating, fishing, all entered into the programme. \" After all,\" she said, \" I wish Mary or Ce cilia Avere Avith us. What am I to do AA'hen you cannot be with me ?\" \" I have thought of that, too,\" replied her uncle, \" and in a feAv days I hope to see some"], [299, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 291 friends I have asked to Thornwood. Amongst them is a young lady, whom I am sure you Avill like, though she is a good deal older than you.\" \"Oh, I am so glad, Uncle \u2014 Hubert, I mean,\" she said, quickly correcting her lapsus. \" What is her name?\" \" Susan ; Miss Susan Ashford.\" \" What a pretty name ! I am so fond of Susan. Is she like Simple Susan ?\" \" Well, as far as I recollect Simple Susan's story, I should say not in the least.\" A piece of information which Avas received with a pro longed Oh ! of disappointment. A Aveek elapsed, and at length the Digbys, accompanied by Susan, arrived. Edith, recol lecting all her mother's preparations Avhen expecting guests, had been particularly busy in taking care that the rooms Avere in proper order to receive them. Sir Hubert drove to the station to meet them, and invited his niece to go with him; and intense was her satisfac tion, when, after greeting his friends, he said to Mrs Digby, \" Will you and Miss Ashford"], [300, "292 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. permit me to present to you my niece, Miss Edith Wilmington, who is good enough to do the honours of Thornwood Priory for me.\" Mrs Digby laughed and kissed her, which a little disconcerted her dignity, but recovering herself, she said, \" I hope Mrs Digby you will find your rooms comfortable ; I have done my best to make them so, I assure you.\" Lucy stared a little, but catching the smile on Marston's countenance, entered into the joke, and gravely thanked her for her hospit able attentions. They then entered the car riage, and Edith, squeezing herself in between her uncle and Susan, possessed herself of a hand of each. On arriving at the house, she insisted on accompanying Mrs Digby up-stairs, and having ushered her into the apartment destined for her, turned to Susan, and per formed the same kind office for her. But when they were alone together, the youngest lady thought proper to throw off the ten or fifteen years which she had superadded to her age, and came out in her proper character. \" Is it not a nice room ? \" she said. It looks on to the garden and the lake beyond. I was"], [301, "293 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. determined you should have it, because it is next to mine, and I am sure I shall like you very much. I am so fond of the name of Susan. Do you think you shall like me?\"- Being satisfied on this point, she continued, \"And the floAvers on the chimney-piece are beautiful, are they not ? Hubert said you liked floAvers, so we both Avent out to gather them for you. Do you like riding ?\" Susan was obliged to confess that she had never been on horseback. \" Oh, I am so sorry. I have such a pretty pony, and Ave could have such nice rides together. But Hubert will teach you.\" This irreverent manner of naming her uncle appeared to Susan, if not flat blasphemy, something very near akin to it. \" Do you ahvays call your uncle Hubert?\" she asked. Upon which Miss Edith resumed her inde pendent manner. \" Oh, you know he is so young, Ave hardly look upon him as an uncle. Besides, he likes us to call him Hubert ; he told us to do it. If you like, I will tell him to let you call him Hubert. He always does what I ask him.\""], [302, "294 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" Oh, no, upon no account. You forget I am not a relation of his.\" \" But Avill you call me Edith, and let me call you Susan.\" To this there could be no objection, and the compact was sealed by kisses, of which ladies are so prodigal to each other, and so chary to those avIio would probably set a higher value on them. \" What an extraordinary little girl that niece of yours is, Sir Hubert !\" observed Mrs Digby, when they met before dinner. \" She is, indeed, the most comical of mortals ; monkey and parrot in one. Whatever she hears or sees, she makes a point of saying or doing. She insists upon sitting at the head of my table, and you Avill see her doing the honours like a little old woman of fifty.\" And so she did. It Avas the most absurd thing in the Avorld to see the perfect gravity Avith which she gave her directions, and issued her orders to the servants, aa4io appeared to obey her mandates even more scrupulously than they did their master's. Twenty times during dinner a smile rose to the lips of her"], [303, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 295 guests, hastily repressed, and fortunately un observed ; but when at the conclusion of the repast, she bowed to Mrs Digby and Susan, and said in her most dignified manner, \" If you are ready for coffee, Ave will leave the gentlemen to themselves,\" her uncle could re frain no longer, but burst into shouts of laughter so catching that the others could not help chiming in. \" My darling Edith,\" he cried, \" do come and give me a kiss before you kill me outright.\" The young lady vouchsafed no answer ; but when she reached the drawing-room, turned to her companions, and asked them if they had ever seen anything so extraordinary as Hubert's manner. \" I only hope he has not been tak ing too much wine.\" An observation, which again threw them into fits of laughter, exciting her astonishment if not her indignation. But Susan had a Avay with her that soon found the road toEdith's heart. Long before Marston and Digby joined them, Miss Edith had descended from her stilts, and was quietly seated on a stool at the foot of her new friend, holding one of her hands, with her head resting on her knees,"], [304, "296 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. and making her the most confidential commu nications respecting her past life. \" By-the-by, Marston,\" said Digby, \" I met in the same carriage in Avhich we travelled an old college friend, Robert Ainslie. He is a clergyman, and is coming to take the duty here for the next tAvo months for your rector, avIio is gone, or going, on a holiday excursion. I wish you would call on him, and ask him to dinner.\" \" Of course I will. Dr Snodgrass did tell me he Avas going away for a short time, but I fancied it was only next Aveek. If you will take charge of Edith for her ride to-morrow, I will call on him, and make him fix a day for dining here.\" So said, so done. Tavo days afterwards Mr Ainslie made his appearance at ThoniAVOod. He was a decidedly good-looking man, Avith features rather of the massive order ; not very intellectual, but evidently on very good terms Avith himself, and not troubled with any mis givings as to the impression which he might produce on others. It Avas rather an exag geration on Digby's part when lie styled him"], [305, "297 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. a college friend. Had he said acquaintance it Avould have been nearer the truth, for not the slightest degree of intimacy had ever existed be tween them ; and had his opinion of Mr Ainslie's merits been asked during their academical career, he would probably have described him as a prig and a bore. It is difficult, however, not to treat with cordiality any companion of one's youthful days, when a meeting unex pectedly takes place ; and Digby had responded Avith warmth to the greeting of his fellow student, introducing him to Mrs Digby and Susan. He remarked with pleasure that, during the few hours they remained together the latter Avas the object of the reverend gentleman's especial attention, and when he found that they Avere to be near neighbours for the next few Aveeks, he determined to do his best to improve the occasion. Perhaps, recollecting his wife's eulogium on the quali ties which made Susan so peculiarly fit to be a clergyman's wife, he Avished to provide his friend with a help meet for him. Perhaps he wished to test said wife's sincerity. Perhaps \u2014 but it is useless going on Avith conjectures, for"], [306, "298 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. in all probability he did not exactly knoAv himself Avhat it was he intended, when he first set the ball rolling. It is needless to say that the Rev. Robert Ainslie speedily became the object of Mrs Digby's unmitigated aversion. His manner to Sir Hubert, in his double capacity of master of ThornAvood Priory and patron of the living, was one of profound de ference and respect, bordering on servility. The ladies he addressed Avith a familiarity AA'hich their previous intercourse hardly war ranted, and he contrived mortally to offend Edith, by patting her cheeks and telling her she was a fine little girl of her age. Alto gether, his debitt so far Avas not a very success ful one, though he appeared to be utterly unconscious of the fact, and was soon com pletely at his ease. In fact, there was no reason Avhy he should not be. Marston had lived too much with so many different classes and races of men, to be very exacting in the manners of those Avith whom he Avas thrown into contact, provided there Avas nothing grossly offensive in them. Moreover he was"], [307, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 299 in his OAvn house, and the only sign of disap probation which he Avould have allowed him self toAvards a guest, Avould have been an in crease of the most frigid courtesy. Digby felt himself bound to support, to the best of his ability, the cause of him Avhom he had intro duced as his friend. Susan certainly felt that, compared to Sir Hubert and Digby, Mr Ains lie Avas decidedly Avanting in polish ; but she Avas too little used to society to attribute his want of refinement to its true cause. What Avas in reality hopeless, innate vulgarity, ap peared to her merely Avant of knoAvledge of the world \u2014 no unpardonable sin in a clergyman. He seemed good-humoured, and told one or tAvo funny stories of his Oxford days, Avhich made her laugh, much to Mrs Digby's indig nation. That worthy lady preserved a digni fied silence, occasionally broken by a whispered sentence to Miss Edith. After dinner, Susan took up Undine, which had been recommended to her for her German studies, the other tAvo having recourse to the chess-board; but they were not long left in solitude. Mr Ainslie Avas the first to make his"], [308, "300 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. appearance, and walked straight up to the table at. Avhich Susan Avas seated. \" You are fond of study, Miss Ashford, I presume,\" he said. \" It is seldom we see youth and beauty so Avell occupied. May I be permitted? Ah, a charming tale ! No doubt, you are a good German scholar.\" \" No, indeed, I AA'ish I Avas. I am quite a beginner, and get on very slowly, for unfortun ately I have no one to assist me. Lucy pre tends she has forgotten all her German.\" \" Perhaps, Miss Ashford, you will permit me to assist you.\" \" Do you understand German, Mr Ainslie ?\" \" Yes, I Avas two years in Germany. I shall be most happy to give you lessons as long as I remain here, though I can hardly believe you stand in need of them.\" \"A capital opportunity for you, Susan,\" said Digby, who had joined them\"; \" the very thing you said you Avere Avishing for.\" \"I do not like to take advantage of Mr Ainslie's good nature.\" \" I assure you, Miss Ashford,\" said that gentleman eagerly, \" you Avill be conferring a"], [309, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 301 favour on me ; for my German wants rubbing up. You have only to name an hour.\" But to name an hour Avas no easy matter. After breakfast, AA'hile Digby Avas busy in the Thorn AArood muniment-room, his wife and Susan passed their time with Sir Hubert and Edith in the garden, or park, or on the water. To give up these excursions Avas not to be thought of for a moment. After luncheon the two ladies drove out, Avhile Digby escorted Edith in her rides, Marston joining sometimes one, sometimes the other of these parties. In this dilemma, the master of the house was informed of Avhat Avas in agitation, and appealed to for a decision. \"I am delighted you have found an assist ant, Susan,\" he said. \" It is very kind in Mr Ainslie. I think, if Mrs Digby approves, Ave had better have luncheon half an hour earlier, and drive half an hour later. This will give you from two to three. Will this arrangement suit you, Mr Ainslie ? \" The arrangement suited Mr Ainslie per fectly. \" Well, then,\" continued Sir Hubert, \" you"], [310, "302 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. had better come here to luncheon on the days you fix upon for giving your lessons, and in this Avay no time Avill be lost.\" Nothing could be better. Mr Ainslie made his appearance at luncheon, at first every other day, and then, by degrees, every day \u2014 an improvement Avhich more than once brought something like a frown upon Marston's broAA*s. Susan, however, always greeted her preceptor with a smile ; and openly expressed her im patience if his advent Avas delayed a little longer than usual ; but it seemed doubtful whether this arose from a pure love of know ledge, or from any hidden motive of a more personal nature. For a long time Lucy said nothing, but at last her curiosity got the better of her. \" You seem to get on very Avell with Mr Ainslie,\" she said one day to her cousin. \" Oh, yes, indeed. He is a capital master ; so patient, and takes so much pains to ex plain everything. I am getting on famously ; and I really think I like German better than Italian.\""], [311, "303 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \"And I hope you feel duly grateful to him for all his trouble.\" \" Well, I am afraid not so much as I ought to do. He is a little pompous, and not so amusing as I thought him at first. And then, he is short-sighted, and sits so close to me on the sofa, that it is really uncomfortable in this hot weather. But it is a great shame in me to say all this, for he is so good-natured.\" \" I think I should give up the sofa for a chair.\" \" So I did ; but lie said he could not see.\" A few days afterwards, Sir Hubert had an opportunity of observing the close proximity in which tutor and pupil were seated. Com ing rather unexpectedly into the room in which they Avere pursuing their studies, he saw Ains lie's arm extended on the back of the sofa, and looking at a little distance as if it encircled Susan's waist, while their heads were almost touching. At the noise of his entrance, the reverend gentleman gave a start, and made a suspicious movement of removing his arm, Avhile Susan never stirred, but merely looked up."], [312, "304 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. \" I am sorry to disturb you,\" said the in truder, \"but the carriage is at the door, and Mrs Digby wishes to knoAv if you will soon be ready.\" \" Oh, Sir Hubert, only five minutes more,\" said Susan. \" Do ask Lucy if she will wait five minutes. We are just in the middle of such an interesting description.\" Mr Ainslie whis pered something to her. \" And would you mind driving round by the rectory, and set ting Mr Ainslie down? It is such a hot walk.\" This Avas really adding insult to injury. Mentally, Sir Hubert consigned the uncon scious object of his Avrath to that region where hot Avalks are supposed to be indigenous ; but he contented himself Avith replying with stiff formality : \" I have no doubt, Miss Ashford, that Mrs Digby will have much pleasure in taking Mr Ainslie home. Unfortunately, it will not be in my poAver to join your party, as I have business in another direction.\" What would she not have given to recall her Avoids, AA'hen the \" Miss Ashford \" struck upon"], [313, "305 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. her ear ! Evidently he had reckoned upon their driving him someAvhere Avhere he Avished to go, and now she had put it out of his power to'accompany them. \u2022 Nor had she an opportunity of expressing her regrets that evening. Immediately after dinner Sir Hubert's steward was announced, and the tAvo gentlemen retired to hold a con sultation Avith that important functionary, and did not return to the drawing-room till Mrs Digby and her cousin were on the point of retiring. From the first day of Susan's arrival at Thornwood, Edith chose to consider her as especially intrusted to her care, and devoted herself to her with an assiduity which, if it had its charms, was not without its draAvbacks. It Avas delightful summer weather, they were both of them early risers, and every morning, even sometimes before she was quite dressed, Susan's room was invaded by her self-elected patroness, who came to summon her forth for a stroll in the park, or an excursion as far as the village. For the first few days Susan yielded, but at length she stood on the defen- vol. i. 20"], [314, "306 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. sive. Some hours in the day she determined to reserve for herself. Although it Avas holi day-time, she had no thoughts of passing it entirely in idleness, and what time in the day could be more appropriate for study than the hours before breakfast, before the rest of the family appeared. When this decision was first announced to Edith, she treated it almost as a personal offence, particularly when she found that all her entreaties and all her allure ments Were insufficient to shake Susan's reso lution. She was obliged to succumb, and sought consolation in impeding the gardeners in their Avork, and more especially in attend ing upon the gamekeeper in his fishing operations. It so happened that on the morning succeed ing Susan's unlucky intervention to save Mr Ainslie's legs, an immense pike was caught by a night-line in the lake ; and Edith, breathless with excitement, rushed up to the house with the neAvs. She burst into her friend's room. \" Oh, Susan, we have caught such a fine pike. Come down to the water to see it ; just this once. You have never seen a pike, and keeper"], [315, "307 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. says it is a twenty-pounder ; the biggest he ever caught. So come.\" Susan Avas sorely tempted. It was a lovely morning, and she was rather curious about a pike of such a size ; but her eye fell on her German exercise, not half-finished, and she was firm. She refused to break the rule she had laid down for herself, and Edith retired in great dudgeon. At the foot of the stairs she met her uncle. \" Hallo, Pussy, what brings you here ? \" \" Oh, Hubert, we have caught such a pike. Keeper says it is twenty pounds, but I am sure it must be a hundred. I have been to ask Susan to come and see it, but she is so ill-natured she won't. She is reading, or writ ing, or something ; but I knoAv she is dying to come. Do try and make her.\" Marston had some curiosity to see how far his influence extended. He went under Susan's window, and at his call she came to it and looked out. \" Edith and I want you for this once to join us, and accompany Us to the lake. I assure you this is a fish worth looking at.\""], [316, "308 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. But Susan, though she smiled, shook her head. \" Please do not ask me, Sir Hubert ; I should like it so much, but I have hardly time as it is to finish what Mr Ainslie set me to do.\" The reason given Avas incontrovertible. Sir Hubert raised his hat from his head. \" You are right, and I am Avrong, Miss Ashford,\" he said. \" I can only regret that I should have interrupted you in your more pleasing employment on such an idle errand.\" She might as Avell have gone ; for the mis takes she made in her translation were per fectly astounding, and sorely perplexed her worthy preceptor Avhen he came to look it over. After breakfast, they all went together, as usual, into the garden ; and Susan, finding herself for a few minutes alone with Marston, began expressing her sorrow for the mishap of the preceding day, and her refusal to ac company him that morning. \" But Mr Ainslie made me promise so faith fully to have my exercise ready for him, that I could not break my word to him, could I ? \" \"Oh, certainly not. It was all oAving to"], [317, "309 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. my stupidity in supposing for a moment that a wish of mine could prevail against a Avish of Mr Ainslie's. The next time I ask you to come out for a walk I Avill take care to secure Mr Ainslie's permission for you beforehand, for I perceive that his influence is all-poAverful noAV.\" \" Mr Ainslie's ! \" she exclaimed, raising her eyes to his, Avith a look of inquiry : then, catch ing his meaning for the first time, she turned her head aside to conceal her agitation. Luck. ily for her, Edith came to her rescue, with the information that the keeper Avas bringing the fish up to the house ; and, taking her by the hand, led her off to inspect it. Mr Ainslie came at his usual hour, but the lesson was a short one, Susan pleading, Avith truth, a bad head-ache."], [318, "310 CHAPTER XIV. There is an old proverb, that \" It never rains but it pours :\" the truth of which Sir Hubert Avas destined to experience. When Susan and Ainslie had retired as usual after luncheon, his friend Digby asked to speak to him on a subject of some importance. It .appears that he had fallen in with his reverend friend in the course of the morning, and the curate had thought the opportunity propitious for sounding the lawyer Avith regard to Susan. \" What a charming, unaffected girl Miss Ashford appears to be,\" he began ; \" I believe she is a relation of yours.\" \" Yes ; that is to say, she is a cousin of my Avite s. \" Oh, I see ; a relation by marriage. May"], [319, "311 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. I ask if she is in any way connected Avith Sir Hubert ? \" \" Not in the least. Sir Hubert happens to be an intimate friend of her brother's, who is now established in India ; and on the death of her father a few months ago, offered to act as her guardian, in conjunction Avith my father in-laAV.\" A father lately dead, guardians, a brother established in India, in some lucrative employ ment probably, sounded Avell. Miss Ashford might be an heiress in a small way. He was dying to ask the question, but did not very Avell know Iioav to set about it. \" Is Mr Ashford in the Civil Service ? \" he asked. Digby guessed Avhat was passing in his mind, and Avas very Avell disposed to help him. \" No,\" he replied ; \" Mr Henry Ashford is in the medical profession, but I should say that his position and prospects must be good, for he gave up his share of his patrimony to his sister. It Avas not much, certainly, but altogether Susan will have about five thousand pounds.\""], [320, "312 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Mr Ainslie paused to reflect. Five thou sand pounds are not much, but it is not every pretty girl who has five thousand shillings. And then there was Sir Hubert, Avho had very good church-preferment at his disposal. AVith his friendship for the brother, and the interest he evidently took in the sister, he would cer tainly be inclined to do something for the sister's husband, provided that husband met Avith his approbation. \" I Avill tell you honestly, my dear friend,\" said he, taking Digby's arm in a confidential manner, \" Lam greatly taken Avith Miss Ash ford, downright, positively in love ; and I have never seen the girl I had rather make my Avife. But I feel that, admitted as I have been by Sir Hubert to the intimacy of his family, I ought not to take any step in the matter Avith out his knoAA'ledge and consent. How Avould you advise me to act ? \" \" In short,\" said Digby, laughing, \" you Avant me to act for you. As for myself, I can only say that you have my hearty good Avishes, and if you distinctly authorize me to request for you Sir Hubert's permission to"], [321, "313 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. address Miss Ashford, I Avill do so this very day. I presume you have the means of main taining your wife in the position which Mar ston would expect for his ward ? \" \" Ah, that is just the point I was coming to. I have two hundred a-year of my own, and professional expectations, of course. But you knoAv, expectations are proverbially un certain, and our joint incomes would be little enough to live on, particularly if we have a family. Now, Sir Hubert has great church patronage, and no brother to provide for ; and it struck me, that you might take an oppor tunity of insinuating to him, that the promise of the next presentation to the living of Thorn wood would be a very appropriate marriage present to his ward.\" Digby, though one of a much maligned class, had not a sordid thought in his com position, and this disclosure of speculative ra pacity rather cooled his enthusiasm in the cause he had undertaken. By a hasty move ment he disengaged his arm from Ainslie's ; but then he reflected that no man is perfect \u2014 that there are many greater faults than a"], [322, "314 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. desire to increase one's income by legitimate means, \u2014 and that a man may be a very good husband and father, and yet look well to the main chance. Lastly, he could not bear to see the plant Avhich he had tended and Avatered with so much care ruthlessly torn up by the roots. He would not, therefore, upon such slight grounds, abandon the friend he had offered to serve; in other Avoids, give up a scheme which was the offspring of his own brain. He replied, therefore, to Ainslie's pro posal kindly, but more gravely than usual. \" No, I cannot undertake that ; and I think, from Avhat I knoAv of Marston, it Avould be the sure way of defeating your object. Leave it entirely to him, and, my Avord for it, he will do more than you have a right to expect.\" \" Well, my dear friend, I will be guided by you \u25a0 though, I confess, I should have liked to know Avhat I have to depend upon. When shall I hear the result of your interview ? \" \"In the course of the afternoon. I will speak to him while you are with Susan, and you shall find a note from me on your return to the rectory. I would see you before you"], [323, "315 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. leave the house, but I have an engagement with the steward before your lesson will be over.\" The details of this interview Digby did not think it necessary to relate to Marston. He simply told him that Mr Ainslie had informed him of his love for Susan, and Avas anxious for Sir Hubert's approbation of his suit, and per mission to address his ward. It can scarcely be said that Sir Hubert was taken by surprise, for he had for some days past had strong suspicions of Mr Ainslie's in tentions, but he Avas certainly not prepared for so speedy a denouement; and AAThen it came, it gave him a shock which sent every drop of blood from his face. He recovered himself almost immediately, for he felt that Digby's eye Avas on him. \" Well,\" he said, Avith a feeble attempt at jocularity, \" he has not lost his time. Is Miss Ashford aware of the state of his feelings, and of this application ?\" \"As to what Susan may suspect, I know nothing, but I can take upon me to say, that she knows nothing of this application. He"], [324, "316 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. said himself that, after the Avay in which you had received him, he felt bound to take no step in the matter Avithout your assent.\" \"Well, he Avas introduced as your friend, and I need no further proof that he is a gen tleman \u2014 a man of honour and respectability \u25a0 and unless you felt that he would make a good husband, of course you would not have under taken this mission. I can have no objection to his addressing Miss Ashford, though I con fess I have grave doubts of the propriety of a clergyman's marrying.\" \" My clear Hubert,\" said Digby, in the greatest astonishment, \" you are not turning- Papist, I hope.\" \" This has nothing to do with Papist, or Protestant. St Paul speaks very decidedly on the advantages of celibacy, and his remarks -apply with double force to the clergy. Hoav ever, this is merely my private opinion. I know that in England ninety-nine out of a hundred do marry ; snapping-up,\" he added, rather bitterly, \" the prettiest girls in the country, especially when they happen to have a little money. Mr Ainslie, therefore, is quite"], [325, "317 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. en regie, and there is no reason AA-hy he should not try his chance with the rest.\" Digby was so astounded by his friend's dis play of theological lore, that it never occurred to him that, had Mr Robert Ainslie been a soldier or a sailor, some equally valid objection might have been urged. He had no wish, however, to enter upon a religious discussion, and contented himself Avith saying, \"Then I may tell Ainslie that his suit has your approbation.\" \" Nothing of the sort. I neither approve, nor disapprove. I express no opinion. Mr Ainslie pays me the very unusual compliment of asking my permission to address my ward, and I return it Avith another. But let him understand that, even in the event of Miss Ashford's accepting him, I shall withhold my formal consent till I have had an opportunity of consulting her brother, whose locum tenens I am. This is so diametrically opposed to the plans he had laid down for her, that he ought to be made acquainted with it before anything is definitely settled.\" \" Surely this is excess of delicacy. Mr"], [326, "318 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Ashford can have nothing in view but his sister's happiness.\" \" Of course ; but I prefer being on the right side. Miss Ashford is still so young that she can well afford to Avait a year.\" \" Well, I Avill let Ainslie knoAv your vieAvs. No doubt he will speak to Susan to-morrow. AVould it not be as well if you were to prepare her for it in some measure, and point out to her Avhat an advantageous opportunity she now has of establishing herself in England. I know she has no Avish to go to India, and a Avord from you Avould do much.\" \" No, I Avill not interfere one way or the other. If Mr Ainslie can Avin her, let him ; but he shall receive no assistance from me. After all, her happiness is the great \u2014 the only object for me to consider. If she were to make an unhappy marriage, and that I thought one word of mine had contributed to it, I should never forgive myself.\" He endeavoured to speak calmly, but his agitation was fast getting the better of him ; and he felt it as a great relief when Digby left the room to write word to his client of the"], [327, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 319 progress he had made, and to advise him to open his batteries on the following day. As soon as he was alone, Marston threAv himself on the sofa, and for a moment buried his face in his hands; then, starting up, he seized his hat, and rushed out of the house by the back-door. If he had hitherto been doubtful of the nature of his feelings for Susan, the truth was noAv forced upon him in the most unmistakable manner. He knew \u2014 now that there was every chance of her being lost to him for ever \u2014 that he loved her passionately, devotedly, and, as his fears suggested, hope lessly. He recalled Avith painful precision many little circumstances, insignificant in themselves, but which to the microscopic eye of jealousy seemed to indicate that, Mr Ainslie's pupil honoured her tutor with no common degree of regard. He cursed his OAvn folly in having alloAved so many opportunities of securing the treasure for himself to escape, when Susan, living almost in the seclusion of a harem, which he alone had the privilege of breaking, seemed to desire no greater gratifi cation than that which his visits afforded her."], [328, "320 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. He remembered with what expressions of gratitude she had thanked him for his slightest services ; Iioav anxious she had been for his approbation ; Iioav eagerly she had sought for his advice, and endeavoured to anticipate his wishes even in the merest trifles. Hoav easy it Avould then have been to have developed these favourable dispositions into a warmer feeling. And now \u2014 lost ; lost to him for ever, and through his oavii fault. He tried to drive the thought away, but it would return. One thing Avas clear. It was noAV too late to speak out. He had authorized Mr Ainslie's addresses, and he was bound to give him a fair field. Henceforward, he would be more guarded than ever in his attentions to Susan. No one should ever guess Iioav inexpressibly clear she had become to him. His love and his sufferings should be confined to his own bosom. And to all outward appearance he succeeded, though at what cost to himself he alone could tell. In vain poor Susan, who had been suf fering great remorse of mind, if not of con science, for her refusal to accompany him in"], [329, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 321 the morning, and in whose ears his sarcasms still tingled, tried to inveigle him to her side by playing and singing his favourite airs, in the hope of finding some opportunity of expressing her sorrow and repentance. He remained obstinately seated near Mrs Digby, Avho was, as usual, playing at chess with Edith, and occupied himself in looking over her game and advising her moves, notwithstanding the young lady's earnest remonstrances. Digby composed the whole of Susan's audience, and he was in such a state of elation at his morn- ing's Avork, that he applauded and encored her performance Avith a vehemence, which more than once nearly brought the ready tears into her eyes. She was thankful when the evening came to a close, her only crumb of comfort being Marston's fervent \"God bless you,\" as he Avished her good-night. Before she rose the following morning, all her partiality for Ainslie's society, if indeed she had ever entertained any, had completely .vanished, for she could not avoid connecting him in some Avay Avith the estrangement that appeared to have sprung up between her VOL. I. 21"], [330, "322 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. guardian and herself, and she resolved to decline any further continuance of her studies under his auspices. That day's lesson should be the last. What reason to give for this sudden resolution she knew not, but she made up her mind rather to be taxed with caprice, than to submit any longer to what was now become a positive infliction. It Avas therefore under very unfavourable circumstances that Ainslie entered on his wooing. As soon as they were alone he asked her permission, before they began their daily task, to address her upon a subject deeply connected with his own happiness, and Avhich he flattered himself was not a matter of total indifference to her. \" In fact, Miss Ashford,\" he continued, after beating about the bush for some little time, \" you must be aware of my feelings to wards you, and it is with Sir Hubert Mar ston's approbation that I now ask you to be my wife.\" His exordium had to a certain extent pre pared her for what was to follow; but the colour Avhich rose to her cheeks was certainly not produced by the effects of sympathy, as"], [331, "323 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. he fondly imagined. While he was yet speak ing, she was arranging in her own mind the terms in which she would thank him for the unexpected compliment he had paid her, express her regret that it was out of her power to return his affection, and request that the subject might never again be mentioned be tween them . But when he alluded to Marston's approbation, it drove every other thought out of her head. She had intended to let him doAvn as gently as possible, with some civil expressions of sorrow for his disappointment, hopes that he would soon forget her, and find some one more Avorthy, &c. ; in short, the sort of thing that I am told charitable young ladies do generally say on such occasions. But now every gentler feeling gave way to bitter morti fication, and it was in a hard and unnatural tone of voice that she asked, if she was to understand that Sir Hubert was aware of, and sanctioned, his proposals. \" Most decidedly,\" was the answer. \" In that case, I can only express my deep regret that it is out of my power to comply with his wishes. I was not the least prepared"], [332, "324 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. for such a communication, and it is due to my self to state that I had not the slightest idea that you looked upon me as more than a com mon acquaintance. Had I been aAvare of the state of your feelings at an earlier period, I should at once have told you then, as I do noAV, that I can never return them.\" \" Oh, Susan,\" said the reverend suitor, throwing himself on his knees, and trying to take her hand, a man\u0153uvre which she dexter ously evaded, \" 1 shall not relinquish all hope of calling you mine. You say you were un prepared, and I feel sure that upon reflec tion \u2014 \" \" I must beg of you to rise, Mr Ainslie,\" said Susan, interrupting him, \" and to take my decision as a definitive one, which neither time nor reflection will induce me to alter. I Avish to express this as strongly as possible, that there may be no misunderstanding on the subject. I thank you for the honour of your proposal, but beg to decline it. I haAe no thoughts of marrying. As soon as my brother is settled in India, he Avishes me to go out to him, and I intend doing so.\""], [333, "325 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Mr Ainslie had risen, and brushed his knees \"with his handkerchief, but a very ugly scowl appeared upon his heavy brow. He was not \u25a0one to take a disappointment Avell, and he lost his temper. \" I thank you, Miss Ashford,\" he said, \" for speaking so plainly, if for nothing else. I am quite aAvare that India holds out many inducements to young ladies, but I fear you Avill not find brilliant establishments there so \u2022easy of attainment as they once were. The market is over-stocked. I have the honour to Avish you good-morning.\" The neAVS of his defeat soon reached the ears of Sir Hubert and the Digbys, affecting them variously. Lucy pretended to take it as a matter of course ; Marston did his best to conceal his own exultation, and to calm Digby's displeasure, in neither of Avhich attempts was he perfectly successful. For Digby Avas furi ous. Ainslie had communicated to him by letter the particulars of his interview with Susan, and dwelt, in no measured terms, on Avhat he Avas pleased to consider the ill-treat ment which he had met Avith at her hands."], [334, "326 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. He wound up by saying that, after Avhat had occurred, it Avould be impossible for him to set foot in the Priory again, as long as Miss Ashford remained its inmate. Then, with curious inconsistency, he begged Digby to let him know if he saw any chance of that young lady's changing her mind. As soon as Edith had retired for the night, Digby opened the phials of his Avrath upon the offender. He told her that her conduct had most grievously disappointed him, that he had given her credit for more good sense than to refuse, without consideration, the proposals of a man who Avas able to offer her a com fortable home, and a respectable position in society, \u2014 a man to Avhom there could be no rea sonable objection, and whose suit had received the approbation of her guardian, who, as she well kneAv, had her welfare at heart. And as Digby was one who greAv warm as he pro ceeded, and occasionally Avorked himself up to say more than he intended, he Avound up his oration by declaring that it Avas worse than folly ; it looked like ingratitude. But here Marston interposed."], [335, "SIR HUBERT MARSTON. 327 \" I should see neither folly nor ingratitude in it, even if I had expressed my approbation, for Susan \" \u2014 she was Susan noAV \u2014 \" is the best judge of what is likely to constitute her own happiness ; but it so happens that I took especial care, as you may remember, to express neither approbation nor disapprobation. Mr Ainslie applied for my permission to address my ward, and I gave it, feeling, indeed, that I was only giving Avhat I had no right to refuse.\" \" A very different thing from approbation, I should think,\" observed Mrs Digby. \" Not at all,\" said Digby, sharply, \" not at all. On such an occasion, permission may Avell be assumed to imply approbation. I must beg, Lucy, that you will not encourage Susan in her absurd notions, for I still hope she will have the good sense to reconsider her determination, and allow Ainslie another op portunity of pleading his cause.\" Lucy gave a most provoking shrug of her shoulders, and Susan exclaimed, \" What ! after he taunted me Avith Avishing to go to India with the intention of making a great marriage ; and was good enough to"], [336, "328 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. Avarn me that I might be disappointed, as the market is over-stocked. No, thank you, Mr Digby.\" \" AVhat ! \" cried Lucy and Marston to gether, \" did he tell you that ? \" \" He did, indeed, in those very Avords. \"The brute !\" muttered Lucy. \"The ill-conditioned cur!\" responded Marston. \"You must have misunderstood him, Susan,\" said Digby. \" But Avhatever he may have said, you ought to make some allowance for a man writhing under his disappointment ; and I will undertake to say, that a word from you Avill bring him here to-morrovv to apolo gize, if he really did say anything to hurt your feelings. After all, Avhat are your objections to him ? \" \" One objection is, I think, sufficient. He is not a man for Avhom I could ever feel the affection that a woman ought to feel for her husband.\" \"Nonsense, Susan,\" said Digby, impatiently. \" If you have imbibed any of those high-floAvn notions of romantic love which young ladies"], [337, "329 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. are so fond of indulging in, the sooner you get rid of them the better. Take my Avord for it, the happiest marriages are those which are founded on a rational amount of friendship and mutual esteem. As for an all-absorbing passion with its hearts and darts, its loves and cloves, it only exists in the imagination of poets and novel-writers, or, if it does, it gener ally dies a natural death before the end of the honeymoon. No sensible person would ever expect happiness from a mere love-marriage.\" \" Thank you, Mr Digby,\" cried Lucy, rather hysterically, for she Avas now really hurt and angry ; \" thank you. I can remember the time, and that not so long ago, Avhen you held a very different language. I am truly thankful for your sake that we did not under take the tour Ave had projected. There are scenes in Switzerland which might have re called words, no doubt repented of long ago. At any rate I am glad, even at this late hour, to be enlightened as-to your real sentiments.\" \" My dear Lucy,\" said Digby, a good deal shocked at this application of the general prin ciple which he had just enunciated, \" you can-"], [338, "330 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. not for a moment suppose that I meant any allusion to us or our marriage ! \" \" Oh, no, Lucy,\" exclaimed Susan, \" you wrong Mr Digby. He had no thought of you in Avhat he said. It Avas all directed to me. Do not add to my other causes of unhappiness the thought that I have been in any way the source of dissension between you and your husband. It is natural that he should take the part of his friend. And I OAve you both so much. To you, for the constant affection you have shown me, but more perhaps to Mr Digby for his kindness, for I have long felt that he does not like me, and that it is only to his compassion and good nature that I am indebted for the protection he has afforded me. Forgive me,\" she continued, going up to Digby and offering him her hand, \" forgive me, and bear with me a few days longer. I will en deavour to give you no fresh cause for accusing me of ingratitude.\" And Avith these words, she left the room. A short and embarrassed silence ensued, till Digby, feeling a little ashamed of himself,"], [339, "331 SIR HUBERT MARSTON. crossed over to his Avife, and sitting doAvn be side her, began negotiations for peace and for giveness, which ere long were crowned with success. Taking his hand, she said, \" You know well, dear John, that it was not for my self I was annoyed, but for that poor girl whom you treated so harshly. What has she done to offend you ? \" \" Nothing, dearest, to offend me personally, but I think in a fit of obstinacy she is throw ing away her own happiness, and I felt so an noyed at her perverseness that I dare say I said more than I ought to have done.\" \" What on earth did she mean by asking you to bear with her for a few days longer ? \" said Marston. \" I have no idea.\" \" Dear Mrs Digby, Avill you think me very impertinent if I ask you to go and see what she is about ?
