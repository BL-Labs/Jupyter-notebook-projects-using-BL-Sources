But the Name, now that it is publifh 'd, makes no al- teration in the Thoughts. Their tendency, fo far as the author of this B/fay can judge, is rather to arraign the Divine ConduSl, to make men quite uneafie and difcontented, and confeque?7tly to indifpofe them for mutual Benevolence, than to recommend Sentiments fuited to the State, in which a wife Providence has placed them. Which State is really far from being fo wrenched, as the Complaint reprefents it. This is the Reafon for fuffering thefe Remarks to fee the light, after. having lain by for many years. They had probably come outfooner, but that the author, who had fnifjed and tr.infcrib'd the whole before he had read a page of any other than the Thoughts of the brft Night, had u?iex- A 2 pecledly,"], [6, "IV peSledty, in the ye^r 1750, the whole Colleclion of the Night-Thoughts put into his hand, publiJFd that year in one volume; and found that the ninth and laft Night, intituled the Confolation, in a few lines hand fomely retraSled the complaining Doctrine of the firfl and the following feven ; in all which the Complaint was continued, though mixd with ma?iy excellent things, not well confifting with it. Tis pity t>he Gentleman did not at the fame time revoke what he had fo often, fo much out of charaSi&r, and fo inconjiftently with other parts of his Poem, deliver d concerning Fate ; deliver d i?i fuch a manner, as if he really beleivd the DoSlrine of the a?icient Fatalifb, though it is plain he does not beleive it. . The thing is indeed become too fafhionable. But neither can Poetic Licenfe authorize, nor any other thing i?i the' world be an excufe for it. When men of good character will ufe Words and Phrafes, which na turally te?id to make people beleive the DoElrine of Fate, they are altogether inexcufable ; becaufe of the Mifcheif they do to the Minds of their Readers, by the influence of their good Char abler. And this is the Reafon for retaining in this Vindication the fevere Reflections againft that DoElrine \\ when many things written againft other parts vf the Complaint were, upon fight of this Re tractation, immediately expunged, and the whole laid afide, with the view of being totally fuppref d.

The proper is: whether an Authors having re traced in a few words a very hurtful Doctrine, with all the influence and fuccefs which his CharaEler may have given it, is a fufficient Reafon for fuppreffing a copious Refutation of that Doctrine, fuppofing the Work itfelf to be tolerably well fuited to anflwer thofe good Ends, asfomewho havefeen the following Effay judge it to be.

Thus the Difpofer's Wifldom clearly fhines, In making Sufferings themfelves the Way To high Felicity. His Grace and Truth In the fupport of fuffering Virtue fhine ; And in its ample, glorious Reward. This is the Cafe. The Government is fix'd By Him, in whom all full Perfections meet. And where One abfolute Perfection is, u , There All concur, nor can they be disjoin'd. 530 Finite degrees of Power and Knowlege may Be feparate from what is Jufl and Good, As in tyrannic Governours they are. But that a Being, infinite in Power, And infinite in Wifldom too, fhou'd prove Stranger to Right or Good, with Malice fraught, Or fway'd by Envy, or Tyrannic views ; Is not in Reafon to conceive: becaufe He nothing can behold, but what is far Beneath his own moft perfect Excellence. 540 No Want or Fear can reach Him : nor can aught Tempt Him to fwerve from what is Good and Right. Nothing but what gives limits can disjoin Thefe Attributes. But Limits there are none To Knowlege, Goodnefs, or to Power, Divine; D 2 \u00b0r"], [30, "28 Or to that perfect Rectitude, which reigns Within the bofom of the One Supreme.

Thus am I affur'd, God will repay the guiltlefs fufferings Of his lov'd Offspring with a Recompenfe Outweighing far the Sorrows they endur'd. Their very Follies he'll companionate, Thofe Follies, which betray' d them into Greif ; 560 And with a willing Heart forgive the Faults Of the true Penitent.
