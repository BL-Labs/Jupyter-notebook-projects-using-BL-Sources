Right worthy she such honour, with her titles and renown ; Yes, virtue is the brightest jewel in Queen Victoria's crown.

And long live all who celebrate (by land or on the sea) With true patriotic motives, Victoria's Jubilee. Though through half her glorious reign she's shunn'd the public gaze, In robes of state you'll see her come (her veil of sorrow raise) With grateful heart to thank the Lord (for mercies without bound) Within the Grey Old Hallow'd Pile, her Majesty was crown'd. Returning thence (with radiant smiles) your Sov'reign Lady conies, Amid the sound of joyous bells, and distant bombing guns ; And now the countless crowds exult, and bless her ev'ry one, And now the solemn pageant's pass'd, your Queen's first duty's done. And peace to all who celebrate (by land or on the sea) The Roy'l Thanksgiving Service at Victoria's Jubilee. Then England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, unite you hand and heart, Wilh India and our Colonies, all nobly do your part ; Assemble at your Sov'reign's Feast, every Briton's free, And let the Loving Cup go round, with heartfeh loyalty ; Build your Temples ! raise your Towers ! and found your Institutes ! Associating with such works, the noblest of pursuits, In spreading knowledge o'er the Realm, of all sorts and degrees, Promoting British Commerce and our Native Industries.

Written in Commemoration of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Reign of Her Majesty, VICTORIA, Queen of Great Britain and Empress of India. tHE joy-bells of an Empire ring, with heavenly echoes wove, An anthem loyal millions sing, their hearts ablaze with love ; With flashing eye and soul aflame, intrenched in arm of steel, Great Britain's children \u2014 on all shores \u2014 list to its thunder-peal ! There sparkle in each country's crown gems from Saint George's Cross. Yet in the British Coronet there may be traced no loss ; For loyal hearts together cling, though seas and plains divide, And ties of blood are strong and deep as continents are wide ! The Thistle flames \u2014 the Shamrock gleams\u2014 beside the glowing Rose \u2014 As beacons to the eyes of friends \u2014 as warnings to all foes ; Who is not proud that in his veins there flows the same brave blood That fell like rain at Waterloo, or Crimean hosts withstood ? Where'er the Standard of the Crown has found a halting-place Civilization has been sown to glorify the Race ; And Education's bounteous bud has blossomed into life, To show the World that Peace has joys unknown to fields of Strife ! Across the seas are British lands, and each Colonial gem Is linked by chains of hearts into Britannia's diadem ; For whether 'mid Canadian snows \u2014 'neath India's flaming sun \u2014 Or in the wild Australian bush - All British Hearts are One ! The fibres of the British heart are firm as knotted oak ; When once their love has grown therin \u2014 when words of trust are spoke \u2014 A friendship born of confidence is drawn with every breath As boundless as the globe itself\u2014 that only dies with death ! The language of the Motherland is spoken and is sung Where'er Truth, Faith, and Loyalty are born on human tongue ; It thrills in tones of Majesty, of Honor, Peace, and Right, And God has willed that Mercy be twin-birth of Britain's Might ! All Hail ! The Queen\u2014 the faithful Wife \u2014 the Mother great and good (Most gracious in the subtle charm that crowns sweet Womanhood) ; To her bring laurels of pure love to grace her brow with bays And wish her wealth of happiness and length of golden days !
