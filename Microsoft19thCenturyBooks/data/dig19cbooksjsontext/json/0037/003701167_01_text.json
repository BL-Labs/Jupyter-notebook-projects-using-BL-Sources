It certainly is no glory to an author to be ever compelled to employ a foreign language in expressing himself to the world, for thereby he admits the vror\\d-narrowness of his own.

Are her fourty millions & \"mostly fools,\" like the \"twenty-seven millions\" of her Atlantic sister; \"pitiable heathens\" need to be \"converted;\" mere imitators with no originalities in them; \"inferior races\" created to be devoured by other races ? So thinks dilettant Criticism that does write books upon a nation which it examin ed \"at the rate of forty miles an hour ; \" Sentimental Christian ity, well-meaning doubtless, but ignorant of \" the heathen side of Truth;\" and Patriotism of egoistic kind, that does send the Gospel to save our souls, whiskeys to derange us, and gun boats to rob us. As if to mean that God despiseth His own works, and Nature is prodigal of her own products. Forty million people entrusted with the fairest of islands : \u2014 if this means nothing but passivity, receptability, and non-productiv ity, we might almost pronounce God's creation as a failure. The mere fact that we are, is enough evidence that we are here for some purpose, not wholly to be taught, but to teach as well, not wholly to receive, but to give as well. We all agree at least in so much. \"As is Nature, so is man.\" And if the Japanese are only as good as the Nature that nurture them, they must be an extraordinary people. What country of the similar magnitude is so fairly situated as Japan ? Both East and West Indies are tropical, and are good for plantations only ; no hope of poetry"], [12, "2 and ceramic art coming from them. Madagascar is essentially African ; its neighbors Kaffirs and Hottentotts, and its climate and products, not for mind and spirit. New Zealand with its austral position has yet a history to make. Only Britannia can bear comparison with Japan ; but who, if Nature is the thing in question, prefer the former to the latter? If Italy could be made an island, detached from its depredatory neighbors, that would be Japan. If New England States were magnified twice, severed from the continent, and brought some ten degrees toward the sunny south, that would be Japan. Only Httle smaller than France, and somewhat larger than Great Britain and Ireland, it is just the size for a strong compact na tion. Not its size and situation only, but its structure also is that for the best development of man's highest faculties. Of somewhat more than moderate fertility, the land can support a large population ; but seas and mountains so divide them that oppressive aggregations are impossible, and the monotony of dead plains is well avoided. We know how much of the greatness of Greece is due to its variegated geographical fea tures, and how Freedom and Equality came out of the devid ed Europe, and how the boundless Russia and the undivided China are the homes of despotism and oppression. That In telligence and Virtue may grow and develop \" mutual separa tions \" to a certain extent seem to be essential. And we find the orolographical features of Japan to be such as to fur nish such separations in abundance. \" The Festoon Island \" is continental. We are the members of the Asiatic continent, and in our mountain-systems and general trend of our exten sions, we a:e unmistakably offshoots of Asia. Yet the branch is so unlike the trunk. We are told that everything is on grand scales in Asia, \u2014 its mountains, plateaus, plains and rivers. But nothing is on grand scales in Japan. Its mountains are series of well-shaped peaks, the innumerable valleys between"], [13, "3 them are so many smiling spots, each scarce more than tens of square miles in extent, its rivers mostly torrents, and its lakes of the alpine kinds, nestled among rocks. Japan it not one piece, as most islands are. Large Madagascar is such ; Java and Sumatra are such ; Formosa is such, and even Great Britain is at most only three or four pieces. But Japan is complex as all high organisms are. Some 524 islands go into the formation of the Empire. The four largest are each of them complicated structures. Indeed, Comparative Geography shows Japan lo be essentially European in structure, though Asiatic in situation. This may explain a great deal why the Japanese out of all Asiatic nations were the first to welcome the European ideas, and how Liberty and Equality found such favors with them. Our sceneries : something must be said of these good gifts of Nature, as we do not count them as things of no prac tical value. I believe our natural sceneries are worth to us at least as much as all our ricefields, and tea-gardens, and mul berry plantations put together. The eighty-five percent of our land-surface occupied by rocky hills, volcanic cones, pebbly rivers, mountain-lakes, and ashy fields, togethe'r with large areas covered with pines, cherries and cryptomerias, \u2014 it was these unproductive parts of our land which made us more than \" pitiable heathens \" and mere eating animals. Not one of the Thirty-Six Peaks that surround the beautiful city of Kyoto is without some classic odes bestowed upon it. The Imperial Fuji is the nation's inspirer, the ideal beauty of its arts, litera ture, and morals; while the water of Biwa with its \" Eight Views \" mirrors back the purity the people have yearned after. We do not say Japan has all the best sceneries of the world. A Niagara we have not; neither do we possess a Rhine or a Matterhorn. But we challenge any country in the world, which within the area we occupy, has views and landscapes so various. Surely such surroundings of Nature cannot long"], [14, "4 exist without having them strongly impressed upon the people dwelling in their sight ; and we are only stating what every candid observer has noticed in our national character, when we say that the typical Japanese is Japan etherialized into spirit. Not the grandest of the human race, as grandeur is not the constitution of the land, but picturesque, impressionable, lova ble, yea beautiful. The Hebrew profundity and the Teutonic taciturnity may not be ours, but the Hellenic impressionability and the Italian vivacity are surely ours. Like the latter two peoples we were made to look into the bright side of Exis tence, and we believe somewhere in that direction lies our heaven-appointed mission in this world. Much is spoken of the devastations of Nature in Japan, and of their effects upon the temperament of the people. Seismology says Japan is constantly shaking more or less ; and once in about thirty-three years we are visited by terrific shakes, whereby we are made to look into the dark side of Existence somewhat. Then those Typhoons of the East In dian origin do menace us every year up to the fortieth parallel. Monsoons bring us abundant precipitations, and floods are frequent all oVer the land. \"A country of phenomenal visita tions \" you may say. Yet Italy was no better. With its Etna and Vesuvius, and Siroccos from Sahara, and Euroclydons of the Mediterranean, it has had enough of physical calamities to mourn over. But we all know what the Italian natures are. Vivacity, quickness of vision, sublime aspirations, valor, in tensities. Dante, Savonarola, Arnold of Brescia, \u2014 such are the products ofthe volcanic Italy, and something of cyclonic furies about them. The Japanese have never been the frigh tened children of Nature. Earthquakes they have learned to \"ride over\" by their light and dexterous architectures, and floods and tornadoes have had their beneficial moral effects upon them. No happier sets of people you can find under the sun than these \"Nature-stricken\" Japanese."], [15, "5 Of the ethnology of the Japanese we have heard much recently. The oldest and commonest view was that we were from the Central Asia, Altaic in origin, and came over to our present habitations through Mongolia, Southern Mantchooria, and Corean Peninsula, the natural geographical route. This they prove by the etymology of some of our current words, the grammatical constructions of the Japanese and the Corean languages, and monumental relics in Turkestan and elsewhere, which they say, bear considerable resembrance to our recent structures. Others admit considerable Malayan elements in us, say that they can recognize them in the physiognomy of some of us, that they have had degrading effects upon the pure Mongolian type. Still others go even so far as to detect some Caucasian blood in us, possibly Persian in origin, as evinced in some of us, especially among our gentler sex. All these, they say, are not yet settled, and we are yet to wait for more light upon the subject. Very interesting to Modern Science, and let those who are so inclined dive deeper into the mysteri ous subject. But for us there is no use of waiting for the con clusions of ethnologists, (which may never come), before we can form our historical estimate of the people we study about. We know what they are, and what they did, and we judge them practically, and not generalogically, as we used to judge kings and nobles. Indeed some among us were so foolish as to have brought a case before a human court, contending that the Japanese were not Mongolians, that they had nothing whatever in com mon with the pig-tail Chinese, that there are something Cauca sian in them, and that they must be treated accordingly. As if to mean that our Mongolian relationship is a sure sign of our reprobation, and dignity and greatness are the things of the Aryans only. But we maintain, with or without the Bible, that Ham was not cursed forever. The Mongolian Huns set tling in the Danube Valley, did set up a strong Christian em-"], [16, "6 pire, with its Kossuths and Bathyanis. The proud Europe has yet to learn that the sons of Sina are not to be wholly des pised, that there are something grand and permanent in them, something contributable to the World-Progress. The Mongo lians are the half of the human race, and their entrance upon the arena of world-history must be of great significance to the welfare of the whole mankind. We ourselves will get rid of the beggarly idea that we are really good-for-nothing. Yea we will believe that we are somethings, some great things, if we are not such already. In delineating our national characters, it will be well for us lo confess right frankly the things we lack in, and the quali ties we do not possess. The days we thought ourselves to be the best of mankind are no more. We know our imperfec tions to be not few, and it behooves us to meet them right manly, and learn lo be perfect thiough ways and means made known to us. Self-sufficiency, calling itself Patriotism, will not save us any more than the well-known device of the ostrich does not save it from the weapon of the hunter. I believe in no other respects are we more conspicuously deficient than in grandeur and causative originality. We have already spoken of the picturesqueness ofthe Japanese sceneries. Not that our sceneries lack entirely in grandeur. Speaking of Fuji says one well entitled to speak upon such subjects: \"I have seen almost every Alpine peak in the land of Tell ; I have viewed Monte Rosa from Zermat, Aosta, and Como ; I have gloried in the wild beauty of the Juagfrau and the precipitous heights of the Matterhorn ; but never before did I see a mountain so pure in its form, so imposing in its gran deur, so impressive in its beauty, as that at which we now gaze . . . .Surely this mountain is one of Nature's grandest works.\"* The mightiest of occeans that washes our shores is grand * Christopher Dresser, in Japan : Its Architecture, Arts, and Art- Manufactures."], [17, "7 enough ; as is also many a flaming mount that opens to our mortal views the caldron of the earth's interior. \u2014 Still we must admit that grandeur is not our chief characteristic. Our insu lar position forbids such to be the case. Ours is a garden more than a farm ; a park more than an Alpine wild. Then Japan's geographical position must have had a great deal to do with its long seclusion and narrowness of vision. Situated on the periphery of the land-hemisphere, and separat ed from its only neighbor, China, the field of ambition was necessarily small ; and it was just na'ural that the world-great ness did not come out of it. We all know that the greatness of Greece began with its foreign relations. Its world-embrac ing thoughts and actions date mostly since the Persian war. Confined to Greece, the Greeks were simply witty, artistic peo ple, no Pericles or Phidias among them yet. Japans grandeur is from to-day. But be the suture as it may, Japan's lack in grandeur is a conspicuous fact. Of thousands of its classic poems, not one is found which is worth the appellation of \"grand \" Ofthe immensities of the universe, ofthe \" Harmonies of Spheres,\" of \" the sun with thunder-march sublime,\" of \"the everabid ing earth,\" the Japanese poets had neither words nor strength to sing. It was \"Moon hanging upon a hill-top,\" or \" a torrent dashing against rocks,\" or \"birds chirping in a plumbush,\" or \"friend talking by a fire,\" or \"hearts sick with love,\" or \"smoke betokening death,\" \u2014 it was for themes like these that the Japanese poets had special aptitude and wrote immortal pieces upon. The language is miserably poor in words that convey the idea of grandeur. For such we must go to Chinese, which, on the contrary, is wonderfully rich in this respect. We have scoured through the length and breadth of our beautiful land, and laid all its flowers and mountains and rivers and lakes to contribution, but to pierce into heaven's immensities, or to penetrate into"], [18, "8 earth's depth was left to peoples other than us. As in the sphere of thought, so in that of action, the Japa nese have seldom dared out of their boundaries. The peaceful domesticity has always been the aim of their warriors and poli ticians. The word-conquest has entered into the mind of but two in their history. Enterprises of gigantic kind were always looked upon with fear and contempt. Peace was not to be sacrificed for the sake of Greatness. Movements must be con fined within their Island Empire ; and the national sentiment has never been made to acquiese in the dreams of few world men among them who thought their country too small to move their elbows freely about. The great we have had, God be thanked, and there are many signs of possibilities of Greatness in us ; but thus far, Nature and man have united to make World-Greatness failures among us. Speaking about the lack of originality in us, I am not pre pared to own that no originality whatever is in us. If by that term we mean what it should mean, namely the adelilive quality of soul, I can declare with full emphasis that the Japanese have, and have had, originality in abundance. Originality is not necessarily novelity. Edison who improved telegraphic machines is as original a man as Morse who invented them. Magellan who executed the circumnavigation of the world was as great and original a navigator as Columbus who first con ceived the idea of circumnavigation. Yet still we must grant a difference between the suggester and the suggested. Both great and original, but of different types of greatness and origi nality. And when I say the Japanese lack in originality, I mean the originality of the former kind, that of Morse and Columbus. Originality of the causative and creative kind, dar ing plunge into the deep to snatch gems and light therefrom, that rude crude business of giving shapes to chaos, \u2014 originali ty in this sense, \u2014 I am prepared to say that the Japanese had not much."], [19, "9 Here again our geographical position and structure must be partial explanations. Creative originality is concentrated grandeur, and the lack in one means the lack in the other. \u2014 Our Mongolian origin may be another explanation. Speak ing of this race it is said : \" their intellect exercises itself upon the details, but never rises to the general ideas or high specula tions of science and philosophy. Ingenious, inventive, full of sagacity for the usefull arts and the conveniences of life, the Mongolian, nevertheless, is incompetent lo generalize their application.\" Science in its true sense has had no existence within us till but very recently. See our language, what an unwieldy thing it is. The wholesale introduction of Chinese characters was an absolute necessity before we could express our own thoughts. The literature we possess is a meagre thing compared with that of any advanced nation, and even that which we possess is strong ly tinged by thoughts other than ours. In art too, our origi nal models came all from China or India. We have been rul ed by laws originally framed for other people. We have no religion of our own to speak of, and have always been zealous for any kind of faith of exotic origin. Indeed there is some thing very melancholy about this our love of novelity and \" imported articles. \" Every Chinaman or European or Ame rican who has something to say about God and Universe is sure to have some followers in this land. Buddhism of any sect, Christianism of any denomination, and Philosophism of any school, can have some disciples here. And oftentimes, religious bickerings and janglings that ought have no business outside of their own lands, are transplanted here, and some among us are so stupid as to join the respective camps, and call themselves Methodists, Presbyterians, Catholics, Quakers, and what-not, and renew among themselves the quarrels others have engendered for their own purposes. Pity that this fair land is made an \" experimental field \" for isms of all kinds."], [20, "10 Would that our receptability be not made use of in that way both by ourselves and by our neighbors who must have their views adopted by us just exactly as they do. These our lacks and weaknesses and there are and may be many more. And what nation without lacks any more than a man without imperfections? Yea our very weaknesses are often our strengths. Seldom a man with some conspicuous defects without some conspicuous superiorities over others. Let us now see wherein Japan is superior to other nations, and in what respects she is not an entire fool. If grandeur is not our conspicuous merit, then order, pru- dence, speechless industry, economy are. I believe no people in the world know how to live most comfortably with the least expense. All in all, the Japanese house-hold is one where Beauty, Economy, and Comfort are found in the fittest combi- nations. That men can live happily without forcing the ut- most from the earth, and enslaving one portion of mankind for the other, I believe we did instinctively know. That so much that goes by the name of necessity in other countries is really superfluity, that poveity there is only mental, that man can en joy God's beautiful Universe without giving the whole of him- self for his stomach, \u2014 these and much else the world might learn from the Japanese to ' its great and eternal benefit. \"Greatness in small things,\" though a weakness in the well- known case of Frederick William I. of Prussia, is itself a virtue, the lack of which often means the lack of the most lamentable kind. The people that knows how to crave a peach-kernel into a badger or a Dharma is no less gifted people lhan one that can wield marbles into a lion or a Moses. The strength of hand is one ; the dexterity of fingers is another. The nation that owns one sixth part of the fairest portions of the earth's surface, and yet so frightful a proportion of its own inhabitants are in the state of squalid poverty can scarcely be called a per- fect nation either. Small as we are, statistics and common"], [21, "11 observations go to confirm that we have the fewest poor, and they in the best condition among the world's poor. No peo ple is cleaner than we, and we the least infected of skin diseases. We make most out of Nature's bounties, and rejoice in the little that we possess. Is not this a greatness too in its own way ? It is yet to be seen how much we can do with this our \"Greatness in small things.\" Human fingers are still the very best machines that mankind do possess, and if ihe 400,000,000 dexterous fingers of the Japanese are made to be fully employ ed, we know not what prodigious revolutions they will make in industrial circles. Already our weavers are driving out the English machinists from the Orient, and the time may come when their own shores may see the fruits of our labor in this respect. Helvetia may someday have to transfer her ascenden cy in watch-making business to us, and Flanders may not long continue in her uncontested excellence in lace and tapes try. The time may come when we beat the world with the tips of our fingers. I have spoken of the peaceful domesticity as the chief aim of our people. This is worth having, and it is often a question how much of it should be sacrificed for the sake of our aggrandizement. Solomon says \"he that ruleth his spirit is bettter than he that taketh a city ;\" and he might have said also, had he known it, that \"a nation that ruleth itself well is better than one that takelh an Indian Empire,\" That idea of Poet Goethe is exquisitely beautiful that sees in a perfected family-life the ideal of perfect humanity. We do not say, of course, that we have such a family ; but we do not hesitate to say that in a nation like ours which was founded upon the family-system, we may expect to find such an ideal more near ly perfected than in nations based upon individual rights and equalities. Here man is knitted to man, not merely by duly, or that which is due, much less by common interest, but by"], [22, "12 that natural instinct of ours that seeks in our mutual fellow ship the complete satisfaction of heart's inmost yearnings, and feels pain if anything less than whole-souled devotion is con ferred upon the objects of our love and service. What other peoples have given for Right and Country and God we gave for individuals. The wife has her all in her husband. He is her Lord, her Heaven, her all. Honor or dishonor, life or death, all for his sake. She will be nothing that he might be everything. So also the servant to his master, and the son to his father. Intense devotion of man to man, \u2014 that is what has joined us together thus far, till Benthamism and other Western isms has introduced a principle of dissolution among us. Hence that idea of Loyality among us, which is some thing very much more than what it means among other peo ples. It is really the sinceresl Manworship, \u2014 a phenomenon not very common in other countiies. Our deficiency in causative originality is more than over balanced by what I might call adaptive and additive originality. If we have conceived no great ideas, we have freely opened ourselves to such from whatever directions they came. Be the Chinese Ethical Codes, Hindoo Philosophies, or Hebrew Religions, the Good, the True, the Beautiful, and the Useful, found equal welcomes in our shores. Of no people in the world can this be said more than of the Japanese that they are eager to benefit themselves by the superior attainment of every other. And they are not mere imitators. Soon they begin to assimilate what they imbibed from others, and evolve out a civilization which is essentially their own. Buddhism that was introduced to Japan early in the sixth century soon ceased to be an Indian Religion here. It is said of the Japanese Bud dhism that it is so entirely different from the Hindoo original that had Buddha himself heard it, he would hardly recognize it as anything that came out of his teachings. The Japanese fine art sprang up by ihe importation of models from India"], [23, "13 and China, and the pupils soon stripped the masters. How eager we were to learn of Europe when we first came in con tact with it through the Dutch, all the world well knows. The present generation has witnessed the miraculous birth of a na tion out of Feudalism into a Constitutional Monarchy within less than a quarter of a century, a feat wholly unparalleled in the world's history, and indicative of the peculiar aptitude of this people. The first-class learners they, but never slavish copyists and imitators, though they sometimes appear so. Foreign Propagandists are always disappointed because the chickens they hatch out of us do not resemble their parents exactly. Enough of originality here, like that of a carnivorous animal that must have other animals to make meat for them from inanimate nature, but makes flesh of its own out of the meat furnished by its prey. Our business in these chapters is to study few representa tive Japanese, and try to show the different phasis of the \" Spirit of Yamato \" that we make so much of. Enough has been written of its porcelains and lacquer-wares, of \"the Japa nese Bride \" and other stupid things. This show-loving cen tury has looked quite minutely into our vestures, and come to the conclusion that we are \"good boys\" and \"nice girls,\" and our land \"a Paradise of Children.\" And so things go, with exterritoriality and other humiliations, shameful alike to the people who bear them, and lo the \" most Christian na tions\" who would not have them removed at once. Let our worthies speak out of their graves and teach us lo be braver and more manlike, and the world to be more considerate in its dealings with one of the best of its members."], [24, "II. SAIGO TAKAMORI AND NEW JAPAN I. The Japanfse Revolution of 1868. \u25a0\\AJHEN Nippon first, at Heaven's command, arose from \u25a0Aj-^ the azure main, this was the charge to the land : \" Ni phonia, keep within thy gates. Mingle not with the world till I call thee forth.\" So she remained for two thousand years and more, her seas unplowed by nation's fleets, and her shores free from their defilement. That is a most unphilosophical criticism that condemns Japan for her long seclusion from the world. A Wisdom higher than all wisdom hath ordered it so, and the country was better for having remained so, and the world was, and is, to be better for her having been kept so. The inaccessibility to the world is not ahvays a curse to a nation. What benig nant father would have his children prematurely thrown into the world that they might come under its so-called \"civilizing influence\"? India with her comparative accessibility to the world became an easy prey to European selfishness. What did the world with Inca's empire and Montezuma's peaceful land? The condemn us for our seclusion. We open our gates, and Clives and Corteses are let upon us, Do not armed burglars do the same when they invade a well-locked house? Providence was kind therefore in locking us up from the world with seas and continents on all sides; and when Greed more than once tried to force its way into us before our ap pointed time did come, it was our genuine instinct of self-de fence that refused to open our gates to the world. Our national character was to be fully formed that the world might not swallow us up when we come in contact with it, and make of"], [25, "15 us an amorphous something without anything special to call our own. Then the world to needed further refinement, its Spanish Inquisitions French-Revolution hell-fires, and Anglo- Saxon slave-holdings, and other demoniacal ways and practices had to be done away with, before it can receive us into its membership. I think the Japanese Revolution of 1 858 signi fies a point in the world's history when the two races of man kind representing the two distinct forms of civilization were brought to honorable intercourse one with the other, when the Prospective West was given a check in its anarchic progress, and the Retrospective East was waken from its stagnant slumb er. From that time on there were to be neither Occidents nor Orients, Christians nor Heathens but all were to be one in God, humanity, and righteousness. Before Japan awoke, one part of the world turned its back to the other. By her and through her, the two were brought face to face. Japan is to solve, and is solving, the question of the right relation of Europe with Asia. So our long seclusion was to end, and men and oppor tunities were needed to bring it to an end. China and Cali fornia on the opposite banks of the Pacific opened at about the same time, there came a necessity for opening Japan to bring the two ends of the world together. This was an exter nal opportunity. Internally, the last and greatest of the Feu dal dynasties was losing its power, and the nation, tired of separation and mutual animosities within, felt, for the first time in its history, importance and desirability of union. But man makes and uses opportunities. I consider Matthew Cal braith Perry of the United States Navy to be one of the great est friend of humanity the world has ever seen. In his diaries we read that he bombarded the shores of Japan with Doxolo gies, and never with ordnance,* His mission was a delicate *See A'arrative of Expedition of the American Squadron to the Chi nese Seas and Japan, by Commondore Perry."], [26, "16 one of waking up a hermit nation without doing harm to its dignity, yet keeping its native pride at bay. His was the task of a true missionary, done by Heaven's gracious help, wilh many an invocation to the Ruler of Nations. Thrice blessed is a land that had a Christian Commodore sent to it to open it to the world. \u2014 To a Christian admiral knocking from outside, there responded a brave upright general, a \" reverer of Heaven and lover of mankind\" from within. The two never saw each other in their lives, and we never hear of one complimenting the other. Yet we their biographers do know that despite all the differences in their outward garments, the souls that dwelt in both were of the kindred stuff. Unwittingly they worked in concert, one executing what the other had initiated. So does the World-Spirit weave his garment of Destiny, underneath the vision of purblind mortals, yet wonderful to the eye of the pious history. Thus we see that the Japanese Revolution of 1868, like all healthful and permanent revolutions, had its origin in Righteousness and God-made necessity. The land that had been obstinately closed against Greed, opened itself freely to ward Justice and Equity. Self-sacrifice of the rarest kind, based upon a voice fiom the uttermost depth of soul, did fling open its doors to the world. They therefore sin against the height of Heaven who seek self-aggrandizement in this nation, as do they also who mistake its high-calling, and allow it to be trampled by the mammons of the world. II. Birth, Education, and Inspiration. The Great Saigo, as he is usually called both for his greatness and to distinguish him from the younger Saigo his brother, was born in the loth, year of Bunsei (1827) in the city of Kagoshima. A stone-monument now marks the spot where he first saw light, not far from the place where his illus trious colleague Okubo was born two years later, which is also"], [27, "17 so marked. His family no hereditary fame to boast of; only \"below middle\" in the large han of Satzuma. He was the eldest of six children, four brothers and two sisters. In his boyhood there was nothing remarkable about him. A slow, silent boy, and even passed for an idiot among his comrades. It is said his soul was first roused to consciousness of duty by witnessing one of his distant relatives committing harakiri in his presence, who told the lad just before he plunged a dagger into his belly, ofthe life that should be devoted to the cause of his master and country. The boy wept, and the impression never left him through his life. He grew up to be a big fat man, large eyes and broad shoulders very characteristic of him. \"Udo, \" the big-eyed, was the nickname they gave to him. He rejoiced in his mus cular strength, wrestling the fovourite sport with him, and liked to roam in mountains much of his time, a propensity which did not leave him till the very end of his life. His attention was early called to the writings of Wang Yang Ming, who of all Chinese philosophers, came nearest to that most august Faith, also of the Asiatic origin, in his great doctrines of Conscience and benign but inexorable Heavenly laws. Our hero's sub sequent writings show this influence to a very marked degree, all the Christianly sentiments therein contained testifying lo the majestic simplicity of the great Chinese, as well as to the greatness of the nature that could take in all that, and weave out a character so practical as his. He also delved a little into the Zen philosophy, a stoic form of Buddhism, \"to kill my too keen sensibilities,\" as he told his friends afterward. So-called European culture he had absolutley none. The broadest and most progressive of the Japanese, his education was wholly oriental. But whence came the two dominant ideas of his life, which were (i) the united Empire, and (2) the reduction of Eastern Aria? That the Yang Ming philosophy if logically followed"], [28, "18 out would lead to some such ideas is not difficult to surmise. So unlike the conservative Chu philosophy fostored by the old government for its own preservation, it (the Vang Ming Philo sophy) is progressive, prospective, and promissive. Itssimna ity to Christianity has been recognized more than once, and it was practically interdicted in the country on that and other accounts. \" This resembles Yang-Ming-ism ; disintegration of the Empire will begin with this.\" So exclaimed Takasugi Shinsaku, a Choshu strategist of the Revolutionary fame, when he first examined the Christian Bible in Nagasaki. That some thing like Christianity was a component force in the reconstruc tion of Japan is a singular fact in this part of its history. His situations and surroundings too must have helped him in forming his great projects of life. Situated in the south western corner of the country, Satzuma stood to the Europe an influence then coming all from that direction. Its pro ximity to Nagasaki was a great advantage in this respect, and we are told of foreign commerce actually carried on on some of its dependent islands long before formal permission was given thereto by the central government. But of all the outward influences that acted upon him two living men had most to be with SaigS. One was his own mas ter, Lord Saihin of Satzuma, and the other was Fujita Toko of the Mito han. That the former was no common character no one can doubt. Self-possessed and penetrating, he early saw the inevitable changes that were coming upon his country, and introduced reforms into his dominion to prepare for the crises that were near at hand. The same was he who fortified his own city of Kagoshima which it cost so much for the English fleet to break in 1863. Ihe same was also he who notwith standing his strong anti-foreign sentiments received with great respects tbe Frenchmen who visited his shore, against the re monstrance of his turbulent subjects to the contrary. \" A pacific gentleman that avoided not war if necessary, \" he was"], [29, "19 a man aster Saigo's own heart, and the subject ceased not in after years to express his dues to his great and far-seeing master. The relation between the two was that of tw ointimate friends, so near came they to each other in their views as to the future of their country. But the chief and greatest inspiration came from the mas ter spirit of Ihe time. In Fujita Toko of Mito \" the spirit of Yamato had concentrated itself.\" He was Japan etherialized into a soul. Sharp in outlines and acutely angled, the form was that of the volcanic Fuji, with the soul in it of all sincerity. An intense lover of righteousness, and an intense hater of the Western Barbarians, he drew around him the rising generation ; and Saigo, hearing of his fame at a distance, lost no oppor tunity of seeing and seeling the man when he was in Yedo with his lord. No two more congenical souls have ever met together. \" Only that youngman shall carry to posterity the plans that I now store in my bosom,\" sai I the master ofthe pupil. \"There is none to be seared under heaven except one, and that one is Master Toko,\" said the pupil of the master. The united Empire, and the extension of its dominion over the continent \"so as to enable the land to stand on equal terms with Europe,\" and the practical ways of leading the nation thereto, seem to have taken final shapes in Saigo's mind by the new influence he came under. He had now distinct ideals to live up to, and his life since then was one direct march toward the marks thus laid before him. The Revolution had its seed-thought sown in Toko's vehement mind ; but they needed transplanting to a less intense and more epuitable soul like Saigo's, that they might bring forth an actual revolution. Toko died in the earthquake of 1854 at the age of fifty, leaving his illustrious pupil to carry out the ideals first conceived in his thought. Shall we also deny to our hero a voice direct from Heaven's splendour as he roamed over his favourite mountains often times for days and nights in succession ? Did not a \" still small"], [30, "20 voice\" often tell him in silence of cryptomeria forests, that he was sent to this earth with a mission the fulfillment of which was to be of great consequence to his country and the world ? Why he mentioned Heaven so many times in his writings and conversations if not some such visitations he often had ? A slow, silent, childlike man, he seems to have been mostly alone with his own heart, where we believe he found One greater than himself and all universe, holding secret conversations with him. What cares he if the modern Pharisees call him a \"hea then,\" and dispute as to the whereabout of his soul in the suture existence 1 \" He that sollws the heavenly way abases not himself even though the whole world speaks evil of him ; neither thinks he himself sufficient even though they in union praise his name. ' \" Deal with Heaven, and never with men. Do all things for Heaven's sake. Blame not others ; only search into the lack of sincerity in us.\" \"The law is of universe and is natural. Hence he only keep it who makes it his aim to fear and serve Heaven Heaven loves all men alike. So we must love others with the love with which we love ourselves.\" (f\u00a3 .V 5\u00a3 *T h ifi< ?i- &. X A ft- $\u00a3 ~T ~< L). Saigo said these and much like these, and I believe he heard these all directly from Hea ven III. His Part in the Revolution. To write out in full SaigS's part in the Revolution would be to write the whole history of the same. In one sense we may say, I think, that the Japanese Revolution of 1868 was his revolution. Of course no one man can rebuild a nation. we will not call New Japan SaigS's Japan. That certainly is doing great injustice to many other great men who took part in this work. Indeed, in many respects Saigo had his superiors among bis colleagues. As for matters of economic re-arrangement,"], [31, "21 Saigo was perhaps the least competent. He was not for the details of internal administration as Kido and Okubo were, and Sanjo and Iwakura were far his superiors in the work of the pacific settlement of the revolutionized country. The New Empire as we have it now had not been were it not for all these men. But we doubt whether the Revolution was possible without Saigo. A Kido or Sanjo we might not have, and yet the Re volution we would have had, though perhaps not so successfully. A need there was of a primal force that could give a start to the whole movement, a soul that could give a shape to it, and drive it in the direction ordered by Heaven's omnipotent laws. Once started and directed, the rest was comparatively an easy work, much of it more drudgeries, doable by less men than he. And when we connect the name of Saig5 so intimately with the New Japanese Empire, it is because we believe him to be the starter and director of a force first generated in his big mind, and, afterward applied to the course of events then running in the soeicty wherein he himself to be. Soon after his return from the Tycoon's capital, after the all-important meeting with Toko, Saigo identified himself with the anti-Tokugawa party then gaining force in the western part ofthe country. His episode with Gessho, a learned Buddhist priest and a warm advocate of the imperial cause, marks the point in his career when his avowed aim began to be known to the public. Unable to shelter the fugitive priest, with whose custody he was entrusted, from the hot pursuit ofthe Tokugawa men, Saigo proposed death to his guest, and was accepted. They two went to the sea on a moon-lit night, \"drew maximum consolation from autumnal view,\" and then hand in hand, the two patriots plunged themselves into the sea. The splash called forth the attention of the attendants then asleep, and search for the lost began at once. Their bodies were secured, Saigo revived, bnt Gessho was not. The men who had a new empire"], [32, "22 upon his shoulders thought not his life too precious to be given away for his friend as a pledge of his affection and hospitality to him ! It was this weakness, \u2014 the weakness of \"too keen sensibility\" which he tried \"lo kill\" by his Zen Philoso phy, \u2014 that brought upon him the final destruction, as we shall see afterward. For this and other complicities in anti-Tokugawa move ments, he was twice exiled to south-sea islands. Returning to Kagoshima after its bombardment by the British fleet in 1863, he at once resumed his old course, though this time more cautiously than before. By his advice a pacific settle ment was made between Choshu and the Tokugaw Govern ment ; but a year later when the latter forced unreasonable dem ands upon the former, and their flat refusals called forth the so-called Choshu Invasion, Satzuma under Saigo's direction declined to send its quota of troops to join the expedition. This policy of Satzuma was the begining ofthe famous coalition effected between it and Choshu of so momentous import in the history of the Revolution. The total discomfiture of the in vading force, and the evident imbecility ofthe old government in its dealings with foreign affairs, precipitated its downfall much earlier than was expected ; and on the same day when the coalition secured an imperial decree for the upsetting of the tottering dynasty, the Shogun out of his own free-will laid down his authority of three centuries standing, and the rightful so vereign was reinstated in power seemingly without any opposi tion. (Nov. 14. 1867.) The occupation of the city of Kyoto by the army ofthe coalition and its allies, \" the Grand Proclamation of the Ninth Day of December,\" and the evacuation of the Nij5 castle by the Shogun, followed in rapid succession. On the 3rd. of January 1865, the war began with the battle of Fushimi. The Imperialists were entirely successful, and the Rebels, as the Tokugawa party was called from that time, retired toward the east. ' Two grand armies followed the latter,"], [33, "23 Saigo commanding the Tokaido branch. No opposition was met, and on the 4th. of April the castle of Yedo was tendered to the Imperialists. The Revolution considering its tremend ous after-effects was the cheapest ever bought. And it was Saigo who bought it so cheaply and made it so effective, his real greatness showing itself most conspicuously in these two contrary aspects of our revolution. \"The Crand Proclamation of the Ninth of December\" is comparable only to the similar proclamation of the Fourteenth of July 1790 in the French capital, in its sweeping effects upon old institutions. His self-possession was the stay of the Imperialists when the first battle was opened at Fushimi. A messenger came to him from the field and said, \"Pray send us a reenforcement. We are only one regiment, and the enemy's fire is hot upon us.' \" I will\" said General Saigo, \"when every one of you is dead upon the field.\" The messenger returned, and the enemy was repulsed. The side that had such a general cannot but win. \u2014 The Tokaido army marched up to Shinagawa, and the general was met by an old friend of his, Katzu by name, who aloneamong the Tokuagwa men saw its inevitable end, and would resign him self to sacrifice the supremacy of his master's house that his country might live thereby. \"I believe my friend is at wit's end by this time,\" says the commander of the Imperial army to the messenger from the old government. \" Only by placing yourself in my position you can understand where I am, \"re sponds the latter. The geveral bursts into a peal of laughter ; he is amused at seing his friend in distress ! His mind is now inclined toward peace. He goes back to Kyoto, and maintains against all oppositions amnesty toward the Shogun and his followers, and returns to Yedo with terms very favorable to the beleaguered party. It is said that few days before he finally made up his mind for peace, Katzu took him up to the Atago Hill for a friendly walk. Seeing \"the city of magnificent dimensions\" below his feet, the general's heart was deeply"], [34, "24 touched. He turned himself to his friend and said, \"In case we exchange arms, I believe these innocent peoples shall have to suffer on our account;\" and was silent for some moment. His \"sensibility \" moved in him ; he must have peace for those innocent ones' sake. \" The strong man is most powerful when unimpeded by the weak.\" Saigo's strength had considerable of womanly pity in it. The city was spared, peace was concluded, and the Shogun was made to lay down his arms and tender his castle to the Emperor. The Emperor reinstated in his rightful position, the count ry united under its rightful sovereign, and the new government set moving in the direction he had aimed at, Saigo retired at once to his home in Satzuma, and there for several years occupied himself mostly in drilling a few battalions of soldiers. To him the war did not end, as it did to others of his country men. Great social reforms that were yet to be introduced into the country needed force, as also for that other purpose for which in his eye the united empire was only a step. Called up to the capital, he filled the all-important office of Sangi (Chief Councilor) with other men of the revolutionary fame. But time came when his associates could follow him no longer. Hitherto they had come together because they had an aim in common ; but where they wanted to stop, he wanted to begin, and rupture came at last. IV. The Corean Affair. Saigo was too much of a moralist to go to war merely for conquest's sake. His object ofthe reduction of Easten Asia came necessarily out of his views ofthe then state ofthe world. That Japan might be a compeer with the Great Powers of Europe, she needed a considerable extention of her territorial possessions, and enough of affrontary (if I may so call it) to"], [35, "25 keep up the spirit of her people. Then too, we belive he had somehow an idea of the great mission of his country as the leader of Eastern Asia. To crush the weak was never in him ; but to lead them against the strong and so crush the proud, was his whole soul and endeavor. The single fact that his ideal hero was said to have been George Washington, and that he showed intense dislike toward Naploeon and men of his species, should be enough evidence that Saigo was never a slave of low ambitions. Yet with all his high notions of his country's situation, he would not go to war without sufficient cause for it. To do so would be against Heaven's laws that he made so much of. But when an opportunity presented itself without his own making, it is very natural that he took it as a heaven-sent one for his country to enter upon a career assigned her from the beginning of the world. Corea her nearest continental neighbor proved insolent to several ofthe Japanese envoys sent out by the new government. Moreover she showed distinct enmities against the Japanese residents there, and made a public proclamation to her people highly derogatory to the dignity of her friendly neighbor. Should such go uuheeded? argued Saigo and men of his inclination. The insolence was not yet for an open precipitation to war. But let an embassy consisting of few men of the highest rank be sent to the Peninsular Court to demand justice for her insolence; and should she still insist in her haughty attitude, and add insult, and very possibly, personal injury, to the new embassy, let that be the signal to the nation to dispatch its troops into the continent, and extend its conquest as far as Heaven would permit. And since great responsibility and utmost danger attended such an embassy, he (Saigo) himself would like to be appointed to that office. The conqueror will first lay down his life to open a way of conquest to his countrymen ! Never in History was conquest undertaken in this fashion."], [36, "26 The slow silent Saigo was all fire and activity when the question of the Corean embassy was discussed in the cabinet. He implored his colleagues to appoint him as the chief envoy, and when it was fairly settled that his request would be granted, his gladness was that of a child leaping for joy with the object of its heart's desire. Here is a letter which he wrote to his friend Itagaki (now count) by whose special endeavor the appointment was privily settled in the court. \" Itagaki Sama, I called upon you yesterday, but you were absent, and I was sent back without expressings my thanks to you. By your effort I am to have all I wished. My illness all gone now. Transposed with gladness, I flew through tbe air from Minister Sanjo's to your mansion ; my feet were so light. No more fear of 'side thrust' I suppose. Now that my aim is secured I may retire to my residence in Aoyama and wait forthe happy issue. This is only to convey my gratitude to you. Saigo.\" At this juncture, Iwakura returned with Okubo and kido from their tour around the world. They saw civilization in its centre, its comforts and its happiness. They no more thought of foreign w:ar than Saigo did of Parisian or Viennese ways of living. So resorting themselves to duplicities and ambiguities of all kinds, they in concert did all in their power to overthrow the decision reached in the cabinet council dur ing their absence, and taking advantages of Minister Sanjo's illness they suceeded at last in carrying their ways through. The Corean Embassy Act was repeated, Nov. 28, 1873. Saigo, who to all outward appearances had known no anger thus far, was now wild over the measures of the \"long-sleeved\" as he called the coward courtiers. That the act was rescinded was not what offended him most; but the way in which it was rescinded, and the motives that led thereto, were objectionable"], [37, "27 to him beyond his power of forbearance. He made up his mind that he could do nothing with the rotten government, threw his written resignation upon the cabinet-table, finished up bis residence in Tokio, and retired at once to his home in Satzuma, never again to join the government that was set up mostly through his endeavour. With the suppression of the Corean Affair ceased all the aggressive measures of the government, and its whole policies since then have been directed toward what its supporters called \"internal developement.\" And agreeably to the heart's wish of Iwakura and his \"peace-party,\" the country has had much of what they called civilization. Yet withal also came much effeminacy, fear of decisive actions, love of peace at the cost of plain justice, and much else that the true samurai does lament. \" What is civilization but an effectual working of righteousness, and not magnificience of houses, beauty of dresses, and ornamentations of outward appearances.\" This was Saigo's definition of civilization, and we are afraid civili zation in his sense has not made much progress since his time. The Corean Affair if carried throngh might have involved us in much bloodshed, and much intricacies in foreign relations ; but at the same time all the healthy effects of such an enterprise would have undoubtedly remained with us. By rejecting Saigo's project, the nation gained in things, but lost in Spirit; and which was the better ofthe two the future will judge. V. Saig5 as a Rebel. We need say but very little about this last and most lamentable part of Saigo's life. That he turned a rebel against the government of his time was a fact. What motive led him to take that position has been conjectured in many ways. That his old weakness, \" too keen sensibility,\" was the main"], [38, "28 cause of his uniting with the rebels seems quite plausible. Some five thousand youngmen who worshiped him as the only man in the world, went into an open rebellion against the government, seemingly without his knowledge, and much against his will. Their success depended wholly upon his lending his name and influence to their cause. A strongest of men, he was almost helpless before the suppliant entreaty of the needy. Twenty years ago he had promised his life to his guest as a pledge of his hospitality ; and now again he might have been induced to sacrifice his life, his honor, his all, as a pledge of his friendship to his admiring pupils. This view of things is taken by many who knew him best. That he was strongly disaffected with the government of his time needs no controversy ; but he a level-headed man should go into war for the mere sake of enmity is hard to conjecture. Are we mistaken when we maintain, that in his case at least, ihe rebellion was a result of disappointment in the grand aims of his life? Though not directly caused by him, it found him in unspeakable anguish of soul because the revolution of 1868 produced the result so contrary to his ideal. Should the rebellion chance to be a success, might he not realize yet the great dreams of his life ? Doubtingly, yet not entirely with out some hope, he united the rebels and shared with them the fate he seemed to have instinctively foreseen. But history may wait a hundred years more before it can settle this part of his life. He remained a passive figure all through the war, Kirino and others looking after all the maneuvers of the field. They fought from February to September, 1S77, and when their hopes were all shattered to pieces, they forced their way back toKagoshima, there to be buried in their \" fathers' graveyard.\" There beleaguered in the Castle Hill, all the government forces gathered at its foot, our hero was playing go in the best of spirit. Turning to one of his attendants he said, \"Ar'nt you one"], [39, "29 whose latchet of wooden shoes I mended one day, as I was returning from my farm, drawing my packhorse behind me?\" The men remembered the occasion, confessed his insolence, and sincerely asked for forgiveness. \"Nothing!\" replied Saigo, \" too much leisure made me to'poke you a little.\" The fact was, the General did yield once to the impudent demands of two youths, who, as was the custom in Satzuma, used the right ofthe samurai to have his wooden-shoes mended by any farmer he happened to meet. The farmer in this case happened to be the Great Saigo, who without a word of complaint, did the menial service, and went away in all humility. We are exceedingly thankful for this piece of reminiscence given of him by the very man who attended upon him in his last hours. Saint Aquinas was not more humble than this our Saigo. On the morning of 24th of September 1877, general assault was made upon the Castle Hill by the government force. Saigo was on the point of rising with his comrades to meet the enemy when a bullet struck his hip. Soon the little party was annihilated, and Saigo's remains fell into his enemy's hand. \"See that no rudness is done to them,\" cried one of the enemy's generals. \" What a mildness in his countenance ! \" said an other. They that killed him were all in mourning. In tears they buried him, and with tears his tomb is visited by all to this day. So passed away the greatest, and we are afraid, the last of samuiais. We have said somewhere that grandeur has not been thus far very chracteristic of Japan. Because Saigo was grand, his nation rejected him, and made a rebel out of him. Pity that he was not born on a continent ; but \"happy the isle with such a hero blest.\" I believe Providence sent Saigo to Japan as an earnest of what if had long ago decreed as her portion in future; and if in her ignorance she removed him with igno miny, she will yet welcome many like him, when she herself will expand to his grandeur. Let our hero therefore rest in"], [40, "30 peace ; for all that was grand and noble in him will ever remain as his nation's inspiration, and Ids great dreams for its destiny may yet be realized, though we hope not in the way as he in his time and associations thought as the only possible one. VI. His Ways of Living and Views of Life. History has yet to wait for the just estimate of Saigo's public service to his country ; but it bas enough materials at its command for its right views of what kind of man he really was. And if the latter aspect of his life will help much to clear up the former, I believe my readers will pardon me to dwell at some length upon his private life and opinions. First of all, we know of no man who had fewer wants of life than he. The commander-in-chief the Japanese army, the generalissimo of the Imperial Body-guard, and the most in fluential of the cabinet-members, his outward appearances were those of the commonest soldier. When his monthly income was several hundred yens, he had his enough with fifteen, and every one of his needy friends was welcome to the rest. His residence in Bancho, Tokio, was a shabby looking structure, the rent three yens a month. His usual costume was Satzuma spun coiton stuff, girdled with a broad calico obi, and large wooden clogs on his feet. In this attire he was ready to appear at any place, at the Imperial dinner-table as anywhere else. Food he would take whatsoever that was placed before him. Once a visitor found him in his residence, he and seve ral of his soldiers and attendants surrounding a large wooden bowl and helping themselves with buck-wheat macaroni cooled in the receptacle. That seemed to be his favorite banquet, eating with young fellows, himself a big child of the simplest nature. Careless about his body, careless about his possessions."], [41, "31 He gave up a fine lot of land in his possession in the most prosperous section ofthe city of Tokio to a national bank just then started, and when asked of its price, he refused to mention it; and so it remains to this day in the possession of the said corporation, worth several hundred thousand dollars. A large income from his pension was spent wholly for the support of a school which he started in Kagoshima. One of his Chiness poems reads, \" Does the world know our family law ? We leave not substance to our children.\" And so he did leave nothing to his widow and children ; but the nation took care of them, though a rebel he died. Modern Economic Science may have much to say against this ' ' carelessness \" of his. He had one hobby, and that was the dog-kind. Though he accepted nothing that was taken as a present to him, any thing that related to dogs he received with all thankfulness. Chromos, lithographs pencil-sketches of the canine tribe, were ahvays very pleasing to him. It is said that when he finished up his house in Tokio, he had a large boxful of pictures of dogs. One of his letters to Geneial Oyama was very parti cular about collars for his hounds : \" Many thanks for the specimens of the dog-collars you kindly sent me,\" he writes. \"I think they are superior to imported articles. Only if you could make them three inches longer, they would fit my pur pose exactly. Make four or five of them, I beseach you. And one more, little broader and five inches longer, I pray, etc.\" His dogs were his friends all through his life. He often spent days and nights with them in mountains. A loneliest of man, he had dumb brutes to share his loneliness. He disliked disputings, and he avoided them by all possible means. Once he was invited to an Imperial feast, at which he appeared in his usual plain costume. As he retired, lie missed his clogs left at the palace-entrance, and as he would"], [42, "32 not trouble anybody about them, he walked out barefooted; and that in a drizzling rain. When he came to the castle-gate, the sentinel called him to halt, and demanded ol him an expla nation of his person, \u2014 doubtful figure he appeared in bis com monestgarb. \" General Saigo,\" he replied. But they believed not his words, and allowed him not to pass the gate. So he stood there in the rain waiting for somebody who might identify him to the sentinel. Soon a carriage approached with Minister Iwakura in it. The barefooted man was proved to be the general, was taken into the minister's coach, and so carried away. \u2014 He had a servant, Kuma by name, a well-known figure in his modest household for many years. The latter, however, once committed an offence grave enough to have his position forfeited. But the indulgent master was solicitous about his servant's suture if discharged from his service. So he simplv* kept him in his house; but for many years gave him not a single order to be executed. Kuma survived his master many years, and was one ofthe deepest mourners for the ill-fated hero. A witness has this to say of Saigo's private life : \"I lived with him thirteen years ; and never have I seen him scolding his servants. He himself looked to the making and unmaking of his bed, to the opening and shutting of his room-windows, and to most other things that pertained to his person. But in cases others were doing them for him, he never interfered ; neither did he decline help when offered. His carelessness and entire artlessness were those of a child.\" Indeed he was so loathe lo disturb the peace of others that he often made visits upon their houses, but dared ?wl to call for notice from inside ; but stood in the entrance thereof and there wailed till somebody happened lo come out tint find him I Such his living, so low and so simple ; but his thinking was that of a saint and a philosopher, as we have had already some occasions to show."], [43, "33 \"Revere Heaven ; love people,\" summed up all his views of life. All wisdom was there ; and all arc-wisdom in love of self. What conceptions he had of Heaven ; whether he took it to be a Force or a Person, and how he worshiped it except in his own practical way, we have no means of ascertaining. But that he knew it to be all-powerful, unchangeable, and very merciful, and its Laws to be all-binding, unassailable, and very beneficent, his words and actions abundantly testify. We have already given some of his expressions about Heaven and its Laws. His writings are full of them, and we need not multiply them here. When he said, \" Heaven loveth all men alike; so we must love others with the love with which we love ourselve,\" he said all that are in Laws and Prophets, and some of us may be desirous to inquire whence he got that grand doctrine of his. And this Heaven was to be approached with all sincerity, else the knowledge of its ways was unattainable. Human wisdoms he detested ; but all wisdoms were to come from the sincerity of one's heart and purpose. Heart pure and motive high, ways are at hand as we need them, in the council-ball as on the battle-field. Pie that schemes always is he that has no schemes when crises are at hand. In his own words, \" Sinceri ty's own realm is one's secret chamber. Strong there, a man is strong everywhere.\" Insincerity, and its great child, Selfishness, are the prime causes of our failures in life. Saigo says : \" A man succeeds by overcoming himself, and fails by loving himself. Why is it that many have succeeded in eight and failed in the remaining two ? Because when success attended them, love of self grew in them ; and vigilance departing, and desire for ease returning, their work became onerous to them, and they failed.\" Hence we are to meet all the emergencies of life with our lives in our hands. \"I have my life to offer,\" he often uttered when he had some actions to propose in his re sponsible position. That entire self-abnegation was the secret"], [44, "34 of his courage is evident from the following -remarkable utter ance of his: \"A man that seeks neither life, nor name, nor rank, nor money, is the hardest man to manage. But with only such life's tribulations can be shared, and such only can bring great things to his country.\" A believer in Heaven, its laws and its time, he was also a believer in himself, as one kind of faith always implies the other kind. \"Be determined and do,\" he said, \" and even gods will flee from before you.\" Again he said : \" Of opport unities there are two kinds : those that come without our seek ing, and those that are of our own make. What the world calls oppotunity is usually the former kind. But the true opportunity comes by acting in accordance with reason, in compliance with the need of the time. When crises are at hand, opportunities must be caused by us.\" A man, therefore, a capable man, he prized above all things. \" Whatever be the ways and institutions we speak about,\" were his words, \" they are impotent unless there are men to work them. Man first ; then the working of means. Man is the first treasure, and let every one of us try to be a man.\" A \"reverer of Heaven\" cannot but be a reverer and observer of Righteousness. \" An effectual working of Right eousness \" was his definition of civilization. To him there was nothing under heaven so precious as Righteousness. His life of course, and his country even, were not more precious than that. He says : \" Unless there is a spirit in us to walk in the ways of Righteousness and fall with the country if for Right eousness' sake, no satisfactory relation with foreign powers can be expected. Afraid of their greatness and hankering after peace, and abjectly following their wishes, we soon invite their contemptuous estimate of ourselves. Friendly relations will thus begin to cease, and we shall be made to serve them at last.\" In a similar strain he says : \" When nation's honor is in any way injured, the plain duty of its government is to sol-"], [45, "35 low the ways of Justice and Righteousness even though the nation's existence is jeorpadized thereby. ***** A. government that trembles at the word war, and only makes it a business to buy slothful peace, should be called a commercial regulator, and it should not be called a government.\" And the man who uttered these words was the object of universal esteem by all the ambassadors of the foreign courts then represented in our capital. None esteemed him more than Sir Harry Parkes of her Brittanic Majesty's Legation, who as an adept in the art of oriental diplomacy was for a long time a shrewd upholder of of the British interests on our shores. \" Be just and fear not\" was Saigo's method of running a government as much as that of the old Hebrew prophets. \" A devout imagination \" it may be to the diplomatic science of now-a-days as of all times ; but it is Heaven's law, well worth heeding to if we at all care to be a great nation upon the earth. With such a singleness of view, he. was naturally very clear-sighted as to the outcome of the movements then going on around him. Long before the Revolution, when the new government was yet a day-dream even to many of its advocat es, it was an accomplished reality to Saigd. It is said that, when, after many years of banishment, he was sent to in his isle of exile to call him back to his old position of responsibili ty, he told the messenger, with diagrams on the beach-sand, all the maneuvers he had framed in his mind for the upbuild ing of the new empire ; and so true to the situation was the prescience then offered that the listener told his friends after wards that in his view Saigo was not a man but a god. And we have seen his perfect self-possession during the Revolution, \u2014 a natural result of his clear vision. When it had fairly began, there was much anxiety in some quarters as to the position of the Emperor in the new government, seeing that for well-nigh ten centuries his real situation had been a very"], [46, "36 undefinable one. Mr. Fukuba, a well-known court poet, asked Saigo on this wise : \"The Revolution I desire to have; but when the new government is set up, where shall we place our holy Em peror ? \" To which Saigo's plainest reply was as follows : \"In the new government we shall place the Emperor where he should be; that is, made him personally see to the affairs ofthe state, and so fulfill his heaven-appointed mission.\" No tortuosities in this man. Short, straight, clear as sun light, as the ways of Righteousness always are. Saigo left us no books. But he left us many poems, and several essays. Through these occasional effusions of his, we catch glimpses of his internal state, and we find it to be the same as was reflected in all his actions. Pedantry there is not in all his writings. Unlike many Japanese scholars of his degree of attainment, his words and similies are the simplest that can be imagined. For instance, can anything be simpler than this : \" Hairs I have of thousand strings, Darker than the lac. A heart I have an inch long, Whiter than the snow. My hairs may divided be, My heart shall never be.\" Or this, very characteristic of him : \" Only one way, ' Yea and Nay,' Heart ever of steel and iron. Poverty makes great men ; Deeds are born in distress. Through snow, plums are white ; Through frosts, maples are red. If but Heaven's will be known, Who shall seek for slothful ease I \""], [47, "37 The following bit of a mountain-song of his is perfectly natural to him : \" Land high, mountains deep, Quietness is that of night. I hear not human voice, But look only at skies.\" We have space here only for a part of his essey entitled '.' On the Production of Wealth.\" \" In the book of ' Sa-den ' it is written, ' Virtue is a source of which Wealth is an outcome.' Virtue prospers, and Wealth comes by itself. Virtue declines, and in the same proportion Wealth diminishes. For Wealth is by replenishing the land and giving peace to the people. The small man aims at pro fiting himself; the great man, at profiting the people. One is selfishness, and it decays. The other is public-spirited ness, and it prospers. According as you use your substance, you have Prosperity or Decay, Abundance or Poverty, Rise or Fall, Life or Death. Should we not be on our guard there fore ? \" The world says ' Take and you shall have Wealth, and give and you shall lose it.' O what an error ! I seek a com parison in Agriculture. The covetous farmer sparing of his seeds sows but niggardly ; and then sit and wait for the harvest of autumn. The only thing he shall have is starvation. The good farmer sows good seeds, and gives all his cares thereto. The grains multiply hundredfold, and he shall have more than he can dispose of. He that is intent upon gathering knows only of harvesting, and not of planting. But the wise man is diligent in planting ; therefore the harvest comes without his seeking it. ***** ***** To him who is diligent in virtue, wealth comes without his seeking it. Hence what the world calls loss is not loss, and what it calls gain is not gain. The wise man of old"], [48, "38 thought it as gain to bless and give to the people, and as loss to take from them. Quite otherwise at presest. * * * * * * * * * * \"Ah, can it be called Wisdom to walk contrary to the ways of the sages, and yet seek wealth and abundance to the people ? Should it not be called Unwisdom to walk contrary to the law (true) of profit and loss, and yet devise means to enrich the land ? The wise man economizes to give in charity. His own distress troubles him not ; only that of his people does. Hence Wealth grows to him as water gushes in spring. Blessings are rained down, and the people bathe in them. All this comes, because he knows the right relation of Wealth to Virtue, and seeks the source, and not the outcome.\" 11 An old-school economy,\" I hear our modern Benth amites say. But it was the economy of Solomon and greater than Solomon, and it can never be old so long as the Universe stands as it did nineteen centuries ago. \" There is that scat tereth, and yet increaseth ; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.\" \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness ; and all these things shall be added unto you.\" Is not SaigS's essay a fit com mentary on these divine words ? If I am to mention the two greatest names in our history I unhesitatingly name Taiko and Saigo. Both had con tinental ambitions, and the world as their field of action. In comprehensively great above all their countrymen both of them were, but of two entirely different kinds of greatness. Taiko's greatness, I imagine, was somewhat Napoleonic. In him there was much of charlatan element so conspicu ous' in his European representative, though I am sure in very much smaller proportion. His was the greatness of genius, of inborn capacity of mind, great without attempt ing to be great. But not so Saigo's. His was Cromwellian, and but for the lack of Puritanism, he too was not a Puritan,"], [49, "39 I think. Sheer will-power had considerable to do in his case, \u2014 greatness of moral kind, the best kind of greatness. He tried to rebuild his nation upon a sound moral basis, in which work he partially succeeded. As we said, he was the last and greatest of samurais, \" the brightest of morning stars, ' shining back far into the night whence he came, and forth into the day he himself had ushered in, and now waiting to shine again till another cycle of haze and wranglings shall bring us back to a morning once more. But to us who killed him and live in the society he brought in, his name is precious mostly for its moral effects. New Japan was a moral product. Neither cowardice nor abject necessity did contrive it ; nor was it self-interest that originally called it into being. Let these facts be forever kept in our minds, and so reported to the world. Let Luther's Germany, Cromwell's England and Washington's America understand this. Heaven made New Japan through its own son and rever er. No equal terms, because we are rcwz-Christian people? O Heaven, they \"make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments,\" carry crucifices, wear suplises, and love to be called by men Christians, Christians. Not their Cromwells called them so, neither their Luthers, nor their Washingstons. The nation conceived in Righteousness, should it not be called a Christian nation as well ? Away with unjust treaties then. Let Saigo's Japan be free from heathenish shames. Rise Saigo, rise Cromwell, rise all the ancient lovers of Right eousness, and see that Righteousness be done in this part of the globe !"], [50, "III. UESUGI YOZAN.\u2014 A FEUDAL LORD. I. The Feudal Form of Government. vjjfs \"Kingdom of Heaven\" an impossibility upon this poor &) earth of ours? Mankind has yearned after it as a thing not wholly unreachable, and history from its very biginning seems to be a succession of some undefinable attempts for the realization of such a kingdom upon this earth. Christians have taken up the echo of the Hebrew prophets, and for the nineteen Christian centuries they ceased not to pray for the coming of such a kingdom among men. Indeed some impa tient souls among us imagined that such was possible, and History knows of no higher examples of holy courage and noble self-sacrifice than few bold attempts of making such a kingdom a practicability among the fallen sons of Adam. Savonarola's Florentine Republic, Cromwell's English Com monwealth, and Penn's \" Holy Experiment \" upon the banks of the Delaware, were few such attempts, \u2014 the noblest pieces of human valor ever enacted upon the face of the globe. Yet the ideal was but only approximately realized. With all our improved machineries of government, with Constitutions and similar parchments we ourselves seem to be as far removed from the haven as our ancestors were ten centuries ago. In deed so stationary appears our real situation that a wise man among us startles us by stating that the human species has pro gressed in only one direction, and that is downward. We did imagine some dozen years ago that a constitutional form of government would bring us into a golden age. It did come, and now our hopes are transferred to still further future, andwe"], [51, "41 are told that responsible cabinets will give us the desired bliss. But we are already losing our faith in the words of these political thaumaturgists. We are afraid they are pointing us to fata morgana, that we are never to see a kingdom of heaven realized among us by their ballot-box system. Of course tyrannies of all kind we hate and detest. We would not have a Sultan placed upon us by all means. The despotic tyranny is now known only under the Tropics, and even there it will be soon done away with. But it isa foolish ness to imagine that tyranny of any sort can make no entrance into the ballot-box. Tyranny is among us so long as we are in league with devils, and it will not cease to exist among us till the last-named gentlemen are driven out entirely from our midst. Hence we say, of the two kinds of tyranny mankind has suffered from, namely the despotitic kind and the ballot box kind, the latter is only the lesser of two evils, and no more. The better or the best is yet to come, though when and how we are cautioned not to utter. But let us all believe, and that unflinchingly, that no system can take the place of Virtue. Yea more, when Virtue does exist, systems are hinderance rather than helps. \"The improved machineries '\" are intended more for binding robbers than for helping saints, and now that a Cromwell or an Akbar is bid to show no more of himself than his nose, things neces sarily move on very slowly. We consider the representative system of government to be a sort of improved police system. Rogues and rascals are well kept down thereby, but no hosts of policemen can take the place of a saint or a hero. \" Nei ther very bad nor very good \" must be said of this system. Feudalism has had its defects, and for those defects' sake we had it exchanged for Constitutionalism. But we fear the fire that was intended to burn rats burned the barn also, and together with Feudalism has gone away from us Loyality, Chivalry, and muah of manliness and humanliness connected"], [52, "42 with it. Loyality in its genuine sense is possible only when the master and the subject are in direct contact with each other. You bring a \" system \" between the two, and Loyality is not, as the master is now no more a master but a governor, and the subject no more a subject but a people. Then come wranglings for constitutional rights, and men go to parchments for settling their rights, and not to hearts as they used to in days of old. Self-sacrifice and all its beauty come when I have my master to serve, or my subject to care for. The strength of Feudalism lies in this personal nature of the relation between the governor and the governed. In its essence it is really the family system applied to a nation. In its perfected form, therefore, it can be no other than the ideal form of government, as no law or constitution is better or higher than the \" Law of Love.\" Do we not read in the best of books that in the promised kingdom of Future we sholl be called \"My people,\" that \" Thy rod and Thy staff \" shall comfort us ? So we sincerely hope that Feudalism is gone from us not for good. After few more hundred or thousand years' of constitu tional wranglings, when men shall have learnt that they are all children of one Father, and hence are brothers, we do sincerely believe that Feudalism shall return to us once more, this time in its perfect and glorified shape, and the true samurai shall be installed once more in power \"to spare the vanquished, and to crush the proud,\" and \" the law of peace to found.\" But while we are waiting for the coming of such a king dom, let us refresh ourselves by an account of something very much like it, once enacted upon this terraqueous globe, and that in heathen Japan. Yes, before Wisdom came from the West, the land did know the ways of Peace, and in their own secluded manners, \"the ways of man \" were walked in, and \"death was encountered with a hero's resolve.\""], [53, "43 II. The Man and the Work. Yozan was a mere lad of seventeen when he came to the inheritance of the territory of Yonezawa in the now province of Uzen. Born of the Akizuki family, a rather inconsiderable daimio of Kiushu, he was adopted by the Uesugi, higher in rank and large in territorial possession. But as we shall pre sently see, the adoption was a thankless priviledge on his part, as he was thus involved in responsibilities the like of which were not to be found in the whole land. The boy was recom mended by his aunt to the elder Lord of Yonezawa as \" rather reticent and meditative, filial piety very characteristic of him.\" Unlike the common sons ofthe noble, he was singularly sub missive to his tutor, Hosoi by name, who as a scholar and man of high principle, was raised to this responsible position from a state of total obscurity. The favorite story of the young pupil often repeated to him by his worthy tutor was on this wise: \"Tokugawa Yorinobu, the powerful lord of Kii, always looked with tender care upon a scar that was left upon his thigh, caused by a sharp pinch given by his teacher for some disobedience to the latter's will. ' This,' the great lord is reported to have often declared, 'is the caution my revered teacher has left on me, that on looking at it always, I may always examine myself, and be true to myself and to my people. But alas, the scar is fading with my age, and with it my vigilance too.\" The young Yozan always wept when this story was repeated to him, \u2014 a sensitiveness of the rarest occurence at the time when princes were reared in the closest seclusion, and were, as a rule, no more conscious of their duty toward their inferiors than of the reason that kept them in power and opulence. That saying of a Chinese sage \"Be ye as tender to your people as lo a wound in your body\" seemed to have impressed him to the very bottom of his heart, and the"], [54, "44 text became to him his own, and guided him in all his future dealings with his people. The man so sensitive cannot but be religiously so as well. On the day of his installment in his office, he sent in the fol lowing oath to the temple of Kasuga, his guardian god through his life : I. \"The exercises, literary and military, as I have pre scribed to myself shall I pursue without negligence. II. \" To be a father and a mother to my people shall be my first and chief endeavor. III. \"The words that follow shall I not forget day and night : ' No extravagance, no danger. ' Give in charity, but waste not.' IV. \"Inconsistencies of words with actions, injustice in Teward and punishment, unfaithfulness and indecency, \u2014 from these shall I diligently guard myself. \" The above shall I strictly observe in suture, and in case of my negligence of the same, let divine punishment overtake me at once, and the family fortune be for ever consumed. These, Uesugi, ofthe Office of Danjo. Fujiwara Harunori. The First day of the Eighth Month, ofthe Fourth Year of Meiwa (1767).\" The work this man was to face was one which no less a soul than his would dare to undertake. His adopted clan of Uesugi was in time before TaikS one of the most powerful in the whole country, holding, as it did, the large and wealthy province of Echigo, together with parts of several other pro vinces on the western coast of Japan. The clan was removed by Taiko to the Aidzu district, and its power was greatly reduced thereby. Yet it was still a powerful clan, with a revenue of over 1,000,000 koku, and was counted among the"], [55, "45 five great daimios of the country. By its siding with the anti- Tokugawa party in the battle of Sekigahara (1601) the seat of the clan was again removed, this time to the out-of-way district of Yonezawa with the reduced revenue of 300,000 koku. Then to make bad worse, the revenue was once more cut off one half, and when Yozan came to be the chief, the Uesugi was a daimio of 150,000 koku, with the subjects once supported with 1,000,000 koku, and all the habits and prac tices established upon the latter basis. We need not wonder, therefore, when we hear that the new territory scarcely sup ported the clan, that its debts amounted to millions, that taxes and exactions scared off tbe population, that penury and des titution prevailed everywhere in the district. Yonezawa is in the southern part of the province of Uzen, has no sea-coast, and in its fertility and natural resources ranked very low in the country. The whole made the case a most hopeless one, and the dissolution ofthe clan and the bankruptcy of people under its protection seemed to be inevitable in no distant future. We can well understand the extremity to which the whole clan was reduced when we hear that often-times they were un able to raise five pieces of gold by their united effort, \u2014 a state of poverty hard lo believe about a daimio who owned 750 square miles of land with a population of over 100,000. The boy Yozan's business was first to put a stop lo ibis state of things, then to restore it to something of tolerability, and if his guardian god of Kasuga would bless him more, lo make of his territory an ideal stale as laid out by philosophic sages of old. Two years after his installment in the office, he made his first entrance to his own territory of Yonezawa. It was in late Autumn when Nature lent sadness to the state of things already sad enough in themselves. As the procession passed by villages after villages, deserted, neglected, and depopulated, the sensitive heart of the young chief was deeply touched with the sights"], [56, "46 before him. It was then that his attendants observed him in his norimono diligently engaged in blowing at a charcoal fire in a little hibachi before him. \"We can serve my Lordship with good fire,\" said one of them. \" Not now,\" Yozan replied ; \"lam now learning a great lesson. What it is I will tell you afterward.\" In a hotel where the procession stopped tor the \u25a0tight, the [chief called his attendants together, and explained to them a new and valuable lesson he had learnt that after noon. He said : \"As despair took hold of me as I witnessed with my own eyes my people's miseries, my attention was called to a little charcoal fire before me that was on the point of going out. I slowly took it up, and by blowing at it gently and patiently, I succeeded in resuscitating it \u2014 to my very great satisfaction. ' May I not be able in the same way to resuscitate the land and the people that are under my care? ' This I said to myself, and hope revived within me.\" Yes, Yozan, that voice was from Heaven. In a similar way God spoke to his prophets of old, a caldron calling a peo ple to repentance, or stars betokening peace to nations. Nature has voice if we but have ears to hear. Yozan heard it because he was sincere, for such only is in league with Nature. III. The Administrative Reforms. Men are natural enemies of changes, in Japan as else where. Young Yozan must effect changes ; else salvation was impossible. But change in others must begin with change in one's own self. Naturally, finance was the first question to be settled. Only by the utmost frugality could it be restored to anything like order and credit. The chief himself would curtail his family expense of 1050 pieces of gold to 209 pieces. He would keep only nine maids in his household instead of fifty as before ; would wear nothing but cotton stuff, and would eat no more than a soup and a dish in one meal. His subjects"], [57, "47 were to be likewise economical, but not in the proportion as he himself would be. The annual allowances were reduced one half; and the savings thus realized were to be used to liquidate the accumulated debt of the clan. This state of things must continue for sixteen years before the clan could be free from its pressing obligations ! This is, however, only the negative aspect of the finance reform. \" The people's happiness is the ruler's wealth.\" As well expect an egg-plant fruit from a cucumber-vine as to look for wealth from misgoverned people.\" And no good government is possible without right men in right places. And men he would have by all means, though the hereditary nature of the Feudal government was against his democratic idea of \" a man according to his abilities.\" Out of his impoverished treasury he paid very liberally to men of abilities ; and these he placed over his people in three distinct capacities. First, there were the governor and his sub-officers, who were general super visors, \"fathers and mothers of the people,\" taking upon themselves all the duties of the general administrative affairs of the little state. To these one of his injunctions read as follows : \"The child has no knowledge of its own ; but she who mothers it understands its needs and ministers thereto, because she does this from her sincerity. Sincerity begets love, and love begets knowledge. Only be sincere, and nothing is un- attainable. As is the mother to her child, so must the officer be to his people. If but the heart that loves ihe people lies in you, you need not lament the lack of wisdom in you.\" The second class of his officers were a kind of itinerant preachers who were to teach the people in morals and cere monies, \"of filial piety, of pity toward widows and orphans, of matters of marriage, of decency in clothing, of food and ways of eating, of funeral services, of house-repairs, etc. The whole territory was divided into twelve districts (dioceses) for"], [58, "48 this purpose, each with a presiding teacher (lay-bishop) over it. These bishops were to meet twice a year for mutual con ference, and to make occasional reports to the chief of the progress of their works among the people. The third class were policemen of the strictest kind. They were to detect the people's vices and crimes, and to punish them severely for their just dues. Mercy they were to show none, and every nook and corner of villages and towns was to be carefully investigated. It was a diocese's shame to give offenders, and every preacher took upon himself responsibilities for troubles his district gave to the police. Yozan's injunc tions to the two classes of officers were as follows : \"Go wilh Zizo's mercy, ye preachers, but forget not to carry Fudo's justice within you. \"Show Emma's justice and righteous wrath, ye police ; but fail not to store Zizo's mercy in your bosom.\" The three functions together worked admirably. His general administrative policies went out through the governor and his subsidiaries. But our Lord says, \" To rule a people that is not taught is costly and ineffectual.\" And such teaching was furnished by his lay-bishops, to give \"life and warm circulation to the whole.\" But teaching without discipline is also ineffectual. Hence the strictest police system to make the teaching more effectual, and the mercy shown, more conspicu ous. The youth must have had no little insight into human nature to have enabled him to frame such a system of govern ing mankind. The new machinery was put in operation for five years without meeting any molestation from any quarter. Order began to show itself, and hopes revived of the possible resus citation ofthe despaired-of society. Then came the trial, the severest of all, under which souls weaker than Yozan's would have surely succumbed. Conservatives showed themselves, \u2014 those who love the old for its own sake, if not for their bellies'"], [59, "49 sake. Renovations of any kind are objectionable to such men. One day, seven ofthe highest dignitaries ofthe district approached the young chief with their grievances, and tried to wrest from him words for the immediate abrogation of the new system of government. The chief is silent. He would have his people judge him ; and if they object to the new administra tion, it and he would willingly give its and his places to the better and the abler. So he called the general council of all his subjects at once. Armored and weaponed they in thou sands gather in the castle and wait for the business. Mean while our Lord resorts to the temple of god Kasuga to pray for the peaceful issue of the trouble. Then he meets his beloved subjects, and asks them if in their opinions his admin istration is against Heaven's will. The governor and his associates say No. The police, one and all say No. Captains and sergeants say No. \"Different mouths with one voice \" say No. Our Lord is satisfied. Vox populi est vox deii. His mind is made up. He calls the seven before him and passes sentences upon them. Five of them had halves of their fiefs confisicated, and \"shut up within their gates for ever.\" Two of them, the head-conspirators, were dealt with according to the manners of samurai, \u2014 were \"given harakiri,'' bowel cutting, a dignified method of self-destruction ! Conservatives and grumblers thus disposed of, good began to flow in in abundance, No reform is complete till this is done. The young chief is a veritable hero notwithstanding his religiosity and sensitiveness of heart. We may now expect a prosperous reign from him."], [60, "50 IV. The Industrial Reforms. YSzan's industrial policies were two : (i) lo leave no waste places in his territory, (2) and no idlers among his people. Though not naturally fertile, he thought he could make his land give 300,000 koku instead of 150,000, by sheer industry on his and his people's part. Agriculture he encouraged therefore with his whole heart. So, few years after he assumed the government, he went through the ceremony of \"Earth- Worship \" on a grand scale. The Lord, the governor, county officers, village-officers, lay-bishops, the heads of the police, all dressed in sacerdotal robes, proceed first to the temple of Kasuga, to inform the god of their aim and purpose. The procession then marches to a piece of ground recently opened, and there with all solemnity the chief first takes up a hand plough, and strikes three times into the ground. The governor comes next, and strikes nine times. Then county-officers twenty-seven times, village-officers eighty-one times, and so on to the very \"tiller of the soil.\" The whole was a public announcement ofthe most august kind that from that time on the earth was to be sacredly handled, and all blessings of life were to be expected from it. No bad worship after all. His samurai he turned to be farmers in time of peace, and recovered thousands of acres from desolation and wilderness in that way. He ordered lacquer-trees to be extensively planted. Every samurai family was required to plant 15 nurslings in its yard ; every family other than samurai, 5 ; and every temple, 20 within its enclosure. For every one tree that was planted above the required number, the reward of twenty cents was given ; and for every one that died and was not supplanted, the fine of the same sum was required. Over one million nurs lings of this valuable plant were thus planted in his territory within a very short period, \u2014 a matter of very great consequence"], [61, "51 to the posterity. A million more of Kozu* were planted in those places which allowed no cultivation. But Yozan's chief aim was to make his territory one ofthe greatest silk-producing districts in the land. For this a fund was required which his impoverished treasury was not able to supply. He therefore cut fifty more out of the two hundred and nine pieces of gold which he had reserved for his family-expense, and did with it as much as he could to forward this industry among his people. The young chief says, \" A slender means is a large sum of long continued. \" So he continued for fifty long years till the few thousands of mulberry stocks he had commenced with propa gated themselves, and his whole territory had no more space left for them. The Yonezawa district of to-day and its splendid silk-produce testify to the patience and benevolence of its ancient chief. The Yonezawa bland now ranks highest in the market. Still waste lands remained in his territory. In a rice producing country like Japan, fertility means abundance of water-supply, and insufficient irrigation leaves large portions of land in comparative sterility. Conveyance of water through long distances seemed an impossibility with Yozan's exhausted treasury. But frugality with him meant no parsimony. \" Give in charitv, and waste not\" was his motto. When public welfare was assured of, he could think of no impossibility, for he had patience to make up the lacks in his means. So it was that the poorest of daimios projected and completed two ofthe most stupendous engineering works ever undertaken in Old Japan. One was the conduction of water for a distance of twenty-eight miles through viaducts and long and high em bankments, all of which are master-pieces of hydraulic engineer ing. The other was the turning of the water-course of a large stream through a tunnel, 1 200 feet of which was through solid * Paper-plants, Broussonetia papyrifera."], [62, "52 granite. This latter work took twenty years of Yozan's ad ministration, and is by far the most important of his services to his country. Among his subjects he had one Kuroi, a slow speechless man, passing for a good-for-nothing till the chief found out his usefulness. The man was a mathematician of the rarest ability. With his rude instruments he made careful surveys of the territory, and planned out the works which to his contemporaries appeared like real madness. He completed the first, and died while engaged in the second. The work was continued nevertheless following the plan laid out by him; and twenty years after its commencement, the tunnel was bored through from both ends, the lower section meeting the upper four feet below the latter, \u2014 a wonder of accuracy in calculation when the transit or the theodolite was an unknown instrument in the land. Deserts began to bloom, and fertility flowed in abundance into Yozan's territory. Yonezawa alone of all northern provinces knows of no draught to this very day. That nothing might escape the solicitous attention of the chief for his people's welfare, he imported improved breeds of horses, stocked ponds and streams with carps and eels, invited miners and weavers from other provinces, removed all the commercial obstructions, and endeavored to develop in every way all the resources that his territory was capable of. These with his extermination of idlers from among his people, and their conversion into useful labor, brought about changes such that the once poorest district in the land became a type of productivity near the close of his life, and has continued so ever since. Chaos by one man's sincerity was turned to order, and the earth was made to give out what it hid from the eyes ofthe unfaithful. It is yet to be seen how much Sincerity can. make out of this planet. Attended to well and sincerely, its resources seem to be still infinite, and the question of over population is not to be settled till mankind makes right use of it, and goes out to it with worshipful attitude of mind. Let"], [63, "53 Yozan and Yonezawa preach to such as are afraid of life and \u2022existence. V. The Social and Moral Reforms. One beautiful feature of the oriental knowledge is that it has never treated Economy apart from Morality. Wealth with their philosophers is always the effect of Virtue, and the two bears the relation to each other of the fruit to the tree. You manure the tree, and the fruit will surely be without your effort. You \"manure Love to the people,\" and wealth will be a necessary outcome. \"Therefore the wise man thinketh of the tree, and he hath the fruit. The small man thinketh of the fruit, and he hath it not.\" Such was the Confucianism indoc trinated into Yozan's mind by his worthy teacher Hosoi. Herein therefore lies the grandeur of all of Yozan's industrial reforms that his chief aim was to make virtuous people out of his subjects. The hedonistic view of happiness was repugnant to his idea. Wealth was to be had that all might be made \"decorous people\" thereby, for said the ancient sage \" Decorum is known only when life's necessities are had.\" Remarkably free from the conventionalities of his time, he aimed to lead his heaven-entrusted people into \"the \u2022way of man \" alike binding to the daimio and the tiller of the soil. Ten years after he came to his office, when his other reforms were fairly set a-going, he revived the clan-school long in suspense, and named it Kqjo-kwan, or the \" Institute for the Promotion of Humility,\" very expressive of the dominant Virtue he had in view. The magnitude and equipment of the school were out of all proportions to the then financial states ofthe clan, for besides having one of the greatest scholars of the day for its provost, \u2014 Hosoi Heishu, Y5zan's own tutor, \u2014 it provided many free scholarships to enable the worthy poor"], [64, "54 of his dominion to get the advantage of the high-class educa tion, For nearly a century after its establishment, the Yone zawa school continued to be a type and example to the whole country. The institute still remains, retaining its old name, and is perhaps the oldest of the kind in the land. But no administration of love is complete till it provides means for the healing of the sick, and in this as might be expected our good chief was not wanting. A medical school was started, for which two of the then notablest physicians of the country were invited to be its instructors. A botanical garden was also opened for the cultivation of medicinal plants, and pharmacy was taught and practiced on the spot with the products thus obtained. At the time when the European medical art was looked upon with fear and suspicion, Yozan caused several of his subjects to be trained in the new system by Dr. Sugita Genhaku, of great celebrity as the first Japanese physician after the Dutch method. Once convinced of its superiority over the Japanese and Chinese Medicine, he spared no expense to get all the medical apparatuses he possibly could, and deposited them in his school to be freely used in its instruction and practice. Thus fifty years before Perry's squadron appeared in the Bay of Yedo, one of the mountain districts of north Japan had the Western Medicine adopted by the general public. Yozan's Chinese education had not made a Chinaman out of him. Of his purely social reforms, we have space for but two of them. His abolition of public prostitution was in entire accord ance with his views of \"administration of love.\" To the usual objection that thus might be cut off a channel for the vile passion to spend itself, and endanger social purity in other and more heinous ways, his plain answer was, that \"if the passion is to be thus allayed, no amount of prostitution is enough for the purpose.\" He had it abolished, and"], [65, "55 could keep it abolished without any social inconvenience whatever. His instruction to the farming class, \u2014 by far the most important in his dominion, \u2014 on \"the Institution of the Com panies of Five and Ten \" (Go-ju Kumiai) is so characteristic of his ideal of the perfect state that we give it here entire, keeping ourselves as close to the original as possible. \"The farmer's mission is in Soil (g, tillage) and Mulber ries (f&, silk-raising). Diligent in these, he feeds his father and mother, wife and children, and gives his dues to the government to have its protection. But all this is possible by the mutual dependence of one upon another, for which purpose associations of some kind are necessary. Not that you have them not already, but as we hear of none that can be thoroughly depended upon, we herein institute anew the Companies of Five and Ten and the Company of Five- Villages as follows : \"I. The members of the Company of Five* should be in constant intercourse one with another, divide the joys and sorrows of each, as do the members of one and the same family. \" II. The members of the Company of Ten should have frequent intercourse one with another, _ and hear to the family* affairs of each, as do they of blood relationship. \"III. They of one village be like friends in helping and serving one another. I \"IV The villages that constitute the Company of Five Villages should help one another in time of troubles as befit true neighbors in all such cases. \"V. Be ye thus kindly disposed one toward another, and fail not. If there is one among you who is old and has no child, or is young and has no parents, or is poor and cannot adopt sons, or is widowed, or is a cripple and cannot * Only heads of families were counted. The rest the same."], [66, "56 support himself, or is sick and has no means of help, or is dead and is left without burial, or has met fire and is exposed to rain and dew, or by other calamities his family is in distress, \u2014 let any such who has no one else to depend upon be taken up by his Company of Five, and be cared for as its own. In case it lies not in the said Company's power to succor him, let his Company of Ten lend him its help. If his case is more than the latter can do for him, let his village see to the removal of his distress and possibility of his existence. Should some calamities overtake one village so that its existence is endanger ed thereby, how could its neighboring villages stand aloof without extending helps to it ? The four of the Company of Five Villages should give it willing salvation. \"VI. To encourage the good, to teach the bad, to promote temperance, to check luxury, and so to enable each to abide in his mission, \u2014 these are the aims for which these associations are. If there is one who neglects his farm, or follows not his mission and runs to other employments, or indulges in dances, theatres, banquets and other laxities, such and such like should have the peremptory admonitions first of his Company of Five, and then of Ten ; and in case he is still refractory, he should be privily reported to the village authority and receive due treatment. February, 2nd year of Kyowa (1802).\" Not much of officialism in all these; yet we declare we never have seen the like of them promulgated and put into practice in any other portion of the globe except in Yozan's dominion of Yonezawa. What is called the farmers' guild in America and elsewhere is nothing more than an industrial cooperation, with selfishness as its main motive. We should go to the Apostolic Church itself to find anything like our chief's \"Companies\" of farmers. With his polices and lay-bishops, schools and various \"instructions,\" and above all with his own example, he"], [67, "57 moulded his society of 150,000 souls to his ideals slowly but effectively. How far he succeeded in so doing can be seen by the following few extracts from an account of his dominion given by a well-known scholar, Kuranari Ryucho, who went there for the special purpose of observing \"how the saint rules his people.\" \" In Yonezawa there is what they call the Label-Market. Away from the habitations of men, by the side of public roads, sandals, shoes, fruits and other articles are exposed for sale with their prices labeled upon them, and their owners all absent. Men go there, leave the prices as marked, fetch the goods, and pass on, and nobody ever imagines of any stealing done in these markets.\" \"In Lord Yozan's government, the men highest in office are usually the poorest. R \u2014 is his prime minister, and no body can compare with him in the chiefs favor and confidence. Yet as I observed his ways of living, his food and raiment reminded me of those of a poor student.\" \"The dominion has no custom-houses and all such obstructions to free commerce on its borders, and yet no smuggling is ever attempted.\" Let not our readers imagine that we are writing here an idyl about some mythic land of unknown ages. What we write were practical realities, not yet one hundred years since they were enacted in a well-known portion of this globe; and if they are no more realities such as they were in the days of their great enactor, their after-influences are distinctively readable in the place where they were tried, and among the people who practiced them. Say not as such are practicable only under rare circumstances, therefore their recurrence is not to be expected, and their perpetuity upon this earth is impos sible. We frame our laws upon our surmise that \" men are devils ; \" and we remain always so. Yozan set out with an idea entirely opposite to ours. He believed there is godliness"], [68, "58 in men, and that with Sincerity on his part he can wake up this godliness, and make it predoniment over the devilishness in them. He believed so, acted so, and made so. \"I compare him to a coward who flees before his enemy, who reads the heroic actions of the ancient, and thinks that they are unprac ticable.\" So said Saigo Takamori, himself Yozan's great admirer ; and are we not all cowards, yea hypocrites, we who dispute about, and pray for, the kingdom of heaven, and yet believe such is actually impossible ? VI. The Man Himself. It is not fashionable in these days to make any mortals more than- common sons of Adam, especially so if such happen to be heathens, \" outside of the pale of Grace and Revelation;\" and we are often criticized for making gods out of our heroes. But perhaps of all men, our subject has the least need of having his faults and weaknesses counted up ; as he himself was more conscious of such than any of his biographers could possibly be. He was a man in the full sense of the term. Only a weak man sends in oaths to a temple on his entrance to a responsible office. It was his weakness (if we may so term it) that drove him to his guardian god when a crisis overtook him and his clan . One day while in his residence at Yedo, a roll containing the names of those subjects of his who were to be rewarded for their filial piety was sent to him for examina tion and approval. He looked it over, and ordered it to be kept in a drawer till his tutor's lecture was over. It was over, but the important business slipped from his mind. One of his attendants severely reprimanded him for the negligence that was unforgivable in a \"lord of thusands.\" The chief's shame knew no bound. There he sat immovably for the whole night in repentance, weeping, and \"could not touch his breakfast because of his shame.\" The next morning the tutor was"], [69, "59 called in, absolution was passed over his sin by a quotation from a book of Confucius, and then \"his food passed through his throat.\" Let not Historical Criticism be too harsh to a soul so sensitive as this. But nowhere do we find him in transparency and integrity of his character more than in his home and domestic relations. His frugality we have already touched upon. He kept up his cotton stuff and meagre table till the very end of his life, when the credit of his treasury was fully restored, and he had abund ance at his command. His old tatami he would not replace till further remedy became impossible ; and he was often seen patching up torn mats by pasting papers over them. His idea of home was a most exalted one. Herein he followed literally the words of the sage who said, \" He alone can rule his family who ruleth himself; and he alone can rule a nation, whose family is in right order. \" At the time when nobody doubted the right of concubinage, especially in men of his social standing, and when few daimios had less than four or five concubines, Yozan had only one who was his senior by ten years, and under the following exceptional circumstance. The lady to whom he was wedded in his minority by their parents, according to the then custom of the land, proved to be a born imbecile, and her intellect was never above that of a child of ten years of age. Her however he treated with genuine love and respect, made for her toys and dolls, and comforted her in all ways, and for twenty years of their wedded lives he never showed any dissatisfaction with his fate. His other consort was left in Yonezawa while they lived mostly in Yedo, and was never allowed the dignity he attached to his inbecile wife. The latter of course left him no children. Naturally he was a benignant father, and took strenuous efforts for the education of his children. He clearly saw the importance involved in this part of his duty, as in the hereditary system ofthe Feudal Government, his people's future happiness"], [70, "60 depended wholly upon the kind of rulers he would leave after him. His boys he trained in \" the knowledge of the poor\" that \"they might not forfeit their great mission and sacrifice it to their selfish purpose.\" That we might look a little into his ways of training his children, we give here one of many beauti ful letters he wrote to his grand-daughters. It was addressed to the eldest of them when she was leaving her paternal mansion to join her consort in the metropolis. \"Three influences make a man ; his parents, his teacher, and his master. Each unfathomable in beneficence, but the parents excel all others Our beings in this universe we owe to our parents. That this body is a part of theirs should never be forgotten. In thy service to them, therefore, com port thyself with a heart that lies not ; for if Sincerity resides there (in heart),* even though thou may'st miss the mark, thou art not far from it. Think not a thing is out of thy power because of thy lack in wisdom. (Sincerity makes up the lack thereof) The ruling of a nation may appear a stupendous task to thee. But know that the ' root ' of a nation is in its well-ordered homes. And there can be no ordered homes without the right relation of the wife to the husband. The source in disorder, how canst thou expect an ordered stream ! In thy youthful womanhood, it is very natural that thy mind is often taken up with the matters of dress.

With obedience to thy lord and husband in all quietness, may your prosperity know no end, and my daughter be honored as a virtuous woman worthy of the land that gave her birth. On My Beloved Daughter s Leaving for the Metropolis : When Spring overtaketh thee, And raiments of flow'rs thou puttest on, Forget not th' Winter thou hast had In thy father's mountain home. Harunori.\" The hard-working abstemious man enjoyed a continuous health of three-score years and ten. He had his early hopes mostly realized ; \u2014 saw his clan firmly established, his people well supplied, and his whole dominion abundantly replenished. The clan that had not been able to raise five pieces of gold by their united effort, could now raise ten thousand at a moment's notice. The end of such a man could not be anything but Peace. On the 19th. of March, the 5th. year of Bunsei (1822) he breathed his last. \"The people wept as if they had lost their good grandmother. The lamentations of all classes no pen could describe. On the day of his funeral, tens of thou sands of mourners filled the way-side. Hands clasped, and heads all bowed, deep wailings went up from them all, and even mountains, rivers, and plants, joined in the universal sorrow.\" And we too, with our improved machineries of govern ment, with Bentham-and-Mill economics, with Philosophical Criticisms and \"Christian standard of Morality,\" \u2014 we too with all these and much else, miss the soul who once was a reality among us, by his \" parent's beneficence. \" What he accom plished in his life-time we never shall even though we wrangle constitutionally till the end ofthe time.

NINOMIYA SONTOK.\u2014 A PEASANT-SAINT. I. Japanese Agriculture in the Beginning of the Present Century. *i vjSGRICULTURE is the ground-basis ofthe national exis- ts tence ; \" essentially so in a country like ours, where, despite all its maritime and commercial advantages, the main support of the people comes from its soil. Natural fertility alone cannot support so immense a population upon so limited an area, \u2014 40,000,000 upon 150,000 sq. miles, only 20 per cent of which are cultivable. The land must be made to yield its maximum, and human genius and industry must be exerted to the utmost for that end. We consider the Japanese agricul ture to be the most remarkable of the kind in the world. Every clod of earth receives thoughtful manipulation, and to every plantlet that starts from the ground is given a care and attention well nigh bordering upon parental affection. Science we lacked in we supplied with strenuous industry, and as a result we have i3,ooo,ooo,acres of cultivated surface kept wilh all the nicety and perfection of market-gardens. Such a high degree of cultivation is possible only by more than ordinary industry on the people's part. Little negligence is sure to call in the desolation ofthe most unattractive charac ter. We know of nothing so disheartening as a cultivated field left by human labor. Without the vigor and luxuriance of the primitive forest, the desolation of the deserted field is that of black despair. For ten men that would dare to break up the virgin soil, not one will apply himself to recover the given-up land. While Americas invite the thrifty nations of the world, Babylon remains as a habitation of owls and scorpions."], [74, "64 In the beginning of the present century, Japanese Agricul ture was in a most lamentable state. The long-continued peace of two-hundred years brought in luxuries and dissipa tion among men of all classes, and indolence thus introduced had immediate effects upon the cultivated fields. In many places, the revenue from land decreased by two-thirds. Thist less and bushes invaded the once productive fields, and what little was left in cultivation had to bear all the feudal dues levied from the land. Villages after villages bore aspects of utter desolution. Honest labor becoming too onerous men betook themselves to dishonest ones. From the kind earth they ceased to look for her ever bounte ous gifts and by cheating and defrauding one another they sought to acquire what little they needed to sustain their ill doomed existence. The whole cause of their evils was moral, and Nature refusing to reward her ignoble sons, brought about all the miseries that befell the land. Then was born a man whose spirit was in league with Nature's laws. II. Boyhood. Ninomiya Kinjiro, surnamed Sontok (Admirer of Virtue), was born in the seventh year of Tenmei (1787). His father was a farmer of very small means in an obscure village in the province of Sagami, notable, however, among his neighbors for his charity and public spirit. At the age of 1 6, Sontok with his two little brothers was orphaned, and the conference of his relatives decided upon the dissolution of his poor family, and he the eldest was placed under the custody of one of his paternal uncles. Here the lad's whole endeavor was to be as little burdensome to his uncle as possible. He lamented that he could not do a man's part, and to make up what he in his youth could not accomplish in daytime, he would work till very late in midnight. Then came a thought to him that he"], [75, "65 would not grow to be an illiterate, an \"open-blind \" to the wisdoms of ancients. So he procured a copy of Confucius' Great Learning, and in the depth of night after the day's full work, he applied himself assiduously in his classic study. But soon his uncle found him in his study, sharply reprimanded him for the use of precious oil for a work from which he (the uncle) cannot derive any benefit, and see no practical good to the youth himself. Sontok considered his uncle's resentment reasonable, and gave up his study till he could have oil of his own to burn. So the next spring he broke up a little land that belonged to nobody, on the bank of a river, and there planted some rape-seed and gave all of his holidays to the raising of this crop of his own. At the end of one year, he had a large bagful ofthe seed, the product of his own hand, and received directly from Nature as a reward of his honest labor. He took the seed to a neighbouring oil-factory, had it exchanged for a few gallons ofthe oil, and was glad beyond expression that he could now resume his study without drawing from his uncle's store. Triumphantly he returned to his night-lesson, not without some hope of words of applause from his uncle for patience and industry such as his. But no ! the uncle says that the youth's time is also his, seeing that he supports him, and that he could not afford none of his men engage in so unprofitable a work as book-reading. Sontok again thinks his uncle is reasonable, follows his behest, and goes to mat weaving and sandal-making after the day's heavy work upon the farm is done. Since then, his studies were prosecuted on his ways to and from hills whereunto he was daily sent to fetch hays and fuels for his uncle's household. His holidays were his, and he was not throw them away for amusements. His experiment with the rape-seed taught him the value earnest labor, and he would renew his experi ment upon a larger scale. He found in his village a spot changed into a marsh-pond by a recent flood, wherein was a"], [76, "66 capital opportunity for him to employ his holidays for useful purposes. He drained the pond, levelled its bottom, and prepared it for a snug little rice-field. There he planted some seedlings that he picked out of the surplus usually cast away by farmers, and bestowed upon them a summer's watchful care. The autumn brought him a bag-ful (2 bushels) of golden grains, and we can imagine the joy of our orphan-boy who for the first time in his life had his life-stuff provided him as a reward for his humble effort. The crop he gathered that autumn was the fund upon which he started his eventful career. True independent man he ! He learnt that Nature is faithful to honest sons of toil, and all his subsequent reforms were based upon this simple principle that Nature rewardeth abundantly them that obey her laws. Few years afterward he left his uncle's house, and with what little grains he gathered with his own hand out of the more of refuse lands he discovered and improved in his village, he returned to his paternal cottage now deserted for many years. With his patience, faith, and industry, nothing stood in his way to convert chaos and desolation into order and pro ductivity. Declivities of hills, wastes on river-banks, road sides, marshes, all added wealth and substance to him, and before many years he was a man of no little means, respected by his entire neighborhood for his exemplary economy and industry. He conquered all things for himself, and he was ready to help others to make similar conquests for themselves. III. The Test of His Ability. His fame daily increasing, his worth was recognized by the Lord of Odawara, whose subject he was, and who as the then Prime-Minister of the Tycoon's Government, wielded an influence second to none in the Empire. So valuable a subject was not to be left buried in the obscurity of village life ; but in"], [77, "67 the society of his time whem class-distinctions were so strong, the promotion of a peasant to any position influence was possible only when he gave an unmistakable evidence o* extraordinary ability, enough to silence popular protest that was sure to be brought against any such infraction of regular social routine. The job that was selected for this purpose was of most disappointing nature to any but one of Sontok's indomitable patience. Among the feudal possessions of the Lord of Odawara were the three villages of Monoi, Yokota, and Tosho in the province of Shimotzuke, which through the neglect of several generations, had gone into fearful desolations. The three villages once counted 450 families and tendered as their annual feudal dues 4000 bags (8000 bushels) of rice to their rightful Lord. But now that the wild Nature invaded their fields, and badgers and foxes shared habitations with men, the population numbered only one-third of what it had been, and 800 bags were the utmost that could be levied from the impoverished farmers. With poverty came moral degradations, and the once thrifty villages were now dens of gamblers. Their restoration was attempted several times ; but neither money nor authority was of any avail when the villagers them selves were confirmed thieves and idlers. A more sanguine master might have determined upon the extermination of the entire population, and by the importation of new and more virtuous labor might begin to recover the field left desolate by his indolent subjects. But, these villages, if good for no other purpose, just served the purpose which the Lord of Odawara had in view. A man that could restore these villages to their original wealth and prosperity might be entrusted with the restoration of all deserted villages (which were great many) in the country ; and he that succeeded in what all before him sailed might be brought before the public as their rightful leader, and be clothed with proper authority without fear of discontent from"], [78, "68 titled classes. This was the job then which Sontok was prevailed upon by his master to undertake. The peasant declined the honor upon the ground of his humble birth and his total inability for a work of so public nature; \u2014 he a poor tiller of the soil, and the utmost he expected to accomplish in his life was the restoration of his own family-property, and that not by his ability, but by the inherited merits of his ancestors. For three long years the Lord insisted in his demand from his subject, who as persistently maintained his modesty and request for peaceful domesticity under his own thatched roof. When however the importunities of his worthy superior was no longer to be resisted, Sontok asked for a per mission to carefully examine the situation of the villages he was to revive. Thither he went upon his own feet, a distance of 130 miles, and for months remained among the people, visiting them from house to house, and carefully watching their ways of living ; made a close study of the nature of the soil, the extent of wilderness, drainage, possible means for irriga tion, etc., and gathered all the data for making his full estimate for the possible restoration ofthe deserted district. His report to the Lord of Odawara was most discouraging ; but the case was not one to be wholly given up. \" The art of love (fc: ffli) alone can restore peace and abundance to those poor people,\" said he in his report. \"Grants in money, or release from taxes will in no way help them in their distress. Indeed one secret of their salvation lies in withdrawing all monetary helps from them. Such a help only induces avarice and idolence, and is a fruitful source of dissensions among the people. Wilderness must be opened by its own resource, and poverty may be made lo rescue itself. Let my Lord be satisfied with the revenue that can be reasonably expected from his famished district, and expect no more from it. Should one tan* of such a field yield * Tan is about one-fourth of an acre."], [79, "69 two bags of rice, one bag should go to the sustenance of the people, and the other one bag to the fund for the opening-up of the rest ofthe wilderness. In this way alone was this our fruitful Nippon opened to cultivation in the days of gods. All was wilderness then ; and without any outside help, by their own efforts, with the land's own resources, they had fields, gardens, roads, and cities, as we see them now. Love, diligence, self help, \u2014 in the strict enforcement of these virtues lies the hope of these villages; and I should not wonder, if, ten years from this date, with patient application of ourselves in the work with all sincerity, we could bring them back to their original prosperity. \" Bold, reasonable, inexpensive plan ! Who will not con sent to such a plan ? Seldom was such a scheme of restoration of villages ever proposed, making moral forces prominent factors in reforms of economic kind. It was the economic application of Faith. The man had a tincture of Puritanic blood in him ; or rather he was a genuine Japanese undefiled yet by the Greatest-Happiness-Philosophy of the Occidental importation. He also found men who believed in his words, his good Lord the first of all. How did \"civilization \" change us within a hundred years or so ! The plan was adopted, and our peasant-moralist was to be the virtual governor of those villages for ten years. But sad was he to leave the restorative work of his ancestral property only half-completed. To a man of his ardent sincerity anything but a whole-souled devotion to any enterprise is sin ; and now that he undertakes a public work, his private interests are to be wholly disregarded. \"He that would save the homes of thousands can do so only at the expense of his own home,\" he says to himself. He gets his wife's consent to the sacrifice of their cherished hope, tells all of his decisions \"audibly at his ancestor's graves,\" finishes up his home, and like a man bound for another world, he lefts his native village, \" burning all ships"], [80, "70 behind him,\" and enters upon the task he so boldly guaranteed to his Lord and country-men. With the details of his \"battles with wilderness, and wildness of his people's heart,\" we will not concern ourselves at present. Of arts and policies he had scarcely none. His simple faith was this, that \"ihe sincerity of a single soul is strong enough lo move both heaven and earth.\" He denied to himself all sweet things, put on nothing but cutton stufts, never ate at his people's houses, slept only two hours a day, was in the field before any of his men was, remained there till all left, and himself endured the hardest of lots that befell his poor villagers. He judged his men with same standard with which he judged himself, \u2014 the sincerity of motives. With him the best laborer is not he that does most work, but one that works with the noblest motive. A man was recommended lo him as the hardest worker, one that did three men's work, the most affable fellow, etc. To all such recommendations our peasant-Governor was for a long time indifferent ; but when pressed by his associates for the due reward of this ' ' affable fellow,\" Sontok called the man to himself, and required of him the day's continued labor in his presence in the same way as he was reported to do before other officers. The man owned his inability to do so, and straight-way confessed the sinister motive he had in forcing himself to three-men's labor before the eyes of the attending officials. The Governor knew by his own experience the limit of a man's capability, and he was not to be deceived by such report like that. The man was punished, and sent back to the field with due admonition for his hypocrisy. Another among his laborers was an aged man, hardly equal to one man's capability. He was ahvays found working at stumps, \u2014 a toilsome job, not the kind of work that can make much show. There he would work even when others were at rest, with an evident contentment in the lot he chose"], [81, "71 for himself. \"Stump-digger \"they called him, and very little notice was taken of him. But the Governor's eyes were upon him. On a certain pay-day, when as was usual with our Governor, judgement was passed upon each laborer according to his merit and share in the work, the man who was called up for the highest honor and reward was no other than the \"stump-digger\" himself, to the great astonishment of all, and to none more than to the man himself. He was to have fifteen pieces of gold (about $75) besides his regular wages, \u2014 an immense sum of money when a laborer earned only two cents a day. \"I, my Lord,\" exclaimed the old man, \"am not worthy of even one man's hire, seeing that I am advanced in age, and am far behind others in the work I have accomplish ed. Your Lordship must be mistaken. For conscience's sake, the gold is not mine.\" \u2014 \" Not so,\" gravely remarked the Governor. ' ' You worked where no body else liked to work. Men's observations you cared not, and you aimed only at the real service to our villages. Stumps you removed cleared obstructions, and our work was greatly facilitated thereby. If I reward not such as you, by what other ways shall I carry on the work that is yet before me. The gift is from heaven to reward your honesty. Accept it with thankfulness, and use it to add comforts to your age. Nothing makes me rejoice more than the recognition of such an honesty as yours.\" The man weeps like a child, \"his sleeves wet almost to wringing.\" The whole villages are impressed. A godlike appeared among them, one that rewardeth openly the virtue that was done in secret. Oppositions he had many, but these he removed by \"arts of love.\" Once it took the patience and forbearance of three years to reconcile to him and his ways of doing, a man whom the Lord of Odawara sent as his associate. One of his villagers was an incorrigible idler, and a vehement opposer to"], [82, "72 all of his plans. The man's house was in a tottering state, and his poverty he would recount to his neighbors as a sure sign of the weakness of the new administration. It happened that a certain of the governor's household was under the man s manure-shed, which by the negligence of many years was in so rotten a state that a slight touch brought it down to the ground. The man's wrath knew no end. With a club he came out, gave a blow or two to the suppliant transgressor, and pursued after him till he reached his master's house. There in the front of the governor's gate the man stood, and recited to the hearing of a large crowd that gathered around him, the \"severe \"ills he suffered, and the governor's inability to give peace and order to the district. Sontok ordered the man to his presence, and in the mildest possible way, begged forgive ness for his servant's transgression, and continued : \"Seeing that your manure-shed was in so fragile a state, I am afraid your residence also is not in the best of conditions.\" \"You know I am a poor man,\" the man bluntly replied, \" and I am unable to repair my house.\" \"So,\" was the gentle answer of the moralist. \" How is it then if we send men to repair it for you ? Will you consent so ? \" Taken with surprise, and already a sense of shame coming over him, the man replied. \"Could I object to so kind a proposal? That is a mercy too great for me. \" He was at once sent back to his home, to pull down the old house, and to prepare the ground for the erection of the new. The next day, the governor's men appeared with all preparations for the new structure, and within a few weeks was finished one of the nicest-looking houses in the whole neighborhood. The manure-shed also was repaired, so that it could stand any man's touch. The worst of the villagers was thus brought down. Ever since none remained more faithful"], [83, "73 to the governor than this man. Tears always gushed out as he told afterward ofthe real humiliations he suffered then. Once discontent became general among the villagers and no \" art of love \" could subdue it. Our governor thought he himself was to be blamed for all such. \" Heaven punishes thus my lack in sincerity,\" he said to himself. One day he disappeared suddenly from among his people, and they all became uneasy about his whereabout. Some days after it was found that he had resorted himself to a distant Buddhist temple, there to pray and to meditate, but chiefly to fast for one-and-twenty days that he might be furnished with \"more sincerity \" in leading his people. Men were sent thither to entreat him for his speedy return, as his absence meant an anarchy among his people, who now had learnt that they could not get along without him. The term of his fasting over, he strengthened himself with a slight mess, and \"the day after his three weeks' abstinence from food he walked twenty-five miles to his villages rejoicing in his heart to hear of ihe repentance of his people.\" The man must have had an iron constitution with him. With several years' unabated diligence, economy, and above all \"arts of love,\" wilderness had fairy departed, and something like tolerable productivity began to return. The governor invited immigrants from other provinces, and them he treated with more considerations than he did the native-bom inhabitants, \" because,\" said he \"strangers need more kindness from us than our own children.\" To him the complete restoration of any district does not mean the mere return of fertility to the soil, but \"provisions enough for ten years of scarcity.\" Therein he followed literally the words of a Chinese sage who said, \"A country without nine years' provisions is in danger; and that without three years' is no country at all.\" According to the views of our peasant-saint, then, the proudest \u2022of nations of now-a-days is \"no nation at all.\" \u2014 But famine set"], [84, "74 *n before these previsions were made. The year 1833 was one of great distress to all the north-eastern provinces. Sontonk foretold the year's poor harvest when eating an egg-plant fruit in summer. He said that it tasted very much like that of autumn, an evident sign that \"the sun had already spent out its rays ofthe year.\" He at once gave orders to his people to sow millet at the rate of a tan to a family so as to supply the deficiency of the rice-crop of the year. This was done ; and the year following when scarcity reigned throughout the neighboring provinces, not a single family in the three villages under Sontok's supervision suffered from lack. \"The ways of sincerity can know beforehand.\" Our governor was a prophes as well. At the end ofthe promised ten years, the one poorest land in the empire became the most orderly, the best provided, and as far as its natural fertility went, the most productive district in the whole country. Not only were the villages made to yield the revenue of 4,000 bags of rice as in their former days of prosperity, but they had now several granaries well-filled with substantial grains to provide for many years of scarcity ; and we are glad to add that the governor himself had several thousand pieces of gold left for himself, which he was to freely use for philanthropic purposes in after years. His fame now spread far and wide, and nobles from all parts of the country sent in messengers to ask his instructions for restoration ot desolated villages in their provinces. Never before had \"sin cerity \" alone given so prominent a result. So simple, so cheap, a man with Heaven alone carl accomplish so much. The moral impressions of Sontok's first public achievement was tremendous upon the indolent community of his time."], [85, "75 III. Individual Helps. Before speaking of his other public services to his country, let me narrate here some of the friendly helps he was called upon to offer to his suffering fellowmen. Himself a wholly self-made man, he knew of no case which industry and sincer ity of heart could not bring up to independence and self respect. \"Universe moves on and on, and a stop there is not in the growth of all things around us. If but a man conform himself to this law of everlasting growth, and with it cease not to work, poverty, though he seek it, is impossible,\" So he said to group of poverty-stricken farmers who, complaining of the misgovernment of their feudal lord, were on the point of leaving their ancestral homes, and came to Sontok for his guidance and instructions. \"A hand-plough shall I give each one of you\" he continued, \"and if you adopt my way, and abide by it, I assure you, with it you can make a paradise out of your desolated field, pay back all your debts, and can rejoice once more in plenty, without seeking fortune outside of your own land.\" The men did so, accepted \" a hand-plough each \" from the saint's hand, went earnestly to work as he adviced, and in a few years got back all they had lost and more. In this God-given Universe, with kind Earth to serve him, and merciful Heaven to bless, a man with a \"hand-plough each\" can start his life, and be happy and independent. Sontok started his life so, and is now a respectable man. Why not they, and why not we ? A\" village-mayor who had lost his influence entirely with his people came to Sontok for his wisdom. The saint's answer was the simplest that could be imagined. \" Because love of self is strong in you,\" he said. \" Selfishness is of beasts ; and a selfish man is of beast-kind. You can have influence over your people only by giving yourself and your all to them.\" \" How can I do so ?\" the mayor inquired."], [86, "76 \"Sell your land, your house, your raiments, your all, -was Sontok's reply, ' ' and whatever money you get thereby contribute to the village fund, and you give yourself wholly to their service.\" No natural man can easily commit himself to so severe a procedure like this. The mayor asked for several days' delay before he could give his decision. When told that the sacrifice was altogether too much for him, Sontok said: \"I suppose you are afraid of the starva tion of your family. Think you that if you do your part, I, your adviser, know not how to do my part ? \" The man returned, and did as was instructed. His influ ence and popularity returned, at once. His lack for a time his revered instructor supplied out of his own store ; but soon the whole village came to the mayor's support, and within a short period, he was a wealthier man than before. No sacrifice with reward in view ; but reward without sacrifice is unthinkable. A rice-merchant in the township of Fujisawa, who had made a considerable fortune by selling his grains at high prices in a year of scarcety, came very near to bankruptcy by successive misfortunes that befell his family. A relative of his was an intimate acquaintance of Sontok, and the saint's wisdom was asked to devise some means for the restoration of the lost pro pert)*. Always very reluctant to confer with the people who had personal interests in view, he yielded to their request only after long importunity. His moral diagnosis of the man revealed to him at once the sole cause of the trouble. ' ' The way is to give in charity all you have left now \" Sontok said, \"and to begin anew with your bare hand.\" To his eye, ill gotten fortune is no fortune at all. A thing is ours only as we have it directly from Nature by conforming ourselves to her righteous laws. The man lost his property because it had not been originally his, and that which he had left was also \"unclean,\" and hence nothing could be done with it also."], [87, "77 Avarice cannot be made to yield itself to such a radical reform long and painful struggles. But the reputation or the moral-physician was too great to doubt the efficacy of his pre scription, and his advice was followed to the amazement, and (may we say) consternation, of all his friends and relatives. The man distributed all he had left, amounting to 700 pieces of gold ($ 3,500) among his townsmen, and he himself went to rowing, the only \" bare-hand \" trade he was acquainted with from his boyhood. We can easily imagine the moral effect of such a decision on the man's part, both upon the man him self, and upon the townsmen at large. All the bitterness against him caused by his avarice was removed at once,' and those who rejoiced in his misfortunes, now came to his help, and he was upon his oars only for a very short time. Fortune began to smile upon him this time with the good-will of all his townsmen, and we are told that his latter end was more than his beginning. Only we are sorry to hear that with age avarice returned to him, and his last days were spent in penury. Does not a book of Confucius say, \"Misery and Plappiness come not by themselves ; only men invite them \" ? Our teacher was not an easy man to approach. Strangers of whatever ranks were always repulsed a this gate with the customary oriental excuse \"lam pressed with duty.\" Only the most importunate could get a hearing from him. Should the inquirer's patience fail, the teacher would say \" My time of helping him is not come yet.\" Once we are told that a Buddhist priest who came a long distance upon his feet to get instructions for the relief of his parishioners was bluntly refused audience ; but he a patient man spread his garment upon the ground in front ofthe teacher's house, and there for three days and nights he sat, believing that by penance and pertinacity, the teacher might be induced to deign himself to give him a hearing. But Sontok was extremely wroth to hear that \"dog like\" a \" beggar-priest\" sat near his gate, and he ordered him."], [88, "78 be-gone at once and \"pray and fast for people's souls.\" Such a treatment was repeated several times before he received the priest in confidence, and this was he who in after years was to be a free recipient of his gold, wisdom, and friend ship. His friendship was ahvays very costly to get, but when once procured, nothing was so precious and lasting. He could do nothing with false insincere men. Universe and its laws were against such men, and nothing in his power or any man's power coujd rescue them from misery and degradation. Them he would first reconcile with the \" Reason of Heaven and Earth,\" and then administer unto them whatever human helps that might be absolutely necessary. \"Think not you can get anything else than cucumber-fruit when you plant cucumber. The thing a man planteth, the same he must reap also.\" \" Sincerity alone can turn Misery into Happiness ; arts and policies avail nothing.\" \"An individual soul is an in finitesimally small thing in Universe, but ils sincerity can move Heaven and Earth. \" ' ' Duty is duty irrespective of its result. \" Such and many like are the precepts with which he helped out many a struggling soul that came to him for guidance and deliverance. Thus he stood between Nature and Man, restor ing to the former them that through their moral obliquity forfeited the right she so freely bestowed upon them. What are all the wisdoms of the West that have recently flooded our soil in comparison with an evangel such as this, of our own kin and blood ! IV. Public Service at Large. His faith once worked out in the restoration of the three deserted villages in the province of Shimotsuke, and bis fame thus indubitably established, he became an object of constant interruptions by nobles from all parts of the country. He fenced himself against such intrusions by his usual blunt ways"], [89, "79 \u2022of receiving his visitors, but such as endured his \"test of faith \" were not few, and these had all the benefit of his wise councils and practical helps. During his life-time, some half a score nobles representing a wide extent of land had his services in improvement of their impoverished dominions, and the number of villages likewise benefited was innumerable. Near the end of his life his service to the nation became so invaluable that he was employed by the Central Government ; but the homely nature of his mission made him to appear in his best when he was among his own class of the poor laborers, unhampered by officialities and social conventionalities of the titled classes. The wonder is, however, that he a peasant of the meanst birth and the simplest culture should have managed himself a \"real noble\" when associated with \"men of high places. \" Naturally his own Lord of Odawara was to get most from him. The large dominion attached to the castle-town of the same name was placed under his supervision, and much of desolation and waste was recovered by his tireless industry and never-failing \" arts of love.\" The great famine of 1836 witness ed one of his most signal services to his fellowmen. When thousands of people were on point of death from starvation, he was commissioned by his Lord (then residing in Yedo) to undertake their speedy relief. Sontok hastened to Odawara, then a journey of two full days, and asked the men in authority there to hand him the key to open the castle-granary for the immediate relief of the starving people. \" Not till we have the Lord's written permission,\" was their rather contemptuous answer. \"All right, then,\" Sontok responded. \"But gentlemen, seeing that during the interval between this and the arrival of the written permission many more of our starving people shall die of hunger, I believe it behooves us as their faithful guardians that we should abstain from food as they are now doing, and should stay here in this office-room fasting till"], [90, "80 the return of your messenger. Thus we might learn some what of the nature of our people's suffering.\" Four days' fasting was too horrible to think of to those officers. The key was instantly delivered to Sontok, and the relief was effected at once. Would that all guardians of people of whatever clime at whatever time be mindful of our moralist's proposal when hunger waits at the people's door, and officiality must go through useless formalities before it can bring relief to the sufferers ! It was upon this occasion that he delivered his famous discourse upon \"the Ways of Famine-Relief in default of Means for that End.\" His chief audience was the governor of the dominion appointed by his Lord as the chief executive of the provincial government. We give here some fragments of the discourse as it is very characteristic of the man who gave it. \"That the land famishes, the granaries are empty, and the people have nothing to eat, \u2014 whose blame is this but that of the ruler himself? Is he not intrusted with Heaven's children (3z J\u00a7), and is it not his mission to lead them into good and away from evil, and so enable them to live and abide in peace ? For this service which is expected from him he is paid abundantly, and he brings up his family, and they are safe. But now that his people are reduced to hunger, he thinketh. not himself responsible for it! \u2014 Gentleman, I know of nothing under heaven so lamentable as this. At this lime, should he succeed in devising some means of relief, well ; but if not, the ruler should confess his sin before Heaven, and himself go to voluntary fasting and diet Then his sub officers, \u2014 country-officers after him, then village-officers, \u2014 they also should abstain from food and die ; for they too have neglected their duty and brought death and suffering upon the people. The moral effect of such sacrifices upon the famished people shall be evident at once. They shall say among themselves, ' The governor"], [91, "81 and his sub-officers held themselves responsible for the dis tress that is upon us when they have really nothing to blame themselves with. Starvation is upon us because of our own improvidence, luxury, and extravagance in times of abund ance. We are accountable for the lamentable end of our honored officers, and that we should now die of hunger is entirely proper.' Thus the fear of famine shall depart, and with it the fear of death also. Their mind is now at peace. Fear once gone, abundance of food-supply is within their reach. The rich may share his possessions with the poor ; or they may climb mountains, and feed upon leaves and roots. A single year's famine cannot exhaust all the rice and millet of the land, and hills and mountains have their supply of green things. The nation famishes because Fear reigns dominant in the people's mind, and depriving them of energy to seek food, causes them to die. As guns fired without shots often bring down timid birds, so men in years of scarcity are astounded with the sound of hunger and die. Therefore let the leaders of the people die first of voluntary starvation, and the fear of hunger shall be dissipated from the people's heart, and they all shall be filled and saved. I do not believe you need wait for the sacrifice of your county \u2014 and village-officers before you realize the result you aim at. I believe the sacrifice of the governor alone is enough for this purpose. This, gentlemen, is one way of saving your hungry people when you have nothing left to give them for their relief. \" This discourse ended. The governor in shame and dismay, said after a long silence, \" I should say it is impos sible to gainsay your argument.\" The sarcasm, though seriously spoken, was not of course intended to be carried into practice. The relief was effected with the same simplicity as that which characterized all his other labors, \u2014 promptness, diligence intense sympathy with the sufferer, and trust in Nature and its beneficient laws."], [92, "82 Grains and money were loaned to the suffering formers, to be paid back in instalment within five years by crops ; and be it mentioned in honor of the simple-hearted peasants thus suc cored, as well as of the good faith in which the succor was offered, that the promise was faithfully and willingly kept, not one of the 40,390 sufferers so relieved proving himself insolv ent at the end of the stipulated term ! He that is in league with Nature hastes not ; neither does he plan and work for the present alone. He places himself in Nature's current, as it were, and helps it and enhances it, and is himself helped and forwarded thereby. With Universe on his back, magnitude of works astoundeth him not. \"There are natural courses for all things,\" Sontok used to say, \" and we are to seek out Nature's ways and to conform ourselves thereto. Thus can mountains be levelled and seas be drained, and the earth itself be made to serve our purpose.\" Once he was appointed by his government to report upon some possible plans of draining the Great Marshes on the lower course of the River Ton\u00a3. If accomplished such enter prise would serve triple purposes of inestimable public benefit : it would recover thousands of acres of fertile land land from the shallow and miasmatic marsh ; would drain surplus water in time of flood, and obviate much of damage yearly done in those quarters ; and would afford a new and short passage between the river and the Bay of Yedo. The distance to be cut is three miles between the marsh and the bay, and five miles between the two main sections of the former, \u2014 in all eight miles of excavation through granite, mud-hills, and sand. The attempt has been made more than once only to be given up in despair; and the work is still there waiting for some mastermind, \u2014 a Japanese Lesseps \u2014 to carry it into comple tion. Sontok's report upon this gigantic enterprise was rather enigmatic ; but it hit the point upon which many an engineer-"], [93, "83 ing work of like magnitude made a shipwreck. \"Possible, yet impossible\" said the report : \" Possible if the natural and only possible course be adopted and followed ; but impossible because human nature in general is loathe to follow such a \u25a0course. I see the demoralization of the people of the district through which the canal is to be dug, and that must be right ed first by ' the arts of love ' as the essential preliminary to the work to be undertaken. Money spent among such people cannot but have vicious effects upon them, to say nothing of the amount of actual work accomplished thereby. But the nature of undertaking under review is such that little can be expected from either money or authority. Only a united people impelled by a strong sense of gratitude can do it. Let the government therefore apply ' the arts of love ' upon them, comfort their widows, shelter their orphans, and make a virtuous people out of the present demoralized population. Once you called forth their sincerity, the boring of mountains and cracking of rocks are according to your wishes. The way may look tortuous, but it is the shortest and most effec tive. Does not the root of a plant contain all its flowerage and fruitage ? Morality first, then work ; \u2014 you cannot place the latter before the former.\" . Most of the present-day readers may sympathize with his government that rejected so visionary a plan as this ; but who has watched the ' ' Panama scandals \" and other shames con nected with that business, and fails to see that the main cause of the failure of that gigantic enterprise was moral and not financial ? The gold that turned Colon and Panama into veritable dens of thieves lies buried there like so much rubbish, and to all practical purposes the two oceans are as yet as far apart from each other as when the first shovel of dirt was removed from the isthmus. Would that the great French engineer had something of the moral foresight of the Japanese peasant ; and instead of disbursing his six"], [94, "84 hundred millions wholly upon the work itself, had a part ol it invested upon human souls in \"arts of love,\" then who doubt that Lesseps had two canals to crown his gray hairs, instead of the disgraceful failure of one covering up the glorious success of the other ? Money can do much, but Virtue more ; and he that takes into account moral elements in forming his plan for a canal construction is not after all the most unpracti cal of men. The geographical extent of Sontok's actual accomplish ment in his life-time was not large, though considerable for man of his social position at the time of rigid class distinctions. By far the most considerable of all his achievements was the restoration of the Soma rigion in the present province of I waki, \u2014 itself a no mean district of two hundred and thirty villages, now one of the wealthiest and most prosperous in the country, The way he set himself to work in any work of magnitude was perfectly simple. He would first concentrate his whole energy upon one typical village, \u2014 usually the miserablest in the dis trict, \u2014 and by sheer dint of industry would convert it into his ways. This is usually the hardest part of the whole business. The first one village rescued, he had the base to start from for the conversion ofthe whole district. He ahvays infused a kind of missionary spirit among his peasant-converts, who were re quired to help their neighboring villagers as they themselves were helped by their teacher. With a striking example furnish ed before their very eyes, and with helps freely afforded by men under the new inspiration, the whole district was brought to adopt the same method, and the conversion was effected by a simple law of propagation. ' ' The method that can rescue a village can rescue the whole country ; the principle is just the same,\" \u2014 he used to say to his inquirers. \" Let us apply our selves devotedly to this one piece of work ; for the example may serve to save the whole nation in times to come,\" \u2014 he observed to his disciples while preparing plans for the restor-"], [95, "85 ation of few desolated villages in the Nikko district. The man was conscious of his possession of the everlasting laws of Univ erse, and no work was too difficult for him to attempt, nor too easy to require his whole-souled devotion to it. Naturally he was a hard-working man till the very close of his life which came on the ioth day ofthe Tenth Month ofthe Third Year of Ansei (1856). As he planned and worked for the distant future as well, so his works and influences still live with us. Many a smiling village of his own reconstruction witnesses to his wisdom and permanence of his plans ; while scattered through different parts of the empire are to be found societies of farmers bound by the name and teaching of this man, to perpetuate the spirit he made known to the dishear tened sons of toil. To us of the more enlightened (?) class also, is he not an evangel as well ? He that taught us by his own deed that Nature is the best of friends of man ; that with sincerity on his part Universe itself is on his side to help him ; that with a \"hand-plough\" he can be made a lord of the earth; that Virtue more than Means is a power, and that in the ' ' arts of love\" alone lies the possibility of his grandest achievement; \u2014 is not he too worthy ofthe name of a \" teacher of mankind\"? The Japanese agriculture is safe, and with it the whole nation, as long as such teachings are heeded to and practiced. Thank Heaven, the nation has had such a morality. \" He that would save the homes of thousands can do so only at the expense of his own home.\" Could his spirit be otherwise than that of Him who \"saved others and Himself cannot save ?"], [96, "V NAKAE TOJU\u2014 A VILLAGE TEACHER. I. Teaching in Old Japan. j^***V*S' \" Wks1^\"^ \u00b0^ schoonng had you in Japan before we <Ij5* Westerners came to save you ? You Japanese seem tO be the cleverest set of people among heathens, and you must have had some trainings, moral and intellectual, to make you what you have been and are. \" Such are questions, and oftentimes their tones, put to us by some civilized Westerners, when some of us appeared in their midst, right fresh from our country. To which our answer has been somewhat as follows : \"Yes, we had schooling, and a considerable of it. We believe at least eight out of the Ten Commandments we learnt from the lips of our fathers while in our mothers' laps. We knew that Might is not Right, that the Universe does not stand upon Selfishness, that Stealing is not right in whatever form it appears, that Life and Property are not after all the things we should aim at, and many other things. We had schools too and teachers, quite different from what we see in your great West and now imitated in our land. First of all, we never have thought of schools as shops for intellectual apprentice. We were sent there not so much for earning livelihood when we got finished with them, as for becoming true men, kunshi as we called, akin to gentlemen in English. Then too we were not taught on dozen different subjects at the same time. We had only two lobes of brain then as now, and not a dozen; and our old teachers thought (we think, wisely,) that we must not be crammed in with knowledge of all kinds in few couples"], [97, "87 of years. So we had no professors, one for Demonology, an other for Angelology, a third for Balrachology, and a fourth for Coleopterology. None of our teachers could boast that he had spent twenty-five years of his life upon the locust, and confess in evident sorrow ofthe finiteness of human knowledge that he really knew nothing about that insect after all. In deed, none of us was intended to be a specialist on beetles, or frogs, or science of devils. This was one good featurs of our old system of education. \" We were taught considerable in History, in Poetry, in Manners; but chiefly in Morals, and that of practical kind. Morality of speculative, or theosophical, or even of theological kind, was never forced upon us in our schools. For instance, we never troubled ourselves about a man holding the sun in the midst of heaven, or of an ass speaking human language. Our Buddhist scholars indeed, in their mountain recesses, did dis pute about the number of hairs upon the carapace ofthe fabul ous turtle, and other subjects of hair-splitting nature : but we who lived in the plains below, and had to deal with the prac tical affairs of men, were spared from conscientious scruples about these and similar questions. In a word we were never taught in theology in our schools. We had temples (churches) to resort to for that purpose, and our schools were free from sectarian wranglings often witnessed in other lands. This was another good feature of our system of education. \" Then also we were not taught in classes. The group ing of soul-bearing human beings into classes, as sheep upon Australian farms, was not known in our old schools. Our teachers believed, I think instinctively, that man (persona) is unclassifiable, that he must be dealt with personally, i.e. face to face, and soul to soul. So they schooled us one by one, each according to his idiosyncracies, physical, mental, and spiritual. They knew every one of us by his name. And as asses were never harnessed with horses, there was but little danger of the"], [98, "88 former being beaten down into stupidity, or of the latter driven into valedictorians' graves. The system of education based upon Survival-of-the Fittest principles, as the modern one seems to be, was considered to be \u00ab\u00abfittest for making gener ous, man-loving Kunshi (gentlemen). In this respect, there fore, our old-time teacher agreed with Socrates and Plato in their theory of education. \" So naturally the relation between teachers and students was the closest one possible. We never called our teachers by that unapproachable name, Professor. We called them Sensei, men born before, so named because of their prior birth not only in respect of the time of their appearance in this world, which was not always the case, but also of that of their coming to the understanding of the Truth. As such they claimed from us a highest veneration, akin to that which we were asked to show toward our parents and feudal lords. Indeed, sensei, parents, and kimi (lord) constituted the Trinity of our worship ful regard ; and the most vexing question for the Japanese youth was which he would save if the three of them were on the point of drowning at the same time, and he had ability to save but one. It was considered, therefore, a virtue of the highest kind for deshi (disciples) to lay down their lives for the sake of their sensei (master) ; while we never have heard of students dying for their professor in our modern regime of education. \"It was this our idea of relationship between sensei and deshi which made some of us to comprehend at once the intimate relation between the master and his disciples which we found in the Christian Bible. When we found written therein that the disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord : or that the good shephered giveth his life for the sheep, and other similar sayings, we took them almost instinctively as things known to us long before ; and we often wondered how those Christians whose idea of master is only"], [99, "89 professor, and of disciple, only student, how could they have \u2022comprehended these teachings of the Scripture which they came to teach unto us. So we are made to believe that our old system of education was Christian, at least in this respect ; and that our modern system, with its professorships on Demo \u25a0nology and Philosophy of Criticism, is Sunday-schools and compulsory chapel-attendance, has considerable of non-, and sometimes, ?<\u00ab-Christian elements in it. So the last often becomes the first, and vice versa, as we look at things in then true light. \" We do not maintain of course that the old was superior to the new in all respects. As we said, we had no professor ships on Demonology and Coleopterology, then, as now. These are worth knowing, as all things that relate to man and nature are. Then, when there are so many candidates for doctor's degree as at present, and professors are so costly persons to be engaged, the only possible course we can take is, of course, to adopt the Australian sheep-farm system, and to classify students, and teach them en masse. Necessity drives us to this means, and we cannot do otherwise. But we do maintain that the old was not all bad, and the new is not all good and perfect. The new is yet to be much im proved upon, and the old is yet to be much resusciated. As yet we cannot advice ourselves to give up old and owe our allegiance to the new altogether.\" So we expressed ourselves, and still we continue to express, and we were not received with much applause. They thought, that is, these Westerners did, that we were noi docile, and imitative, and pliable, as they imagined we were. That we may further maintain our \"stubbornness,\" \"non receptivity,\" and \" anti-foreignism,\" we give in this essay the life of a man whose name we revere as one of our ideal school teachers (sensei). Thereby we do mean no more than to give a clue or two to those our good friends of the West who"], [100, "90 have the education of the Japanese youths in their heart. I. Eary Years and Awakening to Consciousness. It was in the year 1608 of the Christian era, only eighj years after the battle of Sekigahara, and seven years before the fall of Osaka, when yet men's chief business was to fight, and women's to weep, and letters and philosophies were thought unworthy to be pursued by practical men of the world, that one ofthe saintliest and most advanced thinkers that Japan has ever produced was born in the province of Omi, on the west coast of the Biwa, near where the Hira rears up its rounded head, and reflects its shadow upon the glassy lake below. Brought up mostly by his grand parents, in the island of Shikoku, away from his paternal residence at Omi, he early showed singular sensitiveness unusual with one of his age, and with a son of samurai trained mostly in arts of war. It was in his eleventh year of age when a text from Confucius' Great Learning roused in him an ambition which was to shape the whole of his future career. Therein he read : From the emperor down to the commonest people, a man's chief aim is in the right ordering of his life. \" Here is this book, O Heaven be thanked,\" he then exclaimed; \"and can I not by attempting be a saint myself!\" He wept, and the impression remained with him through his life, \"Be a saint,\" \u2014 what an ambition this! But the boy was not a mere over-sensitive weakling, bent wholly upon prayers and introspection. Once a mob attack ed his grandfather's house, and he was among the first that rushed into their midst, a sword in his hand, and repelled them successfully, and ' ' then was calm as ever before. '* He was but thirteen then, \u2014 a strength surely of will-kind, and not of nervous. About the same year, he was sent to one Tenryo, a"], [101, "91 Buddhist priest of great learning, to be trained in arts of poetry and hand-writing. Of the many questions that the precocious youth put to his teacher, the following was very characteristic of him: \"You tell me,\" Toju said, \"that when Buddha was born, he pointed one hand heavenward and the other earthward, and said 'I alone, of all beings in heaven above and under the heaven, am worthy of honor. ' Is he not the proudest of men under heaven ; and how is it possible that my Reverend Master owns such as he as his ideal ? \" The boy never liked Buddhism afterward. His ideal was perfect humility, and Buddha was not such a man. When he was seventeen, he was able to oblain the complete set of Confucius' Four Books, showing the scarcity of books at the time. This whetted his appetite for learning more than ever, and he was found devoting all his stray hours upon the precious store of knowledge now in his possession. At the time, however, when the samurai's chief business was to fight, and book-reading was despiced as a work fitted only for priests and recluses, the young Toju was compelled to carry on his study in all privacy. His day-time was spent wholly upon the use of arms, and he gave himself to his books only in night-time. But his secrecy was not to remain undicover ed. One day, one of his comrades addressed him as \"Con fucius,\" in evident derision of his nightly devotion to his books, as well as of his benignant temper wholly exceptional among the rude combative youths of the time. \"You, ignoramus, you ! \" the gentle youth was now heard in in dignation. ' ' Holy Confucius is dead now* for two thou sand years. Meanest thou by that epithet to blaspheme the Saint's name, or to deride me for my love of knowledge ? Poor fellow ! War alone is not the samurai's profession, but the arts of peace as well. An unlettered samurai is a chattel, a slave. Art thou satisfied with thy being a slave ? \" Toju's"], [102, "92 thundering had its effect. The fellow owned his ignorance, and was silent ever afterward. He was now twenty-two. His good grand-parents were no more, and he had recently lost his father, with whom he had been only for a short time in his life. Adversities made him more sensitive, tearful, and compassionate. His sole concern was now his mother whom he left at Omi. He was now daily growing in fame for his learning and purity of character, and honors and emoluments were waiting for him in abundance. But to him a single woman, his mother, was weightier than all the world. She was to claim his whole attention from this time on. III. Mother-Worship. His first attempt was to call his mother to his side, and to serve his lord in the province of Iyo. In which failing he made up his mind to leave his lord, and to cling to his mother. This conclusion he reached only after severe strug gles in his mind. He prepared a letter addressed to his lord's chancellor, wherein he stated the motives that induced him in his peculiar circumstance to prefer the service of his mother to that of his lord. \"I carefully weighed the two duties in my mind,\" was one of his sayings. \" My lord can invite with salaries any number of servants such as I, but my old mother has none to depend upon except my poor self.\" His Trinitarian scruple thus disposed of, he absconded for his mother's home, leaving behind him all his possessions now amounting to considerable in grains, houses, and furnitures. He was now by his mother's side, to his entire satisfac tion ; but a means to comfort her was wholly wanting. When he reached her home, he had only a hundred mon (one sen in our present currency) left. With it he bought a little sake, and a scholar and sensei now turned himself to a pedler,"], [103, "93 and went round neighboring villages to sell out the liquor with little interest on it ; \u2014 all for his mother's sake. Also he disposed of his sword, \"the samurai's soul,\" and got ten pieces of silver for it. This he lent out to the villagers ; and the light interest coming therefrom was another source of supply to the humble existence of the little family. The master felt not the slightest shame in all these menial labors. His heaven was in his mother's smiles, and nothing was too costly to have one of these. For two years he lived in this state of menial obscurity. From what we gather from his writings, these were among the happiest years of his life. Away from his mother, he could not very well sleep at night, \" remembering her in my dreams, as I rolled myself from side to side upon my bed. \" As we shall see afterward, his whole system of morality was centred in filial duty (3\u00a3, we shall call it filialily), and lacking in this pivotal duty, he lacked in all, and hence his uneasiness. His aim of life, we know what it was ; and to be a saint, a perfect man, was grander in his eyes than to be a scholar and philo sopher. But the world needed him in the latter capacity as well, and he was finally prevailed upon to give his knowledge to the public. IV. The Saint of Omi. He was twenty-eight, when leaving his pedlery business, he opened a school in his village. Nothing was simpler then than to start a school. His own house served as a dormitory, a chapel and a lecture-hall at the same time. Confucius' image was hang up in the right place, and incenses were burnt to him with due ceremonies by the master attended by his pupils. Sciences and mathematics found no places in its curriculum. The Chinese classics, some history, poetry making and hand-writing constituted the whole of the topics"], [104, "94 then taught. A modest, unseen business, this of school teaching. Its influence was felt [only very slowly, \u2014 the work envied by angels, and despiced by the show-loving men of the world. Established there in that out-of-the-way section of the country, his life was a smooth continuity of peaceful enjoy ment to its very close. Only accidentally his name was brought to the public notice, as we shall see soon afterward. Notrietv he hated above all things. His mind to him a king dom was, and he had his all, and more than all, within himself. We hear of his taking constant interest in the affairs of his village; of his interceding for a villager prosecuted before the provincial court; of his teaching in \"the ways of man \" the very coolies who carried him in a kago ; and of few such incidents preserved by his neighbors. And such were in entire accordance with his views of life. Here is what he said \"on the accumulation of virtue : \" \" All men hate bad names, and love good names. And as small deeds unless accumulated make not names, the small man takes no thought of them. But the kunshi despices not small deeds that he meets day by day. Great deeds he also does if they come in his way; only he seeks them not. Great deeds are few, and small deeds are many. The former make names ; but the latter virtue. The world seeks great deeds, because name it loves. If done for name's sake, however, even great deeds become small. A kunshi is he who makes virtue out of many small deeds. Indeed, no deed is greater than virtue. Virtue is the source of all great deeds.\" One thing was very peculiar of his teaching. He made so much of virtue and character, and so little of letters and intellectual attainment in his pupils. Here is his idea of what a true scholar is : '.' ' Scholar ' is a name for virtue, not for arts. Literature is an art, and a man with an inborn genius for it has no dis-"], [105, "95 ficulty in becoming a man of letters. But though proficient in letters, he is not a scholar if his virtue is lacking. He is an ordinary person knowing letters. An illiterate man with virtue is not an ordinary person. He is a scholar without letters.\" For years, the teacher led a \"mute inglorious\" life, unknown save to the narrow circle in his vicinity, when pro vidence sought him out in his obscurity, and made him known to the world. A young man started from Okayama to seek out a saint in the land, whom he might own as h\\s sensei. He had no better aim in this singular search than had the magi of old in their search after the King of the Jews. On he sped toward the east, toward the capital of the country, where, he naturally thought, could be found saints, as well as kings and all other notables. He came to Omi, and there stopped at a country hotel for a night. In a room next to his, separated only by a thin partition, were two travellers, evidently of but recent acquaintance with each other. The conversation they were engaged in attracted the youth's attention. One of them, a samurai, was telling his experience on this wise : \"I had gone up to the capital on my lord's errand, and was on my way home entrusted with several hundred pieces of his gold. I usually carried them near close my body ; but on the day I reached this village, contrary to my usual custom, I fastened the purse to the saddle of the horse which I hired for the latter part of the day. I reached my hotel, and forgetful of the treasure oh the saddle, I sent the horse away with its bello, and came to the knowledge of my fearful loss only some time afterward. You can imagine of the extremity I was driven into. I knew not the name of the betid, and to seek him out was an impossibility. Or even if I could, what availed me if he had disposed of the gold already. My absence of mind was inexcusable. There was but one way left of explaining myself lo my lord. (The human life was not very costly then.) I prepared letters, one to the chancellor, and others"], [106, "96 to my relatives, and resolutely made up my mind for the last hour. \" While in this state of inexpressable anguish, now late in midnight, I heard somebody knocking hard at the hotel-door *. and I was soon intimated that a man in a cooly's raiment wanted to see me. I met him, and to my great surprise, he was no other than the bello who carried me upon his horse that same afternoon. ' Sir Samurai ' : he addressed me at once. ' I believe you left an important thing upon the saddle. I found it after I reached my home, and I came back for the purpose of handing it to you. Here it is.' So saying he placed the purse before me. I know not where I was ; ecstasy transported me. But recollecting myself, I said, ' Man, I owe my life to you. Take a fourth of this as the price of my exist ence. You are my another father.' But the cooly was im movable. ' I am not entitled to any such thing. The purse is yours, and it is entirely just that you should have it.' So saying he would not touch the gold placed before him. I forced upon him fifteen pieces, then five pieces, two pieces, and finally one piece, without success. ' As I am a poor man,' he at last said, ' pray give me 4 mon (4-hundredths of a cent) for a pair of straw-sandals, as I came all the way from my home four riis (10 miles) away for this special purpose.' The utmost I could force upon him was only two-hundred mon (2 cents), and he was on the point of going gladly away. Stopping him I said, ' Pray tell me what made you so unsel fish, so honest, so true. Never in this age have I thought of finding such an honesty upon this earth.' ' There lives in my village of Ogawa,' the poor man answered ' a man by the name of Nakae Toju who teaches us villagers, of these things. He says gain is not the aim of life, but honesty, righteousness, and ways osman. We villagers all hear him, and walk by his teachings.' \" The young man heard the story. He clapped his knee,"], [107, "97 and exclaimed, \"Here is Ihe saint I seek after. I will go to him to-morrow morning, and be made his servent and dis ciple.\" Tiie day after he proceeded at once into Ogawa Village, inquired after the saint, and found him. He confessed himself, his purpose of coming there, and humbly implored the teacher of accepting him into his discipleship. Master Toju is surprised. He is a village-teacher, and he is no man to be inquired after by a gentleman from a distant province. He as humbly declines the young samurai's request. The latter is importunate. He would not move away from his sworn master. But the teacher also is determined. The stranger must be entirely mistaken, for he (Toju) is not a sensei for any the but the village-children. Now it was a rivalry between importunity and modesty, and both determined to hold its ground to the end. As neither words nor entreaties could avail to win the masters favour, the samurai made up his mind to overcome the saint's modesty by sheer importunity. So by the entrance gate of the master's house, he spread his upper garment, and there in a posture befitting a gentleman, with swords on his side, and hands upon his knees, he sat, exposed to the sun, dews, and the comments of the passers-by. It was summer time, and mosquitoes are troublesome in those regions. But nothing could break his upright posture as well as his heart bent upon its single aim. For three days and nights, his silent request went up to the master within, without drawing from him a word of consent. It was at this time that Toju's mother, his almighty mother, interfered in the youth's behalf. Should such sincerity of request be turned away without acceptance on her son's part, thinks the mother. Might he not just as well take the youngman to his discipleship, and be more honorable for so doing than not? The master begins to reconsider the problem. What his mother thinks right must be right. He yields at last, and the samurai becomes his"], [108, "98 deshi. The same was Kumazawa Banzan, the suture financier and administrator of the powerful clan of Okayama, an intro ducer of many permanent reforms still visible in the land he superintended. Had Toju no other disciple than this man, he would yet be remembered as one of the nation's greatest benefactors. We need a separate essay for the pupil to fully appreciate the magnitude of the work now entrusted in the teacher's hand. How does Providence bring to light, Gems that like the shadows of night ! One more episode finishes up all that is worth nothing of the outward life of this silent man ; and that was a visit paid him by the Lord of Okayama, to whom Banzan, now his subject, communicated the grandeur of his master's character. Such a visit was entirely exceptional at that time of rigid class distinctions ; and when we remember that Toju was yet an unknown man, and the daimio, one of the greatest in the land, the visit was a condescension of the rarest kind, honor able alike to him who paid it, as well as to him who called it. Contrary to the expectation of the great daimio, however, he found the master and his village wholly unprepared to receive so great a guest. With his large retinues, he proceeded to the master's residence, and found him there explaining the Book of Filiality to several of the village-children. When announced that the Lord of Okayama was in for the special purpose of seeing him, he sent back the words that he liked the guest to wait for him at the house-entrance till the lecture was over. Never before the daimio received such a treatment. But there he waited, his whole retinues with him, while the teaching was going on within, as if nothing special was going on out side. The noble guest was received with no more ceremony than that due to common humanity. When asked to enter the Lord's service as his master and councillor, the teacher"], [109, "99 declined by saying that his mission was in his village, and with his mother. The utmost the Lord succeeded in this extra ordinary visitation was a consent to have his name enrolled among the master's disciples, and a promise to have his eldest son sent to Okayama in his stead. He who was so humble to a poor youngman coming for his instruction was so dignified to a prince coming in all his glory. He certainly was worthy of the name which the nation at large came to confer upon him, the Saint of Omi. He became an object of universal admiration, and many other daimios resorted to his neighbor hood for the special purpose of having his councils upon the affairs of their dominions. Before closing this .part of his otherwise very uneventful life, our Western readers would like to know of the master's relation to his wife, as they seem to judge a man more by this relation than by any other. He was a Confucian and a monogamist of the highest order. In accordance with the injunction ofthe Chinese sage, he was married at thirty. It so happened, however, that the lady who became his consort was not very remarkable for her physical beauty ; and the mother, solicitous of the disrepute his family might suffer, urged upon the remarriage, as such was not uncommon under similar circumstances. But the mildest son who would hear to almost anything that his mother wished to have done, was disobedi ent in this case, for he said, \" Even the mother's word is not in force if contrary to Heaven's laws. \" So the lady stayed with him all her life, bore to him two children, and was one of those typical Japanese wives \"who shun all honors that their husbands may be honored thereby.\" It was this spiritual beau/y of his that suggested to him an ideal womanhood as depicted in his brochure entitled \" Instructions to Women.\" Therein we read : \" The relation of man to woman is that of Heaven to Earth. Heaven is strength (virtus), and all things have their origin in it. Earth is receptive. It accepts what"], [110, "100 Heaven makes, and nurtures them. Herein is the harmony between man and his wife. The former originates, and the latter completes, etc.\" I believe Christianity itself has no objection against such a consideration toward the womankind. V. The Inward Man. His outward poverty and simplicity were out of all pro portions to his inward wealth and variety. He had a large kingdom within of which he was a perfect sovereign. His outward tranquility was nothing but the natural result of his inward satisfaction. Indeed we may say of him, as was said of another angelic man, that \"he was nine parts spirit, and only one part flesh.\" I wonder whether we with all our improved Soteriology and Eschatology are half so happy as this man was. Only very recently his works were carefully edited and collected by two of his distant disciples, and we have now before us ten good-sized Japanese volumes of his writings, the whole opening up a vista before us ofthe soul that once was a reality among us, at the time when we might almost suspect the existence of systematic thought in Japan. The books comprise a short sketch of his life, the reminiscence of his villagers about him, his commentaries upon the Chinese clas sics, lecture, essays, dialogues, letters, stray-thoughts, table talks, and poems both Japanese (uta) and Chinese (shi). We can do no more than to introduce our readers to what was in the man. There were two distinct stages in his intellectual career. The first was when he with his countrymen of the time was brought up in the conservative Chii philosophy, which above all other things, enforced ceaseless examination into one's own self. We can imagine the sensitive youth made doubly sen sitive by his constant introspection into the lack and weakness"], [111, "101 within himself, and all the effects of undue self-examination are plainly visible in his early life and writings. His Notes and Commentaries upon Great Learning composed in his twenty first year was written under this mood. We fear his natural modesty under the pressure of the disheartening philosophy would have turned him into a morbid recluse, as it did many souls like him, had not a new hope been reached out to him in the writings of that progressive Chinese, Wang Yang Ming. We have had already some occasions of referring to this re markable philosopher when we spoke of our great Saigo. I think I am stating a well established fact in Japanese History when I state my own observation that the Chinese culture in the form of Yang-Ming-ism has never produced timid, fearful, conservative and retrogressive people out of us. I believe all thoughtful critics of Confucius now agree that the sage himself was a very progressive man. It was his retrogressive country men who construed him in their own light, and made him appear so to the world. But Yang-Ming developed the pro gressiveness that was in Confucius, and inspired hopes in such as were inclined to understand him in that light. The same helped our own Toju to see the sage in the new light. The Saint of Omi was now a practical man. Here are some of his Yang-Ming-ism : \" Press right on, though thy ways are dark ; Skies may clear ere thy course is done.\" \" Tightly pull, man, thy heart's string, Prepare for a resolute march. A case is known of an arrow, Piercing through a flinty rock.\" \" He loves his life who his life forsakes For Truth that no like or higher knows.\" Who can make a quiet village-teacher from these ?"], [112, "102 We have said he wrote commentaries upon the Chinese classics. Indeed these form by far the most important part of all his writings. But let not our readers imagine that Toju was a commentator in the ordinary sense of that term. He was a most original man, and his natural modesty alone made him to resort to resort to this kind of literature for expressing him self That he expressed perfect freedom in handling the an cient writings was evident from the words he often repealed to his pupils. \"Those Discourses of the holy saints of old contain many things in them that are not applicable to the present state of society.\" So saying he made an expurgated edililiou of the same for use in his school. Had he lived to day, he would have made a fine subject for heresy trial ! That he clearly made distictions between man-made Laws (j\u00a3, nomos) and the eternally-existing Truth (IS, logos) is shown by the remarkable saying of his as follows : \" The Truth is distinct from the Law. Many taking one for the other are greatly mistaken. The Law changes with time, even with saints in their land. Much more when transplanted in our land. But the Truth is from esternity. Before the name of Virtue was, the Truth was and prevailed. Before man was, the space had it ; and after he will have dis appeared, and heaven and earth returned to nothingness, it will be. But the Law was made to meet the need of time. When time and place change, even Saints' Laws, if forced upon, are injurious for the cause ofthe Truth.\" And this was spoken when the so-called Classical Books (\u00a32 %-) were considered as inerrant as the Bible to the extreme inspirationists in our day. Commentaries written in such a spirit like this cannot but be bold, striking, and new. Yet with all his fearlessness and independence, nothing was more remarkable in his ethical system than the fore most position he gave to the virtue of humility. To him it was the primal virtue out of which all other virtues came,"], [113, "103 and without which a man lacked in all things. \"Unless the scholar first empties himself, and seek the virtue of humil ity, with all his learning and abundance of genius, he is not yet entitled to a position above the slough of low com monality.\" \"Fullness invites loss; humility is Heaven's law. Humility is emptiness. When the mind is empty, the judgement of good and bad comes by itself.\" Ex plaining the meaning of the word emptiness, he has this to say: \"From of old, he that seeks the Truth has always stumbled at this word. Because spiritual, hence empty ; be cause empty, therefore spiritual. Consider this well.\" As for attaining this light of virtue, his method was very simple. Said he : \" If to cherish virtue is our aim, we are to do good day by day. One good done, and one evil goes. Good daily done, evil daily goes. Like as the day lengthens, the night shortens, we persevere in good, and evil all dis appears.\" And finding his supreme satisfaction in this empti ness in his soul, he has these words of pity to those who are not yet exonerated of selfishness in them : \" A prison there is out of prison, Large enough to take in the world, Its four walls, love of honour, Of gain, and pride, and wish. Alas, so many among men, Chained therein, mourn evermore.' \" Wish,\" desire, he despiced in all its forms. It was the predominence of this element in Buddhism that alienated him entirely from that faith. That good is done with a reward in aim, even though it lies in the future existence, was object ionable to him. Righteousness with him needed no other incentive than itself. The hope of future reward and ex istence, even if he had, influenced him to the slightest degree his love of righteousness, and enjoyment in the practice of the"], [114, "104 Heavenly Ways. Writing to a mother who mourned over her son's leaving the Buddhist Faith to turn a Confucian, he has these to say : \" That you make so much of suture I can well understand. But I wish you to note that of future is so important, present is still more so, for if a man get astray in this life, it is all too probable that he shall be forever lost in the life to come. * * * In a life so uncertain as this, where morrow- is wholly unknown to us, nothing can exceed in importance our constant worship of the Buddha within our breasts, etc.\" That he was not an atheist is abundantly shown by the profound respect he paid to the gods of the nation. Only his faith was singularly free from \"wishes\" of all kind, except that of being righteous altogether. And yet he seems to have enjoyed his life thoroughly. In all his writings we fail to catch a single note of despon dence. Indeed, with our own views of God and Universe, can hardly imagine how this man with his Yang-Ming-istic form of Confucianism could have been so happy. Once plying a boat on the lake in a moon-lit night, he had this stanza in Chinese : \"A flaw in thought an inch long, Leaves a trace of thousand riis. Let Peace possess Realm of Mind ; Cloudless Moon waves not disturb.\" How everlastingly joyful the heart that could sing \"On a Winter Day,\" \" When once flowers ceased to be Objects of my heart's desire, How everlasting the Spring That reigneth in my bosom.\" The following is in similar strain :"], [115, "105 \"Little knew I that this life, With sorrows hard pressed, Could by Learning's benign help, Be spent in endless peace.\" But he did not enjoy his life long. His wife preceded him two years, and in the autumn of 1648, in his fortieth year he1 died a death worthy of his life. When he found that his end arrived, he called his disciples together, assumed his usual upright posture, and said, \" I go away ; see that my ways be not lost lo the land ; \" and passed away. The whole neighborhood went to mourning. Deputies were sent by princes to render their obsequies to the master. His funeral was a national affair, and all that loved virtue and righteousness mourned the death so costly to the land. Years afterward, the house he had lived in was repaired by his villagers, and is preserved to this day. They made a god of his name, and observe two annual festivals for his memory. You go to visit his grave, and a villager will guide you, not without a simple ceremonial robe cast over his shoulders. You ask him why his respect to a man who lived three hundred years ago, and he will answer you on this wise : \" Here in this village and neighborhood, the father is kind to the son, the son filial to the father, and brothers are affectionate to one another. In our homes no angry voices are to be heard, and all wear the countenance of peace. All these we owe to the teachings and after-influences of the Master Toju, and we one and all revere his name with grateful remembrance.\" And we of this age, with so much of our drum-beatings, trumpet-blowings, and newspaper-advertisements; that we might have \"influence\" over others, may well learn of this man what the real secret of influence is. If we cannot live quiet as Toju did, who was no more conscious of his influence"], [116, "106 than the rose of its oder, we might write and preach and howl' and gesticulate all our lives, and yet nothing will remain of each one of us expect \"a mound of sod one iatami wide.\" \"There are saints scattered all over this land,\" the master once said, \"in the nook of valleys and sheltered by moun tains ; but we cannot recognize them because they do not show themselves. These are real saints, and those whose names sound in the worth need not be counted as anything.\" Happily or unhappily his name did \"sound in the world,\" (much contrary to his wish we know), that zve might all learn of him the power of a silent life if lived with a noble aim in view. These saints were they who in their schools \"in the nook of valleys\" did preserve Old Japan from meanesses of all kinds ; and we know not whether our present system wilh virtues and geniuses all dabbed and professored, could as effectively keep down the meannesses so rife in our midst."], [117, "VI. SAINT NICHIREN.\u2014 A BUDDHIST PRIEST. I. Buddhism in Japan. MDELIGION is man's chiefest concern. Properly understood, \u00a9b a man without a religion is unthinkable. In this strange existence where our wishes are so much more than our faculties, and our hopes exceed all that the world does or can give, something must be done to remove these incongruities, in our thought at least, if not in our action as well. Indeed we often hear some speak that they are \" men of no religion.\" By that they simply mean that they do not sign their names to any distinct set of dogmas, own no order of priests as their guides, and pay no homage to any wooden or metallic or psychic image as their god. But a religion they nevertheless have. The Inscrutable within them is tamed in some way, be it by Mammon-Worship or Whiskey-Oblations or some other soporific or sedative method of his own choosing. A man's religion is his own explanation of Life ; and some explanation of it is an absolute necessity for his well-being in this world of strifes. Then that all-important question of Death, the hope of the poor and the dread ofthe rich, \u2014 that is the question of all questions, for whose pleasurable solution man will give all that he has and more. Where Death is, Religion must be; \u2014 a sure sign of our weakness it may be, but withal* also of our noble birth, and of deathlessness within us. Noi to die by dying, \u2014 that is what all the sons of Adam yearn after, and we Japanese no less than the Hebrews or the Hindoos of alleged religiosity. And for twenty-five centuries before we heard of"], [118, "108 any thing about Resurrection, and all believable and unbeliev- able doctrines connected with it, we have managed to die in some fashions, some of us in very creditable fashions, thanks for all the good religions we have had. With this beautiful land as our earthly home, with cherries to adorn our joyous spring, and maples to paint our serene autumn, and peaceful domesticity as our lot in life, Existence has been a burden to us only very seldom, and Death has been grievous unto us so much more. With our desire to live \"thousand and eight thousand years,\" the thought of Death was a double pain to be alleviated only by a faith that could introduce us into still better land, be it a saints' home in Shinto heaven, or a lotus garden in Buddhist Paradise. We feared Death not so much from our cowardice as from our attachment to this beautiful land of ours. Religions we needed to resign our- selves when Fate or Duty called us from our beloved land of birth. The Japanese has a religion of their own, which in all probability they brought with them from their home in Central Asia. What the exact nature of that religion originally was is not easy to tell. Its similarity to Mosaic Faith has been recently pointed out, and another attempt was made to identify in us the Lost Ten Tribes ofthe Jewish record. But whatever it had been, time came when it was superseded and eclipsed by a very much more complex, and, may we say, refined faith of Indian origin. We can easily imagine the effect of the Hindoo faith as it first made its way among the Japanese. Its gorgeous ceremonies, high mysticisms, and speculations bold and labyrinthine, must have struck the simple-hearted people with wonder. It satisfied the eyes of the ignorant, whetted the intellect of the learned, and served the purpose of the ruler. Notwithstanding some patriotic oppositions against the whole sale importation of an exotic faith, the Hindoo Religion spread in Japan with gigantic strides. For a time al least, the ancient"], [119, "109 faith was placed wholly in background, and the new reigned supreme for centuries in succession. The introduction of Buddhism into Japan is dated at the thirteenth year of the reign of Kinmei, the twenty-ninth emperor, which we make to be 551 of Christian- era, or \" 1501 years after Buddha's entrance into Nirvana,\" as Buddhist chronologists like to have it. The great temple of Tenwoji was built as early as 587 A.D. at Naniwa (Osaka) by Shotoku Taishi, the wisest prince the country has had, and the \" father of Japanese Buddhism.\" The next century (seventh) saw active proselyting going on throughout the empire, the emperors themselves taking initiatives in the work. About this time there was a great revival of Buddhism in China under the leader-ship of Hiuen Chwang, the famous priest ofthe Tau dynasty, whose adventurous journey into India was so vividly described by Barthelewy St. Hilaiie ; and scholars were sent from Japan across the water to study under the man who had seeked the Faith in the land of its birth. The emperors ofthe Nara dynasty (70S-769) were all strong supporters of Buddhism, and the mighty temples' that still adorn the ancient capital of the same name witness to the power attained by the new religion so soon after its introduction into the land. But the new enthusiasm reached its acme when by the beginning of the ninth century, two Buddhist scholars, Saijo and Kukai returned from their study in China, each with a sect of his choosing. The emperor Kammu who removed the capital from Nara to Kyoto gave each a conspicuous site for temple-building, and endowments and priviledges affixed thereto. Saijo built Eizan lying to the north-east of the new capita], the direction from which all evils were thought to come. Kukai posted himself at Koya in the province of Kii, but had a temple-site given him in the'south end ofthe capital, the famed Toji with its peering pagoda right south to the rail way station being his own establishment. With F.izan founded"], [120, "110 in 7S7, and Koya in S16 A.D., we may say that -Japanese Buddhism had rooted itself firmly in the native soil. No com petition with it by any other faith was possible, and no wonder that its founders thought that its foundations were immovable as the mountains they builded on are. Thus in the beginning of the ninth century we find the so-called \"eight sects of Buddhism\"* firmly established in the land. For four centuries after the death of Kukai we hear nothing about the introduction or formation of any new sect in Japan. \"The \"eight\" grew on in power and influence, SaijS's (Tendai) leading all the rest. And here as elsewhere assumption of power by spiritual bodies brought in all the attending corruptions. Soon the priesthood became emperors of emperors \" (imperium in imperio),\" so much so that one of the latter expresssd the nuisance of his priest-subjects by the well-known saying, \"Two things are beyond the power of my control : the water of the Kamo and mountain-priests.'' Em perors after emperors, and nobles after nobles vied with one another in building, endowing, and embellishing temples of their particular devotions ; and the large city of Kyoto and its suburbs, with their magnificient religious structures, \u2014 porches, pagodas, hexagons, bell-houses, \u2014 are one huge monument of the faith that once flourished among us. Near the close ofthe twelfth century, as pacific settlement of the country after long internecine wars gave rise to a new activity in religious thought. The great Yoritomo crippled the temporal power of priests, but showed them due respects as the people's spiritual guides ; and the result was the rise of many great teachers honorable for their learning and virtue. * For those who may not yet be familiar with them, we might just as well mention them here. They are (1 ) Sanron (H f\u00a3), (2) Hosho (J\u00a3 ffl), (3) Kegon (-p ig), (4) Ritsu (-*-*\u00a3), (5) Jojitsu (/-\"j *g), (6) Gusha (fit \u00a3\u25a0), (7) Tendai {% and (8) Shingon (_% =\u2022)."], [121, "111 The Hojos who succeeded him were most of them faithful devotees of Buddhism. Tired with the pomp and vain-glori ousness of the existing sects, they caused Zen or meditative school of Buddhism introduced from China (1200), and several great temples were built, in Kyoto, Kamakura, and Echizen, to perpetuate the new form of worship in the land. The new became a favorite faith with the upper and intellectual classes, its esoterism and endless meta physics standing in such contrasts to the ceremonial shows of the older sects. \u2014 The populace too needed a faith other than the high intellectualities of the Zen philosophy or unapproach able sublimities of the older cults. And such a faith was furnished them by a priest called Genku (saint Honen), who, about 1207 A. D. introduced among them what has since been called the Jodo or \"pure-land\" sect. It taught above all other things the possibility of entrance into the Pure-Land merely by calling upon the name of Buddha, and hence was otherwise called Nen-Butzu or Call-on-Buddha sect. The simple \" Nam-Amida-Butsu \" (I commit myself to thee O thou Amilabha Buddha) was set to music on the hand-bell ; and the whole uttered with plaintive voice and often attended with dance gave entirely new features to thus far a very august form of belies. A branch of this was the Shin sect, started at about the same time by a priest named Hanyen (Saint Shinran), des tined to eclipse other sects by the influence it was to have over the mass of the people. The very novel feature of this sect was the removal of the vows of chastify from the priest-class, and considerable leniency thus afforded to their free indulgence in the common joys of life. Buddhism thus vulgarized, its approach to the commonality was greatly facilitated ; and now without any imperial authority to forward its propagation, it began to be a power among the people, \u2014 a matter of very consequence to the ages that followed. The addition of one more branch, that of Jishu, to the Nenbutsu sect completed"], [122, "112 the developement of the exoteric school of Buddhism in Japan the three coming to be adopted by the people almost simul- taneously with one another and wilh the esoteric Zen school which invaded the cultured society of the time. The country was to have one more sect, \u2014 twelve in all, \u2014 immediately fol- lowing the last we have mentioned. We may therefore say that the thirteenth century was the last and greatest_/'*/7;/st//z)(? period ol Japanese Buddhism. The century was really the re formative era ofthe Plindoo Faith in Japan. No such lights as we saw then have appeared since, and we of this century still hang upon the words then uttered with all faith and convic- tions of the age. Here as elsewhere enthusiasm disappeared together with superstitions, and we, afraid of being nonscienti- fic, are cowardly creatures, basing our actions wholly upon the seeable, and upon the faint echoes of time when men were sincere without our knowledge, and heroic without our crowd- ing cares. Let us call up a hero then to shame us in our vaunted faith, and in our love of ignoble ease when heaven and earth are calling us to noble deeds and sacrifice. II. Birth and Consecretion. On a spring day of the ist year of Teiwo (1222) as the sun above the billowy horizon, and the easternmost outpost of Earth's nations caught its first rosy rays, a child was born lo a fisher's family in the village of \" Little Haven \" near the estern most cape of the province of Awa. The father was a fugitive there for some political suspicion, now a poor fisherman with out any outward distinction ; and the mother also of no mean birth, a devout worshipper of Sun-god, of whom the gift of a son had long been asked, and now granted in answer to her prayers. They named him Zen-Nichi-Maro (Good-Sun-Boy) in pious commemoration of the deity who called him to being, a fact which had considerable to do when the child came to"], [123, "113 decide his mission to this world, as we shall see afterward. All the wonders and miracles which are reported to have attended his birth, \u2014 how a crystalline spring out of its own account sprang into the fisher's garden \" to wash the natal unclean liness away,\" how a white Lotus of unusual magnitude, so entirely out of season, opened near by \" to cast fragrance into the air,\" etc. , \u2014 we of this century are accustomed to ascribe to the devout imaginations ofthe time. But the date and the day of his birth is worth particular mention here, as it was a point much ruminated upon by the young enthusiast as the awful question of his country's salvation came before his mind afterward. The date was 2 171 years after Buddha's entrance into the Nirvana ; that is, after the first millenium of \"Right Law \" (jE ?\u00a3 *\u00a3) had ended, and the second millenium of \" Image Law \" 'f \u2022* r f ) _____] a*so Spent itself, and the third and last millenium of \"Latter Law\" (M'\u00c6^5?) had just been ushered in, when as was prophesied by the Great Teach er, a Light was expected to appear east of him to shine the darkness of the last days. The day was the 1 6th of Second Month (according to the lunar calendar), a day after the same great event in Buddha's life which was on the 15th of the same month. Correspondences such as these were of immense importance to a mind like our hero's. When he came to be twelve years old, the pious inclina tion of his parents decided upon his being made a priest. Considering what he did in after-years, we can well believe many stories told about his remarkable childhood ; and we do not wonder if the paternal ambition of the fugitive-fisher man saw in his son's consecration to a priestly office an opportunity for the lad's rise in society, as in that age of rigid social distinctions, Religion was the only way open for a low born genius to show itself in the world. Not far from the place where he was born was a temple, Kiyozumi by name, and its abbott Dozen had local reputation for his learning and virtue."], [124, "114 There the boy Zennichi was taken, and entrusted to the care or the benignant teacher who seemed to have taken special delight in the youth. Passing his novitiate of four years, he was for mally consecrated a priest at the age of sixteen under the new name of Rencho ; and already the good abbott, watching the unusual ability of his young disciple, was beginning to think of nominating him as his possible successor in his office. The youth remained his parents' hope, and a pride to his teacher, when behind all outward appearances struggles were going on in his mind, which drove him at last from the region of his birth, to seek enlightenment throughout the country. III. In and Out of Darkness. He was fairly introduced into the elementary knowledge of Buddhism when several questions presented themselves to his mind for solution. The most apparent was the existence of multitudinous sects in Buddism. \" Why is it \" he asked to him self, \"that Buddhism which had its origin in the life and teaching of one man is now divided into so many sects and divisions ? Is Buddhism more than one ? What means that I see around me that one sect speaks evil of all others, each maintaining that it has Buddha's true mind ? No two tastes to the waters of the sea ; and there can be no two ways in the teachings of Buddha. O wherein lies the explanation of this division into sects; and which among those sects is Buddha's way, the way I should walk in ? \" Such was his first and greatest doubt, an entirely reason able doubt we believe. We also have similar doubts about Buddhism and some other Religions, and we can entirely sympathize with our hero in the struggle he had. As neither his Abbott nor anybody else relieved him from his doubt, he naturally resorted to his prayers. One day as he came down from his worship at the temple of the Bodhisattwa of his"], [125, "115 special devotion, the burden within him became unbearable, and down he came to the ground with abundant hemorrhage from his mouth. His friends helped him up, and it was sometime before he returned to consciousness again. We are still pointed to the exact spot of this occurrence, a little bamboo bush near by with certain reddish tints in its leaves being supposed to have taken its colors from the blood that spattered on that occasion. One evening, however, as his eyes were poring over the Nirvana Sutra said to have been delivered by Buddha just before his entrance to that blessed state, the following caught the attention of the young priest, to the inexpressible relies of his troubled mind : -fife }\u00a3 s\u00a3 f& A, Trust in the Word and not in man. That is, he was not to trust in human opinions however plausible and high-sounding, but in the Sutras as left by the Great Teacher, and he was to decide all questions by them and them only. His mind was now at ease. He found something to stand upon, whereas thus far all had been sinking sand under him. Who, by reading the above account of the Japanese priest, is not reminded of a similar case in the Convent of Erfurth four hundred years ago, when after much questionings, \" loss of consciousness,\" etc., the young German monk found his rest in an old Latin Bible that caught his eyes, and clung to it ever afterward as his strongsold of faith and life ? But in the case ofthe Buddhist priest, the question ofthe authoritative Scripture was not so simple a one as in that of the Christian Luther. Whereas the German had a single Bible to rely upon, the Japanese had dozens, often of very con tradictory natures, from which to make his selection of the cannon of supreme authority. This however was a com paratively easy task in the age when the so-called Higher- Criticism was wholly unknown, and men put their simple trust upon the records of ancients without questioning why and wherefore. It was enough for our hero that he found one"], [126, "116 of the Sutras gave chronological orders of all the great Sutras in both Mahayana and Hinayana. The orders given were, beginning with the Avatamsaka Sutra supposed to contain Buddha's first public utterances, (i) the Agamas (Kegon-Kyo) containing his leachnings of the first twelve years of his ministry, (2) the Vaipulya Sutras, (Agon Kyo), those of the second sixteen years, (3) the Pragna Sutra (Hannya Kyo) of the third forteen years, and (4) the Saddharma-Pundarika Sutra (Myo-Ho-Renge or Plokke Kyo), of the last eight years of his life. Natural conclusions from these orders were that the last-menlioned Sutra contained the essence ofthe teaching of Buddha's whole life ; or in the words of Nichiren it had in it \"the principle of all things, the truth of eternity, and the secret importance of Buddha's original state and of the virtue of his enlightenment.\" Hence its beautiful name of \"the Sutra of the Lotus of the Mysterious Law.\" It is not in our purpose here to enter into a critical examination of the exact orders of the Buddhist canons, or of the comparative value of one above others. I think it is fairly settled now that the Sutra that Nichiren thought so much of was a later product, some 500 years after Buddha's death, and the Amitartha Sutra that gives the orders ofthe different canons here mentioned was written expressly for the purpose of giving authenticity and su perlative authority lo the new canon. But be these whatever may, it only suffices us to know that our hero accepted them in the order here given, and found in Saddharma-Pundarika Sutra the standard of the Buddhist faith, and a clear simple explana tion of the all-comprehensibility of so many discordant views in Buddhism. As he came to this conclusion, the joy and gratitude within him bursted into abundant tears. \"I\" he finally said to himself, \" I who left my father and mother, and gave myself to the service of this excellent faith, \u2014 should I cling to the traditional teachings of common priests, and not seek the golden words of the Tathagata (Buddha) himself\"?"], [127, "117 He was twenty years old when the holy ambition rose in his mind. Seclusion in a country-monastery became no more possible. Bidding farewell to his abbott and order, he launch ed out boldly into the world to seek the truth far and wide. His first destination was Kamakura, the Shogun's capital of the time. A country-priest in the metropolis, \u2014 a Luther in a Rome, \u2014 strange phenomena met his eyes, and strange doctrines reached his ears. With the magnificence of its temple-structures and the pomp of its priest-classes, the city was given up wholly to falsities. The Zen sect leading the high, and the Jodo sect the low, the former inlo quagmires of futile speculations, and the latter into delirium of blind trust in Amitabha, Buddha's Buddhism was not to be found any where. Yea more, he saw Buddha's very images given to children for toys and Amitabha of only fabulous existence was given the supreme position in what they called Buddhist wor ship ! Men clad in holy garbs vaunted themselves in their open shames. Salvation, they taught, consisted only in call ing upon the name of Amitabha, and not in acts of virtue and discipline; and so amidst the din of Nam-Amida-Butsu, licen tiousness of the grossest kind prevailed among the people. During his five years' stay in Kamakura, he saw enough to convince him of the presence of ihe Latter Days already in the world, and the need and opportunity of a new faith to bring in a new era of Light, as foretold by Ihe Worshipful in his Holy Sutra. Only but recently, Saint Daia, an object of universal adoration, had died a death, which sent horrors to all his followers. His body \"shrivelled up into the smallness of a child,\" and the color of his skin changed into \" pitchy dark ness,\" \u2014 unmistakable signs of his fall into the Hell, and evidence of the diabolical nature of the faith he represented. Then too what do those monstrosities in the sky signify ? Three aerial forms, white and red, hang clear against the western sky, and when the two white disappeared, the red"], [128, "118 remained \" as a pillar of fire piercing through the zenith.\" The whole was succeeded by a violent earthquake bringing down many temples to the ground, and men and beasts groaned under the debris of the structures intended for their salvation. All because the True Sutra is not preached in the land, and errors are taught and believed in. Am not I the he of eternal appointment to revive the Faith in the land ? With thoughts such as these, Rencho left Kamakura be hind him, wisely remarking that \"the capital of a country is a place for disseminating the truth, and not for learning it.\" After a short visit to his parents, he set out for further search after knowledge. Eizan towering in the direction of Devil's Gate from Kyoto to ward all evil influences from off the Mikado's capital, has been for the last one thousand years the chief repository of Buddhist learning in Japan. There twenty-five hundred feet above the sea-level, in the envelope of tall cryptomeria forests, and in magnificent view of the placid Biwa below, the ways of Sakya were searched into, con templated, and transmitted. In its days of prosperity, the whole mountain must have worn the aspect of a bustling colony, harboring as it did an army of mendicants three thou sand strong, a fear of the populace as ofthe emperors. It was here that Genku studied, and formulated his exoteric school of Buddhism so contrary to the tenets taught in the mountain, and had it afterward so widely adopted by the people. His disciple Hanyen, the founder of the Shin Sect was also a student here, as were also many others who had had national reputations for their attainment in the secret laws of the Faith. And now our Rencho, ambitious of propagation of genuine Buddhism in Japan, came four hundred miles on his feet from his fisher's hut in the province of Awa to seek enlightenment in the same mountain. With the new opprotunities of investigations here afford ed, Rencho took in with avidity all that he could lay his hand"], [129, "119 upon. But his specially was Saddharma Pundarika Sutra, \u2014 his Sutra, \u2014 of which valuable manuscripts and commentaries were accessible in the mountain. Indeed the Tendai sect of which Eizan was the centre made great deal of this Sutra. WThat are called \" the Sixty Volumes \" of the sect are so many commentaries upon this one Book. Such a wonderful book that Tendai the Chinese sounder of the sect wrote thirty volumes upon it ; and one of his disciples Myogaku finding that the master's commentaries still needed commentaries wrote another thirty volumes upon the first thirty volumes. Ten of these volumes treat separately of eacli of the six Chinese hieroglyphics that compose the name of the Sutra ! So deep to the ancient did appear the meaning of the book which to us appears as nothing very extraordinary. \u2014 For ten long years Rencho stayed in Eizan delving into these intricacies. We can only give the conclusions he came to. He was now thoroughly convinced of the view he had entertained of the superiority of the Pundarika Sutra above all other Sutras ; of its introduction to Japan in its pure form by Saijo the founder of Eizan, and of considerable vitiations introduced thereto by priests who came after him. Often to Kyoto, and once to Nara and Koya, he carried his researches to establish him fur ther in his convictions ; and when no more doubting was possible, be was ready to lay down his life for his Sutra. Once he saw with his own eyes all the principal deities of the land coming to promise protection over him ; and as they vanished in the air, a divine chorus was heard in the sky, saying \"Shi nin-gyo-seken, no-metsu-shujo-an \" (this man will go round the world, and destroy the darkness that is in men). He was not the only mystic, however, who had similar visions and visitations. He was now thirty-two years of age, friendless, unknown, yet independent and indomitable. He had no ancestral lineage to lay his claim upon as had Hanyen of the Shin Sect."], [130, "120 He was a fisherman's son, \"a shudra of a sea-coast\" as he afterward named himself. Neither was his study prosecuted in a foreign land, as were those of Saijo, Kukai, and other eminent \"theologians\", \u2014 a matter of prime importance, then as now, of being accepted by the Japanese as a holder of a key to the secret of any branch of knowledge. Patronage of any kind he had absolutely none ; much less imperial patronage, as had the most other sect-founders in abundance. He alone began singlehanded, against powers of all kinds, with a view wholly at variance with those of the influential sects of the day. He is the only case, as far as we know of the Japanese Buddhists, who, without any example to follow after, stood for a Sutra and a Law with his life in his hand. His life is interesting not so much for the doctrinal views he maintained and promulgated as for the brave ways he stood for them. Religious persecution in its true sense began in Japan with Nichiren. IV. Proclamation. \"A prophet is not without honor save in his own country.\". Yet it is a pathetic fact to know that a prophet usually begins his public career in his own country. Home less as he is in this word, he yet feels the attraction of his homes, and despite the kind of treatment he is sure to receive there, he resorts there as a hart panteth after water-brooks, only to be rejected, stoned, and expelled. Rencbo's course was not to be otherwise. In his humble home at Little Haven, he found his parents eagerly waiting for the return of their son ; and the first and greatest of all his trials was to protest against their natural desire of seeing him installed as the abbott of the monastery that had nursed him in his youth. He now changed his name to Nichiren, Sun-Lotus, significant ofthe god who called"], [131, "121 him to being, and of the Sutra he was to give to the world. On the 28th day of the Fourth Month of the fifth year of Kencho (1253) as the rosy sun was half above the eastern horizon, Nichiren was upon a cliff looking toward the broad Pacific, and to the hearing of the seas before him and the mountains behind him, and through them to the whole Universe, he repeated the form of prayer he had framed to himself, the form that was intended to silence all others, to lead his disciples to the end of the earth, and be their watch word to all eternity, \u2014 the form indeed that embodied the essence of Buddhism, the constitution of man, and of the Universe. It was NAM-MYO-HO-REN-GE-KYO, Namah Saddharmapundarikaya Sulraya, I humbly trust in the Sutra of the Mysterious Law of the White Lotus. Nature addressed to in morning, he was to address his townsmen in afternoon. His fame had already went round the whole neighborhood. He who spent fifteen years in study in Kamakura, Eizan, and Nara must have something new, deep, and edifying to speak to his countrymen. So they came, young and old, men and women, some repeating the haraharitaya ofthe Shingon sect, others the nam-ami-dabutzu of the Jodo. When the temple was all filled, and \"incense per fumed its four corners,\" Nichiren appeared on the pulpit \"at the beating of a drum.\" A man just reaching fulness of man hood, with many marks of vigilance upon him, the eyes of a zealot, the dignity of a prophet, \u2014 he was the cynosure of the whole congregation, and his opening words were watched with breathless silence. He took up his Sutra, the Pundarika, read a part of its sixth chapter, and \" with countenance mild, and voice resonant\" he thus began : \"Years have I spent in the study of all the Sutras, and read and heard all that different sects have to say about them. In one of them we are told that for 500 years after Buddha's en trance into Nirvana, many will attain Buddhahood without any"], [132, "122 exertion on their part; and for the succeeding 500 years, with diligence and ascetic contemplation. This is the millenium of the Right Law. Then will come 500 years of Sutra-reading, and another 500 years of temple-building. This is the mille nium of the Image-Law. Then will be inaugurated the five centuries of 'the Concealment of the Pure Law', wherein the merit of the Tathagata's teaching shall have exhausted itself, and all ways of enlightenment shall be lost to mankind. This is the beginning ofthe Latter Day Law which will continue for ten thousand years Now it is two hundred years since the world entered the last milleniums. And to us so far removed from the direct teaching of Buddha, there is but one way provided for our attainment of Buddhahood; and that way is contained in the five characters Myo-Ho-Ren-Ge-Kyo. Yet the Jodo calls upon the people to shut this precious Sutra, and to turn no more ear to it ; the Zen makes light of it ; and the Shingon revils it as unworthy of loosing shoes from off the feet of their Sutras the Maluivairokana. Are not such spoken of by the Worshipful in the second book of the Pundarika, in the chapter on parables, as the exterminators of the seeds of Buddhism, whose sure end will be in endless Hell? He that has ears to hear and eyes lo see, let him understand, and divide truth from falsehood. Know that the Jode is a way to Hell, the Zen the teaching of internal hosts ; the Shingon a heresy to destroy the nation, and the Ritzu an enemy of the land. These are not my own words, but I found them in the Sutra. Hark to the cuckoo above the cloud. He knows the time, and warns you to plant. Plant now therefore, and do not repent when the harvest season comes. Now is the time for planting the Lotus Sulra, and I am the messenger sent by the Worshipful for that purpose.\" He ended, and an uproar of indignation arose from the infuriated audience. Some said his mind was out of order, and hence might be pardoned; others that his blasphemy was"], [133, "123 worth the severest of punishment. The landlord who attend ed the meeting would see lo the blasphemer's being dispatched as soon as he stepped out of the holy ground. But the old abbott was kind. His pupil might some day repent, resume his former orthodoxy, and so end his dreaming. At dusk, he ordered two of his disciples to take Nichiren out of the district by ways safe from the landlord's attack. V. Alone against the World. Rejected at home, he made his way right into Kamakura, the capital of the country, \" the best place for disseminating the Iruth.\" There in a spot owned by nobody, in what is still called Matsuba-ga-Tani (Pine-Leafs Dale) he had a little straw-hut built for him. Here he posted himself with his Pundarika Sutra, \u2014 an independent man, \u2014 to begin his con quest of errors around him. The great Nichiren-sect had its beginning in this hut. The stupendous temple-structures at Minobu, Ikegami, and other places, with more than five thousand temples in the land, and two-million souls that worship in them, \u2014 all had their beginning in this hut and this one man. So are great works always born. One indomita ble soul, and the world against him, \u2014 therein lies the promise of all permanent greatness. The nineteenth century may well learn of this man, of his faith and bravery, if not of his doc trines. Had Christianity itself such a beginning in Japan ? Mission-schools, mission-churches, allowances in money, helps in men, \u2014 great Nichiren, he began with himself alone with none of these ! For a year he is silent once more in study and contempla tion. Meanwhile he had his first disciple, named Nissho afterward, who came all the way from Eizan, attracted by the views they had in common upon the state of Buddhism in Japan. Nichiren is exceedingly glad, because he can now"], [134, "124 appear before the public, and lay down his life there without the fear of his doctrines being lost to his country. So he began in the spring of 1254 what was never heard of before in the land, \u2014 street-preaching. He repeated materially, amidst gibes and railings of all kinds, what he had first proclaimed to his townsmen. To the retort that it was not becoming for a man of his order to preach by a way-side, his decisive answer was that it was becoming for a man to eat standing in time of war. To the rebuke that he must not speak evil of ihe faith adored by the ruler of the land, his plain reply was that \"the priest is Buddha's messenger, and fear of the world and of men agrees not with his vocation.\" To the natural doubt that the other forms of worship could not be all mistaken, his simple explanation was that \" the scaffold is of use only till the temple is done.\" For six years he preached in this manner, in season, and out of season, till his work and person began to call public attention. Among his disciples were counted not a few of men in high authorities, some even of the Shogun's household, and there was a fear that the whole city might be carried away by his influences if not checked in due time. There were Abbott Doryu of Kencho-ji, Abbott Ryochu of Komyo-ji, Ryokwan of Gokurakuji, Ryukwan of Daibutsu-ji, etc., all high dignitaries of vast influence, who took counsils together for the suppression of the rising faith in the capit al. But Nichiren's audacity was more than all their united efforts against him. Taking advantage of many calamities that had recently befallen the land, he prepared what is still considered a most remarkable production of the kind, \u2014 Rissei-Ankoku-Ron, A Treatise on Bringing Peace and Right eousness to the Country. Therein he recounted all the evils from which the land was then suffering, and traced their cause to the false doctrines taught among the people. These he proved by extensive quotations from Sutras. The remedy did lie, in his view, in the universal acceptation by the nation"], [135, "125 of the highest of all Sutras, the Pundarika ; and pointed out as the sure result of refusal of such a gift civil wars and a foreign invasion. Never before were more caustic terms applied to the church-dignitaries of the land. The whole treatise was a battle-cry, a declaration of war ofthe most determined kind, which if fought through could have but one issue, the extirpa- tion of his sect, or of all the other sects. It was enthusiasm indistinguishable from madness, and Hojo Tokiyori, a wisest of the rulers the country has had, decided upon its suppression by the removal ofthe zealot from the capital. Bui ihe politic man did not know the kind of soul he was dealing with. It was a soul prepared for death, and with such sincerity in it that it had already begotten other souls like it, no less prepared for encounter with all kinds of trials, as was abundantly proved afterward. Nothing could intimidate these men, and \"warfare against Buddha's enemies\" was carried on with unabated vigor, till by force the little company was disbanded and its leader carried away as an exile to a far-cff province. VI. Sword and Exile. For fifteen years following the publication of his Treatise, his life was a continuous battling with the powers and princi palities of this world. He was first banished to Idzu where he remained three years, making converts in his exile. On his return to Kamakura he was entreated by his followers to stop \" warfare \" and devote himself mostly to their edification ; lo which his decided answer was that \"now in the beginning of Latter Day Laws, when the virulence of errors is so strong, polemic attack is a necessity as medicine to a disease at its crisis, and is a mercy, though it does not appear so.\" He at once resumed his old attitude, \u2014 an incorrigible priest he, \u2014 heedless of the destruction now hanging over his head. One evening, when on his missionary tour with several of his"], [136, "126 disciples, he was suddenly attacked by a company of men swords in hand. The leader of the attacking party was no other than the landlord who had determined upon the removal of the audacious renovator at the time of his proclamation of the new doctrines four years ago. Three of his disciples were killed, one priest and two laymen, in their effort to save the life of their master. Thus the Sutra had its first martyrs in Japan, precious to the memory of the myriad who now put their trust in the same. Nichiren escaped with a wound in his forehead, the mark of his fidelity to the Law. But the real crisis came in the autumn of 1271. His life had been spared thus far, for the law of the time forbade the capital punishment of the priest-class; and though his impud ence was now beyond forbearance, his shaven head and sacerdotal robes were his strong protections against the rigor of the law. But when nothing could prevent his vituperative attack upon the existing faiths of the land, and with them upon the authorities both civil and clerical, the Hojo decided upon his being delivered to the hand of the executioner as an extraordinary measure in his special case. The so-called \" Danger of the Sutra (Go-ho-nan) at Tatsunokuchi\" is a most notable account in the religious history of Japan. Its historic veracity has been recently doubted ; but the \" danger\" shorn of the miracles which the future piety has attached to the account seems unquestionable. The popular account is on this wise : At the instant when the executioner lifted up his sword for the final despatch, repitition by Nichiren of sacred words* from his Sutra brought down a sudden gust of wind from heaven, and to the utter bewilderment of all around him, * Rin-kei yok-ju-sh<i, Nen-pi Kwan-on-riki, T6-jin dan-dan ye. When on the scaffold life is to end, And Kwanyin's power is contemplated upon, The blade of the sword to pieces will crumble."], [137, "127 the blade was broken to three pieces, and no second stroke was possible by the paralysis of the swordsman's hand. Soon a messenger reached the spot \" galloping at the full-speed,\" bringing a writ of release from Kamakura, and the cause of the Sutra was thus saved. \u2014 But we can explain the incident with out calling in the aid of a miracle. The superstitious fear of the executioner to put an end to the life of a man of the holy order is perfectly possible in that age. And when he saw the calm composure of the dignified priest ready to receive the fatal stroke in the attitude of mumbling prayers, we can well imagine the poor executioner shaking with fear of heavenly punishment should he be instrumental in shedding the inno cent blood. A similar fear must have overtaken the ruler himself who had decided upon this unprecedented execution ; and he at once sent out a messenger with the sentence of an exile instead of death. The escape we believe was narrow, but was perfectly natural. The exile which was to take the place of death was a severe one. Pie was now carried to Sado, a forlorn island in Japan Sea, at that lime the most inaccessible part in the whole country, and the favorite place of banishment for criminals of the most offensive kind. That he survived the exile of five years in this island is a wonder. One severe winter he passed through with little beyond bis mental food upon his Sutra. His was another conquest of mind over body, spirit over force At the close of his banishment he added one more province to his spiritual dominion. Ever since Sado and the neighboring populous province of Echigo have remained fanatically loyal to his cause. His indomitable courage and perseverance now called forth the fear and admiration of the authority at Kamakura ; and this, together with a fast approaching danger from the Mongol attack in fulfillment of his prophesy of a foreign invasion secured him permission for his return to the capital"], [138, "128 (1274)- Soon after his arrival there, he obtained a charter for the free promulgation of his doctrines in the land. Spirit con quered at last, and for seven centuries it was to be a power in the nation. VII. The Last Days. The man was now fifty-two years of age, most of which were spent in vigils, and battlings with the world. He was now free to speak to his countrymen ; but the way in which the permission was given to that effect did not please him at all. It was fear which induced the Hojos to grant freedom, whereas he aimed at the willing acceptation ofthe Sutra by the ruler and his people. He now began to think of retiring to a mountain after the manner of his Hindoo Master, there to end his days in quiet contemplation and instruction of his disciples. Herein we believe lie his greatness, and the main reason of the permanence of his sect. When the world began to receive him, he left it. Here was an opportunity for stumbling and fall for souls less than he. But to his disciples, the removal of the interdiction of their tenets was commencement of open aggressive actions against the adherents of the older sects. We are told of tem ples after temples \"stormed and brought down by vocal attacks.\" We know what the manners of these zealots are. Each carry a drum in his hand, and they in unison repeat their prayer, \u2014 Nam-Myo-Ho-Ren-Ge-Ky5, \u2014 with five strikes to ac company its five syllables. Twenty of them is stunning to our ears and we can well imagine the effects of hundreds of them in their new vigor and enthusiasm, going from house to house, from temple to temple, through the city of Kamakura, calling for its immediate surrender to the new faith. The zeal, the fire, the intolerance of the founder are still distinctly visible in his disciples of to-day, \u2014 the only case of martial zeal"], [139, "129 in naturally inoffensive and pessimistic religion of Buddha. Our hero's last days were peaceful. He established him self in Mt. Minobu to the west of Mt. Fuji, and there in the splendid view of the ocean to the south and noble mountains beside and behind, he received the homage of his admirers from all parts ofthe land. Here he lived to see his prophesy literally fulfilled in the great Mongol Invasion of 1281, which of course added considerable to his fame and influence. The year following that great event, he was carried to Ikegami (near Omori Station) as a guest to one of his lay-disciples, and there died on the nth day of 10th month, 1282. His last wish was to have his doctrines preached in the imperial city of Kyoto, for to have \"the holy hearings\" at last, and he appointed one Nizzo, then a fourteen year boy, for this work. One feature of his death-bed scene needs our notice. They brought to him an idol of Buddha as his possible consolation! in his last hours; but he beckoned with his hand to remove it at once, with an evident sign of much displeasure about it. Then they unrolled before him a Kakemono with the name o Saddharma-Pundarika Sutra written in magnificent Chinese characters. Thereto he slowly turned his body, and clasping his hands towards it, he breathed his last and passed away. A bibliolator, and not an idolator, was he. VIII. An Estimate of His Character. No more enigmatic character has appeared in our history than this subject of our essay. To his enemy he was a blas phemer, a hypocrite, a belly-server, a king of mountebanks, and all that. Books were written, some of them very ingeni ous, to prove his charlatanism and other doubtful features. He is the favorite mark of attack when Buddhism is to be ridiculed by its enemies. He is made the scapegoat of all that are opprobrious in that religion by his brother-"], [140, "130 Buddhists out of his own sect. No man in Japan had more calumnies piled upon his than this man. And when Christian ity made its appearance in the land, it too has taken its part in the matter, and many more stones were thrown at him from that quarter as well. I know one of its famed ministers once turning his whole attention in that direction. Indeed, for a Christian man in Japan to write anything laudatory of this man sounds as impious as to speak good words for Judas Iscariot. Of all men, Nichiren is the last character to be touched upon if he has something good to say about heathens. But I for one venture my honor, if need be, for this man. Most of his doctrines, I grant, cannot stand the test of the present-day criticism. His polemics were inelegrant, and his whole tone was insanoid. He certainly was an unbalanced character, too pointed in only one direction. But divest him intellectual errors, of his hereditary temperament, and of much that his time and surroundings marked upon him, and you have a soul sincere to its very core, an honestest of men, a bravest of Japanese. A hypocrite cannot keep his hypocrisy for twenty-five years and more. Neither can he have thousands of followers ready to lay down their lives for him. \" A false man found a religion?\" Carlyle exclaims. \"Why, a false man cannot build a brick house\" I look around me, and I see 5000 temples manned by 4000 priests and 8000 teachers, and 1,500,000-2,000,000 souls worshipping in them after the manner prescribed by this man, now six hundred years after his death ; and I am told to take all these as the work of a shameless mountebank ! My belief in human nature is too strong for me to believe in any such thing. If falsity is so permanent upon this earth, by what other means shall we dis tinguish honesty from it ? A most fearless of men, his courage was based wholly upon his conviction that he was Buddha's special messenger to this earth. He himself is nothing, \u2014 \" a sudra of a sea-coast\";"], [141, "131 \u2014but in his capacity as a vehicle of the Pundarika Sutra his person had all the importance of heaven and earth. \" I am a worthless ordinary priest,\" he once said to a man in authority; \"but as a promulgator of the Pundarika Sutra, I am Sakya mouni's special messenger, and as such Brahma serves me on my right hand and Sakra on my left, and Sun guides me and Moon follows me, and all the deities of the land bend their heads and honor me.\" His own life was of no account what ever to him ; but that his nation should persecute him, the bearer of such a Law, was lamentable to him beyond his power of expression. If demented he was, his demency was of noble sort, hard to be distinguished from that highest form of self respect which knows its own worth by the worth of the mission it was sent to fulfill. Nichiren was not the only man in History who has had this estimate of himself. Therefore, holy Sutras, and especially his own'Pundarika, were constant sources of his consolations during years of hard persecution. Turning to Nichiro his favorite disciple, who to approach his master's boat as it was launched for its voyage to the land of the exile, had his arms painfully disabled by the angry strokes of its oarsmen, Nichiren had this consolation to offer : \" Know that staves and exiles are the necessary accom paniments to the preachers of the Sutra in the Latter Day. What was written in the chapter on exhortation in the Pun darika Sutra two-thousand years ago has now come upon thee and me. Rejoice therefore, for the time of the conquest of the Sutra is at hand.\" His exilic epistles to his disciples are full of quotations from Sutras. In one of them he writes : \"In the Nirvana Sutra we have the doctrine of ' the turning of heaviness into lightness.' We receive this heaviness in this life, and with it lightness in the life to come is assured. * * * * * Devabodhisattwa was killed by here tics, Aryasimha was beheaded, and Nagardjuna met diverse temptations ; and they in the Right Law Age, in Buddha's"], [142, "132 own land. How much more then in this end of the earth, in the beginning of the Latter-Law Age ? etc.,\" The Christian Bible was not more precious to Luther than the Pundarika Sutra to this man. \" If I can die for the sake of my Sutra, I count not my life precious,\" were his words on many critical occa sions. A bibliolator he might have been, as in one sense our own Luther was ; but the book certainly is a nobler object of worship than images and forces of all kinds, and a man that could die for a book is a nobler sort of heroes than most thai go by that name. Let the modern reviler of Nichiren see whether his Book is not in dust ; or if daily mumbled in his mouth, and its inspiration hotly defended, whether he could bear sword and exiles for fifteen years, and stake his life and soul for it that it might be adopted by the people to whom they are sent. Nichiren should be the last man to be stoned by the owners of the Book which more than all other books did fashion for the better the affairs of the humankind. Nichiren's private life was the simplest that could be imagined. Thirty years after he had established himself in the straw-hut in Kamakura, we find him in a similar structure in Minobu, when wealthy laymen were his disciples, and ease and comforts were at his command. Very intolerant to what he called \"Buddha's enemies,\" he was a mildest of men when he dealt with the poor and stricken. His letters to his disciples breathe softest of tempers, in such a contrast to the fire in his memorable \"Treatise.\" No wonder that they thought so much of him. Indeed, Nichiren's life ahvays reminds me of Mahomet without the concupiscence of the latter. The same intensity, the same insanoid fanaticism, yet withal the same sincerity of pur pose and much of inward pity and tenderness, in one as in the other. Only I believe the Japanese was greater than the Ara bian in that the former had more confidence in his Sutra than the latter in his Koran. Physical force was not necessity to"], [143, "133 Nichiren seeing that he had such a book to trust in. It alone without any human agency is a power enough, and n > force is needed to established its worth. The History that has acquit ted Mahomet of his hypocrisy ought have done more with its right estimate of Nichiren. Divested therefore of his thirteenth century garbs, of the aberration of his critical knowledge, and of a little taint of in sanity that might have dwelt in him, (as did dwell in all great men, I suppose,) there stands before us a remarkable figure, one of the greatest of his kind in the world. No more inde pendent man can I think of among my countrymen. Indeed, he by his originality and independence made Buddhism a Japan ese religion. His sect alone is purely Japanese, while all others have had their beginnings either in Hindoo, or Chinese, or Corean minds. His ambition, too, embraced the whole world of his time. He speaks of the eastward march of Buddhism from India to Japan till his time, and of the westward march of its improved form from Japan to India from his time on. He was therefore an exception among the passive receptative Japanese, \u2014 not a very tractable fellow no doubt, because he had a will of his own. But such alone is the Nation's back bone, while much else that go by the name of affability, humi lity, receptability, and beg-ability, are no better than the country's shames, fitted only for swelling the number of \"con verts\" in proselyters' report to their homeland. Nichiren minus his combativily is our ideal religious man."], [144, "VII. A TEMPERENCE ISLAND OF THE PACIFIC* tHILE Christian America is in commotion armed for Zion's war against the huge monster of intemperance ; vvhile her study Maine is barely keeping its ground in her northeastern corner ; while the brave Iowa is being assailed by the enemy both within and without \u2014 yea, while the very Con gress of the most Christian of nations will have poisonous liquids sold to the helpless Africa (let heavens hear and the earth be ashamed ! ) \u2014 heathen Japan is to send words of cheer and encouragement to the friends of prohibition across the Pacific. The temperance island I wish to speak of here is not an imaginary one, like the New Atlantis of Lord Bacon. It is an island with rocks and rills, mountains and valleys, its latitude and longitude well known, and peopled with men and women of like sinful propensities as the sons and daughters of the Pilgrim Fathers, only they have no gospel to heal their souls or blessed Sabbath to hallow their homes. If prohibition does prohibit among the heathen who bow before wood and stones, why not among the church-going, gospel-believing, Sabbath keeping, Christian Americans ? The island of Okushiri is situated in the Japan Sea, off the coast ofthe main island of Yezo. Its greatest length is about fourteen miles, breadth seven miles; circumference about thirty-five miles ; area fifty-six square miles. A small island, it is true, but \" prohibitionally \" speaking, the fairest spot upon the globe. * The Advance, Dec. 17, 1891."], [145, "135 The island is fertile and well-wooded ; but its people are engaged mostly in fishing. Immense shoals of herring ap proach its coast every spring, and the catch then made is to feed and clothe the people all through the remainder of the year. In 1885, when prohibition was first spoken of in the island, there were some 240 souls, owning four weirs (standing nets), no roads to speak of throughout the island, houses thatched with coarse grasses, only a single school of the lowest grade, but they drank 880 casks of sake (rice-beer) at $350 per cask and upward, besides brandies and other strong drinks. The price of rice was high through the last winter, and the people suffered severely from hunger and cold. The local authorities taught them the necessity of storage for future provision ; but whence the means to be laid up for the future when cold and hunger were at their very doors ? Brave men among them point ed out alcoholic drinks as things that might be dispensed with, and that the money they spent for the liquors might be used for the importations of substantial grains. Usual objections were raised against such a bold plan, such as, \" alcohol as a means of protection against cold,\" \"a social necessity,\" etc., etc. The devil has the same arguments in both hemispheres. But strong men were not wanting among the islanders. Here we have a \"Proclamation\" they made \u2014 shall I call it a Declaration of Independence ? \u2014 which wiser and more Christi an people than they might as well copy : The Contract of the People of Okushiri concerning the Sell ing and Buying of Alcoholic Liquors and the Use of the Same among them. Preamble. This our land is a forlorn island in the sea. The people, numbering ninety families, dwelling in four villages, have no other pleasure for body and mind than in the use of sake."], [146, "136 Nine out of ten of us like the liquid, and what we annually spend for the same is not small. In 1884 we imported some 880 casks at $350 per cask, besides brandy and other drinks; and even with these scarcity is often felt in winter lime. Some time ago, Mr. H \u2014 , our Governor, during his visit to our island, urged upon us the importance of providing for the future as signs of famine in the near suture are not wanting. We were much impressed by what he told us and persuaded others to join us in the work of storage, and we are somewhat on the road toward success. But the catch of herring was uncommonly bad this year and the islanders as a whole have scarcely any means left for the future. Some of us went so far as to depend for our food supply upon the government provi sion. Our debtors cannot keep their promises. We are in misery, and to save ourselves from this wretched state of things, we must have recourse to some extaordinary means, [hear!] Frugality is to be resorted to and vanity of all sorts must be set aside. We, therefore, before all others, will abstain from the use of what we relish more than all other things \u2014 Sake \u2014 and thus will close the way of importation of the liquid into this island. The money we spent for it will be sent out for rice and other grains, and thus we will provide for our suture want on the one hand, and will increase our capital on fishery on the other. This is the only possible way of perfecting the provision without any additional effort on our part. We have drafted this contract that by mutual encouragement we may secure the public prosperity ofthe island. Those of you who like to share in our privation for the good of the public and the future, speedily come and sign the contract. The Originators. July, 1884."], [147, "137 Article I.

Women may remain quiet when men are so wise. ] Splendid decalogue, very wisely framed ! All glory to the people who can think out such and can keep it too ! Did the space allow, it would be interesting to show the American readers another contract, supplementary to the one given above, respecting the granaries and the ways of gather ing and keeping the grains contributed by the people. The same fairness and wisdom run throughout them both. At the end of five years the amount of rice contributed by each is returned to the contributor, and only \"interest-rice\" com puted, as money laid in interest, is to remain as the common property. Each member as well as the \" body politic \" is to be thus enriched at the same time. He who contributed much shall have much returned to him ; only he added more to the common property than his less industrious neighbor. Let us see the result in 1890, five years after the law was put in force. Well, to be sure, the law was kept, rigorously kept. The government officers of the highest authority must leave their bottles behind them when they land upon this island. The inveterate drunkard must leave the island, or should any such like to visit it, he better drink his belly-full before he step upon this \"non-alcoholic\" island, and then"], [150, "140 must be perfectly sober during his stay there. Soberness and chastity reigned throughout the isle. Florence under Savon arola was not more sober than Okushiri under the Prohibition Law ! And what good has come ? Immense good ! The population in creased fi ve-fold, the capiral upon fish business, ten-fold. Straw-thatched roofs were all changed to shingles. Besides four large granaries owned by the island, well filled with rice and other grains, each house has a granary for its own private use. The say they have now enough to support them, even though not a single herring comes to their shores for three or four successive years. Roads were built throughout the island, while five years ago there had been none to speak of. Schools were improved and increased, and better teachers were hired. A new farm was opened up, and hemp to the value of $2,000 was raised by their own hands to be manufactured into their herring nets, whereas five years before it must be all imported from the outside provinces. Their growth and prosperity became known throughout the neighbouring districts. The governor, out of his admiration for the industrious people, contributed $600 to their common property, which was spent in the permanent improvement of the island. Need I speak here of the decrease of crime and debauchery in the island? Here, once in history, the benefit of total abstinence was practically proved, and wised men of other provinces are urging their fellow-men to imitate Okushiri. I have heard of a large community of colonists in the main island of Yezo adopting a constitution similar to that of Okushiri, though not so rigorous as that, and working very satisfactorily. You may be anxious to know what became of the contract when its term expired. Well, (let the friends of prohibition rejoice,) it is to continue for five years more, it worked so well !

He liked to see the rigorous law some what \" tempered \" that he might indulge in his elixir a little. Some of his policies were in the direction of \"high license,\" or something like it, and the people saw that their constitution was in danger. The last I heard of the island is that the people sent in a petition to the governor asking him \"to honor this gentleman with a more honorable position than the head officership of this forlorn island,\" and to transfer him to some other place where he can drink and be merry to his heart's content. Meanwhile the little Okushiri is booming with its new industries and newly shingled houses, shining like a bright little star amidst the encircling gloom and debauchery. The Rechabites of the North Pacific are these Okushiri Islanders, with their new and profitable motto : We shall drink no sake."], [152, "VIII JAPAN : ITS MISSION*. fHREE important questions suggest themselves to a philo- sophic man who desires to serve his country and Creator to the best of his might. I. What is the chief aim of man ? 2. For what purpose was the country made, of which he is a citizen, or what is its mission ? 3. For what purpose was he sent, or what is his mission ? The first question is mainly speculative, though its practical significance is not to be overlooked. It makes a world of difference whether a man looks upon this universe as his play ground for a definite period of time, or as his school where he is trained and disciplined for a higher state of exist ence. The question is important, but we dismiss it by an swering in the words of the Westminster Confession, which, though two-and-half centuries old, yet appears to us to be the profoundest and most philosophic of all the answers given to this highest of all human inquiries : \u2014 \" Man's chief end is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever. \" Let those who in the all-embracing word \"God \"find nothing but tinctures of superstition, substitute for it righteous ness, justice, mercy, good will, and they can form some idea, in this short incisive answer of the Puritan saints, of the sublimity and completeness of their moral conception concern ing the destiny of man and creation. * Published in Japan Daily Mail, Feb. 5. 1892."], [153, "143 The third question is more practical and comprehensive. Men is all times, especially great men, believed more or less in Providence appointing one kind of work to one set of people, and another kind to another set. Artist Angelo, composer Mozart, discoverer Columbus, statesman Cromwell, warrior Napoleon, philanthropist Howard, poet Whittier, and songstress Lind, were all intensely conscious of their special missions in this world. A man cannot be anything he chooses to be. The world must have lost much if instead of painting the Sistine Chapel and chiselling Moses, Michael Angelo had followed the footsteps of his spiritual leader Savonarola and became a moral reformer of Italy ; or if Cromwell had attempt ed to imitate Bunyan or Milton, and vacated Whitehall for a less worthy man. Everyman in his own place, where he succeeds the best and the world is benefited most. \"Know thyself.\" If mankind in general with the earth he lives upon has a definite end and aim, and if each individual is destined for a specific work in his time and place, then a nation, as a unit which goes to compose the whole human family, must have a work peculiar to itself and contributory to the welfare and pro gress of the whole. Here let us notice that a nations history is intensified in interest as we study it in its relations to the world's history. The patriotic Schiller says: \u2014 \"The most powerful nation is but a fragment ; and thinking minds will not grow warm on its account, except in so far as this nation or its fortunes have been influential on the progress of the species.\" As a selfcentred man is the least and meanest of mankind, so a self-seeking and self-satisfied nation is the weak est and most backward of all nations. Japan cannot be an exception to this eternal law. What is Japan's mission, or what can she do for the world ? If Egypt and Babylon started civilization, Ph\u0153nicia dispersed it, Judea purified it, Greece polished it, Italy pre-"], [154, "144 served it, Germany reformed it, England tempered it, and America executed it, is nothing more left for Japan to work upon it? Has she only to eat and drink and grow fat upon what others have earned for her, and be satisfied ? Or can she do some great things for the world ? Two elements go to form a nations : land and people. What Dr. Freeman says of Greece, is also true of all other nations. He says: \"Another people in Greece might not have done such great things as the Greeks did ; and the Greeks might not have done such great things in any other land. But the land and its people fitted one another, and so great things came out of them.\" \"As is nature, so is man,\" says Lamar line; yet we also hear from eminent authorities of \"earth modified by man.\" To ascertain the mission of a given nation, therefore, the physical nature of the land, and the mental and moral characteristics of its people are alike to be carefully studied. Geographical Features. Carl Ritter, a famous German geographer, the author of \"Erdkunde\" and the father of the modern school of philoso phic geography, early maintained that a calm-minded states man, by carefully and devoutly studying the geographical features of his country, can ascertain much of what it can be and shall be. His thought was echoed by his Swiss pupil Arnold Guyot, who expanded the theme in his widely read \" Earth and Man,\" which as a clear and eloquent treaties on the relation between geography and history, is still a classic in this branch of charming study. That civilization could start most auspiciously in Egypt is attributed to the fertility of the Nile valley caused by the yearly overflow of its water; to the periodicity of this overflow and the certainty of good crops thereby, as well as to the safety from foreign attacks both by"], [155, "145 land and sea. Hellas or Ancient Greece is thus described : \u2014 It was essentially the region of mountainous islands and peninsulas. No point was ten miles from mountains, and none forty miles from the sea. The configuration of the country was such as to form small communities andlindle the spirit of independence. Land was well-protected on all sides and was also open to the sea ; hence came commerce and civilization from very early times. The key to Gifeece's great ness is in her nature. Her climate below 40.parallel was temperate, that belsw 390 half-tropical, but not enervating. Her soil was of only moderate fertility, making the Greeks more industrious than the Egyptians.\" Italy with a uniform system of mountain ranges favoured union. Who could doubt the naval and commercial power pf England, seeing in that Island Empire the centre of the earth's land hemisphere, with splendid harbours and deep estuaries all along her coast line ? That nationalities like those in Europe are impossible in America is easily seen by the grand scales on which mountains and valleys are constructed in the new continent. The earth is a stage and men are actors, and the All-wise Dramatist has so arranged the play as to result in the wonderful combination of events called History. The following points are evident in the geographical con figuration of Japan : \u2014 I. It is insular, resembling in this respect its sister Empire ofthe Atlantic. 2. As England lies near the centre of the landhemisphere, so Japan lies in the periphery of the same. 3. Its chief mountain system runs lengthwise, i.e. from S.W. to N.E., disturbed only by the Hakone-Fuji range, called by Dr. Nauman magna fossa. In respect to its mountain system, Japan bears a resemblance to Italy. 4. More indentations are found on its eastern or Pacific side than onfits western or Continental side. In Kiushiu,"], [156, "146 however the indentations are decidedly on the side that turns toward China, and the coast line is almost unbroken on the eastern side. In connection with this, let the student observe the situation of San Francisco, just opposite our Iwaki-Taira, and Vancouver, Tacoma, Seattle, and Portland on its north, and San Diego, San Bias, Manzanillo, Acapulco, on its south, All turning towards us. Also, observe the Hoang-Ho, the Yantzekiang, and the Canton river all flowing and opening toward us. Japan turns her back on Siberia, but extends one arm toward America, and the other toward China and India. We omit minor characteristics though interesting and important, and those which are well known like its climate, products, etc. What do all these characteristics seem to imply ? Following the footsteps of the author of \" Erdkunde,\" we humblyreply : \u2014 1. Our insular position seems to signify our adaptability to commerce and navigation, a fact too plain to need demonst ration here. In this respect we are like the Greeks and the English. The land is already too much crowded, and we must conquer the sea as an arena for our ambition. 2. Our situation on the periphery of the land-hemisphere, and thus at a very great distance from the centre of national animosities, favourably places us at a safe distance from attacks by foreign enemies. If it cost several thousand fiances for the French Government to send and keep a single soldier in Annam, if it takes fifteen days for an express train to come from St. Petersburg to Vladivostock, and this through the bleak and dreary Siberia, and if to avoid the heat and danger of the Indian Ocean, two oceans and a continent are to be traversed by the Englishman before he reaches Yokohama, then if any nation is safe, Japan is safest. The least possible amount of armament secures her from the depredations of the world's most conquering nations. 3. The directions of her mountain ranges, taken in con-"], [157, "147 junction with the variegated configurations of her surface, make national unity with local independence possible \u2014 a feature very important for the healthy growth of a nation. Compare Russia with Switzerland in this respect. 4. The fourth point is important. Japan stretches one arm toward America, now enjoying the choicest fruits of European civilization. By the opening of the Vancouver line, she is to-day no farther from America than the latter was from Europe only a few years ago. On the other hand, by means of Shimonoseki and Nagasaki, she stretches the other arm fowards the responding arms of Korea and China, the whole making Japan a steppingstone, as it were, between the Occidental and the Oriental continents. Winds and currents seem to imply the same thing, making call at Yokohama almost a necessity to a vessel that plies between the two conti nents. There she stands as an \"arbiter,\" a \"middle man\" (nakahodo) between the Democratic West and the Imperial East, between the Christian America and the Buddhist Asia. ethnic characteritsics. We arrive at almost the same conclusions as we approach our question from the study ofthe race characteristics of the Japanese. That we are and ought to become good sailors and merchants has been often said and urged. While we are not ashamed of our military prowess it is a doubtful question whether we were made to cope with the sturdy Cossacks or the sinewy Scotch Highlanders upon the field of battle. Despite perpetual advancement in the art of butchering mankind, victory is almost always on the side of the heaviest battalions, and we Japanese are not the tallest and stoutest race upon the face of the earth. Physical as well as ethnic characteristics seem to require from us some other form of conquest than that made at the point of the bayonet. As a united body, we own a single line of"], [158, "148 rulers, enjoy one common language, and manners and customs varied enough to form several separate communities, yet simi- lar enough for union in one nation. Also, observe how impressionable is our nature. Quick to perceive and receive, Japan can readily assimilate to herself anything she comes in contact with. The Japanese alone of all Oriental peoples can comprehend the Occidental ideas, and they alone of all civilized peoples have a true conception of Oriental ideas. In intellectural spheres, no less than in commercial, Japan is a stepping-stone between the East and the West. Historic Indications. That civilization marches westward, in a direction oppo site to the diurnal motion, is a proposition constantly advanc ed by philosophers and statesman. John Adam used to say that nothing was \" more ancient in his memory than the observation that arts, sciences, and empire had travelled westward ; \" and in conversation it was always added that the next leap would be over the Atlantic to America, as happened only a few decades after his death. Galiani wrote during the revolutionary war of America : \"I will wager in favour of America for the reason merely physical that for 5,000 years genius has turned opposite to the diurnal motion, and travelled from east to west.\" The traveller, Burnaby, found in the middle of the last century that an idea had \"entered the minds of men gene rally that empire was travelling westward, and everyone was looking forward with eager and impatient expectation to that destined moment when America is to give the law to the rest of the world.\" The expectation is now being fulfilled before our own eyes. Charles Darwin, entertaining the same view, quotes from Zincke, who said: \"All other series of events, as that which"], [159, "149 resulted in the culture of mind in Greece, and that which resulted in the empire of Rome, only appear to have purpose and value when viewed in connection with, or rather as sub sidiary to, the great stream of Anglo Saxon emigration to the West.\" Consider British Columbia, Oregon, California, and see the force of the statement. The young Americans believed in this law of the west ward march of civilization ; and as soon as the had established themselves on the Atlantic coast they pushed on still westward. Moses Cleveland and those who followed him carried the New England culture and energy to the banks of the Ohio and the Upper Mississippi. Fifty [years ago, Horace Greeley cried to his countrymen : \"Go up west, and grow up with the coun try ;\" and now the country has grown to such an extent that Chicago is to be the cynosure of the world's eyes when man kind will commemorate the execution of a plan dreamed by a Genose youth four hundred years ago. In 1847 San Francisco was opened, and in five years more the Pacific was crossed and the sun dawned upon Japan. America believed in her mission and has fulfilled it well. She received it from Europe and delivered it to Japan. Now it is Japan's turn to add a new proof to the grand possibility of the human race. The law of the westward march was not to be reversed when civilization reached Japan. She is now to set up another national ex ample, which, in the worlds of Charles Summer, \" will be more puissant than army or navy for the conquest of the world.\" Two streams of civilization flowed in opposite directions when mankind descended from their primitive homes on the table-land of Iran or Armenia. That towards the west passed through Babylon, Phoenicia, Greece, Rome, Germany, En gland, and culminated on the Pacific side of America, while that towards the East travelled through India, Thibet, and China, culminating in the Manchoo Court of Peking. The"], [160, "150 moral world is also a magnet with its two opposite poles on the opposite banks of the Pacific, the democratic, aggressive, inductive America, and the imperial, conservative, deductive China. There have been constant attempts for the union of these magnetic currents. Plato, born in a time and at a place when and where the two opposing currents were not far from the centre of equiliblium, has never been approached in the roundness and completeness of his philosophy. Grander tasks await the young Japan who has the best of Europe and the best of Asia at her command. At her touch the circuit is completed, and the healthy fluid shall overflow the earth. We need not repeat here the internal preparations and disciplines we have had in our national history for such a task. We inbibed the best of Korea, China, and India, and the assimilation is well nigh complete. Then within the past thirty years we swallowed everything that Europe had to give us, and digestion is going on briskly now. The system that takes in the East and the West will weave out a tissue that shall partake of the nature of both. Conclusion. Japan's mission may be multifarious; but the one we have laid much stress upon is grand enough to call forth the highest aspiration ofthe nation. To reconcile the East wilh ihe West ; to be ihe advocate of the East and the harbinger of the West ; this we believe lo be the mission which Japan is called upon to fulfill. We stand in our relation to Asia as did the ancient Greeks in relation to Europe. Here we will improve upon what we recieve fresh from the West, that our westward neighbours may utilize and work upon it when the centre of historic activity shifts still westward. Here we will charily keep watch over the rights and interests of Asia, and should another Xerxes of"], [161, "151 gross materialism, of rude irreverence, threaten the life and growth of the sacred East, we too shall fight our Marathon and Thermophyl\u00e6 to put an end to his depredatory march. Here we shall place upon a funeral pyre the exterritorial law and similar humiliations, so that our sister nations maybe free from such shame. Here we shall adopt Laws, Religion, and Politics, as they come from Europe or America, and nursing them in our familiar Oriental atmosphere, we shall give them in marriage as fit brides to our less flexible brothers. We shall, if must be, lead humble Asia to curb the march of proud Europe ; but we desire peace. As no man lives for himself alone, so no nation exists for itself alone. The destiny of Japan is intimately connected with that of 1,000,000,000 Asiatics; and they are to be blessed or cursed as we behave truly or falsely. See how our brother nation so far removed from us as Madagascar looks towards us for example and leadership. A correspondent of the Madagas car Journal from Antananarivo writes to that paper: \u2014 \"It has been interesting to read your different notes about the necessity of having roads in countries like Madagascar, which certainly ought to follow in the footsteps of other countries civilized in the last few decades, and I should think especially the progression of the Japanese people ought to be remarked by the Malagasy, not only because that country has achieved and is achieving the quickest progress in civilization ever seen ; but also because there seem to be several features in the character of the Malagasy and the Japanese which are very much alike, though this may be applied only to the Hova as real Malayan brethren of those people.\" \u2014 (Quoted in the Japan Mail, October 25th, 1890.) Instinct told the Sublime Porte thai we are their trusty allies when the greed of Europe encroaches upon the Mahomedan Empire. Japan is the apple of the Oriental eye, and the whole of Asia is proud of owning her as a sister."], [162, "152 In our attitude toward Europe and America, we nourish no other seeling than one of peace and goodwill. When we speak more ofthe East and less of the West, and are lenient toward Asia and somewat harsh toward Europe, no other sentiment works within us than that of ardent love which seeks after the reconciliation ofthe younger with the elder and more advanced brethren. If at present we receive all things from the West, we hope to requite them by the reflex influence which a new form of civilization will have upon the old. It is said that \"through the May-flower the English Independents created a new world in America, and through America they re-created Europe. \" And what patriotic America fails to see that the nation which introduced Japan to the world needs re-creation as well ? An influence akin to that reflected across the Atlantic may reach Americas across the Pacific, and much of demagogism, mammonism, and rum-ism, together with dissensions in religion and irrevence in politics may lose their power by such an influence. Shine forth towards the East and shine back towards the West, 0 thou country of the Rising Sun, and thus fulfil thy heaven-appointed mission."], [163, "APPENDIX. JUSTIFICATION OF THE COREAN WAR* There was a time in World's History when mankind went to war with no meaner motive than to establish Righteousness upon the face of the Earth. This materialistic century, how ever, conscious alike ofthe \"lusts\" that actuated all its wars, as of the unavoidableness of the same, has come to believe \"lusts\" as only and just causes for wars, and to know of no war that has not \" lusts \" for its primary aims and purposes. \"War for Righteousness' sake\" is now no more obsolete than the ways and customs of the Puritan days, and man only talk of such a war without any of them ever believing in it. No wonder then that the struggle now before us is construed with similar spirit, that doubtful motives are imputed to us in our present occupation of Corea, and final entrance upon a conflict with China. But no one will doubt the existence of righteous wars in History. That was a righteous war that Gideon fought against the Midianites, when with \" his sword and the Lord's\" he slew a hundred and twenty thousands of them upon the waters of the Jordan. That was also a righteous and just war that the Greeks waged against the Persians, and discomfiting them at Marathon, Salamis, and Plat\u00e6\u00e6, checked forever the inroad of Asia into Europe. That was a righteous and Christ ian war that Gustavus Adolphus carried into the heart of Germany to deliver it from the Catholic oppression, and saved Protestantism to the world. If wars in general come out of * Kokumin-no-Tomo, Aug. 23. 1894."], [164, "154 lusts, all wars do not so come; and depreciate not the divine humanity by denying it altogether a nobler motive than the love of gain and empty honor when it goes into war. We believe that the Corean War now opened between Japan and China to be such a war, \u2014 I mean, a righteous war. Righteous we say, not only in legal sense, for legalities can be manufactured as sophistries of all kinds, but righteous in moral sense as well \u2014 the only kind of righteousness that can justify any war. Such a war is not new with us, and we with our light have believed in it and fought it. \"Heathenism\" if dark is earnest, and it may yet retain enthusiasm which Christendom may have lost with its superstitions. A sort of chivalric spirit is yet with us, a spirit akin to Spartan courage, and Roman valor to crush the proud ; and a righteous war \\i still possible with us. That Japan as , a nation has entered only very reluctantly upon the present conflict must be acknowledged by all the intelligent observers of our late situation. Guided by a very unwarlike cabinet, at the time of the greatest prospects for its internal prosperity, war was a thing most to be avoided, and if \"lusts\" were our primary aims, no-wars should be our first and last policy. But China behaved against us, now for more than a score of years, as unneighborly and insolently as we have ever been able to bear in our history. The Great Saigo had seen this long before, and his sanguine desire for its im mediate chastizement cost him his life, and the nation, a terrible civil war. Indeed we killed our own that we might avoid conflicts with our neighbor,- \u2014 so desirous have we been of peace. But how did China act against us in 1882, and again in 1884, and ever since ? Constant affrontary against us in Corea by its constant interference with our friendly policy wilh that nation. While we labored to open it to the world, China labored to close it ; and by imposing upon it the Mongolian regime of its own, has endeavored to keep it a part of its"], [165, "155 own, \u2014 a \"hermit-nation\" like its own bulky self, alien to civilization and world's progress. For the last ten years, Japan who first introduced it to the world was no more than an unwelcome guest at its court, while China who came after reigned supreme over all its affairs. It is a common case of social incivility that aims to turn one's affection from his trust ed friend to win it over by constant savors meant to satisfy his baser natures. We bore this as a matter too puerile to be made a cause for bringing about an open rupture of peace ; and the nation that promised to be another rising star of the East has remained to this day an occult star, with its resources all sealed, and bribery and misgovernment walking out in open day-light. What man with human heart could bear the treat ment given to the body of poor Kim, an acknowledged guest of the Japanese nation, assassinated upon the Chinese soil by an emissary of the China-Corean government ! The body and the assassin were sent over to Corea by one of China's own gun boats to be delivered over to Kim's enemies, the body to be multilated for exposure throughout the land, and the assassin to be loaded with all kinds of honors ! Should this go unpunished, this open violation of social laws, defence of savagery, desecration of humanity ? And when the Tunghioh rebellion broke out in Southern Corea, \u2014 itself a result of mis government conducted under Chinese interference, \u2014 how ridi culous to induce its puppet-government to call for aid from the \"Mother Land,\" to bind it more by obligations that the country needed not, as was proved soon afterward ! China has in capacitated Corea to keep it always her hanger-on \u2014 the meanest bit of international policy that we know of in History. It is the very same policy pursued by a panderly wretch to keep his victims always poor and dependent that he might profit and glory thereby. Some fifteen millions of helpless souls kept ignorant and defenceless to satisfy the jealously ofthe world's most backward nation, \u2014 could this be borne by"], [166, "156 lovers of Freedom and reverers of human rights ! We only wished that we were not the first to raise our voice against this evil, that more Christian nations than we had taken the matter into their hearts long before we did, to heal this \"open sore of the world.\" But right here Legality steps in, and argues with us that we have no right to interfere with Corean affairs any more than China has ; that we in sending our troops there are just as blamable as China is in sending hers ; that we, and not she, are the provokers ofthe war. To which our replies are as follows : I. Interference itself is not wrong. We believe in lais sez-faire principle only to a certain extent. We have no right to interfere in our neighbor's right when they believe in religions not our own, when they are engaged in trades not like ours, when they have tastes different from ours. But we have right to interfere, and we ought to, when they are dying of hunger, when they are attacked by robbers, when our plain common sense shows us that they are rapidly going toward the brink of destruction. Laissez-faire is a vicious principle if it means total indifference to our neighbors' woes. Christ and Buddha, Livingstone and John Howard, would never have been, were laissez-faire in this sense the heaven-established law of society. Where it should end and where interference should begin is not always easy to tell ; but that there are intolerable woes beyond tolerable, no sane man can donbt. When the Swedish Gustavus interfered with the German politics, and Ferdinand and Wallenstein were curbed in their evil purposes, he did well and nobly and manly. The hero of Liitzen was a purest of man, and Protestant Germany is forever thankful to its Swedish champion and deliverer. When the English Crom well interfered with the Alpine politics, and lent all his power and influence to the helpless Piedmontese, to ward them from the Catholic Duke of Savoy, he did nobly and manly and"], [167, "157 Christianly. The British \"pity\" was highest and purest then, and its glory History echoes for the vengeance demanded for \" slaughtered saints, whose bones lie scattered on the Alpine mountains cold.\" Such noble interferences, long ceased to be realities in these economic centuries, are worth repititions, if human welfares are really to be cared for ; and the fact that they are obsolete in ihe Western politics is no reason that it should not be taken up in the Eastern. We interfere with Corea because her independence is in jeorpady, because the world's most backward nation is grasping it in her benumbing coil, and savagery and inhumanity reign there when light and civilization are at its very doors. A right we have not of disturbing her heal thy peace, much less of degrading her ; but to save her, and to free her from evils too glaringly apparent, our sacred right of neighborhood compels us to vigorous interference in her behalf. 2. We first sent our troops to Corea in strict accordance with the letters and spirit of the Tientzin Treaty of 1885. Herein we are legally justifiable, and no voice should be raised against this conduct of ours. But if an objection is still made against us that the troops we sent were altogether too large for the protection of our citizens there (as expressed in our manifesto to China,) we have but to ask our cities to examine the number of troops China sent there for the suppression of a paltry rebellion, as well as the barbarities committed by the Chinese soldiery in 1884. And if we are still questioned as to the propriety of our occupying Seoul at once when the Chinese camped al Aasan, our plain reply is thai we knew too well by our past experiences of the insidiousness of Chinese politicians, and that we have right to guard against knaves, in this case as in any other. If we are still criticized that our procedures could not but invite doubts and suspicions, we would only ask \" How else would you manage yourself if you were in our position ? \" We yet fail to see wherein we erred in our late military movements in Corea."], [168, "158 3. It is yet to be settled which side opened the fire first in the recent naval engagement near Ginsen. We believe China did ; but Patriotism may bias us in this our judgement. But that is a minor question to decide the justice of either side in the war. Which provoked and which avoided the war ? That is the all-important question. Let it be noticed here that it was well-nigh two full months from the beginning of the complication to the final rupture of peace. We on our side maintained the independ ence and integrity of Corea, and through our long telegraphic correspondence with the Chinese court our constant efforts have been to prevail upon that nation to join in united efforts to reform the slate of affairs in the peninsulam. How our pacific proposal was haughtily rejected, how fts emissaries to the Corean court tried to foil all our efforts for reform, how all this while they were briskily arming themselves to meet us upon the land and the sea, \u2014 these we know, and any fair judge can know, beyond any possibility of doubt. If the well known propensity of Chinaman lo cheat foreigners had its most conspicuous exercise, it was during the two months that preceded the first day of August of 1894.* Our neighbor was treacherous to the last degree, and civility failing to carry our point, we decided upon a war. We feel confident that never in its history was China allowed to cheat more freely than in her recent intercourse with Japan. Imagine she had some Western power to deal with instead of her good-natured Eastern neighbor; she would learnt long before this how costly it is to cheat so long. The land that gave Confucius to the world knows his morality no more; and the civilized world knows of but one way to deal with this people so destitute of faith and honor, \u2014 of \" blood and iron,\" and justice only by that. * The day of the declaration of the war."], [169, "159 But leaving all legalities aside, (and we by no means dis regard them) is not a decisive conflict between Japan and China an unavoidability, \u2014 we might almost say, a historical necessity? A smaller nation representing a newer civilization lying near a larger nation representing an older civilization, \u2014 was there ever such a situation in History without the two coming to life-and-death struggle with each other at last? Greece versus Persia, Rome versus Carthage, the England of Queen Elizabeth versus the Spain of Philip II., \u2014 these were the more prominent examples of the couple we mention, and Marathon and Zama and \" Invincible Armada\" were as un avoidable as the two kinds of civilization that came into conflict were irreconcilable. And in the upward progress of the human race, Providence hath always willed that the newer be represented by the smaller, evidently we believe that Spirit be tried against Flesh, and Quality against Quantity. And in the conflict between two such nations, after all vicissitudes of fortunes, the palm of victory fell always upon the newer and smaller, evidently we also believe that mankind may prize \" the spirit that quickenth,\" and despise \"the flesh that, profiteth nothing.\" And once more in History, here in the Far East, the same grand lesson is to be taught by bringing the newer and smaller Japan into conflict wilh the older and larger China. The Corean War is to decide whether Progress shall be the law in the East, as it has long been in the West, or whether Retrogression, fostered once by the Persian Empire, then by Carthage, and again by Spain, and now at last (last in the world's history, we hope,) by the Mantchurian Empire of China, shall possess the Orient for ever. Japan's victory shall mean free government, free religion, free education, and free commerce for 600,000,000 souls that live on this side of the globe, while her defeat and China's victory shall mean \u2014 what, let our reader judge to himself. In the war that carries such significances like these, what"], [170, "160 friend of humanity shall not wish God-speed to Japan and her cause. Let America ask this question to herself, \u2014 America who first led us to light and civilization, as Japan is now trying to do the same with Corea, \u2014 and the spirits of her Pilgrim Fathers, of Lincoln and Sumner and other heroes, shall in unison join the cause that we represent here and now. Let England do likewise ; and her Simon de Montfort, Hampden and Cromwell and Puritan divines, her Wilberforce and Cobden and Bright, and all who loved liberty and equality shall be Japan's unfailing friends. Let France do likewise ; and her Lafayette and Mirabeau, Victor Hugo of recent date, Coligny and his Huguenot followers, and all her chivalric haters of despotism, shall be the supporters of \"the smaller and new er.\" Let Germany do likewise, and her Luthers, and Lessing andSchillers, and immortal Goethe who asked for \"more light,\" and all her \"watchers upon the Rhine,\" shall one and all be wishers of Japan's victory in the East. Let Italy do likewise ; and her Dante and Savonarola, Rienzi and Arnold of Brescia, Garibaldi and Victor Immanuel, \u2014 all her souls of intense sincerity,, whose kinship in temperament we claim, \u2014 shall in nowise side with our enemy that means oppression and ignorance in the East. And finally let our good Slavonic neighbor do likewise ; and though yet with her Siberian exile, and press laws far from liberal, was not the aim of her mighty Founder the enlightenment of the human race ? From the Russia of Peter the Great we can expect hearty sympathy, and if need be, even cooperation, in our present attempt to civilize Asia. Yea more, let the Universe ask this question to itself, and see whether it doomed the half of the human race to the lethargy of the Chinese civilization by keeping them forever under the Mantchu rule. It was the late Louis Kossuth of Hungary who said that in his opinion the two greatest men of the nineteenth century were Prince Bismarck and the Emperor of Japan. He said this because of the mighty work inaugurat-"], [171, "161 ed by our worthy Sovereign, not only for his people, but for the millions of the benighted Asia as well. Japan is the champion of Progress in the East, and who except her deadly foe, \u2014 China the incorrigible hater of Progress, \u2014 wishes not victory to Japan ! Yet in thus calling upon the nations of the world to see and understand the cause we fight for, we are not begging them for their help in the conflict. The struggle is too glori ous a one to be shared with other nations, and we single handed like to fight it to the end. Sympathetic neutrality is all we ask from them at present. Let Japan have this oppor tunity of serving the world, as she has been served by it too long in too many things. We began by saying that the war we entered upon is a righteous war. That it is so shall be evident as soon as we shall have reached its end. We took up the cause of our poverty-stricken neighbor, and that nothing of material profit shall accrue to us from helping her is more than evident. Then from China, too, we shall exact no more than the just price of the blood we shed, as her prostration is not our aim, but her coming to consciousness of her own worth and duty, and to friendly cooperation with us in the reformation ofthe East. Thus we fighl with eternal peace in view, and Heaven bless our bleeding ones as they fall in this holy war. Never before in our history has the nation been fired with a nobler aim, and now as one man we march to meet our foe, knowing \" whether on scaffold high Or in a battle's van, The fittest place where man can die Is where he dies for man.\""], [172, ""], [173, ""], [174, ""], [175, ""], [176, ""], [177, ""], [178, ""]]
