Hour after hour she passed in revolving in her mind all her mother's argu ments, in setting her own in array against them. That she liked Walter Caryll, and that he moie than liked her she was conscious, and had it not been for the awkward antece dent of her love-passages with John Leycester, she felt that she could have accepted him for a husband without hesitation. That she now hated Mr. Leycester as one who had betrayed the confidence she had reposed in him, and done her grievous wrong was certain ; but it was scarcely the hatred which could have en- vol. hi. b"], [10, "2 THE CARYLLS. titled her to Dr. Johnson's admiration. Per haps she would have rejoiced to have seen him reduced to the verge of extremest misery \u2014 misery such as he had inflicted on her, but when there, her heart would have relented to the extent of granting him forgiveness. Al. though on that side all hope was closed, un consciously she cast a longing, lingering look behind. Unable to come to a decision, she resolved to wait the course of events. Very possibly Walter Caryll would never give her the chance of accepting or rejecting him ; if he did, it would then be time enough to consider what answer she should give him. In the mean time, till she could see her way more clearly, she determined if possible to maintain her intercourse with Walter on the same foot ing that it had hitherto been. Unconscious of the deliberations which might exercise such influence on his future destinies, Mr. Walter Caryll was at his post on the evening following his dinner at Lord Brentford's, at an earlier hour than usual, so early, indeed, that he was near knocking down"], [11, "3 THE CARYLLS. and trampling on a young lady whom he met in the passage, and who had been a little more dilatory than her companions in packing up her books and slate. He was in the highest spirits, and exclaimed as he entered the sit ting-room \u2014 \" Now I have a proposal to make. Let us cut the Museum to-day, and all three go for a stroll to Kensington Gardens. It is a lovely evening, and will do us good. But you must make haste and get your things on at once, for the gardens close early.\" Mrs. Wood offered no objections, and her daughter's were easily over-ruled. In fact, Annie had been suffering from headache all the morning, the consequence of her sleepless night and anxious thoughts, and she certainly was not fit for further mental exertion. A cab was sent for, and when they reached the gardens Mrs. Wood was seated on a bench, and the two others set out on a stroll by the banks of the water. It was the first time Annie had ever set foot in the gardens. Liv ing in extreme seclusion, and, till they re- is 2"], [12, "4 THE CARYLLS. newed their acquaintance with Walter, know ing no one who could act as cicerone, they never stirred out of the house except on in dispensable occasions, and knew little more of London now than when they were living at Lynburn. The Gardens were nearly empty, and as they wandered on, the silence and repose, the delicious coolness of the evening, the re freshing breeze playing over the water, even the trees and verdure, so different from the view to be obtained from their dingy house in Seymour Place, affected Miss Wood to tears. Walter remarked it. \"What is it, Annie?\" he said. Their intimacy had long since reached the ' Walter ' and ' Annie ' stage. \" I hardly know,\" she replied. \" I feel such a sensation of rest and peace, that it brings back vividly to my mind our Lynburn home.\" \" Yes, those were happy days ; but there may be happy days in store for you yet, and as happy a home as Lynburn.\" \" No, Walter, not for me. I shall never"], [13, "5 THE CARYLLS. again know the peace of mind which I en joyed beneath my father's roof.\" \" I know,\" replied Walter, \" the loss of a father \u2014 such a father as yours \u2014 is irreparable, but believe me, dearest Annie, there are those who would do their utmost to supply his place.\" He spoke so earnestly, and with so much feeling, that his companion could not but see that one word of encouragement from her would have enabled her to return to her mother as Mrs. Walter Caryll elect ; but this word she could not bring herself to speak. And yet for a short space she hesitated, for never before had she so strongly felt the con trast between what she now was and what she had been ; never before had she ex perienced such a keen desire to emancipate herself from her present state of bondage. But, if the temptation was great, there were other considerations of at least equal impor tance to oppose to it, and they prevailed. She began to feel that she might eventually be induced to adopt her mother's advice ; but, if so, it should be only upon mature reflection,"], [14, "6 THE CARYLLS. not as the result of sudden impulse. In justice to Walter, as to herself, she must con sider well whether, if she accepted him as a husband, she could give him the affection of a wife ; whether she could undertake, in all honesty and sincerity, to discharge, without reluctance, the obligations which such a tie would impose upon her. In other words, whether she could break entirely with the past, although a connection with the Carylls must inevitably expose her to frequent asso ciation with the man who was indissolubly connected with all her youthful recollections. Till she felt absolutely certain that she had acquired this power over herself, she must endeavour to avoid anything like a declara tion from Walter, she would precipitate nothing. \"After all, I have no right to complain,\" she said, at length. \" How many thousands there are in a far more wretched position than I am. I am young, I am strong, I have the means of earning my bread ; and, above all, I have a mother. As long as she is spared to me I can never think myself unhappy. And"], [15, "7 THE CARYLLS. now, let us go to her. She must be wonder ing what has become of us.\" Walter complied in silence. That he was disappointed at not having received any warmer response to his last observations is probable ; but experience had made him cautious, and he refrained, for the present, from following up an attack which had evidently failed in its object. They returned in silence to the bench on which they had left Mrs. Wood. As they approached her, the good lady, who thought it just possible that their short excursion might be attended by substantial results, looked from one to the other, as if she expected to read on their countenances the realization of her hopes. It is needless to say that in this she was disap pointed. They were both of them a little more serious than when they had left her ; but that disappeared when they addressed her. \" Oh ! mamma,\" said Annie, who was the first to speak, \"you don't know what you have lost by not coming with us. I had no idea there was so pleasant a spot within a hundred miles of London.\""], [16, "8 THE CARYLLS. \" Now, Mrs. Wood,\" interposed Walter, \" if you are disposed to be very good-natured, you will let me give you and Annie a row on the Serpentine. There are very tolerable boats on the other side of the bridge.\" \" Oh ! do, mamma. You know how well Walter used to row at Lynburn.\" Mrs. Wood consented. After rowing about till daylight began to fade, they landed, and under Walter's guid ance, they started on foot for Albert Gate. \"Where are you taking us to, Walter ?\" asked Miss Wood. \" This is not the way to the Marble Arch.\" \" No ; but it is the way to the nearest cab stand.\" \" We do not want a cab ; we can walk home very well now that we are so near,\" exclaimed mother and daughter together. \" Very likely ; but I cannot. You talk very much at your ease, but have the good ness to remember that I have been slaving at the oar, or rather at the sculls, for I don't know how long.\" \" How lazy you are grown ; is he not,"], [17, "9 THE CARYLLS. mamma ?\" was Miss Annie's ungrateful ob servation ; nevertheless, no further opposi tion was offered. A cab was hailed, into which they all got, Walter giving his instructions to the driver, who, in process of time, drew up at the door of a confectioner's in Baker Street. \" What is he stopping for here?\" said Mrs. Wood. \" This is not Seymour Place.\" \" Your observation is perfectly correct,\" Walter replied. \" This is not Seymour Place. This is a slight refectory which I ordered my architect to build on the spur of the moment, for the express purpose of enabling me to offer you and Miss Wood ices, strawberries, cakes, and all the other delica cies of the season.\" \" No, no, Walter ; this is too much,\" said Mrs. Wood. \" I positively will not allow it. Tell the man to shut the door and drive on.\" \" I shall tell him nothing of the sort. If you like eating your ices in a cab, well and good ; I will send them out to you. But Annie and I prefer eating ours in a comfort- b 5"], [18, "10 THE CARYLLS. able room. Come, Annie, jump out,\" he said, getting out himself, and offering his hand to the young lady, who followed his example. \" Now, Mrs. Wood,\" he continued, in a most pathetic tone of voice, \" you cannot be so cruel as to remain there by yourself. In the first place it would he the height of indecorum to allow your daughter to go into a private room with me all alone ; and in the next, if you remain in the cab, you will put me to frightful expense, as I shall be obliged to keep it on, instead of discharging it now, as I wish to do.'' \" Well, you must have your own way now,\" said Mrs. Wood ; \" but I will take care you do not entrap me in this way again.\" \" Have you liked your evening, Annie?\" Mr. Walter Caryll asked, as he was taking leave of her a couple of hours later. \" Yes, indeed ; it has been the happiest evening I have passed since our arrival in London.\" \" What ! pleasanter than jour evening at Mrs. Smith's ?\" \" You know it was,\" she replied, returning"], [19, "11 THE CARYLLS. the pressure of his hand, very slightly, it is true, but still enough to send him home with an extremely agreeable sensation fluttering round his heart. Two days later he arrived in Seymour Place, in the middle of the day, contrary to all law and precedent, and asked to speak to one or other of the ladies on a matter of great importance. Mrs. Wood was too busy to be able to attend to him, but she deputed her daughter to represent her. \" Now, Walter,\" she said, on entering the room, \" you know this is not allowed, so tell me what you want quickly, and take your de- parture.\" She spoke with all the gravity, not to say severity, of a school-mistress, and Walter's countenance fell at once. \"J am really very sorry to have disturbed you,\" he .replied ; \" but I have had a box sent me for the Adelphi to-night, and I wanted to know if you and Mrs. Wood would go.\" She had not had many opportunities of wit nessing dramatic performances at Lynburn, and she had never entered a London theatre."], [20, "12 THE CARYLLS. Itisnot very wonderful, therefore, if she could not quite restrain a little exclamation of joy ful surprise. \" Oh, my dear Walter,\" she exclaimed, \" how good of you to think of us. I should like it of all things. I must go and ask mamma.\" Mamma's consent was easily obtained. She returned with her daughter, to make all their arrangements. It was settled that Walter should call for them, and take charge of them for the rest of the evening. Mrs. Wood, whose curiosity was a little excited, was rather anxious to discover the name of the friend to whose munificence Walter owed the box, but on this head he was impenetrable. He was bound by the most solemn oaths to secrecy ; there was nothing his friend dreaded so much as his name being known, as it would expose him to innumerable applications from every quarter; and with this explanation Mrs. Wood was obliged to rest satisfied. She promised that she and Annie would be ready at the hour named ; a promise which was faithfully observed. To Walter Caryll's intense delio-ht"], [21, "13 THE CARYLLS. this theatrical expedition was even more suc cessful than the visit to Kensington Gardens. With the most sagacious councillor at his elbow, Walter could have selected no better course for gaining Annie's affections than the one he was now pursuing. No doubt the occasional relaxation from her toils, for which she was indebted to him, gave her daily a stronger distaste for her present life ; but that would not have sufficed to influence her judg ment. It was the unceasing care which he displayed for everything that could tend to the welfare and comfort of her mother and herself; his attention to her slightest wish ; the passionate devotion, which appeared in every word, in every gesture, that gained upon the best feelings of her heart. She could no longer conceal from herself that his love was returned ; whether with a passion as absorbing as that which she had once felt, she stopped not to inquire ; it was sufficient for her to know that she could accept Walter Caryll for a husband, not only without reluc tance, but with the conviction that her hap piness would be insured by such a union \u2014"], [22, "14 THE CARYLLS. But for the bar presented by her former engagement to Mr. Leycester. To give her hand to another with her secret unrevealed was, in her eyes, an act of treachery; to reveal it was impossible, if only on account of the connection existing between her first and her new lover. Her irresolutions were cut short in a way she little expected. One morning a note was put into Walter's hands at his office. \" Dear Walter,\" it said, \" my mother has met with a dreadful acci dent; can you come to us in our distress? \u2014 A. W.\" Without the loss of a moment Walter rushed down stairs, jumped into a cab, and drove off to one of our most eminent surgeons, whom he was fortunate enough to find at home. Almost forcing Mr. N into the cab, he resumed his course, and in a few minutes reached Seymour Plaoe. While the surgeon was with her mother, Annie gave Caryll an account of what had happened, which, after all, had nothing ex traordinary in it, being a matter of daily and"], [23, "15 THE CARYLLS. hourly occurrence. Mrs. Wood had gone out for the purpose of paying two or three trifling bills, when, in crossing a street, her career was stopped by one of those useful checks to over-population, which Mr. Malthus omitted to notice, probably because they were not so rife in his day as they are in ours. She was knocked down by a butcher's cart, going at the rate of fifteen or sixteen miles an hour, the wheels of which passed over her body, which was no sooner perceived by the very intelligent boy who drove it, than he lashed his horse into a gallop, and escaped detec tion. This mattered but little, as naturally a London jury, for the most part taken from the cart-keeping class, would have voted it entirely accidental. The poor lady was picked up, and being just able to groan out her address, was carried to her own house. Then it was that the strength of her daughter's mind shone out in its full vigour. The first shock was terrible, but seeing how much de pended on her exertions, for their servant thought proper to igo linto hysterics, by a powerful effort she mastered her agitation."], [24, "16 THE CARYLLS. The children were dismissed at once ; with the assistance of a neighbour Mrs. Wool was carried upstairs and laid on her own bed ; one messenger was dispatched for the nearest surgeon, and anotherwith the note to the Foreign Office ; and then she sat down by the bed-side, on which her mother lay motionless as a statue, giving no sign of life except by a low moan extorted from her by pain. When her daughter entered the room, however, and gently pressed her lips to the flushed forehead, she found strength to take Annie's hand, while a few tears trickled slowly down her face. A few minutes later Mrs. Smith made her appearance ; she had heard from her daughters what had happened, and came to see if she could be of any use. She was closely followed by the medical man who had been summoned in the first instance. And then came the most difficult part of the business. The surgeon naturally said that, till the sufferer was undressed, it was impos sible for him to begin his examination ; but the agony which the slightest touch occasioned was such, that she almost screamed when she"], [25, "17 THE CARYLLS. saw a hand approach her. It was necessary to have recourse to chloroform, and under its influence her clothes were cut away from her, and she was laid inside her bed. It was just after this operation had been successfully performed that Walter arrived, and Mrs. Smith took her departure, her presence being needed at home; but not before she had pro mised to return in the course of the evening, and in the meantime to send a woman, on whom Annie might thoroughly rely, to act as nurse, and supply the defects of the very ineffi cient young lady downstairs. Miss Wood had hardly concluded her ac count of the accident, when the two surgeons entered the room. \" Miss Wood,\" said Mr. N , \" will you go to your mother; she wishes to see you ?\" She looked at him anxiously ; but he made no sign, and she went into the bed-room. \" Well, Mr. N ,\" said Walter, as soon as the door had closed on her, \" what is your opinion of the case ?\" \" My opinion \u2014 the opinion of this gentle man and myself\u2014 I grieve to say, is that the"], [26, "18 THE CARYLLS. case is hopeless. The injuries are too exten sive, and of too complicated a nature to admit of a chance of recovery. I will not go into details, which, in all probability, I could not make intelligible to you; but the result of our investigation is that no professional skill is of any avail. She may linger on three or four days, and this gentleman will send her some draughts, which we trust will alleviate the intense pain under which she is suffering. That is all we can do.\" \"And I will send it in at once,\" said the gentleman alluded to, leaving the room. \" Can we trust him?\" Walter asked, rather anxiously. \" Oh ! I think so,\" Mr. N replied. \" I do not mean to say that I should like him to operate on me, nor would he probably like to undertake it ; but he seems to know what he is about.\" \" Thank you, Mr. N ; I hope I have not put you to any great inconvenience by bringing you here,\" said Walter, offering him his fee. \" None, whatsoever. Will you think me"], [27, "19 THE CARYLLS. very impertinent,\" he continued, looking at his two sovereigns in a hesitating manner, \"if I ask you if this is your money, or that of the poor lady in the next room ?\" \" Mine,\" replied Walter, colouring. \" And you can afford it ? Forgive me my seeming rudeness ; but, though I have not the pleasure of knowing your name, I am aware that young gentlemen sometimes have not more money than they know what to do with.\" Notwithstanding the exceptional nature of the question, his manner was so kindly, al most paternal, that, coming from an old man, it was impossible to take offence at it. \" I can afford it perfectly,\" Walter replied, almost smiling. \" My name is Walter Caryll. I was for a long time a pupil of Mrs. Wood's husband, who was a clergyman, and lived in their house for years.\" \" Any relation of Sir Edward Caryll?\" \" His son. Do you know my father ?\" \" Very slightly. A few years ago I was sent for to Oakfield Chase to attend Lord Brentford, who had been injured by a fall in"], [28, "20 THE CARYLLS. the hunting-field, and I met Sir Edward and your sisters there once or twice. I thought I had never seen so handsome a family.\" \" Are they not ?\" said Walter, colouring with pleasure. \" Maud is now Lady Brent ford.\" \" True ; I remember seeing their marriage in the paper. Good-morning, Mr. Caryll. I am very glad to have had the pleasure of making your acquaintance, and I hope our next meeting will be on a less melancholy occasion.\""], [29, "21 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER II. For a minute or two after Mr. N \u2014 's departure, Walter remained uncertain what he should do next. Before he could make up his mind, the servant, who had recovered her senses, brought in the medicines, and he tapped at the bed room door, to inform Miss Wood of their arrival. \"Will you come in, Walter?\" she said, as she opened the door. \" I was afraid you were gone, and my mother wishes to see you.'' As he entered the room, a transient gleam of pleasure, soon suppressed by pain, flitted across Mrs. Wood's countenance. While Annie poured out and gave her the draught, he knelt down and reverently kissed her hand. \" God bless you, Walter,\" she mur mured, \" for all your goodness to us.\" \" Do not say that,\" he exclaimed. \" I"], [30, "22 THE CARYLLS. deserve no thanks for doing my duty. Do you think I can forget the more than kindness I met with from you and every member of your family during our happy days at Lynburn.\" \" At Lynburn, happy Lynburn ! \" she said \" I should like to be buried at Lynburn in my husband's grave.\" \" Whenever the case arrives, which I still trust is far distant, I promise to comply with the wish you have just expressed.\" \" Thank you for that, as for all the rest, though I feel it is selfish in me to accept your offer ; but I shall never leave this bed alive. I know it, Annie knows it, you know it. The doctors could hold out no hopes ; why try to deceive a dying woman?\" \" Doctors are not infallible \u2014 \" Walter began. \"No, but my feelings are infallible,\" she said, in rather a stronger voice, for the medicine had already begun to act on her nervous system, \" and joined to what the doctors said, they leave no room for doubt. And but for one thought I could die in peace. But to leave my child, my darling, to struggle alone"], [31, "THE CARYLLS. 23 in this cold, pitiless world ! It is in this that lies the bitterness of death.\" \" Oh, mother,\" exclaimed Annie, \" do not exhaust yourself by dwelling on such thoughts, God has protected us hitherto ; believe me He will not desert me now.\" \" Walter,\" cried Mrs. Wood, her eyes light ing up with a strange brilliancy, \" Walter, promise me by your hopes of salvation that you will never withdraw your friendship from my child.\" \" Never, never, so help me God.\" u You will be her comfort and support in her trials; her councillor in her difficulties; you will be to her as a brother.\" \" No, no, not as a brother. Give her to me for a wife, and I swear to devote my life to her happinesss. Annie,\" he continued, turn ing to her, \"you must know how dear, how inexpressibly dear you are to nae. Will you not trust your fate to my care ? \" A momentary silence ensued, but Annie could not resist the wistful, beseeching look on her mother's face ; the mother she was so soon to lose for ever. Without uttering a"], [32, "24 THE CARYLLS. word, she held out her hand to Walter, who pressed it to his lips. \" Ah, my God, I thank you,\" sighed out Mrs. Wood. \" Kiss me, Annie ; kiss me, Walter. If I could but see you married be fore I die, I should have nothing more to wish for on earth ; I could th n depart in peace.\" 11 Annie,\" said Walter, \" I am sure you will not attribute my proposal to any selfish motive, but will you consent to give our mother, for she is mine now as well as yours, the satisfaction which she so anxiously desires ; the last perhaps we may have it in our power to afford her. If you will, there is yet time to obtain a license to-day, and we could be married with the strictest privacy to-morrow.\" Miss Wood was undoubtedly somewhat startled by the idea of these rapid proceedings, but she had gone too far to venture upon throwing any obstacles in the way, which might prevent the accomplishment of her mother's wishes. Perhaps, too, she was desirous of banishing all reflection till it should be too late ; till the irrevocable deed was completed. She replied, simply\u2014"], [33, "THE CARYLLS. 25 \" I am quite ready to do whatever you and my mother think best.\" \" In that case,\" said Walter,\"if you approve, Mrs. Wood, I will be off at once ; procure the license, and make the necessary arrange ments with the clergyman. As soon as I have accomplished that, I will return here.\" Mrs. \"Wood expressed her assent, and in an other minute he was gone. They were both of age, and there was not the slightest difficulty about getting the license. Walter then called on the officiating minister of the nearest church, and was equally successful in his negotiations there. He thought it advi sable to explain the reasons for this apparently extraordinary haste, but the reverend gentle man appeared to think no reasons necessary. He promised to have all in order for the cere mony at eight o'clock next morning, with no one present but the pew -opener and beadle, who would act as witnesses. Very well satisfied with his morning's work, Mr. Caryll returned to Seymour Place about six o'clock, and found, not only that VOL.

Leaving the nurse with her mother, Annie joined him at table, although she was unable to do more than contemplate the very unsentimental voracity of her lover. As soon as he had satisfied his appetite, for which he thought it necessary to apologise, by saying that he had eaten nothing since a nine o'clock breakfast, be detailed to his companion all his morning operations, and then produced a plain gold ring which he begged Annie to try on. Not withstanding the terrible calamity which was impending over them, he was in a state of buoyant spirits and exultation, which he found it very difficult to repress and tone down, so as to be in harmony with their actual situa tion. Annie, on the contrary, seemed to speak and act mechanically ; though present in person, her mind was absent ; her thoughts were concentrated on the sick bed in the adjoining room."], [35, "27 THE CARYLLS. She took the ring without a word, without the colour even rising to her cheeks. \" It fits me very well,\" was all she said. \" I thought it would. I remembered how nearly my little finger and your fourth finger used to be of a size.'' \"If you have finished,\" she said, rising up, \" I will see how my mother is, and if she can see you. She was dozing when I left her.\" She disappeared, but returned in a few minutes. \"Come,\" she said; \"but you must not stay long, and do not let her talk much.\" He followed her into the bed-room, and the nurse retired. \"Have you done all you wished ?\" asked Mrs. Wood. \" All. Everything is settled. I shall be here at a quarter before eight to-morrow to take Annie with me to the church, and on our return I shall claim from you a mother's blessing on us both.\" \" Ah, you have it now. Give me your hands both of you.\" c 2"], [36, "28 THE CARYLLS. They complied; she held their hands joined in hers, and continued \u2014 \" May God bless you both, and grant you long years of happiness in each other's love. Walter, I give you a portionless bride, but, if she is as good a wife as she is a daughter, you will have no reason to repent your choice. Love her, Walter, for she deserves it. If poor in worldly goods, she is rich in virtue and a blameless life.\" \"Oh, mother, mother,\" exclaimed Annie, giving way for the first time to her tears, \"you must not speak such praise of me; it only makes me feel my utter unworthiness. But I will endeavour to make Walter a good wife and to deserve his love. This at least I can safely promise.\" \" I shall die happy,\" said Mrs. Wood, \" in leaving you to his care, for I know no one to whom I would trust your happiness with greater confidence.\" She spoke these last words more feebly, and Walter, in obedience to a sign from Annie, prepared to take his leave. \" I must say good-night now, that I may be"], [37, "THE CARYLLS. 29 ready to-morrow. I trust I leave you a little easier.\" \" I feel very little pain while I lay quite quiet. Good-night, and once more, God bless you.\" Miss Wood followed him into the next room. \" You will be ready, Annie, when I call for you to-morrow,\" he said ; \" we must not keep them waiting at the church.\" She assured him there would be no delay on her part. \"Annie,\" he continued, \"I know nothing of your circumstances ; I have never taken the liberty of enquiring into them ; but pro bably you are not prepared for an emergency of this sort, when your mother ought to have every comfort and luxury that can give her ease. You must let me, therefore, supply any deficiency there may chance to be. If it is not enough you must tell me so to-morrow.\" And he put a purse into her hand. \" No, no, I cannot, indeed.\" \" My dear Annie, remember I am now speaking almost with the authority of a hus-"], [38, "30 THE CARYLLS. band. Henceforward, I hope you will look upon everything as in common between us.\" \" Ah ! how can I ever prove my gratitude to you, not only for your generous kindness, but for the thoughtfulness that prompted it. Yes, I accept it as frankly as it is offered ; and, to tell the truth, we have only a few shillings in the house. My poor mother had gone out to pay our weekly bills when this terrible accident befell her.\" \" And yet your first impulse was to refuse me. Oh, Annie, you cannot love me as I love you.\" She made no answer, but she raised her eyes to his with a look of reproachful tender ness, which he probably deemed satisfactory. He kissed her forehead. \" Good-night, my love,\" he said, \" I will not keep you longer from your mother, but do not sit up all night. You have the nurse to assist you, and you must try to get a little rest, of which I feel sure you must be much in need.\" Various were the thoughts which filled Walter's mind as he walked home that night."], [39, "THE CARYLLS. 31 His heart was full of pity for his kind old friend, for whom he felt something like filial affection, but still it was to the accident which would bereave her of life that he owed the promise of her daughter's hand. To-morrow would see Annie his wife, a consummation which foui -and-twenty hours before he could hardly have ventured to contemplate till months, perhaps years, had elapsed. It was happiness, dearly purchased, no doubt, but still happiness, and had he been addicted to the study of proverbial philosophy, his train of reasoning might have been summed up in the trite adage, \"'Tis an ill wind that blows nobody good.\" Had he thus translated his feelings into words, his selfishness would have filled him with shame and horror. This he was spared, but the germ of the thought was there, though undefined. Then his mind reverted to his promised bride, and the very natural question presented itself, \" Did she love him, or did she not ?'' This was speedily resolved in the affirmative, but the next subject of debate, \"How much?\""], [40, "32 THE CARYLLS. was not so easy of solution. She had ac quiesced in her mother's offer of her hand, it is true, but beyond this she had made no sign, unless, indeed, her promise to make him a good wife might be so interpreted. But this the most indifferent person might undertake with fair hopes of success ; indeed, it may be questioned whether the best wives, the wives who, in the long run, contribute the most to home-happiness, are not to be found, as a general rule, amongst those who start in their married career without any extravagant feel ings of passionate love for their lords. But what lover would be so rational as to barter away a honeymoon of rapturous ecstacy for a life of tranquil, domestic peace. If such there be, assuredly it was not Walter Caryll. For tunately for him, his was a hopeful nature. He called to mind that, with her mother on her death-bed, any exhibition of joy on Annie's part would not only have been in decorous and out of place, but unnatural. He gave her credit for the suppression of her feelings, and if they were not yet as fervid as"], [41, "33 THE CARYLLS. his own, the possibility of which he admitted, he trusted to time and his own devotion for repairing the deficiency. With these thoughts he went to rest, with these thoughts he rose from his pillow. To the intense astonishment of the maid \u2014 for he was not habitually an early riser \u2014 he had ordered himself to be called at six, but long before that hour he was awake. He jumped out of his bed and into his bath, and before the servant knocked at his door he was dressed. His first demand was for breakfast, which was met by a representation that the water had not even thought of boiling, that neither baker nor milk-woman had made their appearance; in short, that for an hour at least, breakfast was out of the question. \"Well, never mind,\" he said; \"it is such a lovely morning, I shall go out for a walk, and shall be back by eleven or twelve.\" Luckily, he always had a store of captain's biscuits in reserve. He put two or three into his pockets, which he began crunching when he found himself clear of the house, c 5"], [42, "34 THE CARYLLS. slaking his thirst, as occasion required, at drinking fountains. His first intention had been to take a stroll in Hyde Park, but, some how or other, his legs seemed determined to carry him, whether he would or no, in the direction of the Edgeware Road. Into Sey mour Place he would not venture, for fear of attracting observation; but he passed a good hour in perambulating the circumjacent streets and squares. More than once he visited the church in which his fate was so soon to be sealed, probably, with a view of satisfying himself that it had not been removed to an inconvenient distance during the night. At length, after consultations innumerable with his watch, he ventured to present himself at Mrs. Wood's door. In another minute he was in Annie's presence, who, in bonnet and shawl, was ready to receive him. \" How is your mother?\" of course, was his first question. \" Much the same. The doctor came again last night after you left us, and said there was no change ; he is coming again soon after ten. She sleeps a great deal by fits and starts,"], [43, "35 THE CARYLLS. which he says is owing to the medicine he sends her. It certainly has diminished the pain, but it is still agony to her to be moved.\" \" Poor mother ! poor dear mother !\" said Walter. \" I will not look in now, for fear of disturbing her ; perhaps she will be awake when we return.\" \" Probably ; she seldom sleeps more than an hour at a time.\" \" If you are ready, Annie, we had better start.\" She accepted the arm he offered her. In a few minutes they were standing at the com munion-rails together, the curate with his book open in front of them, and almost before Annie could realize the fact, she found her self Mrs. Walter Caryll. They adjourned to the vestry to sign the register, when the reverend gentleman, perhaps moved thereto by the very handsome fee proffered to him by Walter, congratulated them in very choice terms, to which the new-made husband re plied in language equally well chosen. \" And I, too, thank you for good wishes,\""], [44, "36 THE CARYLLS. said Annie, \" for I need them. The day that gives me a husband may deprive me of a mother. Pray for her and for us.\" \" Will you have the goodness, sir, to give me a certificate of our marriage,\" said Walter. \" Your mother will like to see it,\" he con tinued, turning to his wife. As soon as they returned home, Annie went straight into her mother's room, and throwing herself on the bed, burst into a pas sion of tears. Mrs. Wood, scarcely less agi tated, did her best to calm her excitement, and after a time succeeded. \" Dry your tears, my love,\" she said, when Annie had a little recovered her self-com mand, \" and go back to your husband, I told them to have some breakfast ready for you ; when that is over, come back to me and bring him with you.\" She complied, after laying aside her bonnet and shawl, but she could only swallow a cup of tea, and Walter was almost as abstemious as herself. They then returned to the bed room, but beyond a few words of welcome and a murmured ejaculation of thankfulness"], [45, "37 THE CARYLLS. that she had been permitted to see the ac complishment of the dearest wish of her heart, Mrs. Wood remained silent. But it was the silence of a mind at ease, free from the cor roding thoughts by which it had been so long oppressed. Her countenance assumed an ex pression of tranquillity and even of happiness, to which, for many a long day, it had been a stranger, while her eyes rested on her chil dren with a look of the deepest sympathy and affection. Thus they remained, buried in their own thoughts, till the doctor was announced. \"I shall wait,'' said Walter, rising from his chair, \" till his visit is over, and then I must leave you for the present. When I came up here yesterday, I left some work unfinished, and unless some one has Lad the good nature to complete it for me, I expect a sharp repri mand. I shall be back by six at latest, and do not wait dinner for me ; I will get some* thing to eat en routed As he left the room the doctor entered it. In little more than ten minutes he returned to the sitting-room."], [46, "38 THE CARYLLS. \"Well, sir, how did you find your patient?\" asked Walter. \" She is going fast. In four-and-twenty hours, in all probability, she will be released from her sufferings.\" \" Good Heavens ! \" Walter exclaimed, greatly shocked ; \" is the end so near ? '' \" Better it should be so. In her state a pro longation of life would only be a prolongation of suffering. May I ask, sir, if you are a friend of the family ? \" \" An intimate one ; indeed the only one they have in London.\" * In that case, perhaps you will have the goodness to warn Miss Wood. It would be false kindness to conceal her mother's state from her, and allow it to come upon her by surprise.\" \" I quite agree with you, and, however painful the task, I will undertake it. And as I should be sorry that Miss Wood should be disturbed by such considerations in the midst of her affliction, I wish you to forward your account to me for settlement. This is my card and address.\""], [47, "THE CARYLLS. 39 With a low bow the doctor took his leave. \" Annie,\" said Walter, knocking at the bed room door, \" I am going ; can I speak to you for a minute.\" She came out at once, and then with the utmost caution and tenderness he communi cated to her the sentence that had just been pronounced. Though not quite unexpected, the certainty that yet another day and she would be motherless, filled her heart with emotions of the bitterest anguish. When first the truth flashed upon her from Walter's rather involved sentences, every vestige of colour fled from her cheeks, and she staggered back, as if she would have fallen, but for her hus band's supporting arm. A burst of tears came to her relief, and to Walter's great satisfaction, she laid her head upon his shoulder with her arms round his neck, while she sobbed aloud. \" My own love,\" he said, \" I was too sudden for you.\" \" Ah, no, it was not that. I have been expecting to hear it every hour, and thought I was prepared, but when it came at last it"], [48, "40 THE CARYLLS. sounded in my ears as if I had never given it a thought ; but it is passed,\" she continued, wiping her eyes; \"I shall not show such weakness again. As long as she lives, for her sake, I must keep up my strength. You had better leave me now, Walter ; I must go back to her ; but you will return as soon as you are able. I have no one but you to lean on now.\" \" I cannot tell you, Annie, how it grieves me to leave you in your affliction, but go I must. If I play truant again to-day, I may get into a serious scrape, but you know where to send for me in case of need.\" He was not far wrong in anticipating a severe reprimand from the immediate head of his department, but when he explained that he had been sent for suddenly to attend an old friend, who had been knocked down by a cart and seriously injured, the excuse was accepted, and he was dismissed, with the advice to him and his friends to be more careful of their persons in future. He had more difficulty in appeasing the wrath of the gentleman who had been detained a couple of hours extra, to"], [49, "41 THE CARYLLS. complete the work which he had left unfinished, but even in this he was at length successful. As soon as he could decently depart, he again sallied forth, and after despatching a couple of mutton-chops at an eating-house, which at any other time he would have thought himself polluted by entering, he was once more de posited in Seymour-place. \" Well, Annie,\" he said, \" any change ? \" \" She is gradually getting weaker, and I think her mind wandered a little a short time ago, but she seems free from pain.\" \" Do you think she would like to see me ?\" \" Yes, no doubt, when she wakes ; she is asleep now.\" But the poor lady never woke again. When the doctor looked in, as he had promised to do about ten o'clock, he pronounced her to be dying, and soon after she breathed her last in the presence of Annie, her husband, and the nurse. Walter drew his wife gently from the room, but made no attempt to check the tears which flowed from her eyes."], [50, "42 THE CARYLLS. \" My love,\" he said, \" You know how deeply, how truly I sympathise with your affliction, for we have both of us lost a mother who deserved all our reverence and love.\" \" Ah, yes, she loved you well. Even at Lynburn you were her favourite, and now she looked upon you as a son.\" \" And she died happy when you gave me the right to call her mother. She is gone to her rest full of peace and hope.\" \" Yes ; I know my tears are selfish, but, when I have recovered from the first sense of my bereavement, I shall be more composed. Now all seems strange to me, like some frightful dream. I can realise nothing ; not even my position with regard to you. And yet without you and your support what would become of me. Dear Walter, however little I deserve it, your love is now my only conso lation. To that I look for refuge from all my troubles.'' \" My life, my love 1 thank God, you feel you can depend upon me.\""], [51, "43 THE CARYLLS. \" I do, I do, implicitly. And now wish me good-night. When shall I see you to morrow ?\" \" Will eight o'clock be too early ? We have much to settle.\" \" Come as early as you please. I shall not sleep much this night.\""], [52, "THE ' CARYLLS. 44 CHAPTER III. As Walter Caryll had said, there was much to settle when he and Annie met on the morrow. An inquest was inevitable, so said the doctor, and the proper officer having been communi cated with, it was appointed to be held on the following day. What to do with Annie was the subject of some discussion, for, notwith standing her husband's remonstrances, she persisted in declaring that she would not leave the house till after the funeral, and she carried her point, although good-natured Mrs. Smith called herself to urge her to remove to the Edgeware Road till that event was over. Walter intended going down to Lynburn him self with the body, and his idea had been to inform his sister Lucy of his marriage, and ask her to receive his wife as her guest till he had provided a proper residence for her. But to this Annie strongly objected. At his"], [53, "45 THE CARYLLS. solicitation, she had given up her intention of going to Lynburn herself ; and now in her turn she urged him to keep their marriage secret till after his return, and he found him- self obliged to comply. At length everything was satisfactorily ad- justed. The inquest was held, and, as I ven- tured to predict in the last chapter but one, the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, to the great triumph and exultation of all the youthful Jehus of the metropolis. Then came the undertaker to perform his hateful office, and at last the house was quiet. Together Walter and Annie entered the room, where lay the mother who had loved and blessed them both in her last moments. Her features not only wore no trace of suffering, but had resumed in au extraordinary degree the beauty for which she had been celebrated some thirty years before, while to the excited imagination of her children she seemed to greet them with a smile, as they approached her last dreary tenement. Walter's activity during that week as tonished even himself. Up early and late, he"], [54, "46 THE CARYLLS. passed hours every day in searching for some lodging in the suburbs for himself and his bride as soon as he should return to town, till he could find a house to suit them, and at last was fortunate enough to discover what he required at Hampstead. Great part of the day he passed in Sey mour Place, rather to the consternation of Mrs. Smith, who was the incarnation of pro priety and decorum, and who could not refrain one day from a very mild expostulation to her young friend on the subject of her passing so much of her time alone with so good-looking an individual of the male sex ; but Annie silenced her scruples by assuring her that Mr. Caryll was a very near connection, and that she was strictly carrying out her mother's last instructions by leaving everything to his management, which necessarily compelled his frequent presence in Seymour Place, there being much he could not settle without con sulting her. Neither did Mr. Caryll neglect his public duties amidst his numerous occupations. He was most assiduous in his attendance at the"], [55, "47 THE CARYLLS. Foreign Office, not, I am sorry to say, from any sense of what he owed to his generous paymasters, the British public, but with the hope of obtaining, as a reward for his industry, a week's leave of absence, which astute piece of man\u0153uvring was crowned with complete success. At length the day arrived on which Mrs. Wood's mortal remains were to be committed to the grave. Walter had written to the present incumbent of Lynburn on the subject, and had received an assurance that everything would be in readiness. He had named an early hour for the ceremony, and as he in- tended going down by a night train the even- ing before, he called about six o'clock to take leave of Annie. For the first time she gave a free loose to the affection she felt for him, and which his considerate kindness, during the last few terrible days, had fully developed. When he took her in his arms and kissed her, as he wished her good-bye, she clung to him with a passionate embrace, as if feeling that she was on the point of separation from the last friend she had upon earth."], [56, "48 THE CAEYLLS. \" My love,\" he said, soothingly, \" it is but for a day. This time to-morrow I shall again be here.\" \" Yes, I know it is foolish to give way to my anxiety ; but how much may happen in a day! Promise me if anything detains you to write to me by the first post.\" \" I do not think it the least likely anything can occur to detain me; but, if it should hap pen, I will telegraph at once. And you will have plenty to occupy your time to-morrow, for I shall expect to find you ready to flit on the day after.\" \" And, Walter,\" she said, with a sort of hesitation, \" if you should meet Mr. Ley cester at Lynburn, shall you tell him of our marriage ?\" \" Certainly not. It is not through him I should wish my family to be informed of it ; but there is not the slightest chance of our meeting. Now that Lynburn is let he never goes there, and just now he is very busy at Tuftons. I had two lines from Caroline yes terday, and she mentioned that he was coming to the Holt with Louisa for a couple of days."], [57, "THE CARYLLS. 49 I think she said they were expected this very day ; but I must not stay gossiping any longer. God bless you, my own dearest love ; when we meet to-morrow I trust it will be to sepa rate no more.\" Mrs. Wood was laid in the same grave with her husband, as she had desired ; and Walter left instructions to put up a monu mental stone, with a suitable inscription, over their remains. He refused all the worthy vicar's hospitality ; not only was he anxious to get back to London with all possible expedition, but he recoiled from the thoughts of visiting the house, in which he had passed so many happy hours, under such altered circumstances. He left Lyn burn again before twelve o'clock, and ar rived in Seymour Place before he was ex pected. Mrs. Caryll had but just got through her packing and other domestic arrange ments. \"Ah ! thank God,\" she exclaimed, as he made his appearance ; \" I have been fancying all sorts of things.\" VOL. in. d"], [58, "50 THE CARYLLS. \" What a foolish, silly wife I have got,\" he said, kissing her fondly. \" Now give me some tea, and I will tell you how all has passed off.\" She listened to all he had to tell with religious attention, an occasional tear trick ling down her face. When he had concluded, a short silence ensued. \" How d^d the old place look ?\" she asked, at length. \"Much as it used to do; but, to tell you the truth, I had not the heart to look about me much. But I noticed that the church and church-yard were thronged, and I recognized some old familiar faces. You are none of you forgotten at Lynburn, Annie. And now tell me what you have been about.\" By a strong effort she regained her com posure. \"I think I have done almost everything that was to be done. The maid is dis charged and gone, and I have engaged the nurse to remain in the house till we can give it up to the landlord at quarter-day. I sup pose the greatest part of the furniture had"], [59, "51 THE CARYLLS. better be sold ; but the books and many little things I should like to keep.\" \" I do not see why we should not keep it all. It is your old Lynburn furniture, solid and serviceable, though a little old-fashioned, and I daresay will suit us. But all this we can talk over at leisure. Have you packed up all you are likely to require for a few weeks, so that we may go to Hampstead to morrow ? That is the great question at pre sent.\" \"Yes. But, Walter\u2014\" \" Well, my love, what is it?\" \" Why, everybody will know that we go away together,\" she said, with some embar rassment, and blushing deeply. \" I ought at least to tell Mrs. Smith and the nurse that we are married.\" \" Yes, of course you must. How inexcus ably stupid of me not to have thought of it before. Only tell Mrs. Smith the circum stances, and say that as I have not yet had time to inform my family of it, we should consider it a great favour if she would keep d 2"], [60, "52 THE CARYLLS. our secret till she sees it announced in the papers, unless, indeed, she were forced to mention it by any malicious gossip. And as seeing is believing, show her our marriage certificate. Say as little about me as you can. I am a clerk in a public office, and we hope to have enough to live on.\" \"And about Mrs. Black?\" asked Annie. \" As for Mrs. Black, we will tell her at once, when she comes up to take the tea things away.\" And accordingly when that lady made her appearance Walter filled out a glass of wine from the solitary bottle in the cupboard, and handed it to her. \" Take this, Mrs. Black,\" he said, \" and I hope you will drink to the good healths of my wife and myself. This lady and I were mar ried yesterday week. We do not wish it to be generally known at present, but we thought it right to tell you, and as you have the char acter of being a thoroughly trustworthy per son, we feel sure it will go no further till we give you leave to speak.\" Mrs. Black drank their healths as Mr. and"], [61, "53 THE CARYLLS. Mrs. Walter, the only name by which Caryll was known to her, wishing them every sort of prosperity, amongst which a numerous progeny held a prominent place, and assuring them of her fidelity. \" But I doubt it is not much of a secret amongst the neighbours,\" she added. \" The tailor's two daughters seed you and miss a coming out of church together, and them young girls is always busy with their guesses, as is but nat'ral.\" \"Well, Mrs. Black, it cannot be helped now; but don't you tell them they have guessed right.\" \" It does not much matter,\" he continued, when the nurse had left the room ; \" my father has returned home from Scotland, but I do not suppose there is any very constant exchange of couriers between Seymour Place and the Holt. I own, however, it would vex me if he were to hear of my marriage from anyone but myself ; it would look so disre spectful. I must see about it as soon as we are settled at Hampstead.\" He did not remain late. Annie was"], [62, "54 THE CARYLLS. thoroughly worn out, and it was evident that the sooner her head was laid on her pillow the better. \"Mrs. Black,\" said Walter, as he went downstairs, \" I leave my wife to your care. You are not to call her or go into her room in the morning upon any account till she rings. Let her sleep as long as she can.\" This prescription was perfectly successful ; Annie slept for ten consecutive hours without a break, the first good night's rest she had enjoyed since her mother's accident. She awoke invigorated and refreshed, and this acted upon her mind ; her thoughts no longer reverted solely to the past, but ventured to look forward to the future. The shade of the mother she had lost began to fade away be fore the reality of the living husband. Her first care after breakfast was to call on Mrs. Smith, who was enchanted on being made the depository of such a secret, and warm in her congratulations. Annie then returned home and endeavoured to occupy herself with a book till her husband's arrival. Her goods and chattels had already been dis-"], [63, "55 THE CARYLLS. patched to Hampstead by the carrier, and soon after four Walter himself arrived in a brougham. \" How extravagant you are !\" said Annie ; \"a cab would have done just as well.\" \u2022'No, my love, not for the first day of our honeymoon. But you will be glad to hear that all your things have arrived in safety. I have been up to Hampstead to see that all was in readiness for your reception, and it really looked quite cheerful. I ordered dinner for six o'clock, so if you are quite ready let us be off.\" Mrs. Caryll took the arm offered her, and in another minute they were on their way to their new abode. \" Now, Annie,\" said her husband, passing his arm round her waist, \" I feel you are really mine, my wife, my treasure, to whose happiness my whole future life will be de voted. Hitherto I have only looked upon you as a reversion, to be claimed at some future day.\" Annie made no reply in words, but she took his hand and silently pressed it to her"], [64, "56 THE CARYLLS. lips. In every word her husband uttered she discovered some fresh proof of his affection \u2014 some additional claim upon her gratitude and love. She was delighted with her new apartment. Having passed the whole of her life in the country, the noise, the smoke, the dust of a small dingy London house, combined with the want of light and air, had contributed to throw an additional gloom over the melan choly position in which she had been placed by her father's death. Though so quiet and generally so reserved in her deportment, she was very much a creature of impulse, and as they gradually left the crowded streets behind them, her spirits rose, and seemed to partake of the elasticity of the purer air she breathed. Their landlady, who was really what she professed to be, the widow of a lieutenant in the navyr, had done her best to make them comfortable. The apartment was scrupu lously clean, and tolerably well furnished, while from a small garden in front of the house a bed of mignonette sent its perfume through the open windows. The dinner was"], [65, "57 THE CARYLLS. ready to a minute, well-dressed and well served; a greater ingredient in domestic com fort than lovers are always willing to allow. As soon as it was over, Annie, casting off a little of the shyness incidental to her new position, said \u2014 \" Now, Walter, you must positively take me out for a walk. I have heard so much of Hampstead Heath from some of my pupils, that I am longing to see it.\" \" Je suis aux ordres de Madame. Perhaps, too, you would like to have a gallop on a donkey, which, no doubt, constituted its prin cipal charm in their eyes.\" They were soon on the heath, aud it was with almost childish delight that Annie found herself once more in the midst of gorze, heath, and ferns. \" Oh, if we could but live here !\" she said. \"I am afraid,\" her husband replied, \"it is a little too far from my work; but at all events, we will keep out of the heart of Lon don. I saw a house in St. John's Wood ad vertised, which, from the description, I should d 5"], [66, "58 THE CARYLLS. think would just suit us. We will look after it without loss of time, for my holiday only lasts till the end of the week, and I want to get settled as soon as may be. And now, my love, let us go back ; it is getting dark.\" The next morning after breakfast, Walter announced his intention of calling on Mrs. Shoreham, for the purpose of informing her of his marriage, and concerting with her the best means of notifying it to his family and the world at large. Mrs. Caryll made some faint objections. Was it absolutely necessary to be in such a hurry ? Could not he give her one day more entirely to herself? Per haps she was afraid of a disagreeable scene between her husband and his sister ; remon strances and disparaging observations on the wife he had chosen. \" My love,\" Walter replied, \"if you really wish it, I will put it off till to-morrow; but it must be done sooner or later, and, believe me, the sooner the better. If by any acci dent our marriage were to become known, it might have most vexatious consequences for"], [67, "59 THE CARYLLS. me, and injurious ones for you. So now de cide.\" She did decide and, like an amiable and reasonable woman, told her husband to do what he thought best. \" And what will you do while I am away?\" \" I shall unpack and arrange all my things. We may as well make ourselves comfortable while we remain.\" \" That is just my principle. If I go into a place for a week, I settle myself in it, as if I were to pass the rest of my days there, and this apartment is engaged for a month. If we were to take a house to-day, what with furnishing and all that sort of thing, we could not get into it in less time, if so soon. And that puts me in mind ; let us dine at four, and afterwards we will go and look at the house I was speaking of yesterday. Have you any objection?\" Annie acquiesced. \" Then I will be off at once,\" he said, \"that I may be back in time.\" He had not to go far before he met a cab, which, after rather an intricate navigation,"], [68, "60 THE CARYLLS. deposited him at his sister's door. To his surprise, and, it must be confessed, greatly to his satisfaction, he found her alone, mending a chemise of Miss Shoreham's. \"What!\" was his first exclamation, 'not a son or a daughter to be seen ; what is the meaning of it ?\" \" Walter at last ;\" she said, \" what have you been about that we have seen nothing of you for more than a fortnight ?\" \" All in good time ; but first answer my question; where are the children?\" \" I have sent them all to the gardens. Poor dears ! T always send them now by the back way behind the barracks, for fear of their meeting that horrid man who frightened them so. Bobby saw him in dreams for a week afterwards.\" \" Oh, they will never meet him again. De pend upon it by this time he is either hanged or transported.\" \" If he is not,\" she replied, \" I am sure he ought to be.\" \"Or worse still, Lucy; he may be mar ried.\""], [69, "THE CARYLLS. 61 \" If he is I shall pity his wife, poor thing ; but never mind him now ; tell me where you have been all this time.\" \"I have had no end of things to do. Amongst other trifling occupations, I have followed your advice and got married.\" \" Married ! married a wife !\" she ex claimed, letting Gualdrada's under-garment fall. \" Yes, married a wife ; what else could I marry, being of the male sex ?\" \"Dear Walter, do not joke; are you really serious ?\" \" Perfectly serious, and I am come to tell you all about it.\" The tone in which he spoke left no doubt that he was in earnest. He told her the whole story of his acquaintance with Annie Wood, from the time of his first entrance in to her father's house to his accidental meeting with her in the park, and its consequences, the re newal of his boyish attachment, and his hasty marriage, so soon followed by her mother's death. It is needless to say that Lucy Shoreham"], [70, "62 THE CARYLLS. listened to the narrative with wrapt attention, interrupted by occasional exclamations of surprise, commiseration, and sympathy. \" Oh, my dear Walter,\" she said, when he had concluded, and kissing him, \" howl long to make her acquaintance, and wish her joy. I feel certain that I shall love her ; and I think your conduct was just what it ought to be ; everybody must admit that. I can quite understand that you had no time for prepara tions, or to tell us. Poor thing ! poor young thing! what a situation, and borne so meekly, so patiently ; but she has found her reward at last. I always said you would make the happiness of any woman you love, and I am convinced she will make you a good wife.\" '\u2022 Thanks, dearest Lucy, you have set my mind quite at ease, and I hope you will give me your assistance, too, in breaking it to my father.\" \" Certainly ; what is it you wish me to do ?\" \" Would you mind writing to him? It is such a long story, I should never get through it; and women write so much better than men.\""], [71, "THE CARYLLS. 63 ''No, you must write to him yourself, if but a few lines ; it is your duty. But I will write to Caroline by the same post, and give her the whole history, as you have told it me. You can refer him to her for particulars.\" \" Well, Lucy, Shoreham says you are the best of wives, and I say you are the best of sisters. When will you write ? \" \" To-morrow. I should like to talk it over first with George.\" \" By-the-bye, what will he say ? \" \" Oh, he will say little or nothing ; he will take it as a matter of course. Perhaps he will regret that there is not a little money forthcoming, and indeed that is the only drawback. I wish her poor father had not been robbed by those wretches.\" \" So do I. But that is passed, and as long as I am satisfied to marry her without money, nobody has a right to object on that score.\" \"No, I suppose not. But, dear Walter, you know you are a little inclined to be ex travagant ; you must study economy now. You have enough to live on very comfort ably at present ; much more than George"], [72, "64 THE CAEYLLS. and I started with ; but if you have children, you will find many calls upon you of which you do not now think.\" \" Yes, but if my family increases, it is to be hoped my salary will go on increasing too. And if it comes to a pinch, perhaps your friend Miss Harebell will give us a lift out of her superfluity.\" \" Rosabella Harebell ! Oh, my dear Walter, do not mention her. What an escape you had! Only fancy, she has run off with an attorney's clerk, barely eighteen, of the name of Scroggs. She is now Mrs. Jeremiah Scroggs.\" \" Well, Scroggs is better than Snooks, at all events ; and unless my memory fails me, there was, once upon a time, a learned chief justice of that name.\" \" And poor Sir William is in such a state of distress. He told George he should allow her nothing but one hundred a year, and he does not know what to do with the rest of his money. Is it not shocking ? \" \"Very. He had better make it over to me.\""], [73, "65 THE CAEYLLS. \" And that is not the worst of it,\" con tinued Mrs. Shoreham. \" The servants are so insolent, and will not mind a word he says. George went home with the poor old man one day, and he is convinced that if Sir William does not get rid of the housekeeper, she will end by compelling him to marry her.\" \" Nothing more likely. It is the common fate of unprotected, elderly males. And, to tell you the truth, it was one principal reason for my own marriage. I took it into my head that my Mount Street landlady was begin ning to cast sheep's eyes at me, and as she is what the public would call rather hard favoured, I thought it time to provide for my personal safety. But I must say good-bye. I know poor dear Annie is in a state of great anxiety about the results of our interview, though she would not say so.\" \" Shall I go with you ? \" suddenly ex claimed Lucy. \" Will you ? It would be the very kindest thing you could do ; the greatest obligation you could confer on us.\""], [74, "66 THE CAEYLLS. \" Wait, then, one minute, till I have given orders about the children, and put on my bonnet. But you must bring me back.\" \" Of course I will.\""], [75, "THE CAEYLLS. 67 CHAPTER IV. For the first time in her life, Mrs. Shoreham found herself in a Hansom, a vehicle for which she had no greater predilection than her sister Louisa \u2014 from a different motive, however. Mrs. Leycester could not quite reconcile it to her ideas of feminine pro- priety ; while to Lucy the principal objection was the rapidity of the motion and the hair- breadth escapes, not only of the passengers it carried, but of the pedestrians it threatened to crush at every turn. On the present occa- sion, however, she seemed to take no note of the dangers awaiting herself and others, although the driver, excited by the promise of liberal pay, urged the horse to the utmost speed. It was only when ascending the last hill, that the kindness of her heart made her propose getting out and walking, to give a little ease to the panting brute which had so"], [76, "68 THE CAEYLLS.- gallantly brought them thus far on their way. But Walter assured her that they were just at home, and in fact in another ten minutes they reached the house. He preceded his sister up stairs. \" Oh ! Walter,\" said his wife, \" I am so glad you are come ; dinner is almost ready. Does not the room look nice ?\" It did indeed. A few books and knick knacks on the table, and a vase filled with fresh flowers, which the lieutenant's widow had permitted Mrs. Caryll to pick in the garden, gave the apartment that refined look of home-comfort which female taste alone knows how to impart. But her husband had no time to notice it, still less to admire. \" Annie,\" he said, as Mrs. Shoreham ap peared at the door, \" my sister Lucy is come to pay you a visit, and make your acquaint ance.\" At this announcement Mrs. Caryll turned pale, but Lucy's arms were around her in a moment. \" Dear Annie,\" she said, \" you must forgive my taking you in this way by surprise, but I"], [77, "THE CAEYLLS. 69 was so anxious to know my dear brother's wife, to be the first to wish her joy and welcome her into our family, that I insisted upon his bringing me here with him.\" The warmth of this greeting brought tears into Annie's eyes, and she murmured some thing about hoping to deserve the kindness now shown her. Fortunately, the servant made an useful diversion, by asking if she should lay the things for dinner. \" Yes, directly,\" said Walter, \" and for three. My dear Lucy, you are really born with a silver spoon in your mouth. This is our dinner and your luncheon, so make the most of it. I frightened you out of yours at home by the strange news I had to tell.'' Their little parlour opened into the sitting room, and they were soon seated round the table, discussing the good things which had been provided. Annie was a little discom posed by her husband's announcing that the dinner was of her ordering, but there was no cause for alarm. The salmon was excellent, the cutlets with tomato sauce met with"], [78, "70 THE CAEYLLS. universal approbation, and the roast fowl was done to a turn. Nor did the master of the feast allow the guests to die of thirst. He had sent in two or three dozen of wine, amongst which happened to be some champagne, which soon made its genial in fluence felt. By the time the bottle was finished and the gooseberry tart disposed of, even Annie became a little more communi cative, for hitherto her conversation had been confined to monosyllables. \" Now, Walter,\" said Mrs. Shoreham, \" you must take me home. But before I go, fix a day for bringing Annie to dine with us. Will Sunday suit you ?\" Annie looked at her black dress, and Lucy continued \u2014 \" Yes, I know, poor dear, but we shall be quite alone, and you will not mind a brother and sister.\" And so it was settled ; the invitation for Sunday, the only day which Shoreham could call his own, was accepted, and Lucy prepared for departure."], [79, "71 THE CAEYLLS. \" Shall you be gone long, Walter ?\" asked his wife, casting rather a wistful look out of doors. \" Not knowing, can't say. But I am not going at all without you, This is what I propose, Lucy ; the brougham, or rather a brougham \u2014 for we have not yet arrived at the dignity of the brougham\u2014 will be here in five minutes, to take us to St. John's Wood, which is so much on your way home. When you have deposited us at the house we are going to see, it shall take you on to Kensing ton. You shall go home like a lady, Lucy.\" \" But how will you and Annie manage to come home ?'' \" We will walk. It cannot be more than a mile, or a mile and a half at the outside, over the fields, and a very pretty walk it is. I am sure Annie will enjoy it much more than being boxed up in a coach.'' \" It is really a great shame to deprive you of your carriage, Annie.\" \" No, indeed ; I shall like the walk of all tilings. I cannot imagine why, if it is so near, Walter ordered a carriage at all.\""], [80, "72 THE CAEYLLS. \" To throw dust in the eyes of the house agent. If he were to see a couple of travel stained pilgrims, foot-sore and weary, knock at his door, he would turn up his nose at us, and send us about our business. Now, you will see him as obsequious as you could pos sibly desire ; or it may have been owing to a second sight of Lucy's visit.\" The brougham drove up to the door, and before long, having called at the agent's for a card to view, they found themselves at the gate of Antwerp Villa, Boundary Eoad. \" What a dear little house,\" said Lucy\u00bb who, notwithstanding her impatience to get home, could not resist the temptation of going over it. And it really deserved the praise she had bestowed upon it. It stood completely de tached, at the distance of a few yards from the road, and with what might be called, without much exaggeration, a large garden in the rear, neglected certainly, but perhaps none the worse for that, as it offered freer scope for the horticultural genius of the in coming tenant. The house itself consisted of"], [81, "73 THE CAEYLLS. two good-sized sitting-rooms, with windows at each end, and four bed-rooms ; but what especially captivated Mrs. Caryll's attention was a green-house at the back, which, at a slight expense, might be converted into a conservatory opening into the drawing room. \" I think it quite charming,\" she said, as she emerged from a tour of inspection in the lower regions. \" Yes,\" observed her husband, \" it looks as if it would suit us.\" \"It looks perfect in its way,\" said Mrs. Shoreham; \"but if I were you,\" she added, always under the influence of her dominant idea, which she was rather in the habit of ven tilating in season and out of season, \"I would only take it by the year ; it has little or no nursery accommodation.\" An observation which passed without com ment, although it elicited a smile from Walter and a blush from his wife. \"And now good-bye,\" continued Mrs. Shoreham ; \" George must be at home by vol. in.

Our letters ought to reach the Holt at the same time.\" \" I will not forget ; but, dear Lucy, while you are about it, I wish you would write to Maud also.\" \"Now, Annie,\" said Mrs. Shoreham, \"you see the sort of husband you have married. As soon as one does one good-natured thing for him he asks for another ; but I really do not see how I can manage two such long letters as they would be, in one day ; and I am so busy looking over the children's clothes.\" '' No, no,\" replied her brother, \" it is too much to ask you ; it would be downright cruelty to animals. Just begin your letter, * My dear sister,' and set Shoreham's clerk to copy it. There will only be the address to alter ; or if that does not suit your ideas, tell Caroline to forward your letter to Maud, and say you are too busy and I am too shy to"], [83, "THE CAEYLLS. 75 write. I will write just one line to Brentford to say I am married, without a word more. That will give them something to guess at for a day or two.'' \" Yes, that will do very well. Do not for get Sunday.\" And shaking hands with her brother, and kissing his wife, Mrs Shoreham entered the brougham and drove off. \" Do you like her, Annie ?\" Walter asked, a little anxiously. \" How could I do otherwise, even if I tried ? I think she has the most winning ways about her of any woman I ever saw.\" The house was taken for three years, rather a longer period than Mrs. Shoreham had ad vised, and then began the troublesome occu pation of furnishing. The best of the articles in Seymour Place were retained, and the rest sold. For what they were obliged to buy, Walter gave his wife carte blanche, but fortu nately for him the experience of the last year had taught her the value of money, and she felt no inclination to abuse her husband's liber- e 2"], [84, "THE CARYLLS. 76 ality. All she bought was good, and in good taste, without being exorbitantly dear. In the meantime answers had been received from Sir Edward and Miss Caryll. The latter wrote dirt-ct to Annie, greeting her as a sister, and hoping that she would insist upon Walter's bringing her as soon as possible to the Holt, where they were all most anxious to make her acquaintance. Sir Edward's letter to his son was equally kind, though written in a somewhat graver tone. He regretted that the marriage had been celebrated in so hurried and private a manner, without a single member of the family being present, though he admitted that, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, it was perhaps unavoidable. Then he went on to say \u2014 \" With regard to the prudence of the step you have taken, I say nothing ; you are old enough to judge for yourself. You know what your income is, and it is for you so to regulate your expenses that it may suffice for your wants. That is your business. For us"], [85, "77 THE CARYLLS. it is sufficient to know that you have married a gentlewoman, well brought up, and of an amiable disposition. Lucy speaks highly in praise of her beauty and pleasing manners. You will give her my love, and assure her that in me she will always find a father, and at the Holt a home, and I need not say that you have, both of you, my warmest wishes and most earnest prayers for your future happiness and welfare. I enclose a cheque for fifty pounds ; 1 wished to send your bride a present, but in the country that is not easy, and therefore I must request her to select something for herself. Ever, my dear Walter, your affectionate father, E. Caryll.\" To Lord Brentford Walter had written very laconically. \" My dear B., \u2014 I am married. Wish me joy both of you. \u2014 W. Caryll.\" To which his lordship telegraphed an imme diate reply \u2014 \"You old humbug, we don't believe a word you say. Explain.\""], [86, "78 THE CARYLLS. A message which it required all the noble lord's influence to get forwarded. Louisa Leycester happened to call at the Holt on the very morning that brought Lucy's letter, and she returned to Tuftons brimful of the news. \" Only fancy,\" was her first exclamation to her husband, \" Walter is married !\" \" The devil he is ! With whom has he been making a fool of himself.\" Mrs. Leycester was too well accustomed by this time to her husband's rather emphatic way of expressing himself to take exception to it ; perhaps she thought the phrase not alto gether inappropriate. At all events, she merely replied \u2014 \" He has married a Miss Wood \u2014 But you must know her; she is daughter of your old tutor, Mr. Wood, the vicar of Lynburii.\" \" What ! Miss Wood ; Annie Wood !\" \" I think Caroline did say her name was Annie. What sort of a girl is she?\" Mr. Leycester had begun walking rapidly up and down the room, as was his custom when anything occurred to disturb his equa-"], [87, "THE CARYLLS. 79 nimity. On hearing his wife's question, he stopped at one of the windows opening on the garden where a man was at work. \" D that fellow ; he is doing it all wrong,\" he exclaimed, rushing out to prevent further mischief. In less than five minutes he returned. \"I beg your pardon, Louisa,\" he said, \" but that man, I verily believe, is the stupidest hound I ever came across. So Walter and Annie Wood are married. Pray, when you write, offer them my congratulations.\" \" Of course ; but I was asking you what sort of a girl she is.\" \" Well, I hardly know ; it is so long since I have seen her, and when I knew her, she was little more than a child. She was clever, I believe, not averse to admiration, and rather disposed to flirt, perhaps ; but that all girls are more or less. In short, I know nothing against her personally ; but she is not a wife for Walter Caryll, for she cannot have a shil ling. Her father was a good sort of man, and respectable enough in his way, but a man"], [88, "80 THE CARYLLS. of no family; and he contrived to lose all he had saved by speculations of some sort or other. Her mother was the silliest of the silly, and she herself has never been in any society. If Walter is satisfied, well and good ; but she can never be a suitable companion for his sisters. I hope you will not encourage any intimacy.\" \" It does not sound tempting, certainly,\" said Louisa ; \" but Lucy liked much the little she saw of her.\" \" Mrs. Shoreham is an excellent person,\" rejoined Leycester. \" Unfortunately, she knows no more of the world than her youngest child. But tell me how it all came about.\" Mr. Shoreham, as his wife had predicted, said little or nothing, when informed of his brother-in-law's marriage. \" Walter has as good a right to please him self as I had,\" was his only observation. \" And now, Lucy, that you have preached all your brothers and sisters, except one, into matrimony, upon whom do you mean to exer-"], [89, "81 THE CARYLLS. cise your talents next ? Caroline is, of course, out of the question, and our friend Rosabella has placed herself beyond your reach.\" \" Ah ! poor Caroline. I wish she had ac cepted Lord Isleworth. It would have made no difference to papa, for they could all have lived together.\" \" I wonder you never tried your hand on Sir Edward.\" \" Perhaps I might, if I could have found a woman like my mother ; but that can never be. And, dear George, do not joke about them ; it gives me pain to hear you.\" \" Forgive me, Lucy ; it was thoughtless, but it shall never happen again. You have spoilt me by bearing with my impertinence as you do.\" With such friendly dispositions on the part of the Shorehams, both husband and wife, Annie had no cause to repent the acceptance of their invitation. She felt herself at home, not only with the master and mistress of the house, but with the numerous tribe of nephews and nieces she had so lately acquired, and e 5"], [90, "82 THE CARYLLS. who had been duly instructed to address her as Aunt Annie, aud strictly enjoined on no account to ask her why she was dressed in black. It was so long since she had found herself living in the society of her equals, that she was hardly able to realize the present change in her fortunes, or rather it seemed as if her past struggles were but an uneasy dream, fast fading away before the new pros pects opening to her. When she retired to the drawing-room with Mrs. Shoreham after dinner, the embarrass ment she had at first experienced disappeared, and under the influence of Lucy's cordial manners, the conversation between the two was carried on with as much ease and freedom, as if they had known each other for years. Annie even ventured to offer a few sugges tions on juvenile education, the fruits of her own experience, which were gratefully ac cepted by her sister-in-law, aud treasured up for future use. Meantime Shoreham had been impressing upon Walter the propriety of making a settle ment of his available property, and with such"], [91, "83 THE CARYLLS. sucess that he was authorized to make any arrangement he might deem advisable. They were soon summoned to coffee upstairs, and the conversation, leaving law and education on one side, turned almost exclusively to topics of a family nature ; Edward's last letter from Aden, the movements of the Brent fords, the alterations at Tuftons, Sir Edward's exploits on the Scottish moors, all were dis cussed in turn. Well was it for Annie that, thanks to Walter's gossiping disclosures, she was so well up in Caryll history. If she did not take an active part in the debate herself, she listened with interest to the details relat ing to the various members of the family she had entered, till Mr. Shoreham put a stop to it by saying \u2014 \" How selfish we are ! Here we are talk ing the whole evening on subjects which can not be particularly amusing to Mrs. Caryll.\" \" Indeed you are mistaken. Everything relating to Walter's family interests me. I seem to be making the acquaintance of all my new connections.\" \"And, George,\" said his wife, \"call her"], [92, "84 THE CARYLLS. Annie. I am sure she will like it ; it will make her feel more en famille with us ; will it not, dear ?\" \" Yes, I shall like it, though I do not think anything can make me feel more en famille than your kindness has done already.\" \" Then Annie be it in future,\" said Shore ham. \" And indeed I might almost claim it as a right, for, be it understood, I am the foundation stone of your marriage. When Sir Edward wished to send Walter to a tutor's, it was to me he applied to make enquiries on the subject, and I was fortunate enough to hear of your excellent father.\" The evening came to a close, and the car riage was announced; but before they de parted Shoreham left the room, and returned with a mahogany case under his arm. \" Annie and Walter,\" he said, \" as you did not choose to allow us an opportunity of offering you anything before your marriage, we condemn you to accept this now. It is the joint gift of Lucy and myself.\" He unlocked the case and disclosed a very handsome silver tea-pot with cream jug, tea-"], [93, "85 THE CARYLLS. spoons, and all the other necessary appurten ances. \" Oh, indeed, we ought not to accept this,\" said Annie. \" Not accept it !\" exclaimed her husband. \" I like that. I accept, at all events, if only for the sake of thanking Shoreham and Lucy for their magnificent present. And, my dear Annie, believe me we could not disappoint them more than by a refusal.\" \"Thank you, Walter; you do us justice,\" said his sister. \" And, dear Annie, you must not reject this our first gift.\" \" Ah !\" cried Annie, with tears in her eyes, \" if my dear mother could but witness the generous kindness with which my husband's family have received me.\" \" And now come,\" said her husband, who did not wish to prolong the scene. \" Mrs. Walter Caryll's carriage stops the way. I think we had better leave our plate in Lucy's care till we get into our house. I should not like to leave it about in a lodging ; somebody might take a fancy to it and annex it.\" The following days brought letters of con-"], [94, "86 THE CARYLLS. gratulation from various quarters, and all couched in the most cordial language. Even Louisa Leycester's affection for her brother overcame her husband's cold-blooded sugges tions. But the warmest of all these effusions came from the Brentfords. Amongst other things his lordship said his telegram had not been dispatched ten minutes, when they re ceived a letter from Miss Caryll enclosing Lucy's. \" By that night's post,\" he continued, \" I wrote off to Beatrice to tell her of the great event, without mentioning the lady's name, and I added, ' As you are so fond of betting, I will lay you half-a-crown you do not guess who the bride is.' By Jove, sir, by return of post I received a scrap of paper just contain ing these words, ' W. C.'s bride is Ann, only daughter of the late Rev. Thomas Wood, vicar of Lynburn. Send me thirty stamps. \u2014 B. L.' Now what I want to know is whether you communicated your marriage to her, in which case of course there would be no guessing required, and Miss Bee might whistle for her stamps But if you did not a much"], [95, "87 THE CARYLLS. more serious question arises, viz., how we are to deal with a person who contrives to make herself acquainted with our intentions before they are formed, in other words, with a pro fessor of the black art. I should be sorry to burn her, or even to give her a swim, but something must be done. I strongly suspect Mrs. Howe of being her familiar, and never had a good opinion of that lady's morality since the scrape she got me into by shamming drunk.\" With a great deal more to the same effect. Lady Brentford wound up by saying \u2014 \" We return to town to-morrow week. Remember you are engaged to dine with us on that day, and of course you will bring Annie with you. We shall be quite alone.\""], [96, "88 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER V. Mrs. Caryll found herself completely adopted by all the members of her husband's family with whom she came in contact, and under the influence of these new associations her animation returned. She was rather shocked at first when she made the discovery, that she was fast recovering from the depression con sequent on her mother's death ; but, in truth, the change was natural enough. The be reavement which had befallen her had struck her with double force, coming as it did upon a mind almost prostrated by the sudden transition from affluence to poverty, from luxuries to privations, from the cheerful society of Lyn burn to a monotonous life of toil and depend ence. To these may be added, last, though not least, the bitter grief and mortification of finding herself abandoned by the man she had loved and trusted. Now, all these causes"], [97, "89 THE CARYLLS. of disquietude had disappeared. She had emancipated herself from the thraldom of unrequited affection, and was married to a husband for whom she not only felt love and esteem, but on whom she could thoroughly depend ; she was restored to that class of society in which her younger days had been passed; and, if not wealthy, she might fairly look forward to a life of ease and inde pendence. She had naturally great conversational powers, and her mind had been well culti vated by her father, who had taken as much pains with his only child as with the most favoured of his pupils, though not quite in the same direction. Mrs. Shoreham, when she had broken through the barriers of Annie's reserve, was astonished at her accurate know ledge of history and modern literature, to which she added many of the minor feminine accomplishments. She speedily became ar great favourite of the Brentfords. Maud, who by reason of her situation, assumed no inconsiderable amount of 'despotic power, fre quently sent the carriage to Hampstead with"], [98, "90 THE CARYLLS. a request that Mrs. Caryll would come and pass the morning with her, as she was not feeling very well ; and these morning visits were generally prolonged till a latish hour at night, Walter being smmmoned to dine in Portman Square and escort his wife home. In consequence of her mother's recent death Annie went nowhere, except to her two sisters-in-law, and soon her visits were con- fined to Portman Square, as the Shorehams followed their usual practice of going for a few weeks to the sea side. It frequently happened, however, that at Lady Brentford's she met visitors on their way through town. It was a perfect God-send to find any one established in London at that time of year ; and then occasionally Lord Brentford asked Bob this or Cecil that, whom he had met in the street, to dinner. At first Annie expressed a wish to return to Hampstead when the \u2022advent of these interlopers was announced, but she was assured that nobody would take any notice of her, and that, as Walter was expected, it would disappoint him if he were to find she had gone home without him."], [99, "91 THE CARYLLS. Moreover, she saw that her husband enjoyed these accidental meetings with old friends, and her opposition ceased. Thus by degrees her list of acquaintance increased, and, as it was impossible to resist the joyous animation which Lord Brentford threw into everything he did or said, without perhaps being aware of it she bore her part in the conversation as freely as everybody else; and certainly with success, for more than one of the guests re marked, \" What an agreeable woman Mrs. Caryll is! Where did Walter pick her up?\" No one was more surprised by Annie's display of social talent than Louisa Leycester, who, on some pretence or other, had run up to London for a day or two, without her hus band. From the portrait drawn of her by Mr. Leycester, Louisa had pictured her new sister-in-law to herself as a sort of handsome, flirting, boisterous, country hoyden, instead of which she found her quiet and ladylike, rather retiring in her manners, and without a particle of vulgarity or affectation. That she was used to good society, notwithstanding the retirement in which she was said to have"], [100, "92 THE CARYLLS. passed her life, was evident, and this seemed to be accounted for by a scene which Louisa witnessed on the day after her arrival. The two sisters and Annie were seated round a table, carefully examining for the fortieth time certain articles forming part of the trousseau of the expected heir, when Lady Stansted, the grande dame par excellence of the county in which Lynburn was situated, and with whom the Brentfords had passed a few days in the country, was announced. On entering the room, she said that she could not refrain, on her way through London, from calling to see how Lady Brentford was going on, to which piece of civility Maud made an appropriate reply, and then introduced her sister and Annie. To the former, Lady Stan sted made a gracious bow, accompanied by a few gracious words, and then, turning to Mrs. Caryll, and kissing her, she said \u2014 \" No need of introduction here, Annie, is there ? I saw your marriage in the paper, and was in hopes of obtaining your address from Lady Brentford, but to meet you here is a greater pleasure than I expected.\""], [101, "THE CARYLLS. 93 \" Oh, Annie is quite my right hand,\" said Maud ; \" I do not know what we should do without her.\" \" That is just what we used to say when we had her amongst us; and I assure you, I, for one, get on very badly since I lost her.\" \" She and Walter dine with us to-day. \"Will you and Lord Stansted join our party? You and Annie must have so much to talk >i over. \" I should like it of all things, but unfor tunately we leave town at six for Folkestone. I think I must persuade you to let me run off with Annie for a couple of hours. Lord Stansted would be so sorry to miss seeing her, and I promise to return her safe and sound.\" After a few more civil speeches, in the course of which Lady Stansted expressed her hopes that Louisa would persuade Mr. Ley cester to return to Lynburn, which she knew to be impossible, the house being let for a term of years, she took her departure, accom panied by Mrs. Caryll. As soon as the door was closed upon them, Lady Brentford re-"], [102, "94 THE CARYLLS. marked how pleasant it was to see their sister-in-law such a favourite with those who knew her before her marriage. \" It is, indeed,\" Louisa replied. \" I am most agreeably surprised, for, to tell you the truth, I was afraid she would be a drag upon us all. And I suspect Mr. Leycester will be equally surprised ; since he knew her she seems to have made a great flight upwards.\" Whether Mr. Leycester was as much sur prised by the accounts which his wife sent him of Annie's various perfections, as she had anticipated, may be doubted ; he cer tainly showed no anxiety to verify them by personal observation. He had promised Louisa to come to London and escort her back to Tuftons, but when the time for her return home arrived, something or other oc curred to prevent his redeeming his promise. Whether this was a relief, or not, Annie could not quite determine. On the one hand, she wished the first meeting was over; on the other, she dreaded lest she should show signs of embarrassment which might be mis interpreted. In her own thoughts she had"], [103, "THE CARYLLS. 95 often rehearsed the part she would be called upon to play ; she meant to meet him as a common acquaintance, whose very existence she had almost forgotten, and to make him feel by the coldness of her manner that every vestige of regard was eradicated from her mind; that the only feeling left was one of the most complete indifference. But whether she could enact the scene as she had planned it, was a matter of doubt, especially as she knew Leycester well enough to feel convinced that, far from assisting her, he would do his best to disconcert her if possible. He was not a man to submit patiently to rebuke, though only implied. On the whole, how- ever, she was inclined to look upon his absence as a reprieve. All chance of their meeting seemed now to be deferred till the visit which she and Walter were to pay at the Holt later in the year. In the meantime they had entered upon possession of their house at St. John's Wood, and grateful as Mrs. Caryll felt for the affec tionate good-will constantly manifested to her by Lady Brentford, she would willingly have"], [104, "96 THE CARYLLS. devoted more time to her domestic occupations, instead of passing day after day in Portman Square. But this was impossible. One morning Lord Brentford burst into Antwerp Villa, just as the inmates were sitting down to breakfast. \" Annie,\" he exclaimed, \" I have brought the carriage, and you are to come with me directly. You had not left us an hour when Maud felt unwell ; we sent for the doctor at once, and in a couple of hours the honourable Edward Oakley was ushered into an admiring worlL As for me, I flatter myself that I am the finest specimen of a papa extant ; so take a good look at me, and then get on your bonnet.\" \" How are Maud and the child going on?\" asked Annie. \" Famously. Maud said ' fetch Annie,' and baby screamed out, 'make haste.'\" \"My dear Brentford,\" said Walter, \"I congratulate you most sincerely, and am free to confess that you have acquired a tinge of respectability since we parted a few hours ago. But if you suppose that I will allow you to carry off my wife unbreakfasted, because"], [105, "97 THE CARYLLS. yours has presented you with a son, you are mistaken. So sit down quietly, and have something yourself, till she is ready to go with you.\" His lordship was obliged to comply, although he declared that Maud would be in a fever of impatience till he returned with his captive. It was more than half-an-hour before he was allowed to depart, carrying off the Carylls in triumph, for Walter also was anxious to have a look at the new-comer, before attending to his public duties. And thus Annie's fate was sealed for the next three weeks. Lady Brent ford declared that she could not do without her, and it was only by a determined and vigor ous effort of free-will that she obtained per mission to return every night to her own house. Although it can hardly be said that Walter's marriage was a consequence of the precepts instilled into him by Lucy Shoreham, he strictly followed her advice in another par ticular ; he regulated his establishment upon a system of prudent economy, and in this he was entirely approved by his wife. She had VOL. III. f"], [106, "98 THE CARYLLS. suffered too much from the ills which poverty brings in its train not to dread a relapse ; she had no expensive tastes ; and for the present she was debarred from mixing in general society, even had she wished to do so, which was not the case. With the exception of an occasional county ball, she had never been initiated in social dissipation on a large scale, and she felt no desire to begin now. What she did like was the familiar intercourse of a few intimates and friends, such as she had met with in the country houses to which she had been admitted as a welcome guest, and which she now sometimes found at the Brentfords. Perhaps she felt, for everyone has an instinc- tive knowledge of his, or her, own capabili- ties and deficiencies, that she was better able to play a part, that she was more likely to be appreciated in a small circle of acquaintance, than in a larger assemblage of persons, most of whom, in all probability, had never heard her name, and by whom she would remain unnoticed. She had many amiable qualities, but till she was known they lay hid beneath the surface ; she had great powers of intellect,"], [107, "THE CARYLLS. 99 but they remained undiscovered till some thing occurred to draw them out. Her cold demeanour did her injustice. Nor was Caryll himself more anxious to renew his acquaintance with the great world. He had had the run of it for some time ; he had enjoyed it while engaged in it ; but now he professed to have had enough of it. His love for his wife increased day by day. Every wish of his heart was devoted to her ; every thought of his mind was directed to the furtherance of her happiness and well-being, and he more than once found himself longing for the time when his sister's recovery should be so far advanced, as to admit of her leaving London for Oakfield Chase, where Lord Isle worth was anxiously expecting her arrival with her husband and son. Between his official duties on one hand, and the monopoly which Maud had established on the other, his intercourse with his wife was of a very limited nature. Since Maud's confinement they had never passed one evening in their own house, at which violation of his rights and privileges, F 2"], [108, "100 THE CAEYLLS. Walter began to show great impatience, and on the first occasion of Lady Brentford's dining downstairs he signified his intention of putting an end to it. Her ladyship remon strated, but in vain. \" You might leave her with me for another week, till I go to Oakfield,\" she said. \" But men are so selfish ; they think of nothing but their own comfort.\" \" Well done, Maud ! What have you been thinking of all this time ? But the long and the short of it is I mean to resume my wife. You have enjoyed the charms of her society quite long enough ; it is my turn now. To morrow is Sunday, and I shall keep her all to myself. You will see neither of us till Monday.\" \" Then all I can say is that you are very ill-natured. And baby is so fond of her, I am sure he will pine for her.\" \" Then he will just do what I have been doing for the last month.

And when next you come to town I shall lock her up in a glass case, and keep her there as long as you remain. But come, I will make you some compensation ; I mean to give you Ph\u0153bus, the best lady's horse in England.\" \" My dear Walter,\" said Lord Brentford, \" I cannot allow Maud to accept him. If you mean to part with him, I shall only be too glad to buy him. But why do you not keep him for Annie ?\" \" For the simple reason that I cannot afford to keep two horses, and I do not sup pose you would have Annie gallop up and down Rotten Row by herself. If I had had my wits about me I should have parted with him two months ago, for I have never so much as crossed him since Mrs. Caryll did me the honour to take me for better and worse, and all this time he has been eating his head off at a livery-stable.

Am I not right, Annie ?\" Lord Brentford had insisted on presenting the Carylls with the furniture they required for their new house, as his wedding gift, while the pianoforte came from his wife."], [111, "THE CARYLLS. 103 \" I cannot believe,\" said Annie, in answer to the appeal just made to her, \" that either Lord Brentford or your sister will drive you to such extremities, when they know how much you have set your heart on obtaining so good a mistress for Ph\u0153bus.

She had written to him at great length soon after her arrival in Scotland, which letter he had answered, but since then, to him she had given no sign of life. She had heard of his marriage through Lord Brentford, and that she should not have sent him one line of con gratulation seemed extraordinary, to say the least of it, after the intimacy in which they had lived. W alter felt hurt by her conduct, so different from what he thought he had a right to expect, but on the last night of the Brentfords stay in London, Maud put a letter into his hands from the offender, which had been sent under cover to her, as Beatrice did not know his London address, and would not send it to the Foreign Office, alleging as a reason that, no doubt, a parcel of idle clerks, who had nothing to do, amused themselves in opening and reading each other's letters. \" Mind you make him show it you, Annie,\""], [113, "THE CARYLLS. 105 said Lady Brentford ; \" it comes from an old flirt of his.\" \" Poor Bee !\" exclaimed Lord Brentford ; \" this is the first time I ever heard her called a flirt. Such an accusation could only come from a bosom friend.\" \" Well, then, an old friend of Walter's. I am sure you will like her, as we all do. She is the most single-minded, open-hearted girl I know ; all the men are in love with her, Brentford at their head, but she will have no thing to say to any of them. Now, Walter, what does she say ?\" \" I will read it out if you like ; it is dated from May Bank.\" \"My Dear Walter, \" Of course you are surprised at not having heard from me, but I never do write letters of congratulation to any one till I know what I have to congratulate them upon ; but I have heard such charming ac counts of your wife, and the happiness you enjoy together, that I can refrain no longer f 5"], [114, "106 THE CARYLLS. from adding my good wishes to those of your other friends. From all I hear of Mrs. Caryll, I am longing to make her acquaint ance, and I hope she will keep a small corner of her heart vacant for the friendship which I foresee we are destined to feel for each other. Why did you not select May Bank for your honeymoon ? At all events, I hope you will bring your wife to pay me a visit before long. I have nobody but Brownie with me, and am not likely to have, so you can run down any day you like without giving me previous no tice of your intention. With kindest regards to my unknown future friend, \" Believe me, \" Y\"ours affectionately, \"B. L.\" \" P.S. \u2014 Brownie has been composing a litany of congratulations for vou and Mrs. Caryll, much too long to write down.

Shall we run down for a day next Saturday, and return on Monday ? I should like you to know her.\" \" I think I had rather wait a little longer,\" Mrs. Caryll replied. \" It is very early for me to pay visits to persons who are not members of your family.\" \" True, my love, I forgot ; although we all look upon Beatrice as one of ourselves, I cannot expect you to do so. I will write to tell her that we will take May Bank on our way to the Holt, in December.\" \" And tell her,\" said Annie, \" that I thank her for her expressions of good-will towards myself, which I shall do my best to deserve.\" Accordingly, Walter wrote to postpone their visit, and at the same time he thought it advisable to warn Miss Leycester that he had allowed his wife to suppose that it was one of his sisters whom she had seen with him in the Hansom. \" It was some time be fore our marriage,\" he said, \" and I thought,"], [116, "108 THE CARYLLS. perhaps, you would not like her to know that you had been driving about with me alone at night. So pray do not show me up.\" Miss Leycester accepted the proposed visit, and said it would suit her perfectly. She was going to Oakfield about that time, and would put herself under the protection of Mrs. Caryll for the journey."], [117, "THE CARYLLS. 109 CHAPTER VI. The Brentfords departed, and the Shorehams returned ; but this last circumstance did not interfere much with the routine of Annie's daily life. Lucy had too much to do at home to find time for long excursions, and her sister in-law had no carriage at her disposal. It was an understood thing that the Carylls were to dine at Kensington every Sunday, and occasionally the Shorehams returned the compliment at St. John's Wood ; and to this their intercourse was limited, although, perhaps, Annie felt more at home with Lucy Shoreham's staid composure of manner than she did with the impetuosity of Maud. Both Walter and his wife were delighted with this domestic tranquillity. The days were shortening apace, but the weather re mained fine, and every hour of day-light of which they could dispose was devoted to the"], [118, "110 THE CARYLLS garden, which, thanks to their united labours, soon began to assume a very creditable appearance as far as neatness and order were concerned. While Walter was at his office, Annie found plenty of occupation indoors, for few had greater resources within themselves. Reading, drawing, and music filled up the vacant hours till her husband's return, which was always looked for with impatience, as the great event of the day ; and the evening was passed without a wish for any society but their own. To Annie this peaceful life was beneficial in every way ; a healthier colour glowed upon her cheek, her eyes shone with a brighter lustre, and even her voice seemed. to have acquired a gentler tone. She looked and spoke more like the Annie of other days. As for Walter, his large heart brimful of happiness and gratitude, he felt as if he had nothing more to desire upon earth. The beings he most loved \u2014 wife, father, brother, sisters, friends \u2014 all seemed to vie with each \u25a0other in returning his affection, and making his paths paths of pleasantness, down to the young gentleman who had so lately made his"], [119, "111 THE CARYLLS. appearance in Portman Square. A day or two after the Brentfords had left London, a hogshead of claret arrived at Antwerp Villa, with the Honourable Edward Oakley's com pliments and love to uncle Walter. While the Carylls still remained in London, letters were received from Major Caryll and Lady Mary, announcing their safe arrival at the head-quarters of their regiment, and giv ing a most satisfactory account of their travels by sea and land. They appeared to be in a humour to be pleased with everything. They were delighted with all they had seen, they were delighted with their reception, they were delighted with the bungalow they had secured, and they looked forward without dismay to the two or three years during which their exile would be prolonged ; passages which i horeham interpreted as meaning that they were still very much in love with each other, and disposed to see everything couleur de rose. No doubt he was right. At length, Walter announced that the time had arrived for their pilgrimage to the Holt, taking May Bank in their way. In considera-"], [120, "112 THE CARYLLS. tion of his having only asked for one week's leave of absence on so important an occasion as his marriage, he had now obtaiued a vaca tion of two months, to which he looked for ward with all the eagerness and impatience of a schoolboy. Of his father he spoke in the highest terms of affection and veneration, but the favourite topic of conversation was the merits and charms of Beatrice Leycester, on which he enlarged so frequently, and at such length, that his wife began to be a little weary of the subject. Annie herself looked upon their projected excursion with very different eyes from her husband. In their present abode she had passed the happiest, certainly the most tran quil, hours which had fallen to her lot since the days of her childhood, and she dreaded leaving it. What the present was she knew and clung to ; what the future might have in store for her was painfully uncertain. One most unpleasant scene, her first meeting with Mr. Leycester, she knew awaited her, and how many others might follow ! Sir Edward Caryll, and every member of his family she"], [121, "113 THE CARYLLS. was prepared to love, for from all with whom she was as yet acquainted she had met nothing but kindness ; but she was not so sure about Beatrice Leycester. The very name she bore, and still more her near relationship to Mr. Leycester were against her, nor, in this in- stance, did she consider the extreme partiality with which her husband always spoke of her as any extraordinary recommendation in her favour. Of Beatrice's sayings and doings, and other peculiarities she had, naturally, heard a great deal from Lady Brentford, quite enough to convince her that there was very little analogy between their two dispositions. In short, May Bank was rather a thorn in her side, and she anticipated but little pleasure or satisfaction from her visit there, which she would have avoided if she could ; but this was out of the question, without assigning some reason for it, and reasons, properly so called, she had none to give. Whatever evils or annoyances, therefore, to which she might be exposed in the course of the next two months, were apparently unavoidable ; but she had a brave little heart beating within her breast,"], [122, "114 THE CARYLLS. and she armed herself to meet her troubles as best she might. She even assisted in making all the arrangements for their journey with a cheerfulness and alacrity which convinced Walter that she expected to derive as much gratification from it as he did himself; and in the pleasure of pleasing her husband she found herself rewarded for the sacrifice she was making of her own wishes. At May Bank she was most agreeably sur prised by finding everything on a totally different footing from what she had imagined. She had, perhaps, been a little afraid of Miss Leycester, thinking it not improbable that she might be made the object of that young lady's ridicule, possibly of her contempt ; but in this she was speedily undeceived. Beatrice's reception of her was so warm and friendly that it was impossible to doubt her sincerity and the kindly motives by which she was actuated ; as soon as the initiatory operation of kissing was over, Beatrice followed it up by saying \u2014 \" Now, my dear Mrs. Caryll, we have made acquaintance, but I warn you that I shall not"], [123, "115 THE CARYLLS. be contented with that. I feel so much real friendship for Walter that I should be miser able if I could not obtain that of his wife.\" \" You will not find that a very difficult matter, Beatrice,\" said Walter ; \" I have given you the very best of characters, and I think you and Annie just suited to each other. Honest and true both of you.\" Mrs. Caryll endeavoured to find some ap propriate answer, but she sought in vain ; the words would not come at her bidding; and feeling that she ought to say something, her embarrassment increased. At length she murmured out that she well knew the regard which her husband entertained for Miss Ley cester, and had long been looking forward to the pleasure of making her acquaintance. Beatrice's warm-hearted greeting deserved something better, but she attributed Annie's cold and measured words to shyness, which she endeavoured to remove. \" But what an inhospitable brute I am,\" she said in her usual energetic phraseology, \" to keep you standing in the hall all this time. Do let me show you to your own room."], [124, "116 THE CARYLLS. I call it my state apartment, but you must not expect anything very magnificent, for, not reckoning those we occupy ourselves, it is the only one, except two or three bache lors' rooms.\" The two ladies ascended the stairs together, and Miss Leycester threw open a door. \" Here it is. Oh, I see your maid has found out the way to it. Now, Annie \u2014 will you allow me to call you so ? \u2014 take off your things, make yourself comfortable, and then come down stairs and have some tea, for dinner is a long way off. Or perhaps you are tired, and would like it better up here.\" \" No, no,\" Annie replied, taking her hand, \" I shall greatly prefer coming down. But before you go let me thank you for the kind message you sent me in your letter to Walter, which has been more than confirmed by the welcome you have given me here.\" \" Selfishness, selfishness, Annie ; I am try ing to gain a new friend. And now take off your bonnet, and come down as soon as you can. I want to introduce Brownie to you, who is dying to see you.\""], [125, "117 THE CARYLLS. Very few minutes elapsed before Mrs. Ca ryll made her appearance in the drawing room, and the introduction to Miss Browne, who had put on a company face for the occa sion, was effected. \" You must not be jealous, Annie,\" said Beatrice, \" but I will tell you, in the strictest confidence, that Brownie, once upon a time, was in love with your husband herself.\" \" My dear Beatrice,\" said the person ac cused, blushing as if she had been fifteen instead of fifty, \" what will Mrs. Caryll think of you ?\" \" Think of me ! I hope she will look upon me as a true friend, anxious to put her on her guard against an insidious and dangerous rival; what she will think of you is more to the purpose.\" \" Mrs. Caryll, may I give you another cup of tea ?\" said Miss Browne, rather distressed by this attack before a stranger. \" Why it never came to anything I cannot make out,\" continued Aliss Leycester ; \" for Walter's heart was certainly a little touched, and Brownie once went the length of confes-"], [126, "118 THE CARYLLS. sing to me that she thought Mr. Caryll one of the most well-bred and agreeable young men she knew.\" \" I am sure I am much obliged to Miss Browne for her good opinion of me,\" said Walter, \" but beyond that I am afraid I can lay claim to no interest in her heart. As regards my admiration of her good qualities, I freely acknowledge it, not only once upon a time, but now.\" \" Ah well,\" rejoined Beatrice, \" that is all very fine talking, but if I have succeeded in opening your wife's eyes, I am satisfied.\" \" You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Beatrice, for attempting to sow the seeds of dissension between husband and wife.\" Miss Leycester made no further attempt to defend herself, and the conversation turned to other subjects; the journey they were to take together, and the friends they were to meet. \" I hope you like the Brentfords,\" said Miss Leycester. \" There is not one of Walter's family with whom I have become acquainted that I do"], [127, "THE CARYLLS. 119 not like,\" was Mrs. Caryll's reply ; \" not one to whom I do not owe a deep debt of grati tude for the manner in which they have ac cepted me as a relation. I feel it the more, perhaps, from having none of my own.\" \" That is nearly my own case. I have no near relations, and we are both of us fortu nate in finding their places so well supplied. I really think the Oakleys and Carylls occupy a place by themselves in the human race ; all so different, and all so nearly perfect in their different ways. Of course, I except Walter, whom, no doubt, you have by this time dis covered to be an useless, good-for-nothing fellow, not worth his salt.\" \" Thank you, Miss Bee,\" said Walter. \"Don't come to me for a character when you next want a place.\" \" And there is another exception I must make, and this time with reason. But I need not warn you against him, as no doubt Walter has done so already, for I do not think he is much more partial to him than I am.\" \"No, indeed ; Walter has warned me against no one.''"], [128, "120 THE CARYLLS. \" Then I will. I allude to my cousin, John Leycester. He is a cold, heartless man of the world ; a man to be neither loved nor trusted.\" \" Beatrice, Beatrice !\" exclaimed Walter, \" please to remember he is my brother-in-law, and chough I do not particularly like him, I hope for Louisa's sake always to be on good terms with him. But Annie knows him quite as well as we do. He was for some time at her father's.\" \" True, so he was ; I quite forgot that How did you like him, Annie ?'' This was one of the trials she had foreseen, and for which she had prepared herself, but now it came upon her unawares, and made her colour painfully. Fortunately, no one remarked it, and before she was called upon to take a part in the conversation, she re covered her composure. She answered the appeal made to her without any apparent embarrassment. \" It is now some years,\" she said, \" since he left my father's, and more than two since I have seen him at all, so I cannot speak with"], [129, "121 THE CARYLLS. much certainty of what he is now. But when he was with us we liked him. His father was an old and intimate friend of my father's.\" \" Well,\" said Beatrice, \" you will soon have an opportunity of judging for yourself, but bear my warning in mind.\" \" I believe Louisa gets on very well with him,\" remarked Walter. \" I am glad of it, and sincerely hope it may last. But depend upon it, if he were to treat her with any amount of brutality, we should know nothing of it. Louisa is far too proud to appeal for assistance to any created being ; too proud even to acknowledge that her mar riage was a mistake.\" \" Do you see any likeness between Louisa and Annie ?\" \" Yes, it struck me at once. But Louisa has a more \u2014 what shall I call it ? \u2014 a more imperious look than your wife. But it is hardly fair to comment upon her in this way. Let us settle about our journey.

My father is impatient to have us at the Holt, and we think of leaving May Bank the day after to-morrow.\" \" That is quick work, indeed, and I must make my preparations at once ; that is to say if Mrs. Caryll will take me under her wing.'' \" I shall be most happy to be of any use to you I can,\" said Annie, not quite under standing what was required of her. She was at the other end of the room, making ac quaintance with Mrs. Howe under Miss Browne's auspices. \" You don't quite know what you are under taking, Annie,\" said Walter. \" You are to be responsible for Beatrice's good behaviour between May Bank and the Chase; rather a serious piece of business, I can tell you.\" \" I think I could undertake a more arduous task than that,\" Annie replied, with a smile. \" I promise to be on my best behaviour and do credit to my chaperon,\" said Beatrice."], [131, "123 THE CARYLLS. \" And, Annie, if you want to engage in a really arduous task, you will endeavour to cure Walter of his imperance, as the servants call it. But good gracious, there is the dressing bell. How we have been chattering away the last two hours !\" At May Bank time never hung heavy on hand. After tea they sat down to a sober game at whist, Miss Leycester declaring that they were not enough for vingt-et-un. \" Walter and Brownie shall play together, and Annie shall be my partner,\" she said. \" It is contrary to all rule for husband and wife to play together. If you do not object, Annie, we will play for penny points. I always like to play for something.\" \" Certainly,\" observed Walter ; \" it takes the sting out of the vice of card-playing. To play for nothing is an idle and sinful waste of time, but to play with the intention of inr creasing one's income and making a provision for one's old age is meritorious in the extreme. Is cheating allowed ?\" \" Of course not at whist.\" a 2"], [132, "124 THE CARYLLS. Of the four Walter was by far the worst player, and made mistakes which sorely dis- composed his partner. To her intense grati- fication and Miss Browne's dismay, Beatrice detected him in a flagrant case of revoke, and notwithstanding all his remonstrances and entreaties, insisted upon scoring three points When he rose from the table he found him self fourteen pence poorer than when he sat down to it. \" Now, Walter, you will pay me, and Brownie will pay Annie,\" said Beatrice. \" Husbands always try to cheat their wives c ut of their winnings.\" \"I have not got any money; Annie, lend me your fourteen pence.\" Mrs. Caryll was in the act of handing them over, when Beatrice again interposed. \" How can you be so weak, Annie ? It is only a dodge. I see you do not know men half as well as I do. He would never give it you back. Now, Walter, out of this room you don't go till you have paid me. It is not natural that you should not have your purse"], [133, "125 THE CARYLLS. about you, so just feel in your pockets again.\" Very slowly, and with great apparent re luctance, Walter drew out a purse tolerably well garnished, and presented Miss Leycester with the amount of her winnings. \" I was certain of it,\" exclaimed that young lady in a tone of triumph. \" Men are so de ceitful.\" \" It is the only defence of the oppressed against the oppressor. If Louisa is imperious I am sure you are despotic.\" \" It is the only way to deal with them, though,\" observed Beatrice, in a half aside to Mrs. Caryll, as she presented her with a bed room candle. \" Is she not charming ?\" said Walter to his wife, when they found themselves alone. \" Whatever ideas her brain may engender, and they are many and various, out they come; but I never yet heard her say any thing that could offend or annoy, and I never knew her refuse to bear her part in a good natured action.\" \" I like much what I have seen of her,\""], [134, "126 THE CARYLLS. replied Annie, \" and I have no doubt that the better 1 know her the more that feeling will increase.\" She spoke in perfect sincerity, for Beatrice had been gaining on her favour the whole evening, and yet, quite at the bottom of her heart, there lurked a little uneasy sensation, to which she could not, or would not, give a name. It was not jealousy \u2014 she was not of a jealous disposition \u2014 but she certainly did not quite approve of the extreme familiarity ex isting between her husband and their hostess, a familiarity which seemed greatly to exceed anything to which she herself had as yet at tained. Moreover, their frequent allusions to past scenes and events of which she knew nothing, and to persons with whom she was not acquainted, produced at times a feeling of isolation, which was not exactly agreeable. Still, she did full justice to all she had heard of Beatrice's amiable qualities, and all she saw of her pleasing manners. And it was very much to her credit that she did, for I find upon enquiry \u2014 of such things I know nothing myself \u2014 that it is generally consi-"], [135, "127 THE CARYLLS. dered to be rather easier to wash a blacka moor white, than for a new married wife to extend her cordiality to a young and pretty woman, who has been on habits of intimacy with her husband previous to their marriage. At breakfast on the following day Miss Leycester asked Annie if she was fond of riding, and if she was, offered to give her a mount. \" I used to be very fond of it,\" was the reply, \" though I never rode regularly, for I had no horse of my own, and now I have not even a habit.\" \" I am sorry for that, as I am afraid one of mine would not fit you. But you must posi tively get one, for we are all great riders at Oakfield, and as I am going to send both my horses there, there will always be one for >) you. \" Really I do not know how to thank you for all your kindness, but Maud has promised to lend me Ph\u0153bus whenever I have a mind to ride.\" \" Ph\u0153bus ! Why what has Maud to do with Ph\u0153bus ?\""], [136, "128 THE CARYLLS. \" Walter gave him to her just before she left London.\" \" What a shame ! Why did you not keep him for your wife, Walter ?\" \" For the best of all reasons,\" Caryll re plied. \" We could not afford it. As soon as that ship of mine arrives, freighted with silver and gold, which I have been expecting so long, you shall see what a stable I will keep.\" \" Now, Annie,\" said Beatrice, \" I have a great favour to ask, but before I tell you what it is you must promise to grant it.'' Mrs. Caryll looked at her husband. \" Promise,\" he said. \" If it is anything very objectionable, I can always interpose my conjugal authority and forbid its accomplish ment. Therefore, say on, Beatrice di Ley cester.\" \"It is that Annie will allow me to give her a riding-habit as a wedding present. Now, Walter, if you say a word, I will never forgive you.\" \" Indeed, you must not ask it,\" Annie began."], [137, "129 THE CARYLLS. \" What, not as a proof of friendship ; the first I have asked of you ! Brownie will tell you that, for the last month, I have been tormenting myself to invent something to offer you, and I determined to wait till I could find out what your tastes are, and what you would like. If after this you refuse me, I shall begin to think you have taken a dislike to me.\" \" No, no, indeed, you must not think that. I accept your offer most gratefully ; my only hesitation was whether I ought to take ad vantage of your good nature. Everybody is so kind to me, and I have so little to give in return.\" And the tears stood in her eyes as she said it. \" Give us your friendship, and we shall ask no more. As soon as we are settled, I will drive you over to X , where there is a really good tailor for this sort of thing.

As for you, master Walter, I owe 'you no thanks at all.

So if that does not suit you, say so.\" But Annie made no objection ; she thought 6he should like the walk back, and if she had been perfectly sincere, she would have said that it was the only part of the expedition to which she looked forward with unmitigated satisfaction. Having no experience of Miss Leycester's skill as a charioteer, it was not without some slight misgivings that she took her seat by her side. \" Now, Brownie,\" said Beatrice, before driving off, \" you and Walter are two such wild young things, that we ought to lock you up in separate rooms till our return, but for this once we will trust to your promise to be bien sages.\""], [140, "132 THE CAEYLLS. CHAPTER VII. Altogethee Mrs. Caryll was much pleased with her visit to May Bank. The sort of prejudice which she had felt against its owner, before she made her acquaintance, had completely vanished, and she even began to view with a more lenient eye the freedom of her intercourse with Walter. Everything about Beatrice Leycester was so thoroughly open and above-board, that it was impossible to suspect her of any sinister intentions, and if on the one hand she laughed, and talked, and jested with Walter to the top of her bent, on the other, there was nothing in all she said or did to which the most decorous could fairly take exception. She made no secret of the regard she felt for him, but this regard occasionally took the turn of scolding and rating him for his shortcomings with a sever ity which his wife, more than once, thought"], [141, "133 THE CAEYLLS. disproportioned to the offence. In short, Miss Leycester appeared to be a compound of truth, justice, strong affections, and high spirits, with a slight leaven of recklessness. In another respect also Annie was benefited by the new acquaintance she had formed. Walter's sisters had extended to her the right hand of good-fellowship and affection, but this, to some extent, might be owing to the connection existing between them ; naturally, they would wish to be on good terms with the wife of a brother they loved. But there were no such ties to influence Beatrice'sjudg ment. The liking she showed for Mrs. Caryll and the desire to cultivate her good will were evidently spontaneous, owing their birth to no suggestions of relationship. No doubt, under any circumstances, as Miss Ley cester's guest, she would have met with courtesy and civility ; but there was more than that. Beatrice was the last person in the world to give utterance to what she did not feel, and she had expressed an anxious hope that their acquaintance would soon ripen into firm and permanent friendship."], [142, "134 THE CAEYLLS. \" I felt predisposed to like Walter's wife,\" she had said, during their tete-a-tete drive to the station, \" and now I like you for your self. Dear Annie, I hope we shall be friends.\" Annie's diffidence melted away beneath Beatrice's warmth of manner, and she re sponded cordially to her companion's auspi cious words. It did her good to feel that she might be loved for herself alone. Annie left May Bank with very different feelings from what she had originally antici pated. She felt as if she were leaving a friendly port on a fresh voyage of discovery, in which there was at least one shoal lying directly in her track. As she was stepping into the fly which was to convey them to the station, Miss Browne thrust into her hand a paper parcel, which on inspection proved to be a scarf, embroidered by that good-natured lady herself. \" I have always maintained,\" said Beatrice, rather to the astonishment of her companions, \" that bashfulness is a downright vice. Here have I been trying to persuade Brownie to"], [143, "135 THE CAEYLLS. give you that scarf when you might have been able to pack it up comfortably. But no ; she was too shy, she could never venture, etc., etc. So now you will have the pleasure of carrying it in your hand all the way, or making Walter stuff it into one of his great coat pockets, at the risk of crumpling it. Thank goodness nobody can accuse me of bashfulness.\" To which observation Mr. Walter replied, \" I do not think they can, Bee.\" The journey was performed without let or hindrance. At the station nearest to Oak field, Miss Leycester left her companions. The Brentfords were waiting to receive her, but they had barely time to wave their hands to the Carylls, who had another ten minutes' penance to undergo before they arrived at their destination. There they found Miss Caryll with the car riage in attendance. The two sisters-in-law had hardly time to make acquaintance, and take that rapid survey of each other, by which women note at a glance, not only the features of their neighbours, but every article of their"], [144, "136 THE CAEYLLS. apparel, from the bonnet on the head to the shoes and stockings on the feet, when they found themselves at the Holt. The door was open, and Sir Edward standing on the steps, watching their approach. When the carriage stopped, he assisted Annie to alight, took her in his arms, and, kissing her, wel comed her as his dear daughter. In her agitation, which had been increasing with every step, she burst into tears, and tried to kiss his hand. \" My dear child,\" he said, \" you are tired with your journey. Caroline, take your sister to her own room, and try to persuade her to lie down a little before dinner.\" Miss Caryll complied, first ordering some tea to be sent up to them. As soon as she saw Annie comfortably established on the sofa, she said \u2014 \" Now tell me honestly, had you rather be alone, or shall I stay?\" \" I think,\" Annie replied, \" if I could re main quite quiet for a short time, it would do me good, for my head aches terribly. How long is it to dinner ?\""], [145, "137 THE CAEYLLS. Miss Caryll looked at her watch. \" About an hour ; but pray do not think it necessary to make any alteration in your dress, for we are quite alone. Papa said that on the evening of your arrival he was deter mined to have you to himself. The Ley cesters dine here to-morrow, and on the fol lowing day we are all to dine at Lord Isle worth's.\" A sigh of relief escaped from Mrs. Caryll's breast, and at that moment her husband en tered the room. \" How are you feeling now, Annie ?\" he asked. \" She has a bad head-ache, and wishes to be alone,\" Miss Caryll replied. \" So come down stairs, and tell me all you have been doing.\" A knock came at the door, and Sir Edward made his appearance. The same question and answer were repeated ; but Annie, whose head was already considerably better, asked them to remain. \" I will not speak myself,\" she said ; \" but I shall like to hear you talk.\""], [146, "138 THE CAEYLLS. They seated themselves round the sofa on which she was lying, and began, in a low tone of voice, adapted to a sick room, a long conversation, principally on domestic matters, and the various changes which had occurred in the neighbourhood. By degrees, Annie took an interest in all she heard. She was a Caryll now, and everything that concerned them, concerned her. Occasionally a smile flitted across her face, and once or twice she ventured to ask a question. A bell was now heard. \" There is our summons to dinner,\" said Sir Edward. \" Annie, do you feel well enough to join us ?\" \" Quite. Indeed, my head is quite well, and I have nothing the matter with me now. I think it must have been the railway that gave me a head-ache.\" \" Ah ! my dear, likely enough. They are sad innovations.\" That night Mrs. Caryll confided to her hus band that the more she saw of his family the more she liked them. \" Myself included, of course,\" he replied."], [147, "THE CAEYLLS. 139 \" Hum ! I don't know about that ; I must wait to hear more of you from Miss Leycester.\" \" Call her Beatrice, dearest, as we all do ; she will like it. And abuse me as much as you please ; it does me good to hear you gay and saucy.\" \" I do not know why, but I feel happier to night than I have done for many a day. I think it is the kindness of your dear father; I feel I shall love him well.\" \" He deserves it. You cannot love him too well. His whole thought is for the happiness of his children, and you are his child now.\" \" And I owe it all to you. My dear hus band, morning and night I pray to God that I may make you a good wife ; that you may never have cause to repent your choice.\" \" Your poor mother, Annie, assured me that I never should ; and I believe her.\" The next morning brought the Brentfords and Miss Leycester to the Holt. They were on horseback, and Beatrice was riding Ph\u0153bus, according to her the most perfect lady's horse that had ever been seen or heard of. Lord"], [148, "THE CARYLLS. 140 Brentford had broken him in himself for the side-saddle, and he did his lordship's talents, as a rough-rider, the greatest credit. They did not remain long, the principal object of their visit being to fix an hour on the following day for Miss Leycester to drive Annie over to X \" So mind you are ready,\" was the young lady's parting injunction ; \" and when you have got your habit, I shall send one of my own horses here to be at your entire disposal, and Brentford will send one of his for Walter; I daresay Sir Edward will give them stable room ; and, as you are out of practice, my horse will suit you better than Ph\u0153bus, who is a little playful at times. Good-bye, Sir Edward ; I am exceedingly affronted at your not having taken more notice of me. And do not let Annie steal your heart, for I look upon that as my own peculiar property.\" And with these words she whisked out of the room, and in another minute was seated in her saddle. \" What a merry, light-hearted young lady she is! \u00bb said Sir Edward, when the door had"], [149, "THE CARYLLS. 141 closed upon her. \"I always feel younger when I am in her company, but how I was to take more notice of her than I did, when she did all the talking herself, I do not see.\" Annie's great trial still remained, but she found herself so firmly seated in the good graces of her husband's family, that she looked forward to it with less perturbation. It came at last, That she might show no outward signs of reluctance or dread at a meeting which was inevitable, she went down to the drawing-room before any one else, after having taken, from some inexplicable motive, more than usual pains with her personal appearance. Notwithstanding the deep mourning in which she was still habited, she never looked to greater advantage. The last two or three months of tranquillity had restored freshness to her complexion and lustre to her eye, while the excitement of the moment lent a colour to her cheeks in which they were usually deficient. As the carriage of the Leycesters drove up, to her great relief Miss Caryll and Walter made their appearance."], [150, "142 THE CARYLLS. \" You know Mr. Leycester, do you not, Annie ? \" asked her sister-in-law. Before she could answer, the door opened. Louisa was the first in the room ; she came straight up to Annie and kissed her. \" I need not introduce Mr. Leycester, \" she said, \" he is an old friend.\" \" I am most happy to have this opportunity of renewing my acquaintance with Mrs. Caryll,\" said that gentleman himself, coming up and offering her his hand, which she coldly accepted. \" I hope you mean to make a long stay with us, now you are here.\" \" As long as Walter's leave lasts,\" she replied, without any embarrassment, \" except a week which we have promised to pass at Oakfield Chase.\" \" I hope you will be able to give us a few days at Tuftons,\" he rejoined, and then passed on to speak to Sir Edward. It was over, and she was astonished to find with how slight an effort she had maintained her composure. Was it possible she could ever have loved him? She glanced from him to her husband, and involuntarily drew"], [151, "THE CARYLLS. 143 a comparison between the two. They were both good-looking, both with the air of thorough-bred gentlemen ; but there the resemblance ceased. Walter was fair, tall, and powerfully made ; Leycester was a few years older, very dark, about the middle-size, and rather slight in figure. But the greatest difference between the two lay in their ex pression. The hard, obdurate look which habitually settled on Leycester's well-cut features, the sarcastic smile, almost amounting to a sneer, into which he occasionally relaxed, contrasted unfavourably with the open manli ness of his brother-in-law's countenance and the catching heartiness of his laugh. The advantage was all on her husband's side, and Annie could not refrain from a sigh, when she recollected her own infatuation, and the time when she had thought Leycester the most perfect of created beings. How could she ever have allowed herself to be the dupe of his honied words ! Her meditations were cut short by the an nouncement of dinner. Sir Edward offered her his arm, and placed her next to him. Mr."], [152, "144 THE CARYLLS. Leycester was seated on the other side of her, but he did not address much of his conversa tion to her. He was apparently occupied in discussing with Miss Caryll the merits of some particular race of fowls, which he had lately imported into Tuftons, and which were supposed to give more and better eggs than fowls had ever done before. Still Annie fancied that, when he could do so without attracting attention, he looked at her, or rather examined her with the closest scrutiny. As they were sitting side by side, of this she could not be quite sure, but the suspicion sent the blood to her neck and face more than once. She would far rather have had him opposite to her, and faced him boldly, instead of undergoing this sort of clandestine in vestigation. When the sisters retired after dinner to the drawing-room, Miss Caryll unlocked a com mode, and took from it a watch and chain, which she put into Louisa's hands. \" My dear Annie,\" said the latter, \" I am afraid you will think it a little late in the day to offer you wedding-presents, still I hope you"], [153, "145 THE CAEYLLS. will accept this from us. The watch is my gift, the chain Caroline's. You would have had them long ago, when I was in London, but the tiresome man could not get your cipher engraved in time, and as we wished to give them ourselves, we determined to wait till you came here. I hope you will say better late than never.\" \" I can only say that I do not know how to thank you all for the unvarying kindness I receive from every quarter. But, believe me, if I cannot speak my gratitude, I feel it deeply. I think both watch and chain beautiful ; and I was wanting one, for my old one never goes.'' \"How lucky we were in just hitting upon what you wished for.\" \" I am really overwhelmed with presents,'' Annie continued ; \" and all useful ones. Even Miss Leycester insisted upon giving me a riding-habit, and dear, good Miss Browne worked me a scarf.\" \" My dear Annie,\" said Miss Caryll, \" papa would tell you that there is far more pleasure in giving than receiving.\" VOL. in. 11"], [154, "146 THE CARYLLS. And of this dogma Sir Edward very shortly gave a practical illustration. When the gentlemen left the dining-room, he told Annie that he wished to speak to her, and led the way to his study. \" This is my den,\" he said ; \"how do you like it?\" It was a moderate sized room with a large bay-window, fitted up with book-cases which were well filled, a sofa, and an easy arm-chair or two, a curiously carved antique writing table, and a couple of gigantic chests of medi\u00e6val workmanship. In the window, on a pedestal stood a lay figure in a magnificent suit of chain-armour; a cheerful fire was blazing in the grate, and altogether the room looked the picture of comfort. Annie gazed about her for a minute. \" I like it so well,\" she replied, * that I almost wonder you have the courage to leave it. What is the history of that suit of armour ?\" \" Eight hundred years ago it covered as brave and noble a heart as ever beat within the breast of man. It belonged to the founder"], [155, "147 THE CARYLLS. of our race, Walter de Caryll. At the Con quest he obtained immense possessions, amongst the rest, the Holt. But he was any thing but a brutal tyrant, like so many of his companions. The Saxon heiress of the Holt was a mere child \u2014 her father and brothers had fallen at Hastings \u2014 and his heart warmed to the unhappy orphan, who flung herself on her knees before him, and implored his com passion, as he rode into the court of what had so lately been her home. By his care she was tenderly nurtured and carefully educated and in due time he married her. From them we descend in the direct male line. I am afraid that at the time of his Saxon marriage he had another wife living in Normandy, but that was a trifle in those days, and Caroline says it is a base calumny. If you want any more particulars about them you mustapply to her ; she is the genealogist of the family.\" \" I shall certainly ask her all about them. There is nothing I am so fond of as old family traditions.\" \" And she will be delighted to have a h 2"], [156, "148 THE CARYLLS. hearer,\" said Sir Edward. \" And now let U3 turn to what more immediately concerns our selves. All my daughters receive from me sixty pounds a year, except Maud and Lady Mary, who decline it, and my new daughter must let me do the same for her.\" \" Oh, Sir Edward, I assure you it is not the least necessary. Walter gives me every thing I ask for; he is only too generous.\" \" Yes, my dear, I have no doubt of Walter's generosity, but it is not pleasant for a woman to be obliged to ask her husband for money every time she wants a pair of gloves. And if you wish to make him a present yourself, it would be rather awkward to say to him, ' I want to give you a pin ; give me a couple of sovereigns to pay for it.' \" This was a sort of embarrassment Annie had already experienced, and she was quite ready to acknowledge the validity of Sir Edward's arguments. Still she hesitated ; she knew that her father-in-law was not rich, though she could not very well assign that as a reason for her reluctance to profit by his kindness. She was quite aware that in most"], [157, "THE CARYLLS. 149 families a portionless bride is looked upon as an unwelcome guest, but from him, no less than from his daughters, she had met with as cordial a reception as if she had been the greatest heiress in England, and she could not bear the idea of being a burthen on his restricted means. \" Well, Annie,\" said Sir Edward, after waiting a minute or two for an answer, \" you do not, I hope, mean to mortify me by a refusal.\" \" Oh no, you cannot think that. I was only in doubt whether I ought to take ad vantage of your liberality ; whether Walter would like it. Will you let me ask him ; but, whether I accept or not, my gratitude for your generous offer will be the same.\" \" My dear, if Walter's approbation is all you are waiting for, you may consent at once. He knows my intention, and had the good sense to offer no objection. But if, as I rather suspect, you think it will be inconve nient to me, set your mind at ease. You will inherit Maud's allowance, which she gave up at the time of her marriage. If I am not"], [158, "150 THE CARYLLS. rich, I always contrive to make the two ends meet, and I do not think that for the last ten years there has been a difference of fifty pounds in my yearly expenditure. So now let us consider that matter as settled.\" They returned to the drawing-room to gether, and not long after the Leycesters took their leave. When Miss Caryll wished her sister-in-law good night, she whispered to her, \" Dear Annie, I am so glad you allowed papa to do what he wished. I see you are destined to be a great favourite ; he says you show so much good feeling in all you do and say.\" Annie was naturally a little shy of men tioning Leycester's name, but when she was talking over the transactions of the evening with her husband, she could not refrain from remarking that it seemed odd that Mr. Ley cester should let his wife continue to receive an allowance from her father, when Lady Brentford had given up hers. \" Odd ! not at all,\" replied her husband. \" He fought hard for the interest of all her fortune, and was anything but pleased when"], [159, "THE CARYLLS. 151 he was told that during my father's life he must be contented with sixty pounds a-year, the same that Lucy receives. Shoreham, who was as poor as a church mouse when he married, was satisfied ; Leycester, with his ten thousand a-year, grumbled.\" Walter's holiday passed away only too quickly. What with riding and driving, dinners at the Holt and parties at Oakfield, with everyone apparently striving to make her existence as agreeable as possible to her, Annie found herself involved in a round of amusement, which sometimes filled her with something like remorse, when she recollected how short a time had elapsed since her mother's death. And yet it seemed unavoid- able. Oakfield was filled with guests, and the Carylls were expected to be there morn- ing, noon, and night. On being introduced to Lord Isleworth, he had said, \" I suppose you have been told that all Sir Edward's children are mine also by adoption, and as such I lay claim to you. You must learn to look upon the Chase as your home as much as the Holt.\" In this he was supported by"], [160, "152 THE CARYLLS. his children, and to reject advances thus made was impossible. Still, she endeavoured to draw a line. There was dancing almost every night, but in this she refused to join, though she was quite ready to play by the hour together for those who did. On twelfth night Lord Isleworth gave a regular ball, to which half the county was invited, and this night she passed at home alone ; for she insisted upon Walter's accom panying Sir Edward and Miss Caryll. She also declined all invitations, except those given by her husband's immediate con nections."], [161, "153 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER VIII. One visit Mrs. Caryll was obliged to pay, much against her will. Louisa Leycester made such a point of their going to Tuftons, if it were but for a couple of days, that she could not refuse without giving offence. Mr. Leycester had more than once endeavoured to engage her in a tete-a-tete conversation, but hitherto she had always contrived to baffle his attempts. In his own house this would be difficult, not to say impossible ; she must be prepared to listen to his explanations, and defence of conduct which was indefensible. For this she had not long to wait. On the day after their arrival at Tuftons Leycester and Walter, who was to ride a horse of Lord Brentford's, went to meet the hounds at some little distance, but in the course of a couple of hours Mr. Leycester returned without his h 5"], [162, "154 THE CARYLLS. companion. He found Mrs. Caryll alone and reading, Louisa having been called away to receive some neighbour. Annie's first im pression when she saw him enter alone was that some accident had befallen her husband. \"Where's Walter?\" she exclaimed. \" The last I saw of him, he was in the act of charging a brook. My horse flung a shoe, and there was nothing left for me but to return home.\" \" Thank God !\" she said, rising up as if she was about to leave the room. \" I thought that perhaps he had met with some accident, and was hurt.\" \" Stop, Annie,\" he cried. \" I have long wished for an opportunity of speaking to you. Y\"ou must not refuse to hear me.\" She resumed her seat. She was afraid of seeming afraid. \" Annie,\" he continued, \" I know what your thoughts of me must be, but believe me, I am not as guilty as you think me. You know that during my father's life my hands were tied, and when at last I had it in my power to make you mine, you vanished from Lynburn"], [163, "155 THE CARYLLS. without leaving a trace of your actual resi dence. Some time afterwards I made Louisa CarylPs acquaintance. I was attracted to her by a resemblance I fancied I saw between you and her. I thought you were lost to me for ever, and in a moment of madness I proposed to her. Forgive me, Annie ; we have both of us been the victims of some inqomprehensible fatality.\" His involved sentences and sesquipedalian words had not the gift of convincing his companion. '\" You seem to forget, Mr. Leycester,\" she replied, \" that after your father's death, when you were settled at Lynburn and your own master, you contented yourself with paying us a couple of formal visits. During the three months we remained in the vicarage after the loss of my poor father, you alone of all our acquaintance never once had the common civility to call upon us ; it is true, you sent a cold letter of condolence to my mother. As for our vanishing from Lynburn without leaving a trace, every one"], [164, "156 THE CARYLLS. knew for weeks beforehand that we were on the point of moving. Had you wished for our future address you had only to send and ask for it. If I say all this, it is not as a re proach, but that you may understand that the days of my credulity are gone by for ever. For the past I forgive you, on condition that you never allude to it again. I can afford to do so, for I, at all events, am no victim of an incomprehensible fatality ; I am only too blessed in the lot assigned to me by fate.\" \" I do not believe you, Annie. I know you too well to believe that you can have for gotten all the ties which bound us ; I do not believe that you can feel any real affection for the shallow blockhead who calls himself your husband.\" \" I shall certainly not undertake the defence of my husband's mental capacity,\" said Mrs. Caryll with dignity, the colour rising in her cheeks. \" All who know him, know that he is as full of talent and good sense as he is of good feeling. But, even were he what you say, I should greatly prefer for my husband a shal-"], [165, "157 THE CARYLLS. loRr blockhead with a kindly heart and gene rous nature, to a clever man of the world, destitute of both.\" She rose as she spoke, and approached the door, nor did Mr. Leycester make any effort to detain her. Mr. Leycester made no further attempts at private conversation with his guest, but the rebuff he had met with had not the effect of improving his temper. He was barely civil to the Carylls during the two days that re mained of their stay at Tuftons, and more than once he made allusions to the events of former days, intelligible to Annie alone, and which brought the colour to her cheeks. His wife did her best to repair his deficiencies, and, whether it was owing to her remonstrances, or to one of those sudden changes to which men of his disposition are liable, on the morning of their departure, he recovered all his cour tesy and good breeding. He shook them heartily by the hand, thanked them for the pleasure they had conferred on his wife and himself by their visit, regretted that it had been so short, and hoped that their next"], [166, "158 THE CARYLLS. one would be of longer duration. Their next meeting, he concluded, would be in London, and to that he looked forward with pleasure. Walter and Annie rode from Tuftons to the Holt, and Leycester made a point of accom panying them part of the way. When he left them to return home, Caryll observed to his wife\u2014 \" Leycester puzzles me ; I never can quite make out if he is sincere when he wishes to be civil. It is true, when he wishes to be obnoxious I never feel inclined to doubt his sincerity ; it speaks for itself.\" \" I suppose he is sincere at the time,\" she replied. \" Just so ; when the fit is on him. It is a pity it does not come oftener and last longer, for he can be amusing enough when he likes, and when he is sulky he is positively unbear able. Yesterday evening I was very near making a vow that I would never set foot in his house again ; his manner has been down right boorish for the last few days ; but this morning I have relaxed a little.\""], [167, "159 THE CARYLLS. \" You ought to put up with a good deal for your sister's sake.\" \" No doubt. Now let us have a good gal lop to shake off my ill-humour.\" At the end of the week Mr. and Mrs. Walter Caryll returned to London, and were replaced at the Holt by Mrs. Shoreham and her flock, who arrived on the day preceding her brother's departure. \" We are regular buckets in a well,\" re marked Walter ; \" the appearance of one is the signal for the disappearance of the other.\" \" Yes, it is very provoking; but Ned had the measles, and we could not manage to come earlier.\" The consequence was that when the Carylls arrived in London they found it, as regarded themselves, a solitude, and were left almost entirely to the enjoyment of their own society. This change was anything but displeasing to either of them. Walter was perfectly con tented to pass evening after evening, listen ing to his wife's music, and occupying himself with his drawing, to which he applied himself with a sort of passion, while Annie, having"], [168, "160 THE CARYLLS. successfully passed through the ordeals which had awaited her at the Holt, and being freed from the dread of seeing the past rise up in judgment against her, experienced a sense of security, and with it an increased feeling of happiness, which not many months before she would have despaired of ever attaining. Though necessarily alone for many hours of the day, her time never hung heavy on her hands, and she entered with interest into all her husband's castle-building and projects for the future, though perhaps with limited belief in the probability of their accomplishment. For Mr. Walter Caryll's views were ex panding; the Brentfords, or rather Lady Brentford, had raised in him ambitious hopes of future aggrandisement. During their autumn progress Maud had been frequently congratulated on her lord's successful debut, as a parliamentary speaker. According to her informants no man had ever made so deep an impression on an admiring auditory by a first effort ; there could not be a doubt that, whenever his party came into power, he would be called upon to fill some highly responsible"], [169, "161 THE CARYLLS. situation; younger men than he was had satin the Cabinet, and these complimentary effusions Maud took for current coin, and repeated to her husband, enriched by notes and comments of her own. It would be inexcusable, now that he had an established reputation for ability and business-like habits, if he did not exert himself to the utmost to maintain it. Again were the interests of his party and his country set before his eyes with all the elo quence of female enthusiasm, and Lord Brentford, groaning in spirit, saw himself condemned for the rest of his days to pur suits which, in his heart, he detested, and for which his good sense told him he was un fitted. \" And then, dear Brentford,\" she continued, \" you will be able to do something for Walter. You must bring him into parliament and make him Under Secretary of State. After all a Caryll, and your brother-in-law, is fit for something better than to be a mere clerk,\" which last words she enforced by a very aristocratic grimace, expressive of intense disgust at her brother's actual position."], [170, "162 THE CARYLLS. \" I had rather settle a thousand a year on him at once,\" replied his lordship, in a tone of misery. \" What can you mean, Brentford ? Walter would accept the one, and most certainly he would not accept the other. Do you doubt his being fit for such a place ?\" \" Certainly not,\" said her husband, hasten ing to explain away his words. \" I have not the slightest doubt that he is quite as fit to be an Under Secretary of State as I am to be a Cabinet Minister. What I meant was that I do not see any immediate prospect of my having such a post to offer him; the present people seem to be fixtures.\" \" That depends upon yourself. Mrs. A and Lady Mary B., and Lady C, and the Duchess of D., all say that if you choose to exert yourself the ministers cannot live through another session. Dear Brentford, promise me you will do your best. Only think what an advantage it will be to baby when he grows up to have his father holding a high official situation. You will be able to make him an ambassador, or anything you like.\""], [171, "163 THE CARYLLS. This was a clincher, an argument from which there was no appeal, and which Lord Brent ford did not attempt even to refute ; and, as silence implies consent, Maud lost no time in imparting the joyful intelligence to him whom it so nearly concerned. On the last day of Walter's stay at the Holt, she drove over there to take leave of him and Annie, and communicated to them her husband's pro mises in his favour. Although half inclined to treat the whole thing as a joke in the first instance, when Walter was alone and began to reflect more seriously on what he had heard, his sanguine temper suggested to him that more unlikely things had come to pass, and by degrees he looked upon his promised pre ferment as merely a question of time ; that it would take place sooner or later did not, in his mind, admit of a doubt. \" I wonder,\" one evening he said to bis wife, \" which of the secretaryships Brentford will take. Mind you try to find out when you write to Maud. I rather hope it will be the Foreign Office ; I should have everything to learn in the others. You might say some-"], [172, "164 THE CARYLLS. thing about my being more useful to him if I remain where I am, than if I am removed to another department.\" \" I shall be writing to her to-morrow, and, of course, will say whatever you wish ; but, my dear Walter, have you reflected that, very possibly, Lord Brentford may never have it in his power to offer you what you so confi dently look forward to ? In all probability it will be long before his party comes into power, and when they do, I do not suppose they will give him any very high situation at first. There are so many older and more experienced men, who have greater claims than he can possibly have.\" Walter could not but acknowledge that her observations were founded on reason. \" Well, I do not know,\" he said, \" Maud has great hopes, and she has better means of judging than we have. One comfort is that, if she is mistaken, I shall not be in a worse position than I am now.\" \" And if she is not mistaken, perhaps we shall not change for the better,\" replied Mrs. Caryll. \" I am so happy now, that I think I"], [173, "THE CARYLLS. 165 should dread any change, however advantage ous it might appear.\" \" Are you, indeed, so happy, my own love?\" said Walter, passing his arm round her, and drawing her towards him. \" Happier than I ever was before \u2014 happier than I supposed possible,\" she replied, letting her head fall upon his shoulder. For the time, no further allusion was made to Walter's ambitious dreams. Annie was satisfied with the warning she had given, and the effect produced by her last words, and allowed the subject to drop. Sir Henry Savage was almost the only per son by whom their solitude was invaded. He called one morning at the Foreign Office, in order, as he said, to see how Walter was get ting on, and also to ask him to take charge of a letter for Major Caryll. \" And, mind you take care of it,\" he said, \" for it is to announce my intended marriage.\" \" Indeed ! Allow me, in the first place, to wish you joy ; and, in the next, to ask the name of the lady.\" \" Ah ! that brings me to the second part of"], [174, "166 THE CARYLLS. my mission. The name of the lady is Miss Thornhill. Her father lives about ten miles from Lynburn, and she is an old friend of Mrs. Caryll's. I am come up to town to see about settlements and the other necessary preludes to matrimony, and she has charged me on my allegiance to inform your wife, in person, of our intentions. I even think that she went so far as to say that, if I did not succeed in making her friend's acquaintance, I need never expect to see her face again.\" \" Annie will be delighted to see you,\" re plied Walter, \" and stiU more so to hear of your marriage. She has more than once mentioned Fanny Thornhill with affection, when we have been talking over old times ; and, indeed, I myself may claim her as an acquaintance, for I remember dancing with her once or twice when I was at Lynburn, and have met her occasionally in London. I like much what I have seen of her, and can congratulate you very sincerely.\" \" Thanks ; and that disposes of another point which I was to find out, whether Miss Wood's husband was the Mr. Caryll she knew."], [175, "167 THE CARYLLS. When will it suit Mrs. Caryll to receive me?\" \" Come and dine with us to-morrow, if you have nothing else to do ; we live at the end of the world, but by means of charts and a compass you may discover us. You must not expect, however, to meet anybody, for Annie is still in deep mourning for her mother.\" \" So Fanny told me, and I feel all the more grateful to you for making an exception in my favour. And do not tell Mrs. Caryll of what is in contemplation ; I should like to be the first to announce it to her.\" \"Very well. I suppose I shall be con demned to the peine forte et dure for so hein ous an act of domestic treason, but on such an occasion you have a right to my obedience.\" When Walter reached home he told Annie, rather to her discomposure, that he had invited Sir Henry Savage to dine with them on the morrow. \" He is Edward's best and dearest friend, and, as he is alone in London on busi ness, I could not very well do otherwise. Mind you give him a good dinner.\" \" My dear Walter, I wish you had asked"], [176, "168 THE CARYLLS. him any other day. The new cook comes to-morrow, and I have not an idea whether she can even dress a mutton chop.\" It argued but little in favour of Annie's knowledge of the male sex to make such an observation. Naturally her husband treated it with the most supreme contempt. \" Oh, depend upon it, she will do very well. We do not want a magnificent banquet. Some soup and fish, patties and cutlets, with a leg of lamb, will do very well. Of course, a tart and custards, or something of that sort, in the second course, and perhaps a pheasant or partridge, if they are to be had.\" \" I hardly think you will get lamb at this time of year,\" observed Annie. \" Well, then, a turkey. I do not wish to tie you down to my bill of fare. I only named just one or two simple dishes which every cook can dress. Savage knows we live in a very small way, and to give him more would look like ostentation, which is a thing I hate.\" As it turned out, the cook was a very fair professor of culinary science, and as Annie devoted great part of her morning to personal"], [177, "THE CARYLLS. 169 superintendence in the kitchen, a dinner was set before their guest which that gentleman pronounced to be faultless, and which was even honoured by the approval of Mr. Walter Caryll's more fastidious taste. It was not till the servant had left the room that Sir Henry entered upon his communication. \" Ilately saw a friend of yours, Mrs. Caryll,'' he said ; \" Miss Thornhill. She begged me to give you her love, if I was so fortunate as to meet you.\" \" Fanny Thornhill ! Oh, do tell me all about her.\" \" She is quite well in body, and professes to be quite happy in mind. She is engaged to be married.\" \" To whom ? \" \" Guess.\" This was not quite fair on Sir Henry's part, and might have been productive of unpleasant consequences. Fortunately, Annie's reply was of a most satisfactory nature. \" I really cannot. Fanny had plenty of admirers, but I never heard her express a preference for one VOL. m. I"], [178, "170 THE CARYLLS. more than for another ; all I know is that he is a most fortunate man, be he who he may.\" \" 1 quite agree with you ; and allow me to claim your congratulations, for I am that fortunate individual.\" This explanation completely dissipated any little reserve there might have been hitherto in Annie's manner towards her visitor ; her friend's lover must be her friend also, and she poured out question upon question with out mercy, which Sir Henry answered to the best of his ability. \" And when is it to be ?\" asked Walter, who for the last hour had been unable to slip in a word. \" As soon as possible. The Thornhills will be in town next week, and I hope the week after to cast off my bachelor chrysalis. Fanny has an objection to being married in Lent; so we have not much time to lose. Of course, you and Mrs. Caryll will honour the ceremony and the breakfast afterwards with your presence.'' \" We shall be delighted,\" said Walter. \" That is to say,\" interposed his wife, \" I"], [179, "171 THE CARYLLS. shall certainly be present in the church, but I am afraid I must decline the breakfast.\" \" I hope not,\" Sir Henry replied ; \" but I shall leave it to Fanny to argue that point with you.\" When he was in the act of taking his de parture, Walter said to him \u2014 \" Now that you have contrived to find out the north-west passage, I hope you will re peat your visit. At present we never go out in the evening. Our dinner hour is half-past seven, and Annie will tell you that on any or every day you will be welcome.\" Mrs. Caryll warmly confirmed her hus band's words, and Savage said that he should not fail to profit by their hospitality. \" Well, what day will you say ?\" asked Walter. \" To-morrow, the day after, or when?\" \" I really cannot say, for my time is not my own. Those lawyers make appointments at the most unheard-of hours. But, if Mrs. Caryll will allow me, I will run up without notice, when I can, and take my chance.\" i 2"], [180, "172 THE CARYLLS. \" All right. Come when you like ; we shall always be glad to see you.\" He did manage it once or twice, and the more they saw of him, the more they liked him. Miss Thornhill, with her family, ar rived at the expected time; one of the first visits they made was to Antwerp Villa, and Mrs. Caryll succeeded in detaining her friend for the rest of the day. Sir Henry was en gaged to dine with the Thornhills, but Mrs. Thornhill undertook to let him know in what direction he must look for his bride. \" Take care of her, Annie,\" she said, on taking leave. \" You are the only person for whom I would sacrifice so many of the few remaining hours of her unmarried life.\" Once, too, Annie wras persuaded to accom pany her husband to a dinner at the Thorn hills, where she renewed her acquaintance with some of her old friends, all of whom ex pressed their pleasure at the meeting. It pleased her to find that she still retained the regard of those who had known her as a girl, and she was not sorry that her husband should"], [181, "173 THE CARYLLS. see that he had no cause to be ashamed of the wife he had chosen. The marriage of Sir Henry Savage and Miss Thornhill was celebrated with all be coming magnificence. Mrs. Caryll was pre sent at the religious ceremony, as she had promised, but she returned home immediately afterwards, leaving Walter to represent both of them at the breakfast which followed."], [182, "174 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER IX. The days of Annie's tranquillity were num bered. Grumbling and growling, Lord Brent ford came up, or rather was dragged up to town, accompanied by his wife and father, to attend his parliamentary duties. Mr. Ley cester had achieved his purpose of obtaining a seat in the House of Commons, and arrived in London with Louisa a few days after the Brentfords, nor was Mrs. Shoreham long behind them. With so many Carylls congre gated together, and with the mutual attach ment existing between them, few were the days on which some plan was not devised for bringing them together. But these parties were no longer of the same quiet character as they had been in the autumn. Lord Isle worth's principal motive for leaving Oakfield so early was to introduce his daughter-in-law to all his friends and connections, and give"], [183, "175 THE CARYLLS. her a fair start in society. He had not been very well pleased at finding how few ac- quaintance she had made, and how slow her progress had been during the last season ; and attributing it partly to his son's indolence and easiness of disposition, partly to her own want of knowledge of the world, he deter- mined to take the matter in hand himself He was proud of his daughter-in-law, and he wished others to admire her also. Under his auspices large dinner-parties were arranged, while once a week Lady Brentford received a few select friends, and the evening generally wound up with a dance, of which her lady- ship, who had not enjoyed many opportunities of indulging in that amusement previous to her marriage, was passionately fond. At length a ball on a larger scale was an- nounced. Upon this a solemn conclave was held to discuss the question, whether Mrs. Walter Caryll ought, or ought not, to honour it with her presence, which, as might have been ex pected, was decided in the affirmative, Annie's voice being the only one against it. Upwards"], [184, "176 THE CARYLLS. of six months had elapsed since her mother's death ; she had dined out constantly ; she had accepted all Maud's invitations to her smaller parties ; and lastly her husband wished it. She conquered her repugnance, and, like a good wife, submitted. Leycester also opened his house, as far as dinners went, but the guests consisted princi pally of his political allies. The Carylls went occasionally, but less for any particular pleasure they derived themselves, than for Louisa's sake, for, generally speaking, Annie was the only other woman present. Leycester was a violent partisan of the existing govern ment, and the Brentford politics being dia metrically opposite, they never formed part of assemblies in which the conversation rolled almost exclusively upon political subjects. In these Louisa, unlike her sister Maud, took but little interest, and she was too glad to find a congenial companion, with whom she could discourse upon other topics, without the fatigue of exerting herself. For Mrs. Ley cester was no longer what she had been a year before. Without being actually ill, she felt"], [185, "177 THE CARYLLS. weak and languid, just at the time when health and strength were of the greatest im portance, for in another two months she was expecting her confinement. She saw her sisters frequently in the morning, but she found Maud's high spirits and enthusiastic way of expressing herself on all occasions rather overpowering, while the effort to amuse the nephews and nieces, by whom Lucy was always accompanied, generally exhausted her strength, and perhaps her patience. Under these circumstance her sister-in-law's tact and quiet manners were invaluable. Leycester himself encouraged the intimacy by every means in his power. He was but little at home himself, seldom seeing his wife before dinner, and he was delighted to find so able a substitute. His manners towards the Carylls had greatly improved ; he treated Walter with cordiality, and Annie with de ference and respect. He did not, indeed, always refrain from covert allusions to their past relations, intelligible to herself alone, but though they excited her displeasure, there i 5"], [186, "178 THE CARYLLS. was nothing in them of which she could take notice, as they were always couched in lan guage which might bear another interpreta tion. Louisa Leycester was not a person to say, as Lady Brentford had done on a similar occasion, \" You must not leave me ; I cannot do without you ;\" but she let Annie clearly see how agreeable her society was to her, and how grateful she felt for the many hours her sister-in-law devoted to her. Once or twice, when more than usually depressed, she laid aside much of her reserve, and spoke openly of what the future might have in store for her. \" Dear Annie,\" she said once, \" if things go wrong with me, you will not desert my child ? It will want some one to take a mother's place.\" \" Why give way to such thoughts as those ? There is no reason why you should not see your child's children.\" \" No, there is no reason. Still, it is as well to be prepared ; and if I thought I could leave my child to the care of one so good, so"], [187, "179 THE CARYLLS. gentle, it would deprive death of much of its terror. Will you promise me this?\" \" My dear Louisa, if this great affliction were to befall us all, I would do all in my power to fulfil your wishes, but you forget it will still have a father.\" \" What can a man do for a baby ? If it should be a son, I have no doubt Mr. Ley cester would do his best for its welfare, but I do not think he would pay much attention to it if it were a girl. It would be turned over to the care of servants ; besides, in all proba bility, he will marry again.\" \" But, no doubt,\" said Annie, \" he would object to my interference.\" \" On that point you may set your mind at ease. I have mentioned my wishes to him, and, though he laughed at my fears, he gave me leave to speak to you on the subject. He said that, of course, he could not give up the guardianship of his own child, but that he should be most happy to have you as a coad jutor. I think you are rather a favourite of his, Annie.\" The prospect of a partnership with Mr."], [188, "180 THE CARYLLS. Leycester, entailing, as it necessarily must do, frequent and confidential intercourse with him, had no great charms for Mrs. Caryll. She hesitated for a moment, weighing all the inconveniences of which such an arrangement might be productive; but she reflected that, in all probability, her services would never be required, and, when she saw the anxiety depicted on Louisa's countenance while wait ing for her answer, she could no longer with hold her consent. \" My dear Louisa,\" she said, \" if the case to which you allude should ever arrive, of which I cannot bear to admit the possibility, much less the probability, depend upon my complying with your wishes to the best of my ability, subject, of course, to my hus band's approbation.\" \" Thanks, dearest Annie, thanks ; you have taken a great weight off my mind. I am sure Walter conferred a blessing on us all when he brought you into the family. He will not refuse to comply with such a request, made at such a time.\" Mr. Leycester also, two or three days later,"], [189, "181 THE CARYLLS. thought it necessary to ride up to St. John's Wood, to thank Mrs. Caryll for her acquies cence. It was the first time he had ever been within her house, and he was rather curious to see how her domestic economy was regulated. \" What a charming house you have,\" he said ; \" and everything about it in such good taste. It is easy to guess who had the ar rangement of it, for, with all his other merits, I do not suppose friend Walter understands much about furnishing, or giving a house an air of comfort.\" \" I do not think there is a single article of furniture which we did not choose together,\" Annie replied ; \" and Walter was indefatig able in seeing everything put in its proper place. There is no one with a better eye for such matters.\" \" Has he ? I should not have thought it. But about this absurd fancy of Mrs. Leyces ter's. I cannot think what has come over her lately. She seems to have lost all the high spirit and courage which in my eyes constituted her greatest charm. Now she"], [190, "182 THE CARYLLS. goes moping about the house, and takes no interest in anything ; it is enough to give one the blue devils only to look at her.\" \"You ought to make allowance for her situation. It is a very anxious trial which is awaiting her.\" \" Well, if it is, it is what millions of women go through half-a-dozen times in the course of their lives, without making a fuss about it. If they did, I suspect few men would be bold enough to marry. I confess I am sick of it.\" If he expected any compliments of condo lence on his unhappy fate, he was disappointed ; Mrs. Caryll remained silent, and he continued, \" But, however, I am none the less obliged to you for humouring her silly fancies, and if I have the misfortune to lose her, I need not say that there is no one in the world whom I would select rather than yourself to fill her place.\" This was one of those equivocal phrases in which he so greatly delighted, but, if his object was to embarrass Annie, as far as out ward appearance went, he did not succeed. She replied simply, \" No one can adequately fill the place of a mother to her child, but I"], [191, "183 THE CARYLLS. would do my best to alleviate such an irre parable loss.\" \" Under your care the loss would soon cease to be irreparable. Ah, Annie,\" he said, on rising to depart, \" why cannot I acquire your enviable powers of forgetfulness ! \" She just touched the hand held out to her, and with a feeling of relief saw the door close behind him, but this feeling was speedily followed by one of bitter humiliation. Easter came and went, and Mr. Walter Caryll proclaimed his intention of giving a house-warming. The particular occasion selected was the return of Sir Henry and Lady Savage from their rather prolonged wedding-trip to Paris, and in their honour the banquet was professed to be given. As was but natural, Mrs. Caryll, a week before the event was to come off, took an opportunity of confiding to her husband her anxiety and fears lest cook should not be equal to the occasion, but before her ideas were completely developed, said husband cut her short. \" My dear Annie,\" he said, \" for this once you must let me have my own way. I do not"], [192, "184 THE CARYLLS. mean you to have any trouble at all. For that night only I intend to engage the services of an artist of Parisian celebrity, and a most invaluable greengrocer I know of with an equally invaluable friend of his, to assist John in waiting. All you will have to do will be to soothe cook's feelings, in case they are wounded by the intrusion of a stranger into the sacred precincts of her kitchen, and you may tell her that you hope she will improve the occa sion, and study the mysteries of culinary science under the auspices of so eminent a professor.\" \" My dear love,\" said Annie, providently, \"have you considered what it will cost?\" \" No, my darling, I have not,\" he replied, catching her in his arms, and kissing her, by way of stopping her remonstrances, \" I have not, and I do not mean to consider it till the day after. It is in honour of your dear friend and Edward's dear friend, and you surely would not wish us to economize on such an occasion. But set your mind at ease, it will not quite ruin us, and Brentford has promised to send the champagne.\""], [193, "185 THE CARYLLS. \" And whom are we to ask ? \" \" Everybody. Two Savages \u2014 just check them off on your fingers \u2014 two Shorehams, two Brentfords, two Leycesters, one Isleworth, one Beatrice, for I hope she will be in Port man-square by that time, and two Carylls. How many does that make?\" \" Twelve. My dear Walter, the dining room will not hold half of them.\" \" That is precisely where you are mistaken. Before I took the house I particularly en quired, and ascertained that the dining-room is built of elastic materials, and will stretch to any extent. Besides, they know Antwerp Villa is not Devonshire House, and will make allowances. We might certainly have a tent erected in the garden, but then it would be sure to pour, or if it did not, all the gamins in the neighbourhood would be clambering on to the wall and pelting us.\" In short, Walter's eloquence removed, or silenced, all his wife's objections, and she de voted herself with hearty good-will to make all necessary preparations for the reception of her guests. Half-an-hour before dinner on"], [194, "186 THE CARYLLS. the appointed day a cab drew up, containing Lord Isleworth's butler, in charge of the pro mised supply of champagne. Half-a-dozen bottles had been stowed away in a large tub filled with ice, which occupied the floor of the cab, and the unfortunate Mr. Strange, who had not been able comfortably to dispose of his legs, arrived, wet up to his ankles with water and melted ice. He bore it very good-humouredly, and took occasion to remind Walter of an in cident of his boyish days, when he and my lord (Brentford understood), combining their strength, had succeeded in pushing Strange into a ditch filled with snow. \" They were the wildest and most mischievous young gen tlemen I ever knew, ma'am,\" continued the butler, addressing Mrs. Caryll, \" and now to think of their being both married, and my lord with a son, the very moral of himself.\" \" Take care he does not push you into a ditch, too, Strange, when he is old enough,\" rejoined Walter ; \" he looks already as if he would like no better fun. But come into the dining-room and have a glass of wine, and I will give you a pair of clean stockings and"], [195, "THE CARYLLS. 187 slippers, while they dry your shoes by the fire.\" An offer which Mr. Strange, who was not young enough to despise rheumatics, thankfully accepted. Soon after the carriages of the expected guests began to arrive and deposit their freights, to the great admiration of the neigh bourhood, which rose almost to enthusiasm when the coronetted coach of Lord Isleworth made its appearance. Two very small boys attempted, unsuccessfully however, to raise a cheer in its honour, which Beatrice Ley cester attributed to their taking Lord Isleworth for the Lord Mayor. Nothing could have gone off better than the dinner. Everybody was inclined to be pleased and enjoy themselves to the utmost. Even the deficiencies of so small a house and establishment, instead of being productive of discomfort, were subjects for mirth, and after the first anxious five minutes, Annie dis missed all care from her mind, and joined in the conversation with as much zest as any one of her guests, which between most of them consisted of good-humoured chaff."], [196, "188 THE CARYLLS. Lord Brentford and Mr. Leycester had paired off together for the occasion. \" Leycester,\" said his lordship, with a sly look in the direction of his wife, \" this is much better fun than that infernal House of Com mons ; suppose we pair off for the rest of the session.\" \" With all my heart.\" \" My dear Brentford,\" said her ladyship in great alarm, \" you know you can do nothing of the sort. There is that petition from the scare-crow boys, praying for a redress of grievances, which you promised to present next week, and upon which you positively must say something.\" \" May I ask of what grievances those inte resting members of society complain, Lady Brentford ?\" said Sir Henry Savage. \" They ask for shorter hours and a half holiday on Saturdays.\" \" They had better petition the rooks and crows to get up later, and go to bed a few hours earlier,\" observed Leycester. \" I wonder, John,\" said Beatrice, \" how you would like to be screaming at the top of"], [197, "THE CARYLLS. 189 your voice from five o'clock in the morning till eight at night, and not able to join in the singing on Sundays because you are hoarse.\" \" That last, not being able to join in the singing, is, I confess, a real grievance, and ought to be seen to,\" replied Leycester. \" Maud and I,\" continued Beatrice, \" have been the whole morning wading through blue books and all sorts of documentary evidence, and we are convinced that those poor boys are the hardest worked and the worst paid members of the agricultural population.\" \" Hear, hear,\" cried Leycester. \" Bright in petticoats ! What a pity it is, Bee, that you cannot plead their cause yourself!\" \" What capital champagne this is,\" re marked Mr. Shoreham, noticing Beatrice's colour rise, and wishing to prevent hostilities. \" Where do you get it, Walter ?\" \" You must ask Lord Isleworth ; it comes from his cellars.\" \" You have drunk it before, Mr. Shore ham,\" said the donor ; \" and I hope you will very often drink it again. If you wish, I"], [198, "190 THE CARYLLS. will give you the address of my wine-mer chant.\" \" Give me some champagne,\" exclaimed Lord Brentford. \" Join me, Leycester, and we will drink the healths of Bee's protege's, the scarecrows. You ought to join us, both of you, Bee and Maud.\" \" Let the toast go round,\" said Sir Henry; 11 we will all drink it.\" \" That is all very well,\" rejoined Beatrice; \" but I give you fair notice, Brentford, if you do not do justice to those poor little boys, I wiU come down and oppose you myself, next election.\" \" Now, Miss Beatrice, you had better not threaten, or I shall be obliged to tell tales of you, which would effectually prevent your showing your face on the hustings.\" \" Tell tales of me ! Pray do ; you are quite welcome.\" \" Well, then, ladies and gentlemen, you must know that Miss Beatrice Leycester was detected in the act of endeavouring to sniuffede herself into the cab with Strange and the"], [199, "191 THE CARYLLS. champagne. Fortunately, the strong arm of the law arrested her in time, or I suspect we should have had but a beggarly account of empty bottles.\" \" Brentford, you are positively detestable. I wanted to have a quiet half-hour with Annie before you all came.\" \" Mr. Shoreham,\" continued Lord Brent ford, \" will you allow me to ask you, as a lawyer of eminence, what is the penalty at tached to such an offence ?\" \" Well, on the spur of the moment, I can hardly say ; but I will look into my books to morrow. As your lordship states it, it looks like an attempt at robbery under trust, the punishment for which is severe ; but of one thing I am certain, if Miss Leycester were to plead her own cause, she would obtain a ver dict from any jury in Christendom.\" \" Thank you, Mr. Shoreham. My dear Lucy, I congratulate you on having a gentle man for your husband; I wish I could say the same to poor dear Maud.\" Just before the ladies withdrew, Lord Isle-"], [200, "192 THE CARYLLS. worth complimented Annie on the dinner and the perfect arrangement of all its details. \" I am glad you approve,\" she replied, \" but the praise is entirely due to Walter ; he took all the trouble off my hands.\" \" Well, to whomsoever we owe it, there is no fault to be found with it. The dinner it self was perfection. I rather pique myself upon my cook ; but I doubt his acquitting himself as well as yours.\" \" I rather think, my lord, I give higher wages than you do,\" said Walter. \" I give seven hundred and thirty pounds a year to my man.\" \" My dear Walter, what can you mean ?\" asked Lucy Shoreham. \" Just what I say. I give him two pounds for this day's work, and two pounds a day, I take it, is seven hundred and thirty pounds a year.\" \" How shocking!\" \" What extravagance!\" \" Annie, how could you let him !\" burst in various tones from the female cohort, under cover of which they disappeared, leaving their"], [201, "193 THE CARYLLS. mates to the discussion of the Honble. Edward Oakley's claret, which met with as much ap probation as his grandfather's champagne. They did not remain long, however, at this interesting occupation ; and, as soon as coffee had been disposed of, the Shorehams took their leave, followed soon after by Lord Isle worth and Louisa Leycester, who accepted his lordship's offer to take her home. The others remained some time longer ; cards were produced, and it was considerably past mid night when the party finally dispersed. \" Well, Annie,\" said Walter, in high glee, when the Brentfords and Beatrice, who were the last, had taken their departure, \" I think it went off famously ; even Leycester was good-humoured to the last, and Louisa seemed quite to have forgotten all her melancholy anticipations.\" \" Yes, everybody seemed pleased ; but Louisa was tired before she went away.

But she was not the less desirous of having her sister-in-law with her as much as possible, and in this Annie was willing to gratify her to the utmost of her power, greatly to Walter's discomfiture, though he acquiesced with a tolerably good grace ; and this really said much in favour of his good-nature, for his position was not as pleasant now as it had been during his wife's close attendance on Maud. Lord Brentford had been his companion and play-fellow in the days of his boyhood ; his intimate friend since they had grown up. They had a thousand recollections in common, a thousand topics to discuss, in which they both took"], [203, "195 THE CARYLLS. equal interest ; neither of them felt the time hang heavy when left to each other's society, while their wives were talking nursery up stairs ; but with Leycester it was different. He and his brother-in-law were apparently on good terms, but that was all ; with the best will in the world, Walter found it impossible to sympathize with one whose disposition was so different from his own. It was, of course, an understood thing that, whenever Mrs. Caryll was passing the evening in Park Street, her husband was expected to dine there; but of this he availed himself spar ingly, and generally when it was probable that Mr. Leycester would be detained in the House. That gentleman was fond of sitting after dinner, and a long tete-a-tete was the one thing which Walter was especially desir ous of avoiding. Latterly, too, Leycester had been much less regular in his attention to his Parliamentary duties than in the com mencement of his career. He generally con trived to be at home in time for dinner ; the excuse he gave was the delicate state of his k 2"], [204, "196 THE CARYLLS. wife's health. On these occasions, while his wife was ministering to Louisa, Mr. Caryll was generally taking his pleasure elsewhere ; sometimes quietly at the Shorehams', some times at the Brentfords', the Savages', or any other house to which he might chance to be invited. \" It is hard upon you, Annie,\" he said to his wife, \" to be such a slave t > Louisa's fancies. It is hard upon us both to live in such a state of separation ; but I suppose it will not last much longer; and, of one thing you may be certain, as soon as Loo's business is over, my sisters may have children as fast as rabbits, if they and their husbands please , but they shall never again inveigle you away from me on such a plea. I shall tell them I expect to be confined myself, and re quire your constant attendance.\" \" But, dear Walter, you might dine there oftener.\" \" And if I did, I should not see much more of you.

I tell you honestly I could not do it. I have every wish to avoid quar relling with him ; but, I declare to you, it is as much as I can do to refrain, when he con tradicts me flat ; gives me the lie, in fact, about things of which he knows nothing, and persons with whom I am better acquainted than he is.\" Mrs. Caryll made no further observation, but Beatrice Leycester soon after, took Walter sharply to task for what she was pleased to style his neglect of his wife. \" You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\" she said, \" dancing, laughing, and flirting every night of your life, and all night long, while your wife is devoting herself to your sister. If you do not like John's society, which I can quite understand, you ought to pass your evenings quietly at home, and read good books till Annie returns. It would be much more decent and respectable.'' \" My dear Bee, don't you know ? The house is haunted ; full of ghosts and ghos tesses.

The discomforts attending daily intercourse with Mr. Leycester, which Mr. Walter Caryll so carefully eschewed, Annie was destined to experience in their full force, though in a very different sense. He appeared fully to parti- cipate in the partiality which his wife pro- fessed for her society, and overwhelmed her with attentions, which to any one but Louisa might have appeared suspicious, or at least overstrained. He addressed her with a fami- liarity, from which, though it was justified by their close connection, she instinctively re- coiled. In Mrs. Leycester's presence she thought herself obliged to submit to it, and even, to a certain extent, to respond to it, under penalty of being called upon for expla- nations, which she had neither the power, nor the inclination, to give. But, if he fancied that by such conduct he was making any pro-"], [208, "200 THE CARYLLS. gress in her favour, he deceived himself most egregiously. Every night she returned home with a fiercer feeling of indignation, and at times she shuddered at the amount of bitter hatred against him which was slowly accu mulating in her heart ; all the more that she saw no means of escape from his persecutions. He had poisoned the happiness of her youth ; where or to whom could she turn for protec tion now ? How could she best shield the happiness of her married life against this fresh aggression ? One morning he rode up to St. John's Wood, under pretence of asking after a cold, of which she had complained on the previous evening. He knew he should find her at home, for she had announced her intention of devot ing the whole of that day to domestic affairs, which had fallen in arrear. What his precise object was he did not know himself. Not withstanding all that had passed between them, he could not divest himself of the idea that there still lurked a kindly feeling towards himself in Annie's breast, some smouldering spark of the passionate love which had once"], [209, "201 THE CARYLLS. filled it, and which might yet be re-kindled, but how that process was to be effected was not exactly clear ; he must trust to circum stances to bring it about. Had Annie consulted her own peace, she would have refrained in Leycester's presence from all expressions of attachment for her husband ; she would have allowed him to suppose that, on finding herself abandoned by him, she had jumped at the first offer that was made her, and had accepted Walter's hand, saute de mieux. In that case Leycester, in all probability, would have troubled his head no further about her. Eut Annie was proud of her husband, proud of his many excellent qualities, proud of having won a heart so well worth winning ; her affection for him was deep and sincere, and she had no objection to letting Mr. Leycester see that she thought she had been no loser in the exchange she had made. His vanity was piqued by this honest, though indiscreet, avowal ; he could not endure the thought that he was not only forgotten, but that the love which had once been his k 5"], [210, "202 THE CARYLLS. was transferred to a man whom he disliked, and whom he affected to despise. At present his designs were limited to obtaining from Annie some acknowledgment that he was still the object of her secret preference. That once obtained, it would be time enough to consider what was to be done next. When Leycester entered Mrs. Caryll's sit ting-room, he found her occupied with various interesting documents emanating from her butcher, baker, laundress, etc., and not at aU inclined to waste her time in idle conversa tion. \" I see,\" he said, \" you are surprised by my visit, but you seemed so oppressed by your cold when you left us last night, I felt sq uneasy about you, that I could not resist the temptation of calling, to see how you are going on.\" \" My cold ! Oh, I suppose it is better, or gone altogether, but I have really been so busy all the morning that 1 have not had time to think about it.\" \"And I am afraid you look upon my visit now as an unseasonable interruption.\""], [211, "203 THE CARYLLS. To this observation Annie made no reply. It is sometimes so much more convenient to let silence speak for one than words. But, though the hint had been thrown out by himself, he did not choose to take it. \"It really puts one in mind of old times,\" he said, taking a seat, \" to see you in the midst of bills and household accounts. Do you remember how I used to give you a helping hand in adding up pounds, shillings, and pence ? \" \"No ; I have forgotten all about it.\" \" It is impossible,\" he exclaimed, with great warmth. \" Annie, you are trying to prove too much ; it is utterly impossible that you can have forgotten the time when we were all in all to each other ; if you have, I have not.\" \" That only proves that we are differently constituted,\" she replied coldly. \"I have no difficulty in forgetting what I have no wish to remember.\" \" Annie, Annie, this coldness is not natural to you. I have received too many proofs \u2014 \" \" Mr. Leycester, once for all, I will not listen to such language. Connected as we are, I have no wish to break with you, but if you"], [212, "204 THE CAUYLLS. persist, I will leave the room, and never set foot in your house again.\" \" Forgive me, Annie, for giving way to my feelings. Believe me, I had no intention of offending you, but you cannot refuse to restore to me some portion of the friendship and regard I once enjoyed.\" At this moment a carriage drove up. \" For heaven's sake,\" he said, \" tell them to say not at home.\" Mrs. Caryll looked through the window to see who her visitor might be, and rang the bell. \" John,\" she said, to the servant who answered it, \" give my love to Lady Savage, tell her I am at home, and hope she will come in.\" \" Annie,'' said Leycester furiously, and jumping up as the door closed, \" you will carry this too far; be warned in time.\" He left the house, stopped to speak a few words to Lady Savage, as she was crossing the front garden, then mounted his horse and rode off. \" Am 1 disturbing you, Annie ?\" was Lady Savage's first question."], [213, "205 THE CARYLLS. \" Disturbing me ! No. What put such a thing into your head ?\" \" Mr. Leycester said you were busy, and that he doubted any visitors being welcome j ust now. If I am in your way, say so, and I will come another day.\" \" My dear Fanny, busy or not, you are always welcome, most welcome. What Mr. Leycester could mean I cannot imagine.\" But Mr. Leycester's meanings and actions soon ceased to occupy Annie's mind under the influence of the shock occasioned by his wife's death. After a most difficult and pro tracted confinement, Louisa Leycester was delivered of a daughter, but her strength was completely exhausted, and it was evident that, from the first, the gentleman who attended her entertained but small hopes of her recovery. On the first symptom, she had insisted on the carriage being sent for Mrs. Caryll, with an urgent entreaty that she would come at once. Annie complied with out a moment's hesitation ; a room was pre pared for her in Park Street, and during the short remnant of Louisa's life she never"], [214, "206 THE CARYLLS. quitted the house. To her was tacitly re signed the government of the sick room, and one of her first acts, after a conference with tbe medical man, was to telegraph for Sir Edward and Miss Caryll. Not a fault was to be found in Mr. Leycester's conduct. He thanked Annie for her kindness in coming as he handed her out of the carriage, he ac quiesced in all her suggestions, and scrupu lously abstained from any topic that could be disagreeable to her ; and, if at the bottom of his heart his wife's danger excited no great amount of affliction, he made outwardly a very proper display of grief and anxiety. On the third day the child was seized with convulsions, which proved fatal. It was im possible to conceal this event from the mother. \" Ah,\" she cried, \" if my little child is gone, I am content to go too.\" She did not speak much after this, except to thank those around her for the kindness she had received from them. Her heart softening as death approached, she entreated forgiveness of her husband for any neglect of"], [215, "207 THE CARYLLS. her duty towards him of which she might have been guilty. \" I know,\" she said, \" that when we have disagreed, my manner has frequently been unpleasant and irritating ; that I have resisted when I ought to have submitted. Forgive me, for I think, if it pleased God to spare my life, I would endeavour to correct my defects.\" The last words she uttered had reference to her eldest brother and his wife, to whom she sent her most affectionate love. The last request she made was, that she and her baby might be buried with her own kin. With this prayer Leycester promised com pliance, although it hurt his pride to see how completely his wife's last thoughts were en grossed by her own family. But, though the impression was transient, he was deeply affected. He could not but remember that only a few short months had elapsed since he had stood beside her at the altar, when she was in the full radiance of almost perfect beanty, glowing with youth and health, and hopes of happiness ; and now\u2014 When the last"], [216, "208 THE CARYLLS. breath fleeted from her lips, he stooped down and reverentially kissed her inanimate re mains, while his tears flowed as freely as those of any of her relations. The funeral took place at the Holt, as she had desired, and as soon as it was over, her husband returned to Tuftons, where for a week or two he remained in complete soli tude. But this mode of life was one for which he was but little adapted. Parliament was still sitting, and he determined to return to his political duties, which, while he kept aloof from general society, would furnish him with ample occupation for his mind. Before leaving the country, he paid a visit of a few days at the Holt. With all the members of Louisa's family he was upon good terms, and Sir Edward, whom he had always treated with deference and respect, really liked him. Whatever dissensions may have existed be tween him and his late wife, they had been reserved entirely for private discussion, and had never been obtruded upon the public. No one knew better than Leycester the value of Napoleon's maxim \u2014 \" qu'il faut laver son"], [217, "209 THE CARYLLS. linge sale en families' and Louisa was the last person in the world to take anyone into the confidence of her domestic grievances. Nor, indeed, had their differences ever dege nerated into positive quarrels ; it was rather the case of two persons pulling against each other in contrary directions. But the con test, though decorously conducted, was inces sant, and as both were beginning to be heartily tired of it, it is difficult to say how much longer it would have continued without break ing out into acts of open hostility. At the time of Louisa's death, however, they were still living apparently on good terms together, and might have been quoted as a very fair specimen of matrimonial harmony. By his father-in-law and Miss Caryll he was received with affectionate sympathy. Great as to them was the loss of a daughter and a sister, to him the loss of such a wife must be far greater, and he was treated with a gentle tenderness, which, to say truth, bored him not a little. From a woman with whom he was in love he expected a passionate return, but for general affection he cared but"], [218, "210 THE CARYLLS. little, and on the present occasion he adopted an ingenious mode of repressing it. \" My dear Caroline,\" be said to Miss Caryll, when he found himself alone with her, \" I know your father does it with the kindest intentions, but every allusion to the loss I have sustained is most painful to me ; even the softening of his voice when he addresses me recalls my misfortune. I endeavour to harden myself that I may bear my affliction with fortitude and resignation ; do not let him weaken me by attempts at consolation which at present produce a contrary effect. They only irritate a wound not yet healed.\" Miss Caryll promised to speak to her father on the subject, for she could quite understand the feelings which her brother-in-law pro fessed. \" But I must do it cautiously,\" she said, \" for I think it is a relief to him to speak of her. When we are alone he is never weary of recalling her beauty, her talents, and above all the affection which she extended to every one connected with her. He says, and says. truly, that, in losing her we lost the brightest flower in our garden. But forgive me; I am"], [219, "211 THE CARYLLS. doing the very thing I must try to check in him. We must learn to command ourselves.\" And they did learn to command them selves, at least in their visitor's presence, who, by this proof of extreme sensibility, acquired a fresh claim to the regard of both. \" There are not many,\" said Sir Edward, \" who would have been worthy of my poor darling, but he was. He is right ; there is but One who can breathe comfort into his heart; tbe words of man can but add to his affliction.\" Leycester's merits as a mourner preceded him to London. \" It only shows how little one can know a fellow,\" said Lord Brentford, when his wife had finished reading a letter just received from her sister. \" Of course I expected that he would be terribly cut up, as indeed we all were, but I should never have given him credit for such depth of feeling.\" \" You did not see him/' Maud replied, \" as I did at the last fatal moment. No one could have doubted his depth of feeling then. And she deserved it all. Dear, dear Louisa !\" she"], [220, "212 THE CAEYLLS. continued, with the tears rolling down her cheeks. \" So proud, yet so affectionate ; so quick, yet so ready to forgive ; so beautiful, so clever, and yet so destitute of vanity. It will be long before we see her like again !\" \" It will indeed. I have her always before my eyes as she was when I took her in to dinner at Walter's. I can hardly yet realize her death.\" In short, among the Carylls and their con nections there was all but perfect unanimity in admiration of Mr. Leycester's language and deportment as a disconsolate mourner. Even Walter began to look upon him with other eyes. The only two exceptions were Beatrice and Mrs. Caryll ; the first from a conviction of his thorough heartlessness founded on general observation of his charac ter, the second from a similar conviction derived from an intimate acquaintance with his disposition, and which recent circum stances had tended to confirm. They had the good sense, however, to keep their thoughts to themselves. The effect of this universal homage paid"], [221, "213 THE CARYLLS. to his virtues was of a twofold nature on Leycester himself. If, on the one hand, it was agreeable to be held up as a model widower to the eyes of an admiring world, on the other, it was extremely irksome, and occasionally difficult, to act up to the character thus unexpectedly thrust upon him. Without society he was miserable, and the only society he could now decently frequent, besides his club, was that of his wife's relations, where it behoved him to be doubly circumspect in his general demeanour. The only one of them with whom he felt at his ease was Mrs. Caryll ; he was quite aware that she, at all events, could not share the general opinion respecting the all-absorbing nature of his grief. One of his first visits on his return to town was to her, and he at once laid aside the cloak of hypocrisy in which he was now habitually shrouded. \" I have been looking over all my poor wife's things,\" he said, \" and in her writing-desk I found a list of legacies to different persons. Of course, legally, it is worth nothing, for she could not leave a pin to anyone without my concurrence, but with"], [222, "214 THE CARYLLS. most of her requests I shall feel great pleasure in complying. One of them is that you should have her dressing-case, and I hope you will accept it as our joint gift.\" But as a joint gift she had every objection to accept it. \" Indeed, you must not be offended if I decline it. Poor Louisa talked to me on this very subject not long before her death, and I then told her that I could not accept anything of value from her : it would look too much like payment for any trifling service I may have had it in my power to render her ; and she then took off that old Etruscan brooch which she was in the habit of wearing, and gave it to me with a lock of her hair which she cut off, saying that she hoped I would keep it for her sake, whether she lived or died.\" \" Oh, you have got that brooch, have you? I have been looking for it everywhere, and concluded her maid had stolen it. But about this dressing-case. You are carrying your delicacy too far. I trust as soon as I have had it cleaned, you will allow me to send it you.\""], [223, "215 THE CARYLLS. \" No, indeed, you must not ask me. I told Walter what had passed between his sister and myself, and he entirely approved me.\" \" Oh, if you have your husband's approba tion, I have done. I am quite aware that any representations of mine would pass un heeded, if opposed to his decision.'' \" And you must not be surprised,\" Annie continued, \" if you miss many little trinkets. I know for instance that Louisa gave some thing to Mrs. Shoreham for each of her nieces. She had all the generosity of the Caryll's.\" \" It is very easy to be generous with what does not belong to one,\" grumbled out Ley cester. \" I suppose she had a right to dispose of her property as she pleased while she was still alive,\" said Annie, rather warmly. \"I am not so sure of that, but I was think ing of some of her legacies. Fancy her hav ing left the diamonds Lord Isleworth gave her to Mary Caryll. To that I most decidedly refuse my consent ; they ought to be con sidered as heirlooms. Do you not think I am right ?\""], [224, "216 THE CARYLLS. \" Really, Mr. Leycester, in such a matter you must be guided by your own feelings.\" \" Feelings ! a regular woman's word. I shall be guided by my sense of right and jus tice. If I only consulted my feelings I would offer them to the only woman round whose neck I could bear to see them. Will you accept them, Annie ? \" \"Certainly not. How can you suppose for a moment that, after having refused the dress ing-case, I would accept diamonds, which you tell me in one breath are left to my sister-in law, and which in the next you announce your intention of considering as heirlooms ! \" \" Say at once that you will accept nothing from me.\" \" I accept nothing without consulting my husband.\" \" Yrou are hard upon me, Annie. But 1 have no right to complain ; I have brought it on myself.\" There was a moment's silence. \" And to think,\" he continued, \"now, that I bitterly repent my past conduct, that I have every wish to do you justice ; now, that the obstacle,"], [225, "217 THE CARYLLS. raised by myself in a moment of madness and folly, is removed, there still remains the obstacle raised by you ! \" \" Mr. Leycester, if every obstacle that stands between us were removed, rest assured, that we should never be more to each other than we are at present. From you I require no justice. I did it to myself by breaking with the past, and it certainly is not now that T should wish to revive any recollections of it. I have told you this before ; I told you that I would not listen to you on this subject, and as you have chosen to revert to it, I must decline ever again receiving you alone.\" \" Rather a desperate expedient, Annie, to tell your servant to say not at home to a brother-in-law ! \" he said with what he meant for a smile, but which degenerated into a sneer, for he was beginning to lose his temper. \" Desperate or not, I shall adopt it.\" \" I think, Mrs. Caryll, before you have recourse to such strong measures, you would do well to reflect how far I may be disposed to submit to them ; it is quite clear to me that VOL.

Bad policy, Annie; for, I am sorry to say, it leaves you slightly at my mercy.\" \" I thought I had been speaking to a gen tleman ; I find I am mistaken,\" she said, rising from her seat and leaving the room. Leycester waited a few minutes, and finding she did not return, sat down at the writing table, and wrote the following note: \"Is it possible that you can have thought me in earnest in what I last said to you ? If I were really capable of using such a threat, I should indeed deserve the reproach you addressed to me on leaving the room, and more. But you do me cruel wrong.

Though so often repulsed, Mr. Leycester was far from being discouraged. He was a man of violent passions and great tenacity of pur pose, and having set his heart upon re-estab lishing himself in Annie's good graces, he determined upon neglecting no means for effecting that desirable purpose. Hitherto it was evident that he had not taken the right path; wheedling and intimidation had both been tried in vain ; and moreover, to avoid the ignominy of being refused admittance to Mrs. Caryll's presence, he had found himself obliged to make a merit of necessity, and promise to abstain from seeking all private interviews. Fortunately for him, this self-imposed res triction did not apply to his intercourse with Annie's husband, and he set about cultivating"], [229, "THE CARYLLS. 221 his favour with great assiduity and propor tionate success. Walter, in common with the rest of the family, gave Kim full credit for the sincerity of his grief, and felt himself the more bound to do his best to alleviate it, that his conscience pricked him for former uncharit able speeches and sentiments. One day he met Leycester in the street, and having ascer tained that he was on his way to eat a solitary mutton-chop at his club, insisted on carrying him home to dinner. Mrs. Caryll was already in the drawing room when they made their appearance, and when Walter went up-stairs to wash his hands, Leycester said, in a deprecatory tone, \" I trust, Annie, you will not consider this as an infringe ment of our agreement. Walter was so vehe ment and positive, that I really did not know what excuse to make.\" \" Any guest of Walter's is welcome here,\" she replied. During dinner Leycester resumed his cheer fulness, addressing his hostess with easy courtesy, and carefully abstaining from the slightest approach to undue familiarity. He"], [230, "222 THE CARYLLS. was obliged to leave them early, a division of some importance being expected in the House. \" Mrs. Caryll,\" he said, before he took his leave, \" I have a great favour to ask of you. Will you allow me to put my carriage at your disposal ? It has not been out for weeks ; not since and the horses require work. It will really be an obligation to me and to them.\" \" Thank you,\" she replied, \"but whenever I want a carriage, which is very seldom, Maud sends me her brougham.\" \" But the brougham is a close carriage, and surely in this delightful summer weather you would prefer an open one.\" \" I have been suffering so much from neuralgia lately, that I should be afraid of venturing out in an open carriage.\" Mr. Leycester did not press the point any further ; he expressed his sorrow at hearing that she had been attacked by so painful a disorder, and said that, if ever she did feel inclined for his carriage, he hoped she would send for it without ceremony. \" And remember, Leycester,\" said his brother-in-law, \" we shall always be glad to"], [231, "THE CARYLLS. 223 see you to dinner, when you have nothing better to do.'' \" I think, Annie,\" said Walter, when their visitor had left them, \" it was a little ungra cious on your part to refuse the offer of the carriage. Leycester was evidently in earnest in making it, and we ought to do everything in our power to make him feel that we still consider him as belonging to us.\" \" My dear Walter, I had no intention of being ungracious; I merely meant to refuse an offer that would do me harm. The last time Maud took me out, as you know, I suffered agonies all night, and Dr. Snow attributed it entirely to the open carriage. Besides, I am exceedingly nervous in a carriage, and Maud's coachman is very careful and very good natured ; he drives the brougham as slow as I please, which probably would not be the case with Mr. Leycester's.\" \" Yes, dearest, you are right ; I was only afraid that Leycester might feel hurt.

I should not use it once a week.\" \" Well, we shall see. if you do not use it, so much the better for me ; it will save me my omnibus fare to and fro. But sufficient for the day are the expenses thereof. Have you finished your letter to Mary ? To-morrow is post-day, and I will enclose yours in mine to Edward. I am very anxious to know how he will take poor Louisa's death. He must know it by this time, and I am afraid he will feel it severely. He was as proud of her as we all were.\" Walter and his wife had received from Major Caryll and Lady Mary letters filled with the warmest and most affectionate con gratulations, in answer to those announcing their marriage, and since then the two sisters in-law had been in regular correspondence, and,were looking forward with pleasure to the time when they should become personally acquainted. Every letter which Lady Mary"], [233, "225 THE CARYLLS. had received from the different members of her husband's family was filled with praises of their new relation ; and what, perhaps, influ enced her more than anything else in Annie's favour was a long letter, which Beatrice Leycester, contrary to her usual habits, had taken the trouble of writing on the same subject, in which she spoke of Mrs. Walter Caryll in terras of high commendation. \" I am satisfied,\" she said to Edward, when she finished Miss Leycester's letter. \" I was afraid Walter had done a very foolish thing, and I begin to think he has done a very wise one.\" \" Of course he has. My sisters might have convinced you of that.\" \" Yes, but I could not quite trust them. I have been a Caryll long enough myself to be aware that, in Caryll eyes, no Caryll can do anything but what is best and wisest. I might have considered your sisters as prejudiced, but Beatrice is an impartial witness, if indeed her partiality does not go a little the other way ; for, between ourselves, I suspect that there L 5"], [234, "226 THE CARYLLS. were moments when she almost regretted that she had been so precipitate in her rejec tion of Walter.\" \" Poor, dear Beatrice ! \" said Edward, \" I am sure I hope not.\" \" Oh, if that feeling ever existed, which after all is only a very vague idea of rcy own, it has quite vanished now, or she could not speak of Annie as she does.\" In the meantime Leycester had not for gotten Walter's parting words. One morning he drove up to St. John's Wood, and, without getting out, sent in a note to Mrs. Caryll, saying that he would not venture to avail himself of her husband's general invitation without her permission, but that, if it was not disagreeable to her, he would dine with them on the following day; and requested an answer. Which answer was brought out to him without delay. \" Mrs. Caryll's compliments, and they would be very happy to see him on the morrow.\" It so happened that on that day Annie had made arrangements to go out shopping with Miss Leycester, and she profited by the oppor-"], [235, "227 THE CARYLLS. tunity to ask her companion to meet her cousin at dinner. \" It will be a real charity,\" she said, \" for it is generally at that time my neuralgia comes on, and sometimes I can hardly hold up my head ; it is true I have not had it these two days, but I am never safe.\" \" Of course I will, though I confess there are many people whose society I prefer to John's.

Has he taken you in like all the rest ?'' \" I do not suppose,\" replied Annie, evasively, \" that anyone could lose such a wife and not feel the loss acutely.\" \" Don't you ? Then I do. 1 do not believe that a man, who, like John Leycester, has lived all his life without a heart, will find one all at once to mourn and grieve with.

But for heaven's sake do not betray me. The Brentfords, and Walter, and even Lucy Shoreham, in short all that is Caryll, are infatuated with him, and, if they had their way, would send me to Tower Hill to have my head chopped off for broaching such an opinion. My only comfort is that they will find him out sooner or later.\" \" My dear Beatrice, how vehement you are in your dislikes !\" said Mrs. Caryll, for want of something better to say. \" Je sut's payie pour cela. But let us go to a more interesting subject. Are you never to get rid of this neuralgia ? What does your doctor say?\" \" He says change of air is my best chance. But I do not like to leave Walter alone. I have not even mentioned it to him.\" \" My dear Annie, this is really carrying your scruples too far. For his sake, as well as your own, you ought to do your utmost to conquer so painful a disorder while it is yet time, before it gets a permanent hold of you. Next week I return to May Bank; come with me.\""], [237, "229 THE CARYLLS. \" I should like it well, but, if I do leave town, I ought to go to the Holt.\" Mr. Leycester was disagreeably surprised by Mrs. Caryll's delicate attention in securing his cousin's assistance to amuse him. He stood rather in awe of that young lady's powers of observation, and felt that he must be upon his best behaviour in her presence. He arrived at the villa half an hour before dinner, and was fortunate enough to find Annie alone, Beatrice being upstairs, putting herself to rights, to use her own expression. He was now convinced that whatever feelings of affection Annie might once have enter tained for him had completely vanished, and that to revive them must be a work of time. He had startled her by some of his previous observations, and his object now must be to obliterate them from her memory and endea vour to regain her confidence.

It is but fair to add that, as yet, his aspirations went no further than to break down the barrier of frigid reserve and indifference within which Annie had in trenched herself. Could he but wrest from her some expression of good will ; could he but win upon her regard till she admitted him to her intimacy, on the footing of a friend and confidant, he thought he could rest con tent, nor ask for more. Though a man of few scruples and less principle, he would have recoiled from shocking the world by appearing openly in the character of his sister-in-law's lover. He had come early on purpose to show Mrs. Caryll that she had nothing to fear from a tete-a-tete, He met her in the most easy and unembarrassed manner possible, enquired after her neuralgia without too great an ap pearance of interest, and was complimenting her upon the magnificent show of flowers in her garden, when the door opened, and Miss Leycester entered the room. \" Beatrice!\" he exclaimed, in a tone of"], [239, "THE CARYLLS. 231 voice indicative rather of surprise than plea sure. \" I had no idea you were here. When did you come?\" \" I have been here this hour. Annie and I have been out shopping together, and she brought me home to dinner.\" She had said her say to Annie, and fortu nately was now in a pacific mood. Walter came in soon after, and the evening passed away without any skirmishing. In the course of it the conversation again turned to horti cultural pursuits, and Leycester offered Mrs. Caryll some valuable plants which ornamented his balcony in Park Street. \"After this season,\" he said, \"I shall never live there again, and I have written to Mary to ask her to allow me to give it up, or to underlet it during her absence.\" \" Annie will be delighted to have your flowers,\" said Walter ; \" but what are your plans for this winter? Do you return to Tuftons ?\" \"Only to make some necessary arrange ments. I intend to go abroad as soon as I can, and shall probably winter in Italy.\""], [240, "232 THE CARYLLS. Annie breathed a sigh of relief. She would, however, have declined the offer of the flowers, but her husband had already ac cepted them for her, and to enter a protest now would, with justice, expose her to the charge of being wantonly churlish. She thanked him, therefore, graciously enough. \" Though where I shall find room for them,\" she continued, \"I hardly know.\" \" I think I saw two or three unoccupied spots which would just suit them,\" replied Leycester. \" I'll tell you what, Leycester, if you were disposed to be very good-natured, you would come some morning and assist Annie with your advice. The flower-garden at Tuftons is quite a model of good taste. I shall be out probably, but she will give you some luncheon, I have no doubt.'' \" I shall be most happy if Mrs. Caryll will accept my services.'' Of course she was obliged to accept. On the following day a cart arrived at Antwerp Villa filled with plants, followed soon after by the donor himself, who having thus esta-"], [241, "233 THE CARYLLS. blished his footing under Mr. Walter Caryll's auspices, repeated his visits three or four times a week. On all these occasions he scru pulously abstained from anything that could be interpreted as an allusion to the past; he never gave utterance to an expression at which she could take offence, no word fell from his lips which could distress her, or even embarrass her ; and yet her discomposure at these frequent visits was extreme. Every thing connected with them was a subject of annoyance, from the habits of intimacy which she felt were gradually springing up between them, and which she was so anxious to avert, down to the very deference with which Ley cester treated her, and which she instinctively felt had nothing in it real and sincere. Nor was this mode of treatment particularly ad vantageous as a remedy for the malady from which she was suffering. Her attacks of neuralgia became more violent and more fre quent, her state of nervous irritation increased till at times it was almost unbearable, and frequently she could only obtain a few hours of troubled sleep at night by the use of narcotics."], [242, "234 THE CARYLLS. She concealed it as well as she could from her husband, but he saw quite enough to make him very uneasy. At his entreaty she consulted a physician of eminence, but his prescriptions were of little avail, and the ad vice he gave her \u2014 to keep her mind at rest \u2014 though excellent, it was not easy, under present circumstances, to carry out. One ex pedient there was, but it was one to which she was very loth to have recourse, but at length feeling that her position morally, as well as physically, grew more intolerable every day, with desperate courage she avowed to her husband her conviction that, as long as she remained in London, there was no chance of her recovering her health. A few weeks passed at the Holt in peace and quiet, while the summer yet lasted, would no doubt set her up again. \" Then, for heaven's sake, my love, try it at once,\" said Walter. \" I will write to Caro line to-day about it. When shall I say you will be there?\" \" To-morrow ; to-day if it were possible. And yet to leave you, Walter, sends a pan*"], [243, "THE CARYLLS. 235 through my heart. Your love is all that has sustained me hitherto ; what shall I do without it ?\" \" My Annie, my own darling, my love will be with you still, absent or present, and after all our separation will not be for long. I will take my holiday as early as I can, and in the meantime I will run down occasionally on Saturdays to see how you are going on. Do you think your love is less necessary to my happiness than mine is to yours?\" \" Yes, I know it ; I should be miserable if I thought otherwise. But do you think Sir Edward can receive me at such a short notice?\" \" Of course he can. They are quite alone at the Holt, and if tbe estate is small, the house in all conscience is large enough. I will write at once, and say you will be with them to-morrow to dinner.\" \" And, dear Walter, please say nothing about it to anyone till I am gone ; not even to your sisters or Mr. Leycester. I could not bear all the leave-takings. My heart is heavy enough as it is ; our first separation ! \""], [244, "236 THE CARYLLS. \" And our last, I trust,\" he replied, kissing her. Mrs. Walter Caryll departed on the follow ing day, and was at the Holt before it was even guessed that she had left London. Walter walked into the Brentfords' dining roon just as they were sitting down to a tete a-tete dinner, for Beatrice Leycester had left them. \" I am come,\" he said, \" to ask you to take compassion upon a miserable wretch, deserted by his wife.\" \" Why, what has become of Annie ? \" they both exclaimed. \" I hope by this time she is at the Holt, and I have no doubt my father has treated her more hospitably than you seem inclined to treat me, and invited her to partake of his dinner.'' \" John, give Mr. Caryll a chair and plate,\" said Maud. \" And now tell us all about it.'' \" There is not much to tell. You know how much she has been suffering lately, and after talking the matter over, we determined"], [245, "237 THE CARYLLS. to see what change of air would do for her ; it was settled yesterday ; to-day I took her to the station ; and half-an-hour ago I received a telegram from her, saying that the journey had been successfully performed, that she had had no return of neuralgia, and that Caroline was waiting for her with the carriage to take her home.\" \" Poor Annie ! I should like to have seen her before she went, but Brentford thinks that in three weeks at furthest we shall be able to get away ourselves.'' \" Well, while you stay will you give me a bed here? In the first place, I should die no other death, if I were compelled to inhabit our mansion in St. John's Wood all alone, and in the next, I want to take advantage of her absence to have it thoroughly cleaned and whitewashed, and one or two of the rooms new papered.\" \" There are four bedrooms quite at your service, while we are here, and after we are gone,\" said Lord Brentford. \" You may sleep in all four beds at once, if you like.\" \" Thank you, one will do. After dinner I"], [246, "238 THE CARYLLS. will just write one line to Leycester, to warn him that the bird is flown, and then I think I shall take a cab, and go down to Kensington to tell Lucy ; it may save them a useless journey.\" \" Never miqd writing to Leycester ; I am going down to the House in half-an-hour, where I am sure to meet him, and I will tell him all about it.\" \" And,\" said Maud, \" I will order the car riage and take you to Kensington. I have not seen Lucy for some days. Do you mean to sleep hereto-night?\" \" No. Not till the day after to-morrow ; I must put my house in order first.\" For a short time after her arrival at the Holt Annie derived decided benefit from the change, but it was not lasting ; the attacks of neuralgia returned, with increased violence, though at somewhat longer intervals. This re-appearance of a disease, which she had hoped she was getting the better of, threw her into despair, and she caught at any remedy that seemed to promise alleviation of the agonies she endured, trying everything that"], [247, "THE CARYLLS. 239 was suggested to her by turns. Her last and best resource seemed to be a visit to the sea side, and thither Walter had promised to take her as soon as he got his leave. In the mean time she had every reason to be satisfied with her reception at the Holt ; with Miss Caryll she was on the best possible terms, and she had firmly established herself in her father-in law's affection. But for her husband's absence, and the fearful paroxysms of pain to which she was so frequently subjected, she would have had nothing further to wish for. But even this state of incomplete tranquil lity was not destined to be of long conti nuance. Parliament was prorogued, and Mr. Leycester returned to Tuftons, to settle his affairs there before starting for the Continent, which it was his intention to do in the course of a couple of months. But Tuftons, with out wife or guests to enliven it, was but a melancholy abode, and he eagerly accepted Sir Edward's invitation to pass a week or two at the Holt. Here Annie was thrown into a closer intercourse with him than had ever been the case since she left Lynburn. Sir"], [248, "240 THE CARYLLS. Edward was perpetually engaged with his bailiff or steward, and Miss Caryll's mornings were generally devoted to domestic affairs, or the very extensive correspondence which she kept up with all the absent members of the family. Annie also passed much of her time in her own room ; still there were many hours in the day during which she was necessarily in Leycester's society. Caroline and her father encouraged their being as much toge ther as possible, under the idea that it would make their life at the Holt less dull for both of them ; consequently, Leycester became Annie's constant attendant in her walks, and companion indoors, greatly to her annoyance. It was impossible for her to recede from the terms of intimacy on which Mr. Leycester had contrived to establish himself during the latter part of her residence in London. It would give him mortal offence, and without some very strong reason to allege in her justification, could not fail to excite the sur prise, and, very probably, the disapprobation of her father-in-law and Miss Caryll ; for to both nothing seemed more natural than that"], [249, "241 THE CARYLLS. such near connections should be in habits of the most familiar intercourse. And soon her position became still more embarrassing. By degrees Leycester threw off all reserve. He adopted a tenderer tone when they were alone together ; he was per petually reverting to the events of their life at Lynburn ; he gave her, rather obscurely indeed, to understand that his admiration of her now was at least as great as it had ever been ; he entreated her to look upon him as a devoted friend, upon whom she could securely count in any emergency, and expressed a hope that he still enjoyed a place in her regard. More than once Annie was sorely tempted to open her heart to him, and let him see that, so far from gaining in her good opinion, her dislike and distrust of him increased day by day ; that he was an object of aversion and contempt. For many reasons she shrank from taking so decided a step, which must have produced an irreparable breach with one whose vengeance she had reason to dread. VOL. III. M"], [250, "242 THE CARYLLS. How could she enter into the explanations which she would naturally be called upon to make ! How could she inflict so deep a wound on the kind old man beneath whose roof she was residing, by denouncing the unworthiness of one who had so lately been the husband of his daughter ! And how could she be sure that Leycester's plausible tongue might not refute her statement, and, by attributing it to vanity or misapprehension, cover her with ridicule and shame ! Moreover, there was one consideration paramount to all others \u2014 the dread of involving her husband in a quarrel \u2014 for he, at all events, would believe her, and espouse her cause. Once she told her persecutor, in answer to his protestations, that as long as her husband lived, she should require no other friend, and that it depended entirely on himself to pre serve the regard due to him as a brother-in law ; but in general she took refuge in silence, and made no reply whatsoever to his delicate insinuations. She sighed for the time when Walter would arrive to carry her off to Brighton, and in her impatience she would"], [251, "243 THE CARYLLS. have returned to London, if her house had been ready to receive her ; as it was, finding Leycester's demeanour more offensive every time they met, during the last few days of his stay at the Holt, she shut herself up in her room, pleading indisposition, which was partly feigned, and partly real. M 2"], [252, "244 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER XII. The fates seemed to conspire against Annie. Walter arrived at the Holt to her intense delight, but on the very next day her joy was not only damped, but utterly extin guished. A letter was received from Major Caryll, which, while it notified the birth of a son and heir, threw a gloom over the whole family by announcing the death of his brother in-law, Captain Marlowe. \" I need not tell you,\" he went on to say, \" that dear Fanny is overwhelmed with grief. Her husband died of cholera in two days, and she is left alone with her three young chil dren, and no relation near her. Unfortunately, my wife's confinement made it impossible for me to leave her ; but I am happy to say that she is going on so well, that to-morrow I 6tart for Agra, where Fanny is, and shall take her to Calcutta. She has found kind friends"], [253, "245 THE CARYLLS. around her, one of whom wrote to inform me of poor Marlowe's death, for she was unable to write herself. Before that event occurred, she had already made every preparation for returning to England with her children, and now she is naturally more anxious than ever to get away from scenes which have been so fatal to her happiness. She will start by the next mail-steamer, and as she will be quite alone with her children and native nurses, I trust Walter will contrive to meet her at Malta if possible, or, at least, at Marseilles, and escort her to England.\" This was the passage in Edward's letter which struck dismay into Annie's heart, for it was impossible for her husband to refuse compliance with the request contained in it, and equally impossible for her to accompany him, though her first exclamation had been, \" Walter, dear Walter, take me with you.\" She was not in a state of health for such a hurried journey ; but, putting that on one side, it would be most distressing to Mrs. Marlowe to find herself in the midst of her affliction forced into the society of a person"], [254, "246 THE CARYLLS. who was totally unknown to her ; all this Walter represented to her, and with a sigh she acquiesced in the justice of his observa tions, which were supported by Sir Edward, who expressed his decided disapprobation of the plan she proposed. Walter remained a week, and during this time Mr. Leycester, who had returned to Tuftons, and the Brentfords were almost daily visitors and dined twice at tbe Holt, Mrs. Caryll, strong in the protection of Walter's presence, emerging from her solitude to meet them. At length the hour of parting arrived, and a bitter hour it was to her. She clung to her husband with a passionate embrace, as if oppressed by the presentiment of coming evil, from which she could only find a refuge in his arms. He did his best to soothe her, but with indifferent success, and was at last obliged to tear himself from her almost by force. The pain of separation was greatly aggravated by the difficulty of their corres pondence, for, though Walter promised to write as often as circumstances would permit he hardly expected to remain long enough in"], [255, "THE CARYLLS. 247 any one place to be sure of receiving her letters in return. He fully intended going on to Malta, perhaps even to Alexandria, and he named Marseilles and Paris as the only places to which she could address her letters with the certainty of his finding them on his return journey. Having taken leave of all the inmates of the Holt, Walter started on his expedition. He slept that night in London, and then pro ceeded by way of Marseilles to Malta, which he reached the day before the steamer was expected from Alexandria. This of course put an end to all thoughts of Egypt, and at Malta he awaited his sister's arrival. In the meantime, things went on at the Holt much in their usual way. Mr. Leycester resumed his daily visits, and Annie no longer shunned him. She was fairly worn out by his perpetual obsession, and finding that no other means were likely to put an end to it, resolved to bring matters to a crisis. She would make one appeal to his generosity, and if that was unsuccessful, she made up her mind to break with him altogether, be the"], [256, "248 THE CARYLLS. consequences what they might. That they might be fatal to all her hopes of earthly happiness she did not conceal from herself, but even that would be easier to bear than to go on as she had been doing for tbe last two or three months, with the sword perpetually suspended over her head. She felt her mind giving way in the struggle, and more than once during a paroxysm of neuralgia, when mental agony was combined with agony of body, it seemed as if reason bad deserted her. It was time this should end. She had not long to wait for coming to the explanation she feared and desired. Mr. Leycester found her one morning on the point of starting on foot for Oakfield Chase, and offered himself as her escort. Before they had gone many hundred yards he began upon the old topic, but in more explicit language than he had ever used before. He told her that every day he felt more acutely the loss of her regard ; though it was a loss for which he knew he had no one to thank but himself; he entreated her to believe in his heart-felt repentance for the offence of which he had"], [257, "249 THE CARYLLS. been guilty towards her, and to bestow upon him some portion of her friendship and affec tion which she had once entertained for him. \" You loved me once,\" he said; \" loved me devotedly, and I cannot, I will not believe that your heart is now closed against me entirely and for ever. Do not drive me to despair by depriving me of all hope of rein stating myself in your good opinion.\" His eloquence and impassioned appeals were in vain. \" Mr. Leycester,\" she replied, \" if I have listened to you without inter rupting you, it is because I wish to come to a clear understanding with you. You ask me to believe in your repentance for the past ; how can I do so, when you persist in address ing me in language which, you well know, displeases and offends me? How can I extend to you my friendship, when every word you utter proves how completely you disregard my welfare and tranquillity ? And yet I would willingly call you my friend, if you would let me. Mr. Leycester, I appeal to your genero sity and humanity, to your feelings as a gen- m 5"], [258, "250 THE CARYLLS. tleman. Cease to persecute me. God knows I have not known much happiness yet ; leave me to enjoy that which may be in store for me. My fate is in a great measure in your hands. Have mercy on me now, as you hope for it hereafter.\" \" Oh, Annie, how can you reply so coldly to my prayer for forgiveness ! You ask me to have mercy on you ; have mercy upon me. Have some compassion for one who loves you now better and more passionately than he ever did before.\" \" Mr. Leycester, if you forget that I am married, I do not. I desire you will leave me now, and henceforward we meet as strangers.\" \" Married ! Do you dare to set up your marriage with that weak-headed fool in oppo sition to the ties that bind us? Or do you expect me to believe in such squeamish delicacy ? You forget, Mrs. Caryll. Far better be honest, and say you hate me. It will be a sort of compensation to that poor, dear, silly husband of yours, whom in public you profess to love and honour, and whom"], [259, "THE CARYLLS. 251 no doubt you laugh at in private. As to how we are to meet in future, I think I ought to have a voice in that.\" \"Yes, it is better to be honest,\" she ex claimed, anger and indignation getting the better of every other consideration. \" You are, and have long been the object of my aversion and contempt. I hate and despise you as heartily as I love and esteem my noble-hearted husband. You brought me nothing but misery and shame ; he has given me happiness and peace of mind. But it is time this conversation should cease ; it is our last. Should you compel me to it, I shall inform Sir Edward of the reasons which render it imperative on me to decline all further acquaintance with you.\" \" Have you anything further to add, Mrs. Caryll ?\" She turned from him, and walked on with out replying. \" Mrs. Caryll, I have the honour of wishing you good-morning ; but do not suppose that I have quite done with you yet. You may still be brought to the stool of repentance.\""], [260, "252 THE CARYLLS. As he uttered these words, he turned off in the direction of Tuftons. Annie continued her walk, and in another quarter of an hour found herself at Oakfield. She was satisfied with herself, and rejoiced in the thought that she had at last put an end for good and all to a state of things which had long been irksome to her, and sometimes a subject of self reproach. She had bravely stood up in defence of her husband, and she had silenced his reviler \u2014 she had not yet begun to count the cost at which her victory might have been obtained. Glowing with excitement and exercise she entered the morning room where Lady Brentford was sitting. \"My dear Annie,\" said her ladyship, \"I am delighted to see you. How are you feel ing to-day ? Though I need scarcely ask, for I never saw you looking better.\" \" Thank you, I am quite free from pain now. I had a sharpish attack yesterday evening, but, thanks to a few drops of morphia, I had an excellent night's rest, and have had no return.\" \" Are you right in having recourse to"], [261, "253 THE CARYLLS. morphia, Annie ? For heaven's sake be careful ; I have a horror of the very name.\" \" My dear Maud, I am right in having re course to anything that can alleviate the pain I suffer, and which at times drives me almost mad. I have tried every remedy, and morphia is that from which I derive most relief. As soon as Walter returns we shall go to the sea, and perhaps then I may be able to dispense with morphia and everything else.\" \" God grant it,'' Lady Brentford replied. \" I cannot tell you how it weighs upon us all to see you suffer as you do. Did you come alone?\" \" Mr. Leycester accompanied me part of the way, but when we came in sight of the bouse he turned off to Tuftons.\" \"He seems to be very busy there,\" ob served Maud, \" since he bought it. He says he means to sell Lynburn and establish him self here entirely. I confess I wonder at it, for it must be reminding him perpetually of dear Louisa ; but I suppose he finds a comfort in being in the midst of us, poor man.\""], [262, "254 THE CARYLLS. \"I suppose so,\" was Mrs. Caryll's reply, and then they passed to other subjects. Lady Brentford took her visitor back to the Holt after luncheon, and, at her own request, in the open carriage ; but whether it was owing to this act of imprudence, or to the mental excitement to which she had been subjected, her neuralgia returned in the evening, though in a rather more subdued form, and by fits and starts. She fought against it bravely, took part in the conversa- tion, which rolled principally upon Walter's journey and the probable duration of his absence, accepted Sir Edward's challenge to a game at piquet, and did not retire till he gave the signal for a general move. She rose next day after a feverish and restless night to find herself again the victim of pain ; nor was her mind more at ease. She now recalled with terror Leycester's last words, for she knew him too well to believe that they were intended only as an idle threat. How or when his vengeance would fall upon her she could not tell, and the uncertainty increased her uneasiness. She had truly said"], [263, "255 THE CARYLLS. that her fate lay in a great measure in his hands. She had offended him beyond all hope of pardon, and she placed but small reliance on his magnanimity. She pondered over all the means he had of molesting her till she was nearly in a state of distraction, and called upon death as her only refuge from ill to come. She was soon made acquainted with his intentions. She was too unwell to go down to breakfast, and when Miss Caryll came up to see how she was, her only reply was an entreaty to be left alone ; she was quite un equal to conversation then, but hoped to be able to make her appearance at dinner ; these attacks sometimes disappearing as suddenly as they came on. About an hour afterwards her maid brought her a letter from Mr. Leycester. \"My dear Annie,\" it began, \"after the manner of our parting yesterday, which I may fairly consider as an open declaration of war on your part, you will no doubt be sur prised at finding me propose terms of accom-"], [264, "256 THE CAEYLLS. modation, especially if you reflect upon your conduct towards me for the last three months. Your happiness, your good name, your posi tion in society are, as you well know, entirely in my power; and yet, during the whole of that time you have rejected my advances with contempt, and allowed no opportunity to es cape of wounding my feelings, and setting me at defiance. The insulting expressions with which you closed our last interview would justify me in striking without further warn ing; but I am of a placable disposition, and before having recourse to steps which must necessarily involve your utter ruin, I will give you yet another chance \u2014 the last. To-mor row, at twelve o'clock, I shall be at the Holt, and ask to see you, when I will inform you of the conditions upon which you may obtain my forgiveness for the past, and my silence for the future. Should you refuse to see me, or accept my terms, I swear to you that, by that day's post, I will write to your husband, and give him a full and detailed account ot our connection. I will tell him that, when you were barely seventeen, you allowed a"], [265, "257 THE CARYLLS. scamp of a shoemaker, who called himself a dissenting minister, to read the marriage service over us in his own room, without wit nesses, or any other legal formality, although, as the daughter of a clergyman, you could not plead ignorance of their necessity. In fact, you knew that the whole business was invalid, and a farce from beginning to end, notwith standing which you lived with me for many months as my wife, or rather as my mistress. I will tell him that, under pretence of visiting your old schoolmistress, and nursing her in her last illness, you obtained permission from your parents to go down to London, where you were confined, and became the mother of my illegitimate child. I will even tell him, in case he should be curious in such matters, in what cemetery he can find the child's grave. And to prevent the possibility of doubt, I will send him a few of your own letters. It will be of no use for you to allege that, on your return from London, you refused to live with me till we were legally married ; that will not prevent Mr. Walter Caryll's wife from having been my mistress. I should rather"], [266, "258 THE CARYLLS. like to see his face when he makes the dis covery. But I talk idly ; you will not be mad enough to allow it to come to that. These are the alternatives ; on one side a happy and comfortable home, the respect of the world, and the affection of the family of which you are now a member ; on the other, shame and disgrace, the contempt of all who know you, a life passed in solitude and misery, dependent for the means of existence on the charity of the man you have wronged and deceived. To decide between the two can hardly require a second thought ; but, remem ber, your decision once made is irrevocable. \u2014J. L.\" She knew the worst now, but for a time it seemed as if she was unable to realise the fate with which she was threatened. The letter dropped on to the floor, and she sat with her hands pressed to her brow, striving in vain to collect her scattered thoughts. Then she flung herself upon her knees, and caUed upon God to aid her in this her utmost need. After a while she rose up, and began"], [267, "259 THE CARYLLS. pacing round the room with hurried steps, her mental agony making her insensible to bodily pain. This exercise she continued for upwards of an hour, when she again threw herself upon her sofa, exhausted in body, and with her ideas still in confusion. Never for a moment did she entertain a thought of entering into any composition with her per secutor, or placing herself still further in his power ; she knew too well to what that would inevitably lead. But at the same time it never occurred to her to doubt that he would put his threat in execution. She saw herself driven with ignominy from the home which now sheltered her, without a friend to comfort or advise her, without a roof beneath which she could lay her head. Whither could she fly ; what refuge could she seek before her shame was made public ? One resource there was ; and to her disordered imagination one only. A knock came at the door. She caught up the letter, and thrust it into her pocket before she said, \"Come in.\" \" How are you, Annie ?\" said Miss Caryll. \" Will you come down to luncheon ?\""], [268, "260 THE CARYLLS. \" I think I am a little better, and will try.\" \"They told me Mr. Leycester had written to you. Does he say anything about coming here ?\" \" Yes, it was to tell me he should be here to-morrow. I suppose he thought I might be going to the Chase again.\" She got through the luncheon with toler able composure, and then again retreated to her own room. Here she wrote a letter to her husband addressed to him at Paris, and a short note to Mr. Leycester. She then put on her bonnet, and took them herself to the Post Office in the village. Her exit had been unnoticed, but on her return she met Sir Edward in the hall. \" My dear Annie, how imprudent !\" he said. \" I thought a short walk would do me good, and I am not the worse for it. Every thing seems to do me good and harm by turns.\" She came down to dinner, and was toler ably cheerful and composed, but they had"], [269, "THE CARYLLS. 261 hardly returned to the drawing-room, when she was seized with a more violent paroxysm than she had yet experienced. For a while she struggled against it, though hardly able to hold up her head or restrain her moans, but, as soon as tea was over, she declared she could bear it no longer, but must go to her own room, where perhaps morphia might obtain for her a little rest. She embraced Caroline and wished her good-night, and then turned to Sir Edward. \" My love,\" he said, kissing her tenderly, \" if this continues after trying Brighton, you must see what a milder climate will do for you. If Walter cannot go with you, Caro line and I will take you to tbe South of France.\" Such a proof of affectionate interest on the part of one, who for the last twenty years had never quitted his home without reluc tance, moved Annie to tears.

Mr. Leycester was seated at his breakfast table on the morning following the dispatch of his ultimatum to Mrs. Caryll, when the butler brought in the letter-bag. He pro ceeded to open it leisurely, for he was never in a hurry, and soon found Annie's note, which happened to be the only missive it con tained. Before he opened it he perceived the servant lingering in the room. \"What are you waiting for?\" he said, sharply. 11 If you please, sir, the postman says that the servants at the Holt told him that Mrs. Caryll is dead.\" \" Dead !\" exclaimed Leycester, letting the bag fall. \" Impossible ! What was to kill her ?\" \" They did not seem exactly to know, sir, if it was the medicine she was taking for the"], [271, "263 THE CAEYLLS. pain in her face, or if it was the disease itself. The doctor drove up just as he came away.\" \"I cannot believe it. Order my horse directly.\" The man left the room, and Leycester tore open Annie's note. It contained only these words \u2014 \" I have decided. God will judge betwixt you and me. \u2014 Annie.\" He rushed from the house to the stables bareheaded, tearing up the note into the most minute fragments as he went. They were in the act of leading out his horse ; a servant ran after him with his hat, and fling ing himself into the saddle without speaking a word, he galloped off to the Holt. Leaving his horse to take care of itself, which it did by proceeding to the stable, he entered the house. The first person he saw was the medical man who had been sent for. \"Sad business, Mr. Leycester,\" said that learned gentleman. * Good God ! Is it then true what I have this moment heard, that Mrs. Walter Caryll is dead?\" \" Too true, and I grieve to say through hei"], [272, "264 THE CAEYLLS. own imprudence. It appears that for some days past she has been suffering excruciating pain, to alleviate which she has been in the habit of having recourse to morphia, and last night she took an overdose. I had cautioned her on the subject more than u once. \"Have you seen Sir Edward and Miss Caryll ?\" \" Yes. They are both in the greatest affliction, but it is Mr. Walter who is most to be pitied; they were so much attached to each other. And then there must necessarily be an inquest. Altogether it is the most dis tressing event I ever recollect.\" \" Shall you see Sir Edward again ?'' \" I am going to him now, to settle about writing to the coroner.\" \" Then pray tell him that as soon as the melancholy intelligence reached me, I came over to enquire for him and his daughter, but I will not intrude on them at present. If they think I can be of any use, they will send for me.\" He again mounted his truant steed, which"], [273, "THE CARYLLS. 265 the coachman had brought back to the hall door, and rode back slowly, buried in thought. He had not gone far when he met the Brent fords coming towards the Holt at a rapid pace in the phaeton . Lord Brentford was driving, and Maud leaning back in the car riage, with her handkerchief up to her eyes. At sight of Leycester, Lord Brentford pulled up. \" Is it true ?\" he cried. \" Quite true,\" was the reply. \" But, for God's sake, ask me nothing ; I cannot bear it.\" And he rode on. \" How I have misjudged that man !\" said Lord Brentford, as he drove on. \" I once thought him heartless, but no one has warmer feelings.\" The inquest took place, but merely as a matter of form. The circumstances of the case, the affection which united all the mem bers of the Caryll family, the sufferings with which poor Annie Caryll had been for some time afflicted, and the means she had taken vol- in. N"], [274, "266 THE CARYLLS. to suppress them, were too well known to make much investigation necessary. The evidence of the medical man was clear and distinct, and a verdict was returned to the effect, that Ann Caryll died in consequence of too strong a dose of morphia, incautiously administered by herself. On the following day she was laid in the vaults of the Carylls. During the short time that elapsed between Mrs. Caryll's death and the inquest Mr. Ley cester never once made his appearance at the Holt, neither did he attend the funeral. He kept himself entirely secluded at Tuftons, refusing to see any of his friends, even Lord Brentford, on plea of serious indisposition. Meantime Walter's return had been de layed much longer than he had expected- The steamer arrived from Alexandria, but, instead of Mrs. Marlowe, brought a few lines from Major Caryll addressed to his brother at Malta, on the chance that it might find him waiting there, to inform him that, on account of the illness of one of her children, his sister had made up her mind to postpone her voyage till the departure of the following"], [275, "THE CARYLLS. 267 steamer. Inconsequence, Walter determined to proceed to Egypt, and await her arrival at Cairo. This project he carried out, writing to his wife to say that his movements would now be so uncertain and hurried that the only sure address he could give her was his banker's at Paris, where they would certainly sleep and probably pass four-and-twenty hours. He had plenty of time to devote to the Sphinx and the Pyramids before Mrs. Marlowe's arrival, which did not take place till ten days after his own. It was seven years since he had last seen her, which was on the occasion of her mar riage, and what changes had taken place in the interval! He recognized her at once; but it was hardly to be wondered at, if she felt a good deal surprised and somewhat dis mayed, when she found herself suddenly en circled by the arms of a stranger standing six feet one, and rejoicing in a very creditable pair of mustachios. \" Fanny, dear Fanny, do you not know me?\" said Walter. N 2"], [276, "268 THE CARYLLS. \" My dear Walter, is it possible this can be you?\" she replied, recalling something in his voice and manner which seemed familiar to her. \" I hope so, unless somebody has changed me for another. But come, my dragoman will look after your luggage and servants, and bring them safe to the hotel, where I have secured a capital apartment for you. Are these my nephew and nieces ? Let me carry one of them through the crowd?\" Much they had to talk over, and some of it of a most painful nature; John and Louisa lost to them, Captain Marlowe's sudden death. But on the subject of her own affliction Fanny did not dwell much ; she still felt it too deeply to make it a subject of conversation, even to a brother, but she was one of those to whom religion was something more than a name. She had been sorely tried, but she had also been wonderfully supported. \"For seven years,\" she said, \" I enjoyed happiness such as falls to the lot of few, and I must not murmur now, for I have still many blessings left. I cannot tell you, dear Walter, what"], [277, "THE CARYLLS. 269 pleasure it gives me to find myself under the protection of one of my own family. How good in you to come so far for me; how good in Annie to spare you for so long.\" \" Half the merit at least ought to go to Edward, who suggested it,\" Walter replied. \" Of course I was delighted to be of use, and Annie never thinks of self.\" \" Tell me all about her ?\" \" Not a word ; you must find it out for yourself. But if you do not learn to love her, you will stand alone.\" The next day they continued their home ward journey. Mrs. Marlowe's intention was, on arriving in London, to go for a few days to the Shorehams, then pass a couple of months at the Holt, and finally to take up her residence with a wealthy uncle of her hus band's, who had long since invited her to make, his house her home, whenever she re turned to England. This was the more expe dient, as Captain Marlowe had been his heir, a claim which now devolved upon his son. At Marseilles Walter found a couple of letters from his wife, written in cheerful Ian-"], [278, "270 THE CARYLLS. guage, and making light of her ailments. He arrived in Paris unconscious of the recent events at the Holt, which so nearly affected his happiness, and looking forward with im patience to the time when he should again set foot in his own home. They reached Paris late in the evening, and on the following morning he went to his banker's, where a bundle of letters was put into his hands, with which he returned to his hotel. Mrs. Marlowe was with her children, and he retired to his own room to read them. The first he opened was from his wife ; it was dated ten days before, and contained a bulky enclosure. \" Walter,\" it began, \" it is true, all true. I did allow a dissenting minister to marry me to Mr. Leycester, although I knew it was no marriage, and trusted to his promise to make me hie wife as soon as he was his own master. I did live with him, as he says, for many months. I was the mother of his child. Would to God I were now lying beside it ! I confess all this to you, because, long before you receive this letter, I shall be where your anger and"], [279, "271 THE CARYLLS. contempt cannot reach me. But, Walter, dear Walter, though I deceived you by my silence, believe me that, since I have been your wife, I have never swerved from my duty to you in thought, word, or deed ; I have loved you with my whole heart and soul. I have prayed, prayed so hard for protection and assistance, but God would not hear me. How could He listen to such a wretch as I am ! I have no one to trust to but myself; no refuge but the grave. I could bear the reproaches of my friends, the sneers and reprobation of the world, but to be an outcast from your love, the object of your hatred and contempt I cannot bear. Farewell, dear Walter, farewell for ever- To you I owe every hour of happi ness I have ever known since I was a child. Do not curse me ; do not curse my memory. Annie.\" It seemed to Walter as if he had been read ing something written in an unknown tongue. Mechanically he took up the enclosure, which was Leycester's last letter to Mrs. Caryll. That explained all. One convulsive sob escaped from his breast, and then with fierce"], [280, "272 THE CARYLLS. impatience he tore open letters from his father and sisters, from Lord Brentford, and even from Shoreham, giving every detail of all that had happened, from the first discovery of Annie's lifeless body, to the funeral, which had taken place two days before ; coupled with those well-meant expressions of sympathy and exhortations to resignation, which may soothe the feelings of the slightly afflicted, but are of no avail for those who stand most in need of consolation. When he had finished he remained for some minutes in a state of stupor, all the powers of his mind paralysed by what he had just read. As soon as he awoke from his trance, thoughts of the most varied and painful nature rushed through his brain in rapid succession. For a moment they dwelt upon his own misery and the desolate existence on which he was now entering. Then they reverted to the wife he had lost ; the wife he had so dearly loved ; and imagination pictured to him the agonies of despair through which she must have passed, before she could have been tempted to the commission of such a deed. An"], [281, "THE CARYLLS. 273 immense feeling of compassion filled his soul without the slightest admixture of resentment for her fault, or the tacit deception she had practised on him ; whatever her failings may have been, death had cancelled them all. If, when a girl, little more than a child, she had fallen a victim to the practised arts of a profli gate scoundrel, her weakness had been quickly followed by repentance, and she had refused to renew the connection. That she had been a faithful wife, that since her marriage her husband had been the sole object of her devoted love he felt assured ; there was no need of her declaration to convince him of that ; she had sealed her truth with her life. And then he recalled the circumstances of their marriage ; how she had been surprised, almost forced into a hasty acceptance of his hand. Had more time been allowed her, very probably she would have revealed all the events of her early life. Once married he understood that such a confession was most difficult, if not impossible. But why, why, when she found exposure inevitable, had she N 5"], [282, "274 THE CARYLLS. not tried an appeal to his affection ! It would not have been made in vain. But it was too late now to think of what might have been. But if, when thinking of the wife who was lost to him for ever, he gave full scope to the tenderness and generosity of his nature, far different was it when bis thoughts reverted to him, whom he justly considered as Annie's murderer and the destroyer of his own happi ness. Then it seemed as if every trace of human feeling had been seared out of his heart, to be replaced by deadly hatred and a burning desire for revenge. \" Ah, Mr. Leycester,\" be muttered to him self, \" you would like to see how I look on discovering your villany ; I will endeavour to gratify you before long.\" He locked up Annie's letter and that of her persecutor in his desk, and taking the others in his hand went in search of his sister, with a look of fierce determination on his brow and ten years added to his age. \" Good heavens ! Walter !\" she exclaimed, as he entered the room in which she was sitting, \" what has happened ?\""], [283, "THE CARYLLS. 275 \" Fanny,\" he replied, \" my wife is dead. Silence, not a word,\" he continued, as he saw her opening her lips to speak. \" Read these letters ; they will tell you all I know myself.\" She sunk back on the sofa as he put the letters into her hand. \" Dear Fanny, I have startled you ; for give me, for I hardly know what I am about, and I have so much to think of, so much to arrange. Do you think you could manage to leave Paris this afternoon ? We would sleep at Boulogne, cross early, and be in London before twelve to-morrow. I will telegraph to Shoreham to meet you at the station; I want to get home. Ah, my God !\" he ex claimed, giving way to tears for the first time, \" I have no home now.\" Mrs. Marlowe made no attempt at conso lation, but she threw her arms round his neck, and the kiss she gave him spoke more forcibly than words. \" Dearest brother,\" she said, \" we will start when you like. You will find me and the children quite ready.\" \" That will be a real kindness ; and if you"], [284, "276 THE CARYLLS. love me you will make no allusion to what has happened at the Holt.\" He went out, and after dispatching a telegram to Shoreham, returned to expedite the preparations. They were completed in time to allow of the party leaving Paris at four o'clock. As Walter had arranged, they slept at Boulogne, and reached the Victoria Station soon after eleven, during the whole of which time he bad not opened his lips save to give the necessary directions, and to swallow enough to keep body and soul to gether. They found Shoreham in waiting. \" God bless you, dear Walter,\" he said, squeezing his brother-in-law's hand. \" Lucy sends you her most affectionate love.\" \" Thanks to you and to her. Will you take charge of Fanny now ? I am anxious to get to the Holt as soon as I can.\" Shoreham turned to Mrs. Marlowe, to whom he had not yet spoken, and greeted her warmly. \" Good-bye, Fanny,\" said Walter ; \" I leave you in good hands.\" He then kissed her and the children, and"], [285, "277 THE CARYLLS. jumping into a cab, was soon on the way to Euston Square. In another hour he was fly ing homewards by the express train. At the station nearest to Tuftons he got out, and leaving his luggage till his return, started on foot for Mr. Leycester's. It was already dusk, and, seeing a light in the drawing-room which looked into the garden, he opened the garden gate and walked straight up to it without going to the house door. As he approached, he could see Mr. Leycester seated at a table, resting his head upon both hands, as if buried in thought. Walter walked in through the open window, and as he entered, Mr. Leycester looked up. \" Walter\u2014 Mr. Caryll ! What brings you here at this hour?\" he exclaimed. \"Read this,\" said Walter, coming up to the table, and laying Annie's letter before him ; \" read this, and tell me what answer you have to make to it.\" Leycester read it very slowly, shading his face with his hand. \" I have no answer to make to the ravings"], [286, "278 THE CARYLLS. of a mad woman,\" he replied, pushing the paper from him. \" Mad ! Yes, she was mad, but who made her so ? And are these the ravings of a mad man ?\" rejoined Walter, producing Leyces ter's letter. \" I will not enter into any discussion with you on the subject,\" said Leycester ; \" and as I am not well enough to receive visitors, I must beg you to leave the house.\" \" Do not be afraid ; I shall not detain you long. John Leycester, you are the cause of my wife's death \u2014 her murderer ! You know the law : a life for a life, and it is my intention to take yours if I can. My business here this evening is to make you name a place and hour for meeting me to-morrow.\" \" And I refuse to meet you either to-mor row, or at any other time.\" \" Cowardly villain ! I expected this ; but you shall not escape me thus. Go where you will I will follow you like your shadow, and cover you with infamy and disgrace ; I will dog you through the world till I make you"], [287, "279 THE CARYLLS. weary of your existence, and drive you to end it as you drove my darling to end hers. And as words seem ineffectual to move you, to words I will add blows, wherever I meet you. As an earnest of my intentions, take this !\" and he struck Leycester violently on the face with his hat. \" Ah, ruffian 1\" exclaimed the latter, start ing up, \" this is too much. Do not suppose that it was from affection to you that I refused to fight you. It was a very different con sideration that restrained me. For I hate you. I never liked you ; and since your marriage I have hated you. When and where shall it be ?\" \" Nay, Mr. Leycester, that I leave to you,\" said Walter, resuming his composure, and with it his good breeding, now that he had attained his object. \" The sooner the better then,\" Leycester replied, also ealming down. \"It is too dark now ; will six o'clock to-morrow morning suit you ?\" \" Perfectly ; and where ?\" \" Well, I would suggest Shotley Wood,"], [288, "280 THE CARYLLS. which is about an equal distance from Tuf tons and the Holt. There is a nice open glade in it just suited for our purpose, and the wood is so large that we are not likely to be disturbed. I presume you agree with me that we shall not require seconds?\" \" Quite so ; and as I have no pistols, per haps you will have the goodness to bring yours r \" Certainly. Would you like to look at them?\" \" Thank you, I know them, and have had them in my hand before now. It is under stood then ; Shotley Wood at six o'clock to morrow morning. Will it be light enough at that hour?\" \" Yes ; enough for us.\" \" Very well. I will not intrude on you any longer, and have the honour of wishing you good-evening.\" Walter returned to the station, recovered his luggage, and proceeded in a fly to the Holt. It was past nine when he reached it, and his arrival was quite unexpected. He found his father and Caroline in the study,"], [289, "281 THE CARYLLS. where they were much in the habit of sitting when quite alone. \" Walter !\" exclaimed his sister, starting up to meet him ; but he just kissed her, and went straight up to Sir Edward. \"Father,\" he said, kneeling down, \"give me your blessing \u2014 I need it.\" \" God bless and comfort you, my dear, dear son!\" said Sir Edward, laying his hand on Walter's head. '' We did not even know you were in Eng land,\" said Miss Caryll, when he turned to her. \" When did you arrive, and how is Fanny ?\" \" We arrived this morning. Fanny is gone to the Shorehams, and is quite well in bodily health; so are the children. But we will talk more about them to-morrow ; now my mind is occupied with other things. Father, will you give me the key of the vault \u2014 I want to go there ?\" Sir Edward looked at him anxiously. \" My dear Walter, you had better put that off till to-morrow.\" \" No, father ; to-night I entreat of you.\""], [290, "282 THE CARYLLS. \" At least, you must eat something first. It is easy to see you are quite worn out and exhausted. Caroline, ring for some supper.\" This proposal was not rejected by Walter, who had taken nothing but a cup of tea since landing at Folkestone ; but when the cold chicken was brought in, he could not swallow a mouthful. He drank a glass of wine, and then, having received the key from his father, with a stable lantern in his hand, proceeded to the vault of the Carylls in the parish church. The entrance to it lay through a small porch on the outside of the church. Descend ing a few steps, he found himself in a crypt extending nearly the whole length of the church, with niches on both sides which were entirely filled. For a moment Walter paused to contemplate the numerous coffins with their faded palls, containing the mouldering remains of so many of his race ; then passing onwards, he opened a door which led into a new vault or mausoleum, which had been constructed by his father, and which, as yet, only contained the bodies of his mother,"], [291, "283 THE CARYLLS. brother, sister, and wife ; in which, in all probability, he, too, would one day find a resting-place. He had no difficulty in distinguishing the spot in which lay the remains of Annie Caryll. The others were all marked by a tablet let into the wall above, but for hers alone there had not yet been time. He flung himself on his knees before her coffin, and passed some time in silent prayer. Then he rose and began restlessly pacing up and down, buried in deep and solemn meditation. In this exercise hours passed away, till the church clock striking the hour of two warned him that it was time to depart. What were the thoughts which filled his mind who shall say ? Perhaps he reflected that in a few hours more he might be as she was then, or it might be a fugitive flying for his life after slaying their common enemy. Perhaps he dwelt upon the fresh sorrow he was about to inflict upon his family. But whatever his thoughts may have been, that they were not exclusively of a religious nature may be inferred from his last words as he left the vault. \" Ah Annie,\" he"], [292, "284 THE CARYLLS. said aloud, \" if I could not protect you living, at least I will avenge you dead.\" As soon as he again found himself in his own room he sat down, and, in case the duel should prove fatal to him, wrote a long letter to his father in justification of his conduct. He told him that Mr. Leycester, during his absence, had endeavoured to seduce his wife, and that Annie, deprived of her husband's protection, unwilling to be the cause of family dissensions by appealing to her father-in-law, and with her reason already shaken by the agonies of neuralgia, had taken refuge in death. This letter he locked up in his desk, which in case of a fatal result would naturally be opened by his father. When this was finished and he had dressed himself, it was time for him to set out on his expedition. He arrived at the appointed spot a few minutes before six, but as yet Mr. Leycester had not appeared. For upwards of an hour Walter waited for him, pacing up and down, when at length his patience was exhausted, and he determined to seek out his adversary at his own dwelling. On his way he met"], [293, "THE CAEYLLS. 285 Leycester's groom riding towards him at a furious pace. On seeing Walter he pulled up. \" Oh, Mr. Caryll,\" he exclaimed, \" my poor master has shot himself. I am going for the doctor, though it is no use ; he is quite dead.\" Walter staggered back as if he had received a blow. He would have asked further ques tions, but the man said he must proceed on his errand. After a moment's reflection Walter hurried forward to Tuftons. The first person he saw was Lord Brentford, who had been sent for as soon as his brother in-law's death was discovered. \" My dear Walter,\" he exclaimed, \" how dreadful, how shocking ! Just when we were beginning to find out his worth. But how do you come here?\" \" I arrived last night, and as I could not sleep I came out for a walk. I met the groom, and what he told me sent me here. When did it happen ?\" \" No one knows ; no one heard the report of the pistol. When the housemaid entered the drawing-room this morning, he was lying"], [294, "286 THE CAEYLLS. dead on the floor with his head shattered. The window was open, and at first they thought he might have been murdered, but they found his own pistol in his hand, and his keys in the lock of his pistol-case. And besides this a paper on tbe table, in his own handwriting, with these words \u2014 'Of all whom I have offended or injured I ask forgiveness, especially of one whom I was to have met to-morrow.' Who can that be?\" Walter did what he had not done when he learnt his wife's death. He burst into tears; his feelings were strung so high that they could bear no more. \" My poor, dear Walter,\" said his brother in-law, \" after all you have gone through yourself this is too much for you. Take my horse, which is in the stables, and go home. I shall remain to see the doctor. Y\"ou will find Maud at the Holt. She has gone to break it to her father.\" Caryll took his advice, glad to be once more alone. He felt that death is a powerful agent in softening the bitterest and most legi timate enmities ; he would not presume to sit"], [295, "287 THE CAEYLLS. in judgment on one who had implored his forgiveness, and on whom a sentence of con demnation or acquittal had already been pro nounced by the Judge of all; perhaps, he rejoiced at having been spared the commission of what, in the eyes of most, would have been an act of but doubtful justiee. He found all at the Holt dreadfully affected by this fresh calamity. \" Good God !\" Sir Edward had exclaimed when first informed of it. \" When will these horrors cease ?\" He might well feel appalled. Death had indeed been busy in his family during the last twelvemonth. The cause of Mr. Leycester's death was too clear to admit of doubt. All the witnesses who were examined were unanimous in de claring that he had never recovered from the effect produced by the death of his wife, and that his depression had been greatly increased by that of his sister-in-law. A verdict of \" Died by his own hand in a moment of temporary insanity \" was returned, and by in structions contained in his will he was buried at Lynburn. By that document, which was"], [296, "288 THE CARYLLS. dated two days after the death of Mrs. Walter Caryll, he left Tuftons and everything of which he could dispose, amounting to a little more than four thousand a year, to Lady Mary Caryll. The rest of his property, in accord ance with family settlements of long standing, was divided between his nearest of kin, amongst whom his cousin Beatrice Leycester ultimately received thirty thousand pounds as her share. Lord Brentford attended his funeral, but Walter was spared the pain of accepting or refusing his proposal to accompany him. For two days after Leycester's death he had com plained of severe indisposition, which ended in brain-fever of the most alarming descrip tion. For some days he hovered between life and death, and it seemed as if the family vault would again be opened to receive a fresh tenant. Youth, however, and a <rood constitution, aided by the unremitting atten tion of those around him, carried him throuo-b. But his recovery was slow, and the physician who attended him said that fora length of time he would be unable to attend to his official"], [297, "289 THE CARYLLS. duties, and strongly recommended an entire change of scene, as the most effectual means of regaining health and strength. With the concurrence of his father, be resigned his ap pointment, gave up the house in St. John's Wood, and embarked for America. It was just at the commencement of the civil war in that country, and joining the Confederates as a volunteer he went through the first cam paign in their unsuccessful struggle for inde pendence. The next that was heard of him was that he had proceeded to India, where he intended to remain with his brother Edward and Lady Mary till they returned to England. This plan he carried out, and it was not till the summer of the third year of his expatria tion that he again set foot on European soil. VOL. III. 0"], [298, "290 THE CARYLLS. CHAPTER XIV. It was late in the month of August of the year that witnessed Walter Caryll's return from India that two English ladies, with their maid and courier, arrived at the Baths of Y in the Tirol, one of those few and highly favoured spots which have hitherto escaped the research of the general traveller. They were travelling by that old-fashioned mode of conveyance, the vetturino, and, having started at an early hour, reached Y in ample time for the table dhdte dinner at one o'clock. As they drove up to the neat looking inn by the road-side, the youngest of the two ladies, our old friend Beatrice Leycester, who somewhat to her own astonishment had wandered thus far in foreign climes, exclaimed \u2014 \" Oh, Brownie, what a lovely spot ! Do let us pass a day or two here.\""], [299, "291 THE CARYLLS. Miss Browne very readily gave her assent, and Antonio, the courier, was instructed to negotiate the business with the vetturino, who naturally offered no objections to a plan which gave himself and his horses a holiday. Miss Leycester and her friend at once in stalled themselves in an apartment which was clean and comfortable, and commanded a lovely view. The next operation was to in scribe their names, nation, and occupation in the traveller's book, which was brought to their sitting-room for that purpose. As soon as Miss Brown had accomplished this, her com panion took up the book to see who the present inmates of the hotel might be, but she had hardly cast her eyes on it when she uttered an exclamation of surprise \u2014 \" Brownie, who do you think is here ? Walter Caryll !\" \" Mr. Caryll ! I thought he had gone with his brother to England.\" \" No ; they parted at Malta. Mary wrote me word that he had promised to be at the Holt at Christmas, but meant to wander o 2"], [300, "292 THE CARYLLS. homewards through Italy, Switzerland, and Germany. Fancy our lighting upon him at this out of the way place. I must know if he is in the house now.\" She rang the bell, and, in answer to her enquiries, she was informed by the Italian waiter that Milordo Carilli had gone away on some expedition three days before, but was expected back that afternoon. \" As soon as he returns,\" she said, \" be sure to tell him that some old friends of his are here, and wish to see him.\" With the exception of themselves, and two German families, who were there for the sake of the baths, there were no strangers at the table d'hote. The rest of the guests consisted of some of the principal inhabitants of the village, amongst whom was a Dr. Haller, who had passed the best part of his life as army surgeon in the Austrian service, and had now retired to bis native place, where he enjoyed an immense reputation for profes sional skill. He was an open-hearted, jovial old man, speaking several languages, and full of anecdote, of which he was rather prodigal"], [301, "THE CARYLLS. 293 in conversation. Beatrice, who was seated next him, speedily took him into favour, and invited him to take his coffee in her room after dinner ; she was always for cultivating agreeable acquaintance. They were still engaged in that pleasing occupation, and the doctor, at Beatrice's in stigation, had just lighted his meerschaum, when the waiter burst into the room with a look of dismay. \" Ah, signora,\" he said, \" Milordo has met with a terrible accident. His foot slipped at the top of the hill behind the village, and he has fallen into the ravine some hundred feet deep. The guide is just come for ropes and assistance, but he must be killed.\" Miss Leycester turned deadly pale, but the urgency of the case enabled her to master her emotion. \" Send our courier to me directly,\" was all she said. That functionary soon made his appear- ance. \" Antonio, you have heard what has hap pened. Tell the guide to take as many men"], [302, "294 THE CARYLLS. as he thinks necessary ; to spare no expense, and as soon as he is ready to start, let me know. I shall go with him myself, and you will accompany me.\" Antonio bowed and departed. Then she turned to her companions. \" Brownie,\" she said, \" see that his room is ready to receive him; and, Dr. Haller, will you remain till our return? We shall want your assistance.\" \" Willingly, my dear lady. I will just step to my house to take whatever I think may be of use, and come back immediately. I would offer to go with you, but I could never climb up that steep mountain. Are you a good mountaineer yourself? It will try you.\" But of her walking powers Beatrice had no fears, aud so she told him. \"Good!\" he replied. \" Make them take a blanket with them to bring him back in ; and do not attach too much importance to what that silly fellow said. People of that class think every accident must end in death.\""], [303, "THE CARYLLS. 295 They were soon on their way to the scene of the accident. The doctor had not exag gerated the difficulties of the ascent ; but Beatrice, refusing the assistance offered her, struggled on in the front rank, to the admira tion of her companions. Half way up the mountain a niche was cut in the rock, con taining an image of the Blessed Virgin and her Son, with a small lamp burning before it. Reverently uncovering, they all knelt down, and said a \" Hail Mary,\" Beatrice fol lowing their example, and praying with equal fervour, though in other words. At length the fatal spot was reached, and preparations were instantly made for lower ing Walter's guide and a man whom he care fully selected as his companion. In another minute they were over the edge of the preci pice and out of sight. Beatrice threw herself on her knees and awaited the result with her heart beating almost to bursting. But though to her it seemed an age, she was not kept many minutes in suspense. Long before they could have reached the bottom, a hail was heard, followed by some communication in a"], [304, "296 THE CARYLLS. patois that to her was unintelligible, but which was translated to her by Antonio. They had found Caryll lying insensible on a ledge of rock not much more than a hundred feet from the brink, his further descent hav ing been arrested by some shrubs into which he had fallen. A couple of spare ropes were fastened round him with great care, upon which, as soon as the signal was given, the men above began to haul. The guide and his companion, by the aid of their ropes and their staffs, contrived to scramble up the pre cipice, which was not quite perpendicular, on each side of him, to prevent his receiving any additional injury from the projecting fragments of rock which lay in the way of his ascent. At length they all three reached the top in safety. \" He lives,\" said the guide, laying bis hand on Walter's breast. \" I feel the beat ing of his heart.\" It was with great difficulty that Miss Leycester could check a burst of tears, but a deep-drawn sigh gave her relief, while a heart felt \" thank God,\" which burst from her lips, spoke her gratitude."], [305, "297 THE CARYLLS. There was still much to do, and as the whole party seemed to look to her for instruction, she soon roused herself to exertion. Under her superintendence Walter was laid on the blanket with the utmost care and gentleness, and they began their homeward journey. He was still insensible, his forehead was discoloured by an extensive bruise, indicating that in his fall his head must have come in contact with the rock, and one of his arms hung helplessly by his side, as if it had received some serious injury. As Beatrice walked by his side, she had full leisure to contemplate the chaage in his appearance since she had last seen him, and she felt that if she had met him suddenly she would have had some difficulty in recog nizing him. His hollow cheeks and sunken features told of long-continued mental suffer ing ; the lower part of his face was covered by a long, thick beard ; his figure, shrunk to half its former size, made him look even taller than he really was ; and his hair had already assumed a grizzly appearance. As the cool mountain breeze played upon his forehead, an o 5"], [306, "298 THE CARYLLS. occasional low moan announced that he was roused so far as to be conscious of pain. His bearers hurried on as fast as the difficulties of the way permitted, and in less than two hours from the time of their departure they again reached the hotel. Dr. Haller met them in the passage, and under his auspices the sufferer was carried upstairs and laid in the bed which had been prepared for him. The guide and peasants were dismissed with a remuneration far exceeding their wildest hopes, the room was cleared of all but Antonio, who was directed to remain in case his assistance might be required, and the doctor began his examina tion, promising to make his report as soon as it was concluded. It was nearly an hour before he made his appearance in Miss Leycester's sitting-room. \" My dear lady,\" he said, \" I think you may put your mind quite at ease. As far as I can see, your countryman's life is in no danger. He has received a violent blow on his head, which has produced a slight concussion of the brain, and the left arm is fractured above the elbow. That I have succeeded in setting,"], [307, "THE CARYLLS. 299 though it was rather a troublesome job, and if he is kept quite quiet, and takes some draughts I shall send him, I have no doubt that in the course of a few hours he will be restored to consciousness. But you must pro vide some one to sit up with him.\" That had already been arranged. Miss Leycester's maid, Martha Bolton by name, a staid and demure damsel, who had witnessed the entrance of her present mistress into the world, had volunteered to take the night watch beside the sick bed of Mr. Walter Caryll, for whom, indeed, she had always had a sort of sneaking kindness. She entered upon her functions at once, and soon had the plea sure of hearing him breathe more gently, and, under the influence of the doctor's draughts, saw him sink into a tolerably quiet slumber. With the first rays of light he opened his eyes, looked first upon his bandaged arm, and then on his nurse. \" Who are you ? \" he asked, in a faint voice. \" Hush, Mr. Walter,\" Martha replied. \"You had a bad fall yesterday, and hurt your head and your arm, and you are not to talk till the"], [308, "300 THE CARYLLS. doctor comes again. And now let me give you some more of the stuff he sent.\" \"But who are you?\" he persisted, as she raised the cup to his lips. \" Please don't, Mr. Walter. I am on no account whatsumdever to let you talk.\" \" How odd ! \" he muttered, as he again fell off to sleep. \" I know her looks and her voice, and cannot recollect her name.\" He had not to wait many hours for a solution of the mystery. Dr. Haller, when he saw his patient in the morning, found him, though very weak, perfectly sensible. He informed him of all that had happened to him, and added that there were some old friends of his in the house, who seemed to take a great interest in him. To Walter's enquiries of who they were, the doctor re plied with great truth that he did not know their names, but that they intended to pay him a visit in the course of the morning, if he felt himself equal to it. \" Of course I am equal to it. But when you go downstairs pray tell the waiter to come up and put me to rights.\""], [309, "301 THE CARYLLS. Instead of the waiter, Antonio made his appearance, and stated that he had been ordered to wait upon Milord, as long as he required attendance. \" But who is your master ? What is his name?\" asked Walter, in a fever of im patience. Unfortunately Antonio was unable to pro nounce, or even to recollect English names. \" Was it Brentford ; Lord Brentford?\" \" It might be ; he could not say. He believed it was something like that.\" Walter renounced all further questioning with something like a groan, but a few minutes later a tap came at the door, and his visitors, being informed that all was in order for their reception, entered the room. Miss Browne was the first to appear, followed closely by Miss Leycester. \" Miss Browne ! \" exclaimed Walter, in profound astonishment ; then as he caught sight of her companion, \" Beatrice, Beatrice ! is it indeed you, or is this only a dream ?\" \"No dream, dear Walter, but try to"], [310, "302 THE CARYLLS. compose yourself, or we shall be obliged to leave you.\" Miss Browne drew out some work from a bag which she carried, and seated herself near the window, while Beatrice established herself in a chair near the bed. The con versation that ensued was full of interest to both, and was only put an end to by Dr. Haller's return, who was exceedingly dis pleased when he saw the excitement and exhaustion of his patient. \" There must be no more of this,\" he said to Miss Leycester, \" or I shall forbid your visits altogether.\" Beatrice was all penitence, and Walter asked anxiously how long his confinement was likely to continue. \" That will depend in a great measure on yourself. If you are prudent, in a few days you might be moved into the sitting-room, but you must not think of travelling for some weeks ; not till the bone is knit.\" As soon as he had departed, Walter ex claimed, \" How provoking to be tied by the"], [311, "THE CARYLLS. 303 leg, or rather by the arm, in this way ! How long do you think of remaining here, Bee ?\" \" My dear Walter, I shall stay as long as I can be of any use to you ; till you are fit to travel.\" \" Dear, dear Bee, always the same ! And for goodness sake, when [you write home say nothing about me. Edward, or Brentford, or somebody would be coming out to me, and I have no wish to put anyone to the incon venience of such a journey. No one will hear of me or my accident in such a place as Y .\" Beatrice promised compliance, and in truth he needed no other attendance. She devoted herself to him and his amusement with a patience and assiduity of which women only are capable. She read to him, she sang to him, she taught him piquet, and allowed him to win three games out of four ; she gave him her arm when he was able to walk, first about the room, and then in the garden; she antici pated his wishes, and bore with his caprices and occasional fits of irritability. Brownie and Martha bowed down before his throne,"], [312, "304 THE CARYLLS. and no Turk ever exercised more despotic sway in his harem than Mr. Walter Caryll did in his sick room at Y . But all things must have an end, and one day Dr. Haller informed his patient that he might resume his travels as soon as he pleased. That evening Miss Leycester, in rather an embarrassed manner, took an opportunity when she was alone with Walter of an nouncing her intention of leaving Y on on the following day, as he was now quite capable of taking care of himself. But she meant to leave Antonio with him, and trust herself to the care of her vetturino in whom she had perfect confidence. \" Leave Y ! Leave me, still so weak ! Oh, Beatrice, you will never be so cruel !\" \" My dear Walter, be reasonable. Brownie's sense of propriety is shocked by our remaining so long with you as we have done. If I were indeed your sister \u2014 \" \" Ah ! Beatrice ; how can I bear the thoughts of parting with you ; you to whose care I owe so much ! I had hoped that now perhaps \u2014 . But that, like all my other hopes"], [313, "305 THE CARYLLS. through life, fails me. It would have been far kinder, Beatrice, to have left me to die where I fell.\" She turned to the window to conceal her agitation, perhaps to collect her courage. After a moment's hesitation she again ap proached him. \" Walter,\" she said, the colour rising to her face and brow \" you once asked me to marry you, and I refused ; will you take me for your wife now ?\" \" Beatrice, dearest Beatrice,\" he cried, tak ing her hand, \" will you indeed consent to be mine ? Do not mock me now. I could not bear it. Let me hear you say it once more.\" \" Dear Walter, if my love can make you happy it is yours ; yours entirely and for ever.\" It was all she could do to prevent him from throwing himself at her feet, all re collection of past suffering swallowed up in the present feeling of intense and unexpected happiness. He calmed down by degrees, and then they began discussing their future plans. They were thus employed, seated on the sofa"], [314, "306 THE CARYLLS. in rather close vicinity, when Miss Browne entered the room. \"You will not cast her adrift, Walter?\" whispered Beatrice. \" I should think not, indeed. Let us tell her of our engagement at once.\" Miss Browne's congratulations were as warm as if the happiness of a child of her own was in question, though she could not altogether repress a slight feeling of anxiety, respecting the change which might be effected in her own position. But she was not long left in suspense. \" But, Brownie,\" said Walter, \" our engage ment is conditional on my part. Unless you will remain with us, and assist me in keeping Miss Bee in order, I will have nothing to say to her.\" \" Of course Brownie will live with us. I could never get on without her,\" added Beatrice. Miss Browne thanked them both for their considerate kindness with tears in her eyes ; and that point being settled, the discussion"], [315, "307 THE CARYLLS. of their plans was resumed, Brownie being admitted to the council. \" I suppose we must inform Sir Edward, and Mary, and all of them,\" observed Miss Leycester. \" What a bore it will be !\" \" Bee, I have a most brilliant idea,\" ex claimed Walter. \" Let us go to Munich at once, and get married there without saying a word to anyone.\" \"My dear Walter, are you mad?\" \" Never saner in my life. It would save no end of let ter- writing and all sorts of trouble. We will take them all by surprise. I can fancy Brentford's face when we drive up to the door as Mr. and Mrs. Caryll. What fun it would be !\" There was something in that certainly ; still Beatrice hung back. \" What would your father, what would everybody say to such a proceeding?\" was her reply. \" They will say it was the best thing we could do. Dearest Beatrice, you will plead in your defence that, in the precarious state of health in which you saw me, it was giving"], [316, "308 THE CARYLLS. me the best, if not the only chance of recovery, as indeed I feel it is.\" Still Miss Leycester's only observation was, that it would look so odd, would hardly be decorous. \" It will look much odder, much less decorous, to see me travelling by your side all over Europe without being your husband,\" replied Walter. \" For I promise you, I do not mean to lose sight of you again till you are my wife.\" \" What shall I do ?\" said Beatrice. \" Brownie, do advise me.\" Miss Browne was hardly an impartial councillor. Little as her demeanour would seem to indicate it, she had a great deal of romance in her disposition, fostered by the studies of her youth. But it was the romance of Mrs. Radcliffe and other writers of that school, who dealt largely in abductions, elopements, and clandestine marriages. She saw nothing unnatural in Caryll's proposal, and, moreover, feeling deeply grateful to him for his offer of a home, she was very well in clined to support him now."], [317, "309 THE CARYLLS. \" If it were not for the settlements,\" she said, \" I should see no objection to Mr. Walter's proposal.\" \" You do not suppose, Brownie,\" exclaimed her friend, perhaps glad of an excuse for yielding, \" that, if I trust myself and my hap piness to Walter's care and affection, I should haggle about the settlement of my property. On the contrary, I am glad to have the op portunity of showing my perfect confidence in him. After all, I am my own mistress, so, dear Walter, do as you will ; I now make my first act of conjugal obedience. One comfort is, if any harm come of it, I can throw all the blame on Brownie's shoulders.\" It was then settled that Walter and Antonio should start on the following day for Munich, in order to make all necessary enquiries and preparations, while the ladies were to follow a few days later ; and thus it was carried out. In the chapel of the British embassy Walter Caryll received the hand of Beatrice Ley cester, and then the party broke up. Miss Browne was dispatched, under the care of Antonio, who was to be discharged in London,"], [318, "310 THE CAEYLLS. to May Bank to prepare everything for the reception of the new-married couple, but with the strictest injunctions to keep their marriage secret for the present. How she was to account for Beatrice's absence was, greatly to her distress of mind, left entirely to her own powers of invention. Walter and his bride, accompanied by Martha, also set out on their journey homewards, but in a more leisurely manner. Soon after they were seated in the carriage, Walter took a paper from his pocket-book, which he presented to Beatrice. \" What is this ?\" she asked, eyeing it with considerable suspicion. \" It is a paper I have had drawn up, by which I bind myself to settle all your property on yourself. They recommended me at the embassy to a German lawj'er, who, I was told, is conversant with English law, and does all the legal business of the embassy. He assured me it would be perfectly valid, as the basis of a post nuptial settlement. I remembered Brownie's hint.\" \" Oh, my dear Walter, can you think any-"], [319, "311 THE CARYLLS. thing of the sort necessary between us ? Thus I dispose of it,\" she said, tearing it up, and throwing it out of the carriage-window. \" When we are in England you will do what you think right.\""], [320, "312 THE CAEYLLS. CHAPTER XV. Mr. and Mrs. Shoreham were comfortably seated at their tea, when a carriage stopped at the door, and aloud ring came- at the bell. \"Who the deuce can that be?\" said the master of the house. \" I shall take the liberty of saying not at home.\" But before he could accomplish his pur pose the door opened, and Mr. and Mrs. Walter Caryll were announced. Lucy started up in a moment, and threw her arms round her brother's neck, after which came Bea trice's turn, whom she kissed. Having ac complished this, she said \u2014 \"Where and how did you two meet ?\" \" We came over in the same steamer,\" Walter replied ; \" and we agreed that our first visit should be paid in company to you.\" \" I am delighted to see you both ; but, dear"], [321, "THE CAEYLLS. 313 Walter,\" she added, more gravely, \" though a joke between ourselves is all very well, you ought not to have made the servant a party to it, by allowing him to announce you in that way. I am sure Beatrice could not approve of it.\" \"How ought he to have announced us?'' \" Why as Miss Leycester and Mr. Caryll, of course.\" \" Very well, Miss Lucy. But it so happens Beatrice did approve of it, and, as she is not yet ashamed of her husband or the name he bears, she chose to be announced as Mrs. Caryll.\" \"What can you mean?\" Thereupon a long explanation ensued, in terrupted occasionally by laughter, and still more frequently by expressions of sympathy and surprise. \"Well,\" said Lucy Shoreham, \"if I could but see Caroline married, I should have noth ing left to wish for.\" \" Till Gualdrada's turn comes,\" observed her husband, VOL. III. p"], [322, "314 THE CAEYLLS. \" Oh, Gualdrada is such a child. Time enough to think of that in three or four years. And when do you go to the Holt, Beatrice ?\" \"To-morrow. We arrived last night, in time to write to Sir Edward, and this after noon we received a telegram from Caroline \u2014 ' Come when you like ; the sooner the better.' So as you alone of our belongings are in London, we wrote this evening to say that they may expect us to-morrow to dinner.\" \" How I wish we could be there too !\" \" There will be plenty without us,\" said Mr. Shoreham. \" Beatrice will have enough to do, I suspect, to reply to all the congratu lations which will be showered upon her.\" \" And as soon as we are settled at May Bank,\" continued Beatrice, \" you must come and pay us a long visit with your children. If Mr. Shoreham cannot accompany you, it is so near town that he can always be running backwards and forwards.\" Mr. Shoreham's prediction of the honours awaiting Mr. and Mrs. Walter Caryll at the Holt was completely realized. At the station"], [323, "315 THE CAEYLLS. at which they alighted a regular ovation awaited them. Miss Caryll, the Brentfords, Edward and his wife were all in attendance, and the indiscriminate kissing that ensued excited the astonishment, and possibly the envy, of the railway officials. Beatrice was the first extricated from the milee. Caroline took possession of her, and carried her off in triumph. \" My father is waiting for you in the carriage. He is still a little lame from his last attack of gout, and could not venture into the crowd.\" She was soon seated by his side, with Caro line and Walter opposite to them. \" Ah, Miss Beatrice,\" said Sir Edward, \" how wise I was not to listen to all your fine speeches ; throwing me over at last, and marrying my son ! \" \" Oh, Sir Edward, that is not fair. You know you gave me no hopes, and as I was determined to belong to you somehow or other, I was obliged to take possession of Walter, the only Caryll vacant.\" \" Well, my dear child, I am glad you belong to me now under any title.\""], [324, "316 THE CARYLLS. They remained about a month, dividing their time between the Holt, Oakfield Chase, and Tuftons, now the residence of Lady Mary and Edward Caryll, who had retired on half pay with the rank of Lieut.-Colonel. There were many scenes in all these places which recalled to Walter's memory painful recollec tions of the past; but his wife, with a sort of intuitive, though imperfect, knowledge of what was passing in his mind, was always at hand with her ready sympathy to banish the cloud from his brow. In the sunshine of his present existence his past sorrows were gradually for gotten. At length they thought it time to retire to their own home, and settle down to domestic life. They found plenty of occupation there, though in rather different directions. Beatrice, who was a good practical farmer, endeavoured, but in vain, to inoculate her husband with her own bucolic tastes, but he very readily took charge of the gardens and grounds. Also he commenced architect, for they both saw the necessity of enlarging the house. His first plans were on a scale of regal, or rather im-"], [325, "THE CAEYLLS, 317 perial magnificence, but they fell to the groundbeneath his wife's orderlyand judicious criticism. Fortunately they called to their aid an experienced and trustworthy builder, who contrived to turn the old farm-house, for it was not much more, into a very picturesque and convenient dwelling ; large enough to receive their friends in comfort; not too large for persons with a moderate income. Soon after their arrival at May Bank Mrs. Caryll, escorted by her husband, resumed an occasional attendance in the hunting-field, where her first appearance was greeted by the cordial cheers and congratulations of all present. But suddenly she disappeared from the covert -side altogether, a circumstance which greatly perplexed all her sporting neighbours and acquaintance. A few months later the mystery was solved by her present- ing to the world a miniature edition of her- self, on whom the names of Louisa Anne were conferred; the first at the suggestion of Walter, the second at the request of Mrs. Caryll herself. From that time she expressed her determination to give up field-sports alto-"], [326, "318 THE CAEYLLS. gether. A new and hitherto undreamt of interest had sprung up in her breast, for, if the truth must be told, she had not looked forward with much satisfaction to the re straints which the discharge of her maternal duties would impose upon her. But Baby's first smile, as it stretched out its little hands to mamma, went straight to her heart, and she vowed henceforward to devote herself to the care and training of her child, who speedily became an object of idolatry to the whole household. No young lady, perhaps, ever entered npon life with a better chance of being spoilt than Miss Louisa Caryll. The individual who lost most by this addi tion to the family-circle was undoubtedly Mrs. Howe. From the first moment of the new comer's appearance on the stage the ex favourite had shown the most determined jealousy and ill-will towards her rival, not only by chattering and showing her teeth at her in the most vicious manner, whenever an opportunity offered, but by furtive attempts to pounce upon her, fortunately without success, when the nurse brought her charge"], [327, "319 THE CARYLLS. within a tempting distance. At last, after long and anxious deliberation, it was resolved to banish the offender to Mrs. Fry's apart ment, where she keeps all and sundry in a state of the most abject subjection. Perhaps, she consoles herself in her disgrace with the reflection, borrowed from a celebrated cha racter of antiquity, that it is better to reign supreme in the housekeeper's room than to play second fiddle in the parlour.
