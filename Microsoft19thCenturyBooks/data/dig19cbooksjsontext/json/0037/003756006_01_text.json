She was an exceptionally beautiful woman ; he was one of those -well-looking, well-dressed young men who may be count ed by the score at any large social gathering in London.

She, on the contrary, seemed impassive; her voice was contained ; there was no apparent agitation in her manner. ' What are you capable of doing to prove your devotion for me ?' she said. ' I tell you frankly I should expect a great deal in return for what you ask of me.' Vows come glibly to the lips of a young man ardently in love. ' Anything ! everything in this world !' he cried, with fervour. ' Are you prepared to leave England ?' Even though he believed that what he most coveted was within his grasp, a spasm contracted his heart. Leave Eng land, and not a third part through the hunting season, and with five of the best hunters it has ever been his lot to own ! But he was perfectly aware that the mere"], [11, "A Tale of Society. 3 appearance of hesitation would be fatal to his cause. ' Yes,' he answered bravely. ' I am prepared for anything.' ' I,' she proceeded, looking into the bright flames on the hearth, by which she stood \u2014 ' I am not a woman, you can imagine, to be taken up merely as a toy \u2014 it would be for ever /' And here she raised her eyes, which by this light seemed to be of deepest hue, to his. Enamoured as he is, the words ' for ever ' have a serious significance in his ears. Yet what man, unless of the most practical turn, ever recognised the possi bility of getting tired of the woman he worships ? 'My darling!' he cried, but again she made that repelling gesture, and, as he was a little bit afraid of her, it again made him pause. ' You must not forget,' she uttered, with b 2"], [12, "4 Omnia Vanitas : a somewhat Janus-like expression of face, ' that I am still Lady Lester, and that our flight is not yet an accomplished fact.

No, he was not afraid \u2014 he had contem plated that possibility already ; but he was a trifle daunted to hear her speak thus calmly on the subject. 'I have one stipulation to make,' she proceeded, again returning to contempla tion of the fire. ' It is, I believe, custom ary for the \u2014 the lover to fire into the air. I should particularly object to your doing that. Before I consent to fly with you, you must give me your word of honour not only to fire at my husband, but to do your best to kill him.'

She made this proposition, which was against all traditions of honour"], [13, "A Tale of Society. 5 and decency, as calmly as though she were giving him an injunction not to be late at the play.

' Well ? ' she said, with a questioning air. 1 You cannot be serious,' he answered, in an agonised voice. 'Not serious!' she uttered, accentuating the surprise in her voice. ' Why not ?'

Do you know that Mr. Graham and I were just settling the details of our flight. There was only one slight hitch in the arrangement.'

I feel quite unhinged. For two pins I could cry.' As she spoke, she lifted her eyes pathe tically to Sir Ralph, and the firelight showed him two dawning tears. ' Shall I go ?' he asked, in a kind, soft tone. ' You would rather be alone, I dare say. Let me come again to-morrow.' ' No, no, no, please do not !' answered Lady Lester. ' I want to talk to you.

Then she had seemed hard \u2014 her beauty was some what awe-inspiring ; now she was soft and womanly, almost child-like, with her pretty, appealing manner. Poor child ! thought Sir Ralph, looking at her lovely face, yet feeling for the mo ment more pity in his breast than admira tion. For he was of a different type from the ordinary man of the world, and had acquired the art of thought-reading and character-reading, not by an intuitive knack, but by long and sympathetic study of human nature, and by having suffered a great deal himself. He looked away from her face into the fire, and waited until she spoke again. 'Life is a dreadful thing,' she remarked presently, with a shade of petulance in her tone, ' and the world is a wretched place. And \u2014 and \u2014 I wish I was out of it.'"], [18, "10 Omnia Vanitas: ' That wish is not sincere, I am quite sure,' replied Sir Ralph, in a manner which one would use to a pretty, wilful child. ' No woman with all the gifts you possess is really tired of life. She may take a momentary pique at it when something puts her out, but, in reality, she clings passionately to it. Why, my dear child, if you were taken ill to-night, you would be terrified to death, and would want all the physicians in London to come and save you.' ' Oh, yes, that is quite likely, because I should be afraid to die. I should not be afraid if I knew what was going to happen to me \u2014 unless it was something dreadful. But I don't think it would be. I don't believe in hell.' ' I hope you believe in heaven,' said Sir Ralph, in a voice that was neither quite grave nor yet flippant.

And her eyes dilated, and she looked as if she was rather frightened at what she was saying. ' Do you ?' she continued, after a mo ment's pause which he did not attempt to break. ' Yes,' he said, looking at her gravely. ' I believe in a great many things. But I do not like to hear you talk in that way. I do not think you can mean it. And you are not old enough ; you cannot have thought or studied or read enough to be able to pronounce an opinion or to form a judgment on the weightiest and most important subject in the world.'

' It is much worse than bad form,' answered Sir Ralph. ' It is the greatest misfortune that can befall a woman.' ' Do you think it amuses me not to be lieve ?' cried Lady Lester impulsively. ' I would give everything I have to believe every fable that 1 was ever taught or be lieved as a child. If I did, I should always have the consolation of religion when I am miserable.'

Lady Lester nodded assent. ' And what have you heard about me ?' she asked. ' That you are very lovely and very much admired,' he answered evasively.

' That is a polite way of saying that you do think I flirt,' said her ladyship, with a quiver of her upper lip. ' But flirting is not a crime,' he answered gaily. ' I do not flirt,' she answered, with some vehemence. ' I do not care in the very least for any one of these men who hang about me and flatter me, and, no doubt, boast about me afterwards.'

I have two selves, ODe of which is always hating and upbraiding the other. Between them they make me very miserable. One persists in doing what the other disapproves of, and is sorry afterwards, and then the first says, \" I told you so.\" ' Sir Ralph laughed. ' I expect most of us suffer from that dual self,' he answered. 'Oh, no,' she replied gravely \u2014 'there are a great many people who have only one self.

You know, my lady, the men who despise fast women most are not the more serious and better kind, but just these young butterflies, who are the most despicable themselves. The women with whom they succeed are objects of unbounded contempt and mirth to them ; they have neither affection nor pity for them. If a woman respects herself, she must command the respect of others, but if \u2014 if \u2014 ' hesitating \u2014 ' a woman be ever so virtuous actually, and yet apes the man ners and behaviour of those who are not, she will not command any more respect"], [29, "A Tale of Society. 21 than they.

Lady Lester bit her lip and dragged the rings up and down her fingers with a ges ture of mixed anger and uneasiness. ' I have offended you,' said Sir Ralph, rising again, and this time she rose too. She was evidently trying to command her voice sufficiently to speak. There was a deeply mortified expression in her eyes."], [30, "22 Omnia Vanitas: ' I suppose you will never forgive me,' began Sir Ralph. But here the door flew open.

Sir Ralph would have liked to ask be fore he went whether she would ever forgive him, but he had no opportunity. She gave him her hand at parting ; her manner was rather cold, he fancied, but no wonder! and then his lordship conveyed him downstairs and let him out of the door himself, evidently in a hurry to be rid of him. ' What a fool I am to give advice to a woman, or to tell, the truth to one !' said Sir Ralph to himself, as he walked down the street.

ILTHOUGH Lady Lester hurried over her toilette, it was ten min- utes past seven before she was ready to get into her brougham. During the five minutes' drive, her husband never ceased grumbling and girding at her. The lamps past which they dashed showed that her face was pale, that her lips were pressed together, that her eyes shone with an angry light; but these evidences of her ' infernal ' temper, as Lord Lester was pleased to call it, were lost on him. It was not his own habit to be punctual, but"], [34, "26 Omnia Vanitas: to-night another member of the party had impressed the necessity for this virtue upon him, whose temper would be likely to cause him more inconvenience than his wife's. When they arrived, they found three of the company assembled ; there was only one wanting to make up the six. ' Such a bore, my dear,' said Mrs. Gre vil to Lady Lester. ' Bertie threw us over at the last moment, and I had to send all over the place to get another man. I wrote a note to Jack Graham half an hour ago, but he was not in. However, he's sure to come, if he's not engaged.' Lady Lester turned a little paler than she already was. ' Did you tell him we were coming ?' she asked. ' No, I hadn't a moment. How stupid of me !' with a meaning glance, quite mis understanding Lady Lester's pallor, which her quick eye had detected. 'If I had"], [35, "A Tale of Society. 27 only done that, he would have been sure to throw over anyone else. But we won't wait dinner any longer, will we ?' with a look at Lord Lester. ' We are twenty minutes late already.' 'All her ladyship's fault,' growled Lester, ' sitting over the fire palavering to that fellow Gray. I shouldn't have thought there was anything so very entrancing about his conversation.' ' Oh, Sir Ralph is quite a dear !' an swered Mrs. Grevil. 'Dick,' \u2014 to her hus band \u2014 ' do tell them to hurry !' Dick did not appear to hear. He was quite engrossed with a dark, handsome girl to whom he was talking. So Lester addressed the head-waiter in somewhat loud and angry tones, and the head-waiter obsequiously gave the soft an swer which is supposed to turn away wrath, but is not invariably successful in doing so."], [36, "Omnia Vanitas : 28 The party seated themselves. A vacant place was left beside Lady Lester, in case Mr. Graham should come. She was on thorns, but it was impossible for her to alter this arrangement. Her hand trem bled so that she could scarcely raise her spoon to her lips. She desisted after two experiments. Her teeth chattered. But it was less from her own embarrassment than from a sense of what Graham would inevitably feel at finding himself beside her after the events of the afternoon. The soup was removed ; the fish was being handed, and Lady Lester began to breathe. At this moment she looked up, and saw Graham approaching Mrs. Grevil. Their eyes met ; his face flushed crimson ; he almost gasped for breath. Lady Les ter's cheek caught fire too. Graham, to cover his confusion, made profuse explana tions and apologies to Mrs. Grevil; he then turned and greeted the rest of the"], [37, "A Tale of Society. 29 party, and took his place beside Lady Lester. No, he would not have any soup. He would go on with the dinner where they were, but he did not make much progress with it. A horrible idea took possession of him that the others knew what had happened ; that he had been held up for their derision ; that perhaps Mrs. Grevil's invitation was a planned thing. Lady Lester began to talk to Mr. Grevil, but it was evident that he preferred the conversation of his other neighbour. Gra ham made a desperate attempt to monopo lise Mrs. Grevil, but she half turned her back on him, and made it perfectly clear that Lord Lester's company was more agreeable to her. Lady Lester was sorry for him. The resentment she had felt, or pretended to feel, against him had died away. She was no longer pleased with herself, or amused"], [38, "30 Omnia Vanitas: by the cruel joke she had played upon him. Indeed, since she had talked to Sir Ralph, she felt ashamed of herself, and, even if for the moment she had been angry and mortified at what he said, she had too good a heart to bear malice, and too keen a moral sense still not to know that he was perfectly right. She made an effort, and began to talk to Graham. Her quick ear caught the bitter and mortified inflection of his voice as he answered. He tried to make sneer ing remarks, but was unsuccessful ; for it was not his line. Sarcasm is a blunt and clumsy weapon in the hands of the un skilled. For a wonder, Lady Lester, who had a somewhat imperious temper, did not crush him and then turn her back upon him as she was wont to do if a man presumed upon impertinent speech ; she was not in the least angry. On the contrary, she"], [39, "A Tale of Society. 31 felt sorry for him, and wanted to make amends for having behaved ill to him. Presently, amidst the Babel of voices from the tables around, she leaned a little to wards him and whispered, ' I am extremely sorry for what has happened, and I beg your pardon.' A little thrill of warmth stole to her heart, for she felt she had clone what was right and fair, and she wondered whether Sir Ralph would be glad to think that his words had not fallen on stony ground. It would perhaps have needed a more generous mind than Graham's to be dis armed by this simple speech ; he was partly mollified, but he could not restrain this biterness. ' I suppose,' he uttered in a very low voice, in which the passion was unskilfully repressed \u2014 ' I suppose you thought it a good joke to make a man a public laugh ing-stock because he was fool enough to love you.'"], [40, "32 Omnia Vanitas : ' Love !' she whispered, ' oh, no ! that was not love ! But all the same I blame myself. A woman who is what she should be would never allow a man to believe for one instant that she was unworthy of his respect. I admit that I flirted with you ; that I even encouraged you to think what I resented your thinking, and ' \u2014 in an almost inaudible voice \u2014 ' I am ashamed of myself for it.' Then she sank back in her chair, and again fell to thinking about Sir Ralph ; to wondering'whether he would have a better opinion of her for having humbled herself. ' If,' said Graham, leaning back also, and with smothered resentment in his voice \u2014 'if you had made a fool of me for the sake of amusing yourself, I might have borne it, but before another man who will tell it wherever he goes as a good story !' Lady Lester interrupted him quickly."], [41, "A Tale of Society. 33 ' You little know Sir Ralph if you think that. He will never breathe a word of it. It was he who made me see that I was wrong.' 'Really!' uttered Graham, with a jeal ous sneer. ' I was not aware that Gray had so much influence with your lady ship.' ' One always respects a gentleman and an honourable man,' returned Lady Lester, with a slight blush. Graham helped himself from a dish that was handed to him. Lady Lester, casting a glance at him, saw that his wrath, which had been mollified for the moment, was kindled again. Should she leave him alone, or make one more effort to propiti ate him ? She waited until he had finished his souffle. 'Do not bear malice!' she whispered. ' I have said I am sorry. What more can I do ? Let us be friends !' D"], [42, "Omnia Vanitas : 34 ' How can I be friends with you,' he answered, ' when I know you will be tell ing the story right and left as a good joke?' So, after all, his vanity was more mor tified than his love. ' I suppose,' she said, with a little curve of her lip, ' a woman's word of honour does not count. But all the same I give you mine that no one but our three selves shall ever know what happened to-day.' Mrs. Grevil was drawing on her gloves, and looking at Lady Lester. ' I am afraid we shall be dreadfully late,' she said, ' and we really ought to see the beginning of the piece. I am told the first act is the best.' Everyone rose. ' How shall we divide ?' asked Mrs. Grevil. ' Lester will go with you, and I will take Miss Stuart,' replied her ladyship, under standing perfectly what Mrs. Grevil desired."], [43, "A Tale of Society. 35 The two other men followed in a hansom. At the theatre Lady Lester agaiu found herself next Graham. She talked to him between the acts, pleasantly enough, but without a shadow of coquetry. His wounded pride slumbered ; he felt as much in love with her as ever, but a new kind of sentiment mixed with his love \u2014 a respect which had been absent before. Sir Ralph's words had sunk into her mind. She said them over and over again to herself. ' If a woman be ever so virtuous, and yet apes the manners and behaviour of those who are not, she will not command any more respect than they.' She glanced round. Mrs. Grevil was flirting a outrance with his lordship ; Miss Stuart treated Mr. Grevil as though he were her affianced lover, and there were several other couples in the stalls who appeared to be on the same sort of terms with each other. It was the time of year d 2"], [44, "36 Omnia Vanitas : when people are most given to arranging parties to the play, and doing their love making there. Lady Lester saw but little of the per formance. Her eyes were apparently fixed on the stage, but the eyes of her mind distracted her from seeing what took place there. What a miserable, unworthy life was the one that she and most of these other people were leading ! How empty of satisfaction ; of any real joy ! What a different picture she had dreamed to herself years ago of her future ! What high aims she had imagined : above all, what romantic dreams of love and sym pathy and tenderness. And the reality ?

She closed her eyes ; an im mense longing filled her soul \u2014 one of those indescribable yearnings after higher, greater things that sometimes music, sometimes a passage in a book, or an exquisite scene will inspire ; a longing that brings with it a rush of conviction that there is a world different from the one we know : a world where there are no shackles for the wings of the soul ; where"], [46, "Omnia Vanitas : 38 our feet are no longer clogged by earth from which we cannot struggle free.

Fortunately no one was observing her. The scene on the stage had just reached its climax ; the curtain was in the act of falling. ' I hate these dismal pieces,' said Gra ham to her. ' Ah, my lady, I see you are affected. People who have no heart very often cry at imaginary woes.' ' And do you think I have no heart ?' asked Lady Lester, trying to smile. ' I do,' with an air of profound con viction. ' You are wrong,' she answered. ' Peo ple who have no hearts are not un happy.' ' And pray, are you ever unhappy ?'"], [47, "A Tale of Society. 39 She only repeated his last word, but there was so much expression in her voice that he stared at her. She turned abruptly, and made some trivial remark to Mr. Grevil. Before the play was over, Graham had forgiven Lady Lester. He had forgiven her because he had fallen once more under her spell, and because the hope which ' springs eternal ' had made him think his cause was not, after all, quite desperate. ' May I come and see you again ?' he whispered, as he put on her cloak. She paused for a moment, whilst con tending thoughts were busy in her brain. Then she turned and gave him a friendly smile, and said, in a frank voice, ' Yes, do ! but as a friend. I am never going to flirt any more.' He was puzzled and disappointed, yet for all that he could not help thinking better of her, and he was cer-"], [48, "40 Omnia Vanitas : tainly more in love with her than ever.

' Headache ! \u2014 nonsense !' he said. ' Of course you will come. Why should you always be the one to spoil sport?' She answered, quietly enough, ' I am sorry, but I do not feel up to it to-night. I hope Mrs. Grevil will excuse me.' There was something in her manner which convinced both her husband and Mrs. Grevil that remonstrance would be useless. The former gave her a savage glance, and the latter said sweetly that of course, if she had a headache, they must"], [49, "A Tale of Society. 41 not attempt to persuade her. All the same, as she must pass the ' Bachelors',' would she mind dropping Miss Stuart there ? But here Dick Grevil interposed to say that Graham was not coming either, so Miss Stuart would go in a hansom with him. ' Oh, yes !' said Miss Stuart ; ' I so much prefer the air.' And, though it was raining when they got to the door, she refused to change her mind. Lady Lester drove home alone feeling profoundly sad. Everything seemed un satisfactory, unprofitable ; and she saw no better prospect in the future. When she reached home, she went straight to her room. After her maid left her, she sat over the fire absorbed in thought. Oh for a new life, for a better life \u2014 for"], [50, "42 Omnia Vanitas : an object, au end, an aim !

An evening's entertain ment \u2014 save the mark, as far as she was concerned \u2014 such as to-night, cost enough to keep a poor family in comfort for weeks. There were men and women and children starving at that very moment ; aud she shuddered. Then she let her eyes travel round the room full of every luxury and elegance that a dainty woman's mind could fancy or her taste suggest. A sharp remorse gnawed her breast, and suddenly, sitting upright, clasping her hands together, she muttered, ' Are they really more miserable than I am ? Is physical suffering much worse than mental ? What can I do to help them ?'"], [51, "A Tale of Society. 43 At that moment she felt that she would like to sweep all these costly things from her sight ; to change them into food and coals and blankets ; to go out amongst the poor, and feed the hungry, clothe the naked, minister to the sick. Many a worldly woman is, I believe, visited at times by similar aspirations, but more often than not they are utterly un productive. She wakes in better spirits the morning after her fit of remorse, and begins afresh her round of the toil of pleasure. ' If,' said Lady Lester to herself, with swimming eyes \u2014 ' if I loved, if I had some one to love me, what a different woman I should be !' She thought of her husband; in her mind's eye she saw his enamoured glances at Mrs. Grevil, and the change to contempt, rudeness, anger when he spoke to her, and a half sorrowful disgust swept over her. She fell to thinking deeply,"], [52, "44 Omnia Vanitas : deeply of what Sir Ralph had said to her. It had mortified her severely for the mo ment, but afterwards she felt how right he was \u2014 she thanked him from her heart. But for his words she would not have be haved as she did to Graham to-night. Now she was glad that she had made friends with him, and had told him of her regret. She could see that her treatment of him had been unwomanly, undignified ; that she had taken a cruel pleasure in in flicting pain and mortification, and she despised herself for having done it. But for Sir Ralph, she would have made an enemy for life. She wanted to see him again \u2014 to have a long, long talk about a thousand things ; he was not like other men, he would not begiu by sympathising with her and end by making love to her.

It was not very easy to arrange to see him alone ; to secure an uninterrupted interview ; but she was bent upon trying. Fortune favoured her desire. The fol lowing morning at breakfast his lordship announced his intention of going down to their country place for a couple of nights. ' I shall ask Sir Ralph to dine with me whilst you are away,' said Lady Lester. She hated doing anything that seemed underhanded or deceitful. ' I suppose you will ask some one else,' observed her husband disagreeably. It was not that he cared in the very least what she did or how she amused herself in his absence, but he liked to contradict and oppose her \u2014 it had become a habit with him. ' No,' she answered, with a faint blush,"], [54, "46 Omnia Vanitas : for she was very anxious and eager for this interview. ' I want particularly to talk to him, and, if there were other people present, I could not do so.' 'Upon my soul, Pauline,' said Lester, staring at her, ' I think you are getting tolerably bare-faced.' 'What do you mean?' she asked, with that touch of scorn which she could not restrain at times, and which always irri tated him. ' I mean,' he answered, with a biting sneer, ' that, you seem to have forgotten the decencies of life. I don't think the most unblushingly impudent woman has her lover to dine alone with her in her husband's house.' Lady Lester trembled with anger. She was tolerably used by now to her hus band's coarse and brutal speeches ; she was perfectly aware that they were made not because he believed them, but only to"], [55, "A Tale of Society. 47 vex and wound her ; yet her spirit could not brook them even after so long an experience. 'Lover!' she repeated, with a whole world of scorn. ' I should have thought even you might have had more discrimina tion than that.' ' Oh, it's easy enough to pretend to virtuous indignation, I daresay,' scoffed his lordship, ' but when I find you sittiug in the dark with a man one night, forget ting to dress for dinner, and then hear of your wanting to be alone with him the next, in utter disregard of what the ser vants or anyone else may think, it's a pretty strong order.' Pauline was so angry that she almost gave up her project. ' I should have thought even you,' she repeated bitterly, ' would hardly attempt to vilify a man like Sir Ralph.' ' Oh,' sneered he, ' I suppose he's a man"], [56, "48 Omnia Vanitas : and, if a woman makes up to him, he's not likely to ' He stopped, for the lightning in Paul ine's eyes warned him he was going rather too far.

'You won't leave me, I suppose?' Pauline did not look so lovely as usual when she said this. There was an in tensely bitter expression in her face which marred its beauty. Evidently Lord Lester understood the taunt, for he flung from the room with an oath and banged the door behind him. Pauline went and looked out of the window with a swelling heart.

She had exalted Sir Ralph on a pedestal in her mind ; had idealised him. He was the first man who had told her the real, unvarnished truth ; told it out of kindness and good-will. Men whom she had angered had sometimes told her bitter truths, bitter because they were exaggerated by pique or anger ; but, if she had admitted their veracity to her own heart, their influence had been diminished by the knowledge of the motive which prompted them. She turned away from the window with a feeling of intense dis appointment. No ! she would not ask him ! E"], [58, "50 Omnia Vanitas : CHAPTER III. ATE manages things her own way. Lady Lester resolved not to ask Sir Ralph to dine. She abandoned the idea of seeking his society, of confiding in him. A reckless feeling came over her. She must continue in her present groove, although she was beginning to hate it. As she stood looking out on the gardens in a bitter and melancholy frame of mind, a tap came at the door. It was her maid, who announced the arrival of her lady ship's dresses from Paris. Would her ladyship go upstairs and see them ? They"], [59, "A Tale of Society. 51 were laid out. They were lovely. The maid's eyes glistened. Pauline followed her upstairs. New clothes are always a distraction to a wo man who has that feminine foible, love of dress ; and, even though Pauline was disappointed, and bored, and unhappy, she could still take a certain amount of in terest in the subject. She looked critically at her dresses, praised here, found fault there, made sug gestions elsewhere. Her taste was perfect. Then she tried them on. By this time it was twelve o'clock. She was summoned downstairs by the announcement that Mrs. Denison was in the drawing-room. Mrs. Denison was one of her intimate friends. ' Well, dearest,' said that lady, kissing her, ' how are you? I came early to make sure of finding you. Come and take a turn in the Row ; the victoria is here. I met Lord Lester on the steps. He tells e2"], [60, "Omnia Vanitas : 52 me he is going away for a couple of days. I pretended to be sorry, but I am ex tremely glad. What shall we do in his absence ? Let us have some fun !' ' Fun !' exclaimed Pauline, in a drear}' tone. ' I don't think there is any fun left in the world. But I will put on my bonnet, and go with you. I want air.' Five minutes later, they were in the victoria. Mrs. Denison was a pretty woman, with a radiant kind of manner. She was always smiling \u2014 in public, at all events \u2014 and it was not only for the purpose of showing her lovely teeth, as she had a happy nature and was easily amused. ' Well, darling, I call this great luck,' she said, and squeezed Pauline's hand. ' I have got a cheery little party dining to night, and I want another woman. And no woman could suit me so well as you. And"], [61, "A Tale of Society. 53 you are always so much more charming without his lordship.' And she made a fantastic little grimace that did not betray a favourable inclina tion towards Lord Lester. ' I heard you were at the play last night with that horrid Nina Grevil. I wonder, my dear, how you tolerate that creature. Her husband, I am told, is going on more than ever with the Stuart girl. She is such bad form, I think. I saw your latest adorer, Jack Graham. We were having supper at the \" Orleans,\" and he came in.' ' Did he tell you?' asked Lady Lester. ' Yes. What have you done to him ? I know you have bewitched him. But what more ? I chaffed him a little bit about you, and he looked so odd.' ' My dear Cissy,' interrupted Pauline, a trifle irritably, 'I wish you would not chaff anyone about me. It is rather"], [62, "54 Omnia Vanitas : humiliating for me, although it may amuse you.' 'Don't be cross, dearest. Chaff was not the right word. I only asked if you were as lovely and fascinating as ever.' ' And what did he answer ?' inquired Pauline, wondering a little. ' He said you were the most fascinating woman he had ever met, but that you were very odd. And then he got very red, and I felt quite inquisitive to know why he thought you odd. But I could not get any more out of him. Well now, to-morrow \u2014 to-morrow we'll do a play. I'll ask Jack for you, shall I ?' ' No, no, no /' answered her ladyship, with considerable vivacity. ' How I do hate that system of pairing people ! What is the use when women are married ? Playing at making love is very undignified and \u2014 and very \u2014 wrong.' ' Gracious Heavens !' cried Mrs. Denison,"], [63, "A Tale of Society. 55 ' what has come to you ? Wrong ! My dear Pauline, how ridiculous you are ! How in the name of Fortune could one exist without flirting ? Why, life would not be worth living. Let us get out and walk down, shall we ? and trust to Provi dence about our party to-morrow. We will ask the first two men we meet who are agreeable to us.' It was a bright morning for December in London, and there was a fair sprinkling of both riders and walkers. Mrs. Denison soon found two eligible men who would be delighted to accompany them to the play. ' We are not going alone with them ?' said Pauline. ' Oh dear no. Joe will go, of course, for propriety. But he always visits his different clubs during the performance. Nothing bores him like a play. So he will be there enough to be respectable, and not enough to be in the way. Joe is a treasure.'"], [64, "56 Omnia Vanitas: Here they were joined by two men, who walked one on each side of them. Paul ine's companion told them a story about a mutual acquaintance so exquisitely droll, and flavoured with such piquant malice, that Mrs. Denison went off into a peal of laughter, and Lady Lester was obliged to put her muff to her mouth to prevent her amusement being audible. The man on Mrs. Denison's right roared ; only the teller of the story preserved, as was becoming, his gravity. At this moment the little group was certainly rather calculated to attract attention, and just then Pauline caught sight of Sir Ralph close beside them. She blushed ; she was vexed without knowing why, and she gave him a slight, hurried bow. He returned her salute, but she fancied he looked cold and grave, as though he disapproved of her. What right had he to disapprove of"], [65, "A Tale of Society. 57 her ? A sense of nettled pride stung her \u2014 she was angry with him and with her self. The joke that a moment ago had seemed so excellent, so mirth-inspiring, fell flat and stale now. The others were just as much amused, but Pauline thought it vulgar and malicious. ' So you know Sir Ralph Gray ?' said Mrs. Denison, as they were driving home wards. ' You must introduce him to me. I want particularly to know him. He is so good-looking \u2014 but how sad his face is ! I believe he has had a lot of trouble. Ask him to come to the play to-morrow, and we will get another woman.' Pauline shook her head resolutely. ' I do not think he would care for it,' she said. 'Is he a prig?' inquired her friend. ' He looked as solemn as an owl just now. ' He looked disgusted, I thought,' said"], [66, "Omnia Vanitas : 58 Pauline, surprising herself, as she often did, by what she said.

Still I must say, when Sir James laughs, it is rather like a donkey braying, and I think people turn round to see if it is, and are surprised to find it isn't. You will come home and lunch with me, of course ?' Yes, Pauline would lunch\u2014 she had nothing else to do. Two or three cheery people dropped in, and she laughed and was amused, and for the time forgot the existence of Sir Ralph. She had sent word for the carriage to come for her. There were two notes and a letter in it.

Tears sprang to her eyes ; the desire to see and speak to him returned with ten fold force. If she had only not engaged herself for these two evenings !

'Indeed you are quite mistaken. I was grateful to you for what you said \u2014 it was all quite true. I have been thinking of it ever since, and I want to hear you say a great deal more. I want to tell you all sorts of things. Could you \u2014 would you come and dine with me to night? Lester has gone into the country.' She was not in the very least afraid of his misunderstanding her invitation. He paused a moment ; he was a trifle perplexed. Then he said, seeing how eager she looked, and intuitively realising the need of her heart,"], [69, "A Tale of Society. 61 ' I shall be very glad. At eight ?' ' Yes, at eight punctually,' she answered. Then, seeing a smile cross his face, she added gaily, ' You are smiling at my say ing punctually.

She felt quite exultant. But what would Cissy say ? She would be very angry. And what excuse could she possibly invent ? She hated telling falsehoods \u2014 there was no reason why she should not tell the truth ; but yet \u2014 that was impossible. Cissy would not under stand her; would certainly put a wrong construction on the matter \u2014 so would most of her friends. They would laugh at her; rally her; make jokes which would amuse them and wound her. No, the truth could"], [70, "62 Omnia Vanitas : not be told. She felt keenly that it was inconsiderate to put Mrs. Denison off, but it was not like a long engagement \u2014 the party had been arranged and completed. before she was invited. What plea soever she made must be false ; the only one she could think of was the hackneyed excuse of indisposition. She suffered sometimes from headache. So, late in the afternoon, she wrote a note to Mrs. Denison. She dared not send it earlier, or the little lady would probably come round herself to see whether it was true, and to persuade her that the best thing for a headache was a cheery dinner. The note despatched, Pauline threw her self in a chair by the chimney-corner and gave herself over to reflection. She was going to do a strange, unconventional thing, dictated merely by the spur of fancy. How did she know that Sir Ralph,"], [71, "A Tale of Society. 63 who was only an acquaintance, of whom she actually knew very little, was a fitting recipient for her confidences ? It was only a blind instinct, and a woman's blind instincts are not, like a dog's, unerring. It is enough with her that she takes a fancy to a man, and straightway she be lieves in and trusts him. Mistaken confi dence has been a Will-o'-the-wisp to so many of the sex. The latter part of the reflections were not Pauline's, but are the author's. It was a long time since she had in dulged in confidences to anyone \u2014 two or three sharp lessons had warned her against taking the world into her heart and show ing it either her treasures or her skele tons.

A chill thought crossed her meditations. After all, she could but deal in vague generalities. A woman with any dignity does not complain of her husband to another man, and Lester certainly was the primary cause of her unhappiness. She could in fact only tell Sir Ralph that her present life was unsatisfactory, and beg him to find a remedy for her discon tent. She was quite willing to blame herself ; to confess her own faults. Pauline was not one of those people who invariably believe, and assert themselves to be in the right. These have vain and shallow natures, and are, unfortunately, numerous. The clock chimed the half-hour after seven, and Lad}* Lester went upstairs to dress. She re-entered the drawing-room at five minutes to eight, dressed in some white material which, in spite of its sim-"], [73, "A Tale of Society. 65 plicity, gave additional elegance and dis tinction to her appearance. It was her habit to wear white in the evening. She had an exquisitely fair skin, and white only enhanced its beauty. Pauline was not indifferent how she looked. Some times she bestowed less thought on the subject than at others. To-night she had been occupied with her thoughts. But she had never looked more lovely. The clock was striking as Sir Ralph was announced. 'You see, I obey your injunction to the very letter,' he said, smiling ; and she answered gaily, ' How did you manage it ? Have you been standing outside the door waiting until the clock struck?' 'No,' he answered, 'I did not preme ditate my effect ; but punctuality is so much my habit that, without making any conscious calculation, I generally find F"], [74, "Omnia Vanitas ; 66 myself at my rendezvous to the moment.' 'And I have been down five minutes,' laughed Pauline. ' I was determined that, after insisting on your being punctual, you should not arrive to find an empty room. Imagine to yourself that I dressed in twenty-five minutes.' ' Is it possible ?' he said, with a look of smiling admiration. ' Then let me advise you never to take more nor less.' ' Ei tu, Brute V said Pauline, gaily. ' I never expected base flattery from you.' ' Not base,' he rejoined. At this moment dinner was announced. Pauline would have enjoyed a tete-a-tete dinner. Nothing was more disagreeable to her than an audience of three men of irreproachable solemnity, but his lordship insisted on the servants remaining in the room during the entire function, even when he and his wife dined alone. This annoyed Pauline. She could never bring"], [75, "A Tale of Society. 67 herself to talk, after the custom of many people, as if servants were deaf mutes. 1 1 find myself,' she complained, half laughing, half serious, ' making conversa tion expressly on their account. Some times I even try to amuse them. There is only one redeeming point about their presence \u2014 they prevent our quarrelling, as we probably should if we were tete-a-tete.' It was evident that she could not depart from the custom of the house on this occasion, especially when she was doing such an unusual thing as entertaining a comparative stranger alone. But somehow, to-night the situation was less constrained than usual. Sir Ralph did not relate highly-flavoured anecdotes, or tell stories to the disadvantage of his neighbours. He had plenty to say that was interesting and amusing, whilst it was sufficiently innocuous to have been related in a young ladies' seminary in the p2"], [76, "68 Omnia Vanitas : presence of the ' principals.' And he did not look sad to-night, but smiled frequent ly, although Pauline remarked that he did not laugh. She laughed very gaily herself, and laughter became her. Pre sently they fell to talking about plays. ' Do you despise the play ?' Pauline asked. ' I do not think I have ever seen you at one.' ' My dear lady,' he answered, ' I despise nothing. I am not sufficiently wise or clever or talented to look down from my superior altitude.' ' But it is generally the people who are neither wise nor clever nor talented wrho do,' said Pauline. ' Was that why you suspected me ?' he asked, a little maliciously but contradict ing his words by the expression of his face. 'Yes,' she answered, in the same vein. ' What a thought-reader you are ! But,"], [77, "A Tale of Society. 69 seriously, does the play not amuse you?' 'Nothing more. Unluckily, I have to pay such a heavy penalty for that sort of amusement that I rarely find it worth while. I am a martyr to headaches. And, if I go into a theatre or a badly-ventilated room, I am probably distracted with pain for twelve hours after.' ' Oh !' said Pauline sympathetically, ' what a misfortune ! Then, is that why we so seldom meet you ?' ' That is why,' he answered ; then added, as if under some mental compulsion, ' I am naturally a gregarious creature.' 'Being gregarious, though, does not absolutely mean that one must be fond of balls, and evening parties, and large gatherings, does it ?' queried Pauline. ' Gregarious, I take it, means liking the company of one's fellows. But I confess that what I really enjoy is the society of one congenial companion at a time.'"], [78, "70 Omnia Vanitas : ' Yes,' said Pauline sighing, she scarce ly knew why, ' there is no doubt that is the pleasantest way of enjoying society. Only it is not very easy to accomplish !' By this time the raven aud the twin flamingos had departed. Pauline was toy ing with a grape. Sir Ralph was not to be further tempted by his host's fine claret. Suddenly she dipped her fingers into her ruby bowl. 'Let us go upstairs. Shall we?' she said, having completed the operation. ' By all means,' he rejoined, rising and preceding her to the door."], [79, "A 7 ale of Society. 71 CHAPTER IV. ADY LESTER seated herself in the chair that habit had made especi- ally her own. It was in the left chimney corner, whence she could contemplate the flames which the wood sent roaring up the chimney or flickering in the grate with an uncertain light. ' I am a fire-worshipper,' she was wont to announce. ' I love summer and sun shine, but I always regret my fire. It inspires me, it helps me to think \u2014 some times it even makes me imagine happier possibilities.' Two lamps stood on tables at some"], [80, "72 Omnia Vanitas : distance from the fire, but their crim son shades prevented them from send ing forth much light, though they added a rich tone of colour to every object in the room, and gave a look of harmony and luxury to the whole.

It is generally with trifles that husbands and wives irritate and gall each other. To-night, in his absence, Pauline en joyed her owl's light. It was not strong enough to read or work by, but it was just the light to talk by \u2014 to talk in a friendly, sociable, perhaps confidential manner. Sir Ralph, who appreciated beauty in every form, received the most agreeable impressions as, standing at the opposite chimney-corner to her ladyship, he allowed"], [81, "A Tale of Society. 73 his eyes to travel from her round the room and back to her again. She was a lovely woman, and at this moment he was quite sure that she was what he had once or twice been disposed to doubt \u2014 a nice woman. Nice is an inadequate word, but I know of no better, nor indeed of any equivalent for it. She looked up at him with a bright glance. Her eyes, which in broad day light had a grey-green hue, were now like two great violets. 'What do you think happened to me last night ?' she said. ' The strangest contretemps. Shall I give you three guesses ?' ' I would rather you told me,' he an swered. ' I should not guess in a dozen.' ' No. I am sure you would not, unless I gave you a clue. Now, whom do you think I sat next at dinner ?' ' Not Graham !'"], [82, "74 Omnia Vanitas : ' Yes \u2014 positively.' And Pauline uttered a little laugh that sounded like enjoyment, and gave Sir Ralph another twinge of doubt. ' That must have been very embarrass ing \u2014 for him,' he observed. ' For him !' echoed Pauline. ' Then you do not think of me ?' ' Because you tell it as though it had amused you, and was rather a good joke.' Pauline grew suddenly grave. ' I did not think so at the time, I assure you,' she said. ' Do you know that after you were gone yesterday, and whilst I was dressing, I was smitten with remorse. Your words went home.' ' It is very good of you to say so,' replied Sir Ralph. ' I give you my word I went away very uneasy. I felt that I had com mitted an indiscretion \u2014 I was afraid, an impertinence.' ' No, no, no,' exclaimed Pauline, with"], [83, "A Tale of Society. 75 vivacity. ' You were quite right. It was very good of you. Most men would have laughed with me at the time, and at me afterwards. They would have told every. one behind my back what you said to my face, only much more unkindly. But now,' \u2014 recovering her smile \u2014 'I must tell you what happened. Will you not sit ?' motioning to a chair near her \u2014 ' it gives me a greater sense' of repose. When a man stands up to talk to me in my own house, I always feel as though he were going to say good-bye the next moment.' He obeyed. ' Do you believe in Pate ? Do you think she orders all these little incidents that seem to happen so naturally? Well,' \u2014 not waiting for an answer \u2014 'it had been arranged that Herbert Sefton should be appropriated to me ; but whether he found some more attractive engagement or not, I cannot say. At all events, he threw"], [84, "76 Omnia Vanitas : Mrs. Grevil over, and at the last moment, feeling how awkward it would be if there was no one to divert my attention from her little flirtation with Lester, she sent round to \" compel \" some one to come in. And, as Fortune or Fate would have it, her victim was Mr. Graham, who, it is needless to say, had not been warned of the pleasure in store for him. He came late. You may imagine what I felt \u2014 how I sat on thorns, praying devoutly that something, anything might happen to keep him away. The soup had gone ; my tem perature was recovering its normal con dition, when, raising my eyes, I saw him hurrying in, and woe was him ! he saw me.' ' What a dramatic air you have !' smiled Sir Ralph. ' I think you would make a good actress.' ' Yes, indeed ; you should see me play in private theatricals,' said her ladyship lightly. ' I am excellent in light comedy,"], [85, "A Tale of Society. 77 but I excel in tragedy. And this was tragedy with a vengeance. You see the place next me had been thoughtfully left for him, and I could not ask for the arrangement of the table to be altered, as it would have inconvenienced the other pairs.' ' What a strange mixture she is !' thought Sir Ralph. ' One moment she is ingenu ous, the next amused, the next scornful, then bitter, then sarcastic' And he felt a pitying tenderness for her. Even though she was a thorough woman of the world, there was something child-like about her at times. And her appearance enhanced this impression. Her rippling hair, the colour of pale gold, worn simply over her low forehead, the purity of her complexion, the freshness of her lips \u2014 all these things gave her a young and innocent look. She was tall, and when she drew herself up could look a very haughty dame indeed,"], [86, "78 Omnia Vanitas : but, when she was talking simply and naturally to some one she liked, she had a frank and childish look that was very attractive to men \u2014 men who like a woman to be weak and confiding ; men who have a chivalrous wish to help and do service for them.

Pauline made a petulant movement with her fan. ' I hate to hear you say those things,' she exclaimed, with energy. ' They make me feel as if you \u2014 I don't quite know the word I want, but something like \u2014 despised me. ' Heaven forbid !' he uttered devoutly.

' I did,' cried Pauline triumphantly. ' I said I was sorry, and I begged his pardon, and though he made some rude and dis agreeable remarks, I would not take offence, and by the time we parted at the end of the play, we were quite friends, and he asked if he might come and see me again.' ' So you re-captured your victim ?' ob served Sir Ralph, in a tone that hurt Pauline. 'No,' she said \u2014 'you are mistaken. I am going to have no more victims. I shall never flirt any more.' ' It is, at all events, an excellent thing"], [89, "A Tale of Society. 81 to make good resolutions,' he observed. ' To help pave the infernal regions !' said Pauline, with some petulance. ' I see you decline to believe in me.' ' No, indeed,' he answered, with great sincerity. ' But it is very difficult to take an absolutely new departure. I think just now you are a little depressed, bored, de's \u0153uvree. When your spirits rise again, the same toys which you now want to throw away in disgust will amuse you again.' Sir Ralph did not speak on a subject of which he was ignorant ; he had so often known pretty fashionable women take a momentary pet at their lives, and return to them again afterwards with renewed ardour. The cure for satiety is abstinence for a time. So far, and with such a slight acquaintance as he had with Lady Lester, he did not imagine there was any great depth in her character, nor did he think her capable of sustained resolution.

She looked intently at the flames, and Sir Ralph could see by the firelight the mortified expression of her face. ' It is evident that you do not believe in me,' she said presently. ' Perhaps it is natural, as you have only seen me at my worst \u2014 yesterday, when 1 had behaved out rageously, and this morning in the park.'

' I see no need for improvement,' said Sir Ralph. ' My father was the kindest man in the world, and, if it had not been for my mother, I don't think he would ever have sent anyone to a naughty place ; but she used to lecture him dreadfully about his leniency to his parishioners, and say he was a partaker of their sins if he did not denounce them; and so, every now and then, poor dear, he used to preach a terror-inspiring sermon, which she wrote for him.

When he felt obliged to tell them that their misfortunes were a dispensation of Pro vidence, he always looked and felt, I knew, child as I was, a little bit sneaky.' Sir Ralph smiled. His attention was quite fixed upon the story-teller. ' I was not flippant then, as I am now,' Pauline went on. ' I liked religion, and I believed every single word of the Bible, though certain things struck me as being hard and unfair. But my mother said, \" You must believe all or none,\" so I elected to believe all. She is a good woman, my mother \u2014 rather low church and very devout \u2014 and was dreadfully"], [95, "A Tale of Society. 87 severe against back-sliders, especially of her own sex. Perhaps it was because poor Papa was more than usually lenient to them. I was fond of her, but I adored my father. I liked his religion ; I liked his good spirits, and I liked his kind, charitable, humane ideas and actions most of all. It seemed so dreadful to me to think of poor, miserable people who have a very bad time in this world going to hell. I remember a poor young woman dying, after six months of dreadful suffer ing. I believe she had been rather a bad character, and, in respect of numerous husbands, resembled the woman of Sa maria ; and I asked Papa, with tears in my eyes, if he thought poor Sarah Barnes must go to hell, and he hummed, and hawed, and would have answered \" No,\" I believe, but Mamma transfixed him with a glance, and said, \" There was no mercy for the impenitent.\""], [96, "88 Omnia Vanitas : ' I heard afterwards that Mamma had endeavoured to make Sarah give up her last husband on her death-bed, but she w7ould not. They said his goodness to her was perfect, and that often after a hard day's work he would sit up all night with her. The nearest approach to a quarrel my father and mother ever had was because Papa refused to threaten her with the terrors of hell if she did not separate from him : this was two months before she died. ' But all this is not the story, except as far as it shows you my \" bringing up.\" ' I was not sent to school, but there was a \"decayed gentlewoman \" in the village who was extremely clever, and had been a governess.

What fun she and Papa and I used to have in the school room !

Pauline's eyes were kindled ; she leaned a little forward \u2014 for the moment she was living over again the dear, homely, healthy past. And Sir Ralph looked at her with keenest interest, and began to see possi bilities in her which he had not dreamed of ten minutes ago. ' When I was seventeen,' Pauline con tinued, ' came the episode of the fortune. Did you know ' \u2014 lightly \u2014 ' that I had a fortune ?'

I remember his taking me on his knee \u2014 he was going abroad next day \u2014 and saying, ' \" This time things are going to turn up trumps. I'll make a pot of money, and, by Jove ! I'll leave it to this little darling, and she shall be an heiress and marry a Duke.\" ' Papa laughed, but Mamma looked very angry.

So I became a person age. Poor dear Papa was rather bored with the troubles attendant on our for tunes, and I think Mamma saw to and arranged everything as much as possible. At all events, she persuaded him to buy Lester's father's estate. They had cut off the entail, both being frightfully in debt. And I' \u2014 resuming her flippant tone \u2014 'was thrown into the bargain.' Sir Ralph looked inquiringly at her. ' What do you mean ?' he asked. ' No, no !' she said. ' I do not mean that. Really and honestly I married for love. I will tell you how it happened. We lived on at the Rectory for several months, and during that time Mamma and Lady Lester, my husband's mother, be came bosom friends.

There was much driving to and fro between the Court and the Rec tory : they were only seven miles apart. Lady Lester proposed to my mother to present her and me at Court the following season, and to make us part of \" society,\" and, in return, Mamma persuaded Papa that it would be a kind and delicate action to let her ladyship stay on for another six months at the Court, and that it would be good for us all, and especially for Pauline, to travel on the Continent for that time.

' In Rome,' she said, with a tremor in her voice, ' Papa caught Roman fever and died.' There was a long pause. Sir Ralph's face expressed the deepest sympathy, but he remained silent. Glanciug at him, she saw what was written in his face, and needed no words. ' If it had not been for Mary Dunstan, I think my heart would have broken. No one will ever know ; I could not express in words what she has been to me. If she had remained with me, I should never have become what I am now.' ' And was she obliged to leave you ?' ' When first she came to us, she was engaged to a man who was too poor to marry her, and had gone to Australia.

But I cried and made such a fuss that she persuaded him to wait another year, and then, when our dreadful trouble came, she would not leave us. Pauline made a gesture with her hand. ' I will spare you any account of that awful time. We went straight back to the rectoiy, and then Lady Lester insisted on our staying at the Court, and Lester was always there, and was very kind to me, and, I thought, very fond of me ; and then \u2014 and then \u2014 and then everyone per suaded me ; and Mary Dunstan's lover wrote her the most heart-breaking letters, so that she was torn in two between him and me, and I fancied I was in love with Lester \u2014 indeed, I am sure I was.

You think I have been romancing : that the good little girl is a creature of my too lively imagination.' ' On the contrary,' said Sir Ralph, ' I believe firmly in the good little girl \u2014 it is the grown-up lady who puzzles me.' Pauline looked at the flames, then at him.

' Poor child !' uttered Sir Ralph, in a voice strangely moved. And he held out his hand, and took hers with so genuine a movement of sympathy that it made her bite her lip to keep back the rushing tears. She left her hand in his. At last she felt as if she had found the friend whom she so sorely needed. ' How long is it since this illness ?' he asked, releasing it with a kindly little pressure. ' Three years.'

I told you, did I not, that I don't believe in anything ? I said it flippantly then, but oh, in my heart of hearts, I am not flippant. I desire no thing better than to believe. I wish I had been born a Roman Catholic, then I should have been obliged to: I should not have been allowed to think for myself.'

The next day was a busy one with Lady Lester. She had several engagements, which gave her little or no leisure to think. Then there were the dinner and play in the evening. She looked forward with some trepidation to meeting Mrs. Denison. That little lady was probably offended as she had not been round to inquire after her defaulting guest.

' Joe,' who was a very good-natured, easy-going gentleman, laughed, as he generally did at any remark made by his wife. ' I'm the odd one as usual,' he said to Lady Lester.

' Oh !' said Mrs. Denison laughing, ' as you were too ill to come last night, and as he was seen driving up to your door at eight o'clock, I thought he must be your medical attendant.' A blow would scarcely have given a greater shock to Pauline. Fortunately for her, she became cold instead of hot. She did not reply for a moment ; then, as she felt all eyes turned upon her, a sensation of anger took possession of her.

You can't think how small I looked when, after pouring forth volumes of regret about your not being able to come on account of your dreadful head ache, Johnnie Yernon, whose people live close to you, told me that, as he passed your door, Sir Ralph drove up.' Pauline did not answer. She turned to Mr. Denison, and made an entirely irrelev ant remark. He, seeing that something was wrong, hastened to reply.

Mrs. Denison was distracted, and apolo gised humbly. Pauline received her pro testations coldly, and, the carriage drawing up at the theatre, brought them to an abrupt termination.

' He left to be married.' ' Oh !' Lady Lester was dying to ask a hundred questions, but something prevented her. It was perhaps because she was so deeply interested that she shrank from seeming inquisitive. ' His troubles have told upon him, I'm afraid,' proceeded Colonel Lynden. ' Has he had much trouble ?' asked Pauline, repressing with difficulty the eagerness in her voice. ' No end,' replied the colonel. And then he re-iterated, ' Poor old Ralph !'

Going up North to take pos session of their place, Ralph and his wife were smashed up in that awful railway collision \u2014 I don't know if you remember it. She was killed on the spot, and he was so injured that he has never quite got over it to this day. Fancy, poor old chap, just as they had such a good time in front of them !' Pauline's heart grew cold within her. She was thinking how cruelly ingenious in torturing is Fate, Providence, or by what name so-ever people call it.

There was a choking sensation in her throat ; her eyes were misty ; she felt that the least move ment would make them overflow ; her hands were clenched under her cloak.

His perception was not very acute : it was enough for him that she laughed and talked.

How she wished that he would talk to her of his past ! She knew now why that shadow had crossed his face when she expressed the wish to have been born a Roman Catholic. Then she fell to wondering what sort of life he lived ; in what he found consolation for the wretchedness he must suffer ; cut off from, disappointed in all he loved.

The next morning she awoke dispirited and out of sorts, with the sense of every thing being ' stuffed with sawdust,' which occasionally oppresses mortals in their first moments of waking. Happy they when it is only moments \u2014 not hours ! It was a fine morning, and she ordered the victoria, went shopping, and returned to luncheon in a much more cheerful vein.

As the door closed on the defeated and disappointed youth, Pauline gave a little sigh of relief. The Colonel was enchanted. He inter preted the action entirely in his own favour, and his wrathful feeling towards his young ensign evaporated. ' He's not a bad lad,' he remarked, tak ing a chair near her ladyship. ' Wants the conceit taken out of him a bit.' ' Yes,' said Pauline vaguely, as though she had not bestowed any thought on the matter. As indeed she had not.

He said he kept a shop, but his wife minded that, as he was chiefly occupied in going about for Ralph. It seems he won't go into slums and places himself on principle, but when he hears of any bad case, or reads it in the papers, or when people beg of him in the streets, he sends Smith to look them up, and report, and, if they are genuine, he helps them.

' That,' said Pauline reflectively, ' is why, though he is sad, he is not bitter, and does not abuse- the world.' ' Why should he abuse the world ?' asked Lynden briskly. ' It's a very good world.' ' Do you think so ?' she asked. ' I don't. I think it is a bad, miserable world.' ' Good Heavens, my lady ! Who would have thought to hear such a sentiment from you?

But, to be quite candid, I really think you ought to have put dinner before the charming women.' ' Because one enjoys their society more after it ?' asked the Colonel laughing, and declining to be disconcerted. ' Perhaps,' she said smiling, and then becoming suddenly grave again.

Then she walked to the window and looked out. ' Would you,' she observed, in a courte ous voice, as she came back to him, ' think me a very rude, inhospitable woman if I were to tell you that the victoria has been at the door for an hour, and that at this very moment I am due two miles off ?'

She had resolved to try to live on happier terms with her husband, and the moment of his return a fresh feud broke out. He was taken aback by her silence ; her scorn and anger were apt to fly forth as the spark when flint and steel strike. Was there really something between her and Gray ? Gathering fresh force from her silence, his lordship continued : ' You will be good enough to understand that he does not enter these doors again.

After a few moments, the natural energy of her character revived. She was not wont to give up the battle so soon \u2014 should she, where she felt it a matter of vital concern, yield without a struggle ? Slowly she rose and walked towards her husband's room.

Nina would be furious if Pauline cut her. If he allowed Gray to come when he liked, she would not be able to make any objec tion to inviting Nina. Pauline went to bed thoroughly un happy.

' If Mrs. Grevil likes to bring her, she can ; I would rather not write to her.'

This time last Sunday, there would have seemed nothing in the party to-night to shock or offend her. She was not in the least jealous of her husband. She would, in all probability, have flirted cheerfully enough with Colonel Lynden. Now a feeling of cold disap proval swayed her. The pronounced flirta tion between the other pairs offended her sense of dignity and decorum. She in wardly resented a familiarity of manner which Colonel Lynden, finding himself in jovial and not too straight-laced company, adopted. After dinner, the other two couples retired to some distance from the chimney-corner where her ladyship sat as usual, and Lynden drew a low chair beside her, and essayed his best to draw her into a flirtation.

But it soon became evident to him that he was wasting his time. Pauline strove to be agreeable, though she felt in no happy mood, but she made it perfectly evident to the Colonel that she had no intention of following suit to the other ladies present. He was disappointed. He had a sense of injury, and left early, in spite of his host's entreaties.

She came in from her drive at a quarter to five the following day, that she might be ready to receive him, and she told the butler that she would not be at home to anyone except Sir Ralph Gray. She said it without the least hesitation or awkward ness ; without any reflection as to what he might think of the order.

' Do I look happy ?' asked Pauline. ' Well,' smiling, 'I am just at this moment. Come and sit here \u2014 or is it too near the fire?' ' No, I am frozen. I got thoroughly chilled on my journey up.' 'Have you had a pleasant visit ?' asked Pauline, as she poured out tea and flitted about, forbidding him to help her. ' Pleasant does not exactly describe it.

But come, are you not sur prised ? You were quite sure I should not want to renew the conversation, and here I am precisely in the same mood and ready to take it up where we left it.

' I have no doubt,' he said diffidently, that your own poor in the country are very well cared for. The good little girl with her basket,' smiling, ' would not be likely to forget the traditions of her youth.' Pauline's face grew dark and sad. ' Ah!' she uttered, in a low voice, look ing away from him, ' that is the worst of it \u2014 they are not cared for. That was one of the first things that Lester and I quar relled about.

A sense of shame and sorrow swept over her ; her companion read her face plainly enough. He was troubled \u2014 he scarcely knew what to say. At last, after a pause, he uttered, ' It is a pity. It would have been such an interest to you.' ' Of course, we give away a certain amount of coals and soup and clothing in the winter,' said Pauline dejectedly ; ' but what is that ? For shame's sake one must do that.

' We shall be a quiet party ; but, if you've nothing better to do, we shall be delighted to see you.' Sir Ralph hesitated and glanced at her ladyship. She did not speak, but a look of eloquent entreaty came into her eyes, and made him feel that of all things he should like to accept this invitation. Still he hesitated. 'You are very good,' he said.

Sir Ralph, glancing again at her, and being quite assured by the expression of her face that her silence was not dictated by lack of acquiescence in her husband's invitation, answered that, if they would have him on those terms, he accepted gladly. Then he took his hat and prepared to depart. Lester preceded him to the door, and went on downstairs. ' Stay,' whispered Pauline, detaining her guest for a moment.

And,' \u2014 following him to the stairs \u2014 'do not forget to send me the address of those poor people. When we meet again, I shall have made their acquaintance.' This time Sir Ralph left the house with mixed feelings. What a lovely, charming creature she was, and, under other circum stances, what a noble nature she might have developed !

Although he did not once meet the eyes of his hostess, Sir Ralph observed her also, and felt glad that, in spite of what she had told him of her scepticism, she was profoundly rever ent in manner, and looked as though her thoughts were fixed upon her devotions. At luncheon plans were made for the afternoon.

' But, as a matter of fact, I do not go very often.' ' And what do you think of our Vicar ?' ' He is well-meaning,' said Sir Ralph. ' But utterly incompetent as a preacher?' suggested Pauline. ' Well, yes. I am afraid no other ver dict is possible.

' I believe,' he said, ' that in every age, religion has been the outcome of misery \u2014 of the need of consolation for the woes and ills of life. Men have looked round and seen that there was no remedy in this world for their intolerable wretchedness, and so have sought relief from the present in the hope of a future. They left their belief as a legacy to those who came after them \u2014 to the wretched and happy alike. If life were happy, there would be no necessity for religion. Its real mission is to comfort. Whilst people are happy, healthy, and prosperous, they feel little need of it. But in trouble, the believers"], [185, "A Tale of Society. 177 in religion fly to it for comfort, and those who have, most unhappily for them, lost their faith, still yearn after it, knowing that it could still comfort them, if they could still believe it.' ' Yes, that is true,' murmured Pauline. ' There are times of anguish,' Sir Ralph went on, ' when I think the veriest sceptic cries out, \"Oh, God, help me! God have mercy upon me !\" And for women, who by Nature are framed to lean, to trust, to depend, I can think of nothing in the world so sad as the condition of one without a faith, without a God.' ' Ah,' said Pauline, turning to him with brimming eyes, ' but I do believe in God.' ' My dear child,' he interrupted, ' I was not thinking of you. God forbid that I should be.'

At this moment the horsemen from the Court came upon them at a turning, and Pauline pulled her cobs into a walk. The two gentlemen rode alongside them for a few minutes. When they parted com pany, it was in front of some dilapidated cottages, or rather hovels. ' Those,' said Pauline, turning to Sir Ralph, and speaking with a bitter inflec tion of voice \u2014 'those are part of our property. They are a crying disgrace to us, are they not?' and she looked at him with an expression of shame and humilia tion in her eyes. He was silent. Apart from his natural kindness of heart, he was a man of the world, and had a great objection to telling"], [187, "A Tale of Society. 179 unpalatable truths, or to finding fault with his friends. ' You need not be afraid to agree with me,' uttered Pauline. ' The fact is obvious enough.'

' I should doubt it,' she answered, shak ing her head. ' Do you ever go inside any of them ?' asked Sir Ralph, in the tone of a casual questioner. ' No. I am ashamed.' ' Why do you not ?

'But, my dear lady, you must forgive me if I don't think that reason quite sufficient to prevent your giving help where it is badly wanted.' ' There is a stronger reason !' said Paul ine.

I had the pug and the fox-terrier with me. \" Oh, I say,\" said one boy to another, \" don't you wish you 'ad 'is dinner every day !\" Another speculated on the terrier's capacity for killing rats, and suggested a sum of money that his father might be induced to give for him.

Lester and Mrs. Grevil had not come back, and, indeed, did not present themselves until an hour later. The evening passed off as well as the previous one.

The next morning at breakfast, when plans were being discussed for the day, she proposed to Sir Ralph that they should drive in the morning, as the days were so short; and later she whispered to him that in the afternoon, if he would accompany her, she meant to visit some of her poor neighbours on foot. Lord Lester and Mrs. Grevil arranged to walk in the morn ing and ride in the afternoon, and the barouche was ordered for the elder ladies and the General.

When Pauline came into the morning-room, she imagined that everyone had departed except her own companion. He was waiting for her in the window. The morning-room was curiously shaped. The embrasure of the window was so deep as to make almost a small room in itself : the door was on the same side as the win dow. Thus anyone entering would not be aware of the presence of those who might be in the window-seat until they were far enough in the room to look round the corner, unless they happened to glance into a long sheet of looking-glass which nearly faced the door.

Sir Ralph had the pres ence of mind to seize a book and drop it noisily on the floor. The next moment he and Lady Lester were alone ; the other pair had looked in the tell-tale mirror this time, and had seen her ladyship gazing out of the window and Sir Ralph, with his back to them, picking up a book. They went softly out. There was a long, long silence.

And at this, the tears rushed to her eyes, brimmed over, and fell fast into her lap. She rose, took one or two hurried turns in the room, brushing away her tears with her handkerchief. Then she came and stood beside Sir Ralph. ' I am a fool to be upset by this !' she said, in rather a hard tone.

Pauline looked steadfastly at him ' \" The heart knoweth its own bitter ness,\" ' she quoted. 'Ay,' he answered, with a deep sigh. ' If I told you,' she said, her voice fal tering a little, and her eyes looking past him at the cedar beyond ; ' if I told you that my one idea of happiness is love and sympathy ; that, without these, no gift which life can give seems worth hav ing in my eyes ; that it was to love I owed all the happiness of my young years, and that now, when I crave for it ten times more passionately than I did then, I crave in vain, what would you say to me about the duty of being happy?

She was not going to tell him anything that he could not bear to hear. Pauline, who was as much of a thought-reader as people with sympathetic natures usually are, said, with a faint smile, ' Do not be afraid ! ' No,' he replied heartily. ' I am not. She went on after a moment's pause, ' I said to myself that love was my due and right.

And I gained no thing but a feeling of humiliation and degradation, of utter contempt for the sex. Besides that, I made two or three bitter enemies of men who had misunder stood me, and hated me for having wound ed their vanity. So now I have forsworn the love of men.

He never spoke of his children except to very old and intimate friends \u2014 rarely then ; but he had a feeling of great tenderness and kindness for Pauline.

' I will tell you if you care to hear,' he said. ' I do care very much,' she replied. Sir Ralph passed his hand across his face for a moment; then, with rather a poor effort at a smile, he said, ' I must tell you one thing first.

We worshipped our children. My brother and father died, and we thought we saw our way to perfect happiness and prosperity. Then the blow fell. My poor wife \u2014 perhaps you have heard as much \u2014 was killed in that terrible railway accident, and I was so injured that I have never had a day's health since. And up to that time I did not know what sickness meant. I should have laughed to scorn pessimist views.

' Be thankful at least for those two excellent gifts,' he answered smiling. ' But your story,' interposed Pauline earnestly. ' Go on with that, if it does not hurt you too much.'

From day to day I never know how much deeper he may drag my name into the mire.' Sir Ralph paused. The lines in his face had deepened into an expression of agony.

' I will tell you all my story,' he said presently. '.There are times when, I think, the troubles of others comfort us.' ' Yes,' she answered softly. ' Tell me, if you can bear to do so.' She knew in part what was to follow. ' My daughter became all in all to me. She had the sweetest, most affectionate disposition in the world. She was bright and clever, and she was lovely. I wrap ped all my heart round her. She almost consoled me for my misery about her brother. When she was seventeen, we were wintering on the Riviera for my health.

An old brother officer came to our hotel. He and I had been great friends in the regiment, but for"], [212, "204 Omnia Vanitas : years I had seen scarcely anything of him. A vague rumour had reached me that he had married badly, but \u25a0 that he and his wife were separated.

Of course I promised. He became our constant companion \u2014 spent hours with me when I was well enough to see anyone ; read to me ; talked to me, (he was one of the most agreeable men I ever met) \u2014 planned little excur sions, and seemed to devote himself to our amusement. Violet was constantly with us, and he treated her as he might have done had he been my brother. Three months passed delightfully. Then one morning I received an anonymous letter asking me if I knew that he was a mar ried man, and that he was seen constantly"], [213, "A Tale oj Society. 205 with my daughter in retired spots, whilst her governess remained at a discreet dis tance. At first I simply regarded the letter as a piece of malice or officiousness, and attached little importance to it. I had such confidence in him. But it made me observe Violet carefully, particularly when he was present, and it soon dawned upon me that the poor child was attracted to him in a way that I had not dreamed of before. I made up my mind at once what to do, little foreseeing the result. At dinner one evening, when she and her governess only were present, I alluded to (I won't mention his name, I will call him Blank) ; Blank's marriage. Violet turned deathly white, and then fell back in her chair in a dead faint. Later in the evening, I elicited from her governess, with many tears, that the statement of my anonymous correspondent was practic ally true. Miss Wood was aware, she"], [214, "206 Omnia Vanitas : said, of his devotion to Violet, and her attachment to him, and, believing him to be unmarried, heir to an earldom, and desirable in every way, she had thought she was not only doing no harm, but the reverse in allowing them to meet.

' But he wrote to you \u2014 he tried to ex plain matters, I suppose?' asked Pauline. ' No word ever passed between us from that day to this. There are wrongs too deep for words. If I had been a hale, strong man, I should probably have tried to punish him \u2014 I was a miserable invalid.

And so,' Sir Ralph ended, rising and looking out of the win dow, and speaking in so deeply moved a voice that it broke Pauline's heart to hear it, ' of those two beings in whom my life was centred, who were to console me for all my misfortunes, whose lives I had strained every nerve to make prosperous"], [216, "208 Omnia Vanitas : and happy, one is lost to me utterly ; the other hates me and longs for my death.' He stopped, and there was a profound silence. What could Pauline say in face of such griefs as these ! She looked at him with yearning eyes, but her voice could find no words. The intention with which he had spoken was fulfilled. He had raked up these burning memories to mitigate her sense of wrong ; he judged well that, when a humau heart suffers, the surest balm is to hear of the agony that others have endured. The dusk was creeping on. He turned to her, not misinterpreting her silence ; understanding full well that, because she found no words, her heart was all the fuller of sympathy. ' It will be too late for your visits now, I am afraid,' he said, in his usual voice. ' Yes,' she answered rising. ' Let us go and have a walk instead.'"], [217, "A Tale of Society. 209 And they went out together. Pauline had almost forgotten the episode which had been so bitter an hour ago \u2014 it seemed to have lost all importance in her eyes. Her naturally kind heart was animated by one wish \u2014 to make her companion feel how much she sympathised with him ; how gladly she would alleviate his bitter, lonely lot if she might. Great as her regard for him was before, it had grown tenfold in this little time ; she had a feel ing of love, of kindness, of tenderness for him which she had perhaps never known before, and the nearest approach to which had been her affection for Mary Dunstan. It was the love of a friend \u2014 so different from the love of a lover, though perhaps not less sweet in its own way, and more likely to prove lasting. She felt that he had made this sacrifice for her, and she determined that it should not be in vain. r"], [218, "210 Omnia Vanitas : As they were nearing the house on their return, she said, ' It was very good of you to tell me about your sorrow.

A glow of admiration shot through his breast as he recognised her generous nature, and thought, under different aus pices, what a different woman she might have been. ' My dear child,' he said warmly, ' you are so right. Bear what you must and make it lighter by trying to forget and forgive. Who knows what you may ac complish in time by forbearance !'

Later in the evening, she whispered to his lordship, ' They both saw, but she has concluded to take no notice. I suppose, as they have their own little game, she means to let things slide.' Lester frowned. It by no means pleased him to think that his wife should follow his example; and, according to the evil of his own mind, he drew a bad augury from her silence about his misdemeanour, and assumed a biting, disagreeable manner to her, as though he were the injured person. ' Pauline,' said Mrs. Chichester the next day, ' I do not like Mrs. Grevil, and I think Lester's manner to her is objectionably familiar.

Sir Ralph is no doubt a very good sort of man, though I have been quite unable to elicit what his religious convictions are ; but I certainly think your great intimacy with him, though perfectly harmless, no doubt, gives a handle to Lester to flirt openly with that objec tionable woman.' ' My dear mother,' answered Pauline, ' I think it is useless to discuss the matter. Lester will do as he chooses, and my only refuge is in cultivating the society of a man who is in every way the most desir able friend I could possibly have.' ' You must not forget how the world judges,' remarked Mrs. Chichester stiffly. ' I do not forget how it misjudges,' an swered Pauline.

IR RALPH and Mrs. Grevil had left the Court \u2014 the rest of the party remained. Lester and his brother hunted nearly every day, and Pauline's time was very much at her own disposal. Her friendship with Sir Ralph had pro duced a marked alteration in her tone of thought and general manner; if she still felt oppressed by the sadness of life, she was not so hopeless as formerly, since she was thoroughly converted to the doctrine that by helping others one may alleviate one's own sorrows, and create an object in life."], [224, "Omnia Vanitas : 216 Without telling any member of her family, she took to visiting the cottages on the estate. She went on foot, simply dressed, and in the most unostentatious manner, and she talked to the women about themselves and their children, and listened to the history of their troubles and sufferings with real interest. Few among them ventured to ask for anything \u2014 they had been taught the uselessness of complaining long ago. Pauline found that, without entering upon any question of rebuilding, or spending much money, there was a great deal she could do to mitigate the hardship of their present condition \u2014 the rest would come by and by. She shrank from quarrelling or dis puting with her husband \u2014 she wanted to live at peace with him. What she felt for him could scarcely be called affection, but she did earnestly desire that they should live on friendly terms. Sir Ralph,"], [225, "A Tale of Society. 217 who loved to be a peace-maker, had said to her one day, ' If I were a charming woman, I should make it a point of honour to win my husband's regard aud esteem, even if I could not command his heart, though, in deed, I should make a great effort for that.' Pauline never expected to conquer Les ter's heart \u2014 I am not sure that she con sidered the possession valuable \u2014 but she was determined to make a great effort towards a better mutual understanding, and became much more forbearing and con ciliatory in her manner to him. Not being possessed of a generous soul, he did not give her credit for good inten tions, but ascribed the change in her to fear. He imagined that she was more or less in love with Sir Ralph, and wanted to propitiate him, in order that he should not interfere with her ' game,' as he called it."], [226, "Omnia Vanitas: 218 A trying time was in store for both of them. Lester had a fall in the hunting field, and broke his leg. He was an exceedingly bad patient, and, during the time that he was laid up, his temper was unbearable. Pauline, always full of sym pathy for anyone who suffered, exerted herself to the utmost to amuse him and beguile the tedious hours \u2014 she read to him ; played cards with him ; was always anxious to do anything to alleviate his suffering and uneasiness. In return, he was intensely ungracious, and, if Pauline had not schooled herself to patience, she would have found it difficult to endure his caprice and ill-humour. One day, when she had used her utmost endeavours to amuse him, he broke out into violent complaints of the boredom with which he was cursed. ' I wish to Heaven,' he exclaimed, ' that I could have some one about me who was"], [227, "A Tale of Society. 219 a bit cheerful. If Nina Grevil were here, I should not be so dull and wretched !' Pauline did not answer. She felt hurt, and indeed scarcely saw the propriety of asking Mrs. Grevil to come and nurse or amuse her husband. 'Why can't you ask her?' he went ou irritably. ' You can have Gray, if you choose.' ' I do not think,' Pauline said, trying to repress her feeling of contempt and anger, ' that you understand the nature of my feeling for Sir Ralph. It is the extreme regard and liking one has for a thoroughly good man whom one esteems and admires.' ' You may use fine terms for expressing it, if you choose, but, when a woman likes a man, it always means pretty much the same thing.' ' No,' replied Pauline firmly, ' it does not. A man and woman may like each other in a way that is wrong, and they"], [228, "220 Omnia Vanitas : may like each other in a way that is good and harmless, and which they, or one of them, at all events, is the better for.' ' I don't want to bandy words,' sneered Lester angrily. ' Will you write and ask Nina?' Pauline went to the window, and looked out. Then she came back, with a little flush on her face. 'I do not think you ought to ask me,' she said. ' It is not a fortnight since she was here, and I cannot pretend to con ceal from myself that you and she are on terms that friendship scarcely warrants.' He looked at her, prepared to make a bitter rejoinder, but something, whether in her face or his own mind, stopped him. ' I daresay, ' he observed presently, ' that it is a great pleasure to you to see me lying here helpless aud utterly wretched.' The taunt had its effect. A wave of"], [229, "A Tale of Society. 221 the old anger and recklessness swept over Pauline. ' I will write and ask her,' she said, in an icy voice, and left the room. What did anything matter? she said to herself as she went. She had not used that expression since she uttered it to Sir Ralph in the morning-room. Nothing could be more wounding to her pride than to send this invitation to Mrs. Grevil, knowing what she was, and feeling a thorough contempt for and distrust of her. And she had tried so hard to amuse Lester and to beguile his tedium, and had exercised almost superhuman patience with his caprices. Pauline wrote the letter and despatched it. But Mrs. Grevil had views of greater promise than keeping an invalid company, and wrote a very civil letter to her lady ship, expressing extreme regret that she could not return to the Court, and a very"], [230, "Omnia Vanitas .- 222 gushing and sympathetic one to his lord ship. He was deeply mortified, but en deavoured to conceal his annoyance, and was a trifle less bearish to Pauline for a day or two. This emboldened her to say a word in season about her poor, but it proved to be desperately out of season, as Lester put himself into a rage, and refused to discuss the matter. Pauline was deter mined to bide her time. When he was well, there should be a new arrangement of affairs ; she would have her money more under her own control, and she would no longer be burdened with the responsi bility of duties left flagrantly undone. They had intended to remain a month at the Court, but it had lengthened into two ; the end of February had arrived before they returned to London. Time would indeed have hung heavy on Paul ine's hands if it had not been for her new interest, and, as it was, she felt a severe"], [231, "A Tale of Society. 223 sense of oppression and ennui. She longed immensely to see Sir Ralph again ; she felt that her new resolves and intentions were not yet strong enough to stand alone ; she suffered from the reaction that generally follows after oue has taken up a thing impulsively. But Sir Ralph was in the South of France. He had been attacked by bronchitis after his visit to the Court, and his doctor had sent him off to warmer climes. He and Pauline corresponded, but writing is not the same thing as talking. Pauline had taken a pet at the world. She had cried ' Cui bonoT and had replied to herself that there was no good. The only consolation she could hope to find henceforth was living for others.

Pauline was surprised and rather shock ed, on her return to London, to find that the world was not quite such a hollow mockery as she had believed it down in the country. After her seclusion, she en tered with considerable enjoyment into the gaieties that were just then abundant. After her grave and serious views, after the dulness and solitude of the Court, London seemed very bright and gay by contrast. She was warmly welcomed back to the enchanted circle, and her projects of improvement, the condition of her poor, though not forgotten, slipped a little away from the important place they had occu pied in her thoughts. She had been tell ing herself all this time that the world was a grievous wretched place, and she was surprised to find how delightful it could be, and how much pleasure there was yet to be got out of it."], [233, "A Tale of Society. 225 Still she was changed and for the better. She did not throw all her virtuous resolves to the winds, and she did not forget that she had made them ; but she felt so infi nitely brighter and happier that she was not very severe upon herself for taking life less seriously than she had intended. She was more forbearing with her hus band. If she made herself agreeable to men, she no longer flirted recklessly, and she did not permit herself the extravagances of yore. Instead of spending two hundred guineas on a Court dress which took her fancy, she, in remembrance of her poor, only gave the modest sum of eighty for one ; on two or three occasions she stop ped short when ordering some expensive article of attire. She even found time to visit Sir Ralph's proteges in Westminster, and the fact that these little acts of self denial made her more satisfied with her self, enhanced the worldly pleasures which Q"], [234, "226 Omnia Vanitas : she was liberally enjoying. Colonel Lyn den, of whom she saw a good deal, fre quently alluded laughingly to the change in her.

Did you go to G after all ; and what did he give you ? I should like to ask for the prescription, only I'm afraid it would not have the same effect on my poor used-up constitution.' Once now and then Pauline would be smitten by remorse \u2014 would regret her fading aspirations ; would feel that she was drifting away from the goal which she had set herself, and which she knew was the right and worthy one.

And,"], [235, "A Tale of Society. 227 meantime, if I can have a little enjoyment, Heaven knows my life has been bitter and sorrowful enough !' Still she wished that fate or accident had not taken Sir Ralph out of England just at the time when she felt the want of him most. Easter fell late this year. She and her lord were invited to spend it at a country house which had the reputation of being extremely cheery and pleasant. Both were agreed as to the desirability of accepting the invitation. It was a balmy spring afternoon when they arrived at Nonayme Park \u2014 indeed, more like premature summer thau spring. Pauline was in excellent spirits, and had agreeable anticipations of her visit. The party were all known to her except one, and of the unknown she had heard very contradictory reports. He therefore in spired a certain amount of curiosity in her breast. A few people spoke well of him ; Q 2"], [236, "228 Omnia Vanitas : there were many others who had nothing but terms of condemnation to apply to him. These went so far as to say that he was 'without principle where women were concerned.' On the other hand, almost every woman declared him to be perfectly charming. Pauline, in the character of an impartial and unbiassed observer, looked forward to forming her own opinion of Lord Charlton. She did not see him uutil he was brought up to take her in to dinner. The party was a large one \u2014 some neighbouring mag nates were included amongst the guests. Pauline's first feeling, when he was pre sented to her, was one of disappointment. There was nothing Don Juanesque in Lord Charlton's appearance. He was slight, rather tall than short, pale-complexioned and fair-haired, with a tinge of bronze, as from exposure to hot suns. His expres sion was somewhat careworn and fatigued ;"], [237, "A Tale of Society. 229 the chief characteristic in him which struck Pauline was his thoroughbred look. And, when he spoke, she was immediately aware that he had the most agreeable voice she had ever heard. He took a chair beside her \u2014 to talk standing up to a woman sitting down was, according to his theory, a situation of gene for both, preventing the utterance of anything more than the baldest common place. ' It is strange that we have never met before,' he said \u2014 ' I have heard of you so often.' ' And I of you,' replied Pauline graci ously, feeling attracted to him from the first moment that he opened his lips ; his voice neutralising any disappointment she might have felt at his appearance. ' But you have been out of England, have you not?' ' Yes, for a year, and the year before I went very little into society.'"], [238, "230 Omnia Vanitas : ' And before that,' said Pauline, ' I was ill for a long time \u2014 at the point of death, in fact.' ' I remember hearing of it,' said Lord Charlton. ' But now \u2014 I need not ask if you have perfectly recovered.' He looked at her, and she observed that, although his eyes were not in themselves remarkable for any great beauty, they had immense capabilities of expression, and were exceedingly agreeable to meet. ' I am quite well now,' she answered smiling, and rising at the same moment, for the pilgrimage to the dining-room had commenced. ' Life without health is not worth having, is it ?' ' I should think not. Fortunately I have had no experience of life under that trving circumstance.' ' Then you have been happy,' she said. He repeated the word after her. His tone was reflective \u2014 she did not quite gather"], [239, "A Tale of Society. 231 what he meant to imply, and, at that mo ment, they took their seats at the table. Pauline allowed her companion to eat his soup in peace. ' Where are you from last ?' she asked, when he had finished. ' I have been a month in Paris. Before that I was a month on the Riviera, after my return from India.' 'Did you meet Sir Ralph Gray in the South of France ?' said Pauline eagerly. 'No. I heard of his being there, but I did not come across him. I used to know him years ago. Is he a friend of yours ?' ' The greatest friend I have in the world,' Pauline answered, with kindling eyes. ' Really ! You have known him a long time, then?' ' No ; indeed I have not. Is it neces sary to know a person a long time to be come great friends with him?'"], [240, "232 Omnia Vanitas : And Pauline turned to Charlton, and smiled. He met her eyes. ' No,' he said. ' I think two people may know in five minutes that they are going to be life-long friends.' What a delightful voice he had ! Paul ine felt that she had never before realised how strong was the power of attraction. She could not have told how or why it was, but she was conscious that no one had ever produced on her such a sudden and agreeable influence as Lord Charlton. ' I knew Ralph years ago,' he went on, ' when he was the cheeriest fellow and the keenest sportsman out. They tell me he is utterly changed \u2014 as solemn as an owl, and spends his time in visiting hospitals, and that sort of thing.' ' He is not at all solemn,' answered Pauline. ' He is as good as gold. But, of course, his dreadful troubles have told upon him.'"], [241, "A Tale of Society. 233 ' Has he had dreadful troubles ?' ' Ah ! indeed,' replied Pauline significant ly. Then, as she was about to say more, she checked herself, feeling instinctively how much he would dislike to have his affairs canvassed. ' Poor old Ralph !' uttered Lord CharL ton sympathetically. He seemed to under stand and respect her silence. ' Are you glad to be back in England ?' she asked. ' But of course you are. There is no place like England.' ' The land of prejudice and pretty women,' said her companion. His words set Pauline thinking. The land of prejudice? Did he mean to imply that he had been the victim of prejudice? What had she heard about him ? She could not recall any actual circumstance\u2014 she only remembered that, whenever his name had been mentioned, she had received the impression that there"], [242, "234 Omnia Vanitas : was something unfavourable to him in the general mind. Pauline felt instinctively that he had been maligned. She did not profess to be a judge of character, but she made up her mind from Charlton's voice and eyes that there was nothing really wrong about him \u2014 it was probable that he was the victim of others' faults or sins. She had time to thiuk all this, though there was scarcely any perceptible pause between his remark and her rejoinder. 'Your words have not a patriotic ring,' she said. ' And yet, I am sure, you must love your country. It is a crime in my eyes for an Englishman not to feel he is the most privileged being in the world.' ' I am something of a cosmopolitan,' he answered, smiling at her enthusiasm, and observing keenly how it added to her beauty. ' But I admit the enormous ad vantage of being born an Englishman.' 'And,' said Pauline, with a tinge of"], [243, "A Tale of Society. 235 disappoinment, ' do you not feel home sick when you are away ? To me, the very word home means so much, even when ' She stopped short. ' Home,' remarked Charlton, after a mo ment's pause, ' means something different to my mind from your conception of it. It is neither a habitation nor a place. In what part of the globe soever I met a nature kindred and sympathetic to mine \u2014 entirely in unison with mine \u2014 I would make my home there. It is in my soul only that I feel the want of a home. Physically, any place where I can breathe fresh air and feel myself free, is the same to me.' His words struck Pauline. Her heart echoed to them. Perfect sympathy with a kindred nature. Yes, that was enough to make happiness, irrespective of all other circumstances. Her lip trembled. The"], [244, "236 Omnia Vanitas : old yearning after the unknown good swept over her for an instant. Then she came back from the empyrean to the common-place. ' Are you a dreamer of dreams ?' she asked, with a slight vibration in her voice. ' Do you believe it possible that you will ever meet in this world that other half of yourself which it is supposed was created with, and for you ?' ' Yes,' he answered, fixing his eyes upon her, ' I do. It is a pretty fancy. Why should it not be true ?' 'Ah,' said Pauline sadly. ' Why ? Why should happiness never be a realisable good, or a truth to be depended upon ? Things are not destined to go smoothly here. Even if two thoroughly sympathe tic natures came together, extraneous cir cumstances would interfere to make a discord of their harmony.' ' I wish,' said Charlton musingly, ' that"], [245, "A Tale of Society. 237 we were offered the incentive of a reason able Heaven. Cannot you imagine,' and he dropped his voice, so as to be audible to Pauline only, ' even from your earthly experience, the possibility of so great hap piness that, to gain it, you would be content to live a life of self-abnegation, even of wretchedness here ? Have you never dreamed of a Paradise made of earthly joys, where weariness and satiety were not allowed to enter?' ' I think,' answered Pauline reflectively, ' that I should have considered it rather profane to connect earthly joys with Heaven.' ' Yet,' said Charlton, ' one can only judge by a standard that one knows. And I would ask no greater bliss than a continuation of joys and pleasures of which I have had some foretaste here.' ' You have been very happy then at some time ?' Pauline asked, with rather a wistful gaze."], [246, "238 Omnia Vanitas : 'I have,' he answered, with conviction. ' I have had only one cause for regret \u2014 that happiness was so fleeting. But, en revanche, I have suffered horribly too.' ' Ah !' uttered Pauline, and looked at him, longing to hear of the joys and sorrows of his life. ' I should like,' she said, ' to hear your idea of a Heaven to be created out of this world. For my part, I hardly think the materials good enough.' ' I will tell you,' he answered But here the hostess rose. 'Presently,' he whispered, as he drew back her chair ; and she smiled at him, saying, ' Do not forget.' There was to be dancing to-night, and a contingent from a couple of neighbour ing houses was expected after dinner. Pauline did not feel in a mood to talk with anyone but her late companion, and"], [247, "A Tale of Society. 239 seated herself in a low chair by a table of photographs. The other women were talking in groups or pairs. Pauline's attention was arrested by the sound of Charlton's name. 'Have you ever heard him sing?' one asked of another. ' He has a divine voice.' ' No,' was the rejoinder. ' I did not even know that he sang.' ' Nothiug will induce him to sing before people \u2014 no one presumes to ask him now. Sometimes he will favour a select little audi ence of two or three, or, better still, one.' The other lady laughed. ' Yes,' she echoed, ' one would, I suppose, suit him best.' ' Apropos,' rejoined her companion, ' what about the Disney affair ?' The answer was given in a whisper. Pauline rose with a sensation of ruffled plumes. She felt au instinct of anger against these women for traducing her"], [248, "240 Omnia Vanitas : new acquaintance, and was at the same time conscious of the absurdity and unrea sonableness of her vexation. Why should she champion an utter stranger, even to herself? It was because she had a con viction that he was a maligned and mis understood man \u2014 that somehow in life he had been made a scapegoat for sins and follies not his own. His heart was true, she would swear \u2014 no man could have such eyes and such a voice and be false. She could fancy he might be weak, capable of being led through his heart, his affections, his sensitiveness, but as far removed from the type of Lothario as the sun from the stars. She had known him two hours, and she felt she would trust him as she could Sir Ralph. The men were not long in joining the ladies, and the whole party repaired to the ball-room. Charlton asked Lady Lester to dance."], [249, "A Tale of Society. 241 She was a perfect dancer, and she thought she knew all the pleasure that was capable of being extracted from a valse. But, when she and Charlton were floating to gether down the polished floor, she was conscious that everything is a matter of degree, and that at this moment she was realising the highest phase of pleasure which this delicious exertion afforded. ' This,' said Charlton, as they paused, ' is one of the earthly joys which should help to make my Paradise ;' and Pauline answered dreamily, ' Yes \u2014 indeed.' Two men were lounging in the doorway. ' Charlton is at the old game, I see,' said one. ' Yes,' replied the other. ' But this time it will be \"diamond cut diamond.\" She is a thorough-paced flirt.' The last speaker was Graham, who had come over with a party from another house. E"], [250, "Omnia Vanitas: 242 CHAPTER XL Kfi^HE valse was over, and Pauline and (|Ug Lord Charlton went into the long conservatory. It was charmingly arranged \u2014 low chairs, paired as carefully as those beneath the trees in Kensington Gardens, were placed under palms and flowering shrubs ; the disposition of them was so in viting, yet so discreet, that it suggested a more delicate hand than that of the Scotch gardener. The hostess herself was handsome, and still comparatively young, and it was understood that she was not averse from admiration, although scandal took no liber ties with her name.

Several pairs were availing themselves of the semi-privacy of this delightful retreat, for the seats were placed at a sufficient distance from each other to give an agree able sense of solitude. But it was almost too early in the evening for flirtation of a serious character, and the couples, after remaining a few minutes, returned to the ball-room. Never had Pauline's thoughts been fur ther removed from flirting than to-night. She felt a deep interest in Charlton ; his voice and person were exceedingly agree able to her ; she wondered now that she had been so little impressed by his appear ance when he was first presented to her. He regarded her as one of the loveliest and most charming women he had ever met. It was strange that he had never e2"], [252, "244 Omnia Vanitas : come across her before ; but he did not regret this, being enough of a philosopher to know that the beginning of most things is better than the end. She was not only lovely, but she was different from most of the women he had known. ' Tell me,' she said, ' about your Para dise made from earthly joys.' ' I am in Paradise at this moment,' he answered. He did not speak in the voice of a man paying a compliment ; had he done so, his words would have seemed banal and even vulgar \u2014 he was simply saying what he felt. ' A sense of repose,' he continued, ' when every object around you is in harmony with your taste and feeling, is one of the greatest elements of earthly happiness. Close your eyes and open them again ! does not this scene please them ? \u2014 is not the sound of the falling water harmonious to your ear ?

But in five minutes, ten at the furthest, I must leave Paradise,' \u2014 smiling \u2014 ' and return to the ball-room, where the noise and heat and laughter will jar upon my present frame of mind.' * Why should you go back to the ball room,' said Charlton, ' if, as you say. you are well here ?' ' Because,' answered Pauline gaily, ' even if I were setting you a sum of mental arithmetic, or you were reading the Bible to me, or we were both making plans for the welfare of the poor, the people in there,' making a little gesture with her"], [254, "Omnia Vanitas: 246 fan, ' would take our characters away, and say we were flirting, and would look scan dalised at us. Public opinion is against this phase of your earthly Paradise.' ' There should be no public opinion in my heavenly Paradise,' returned Charlton. ' Everyone should be too happy to concern himself with the affairs of others \u2014 or, better still, an universal sympathy should animate every breast, and make the happi ness of others a pleasure to witness instead of a, mortification, as it is for the most part here.' ' Tell me more of your earthly bliss,' said Pauline. ' There is music,' replied Charlton, ' Do you know of anything like a perfect human voice, or a well-played violin, for making the heart vibrate with every sensation ?' ' I am told,' said Pauline, interrupting him, ' that you sing.' He made a gesture of assent."], [255, "A Tale of Society. 247 'But that you will not sing to an audience.' 'I hate to make a mountebank of my self, and every man who sings to a room full of people does so more or less. If I am ever so fortunate as to be alone in a room with you and a piano, it will give me the greatest pleasure to sing to you, if you care to listen.' ' I shall arrange that we find ourselves alone with a piano,' rejoined Pauline. ' We will make a point of it.' ' Dancing is included in my scheme of happiness,' pursued Charlton. 'Dancing under such conditions as I enjoyed to- night.' ' With all my heart !' acquiesced Pauline. ' And hunting. Is there anything more exhilarating than flying over the ground at the top-most speed of a good horse\u2014 the air blowing in one's face, and every nerve alive with excitement ?'"], [256, "248 Omnia Vanitas: ' I have lost my nerve for riding,' said Pauline. ' That could not happen in my Paradise,' smiled Charlton. ' There are plenty more pleasures to be borrowed from the known. A play that moves one, a book that carries one out of one's self; intimate talk with a friend, or even an agreeable stranger \u2014 are not all these things, if you take the best specimen of each that you have known and admitting no drawbacks, ele ments worthy to make a real and satis fying Heaven ? I have left the very best until last. And the very best is love.' His voice sank. Something in the tone of it made a chord in Pauline's heart vibrate. He spoke dreamily, as if he were thinking of some past time. ' To love without doubt or fear; to have always the companionship of one whose mere presence can add a thousandfold to every joy ; to stretch out your hand, and"], [257, "A Tale of Society. 249 clasp one whose touch sends a magic pleasure through every vein ; to look into eyes whose glance alone intoxicates like strong wine !' Pauline closed her eyes for a moment. A deep sigh almost rent her breast. ' Is my Heaven good enough for you ?' said Charlton, in a low voice. She roused herself, and in a moment was standing upright, uttering a forced little laugh. ' It is too good,' she answered ; ' too good to be true. You should not make life more bitter by holding out impossible possibilities.' ' But if it were possible ?' he said, rising too. ' Then,' said Pauline, raising her eyes to the palm towering above her, ' I would renounce and forego all pleasure in this life to attain to the one beyond.' Charlton smiled."], [258, "250 Omnia Vanitas: ' So would I,' he rejoined. ' But, as there is no certainty of that, the only thing left us is to enjoy as best we may what the gods throw in our way now.' Pauline moved towards the ball-room, and he followed her. As they reached it, the strains of an enchanting valse fell on their ears. Their eyes met, and, without another word of invitation or acceptance, Charlton put his arm round her, and they joined the dancers. When it was over, Graham came up, and asked her to dance, and she complied. Ever since the unfortunate episode which introduced Lady Lester to the reader, she had felt a compulsion to be civil and even kind to him. But his presence was dis agreeable to her. It reminded her of an act of her life of which she was ashamed. He had presumed somewhat upon it, and occasionally made bitter jests about her heartlessness and her coquetries. There"], [259, "A Tale of Society. 251 was nothing in him. He was a good looking, empty-headed young fellow, with no pretensions to mind, and a good deal of needless vanity. Pauline found the change from Charlton to Graham most distasteful. It was the reverse of the picture which invariably spoiled life, and made that imaginary Heaven unrealisable. Graham was in a chaffing frame of mind, and his loud voice struck unpleasantly on Pauline's ear after the well-modulated, harmonious tones of her late companion. She felt ill-dis posed towards him. Her manner was cold, and intimated that she was bored. Graham saw, and resented it. ' I'm afraid I made a mistake in inter rupting you and Charlton,' he said, pre tending to jest, but looking and feeling very much in earnest. ' One can't hope to compete with a fellow like that. He has only to look at a woman !'"], [260, "252 Omnia Vanitas : 'Really!' observed her ladyship, in a freezing tone. 'Yes, really!' replied the young man defiantly. 'And, if you do not want to be talked about, I would advise you not to sit out in conservatories or places with him. I tell you as a friend.' Lady Lester's eyes lightened. ' There is a limit, Mr. Graham,' she remarked, ' where friendliness ceases, and officious impertinence begins.' ' Oh, all right,' returned Graham, in a nettled tone. ' Sorry I spoke. I beg your ladyship's pardon. Shall we go on dancing ?' The rest of the evening was unsatisfac tory and displeasing to Pauline. And it had commenced so delightfully. She did not dance with Charlton again, nor did he approach her. Each time she looked for him amongst the dancers, but he was not of them. Once, when she went into the"], [261, "A Tale of Society. 253 conservatory with her partner, she saw him leaning back in the chair where he had sat with her, evidently in one of the contemplative moods to which he had referred. ' Just like that selfish brute Charlton,' said her companion, ' to be sitting in the best place in the whole conservatory alone, and keeping other people out of it !' Pauline made no answer. When the guests were gone, and she was alone in her room, she sat thinking until daylight. A feeling of oppression and disappointment stole over her \u2014 she knew not why. Life was so unsatisfac tory, the little glimpses that one sometimes got of happiness only made the ordinary common-placeness of it more accentuated. That Charlton possessed a magnetic at traction for her she was aware \u2014 she had even an intuition that it would not be well for her to see much of him. An immense"], [262, "Omnia Vanitas: 254 curiosity possessed her on his account ; she wanted to know the history of his life. She was convinced that whatever the world might say, however it might judge him, the wrong was not with him. If there were circumstances in his life for which it blamed him, he had been a victim, not a criminal. Perhaps there was a wo man in the case \u2014 what more probable than that a man with aspirations such as his, with a nature that demanded sympathy as the mainspring of life, should have loved, perhaps ' not wisely, but too well ' ? And the woman \u2014 what of her ? Pauline went to the window and looked out. The country lay hushed in perfect stillness ; only a few birds were astir ; the light was waxing mellower and brighter as the sun appeared above the horizon. She sighed, turned away, and, a few min utes later, was asleep. When she awoke, the sun was high in"], [263, "A Tale of Society. 255 the heavens, the birds were shouting p\u00e6ans of praise in his honour, a delicious breeze was stealing in through the open window. A feeling of exhilaration came to Pauline \u2014 a lovely day spent in pleasant company offered a most agreeable prospect. Everyone at breakfast seemed in equally good spirits ; the hostess proposed a pic nic, as the weather was so warm and fair, and the suggestion was greeted with una nimous approval. Two hours later, Paul ine and Lady Nonayme were en route in her ladyship's barouche, accompanied by Lord Charlton and another man. The host drove the rest of the party in his break. ' How merciful of you to give me a place, Lady Nonayme !' said Charlton. ' If there is one thing I abhor, it is sitting sideways. I defy anyone to enjoy the loveliest scenery in the world under that circumstance.'"], [264, "256 Omnia Vanitas: His remark was made with an arriere pense'e, to prevent his seat being given to another guest on the way home. 'You are quite right,' said Lady No nayme. ' I hate it too, and will remember and respect your prejudice.' The drive took an hour, but to Pauline it seemed less than a fourth part of that time. She was in her most radiant mood. Charlton caught the contagion of her spirits. The picnic was not quite a bond-fide one, as luncheon was served in a long, low room of a farm-house, a sensible arrange ment for April, in spite of its being June weather. The moment the feast was over, everyone paired off to visit the ruins, or to pick wild flowers in the wood. Charl ton and Pauline found themselves toge ther. They were some way behind the rest of the party, for Lady Lester had caught the lace of her dress on a nail"], [265, "A Tale of Society. 257 in the door, and the farmer's daughter came to the rescue with a needle and thread. Then they strolled into the wood, where wild flowers made a carpet for their feet, and the birds carolled joyful songs from the fulness cf blithe hearts. At the summit of a gentle ascent was a rudely cut bench, overlooking a lovely bit of rural English scenery. ' Let tis sit here !' said Charlton ; and Pauline complied. ' Another foretaste of Heaven,' he mur mured, with a smile. ' Confess that to day life is worth living ; that the sunshine and the scene before us, and the heavenly air are sufficient to make a Paradise.' ' I confess it,' answered Pauline, over whom a sense of entire enjoyment and satisfaction had stolen. 'Almost I am persuaded to forswear pessimism, and to agree that everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds. But I s"], [266, "258 Omnia Vanitas : must contradict one part of your pro position. Even all the delightful things you name are not sufficient to make Para dise.

' 1 daresay you have sometimes been, as I have, in company with barbarians, upon whom lovely scenery made no im pression, and who spoiled one's whole enjoyment by their stupid chatter.' ' 1 have often annoyed my husband,' said Pauline, ' by insisting on pointing out bits of scenery and \" glimpses \" when I have been driving with him. I suppose ' \u2014 smiling \u2014 ' that the appreciative person is as great a bore to the unappreciative as the latter is to the former.' ' Think,' said Charlton, in a low voice,"], [267, "A Tale of Society. 259 ' what life might be, spent with one whose moods and thoughts were all in sympathy with one's own !' ' Ah !' said Pauline, ' but that never hap pens.' And she heaved a deep sigh. ' It must happen sometimes, I fancy,' he returned. ' Then,' said Pauline gravely, as though stating an unanswerable fact, ' one of them dies.' ' Supposing,' observed Charlton, ' that it is impossible by the law that governs our circumstances to enjoy the life-long com panionship of a being in sympathy with us, may we not yet enjoy so much of it as chance, or fate, from time to time throws in our way'?' Pauline was looking into the distance. She knew that his eyes were fixed upon her. She read his meaning. A strange emotion filled her breast. She felt all the charm and all the danger of the position. s 2"], [268, "260 Omnia Vanitas : She knew that in her whole life no man had ever been capable of exercising the same influence over her as this man, who, but a few hours ago, was an utter stranger to her. In a moment, her thoughts went back to the time of which she had told Sir Ralph, when, in her loneliness and despair, she had said to herself that she would love, rightly or wrongly, if the man who could inspire the passion crossed her path. But she was not the same woman now as then \u2014 she no longer admitted to herself the possibility of love in her life. Her voice was steady as she answered him, still gazing intently into the distance. ' No. It would make every-day life too hard by contrast.' ' Perhaps you are right,' he replied, with a touch of sadness in his voice. ' And yet ' He did not finish his sentence, but Pauline finished it in her heart."], [269, "A Tale of Society. 261 ' Come,' she said, rising, ' let us go and see the ruins.' He obeyed her, and they walked on in silence. After a few moments, she said, with forced gaiety, ' We are spoiling the foretaste of Heaven by melancholy thoughts. Make an effort, and be in harmony with Nature.' ' Is Nature sad or happy ?' remarked Charlton, with a reflective air. ' I can never quite make up my mind.' ' Nature is a mirror,' answered Pauline. ' She reflects our moods. Just now she laughed, and then grew grave \u2014 we must make her laugh again.' ' When we get back,' said Charlton, with apparent irrelevancy, ' most of the party will probably play lawn-tennis. You were good enough last night to say you wished me to sing to you. Will you come into the morning-room, if we can get rid of the others?'"], [270, "Omnia Vanitas : 262 i ' I should like it more than anything,' Pauline replied. After that their conversation took a different turn\u2014 they talked gaily about things and people, and, as if by common consent, avoided allusion to sentiment or sympathy. Pauline felt that the mere fact of being in Charlton's company, of listening to his voice, was delightful to her, and the thought crossed her mind that there must be an inevitable penalty for this enjoyment. But she determined to banish unpleasant suggestions, and to make the most of the present moment. The party returned home in the same order in which they had come, and Lord Charlton's prophecy about lawn-tennis was verified. Everyone repaired to the ground, and he and Pauline met, as agreed, in the morning-room. Pauline experienced a momentary uneasiness. She knew that they would be missed, and she guessed"], [271, "A Tale of Society. 263 that their absence would be commented upon. ' I feel like a conspirator,' she said, as he came towards her. 'Do you?' he replied. 'Our plot is a very simple one, and not calculated to hurt anyone.' Then he placed a chair for her, with its back to the piano, and a footstool in front of it. ' Am I to sit here ?' she asked ; and he said, ' Yes ;' then added, ' I am going to ask a favour of you. You will please not say anything \u2014 neither \" Thank you,\" nor \" How charming !\" nor any other politeness that comes into your head. You will kindly do me the honour to listen only, and, when you are bored, I hope you will get up and go away.' ' Ah !' said Pauline, ensconcing herself in the chair, ' you have given me the most"], [272, "264 Omnia Vanitas : congenial order. I will obey it implicitly. And, as you say,' \u2014 smiling \u2014 ' when I am bored, I will go away.' ' Thanks,' answered Charlton, turning to the piano. Pauline closed her eyes. And in a few moments she had forgotten time and place, and her soul went away in a trance, carried by the most melodious and pathetic voice she had ever heard. In turn it seemed to stir every chord of her heart from exquisite melancholy to intense joy, and back to depths of profoundest sadness. Never before had human voice appealed so passionately to her heart \u2014 at will it led her through every varying sensation of pain and pleasure. Her soul was far, far away \u2014 the tears were streaming down her cheeks when, the music having ceased, she unclosed her eyes. Charlton was standing looking at her. For a moment she remained motionless,"], [273, "A Tale of Society. 265 overmastered by her feelings ; then, making a violent effort, she raised herself in her chair, and smiled. ' I have been away on a far journey,' she said. ' Is there a land of song to which one's spirit can make pilgrimage ?' ' I think there is,' he answered. ' Mine has been there many a time.' ' And yet,' she said, ' there are people in the world to whom music means nothing. Les ' She stopped short, remembering that she had already told him of Lester's indif ference to beautiful scenery, and reflect ing that it was bad taste always to make her husband an object of unfavourable comparison. Charlton was leaning against the chim ney-piece. There was no fire in the grate, but that particular attitude is dear to all Englishmen. ' Do you remember,' he asked, after a"], [274, "Omnia Vanitas : 266 pause, ' what you said last night about the other half which is created with and for us r ' Yes,' she answered, whilst the danger ous fascination which his mere voice had for her stole into her heart. ' And if one meets that half too late, what happens ?' he asked, with his eyes bent on her. Pauline roused herself with a great effort. She rose from her chair and an swered, smiling, ' One recognises the fact that it is too late, and yields to destiny,' she said. ' Now let us go and see how they are getting on with their game.' He opened the door for her and they went out together. ' You will not mind my saying what we have been doing, will you ?' she asked, as they crossed the lawn ; but he answered quickly, and almost vehemently,"], [275, "A Tale of Society. 267 ' Please \u2014 please do not. I beg it of you as a particular favour.' Pauline felt a little embarrassed, a shade vexed. If she could not give the reason of their prolonged absence from the rest of the party, it would place her in rather a false position. But, strange to say, it did not occur to her to combat his objec tion nor to think of running counter to his wish. She saw smiles on the lips of two or three of tbe ladies as she joined them, and a pang of annoyance shot through her breast. But was she not used to hearing and seeing everything misconstrued ? It is the first law of society to think ill of everyone."], [276, "268 Omnia Vanitas : CHAPTER XII. HAT evening Lady Lester went in jggjiyj to dinner with her host, and Charlton escorted their hostess. But afterwards he sought Pauline at once, and remained with her the rest of the evening. There was no dancing to-night ; the guests dispersed amongst the rooms ; some went into the conservatory, which was again lighted. Charlton and Pauline found their way to the seats they had occupied last night. The punishment for having en joyed was beginning already. Pauline knew that she was exposing herself to comment ; her own heart told her loudly enough how dangerous was the fascination"], [277, "A Tale of Society. 269 to which she was submitting, and yet \u2014 it was stronger than she. But, on tbe other hand, where was the harm ? Men had often enough made love to her on as short an acquaintance. Charl ton had not attempted anything of the sort \u2014 he had not essayed even to take her hand ; it was the extraordinary attraction he inspired in her, and that his manner made her believe she inspired in him, which told her how dangerous was the sympathy between them. A dolorous sense smote her, even whilst she was yet under the spell of his influence, that a speedy end must come to her new happi ness, or the after-pain would be immea surably out of proportion. And yet she lingered on, charmed by his voice and eyes, saying to herself that to-night she would enjoy, but after to-night she would avoid him. Her mind was so full of this thought that, when he bade her good"], [278, "270 Omnia Vanitas: night, she unconsciously said ' good-bye.' They were standing a little apart from the rest. ' Good-bye !' he echoed, in a low tone of surprise. Pauline blushed. ' Did I say good-bye ? I meant good night.' ' I suppose it will be good-bye before long,' he uttered, sorrowfully ; and she sighed involuntarily, and answered, ' I suppose so.' Then she joined the other women, who were moving away. When she was alone, she gave herself over to reflection. Her thoughts were full of trouble and sadness. She was startled from them by a sharp rap at the door, and the entrance of her husband. He looked angry. 'I have something to say to you,' he remarked, in the voice with which he"], [279, "A Tale of Society. 271 usually signified irritation and displeasure. ' I don't choose that you shall make a fool of yourself, and have people coupling your name with Charlton's. Everyone knows that he is the d dest blackguard out. If you go on sitting about in corners with him, I shall leave the house.' Pauline's face blanched. Her tongue clave to the roof of her mouth. She could not have spoken to save her life. He looked hard at her for a moment ; then, without another word, turned, and left the room. And this was the companion of her life ! His was the tender breast on which it was her right to lay her head in sorrow ; his the kind voice whose pleasant duty it was to soothe her pain ; he was the being on whose sympathy and forbearance she alone had a claim. Through all the long years this must satisfy her. To ask of another what he only had the right to give was a"], [280, "272 Omnia Vanitas: crime. Yes \u2014 a crime. She recognised that as an undying truth. Circumstances could make no excuse \u2014 retribution would follow swiftly on the heels not only of wrong-doing, but wrong-thinking. Paul ine had no illusion about the possibility of bliss for a woman at war with social and religious prejudices. A terror seized her lest the time should come when her feelings should blind her to the truth, of which she was so acutely conscious to-night. Scalding tears forced themselves through her close-shut eyelids. She thought of her husband's opprobrious words about Charlton. They made no impression on her because she had that utter and im plicit faith in him which a woman invari ably has in the man who attracts her powerfully. Why did people malign him ? But does not the world always malign and revile those who are superior to it? So"], [281, "A Tale of Society. 273 she argued. Let it cost her what it might, she must give up his society. Even, if it were necessary, she would throw herself on his chivalry, his loyalty ; so absolutely did she believe in him. Farewell, then, to the one bright glimpse which life had turned to her gaze \u2014 in the future, all was colourless, ashen-grey ; leaden as a winter sky. She woke in the morning with a severe headache, and did not go downstairs to breakfast. At noon, when she descended, everyone had gone out. She fetched her hat, and strolled into the garden. Charl ton was smoking a cigar on the terrace in view of the window from which she issued. 'Are you better?' he said, joining her, with a joyous light in his eyes. ' I knew you would be.' She looked inquiringly at him. ' Do you believe in the force of will ?' T"], [282, "Omnia Vanitas : 274 he asked gaily. ' For the last two hours I have been willing that you should lose your headache, and that you should come out here by that very window.' Pauline looked troubled. ' Do not will me !' she said, in a low voice. ' I do not believe in the power really, and yet I have a horror of it. I should hate to be under an influence that would oblige me to do anything without my own consciousness.' Charlton laughed. He was in a radiant mood to-day. ' I have the gift of mesmerism,' he said. ' Electro-biologists have told me that I possess extraordinary powers if I chose to develop them. I have never done so yet ; but, as this experiment has been so successful, it will be an encourage ment to me.' Then, seeing that Pauline still looked pained and troubled, he said gently,"], [283, "A Tale of Society. 275 ' Come and sit on this bench, and bask in the sunshine, and listen to the birds. I will keep the black art in abeyance \u2014 at least, I will only will you to be happy.' She complied. Fate was stronger than she. She had resolved not to be alone with him again. She had intended to avoid him, and yet here she was without any will of her own compelled to break the resolution it had cost her so much to make. But by daylight, in the broad sunshine, the danger seemed to be removed \u2014 his manner was so friendly and gay that it dispelled her fears. Gradually a sense of well-being stole over her, and, for the present, she saw no obstacle to their friend ship. She had been too morbid last night, she told herself. It was as though Charl ton had an intuition of her doubts and fears, so entirely did he lay himself out to quell them. After they had sat for some time, he t 2"], [284, "276 Omnia Vanitas : suggested a stroll in the wood at the back of the house. ' It is prettier even than the one where we were yesterday,' he said. Yes, Pauline thought a walk would do her good. Was there time before lunch ? Charlton looked at his watch, and told her a wilful falsehood. ' It is a quarter past one,' he said. In reality it was half an hour later. ' We have plenty of time,' she remark ed, and they strolled away to the wood. She felt that she was committing some what of an imprudence after the warning she had received, not only from her own heart, but from her husband ; but her scruples were not sufficient to deter her. Perhaps Charlton had brought the black art into play again. In any case she meant to be back and in her room before the luncheon gong sounded. What a charming walk that was ! She would"], [285, "A Tale of Society. 277 never forget it. The sunshine falling thick through the budding trees ; the jubi lant singing of the birds \u2014 the lovely tints of the wild flowers nestling at their feet. To-day \u2014 yes, to-day it was good to live. ' We must not lose our way,' she said smiling, but recking little for the moment whither she wandered on this fair day, in this happy companionship ; but Charlton declared he knew the wood and its paths quite well. Yet he managed to miss the road and make a still further delay of twenty minutes. When they returned to the house, lunch eon was nearly over. Pauline was horri fied to find that it only wanted a quarter to three. Everyone looked askance at her. She fancied she read a cold disapproval in the eyes of her hostess \u2014 the men smiled, the women rather took the lead of Lady Nonayme. Pauline had one cause for devout"], [286, "278 Omnia Vanitas : thankfulness \u2014 her husband was not there \u2014 he had driven with his host to the neighbouring town. Pauline was vexed and embarrassed, but she had not the faintest intention of attempting any concealment about her walk. She spoke of the loveliness of the woods; of having lost the way; but the manner in which her remarks were re ceived, annoyed and confused her. And when Charlton seconded what she said, she felt an increased vexation at the eager ness of his manner \u2014 it was as though he were defending her from some imputation, and showed a want of tact that surprised as much as it mortified her. She eagerly accepted an invitation, some what coldly given, to drive with Lady No nayme, and did her utmost to make herself agreeable, feeling all the time a painful consciousness that she was behaving like a guilty person anxious to disarm suspicion."], [287, "A Tale of Society. 279 And yet what wrong had she done ? There had not a word been spoken be tween her and Charlton that all the world might not have heard. He joined her when they returned from driving, and asked in a whisper if she would go to the morning-room. She shook her head. ' No,' she answered sadly, ' I must not get into any more disgrace to-day. Oh !' petulantly, ' what a world this is ! What straining after gnats ! \u2014 what swallowing of camels !' ' I have been a victim all my life,' uttered Charlton sighing. ' Every action of mine has been systematically misconstrued, and I generally have the misfortune of extend ing my ill-luck to anyone who shows me any regard or sympathy.' ' Such is life !' said Pauline bitterly, and she turned and joined a woman who at that moment emerged from the house with"], [288, "280 Omnia Vanitas : a racquet in her hand, and walked towards the lawn-tennis ground. In the evening, guests were again bidden from other houses, and there was dancing. Pauline danced once only with Charlton, and refused to go into the conservatory. He looked unhappy. ' It is my usual fate,' he said bitterly, when she had signified her refusal. ' If I meet a woman of whom I hope to make a friend, whose society is delightful to me, the world steps in and hounds me off. And now,' \u2014 his voice falling to a whisper, of which every syllable reached Pauline's heart \u2014 ' now that I have met the woman who of all others fulfils ray law of perfec tion \u2014 the loveliest, the most utterly sym pathetic woman it has ever been my lot to meet \u2014 Fate overtakes me in the old way.

It was well that at this moment another man approached to claim her for a dance. Charlton's voice and eyes had well-nigh overcome her resolve. She rose and quit ted him almost abruptly, making an im mense effort to master her agitation. But her new partner observed it, and wondered what on earth there was in that quiet looking fellow Charlton that seemed to fetch women so unaccountably. Pauline passed a miserable night. At breakfast next morning Charlton was missing ; he had received a telegram call ing him to London on business of import ance, but hoped to return the following day. The news was a relief to her, but, as the hours wore on, she thought she had never before known the intensity of lone liness. The rest of the party were merry ; one or two men tried to make themselves agreeable to her now their dangerous rival"], [290, "Omnia Vanitas : 282 was removed, and she essayed to laugh and talk, feeling all the time that to be alone on a desert island would be less dreary than in the companionship of these people, who were entirely out of sympathy with her; who jarred unspeakably upon her nerves and heart. There was only one person whose so ciety she desired, and who she felt could help her to bear the heartache she was suffering from \u2014 Sir Ralph. She could have confided in him ; could have said plainly and straightforwardly to him, ' Help me to conquer this terrible misfor tune that has befallen me \u2014 it is all wrong, hopeless, miserable \u2014 no good can come of it ; this man has forced his way into my heart, and I must tear him thence.

And yet all the while she was counting the hours"], [291, "A Tale of Society. 283 until Charlton's return. She longed to see him again with a longing that amount ed to agony. And when the evening of the morrow arrived, and he came not with it, the disappointment was almost greater than she could bear. The following morning, she and her husband left Nonayme ; their visit having come to an end. For some days after her return to Lon don, Pauline was in a state of feverish expectation. Nothing had been said about Charlton calling on her, but she felt a positive conviction that he would come or write. And she was torn in two between the longing and the dread of seeing him. Then she learned casually that he was in Paris. She wanted to talk about him ; to hear something of his life, and yet she dared not broach the subject. She had a nerv ous terror lest she should betray herself."], [292, "284 Omnia Vanitas: Once only she mentioned him, and that was to Mrs. Denison. ' So you met him at Nonayme, did you ?' said that little lady. ' I almost wonder at Lady Nonayme asking him. Many people will not have him in their houses.' 'Eeally?' remarked Pauline coldly. ' Why ?' ' Oh, because he has behaved so badly to women. He has very seductive man ners, I know, and can make one believe he is an angel ; but beware of him ! Poor Lucy Disney's divorce will be coming off soon now.' Pauline felt a strange tightening at her heart. ' And what has Lord Charlton to do with that?' she asked. ' Simply that he is the co-respondent,' answered Mrs. Denison lightly. ' He and Mr. Disney used to be bosom friends. The Disneys did not get on very well,"], [293, "A Tale of Society. 285 and Lord Charlton pretended to be the peacemaker, and \u2014 well \u2014 the upshot of it is, a divorce.' Pauline changed the subject abruptly. After the manner of an infatuated wo man, she did not believe one word to Charlton's disadvantage. It was only a week since she left Nonayme, and she was looking pale, wide eyed, haggard. One afternoon, on her return from driving, she found Sir Ralph's card. On it was written, in pencil, that he would call again later. This gave her the most agreeable sensation she had en joyed for a long time. She had only time to take off her bonnet when he was announced. ' I am glad to see you !' she cried, as he entered the room. ' What ages since we met ; and how well you are looking !' Then she asked him a hundred ques tions about himself, his travels, and seem-"], [294, "286 Omnia Vanitas : ed so bright that he did not remark any thing wrong with her. Indeed, for the time being, she had forgotten herself and her troubles in the pleasure of meeting the man whom she looked upon as her greatest friend. ' Aud now,' he said, in his pleasant voice, ' now that I have told you all about my self, how about you? How goes the world with you now ? And have you formed a better opinion of life than when last we met?' At this her face grew overshadowed. 'No, indeed,' she answered. 'I think much worse of it. I have discovered the possibility of more suffering since then.' Sir Ralph looked grave. ' I thought,' he said, ' I hoped, from the tone of your letters, that you were in a much brighter, cheerier frame of mind.' 'Yes,' she answered, 'I was. But now I have gone back. I have sunk deeper"], [295, "A Tale of Society. 287 into the old state of despair and hopeless ness.' She paused, but he did not speak ; he was waiting to hear more. It occurred to him to wonder if she had been making fresh discoveries about her husband. ' The world is full of cruelty and in justice,' she proceeded, in a rapid voice ; ' everyone who has heart or feeling suffers. I am not alone. I have met some one like myself \u2014 some one who has the same aspirations and longings, and yet who is everlastingly misjudged. Oh!' \u2014 with a slight flush of excitement on her face \u2014 ' I want to tell you about him. I would give the world to have your opinion ; you are never harsh in your judgments \u2014 you can always make allowances.

' Ah, Lord Charlton,' she said, in a joy ous tone, 'you have come just in time to renew your acquaintance with the best friend I have in the world.' But suddenly she stopped short, struck by the look of embarrassment on Charl ton's face.

Suddenly an idea flashed through Paul ine's brain. She stood speechless, staring at Charlton ; a strauge tremor passed"], [297, "A Tale of Society. 289 through her frame. Then she said, not taking her eyes from his, ' Was it you ?' ' What do you mean ?' he asked, trying to conceal his embarrassment. Pauline dragged the words out one by one. ' Who robbed him of his daughter ?' She stood breathless, waiting for his answer. Then, as he began to stammer out a reply, she sank into a chair and hid her face in her hands. ' Is it possible !' she muttered. ' Is it possible !' Charlton recovered himself. ' I think,' he said, ' you have very likely heard some garbled story. If I was to a certain extent to blame in the matter, I give you my word of honour that I was quite devoid of any wrong intention.'

Charlton left Pauline longing to think the best of him. It seemed a matter of vital importance to her to ascertain that he had not been guilty of the treachery which had been ascribed to him. She penued a hasty note to Sir Ralph, begging him to call on her the next day at twelve.

I asked \u2014 Lord Charlton \u2014 and he told me the whole story.' ' His story !' 'Yes. Oh !' cried Pauline impulsively, ' do not be angry with me for saying it \u2014 do not imagine that my sympathy for you is one least bit lessened ; but I think per haps, if you knew the real truth, you would feel less bitter towards him.

After a moment of silence, whilst Pauline was looking imploringly at him in her part of mediator, he said, ' Did he tell you that, after he left, he wrote Violet the most impassioned love letter, imploring her forgiveness ; telling her that he had concealed the truth be cause it would break his heart to part from her ; holding out hopes that if she would but wait and trust him, a time might come when he could be all in all to her ?'

Presently he came back, and stood near Pauline. ' I will not stay any longer now,' he said.

' You will understand that 1 could not risk \u2022' He left the sentence unfinished and went. Pauline sat in a sort of stupor where he left her. She had betrayed this man, who was so good to her. She knew that, after what he told her, she ought to give up Charlton, but she could not \u2014 she could not. Two miserable days passed ; on the third she met Charlton in the Row, and sat talking with him for an hour.

She did not mention his name or his daughter's to Charlton, and he appeared to have forgot ten the subject. At her invitation, he returned to lunch with her, and outstayed her other guests. For the next few days Pauline lived in a whirl of excitement. She had numerous engagements, and was trying not to give herself a moment to think. One evening Colonel Lynden sent her a box for the play, and she took Mrs. Deni son. Their attention was attracted by a very striking-looking woman in a marvel lous toilette, covered with diamonds, oppo site them. ' Who is that ?' Mrs. Denison asked the Colonel, when he joined them, some little time after their arrival.

' There is a man sitting behind the curtain who seems very anxious to conceal himself. I have seen nothing but his hand so far.' ' It is probably Charlton,' returned the Colonel ; ' he is generally her cavalier. I will go round and look presently, if it will be any satisfaction to you.' Every word went into Pauline's heart like a knife. For the rest of the evening she suffered a martyrdom. She tried to believe that it was not Charlton \u2014 that perhaps Colonel Lynden had spoken with a motive. He seemed to have a grudge against the other. After the second act, he left the box. ' Well ?' exclaimed Mrs. Denison, with eager curiosity, on his return. ' It is as I thought,' he answered. Pauline went home in a state of mind almost bordering upon fever."], [306, "Omnia Vanitas : 298 What was it to her? she said to herself over and over again. She had no right to judge him or his actions \u2014 she had no claim upon him.

Even if every thing that everyone said of him were true, he was still the most fascinating man, the most enchanting companion the world held. All this time she saw nothing of Sir Ralph ; she dared not meet him \u2014 she only desired to avoid him. One day, about a week after the episode at the theatre, Colonel Lynden, meeting Sir Ralph at one of their clubs, took him aside. ' Ralph, old chap, I have something very particular to say to you.' ' Say on,' he replied. ' You are a great friend of Lady Les ter's, and you have a good deal of influ ence over her.'"], [307, "A Tale of Society. 299 Sir Ralph shook his head. ' I have none \u2014 absolutely none,' he answered. ' I know better,' returned the Colonel, ' and this is a matter of vital importance to her. The fact is, she is getting terribly talked about, and it must be put a stop to. I don't believe a word of harm of her myself, but you know how glad the world is to be down on a woman, especially a lovely woman like that. It seems she behaved in rather a foolish manner at Nonayme, sitting out in the conservatory and places with that scoundrel Charlton. Sometimes they used to disappear for hours together, and one morning she pre tended to have a headache, but afterwards it was discovered that she had been in the woods with him, and came in at the end of lunch in the most bare-faced way. I am only quoting what those proverbial liars, \"they\" say.

Now, you know, Ralph, some one ought to tell her this, and I can't think of anyone half so suitable as you.' Sir Ralph's face was white and set. He answered, in a low voice, ' Impossible ! You know why I, of all people, cannot tell her !' ' On the contrary,' answered Lynden quickly, 'that is just what gives you the right.'"], [309, "A Tale of Society. 301 'No,' returned Sir Ralph. ' She would not listen to me, because she would think I was prejudiced ; that I had an object in traducing him.

God knows ' \u2014 fervently \u2014 ' I would do any thing iu this world to save her from him ; but it would be worse than useless to try.' Lynden left him, vexed and baffled, but he was resolved not to give up the attempt to rescue Lady Lester, whom he really liked, and to defeat Charlton, of whom he had the worst possible opinion. Two days later, Lady Lester was sitting in her boudoir when Mrs. Denison was announced. An open letter lay on the table. At the entrance of her friend, Pauline thrust it into a drawer.

' What a flutter you seem to be in !' ' I am in a flutter,' rejoined Mrs. Deni son, catching at the handle Pauline's words gave her. ' I am vexed and worried more than I can tell you.' ' My dear child, I am so sorry !' said Pauline, in her most sympathetic tone, taking Mrs. Denison's hand affectionately. Her friend paused a moment, accepting the caress.

But I do love you, dearest, more than any other woman in the world. It is about you that I am unhappy and vexed.' Involuntarily Pauline withdrew the hand she had placed in Mrs. Denison's. A chill feeling came across her. She knew by intuition what the other had come to say. ' It does not do to make ourselves un happy about other people's affairs,' she said, in a voice that sounded cold and strained. But Mrs. Denison was not to be put off, although she was somewhat awed by Pauline's attitude. ' I cannot help it,' she exclaimed impul sively, ' if you never speak to me again: I have sworn to tell you ; and, afterwards, you can ring the bell, and turn me out of the house.'"], [312, "304 Omnia Vanitas : Pauline attempted a short laugh.

' Lady Nonayme has been making her self odious about you.' Pauline turned pale ; she was very proud, and the censure of the world was bitterly unpalatable to her. ' I don't know,' Mrs. Denison went rush ing on, ' what happened at her place, but she and the other women are circulating the most horrid reports \u2014 they swear that you and Lord Charlton used to absent yourselves for hours at a time, and \u2014 and, my love \u2014 of course I know it is a lie, but they say the last morning he was there, you were in the woods for hours with him, and did not come in until everyone had finished luncheon.

Pauline was white to the lips. She rose, walked to the window, and came back. 'There is just enough truth in it,' she answered, ' to make the lie all the more infamous. Well, my dear, I am much obliged to you for having done violence enough to your feelings,' \u2014 with ill-veiled sarcasm \u2014 ' to give me such a remarkably unpleasant morning.' Mrs. Denison was both hurt and fright ened. ' I knew,' she said, ' how you would take it, but I cannot help it. I daresay you think I am as spiteful as the rest ; that it amuses me to hurt you.

But here is the end. Lord Charlton swaggers about it \u2014 he ivants to compromise you ; he tries to make people think the worst.' It seemed to Pauline that every drop of blood in her veins rushed in that instant to her head ; she caught hold of a chair. ' That at least,' she cried, ' is false.' ' It is not false,' returned Mrs. Denison mournfully. ' It was told me by an hon ourable man who is furious about it. He went to your great friend, Sir Ralph Gray, first, and implored him to tell you, but he would not. He said you would consider him prejudiced, and would not believe him. Oh ! Pauline, Pauline ! you think me frivolous and flighty, but you know I have never done any harm in my life.

You have always been a proud woman \u2014 don't have your name coupled with that of such a man !' Mrs. Denison was in passionate earnest \u2014 it was almost impossible to recognise in her the gay little butterfly woman of fashion.

And then Mrs. Denison rose suddenly, having tact enough to know that the best thing she could do was to go. ' Good-bye,' she said, and went away without attempting to take Pauline's hand. Mechanically Lady Lester rang the bell. Then she threw herself into a chair, and sat there for an hour in a sort of stupor. At the end of that time she went to her writing-table, and wrote very slowly, ' Dear Lord Charlton, ' I regret that I shall be unable to see you this afternoon. ' Yours truly, ' Pauline Lester.'

She did not breathe Lord Charlton's name to him, but he knew he had been called in to defend her against him. And he did her loyal service. He gave up everything else that he might devote himself to her whenever she wanted him, for he felt that never did a sick soul stand more in need of strength and comfort than this one. Pauline summoned up all her pride. She was determined to live down the scandal that threatened her fair fame. She meant to prove herself stronger than Lady No nayme and her clique. Lord Charlton was baffled and furious. He wrote her two or three of the most"], [318, "310 Omnia Vanitas . pathetic letters, but, what impression so ever they made upon her in secret, she answered them by not a word.

Pauline went through this phase of her life smiling, gracious, with her head high in the air. And at night she took off mask and armour and revealed a face distorted by tears and passion, and the furies of remembrance tore her breast with their lean and cruel fingers. No one but Sir Ralph guessed that she suffered \u2014 it was only before him that once now and then she gave way, and talked about the agony and hopelessness of life. But even to him she did not mention the name of the man who had wrought such havoc in her heart."], [320, "312 Omnia Vanitas : CHAPTER XIV. IT the end of June Lord Lester was going to Norway.

When he joined her there, a fortnight"], [321, "A Tale of Society. 313 after she left London, he was shocked at the change in her. She had a look of haggard misery that went to his heart. There was no longer the pressure of society to keep her smiling and feigning \u2014 the reaction had set in, and she had cast away the thought of appearances. 'My dear child,' he said sorrowfully, the first time that he was alone with her, ' how altered you are ! How ill you look ! What has come to you ?' She answered, with a short laugh that was half a sob, ' It has come to me that, if I could believe it, I also would go into a convent to-morrow \u2014 to-day !' He looked at her in speechless pain. Presently she spoke again. ' I met a man, one night at dinner, who laughed to scorn the idea of a future. \" There is nothing,\" he said, \" to prove it.

If just now you have no happiness of your own, live that you may make others better and happier.' ' I am too unhappy for that,' she an swered. ' In my present state of mind, all my sympathies are destroyed. I can feel nothing but my own intense wretched- ness.' But, as the days went on, his presence and companionship had a soothing effect upon her. Never in his life had he exerted himself so much for the sake of any human"], [323, "A Tale of Society. 315 being as he did for her. An indescribable tenderness had grown up for her in his heart. One day she came down to breakfast smiling, and with something of her old radiant expression. ' Guess,' she said, looking from her mother to Sir Ralph. 'I have had the most delightful news in the world.' ' There is nothing,' said Mrs. Chichester primly, ' that I dislike so much as beiug asked to guess anything ; it is so childish.' ' Let me try,' interposed Sir Ralph smil ing. ' I am quite sure, from your face, that it has something to do with \u2014 I beg her pardon for the liberty \u2014 Mary Dunstan.' ' She is coming home,' cried Pauline, and laughed ; the first time for weeks. ' She is on her way. She will be home in a month.' ' It is indeed good news,' he said cordi- ally."], [324, "316 Omnia Vanitas : Mrs. Chichester evinced less pleasure. She had always been a little jealous of her daughter's beloved friend. From that moment Pauline seemed to grow happier in her mind. She entered with some interest into her plans for her poor. She counted the days. Every morning she said to Sir Ralph, ' Mary is a day nearer.' But, though she seemed more cheerful in herself, he remarked that she looked far from well, and several times, when they returned from walking together, she complained of lassitude and fatigue. She had a cold and cough which she made light of, and would not be persuaded to take care of. One morning she came down looking really ill. She shivered, and, though it was a warm day, had a fire lighted in the morning-room.

I think I am going to have an illness. I cannot tell you what a terrible night I had ; I was half delirious, and all sorts of dreadful thoughts and terrors came creeping through my brain. Twice I awoke in a violent perspiration from sheer fright.' Sir Ralph looked at her anxiously. Her beautiful white skin had a grey tinge \u2014 there were rings round her eyes \u2014 her lips were pale and dry. ' You are not well,' he said emphatically ' and you must send for your doctor.'

' Yes,' she replied, ' do.' Then, as she rose, she shivered again ; her teeth chat tered in her head, and she stretched out her hand to him as she made a stumbling step forward. A terrified look came into her eyes. ' I wonder,' she said, staring at him, ' if I am going to die ?' ' My dear child,' he uttered hastily, ' do not think of such a thing. You have got a chill. Barton will put you right in four and twenty hours.' ' Take me upstairs and send for my maid,' she murmured. ' I have a strange feeling, as if my legs do not belong to me.' He helped her carefully upstairs ; the maid was standing at the top. ' Her ladyship is not well,' said Sir"], [327, "A Tale of Society. 319 Ralph to the woman ; ' you had better put her to bed at once, and I will send for Mr. Barton.' Then he lost not a moment in going to the stables and despatching a mounted groom. He met Mrs. Chichester on his return to the house. ' Lady Lester is not very well,' he said. ' She has gone back to her room. I think, if she can be quiet and sleep a little, she will soon be better. One of the men has gone for Mr. Barton.' Then he walked up and down between the house and the lodge gate, feeling more nervous and uncomfortable than he would have liked to own. In half an hour he heard the wheels of the doctor's gig. He knew Mr. Barton and stopped him. 'I fear,' he said, 'that Lady Lester is not at all well. And,' hesitating, ' I think she is a bit nervous about herself. I am quite sure I need not suggest to you not"], [328, "Omnia Vanitas : 320 to alarm her. I won't detain you another moment.' Then he resumed his pacing to and fro. What an immense time it seemed before Mr. Barton came out of tbe house ! \u2014 by his watch it was three-quarters of an hour. An intense anxiety possessed him ; he did not remember ever to have had such a feeling of fear and misery except once, when Violet had a severe attack of scarlet fever. Mr. Barton's kind florid face looked ex ceedingly grave. He saw Sir Ralph and walked towards him. ' I don't half like the look of her,' he said. ' I have made the best of it to her mother and herself \u2014 they are both as ner vous as they can be ; but I shall come again this afternoon.' ' What \u2014 do you apprehend ?' asked Sir Ralph anxiously. ' Of course I would not hint it to them."], [329, "A Tale of Society. 321 I know you are safe ; but it looks horribly like the beginning of typhoid to me.' Before that word of terror, Sir Ralph quailed. He had known so many fatal cases of it. The doctor went his way, and Sir Ralph kept on his miserable pacing to and fro with a heavy heart. Before night Pauline was delirious, and Mrs. Chichester was frightened out of her wits. It was Sir Ralph who suggested sendiug for a nurse, and took the neces sary steps to get one. He was puzzled what to do. Of all things he wanted to remain ; he would have given worlds to be allowed to see her, to watch by her sick bed as though he had been her father, but delicacy forbade his giving the smallest hint of such a desire. Ought he to pro pose to go ? But the thought of leaving this beloved woman who was dearer to him than anyone in the world save his own daughter was too cruel. And he had not T"], [330, "322 Omnia Vanitas: much confidence in Mrs. Chichester as a nurse, and had a most vivid remembrance of the part she had played in her daugh ter's previous illness. He broached the subject with great delicacy, and she begged him earnestly to remain. She declared that she was frightened to be left alone in the house, and then she uttered a Jeremiad on the subject of Lester. It was too dread ful that he could not be got at ; he was at some outlandish place in Norway, and she did not know his address. Pauline had not told her that he was keeping silence from anger at her last communication. The days dragged on with interminable length ; still Pauline remained delirious. She had two nurses ; a physician had come down from London. Mr. Barton said the illness was taking its natural course \u2014 there was no particular ground for fear ; but Sir Ralph's heart was heavy within him."], [331, "A Tale of Society. 323 Sometimes he wondered whether death would not be the best solution of the poor child's sorrows ; but, for his own sake, he agonised for her to live. The fourteenth day came, and Pauline recovered consciousness. Mr. Barton was hopeful. ' She does nothing but ask for you,' he said to Sir Ralph, after his second daily visit. ' And I have persuaded Mrs. Chi chester that her wish ought to be gratified. I need not tell you to look and speak cheerfully before her, but you will find her sadly altered.' Sir Ralph summoned up all his courage ; but, as he stood on the threshold of the room, his limbs trembled, he could hear the beating of his heart. She was changed indeed \u2014 so white, so wan ; her eyes seemed to have grown twice their natural size. She smiled at him, and feebly put out a wasted hand. He took and kissed it ; he t2"], [332, "Omnia Vanitas: 324 could not see her for the tears that filled his eyes. 'Barton tells me I am better,' she said, in a whisper. ' Do you think I am ?' ' I am sure of it,' he answered, in the most cheerful tone he could command. 'You have taken a turn now, and will mend as fast as possible.' She fixed her eyes on him. They had a far-off, unnatural look. ' I don't know how the time has gone,' she said, ' but so often I have felt that I was dying. And then I wanted to see you \u2014 I wanted you to comfort me. I want you to comfort me now. I feel like a sheep that has gone astray from the fold. 1 used to tell you that I did not believe, but now I want to believe. It would be so awful to die, and to have no hope for the future.' She looked imploringly at him. He was terrified at the possible consequences of"], [333, "A Tale of Society. 325 any agitation for her in her weak condition. ' My dear child,' he entreated, clasping both her hands in his, ' do not trouble your dear head about these things. You have only to eat and drink and sleep now. When you are stronger \u2014^we will talk it all over.' ' No,' she said mournfully, ' it must be now. The torment of my mind will kill me. Oh ! I cannot bear to go out into the cold aud dark alone. Oh ! tell me that the religion of my young life is true \u2014 tell me that you believe in God and Christ \u2014 in mercy and forgiveness of sins \u2014 that you think I, too, may find mercy.' Sir Ralph was distraught. He had only one desire \u2014 to comfort this beloved heart, and yet these things which she besought him to profess belief in were no longer aught but traditions to him \u2014 he had only one hope, one wish for himself in the"], [334, "Omnia Vanitas: 326 future \u2014 annihilation \u2014 oblivion. But he could not give such barren comfort to this woman who might be dying. Yet could he lie to her ? 'My dear,' he murmured, pressing her hand. ' Why need you fear? What harm or wrong have you done in your short life ?' ' I have been selfish and worldly, and violent, sometimes. I have denied my God. And now \u2014 now He seems to have deserted me. Oh !' tossing restlessly to and fro, ' if you would only tell me that there is forgiveness for me !' Thus appealed to, he had but one thought of comforting her. ' There is \u2014 there is!' he answered, con centrating all he could of conviction into his voice. ' At least, my child, believe that God is good \u2014 that, if you have erred, He will have mercy on you.'"], [335, "A Tale of Society. 327 ' If I could but see Mary,' she uttered wistfully, ' She would comfort me.' ' The ship is due to-morrow,' he an swered. ' Shall I go and bring her straight here ?' ' Oh ! yes, yes,' and Pauline's poor wan face lighted up, ' bring her before it is too late !' ' I will,' he said. Then the nurse came iu to say he must not stay longer. Sir Ralph went away heavy of heart. The conviction took root in his soul that religion alone could be the mainstay of a woman. A man was miser- able enough when dark days came, and he was hopeless and faithless; but the clinging, tender soul of a woman must needs have a support, a rock. It was a crime to put doubt into a woman's soul. What could philosophy or science give her in place of the beautiful Christian faith? Even if it"], [336, "328 Omnia Vanitas : were but mythology, its value to her was priceless. True to his promise, he went to meet Mary Dunstan \u2014 Mrs. Wood now. The very instant he told her the sad news, she gave up all her plans ; left her husband, and without a moment's delay accompanied Sir Ralph to the Court. He had not talked ten minutes with her before he realised how it was that she had gained such an influence over her former pupil. He felt as though he had known her for years. And he told her the story of Pauline's life from the time when he had first met her : her heart-burnings, her aspirations, her sufferings \u2014 told it as one tells the story of another whom one loves with one's whole heart, and the tears rained down Mary's kind face. Sad news greeted their arrival \u2014 a new complication had set in. Pauline had been seized with congestion of the lungs, and lay in a most"], [337, "A Tale of Society. 329 critical state. The London physician had been sent for again, aud had taken a bad view of the case. AVhen Mary was led to her bed-side, Pauline was too weak to speak to her, only a feeble gleam in her eyes showed that she was conscious of her presence. For a day and night Mary sat beside her bed, but she did. not utter a word. Then she seemed to rally. She was too weak to show the anxiety that had so distressed Sir Ralph. She could only murmur, ' I am dying, Mary. Comfort me !' And that good woman, that dear friend kneeled beside her, and, out of her pure heart, poured forth her prayers and her supplications, and murmured to her in softest tones of God's mercy and Christ's intercession ; and gradually the troubled look went out of Pauline's eyes, and a calm seemed to steal over her. She lay silent for hours after that,"], [338, "Omnia Vanitas: 330 and then, late in the afternoon, she whis pered, 'Bring Sir Ralph.' He knew that she was dying. His pain was so grievous that he could scarce mas ter it. The effort he made as he entered the room was supreme.

She unclosed her eyes ; a faint smile came to her wan, changed face \u2014 a smile as it were the smile of an angel. He bent forward to catch her whisper. 'I am happy. I believe again.' She spoke no more. She made no further sign. Half an hour later, whilst he and Mary watched in agony beside her, she passed away. Sir Ralph, blinded with tears, went down into the morning-room.

THE FIFTY-THIRD EDITION FOR 1884 IS NOW READY. Lodge's Peerage and Baronetage is acknowledged to be the most complete, as \u25a0well as the most elegant, work of the kind. As an esta blished and authentic authority on all questions respecting the family histories, honours, and connections of the titled aristocracy, no work has ever stood so high. It is published under the especial patronage of Her Majesty, and is annually corrected throughout, from the personal com munications of the Nobility. It is the only work of its class in which, the type being kept constantly standing, every correction is made in its proper place to the date of publication, an advantage which gives it supremacy over all its competitors. Independently of its full and authentic informa tion respecting the existing Peers and Baronets of the realm, the most sedulous attention is given in its pages to the collateral branches of the various noble families, and the names of many thousand individuals are introduced, which do not appear in other records of the titled classes. For i.ts authority, correctness, and facility of arrangement, and the beauty of its typography and binding, the work is justly entitled to the place it occupies on the tables of Her Majesty and the Nobility.
