The letters of Queen Elizabeth given in the Appendix to this Volume, and now printed for the fir,st time, are taken from originals written entirely in the Queen's own hand, or from contemporary copies of such originals. They were her private and confi dential letters ; a circumstance which renders them highly valuable, both as throwing light on the personal character and peculiarities of this famous Queen, and on the secret his tory of the times. The letters of Elizabeth, which have hitherto been given to the world, have been almost exclusively letters of State, written by Lord Burghley, or some other of her Councillors, and signed by the Queen. It is scarcely necessary to point out the difference between the generality of these last, which"], [14, "PllF.FACE.

Elizabeth. Henry HI. Rudolph H. Philip II. Philip II. Sextus V. I Henry IV. II I The conduct of Elizabeth on the death of the Queen of Scots was marked by much dissimulation and injustice. After having signed the warrant for her execution, commanded it to be carried to the Seals, and positively interdicted Davison, to whom she delivered it, from any further communication with her till it was obeyed, she suddenly turned fiercely round upon him and her Council, and cast on them the whole guilt of Mary's blood. In a moment she denied, or pretended to forget, everything which she had done. She had declared to Sir Robert Melvil, that she would not spare his royal mistress' life for one hour ; now she swore vehemently that she never intended to take it. She had assured Davison, VOL. IX. B"], [26, "2 1586-7. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. with a great oath, that she meant the execution to go forward ; now she loudly protested that she had commanded him to keep the warrant till he received further orders. She had laboured anxiously with Paulet to have Mary secretly made away with ; and now she did not scruple to call God to witness, under awful obtestations, that her determined resolution had been all along to save her life.1 And her sub sequent conduct was perfectly in character with all this. On the day after the execution, Lord Shrews bury wrote from Fotheringay to the Court, which was then at Greenwich. Next morning, at nine, his letters were brought to the palace by his son Henry Talbot, and the news became public. Soon after, the bells of the city, and the blazing of bonfires, proclaimed the happiness of the people.2 It was impossible that these demonstrations should have escaped the notice of Elizabeth ; and we know from Davison, every word of whose \" Apology\" carries truth and conviction with it, that the Queen that same night was made aware of Mary's execution;3 but she took no notice, and kept an obstinate silence. Apparently none of her ministers dared to allude to the event ; and when after four days the news was at last forced upon her, she broke into a hypocritical 1 Supra, Vol. VIII. p. 383.

She upbraided her councillors with having purposely deceived her,1 chased Burghley from her presence, and committed Secretary Davison to the Tower. It was in vain that this upright and able, but most unfortunate of men pleaded, with all the energy of truth, the commands of his Sovereign for everything that he had done. She knew he had no witnesses of their conversation ; charged him with falsehood and disobedience; compelled Burghley, who must have been well assured of his innocence, to draw up a severe memorial against him ; had him tried before the Star Chamber ; degraded him from his office of Secretary ; inflicted on him a fine which amounted to absolute ruin; and never afterwards admitted him to the least enjoyment of her favour.2 All this was in keeping with the subtlety and disregard of truth which sometimes marked Eliza beth's proceedings, when she had any great object to gain. It was part of a premeditated plan by which she hoped to mislead Europe, and convince its States that she was really guiltless of Mary's blood : but ultimately it had no effect on the Continent ; and it was too palpably fictitious to be successful for a moment in Scotland, where the facts were well known. In that country, the news of Mary's exe cution was received with a universal burst of indigna- 1 Wright, Life and Times of Elizabeth, vol. ii. p. 332. Wolley to Leicester, Sunday, 1586.

But the English wardens, Lord Scrope and Sir John Foster, were provided against immediate attack; and the season of the year, which was seed-time, rendered it difficult for the Scots to assemble in any force.1 It was Mr Roger Ashton, a gentleman of James' bed-chamber, whom he had sent to London some time before this, that brought the King the first certain intelligence of his mother's death. Ashton arrived in Edinburgh about the seventh day after the execution ; and Lord Scrope, who had despatched a spy to watch James' motions, wrote in alarm to Walsing ham, that the monarch was grievously offended, and had sworn that so foul an act of tyranny and injustice should not pass unrevenged.2 The feelings, however, of this Prince were neither deep nor lasting. Even at this sad moment, selfishness and the assurance of undivided sovereignty neutralized his resentment ; and he suffered some expressions of satisfaction to escape him, which his chief minister, Secretary Maitland, did not choose should reach any but the most confidential ears.3 Meantime, as Ashton's information was secret, James took no public notice of it, but sent in haste for Lord Maxwell, Ker of 1 MS.

Amid these consultation s, Mr Robert Carey was despatched by the English Queen to convey her apology to Scotland. This young courtier was the son of Lord Hunsdon, Elizabeth's cousin-german, and she selected him as a personal favourite of the Scot tish King. He carried with him a letter written in her own hand, in which she expressed the excessive grief which overwhelmed her mind, in consequence of what she termed, \" the miserable accident which had befallen, far contrary to her meaning;\"2 and he was instructed to throw the entire blame of the tragedy at Fotheringay upon Davison and her Council. On arriving at Berwick, Carey forwarded a letter request ing an audience ; but this the King declined to grant till the Envoy had .stated, on his honour, whether his mother, the Queen of Scots, was dead or alive ; and when it was answered that she was executed, James peremptorily refused to see the ambassador, and com manded him to proceed no farther into Scotland. He added, however, that he would send some members of his Council to Berwick, to whom the letter and message of the English Queen might be delivered. 1 Lord Scrope to Walsingham, 21st February, 1586-7.

On any other occasion the wrath of Elizabeth would have blazed high and fierce at such an indig nity ; but at this moment she was placed in circum stances which compelled her to digest the affront ; and Carey communicated her false and ungenerous version of the story of Mary's death to Sir Robert Melvil and the Laird of Cowdenknowes, who met him for this purpose at Berwick.1 AU this failed, as may readily be believed, to convince James, or appease the general indignation of the people. By this time the execution of the Scottish Queen, with its affect ing details, was known throughout the country ; and whatever may have been the King's secret resolutions upon the subject, he felt that it would be almost impossible to resist the deep and increasing current of popular fury which was sweeping on to its revenge. Many symptoms daily occurred to show this : Already the Scottish Border chiefs had so strictly waylaid every road and pass, that not a letter or scrap of intelligence could be conveyed to the Eng lish Court : three Scottish scouts, with troopers trained to the duty, and armed to the teeth, were stationed at Linton Bridge, Coldingham Moor, and beyond Haddington, who watched day and night, and pounced on every packet. The system of secret intelligence was at a stand ; Walsingham pined for news, and complained that his \"little blue-cap lads,\" who used to bring him word of all occurrences, were 1 Warrender MSS. Vol. A, p. 241. Mr Carey's Credit. MS. Letter, St. P. Off. B.C., Woddriugton to Walsingham, 10th March, 1586-7."], [31, "1586-7. JAMES VI. 7 no more the men he had known them. Although the season of the year was unfavourable, the Borders were already stirring; some minor Scottish forays took place ; and Bothwell, whose power was almost kingly on the marches, intimated unequivocally, that he only delayed his blow that it might fall the more heavily. He refused to put on mourning, striking his mailed glove on his breast, and declaring that the best \" dule weed\" for such a time, was a steel coat. Nor did he stand alone in these sentiments. Lord Claud Hamilton, and his brother, Arbroath, offered, on the moment, to raise three thousand men, and carry fire and sword to the gates of Newcastle; whilst Buccleugh, Cessford, and Fernyhirst, were only restrained from an outbreak by the positive in junctions of the King, and stood full armed, and fiery eyed, straining like blood-hounds in the slip, ready to be let loose on a moment's warning against England. The first circumstance which offered any percep tible check to these dread appearances, was the arrival of an able letter addressed by Walsingham to Sir John Maitland of Thirlestane, the Scottish Secretary of State, which was evidently meant for the King's eye. Thirlestane, originally bred to the law, was then high in his master's favour, and had risen by his talents as a statesman to be his most confidential minister. He was the son of Sir Richard Maitland, and younger brother of the Secretary Lethington; and although his powers were less brilliant and com manding than those wielded by that extraordinary man, his good sense, indefatigable application to"], [32, "8 1586-7. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. business, and personal intrepidity, made him a valu able servant to his Sovereign, and a formidable anta gonist to the higher nobility, who envied and disliked him. To him, therefore, Walsingham wisely ad dressed this letter, or rather memorial, in which he argued the question of peace or war, and pointed out the extreme folly and impolicy of those Councils which, at such a moment, urged the young King to a rupture with England. His reasons were well calculated to make an impression upon James.1 Adverting to the injustice of the quarrel, he described, with great force of argument, the effects that a war with England must inevitably produce on his title to the succession after the Queen's death, and the cer tain alienation of the whole body of the English nobility and people from a Prince who first revived the ancient and almost forgotten enmity between the two nations, and then hoped to be welcomed as the successor of so great and popular a Princess as Elizabeth. As for Spain and France, on whose assistance it was reported he chiefly depended, could he for a moment imagine that Spain would prove true to him ? \u2014 a country which hated him for his re ligion ; or France, whose policy was to counteract, by every possible method, an event which must be so fatal to her power as the union, whether by con quest or otherwise, of the Crowns of England and Scotland ? Could he believe that the French mon arch would assist him to a conquest which, if com- 1 His letter, which is very long, is printed entire by Spottis wood, pp. 359, 360, 361, 362."], [33, "1587. JAMES VI. 9 pleted, must threaten his own crown ? Had he for gotten that the monarchs of England still insisted on their right to the throne of France ? Besides, could it be credited for an instant, that the King of that country would ever cordially unite his interests with a monarch so nearly allied as James to the family of Guise \u2014 a house which Henry hated in his heart, and which he suspected to aim at his deposition ? There can be no doubt, that these arguments of so far-sighted a statesman as Walsingham, were not thrown away eventually upon James ; but at the moment the impression was scarcely perceptible, and for some time everything portended war. The Scottish Borders, which during the winter and spring had been kept in tolerable quietness, broke into open hostility as the summer advanced. Six successive Scottish forays swept with relentless havoc through the Middle Marches ; and Sir Cuthbert Collingwood, who commanded in those parts, found himself too weak to restrain the incursions of the fierce marauders of Cessford, Fernyhirst, Bothwell, and Angus.

Scottish government, and so inadequate was the assis tance sent him by his own, that Buccleugh, Cessford, and Johnston, with a force of two thousand men, at tacked him in his castle at Eslington, slew seventeen of his garrison, took one of his sons prisoner, severely wounded another, and but for the fleetness of his horse had made captive the Warden himself. It seems difficult to reconcile these flagrant out rages, which continued more or less throughout the year 1587, though unnoticed by our general historians, with James' warm coalition with Elizabeth in 1588. The probable explanation may be, that the young- King of Scots, without serious intentions of war, was not displeased that Elizabeth should have a little temporary experience of his power of disturbing her ; that he was not annoyed by such excesses ; and even, as Foster asserted and Burghley suspected, .secretly encouraged them.1 He knew that Elizabeth was anxious to conciliate him, and had determined, at all hazards, to purchase peace with Scotland ; and he, on his side, had resolved that he would not sell it too cheap. He was well aware of the embarrass ments with which the English Queen was now sur rounded. The mighty preparations of Spain against England were no secret. The rebellion of Tyrone in Ireland was at its height. In Scotland the Catholic lords, Huntly, Errol, Angus, Maxwell, and their ad herents were powerful, warlike, and stirring, animated 1 MS.

Another thorn in the side of England was the constant friendly intercourse between the Irish insurgents and the Scottish Isles. From these nurseries of warlike sea men and soldiers, strong reinforcements had already joined Tyrone ; and the chiefs, who were as fierce and potent as so many little sea kings, drove a lucra tive trade by serving him against England at a high price. This was another weapon in the hand of James. By means of his lieutenants, Huntly and Argyle, to whom the administration of the northern parts of his dominions was entrusted, he could let loose the Islesmen against Elizabeth, or detain them at home as suited his policy ; and that Queen re peatedly requested him to exert this influence in her favour. To do this, however, with greater profit to himself, the King was not unwilling she should feel his power ; and, with this view, he shut his eyes to the Border inroads, delayed remonstrating with Huntly on his intrigues with Spain, refused to appre hend the Jesuits who were lurking in his dominions, and gave himself no trouble to check the rising ani- mosity against England. Yet in his heart he had no inclination for war. He felt the truth of Walsing- ham's argument, that any prolonged struggle at this moment with England would be fatal to his hopes of succession ; and he flattered himself that he had the reins over the Catholic lords and the Spanish in triguers so completely in his hands, that he could"], [36, "1587. 12 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. command peace with England at whatever moment the Queen chose to have his amity on his own terms. In such a hope it turned out that he was de ceived. The Catholic party, supported by the money of Spain, commanding nearly all the northern coun ties ; and having with them the sympathies of the people, who were enraged at the execution of Mary, gained in a short time a strength on which he had not calculated, and, far from being bridled, for some time dictated terms to him. But it is time to return from this digression to the course of events in Scot land. The King, who was now on the eve of his majority, assembled a Convention of his nobility at Edinburgh, and determined to despatch ambassadors to the courts of France and Denmark.1 To Henry the Third he proposed a renewal of the ancient league between the two kingdoms ; whilst to the Danish monarch he made overtures of a matrimonial alliance.2 But Henry, who was at this moment disposed to be on favourable terms with England, treated James' advances coldly; and although the Danish alliance eventually took place, its first suggestion does not appear to have been very cordially welcomed.3 The same Convention was signalized by an event 1 Moyse's Memoirs.

This was the fall of the Master of Gray, who was tried for high treason, condemned, and on the point of being executed, when his life was spared, and the sentence changed to banishment, at the intercession of the Earl of Huntly and Lord Hamilton. His accuser was Sir William Stewart, now about to proceed on the French embassy ; and in his dittay or indictment, which has been preserved, were contained various points of treason.1 But his most flagrant offence, which was completely proved, was the base betrayal of his trust in his recent nego tiation in England, where he secretly recommended the death, instead of pleading for the life, of the Scottish Queen. At first, with his wonted effrontery, he attempted to brazen out the matter and overawe his enemies ; but in the end he pleaded guilty ; and, as abject as he had been insolent, threw himself on the King's mercy. None lamented his disgrace ; for, although still young in years, Gray was old in false hood and crime. Brilliant, fascinating, highly edu cated, and universally reputed the handsomest man of his time, he had used all these advantages for the most profligate ends ; and his life, which to the sur prise of many was now spared, had been little else than a tissue of treachery. He retired to France ; and although, after some years, he was again permitted 1 Pitcairn's Criminal Trials, vol. i. part iii. p. 157. Historic of James the Sext, p. 227.

Amid much that was frivolous and volatile, this young Prince sometimes evinced a sagacity in detecting abuses, and a vigour in devising plans for the amelioration of his kingdom, which surprised even those who knew him best. To reconcile his nobility, and extinguish those fierce and sanguinary family feuds which so frequently defied the laws and tore the kingdom in pieces, \u2014 to arrange the affairs of the Kirk, provide for its ministers, and establish a certain form of ecclesiastical polity, \u2014 to escape from the pressure of an enormous debt by recovering the crown lands, which had been greatly dilapidated during his minority, \u2014 and to take some decisive steps on the subject of his marriage ; these were the chief points which now pressed themselves upon his attention, and to which he directed the la- bours of his principal minister, the Secretary Maitland. But difficulties encountered him at every step. Out- wardly, indeed, the King's desire for a reconciliation amongst the nobles was accomplished ; and, at the conclusion of the Parliament held in the capital,2 the principal street exhibited a singular spectacle. A table was spread at the Cross, where a banquet was prepared by the magistrates; and a long line of nobles, 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off.

Bothwell and Angus, Hume and Fleming, Glammis and Crawford, with many other fierce opponents who had been compelled by their sovereign's threats or entreaties to an unwilling embrace, marched hand in hand to take their seats at the board of concord, where they drank to each other amid the thunder of the castle guns, and the songs and shouts of the citizens. It was an imposing ceremony, but really an idle and hollow farce. The deep wounds of feudal hatred, and the sacred duty of feudal revenge, were not so easily cured or forgotten ; and many of the hands now locked in each other were quivering with a desire to find occupation rather in grappling the throat than pledging the health of their brother. Before the year concluded, all accordingly was nearly as bad as before. There was one point, however, on which all seemed agreed \u2014 a desire to attack England and avenge the death of Mary. So deep was this feeling, that Thirlestane, now raised to the high office of Chancel lor, in closing the Parliament, made a stirring appeal to the assembled Estates ; and such was the impres sion of his eloquence, that the nobles, in a transport of pity and enthusiasm, threw themselves upon their knees before the King, and, amid the clang of their weapons and imprecations against Elizabeth, took a"], [40, "16 1587. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND, vow that they would hazard their lives and fortunes in the quarrel.1 These indications encouraged Huntly and the potent faction of the Catholic lords to a renewal, or rather more active continuance, of their intrigues with Spain and the Low Countries. Messengers were despatched thither, (not without the connivance of James,) who held out hopes to Philip of Scottish assistance in his great enterprise against England.2 Various Jesuits and seminary priests in disguise (of whom Gordon and Dury were the most active) glided through Northumberland into Scotland, proceeded to the late convention at Edinburgh, and from thence to Aberdeen, where they continued their efforts, in conjunction with their foreign brethren, for the re- establishment of the Catholic faith and the dethrone- ment of Elizabeth.3 Apparently, all this was encou- raged by the Scottish King. It is, indeed, sometimes exceedingly difficult to get at the real sentiments of a prince who prided himself upon his dissimulation : but, either from policy or necessity, he was soon so utterly estranged from England, and so completely surrounded by the Spanish faction, that Elizabeth began to be in serious alarm.4 1 MS.

Philip the Second of Spain was collecting against her that mighty armament, which was idly deemed to be in vincible. The ports of Spain and Flanders rang with the din of arms and the bustle and confusion of military preparation. The Queen had been per suaded by Burghley and her chief councillors, that the execution of the Queen of Scots would prove a death-blow to the Catholic party, extricate her from all her difficulties, and confer upon her life and crown a security to which she had for many years been a stranger. But she was miserably disappointed. The accounts of the death of Mary were received by the whole of Christendom with one universal burst of aston ishment and indignation. No sovereign had enforced more rigidly than Elizabeth the dogma of the inviola bility and divine right of Princes, and their responsi bility to God alone. The doctrine was generally re ceived and acted upon by her royal allies; and they noAv arraigned her as an apostate from her own principles, and an open despiser of all that was holy, just, and true. Mary's servants and household were many of them foreigners ; and, returning to their homes, spread over the Continent the touching story of her death. The hypocritical pretences of the Queen of England, by which she had endeavoured to shield herself from the odium of the execution, were generally discredited. It was said, that for the gratification of her own private revenge she had not scrupled to stain her hands with the blood of an innocent Queen ; and that, VOL IX. C"], [42, "18 1587-8. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. to escape the infamy of the fact, she had meanly and falsely thrown the blame upon an innocent councillor. The press teemed throughout Catholic Europe with innumerable publications. Histories, poems, pamph lets, and funeral orations, were circulated in every quarter on the alleged martyrdom of the Scottish Queen, and the execrable guilt of her by whom she had been murdered. The whole course of Elizabeth's public and private life was dissected, attacked, and exaggerated ; and she was held up to the detestation of the world as the true daughter and inheritrix of all the wickedness, cruelty, irreligion, tyranny, and lust of her father, Henry the Eighth. The effect of all this, and the impression it made upon the Catholic mind throughout Christendom, was great ; and when Philip began his mighty preparations against Eng land, the projected invasion of that country partook of something like the sanctity of a crusade. Surrounded by such complicated difficulties, it was not without alarm that Elizabeth heard of the estrangement of the Scottish King, and the bold proceedings of her enemies the Catholic lords. Con fident of the assistance of Spain, with whose vast preparations they were well acquainted, they hoped to revolutionize Scotland, get possession of the King's person, destroy his Protestant advisers, and reestablish the Catholic religion.1 It was one prin cipal branch of their plan to produce a diversion 1 MS.

For the accomplishment of these great designs, Lord Maxwell, a leading and powerful Catholic lord, was on the Continent in com munication with Spain and Rome; Archibald Douglas was suspected to be seconding their efforts in England, and the disgraced Master of Gray in France ; whilst Sir William Stewart, the brother of the once-powerful Arran, was busy at the head-quarters of the Prince of Parma.1 In Scotland, Huntly, the great leader of the Catholic lords, with Lord Claud Hamilton, Mar, Angus, and Bothwell, were prepared, on the briefest warning, to assemble a force which the King, in his present circumstances of poverty and desertion, could not control. As was usual in Scotland, schemes of private assassination were mixed up with plots against the Government : not only the Chancellor Maitland but the King himself considered their lives in danger ;2 and James, in self-defence, was compelled to dissemble, and to aim at a neutrality which promised a temporary security.3 But through out all this, the real sentiments of the monarch experienced no alteration. He continued firm in his opposition to Spain, true to the reformed religion. 1 MS. St. P. Off., January, 1587-8. Occurrences out of Scot land. 2 MS. Letter, Brit. Mus., Caligula D, sol.

This the imminent dangers with which she was surrounded at length compelled her to do; and Lord Hunsdon, her cousin, who had recently gained an intimate knowledge of the intrigues of France by robbing the French Ambassador, Courcelles, of his despatches, was selected to open a communication with the King of Scots. But at this moment a circum stance, apparently slight, had nearly overturned all. Jane Kennedy, the daughter of a noble house, who had attended Mary in her last hours, suddenly arrived from France, obtained a private audience of the King, was closeted with him for two hours, and gave so touching an account of the tragedy at Fo theringay, that James refused to be comforted ; and denouncing vengeance, broke off the conferences with England. But these feelings were evanescent : the violence of the northern earls, the fear of losing Eliza beth and cutting himself out of the succession, re stored him to his calmer mood ; and he despatched the Laird of Carmichael to meet Hunsdon on the Borders at Hutton Hall.1 All, however, had to be transacted with the utmost secrecy; and nothing could be more alarming than the picture of the king dom drawn by the English diplomatist. Huntly and the Catholics, he said, were almost in open re- 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. B.C., Hunsdon to Burghley, 23d January, 1587--8.

He assured Elizabeth that she could not detest more deeply than himself the plots of the Papists ; that none of the messengers of Antichrist, their common enemy, should be encouraged; and that his single reason for suspending their usual loving intelligence was a feeling that she had failed to vin dicate herself from the guilt of his mother's blood. To prove his sincerity against the Catholics, he sum moned his forces, attacked the Castle of Lochmaben belonging to Lord Maxwell, who had now assumed 1 MS. 1588-9, St. P. Off.

But the Ambassador promised far more than the Queen had the least intention of per forming. His royal mistress, he said, was ready to settle a Duchy on her good brother, with a yearly pension of five thousand pounds. She would imme diately raise for him a body-guard of fifty Scottish gentlemen ; and, to meet the danger of a revolt by the Popish lords on the approach of the Armada, she would levy a corps of a hundred horse and a hundred infantry to act upon the Borders.2 With these high offers James immediately closed ; and Walsingham, for whose piercing glance and universal intelligence nothing was too minute or remote, having discovered that Thomas Fowler, an attached friend of the House of Lennox and a favourite of the Scot tish King, was about to proceed on some private personal affairs to Edinburgh, contrived, through his means, to open a secret correspondence with James and Maitland his chief minister, which enabled them to traverse and overthrow the designs of Huntly and the Spanish faction.3 All this was of the utmost 1 Historie of James the Sext, p. 236. 2 MS.

Ireland was saved from any invasion by the Islesmen ; the Borders between England and Scotland were kept quiet ; no Scottish auxiliaries were permitted to pass over to the service of her enemies ; and she was enabled to concentrate her whole naval and military energies to meet the great crisis of her fate \u2014 the meditated invasion of the Armada. This she did, accordingly, in the noblest and most effective manner : and the result is familiar to all, in the utter discomfiture and dispersion of that mighty armament. Not long after this occurred the assassination of the Duke of Guise and his brother the Cardinal of Lorrain, which removed two of her most powerful and talented opponents : so that, although the clouds still lowered, the imminency of the danger on the side of Spain and France had passed. James now naturally looked for the performance of her promises; but he was cruelly disappointed. With the cessation of alarm, Elizabeth's deep-rooted habits of parsimony revived : the promised Duchy with its princely revenue, the annual pension, the intended body-guard, the English auxiliaries to act upon the Borders, melted away and were no more heard of: \u2014 Ashby, the Ambassador, it was alleg ed, had much exceeded his instructions ; and the King, in great wrath, complained that he had been dandled and duped like a boy.1 These irritated feel ings were encouraged by the Spanish faction. Many 1 MS. St. P. Off., Fowler to Walsingham, 29th Dec., 1588."], [48, "24 1588. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. urged the King to seek revenge. Bothwell, ever anxious for broils, boasted that, without charging his master a farthing, he would bleed Elizabeth's Ex chequer at the rate of two hundred thousand crowns a-year, or lay the country waste to the gates of New castle. The more moderate party hardly dared to ad vise ; and the Chancellor Maitland, hitherto the firm friend of England, found himself compelled to unite with Huntly. The character of the young prince, and the dangerous and unsettled state of Scotland at this time, were strikingly described by Fowler in one of his letters to Walsingham. He found James, he said, a virtuous prince, stained by no vice, and sin gularly acute in the discussion of all matters of state ; but indolent and careless, and so utterly pro fuse, that he gave to every suitor, even to vain youths and proud fools, whatever they desired. He did not scruple to throw away, in this manner, even the lands of his Crown ; and so reckless was he of wealth, that, in Fowler's opinion, if he were to get a million from England, it would all go the same way. His plea sures were hunting, of which he was passionately fond ; and playing at the mawe, an English game of chance, in which he piqued himself on excelling. In his dress he was slovenly, and his Court and house hold were shabby and unkingly ; but he sat often in council, was punctual in his religious duties, not missing the sermons thrice a-week ; and his manners betrayed no haughtiness or pride. It was evident to Fowler that he detested the rude and ferocious bear ing of his great nobles, who were content to obev"], [49, "1588. 25 JAMES VI. him in trifles, but in all serious matters, touching life or justice, took the law into their own hands, and openly defied him. Upon this subject Fowler's ex pressions were remarkable. When it came to the execution of justice, it was evident, he said, his sub jects feared him not, whilst he was terrified to deal with so many at once, looking tremblingly to the fate of his ancestors, of whom such as attempted to exe cute justice with severity, were uniformly put to death by their nobles.1 Often had the King assured the intimate friend who wrote these letters, that it was misery to be constrained to live amid the wicked ness of his barons, and that they made his existence a burden to him. Nor could he look for redress to his Council. Even the wisest and greatest amongst them, not excepting the Chancellor Maitland, were infinitely more occupied in private quarrels and family feuds than with the public business of the State; and, to increase their individual power, were content to flatter the King in the basest manner, and become suitors at Court for everything ungodly and unrea sonable. Well might Walsingham exclaim, in answer to this sad dark picture of regal weakness and feudal misrule, \" God send that young prince, being of him self every way well-inclined, good, wise, and faithful councillors, that may carry him in a constant course for the upholding of religion, and the establishing of 1 MS.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. justice in that realm.\"1 As a cure for this miserable condition, the English Secretary recommended a Court of Star-chamber, and a change of councillors from the great nobles to the barons and burgesses. But neither measure was practicable; and Maitland, at this moment James' chief adviser, assured Fowler that the death of the Guises, instead of being attended with any favourable result in strengthening the English party in Scotland, would have an opposite effect. \" Your Queen,\" said he, \" thinks that she has lost in Guise a great enemy, and my master a great friend. Be assured it is not so. For a long time the King hath had no dealings with the Guise : he loved him not \u2014 nor is he sorry but rather glad that he is gone. But, mark me, this will make the King of Spain seek my master, and esteem him more than before : for by the Duke of Guise that Prince thought to have had all France at his devotion, except the Protestants, \u2014 to have sub dued even them ere long, and to have been so strong as to have had his revenge on England, without our help here ; but now Scotland is his only card to play against England, and that you will see ere long.\"2 These predictions were soon fully verified. The Popish earls, led by Huntly and Errol, entered into a more active and deep-laid correspondence with Spain and Rome. Large sums of money were re mitted to them from Philip and the Pope ; and letters 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off., Orig. Draft, Walsingham to Fowler, 22d Dec., 1588. 2 MS. Letter, St. P.

They were seized on the person of a Scotsman, who was detected carrying them to the Prince of Parma; and expressed, on the part of Huntly, Morton, Errol, and the rest of the Catholic noblemen and gentry of Scotland, their infinite regret at the discomfiture of the Armada, and their sorrow that the fleet had passed so near their coast without visiting them, when they were able to have raised a force such as could not have been resisted. They assured the Spanish King, that the outlay of a single Galeass in Scotland would have gone farther than ten on the broad seas ; and that six thousand Spaniards once landed there, would be joined by an infinite multitude of Scotsmen animated . with the bitterest hatred to England, and who would serve him as faithfully as his own subjects. Huntly at the same time assured Parma, that his late con fession and his signature to the Protestant Articles had been extorted from him against his conscience ; but that in spite of all this he continued a true Ca tholic, and by this pretended change had acquired a greater power over the young King. In the same letters Errol professed the utmost devotion to the Catholic faith, congratulating himself on having been called from darkness to light ; and Bruce informed Parma of the seasonable arrival of Chisholm, their agent, with the large sum entrusted to him, and of their having secured the Earl of Bothwell, who, though still a Protestant, had been bribed to embrace their party."], [52, "28 1588-9. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Copies of these letters were instantly sent down to James, who at first disbelieved the whole story, and dealt so leniently with the principal conspir ators, that the plot, instead of being crushed in its first growth, spread its ramifications throughout the country, especially the northern counties, and grew more dangerous than before. Huntly was, in deed, imprisoned ; but his confinement was a mere farce. The King visited him in his chamber and dined there ; permitted his wife and servants to com municate freely with him; wrote him an affectionate remonstrance, and even kissed and caressed him.1 This could end only one way. The captive, after a brief imprisonment, during which he made the most solemn asseverations of his innocence, was restored by the too credulous monarch to his former autho rity, and basely abused the royal forgiveness by seducing the fierce and potent Earl of Bothwell from his allegiance, and breaking into open rebellion. This insurrection at first assumed the most formid able appearance : the whole of Scotland north of Aber deen was on the eve of revolt ; and Bothwell threat ened, that if James ventured to take arms against the remoter insurgents, he would ravage the south in his absence and compel him to draw homewards. But this bravado, instead of intimidating, effectu ally roused the King, who, for the first and almost the last time in his life, exhibited a military spirit worthy of his ancestors. An army was instantly 1 MS. St. P. Off, Ashby to Burghley, Edinburgh, 10th March, 1588-9.

The formidable stories of the mighty strength and pre parations of the Catholic earls were found false and ridiculous, \u2014 their troops melted away. Bothwell's force, which was to effect such wonders, soon shrunk to thirty horse; and James, advancing by Dundee and Brechin, carried everything before him, and com pelled the rebels to evacuate Aberdeen, the centre of their strength. It had been expected that the enemy would here give battle, but their courage failed them. Craws urd secretly fled; others openly deserted ; and the King, who had shown unusual hardihood, and watched two nights in his arms, was disappointed of an opportunity to win his spurs. But the expedition was completely successful : Huntly was driven from 1 MS. St. P. Off, Ashby to Burghley, 8th April, 1589. * MS. St. P. Off, Fowler to Burghley, 9th April, 1589."], [54, "30 1589.

Northern rebellion, was, indeed, notorious to all ; but the dread of his power and revenge intimidated the Court. The trial was prolonged till midnight, and it required the presence and remonstrances of the King to procure a conviction. He was then shut up in Tantallon ; 1 but was enlarged, after a few months, on payment of a heavy fine to the Crown.2 This unusual exertion of James in destroying the designs of Huntly and the Catholics, was followed by a fit of extraordinary activity on another subject \u2014 his marriage with Denmark. At the time of the first proposal of a matrimonial alliance with this kingdom, Arran was in power, and had engaged to Elizabeth that his royal master should continue single for three years. Accordingly, on the arrival of the Danish Ambassadors, they found themselves treated with such irritating coldness and neglect, that it re quired much management on the part of Sir James Melvil to prevent an open rupture, and convince them that the affront proceeded not from the young King but his haughty minister.3 His endeavours, however, succeeded ; and although the Danish mon arch, in some disgust, disposed of his eldest daughter, the Princess Royal, the intended bride of James, to the Duke of Brunswick, he afterwards declared his willingness to bestow her sister, the Princess Anne, 1 MS.

Elizabeth, who had gained to her interest the Chancellor Maitland, recommended the Princess of Navarre; and thecelebrated poet DuBartas visited Scotland on a secret mission to propose the match. This preference probably proceeded from a suspicion that the Princess Anne was not sound in her attachment to the Protestant opinions, which afterwards turned out to be well founded ; but James utterly disrelished the dictation of the Queen and the boldness of his Council. It was time, he felt, that in so weighty a matter as his marriage he should vindicate his liberty of choice and follow his own judgment: he had, besides, heard a report that the Princess of Navarre was old and crooked ; and al though his great nobles affected the alliance with France, the bulk of his people, the Burgh towns and the merchants, were all keen for Denmark.1 This decided the young King ; and he now despatched the Earl Marshal, with a noble suite, to proceed to Copenhagen and conclude the match. On his arrival, the Scottish Ambassador found that, if cold or slow at first, the Danish Coui't were hot enough (to use Ashby's expression to Walsing ham) as soon as there was a serious proposal made. All was soon arranged, and the utmost bustle prevailed. In some amusing contemporary letters, the Queen mother is described as the soul and centre of the 1 MS. Letter, St. P.

Women, guards, pages, lackeys, all, from the highest to the lowest, who were to compose the suite of the bride, received orders to hold themselves in readiness. A fleet of twelve sail with brass ordnance, was fitted out to transport her ; and it was reported that she was likely to land in Scotland before James' wedding hose were ready or a house furnished to receive her.1 But these antici pations proved fallacious; and the King, who had worked up his usually phlegmatic temper to an extra ordinary pitcli of chivalrous admiration, was kept for some weeks in an agony of suspense by contrary winds and contrary councils. This did not prevent him, however, from forwarding to his ambassadors a gentle remonstrance touching the smallness of the \" tocher,\" or dowry ; but Denmark refused to add a farthing to it ; and the monarch, affecting the utmost anxiety for the young Princess, who, he had per suaded himself, was utterly in despair and love-sick at the delay, urged her instant departure.2 At length she sailed ; but the squadron encountered a tremen dous storm, which shattered and dispersed the ships, and compelled them to return to Norway in so leaky and disabled a condition, that every hope of resuming 1 MS.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. their voyage for that season was abandoned.1 During all this period of suspense, the young King's romantic agitation continued. He was a true lover, as Ashby described him to Walsingham in a letter from the Court at Holyrood ; thinking every day a year till he saw his love and joy approach : at one time, flying to God, and commanding prayers and fasting for her safe arrival ; at another, falling upon the Scot tish witches, to whose unhallowed rites and incanta tions he ascribed the tempests which delayed her. Nor were these pretended agonies : for when at last the news arrived of her danger and escape, he sud denly adopted the idea of proceeding in person to Norway, and determined (to use the poetic phrase ology of Ashby to Queen Elizabeth) \" to commit himself and his hopes, Leander like, to the waves of the ocean, all for his beloved Hero's sake.\" 2 This resolution he carried into effect on the twenty second of October \u2014 embarking at Leith, accom panied by the Chancellor Maitland, who had been forced to waive his repugnance to the match ; by his favourite minister and chaplain Mr David Lindsay, and a select suite of his nobility. On the day after his departure, a Declaration of the reasons which had prompted so unusual a step was delivered to the Privy Council, and afterwards made public. It was 1 MS. Letter, St. P.

We learn from his own lips that it had been very generally asserted by his loving subjects, that their sovereign was a \" barren stock,\" indisposed to marriage, and careless of having children to succeed him in the throne. His mind, too, had been attacked in most unmannerly terms : it was insinuated that the Chancellor \"led him by the nose,\" as if he were an unreasonable creature, a mere child in intellect and resolution, or an \" im pudent ass that could do nothing of himself.\" To confute the first slander, he had determined to seek his Queen forthwith, and marry her as speedily as the winds and waves would permit. To give the lie to the second aspersion, he assured his people, on the honour of a Prince, that he alone, unknown to Chan cellor or Council, had conceived the first idea of this winter voyage ; that his resolution Avas taken in the solitude of his chamber at Craigmillar ; and that, till the preparations were concluded, and he was ready to step on board, the purpose was shut up in his own bosom. Let no man, therefore, (he concluded,) grudge at this proceeding, but conform to the directions I have left.1 These directions, notwithstanding the undignified singularity of the paper which accompanied them, were marked by prudence and good sense. The chief authority during the royal absence was com mitted to the Duke of Lennox, who was made President of the Privy Council. Bothwell, whose 1 Spottiswood, pp. 377, 378-379."], [60, "36 1589. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. turbulent disposition and power upon the Borders rendered it dangerous for him to be disobliged, was conciliated by being placed next in rank and au thority to Lennox. The other councillors were, the Treasurer, Comptroller, the Lord Privy-Seal, the Cap tain of the Castle of Edinburgh, with the Lord Advocate and Clerk Register. A committee of noblemen was ordered to attend \" in their courses,\" at Edinburgh, for fifteen days : the Earls of Angus and Athol, with Lords Fleming and Innermeath, to begin ; and the next course to be kept by the Earls of Mar and Morton, with Lords Seton and Yester. The chief military power, as Lord-Lieutenant, was entrusted to Lord Hamilton, to be assisted in any emergency by Lords Boyd, Herries, Maxwell, Home, Cessford, and other principal barons within the marches. All con ventions of the nobles were prohibited during the King's absence ; and the ministers and preachers en joined to exhort the people to obedience, and to commend their sovereign and his journey in their prayers to God.1 Having given these directions, the King set sail ; and his insulated fit of love and chivalry met with its reward. After an initiatory gale, just sufficient to try the royal courage, the squadron reached Upsal on the fifth day, and James rode to the palace, where his inamorata awaited him ; hurried, \" booted and spurred,\" into her presence ; and, in the rude fashion of Scotland, would have kis.sed her, had he not been repulsed by the offended maidenhood of Denmark. 1 Spottiswood, p. 379."], [61, "1589. 37 JAMES VI. But she was soon appeased ; explanations followed \u25a0 the manners of the royal bridegroom's land were comprehended ; and, \"after a few words privily spoken between his Majesty and her, there passed,\" we are told by a homely chronicler of the day, \" familiarity and kisses.\" 1 The marriage took place (November 23) in the Church at Upsal : the ceremony being performed by the King's favourite minister, Mr David Lindsay. Much rejoicing and banqueting, as usual, succeeded ; and it appears to have required little argument in the Queen-mother to persuade her new son-in-law to eschew the dangers of a winter voyage, and convert his intended visit of twenty days into a residence of nearly six months in Denmark. This interval was passed by the King to his entire satisfaction. The time being divided between in-door revelries and pageants ; out-door sports ; discussions on astronomy with Tycho Brahe, whom he visited at Uranibourg ; disputes with the learned Hemingius, on predestina tion and other points in divinity ; and consultations with the Chancellor Maitland, regarding the safest method of curbing the overgrown power of his nobles, and vindicating, on his return, the authority of the Crown. In the spring he determined on his voyage home ; and carrying his youthful Queen along with him, accompanied by a splendid retinue of Danish nobles and ladies,2 arrived at Leith on the first of May, 1590. The royal pair were received, on dis- 1 Moyse's Memoirs, Bannat. ed., p. 81. 2 Rymer's F\u0153dera, vol. xvi. p. 51-60."], [62, "38 1 590.

A Latin oration of welcome was followed by a ser mon of Mr Patrick Galloway ; and after divine ser vice the King, mounting his horse, followed by his youthful bride in her chariot, drawn by eight horses gorgeously caparisoned, proceeded to the Palace of Holyrood. She was encircled by a galaxy of Danish and Scottish beauty, and attended by all the chivalry of her new dominions. Her Coronation followed not long after, performed on a scale of unusual magnificence, and only clouded by a dispute between the King and the Kirk, on the subject of \" anointing ;\" a ceremony represented on the side of the Puritans as Jewish, Papal, and abomi nably superstitious \u2014 on the other, as Christian, holy, and Catholic. The royal arguments, however, were enforced by a threat that one of the Bishops should be sent for. The dread of this worse profanation procured the admission of the lesser : the ceremony was allowed to proceed according to the King's wishes ; and, to use the naive expression of a con temporary, \" the Countess of Mar, having taken the Queen's right arm, and opened the craigs of her gown, Mr Robert Bruce immediately poured forth upon those parts of her breast and arm of quhilk the clothes were removed, a bonny quantity of oil.\" J 1 The Coronation of the Quenis Majestie, p. 53.

The coronation was followed by the Queen's tri umphal entry into her new capital ; a ceremony con ducted by the worthy merchants and burgesses, on a scale of splendour which argued increasing wealth and success in commercial enterprise. But the particulars, though curiously illustrative of manners, would fatigue by their complexity. Latin addresses were, as usual in this age, the great staple of compliment ; and when the Danish Princess entered the gates, she was greeted in a classical panegyric by \" Master John Russell, appointed thereto by the township ;\" whilst the son of the orator, \" little Master John Russell,\" who had been artificially and wonderfully shut up in a gilded globe stuck upon the top of the gate, fluttered down in the dress of an angel, and delivered to Her Majesty the keys of the city in silver.1 1 Papers Relative to the Marriage of James the Sixth, pp. 39, 40."], [64, "1590. 40 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND.

Nor was the peace of the country, in this brief and happy in terval, broken by the usual sanguinary baronial feuds ; although, as the result fully showed, they were silenced, not eradicated. Huntly, Errol, Crawford, Maxwell, and the great body of the Roman Catholic party, had too recently experienced the weight of the royal vengeance to think of active hostility for some time ; and the judicious division of power between the Duke of Lennox, Lord Hamilton, and the Earl of Bothwell, balanced by the authority committed to Angus and Athol, Mar and Morton, with other great barons, produced the best effects, and put all upontheir honour and good conduct. The Kirk, too, was in a .state of tranquillity \u2014 rejoicing in the recent detection and discomfiture of Roman Catholic intrigue, looking forward in calm exultation to the utter extermination of prelatical principles, and anticipating no distant triumph to what it believed to be the truth. On the return of the King, therefore, all at first appeared tranquil ; but it needed no deep discern ment to detect the existence of many latent causes of disturbance. The great struggle between the principles of the Reformation and the ancient faith was lulled only, not concluded.1 The minor, but Leith, 25th July, 1589. MS. Letter, St. P.

Amongst the nobles, the right of private war, the ties of manrent, the abuses of baronial jurisdictions, the existence of blood-feuds, which often from trifling quarrels depopulated whole districts and counties ; and in the Isles, and remoter provinces of the north, the lawless and fierce habits of the petty chieftains and pirate adventurers, who assumed the state and in dependence of sea kings, \u2014 all these circumstances combined to threaten the public tranquillity, and to convince the King that the sky so clear on his arrival might soon be black with its wonted tempests. Amid these elements of political strife and nascent revolution, two men were to be seen evidently des tined, from their power and political position, to take the chief lead in State affairs. Both were well aware of the easy and indolent temper of the King ; both had resolved to engross to themselves the supreme power in the Government : and for some years, the history of the country is little else than the conflicts of their intrigue and ambition. These were, Mait land of Thirlestane the Chancellor, James' favourite and prime minister, who had accompanied his royal master to Denmark; and Francis Stewart Earl of Bothwell, the King's near relative, and, perhaps, the most daring, powerful, and unprincipled of all the higher nobles.

He had risen by his commanding talents to the highest legal office in the kingdom ; and he was strong in the friendship of his Prince, and the respect of the Kirk and the great body of the middle classes \u2014 the rich burghers, merchants, and artisans. During his absence in Denmark with his royal master, they had held many grave consultations on the broken, disjointed, and miserable state of his kingdom. The extreme poverty of the Crown, the insolence and intolerable oppressions of the higher barons, who, strong in their hereditary power, dictated to the monarch on all the affairs of his Government, thrust themselves uncalled-for into his Councils, attended or absented themselves from Court at their pleasure, and derided alike the command of their Prince or the decisions of the laws ; \u2014 all this was pointed out by the Chancellor to the King, and the absolute necessity of some speedy and efficient reformation insisted on. It was time, he said, that the mon arch, who was now in the prime of his years and vigour, allied by marriage to a powerful Prince, the heir of a mighty kingdom, and able, from his posi- tion, to take a leading part in European politics, should no longer be bearded by every baron who chose to consider himself as a born councillor of the realm. It was time that those illegal coalitions of the nobles, whose object it had so often been to seize"], [68, "44 1590. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the King's person, and compel him into an approval of all their atrocious designs, should be broken up, and for the future rendered impossible. To effect this, the Crown must strengthen itself in every possi- ble way : it must support its judges and officers in the execution of their duty against baronial oppres- sion and insolence ; it must increase its revenues by a prudent economy and retrenchment of the super- fluous offices in the royal household ; it must save its escheats, its wardships, its fines, its rentals, and all the sources of its wealth, to form a fund for all emergencies, but especially for the support of a body of Avaged troops, who, by their constant readiness for service, and superior discipline, might overawe the nobles and their vassals. To effect this, would require some sacrifices on the part of the Prince. Amongst these, a more rigid and practical attention to business, a correction of the mischievous habit of granting every petition without inquiry, and a resolution to hold himself more distant and dignified to his nobility, were absolutely necessary ; but if ready to consent to these, it would not, he said, be difficult to effect a thorough reformation; and he the Chancellor, for his part, was ready to back the King to the utmost of his power to accomplish it. To this end, he represented to James the wisdom of keeping up the present friendly relations with England, and the necessity of watch ing the motions of Huntly and the Roman Catholic party, who, though apparently subdued and silent, were still powerful in the kingdom, busy in their intrigues with Spain, and ready to seize any oppor-"], [69, "1590. 45 JAMES VI. tunity for a new effort.1 Nor was there any reason why this large and powerful body of men should despair of success, but rather the contrary. Ample proof of this may be found in a remarkable paper in the hand of Lord Burghley, written shortly before James' arrival from Denmark, and drawn up appa rently for his own guidance, which brings forward, in clear contrast, the comparative strength of the Catholic and Protestant parties in Scotland. From it we learn, that all the northern part of the kingdom, including the counties of Inverness, Caithness, Suther land, and Aberdeen, with Moray, and the Sheriff doms of Buchan, of Angus, of Wigtown, and of Niths dale, were either wholly, or for the greater part, in the interest of the Roman Catholic party, commanded mostly by noblemen who secretly adhered to that faith, and directed in their movements by Jesuits and Priests, who were concealed in various parts of the country, especially in Angus. On the other hand, the counties of Perth and Stirling, the populous shire of Fife, and the counties of Lanark, Dumbarton, and Renfrew, including the rich district of Clydesdale, were, with few exceptions, Protestant ; whilst the counties of Ayr and Linlithgow were dubious, and could not be truly ranged either on one side or the other.2 Are we to be surprised that, in a country thus divided, and with a Prince so little able to adopt a 1 MS.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. firm and determined line of policyas James then was, the struggle between the two parties should long be kept up with increasing obstinacy and asperity ? But it is necessary to leave these general remarks and resume our narrative. In the end of May, the Danish commissioners and nobles, who had accompanied their young Princess to Scotland, took leave of the Scottish monarch, and returned to Denmark. It had been arranged between James and his chief minister Maitland, that no at tempt at reformation should be made till these stran gers had left the country; but scarcely had they embarked, when the King exhibited an unusual courage and activity, by making an effort to seize, with his own hand, the Laird of Niddry, a baron who had been guilty of a foul murder, and was protected by Bothwell. This energy, although unsuccessful at the moment, (for the culprit, receiving warning, es caped,) had a good effect in convincing the country that he was in earnest; and about the same time the strictest regulations as to audience were enforced at the palace. Of this an instance occurred soon after, which made some noise. Lord Hamilton, the first nobleman in the country, and heir-apparent to the throne, sought, as usual, to enter the King's pre sence-chamber, but was stopped at the door by Sandi lands, one of the royal suite, who told him the King was quiet, and would see no one. \" I was sent for,\" said Hamilton ; \" I am ready to serve my Prince. and thought to have access freely as I was wont ; but you may tell the King, that this new order will"], [71, "1590. 47 JAMES VI. offend more than me.\" He then left the palace in a high fume, and would have ridden home had he not been better advised. James afterwards good humour edly appeased him ; observing, that it ill became the heir-apparent to be angry with the old laird, meaning himself. Bowes, however, who was at Court, and told the anecdote to Burghley, observed, that such new restrictions gave deep offence in Scotland, and caused much murmuring with a proud noblity long ac customed to have the freest access to their sovereign.1 Such discontent, however small in its beginning, soon spread widely ; and unknown evils and reforms being generally magnified in anticipation, the King's intentions created an alarm, which showed itself in a coalition between those who hitherto had been in constant and bitter collision \u2014 the Catholic faction, known by the name of the Confederates of the Brig of Dee, and the Protestant associates of the Enter prise at Stirling. The Earls of Huntly, Errol, Both well, and Montrose, began to league together; and James had at first resolved to attempt a stroke of State policy, by committing them to ward, bringing them to trial for their former offences, and at once destroying so dangerous a combination. But the at tempt was deemed too hazardous ; and it was judged more prudent to temporize, and keep up the two factions, balancing the one against the other.2 A Convention of the nobles was appointed to be held early in June. \" The King, (said Bowes to 1 MS.

His household was greatly reduced in its expenditure. After a general dismissal of offi cers, which occasioned many murmurs, the gentlemen personally attendant on royalty were cut down from thirty to four, with two pages ; and the monarch drew up, in his own hand, some principal matters relative to domestic and foreign policy, upon which he required the immediate advice of his Privy Coun cil. They must consider, he said, the state of the strengths and munitions, and the necessary provision to be made for the defence of the kingdom, in case of foreign invasion ; the treaties required to be entered 1 MS.

Such were the grave and weighty matters which the King now brought before his Council.2 But these were not all : the monarch had resolved to exert his utmost efforts to heal the wounds, not of Scotland only, but of Europe, by establishing a peace between England and Spain. To effect this, he de spatched Colonel Stewart and Sir John Skene on a mission to the Princes of Germany, to persuade the Palsgrave, the Duke of Saxony, the Marquess of Bran denburg, and the rest of these potentates, of the absolute 1 The \"ettling,\" the \"aim.\" To ettle, to aim.

If Spain were obstinate, a general league was to be concluded amongst the Princes for the preser vation of \" the common cause of true religion, and their ports were to be shut against Philip till he was reduced to reason.\" 1 These great designs the King communicated to Elizabeth by Sir John Carmichael, whom he sent to the English Court with a copy of the Instructions furnished to his German ambassadors; and, as his exchequer was at this time utterly impoverished, he requested that Princess to lend him sufficient to de fray the expenses of their voyage ; declaring his readiness, in return, to place upon his Privy Council any nobleman whom she recommended, and to exert his utmost strength in crushing the Roman Catholic faction, who were renewing their intrigueswith Spain.2 The \" Band\" or Covenant, which united Huntly, Errol, and their associates, in their recent treasonable enterprise, had been traced to the hands of the Laird of Auchendown, and Maitland the Chancellor insisted on its being produced ; assuring Elizabeth, with whom he was then in great favour, that the association should be broken up or Huntly wrecked for ever.3 1 MS.

The choice of the King's Secret Council was left to his own will, and Elizabeth knew she would be chiefly consulted. The monarch, strengthened by the ap proval of the wisest sort, led by the Chancellor, held the Roman Catholic faction in awe ; restrained the insolence of Bothwell; insisted on the appearance and delivery of all \" at the horn,\" who had hitherto defied the law ; took steps for the speedy and amicable settlement of all Border causes; adopted measures to amend the coin which had been much debased ; and, whilst he continued his favour towards the Kirk, did not scruple to silence some of the wilder sort of the brethren who, in their public sermons, had attacked the Queen of England for her recent 1 MS.

On this last sub ject, the excesses of the Puritans, Elizabeth felt keenly ; and her far-sighted glance had already de tected the dangers of a sect then only in their infancy, but professing principles which she deemed incon sistent with the safety of any well-governed State. Worcester had received pointed instructions in the matter ;J and the Queen herself, when she dismissed Sir John Carmichael the Scottish Ambassador, en forced her wishes in a private letter to James, which is too characteristic to be omitted. It is as follows : \u2014 \" Greater promises, more affection, and grants of more acknowledgings of received good turns, my dear brother, none can better remember than this gentle man, by your charge, hath made me understand; whereby I think all my endeavours well recompensed, that see them so well acknowledged ; and do trust that my counsels, if they so much content you, will serve for memorials to turn your actions to serve the turn of your safe government, and make the lookers on honour your worth, and reverence such a ruler. \"And lest fair semblances, that easily may beguile, do not breed your ignorance of such persons as either pretend religion or dissemble devotion, let me warn you that there is risen, both in your realm and mine, a sect of perilous consequence, such as would have no Kings, but a presbytery ; and take our place, while they enjoy our privilege, with a shade of God's Word, which none is judged to follow right, without by 1 MS.

The ministers, accordingly, were commanded to forbear prayer in their sermons for the persecuted in Eng land;1 and equal activity was shown against the intrigues of the Spaniards and the Catholic faction. When O'Rourke, an Irish chieftain, was detected in Glasgow, secretly beating up for recruits against the English, the King of Scots scrupled not to have him seized and delivered to Elizabeth. \"I would to God,\" said he, writing to the queen, \" your greatest enemies were in my hands ; if it were the King of Spain himself, he should not be long undelivered to you : for that course have I taken me to, and will profess it till I die, that all your foes shall be common ene mies to us both, in spite of the Pope, the King of Spain, and all the leaguers, my cousins not excepted, and the devil their master.\"2 In return for this devotion to her wishes, Eliza beth, forgetting her economy, transmitted, at various intervals, large sums to the King, complimented the young Queen with presents, and flattered her by letters; whilst the Chancellor, who had now consoli dated his power, and could bid defiance to his oppon ents, entered into a cordial correspondence with Burghley. He reminded him of the \"old familiar 1 MS. St. P. Off, Bowes to Burghley, 14th August, 1590. 2 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. Royal Letters.

Speaking modestly of his own inferiority, he yet hoped that their mutual exertions would be followed by the best effects. \" If,\" said he, \" this micro cosme of Britain, separate from the Continent world, naturally joined in situation and language, and, most happily, by religion, shall be, by the indissoluble amity of the two princes, sincerely conserved in union, the Antichristian confederates shall never be able to effect their bloody and godless measures.\" In conclusion, he promised, that whilst Burghley, by his large ex perience and wisdom, held the Roman Catholic party in check, to \" the benefit of all sincerely professing Christ in Europe,\" he would himself keep a watchful eye over their proceedings in Scotland;1 and so rigidly did he fulfil this, that, before the end of the year, watchfulness was turned into persecution, and the Catholics in vain petitioned for liberty of conscience, and pleaded the cruelty of being compelled to sub scribe the Protestant Articles of religion.2 Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that their intrigues with Spain and the Continent should have continued ; and that, although Bowes, the Ambas- 1 MS.

That many unfor tunate and miserable beings, driven by poverty and want, by suspicion and persecution, by the desire of vengeance, the love of power, or a daring curiosity after forbidden knowledge, had renounced their bap tismal vows, and entered, as they believed, into a compact with the author of all evil, cannot be doubted. The difficulty is, to discover whether they were the victims of their own imagination, the dupes of impostors, or, which is not to be rejected as im possible or incredible, the subjects and recipients of diabolic influence and agency. During the summer of this year, the young Laird of Wardhouse had been seized with a mortal sickness which had carried him to the grave ; and it was discovered that several witches had formed his image in wax, which hav ing \" roasted at a slow fire, the gentleman,\" it was said, \" pined away insensibly, but surely, till he died.\" 2 This was alarming enough ; but in the winter still darker deeds came to light, involving higher culprits 1 MS.

Agnes Sampson, a woman, as Spottiswood says, \" not of the base or ignorant sort of witches, but matronlike, grave, and settled in her answers,\" accused Bothwell of consult ing her as to the probable continuance of the King's life; and Richard Graham, a notorious sorcerer, averred that the Earl had sought him on the same errand. Agnes declared, when questioned by the judges, that \"she had a familiar spirit, who upon her call, appeared in a visible form, and resolved her of any doubtful matters, especially concerning life and death. The mode in which she summoned him was by calling out \" Holla, Master !\" an invocation which he had taught her himself. She added, that he had undertaken to make away with the King, but had failed ; pronouncing him, (when challenged by her for his want of success,) to be invulnerable to his incan tations, and muttering, in a language which she did not understand, but which turned out to be respect able French, \"II est homme de Diett.\"1 Of James' labours with this miserable woman, who was con demned and burnt, Bowes wrote to Burghley. The King, he said, by his own especial travel, had drawn Sampson, the great witch, to confess plainly her wicked estate and doings, and to discover sundry things touching his own life ; how the witches sought to have had his shirt, or other linen about him, for the execution of their charms. In these doings the Lord Claud's name was implicated, and sundry other noble 1 Spottiswood, p. 383."], [83, "1590-1. JAMES VI. 59 personages evil spoken of. The number of the witches known, were (he added) about thirty ; but many others were accused of acts filthy, lewd, and fantas tical.1 On a future occasion, the royal curiosity and acuteness were rewarded by the discovery of more particulars involving the guilt of Bothwell. They came out in an examination to which James subjected the wizard Richard Graham, who, upon some hope held out of pardon, confessed that Bothwell sought to draw him to devise some means to hasten the King's death, alleging that he was driven to this to avoid his own ; since a necromancer in Italy had predicted to him that he should become great in power and temporal possession, kill two men, fall into trouble with the King for two capital crimes, be pardoned for the first and suffer for the second. The three first events, he averred, had taken place as foretold him : he had become a mighty baron, had killed Sir William Stewart, and Davie the Devil, meaning David Hume of Manderston; been once par doned ; and now he or the King must go. Graham agreed to assist him ; and James had the satisfaction of hearing some particulars of the incantation. An image of the royal person was formed of wax, and hung up between a tod or fox, over which some spells had been muttered, and the head of a young calf, newly killed. It was added that all this was well known to Jely Duncan, who is described by Bowes as a kind of whipper-in to the witches, being accus- 1 MS. Letter. St. P. Off, Bowes to Burghley, 7th Dec., 1590."], [84, "1591. 60 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. tomed to scour the country and collect together all the Satanic fraternity and sisterhood. But although she admitted, at first, their dealings with Bothwell, she afterwards denied all ; and, as these unfortunate wretches were so severely tortured that one of them died under the rack, it is impossible to receive their evidence without the utmost suspicion.1 Bothwell, however, amid loud asseverations of innocence, was seized and sent to prison, and an early Convention of the Estates called for his trial. But the evidence, by the King's own admission, was slender; the nobles seemed unwilling to countenance any violent proceed ings against him ; and the matter was so long delayed, that his fierce temper would endure confinement no longer; and breaking his prison, he buried himself amongst his friends and fastnesses in the Borders.2 This result greatly irritated the King, who consoled himself bv bringing to trial one of the leading witches, e*/ O \u00a9 ~ 7 named Barbara Napier, a woman well connected, and of whose conviction he entertained no doubt. To his astonishment, the jury did not conceive the evidence sufficient, and acquitted her. The verdict threw James into the greatest rage ; yet it was difficult to know what was now to be done. An assize of error, as it was called, wras a proceeding known and prac tised by the law of England, but it had never been introduced into Scotland ; nor had it been heard of 1 MS. Letter, St. P.

James, however, shut his eyes to all difficulties, and determined to bring the refractory jurors to justice.1 Accordingly, on the 7th of June, repairing from Falkland, he sat in person on the trial of the delinquents. All of them pleaded guilty, and put themselves, as it was then termed, in the King's will, so that there was little scope given to the exercise of regal acuteness. He made an oration, however, some sentences of which give a good picture of the style of his oratory; often pedantic and tedious, but not unfrequently epigrammatic and sen tentious. Alluding to the shocking state of the country and the prevalence of crimes, \" I must ad vertise you,\" said he, \" what it is that makes great crimes to be so rife in this country; namely, that all men set themselves more for friend than for justice and obedience to the laws.

And suppose I be your King, yet I submit myself to the accusations of you, my subjects, in this behalf; and let any one say what I have done. And as I have this begun, so purpose I to go forward ; not because I am James Stuard, and can command so many thou sands of men, but because God hath made me a King and judge, to judge righteous judgment. \" For witchcraft, which is a thing grown very com mon among us, I know it to be a most abominable sin ; and I have been occupied these three quarters of a year for the sifting out of them that are guilty herein. We are taught by the laws, both of God and man, that this sin is most odious ; and by God's law punishable by death. By man's law it is called Maleficium or Veneficium, an ill deed, or a poisonable deed, and punishable likewise by death. Now, if it be death as practised against any of the people, I must needs think it to be (at least) the like if it be against the King. Not that I fear death; for I thank God I dare in a good cause abide hazard.\" * * \" As for them,\" he concluded, \" who think these witchcrafts to be but fantasies, I remit them to be catechised and instructed in these most evident points.\"1 James, perhaps, felt somewhat doubtful upon the subject of his personal courage, and was aware 1 MS. St. P. Off. The inquest which first went upon Barbara Nep., called before the King in the Tolbooth, 7th June, 1591."], [87, "1591. JAMES VI. 63 that his subjects shared in his apprehensions ; but he was little aware how soon his courage and determi nation were to be put to the test, by the frightful state of the country and the frequent attacks upon the royal person. So, however, it happened Between private feuds, the continuance of Catholic intrigues, the active and indignant counter-movements of the Kirk, and the open rebellion of Bothwell, whose power and reckless bravery made him formidable to all parties, the whole land was thrown into a deplorable state of tumult and insecurity. In the Highlands, the Earl of Huntly and the Earl of Murray, two of the greatest houses in the North, engaged in a deadly quarrel, which drew in the lairds of Grant, Calder, Macintosh, and others, and made the fairest districts a prey to indiscriminate havoc and murder.1 At Court all was commotion and apprehension from the rivalry of the Master of Glammis, who began to be a favourite of the King, and Chancellor Thirlstane, who would brook no rival in power.2 On the Borders, Bothwell welcomed every broken man and cruel murderer who chose to ride under his banner. Some time previous to the trials of the witches, this daring chief had invaded the Supreme Court, and carried off a witness from the bar, who was about to give evidence against one of his retainers, whilst the King, although in the next room, did not dare to interfere.3 After his 1 MS.

Douglas of Spot, however, one of the principal leaders in this attack, lost time, by attempting to set at liberty some of his men who were imprisoned in the Palace. Au alarm was given : the King took refuge in one of the turrets ; the Chancellor barricaded his room, and bravely beat off the assailants ; whilst the citizens of Edinburgh, head- ed by their Provost, rushed into the outer court of the Palace, and cutting their way through the outer ranks of the Borderers, compelled Bothwell to a precipitate flight.1 He soon, however, became as formidable as ever ; entered into a secret correspon- dence with England ; leagued with the Duke of Lennox, who had quarrelled with Thirlstane ; procur- ed the countenance of the Kirk, by professing the most determined hostility to Huntly and the Catholic faction; and flattered himself, not without good grounds, that his next attack would be successful. Meanwhile a tragedy occurred, which, even in that age, familiar with scenes of feudal atrocity, occasioned unusual horror. The reader may perhaps remember the utter destruction brought by the Regent Murray upon the great Earl of Huntly ; his execution, and that of one of his sons, the forfeiture of his immense 1 MS.

Time, which softens or dilutes most feelings, only added intensity to this ; and now when the hour of repay ment was come, the debt was exacted with fearful interest. The then Earl of Murray, a Stewart, and representative of the famous Regent, was one of the bravest and handsomest men of his time ; a favourite at Court, and dear to the people and the Kirk, who still looked fondly back to the days of his great ancestor. In deeds of arms and personal prowess, an old chronicle describes him as a sort of Amadis ; \" comely, gentle, brave, and of a great stature and strength of body.\"2 This young nobleman had princely possessions in the North, and for some years dead ly feud had raged between him and Huntly; but Lord Ochiltree, a Stewart, a firm friend of Murray's, was at this time exerting himself to bring about an agreement between the two barons ; and had so far succeeded, that Murray, with a slender retinue, left 1 See supra, vol. vi. p. 308-313. 8 Historic of James the Sext, p. 246. VOL. IX. F"], [90, "1591. 66 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. his northern fastnesses, and came to his mother's castle of Dunibristle, a short distance from the Queensferry. Huntly, his enemy, was then at Court in constant attendance upon the King; and Ochiltree, who had communicated with him, and informed him of Murray's wishes for a reconciliation, took horse and rode to Queensferry, intending to pass to Duni bristle and arrange an amicable meeting between the rival Earls. To his surprise, he found that a royal order had been sent, interdicting any boats from ply ing that day between Fife and the opposite coast. But little suspicion was occasioned : he believed it some measure connected with the hot pursuit then going on against Bothwell, and was satisfied to abandon his journey to Dunibristle. This proved the destruction of his poor friend. That very day, the 7th of February, the King hunted; and Huntly, giving out that he meant to accompany the royal cavalcade, assembled his followers to the number of forty horse. Suddenly he pretended that certain news had reached him of the retreat of Bothwell ; extorted from the King permission to ride against this traitor ; and passing the ferry, beset the house of Dunibristle, and summoned Murray to surrender. This was re fused; and, in spite of the great disparity in numbers, the Stewarts resisted till nightfall, when Huntly, col lecting the corn-stacks, or ricks, in the neighbouring fields, piled them up against the walls, commanded the house to be set on fire, and compelled its unhappy inmates to make a desperate sally that they might escape being burnt alive. In this outbreak the"], [91, "1591. 67 JAMES VI. Sheriff of Murray was slain ; but the young Earl, aided by his great stature and strength, rushed forth all burned and blackened, with his long and beautiful tresses on fire and streaming behind him, threw him self with iresistible fury on his assailants, broke through the toils like a lion,1 and escaped by speed of foot to the sea shore. Here, unfortunately, his hair and the silken plume of his helmet blazed through the dark ness; and his fell pursuers, tracing him by the trail of light, ran him into a cave, where they cruelly murdered him. His mortal wound, it was said, was given by Gor don of Buckie, who, with the ferocity of the times, see ing Huntly drawing back, cursed him as afraid to go as far as his followers, and called upon him to stab his fallen enemy with his dagger, and become art and part of the slaughter, as he had been of the conspir acy. Huntly, thus threatened, struck the dying man in the face with his weapon, who, with a bitter smile, upbraided him \" with having spoilt a better face than his own.\"2 The outcry against this atrocious murder was deep and universal. Ochiltree, who had been deceived by Huntly and the Chancellor, became loud in his clamours for revenge. In the North, Lord Forbes, an attached friend of Murray, carried his bloody shirt on a spear's head; and marching with the ghastly banner through his territories, incited his 1 The simile is Ashton's, in a letter to Bowes. 2 MS.

In the capital, the Lady Doune, mother of the murdered Earl, who with her daughters had narrowly escaped death at Dunibristle, exhibited the mangled corpses of her son and his faithful follower the Sheriff of Murray in the church at Leith ; and Huntly, followed everywhere by a yell of public execration, fled first to Ravensheugh, a castle of Sinclair Baron of Roslin, and afterwards to his own country in the North. Amid all this tumult and ardent demands for in stant justice and vengeance, the King exhibited such indifference, that strange suspicions arose, not only against James, but his great adviser the Chancellor, between whom and Huntly there had arisen, for some time before Murray's murder, a suspicious familiarity. Huntly pleaded a royal commission for everything he had done. It was known that the King had been deeply incensed against Murray by a report that he had abetted Bothwell in his late attempt, and had even been seen with him in the palace on the night of the attack. It was remembered that Ochiltree had been prevented, as was alleged, by a royal order sent through the Chancellor, from passing the ferry on the day of the murder; and the gossip of the Court went even so far as to say, that the young Queen's favour for Murray had roused the royal jeal ousy. All this was confirmed, as may well be be lieved, when Huntly, being summoned to deliver himself up and take his trial, obeyed with alacrity; entered into ward in Blackness castle; aud after a"], [93, "1592. 69 JAMES VI. trifling investigation was dismissed and pardoned.1 Against this gross partiality, Ochiltree, Lennox, Athol, and the whole friends of the murdered lord, loudly remonstrated. Bothwell, a Stewart, andcousin-german to Murray, availing himself of this favourable contin gency, united his whole strength with theirs. The Kirk, indignant at the King's favour for Huntly, the head of the Roman Catholics, threw all its weight into the same scale; and James soon found that Murray's death, slightly as he regarded it at first, drew after it fatal and alarming effects. In the N orth, the Earl of Athol, with the Lairds of Macintosh, Grant, Lovat, and their followers, carried fire and sword into Huntly's country, and kindled throughout that region innumerable lesser feuds and quarrels, which, like the moor-burning of their own savage districts, spread from glen to glen, and mountain to mountain, till half the land seemed iii a blaze.2 In the South, the Chancellor Maitland was no longer able to guide the Government with his usual steady and determined hand. Hitherto he had defied all Court storms, and made a bold head against his ene mies ; but his implication as a conspirator with Huntly in the murder of Murray, at first only sus pected, but now, from some recent discoveries, abso lutely certain, raised against him a universal detesta- 1 Historie of James the Sext, p. 248. 2 Moyse's Memoirs, p. 98.

Elizabeth's coldness also annoyed him; and his un easiness was changed into indignation, when he discovered that she looked favourably upon Both well ; and that this traitorous subject, \"who had so lately invaded and dishonoured him, was in corre spondence with her ministers. It was necessary, however, to dissemble his feelings, as the difficulties which now surrounded him were of a complicated kind. It had recently been his policy to balance the two great factions which divided the country, the Catholic and Protestant, as equally as possible: so that into whichever scale he threw the weight of his own authority it might preponderate. This mode of government, borrowed from Elizabeth, wTas more difficult to be carried through with success in Scot land than in the neighbouring country, not only from the superiority in vigour and intellect possessed by that Princess over James, but from the greater feudal strength of the nobility of Scotland, and the greater weakness of the royal prerogative in that kingdom. In England various causes had concurred to destroy the greater barons; the wars of the two Roses were especially fatal to them; and it is well known that the reign of Henry the Eighth had been the grave of many of those potent families who, before that time, were in the habit of dictating to the Crown. But 1 Moyse's Memoirs, p. 97. MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Bowes to Burghley, 17th Dec., 1592."], [95, "1592. 71 JAMES VI. in Scotland not only were the feudal prerogatives more large, but the arm of the law was weaker; and the great houses, such as Hamilton, Argyll, Mar, Huntly, Douglas, and Stewart, were fresh and in vigour. Of all this the King was so well aware, that when Bowes the English Ambassador on one occa sion complained to him, that his reforms were ever in fieri not in posse, James answered, that to reform such nobles as he had, would require the lives of three Kings.1 There can be no doubt, however, that James, although clearly foreseeing the difficulties he was likely to encounter, had determined to weaken and suppress, as far as possible, the greater barons ; and had resolved, by every means in his power, to strengthen the Crown, raise up the middle classes and the lesser barons; and so balance and equalize the various powers of the constitution, that he should be able to hold the reins with a firm hand. There is a passage of a letter of Hudson's, one of the King's favourites, and a gentleman of his Court, which points to this, and shows that, although James greatly favoured the Chancellor, he was more his own minister than has been believed. Elizabeth, it appears, alarmed by some recent favours shown to Huntly, had instructed Hudson to gain this high officer, hoping through him to influence the King; to which Hudson replied to Burghley, that the common opinion that James followed Maitland's guidance was an error; that the King was \" himself the very centre of the 1 MS.

Although (he continued) he bestow favour in great measure upon sundries, it doth not follow that he is directed by them. The Chancellor is a great councillor, and the King seeth that his gifts merit his place; but he folio weth directly his Majesty's course in all.\"1 Acting along with this able minister, James had hitherto been able to hold in check the power of the higher nobles, and to keep the country in something like tranquillity. But the murder of Murray, the im plication of the Chancellor and suspected connivance of the King in this foul transaction; the compulsory retirement of Maitland, and the formidable combin ation which had taken place between the majority of the higher nobles and the Earl of Bothwell, threw the monarch into alarm, and forced him upon some measures which, under other circumstances, he would scarcely have adopted. His late favour to Huntly had damaged him in the affections of the Kirk : he now resolved to court its aid and to flatter it by un wonted concessions. These it is important to notice, as they led to no less a measure than the establish ment of Presbytery by a Prince to whom this form of ecclesiastical government appears to have been especially obnoxious. The acts passed in the par liament 1584, against the discipline and privileges of the Kirk, had long been a thorn in the side of the ministers ; and they now, in an Assembly held some time previous to the meeting of Parliament, resolved 1 MS.

Accordingly, Parliament having assembled in June 1592, the Assembly presented the four following articles or requests to the King : \u2014 1. That the acts of Parliament made in the year 1584 against the discipline and liberty of the Kirk, should be repealed, and the present discipline be ratified. 2. That the act of Annexation should be abolished, and the patrimony of the Kirk restored. 3. That Abbots, Priors, and other Prelates pre tending to ecclesiastical authority, and giving their vote in matters without any delegated power from the Kirk, should not be hereafter permitted to vote in Parliament or other Convention ; and lastly, 4. That the land, which was polluted by fearful idolatry and bloodshed, should be purged.1 The first article, which went to rescind the acts of 1584, was long and keenly debated : for James was acute enough to detect the increased power which this must give to the ministers; and it is certain that no change had taken place in the mind of the monarch as to the dangers to be apprehended from the turbu lence and independence of these bold and able men. The republican principles, the austere morality, and the extreme pulpit license of the Kirk, were 1 Calderwood, pp. 267, 268."], [98, "1592. 74 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. wholly opposed to all his ideas of ecclesiastical polity or civil government; but Maitland, who had now resumed his influence, though still absent from Court, was solicitous to conciliate the friends of the mur dered Murray, and to appease the people ; and assist ing the Kirk at this moment with the full weight of his influence and advice, the King, more from policy than affection, assented to the proposal. An act, accordingly, was passed, which is still regarded as the \" Charter of the Liberties of the Kirk.\" It ratified its system of government by General Assemblies, provincial Synods, Presbyteries, and particular Sessions. It affirmed such courts, with the jurisdiction and discipline belonging to them, to be just, good, and godly; defined their powers, ap pointed the time and manner of their meeting, and declared that the acts passed in 1584 should be in no ways prejudicial to the privileges of the office-bearers in the Kirk in determining heads of religion, matters of heresy, questions of excommunication, appointment and deprivation of ministers ; that another act of the same Parliament granting commissions to Bishops to receive the royal presentations to bishoprics, and to give collation, should be rescinded ; and that all pre sentations should be directed to their particular pres byteries, with full power to give collation and decide all ecclesiastical causes within their bounds, under the proviso that they admitted such ministers as were presented by the King or other lay patrons.1 1 M'Crie's Life of Melvil, p. 403. Aikman's Translation of"], [99, "1592. 75 JAMES VI. Had the Kirk contented itself with these triumphs, and rested satisfied in the King's present dispositions, which appeared wholly in its favour, all things might have remained quiet : for the Catholics, convinced of the madness of their projects, were ready to abstain from all practices inimical to the religion of the State, on the single condition that they should not be perse cuted for their adherence to the ancient faith. But the Kirk were not disposed to take this quiet course. The principle of toleration, divine as it assuredly is in its origin, yet so late in its recognition even amongst the best men, was then utterly unknown to either party, Reformed or Catholic. The permission even of a single case of Catholic worship, however secret, \u2014 the attendance of a solitary individual at a single mass, in the remotest district of the land, at the dead hour of night, in the most secluded chamber, and where none could come but such as knelt before the altar for conscience' sake, and in all sincerity of soul, \u2014 such worship, and its permission for an hour, was considered an open encouragement of Antichrist andldolatry. To extinguish the Mass for ever, to com pel its supporters to embrace what the Kirk considered to be the purity of Presbyterian truth, and this under the penalties of life and limb, or in its mildest form of treason, banishment, and forfeiture, was considered not merely praiseworthy but a point of high religious duty ; and the whole apparatus of the Kirk, the whole Buchanan's History of Scotland; with a Continuation to the Pre sent Time, vol. iii. pp. 185, 186."], [100, "76 1592. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. inquisitorial machinery of detection and persecution, was brought to bear upon the accomplishment of these great ends. Are we to wonder that, under such a state of things, the intrigues of the Catholics for the overturn of a government which sanctioned such a system continued ; that when they knew, or suspected that the King himself was averse to per secution, they were encouraged to renew their in tercourse with Spain ; and to hope that a new out break, if properly directed, might lead either to the destruction of a rival faith, or to the establishment of liberty of conscience. A discovery which occurred at this time corrobor ates these remarks, and drew after it important con sequences. The Kirk, in the course of its inquisitions, in which it was assisted by Sir Robert Bowes, the resident English Ambassador, received certain infor mation that George Ker, a Catholic gentleman and brother of the Abbot of Newbottle, was secretly passing into Spain with important letters. Upon this, Mr Andrew Knox minister of Paisley, setting off with a body of armed men furnished by Lord Ross, traced Ker to Glasgow, and thence to the little isles of the Cumrays in the mouth of the Clyde, where they seized him in the night, immediately after he had got on board the ship which was to carry him to the Continent ; his luggage was then searched, the packets of letters found, and he himself hurried a prisoner to Edinburgh; where the Provost and the citizens, alarmed by the reports which had already reached them, received him with shouts of triumph and exe-"], [101, "1592. 77 JAMES VI. cration. The unfortunate man at first attempted to deny all, and as he had many friends in the Council who opposed severity, was likely to escape ; but at the King's special command he was put to the torture,1 and on the second stroke of the boots confessed the conspiracy ; the main branch of which was to secure and hasten the descent of a Spanish force upon the coast of Scotland. This army was to be joined by the Earls of Huntly, Errol, and Angus, with Sir Patrick Gordon of Auchendown, uncle to Huntly, and other Catholic barons. Amongst the letters seized, and which appeared to be written by Scottish Jesuits and seminary priests to their brethren on the Con tinent, there were found several signatures of the Earls of Huntly, Errol, and Angus. These were written at the bottom of blank sheets of paper, with the seals of these noblemen attached to them ; from which circumstance the plot received the name of the \" Spanish Blanks.\" It was at first suspected by Bowes, who was familiar with all the arcana of con spiracy, that the blanks were written over with ink 1 MS.

Bowes, writing to Burghley, says, \"Commission is given to Justice- Clerk, Blantyre, and George Young, to offer him the torture this day. But many think that he shall suffer the torment without confession.\" It appears by a letter of Bowes to the Queen of England, 21st January, 1592-3, that Mr Andrew Knox received an assur ance from Elizabeth, that \"good disposition and regard should be had of his labours, charges, perils, and services;\" whereupon Mr Andrew returned into his country to search out the haunts of the English Catholics lurking in those parts."], [102, "1592. 78 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. of white vitriol, prepared ; x but it turned out that they were to be filled up afterwards by Ker, accord ing to verbal instructions, and to be delivered to the King of Spain.2 It may well be imagined that this discovery \u2014 serious enough, certainly, in its known features, and around which there was that air of mystery which gave ample scope for all kinds of terror and exaggeration \u2014 was enough to throw the Kirk and the people into a state of high excitement. The Council, having examined the letters, had no doubt of their authenticity. Sir John Carmichael and Sir George Hume were sent to the King, who was at Stirling, to entreat his immediate presence. Angus, then at Edinburgh, and recently returned from an expedition to the North, was committed to the castle of Edinburgh ; and proclamation made that all Jesuits, seminary priests, and excommunicates, should, within three hours, depart the city on pain of death.3 A Convention of the nobility and Pro testant gentry was forthwith held, and, headed by the ministers, presented themselves at the palace, and insisted on the instant prosecution and punishment of the traitors ; declaring their readiness to hazard life and property in the service. The Queen of Scotland, and the powerful house of the Setons, earnestly 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off., Bowes to Burghley, 1st January, 1592-3. 2 MS. Letter, St. P.

He had received information, much about the same time when the Spanish conspiracy came to light, that his traitorous subject Botbwell, who had twice invaded his palace and attempted to seize his person, was received in England and regarded with favour by Elizabeth, Now was the time, he felt, to put down Bothwell for ever. He was well aware that this fierce and formidable insurgent was favoured secretly by the Kirk, and by many of those nobles who now insisted upon the instant pursuit of the Popish earls. He was aware, too, that Elizabeth's alarm on the discovery of the Spanish Blanks would prompt her to advise the most severe measures against the delinquents, and he ably availed himself of all this. To the Kirk and the Protestant barons he gave the most friendly reception ; spoke loudly of Angus' instant forfeiture ; and not only agreed to the pursuit of Huntly, Errol, and their associates, but declared that he would lead the army in person and seize them in their northern strongholds. Nor were these mere 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. 13th January, 1592-3. 2 MS. Letter, St. P. Off., Bowes to Burghley, 13th January, 1592-3."], [104, "1592-3. 80 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. words. Huntly, Errol, and Auchendown, were com manded to enter themselves in ward at St Andrews, before the 5th February ; public proclamation was made that all men should be ready, on the 25th of the same month, with armour and weapons, to march with the King in person against the traitors if they failed to deliver themselves ; and various committees were appointed for the examination of all suspected persons, belonging either to the nobility, barons, burgesses, or clergy.1 All this was most gratifying to the Kirk, and the Protestant leaders amongst the nobility. But, in return for this, the King demanded as cordial a cooperation on their side for the attack and destruction of Bothwell, whose treasons, though of a different nature, were even more flagrant than those of the Catholic earls; and this they were not in a situation to refuse. Having thus secured the cooperation of the Kirk and the Protestant lords against Bothwell, James gave audience to Bowes, who was little prepared for the violence with which he was to be received. The Ambassador had recently found himself in a difficult situation. He had been familiar with all the plots of Bothwell, and looked upon them with no unfavourable eye, although he took care not directly to implicate himself. He had repeatedly applied to Burghley to receive instructions and understand the Queen's wishes : but Elizabeth was too cautious to commit herself; whilst Bowes 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Bowes to Burghley, 19th January, 1592-3."], [105, "1593. JAMES VI. 81 knew for certain that she encouraged Bothwell secretly, and expressed the highest scorn and con tempt for Huntly and the Spanish faction, whom she branded as base traitors who had sold their country. On this subject Elizabeth, shortly before this,1 had sent a letter to James, part of which, relating to the Spanish faction, from its vigour, is worthy of preser vation : \u2014 \" Advance not,\" said she, \" such as hang their hopes on other strings than you may tune. Them that gold can corrupt, think not your gifts can assure. Who once have made shipwreck of their country, let them never enjoy it. Weed out the weeds, lest the best corn fester. Never arm with power such whose bitterness must follow after you ; nor trust not their trust that under any colour will thrall their own soil. \" I may not, nor will I, conceal overtures that of late full amply have been made me, how you may plainly know all the combiners against your State, and how you may entrap them and so assure your kingdom.

And thus, committing you to God's tuition, I shall remain the faithful holder of my vowed amity. \" Your mo,st affectionate Sister and Cousin.1 \" What was James' reply to this obscure epigram matic epistle is not known ; but very shortly after it was written, the Spanish conspiracy came to light, and the Scottish King at the same time discovered the favour shown to Bothwell in England with the full countenance of the Queen. Mr Lock, an agent of Burghley and a near relative of the notorious intriguer John Colvile, brother to the Laird of Easter Wemyss, had been sent down to Scotland with in structions to form a faction with the Kirk and the Protestant barons for Bothwell's restoration ; and their plots had proceeded so far, that the attack upon the palace, which afterwards occurred in the autumn of this year, would probably have been enterprised sooner, but for the discovery of the Spanish Blanks.2 Of all these English intrigues James was now aware ; and when Bowes was admitted to an audience, the monarch broke into a violent passion. The Queen of England, he declared, did him foul injustice in 1 Warrender MS., vol. B, p. 361. Indorsed, Delivered by Mr Bowes, 4th December, 15.92. 2 MS. Letter, St. P. Off., Bowes to Burghley, 2?th December, 1592."], [107, "1593. 83 JAMES VI. countenancing a rebel and traitor like Bothwell. Her subjects received and harboured him, and they pleaded her warrant to do so. If so, he must ac count it done to his scorn and dishonour. However, he should investigate the matter closely; and should it turn out so, (this he said loudly, and in the hearing of many about him,) there was an end to his amity with the Queen, and with every man in England. So unwonted a storm had never yet broken the serene tenorof Janies' temper; andBowes found it diffi cult to appease it even by the most earnest assurances of Elizabeth's innocence.1 In a subsequent interview, however, he was somewhat more successful. The Queen of England despatched a letter written wholly in her own hand, in a strain of so much conciliation, and fraught with so much sound advice, that the mon arch was recovered ; showed the epistle, with many expressions of admiration, to his confidential coun cillors and some of the chief ministers, who reiterated their exhortations to proceed roundly against the Catholic lords. There were some difficulties, how ever, in the way. Huntly solemnly declared his innocence, and affirmed that the blanks were not signed by him. If he, Errol, and Angus, delivered themselves by the appointed day, and were once secured in prison, there was little doubt of the issue ; but if, as suspected, they fled and raised their feudal strength, the King must march against them ; and, with an impoverished Exchequer, who was to pay his MS.

He had looked to have five thousand a-year, the sum allowed by Henry the Eighth to the Queen herself when Princess ; but she had only given him three thousand.1 As to that occasion of which she reminded him, when one year's charges for his behoof had come to nine thousand pounds, and six thousand men been kept in readiness for his service, he protested that by no effort could he recall such things to memory ; but never would he press her for money unless at a time of extreme need like the present. But to explain all more fully, he meant (as he assured Bowes) to send her an ambassador \u2014 Sir Robert Melvil, or some other confidential councillor.2 Meantime, before any such resolution could be acted on, Elizabeth's anxiety and the alarming confessions of Ker prompted her to despatch Lord Burgh with a message to the King, and instructions to press on the trials of the Spanish lords by every possible method. What had been fully expected by all who knew these bold insurgents had now occurred. In stead of a surrender of their persons on the day appointed, Huntly, Errol, Auchendown, and their associates, kept themselves within their strongholds in the North. Angus escaped from the castle of Edinburgh, letting himself down the walls by a rope, and joined his friends in the Highlands; and the King's 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Bowes to Burghley, 27th January, 1.592-3. 5 Id. Ibid."], [109, "1593. 85 JAMES VT. Council, with the higher nobles, became cold and inactive. But the monarch himself was roused by this opposition into unwonted energy. He alone had conducted the examination of Ker, had advocated the use of torture against the advice of his ministers, and by this horrible expedient had extorted a confession. He now hurried forward the trial of Graham of Fintry, had him found guilty, and instantly executed; and having requested the prayers of the Kirk for success in his expedition, and appointed the Earl of Morton to be Lieutenant-general in his absence, he placed himself at the head of his army and proceeded against the rebels.1 To this extraordinary vigour of the King against the Spanish faction, Bowes, in his letter to Burghley, bore ample evidence. After men tioning that Fintry had offered fifty thousand pounds Scots to save his life, the Ambassador observes, \u2014 \" the King in this hath remained resolute ; and alone, without the assistance of any of his council, prose cuted the cause. And now, he saith, that as alone he hath drawn his sword against his rebels, without the Council's aid or allowance of his nobility, so he will proceed, with the help of God, to punish and prosecute the traitors in these high treasons, by all the means in his power ; and with the assistance of his barons, burghs, and Kirk, whom he fin deth ready to aid him therein. He was occasioned to stay his journey two days beyond his diet for the trial and execution of 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Bowes to Burghley, 14th February, 1592-3. Same to same, 15th February, 1592-3.

Fintry, and for some wants which are yet slenderly supplied : nevertheless, he is ready and determined to enter into his rode to-morrow, wherein he shall be well strengthened with his barons ; but few noblemen shall attend upon him.\" 1 On the 24th of February, Lord Burgh, Elizabeth's Ambassador, arrived in Edinburgh; and on his heels came intelligence of the success of the Scottish King.2 James had advanced without a check to Aberdeen. Huntly and Errol, finding it impossible to make head against the royal forces, had fled, slenderly accom panied, to Caithness; and the Earl of Athol, who joined the King with twelve hundred foot and nine hundred horse, was appointed Lieutenant-general be yond Spey, to reduce those unquiet regions and prevent their again falling under the power of the rebels.3 Meanwhile, the Catholic earls were declared forfeited, and their estates seized by the Crown ; but, from some circumstances, it was augured that the King meant to deal leniently, and not utterly wreck them. Strath bogie castle, belonging- to Huntly, was given to Archi bald Carmichael, with sixteen of the royal guard for a garrison ; but the Countess of Huntly, sister to the Duke of Lennox, was allowed to retain, for her win ter residence, the Bog of Gicht, his greatest castle 1 MS.

Errol's father-in-law, the Earl Marshal, bought his son's escheat for a thousand marks, with the keeping of his castle of Slanes: his mother held his other house of Logie- Almond for her jointure ; and Athol, whose sister he had married for his second wife, became factor of his other possessions. Angus was more severely dealt with, not being saved by any connex ion or relationship with men in power.1 His house and castle of Tantallon were delivered to the keeping of the Laird of Pollard; Bonkle and Preston to William Hume, brother of the King's favourite, Sir George Hume; Douglasdale, and the rest of his lands, seized for debt. On the whole, however, the rebel lords, considering their crimes, were leniently dealt with. Their persons were safe in the fastnesses of Caithness; their patrimonal interest, and rights of succession, were considered to be still entire, till an act of Parliament had confirmed the forfeitures ; and part of their estates were placed in friendly hands. So evident was all this, that Lord Burgh wrote to 1 Angus' mother was a Graham, daughter of the Laird of Mor phy. He married the eldest daughter of the Lord Oliphant. MS. St. P. Off, 1st July, 1592.

Was she not as deeply concerned to hinder the Spaniard setting his foot in Scotland as in France or the Low Countries ? At this moment money was imperatively called for ; an armed force of large ex tent must be kept up ; he needed troops to guard his person, exposed to hourly danger from the plots of his nobles, and the snares of the arch-traitor Both well, with whose daring character she was too well acquainted : \u2014 he needed them to overawe the dis tricts still favourable to the Catholic lords \u2014 to garri son their houses, which, according to his good si.ster's advice, he had seized \u2014 to watch the coast where the Spaniards were likeliest to land \u2014 to repulse them, if they effected a descent. The cause was common to both ; and he looked not only for sympathy and counsel, but for hard coin and brave men. On one point he assured Burgh, that the message which he took back must be peremptory. \"Bothwell,\" said he, \" that vile traitor, whose offences against me are un pardonable, and such as, for example's sake, should make him to be abhorred by all sovereign Princes, is harboured in England : let my sister expel him, 1 MS.

Should he henceforth be con sorted or concealed in her dominions, 1 must roundly assure her, not only that our amity is at an end, but that I shall be enforced to join in friendship with her greatest enemies for my own safety.\"1 This spirited remonstrance was not out of place ; for at this moment Elizabeth, pursuing her old policy of weakening Scotland, by destroying its tranquillity and keeping up its internal commotions, was encour aging Bothwell to a new and more desperate attempt against the King and his government. Lord Burgh had received secret instructions to entertain this fierce and lawless man. To discover his strength and means, and increase his faction at Court and with the ministers of the Kirk, was the secret part of this Ambassador's mission; and when James expressed to Bowes his admiration of the eloquence, grace, and courtly man ners of this nobleman, he little knew the hidden mine which he was digging under his feet. Yet so it was. Bothwell had offered his services to the English Queen ; had written to Lord Burghley ; had received an answer of encouragement, though cautiously word ed; and had been ordered by the High Treasurer to write secretly to the Queen.2 It will immediately 1 Answers for the Lord Burgh, concerning Bothwell.

Meanwhile, the various factions and family feuds amongst the nobility had increased to such a degree, that the whole cares of the government fell upon the monarch ; and James, naturally indolent and fond of his pastimes, began to languish for the return of the Chancellor Maitland. This powerful minister had been driven from Court by the antipathy of the Queen of Scots, the Duke of Lennox, and the whole faction of the Stewarts, who held him as their mortal enemy, and had repeatedly plotted against his life. The exact cause of the Queen's \" heavy wrath \" against Maitland, appears to have been a mystery alike to the King and to Bowes ; but it was deeply rooted, and nearly touched her honour. He was at deadly feud also with the Master of Glammis, and hated by Bothwell, who regarded him as the author of all his calamities, and the forger of that accusation of witchcraft, under the imputation of which he was now a banished and broken man. It was difficult for the King to recall to power a minister who lay under such a load of enmity ; and, for the present, he was contented to visit him in his retreat at Leth ington, and consult him upon the affairs of Govern ment.1 All, however, looked to his probable restora- 1 MS.

Nothing, at this moment, could be more deplorable than the torn and distracted state of the Scottish no bility. The Duke of Lennox and the Lord Hamilton, the two first noblemen in the realm, were at mortal feud ; the subject of their quarrel being an attempt, on the part of Lennox, to get himself declared the next in succession to the Crown, to the exclusion of the prior right of the family of Hamilton.1 Huntly again, and all those barons who supported him, were at feud with the potent Earl of Athol, and the whole race of Stewart ; the cause of their enmity being an un quenchable thirst of revenge for the murder of the Earl' of Murray. Argyll, Ochiltree, and all the barons who adhered to them, were at feud with Lord Thirlstane the Chancellor, Lord Hume, Lord Flem ing, and their faction and allies ; in which course they were urged forward by the enmity of the Queen of Scots.2 It is difficult, by any general expressions, to convey a picture of the miserable state of a country torn by such feuds as these. Nor were these the sole causes of disquiet : Huntly, Angus, and Errol, although declared traitors, were at large in the North; Bothwell, whom the King justly regarded as his mortal enemy, was also at liberty, harboured some times on the Borders, sometimes in England, and even daring to enter the capital in disguise and hold secret intercourse with the noblemen about the King's 1 MS.

The intrigues of the Catholics, although checked by the late discoveries, were not at an end ; and the ministers of the Kirk, utterly dissatisfied with the leniency which James had exhibited to the rebel earls, began to attack his conduct in the pul pit, and to throw out surmises of his secret inclina tions to Popery. Is it a subject of wonder that James, thus surrounded with danger and disquietude, with out a minister whom he could trust, or a nobility on whose loyalty and affections he could for a moment depend, should have been driven into measures which may often appear inconsistent and capricious ? The sole party on whom he could depend was that of the ministers of the Kirk, with the lesser barons and the burghs;1 and their support was only to be bought at the price of the utter destruction of the Catholic earls, and the entire extirpation of the Catholic faith. To this sweeping act of persecution the monarch would not consent. At this moment thirteen of the nobility of Scotland were Catholics;2 and, in the northern counties, a large proportion of the people were attached to the same faith. It was insisted on, by the leading ministers of the Kirk, in a Conven tion of the Estates which the King summoned at this time,3 that the strictest investigation should be made for the discovery and imprisonment of all 1 MS.

The severity and intolerance of such demands will be best understood by quoting the words of the original. The Kirk represented that, \" Seeing the increase of Papistry daily within this realm,\" it was craved of his Majesty, with his Council and nobility at that time assembled, \" that all Papists within the same may be punished according to the laws of Godand of therealm. That the Act of Parliament might, ipso facto, strike upon all manner of men, landed or unlanded, in office or not, as it at present strikes against beneficed persons.

That upon this declaration, the pains of 'homing' and other civil pains should follow, as upon the sentence of excommunication ; and that an Act of Council should be passed to this effect, which in the next Parliament should be made law.\" If the King agreed to these demands, the Convention promised, for their part, that \" their bodies, goods, friends, allies, s?r-"], [118, "94 1593.

The effects of this were soon apparent. In stead of the happy tranquillity which had reigned during his absence in Denmark, and which he had mainly ascribed to the efforts of the ministers, the capital, as the time of the Parliament approached, presented almost daily scenes of outrage and confu sion. The security and sanctity of domestic life were invaded and despised ; ruffians, under the command, and openly protected by the nobles, tore honourable maidens from the bosom of their families, and carried them off in open day. James Gray, a brother of the 1 MS. St. P. Off. Humble petition of the General Assembly of the Kirk, craved of his Majesty's Council and nobility pre sently convened.

Next day, the chief magistrate carried his complaint in person before the King. \" Do you see here any of my nobles whom you can accuse?\" said James. At that moment Hume was standing beside James ; but when the un happy Provost encountered his fierce eye, the impeach ment stuck in his throat from terror, and he retired silent and abashed.1 The outrage was the more shame ful, as Gray was a gentleman of the King's suite, and had been assisted by Sir James Sandilands and other courtiers ; whilst the Duke of Lennox and the Earl of Mar were playing tennis hard by, and abstained from all interference. So atrocious an insult upon the laws, and the miserable weakness exhibited by the King, appear to have made a deep impression on Burghley, who has written on the margin of Bowes' letter this pithy note \u2014 \" A miserable State, that may cause us to bless ours, and our Governess.\"2 It was 1 MS.

Ardkinglass was a relative and favourite of Argyll, who assembled his friends, and on the day of trial entered the capital with a formidable force. The accused was about to be married to a natural daughter of Lord John Hamilton, which occasioned the muster of the whole power of that house ; and the Chancellor Thirlstane, esteeming the opportunity a favourable one to exhibit his strength, and prepare the way for his return to Court, rode fromhis retirement into the city, attended byArbroath, Montrose, Seton, Livingston, Glencairn, Eglinton, and other powerful friends.1 This again was suffi cient to rouse the fears of his enemies, the party of the Queen ; who assembled in great strength, led by the Duke of Lennox, and numbering in their ranks, Mar, Morton, Hume, the Master of Glammis, Sir George Hume, Lord Spiny, and Sir James Sandi lands. The Border barons too, Lord Maxwell and Cessford, were on their march ; the Lords of Ses sion, who had to try the criminal, and trembled for their lives, had resolved to raise a body of a hun dred men to protect them ; and the townsmen were, in the meantime, kept day and night under arms.

Captain James Stew art, once the formidable and haughty Earl of Arran, had been seen lately in the palace. It was known he had been favourably received by James in several secret interviews ; the Queen and the Duke were his friends ; his misfortunes had neither tamed his pride, nor quelled that fierce energy and unscrupulous dar ing which had prompted him to destroy the Regent Morton ; and at this crisis, when all were anticipat ing the return of the Chancellor to power, it was suspected that the enemies of Maitland had deter mined to recall Stewart, and employ him for the destruction of this minister.2 He had already pulled down one far mightier from his palmy state : what. said the Queen and Lennox, was to prevent him from being successful against auother ? Amid these complicated distresses James hail scarcely one councillor on whom he could rely. With his capital bristling with steel-clad barons, each feel ing himself superior to the throne or the law ;\" the streets in possession of tumultuous bodies of retainers and feudal banditti, armed to the teeth and com manded by men at mortal feud with each other; his court and palace divided by the intrigues of the several rival factions; diffident even of the gentlemen who waited on his person : distracted by reports that 1 MS.

But the emer gency seemed to rouse him ; and by an unusual exer tion of firmness and good sense, he succeeded in warding off the dangers, persuaded the barons to dismiss their followers, and brought about a recon ciliation between the Queen's faction, led by the Duke, and their powerful enemy the Chancellor Thirlstane. It had long been evident to the King that, in the present state of the country, no hand but that of Maitland could save the Government from absolute wreck and disruption ; and it was agreed, that on the conclusion of the Parliament, which was now on the eve of meeting, this minister should re turn to Court, and be reinstated in his high office.2 Scarce, however, was this danger averted than the city was thrown into a new state of excitement by the shrieks and lamentations of a troop of miserable women, who had travelled from the Borders, the victims and survivors of a recent raid conducted by 1 MS.

Their purpose was to throw themselves before the King, and demand justice for the slaughter of their sons and husbands, whose bloody shirts they held above their heads, exhibiting them to the people as they marched through the streets, and imprecating vengeance upon their mur derers. It was a sight which, in any other country, might well have roused both pity and indignation ; but though the people murmured, the ghastly proces sion passed on without further notice, and neither King nor noble condescended to interfere.1 The Parliament now assembled ; but its proceed ings were delayed by a quarrel between the higher nobles for the precedency in bearing the honours. At length it was arranged that Lennox should carry the crown, Argyll the sceptre, and Morton the sword ; and that, in the absence of the Chan cellor Maitland, Alexander Seton, President of the Session, should fill his place, and conduct the pro ceedings.2 Bothwell was then forfeited, and proclaim ed a traitor at the Cross ; and the Queen's jointure, which had been settled at her marriage, and regard ing which some difficulties had arisen, was confirmed. To conciliate the Kirk, an act was passed exempting ministers' stipends from taxation ; another statute was introduced against the Mass; and a strict inquisition ordered to be made for all Papists and seminary priests : but on the great subject for which it was 1 MS.

Huntly, Errol, Angus, and Auchendown, escaped forfeiture. It had been secretly resolved by the King, that no extreme proceedings should be adopted against these noble men, who had a numerous and powerful party on their side,1 till Sir Robert Melvil, then at the English Court, had brought an answer from Elizabeth ; and although the Earl of Argyll, Lord Forbes, Lord Lindsay, and the Protestant faction, anxiously urged the most severe measures, James was resolute. Mi- David Makgill, the King's advocate, a man of extra ordinary talent, but who had often opposed the Kirk, declared that the summonses were informal; the evidence of traitorous designs and correspondence with Spain insufficient ; and that it was impossible for any act of attainder to pass in the present meet ing of the Estates.2 This for the time settled the matter : but the Kirk were deeply indignant; and their champion, Mr John Davison, denounced the proceedings, and attacked the sovereign in the pulpit on the Sunday which suc ceeded their close. \" It was a black Parliament,\" lie said ; \" for iniquity was seated in the High Court of Justice, and had trodden equity under foot.

Let us pray,\" said he, in conclusion \" that the King, by some sanctified plagues. may be turned again to God.\"1 Such plagues as Davison thus prayed for, were nearer at hand than many imagined : for Elizabeth, ac cording to her favourite policy, had more than one plot now carrying forward in Scotland. Her accredited Am bassador, Sir Robert Bowes, was indeed instructed to keep up the most friendly assurances, and to promise the King of Scots her cordial assistance in defeating Bothwell, and destroying the Roman Catholic faction : yet at this moment she had sent Mr Henry Lock into Scotland, who with his brother-in-law, the notorious Mr John Colvil, and Bothwell himself, met secretly in Edinburgh, and organized a formidable confederacy,2 the object of Avhich was to bring in Bothwell, take possession of the King's person, overwhelm the Chancellor Maitland who was on the eve of being recalled to power, and render the Kirk triumphant over its enemies. To this plot the Duke of Lennox, the Earl of Mar, the Earl of Athol, Lord Ochiltree, and the whole noblemen and barons of the name and race of Stewart were parties; and they chose this meeting of the three Estates, when the King was surrounded by many of their faction, to carry their 1 MS.

The Parliament was now about to terminate, when, on the night of the 23d of July, Bothwell was secretly conveyed into the house of Lady Gowrie, which adjoined the palace of Holyrood. This lady's daughter was the Countess of Athol, to whose courage and ingenuity the success of the plot was principally owing. Early in the morning of the 24th of July, she smuggled Bothwell and Mr John Colvil, by a back passage, into the anteroom adjoining the King's bedchamber, hid them behind the arras, removed the weapons of the guard, and locked the door of the Queen's bedchamber, through which the King might have escaped. The gates of the palace were then occupied by the Duke and Athol, who placed a guard upon them. All this time James was asleep ; but he awoke at nine, and calling for one of the gentlemen of his bedchamber, got up and threw his nightgown about him. An alarm now suddenly rose in the next room; and the King rushing out with his hose about his heels, and his under-garments in his hands, confronted Bothwell, who had glided from behind the hangings, and stood with his drawn sword in his hand, Colvil being beside him. James shouted \" Treason!\" and ran to the door of the Queen's bedroom ; but it was found locked : and nothing re mained but to face his enemy, which, when driven to it, he did with unwonted spirit, and his usual voluble eloquence. \" Come on,\" said he, \" Francis : you seek my life, and I know I am wholly in your power. Take your King's life : I am ready to die. Better to die with honour than live in captivity and shame."], [127, "1593. 103 JAMES VI.

You protest, for sooth, you only come to sue for pardon, to submit yourself to your trial for witchcraft, to be cleansed by your peers of the foul imputations which lie heavy on you. Does this violent manner of repair look like a suppliant ? Is it not dishonourable to me, and dis graceful to my servants who have allowed it ? What do you take me for ? Am I not your anointed King, twenty-seven years old, and no longer a boy or a minor, when every faction could make me their pro perty? But you have plotted my death, and I call upon you now to execute your purpose : for I will not live a prisoner and dishonoured.\" As he said this, the King sat calmly down, as if prepared for the worst ; but Bothwell, still on his knees, loudly disclaimed all such murderous intentions, and kissing the hilt of his sword, took it by the point, delivered it to his sovereign, and placing his head beneath James' foot, bared his neck of its long tresses, (then the fashion of the young gallants of the day,) and called upon him to strike it off if he believed that he ever harboured a thought against his royal person.1 The Duke of Lennox, Athol and Ochiltree, now vehemently interceded for the Earl; and James, raising him from the ground, retired into a window recess to talk apart; when an uproar arose below in 1 MS.

James, however, who dreaded to be slain, or torn in pieces, if the two factions came to blows, commanded the citizens to disperse; and taking refuge in that dissimulation of which he was so great a master, pretended to be reconciled to Bothwell, fixed a near day for his trial, and simply stipulated that, till he was acquitted, he should retire from Court. To all this the Earl agreed. Next day his peace was proclaimed by the heralds at the Cross. The people, of whom he was a great favourite, crowded round him ; and not only his own faction, which was very strong, but the ministers of the Kirk showed themselves high ly gratified at his return.1 Having settled this, Bothwell left the capital; and attended only by two servants, rode to Ber wick, where he had an interview with Mr John Carey, the son of Lord Hunsdon, and Governor of that Border town ; showed him the commission under the King of Scots* hand assuring him of pardon; professed the utmost devotion to Elizabeth ; and declared that, Avithin a brief season, he expected to be made \"Lieu tenant-general of the whole country.\"2 He then 1 M.S.

All was in vain, however. The Scottish Earl settled himself on the venerable dignitary, and \" putting him to silence,\" ran over the story of his whole courses, and ended with his late seizure of the King. Mathews, who had no mind to be made a party in such violent matters, did not permit his eyelids to slumber till he had written an account of it all to Burghley. His letter, which is dated at midnight, on the 2d August, gives us an excellent account of the interview. \" This day,\" says he, \" about three of the clock afternoon, came hither to my house the Earl Both well, thereunto moved, as he protested, as well by some good opinion of me conceived, as for that he understands I am one of her Majesty's Council estab lished in the North. * * And, albeit, I was very loath to enter into any speech of the Scottish affairs, especially of State, wishing him to write thereof to your Lordship, or to the Lord President; or, if he so thought good, to negotiate his business with her Majesty's Ambassador resident in Scotland, \u2014 yet could I not avoid it; but he would needs acquaint me"], [130, "106 1593.

' Well done once, my lord,' quoth I, 'is double well said;' which word, although he took somewhat displeasantly, yet did it occasion him to affirm and confirm the same, over and over again, so far as possibly may stand with the amity of both the Princes, and the perpetual conservation of religion now openly professed both in England and Scotland. \" Then began he to discourse the manner and means of his late enterprise, and entrance to the King's presence ; * * which, to mine understanding, was a plain surprise of the King in his bedchamber, made by the Earl and another gentleman, in the sight of the Duke, the Earls of Mar and Athol, with others his friends purposely assembled : his sword in his hand, drawn ; the King fearfully offering to withdraw himself into the Queen's chamber, which before was devised to be kept shut against him.

Whereunto the Earl made answer by utter denial, saving that her Highness had a princely commiseration of his distressed estate, so far only as to yield him to take the benefit of the air of her country for preservation of his liberty and life, so narrowly sought by the King ; so directly and cruelly by his adversaries. * * The King, with marvellous vehemency, insisted long upon that point, and eftsoons conjured him, ' by all the faith he bare him, by all the allegiance he owed him, by all the love he professed to him, by all the favour he hoped for ever to find of him, that he should not conceal Elizabeth's dealings from him ; being,' as he said, ' a matter so manifest.' But,\" continued Dr Toby to Burghley, \"the more violently the King sought to sift him, the more resolute was the Earl, not only peremptorily to disclaim every particular thereof, but in sort, as he could, to charge the King with much unkindness and unthankfulness causelessly to carry such jealousy and suspicion of her Majesty, who had hitherto been so gracious a lady, yea a very mother unto him; and, under the providence of God, the only supporter of his estate that ever he found, or is like to find upon earth. \u2014 ' Now hear."], [132, "1593. 108 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND.

To whom, with your pardon, Sir, I will ascribe not only my lands and living, but my life, with liberty and honour, which is most of all, not only as freely bestowed upon my self, but extended to all mine and my posterity : so as it shall never be seen or heard that ever Earl Bothwell, for all the crowns of France, for all the ducats in Spain, for all the siller and gold in the Indies East and West, for all the kingdoms in Europe, Africa, and Asia, .shall utter one word in Council, or bear arms in field, against the amity of the two realms and princes, and the religion now by them authorized.

Meanwhile, the royal captive had not been idle. Although surrounded by his enemies and strictly watched, he contrived to receive messages from Huntly, who was mustering a large force in the North; and secretly communicated with Lord Hume and the .Master of Glammis on the best way of making his escape. He was assisted in this by three gentlemen of the house of Erskine, who had been permitted to remain about his person. They employed two others of his attendants, named Lesley aud Ogilvy ; and it was resolved that a rescue should be attempted im mediately after the trial of Bothwell, when the King was to pass over the Forth from Holyrood to Falk land. A fleet horse was to be ready at the park gate ; James, eluding his guards, was to mount and gallop to Lochleven ; whilst Hume, with all his forces, making an onset on the opposite faction, who had been assembled for the trial in the capital, hoped either to seize their leaders or put them to death.3 All 1 MS.

The trial now came on, and lasted from one in the forenoon till ten at night. In the indictment the Earl was accused, on the evidence of several deposi tions made by Richard Graham, who had been burnt for witchcraft, of three several attempts against, the King's life and estate : one by poison ; another by fabricating a waxen image in the likeness of the monarch ; and the last, by enchantments to prevent his ever returning out of Denmark. The poison Avas compounded, according to the declaration of the wizard, of adders' skins, toads' skins, and the hippo manes in the head of a young foal ; and was to be placed where it might ooze down upon the King's head where he usually sat, a single drop being of such devilish and pestilent strength as to cause instant death. The defence of the Earl was conducted by Craig the famous feudal lawyer, who contended that Graham's various depositions were not only inconsis tent and contradictory in themselves, but refuted by the declarations of his miserable sisters in sorcery \u2014 Sampson, Macalzean, and Napier ; whilst he proved, by unexceptionable evidence, that Graham had been induced to accuse Bothwell under a promise of par don signed by the King's Council, and from the terror of being tortured. The Earl also defended himself with much spirit and eloquence; and the result was, his triumphant acquittal ; which, considering the strength of his party at this moment, would probably VOL. IX.

William Lesley, one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber, carrying with him the King's ring and a letter for Lord Hume, was passing as silently as he could through the court-yard; when Bothwell, who slept in the palace, was awak ened by the watch, who suspected some secret practice, and rushing down seized the messenger, found on his person the King's letter and signet, and discovered the whole. The rest of the gentlemen were then arrested and delivered to the guard ; and the Earl, repairing to the King, who was by this time making ready to take horse, interdicted the journey, and charged him with his breach of promise. A stormy interview ensued. James insisted that he would ride to Falkland. Bothwell assured him that he should not leave the palace till the country was more settled. \" You and your fellows,\" said James, \" have broken your promises, imprisoned my servants, and now think to hold me a captive. Where are the three Erskines? where is Gilbert Ogilvy? where the faithful Lesley ? Did ye not swear that I should return, after the trial, to Falkland; and that you,Both well, should withdraw from my company as soon as you were cleared by an assize?\" \u2014 \"And so we shall,\" 1 MS.

Off, B.C., Mr John Carey to Burghley, 12th August, 1593."], [139, "1593. 115 JAMES VI. replied the Earl. \"But first, my liege, we must be re laxed from the horn, restored to our lands and offices, and see the foul murder of the Earl of Murray punish ed. They who slew him are known ; they, too, Avho signed the warrant for the slaughter, the Chancellor Maitland, Sir George Hume, and Sir Robert Melvil.\" \u2014 \" Tush, tush,\" said the King ; \" a better man than you, Bothwell, shall answer for Sir Robert.\" \u2014 \"I deny that,\" insolently retorted Bothwell; \" unless the man you mean is your Majesty himself.\" This was a home thrust, for it had been long suspected that the King was indirectly implicated in the fate of Murray; and when the Earl proceeded to charge the Erskines with the conspiracy for escape, nothing could equal James' indignation, and all hopes of a reconciliation seemed at an end.1 It was in vain that the ministers of the Kirk were summoned to promote peace : they pre vailed nothing; and, as a last resource, Bowes the English Ambassador was called in. With matchless effrontery he declared his mistress' astonishment at the enterprise of Bothwell; regretted the facility with which so treasonable an invasion had been pardoned ; and expressed her anxiety for the safety of the King's person, and the preservation of the country from rebellion. James answered, that it was not for him to answer for the enterprise of Bothwell. He was no ac complice, but its victim ; and for the traitors who now kept him, they had forsworn themselves, and broken every promise. Was he not prevented from free access to his own palace of Falkland ? Had they 1 MS. Letter, St. P.

He might seem in a help less state; but he was their King: and sooner would he suffer his hand to be cut from his wrist than sign any letter of remission at their imperious bidding ; sooner endure the extremity of death, than consent to live a captive, and in dishonour. Bowes assured him of his mistress' sympathy ; advised an amicable settlement ; and at last, after two days' labour, with the assistance of some mediators selected from the ministers, the judges of the Session, and the chief magistrates of the city, succeeded in bringing the parties to an agreement. During the whole of these conferences, the King appears to have behaved with such unwonted spirit and resolution, that it is evident he must have been assured of a large party, and of near and speedy succour. He declared, in sharp terms, to the ministers of the Kirk, that he would either be once more a free monarch and released from these traitors, or proclaim himself a captive : and he charged them, on their allegiance, to let his mind be known to his people ; to exhort them to procure his delivery by force ; and to assure them he would hazard his life to attain it.2 When Athol proposed himself to be appointed Lieutenant-governor in the North, with full power 1 MS.

Meanwhile, with that elasticity and levity with which he could cover his gravest purposes, he resumed his gaiety, partook of a banquet at Bothwell's house in Leith, appeared wholly bent on his pastime, and rode to Inchmurrin to hunt fallow-deer. 2 1 MS.

In the late revolution James had exhibited unusual firmness; and this last compromise with Bothwell was almost a victory. Nor was he deceived in his expec tations of still farther triumph over this insolent noble, whom he now justly regarded as the leader of the English party and of the Kirk. The resolu tion and courage which the King had exhibited, con vinced his turbulent barons that he was no longer a minor, or a puppet, to be tossed about from faction to faction, and made the helpless and passive instru ment of their ambition. Many of them, therefore, began to attach themselves to the royal faction, from self-interest rather than loyalty ; and however fatal to the peace of the country, the deadly feuds which existed amongst the nobles, by preventing combina tion, formed the strength of the monarch at this moment. It was evident that Bothwell had either"], [143, "1593. 119 JAMES VI. deceived Elizabeth or himself, when he spoke to Carey and Mathews of his overwhelming strength, and the facility with which he could guide the government of Scotland according- to the wishes of his renowned Empress. Already his ally, the Duke of Lennox, young, capricious, and a favourite of James, began to waver ; and before the appointed Convention met at Stirling on the 9th of September, a powerful re action had taken place, which no efforts of English intrigue could arrest. It was in vain that Elizabeth, Burghley, and SirRobert Cecil his son, who now acted as a chief councillor in all \"Scottish causes,\" exerted themselves to keep up a faction, and even entered into a secret communication with Huntly and the Popish party, in the vain hope of bringing about a coalition between them and Bothwell. The effort to join with the Roman Catholics, whom they had so often stigmatized as enemies to the truth, only served to show the fraud and falsehood of Elizabeth's and Cecil's constantly-repeated assertion, that they were guided solely by zeal for the glory of God and the interests of the true religion; and Bowes the Ambas sador assured them, that if the plot for this unnatural combination went forward, the ministers of the Kirk, from whom it could not be concealed, would \"greatly wonder and start thereat.\"1 Besides, how was he to 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Bowes to Burghley, 6th Sept., 1593. As this fact is new, and shows the insincerity of Elizabeth and Burghley, and the sincerity and honesty of the Kirk, proving, also, that BothwelPs party was the party of the Kirk, I give the pass age from Bowes' letter. \" The party employed to sound Chanus [Huntly] and his com-"], [144, "120 1593. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. reconcile the course now recommended with his in structions to prosecute the Papistical rebels ? How could he allow Huntly's uncle, a priest and a Jesuit, to steal quietly out of Scotland, and yet satisfy the Kirk and the Protestant leaders, that he (Bowes) was an enemy to the idolaters ? All this needed to be reconciled and explained ; and he begged for speedy directions. 1 We have seen how completely Bothwell had been supported and encouraged in his late audacious and treasonable enterprises by the English Queen. He was now to feel the fickleness of her favour : and with that deep hypocrisy which so often marked her political conduct, she addressed a letter to the King of Scots, partners, how they stand affected to proceed in and perform their offers made for America [England,] letteth me know that he hath spoken with Chanus, and with such as tendered this offer for him and the rest; and that they will go forwards agreeable to the motions offered. For the which this party thus travelling herein hath promised to go forwards in his course with diligence, as all things may be effected with best expedition and secrecy, likeas it will be made known, I trust, to your Lordship, very shortly. I under stand perfectly that Chanus [Huntly] will both impart to Petrea [King of Scots,] and also communicate to his partners, whatsoever shall be concredited to his trust and secrecy; and I believe, verily, that his partners, binding up with Argomartes [Bothwell,] shall acquaint him therewith. Further, this cannot be kept from the ears of the vi m JG86JC6 [Kirk] here, who will greatly start and wonder hereat. Therefore I beseech your Lordship that this may be well considered.\" Bowes very naturally goes on to observe, that this course of friendship with the Catholics is inconsistent with his instructions, which commanded him to prosecute the \"Papistical rebels.\" 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off., Bowes to Burghley, 6th Sept., 1593"], [145, "1593. JAMES VI. 121 and instructions to Bowes, in which she stigmatized the Scottish earl as guilty of an abominable fact, which moved her utmost abhorrence ; and expressed her unfeigned astonishment, that any subject who had acted thus insolently, had not only escaped without chastisement, but had received, as it appeared, a remis sion of such atrocious conduct. She alluded also, with scorn and indignation, to his refusal to prosecute those \"notable traitors of the North\" \u2014 Huntly, Errol, and Angus, \" who had conspired among themselves, and agreed to admit great forces of strangers to enter into his realm, to the ruin of his estate and the sub version of religion;\" and she warned him that such sudden changes as had been brought to her ears, such capriciousness and imbecility of judgment, would end not only in the loss of his liberty, but might endanger his life.1 It did not suit James' policy or circumstances to tear the veil from these pretences at this moment ; and, indeed, we are not certain that, however he may have suspected Eliza beth's double-dealing, he had detected it with anything of the certainty with which we can now unravel her complicated intrigues. At all events, he chose to fight her with her own crafty weapons, and pretended to Bowes that he was fully satisfied with her late assurances of friendship. When the appointed Conven tion assembled at Stirling, Bothwell was commanded to absent himself from Court until the meeting of Parliament, which was fixed for the 14th of Novem- 1 MS. St. P. Off, Orig. Draft of Her Majesty's Letter to Mr Bowes, 23d August, 1593."], [146, "122 1593. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ber ; at which time, the King intimated his intention of granting him a full pardon and restitution to his estates and honours, upon his submitting himself to the royal mercy.1 He was then to leave the realm, but enjoy his revenues in his banishment ; and his accomplices in his late treasons were to be pardoned. Such terms, with which the rebel earl was compell ed to be contented, exhibited a wonderful and rapid change in the power of the King ; and all perceived where James' strength lay, when Lord Hume, with the Master of Glammis, and Sir George Hume of Prim rose Know, entered Stirling during the Convention at the head of a large force. Everything was now changed, and the King spoke boldly out. He declared his resolution to cancel any promises extorted by force, when he was a captive ; but promised mercy to all who repented and sued for pardon. He received Hume and his associates with open arms ; sent for the Countess of Huntly to Court ; permitted the Catholic earls, Angus and Errol, to visit their friends without molestation ; and, it was strongly reported, had consented to have a secret interview with Huntly at Falkland.2 This northern earl had recently re ceived great promises from Spain ; and for the last eight months had maintained a large force, with which he had repeatedly ravaged the territories of his enemy 1 MS.

This constant exercise in war upon a larger scale than was commonly practised in High land raids, had made him an experienced soldier ; and James felt that, with such leaders as Huntly and Hume, he need not dread Bothwell, Athol, or their allies. All this rendered the King formidable ; and soon after his triumph became complete by the arrival of his old and experienced councillor, the Chancellor Thirlstane, who, having been reconciled to the Queen, the Master of Glammis, the Duke of Lennox, and his other enemies, rode to Court, accompanied by young Cessford and two hundred horse.1 Measures now followed rapidly, of such a char- acter as convinced the friends of England, the ministers of the Kirk, and the relics of Bothwell's party, that the King had not forgotten the late insults which had been offered him, and was pre- paring to take an ample revenge. Hume, a Ro- man Catholic, was made the Captain of the King's body-guard; and, in the King's presence, openly threw out his defiance against Bothwell and the whole race and name of the Stewarts ; who, he said, dared not take one sillie bee out of the moss in his bounds without his will.2 In these sallies he was not only unchecked by the King, but James, calling for the ministers, insisted that the process of excommunica tion, which was then preparing against this potent 1 MS.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. baron, should be abandoned, alleging that he was in the progress of conversion. It was remarked, too, that the three Catholic earls, although still excluded from Court, carried themselves with unwonted bravery and confidence. Angus, visiting Morton at the New house in Fife, assured him that he had better join them in time, as their increasing strength would soon compel a union ; and George Ker, the victim of the Spanish Blanks, who had not been heard of since his escape from Edinburgh castle, suddenly showed him self at Melvil, near Dalkeith, with a troop of eighty horse, and warned the tenants of Lord Ross to cease from their labour, if they would not have their houses burnt above their heads. It will be remembered that Ross's men had assisted in the capture of Ker; andtheir master, as was usual in those days, had been rewarded by a grant of Melvil, and other lands round Newbottle belonging to the Kers. These were trifling- events ; but noted at the time in the pulpit, when the watch men of the Kirk were keenly detecting how the cur rent of Court favour was setting in towards Popery.1 There is no good ground for suspecting, notwith standing the strong asseverations of the ministers to the contrary, that the King of Scots had ever any serious intentions of becoming a convert to the Ro man Catholic faith, or even of permitting its public profession by any one of his subjects ; but he was well aware of the unprincipled policy of the English 1 MS.

Queen, which, from first to last, had been directed to weaken Scotland, by creating perpetual divisions amongst its nobles ; and he had resolved, now that he was once more a free Prince, and at the head of a strong party, to extinguish the fires which she had kindled, and restore, if possible, aristocratic union and general peace to the country. That such was his present object is evident from a passage in a letter of Mr Carey the Governor of Berwick, son of Lord Hunsdon, to Lord Burghley; and the fervent hope expressed by this English baron, that the day may never arrive which shall see the Scottish nobles \" linked together in peace,\" is full of meaning. \" For the news in Scotland,\" says he, \" I know not well what to say ; but this I am sure, \u2014 the King doth too much oppose1 himself to the Papist faction for our good, I fear. Yet here [he means in^tlie Border districts] is nothing but peace and seeking to link all the nobility together, which I hope will never be. The Papists do only bear sway ; and the King hath none to put in trust with his own body but them. What will come of this your Lordship's wisdom can best discern ; and thus much I know certain, that it were good your Lordship looked well whom you trust : for the King and the nobility of Scotland have too good intelligence out of our Court of England.\"2 In prosecution of this design of a general union 1 \" Appose,\" (ad-pono, or appono,) place himself beside; assimi late himself to the faction. 2 MS.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. amongst his divided nobility, James opposed himself to the violent and persecuting measures of the Kirk. He knew the truth of what Bothwell had lately stated to Elizabeth, that the Scottish Catholics were so strong that, in the event of any attempt to unite them with the Prote,stants, they would soon rule all.1 Since then, Huntly and his friends had been daily gaining com- plete preeminence in the North ; and to render such a party furious or desperate by processes of treason and proscription, \u2014 to discharge against them, if they did not choose at once to renounce their religion and sign the Presbyterian Confession of Faith, the sharpest arrows of civil and ecclesiastical vengeance, would have been the extremity of intolerance and of folly. The King wisely declined this, and persevered in his course; although the Presbyterian pulpits immediately opened their fire, and the provincial Assembly of Fife was convened at St Andrews to consult on the immi nent dangers which surrounded the Kirk.2 Of this religious convention Mr James Melvil, ne phew of the well-known Andrew Melvil, was chosen Moderator ; and Mr John Davison, the sternest and most zealous amongst his brethren, did not hesitate to arraign the pastors of the Kirk of coldness, self-seek ing, and negligence. Let them repent, said he, and be take themselves to their ordinary armour \u2014 fasting and prayer. Let the whole Kirk concur in this needful 1 MS. St. P. Off.

Above all, let the rebel earls, Huntly, Errol, Angus, Auchendown, and their accomplices, whom it were idle to assail with any lighter censures, be solemnly excommunicated ; and let a grave message of pastors, barons, and burgesses, carry their resolu tion to the King, now so deeply alienated from the good cause : then they might look for better times. But now their sins called for humiliation : for they, the shepherds, seemed to have forgotten their flocks : they were idle and profane ; nor would he be far from the truth, if he declared that a great part of their pastors were at this moment the merriest and the care lessest men in Scotland. After much debate, it was resolved that the Roman Catholic rebels should be excommunicated ; and this upon the ground that many amongst them had been formerly students in the university of St Andrews, and must, therefore, have signed the Confession of Faith. The terms of this sentence, in which not the whole Presbyterian sect, as represented by the General Assembly of their Kirk, but an isolated provincial Synod took upon them to excommunicate certain members of the Catholic Church, were very awful. This little conclave de clared that, in name and authority of the Lord Jesus Christ, they cut off the said persons from their Com munion, and delivered them to Sata*n, to the destruc tion of their flesh, : it added, \u2014 that the Spirit might yet be safe, if it pleased God to reclaim them by repen tance ; but pronounced, if unrepentant, their just and everlasting condemnation.1 This sentence was com- 1 MS.

All persons, of whatever rank or degree, were interdicted from concealing or holding com munication with the delinquents thus delivered to the Devil, under the penalty of being visited by the same anathema ; and the Synod concluded by exhort ing the pastors to whom the charge of the flock had been intrusted, to prepare themselves by abstinence, prayer, and diligent study of the Word, for that general and solemn Fast which was judged most needful to be observed throughout the land. The causes for such universal humiliation and intercession were declared to be these : \u2014 x 1 . The impunity of Idolatry, and cruel murder com mitted by the Earl of Huntly and his complices. 2. The impunity of the monstrous, ungodly, and unnatural treasons of Huntly, Angus, Errol, the Laird Auchendown, Sir James Chisholm, and their accom plices. 3. The pride, boldness, malice, blasphemy, and going forward of these enemies in their most pernicious pur pose, arising out of the said impunity, and their suf ferance by the King ; so that now they not only have no doubt, as theyspeak plainly, to obtain liberty of con science, but also brag to make the Kirk fain to come to their cursed Idolatry before they come to the truth. 4. The land defiled in divers places with the devil ish and blasphemous Mass. 5. The wrath of God broken forth in fiery flame upon the north and south parts of the land with 1 MS.

The King's slowness in repressing Papistry and planting of true religion. 7.

They publicly rebuked the Earl of Morton for keeping company with Errol and Angus, men branded by the Kirk as idolaters ; and when he defended himself by quoting the example of Henry the Fourth, the French King recently turned Catholic, 1 Mr James Blyth and Mr John Aikman, ministers, had been slain by the Mures. 2 MS.

No opportunity, they said, had hitherto been given them of defending themselves before a jury. They had been excommunicated by the Kirk, banished from Court, and compelled to lead the life of fugitives and traitors, without any evidence except a confession extorted by torture, and the ex hibition of some signatures asserted to be theirs, but which they would prove to be forgeries.

If found guilty, they were ready to suffer the penalty of their crimes ; if acquit ted, as they trusted to be, then they would either satisfy the Kirk on the subject of their religion and conform to the national faith, or would go into vo luntary banishment.1 Not satisfied with these remon strances, they suddenly presented themselves to the King as he rode from Holyrood to Lauder, and, falling on their knees, implored him to submit their alleged offences to the judgment of an assize. But James dismissed them with real or affected wrath; threatening that they should be worse handled for such boldness.2 Had the Catholic earls been sincere in the anxiety they expressed to have an impartial trial, it would have been the height of injustice to have refused their request ; but it was well known that they had secretly summoned all their friends to assemble in arms on \"their day of law;\" and such was their present strength, that neither judges, jury, nor witnesses, could have attended with safety. 3 It is not surpris ing that the Kirk should have loudly remonstrated against such hurried and premature proceedings ; and at an ecclesiastical convention of ministers, barons, and burghs, held at Edinburgh on the 17th October, for the purpose of considering the imminency of the threatened danger, they selected six commissioners to repair to the palace and present their advice, be- 1 MS.

They resolved, that if their enemies attended in arms, they should meet them in the same fashion; desiring the King's permission that \" the professors of religion may be his Majesty's guard, and be admitted in the most sensible and war like manner to be about the royal person, to defend it from violence, and accuse their enemies to the uttermost : and this,\" they added, \" we are minded to do, although it should be with the loss of all our lives in one day : for certainly we are determined that the country shall not bruik us and them baith, so long as they are God's professed enemies.\"1 In futherance 1 MS.

The state of matters now became alarming ; and Bowes the Eng lish Ambassador, who watched it from hour to hour, wrote thusto Burghley on thelSth October: \u2014 \"Yester day, at the meeting of the Commissioners of the Kirk, the barons, and burghs, convened here together. * * Great preparations are made for the advancement of the course thus resolved, and to stop the trial to be given at this time to these earls, whose friends (as it is told me) have mustered, and are in readiness to come to Perth at the day limited : they have already provided that the Water Gate or Water Street shall be reserved for the earls and their com panies.

The convoca tion and access of people to that place is looked upon to be so great that thereon bloody troubles shall arise.\"1 A collision appeared now inevitable ; and many causes promised to make it, when it did occur, one of a fearful description. The opposite factions, whose partisans were flocking from all parts towards Perth, the anticipated scene of the trial, were animated by the most bitter and revengeful feelings ; their blood was boiling under the influence of family feuds, religious persecution, and fanatical hatred. The advo cates for peace were browbeaten, and their voices drowned in the din of arms and proclamations of mutual defiance ; and all this was exasperated and increased by the warlike denunciations of the Kirk, which, by its thousand trumpet-tongues, through the length and breadth of the land, summoned all who loved the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ to gird on their weapons, and, if necessary, die for their faith. Had things been allowed to continue in this state, and the muster taken place at Perth, a few days more might have kindled the flames of civil war in the country, and deluged it with blood ; but at this crisis James wisely interdicted the trial from being held at Perth, and resolved that a solemn inquiry into the conduct of Huntly, Angus, and Errol, should take place before commissioners to be selected from the nobility, the burghs, and the Kirk.

Off., Bowes to Burghley, 20th Oct., 1593."], [159, "1593. 135 JAMES VI. except such as were especially called for should pre sume to attend the convention ; that the three earls, dismissing their forces, should await the King's determination at Perth ; and that, in the mean season, none should molest them during the trial or inquiry which was about to take place. At all this the Kirk stood aghast. They had insisted on the imprison ment of the three earls. They had argued that, till they signed the Confession of Faith and recon ciled themselves to the Kirk, they could not be recognised or permitted to take their trial ; that they ought to have no counsel to defend them ; and that the Kirk, as their accuser, should nominate the jury. Its ministers now complained, threatened, and remon strated;1 but when the day appointed for the conven tion arrived, they found the King not only resolved to abide by his own judgment, but so strongly sup ported by the nobility whom he had summoned, that it would be vain to attempt resistance. James, who had taken time to consider all coolly, on weighing the whole circumstances, found it necessary to steer a middle course. The trial was postponed ; as it was believed that no jury could be found at that mo ment \" so void of favour and partiality\" as to condemn the earls; and, on the other hand, if acquitted, no terms or conditions could be imposed on them which their power would not enable them to despise and infringe.2 As to the accused themselves : on the one hand, they 1 MS.

All this was laid before a committee who represented the three Estates \u2014 nobles, barons, and burghs. The Duke of Lennox and the Earl of Mar appearing for the earls; the Lord Chancellor Thirlstane and Lord Living.ston for the lords, with whom sat all the councillors of estate ; the barons being represented by four of their number, the burghs by five burgesses, and the Kirk by six of the leading ministers ; who, however, appeared only as petitioners, and did not sit or vote as commissioners. After mature deliberation with this committee, the King, adopting, as far as he was permitted, a wise mean between the extremity of persecution recom mended by the Kirk, and that toleration which was rather implored and hoped for than claimed as a right by the Catholics, pronounced his sentence. He declared that he was firmly resolved that God's true religion, publicly preached, and by law established, during the first year of his reign, should alone be pro fessed by the whole body of his subjects ; and that all who had not embraced it, or who had made de fection from it, should, before the 1st of February"], [161, "1593. 137 JAMES VI. next, obey the laws by professing it, and thus satisfy the Kirk; or, if they found this against their con- science, should depart the realm to such parts beyond seas as he should direct, there to remain till they embraced the true religion, and were reconciled to the Kirk; but he added, that during this banishment they should enjoy their lands and living. As to those per- sons who had been accused of a treasonable conspiracy with Spain for the overthrow of the true religion \u2014 William Earl of Angus, George Earl of Huntly, Francis Earl of Errol, Sir Patrick Gordon of Auch- endown, and Sir James Chisholm of Cornileys \u2014 he pronounced them \" free, and unaccusable in all time coming of any such crimes ; \" and annulled all legal proceedings which had been instituted against them, unless they showed themselves unworthy of pardon by directly renewing their intrigues, or threatening, either by word or deed, any repetition of their treason. If they chose to renounce their Idolatry, to embrace the Presbyterian opinions, satisfy the Kirk, and remain to enjoy their estates and honours within their own land, it was intimated to them and to all other Catho- lics, that this must be done on or before the 1st day of February next ; and, on the contrary, if they pre- ferred to retain their faith and enter into exile, then they were to give assurance that, during its continu- ance, they should refrain from all practices with Jesuits or seminary priests against their native country. It was lastly declared, that they should express to the King and the Kirk their acceptance"], [162, "138 1593. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. of one or other of these conditions before the 1st of January next.1 To our modern and more Christian feelings this sentence must appear as unwise as unmerciful: for it disavowed the possibility of toleration, held out a premium to religious hypocrisy, and punished sincerity and honesty of opinion with perpetual banishment. James had hoped that it might pacify the country ; but it experienced the common fate of middle courses, and gave satisfaction to no party. The Catholics, who had never intermitted their intrigues with Spain, had lately received assistance and encouragement from that country; they commanded almost the whole of the North; and were in no temper to resign their religion, or retain it at the expense of perpetual exile. They temporised, therefore; affected a submis sion which they did not feel ; and continued to strengthen themselves both at home and abroad for a new struggle. But if the Catholics were discon tented, the Kirk received the Act of Abolition with mingled wrath and lamentation. It actually seemed to them an insufficient security, and a trifling punishment, that no man was to be permitted to remain within the realm, and enjoy his estate and the protection of the law, unless he signed the Presbyterian Confession of Faith. The profanation was, that any man should be at liberty to retain his belief in the Roman Catholic faith, and his Scottish estates, if he consented to banish 1 MS. St. P. Off.

The feelings of the leaders of the Kirk upon this subject are thus described by Bowes, an eyewitness, in his letter to Burghley. \" This edict, and act of oblivion, is thought to be very injurious to the Church, and far against the laws of God and this realm; whereupon the ministers have not only openly protested to the King and Con vention that they will not agree to the same, but also, in their sermons, inveigh greatly against it; al leging that, albeit it hath a pretence to establish one true religion in the realm, yet liberty is given to all men to profess what they list, so they depart out of the realm; and thereby they shall enjoy greater privi leges and advantages than any other good subject can do. That this is very dangerous to the religion, and to all the professors thereof, that the crimes of these offenders shall be thus slightly passed over; and this notwithstanding their treasons and faults are so manifest and odious, as the King once con fessed that he had not power to pardon them, and promised, as he was a Christian prince, to punish them with all rigour. And the parties thus offending have now been detected four times, and escaped pun ishment for like treasons and conspiracies.\"1 At this Convention the King, who now found him self strong enough to disclose his true feelings, ex hibited the sustained intensity of his wrath against Bothwell. It was in vain that the Queen, and those nobles who had attached themselves to her service, interceded for the delinquent. He was commanded \u00bb MS. Letter, St. P. Off., Bowes to Burghley, 2d Dec. 1593."], [164, "140 1593. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. to leave the realm within fifteen days ; and James refused to listen to any offers, or to hold out the slightest hopes of forgiveness till this order had been obeyed. The friends of the rebel earl were treated with equal severity. Lords Doune and Spiny, with Mr John Russell, an eminent adArocate who had pleaded his cause, were imprisoned ; and it was evi dent that all hope of reconciliation must be aban doned.1 The act of oblivion proved as distasteful to Eliza beth as it was to either the Catholics or the Kirk. This great Princess had recently received intelligence of the continued intrigues carried on by Jesuits and seminary priests in Scotland. One of these busy emissaries, Thomas Mackquharry, a Scottish Jesuit, who had been employed by Lady Hume, and had carried on his secret practices in different parts of England, had been recently seized by Sir John Carey at Berwick. It was reported that another Scottish Jesuit, Mr James Gordon, with William Gordon of Strathdon, a brother of the Earl of Huntly, and four or five other Catholics, had passed over from Scotland to Dunkirk ;2 and Mr James Craig, a gentleman resident at Bourdeaux, wrote to his brother Mr Thomas Craig, the celebrated feudal lawyer, then an advocate at the Scottish bar,3 that an army and fleet 1 MS.

Ireland continued to be the theatre of perpetual intrigue and commotion ; and the English Queen had taken the adoption of the Catholic faith by Henry the Fourth greatly to heart. She was, therefore, in a highly excited state when she received from Bowes, her Ambassador, the news from Scotland ; and lost no time in despatching Lord Zouch with a violent open remonstrance, and a letter of secret rebuke, written wholly in her own hand.1 This last was in these nervous and scornful terms : \"My dear Brother. \u2014 To see so much, I rue my sight that views the evident spectacle of a seduced King, abusing council, and wry-guided kingdom. My love to your good and hate of your ruin, breeds my heed ful regard of your surest safety. If I neglected you, I could wink at your worst, and yet withstand my enemies' drifts. But be you persuaded by sisters. I will advise you, void of all guile, and will not stick to tell you, that if you tread the path you chuse,2 I will pray for you, but leave you to your harms. \" I doubt whether shame or sorrow have had the upper hand when I read your last lines to me. Who, of judgment, that deemed me not simple, could sup pose that any answers you have writ me should satisfy, nay, enter into the opinion of any one not void of four senses, leaving out the first. \" Those of whom you have had so evident proof by their actual rebellion in the field you preserve, 1 Camden, Elizabeth in Kennet, vol. ii. 2 In the copy in the St. P.

And now, at last, when, plainest of all, was taken the carrier himself, confessing all be fore many commissioners and divers councillors ; be cause you slacked the time till he was escaped, and now must seem deny it, (though all men knew it ;) therefore, forsooth, no jury can be found for them. May this blind me that knows what a King's office were to do? Abuse not yourself so far. Indeed, when a weak bowing and a slack seat in government shall appear, then bold spirits will stir the stern, and guide the ship to greatest wreck, and will take heart to supply the failure. \" Assure yourself no greater peril can ever befal you, nor any King else, than to take for payment evil accounts ; for they deride such, and make their prey of their neglect. There is no Prince alive, but if he show fear or yielding but he shall have tutors enough, though he be out of minority. And when I remember what sore punishment those so lewd traitors should have, then I read again, lest at first I mistook your mind ; but when the reviewing granted my lecture true, Lord ! what wonder grew in me that you should correct them with benefits who deserve much severer correction. Could you please them more than save their lives and make them shun the place they hate, where they are sure that their just deserved haters dwell, and yet as much enjoy their honours and livelihoods, as if for sporting travel they were licensed to visit other countries ? Call you this a banishment \u2014 to be rid of whom they fear and go"], [167, "1593. 143 JAMES VI. to such they love ? Now, when my eyes read more, then smiled I to see how childish, foolish, and witless an excuse the best of either three made you, turning their treasons' bills to artificers' reckonings with items for many expenses, and lacked but one billet which they best deserved, an item for so much for the cord whose office they best merited. Is it possible that you can swallow the taste of so bitter a drug, more meet to purge you of them, than worthy for your Kingly acceptance ? I never heard a more deriding scorn ; aud vow that, if but this alone, were I you, they should learn a short lesson. \"The best that I commend in your letter is, that I see your judgment too good to affirm a truth of their speech, but that alone they so say. Howbeit, I muse how you can want a law to such, as whose denial, if it were ever, could serve to save their lives, whose trea sons are so plain ; as the messenger who would for his own sake not devise it, if for truth's cause he had it not in his charge : for who should ever be tried false, if his own denial might save his life ? In Princes' causes many circumstances yield a sufficient plea for such a King as will have it known : and ministers they shall lack none, that will not themselves gainsay it. Leave off such cloaks, therefore, I pray you; they will be found too thin to save you from wetting. For your own sake play the King, and let your sub jects see you respect yourself, and neither to hide or to suffer danger and dishonour.

But blame my love if it exceed any limits.

He professed his anxious desire to live on terms of amity with his good sister : observed, that as for the Act of Abolition to the Ca tholic earls which her Majesty disliked so much, it was now itself abolished by their not accepting it, and he was entirely free from any agreement. He knew, he said, in answer to Zouch's remonstrances on his supposed Spanish predilections, what it was to lose an old friend and to trust a new.

The Lord Chancellor Maitland, whom he was taught to consider the wisest and most up right of the King's councillors, plotted, as he sus pected, against him ; and had received, it was said, great sums of money from the Catholic faction. He was surrounded by falsehood and suspicion; distracted by contrary reports; and so strictly watched, that none came near him but those whom the King permitted. All this, however, did not prevent Zouch from fulfilling the more secret part of his instructions; nor, although he affected to be deeply shocked with the political profligacy and dissimulation of the Scot- 1 MS.

Whilst assuring James of Elizabeth's un shaken friendship and zeal for his welfare, he opened a communication with his bitter foe, the fierce and reckless Bothwell ; and arranged with this earl, John Colvil brother of the Laird of Wemyss, Henry Lock an agent of Sir Robert Cecil, and some of the most violent ministers of the Kirk, a new plot for the sur prise of the King. It was resolved that Athol and Argyll, with the whole strength of the North, should advance to Edinburgh ; form a junction with the forces of Bothwell, Montrose, Ochiltree, and the Laird of Johnston ; and attacking the Chancellor Maitland, Lord Hume, and the friends of the King, at once destroy Huntly and the Roman Catholics, save James from evil counsellors, and take an ample revenge for the murder of the Earl of Murray.1 These designs were the more unjustifiable at this moment, as the monarch had adopted strong measures against the Roman Catholic earls. He had declared them excluded from all benefits of the Act of Abolition; had summoned them, on the penalty of being outlawed, to deliver themselves up, and take their trials for treason ; called a Parliament, which was to be held in April ; appointed a new Council of more neutral and well affected nobles and barons ; and had professed to Elizabeth, in a written answer to Zouch's instructions, his continued desire of friendship and good faith. 1 MS.

In an interview, also, which Bowes the resident Am bassador had with James' great adviser the Chan cellor Maitland, the Scottish lord assured him that his royal mistress need not distress herself with suspicions of his master. He was steadfast, he affirm ed, in his religion, whatever Papists or the Kirk might affirm : nothing would induce him to embrace the Spanish courses ; and for an invasion of England, he knew it would be madness.1 Yet Zouch continued his plots; and Elizabeth undoubtedly gave them her secret encouragement ; although, with her usual caution and parsimony, she abstained from any large advances either in money or troops. In the midst of these intrigues and dangers a joy ful event occurred. The Queen brought forth a son, her first child, in the castle of Stirling, on the 19th February ; and the monarch immediately committed the charge and government of the infant heir to the throne, to the Earl of Mar, captain and keeper of the castle of Stirling ; \" whose uncle and goodsire, (it is stated in the Act of Appointment.) by three descents together, have had the custody and governance of the sovereign Princes of this l'ealm.\"2 By the nation this event was hailed with universal joy: an old chronicle declaring that \"the people, in all parts, 1 MS.

It was a game which had already been played in the days of James the Third. The English Ambassador, however, protested against such an outrage, and his associates did not dare to disobe}r. All was now ripe for Bothwell's attempt ; but the King proved too crafty and strong for his adver saries. He had received secret information of the plot ; seized a gentleman of Zouch's suite, who had communicated with the traitors ; commanded Lord Hume, Ccssford, and Buccleugh, to concentrate their strength at Kelso, where it was expected the enemy would cross the Border ; imprisoned some of the boldest and busiest ministers of the Kirk ; and addressing the people in the High Church of Edinburgh after the sermon, informed them, in stirring terms, of the insolence of Bothwell, that audacious rebel, who was at that moment on his way to attack his lawful Prince ; declared his reso lution to lead his whole force in person against him ; and, raising his hand to heaven, took a solemn vow to God, that if they, for their part, would instantly arm and advance with him into the field, he, for his, Avould never rest till, in return for such service, he had utterly suppressed and banished the Catholic lords 1 Moyse's Memoirs, p. 113."], [173, "1594. 149 JAMES VI. from his dominions.1 Scarcely had James ended this appeal, when word was brought that Bothwell, who had out-man\u0153uvred Hume and Buccleugh, was at hand, at Leith, with six hundred horse, awaiting the junction of Athol and Argyll, whom he expected to cross the Forth with their northern strength, and showing intentions of intrenching himself within the old fortifications on the Links. Without a moment's delay, the King assembled his troops, and marched against him. The advance consisted of a thousand pikemen and five hundred horse ; the rear, of the infantry of the city of Edinburgh, in number about a thousand musketeers ; and besides these, there were three guns covered by a body of two hundred horse. Despairing of being able to withstand such a force within the intrenchments, Bothwell retired deliber ately, and in good order, in a south-easterly direction, round the roots of the hill of Arthur Seat, towards Niddry, where he halted on a neighbouring field, which offered him an excellent position. James, observing this movement, now dreaded an attack of his capital on the south side, where it was undefended ; and ordering Hume, at the head of the cavalry, to advance to Niddry, countermarched through Edin burgh, and took up his ground with the remainder of the troops on the Borough Muir. Meanwhile Hume and Glammis had reached a hill beside Niddry, and were hesitating to make the onset, when Both well, Lord Ochiltrce, and the gentlemen with them, \" after prayers on their knees,\" assailed them with 1 Hiatorie os James the Scxt, p. 304."], [174, "1594. 150 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. loud shouts of \"God and the Kirk,\" drove them from their ground, slew twelve of their troopers, and chased them to within a short distance of the spot where the King stood. They then sounded their trumpets, andretired in good order by Craigmillar without losing a man. In this onset, Bothwell took Hume's cornet and trumpet, to whom he gave his liberty ; and pre senting him with two rose nobles, sent, by him, a challenge to his master.1 This defeat took place on an eminence beside Niddry, called Edmeston Edge.2 Bothwell now retreated to Kelso ; and aware of the hopelessness of his enterprise, soon after dispersed his company, and became once more a refugee in Eng land. The King, delivered for the present from all apprehensions on this quarter, now determined to fulfil his promise, and deprive the Queen of England and the ministers of the Kirk of all pretence of opposition, by adopting the most vigorous proceed ings against the Catholic earls, Huntly, Angus, and Errol. Proclamation was made, that these noble- 1 We learn from Henry Lock's letter to Sir Robert, describing the \" raid,\" and written from Berwick only two days after the action, that before they charged their adversaries, Bothwell and his companions exclaimed, that \" that day her Majesty should see proof of their intentions and faith.\" MS.

The whole force of his realm was summoned to meet him in arms, to be led against the rebels if they resisted ; and Colvil of Easter Wemyss, one of the best military leaders then in Scotland, with Mr Edward Bruce, an influ ential minister of the Kirk, were despatched on an embassy to Elizabeth. The general object of their mission was to assure her of their master's resolute determination to reduce the Catholic earls, and for ever put an end to the Spanish intrigues ; but before proceeding to any other point, they were enjoined to remonstrate, in the strongest terms, against the sup port lately given in England to the King's avowed rebel, the Earl of Bothwell. We have seen the bitter and sarcastic letter which Elizabeth, three months before, had sent to the King by the Lord Zouch. It was now his time to reply to it, and have his revenge ; which he did by the following- private epistle, intrusted to his Ambassadors, written wholly in his own hand, and certainly not inferior either in irony or vigour, to the production of his good sister. \" So many unexpected wonders, Madam and dearest sister, have of late so overshadowed my eyes and mind, and dazzled so all my senses, as in truth I neither know what I should say, nor whereat first to begin ; but thinking it best to take a pattern of yourself, since I deal with you, I must, repeating the first words of your last letter, (only the sex changed,) say I rue my sight that views the evident spectacle of a seduced Queen.

Appardon me, Ma dam ; for lono- approved friendship requires a round plainness. For when first I consider what strange effects have of late appeared in j-our country ; how my avowed traitor hath not only been openly reset in your realm, but plainly made his residence in your proper houses, ever plainliest lii/fhiug1 himself where greatest confluence of people was ; and, which is most of all, how he hath received English money in a reasonable quantity; waged both English and Scottish men therewith ; proclaimed his pay at divers parish churches in England ; convened his forces within England, in the sight of all that Border ; and there from contemptuously marched, and camped within a mile of my principal city and present abode, all his trumpeters, and divers waged men, being English ; and being by myself in person repulsed from that place, returned back in England with displayed ban ners ; and since that time, with sound of trumpet, making his troops to muster within English ground : when first, I say, I consider these strange effects, and then again I call to mind, upon the one part, what number of solemn promises, not only by your Ambassadors but by many letters of your own hand, ye have both made and reiterated unto me, that he should have no harbour within your country, yea, rather stirring me farther up against him, than seem ing to pity him yourself ; and upon the other part, 1 Kything himself \u2014 showing himself."], [177, "1594.

And again ; that so wise and provident a Prince, having so long and happily governed, should be so fyled and contemned by a great number of her own subjects, it is hardly to be believed : if I knew it not to be a maxim in the state of Princes, that we see and hear all with the eyes and ears of others, and if these be deceivers, we cannot shun deceits. \" Now, Madam, I have refuge to you at this time, as my only pilot to guide me safely betwixt this Charybdis and Scylla.

That I wrote not the answer of your last letters with your late Ambassa dor, (Lord Zouch,) and that I returned not a letter with him, blame only, I pray you, his own behaviour ; who, although it pleased you to term him wise, re ligious, and honest, had been fitter, in my opinion, to carry the message of a herald, than any friendly commission betwixt two neighbour Princes: for as"], [178, "1594. 154 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. no reason could satisfy him, so scarcely could he have patience even to hear it offered.

Suffer me not, I pray you, to be abused with your abusers ; nor grant no oversight to oversee your own honour. Remember what you promised by your letter of thanks for the delivery of O'Rorick.

She assured him, that she would extend her liberality the moment the King set out on his expedition against the Catho lic earls, and she saw that he was in earnest.1 Colvil of Easter Wemyss, his brother Ambassador, now proceeded to the Court of France ; whilst, about the same time, Sir William Keith was despatched to the United Provinces ; and Mr Peter Young, the King's almoner, to the Court of Denmark. The ob ject of all these missions was the same : to carry to the King's faithful and ancient allies the happy news of the birth of a Prince ; to invite them to send their representatives to the baptism, which had been fixed for the 15th of July ; and to hint delicately to the United States, but in perfectly intelligible terms, the necessity of presenting, at that solemn ceremony, something more substantial than congratulations.2 Important events now crowded rapidly on each other.

Huntly, Angus, and Errol, the three mighty leaders, who were now in open rebellion, were forfeited, stript of their estates, declared traitors,1 and a commission given to their avowed enemy, the young Earl of Argyll, to assem ble the forces of the North, and pursue them with fire and sword. All persons detected in saying Mass, were ordered to be punished capitally, and their goods confiscated. It was resolved, for the preservation of the religion, and to confirm the amity between the two realms, that there should be a thorough reforma tion in the King's Council ; and that Elizabeth's ad vice should be followed in such matters. The Catholic Countess of Huntly, whose intercourse with the King and Queen had been a constant thorn in the side of the Kirk, was dismissed from Court ; Lord Hume recanted, and signed the Confession of Faith, either convinced in conscience, or terrified by impending severities ; and the King declared, that immediately after the baptism, he would march in person, at the head of the whole strength of his do minions, against the Catholic insurgents.2 On the evening of the 27th August, the Earl of Sussex \u2014 a young nobleman of the highest rank, and connected, by blood, with his royal mistress \u2014 arrived at the Scottish Court.

He was attended by a noble re tinue, and brought some rich presents from the Queen of England, with this brief letter of congratulation and counsel : \u2014 \" I make a note of my happy destiny, my good brother, in beholding my luck so fortunate as to be the baptizer of both father and son, so dear unto me ; and [this] makes me frame my humble orisons to Him that all may,1 that he will please bless with all happiness the prosperous continuance of both, in such a sort as my benedictions bestowed on either may be perfected through His omnipotent graces ; and do promise a grant to my devotions, springing from a fountain of such good will.

The expense incurred in these triumphs and shows, in which there was an unusual allowance of chariots, mimic ships, Christian knights, rural deities, Moors, windmills, and amazons, must have been excessive, judging from the account of a contemporary pamph let, written in the highest style of quaint and courtly composition.2 The baptism itself took place on the \u2022 MS.

It is wholly written in James' hand : \u2014 \" I could not permit, Madam and dearest sister, now after the ending of this solemn time, the noble man bearer hereof to depart without returning with him unto you my most hearty thanks for the honour ing me with so noble a substitute gossip in your place.

I think ye have not given commission to any of your Council to treat with Bothwell's ambas- sador, nor yet allow that his agent, and one guilty of all his treasons, should use his public devotion in the French Kirk, in presence of my Ambassador ; who, indeed, was better furnished with patience at the sight thereof than he is likely to get thanks for at my hands : yet now, Madam, none can brook me and Bothwell both.

Lord Burghley, now managed the Scottish affairs, had secret intelligence with Bothwell. The Catholic earls were now alluring this audacious man, by Span ish gold, to make common cause with them against the Scottish King. Bothwell, on the other hand, with consummate baseness, had proposed to Cecil to accept the money and betray their secrets to the Queen of England, if .she would still stand his friend in his present distress and misery. But he was no longer the proud and powerful partisan whom Eliza beth had once so highly favoured ; and the moment she discovered that James had detected his intrigues, she threw him from her with as much indifference as she would a broken sword; commanded him to leave her dominions; and interdicted her subjects, under the severest penalties, from giving him harbour or assis tance. He was no longer permitted, in the strong language which the King himself used in his remon strance to Sussex, to \" tak muster, display cornet or ensign, blaw trumpet, strike drum,\" or even in any way live and breathe within England.1 Having secured this expulsion of his mortal enemy, James assembled a Convention at Stirling,2 and made the most active preparations for the attack of the Catholic earls.

JAMES VI. 163 mined struggle was anticipated ; as there were many deep feelings and bitter passions which festered in the minds of the leaders and their hosts. With the Kirk, it was a war of religious persecution, or rather extermination. Their avowed object was to depose Antichrist, and to compel all Catholics to recant or at once give up their lands, their honours, and their country, for their privilege to adhere to that Church which they believed to be of divine origin and the only depository of the truth. But to these feelings were added, as may be easily imagined, many motives and j>assions of baser alloy : ambition ; love of plun der ; deep feudal hatred ; long-delayed and fondly cherished hopes of revenge ; and all that catalogue of dark and merciless passions which spring from the right of private war and the prevalence of family feuds. These all raged in the bosoms of the opposed leaders and combatants ; and the exacerbation they produced, was shown alike by the energy of their preparations and the cruelty with which they fought. Huntly, Angus, Errol, and Auchendown, since their refusal of the Act of Abolition, had been gathering their strength, and were now busily engaged in levying recruits, partly at their own charges, partly with Spanish gold, of which they had received re peated supplies. It had been now for many years the practice of Elizabeth, with the permission of James, to employ large bodies of Scottish auxiliaries in her wars in the Low Countries. Scottish troops^ also, often served in Ireland ; and the Highland chiefs had long driven a lucrative and warlike com-"], [188, "164 1594. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. merce with that country, selling their services to the highest bidder, and carrying over large bodies of pikenien, bowmen, and even of hagbutteers, to the as- sistance of Elizabeth or her enemies, as it best suited their interest. From these causes, there were now in Scotland many experienced officers and numerous bands of mercenaries, ready, like the Italian Cou- dottieri, or the Swiss bands, to Offer their service wherever they heard the tuck of drum or the clink of gold ; and as Huntly had high reputation as a mili- tary leader, lived in almost regal splendour in his palace at Strathbogie, and was young, generous, and brave, the Catholic camp was in no want of recruits, and soon assumed a formidable appearance. He was now also joined by Bothwell, who, driven to des- peration by the mortal hatred of the Scottish King ; his recent proscription by the Queen of England; his desertion by the Kirk, who had detected his dealings with the Catholics ; and the hunting down, torturing, and execution of his poor vassals, had been unable to resist the bribes held out to him. The papers still exist which enable us to trace the last struggles and plots of this desperate man ; but we can only give them a passing glance. It was arranged between him and his new associates, that when Huntly was engaged in the North, Bothwell should make a diversion in the South ; thus distract ing the King and dividing his forces. But this was not all. He entered into an agreement with his new friends, in which it was proposed, by a sudden coup de main, to attack the Court, imprison the King,"], [189, "1594. 165 JAMES VI. seize the infant Prince, murder Sir George Hume the King's favourite; and, as he himself expressed it in his letter to the ministers of the Kirk, \" put in practice the loveable custom of their progenitors at Landers by completely revolutionizing the Government.1 It was asserted, and on good grounds, that the usual \" Band,\" or feudal agreement in such conspiracies* was drawn up and signed by the enterprisers ; but the time for its execution was not fixed; and the seizure of some of the inferior agents, with the course of events in the North, happily rendered the whole plot abortive. These events were of a stirring and romantic kind ; for, on the 21st September, Argyll having received the royal commission to pursue Huntly and his asso ciates, set out on his expedition at the head of a force of six thousand men. Of this army, three thou sand only were chosen men, bearing harquebuses, bows, and pikes ; the rest being more slenderly equipt, both as to body-armour and weapons. Of cavalry, he had few or none ; but he expected to be joined by Lord Forbes, with the Laird of Towey, the Dun bars, and other barons, who, it was hoped, would form a strong reinforcement, and be mostly mounted.2 It had been the King's intention to postpone the attack upon the insurgent barons till he had assembled the whole force of his realm, and was ready to take the command in person. But the ministers of the Kirk 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Bothwell to the Presbytery of Edin burgh, 7th September, 1594. ' 2 MS. Letter, St. P. 'Off, Bowes to 'Sir R. Cecil, 27th Sept., 1594."], [190, "1594. 166 HTSTORY OF SCOTLAND. urged the danger of delay : some of them even buckled on their broadswords and rode to the camp ; whilst Argyll himself, young, (he was only nineteen,) ardent, and acting under the stimulus of personal revenge, determined on instant action. He had al ready, he said, been twice on the eve of marching, and twice been countermanded; but now the slaughter of his brother-in-law, the Earl of Murray, should be avenged on Huntly; to whom he sent a message that, within three days, he meant to sleep at Strathbogie. To this taunting challenge Huntly replied, that Argyll should be welcome : he would himself be his porter, and open all the gates of his palace to his young friend ; but he must not take it amiss if he rubbed his cloak against Argyll's plaid ere they parted.1 On advancing to Aberdeen, Argyll ordered Red Lion, the herald, to proclaim the royal commis sion by sound of trumpet in the market-place, and appointed Sir Lauchlan Maclean of Duart to the chief command under himself. He was join ed by the Macintoshes, the Grants, the Clan Gregor, the Macgillivrays, with all their friends and depen dants, and by the whole surname of the Campbells; with many others, whom either greediness of prey or malice against the Cordons had thrust into that expedition. These, including the rabble of camp followers, or, as Bowes terms them, \" rascals and poke-bearers,\" formed a body of ten thousand strong. But of this number only six thousand were fighting 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Bowes to Sir R. Cecil, 28th Sept., 1594. Historie of James the Sext, p. 339."], [191, "167 1594. JAMES VI. men ; and out of these there were not above fifteen hundred disciplined hagbutteers, chiefly serving under Maclean ; the rest being promiscuously armed with dirks, swords, dags, Lochaber axes, two-handed swords, and bows and arrows. He had neither cavalry nor artillery ; and a large part of his force was totally regardless of discipline, disdaining- com mand, composed of chieftains and people distracted by old feuds and suspicions, marching, as described by an eye-witness, \" at raggle and in plumps, with out order.\" With this army Argyll proceeded into Badenoch, and besieged the castle of Ruthven, belonging to Huntly; but the place was bravely defended by the Macphersons. He had no means of battering the walls; and abandoning the siege, he led his troops through the hills to Strathbogie. It was his purpose to ravage this country, which belonged to Huntly, with fire and sword; and thence come down into the Lowlands to form a junction with Lord Forbes, who, with his own kin and the Frasers, Dunbars, Ogilvies, Leslies, and others, were at that moment on their way to meet him. With this object, he arrived on the 2d of October at Drimmin in Strath down, where he encamped ; 1 and soon after received news that Huntly and Errol were in the neighbour hood, and purposed to attack him, in spite of their great inferiority in force. The disparity was indeed great ; for the Catholic earls could not muster above fifteen hundred, or, at most, two thousand men. But of these the greater part were resolute and gallant I Warrender MSS., B., p. 9."], [192, "168 1594. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. gentlemen, all well mounted and fully armed; and amongst them some officers of veteran experience, who had served in the Low Countries. They had, besides, six pieces of ordnance, which were placed under the charge of Captain Andrew Gray, who afterwards commanded the English and Scottish auxiliaries in Bohemia.1 On the morning of the 3d of October, Huntly,, who had marched from Strathbogie to Auchen down, the castle of Sir Patrick Gordon, having received word by his scouts that Argyll was at no great distance, sent Captain Thomas Ker, a veteran officer, at the head of a small body of cavalry, to view the enemy and report their strength. In exe cuting this, he fell in with Argyll's \" spials,\" and slew them all except one, who brought him to the vicinity of their encampment, which was near Glen livat, in the mountainous district of Strathavon. On his return, Captain Ker concealed the number of their opponents, affirming that a few resolute men might easily have the advantage ; and Huntly, follow ing his advice, instantly marched forward. Errol led the advance, supported by Sir Patrick Gordon of Auchendown, the Lairds of Gight, Bonniton Wood, and Captain Ker and three hundred gentlemen. Huntlv commanded the rearward, having on his right the Laird of Clunie-Gordon, on his left Gordon of Abergeldie, and the six pieces of artillery so placed as to be completely masked, or covered by the cavalry, so that they were dragged forward unper- 1 Warrender MSS., Vol. B., p. 9, d.; in which there is a minute contemporary account of the battle of Glenlivnt."], [193, "1594. 169 JAMES VI. ceived within range of the enemy's position. They then opened their fire ; and on the first discharge, which was directed at the yellow standard of Argyll, struck down and slew Macneill, the Laird of Barra's third son, one of their bravest officers, and Campbell of Lochnell, who held the standard. This successful commencement occasioned extraordinary confusion amongst the Highlanders, to many of whom the terrible effects of artillery were even at this late day unknown; and a large body of them, yelling and brandishing their broadswords and axes, made some ineffectual attempts to reach the horsemen; but receiving another fire from the little ordnance-train of Captain Gray, they took to flight, and in an incredibly short time were out of sight and pursuit. Still, however, a large body remained ; and Argyll had the advantage not only of the sun, then shining fiercely in the eyes of his opponents, glancing on their steel coats and mak ing the plain appear on fire, but of the ground : for his army were arrayed on the top of a steep hill covered with high heather and stones, whilst the ground at the bottom was soft and mossy, full of holes, \u2014 called in that country peat-pots, and dan gerous for cavalry. But all this did not deter Huntly's vanguard, under Errol and Auchendown, from advancing resolutely to the attack. Errol, how ever, dreading the marsh, made an oblique move ment by some firmer ground which lay on one side, and hoped thus to turn the flank of the enemy ; but Sir Patrick Gordon of Auchendown, urged on by his fiery temper, spurred his horse directly towards the"], [194, "170 1594. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. hill, and getting entangled with his men in the mossy ground, was exposed to a murderous fire from the force under Maclean of Duart. This chieftain was con spicuous from his great stature and strength ; he was covered with a shirt of mail, wielded a double-edged Danish battle-axe, and appears to have been a more experienced officer than the rest, as he placed his men, who were mostly hagbutteers, in a small copse wood hard by, from which they could deliver their fire, and be screened from the attack of cavalry. Auch endown, nevertheless, although his ranks were dread fully thinned by this fire of the enemy's infantry, man aged to disengage them, and spurring up the hill, received a bullet in the body, and fell from his horse; whilst his companions shouted with grief and rage, and made desperate efforts to rescue him. The Highlanders, however, who knew him well, rushed in upon him, despatched him with their dirks, and cutting off his head displayed it in savage triumph, \u2014 a sight which so enraged the Gor dons, that they fought with a fury which alike dis regarded discipline and life. This gave an advantage to Maclean, who, enclosing the enemy's vanguard, and pressing it into narrow space between his own force and Argyll's, would have cut them to pieces had not Huntly come speedily to their support and renewed the battle; attacking both Argyll and Maclean with desperate energy, and calling loudly to his friends to revenge Auchendown. It was at this moment that some of the Gordons caught a sight of Fraser, the King's herald, who rode"], [195, "1594. 171 JAMES VT. beside Argyll, and was dressed in his tabard, with the Red Lion embroidered on it, within the double tressure. This ought to have been his protection ; but it seemed rather to point him out as a victim : and the horsemen shouting out, \" Have at the Lion,\" ran him through Avith their spears, and slew him on the spot. The battle was now at its height, and raged for two hours with the utmost cruelty. Errol was severely wounded with a bullet in the arm, and by one of the sharp-barbed arrows of the Highland bowmen which pierced deep into the thigh. He lost his pennon, or guidon, also ; which was won by Maclean. Gordon of Gight was struck with three bullets through the body, and had two plaits of his steel coat carried into him ; wounds which next day proved mortal. Huntly himself was in imminent danger of his life ; for his horse was shot under him, and the Highlanders were about to attack him on the ground with their knives and axes, when he was extricated and horsed again by Innermarkie ; after which he again charged the enemy under Argyll, whose troops wavered, and at last began to fly in such numbers that only twenty men were left round him. Upon this the young chief, overcome with grief and vexa tion at so disgraceful a desertion, shed tears of rage, and would have still renewed the fight, had not Mur ray of Tullibardin seized his bridle and forced him off the field. Seeing the day lost, Maclean, who had done most, and suffered least in this cruel fight, with drew his men from the wood, and retired in good order; but seven hundred Highlanders were slain in the"], [196, "172 1594. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. chase, which was continued till the steepness of the mountains rendered further pursuit impossible. Such was the celebrated battle of Glenlivat. The loss on Huntly's side was mostly of gentlemen, of whom Sir Patrick Gordon of Auchendown, his uncle, \" a wise, valiant, and resolute knight,\" was chiefly lamented. Besides him, twenty other gentlemen were slain, and some forty or fifty wounded; but the victory was com plete, and recalled to memory the bloody fight of Harlaw, in 1411, between the Earl of Mar and Donald Balloch ; in which, under somewhat similar circumstances, the superior armour and discipline of the Lowland knights proved too strong for the fero cious but irregular efforts of a much larger force of Highlanders.1 During these transactions, the King, unconscious of this reverse, had left his palace at Stirling, and ad vanced with his army to Dundee, where Argyll, in per son, brought him the news of his own defeat. James, however, was more enraged than dismayed by this in telligence. He ha,d left his capital so well defended2 that he dreaded nothing from Bothwell. He knew that, from the exhausted state of the country, it would be impossible for Huntly to keep his forces together; and he swore that the death of a royal herald, who had been murdered with the King's coat on, should be avenged on these audacious rebels. Nor did he fail 1 The above account of the battle of Glenlivat is taken chiefly from the original letters of Bowes, who was on the spot. 2 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Bowes to Sir R. Cecil, 3d October.

In spite of the severity of the season, he advanced with his army to Aberdeen, attended by Andrew Melvil and a body of the min isters of the Kirk, who, with the feeling that this was a crusade against the infidels, had joined the camp, and loudly applauded the meditated vengeance of the monarch.1 He thence pushed on to Strathbogie. This noble residence of Huntly,2 Avhich had been fourteen years in building, was blown up with gun powder, and levelled in two days ; nothing being left but the great old tower, whose massive masonry defied the efforts of the pioneers ; whilst its master, deserted by his barons and dependants, fled into the mountainous parts of Caithness.3 James had been much incensed against him by the scornful contents of an intercepted letter written to Angus, in which Huntly spoke of the King's rumoured campaign as likely to turn out a \"gowk's storm.\" i Slanes in Buchan, the principal castle of Errol, who still lay languishing from his Avounds ; Culsamond in Garioch, the house of the laird of Newton-Gordon ; Bagays and Craig in Angus, the castles of Sir Walter Lind- 1 MS.

A charge was next given to the barons and gentlemen who resided north of the river Dee, to apprehend all the rebels within their boundaries ; and although in the greatest possible distress for money to pay his troops, the King, Avho trusted to the solemn promises of Elizabeth, made an effort to keep them together ; and left behind him a body of two hundred horse, and one hundred 1 MS.

He had done this, trusting to her promises of that pecuniary aid which aa'u.s absolutely necessary for the payment of his troops ; and before he set out, had despatched his secretary, Sir Robert Cockburn, to the English Court,2 with the perfect confidence that everything which had been undertaken by \" his good sister\" would be fulfilled. In this, however, he was miserably disappointed. Whilst the King Avas engaged in burning and razing the houses of the Catholics, Elizabeth and the hoav vener able Burghley Avere closeted at Greenwich, laying their heads together to find out some plausible excuse for stopping the payment of the promised supplies. Cock burn, the Ambassador, was artfully detained and de layed from Aveek to week, and month to month, till the result of the campaign could be guessed Avith some certainty.

For this unwise and double conduct in the Queen there could be no defence. She had first excited James to this northern expedition by flattery and large pro mises of support ; she now forgot all, and deserted him Avithout scruple or remorse.

The King's debts Avere enormous, and more money still Avas imperiously required to pay his troops and retain the advantages he had acquired. His late severities to the Catholic earls, and his alliance Avith the Kirk, the ministers of Avhich noAV lauded as highly as they had vituperated him, had lost him the friend- ship of all his foreign allies, and of the influential body of the English Catholics ; and within his own Court and Council there were so many riAralries and jealousies, so much plotting and intriguing, that, on his return, he found the campaign in the North almost less irksome than the civil battles he had to fight in his OAvn palace. The great struggle Avas be- tween the Lord Chancellor Thirlstane and the Earl of Mar. Thirlstane's faction Avas strong ; embracing Hamilton, Athol, Hume, Buccleugh, Ogilvy, and many others. Mar, on the other hand, had the keeping of the Prince, commanded the castles of Stirling and Edinburgh, and enjoyed the complete confidence of the King, who had become somewhat suspicious and impatient under the grasping and increasing power of the Chancellor. But James had another and nearer source of anxiety in the Queen, Avho was equally the enemy of Mar and Thirlstane. This Princess, for a considerable period after her marriage, appears to have shunned all inter ference with party or public affairs ; but she Avas jealous of Thirlstane, who had opposed her marriage,"], [205, "1594. 181 JAMES VI. and AAras said to have secretly attacked her honour ; and of Mar, because her son, the young heir to the throne, had been committed in charge to him rather than to her. Besides, she and the Kin?, though out- Avardly living on fair and decent terms, Avere neither loving nor confidential. James' cold temperament and coarse jokes disgusted the Queen, who was not insensible to admiration; and she consoled herself, for the desertion of her lord, in the more attractive society of the young Duke of Lennox, the noblest of the Scot tish courtiers. This, on the other hand, roused the royal jealousy ; and about the time of the christening, Mr John Colvil assured Sir Robert Cecil, whom he calls his most honourable lord and M\u00e6cenas, that matters were on a very miserable footing, He writes as follows : \u2014 \" These feAV lines I thought meet only to put in your hands, to go no further but to her Majesty, and your most honourable father my special good lord.

In the North, also, everything was in commotion; for although Lennox had, for a brief season, succeeded in restoring tranquillity, by the vigour with which he had executed the charge committed to him, all be came again disordered on his retirement from office. The great cause of these excesses was to be traced to some extraordinary discoATeries made at this time by the young Earl of Argyll, Avhich showed that treachery, not cowardice, had been the cause of his defeat at Glenlivat. It was found out, by the con fessions of some accomplices, that Campbell of Loch nell, the near relative of the young chief, and, failing an only brother, the heir to his estates and honours, had been tampering Avith Huntly; and that the flight of so large a body of Highlanders Avas only part of a conspiracy against the life of Argyll. It was dis covered, also, by evidence which could not be con tradicted, that this foul plot against the young earl was intimately connected Avith the late murder of the Earl of Murray and the assassination of the Laird of Calder ; that all were branches of one great con spiracy, of which a chief contriver was Maitland the Chancellor, assisted by Huntly, Duncan Campbell of Glenurchy, Archibald Campbell of Lochnell, Sir James Campbell of Ardkinglas, Macaulay of Ardin caple, and John Lord Maxwell. These titled and official ruffians, in the spirit of the times, which could combine the strictest legal precision with"], [208, "184 1594. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the utmost familiarity with blood, had drawn up a band, by which, in the most solemn manner, they be came mutually bound to each other to achieve the murder of James Earl of Murray, Archibald Earl of Argyll, Colin Campbell of Lundy his only brother, and John Campbell of Calder. The result Avas to be the possession of the earldom of Argyll by Loch nell, and the appropriation of a large part of its princely estates by the Chancellor Maitland and the other conspirators. With the success of one part of this conspiracy, the cruel murder of the Earl of Murray, Ave are already acquainted ; and, in the case of the Laird of Calder, they were also successful : for this unfortunate gentleman was about this time shot at night, through the windoAV of his own house, in Lorn, by an assassin named M'Kellar, Avho had been furnished with a hagbut by Ardkinglas, which, to make surer Avork, he had loaded Avith three bullets. So far this diabolical plot was followed out Avith success. But at this crisis, the remorse or interest of Ardkinglas revealed the conspiracy to Argyll ; and the appre hension, torture, and confession of John Oig Camp bell and M'Kellar, Avho Avere executed, led, at last, to the revelation of the \" Great Contract,\" as it was called. The \"Band\" itself fell into the hands of Argyll, and convinced him that the assassination of his unhappy friends, Murray and Calder, Avas to haAre been followed, on the first good opportunity that should present itself, by the murder of himself. Of all this the consequences were dreadful. Argyll hurried to the North, assembled his vassals, and proclaimed"], [209, "1594-5. 185 JAMES VI. a Avar of extermination against Huntly, and all who had opposed or deserted him at Glenlivat.1 Huntly? on the other hand, having, by this time, somewhat re covered his recent losses, Avas once more in the field, and threatened to hang up any retainer of his, high or Ioav, Avho dared to pay the fines leA'ied on him, or sought for peace in obedience to the laAvs.2 Mar, a nobleman ATery poAverful in the North as well as the South, joined with Argyll; Avhilst Huntly had many friends at Court, who secretlv screened him in his excesses. The ministers of the Kirk, in the meantime, sounded their terrible trumpet of Avarning to all true men, denouncing from the pulpit the reviving influ ence of the Catholics ; and large bodies of soldiers, disbanded for want of pay, roamed over the country, and committed every sort of robbery and excess. Ministers of religion Avere murdered ; fathers slain by their own sons ; brothers by their brethren ; married Avomen ravished under their oavii roof; houses, with their miserable inmates, burned amidst savage mirth ; and the land so utterly wasted by fire, plunder, and the total cessation of agricultural labour, that famine at last stalked in to complete the horrid picture, and destroy, by the most terrible of deaths, those who had escaped the sword.3 Amidst these dreadful excesses, the only support of 1 MS.

But although de serted by Elizabeth, and compelled to disband his troops and relax his military efforts against the Catholics, James assembled a Convention of his nobles; and evinced not only a sympathy for the sufferings of the people, but his resolution to make the utmost efforts to remove them.1 Finding it im possible to reduce the northern districts to order Avithout vigorous proceedings against the chiefs, he committed Athol, Lo vat, and M'Kenzie to ward at Linlithgow; imprisoned Argyll, Glenurchy, and others, in Edinburgh castle ; and confined Tullybardin, Garn tully, and their fierce adherents, in Dumbarton and Blackness : to remain in this durance till they had made redress for the horrid excesses committed by their clansmen and supporters, and had come under an obligation to restore order to the country.2 As to the Catholic earls, and Bothwell their associate, both parties, iioav nearly desperate of any ultimate success, and driven by the active pursuit of the King from one concealment to another, were anxious to reach the sea-coast and escape to the Continent.

His brother, Hercules Stewart, suffered on the scaffold ; and the Kirk branded him Avith excom munication. William Hume, the brother of Davy the Devil, or David Hume of Manderston, whom Bothwell had slain, was employed to trace the fugi tive from cover to cover ; and executing this service with a scent sharpened by revenge, he ran him through Caithness to the sea-coast ; from which, after various windings and doublings, he escaped to France.2 Meanwhile, Huntly and Errol lingered in Scotland, with a last hope that assistance in money and in troops was on the eve of arriving from Spain ; but this prospect was utterly blasted by a disaster which befell their messenger Mr John Morton, a Jesuit, brother to the Laird of Cambo, who had been in trusted with a secret mission by the King of Spain and the Pope.

Mait land strengthened himself against his enemies by courting the favour of the Queen, who had at first treated all his advances with haughty suspicion ; but latterly, dreading his strength or conciliated by his proffered devotion, supported his faction, which in cluded Buccleugh, Cessford, the Master of Glammis, and other powerful barons. The potent house of Hamilton affected neutrality; whilst the ministers of 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Bothwell to Douglas, 17th June, 1595. 2 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, George Nicolson to Sir E.

This James Avisely refused. Enough, he thought, had already been done for the safety of the Protestant faith ; and to cut up by the roots the ancient houses of Angus, Huntly, and Errol ; to punish, by utter ruin and extermination, those Avho Avere already exiles for conscience' sake, would have been cruel and impolitic.

The principle of James Avas to balance the different factions against each other, keeping all dependent on himself, and throAving his Aveight occasionally into the one or the other scale as he judged best. The probable restoration, therefore, of such great men as Huntly, Avas a useful threat to hold over the heads of their rivals.

He was branded as a hypocrite : all smiles and pro fessions upon the seat of justice, but deep, bloody, and unscrupulous when off it ; expressing great love to the Kirk and the ministers, yet careless of practi cal religion ; humble and devoted, as he said, to his sovereign, yet really so haughty, that he did not hesitate to measure his strength with the highest nobles in the land. It was this which provoked Mar, Argyll, and the rest of the ancient earls. On one occasion James, observing Maitland's defiance, took him roundly to task \u2014 reminding him that he Avas but his creature, a man of yesterday, a cadet of a mean house compared Avith Mar, who had a dozen vassals for his one;1 and that it ill became him to enter into proud speeches, or compare himself with the old nobles, and raise factions with Glammis and the Queen against the master to whom he owed all. Pasquils too, and biting epigrams, prognosticating some fatal end, were found pinned to his seat in the Court.2 But Maitland Avas naturally courageous, and believed himself poAverful enough to keep head against the Avorst. Hamilton, Hume, Fleming, Livingston, Buccleugh, Cessford, Avith the Master of Glammis, had now joined him against Mar; and the Queen, finding herself thus supported, renewed her efforts to obtain possession of the young Prince.

He had been heard to swear that, were he on his death-bed and speechless, his last sign should be that Mar should have the boy ; and the Queen, in despair, took to bed and pretended a mortal sickness. James shut his ears when the news Avas brought him, and declared it all a trick. At last the lady, between anger and the agitation incident to her situation, for she Avas about to be confined, fell truly sick. The Mistress of Ochiltree, and a jury of matrons, sat upon her malady, and pronounced it no counterfeit ; and James, in real alarm, hurried from Falkland. To his disgust and anger, it Avas told him that Buccleugh and Cessford, the two men whom he then most dreaded, were with her ; but they did not dare abide his coming : and a reconciliation, half stormy, half affectionate, took place. She renewed her clamour for the keeping of the Prince : he up braided her for leaguing with such desperate men as Buccleugh and Cessford, who, in truth, at that mo ment were plotting to restrain his person, seize the heir of the throne, and arraign his governor, one of the most faithful of his nobles, of high treason. To humour her would have been the extremity of weakness, and only playing his enemies' game, who, he said, should find that, though he loved her, he could keep his purpose and be master in his own kingdom.1 This re solute temper saved the monarch.

All Avas ready: the King, the Prince, the government, by one bold stroke might be their own. But Maitland's heart failed, or his loyalty re- vived. He forbade the enterprise. James rode back to Falkland ; and Avhen he next visited Edinburgh, his strength Avas such that he could defy his enemies.1 The ministers of the Kirk, scandalized by the divisions in the royal family, iioav remonstrated Avith the Queen, awakened her to a higher sense of her conjugal duties, and convinced her, that to renounce all factions, and folloAV the commands of her royal husband, Avas her only safe and Christian course.2 A letter, written at this time by Nicolson, the English EnAroy at the Scottish Court, to Sir Robert Bowes, Avho, at his own earnest request, had been suffered to resign his place as resident Ambassador, gives us an interesting account of this reconciliation and its effects : \u2014 \" The King and Queen are lovingly together now at Falkland : the King to go to Stirling to-morrow, and so to his buck-hunting in Lennox and Clydesdale ; and after to return to the Queen to St Johnston's, there to receive the communion together.

She was now trembling for her empire in Ireland, where Tyrone had risen in formidable force, and, assisted with Roman gold and Spanish promises, threatened to wrest from her hands the fairest provinces of the kingdom.

These nurseries of brave soldiers and hardy seamen Avere now able to furnish a formidable force; a circumstance not unknoAvn to the English Queen, as her indefatigable minister Burghley, Avhose di plomatic feelers were as long as they were acute and sensitive, kept up a communication with the Isles. From a paper Avritten in the end of the year 1593, by one of his northern correspondents,1 it appears that the Isles could, on any emer gency, fit out a force of six thousand hardy troops, inured to danger both by sea and land, and equipt for Avar on either element. Of these, two thousand wore defensive armour, actons, habergeons, and knapsculls ; 2 the rest were boAvmen or pikemen ; but many, adds the Island statist, had noAV become harquebuseers. This force, it is to be observed, was independent of those left at home to labour the ground ; the whole of the Isles being different from the rest of feudal Scotland in one essential respect, \"that they who occupied the ground, were not charged to the wars.\"3 Of this Western archipelago, the principal islands Avere Lewis and Skye, lying to the north, Islay and Mull to the south ; and amongst the chief leaders who assumed the state and independence 1 MS.

Lauchlan Mor was, in all re spects, a remarkable person ; by no means illiterate, for he had received his nurture in the low country, and had married a daughter of the Earl of Glencairn. But in Avar and personal proAvess he had then no equal : an island Amadis of colossal strength and stature ; and possessing, by the vigour of his natural talents, a com manding influence over the rude and fierce Islesmen. It is curious to trace Elizabeth's connexion with this man. The Lord of Duart's confidential servant happened to be a certain shreAvd Celt, named John Achinross ; he, in turn, was connected by marriage Avith Master John Cunningham, a worthy citizen and merchant in Edinburgh. This honest bailie of the capital, forming the link between savage and civi lized life, corresponded with Sir Robert Bowes ; BoAves Avith Burghley or Sir Robert Cecil ; and thus Elizabeth, sitting in her closet at Windsor or Green- 1 Gregory's History of the Western Highlands and Isles of Scotland, p. 261."], [225, "1595. 201 JAMES VI. wich, moved the strings which could assemble or disperse the chivalry of the Isles. This is no ideal picture, for the letters of the actors remain. As early as March, 1594-5, Achinross informed Bowes that Maclean and Argyll Avere ready, not only to stay the Clandonnell, Avho, under Donald Gorm, Avere then mustering to assist Tyrone; but that Mac lean himself would join the English army in Ireland, if Elizabeth would despatch three or four ships to keep his galleys Avhilst they attacked the enemy.1 As the summer came on, and the fleet of Donald and his associates Avaited only for a fair Avind, Cunning ham hurried to the Isles, had a conference with Maclean, and thence rode post to London, where, in an interview Avith Sir Robert Cecil, he urged the necessity of instant action and assistance.2 The bridle Avhich the Laird of Duart held over the Isles men was simple enough ; being a garrison of six hundred mercenaries, well armed, and ready to be led by him, on a moment's Avarning, against any island chief who embarked in foreign service, and left his lands undefended at home.3 The support of this force, however, required funds: Elizabeth de murred ; Maclean Avas obliged to disband his men ; 1 MS.

But Maclean, by what Achinross termed \" a bauld onset and prattie feit of weir,\" took the Avhole company prisoners, threw the chiefs into irons, sent them to his dungeons in his different castles, appropriated their galleys, and trans ported the common men to the mainland.4 Amongst the chief prisoners then taken, were the Captain of Clanranald and three of his uncles, the Laird of Knoydart, M'lan of Ardnamurchan, Donald Gorm's brother, and others ; and an account of the surprise was immediately transmitted by John Achinross to Nicolson, the English Envoy at the Court of James.

She wrote, at the same time, to the Earl of Argyll,2 flattered him by some rich token of her regard, and ordered Nicolson, her resi dent at the Scottish Court, to deliver it and her letter to him in person, at Dunoon in Argyll. All this was successfully accomplished : and so cordially did Maclean and Argyll cooperate, sowing distrust and division amongst the chiefs and leaders who had folloAved the banner of Donald Gorm and Macleod, that their formidable force only made the coast of Ireland to meet the English ships, which were on the watch for them, enter into a friendly treaty, and disperse to their different ocean nests, before a single effort of any moment had been made.

A black cloud had been seen to gather over Ireland ; and men waited in stillness for the growl of the thunder and the SAveep of the tempest, Avhen it melted into air, and all was once more tran quillity. This seemed unaccountable, almost mira culous; but the letters of honest John Cunningham, and his Celtic relative Achinross, whose epistles smack so strongly of his Gaelic original, introduce us behind the scenes, and discover Lauchlan Mor as the secret agent, the Celtic Prospero, whose wand dis persed the galleys, and restored serenity to the ocean.

The Chancellor Maitland, Lord Thirlstane, had now, for some years, ruled the Court and the country Avith a firm, unchallenged, and, as many thought, a haughty superiority.

But he had kept his ground, partly by superiority in prac- tical business talents to all his competitors ; partly by that deep political sagacity and foresight which made Burghley pronounce him the \" wisest man in Scotland ;\" and, not least of all, by that high per- sonal courage and somewhat unscrupulous familiarity with conspiracy, and even Avith blood, Avhich blotted most men of this semi-barbarous age. He had, be- sides, been a pretty consistent Protestant ; and al- though in earlier years he had attacked some of Knox's political dicta, yet recently, the strong and decided part he had adopted against Huntly and the Catholic earls made him a favourite with the minis- ters of the Kirk. So resistless had he iioav become, that the Queen and her friends had renounced all opposition, and joined his faction against Mar the Governor of the Prince, the favourite of his royal master, and one of the oldest and most poAverful of the higher nobles.1 In this his palmy state, when plotting neAV schemes of ambition, and inflaming the King against the Queen; meeting Cessford and Buc- cleugh, and his other associates, in night trysts ; mar- shalling secretly his whole strength, and laying a \" platt,\" as it was then called, or conspiracy against Mar, by which he hoped to hurl him from his height of power, and rule unchecked over his sovereign ; he was suddenly seized with a mortal distemper.2 At 1 MS.

This idea was encouraged by the Queen, Avho now lived on the most loving terms with her lord, and omitted no opportunity to point out the rapid diminution of the CroAvn revenues, and the contrast between her own command of money, out of so small a dowry as she enjoyed, and the reduced and beggarly condition of the household and palaces of her royal consort.

Nothing, she said, could give her greater delight than to receive such assurances of kindness and affection ; and she Avould readily folloAV her advice, as of one Avhom she most honoured, loved, and trusted ; but as to the delicate subject of the late differences between her and the King, and her Avish to get the Prince into her hands, the matter had been so sudden, and full of peril, that she dared not send either letter or message to the Queen of England. She then threw the blame of the Avhole on the late Chancellor ; avIio had acted, she said, with great baseness, both toAvards herself and the King. It Avas he had first moved her to get the 1 MS.

He set, however, Cunningham and Achin ross, his former agents, to work; and when these active emissaries got amongst the Highlanders, the storm of letters, memorials, contracts, queries, answers, and estimates, soon poured down on the unhappy head of Bowes ; who implored Cecil, but with small success, to send him instructions, and some por tion of treasure, to satisfy Elizabeth's Celtic auxili- 1 MS.

As Elizabeth advanced to old age, his eye became steadily fixed on the English crown, Avhich he considered his undoubt ed right; and the one great engrossing object of his policy was to secure it. His fairest chance, he thought, to gain the respect and good Avishes of the English people, when death took from them their oAvn great Princess, was to shoAv that he knew hoAv to rule over his OAvn unruly subjects. Hence his vigorous deter mination to restrain, by every possible means, the poAver of the greater nobility ; to recruit his ex hausted finances ; to reduce the Isles, and consolidate his kingdom ; and to bridle the claims of the Kirk, in all matters of civil government, or interference with the royal prerogative : Avhilst he Avarmly seconded their efforts for the preservation of the Reformed religion, and resistance to the efforts of its enemies. Not long after Bowes' arrival, the ConA'ention of the General Assembly met in Edinburgh ; and the King, then absent on a hunting expedition, broke off his sport, and returned to Holyrood, that he might \" honour the Kirk (as BoAAres observed) Avith his presence and his Oration.\" The Moderator, Mr Robert Pont, Avarmly welcomed the royal party ; which embraced the Duke of Lennox, Lord Hamil ton, the Earls of Argyll, Mar, and Orkney : and, addressing the King, thanked him in name of the Assembly for his presence ; reminding him of the honour obtained by Constantine, in favouring the ancient Fathers of the Church ; and by David, in"], [242, "1596. 218 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. dancing before the ark. In reply, James professed his zeal for religion since his youth up. He had ever esteemed it, as he declared, more glory to be a Chris tian than a King, Avhatever slanders to the contrary were spoken against him. It Avas this zeal Avhich moved him to convene the present Assembly : for being aAvare of the designs of Spain, their great enemy, against religion and this isle, he was anxious to meet, not only the ministry, but the barons and gen tlemen ; to receive their advice, and resolve on mea sures to resist the common enemy. Tavo points he Avould press on them : reformation and preparation ; the reformation of themselves, clergy, people, and King. For his oavii part, he never refused admoni tion ; he Avas ever anxious to be told his faults ; and his chamber door should never be closed to any minister who reproved him. All he begged Avas, that they Avould first speak privately before they arraigned him in open pulpit. He hated the common vice of ambition ; but of one thing he was really ambitious \u2014 to have the name of James the Sixth honoured as the establisher of religion, and the provider of livings for the ministry throughout his whole dominions. And iioav as to his second point, preparation against the common enemy, one thing Avas clear: they must have paid troops. The country must be put to charges. The times were changed since their fore fathers followed each his lord or his laird to Pinky field ; a confused multitude, incapable of discipline, and an easy prey to regular soldiers, as the event of that miserable day could testify.

Since then the fashion and art of war had entirely altered ; and he protested it was a shame that Scotland should be lying in careless security, whilst all other countries Avere up and in arms.1 This speech gaA7e great satisfaction to the minis ters ; and their joy was increased by a message brought to them soon after by Mr John Preston and Mr Edward Bruce, intimating the King's resolution to have the Avhole Kirks in Scotland supplied with min isters, and endoAved with sufficient stipends. He requested the Kirk to cause their Commissioners to meet with those councillors and officers whom he had appointed for this purpose, and to fix upon some plan for carrying his resolution into effect. But he com manded his Commissioners to represent to the minis ters of the Kirk Iioav much this good AATork Avas hindered by themselves. Why did they teach the people that the King and his councillors resisted the planting of kirks, and swalloAved up the livings of the clergy, when they were truly most Avilling that the whole kirks should be planted, and the rents of the ministers augmented, as far as could be obtained Avith consent of the nobility and the tacksmen of the teinds, whose rights, without order of law, could not be impaired?2 1 MS.

Sir Walter Scott of Buccleugh, a baron of proud temper, undaunted courage, and considered one of the ablest military leaders in Scotland, was at this time Warden of the West Marches ; having for his brother Avarden of England, Lord Scrope, also a brave and experienced officer. Scrope's deputy Avas a gentle man of the name of Salkeld ; Buccleugh's, a baron of his OAvn clan, Robert Scott of Haining ; and in the absence of the principals, it AATas the duty of these subordinate officers to hold the Warden Courts for the punishment of outlaAVS and offenders. Such courts presented a curious spectacle : for men met in perfect peace and security, protected by the laAv of the Borders, Avhich made it death for any Englishman or Scotsman to draAv weapon upon his greatest foe, from the time of holding the Court till next morn ing at sunrise. It AATas judged that, in this interval, all might return home ; and it is easy to see that, with such a population as that of the Borders, nothing but the most rigid enforcement of this law could saA'e the country from perpetual rapine and murder. William Armstrong of Kinmont, or in the more graphic and endearing phraseology of the Borders, Kinmont Willie, Avas at this time one of the most notorious and gallant thieA'es or freebooters in Lid- 1 MS.

He Avas himself a man of great personal strength and stature, and had four sons, Jock, Fran cie, Geordie, and Sandie Armstrong, each of them a braver and more successful moss-trooper than the other. Their exploits had made them knoAvn and dreaded over the whole district ; and their father and they had more \"Bills filed\" against them at the War den Courts, more personal quarrels and family feuds to keep their blood hot and their hands on their weapons, than any twenty men in Liddesdale. This Willie of Kinmont, Avho was a retainer of Buccleugh and a special favourite of his chief, had been attending a Warden Court, held by the English and Scottish depute Wardens, at a place named the Dayholm of Kershope, Avhere a small burn or rivulet divides the two countries, and was quietly returning home through Liddesdale, Avith three or four in company, when he Avas suddenly attacked by a body of two hun dred English Borderers, chased for some miles, captured, tied to a horse, and carried in triumph to Carlisle castle ; Avhere Lord Scrope the Governor and Warden cast him, heavily ironed, into the common prison. Such an outrageous violation of Border law Avas instantly complained of by Buccleugh, Avho Avrote repeatedly to Lord Scrope, demanding the release of his folloAver ; and receiving no satisfactory reply, SAVore that he would bring Kinmont Willie out of Carlisle castle, quick or dead, with his own hand.1 The threat was esteemed a mere bravado; for the 1 MS.

Yet Buccleugh was not intimidated. Choosing a dark tempestuous night, (the 13th April,) he assembled two hundred of his bravest men at the Tower of Morton, a fortalice on \" the debateable land,\" on the water of Sark, about ten miles from Carlisle. Amongst these, the leader whom he most relied on Avas Wat Scott of Harden : but along Avith him were Wat Scott of Branxholm, Wat Scott of Goldielands, Jock Elliot of the CopshaAV, Sandie Armstrong son to Hobbie the Laird of Mangerton, Kinmont's four sons \u2014 Jock, Francie, Sandie, and Geordie Armstrong, Rob of the Langholm, and Willie Bell the Red cloak ; all noted and daring men. They were well mounted, armed at all points, and carried Avith them scaling ladders, besides iron croAvbars, sledge-hammers, hand-picks, and axes. Thus furnished, and favoured by the extreme darkness of the night, they passed the river Esk, rode briskly through the Grahames' coun try, forded the Eden, then swollen over its banks, and came to the brook Caday, close by Carlisle, where Buccleugh made his men dismount, and silently led eighty of them, with the ladders and iron tools, to the foot of the Avail of the base or outer court of the castle. Everything favoured them: the heavens Avere as black as pitch, the rain descended in torrents ; and as they raised their ladders to fix them on the cope-stone, they could hear the English sentinels challenge as they Avalked their rounds. To their"], [248, "1596. 224 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. rage and disappointment, the ladders proved too short ; but finding a postern in the Avail, they under mined it, and soon made a breach enough for a soldier to squeeze through. In this AAray a dozen stout fel- Ioavs passed into the outer court, (Buccleugh himself being the fifth man Avho entered,1) disarmed and bound the watch, wrenched open the postern from the inside, and thus admitting their companions, Avere masters of the place. Twenty-four troopers iioav rushed to the castle jail, Buccleugh meantime keeping the postern, forced the door of the chamber Avhere Kinmont Avas confined, carried him off in his irons, and sounding their trumpet, the signal agreed on, Avere ansAvered by loud shouts and the trumpet of Buccleugh, Avhose troopers filled the base court. All Avas iioav terror and confusion, both in town and castle. The alarum-bell rang, and Avas ansAvered by his brazen brethren of the cathedral and the town-house ; the beacon blazed up on the top of the great tower; and its red, uncertain glare on the black sky and the shadoAvy forms and glancing armour of the Borderers, rather increased the horror and their numbers. None could see their enemy or tell his real strength. Lord Scrope, believing, as he aftenvards Avrote to Burghley, that five hundred Scots were in possession of the castle, kept himself close Avithin his chamber. Kin mont Will himself, as he Avas carried on his friend's shoulders beneath the Warden's AvindoAV, roared out a lusty \" Good night \" to his Lordship ; and in a 1 MS. Letter, St. P.

This brilliant exploit, the last and assuredly one of the bravest feats of Border Avarfare, Avas long talked of ; embalmed in an inimitable ballad ; and fondly dwelt on by tradition, Avhich has preserved some graphic touches. Kinmont in SAvimming his horse through the Eden, which was then flooded, Avas much cumbered by the irons round his ancles; and is said to have drily observed, that often as he had breasted it, he never had such heavy spurs. His master, Buccleugh, eager to rid him of these shackles, halted at the first smith's house they came to within the Scottish Border ; but the door was locked, the family in bed, and the knight of the hammer so sound a sleeper, that he Avas only wakened by the Lord Warden thrusting his long spear through the AvindoAV, and nearly spitting both Vulcan and his lady.1 Jocular, hoAvever, as Avere these circumstances to the victors, the business was no laughing matter to Lord Scrope, who came forth from his bedchamber to find that his castle had been stormed, his garrison bearded, and his prisoner carried off by only eighty men. He instantly Avrote to the Privy Council and Lord Burghley, complaining of so audacious an 1 Contemporary Account in the Warrender MSS.; and MS. Letter, St. P. Oft'. B.C., Lord Scrope to Burghley.

But Buccleugh had much to offer in his defence : he pleaded that Kin mont's seizure and imprisonment had been a gross violation of the laAV ; that it Avas not until every possible representation had failed, and till his oavii sovereign's remonstrance, addressed to Elizabeth, had been treated with contempt, that he took the matter into his own hands; and that his Borderers had committed no outrage, either on life or property, although they might have made Scrope and his garri son prisoners, and sacked the city. All this was true ; and the King for a while resisted compliance Avith Elizabeth's demand, in Avhich he was supported by the whole body of his Council and barons, and even by the ministers of the Kirk ; whilst the people were clamorous in their applause, and declared that no more gallant action had been done even in Wallace's days.1 But at last James' spirit quailed under the impetuous remonstrance of the Queen ; and the Border chief was first committed to ward in the castle of St Andrews,2 and afterwards sent on parole to England, where he remained till the outrages of the English Borderers rendered his services as Warden abso lutely necessary to preserve the country from havoc.3 1 MS.

As early as May, BoAves had detected the incipient movement in favour of the banished earls, and their resolution to petition the King for their return.2 They were to make submis sion to the King and the Church, and to have their cause espoused by the Duke of Lennox. Not long after, the Earl of Huntly landed from the Continent at Eyemouth ; and passing in disguise into Scotland, encountered, on his road, the Lord St Colm, whose brother he had slain. Fortunately for the returned exile, his mean dress concealed him from the ven geance of his enemy, and he arrived safely amongst his friends; who, aware of the Court intrigues in his favour, exerted their utmost efforts to procure his restoration. But these Avere met by cries of horror and warning from the Kirk, Avhich increased to their loudest note when it was reported that Errol had been seen with Huntly at his castle the Bog of Gight, and that Angus had dared to come secretly into Perth, from Avhich he Avas only driven by a per emptory charge of the magistrates.3 Meanwhile the Countess of Huntly, Avho had much influence at Court, presented some overtures upon the part of her husband.

To remedy or avert these evils, a day of humiliation Avas appointed to be observed with more than ordinary rigour ; in which the people and the ministry were called upon to Aveep, between the porch and the altar, for a land polluted by the enemies of God, and threatened with the loss of his favour. A body of sixteen commis sioners AAras selected from the ministers, who were to sit monthly at Edinburgh, under the name of the \" Council of the Church :\" their duty Avas to provide, according to the ancient phrase, \" Ne quid Ecclesia detrimenti caperet ;\" and through them a constant cor respondence was kept up with all parts of the realm.1 These proceedings alarmed the King, who could see no good grounds for the erection of so formidable a O \u00a9 machinery against what he deemed an imaginary attack, and directed some members of his Privy Council to hold a meeting with the more moderate ministers, and persuade them of the groundlessness of their apprehensions. If, he said, the three earls were repentant ; if they had already suffered exile and were solicitous to hear the truth and return to their country and the bosom of the Church, why should he, their Prince, be precluded from the exer cise of mercy, the brightest jewel in his prerogative? and why, above all, should the Church, Avhose doors ought ever to stand open to returning penitents, shut them remorselessly in their faces, and consign them to darkness and despair? 1 .Spottiswood, p. 418."], [255, "1596. 231 JAMES VI. These sentiments of the King were as politic as they Avere merciful ; for in the present state of the kingdom, considering Elizabeth's advanced age and the poAver of the Roman Catholics in Eng land as well as in his own dominions, nothing could have been more unfavourable to his title of suc cession than to have become a religious persecutor. Indeed, the arguments of the more violent amongst the ministers were reArolting and absurd. The crime of which the Catholic earls had been guilty (so they reasoned) was of that atrocious nature Avhich rendered pardon, by the civil power, im possible. They Avere idolaters and must die the death ; though, upon repentance, they might be ab solved by the Kirk from the sentence of spiritual death.1 Such a merciless mode of reasoning, pro ceeding, as Spottiswood has remarked, rather from \" passion than any good zeal,\" greatly disgusted the King ; Avho perceived that, under the alleged necessity of Avatching over the purity of the faith, the Kirk Avere erecting a tribunal independent alike of the law and the throne. Nor did James conceal these senti ments ; inveighing bitterly against the ministers, both in public and private, at council and table. It was in vain that some of the brethren (for here, as in all other popular factions, there was a more moderate party, who were dragged forward and hustled into excesses by the more violent) entreated him to ex plain the causes of his offence, and declared their anxiety for an agreement. \" As to agreement,\" said 1 Spottiswood, pp. 418, 419."], [256, "232 1596.

The Queen of England, he said, was an atheist; the religion professed in that kingdom nothing better than an empty sIioav, guided by the injunctions of the bishops ; and not content Avith this pageant at home, they Avere noAv persuading 1 Spottiswood, p. 41 9."], [257, "1596.

But Avhat could they look for? Was not Satan the head of both Court and Council ? Were not all Kings devil's bairns ? Was not Satan in the Court, in the guiders of the Court, in the head of the Court ? Were not the Lords of Session mis creants and bribers, the nobility cormorants, and the Queen of Scotland a woman whom, for fashion's sake, they might pray for, but in AAThose time it Avas vain to hope for good ? x This insolent attack Avas folloAAred, as might have been expected,by an indignant complaint of BoAvesthe Eng lish Ambassador ; and the offender was immediately cited to appear before the Privy Council. To obey this summons, hoAvever, Avould have been construed into an abandonment of the highest privileges of the Kirk; and Black at once declined the jurisdiction of the tribunal. His \" Declinator\" is an extraordinary paper ; and by the high tone which it assumed, fully justified all the apprehensions of the King. \"Albeit,\" said he, address ing the King and Council, \"I am ready, by the assis tance of the grace of God, to give a confession, and to stand to the defence of every point of the truth of God, uttered by me, either by opening up of this Avord, or application thereof, before your Majesty or Council ; * * yet, seeing I am brought at this 1 MS.

And now, seeing it is thepreaching of the Word where on I am accused, which is a principal point of my"], [259, "1596. 235 JAMES VI. calling, of necessity the prophets must first declare Avhether I have kept the bounds of my direction, be fore I come to be judged of your Majesty: which being done, and I found culpable in transgressing any point of that commission Avhich the Lord has given me, I refuse not to abide your Majesty's judgment in the second instance, and to underly whatsoever punishment it shall be found I have deserved. \" Secondly, because the liberty of the Kirk, and the whole discipline thereof, according as the same has been, and is presently exercised within your Majesty's realm, has been confirmed by divers Acts of Parlia ment, and approved in the Confession of Faith, by the subscription and acts of your Majesty, and of your Majesty's estate and the whole body of the country, and peaceably enjoyed by the office-bearers of theKirk in all points, and namely in the foresaid point, anent the judicatory of the preaching of the Word inprima instantia, as the practice of late examples evidently will show : therefore, the question concerning my preaching, ought, first, according to the grounds and practice aforesaid, to be judged by the ecclesiastical senate.\"1 * * * This resolute refusal to submit himself to the judgment of the law, greatly enraged the King, and convinced him that the time was come to make a stand against the exorbitant claims of the Kirk. It confirmed him, also, in his resolution to extend his favour to the Catholic earls, upon their due sub mission ; and at all hazards to put down that spirit of 1 MS. St. P.

Having understood, therefore, that a copy of Mr Black's declinator had been sent by the Com missioners of the Kirk to the A^arious Presbyteries throughout the kingdom for their signature, with letters commending the cause to their assistance and prayers, James at once construed this into an act of mutiny ; and by a public Proclamation not only dis charged the Commissioners from holding anv farther meetings, but commanded them to leave the capital and repair within tAventy-four hours to their flocks.1 But this royal order they Avere in no temper to obey. They instantly convened, and, in the phrase used by their own historian, \"laid their letters open before the Lord.\"2 The danger, they declared, was im minent; and the ministers of the city must instantly, in their pulpits, deal mightily Avith the poAver of the Word against the charge which commanded them to desert their duty. As the spiritual jurisdiction floAved immediately from Christ, and could in no way proceed from a King or civil magistrate : so also the power to convene for the exercise of such jurisdiction came directly from Christ, and could neither be im peded nor controlled by any Christian Prince. They declared, therefore, that they Avould not obey the pro clamation, but remain together to watch OArer the safety of Christ's Church, noAV in extreme jeopardy ; and sent an angry message to the \" OctaA'ians,\" the eight councillors Avho then managed the Government, 1 Calderwood, p. 341. 2 Ibid."], [261, "1596. 237 JAMES VI. assuring them, that as the Kirk had been in peace and liberty on their coming to office and Avas iioav plunged into the greatest troubles, they could not but hold them responsible for the late bitter attacks upon its privileges. This accusation Avas indignantly repelled by Seton the President of the Session ; and from him the Commis sioners of the Kirk repaired to the King ; Avho assured them, Avith greater mildness than some had expected, that if Black would withdrawhis \"Declinator\" all could be Avell arranged: a proposal which the more moderate party in the Kirk anxiously advised to be adopted. \"At this moment,\"theysaid, \"theCourt stands in some awe of the Kirk ; and our Avisest plan is to make the best conditions Ave can. If Ave measure our strength with the King, Ave shall be found too Aveak, and may lose the ground we have gained.\" But others, more fierce and zealous, arraigned such counsels as Eras tian, and worldly wise. To renounce the least of their privileges would, they argued, be the sure way to lose them all : to stand to their ground the only Avay to prevail. It was God's cause ; and He Avho had the hearts of Princes in His hand Avould maintain it.1 These counsels prevailed. The monarch, irritated by the rejection of his offer, commanded the trial of Black to proceed. So anxious, koAvever, was he to avoid extremities, that after the Judges had pro nounced their opinion that the matters charged against him amounted, if proved, to treason, and were Avithin the jurisdiction of the King and Council, he 1 Calderwood, pp. 340, 341. Spottiswood, p. 423."], [262, "1596. 238 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. deferred the trial till next day ; and in the interval sent for some of the ministers, Avith the hope that, even at this latest hour, some mutual concessions might lead to peace. It had been reported to him, he said, that they Avere in terror lest their spiritual jurisdiction should be invaded ; but nothing could be farther from his mind than any abridgment of the liberties of the Kirk ; and he was ready, by a public declaration on this point, to quiet their minds. \"But,\" he continued, \" this licentious manner of discoursing of affairs of State in the pulpit cannot be tolerated. My claim is only to judge in matters of sedition, and other civil and criminal causes, and of speeches that may import such crimes, wheresoever they may be uttered \u2014 in the pulpit or elsewhere : for surely, if treason and sedition be crimes, much more are they so if committed in the pulpit, Avhere the Word of Truth alone should be taught and heard.\" To this some of the ministers replied, that they did not plead for the privilege of place, but for respect due to their message, Avhich was received from God, and far above the control of any civil judicature. \"Most true,\" said James ; \" and would you keep to your message, there would and could be no strife. But I trust your messaege be not to rule Estates, and, Avhen matters dislike you, to stir the people to sedition, making both me and my councillors odious by your railings.\" \u2014 \" If any dare do so,\" said the champion of the Kirk, \" and have passed the bounds, it is reason he be pun ished Avith all extremity ; but this question of his having past the bounds must be judged by the"], [263, "1596. 239 JAMES VI. Church.\" \u2014 \" And shall not I,\" said the King, with some asperity, \" have power to call and punish a minister that breaketh out in treasonable speeches, but must come to your Presbytery and be a corn plainer ? I have had good proof already Avhat justice ye will do me ; and were this a doubtful case, where by any colour the speeches might be justified, there might be some excuse for saying the minister should be convicted b}7 his brethren ; but here, what says Mr Black ? ' All Kings are devil's bairns ; the treachery of the King's heart is discovered.' Who sees not that this man hath passed his bounds ? Who will say he hath kept to his message ? \" It was easier to demur to this than to answer it ; and so convinced were the ministers at the moment of the reasonableness of the King's desires, that after much conference and cavilling, they agreed to with draw from the contest, till the limits between the civil and spiritual jurisdictions should be discussed and decided in a lawful General Assembly. On his side, also, James relaxed in the rigour of his requisi tions. He was content, he said, that Black should be brought to his presence ; and on his admission or denial of the truth of the accusations, be judged by three of his own brethren, Mr David Lindsay, Mr James Nicolson, and Mr Thomas Buchanan. Matters Avere now on the very eve of an amicable adjustment, Avhen it was unfortunately suggested to the King, that by this mode of settlement he would compromise his dignity, and that of his Consort, unless Mr Black first acknowledged his offence against the Queen."], [264, "240 1596. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. From such a proceeding the indignant minister re volted. He would plead to no offence, he said ; for he was guilty of none. The Court, before whom he had been tried, had evinced the most shameless in justice ; had refused the most unexceptionable Avit nesses, Avho Avould have amply proved his innocence. Provost, bailies, rectors, deans, principals, and regents of colleges, had been ready to testify in his favour ; and the judges had admitted in their place the evi dence of ignorant and partial persons, whom it Avas impossible to believe. Come Avhat might, he Avould never plead before a Civil tribunal for an alleged Spiritual delinquency ; but if the monarch chose to remit him to his lawful judge, the ecclesiastical senate, he Avould declare the truth ; and, if found guilty, cheerfully submit to its censure.1 This second declinature enraged the King even more than the first ; and having summoned his Council, he commanded the trial to proceed ; but no prisoner appeared. The depositions of the Avitnesses wrere then read ; and Black, in absence, Avas found guilty of having falsely and treasonably slandered the King, the Queen his royal Consort, his neighbour Princess the Queen of England, and the Lords of Council and Ses sion. It was left to the King to name the due punish ment for such offences ; but till the royal pleasure Avere knoAvn, he Avas sentenced to be confined beyond the North Water, and within six days to enter his person in Avard.2 Yet although armed by this sentence, 1 Calderwood, p. 351. Spottiswood, p. 425. 2 Id. 427."], [265, "1596. 241 JAMES VI. and holding the sword of the civil power over the heads of the guilty, James arrested its descent, and to the last showed an anxiety for a compromise. The punishment of Black, he said, should be of the light est kind ; and no ministers should be called before the Privy Council till it had been found in a General Assembly that the King might judge whether they passed the bounds in doctrine. Meanwhile, the acts of Council so obnoxious to the brethren should be de leted, the offensive proclamations amended, and every reasonable safeguard provided against the alleged encroachments upon the liberties of the Kirk. Theseamicable feelings Avere unfortunately construed rather into an admission of weakness than a desire for peace; and the Commissioners of the Kirk, sternly re fusing to abate an atom of their demands, declared that no punishment could be inflicted on a man who had not yet been tried. On the other hand, it was urged by Seton, President of the Session, and one of the Octa vians, that unless some punishment followed the sentence pronounced upon Black, the King could never make that process a good ground for claiming the jurisdiction over the ministers. The two anta gonists therefore, the Kirk and the CroAvn, found themselves, after these protracted overtures, more mortally opposed to each other than before. The Kirk, protesting that every effort had failed to obtain redress for the wrongs offered to Christ's kingdom, proclaimed a Fast ; commanded all faithful pastors to betake themselves to their spiritual armour ; caused \" the Doctrine,\" to use the phrase of these times, \" to VOL. IX. R"], [266, "1596. 242 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. sound mightily;\" and protested that, whatever might be the consequences, they were free of his Majesty's blood.1 The King received this announcement Avith the ut- \u00a9 most scorn ; commanded the Commissioners instantly to depart the city ; ordered Black to enter into Avard ; and published a Declaration, in which he exposed, in forcible and indignant terms, the unreasonable demands of the Kirk. Out of an earnest desire, he said, to keep peace Avith the ministers, he had agreed to waive all inquiry into \"past causes,\" till the unhappy differences between the civil and ecclesiastical tribunal had been removed by the judgment of a Convention of Estates and a General Assembly of the ministry. All that he had asked in return Avas, that his pro ceedings should not be made a subject of pulpit at tack and bitter ecclesiastical railing : instead of listening to which request, they had vilified him in their sermons, accused him of persecution, defended Black, and falsely held him up to his people as the enemy of all godliness. In the face of all such slander and defamation, he noAv declared to his good subjects, that as it was his determination on the one hand to maintain religion and the discipline of the Church as established by law, so on the other he was resolved to enforce upon all his people, ministers of the Kirk as well as others, that obedience to the laws and reverence for the throne, without which no Chris tian kingdom could hold together. For this purpose certain Bonds Avere in preparation, which the ministers 1 Calderwood, pp. 356, 360. Spottiswood, p. 426."], [267, "1596, 243 JAMES VI. should be required to subscribe under the penalty of a sequestration of their property. ' Meanwhile, the Commissioners having retired from the city, a short breathing time Avas allowed ; and Secretary Lindsay, trusting that the ministers of Edinburgh might now be more tractable than their brethren, prevailed on the King to send for them. As a preliminary to all accommodation, they insisted that the Commissioners should be recalled ; and the King, relaxing in his rigour, appeared on the point of acceding to their Avishes, Avhen some of the \" Cubiculars\" as the lords of the bed-chamber and gentlemen of the household were called, interposed their ill offices to prevent an agreement. These ambitious and intriguing men had long envied and hated the Octavians, and had hoped, under colour of the recent dissensions in the Church, to procure their disgrace and dismissal. Nothing could be more unfavourable to such a plot than peace between the King and the Kirk : nothing more essential to its success than to fan the flame and stir the elements of discord. This they noAv set about with diabolical ingenuity. They laboured to make the Octavians odious to the party of the Protestant barons and the ministers. They assured them, that all the hot per secution of Mr Black arose from this hydra-headed creAV, of Avhom they knew the leaders to be Papists. They insinuated to the Octavians that the animosity of their enemies in the Kirk was so implacable as to throAV their lives into jeopardy ; and they abused the 1 Spottiswood, p, 426."], [268, "1596. 244 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. King's ear, to whom their office gave them unlimited access, by tales against the citizens of Edinburgh ; Avho mounted guard every night, as they affirmed, over the houses of their ministers, lest their lives should fall a sacrifice to the unmitigable rage of their sovereign. By these abominable artifices, the single end of which Avas to destroy the government of the Octa vians, the hopes of peace were entirely blasted ; and the little lull which had succeeded the retirement of the Commissioners was followed by a more terrific tempest than had yet occurred. The King, incensed at the conduct of the citizens and the suspicion which it implied, commanded tAventy-four of the most zealous burgesses to leave the capital within six hours ; a proceeding which enraged the ministers, whose in dignation blazed to the highest pitch Avhen they received an anonymous letter, assuring them that Huntly had been that night closeted with James. The information Avas false, and turned out to be an artifice of the \" Cubiculars \" ; but it had the effect intended, for all was now terror in the Kirk. Bal canquel flew to the pulpit ; and after a general dis course on some text of the Canticles, plunged into the present troubles of the Kirk, arraigned the \" treacherous forms \" of which they had been made the victims; and turning to the noblemen and barons Avho Avere his auditors, reminded them, in glowing language, of the deeds of their ancestors in defence of the truth : exhorting them not to disgrace their fathers, but to meet the ministers forthwith in"], [269, "1596. JAMES VI. 245 the Little Church. To this quarter so great a croAvd iioav rushed, that the clergy could not make their entrance ; but Mr Robert Bruce, pressing forward, at last reached the table Avhere the Protestant barons Avere seated, and warning them of the imminent perils which hung over their heads, the return of the Papist earls, the persecution of Black, the banishment of the Commissioners and the citizens, conjured them to bestir themselves and intercede with the King.1 For this purpose, Lords Lindsay and Forbes, Avith the Lairds of Barganie and Balquhan, and the tAvo ministers, Bruce and Watson, sought the royal pre sence, then not far off; for the King Avas at that moment sitting in the Upper Tolbooth with some of his Privy Council, Avhile the Judges of the Session Avere assembled in the LoAver House. On being ad mitted Avith the rest, Bruce informed the monarch that they were sent by the noblemen and barons then convened, to bemoan and avert the dangers threatened to religion. \"What dangers?\" said James. \"I see none ; and Avho dares convene, con trary to my proclamation ? \" \u2014 \" Dares ! \" retorted the fierce Lord Lindsay. \" We dare more than that; and shall not suffer the Truth to be over thrown, and stand tamely by.\" As he said this the clamour increased ; numbers Avere thronging unman nerly into the presence-chamber, and the King, starting up in alarm, and Avithout giving any ansAver, retreated down stairs to the LoAver House, where the Judges were assembled, and commanded the 1 Spottiswood, p. 427."], [270, "246 1596. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. doors to be shut. The Protestant lords and minis ters upon this returned to the little Kirk, where the multitude had been addressed during their absence by Mr Michael Cranston, who had read to them the history of Haman and Mordecai. This story had Avorked them up to a point that prepared them for any mischief ; and when they heard that the King had turned his back upon their messengers, they became furious Avith rage and disappointment. Some, dreading the Avorst, desired to separate ; but Lind say's lion voice AAras heard above the clamour, for bidding them to disperse. Shouts now arose, to force the doors and bring out the Avicked Haman ; others cried out \" The SAVord of the Lord and of Gideon ;\" and in the midst of the confusion, an agent of the courtiers, or, as Calderwood terms him, \" a messen ger of Satan sent by the Cubiculars,\" A-ociferated \" Armour, armour ! save yourselves. Fy, fy ! bills and axes ! \" The people now rose in arms ; some rushing one way, some another ; some, thinking the King Avas laid hands on, ran to the Tolbooth ; some, believing that their ministers were being butchered, flew to the Kirk ; others thundered Avith their axes and AAreapons on the Tolbooth doors ; calling for Pre sident Seton, Mr Elphinston, and Mr Thomas Ha milton, to be given up to them, that they might take order with them as abusers of the King and the Kirk. At this moment, had not a braA7e deacon of the craftsmen, named Wat, Avith a small guard, beat them back, the gate would have been forced, and none could have answered for the consequences. But"], [271, "1596. 247 JAMES VI. at last the provost, Sir Alexander Hume, Avhom the shouts of the uproar had reached as he lay on a sick bed, seizing his sword, rushed in, all haggard and pale, amongst the citizens, and with difficulty ap peased them into a temporary calm. James, Avho Avas greatly alarmed, now sent the Earl of Mar to remonstrate with the ministers, AAThom he found pacing up and down, disconso lately, behind the church, lamenting the tumult, and excusing their oavii part. On being remonstrated with by Mar, all that they required, they said, was the abolition of the acts done in prejudice of the Kirk during the last four weeks ; that the Presi dent, Comptroller, and Advocate, men suspected in religion, and enemies to the truth, should have no voice in ecclesiastical matters ; and that the good citi zens who had been banished, should be recalled. These demands being reported, the monarch promised to lay them, Avhen put into proper form, before his Council ; and seizing the moment of tranquillity, ventured to open the doors of the Lower Tolbooth, and accompanied by the provost, bailies, and Octa vians, slipt quietly into the street, and proceeded to his palace at Holyrood. Here at last there was safety ; and his courage reviving, James expressed himself Avith the utmost indignation against the ministers and leaders of \u00a9 \u00a9 the late tumult; vowing that they, the toAvn, the barons, and every living soul connected with the re cent disgraceful scenes, should bitterly repent them. These sentiments Avere encouraged by the councillors ;"], [272, "1596. 248 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and next morning the King and his whole Court, at an early hour, left the city for Linlithgow. Scarcely had they departed, when a Herald appearing at the Cross, read a proclamation Avhich struck dismay into the hearts of the people. It described the treason able uproar of the preceding day, which had been raised by the factious ministers of Edinburgh, Avho, it stated, after having uttered most seditious speeches in pulpit, had assembled with the noblemen, barons, and others ; had sent an irreverent message to their sovereign, persuaded the citizens to take arms, and put his Majesty's life in jeopardy. Such treasonable conduct, it declared, had convinced the King that the capital Avas no longer a fit place for his OAvn resi dence, or for the ministration of justice ; he had therefore himself left it with his Court, and noAv commanded the Lords of Session, Sheriffs, and all other officers of justice, to remove themselves forth of the town of Edinburgh, and be ready to repair to such other place as should be appointed. At the same time he ordered all noblemen and barons to depart instantly to their oavii houses, and to forbear any further assembly till they had received the royal permission.1 This proclamation had an immediate effect, and caused a great alteration. Men looked sadly and despondingly on each other. The craftsmen and burgesses foretold the utter decay of their town and trade. All seemed in despair : but nothing could intimidate the Kirkmen ; and Mr Robert Bruce, one 1 Spottiswood, p. 429-430."], [273, "1596. 249 JAMES VI. of their principal leaders, ascending the pulpit, up braided them Avith their pusillanimity. \" A day,\" said he, \" a day of trial and terror is at hand.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Meanwhile, a Fast Avas proclaimed ; and Mr John Welsh, one of the ministers, thundered from one of the city pulpits an extraordinary philippic against the King ; taking for his general subject the epistle sent to the angel of the Church at Ephesus. His Majesty, he said, had been possessed with a devil ; and one devil having been put out, seven worse spirits Avere entered in his place. He was, in fact, in a state of frenzy; and it Avas laAvful for the subjects to rise against him, and take the sword out of his hand ; just as a father of a family, if visited with insanity, might be seized by his children and servants and tied hand and foot. An execrable doctrine, justly observes SpottisAvood, which was yet received by many of the hearers as a sound application. This insolent attack Was scarcely made, when Lord Hamilton, Avho had at first received the messenger of the Kirk Avith courtesy, suddenly rode to Linlithgow, and put into the King's hands the letter addressed him by the ministers. It Avas construed into a direct incitement to rebellion: and certainly its terms Avent far that Avay. Ad dressing themselves to this nobleman, the brethren presumed, they said, that his Lordship Avas aAvare of the long conference betAveen his Majesty and them ; many concurrings, and as many breaks, in Avhich, at last, the malice of some councillors had come to this, that their stipends were discharged; the Commis sioners of the General Assembly banished ; Mr David Black competed of treason and warded ; themselves appointed to suffer the like ; and now, at last, a great"], [275, "1596. 251 JAMES VI. number of their flock, Avho had stood in their defence, expelled from the town. They proceeded to state that the people, in this crisis, animated, no doubt, by the Word of God's spirit, took arms ; and, unless restrained by their ministers, Avould, in their fury, have lighted upon many of the councillors, Avho Avere threatening destruction, as they believed, to religion and Government. The letter stated that the godly barons, with other gentlemen who were in the town, had convened themselves ; they had taken upon them the patronicy of the Kirk and her cause ; but they lacked a head, and specially a nobleman to countenance the matter, and with one consent had made choice of Lord Hamilton. \" And seeing,\" so the ministers concluded their inflammatory epistle, \"God has given your Lordship this honour, Ave could do no less than to follow His calling, and make it knoAvn to you, that with all com^enient diligence you might come here, utter your affection to the good cause, and receive the honour Avhich is offered you.\"1 This letter Avas subscribed by the leading min isters of the Kirk; Bruce, Balcanquel, Rollock, Balfour, and Watson : but the great nobleman to Avhom it Avas addressed, resisted the dangerous preeminence, and highly offended the Kirk by now placing it in the King's hands, who Avas not slow to take advantage of the discovery. In truth, the tumult recently committed by the citizens, and the part which had been acted in it by the clergy, 1 Warrender MSS., vol. B., p. 246."], [276, "252 1596. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Avas a prodigious advantage given to the monarch ; Avho quickly perceived it. He was well aAvare of the difficulty of dealing Avith the ministers, as long as they confined themselves to their political attacks in the pulpit, and pleaded an independent jurisdiction ; but the citizens and bailies were un questionably amenable to the authority of the Crown and the laws. They were, with scarcely a single exception, Protestants ; warmly attached to the Kirk, and a principal element in its poAver. All this the King knew ; and Avhen he saAV that he had them Avithin his grasp, he determined they should feel the full Aveight of his resentment. It Avas in Arain that the citizens sought to appease the royal wrath, and despatched the humblest messages to implore its removal, and invite their sovereign back to his capital. The envoys were refused access; the provost was commanded to imprison the ministers, Avho Avere accused of having instigated a tumult AAThich had \u00a9 \u00a9 endangered the life of their prince ; the outrage was declared treason by an act of Council ; the capital Avas pronounced unsafe ; the nobility and gentry interdicted from resorting thither; the inferior j udi catories and the Supreme Court removed ; and the ominous ansAver returned by the King to the citizens, that he meant ere long to come to Edinburgh, in \u00a9 \u00a9 ' person, and let them knoAV that he Avas their sove reign. To enforce this, James summoned his Highland no bles Avith their fierce attendants, and his Border barons with their lawless followers. Dark surmises ran"], [277, "1596. 253 JAMES VI. through the Court, and soon reached the startled ears of the toAvnsmen, that their city Avas doomed to indiscri minate pillage; it Avas to be sacked, perhaps razed, and sown Avith salt. Will of Kinmont, it Avas said, Avas to be let loose upon it ; and his name, always formidable, and noAv more notorious from his recent escape, struck terror into the hearts of the burghers. It was in vain that the ministers attempted to rally the courage of their flocks, spoke of excommunicating their ene mies in the Council, and dreAv up a bond for the defence of religion. The magistrates refused to sub scribe it ; the craftsmen, torn between their love of gain and their deArotion to sound doctrine, began to look coldly and doubtfully upon their pastors ; and the four clergymen, Avho had taken the most active part in the tumult, dreading an arrest, fled by night to NeAvcastle.1 But these were not the days when the artisans and merchants of a feudal capital Avere subjects of easy plunder. All had arms, and kneAv Avell how to use them; and the shops, booths, and Avarehouses, Avere soon emptied of their goods, which were stoAved away in the strongest houses of the toAvn.

As to the in flammatory sermons, and the conduct of their minis ters who had been recently outlawed, they should, they said, never be re-admitted to their charge with out the permission of the King; and at the next election of the civic authorities, such persons only should be chosen as had previously been approved of by the Crown.1 James then proceeded to the High Church, heard a sermon from Mr David Lindsay, and made an oration to the people, in which he justified himself, cleared his councillors, and deeply blamed the ministers.2 He spoke of his own early education in the reformed religion; his solemn determination to maintain it ; to extirpate from his realm all unre pentant idolaters, and to provide for the preaching of God's Word, Avhich had been silent in the capital since the flight of those unAvorthy pastors who had profaned the pulpits by their seditious harangues. Having thus somewhat reassured the trembling citi- \u00a9 \u00a9 zens, he deemed that he had gone far enough for the present ; and not only declined accepting their offers of submission, but at a succeeding Convention of Estates, held at Holyrood, anew declared the tumult to be treason, intimated his resolution to prosecute the toAvn criminally, and commanded the provost 1 Maitland, vol. ii., p. 1278. 2 MS.

This was nothing less than the establishment of Episcopacy. The recent excesses of the more vio lent ministers had made the deepest impression upon the monarch ; and it was evident to him, that if the principles of independent jurisdiction Avhich they had not hesitated to adopt, were preached and acted upon, there must ensue a perpetual collision between the ecclesiastical and civil authorities. He longed, therefore, to use the words of SpottisAvood, to see \" a decent order established in the Kirk, which should be consistent with the Word of God, the custom of primitive times, and the laAvs of the realm ;\" and he believed that no fitter moment could occur to carry this great object than the present. His first step was to summon a General Assembly of the Church to meet at Perth on the last of February. His next was an act of conciliation. The eight councillors who, under the name of Octavians, had, for the last eighteen months, managed the financial department of the State, and indirectly controlled 1 Spottiswood, p. 433."], [280, "1596-7. 256 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. every part of the Government, had been especially obnoxious to the Protestant clergy, and to a section of the courtiers and bed-chamber lords. They were hated by the ministers, who suspected them to be mostly concealed Roman Catholics; by the Cubiculars, as the courtiers were called, because they had curtailed their perquisites, and introduced a strict economy; and the King, by accepting their resignations, believed that he Avould popularize his intended ecclesiastical inno vations.1 These changes he noAv prefaced by drawing up and circulating amongst the different Synods and Presbyteries, no less than fifty-five questions, involv ing the most important points in dispute between himself and his clergy ; not, as he solemnly declared, for the purpose of troubling the peace of the Kirk by thorny disputes, but to have its polity cleared, its corruptions eradicated, and a pleasant harmony es tablished between himself and its ministers.2 The spirit and tendency of these questions gave great alarm to the brethren. The King inquired whether matters of external ecclesiastical regimen might not be disputed, salvd fide et rcligione ; Avhether the Prince by himself, or the pastors by themselves, or both conjunctly, should establish the Acts concerning the government of the Kirk ; Avhether the consent of a majority of the flock, and also of the patron, was necessary in the election of pastors ; Avhether there could be a lawful minister, Avithout impositio manuum; 1 MS.

Avhether pastors should be permitted to allude by name to councillors and magistrates in the pulpit, or to describe them so minutely as to leave no doubt Avhom they meant, although the parties so attacked Avere guiltless of notorious vices, and had not been previously admonished; whether the pastor should be confined to the doctrine directly flowing from his text, or might preach all things on all texts ; whether the General Assembly of the Kirk might be convoked Avithout consent of the Prince, he being plus et Chris tianus Magistratus ; whether it were lawful to ex communicate such Papists as had never professed the reformed faith ; whether a Christian Prince had power to annul a notoriously-unjust sentence of ex communication, and to amend such disorders as might occur either by pastors failing in their duties, or by one jurisdiction usurping the province of another ; whether Fasts for general causes might be proclaimed without the command of the Prince ; Avhether any causes infringing upon the civil jurisdiction, or inter fering with vested private rights, might be disputed and ruled in the ecclesiastical courts ; and Avhether the civil magistrate had not a full right to stay all such proceedings ? x These searching interrogatories were received with \u00a9 \u00a9 no inconsiderable dismay by the clergy. They took great offence that their forms of ecclesiastical polity, Avhich they considered irreversibly fixed by Act of Parliament, and founded, as they contended, on the Word of God, which had been so highly eulogized also 1 Spottiswood, pp. 455, 436. VOL. IX. s"], [282, "1596-7. 258 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. by the King in 1592, should be called in question. They saw how acutely the questions had been drawn up ; how deeply they touched the independence of the Kirk ; what a total revolution and alienation the late excesses of the ministers had occasioned in the mind of the sovereign, and how earnest and determined he seemed in the whole matter. All this demanded instant vigilance and resis tance. Many private conferences were held ; and in the end of February the brethren of the Synod of Fife convened at St Andrews ; where, after \" tossing of the King's questions for sundry days,\" they drew up their replies, which, as was to be expected, ruled everything in favour of the Kirk, and resisted every claim on the part of the King. Some of these answers are remarkable, and seem to show that the principles then laid doAvn were incompatible with the existence of civil government. Thus, the first question, Whether matters concerning the external government of the Kirk might not be debated salvdfide et relioione f was met by a peremptory negative ; on the second, they were equally positive that the King had no voice in the discussion or establishment of any acts relating to Church government. All the Acts of the Kirk (so was their response worded) ought to be estab lished by the Word of God. Of this Word the ordi nary interpreters were the pastors and doctors of the Kirk ; the extraordinary expounders, such as were called for in times of corruption, were the prophets, or such men as were endowed by God with extraordinary gifts ; and kings and princes had nothing to do but"], [283, "1596-7. 259 JAMES VI. to ratify and vindicate, by their civil sanctions, that Avhich these pastors and prophets had authoritatively declared.1 As to the indecent and scurrilous practice of inveighing against particular men and councillors by name in the pulpit, they defended its adoption by what they termed apostolic authority. \" The canon,\" said they, \" of the Apostle is clear : ' They that sin publicly, rebuke publicly, that the rest may fear ;' \" and so much the more if the public sin be in a public person. On other points they were equally clear and decided in favour of their own practices and preten sions. All things, they contended, might be spoken on all texts ; and if the minister travelled from his subject, he was only following the express directions of Paul to Timothy. The General Assembly might be convened without the authority of the King, be cause the officers of the Kirk received their place and Avarrant directly from Christ, and not from any tem poral Prince ; and the acts passed in that Assembly Avere undoubtedly valid, although carried against the royal will. On this question their reasoning was ex traordinary : \" The King (they contended) should consent to, and give a legal sanction to all acts passed in the Assembly ; and why ? Because the acts of the Assembly have sufficient authority from Christ ; who has promised, that whatever shall be agreed upon on earth by two or three convened in his name, shall be ratified in heaven; a warrant to which no temporal King or Prince can lay claim : and so,\" it continues, \" the acts and constitutions of 1 Calderwood, pp. 382, 383."], [284, "260 1596-7. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the Kirk are of higher authority than those of any earthly king; yea, they should command and over rule kings, Avhose greatest honour should be to be members, nursing fathers and servants to this King- Christ Jesus, and his House and Queen the Kirk.\" 1 To pursue the ansv/ers is unnecessary, enough having been given to shoAV their general tendency. But the courage of the Synod of Fife, by wham these stout re plies Avere drawn up, did not pervade the Avhole body of the Kirk ; and the King, who managed the affair with his usual acuteness and dexterity, succeeded in procur ing a majority in the General Assembly, and ultimately carrying his oavii views. This James appears to have effected by holding out hopes of preferment to those Avho were Avavering, and packing the General Assembly with a large majority of north-country ministers, who Avere generally esteemed more lukeAvarm Presbyterians and more devoted cour tiers than their loAvland brethren. Sir Patrick Murray, a gentleman of the bed-chamber, had been sent for this purpose into the North ; and Avas so successful in his mission, that when the Assembly met at Perth, the King found them in a more placable and conciliatory mood than could have been anticipated. It was de clared, after some sharp discussion, a lawful Assem bly ; having power, not only to debate, but to con clude such questions as should be brought before them. The royal Commissioners, Sir John Cockburn, Sir John Preston, and Mr Edward Bruce, then 1 Calderwood, p. 386."], [285, "261 1596-7. JAMES VI. presented thirteen Articles, which embraced the principal points of dispute already included by the King in his original Queries ; and a Committee of the Assembly having been chosen to consider them, they gave in, next morning, a series of answers, which James pronounced unsatisfactory, and requested the members of Assembly to meet the Estates for the purpose of a more full discussion. When they ap peared, he observed that they must be Avell aware of the object for which he had desired their attendance. \" My purpose,\" said he, \" in calling you together is to amend such things as are amiss, and to take away the questions that may move trouble afterwards. If you, for your parts, be willing to have matters righted, things may yet go well. I claim nothing but what is due to every Christian King ; that is, to be Custos et Vinde\u00e6 Disciplin\u0153. Corruptions are crept in, and more are daily groAving, by this liberty that preachers take in the application of their doctrine, and censuring everything that is not to their mind. This I must have amended ; for such discourses serve only to move sedition, and raise tumults. Let the Truth of God be taught in the Chair of Truth, and Avickedness be reprobated ; but in such sort as the offender may be bettered, and vice made more odious. To rail against men in pulpit, and express their names, as we know Avas done of late, there being no j ust cause ; and to make the Word of God, Avhich is ordained to guide men in the way of salvation, an instrument of sedition; is a sin, I am sure, beyond all other that can be committed on earth Hold you"], [286, "1596-7. 262 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. within your limits, and I will never blame you, nor suffer others to work you any vexation. The civil government is committed to me. It is not your subject ; nor are ye to meddle with it.\" x This peremptory mode of address overawed the As sembly; and after protesting that they had convened in that place only to evince their obedience to the sove reign, and in no wise consenting to submit matters ecclesiastical to a civil judicatory, they Avithdrew to their ordinary place of meeting, and prepared their amended answers ; with which the King declared him self satisfied for the present. And he had good reason to be so ; for he had already gained some principal points. It was agreed that the monarch, either by himself or his Commissioners, might propose to the General Assembly any reformation or amendment in ecclesiastical matters connected Avith the external government of the Kirk ; that no unusual conventions should be held amongst pastors without the royal consent ; that the acts of the Privy Council, or the lawrs passed by the three Estates, should not be attacked or discussed in the pulpit, Avithout remedy having been first sought from the King ; that in the principal towns of the realm no minister should be chosen without consent of the King, and of the flock ; and that no man should be by name rebuked in the pulpit, unless he had fled from justice, or were under sentence of excommunication.2 James' next step was to reconcile the Catholic lords to the Kirk ; and he was here equally success- 1 Spottiswood, p. 440. 2 Id. p. 441."], [287, "1597. 263 JAMES VI. ful. He had already written a peremptory letter to Huntly, informing him that the time Avas come when he must either embrace the Protestant faith, remain in Scotland, and be restored to his honours and his estates ; or leave his country for ever, if, as the King expressed it in his letter, his conscience Avere so \"kittle\"1 as to refuse these conditions; in which case James added, \" Look never to be a Scotsman again ! \" The letter concluded with these solemn Avords : \u2014 \" Deceive not yourself, to think that by lingering of time, your wife and your allies shall ever get you better conditions. I must love myself and my OAvn estate better than all the world ; and think not that I will suffer any professing a contrary religion to dAvell in this land.\"2 The conditions presented to Huntly, Angus, and Errol, Avere, that after conference with the Presby terian ministers, who should be careful to instruct them in the Truth, they should acknowledge the Kirk of Scotland to be a true Church, become members of it, hear the Word, receive the sacraments, and be obe dient to its discipline ; and that they should banish all Jesuits and seminary priests from their com pany and estates, and subscribe the Confession of Faith. On the meeting of the General Assembly at Dundee, (10th May, 1597,) the brethren Avho had 1 i. e., So ticklish or tender. 2 Original in the King's hand, Warrender MSS., vol. A., p. 169.

But, at the very moment of reconciliation, it was found that Mr James Gordon, a Jesuit, had glided in disguise into the country of Huntly, and was busy in shaking his resolution; whilst a daring Catholic baron, named Barclay of Ladyland, seized and fortified Ailsa, a small island in the shape of a huge, rugged rock, off the coast of Ayr, with the design of delivering it to the Spaniards, Avho had promised to make a de scent in that quarter. This desperate enterprise Avas defeated by Mr Andrew Knox, minister of Paisley, whose prowess had been shown some five years be fore this, in seizing George Ker with the Spanish Blanks.1 With like success, this devoted member of the Kirk having discovered Barclay's plot, girded on his sword ; and taking boat, Avith a feAV daring assistants, attacked the traitor on his rock, and re duced him to such extremity, that rather than be taken alive he rushed into the sea, and in one mo ment choked both himself and his treason.2 This reverse confirmed the Catholic lords in their convictions; and the ceremony of their re conciliation to the Kirk, and restoration to their 1 Supra, p. 76-77. 9 Spottiswood, p. 445.

As it Avas an event particularly accept able to the King, and considered a great triumph by the Kirk, the proceedings Avere conducted with much solemnity. After a strict Fast, held on Saturday the 25th of June, on Avhich da,y the three earls, Huntly, Angus, and Errol, made up all deadly quarrels, and shook hands with their enemies, mutually imploring and receiving forgiveness; the congregation assem bled on Sunday the 26th, in the old Kirk at Aber deen, which was crowded Avith the noblemen, barons, and common people. In the main aisle was a table for the sacrament of the Lord's Supper; and immediately before the sermon, the three earls rose from their places, and subscribed the Confes sion of Faith. The sermon followed, preached by Mr John Gledstanes; after Avhich the earls rose, and Avith a loud voice made open confession of their late defection and apostacy, professing their present con viction of the truth of the Presbyterian faith, and their resolution to remain steadfast in the same. Huntly then declared before God, his majesty, and the Kirk, his deep penitence for the murder of the Earl of Murray ; after which the three noble delin quents Avere absolved from the sentence of excom munication, and received by the ministers, the royal Commissioner, and the provost and magistrates, into the bosom of the Kirk. A person in the dress of a penitent now threw himself on his knees before the pulpit : it Avas the Laird of Gicht, who implored pardon for his supporting Bothwell, and entreated"], [290, "266 1597. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. to be released from his sentence of excommunication. All this was granted, The repentant earls then re ceived the sacrament after the Presbyterian form; solemnly swore to keep good order in their wide and Avild territories, executing justice, destroying \"bangs ters,\" and showing themselves, in all respects, \" good justiciars;\" and, on the succeeding day, Marchmont Herald proclaimed their reconciliation by sound of trumpet at the Cross, which was hung with tapestry, and surrounded by multitudes, who shouted their joy, drank their healths, and tossed their glasses in the air.1 This success gave strength to the King's govern ment, and encouraged James to go forward Avith his great ecclesiastical project ; but he proceeded with Caution, and took care not to alarm the Kirk by pre maturely disclosing the full extent of his reforms. He had now secured in his interest a large party of the ministers; but the elements of democracy, and the hatred of anything approaching to a hierarchy, Avere still deeply rooted in the General Assem bly, and in the hearts of the people. Mr AndreAV Melvil, Principal of the College of St Andrews, a man singularly learned, ready in debate, sarcastic, audacious, and overbearing, led the popular party, with his nephew, James Melvil, who was warmly attached to the same principles, but of a gentler spirit. Many others assisted them ; and the King, anxious to get rid of their opposition, proposed that, 1 Thomas Mollison to Mr Eobert Paip, Aberdeen, 28th June, 1597.

Fourteen ministers Avere chosen, most of whom were known to be fa vourable to the views of the Court ; and these, whom Calderwood the popular historian of the Kirk stig matizes as the \" King's led horse,\" convened soon after at Falkland, where they summoned before them the Presbytery of St Andrews, and gave a specimen of their new poAver,by reversing a judgment pronounced by the Presbytery of St Andrews, and l-emoving from their charge two ministers named Wallace and Black, who \u00a9 * had profaned their pulpits by personal attack and vitu peration. This was folloAved by a strict and searching visitation of the University of St Andrews, the strong hold of its Rector, Mr AndreAV Melvil ; Avho in his office of Principal had, as the King conceived, been too busy in disseminating amongst the students his favourite principles of ministerial parity and popular power. A new Rector Avas elected ; a certain mode of teaching prescribed to the several professors ; and a more strict economy introduced into the disposal of the rents of the University, by the appointment of a financial council. During the summer and autumn, James Avas busily occupied Avith the trial of Avitches, and an expedition 1 Calderwood, p. 409."], [292, "268 1597. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. to the Borders ; in Avhich last he acted with great energy. Fourteen of the most notorious offenders were taken and hanged ; thirty-six of the principal barons, Avho had encouraged their outrages, seized and brought prisoners to the capital ; and Lord Ochiltree left as Lieutenant and Warden over the disturbed districts. Parliament noAv assembled, and opened Avith some proceedings on the part of the King, Avhich showed an alienation from England. In an oration to his nobility, he dAvelt on the Avrongs he had received in the execution of his mother ; the in terruption in the payment of his gratuity ; the scorn ful answers returned to his temperate remonstrance ; the unjust imputations of Elizabeth, Avho accused him of exciting Poland and Denmark against her, and fos tering rebellion in Ireland. But what had most deeply offended him, was the attempt made recently in the English Parliament to defeat his title to the throne of that kingdom ; a subject upon which, owing to the daily reports of the shattered health of the Queen, he had become more keenly sensitive than ever.1 Against all this it was evident he now resolved to be timely on his guard ; but, in the meantime, his mind Avas full of that great plan Avhich had so long occu pied it : the establishment of the order of Bishops. For this all was now ripe ; and Avhen the Commis sioners of the Kirk laid their petition before Parlia ment, one of its requisitions was found to be as follows: \" That the ministers, as representing the Church and 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, George Nicolson to Sir E. Cecil, 15th December, 1597-"], [293, "1597. 269 JAMES VI. third Estate of the Kingdom, might be admitted to have a voice in Parliament.\" It was at once seen that under this application, which had been so artfully managed to come not from the King but the Kirk, the first step Avas made for restoring the order of bishops. The monarch, indeed, did not now deny it. He kneAV that he had a majority in the Assembly, and looked for an easy victory ; but something of the ancient courage and fervour of Presbyterianism remained. Ferguson, now venerable from his age and experience, lifted up his testimony against the project for bringing his brethren into Parliament. It was, he affirmed, a Court stratagem; and if they suffered it to suc ceed, would be as fatal, from Avhat it carried within its bowels, as the horse to the unhappy Trojans. Let the words, said he, of the Dardan prophetess ring in your ears, \" Equo ne credite Teucri ! \" AndreAV Melvil, Avhom the Court party had in vain attempted to exclude, argued against the petition in his wonted rapid and powerful style ; and John Davison, tearing away from the King's speech, and the arguments of his adherents, the thin veil with which their ultimate design was covered, pointed, in a strain of Avitty and biting irony, to the future bench of bishops, and their Primate at their head. \" Busk him, busk him,\" said he, \" as bonnilie as ye can, and fetch him in as fairly as ye will \u2014 we ken him weel eneuch ; we see the horns of his mitre.\" L But these were insulated efforts ; and 1 Calderwood, p. 415. Busk, dress; bonnilie, prettily; ken, know ; eneuch, enough."], [294, "1597-8. 270 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. had so little effect, that the King, without difficulty, procured an act to be passed, which declared, \" That such pastors and ministers as the Crown provided to the place and dignity of a Bishop, Abbot, or other pre late, should have voice in Parliament as freely as any other ecclesiastical prelate had in any former age.1 A General Assembly was soon after convened, in Avhich the subject Avas solemnly argued in the King's presence, first by a committee of brethren, and after wards by the whole Church.2 As a preparation for this, James had tried every method of conciliation. He had extended his forgiveness to the ministers of Edin burgh for their part in the late tumult : he had re stored their privileges, and the comfort of his royal presence and pardon, to the magistrates and the citizens of the capital ; not, however, without having first imposed on them a heavy fine. To those stern and courageous supporters of the Presbyterian Estab lishment, Avhose presence he dreaded, other methods Avere used. Mr AndreAV Melvil, who pleaded a right to be present in the Assembly, as he had a \" Doctoral charge in the Kirk,\" was commanded, under pain of treason, to leave the city ; others, whose subserviency was doubtful, were wearied out and induced to retire by lengthened preliminary discussions ; and at last the King opened his great project in a studied har angue. He dwelt on his constant care to adorn and favour the Kirk, to remove controversies, restore discipline, and increase its patrimony. All, he said, Avas in a fair road to success ; but in order to ensure 1 Spottiswood, p. 450. 2 7th March, 1597."], [295, "1597-8, 271 JAMES VI. it and perfect the reform, it was absolutely requisite that ministers should have a vote in parliament : Avith out which, the Kirk could not be saved from falling into poverty and contempt. \" I mean not,\" said he, emphatically, \" to bring in Papistical or Anglican bishops, but only that the best and Avisest of the miniestry should be selected by your Assembly to have a place in Council and Parliament, to sit upon their own affairs, and not to stand always at the door like poor supplicants, utterly despised and disregard ed.\" x A keen argument followed. Mr James Mel vil, Davison, Bruce, Carmichael, and Aird, all devoted and talented ministers, spoke against the project, and denounced it in the strongest language. On the other side the brunt of the battle, in its defence, fell on Gledstanes, and the King himself, no mean adept in ecclesiastical polemics ; but, if we may believe Calder- Avood, the main element of success was the presence of the northern brethren ; whom this historian describes as a sad subservient rabble, led by Mr Gilbert Bodie, \" a drunken Orkney ass,\" whose name described their character : all being for the body, with small regard to the spirit.2 In the end the question was carried by a majority of ten : the Assembly finding that it was expedient for the good of the Kirk that the ministers, as the third Estate of the realm, should have a vote in Parliament ; that the same number, being fifty-one or thereby, should be chosen, as were Avont of old in time of the Papistical Kirk, to be bishops, abbots, and priors; and that their election 1 Calderwood, p. 418. 2 Id. p. 419."], [296, "272 1597-8. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. should belong partly to the King and partly to the Kirk. J This resolution Avas adopted in March 1597-8 ; but the final establishment of Episcopacy did not take place till more than a twelvemonth after this, in a General Assembly convoked at Montrose on the 28th March, 1600. On that occasion, it Avas decided that the King should choose each bishop, for every place that Avas to be filled, out of a leet or body of six, selected by the Kirk. Various caveats, or conditions, Avere added, to secure the Kirk against any abuse of their poAvers by these new dignitaries. They were to propound nothing in Parliament, in name of the Kirk, without its special Avarrant and direction. They were, at every General Assembly, to give an account of the manner in which they had executed their commission ; they were to be contented with such part of their benefices as the King had assigned for their living ; to eschew dilapi dation ; to attend faithfully on their individual flocks; to claim no higher power than the rest of their breth ren in matters of discipline, visitation, and other points of ecclesiastical government ; and lastly, to be as obedient to authority, and amenable to censure in all Presbyteries and Provincial or General Assem blies, as the humblest minister of the Kirk.2 As to the names of these new dignitaries, the Avord Bishop Avas apparently so odious and repugnant to the people that the King did not deem it prudent to insist on its adoption ; and the brethren unanimously advised that they should not be called bishops, but Commis- 1 Calderwood, pp. 420, 421. 2 Ibid., p. 441."], [297, "1597-8. 273 JAMES VI. sioners. James Avas too Avell satisfied Avith the reality of his success in carrying his great scheme to so prosperous an issue, to cavil at this shadow of opposition ; and the subject AATas handed over to the next General Assembly. The feelings Avith which this triumph of prelatical principles Avas regarded by the sincere and stern adherents of puritanism and parity, will be best understood by this brief extract from the Avork of one of its ablest advocates, the historian CalderAVOod : \" Thus,\" says he, \" the Trojan horse, the Episcopacy, was brought in, covered with caveats, that the danger might not be seen ; Avhich, notwithstanding, AATas seen of many, and opponed unto ; considering it to be better to hold thieA-cs at the door, than to have an eye unto them in the house that they steal not : and, indeed, the event declared that their fear Avas not Avithout just cause : for those Commissioners voters in Parliament, afterAvards bishops, did violate their caveats as easily as Samp son did the cords Avherewith he wras bound.\"1 1 Calderwood, p. 441.

According to the better principles of our OAvn times, he had acted with extraordinary severity and intolerance ; but even the highest and hottest Puritan of these unhappy days could not justly accuse him of indifference. He had, moreover, strengthened his aristocracy by healing its wounds, removing or binding up the feuds which tore it, and restoring to it three of its greatest members, Huntly, Angus, and Errol. He had punished, with exemplary severity, the tumult which had been ex cited in his capital, and read a lesson of obedience to the magistrates and middle orders, which they were not likely to forget. Lastly, he had, in a per sonal expedition, reduced his Borders to tranquillity ; and in his intercourse with England, had shown that, whilst he was determined to preserve peace, he Avas equally resolved to maintain his independence, and to check that spirit of restless intrigue and interference in AAThich the English Ambassadors at the Scottish Court had, for so many years, indulged with blame able impunity. Sir Robert BoAves, who had long filled that difficult and dangerous office, had recently died at Berwick, a victim apparently to its anxieties ; and having undergone, during his deA'oted services, the same trials of penury and neglect which, with"], [300, "1597-8. 276 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. scarcely one exception, seem to have been the portion of his royal mistress' Ambassadors and diplomatic agents.1 On the 11th of May he had written to his sovereign, imploring his recall, and lamenting that his decay in health, and weakness in body and estate, unfitted him for farther labour ; but his remonstrance Avas ineffectual : and it Avas not till nearly six months after, that an order arrived, permitting him to retire, and naming Sir William Bowes as his successor. The release, hoAvever, came too late. He AAras then unable to stand from Aveakness ; and he only reached Berwick to expire.2 The duties of his office, in the meantime, devolved upon Mr George Nicolson, his secretary, a man of ability, Avhose letters contain much that is valuable in the history of the times.

On this point the tranquillity from other cares now gave James full leisure for thought ; and he evinced an extreme sensitiveness in everything connected with it. Re- ports of speeches against his right of succession in the English Parliament ; books written in faA-our of the claim of the Infanta ; intrigues of pretenders at home ; the jealousy with which the Catholics regarded his reconciliation Avith the Kirk ; the suspicion Avith which the Kirk observed his faA-our to the Catholics : all these thorny matters perpetually haunted aud harassed him. From his observations, the Ambassa- dor dreaded that the royal mind Avas beginning to be alienated from England ; and in his first intervieAv James certainly expressed himself with some bitter- ness against Elizabeth. The expostulations addressed to him by his good sister, he said, Avere unnecessarily sharp. She accused him of diminished friendliness, of foreign predilections, of credulity and forwardness ; but he must retort these epithets, for he had found herself too ready to believe Avhat Avas untrue, and to condemn him unheard. It Avas true that, when he saAv other competitors for the Crown of England en- deaArouring, in every way, to advance their OAvn titles, and eA-en making personal applications to the Queen, he had begun to think it time to look to his just claim, and to interest his friends in his behalf. It Avas Avith this vieAv he had required assistance from his people to furnish Ambassadors to various foreign"], [302, "278 1597-8. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. poAvers. This, surely, he was entitled to do ; but anything which had been reported of him beyond this Avas false : and his desire to entertain all kindly offices with his o;ood sister of Enoland continued as strong- as it had been during his whole life.1 Eliza beth, however, was not satisfied : she still suspected that the Scottish Court was inimical to England ; and these suspicions Avere increased by the letters of Nicolson her agent. James was said to be much guided by the opinions of Elphinstone, Secretary of State, Avho Avas little attached to English interests. There Avas the Avarmest friendship between the Scot tish Queen, Anne of Denmark, and the Countess of Huntly, a devoted Catholic. They often slept in the same bed ; and this favoured lady, as Nicolson quaintly expressed it, had the \" plurality of her Majesty's kisses.\"2 The two young Princesses Avere intrusted to Lady Livingston, a Catholic ; many things, in short, concurred to sIioav, that although appear ances Avere preserved that the King might not forfeit his English \"gratuity,\" cordiality was at end. At this moment a strange circumstance occurred, Avhich ex asperated the feelings of both monarchs. A miscreant, named Valentine Thomas, accused James of employ ing him in a plot against the life of Elizabeth ; and it Avas at first whispered, and afterAvards more plainly asserted at the Scottish Court, that the Queen, though she did not choose to speak openly, believed the accusa- 1 MS.

Some dark expressions Avhich she used in a letter to the King seemed to countenance this idea ; and it Avas certain that she had employed Sir Ed- AvardCoke, Sir Francis Bacon, and other judges, in the investigation. James resented this, and insisted on explanations. It Avas needless in him, he said, to disclaim \"such vile intended murder;\" but he de manded the fullest investigation, and the severest punishment of the Avretch who had so foully slandered him. He Avould proclaim it as false to all the world by sound of trumpet, by open challenge, in any num ber ; yea, of a King to a King ! When his late Ambas sador to England attempted to pacify him, he struck him on the breast, and said he was sure there Avas a chain of Elizabeth's under his doublet. It was in vain that, to appease him, the Queen of England wrote a letter Avith her own hand, in whieh she assured him, that she Avas not \" of so viperous a nature\" as to harbour a thought against him ; and that the deviser of such abominable slander should have his deserts.1 EAren this was not enough. The accusation had been pub lic ; the depositions of the villain remained uncan celled ; Avho could say what use might not be made of them against his future rights, and to prejudice him in the hearts of the English people ? Here Avas the sore point ; and James did not cease to remon strate till he had extorted from the Queen a solemn and formal refutation of the Avhole story. 1 MS. Letter, St. P.

The subject of his title, indeed, had kept the monarch, for the last three years, in a state of per petual and irritable activity. He encouraged authors to write upon the question; and jurisconsults, heralds, and genealogists, made their harvest of his anxiety. Monsieur Jesse,a French literary adventurer, who in 1596 visited the Scottish Court, was made His toriographe au Roi d'Escosse, and commanded to \" blaze abroad\" Secretary Elphinstone's discourse on his majesty's title. Walter Quin, an Irish poet and scholar, drew up a Avork in Latin on the same sub ject. Monsieur Damon, another Frenchman, cor rected it and the King sent the manuscript to Waldegrave, his printer, Avho, in an agony, declared to Nicolson, that he must either print it, and irreco verably offend his gracious sovereign Queen Elizabeth, or refuse, at the peril of his life. Nor was this all ; James AAras suddenly seized Avith the most sensitive feelings on the subject of his royal mother's memory. His claims came through her; and slander on the Queen of Scots might taint the transmitted title. Spenser, as it was asserted, had glanced at her under the character of Duessa in his Fairy Queen ; and the Scottish Secretary of State insisted thatEdwardSjien ser, (the diplomatist did not even knoAV the immortal poet's name,) should be severely punished. Quin, too, came to the rescue, and Avrote an answer to Spenser ; Avhilst \" Dickson,\" an English pedagogue, Avho taught the Art of Memory, forsook his ferula, and found in Scotland a more profitable employment"], [305, "1598. 281 JAMES VI. in answering the famous Treatise of Doleman, or rather Father Parsons, from materials furnished by the King himself.1 These constant cares Avere only interrupted by the alarming increase of Avitches and sorcerers, Avho Avere said to be swarming in thousands in the kingdom; and for a moment all other cares Avere for gotten in the intensity Avith Avhich the monarch threw himself once more into his favourite subject.

At last suspicion Avas roused. A Avoman, whom she had con victed of having the devil's eye-mark, Avas disguised, and, after an interval, again brought before her ; she acquitted her.

This, as it Avell might, brought the royal inquisitionist of sorcery, and his civil and ecclesiastical assistants, to their senses. The Commission of Inquiry Avas recalled, and all proceedings against the Avitches discharged till the Parliament should have determined the form and evidence to be adopted in their trial.1 Everything was now tranquil in the southern part of the kingdom ; and the whole Estate, to use Nicol son's expression to Cecil, so \" marvellous quiet,\"2 that the King had leisure to attend to an important and long neglected subject : the condition of the Highlands and Isles. It had, for some time, been James' intention to visit these remote districts in person, and, as usual, to overaAve them by the terror of the royal name, backed by an army and a fleet ; but year after year had passed, and nothing Avas done. His impoArerished finances, his quarrel Avith the Kirk, his entanglements with the Papist earls, his embassies to foreign Courts on the subject of his title, \u2014 all these engrossed his attention ; and the fragments of leisure Avhich remained were filled up by the witches, and avTisit made to Scotland by the Duke of Holstein, the brother of his Queen, which seems to haATe thrown the Court into a perpetual Avhirl of pageantry, intoxication, and masquerade.

The joyous Dane took leave ; and the royal mind, relapsing into sobriety, turned to the Isles and Donald Gorm Mac donald. This potent Highland chieftain had recently made advances to Elizabeth; and it is not uninteresting to remark the stateliness Avith which a prince amongst the northern vikingr approached the English Semira mis. He styled himself Lordof thelslesof Scotland,and Chief of the Clandonnel Irishmen ; and after a proud enumeration of the petty island princes and chiefs Avho were ready to folloAV him in all his enterprises, he offered, upon certain \" reasonable motives and consid erations,\" to embrace the service of the Queen of Eng land, and persuade the Isles to throw off all alle giance to the Scottish Crown. He and his associates Avere ready, they declared, on a brief warning, to stir up rebellion throughout all the bounds of the main land, to \" fasche\"'2 his majesty, and Aveary the whole Estates ; to create a necessity for neAV taxation, and thus disgust all classes of his subjects. To induce Elizabeth to embrace these proposals, Donald in formed the Queen, that he knew the secret history of the Scottish King's intercourse with her arch- rebel Tyrone, and could lay before her the Avhole intrigues of the Catholic earls lately reconciled to the Kirk, but \" meaning nothing less in their hearts than that which they showed outAvardly to the world.\" He Avould disclose, also, he said, the 1 MS.

All this he Avas ready to do, upon \" good deservings, and honest courtesies,\" to be offered him by the Queen of Eng land ; to Avhose presence he promised to repair upon a moment's warning.1 What ansAver Avas given by the English Queen to these generous and disinterested proposals does not ap pear ; although the letter of Donald Gorm, who made it, is marked in many places by Burghley with the trem bling hand of sickness and old age. It is probable, that under the term \"honest courtesies,\" more sub stantial reAvards Avere found to be meant than Elizabeth Avas Avilling to bestoAV ; and that the per petual feuds, massacres, and conspiracies Avhich occurred amongst these Highland chiefs and their folloAvers, disgusted this Princess, and shook her con fidence in any treaties or alliances proposed by such savage auxiliaries.

So little did the brave Lord of Duart suspect any foul play, that he came to the meeting without ar mour, in a silk dress, and with only a rapier at his side. Along with him were his second son, and the best of his kin, in their holiday garb, and with little other arms than their hunting-knives and boar-spears: but although set upon by an ambush of nearly seA7en hundred men, they made a desperate defence.

The death of this great chief Avas little resented by the King : for James had long been jealous of his dealings Avith Elizabeth, and his bitter hostility to Huntly ; whilst, at this moment, Sir James Mac donald of Dunluce, his murderer, Avas in high favour at the Scottish Court.2 This Macdonald, knoAvn in Irish history as James Macsorlie, had been long a thorn in the side of England, stirring up rebellion in Ireland, and offering his services to James as an 1 The present Earl Compton, eldest son of the Marquess North ampton, is descended, through his mother the late amiable and ac complished Lady Compton, from this second son. 2 MS.

An association of Lowland ba rons, chiefly from Fife, took a lease from the Crown of the Isle of Lewis, for which they agreed, after seven years' possession, to give the King an annual rent of one hundred and forty chalders of victual, and came under an obligation to conquer their farm at their OAvn charges. Another company of noblemen and gentlemen in Lothian offered, under a similar agreement, to subdue Skye. And this kind of feudal joint-stock company actually commenced their oper ations Avith a force of six hundred soldiers, and a motley multitude of farmers, ploughmen, artificers, and pedlers. But the Celtic population and their haughty chiefs, could not consent to be handed over, in this wholesale fashion, to the tender mercies and agricultural lectures of a set of Saxon adventurers. The Lowland barons arrived, only to be attacked Avith the utmost fury, and to have the leases of their farms, in the old Douglas phrase, Avritten on their 1 Gregory, pp. 267, 283."], [312, "288 1598.

For a time, hoAvever, they continued the struggle ; and hav ing entered into alliance Avith some of the natiA-e chiefs, fought the Celts with their own Aveapons, and more than their own ferocity. Instead of agricultu ral or pastoral produce, importations of avooI, or samples of grain, from the infant colony, there was sent to the Scottish Court a ghastly cargo of tAvelve human heads in sacks ; and it Avas hoped that, after such an example of severity, matters might succeed better. But the settlers were deceived. After a feeble and protracted struggle of a feAV years, sickness and famine, perils by land, and perils by Avater, inces sant Avar, and frequent assassinations, destroyed the co lony ; and the three great northern chiefs, Macdonald of Sleat, Macleod of Harris, and Mackenzie of Kin tail, enjoyed the delight of seeing the principal gen tlemen adventurers made captive by Tormod Mac leod ; who, after extorting from them a renunciation of their titles, and an oath never to return to the LeAvis, dismissed them to carry to the Scottish Court the melancholy reflection, that a Celtic population, and the islands over Avhich it Avas scattered, AArere not yet the materials or the field for the operations of the economists of Fife and Mid-Lothian.1 The King's recent triumph over the ministers ; the vigour Avith whieh he had brought the bishops into Parliament, and compelled his nobles to renounce their blood-feuds ; seem to have persuaded him that 1 Gregory, p. 290-299.

The magistrates of Edinburgh had arrested an offender : he was rescued by one of the servants of the King. The magistrates prosecuted the rescuer, and compelled him to give assurance that he Avould deliver the original culprit ; but the courtier failed in his promise, and the civic authorities seized him and sent him to prison. An outcry arose. It Avas deemed disgraceful that an officer of the royal household, a gentleman responsible solely to the King, should be clapt up in jail by a set of burghers and bailies. James interfered, and commanded his servant to be set free ; but the bailies refused. The monarch sent a more angry message ; it Avas met by a still firmer reply : the Provost aud magistrates declared that they Avere ready to resign their offices into the King's hands; as long, hoAveArer, as they kept them, they Avould do their duty. James was much enraged, but cooled and digested the affront.1 Within a fortnight after, however, arose a more serious dispute between the CroAvn and the Court of Session, the Supreme Court of Judicature, in Avhich its President, Sir Alexander Seton, and the majority of the judges, exhibited a spirit of independence Avhich is Avell Avorthy of being recorded. The subject of quarrel Avas a judgment pronounced by the Court in favour of the celebrated minister of the Kirk, Mr 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Nicolson to Cecil, 27th Feb., 1598-9. VOL. IX.

The monarch appealed ; came to the Court in person ; pleaded his OAvn cause with the utmost violence, and commanded the judges to give their vote against Mr Robert. The President Seton then rose : \" My liege,\" said he, \" it is my part to speak first in this Court, of Avhich your Highness has made me head. You are our King ; we, your subjects, bound and ready to obey you from the heart, and, Avith all devotion, to serve you with our lives aud substance : but this is a matter of law, in which we are sworn to do justice accord ing to our conscience and the statutes of the realm. Your Majesty may, indeed, command us to the con trary ; in Avhich case I and every honest man on this bench will either vote according to conscience, or resign and not vote at all.\" Another of the judges, Lord Newbattle, then rose, and observed, \" That it had been spoken in the city, to his Majesty's great slander, and theirs who were his judges, that they dared not do justice to all classes, but were compelled to vote as the King commanded : a foul imputation, to which the lie that day should be given ; for they would now deliver a unanimous opinion against the Crown.\" For this brave and dignified conduct James Avas unprepared ; and he proceeded to reason long and earnestly with the recusants : but persuasions, arguments, taunts, and threats, were unavailing. The judges, Avith only tAVO dissentient votes, pronounced their decision in favour of Mr"], [315, "1598-9. 291 JAMES VI.

It was during the course of this year, that the Queen of England lost Lord Burghley, who died on the 4th of August, 1598, in his seventy-eighth year; a long tried and affectionate servant to his royal mis tress ; but of whom, however high his character as an English statesman, no Scottish historian can speak Avithout censure. He had been for nearly forty years the almost exclusive adviser of the English Queen in her Scottish affairs. It was chiefly his advice and exertions that brought the unhappy Mary to the scaffold ; and in his policy towards Scotland, he seems almost invariably to have acted upon the prin ciple, that to foster civil dissension in that kingdom, was to give additional strength and security to Eng land. Happily, the time has come when we may pronounce this maxim as unsound as it is dishonest ; but, in those days, craft was mistaken for political Avisdom : and Sir Robert Cecil, Lord Burghley's se cond son, who now succeeded to his father's power, had been educated in the same narrow school. 1 MS.

This able man, who filled the office of Secre tary of State to Elizabeth, had, as we have seen, for some years taken the chief management of Scottish affairs ; and, soon after his father's death, he became deeply alarmed for the orthodoxy of James and his Queen ; suspecting them, as appears by a paper in his own hand, of groAving every day more devoted in their affection to the Pope.1 That these Avere ideal terrors of the English Secretary, the result plainly shoAved: but the true key to this apparent Papal predilection, Avas James' extreme poverty ; the rigid economy of Elizabeth, Avho refused to supply his Avants ; and a hope entertained by the Scottish King, that if he exhibited a disposition to relax in the rigi dity of his Protestant principles, and to maintain an amicable intercourse with the Catholics, his exhausted exchequer might be recruited by a supply of Roman and Spanish gold. But Cecil, although he allowed some Aveight to this, thought it too slight a cause to account for the strong symptoms of declension from the reformed opinions exhibited both by the King and his councillors, and advised his royal mistress instantly to despatch Sir William Bowes into Scot land, Avhose veteran experience in Scottish politics might, he hoped, bring about a reaction. Want of money might, as Cecil contended, explain somewhat of James' late coldness ; but there must be deeper agen cies and convictions producing the strange appear- 1 MS. St. P.

It was noted too by Cecil, that Elphinstone, James' principal Secretary of State, Avas a Catholic ; that Seton, the President of the Session, was a Ca tholic ; that Lord Livingston, the governor of the young princesses, was a Catholic ; and that Huntly, Avho, notwithstanding his recent recantation, was strongly suspected of a secret attachment to his an cient faith, possessed the highest influence over the King.1 Then, James' late embassies to Catholic princes ; the favour shoAvn to Gordon the Jesuit ; his secret encouragement of Tyrone, the great enemy of England; a late mission of Colonel Semple to Spain ; his animosity to the ministers of the Kirk ; his introduction of bishops ; his correspondence with the Duchess of Feria, and other Catholics ; and even his speeches in the open Convention of his three Estates, were all quoted, and not without good rea son, as strong proofs of his defection. The necessities to Avhich the King had reduced himself by his too lavish gifts to his favourites, and the thoughtless extravagance of his household, Avere indeed deplorable, and produced repeated remonstran ces from his Treasurer, Comptroller, and other financial officers.

Money was required in all departments of the service of the State, and in all districts ; without the king dom and within it ; in the south and in the north. There were no funds to pay the resident in England ; no funds to procure secret intelligence ; none to sup port the public officers at home ; none to furnish the Wardens of the West Marches ; none to fit out a lieutenant for the expedition against the Western Isles, Avhere the rebels had taken Dunyveg, and were in great strength.1 It was in vain for James to look to England. Elizabeth replied by sending him a list of her gratuities, which proved that, from 1592 to 1599, she had given him twenty-six thousand pounds.2 At Court, the Avant of money produced strange scenes ; and the high offices of State, instead of being sought after as objects of ambition, were shunned as thank less and ruinous to their possessors.

James had been recently employing his leisure hours in Avriting his celebrated Treatise on Government, the Basilicon Doron, which he had addressed to his son the Prince of Wales; and having employed Sir James Sempil, one of his gentlemen, to make a tran script, the work was imprudently shown by him to Andrew Melvil ; who took offence at some passages. 1 MS.

What the exact passages were Avhich Melvil had transcribed does not appear ; but it is certain that the book contained an attack upon the Presbyterian form of Church Government, and that the Prince Avas instructed to hold none for his friends but such as had been faithful to the late Queen of Scots. It AATas very clear, (so the ministers argued,) that no person entertaining such sentiments as Avere openly expressed in this work, could endure for any long time the wholesome discipline of the Kirk ; and that the severe and sweeping censure pronounced upon the Scottish Reformation as the offspring of popular tumult and rebellion, very plainly indicated the author's leaning to Prelacy and Popery. What was to be expected, said they, from a writer Avho described the leaders of that glorious Avork as \" fiery and sedi tious spirits, Avho delighted to rule as Tribuni plebis\" ; and having found the gust of Government sweet, had brought about the wreck of tAvo Queens ; and during a long minority had invariably placed tliemseh'es at the head of every faction which Aveakened and dis tracted the country ? What was to be hoped for if those men, Avho had been ever the champions of the truth, were to be held up to scorn and avoidance in terms like the following : \" Take heed, therefore, my son, to such Puritans, very pests in the Church and commonweal, Avhom no deserts can oblige, neither oaths nor promises bind ; breathing nothing but"], [321, "1599. 297 JAMES VI. sedition and calumnies, aspiring without measure, railing Avithout reason ; and making their oavu ima ginations (without any warrant of the Word) the square of their conscience.

The rumour had nowT floAvn through the country that James was the author of the passages, and had given instructions to the Prince, which shoAAred an inveter ate enmity to the Kirk ; and it was thought that the publication of the Avhole Avork Avould be the likeliest means to silence the clamour. The book accordingly made its appearance; and in Archbishop Spottiswood's opinion,1 did more for James' title, by the admiration it raised in England for the piety and wisdom of the royal author, than all the Discourses on the Succes sion which Avere published at this time. In Scotland the effect, if Ave believe Sir William BoAves, Avas the very opposite. It Avas receiA'ed by the ministers with a paroxysm of indignation ; and soon after the arrival 1 Spottiswood, p. 456."], [322, "298 1599. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. of the English Ambassador, the Avhole Kirk agreed to proclaim a general Fast, to avert, by prayer and humili ation, the judgments so likely to fall on an apostate King and a miserable country. For two entire days the Fast was rigidly observed ; and Bowes declared, in his letter to Cecil, that in all his life he had never been witness to a more holy or powerful practice of religion.1 From the pulpit the ministers proclaimed to the people the chief causes for their call to mourn ing. A general coldness in God's service had seized, they said, on all ranks ; the enemies of the Gospel, Avho in purer days had been driven into banishment, were now everywhere returning ; and almost a third of the realm Avas deprived of every means for the teaching of the people. The King himself had be come the defamer of the Kirk; his children Avere brought up by an excommunicated Papist ; and the young nobility, the hopes of the country, went abroad meanly instructed, and returned either Atheists or Catholics.2 A singular event occurred at this time, which led to the recall of Bowes the English Ambassador, and gave high umbrage to the Scottish King. An Eng lish gentleman, named Ashfield,3 had lately come from Berwick, on a visit to the Scottish Court, who, as there is strong reason to believe, Avas one of those confidential agents whom James had employed in England to give him secret advice and information on the subject of his succession to the English throne, 1 MS.

Lord Wylloughby, the Governor of Benvick, had himself recommended Ashfield to James' notice ; but he had scarcely taken his leave, when Wylloughby discovered that he was a suspicious character, and might do much mischief in Scotland. His alarm became still greater, when he found the attention shoAvn to Ashfield by James ; his intimacy with the Catholic party at Court, then in great favour Avith the King ; and the strong suspicion of Bowes the Ambassador, that some treachery against England was contemplated. It Avas deter mined to destroy it in the bud, by kidnapping the principal party ; and John Guevara, Deputy-warden of the East Marches, Wylloughby's cousin, under took the commission. Repairing, with only three assistants, to Edinburgh, it Avas concerted with Bowes, that the Ambassador's coach should be Avait ing on Leith sands, and that Ashfield, under pre tence of taking a pleasure drive, should be inveigled into it, and carried off.

Next morning, Wainman, another of the GoArernor's ser- vants, arrived with Ashfield's papers, Avhich he and Bowes had seized, and brought intelligence that the Scottish King Avas in the greatest rage at the indig- nity offered him ; and that the people had surrounded Sir William Bowes' lodging, and threatened his life. It had been discovered that the gentlemen Avho kid- napped Ashfield Avere in Wylloughby's service, that the coach belonged to the English Ambassador, and that some intoxicating potion had been put in his Avine. James wrote a seArere and dignified remonstrance to Wylloughby, in Avhich he demanded to know whether this outrage had been committed under any Avarrant or order from the English Queen ;J assuring him that it was a matter Avhich, Avithout speedy reparation, he Avould not pass over.

James' dis satisfaction, however, was so great, and the coldness and distance with Avhich he treated Bowes made his place so irksome, that Elizabeth soon afterwards recalled him.1 The arrival of a French Ambassador at this crisis, increased the dissatisfaction of the English Queen and the ministers of the Kirk; who suspected that his mission, although kept secret, was connected Avith James' intrigues with the Catholics abroad. He was a gentleman of the house of Bethuue, a younger brother of the great Sully, and much caressed at the Scottish Court : but what especially alarmed the Kirk, Avas his having brought a Jesuit along with him, Avho was frequently closeted with the King; whilst the openness Avith which Sully was allowed the exercise of his re ligion, caused the brethren to sigh over the contrast of the present cold and liberal times, with the happy days when it was death to set up the Mass in Scotland.

To the strict notions of these divines, profane plays, and the licentious mummeries of the stage, were almost as detestable as the Mass itself. The one Avas idolatry \u2014 the Avorship of Baal, or the golden calf; the other Avas profanity \u2014 the dancing of Hero dias' daughter : and as this had led to Herod's rash oath, and the decapitation of the Baptist, so did these English buffoons recall to their mind the miser able times of the Guisean domination, when the Court Avas full of revelry and masquerade, and the blood of the saints was shed like Avater. It was no Avonder that, with such feelings, the arrival of this gay troop of players was received Avith a storm of ecclesiastical wrath, for which the gentlemen of the buskin were little prepared; and their case appeared desperate, Avhen the magistrates of the capital, acting under the influence of the Kirk, prohibited the inhabitants, by a public act, from haunting the theatre. But James was not so easily defeated. Fletcher had been an old favourite ; nor was this his first visit to Scotland. He had been there before, in 1594; and on his return to England, had suffered some persecution from his popularity Avith James ; who now called the Provost and his counsellors before him, compelled them to rescind their act, and proclaimed, by sound of trum pet, not only that the comedians should continue"], [327, "1599. 303 JAMES VI. their entertainments, but insisted that, next Sunday, the ministers should inform their flocks that no re straint or censure should be incurred by any of his good subjects who chose to recreate themselves by \" the said comedies and plays.\" \" Considering,\" so runs the royal act, \" that we are not of purpose, nor intention, to authorize or command anything quhilk1 is profane, or may carry any offence.\"2 The King's mind had long run intently on the subj ect of the succession; and he no av adopted a measure which, so far as Elizabeth was concerned, was calculated rather to injure than advance his title. A general Band or Contract was drawn up, \" purporting to be made by the good subjects of the King's Majesty, for the preservation of his person and the pursuit of his undoubted right to the crown of England and Ire land.\"3 The whole matter, during its preparation, was kept secret, and James trusted that no whisper would reach the ears of his good sister Elizabeth. But he was disappointed ; for Nicolson, on the 27th November, 1599, thus mentioned it to Cecil. \" I hear, which I beseech your honour to keep close, that there is a general Band, subscribed by many, and to be sub scribed by all earls, lords, and barons ; binding them, by solemn vow and oath, to serve the King with their lives, friends, heritages, goods, and gear ; and to be ready, in warlike furniture, for the same on all occa- 1 Quhilk; which. 2 MS.

But when the Estates assembled, the result did not justify expec- tations. The Convention, indeed, Avas fully attended, and sufficiently loyal in its general feeling ; yet AArhen the monarch explained his Avants, and sought their advice and assistance, they heard him coldly, and delayed their answer till the next meeting of the Estates. In his harangue, James declared his dis- like to any offensive scheme of taxation ; proposing, in its place, that a certain sum should be levied on every head of cattle and sheep, throughout the coun- try ; but this was utterly refused. He forbore, therefore, to press the point, and contented himself Avith an appeal to them for that support which all good subjects should give their prince for the vindi- cation of his lawful claims. He was not certain, he said, Iioav soon he should have occasion to use arms ; but whenever it should be, he knew his Right, and Avould venture crown and all for it.

Avhetted by the gloomy prospect of an empty Ex chequer at the time money was becoming every day more needed, dreAv up another scheme Avhich Avas submitted to his Estates Avith as little success as the former. Its object Avas excellent : being to remove the burden of supplies from the poor commons and labourers of the ground ; for which purpose he pro posed, that the AArhole country should be \" disposed, as it Avere, into one thousand persons, and each person to pay a particular sum ;\" Avhich, all being joined, Avould make up a total equal to his majesty's necessities. Against this plan, which had, at least, the merit of simplicity, a formal Protest was presented by the barons and burghs. The Laird of Wemyss in the name of the barons, and John Robertson for the burghs, insisted that they should be specially excepted from any commission given to the Sheriffs, for the levying such a sum, and should continue to \"stint [tax] themselves in auld manner;\" but as the proposal was hypothetical, and came before the Es tates merely as an overture, it Avas judged enough to meet it by delay ; and so anxious Avas the King to spare his people, and fall in with the Avishes of all, that he not only agreed to except the barons and burghs, but to drop the Avhole scheme if any better should be proposed at the next Convention, which was fixed to be held at Edinburgh, on the 20th of June.1 It Avas happy that all ended so ami cably; for at the beginning of the Convention he had 1 MS.

He Avas pardoned ; became again suspected ; threw himself into another enterprise against the Government, with Mar and Angus ; AAras detected, found guilty, and suffered on the scaffold. Of his treason there Avas no doubt ; but his conviction, as Ave have seen,1 Avas procured by a disgraceful expedient, which roused the utmost in dignation of his friends. This happened in 1584* ; and, for two years after, the imperious government of Arran directed, or rather compelled, the royal wrath into the seArerest measures against the house of Ruthven. But the destruction of Arran's power permitted the King's temper, generally gentle and for giving, to have influence ; and, in 1586, the earldom Avas restored to James, the eldest son of the house, Avho, dying soon after, transmitted it to John, the third earl, the author of the Gowrie Conspiracy. Young GoAvrie, at the time of his father's execu tion, could haATe been scarcely eight years' old ;2 and in the Avreck of his house, he, his unhappy mother, and her other children, received an asylum in the North. Here, amidst the savage solitudes of Athol, the country of her son-in-law,3 the AvidoAved Coun tess brought up her children, brooded OATer her wrongs, and taught her sons the story of their father's 1 Supra, vol. viii. p. 192. 2 MS.

From such lessons, they seem early to have drunk in that deep passion for revenge, which, in those dark days, Avas so universally felt, that it may be regarded almost as the pulse of feudal life ; a passion which, sometimes at a quicker, sometimes at a slower pace, but yet Avith strong and abiding force, carried on its victims to the consummation of their purpose. Mean- Avhile the royal pity had awoke : the family Avas re stored to its honours ; and the young earl, having been committed to the care of Rollock the learned Principal of the University of Edinburgh, received an excellent education. But the return for all this, on the part both of his mother and himself, was ingratitude and new intrigues. When, in 1593, Bothwell at Holy rood audaciously broke in upon his sovereign, and for a short season obtained possession of his person, it was the Countesses of Gowrie and Athol, the mother and sister of Gowrie, Avho were his most active assistants ; and in 1594, when the same des perate baron, in conjunction Avith Athol, Ochiltree, and the Kirk, organized a second plot, the name of the young Earl of Cowrie appeared in the \"Band\" which united the conspirators.1 He was thus early bred up in intrigue ; but the King either did not, or Avould not, discover his guilt : and GoAvrie, having received the royal license to complete his education abroad,2 passed through England into Italy, studied for five years at the University of Padua, and there is said 1 See above p. 102, and St. P.

Amongst his studies Necromancy, or Natural Magic, was a favourite pursuit ; and his tutor, Rhynd, detected him, when at Padua, wearing cabalistic characters concealed upon his person, Avhich AATere then sometimes used as spells against diabolic, or recipients of angelic influence.3 He was an enthusi astic chemist ; and, in common Avith many eminent men of that age, a dabbler in judicial astrology, and a believer in the great arcanum. It is curious that this propensity to magic and visionary pursuits Avas hereditary in the Ruthven family. His grandfather, the murderer of Riccio, had given Queen Mary a magic ring, as a preservative against poison. His father, the leader in the Raid of Ruthven, when in Italy, had his fortunes foretold by a wizard ; and the son, Avhen some of his friends had killed an adder in the braes of Strathbran, lamented their haste, and told them he would have diverted them by making it dance to the tune of some cabalistic Avords Avhich he had learnt in Italy from a great necromancer and divine. 1 Calderwood, MS.

During his residence at Padua, GoAvrie addressed to the King a letter full of gratitude and affection.1 He kept up, also, a correspondence with his old tutor Rollock; and, in 1595, sent a long epistle to Malcolm, the minister of the kirk at Perth, express ing the most devoted attachment to Presbyterian principles, and written in that strange, pedantic, puri tanic style which then characterized the correspon dence of the most zealous of that party.2 The young carl described in this letter, with high exultation and approval, an insane attack made by a fanatical English Protestant upon a Catholic procession, in Avhich he seized the sacred Host, and trampled it under foot ; and concluded by expressions of deep regret that his absence from Scotland did not permit him to set forth God's glory in his natiA'-e country; trust ing, as he added, to make up for all this on his return. This return took place in 1599, through Swit zerland ; and on arriving at Geneva, he became an inmate for three months in the house of the famous Reformer Beza, Avho cherished him as the son of a father whom his party regarded as a martyr to the Protestant faith. From Geneva he travelled to Paris, Avhere he was received with high distinction at the French Court, and by Elizabeth's Ambassador, Sir Henry Nevil ; Avho admitted him into his confi dence, held private conferences Avith him \" on the alterations feared in Scotland, (to use Nevil's own 1 Pitcairn's Crim.

On leaving France, GoAvrie, carrying Avarm letters of recommendation from Nevil, proceeded to the English Court ; where Elizabeth received him Avith flattering distinction, and kept him for tAVO months ; admitting him to her confidence, holding with him great conference2 on the state of Scotland, which Avas then threatening and alarming ; and it is said by one author, appointing a guard to Avatch over his safety. It Avas then no unfrequent occurrence for the incipient intriguer, or conspirator, to be seized or kidnapped by the strata gem of his opponents ; and, if true, this circumstance certainly shows Iioav highly the English Queen regard ed his safety, and what ATalue she set upon his future services. During this stay in England he became familiar Avith Sir Robert Cecil, at this moment the most confidential minister of Elizabeth ; Avith the great Lord Wylloughby, one of the honestest and ablest servants of the Queen ;3 and with many others of the leading men about Court.

He had resolved, and made no secret of his resolution, to vindicate his right to the Crown of England by arms, if it were necessary ; and he had roused the resentment and alarm of the party of the Kirk to the highest pitch, by the court Avhich he paid to the Catholics, both at home and on the continent. A letter Avritten to Cecil by Colvil, about six months before this, described these intrigues and preparations in strong terms. Colvil, it must be remembered, was the confidant of the notorious BothAvell, and an old friend and felloAv-conspirator of GoAvrie's father. It was cer tain, so said Colvil in this letter, that tAvo envoys had come to the Scottish King from the Pope. They had brought high offers : a promise of a hundred thousand crowns at present, and an engagement to pay doAvn tAvo millions the moment he published liberty of con science, and declared Avar Avith England. Twenty thousand Catholics were said to be ready to join the King the moment he crossed the Border. There Avas not one Catholic Prince in Europe who would not support his claim ; and his Holiness not only regarded him as the most learned and religious Prince of his time, but would Avillingly follow his advice in restor ing to the universal church its purity and discipline.1 1 MS.

In another letter, Avritten some time before this, and dated 17th August, 1599, Colvil speaks to Cecil of the ominous tranquillity of the Scottish Court ; which, he says, he had often remarked to be never so quiet as Avhen some \" snake-stone was hatching\" ; adding, \" Quand leMcchant dort,le Diable le berche.\" He assured Cecil, that the King Avas highly enraged and excited against the party of the Kirk. The ministers were led by Bruce and AndreAV Melvil ; their ranks in cluded Cassillis, Lindsay, Morton, and Blantyre ; and he added, with a significancy which this statesman could be at no loss to understand, that if they re ceived any secret encouragement from England, they Avere devising to send for GoAvrie and Argyll, both of whom Avere then abroad.1 This letter Avas written towards the end of August, 1599, AA'hen GoAvrie Avas probably on his route to Eng land ; and in the interval betAveen this and his arrival at the Court of Elizabeth, the estrangement betAveen the Queen of England- and the King of Scots had be come more embittered.

In one of his letters to Cecil, written in the end of April, 1600, AAdien GoAA7rie was at the English Court, and, as we have just seen, admitted to the confidence of this minister and his royal mis tress, he described the King as indulging in expres sions of the utmost discontent and anger on the subject of the intended peace between England and 1 MS.

Elizabeth (such were James' Avords) had long resisted every amicable application made to her on the point of his title ; and noAv he heard one day she Avas about to marry the Lady Arabella to the brother of the Emperor Mathias ; the next, that she had sent for young Beauchamp to Court ; the next, that in con sequence of her peace with Spain, a priest had openly addressed the Infanta, as the destined restorer of the Catholics in England.1 Of all this, James added, the Queen refused him any explanation. She treated him Avith coldness and suspicion ; and it became him to look to his just rights, and provide for the future. Such things were said eA^en openly by the King of Scots ; but in the secrecy of his cabinet, James used far stronger language. He there insisted, that before Elizabeth's death, which considering her advanced age and broken health, could not be far distant, he must be ready armed, his exchequer Avell supplied, and the friends on Avhom he could place reliance, assembled on the spot with their full strength. To compass all this, he had spared no exertion. Eng land sAvarmed Avith his spies ; and the \" daily creep ing in of Englishmen\" to the Scottish Court, was a matter AArhich perpetually roused the suspicions of Cecil, and cut his royal mistress to the quick. At this very moment, when GoAvrie was in such confi dential intercourse with that Princess and her minis ters, the Scottish King had received information wdiich made him stand especially on his guard. It was reported that a plot was then being organized 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Nicolson to Cecil, 24th Dec., 1599."], [340, "1600. 316 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. by the faction in the interest of England, to compel the King into a more pacific policy, and arrest his Avarlike preparations against that realm;1 that Colvil, Archibald Douglas, and Douglas the Laird of Spot, all of them old employes of Cecil, were the chief conspirators in England ; and that they were casting about to draw home the Earl of Gowrie, then at the Court of Elizabeth, and on Avhom they reckoned as a great accession to their strength.2 BothAvell, too, the arch-traitor, whom of all men the King hated and dreaded most, had been at Paris at the same time with GoAvrie : their former intimacy rendered it almost impossible they should not have met ; and it Avas noAv strongly reported, that this desperate man had stolen into Scotland, and had been thrice seen recently in Liddesdale.3 Such was the state of parties ; such the mutual heart-burning jealousy, intrigues, and preparations be tAveen the tAvo sovereigns, Avhen Gowrie, after tAvo months' residence in England, left the Court of Eliza beth and returned to his native country. The facts hitherto given are all capable of proof: their effects upon the character of GoAvrie, and hoAV far they in fluenced or serve to explain his subsequent extra ordinary proceedings, can only be conjectural. Yet it appears that they go far to explain something of the mystery which hitherto has surrounded the 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off., Nicolson to Cecil, 20th April, 1600. 2 Id. Ibid. 3 MS. Letter, St. P.

GoAvrie Avas young : and on youth Avhat must have been worked by the flattery of a Queen, and so great a Queen as Elizabeth! He Avas ambi tious and proud ; and Avhen he found that his friends Avere anxious to place him at the head of the English faction, and in opposition to the hostile projects of the King, was it likely he should decline that pre eminence ? He was a devoted and enthusiastic Puritan, and hated prelacy. Was such a mind likely to refuse the opportunity that iioav offered, to reestab lish the Presbyterian ascendancy, to reinstate his old friends the ministers on the ground from which they had been driven, and to destroy, if possible, that Catholic faith, which, in his judgment, Avas idolatrous and damnable ? He was animated by a keen desire to revenge his father's death on the monarch who had brought him to the scaffold ; and Avas it probable that Avhen, in the secret conferences AA7hich took place Avith Nevil, ' Cecil, and Elizabeth, the hostile plans and dangerous intrigues of the King of Scotland were discussed, the Raid of Ruthven should have been forgotten; or that the nefarious project, so repeatedly hazarded, so often croAvned Avith success, to seize the King's person, and administer the government under his pretended sanction, would not present itself? To grasp the supreme poAver, and haA'e his revenge into the bargain : were such offers unlikely to be held out by so unscrupulous a minister as Cecil ? Was"], [342, "318 1000. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. it probable that, if held out, they would be refused by Gowrie? But leaving such speculations, let us proceed. The young earl arriAred in Scotland, after his long absence, about the 20th of May; and some little circumstances accompanied his return, which, after his miserable fate, were remembered and much dwelt on. He entered the capital surrounded by an unusually brilliant cavalcade of noblemen and gentlemen, the friends and dependants of his house, and amid the shouts of immense crowds Avho welcomed his return. On hearing of it, the King shook his head, and ob- served, that as many shouted Avhen his father lost his head at Stirling. Whether this was said in the presence of the young earl, is not added by Calder- Avood, who gives the anecdote ; but it was noticed, and Ave may be pretty sure Avould reach his ear. When he kissed hands, and took his place in the Court circle, his fine presence, handsome countenance, and graceful manners, struck every one.. Pie soon be- came a special favourite of the Queen and her ladies, one of whom was his sister, Lady Beatrix Ruthven ; and to the King his learning and scholarship made him equally acceptable. He had lived in the society of the most eminent foreign scholars, philosophers, and divines ; but he was equally accomplished in all knightly sports, and could discuss the merits of a haAvk or hound as enthusiastically as any subject in the circle of the sciences. This was much to James' content ; and as the monarch sat at breakfast, he Avould often keep Gowrie leaning on the back of his chair, and talk to him with that voluble, un-"], [343, "1600. 319 JAMES VI. dignified familiarity which marked the royal conver sation. He rallied the young nobleman, also, on his long stay at the English Court ; and, as Sir John Carey Avrote toCecil, assailed him with many \"fleytes1 and pretty taunts,\" on the high honours paid him by Elizabeth, his frequent great conferences Avith the Queen, her offer to bribe him Avith gold, and the sump tuousness of his reception and entertainment. He mar velled, too, with good-humoured irony, that his old friends, the ministers of the Kirk, had not ridden out to meet him and form part of his triumphant cavalcade ;2 and, half between joke and earnest, con trived to show him that he had watched all his move ments, and was perfectly aware of his confidential intercourse with Nevil, Cecil, and Elizabeth herself. All this GoAvrie took, or seemed to take, in good part.3 He had certainly, he said, been honourably en tertained, and very graciously received by the Queen of England ; but this, he believed, was for the King his master's sake ; and so he had accepted it. As for gold, he had been offered none : nor did he need it. He had enough of his own.4 It was in one of those familiar conArersations on a strange subject, that an allusion escaped the King, Avhich Avas afterwards remembered. Queen Anne was at this time great with child, and probably did not take sufficient care 1 \" Fleytes,\" scolds. 2 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, B.C., Sir John Carey to Cecil, 29th May, 1600. 3 MS.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. of herself; but be this as it may, James consulted GoAvrie, who had studied at Padua, then the highest medical school in Europe, on the most common causes of miscarriage. He mentioned several, but insisted on fright or sudden terror as the most dangerous ; upon Avhich the King, bursting into a fit of loud and scornful laughter, exclaimed, \" Had that been true, my Lord, I should never have been sitting here to ask the question. Remember the slaughter of Seignor Davie, wherein thy grandsire was the chief actor:\" a reckless, cruel thrust, which the young nobleman must have felt like an adder's sting: for not only his grand father but his father AArere present at that bloody deed.1 On another occasion, soon after his arrival, a ruffle AAras nearly taking place in the long gallery at Holy rood, between the servants of Colonel William Stewart and some of the gentlemen of GoAA'rie's suite. It Avas this Stewart Avho had seized his father at Dundee, and dragged him to his trial and death ; and all dreaded a bloody encounter. But Gowrie, to their surprise, beat down the weapons of his followers ; and giving place with a contemptuous jesture to Stewart, permitted him to walk first into the presence-chamber. On being remonstrated wdth, his brief and proud reply Avas a Latin proverb, \" Aquila non captat muscas.\" It is the remark of an old chronicler, that he here covertly alluded to his intended revenge against the King.2 It is cer- 1 Calderwood, MS.

On his first arrival at Court, about the middle of May 1600, he found the King's mind still concen trated upon that one subject which had so long filled his thoughts, and which he had determined to bring shortly before a Convention of his nobility, barons, and burghs. This Avas the necessity of making pre paration for an event now currently talked of: the death of Elizabeth. To this end James had sum moned a Convention of the three E,states to meet on the 20th of June. He had resolved to levy a tax upon the country, to pay his Ambassadors to foreign parts ; and to have such a force in readiness as should overawe his enemies, and give confidence to his sup porters. On these proposed measures parties Avere so divided, and such violent storms were apprehended, that the Avisest, as Nicolson wrote to Cecil, Avishcd themselves out of the country ; and GoAvrie, by the advice of his friends, after a brief stay at Court, re tired to his own estates, \" to be a beholder of the issue of these many suspicions.\"1 Soon after this, a violent intervieAv took place betAveen the King and the English resident, Nicolson, in which James com plained that Elizabeth had treated him Avith the ut most haughtiness and Avant of confidence on the sub ject of the Spanish peace. She blamed him, he said, for matters of which heAvas Avholly innocent, and show ed more kindness to a foreign Duke and the Infanta than to him. It was openly bragged by one of her 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Nicolson to Cecil, 27th May, 1600. VOL. IX. Y"], [346, "1000. 322 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. subjects, that BothAvell was to be let loose, to come in again and brave it. She had seized a parcel of muskets, which he had declared upon his honour had been purchased for the use of his household, as if she dreaded they should be turned against herself.1 All this, Avhich was daily reported to Elizabeth and Cecil, increased the unfriendly feelings betAveen the tAvo Courts, and convinced the English minister that something decided must be done, to check that bold, and almost hostile attitude in Avhich James seemed noAv determined to insist upon his rights to the Eng lish throne. At last the important day of the Convention of the three Estates arrived ; the nobility, including Gowrie amongst the rest, assembled ; the barons and burghs attended ; and the King, after having, in many pri vate intervieAvs, endeavoured to gain over the leading men to his own views, brought his proposals before the public meeting of the three Estates, in a studied harangue. To his extreme indignation and astonish ment, he failed to convince them of the necessity of taxing themselves to raise the sum he required. The majority of the nobility and the prelates avIio had been privately canvassed by James, and talked over by the Earl of Mar, Avere compliant enough ; but the barons and the burghs stoutly resisted. The King adjourned the Convention from Monday till Tuesday, employing the interval in threats, entreaties, and re monstrances ; but on this day they were as stubborn as before. Another and longer adjournment, and another 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Nicolson to Cecil, 29th May, 1600."], [347, "1600. 323 JAMES VI. meeting took place. It not only found them in the same indomitable humour, but some of the higher barons began to waver. The Lord President Seton, in reply to the assertion of the royal claimant, that he must haAre an army ready on the Queen's death, to maintain his title, argued against the utter folly of attempting to seize that ancient crown by conquest. For such a purpose, he observed, Avho could say Avhat exact sum might be required ? and if the sum were named, Avho was so insane as to expect that Scotland could raise it ? If about to build a palace, they might have a plan and an estimate ; if to raise an army of so many thousand men, some certainty might be had of the funds required : but Avho Avould Arenture to fix the sum necessary for the conquest of England ? and if fixed, who could be so mad as to believe that the poor country of Scotland could raise it, Avhen it Avas notorious that sundry towns in Eng land and the Loav Countries could advance more money than all Scotland together?1 Mr Edward Bruce argued for the King's views ; and insisted that every true Scotsman, if he regarded the honour of his Prince and country, ought to contribute to the sum now re quired. Let them not imagine, said he, that a refusal would be unaccompanied with danger. Whoever usurped England after Elizabeth's death Avould have an eye to Scotland ; and if they now suffered their King to be defeated of his right, they might chance to find themselves defeated of their country. 1 MS.

This argument somewhat softened James, Avho had started up in a violent passion and accused the Presi dent Seton of perverting his meaning. But nothing could moAre the barons and burghs. They reiterated their plea of poverty ; declared, that when the time came,theyAvould furnish their monarch as fair an army as ever good subjects levied for their Prince; and in the meanAvhile, instead of forty thousand croAvns, would give him forty thousand pounds Scots, on the con dition that they should never again be taxed in his time ; and that what they did give should go to his oavii wants, and not to his hungry courtiers. The King spurned at this diminished and conditional offer, and insisted that it should be put to the vote Avhether it had not been agreed in a former Conven tion at St Johnston, that a hundred thousand croAvns should be advanced him by a thousand persons. On this neAV question the young Earl of GoAvrie noAv spoke for the first time ; and heading the opposition of the barons and the burghs, exposed the King to the disgrace of a second defeat.1 He had, he said, been long absent from the country, and had no per sonal knoAvledge of Avhat had taken place at St John ston ; but he contended that the present offer of the burghs and barons, to give forty thousand pounds to the King, and their promise to raise money for an army Avhen it Avas required, was quite as good, nay, almost a better proposal, than that so strongly insisted on by James. Why, then, should his Majesty take such deep umbrage at it ? Surely, he continued, it 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off., Nicolson to Cecil, 29th June, 1600."], [349, "1600. 325 JAMES VI. must be evident, that this demand of the King will bring dishonour upon all parties : it is dishonourable for a Prince to ask more than his subjects have to give, and suffer the ignominy of a refusal ; it is dis honourable for a people that their poverty should be laid bare to the Avorld, and that all men should see and knoAV they could give so little to their Prince.1 This speech of Gowrie, and the daring Avay in which so young a man threw himself into the ranks of the faction opposed to the King, astonished the Assembly. \" Alas !\" said Sir David Murray, a courtier, who stood near, \" yonder is an unhappy man : his enemies are but seeking an occasion for his death ; and now he has given it.\" 2 But if others wondered, the King, to use an expression of Nicolson's to Cecil, absolutely raged, and dismissed the Assembly Avith a tumultuous burst of fierce and undignified invective; mingling his abuse of the barons and burghs Avith praises of his nobility, whom he assured of his friendship and favour in all their affairs. \" As for you, my masters,\" he exclaimed, turning with flashing eyes to the burghers, \" your matters, too, may chance to come in my way ; and, be assured, I shall remember this day, and be even with you. It was I who gave you a vote in Parliament ; I who made you a fourth Estate : and it Avill be well for such as you to remember that I can summon a Parliament at my pleasure, and pull you down as easily as I have built you up.3 This insult ing speech roused one of the oldest of the barons, the 1 MS.

Laird of Easter Wemyss, Avho boldly told the King that he misconstrued their meaning ; and forgot how much he OAved them, and what great sums they had given him in his necessities. \" We have done your Majesty,\" said he, \" as good offices for our Estate ; and we, your Majesty's burghs and barons, are as Avorthy your thanks as the proudest earl, or lord, or prelate here. Our callings may be inferior, but our devotedness is as great ; and so your Majesty will find it Avhen the proper time arrives.

He was not di verted from his purpose, hoAvever ; for, not ten days after, Sir Robert Cecil, Avho Avas familiar with all that had taken place at the Convention, was informed by one of his correspondents, that James' prepara tions against England continued, and that he intended not to tarry till Elizabeth's death. This news Avas Avritten partly in cipher, on a slip of paper sent to 1 MS, Letter, St. P, Off, Nicolson to Cecil, 29th June, 1600."], [351, "1600. 327 JAMES VI.

Elizabeth and James were, as we have just seen, on the very worst terms with each other. GoAvrie, by every feeling of education, interest, and revenge, was attached to England and its Queen ; and his conduct in the ConATention had now throAvn him into mortal opposition Avith the King of Scots. James Avas intriguing with the Queen's subjects in England. It was suspected he had fomented the rebellion in Ireland ; and all this at a moment when the Queen Avas most likely to resent it deeply ; for she had lately been roused and irritated by the insane projects of Essex. Although aged, Elizabeth was still unbroken in health ; yet James must be watching for her death, and openly admonishing his subjects to make preparations for taking possession of her croAvn. This Gowrie knew ; and he reckoned on the support of England in anything he undertook against the King. He could build, too, with cer tainty on the favourable opinion of the lesser barons, and the influential body of the burghs. They had 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, 9th July, 1600.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. already made their stand against the King ; in the convention Gowrie had joined them ; and they understood each other. On the Kirk he could rely Avith still more certainty : he was the darling hope of the Presbyterian party, the son of their martyr ; the youthful Daniel, who had kept his first faith en tire in the bosom of idolatry, and in the very head quarters of Antichrist. Could he doubt that, in any attempt to stay the headlong haste with Avhich their unhappy King seemed to be throwing himself into the arms of the Catholic party, he Avould fail to have the AAdiole force of the Kirk upon his side? All this was encouraging ; and when, in addition to these induce ments, he contemplated the rich reward awaiting his success, if he made himself master of the King's per son ; the gratification of his ambition, power, place, fame, above all, revenge ; was it likely that a man of GoAArrie's temperament would resist them all ? Besides, he had enemies : his death and ruin, if wTe may be lieAre one who must have had good cause of knoAV ledge, were already resolved on ; x and if he did not become the assailant, it was a narroAv chance but he might prove the victim. If, on the other hand, he could but strike the bloAV, his popularity and high connexions promised him many friends, on whose concurrence he could safely reckon. But how Avas the blow to be struck ? Here was the whole difficulty and danger; and here, young as he was, Gowrie appears to have devised a plot unlike any hitherto knoAvn in his country's history, although fer tile in conspiracies: more Italian than Scottish; crafty, 1 See p. 325."], [353, "1600. 329 JAMES VI. rather than openly courageous ; and, from its very ori ginality, not, perhaps, unlikely to have succeeded, had the parts assigned to the conspirators been differently cast. His design appears to have been to decoy the King, by some plausible tale, into his castle of Goav rie, on the Tay ; to separate him from his suite, and compel him, by threats of instant death, to suffer himself to be carried aboard a boat Avhich should be Avaiting on the river for the purpose. This AATas the first act in the projected plot : in the second, the vessel Avas to push instantly out to sea ; and the royal prisoner Avas to be conveyed, in a few hours, to an impregnable little fortalice AAThich overhung the Ger man Ocean, and where, if Avell victualled, a garrison of twenty men could, for months, have defied a royal army. To communicate Avith England, and admin ister the government in the royal name, but under the dictation of Gowrie and his faction, would then be easy. It had been repeatedly done before in the history of the country, and very recently in the Raid of Ruthven ; A\\Thy then should it not be done again ? In all this projected scheme there Avas some rashness ; something smacking of youth, audacity, and revenge ; but there was also some sagacity. Since the days of the conspiracy against Riccio, down to the Raid of Ruthven, most of the plots which chequer and stain the history of the country had failed, from admitting too many into their secret. A band or covenant had been draAvn up ; a correspon dence opened Avith England ; the Envoy at the Scot tish Court had been admitted to the secret ; the Kirk"], [354, "330 1600. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. consulted ; the pulse of the burghs and barons felt ; and so many points presented for suspicion to Avork on, and treachery to be rewarded, that success Avas unlikely, and discovery almost inevitable. That Gowrie had observed this, and had deeply studied the subject of \" Conspiracies against Princes\" under Machiavel, the most acute of masters, Ave know from a curious anecdote preserved by SpottisAvood. A short time before his unhappy death, a friend found him in the library, Avith a volume of the great Flo rentine in his hand. On inquiring the subject of his studies : showing him the book, he observed that it Avas a collection of the most famous conspiracies against princes. \" A perilous subject,\" was the re ply. \" Yes,\" said the young conspirator ; \" perilous : because most of such plots have been foolishly con trived, and have embraced too many in the secret. He who goes about such a business, should beware of putting any man on his counsel.\"1 Under this idea, Gowrie admitted to his secret as few associates as possible ; and his accomplices were men on wdiom he had the most implicit reliance. They appear to have been only four in number : his brother, Alexander Ruthven, commonly called the Master of Ruthven, Avho held an office in the King's chamber ; Robert Logan of Restalrig, a Border ba ron, distantly connected Avith the Gowrie family ; a third person of rank and consequence, but Avhose name is still a mystery ; and, lastly, an old ruffian 1 Spottiswood, History, p. 460.

Logan Avas a man already known to Sir Robert Cecil ; who, on making some inquiries regarding him in 1599, re ceived from the celebrated Lord Wylloughby, then Governor of Berwick, this brief character of the Scot tish Border baron : \u2014 \" There is such a Laird of Les terligg, as you write of: a main loose man ; a great favourer of thieves reputed ; yet a man of a good clan, as they here term it ; and a good fellow.\"1 The character here given of Logan was far too favourable : for there is no doubt that he Avas a desperate, reck less, and unprincipled villain, although a person of a good house, and true to his friends, according to the principles of that Border code under which he had been bred. He had run through a large estate in every kind of dissipation and excess, Avas a mocker at religion, had been a constant folloAver of the noto rious BothAvell, and Avas noAv drowned in debt ; yet, bad as he was, Laird BoAArer, his brother-conspirator, his chamberlain, or household man, as he termed him, appears to haATe been a shade blacker. It was to this old Borderer that the perilous task was com mitted, of carrying the letters Avhich passed betAveen Logan and GoAvrie. Bower had received his nurture and education in the service of David Hume of Man derston, commonly called \" Davie the Devil ;\" and in this Satanic school had become a more debauched and daring ruffian than his master ; Avho described him, in writing to GoAvrie, as a worthy fellow, who 1 MS.

Avould not spare to ride to Hell's yett to pleasure him.1 Of the character of the other unknown conspirator, nothing can be said, as his name remains yet a sha doAv. But if Ave may trust to popular report, Alex ander, the Master of RutliATen, was a young man of the highest promise ; amiable, accomplished, gentle almost to a fault, and a universal faArourite at Court ; yet, strange as it may appear, the execution of that part of the plot requiring the utmost sternness, promptitude, and decision, Avas committed to this youth. He it AATas on Avhom his brother laid the task of decoying the King into Gowrie House, and forcing him into the boat ; whilst Gowrie himself un dertook to amuse or intimidate the suite ; and Logan was to have his house of Fastcastle ready to receive the royal prisoner. Both these mansions, Gowrie House and Fast castle, were, from their construction and situation, singularly-well calculated for the attempt against the King. The first was a large baronial mansion, of quadrangular shape, built in the town of Perth, and on the border of the Tay, the river washing the gar den ; and fortified by a wall Avdiich ran along the bank, and was flanked by two strong towers. Its apartments Avere numerous ; arranged, as was usual in those times, en suite, and so as to communicate with each other ; and amongst them Avas a long gal lery, Avhich extended along one side of the square, and communicated, by a door at the end, with a chamber which, in its turn, led to a small circular 1 Logan to Gowrie, in Pitcairn's Criminal Trials, vol. ii. p. 285."], [357, "1600. 333 JAMES VI. room constructed in the interior of a turret. This gallery, and the other apartments, were accessible by a broad oaken staircase ; but the turret, or round room, could be reached also by a back spiral turn pike : so that a person wdio had entered it through the gallery, might escape, or could be conveyed away Avithout again traversing the principal stair case. Fastcastle, the residence or den of Logan, Avas the very opposite of GoAvrie House ; being a single square and massive feudal toAver, standing- on the brink of a steep and almost perpendicular black rock, Avhich rose to the height of two hundred feet above the German Ocean. From the sea, it was completely inaccessible, unless to those who kneAV the secret of its steps cut in the rock, and could unlock the iron bolts and doors Avhich defended them ; and on the land side, the isthmus on which it stood Avas connected Avith the mainland by so narroAV a neck, that any attempt to force its little drawbridge was hopeless. The distance from GoAvrie House to Fastcastle, by sea, was about seventy miles ; from Fastcastle to the English Bor der, about tAventy-five miles. It is now time to introduce the reader to the most interesting part of this strange story : the letters of the conspirators themselves. It appears from these documents, which were not discoATered until many years after the deep tragedy in which the conspiracy concluded, that early in the month of July 1600, Gowrie Avrote to Logan appointing a secret meeting, to confer \" on the purpose he kneiv of.\" This letter"], [358, "334 1600.

It was in these terms : \u2014 \" Right Honourable Sir, \u2014 My duty with service remembered.

Their import can not be mistaken ; their authenticity has never been questioned ; they still exist ;3 and although they do not open up all the particulars of the intended attempt, they establish the reality of the Gowrie conspiracy beyond the possibility of a doubt. The first proves that the Master of Ruthven and Logan had set doAvn the course or plot for the preferment of Gowrie and the revenge of his father's death ; that the conspirators Avere to meet at Fastcastle ; and that they had fixed \" the King's hunting \" as the most favourable time 1 Difficult to shoe behind ; not to be trusted. 2 Grey Steil, a popular name of Gowrie's father, taken from an old romance, called \" Grey-Steil.\" 3 In the General Register House, Edinburgh."], [368, "344 1600. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. for their attempt. Logan, it is seen from the same letter, did not think his brother, Lord Home, or Gowrie's old tutor, Mr William Rhynd, by any means safe persons to be intrusted with the secret of the conspiracy. In the second letter to Bower, Ave have a glance at the rich bribe by wdiich Gowrie had secured the assistance of Logan, the estate of Dirlton ; and in the third, his resolution to keep his promise \" although the scaffold were set up,\" with his expectation to have speedy intimation sent him of the precise day Avhen the attempt Avas to be made, and his presence required at St Johnston. Logan's letter to GoAvrie is still more minute. It contains the determination to revenge the Machiavelian mas sacre of their dearest friends ; the intended rendez vous of the associates at Fastcastle, who, under the mask of a pleasure party by sea, were to be con veyed into that stronghold ; the previous secret con ference to be held at Restalrig over their \" hattit kit and wine ;\" the good cheer and happy success which the King's buck-hunting AATas to bring them ; the solemn and earnest injunctions of secrecy, \u2014 life and lands, name and fame, hanging on the issue ; the allusion to the strange tale of Padua, so similar to their present purpose, that it seems to have haunted the \" consety \" or high-wrought imagination of Mr Alexander Ruthven ; the necessity of destroying their letters : all this is contained in Logan's letter to Gowrie himself ; and in his last letter to the unknown con spirator, Ave have the direction how the signal is to be given at sea to those Avho were to be on the look out from Fastcastle; the exultation and joy at"], [369, "1600. 345 JAMES VI. GoAvrie's frankness and forwardness ; the last con sultation appointed to be at Fastcastle ; Logan's candid character of himself, as utterly unable to abide all arguments from religion ; his exhortations to be speedy, and his anticipation of a glorious re venge for the death of \" Grey Steil,\" the affectionate sobriquet or nickname of the late Earl of Gowrie. All this is so clearly established by the correspon dence, and so completely proAres the existence of GoAvrie's plot for the surprise of the King, and the meeting of the conspirators at Fastcastle, that he Avho doubts must be too desperate in his scepticism to be reached by any evidence AAThatever. But Ave must proceed. This last letter of Logan's was written on Thurs day, the 31st July ; and all that passed in the secret conclave of the conspirators, during the three succeed ing days, till the night of Monday the fourth of August, is a blank. On that night Gowrie called his chamberlain, AndreAV Henderson, into his bed-cham ber, and commanded him to be ready to ride on the morrow early with his brother, the Master, to Falk land, and to bring back with speed any letter, or message, which he might receive from him.1 The morning of Tuesday, the 5th of August, found the King and his nobles in the great park at Falk land, ready to mount on horseback, and proceed to their sport. It Avas still early, between six and seven o'clock : all Avas bustle and preparation ; and the King 1 Henderson's Declaration, Pitcairn's Criminal Trials, vol. ii. p. 175."], [370, "346 1600. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. stood beside the stables surrounded by his hounds and huntsmen, when Alexander Ruthven, Gowrie's younger brother, came up, and, with a low courtesy, kneeling and uncovering, craved a moment's private audience on matter of the utmost moment. His expression was perturbed, his manner hurried ; and the King, expecting a communication of importance, walked aside with him. Ruthven then declared, that he, the evening before, had met a suspicious looking fellow Avithout the walls of St Johnston, Avith his face muffled in a cloak ; and, perceiving him to be terrified and astonished when questioned, he had seized him, and, on searching, had found a large pot-full of gold pieces under his cloak. This trea sure, with the man Avho carried it, he had secured, he said, in a small chamber in Gowrie House ; and he iioav begged the King to ride with him to Perth on the instant, and make sure of it for himself, as he had not even revealed the discovery to his brother the Earl. James at first disclaimed having any right to money thus found ; but when the Master, to one of his questions, stated that it seemed foreign gold, the vision of crowns of the sun and Spanish priests rose to the royal suspicion ; and he Avas about to despatch some servant of his own, to ride instantly Avith a warrant to the Provost, and seize the treasure, when Ruthven strongly protested against it ; declaring that if either the magistrates or Gowrie got their fingers on the gold, it might chance that very feAV pieces Avould ever come into his Majesty's purse ; and that all that he implored, in recompense for his fidelity, Avas that the"], [371, "1600. 347 JAMES VI. King Avould ride Avith him to Perth, see the treasure, and judge with his oavh eyes. The Court was now on horseback; the morning wear ing on ; the baying of the hounds, and cheering of the huntsmen, told that the game was found ; and the King, impatiently putting an end to the intervieAv, promised Ruthven an answer after he had killed the buck. James then galloped off ; but the story haunted him ; and on the first check, he sent for Ruthven, Avho lin gered near at hand, and Avhispered to him, that he had resolved, the moment the chase Avas over, to accom pany him to Perth. The young man instantly de spatched Andrew Henderson, the chamberlain, who, in obedience to GoAvrie's orders the night before, had, Avith Andrew Ruthven, accompanied him to Falk land ; bidding him gallop to Perth, and tell Gowrie that the King would be there within a brief space, and slenderly attended. When the chase Avas ended, Avhich lasted till near eleven, the King surprised his courtiers by telling them he meant to ride immediately to St Johnston, to speak with the Earl of Gowrie ; and without giving himself or his nobles time to send for fresh horses, or waiting, as was usual, for the \" curry of the deer,\"1 he rode off with Ruthven at so furious a pace, that he was some miles on the road before Lennox, or any of his suite, overtook him. All this time Ruthven had been agitated and restless ; now press ing the King to finish the chase ; now urging him not to wait for fresh horses ; iioav insisting that neither Lennox, Mar, nor any number of his nobles should 1 French, curer; tocleanse; the ripping up and cleansing the deer."], [372, "348 1600. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. folloAV him, as it might spoil all ; and this to such a degree that James, as he pushed on, began to suspect and hesitate, and calling Lennox aside, told him the strange errand he was riding on ; asking- him if Ruth- ven, his brother-in-law, had ever shown any symp- toms of derangement. The Duke pronounced the story utterly improbable ; but affirmed he had never seen anything like madness in Ruthven. \" At all events,\"said James, \"do not you, Lennox, fail to follow me into the room where this fellow and his treasure is.\" This private conference Avas not unobserved by Ruthven. He had a short time before despatched his other servant, Andrew Ruthven, to ride forward with a second message to Perth, and noAv coming up close to the King, implored him to make none living- acquainted with their purpose, till he had himself seen the fellow and the treasure. It seems to have been at this moment that Sir Thomas Erskine, who had overtaken the King on the road, privately asked Lennox Iioav it came that Ruthven had got the King's ear, and carried off his Majesty from his sport ; to which Lennox jocularly answered, \" Peace man ; we shall all be turned into gold.\"1 The Avhole party then rode forward ; and on coming within a mile of Perth, Ruthven, telling the King he must give warning to his brother, galloped on before. We must noAv for a moment turn to Gowrie, whom Henderson, on his arrival at Gowrie House, found, with tAvo friends, in his chamber. He instantly left them, and inquired, secretly and earnestly, Avhat word he had brought from his brother : had he sent a letter ; Iioav 1 Lloyd's Worthies, p. 783."], [373, "1600. JAMES VI. 349 had the King taken Avith the Master ; Avho AATere with his Majesty at the hunting, many or feAV ; Avhat noble men, what names ? To these hurried questions Hen derson ansAvered by giving the message sent by young Ruthven : that the King would be Avith him inconti nent, and he must prepare dinner. He added, that James had received the Master kindly, and laid his hand on his shoulder when he did his courtesy : that his Majesty had sundry of his own suite with him, and some Englishmen ; and that the only nobleman he noticed Avas my Lord Duke. This was at ten o'clock.1 Henderson then Avent to his own house, pulled off his boots, and returned to Gowrie House about eleven, when the earl commanded him to put on his \" secret? and plate sleeves,\" as he would require his assistance to seize a Highlandman in the Shoe Gate. At half past twelve GoAvrie took his dinner, having, as his guests, three friends of the neighbourhood ; and as they sat at table, AndreAV Ruthven, the Master's second messenger, entered the room, and AAThispered to the earl. Soon after came the Master himself, upon Avhich Gowrie and his friends rose ; and now for the first time openly alluding to the royal visit, he assem bled his servants, and Avalked to the Inch or meadow near the town, where he met the King. James' train did not exceed twelve or fifteen per sons, including Lennox, Mar, Sir Thomas Erskine, John Ramsay his page, Dr Hugh Herries, Lords Lindores and Inchaffray, Avith a feAV others. They 1 Henderson's Declaration, Pitcairn's Crim. Trials, vol, ii. p. 176'. 2 A secret shirt of mail worn under the clothes."], [374, "350 1600. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Avore their green hunting-dresses, and were Avholly without armour ; a horn slung over their shoulder, and a sword or deer-knife at their girdle, being all they carried. Cowrie's servants and followers amounted nearly to fourscore ; but many of these must have been townsmen and lookers on. On coming to Gowrie House the King called for a drink, and was somewhat annoyed at having to wait long for his welcome cup, and more than an hour for his dinner. During this interval Alexander Ruthven sent for the key of the long room, called the Gallery Chamber, which imme diately adjoined the cabinet where the King dined. At the end of this gallery was another apartment, Avhich opened into a circular room, formed in the interior of a turret ; and this room, it is important to observe, could be entered, not only by the door at the end of the gallery, but by another door communicating Avith a back stair or turnpike, called the Black Turn pike. Soon after the King had sat doAvn to dinner, Gowrie, Avho waited upon him, sent for Henderson, and taking him aside secretly, bade him go to his brother in the gallery. He obeyed ; found Mr Alexander there, and almost instantly after was joined by the Earl himself, who commanded him to remain Avhere he was, and obey the Master's orders.1 Henderson was now fully armed, all except the head : he had noted that the tale about seizing a Highland thief in the Shoe Gate was a false pretence; and be ginning to suspect some treason, asked, in an agitated tone, \"What they Avere about to do with him?\" 1 Henderson's Declaration, Pitcairn, vol. ii. p. 177."], [375, "1600. 351 JAMES VI. The only reply of Gowrie and the Master was to point to the little chamber, make him enter the door, and lock him up. All this occupied but a few minutes, and Gowrie then returned to the King, who was sitting at his dessert ; Avhilst the Duke and the rest of his suite Avere dining in the next room. They had nearly finished their repast, when James, in a bantering manner, accused Gowrie of having been so long in foreign parts as to have forgotten his Scot tish courtesies. \" Wherefore, my Lord,\" said he, \" since ye have neglected to drink either to me or my nobles, Avho are your guests, I must drink to you my own Avelcome. Take this cuj>, and pledge them the King's scoll1 in my name.\" Gowrie, accordingly, calling for wine, joined the Duke and his fellows, who were getting up from table ; and at this instant Alexander Ruthven seizing the moment when the King was alone, whispered him that noAv was the time to go. James, rising up, bade him call Sir Thomas Erskine ; but he evaded the message, and Erskine never received it. Lennox, too, remember ing the King's injunctions, spoke of following his majesty ; but Gowrie prevented him, saying, his Highness had retired on a quiet errand, and would not be disturbed ;2 after which, he opened the door leading to his pleasure-ground, and with Lennox, Lindores, and some others, passed into the garden. Thus really cut off from assistance, but believing that he would be followed by Lennox or Erskine, James 1 The King's scoll ; the King's health. 2 Lennox's Declaration, Pitcairn, vol. ii. p. 172."], [376, "1600- 352 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. noAv folloAved Ruthven up a stair, and through a suite of various chambers, all of them opening into each other, the Master locking every door as they passed ; and observing, Avith a smile, that now they had the felloAv sure enough. At last they entered the small round room already mentioned. On the Avail hung a picture Avith a curtain before it ; beside it stood a man in armour; and as the King started back in alarm, Ruthven locked the door, put on his hat, drew the dagger from the side of the armed man, and tearing the curtain from the picture, shoAved the Avell-known features of the late Earl of GoAvrie, his father. \" Whose face is that?\" said he, advanc- ing the dagger Avith one hand to the King's breast, and pointing Avith the other to the picture. \" Who murdered my father? Is not thy conscience bur- dened by his innocent blood? Thou art iioav my prisoner, and must be content to follow our will, and to be used as we list.

Ruthven consented ; commanded Hender son to keep the King at his peril ; and left the room, locking the door behind him. James now7, for a moment, had time to breathe ; and turning to Henderson, he asked him Iioav he came there. The unhappy man declared he had been shut in like a dog. Would Gowrie do him any mischief? Henderson ansAvered he should die first. \" Open the Avindow, then,\" said James ; and scarce had this been done, or rather when it Avas being done, Ruthven broke into the room again, and swearing there was no remedy, ran in upon the King, seized him by the Avrists, and attempted to bind him with a garter or silk cord which he had in his hands. James, by a strong effort, threw himself loose, exclaiming, he was a free Prince, and would never be bound ; and Hen derson at this moment wrenching aAvay the cord, the King \" leapt free,\" and had almost reached the win- 1 What racks ; what forbids.

But James now rendered desperate, and exerting his utmost strength, dragged his assailant to the window, and throAving his head half out, though Ruthven's hand was still on his throat, cried out, \" Treason ! help ! Earl of Mar, I am murdered !\" Ruthven then dragged him back into the chamber, upbraiding Henderson as a coAvardly villain, Avho would bring death upon them all, and attempted to draw his sword, Avhich James prevented by grasping his right hand.1 Henderson during this, unlocked the door of the room, and then stood trembling and panic-struck, whilst a desperate Avrestle continued between the King and Ruthven. Leaving James in this struggle for life, we must turn for an instant to GoAvrie, Avho had led Lennox and the other courtiers into the garden. Whilst there, Cranston, one of his attendants, ran up, and informed them that the King had left the castle by the back way, and was riding over the Inch, upon Avhich Gowrie called to horse ; and he, Lennox, and the rest, hurrying down the great staircase, and shouting for their horses, some one asked the porter in the court-yard, if the King had passed. He de clared he had not ; and insisted in his denial, although his master abused him as a lying varlet. GoAvrie, upon this, ran back into the house, observing to Mar, he would ascertain the truth ; and returning within a feAV minutes, assured them that the King had really 1 Henderson's Declaration in Pitcairn, vol. ii. p. 178."], [379, "1600, 355 JAMES VI. gone forth, and must iioav have reached the South Inch. Scarcely, however, was this falsehood uttered, Avhen it Avas confuted ; for, at this moment, James' loud cry of treason and murder was heard ; and, looking up, they saw the King's face at the window of the turret, the features red and flushed with exer tion, and a hand on his throat.1 All was iioav horror and confusion. Sir Thomas Erskine collared Gowrie, exclaiming, \" Traitor, thou shalt die ! This is thy work ! \" but was felled to the ground by Andrew Ruthven, Avhilst Gowrie asserted his innocence. Lennox's first impulse was to save the King ; and he, Mar, and some others, rushed up the great stair case to the hall ; but finding the door locked, began to batter it with a ladder which lay hard by.2 John Ramsay, one of the royal suite, was more fortunate. He remembered the back entry ; and running SAviftly up the turnpike stair to the top, dashed open the door of the round chamber with his foot, and found himself in the presence of the King and Ruth ven, who were wrestling in the middle of the cham ber. James, Avith Ruthven's head under his arm, had thrown him down almost on his knees, whilst the Master still grasped the King's throat.3 Ram say was hampered by a hawk, a favourite bird of James', which he held on his wrist ; but throwing her off, and drawing his whinger,4 he made an inef- 1 Lennox's Declaration, Pitcairn, vol. ii. p. 173.

The King making a strong effort, pushed him backwards through the door, down the stairs; and, at this moment, Sir Thomas Erskine and Dr Herries rushing up the turnpike, and encountering the unhappy youth, bleeding, and staggering upon the steps, despatched him Avith their swords. As he lay in his last agony, he turned his face to them, and said, feebly, \" Alas ! I had not the wyte o't.\"2 All this passed so rapidly, that Ramsay had only time to catch a glance of a figure in armour, standing near the King, but motionless. When he next looked, it had disappeared. This seeming apparition was Hen derson, still trembling, and in amazement, from the scene he had Avitnessed; but who, seeing the door open, glided doAvn the turnpike, and, as it turned out, fled instantly from the house ; passing, in his flight, over the Master's dead body.3 At this moment, as Erskine and Ramsay were congratulating the King, a neAV tumult Avas heard at the end of the gallery ; and they had scarcely time to hurry James into the adjoining chamber, Avhen GoAvrie himself, furious from passion, and armed Avith a rapier in each hand, rushed along the gallery, followed by seven of his servants, Avith drawn sAvords. His vengeance had 1 Pyne doublet; a concealed shirt of mail worn under the clothes. 2 I had not the blame of it. 3 Henderson's Declaration, Ramsay's Declaration, and Sir Thomas Erskine's Declaration, all printed in Pitcairn, vol. ii. p. 175-184 inclusive."], [381, "1600. JAMES VI. 357 been roused to the utmost pitch, by his having stumbled over the bleeding body of his brother ; and swearing a dreadful oath that the traitors who had murdered him should die, he threAV himself despe- rately upon Erskine and his companions, who were all Avounded in the first onset, and fought at great odds, there being eight to four.1 Yet the victory Avas not long doubtful ; for, some one calling out that the King was slain, Gowrie, as if paralysed with horror, dropt the points of his Aveapons, and Ramsay, throwing himself within his guard, passed his sword through his body, and slew him on the spot. The servants, seeing their master fall, gave Avay, and were driven out of the gallery ; and Len- nox, Mar, and the rest, Avho Avere still thundering Avith their hammers on the outside of the great door, having made themselves known to the King and his friends Avithin, Avere joyfully admitted. So effec- tually, however, had Ruthven secured this door, that it Avas only by passing a hammer through one of the shattered boards, and with it forcibly wrenching off the lock, that their entrance was effected. The first thing that met their eyes was the dead body of GoAArrie lying on the floor, and the King standing- unharmed beside it, although still breathless from the recent struggle, and disordered in his dress. At this moment, Graham of Balgone, one of the gentle men who had accompanied the King from Falkland, 1 Thomas' Robertson's Declaration, ritcairn, vol. ii. p. 1 9G ; also, Ibid., 197, Ramsay's Declaration, Ibid., 183, 184 ; and Sir Thomas Erskine's Declaration, Ibid., p. 182; William Robertson's Declaration, Ibid., p. 197-"], [382, "1000. 358 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. found a silk garter lying amongst the bent, or rough grass with which the floor of the round chamber was covered ; and James immediately recognised it as the same with which Ruthven had attempted to bind his hands.1 The King then knelt doAvn, and, surrounded by his nobles, who were all on their knees, devoutly thanked God for his deliverance ; and prayed that the life which had been thus signally preserved, might be devoted to the welfare of his people. Scarcely, hoAvever, had they risen from their act of gratitude, Avhen a neAV danger began to threaten them. The city bell Avas heard ringing, mingled Avith shouts and cries of vengeance, from an im mense mob who beset the out,side of Gowrie House, and threatened to blow it up, and bury them in the ruins. Andrew Ruthven and Violet Ruthven, two near relatives of the family of Gowrie, had been busy in rousing the citizens ; and, running wildly through the streets, vented curses and maledictions on \" the bloody butchers\" Avho had murdered their young Pro vost and his brother. Nor did many spare to threaten the King himself ; crying out, \" Come doAvn, come doAvn, thou son of Seignor Davie ! thou hast slain a better man than thyself. Come down, green coats, thieves and traitors ! limmers that have slain these innocents. May God let never nane o' you have such plants of your ain !\"2 Amid this hubbub, and storm of lamentation and vengeance, James ordered the magistrates to be admitted into the house ; and 1 Grahame's Declaration, Pitcairn's Criminal Trials, vol. ii. p. 184 ; also, p. 217. 2 Ibid., vol. ii. pp. 197, 198, 199."], [383, "1000. 359 JAMES VI. having informed them of all that had happened, com manded them to silence the alarum-bell, and quiet the people on their peril ; which they at last with diffi culty effected. He then ordered them to take care of the dead bodies ; and on searching GoAvrie's per son, there was found in the pocket of his doublet, a little parchment bag full of \" magical characters and words of enchantment,\" which his tutor, Rhynd, re cognised as the same he had discoA'ered him wearing at Padua.1 A belief in sorcery was, as is well known, universal in these days ; and such supersti tious credit did both King and people give to the little bag of cabalistic words, that they insisted that no blood had issued from the wound till the spell was removed from the body, after Avhich it gushed out profusely. James now took horse, and, although it Avas already eight in the evening, rode to Falkland amid croAvds of his subjects, who poured in from all quar ters to testify their joy at his escape. Next day, the news having been brought to Edinburgh, nothing could exceed the enthusiastic demonstrations of the city; and the same scene Avas repeated, with still louder and more affectionate Avelcome, when the King, after a brief retirement at Falkland, passed over the Forth, and entered his capital. The Cross was hung Avith tapestry ; the whole city, led by the judges and magistrates, met him on the sands at Leith ; and 1 Declaration of Rhynd, Pitcairn's Criminal Trials, vol. ii. pp. 218, 219, 220."], [384, "360 1600.

The general gratulation manifested at the escape of the King from the treason of Gowrie, Avas not with- out its alloy. Though almost all believed in the reality of the conspiracy, a section of the Kirk de- murred and doubted ; and as the death of both the brothers had involved the particulars of the plot in extreme obscurity, the ministers not only declared it questionable that any treason had been intended, but, after a Avhile, started the extravagant theory that the plot was a conspiracy of the King against GoAvrie, not of Gowrie against the King. To examine or refute this hypothesis, after the facts Avhich have been given, Avould be Avorse than idle ; and we are not to be surprised that the incredulity of the Kirk should have incensed the King. But James adopted an unwise mode of refutation. Instead of simply insisting on the great features of the story, on the leading facts Avhich Avere indisputably proved by"], [386, "362 1600. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the evidence of Lennox, Mar, Erskine, and Ramsay, and throwing aside all minor matters and apparent contradictions, Avhich, considering the rapidity, terror, and tumult accompanying the event, confirmed rather than weakened the proof; he forgot his dignity ; held repeated conferences with the recusant ministers ; argued, cavilled, remonstrated, and attempted in Arain to explain and reconcile every minute particu lar. The effect of all this was precisely what might have been anticipated : Mr Robert Bruce, and his little sceptical conclave of brethren, were quite as ingenious in their special pleading as the King ; and not only obstinately refused to accuse Gowrie in their pulpits of any plot against the royal person, but in solently insinuated that their two favourites had been murdered. James, finding them immoveable, banished them from the capital ; and interdicted them, under pain of death, from preaching- in any part of Scotland. This severity brought four of the recusants, Balcan quel, Watson, Hall, and Balfour, to reason ; and they declared themselves thoroughly satisfied of the truth of GoAvrie's treason. But Bruce Avas inexorable. He considered that the question involved not only the truth of the conspiracy, but the spiritual inde pendence of the Kirk ; peremptorily refused to excul pate the King, or believe in his report; and was banished to France.1 Extreme measures were then adopted against the family of Ruthven; and in a Parliament Avhich assembled in the succeeding month of November, the revolting spectacle was exhibited 1 Spottiswood, p. 461."], [387, "1600. 363 JAMES VI. of the trial for treason of the livid corpses of these unhappy brothers; Avhich, after the doom of forfeiture had been pronounced, Avere hauled to the gibbet, hanged and quartered. Their quarters Avere then ex posed in the most conspicuous places of Perth, Stirling, and Dundee, and their heads fixed on the top of the prison in Edinburgh. Nor was the ignominy heaped upon the dead greater than the severity against the living. An attempt was made, on the very night of the catastrophe, to seize the two younger brothers of the house, Avho, at the time, were living Avith their unhappy mother at Dunkeld ; but a vague report of danger had reached her, and they had escaped in disguise, accompanied by their tutor, who brought them in safety to Berwick.1 On the King's return to Falkland, on the night of the 5th of August, the sister of Gowrie, Mrs Beatrix Ruthven, avIio was maid of honour to the Queen, was dismissed and banished from Court. By an Act of the same Parlia ment which inflicted the forfeiture, the very name of Ruthven was abolished ; and the brethren and pos terity of the house of Gowrie declared to be for ever incapable of enjoying inheritance, place, or dignity, in Scotland. Such Avas the avidity with which the favourites of the Court sought, for their own profit, to hunt down this ill-fated family, and fulfil the stern wishes of the King, that but for the gener ous protection of England, not a male of the house of Ruthven would have been left. 1 MS.

The relations betAveen Elizabeth and James, pre vious to the conspiracy, had been, we have seen, far from friendly ; and this connivance of the Queen at the concealment of the young Ruthvens, Avith other suspicious reports which arose immediately after the catastrophe, created a strong impression in the mind of the King that the plot had been fostered in England. It Avas remembered that Gowrie had been admitted, immediately previous to the attempt, into the most intimate confidence of the English Queen ; it was ob served that Rhynd, Gowrie's tutor, had been found de stroying letters at the moment he was apprehended ; it was reported that Nicolson, the English resident at Edinburgh, had been seen waiting, early on the morning of the 6th of August, on the shore at Leith, and had whispered to a friend who had betrayed his secret, that he was expecting strange news from the other side of the water. The Earl of Mar accused Lord Wylloughby, the Governor of BerAvick, to the King, as being privy to the plot ; but his only evi dence seems to have been Wylloughby's intimacy Avith Gowrie at the Court of England ; and this high minded and brave soldier deeming his character far above such suspicion, did not condescend to confute the charge.1 All these things, however, made an impression. When Nicolson assured the King of his devout thankfulness for his escape, the only answer he received, was an incredulous smile from James ; 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off., Nicolson to Cecil, 6th August, 1600. Id. Ibid., 11th August, 1600. MS. Letter, St. P. Off., B.C., Lord Wylloughby to Cecil."], [389, "1600. 365 JAMES VI. and many of the highest rank in Scotland, and best entitled to credit, persisted in tracing the whole con spiracy to England. Many, on the other hand, in sisted on the total want of all direct eAridcnce of GoAvrie's guilt ; and as the letters of Logan of Res talrig had not then come to light, it Avas difficult to con fute such sceptics. Cranston, Craigengelt, and Baron, all of them servants of GoAvrie, Avho Avere executed for their participation in the enterprise, had been exa mined by torture ; and both in the agony of the \" boots,\" and afterwards on the scaffold, confessed nothing Avhich could implicate their unhappy master or themselves ; and the letters of Nicolson, Lord Scrope, and Sir William Bowes, made little scruple of throwing the chief guilt upon the King. Amid all this obscurity, recrimination, and conjec ture, James despatched Captain Preston to carry an account of his escape to Elizabeth ; and she, in her turn, sent down Sir Harry Brunker Avith a singular letter, written Avholly in her own hand, which began Avith congratulations, and concluded in a tone of mingled menace and reproach. Her anger had been raised on a subject which never failed to produce in her mind unusual excitement \u2014 James' intrigues as to the succession ; and after a feAV lines on her joy at his escape, she attacked him in the follow ing bitter terms on his impatience for her death, and the indecent haste of his preparations : \u2014 \" And tho a King I be, yet hath my funerals been prepared, as I hear, long ere, I suppose, their labour shall be needful ; and do hear too much of that daily,"], [390, "1600. 366 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. as I may have a good memorial that I am mortal : and withall so be they, too, that make such prepara tion aforehand ; AA'hereat I smile, supposing that such facts may make them readier for it than I. \" Think not but how wilily soever things be car ried, they are so Avell knoAvn that they may do more harm to others than to me.

It Avas mortifying enough to a princess clinging, as still she did, to the last remnant of life and glory, to know that 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off., Royal Letters, Scotland.

There is a remarkable paper preserved, in Avhich Ashfield gave his opinion to the Scottish King on the best mode of accomplish ing his great object ; and although no letters between James and Essex have been discovered, there seems to be little doubt that this unfortunate noble man, now a prisoner in the ToAver, had engaged to support the claim of the Scottish monarch with the whole weight of his influence. In his advices, Ashfield complimented James on the Avisdom and judgment which had distinguished his policy towards the State and people of England. It was a great matter, he observed, that none feared his future go vernment, or had taken offence at his person. He instructed him to employ every effort to gain the common laAvyers, who possessed the \" gainfullest\" offices ; were rich and politic men ; more feared than beloved by the people, yet very powerful in the State. He ought next, he said, to secure the clergy, who possessed the greatest influence in the universities ; Avere rich; and had most of the people, and many of the nobility and gentry, at their devotion. He should assure them that he had no intention of altering the state of religion, or their livings ; which, accord ing to the then computation of the parishes in Eng land, amounted to nine thousand seven hundred and twenty-seven. And if (Ashfield added) the"], [392, "368 1600. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. King declared his inclination to exempt them from the heavy taxes Avhich they noAv paid, it Avould go far to bring OATer the whole body to his service. He also advised the King to have let ters ready, at the time of Elizabeth's death, to some one or two of the chiefest \" men of command\" in every shire and corporation, and promised to procure him a list, not only of the names of such, but also of the collectors and tellers of the CroAvn rents in Eng land, to whom he might give speedy and .special directions, by gracious letters, and Avin them to his service. His last remark related to the \" citizens of London,\" a body of men whom he described as rich, strong, and well governed ; who would stand firm to the preservation of their wealth, and keep themselves neutral till they saw which of the competitors Avas likely to prove the strongest, and how the game Avould go.1 Immediately after the meeting of that Parliament, in November, in which the forfeiture of the GoAvries took place, some unhappy differences broke out be tween the King and his Queen ; this Princess hav ing shown a deeper commiseration for the Ruthven family than James approved of. Amongst the innu merable reports Avhich had arisen, after the catas trophe, it had been whispered that jealousy had lent its sting to the royal wrath. But although Anne of Denmark Avas sufficiently gay and thoughtless to give some ground for the imputation, the common story of her passion for the Master of Ruthven, seems 1 MS. Brit. Mus., Julius, F. vi. 133."], [393, "1600. 369 JAMES VI. to rest on nothing more than the merest rumour. She imprudently had given her countenance to that party at Court, which opposed the extreme severity of the King. It was reported that she had secretly sent for Beatrix Ruthven, and favoured her with a midnight interview in the palace. She suspected that intrigues Avere carrying on against her ; and, on one occasion, if we may believe Nicolson the Envoy of Elizabeth, Avas so far overcome by passion, that she openly upbraided James with a plot for her im prisonment ; and Avarned him that he Avould not find her so easy a prey as an Earl of GoAvrie. The pro bability, however, is, that all this Avas much exagge rated by the gossiping propensities of Nicolson : for the royal couple, whom he represented as on very evil terms on the 31st of October, had been de scribed in a letter, Avritten only tAvo days before, as exceedingly loving, and almost ultra-uxorious. x In the midst of this alternate matrimonial shade and sunshine, Anne gave birth to a prince, afterAvards the unfortunate Charles the First ; whose baptism Avas held, with great state and pageantry, on the 30th of December.2 Captain Preston, James' ambassador, now return ed from the Court of England, and brought a more amicable letter from the Queen than her former ironical epistle. In speaking of Gowrie's treason, she declared her fervent wishes, that \" the 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off., Nicolson to Cecil, 28th October, 1600. Also, Ibid., same to same, 31st October, 1600. 2 MS.

He revealed to her all the secret intel ligence he had received from Spain, and promised his utmost efforts to raise a force of two thousand High land soldiers, to act as auxiliaries Avith the English army in Ireland.2 When this proposal, however, afterwards came before the Convention of the three Estates, many of the Highlanders and Islesmen sternly refused to bear arms against the Irish ; a race to whom they Avere linked, they said, by common descent, and a common language ; whilst the Saxons, or English, whose battles they were to fight, had long been the bitter enemies, both of them selves and their Irish ancestors.

What negotiations had passed between this unfortunate nobleman and the King of Scots, it is extremely difficult to discover. No letters from Essex to Jame.s, or from the King to Essex, have been preserved ; at least none have been dis covered : and the assertion of Rapin, Avhich has been more or less copied by all succeeding English historians, that James wTas actually a fellow con spirator with him in his insane project for the seizure of the Queen's person, and that it Avas a part of their plot to dethrone Elizabeth and crown James, is utterly improbable, and supported by no evidence Avhatever. That the King, in common Avith all Avho knew him best, esteemed and admired Essex, and that Essex had Avritten to James after his return from Ireland, is, hoAAreArer, certain ; nor is it at all im probable that the English earl had laboured to estrange the Scottish monarch from Cecil, and to persuade him that the Secretary Avas an enemy to his claim, and favoured the title of the Infanta.

However this may be, the Scottish King, some time before the trial of Essex, had determined to communicate Avith Elizabeth, on some points where in he found himself aggrieved ; and he uoaat, Avith the vieAv of interceding for his gallant and unfortu nate friend, despatched to London tAvo Ambassadors, the Earl of Mar, one of his highest and most trusted nobles, and Mr EdAvard Bruce Abbot of Kinloss, a person of great judgment and experience.

His compassion, however, came too late ; for Essex Avas beheaded before the Ambas- sadors reached London. The original instructions for their mission have not been preserved ; but a letter of their royal master to Mar and Kinloss, written soon after their arrival, opens up to us much of its secret history. The real purpose for Avhich they Avent, Avas to feel the pulse of the English nobility and people on the great subject of the succession ; to se- cure friends ; to discoA-er and undermine opponents ; to conciliate the Queen, and, if possible, procure from her a more distinct recognition of James' title to the throne : aboAre all, to gain Secretary Cecil, who was iioav at the head of the English Government, and on whose friendly disposition James had long believed that everything depended. Many others had been forward in offering their assistance ; and to all he prudently gave a cordial reception ; but to Cecil alone he looked as the man Avho had the game in his hand, and whom he described in his letter of instructions as \" King there in effect.\" 2 1 MS.

From the coldness and jealousy of Elizabeth, she appeared to resent some expressions in the King's sealed letter, written Avholly in his oavii hand, and expostulating with her, in very decided terms, against her too easy belief of the unjust imputations so generally circulated against him. He declared that he Avas impelled by their long friendship and her own example, to unbosom his griefs, and not to suffer any misconstrued thoughts against her actions to take harbour in his heart ; for which purpose, having already experienced the mischief which both had suffered from the employment of in ferior diplomatic agents, he had now sent one of his highest nobles, the Earl of Mar, and one of his Avisest councillors, the Abbot of Kinloss ; both of them men of known and constant affection to the continuance of the amity between the two nations and their sove reigns ; and whom he had fully instructed to deal with all \"that honest plainness which was the un disseverable companion of true friendship.\" 1 Their plainness, however, seems to have been rather too much for the temper of Elizabeth, which, at no time very amiable, was now fretted and broken by her increasing infirmities. \" Her Majesty,\" said Cecil to Nicolson, \" gave the Earl of Mar nothing but negative ansAvers ; the matters being of so sour a March.

When the Ambassadors explained the great pecuniary embarrassments of their royal master, and his hopes that, having done so much to assist her against their common enemies, he now expected some return in current coin, she met the proposal Avith a haughty denial. She would give, she said, no ready money ; but, if he continued to deserve it, his pension should be augmented ; and in the meantime, it would be well if he, who boasted of his services against the common enemy, Avould cease all traffic with Spain, and receive less frequent messages from Rome. As to Lady Lennox's lands, which he claimed so confi dently, he should not receive a fraction of their rents ; his title to them, she thought, was still in nubibus; and till he made it out more clearly, the estates were in safe hands. For the other matters on which they had shown themselves so importunate, they were of too delicate and important a nature to be suddenly handled ; and she wondered, she said, at the boldness and perseverance with which they had press ed upon her, and dared to broach to her Council, so forbidding a subject.1 This, of course, alluded to the succession ; which, reminding her of the probability of her near dissolution, proved unpalateable in the ex treme : so that the Ambassadors wrote to the King in the lowest spirits, and strongly remonstrated with Se cretary Cecil on their strange reception. Nothing in the world, they said, in addressing this minister, but their 1 MS.

They must make bold to tell him, that there was a great difference between vigilancy and credulity ; and that it formed no part of Avisdom, \" ponere rumor es ante salutem.\"1 It is interesting to attend to the directions Avhich this unpromising state of things drew from the Scottish King. The Ambassadors, it Avould appear, had sought his instructions as to the terms in which they ought to leave the English Queen, if she con tinued in this unpropitious and distant temper. \" As to your doubt,\" said he, \" in Avhat sort to leaATe there,2 it must be according to the answer you receive to the former demands: for if ye be Avell satisfied therein, then must ye have a SAveet and kind parting ; but if ye get nothing but a flat and obstinate denial, which I do surely look for, then are ye, in both the parts of your commission, to behave yourself thus : \u2014 \" First, ye must be the more careful, since ye come so little speed in your public employment with the Queen, to set forward so much the more your private negotiation Avith the country ; and if ye see that the people be not in the highest point of discontentment, 1 MS.

Nor were his sentiments and instructions less sound with regard to Secretary Cecil, and those other powerful nobles whom he, at this time, suspected of hostility to his claim, and from whom he had expected better things. \" You shall plainly declare,\" said he, \"to Mr Secre tary and his folloAvers, that since noAv, when they are in their kingdom, they will thus misknow vie, when the chance shall turn I shall cast a deaf ear to their requests : and whereas now I would have been content to have given them, by your means, a preas surance of my favour, if at this time they had pressed to deserve the same; so noAvthey, contemning it, may be assured never hereafter to be heard, but all the Queen's hard usage of me to be hereafter craved at their hands.\"2 This last menace, however, was wholly unneces sary.

That moment had iioav arrived. Elizabeth's health was completely shattered ; and hoAvever earnestly she struggled to conceal the truth from herself, or to assume her usual gaiety before her people, it was but too evident that after her long and proud Avalk of glory and .strength, her feet were beginning to stumble upon the dark mountain, and that the time could not be very far distant Avhen the silver cord must be loosed and the golden boAvl be broken. With this prospect before him, Cecil opened, with extraordinary caution, and the most solemn injunctions and oaths of conceal ment,1 a negotiation with Mar and Kinloss; and James, who had hitherto suspected him, not only Avelcomed the advances, but soon gave him his full confidence, and intrusted everything to his manage ment and address. How all this Avas effected, what were the steps which led from distrust to reconcilia tion, and from this to undoubting and almost exclu sive confidence, cannot be ascertained ; but two facts are certain and full of meaning : the first, that Cecil, as appears by a paper preserved at Hatfield, advanced ten thousand pounds out of his owsl pocket 1 Hailes' Secret Correspondence of Sir R. Cecil, pp. 190, 191 ; also, pp. 202, 203."], [404, "1601. 380 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. to James, which was neArer repaid ; the second, that this able diplomatist, from being first minister to Elizabeth, upon the death of his mistress stepped at once, Avithout question or opposition, into the same high office under James. MeanAvhile the Scottish Ambassadors profited by this secret influence; and acting under the instructions of one who had the deepest insight into the character of the Queen and the state of the country, were able to folloAV out their instructions with infinitely greater success than on their first arrival. After a residence of three months in England,1 they returned to James in the beginning- 0f Jnne \u2022 anc[ although all had not succeeded to the extent of his wishes, the assurances Avhich they brought from Elizabeth Avere friendly and encouraging. She expressed her astonishment, in deed, that the King should have again pressed upon her the same disagreeable matter, on Avhich she had hoped he Avas already satisfied. It was a bold thing, she said, for any subject of hers to communicate with the King of Scots on so great a cause, Avithout her privity ; and he had done Avell to address her openly : for he might assure himself that she alone could do him good : all byways would turn to dust and smoke. As to his griefs, to Avhich he alluded in his letter, her conscience acquitted her of every ac tion Avhich should give him the slightest annoyance ; yet she took it kindly that be bad unbosomed them, and had sent her so \"well-chosen a couple\" as Mar and Kinloss.

To these dangers, threatening England from Avithout, was added the deep discontent of the people at home ; Avho Avere groaning under that monstrous and op- pressive system of monopolies, Avhich had raised the prices of all the necessaries of life to an exorbitant amount. By a monopoly Ave are to understand a royal patent, AAdiich conveyed to some individual the right of exclusively selling any particular commodity; and the poAver of granting such, the Queen claimed, and justly, as a part of her royal prerogative. But she had now carried the practice to a grinding and ruinous extent. The patentee, if he did not exercise the privilege himself, disposed of it to another ; and, in either case, all inferior venders, whether in whole- sale or retail, Avere compelled to pay him a high yearly premium, Avhich, of course, fell eventually on the consumer. This abuse had gone on increasing since the seventeenth year of the Queen's reign ; Avho had found it a convenient way of paying a debt, or satisfying- an importunate courtier or creditor, Avith- out drawing upon her OAvn privy purse, or risking her popularity by direct taxation.1 It Avas to the deep and general discontent occasioned by this, that King James had alluded in his secret instructions to Mar and Kinloss, when he advised them to discover Avhether the impatience and disgust of the country had increased to such a height that they were un- 1 Lingard's History of England, vol. viii. p. 380."], [407, "1601. 383 JAMES VI. willing to keep on terms any longer with Prince or State. In which case, he observed, it would be a pity not to declare himself openly in their favour, or to suffer them to be overthroAvn for lack of good back ing:1 a sentence, by the Avay, which proves that Elizabeth had good ground for her jealousy of the intrigues of the Scottish King with her subjects. But on the arrival of Mar and Kinloss, they soon discoA'ered that the execrations of the people Avere directed rather against the Minister Cecil and the Government, than against the Queen herself; and when Parliament met, and the subject of the Irish Avar Avas brought before the Commons, it was soon seen that they kneAv perfectly how to make this dis tinction. The safety of the country and the honour of the Queen demanded that they should make every sacrifice to bring the Irish war to a speedy and suc cessful termination; and for this purpose they agreed to one of the largest grants that had been given during this long reign ; voting at once four subsidies, and eight tenths and fifteenths, for the expense of the war : 2 but on the odious grievance of monopolies they were firm. Cecil's coach, in going to parliament, had been surrounded by an infuriated mob, which assailed him with curses, and threatened to tear him to pieces. It Avas time, therefore, to take the alarm ; and the Queen, who, however obstinate Avith her ministers, never struggled beyond the proper point Avith her people, sent for the speaker of the Com mons, and declared her resolution to abolish the 1 Hailes' Secret Correspondence, pp. 2, 3. 2 Ibid., p. 25."], [408, "384 1601-2.

Avhole system.1 This announcement Avas received with the utmost joy ; the Queen regained her popu larity; and soon after this, the total defeat of Tyrone and his Spanish auxiliaries, the successful termination of the war in Ireland, and the destruction of the Span ish galleys, under Spinola, by a combined squadron of the English and Dutch, shed a farewell ray of glory over the last year of her reign. It Avas iioav no longer necessary for Elizabeth to court the assistance of James, or to keep in pay the hardy mercenaries of the Scottish Isles : her kingdom was at peace ; and re suming her progresses and her gaieties, she struggled to overcome or defy her increasing infirmities ; rode to the chase ; had country dances in the Privy Chamber ; selected a new favourite, in the young Earl of Clanricard ; and seemed Avholly given up to disport, at a time when it Avas apparent to every one that her hours had been far better spent in retirement from the world, and preparation for that last scene, Avhich the greatest Prince, as well as the meanest subject, must act alone.2 There had been some expectation in Scotland that the question of the succession Avas to have been agi tated in the late Parliament ; and the arrival of James' favourite, the Duke of Lennox, at the Court of England, at the moment of its being assembled, seems to have excited the suspicions of the Queen;3 1 Lingard, vol. viii. pp. 380, 381. 2 Lord Henry Howard to the Earl of Mar, Sept., 1602, Hailes' Cecil Correspondence, pp. 231, 233. 3 Lord Henry Howard to the Earl of Mar, Nov., 22, 1601, Hailes' Correspondence of Sir R.

Ncav and alarming reports of the continued preparations of Philip the Third having recently reached the Queen, she Avas particularly gratified by the secret information which James had transmitted her on the subject, and by the readiness Avith Avhich he had permitted Lennox to volunteer his services. These, however, she declined ; declaring that she Avould never consent to hazard so valuable a life in so perilous an enterprise, and dismissing him with the most flattering marks of her approbation.1 During the Duke's residence in England, his chief care seems to have been to conciliate that party in the State Avhich Avas opposed to Cecil, and Avhom this crafty minister represented as inimical to James. It Avas led by the Earl of Northumberland, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Lord Cobham. Lord Henry Howard, the agent of Cecil, in his secret correspondence Avith the King of Scots, laboured to persuade that monarch that this faction Avere little to be trusted, Avithout weight in the country, and altogether despe rate, false, and reckless men. The great object of Cecil and Howard was to exalt their OAvn poAvcr and 1 MS. St. P. Off., Copy of the time. Royal Letters, Scotland, Elizabeth to James, 2d December, 1601. VOL.

To the King himself, Lord Henry's flattery almost borders upon blasphemy.1 On all others, except Cecil and his confidants, he pours out an unceasing flood of abuse, slander, bitterness, and contempt ; and to that great Princess whom they had idolized in her palmy days, and whose sun was now sinking in sorroAV, there is not given a single sigh of regret, not a solitary glance of sympathy. It has been attempted to de fend Cecil from being participant in these intrigues, by asserting that the correspondence is not his, and that he is not responsible for the letters of Lord Henry Howard ; but the argument will not bear exa mination. It is true, indeed, that he neither signed nor indited the letters ; but he dictated them : he read and approved of them ; he despatched them ; he was present when the answers were received ; he opened the packet which contained them ; and King James, when he replies, either in his own person or through 1 He is the apple of the Eternal eye ; the most \" inestimable King James, whom neither death nor life, nor angels, nor princi palities, nor powers, shall separate from the affection and vows they have, next to the sovereign possessor, vowed to him; the re doubted monarch, of whose matchless mind Lord Henry thinks, as God's lieutenant on earth, with the same reverence and awe which he owes to God himself when he is on his knees.\" \u2014 Hailes' Secret Correspondence of Sir Robert Cecil, pp. 154, 168, 170, 194, 233."], [411, "1602. 387 JAMES VI.

But every letter in the correspondence shows that a finer system Avas adopt ed, which insured safety to the minister in the event of detection, and yet interfered Avith none of the ad vantages of success ; by which Howard, although fully instructed beforehand by Cecil, expressed him self as if he acted alone, and at his own risk. It has been said, also, that the real letters of Cecil to James are preserved at Hatfield, amongst the archives of his noble descendant, and contain nothing discred itable to the Secretary. But these, probably, Avere let ters of mere ceremony and general goodwill, which Cecil despatched by the common opportunities, and cared not Avho should intercept or read ; nay, it is quite possible that, in the intricate spirit of the diplo macy of these times, they were written to be inter cepted, and for the purpose of lulling suspicion by the innocence of their contents.

When the subject of the succession was openly canvassed ; when all were looking to Scot land, and Cecil seemed to stand aloof, and, if the subject were forced upon him, spoke of the King of Scots Avith a coldness and indifference Avhich blinded the most acute : James, on the other hand, acted his part with admirable dexterity ; praised Cecil for his fidelity to his royal mistress ; and affected great doubt whether he would eventually turn out his friend or his opponent. On -one point, hoAvever, Sir Robert and Lord Henry mistook the character of their royal corre spondent. To enhance their OAvn sendees and destroy their rivals, they insisted on the absolute necessity of the King following out the precise plan Avhich they had sketched out for him, and declining all offers of assistance but Avhat came through them selves.

But, happily for this Prince, they Avere at this moment Aveakened by divisions ; and the great question of the \" succession,\" which had been keenly debated amongst the English Catholic exiles abroad, had eventually split them into two parties : the Spanish faction led by the celebrated Father Persons, the author of the famous Treatise on the Succession, published under the fictitious name of Doleman ; and their opponent faction led by Paget. The first party had espoused the cause of the In fanta. It Avas to support her claim, as descended from John of Gaunt, son of Edward the Third, that the book on the succession had been written : and as long as this Princess continued single, and there was a chance of her marrying the King of Scots, or some English nobleman, it was thought not impossible that the English people might be reconciled to her accession. Her marriage, however, with the Arch duke Albert, rendered the prospect desperate ; and Persons, her champion, who had now deserted the Court of Spain, and removed to Rome, abandoned her cause, and confined his efforts, and those of his party, to the succession of a Catholic Prince.1 Who this should be, he declared was a matter, to him, of indifference ; but many of his supporters in England looked to Arabella Stewart, the cousin-german of James ; and had formed a visionary project for her 1 Lingard's Hist, of England, vol. viii., fourth edition, p. 388.

To him, therefore, they pro fessed their readiness, on the death of Elizabeth, to transfer their allegiance : from him they looked, in return, for some alleviation of their sufferings, some toleration of their religion. And so keen were their feelings against the Spanish faction, that at the time Persons advocated the cause of the Infanta, he and his supporters met with no more determined enemies than the English Catholic exiles.1 So far did they carry this hostility, that they entered into a secret correspondence with their oavh government, and loAvered themselves by becoming spies and in formers against their brethren.2 It Avas the anxious desire of the King of Scots to conciliate both these parties. One great argu ment in Persons' \" Conference on the Succession,\" which contended that heresy must be considered an insurmountable ground of exclusion, Avas evi dently directed against him ; and had formerly given rise to a mission of Pourie Ogilvy, a Catholic baron, Avhoni he sent, in 1595, into Italy and Spain. At Venice, and at Rome, this Envoy, acting, as he as serted, by the secret instructions of the King of Scots, represented his royal master as ready to be instructed in the Catholic faith, and to give a fa vourable and candid hearing to its expounders. 1 Lingard's Hist, of England, vol. viii., fourth ed., pp. 390, 391. - Lingard, Id. Ibid."], [417, "1602. 393 JAMES VI. On proceeding into Spain, Ogilvy's flight was bolder, and the promises held out more tempting and decided. The King of Scots, he said, Avas determined to re venge the injuries and insults offered him by the Queen of England, and eagerly desired the coopera tion of Philip. Why then should their majesties not enter into a treaty ? His master, for his part, would become Catholic, establish the true faith in his do minions, and send his son, as a hostage for his since rity, to be educated at the Court of Spain. In re turn, he required from Philip a renunciation of his claims upon the English Crown, an advance of 500,000 ducats, and an auxiliary force of 12,000 men. Philip, however, looked Avith suspicion on the Ambassador, who had been observed to haunt Avith Paget and his friends in the Loav Countries. His veracity, his credentials, even his religion, were dis puted ; and although treated Avith outward courtesy by the Spanish monarch, he received little encourage ment. But James, who had a strong predilection for these mysterious missions, Avas not cast down ; and re turned to the attack. In September 1590, a second Envoy, named Drummond, Avho alleged that he was employed by James, repaired to the Papal Court, and carried with him a letter from the King to Clement the Eighth, in Avhich he suggested that the residence of a Scottish Minister at the Court of Rome would have the best effects ; and proposed that Drummond Bishop of Vaison, a Scotsman by birth, should be selected for that purpose. The Ambassador proposed"], [418, "1602. 394 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. also, in the King's name, that the young Prince Henry, his eldest son, should be brought up in the Catholic faith, and offered to place his castle of Edinburgh in the hands of the Catholics.1 It is extremely difficult to discover how much, or how little truth there was in these alleged intrigues of the Scottish King. Ogilvy, undoubtedly, acted not only as an Envoy of James, but a spy of Cecil ; and James, Avhen challenged by Elizabeth's Ambassador, Sir Henry Brunker, as to his letter to Clement, declared in the most pointed and solemn manner, that he never wrote, or trans- mitted, such a document to Rome. The letter, how- ever, was subsequently produced, and published by Cardinal Bellarmine. It undoubtedly bore the King's signature ; and, after a rigid inquiry, Lord Balmerino, the Scottish Secretary of State, a Catholic, and near relative of the Bishop of Vaison, confessed that he had smuggled in the obnoxious epistle amongst a crowd of other papers ; and that the King, believing it to be a matter of form, like the rest, had signed it without glancing at its contents. This story, Iioav- ever, did not itself obtain belief. It was alleged that Balmerino had consented to become the scape-goat, that he might shelter his royal master; and the leniency of his punishment, for so daring an act, con firmed the suspicion. But, on whatever side the truth may be, this secret intercourse produced a fa vourable feeling in the great body of the Catholics towards the King of Scots. The impression in his favour Avas universal amongst all parties in Eng- 1 Hailes' Secret Correspondence of Sir R.

And here, too, his happy star prevailed ; and his efforts to extinguish those dread ful dissensions amongst his nobility, Avhich, for many years, had exposed the country to all the horrors of private Avar, were at last successful. The Earls of Argyll and Huntly Avere reconciled, and their friend ship cemented by the betrothment of Argyll's daugh ter to Hunts y's son.2 The Duke of Lennox, and the party of the Scottish Queen, were induced to forget their deadly differences Avith the Earl of Mar ; and, last of all, that obstinate and far-ramifying blood feud betAveen the great houses of Murray and Huntly, which had now, for more than forty years, torn and depopulated some of the fairest portions of the country, was brought to an end by the firm and judicious arbitration of James. This success, and the extraordinary calm Avith Avhich it was accompanied, occasioned the utmost joy throughout the country ; and Nicolson, the English resident, informed Cecil that nothing was noAv heard at Court but the voice of festivity and gratulation ; the nobility feasting each other, consorting like brethren, and all united 1 Hailes' Secret Correspondence of eSir Robert Cecil, p. 1 27. 2 MS.

The King of France, also, in great secrecy, proposed a new league Avith Scotland, with the object of strength ening himself against Spain ; but as Henry added nothing as to including England, the Scottish King seized the opportunity to convince Elizabeth of his fair dealing. He accordingly despatched Roger Ashton Avith a full account of all his foreign negoti ations ; made her participant of his secret intelligence from Spain'; communicated the priArate offers of Henry the Fourth ; and, expressing- his deep gratitude for her steady friendship, requested her advice regarding the answers he should send to France and Spain.2 The Queen, in reply, cautioned him against putting implicit trust in the promises of the French King, whose sin cerity she doubted. \" Let others promise,\" said she, \" and I will do as much Avith truth as others Avith Aviles.\" However, it Avould do little harm, she ob served, to put Henry to the test ; and for her part she Avould make one of any league that Avas proposed.

For where hath there been an example that any one King hath ever denied so fair a present, as the whole seventeen provinces of the Loav Countries ? yea, who not only would not have denied them, but sent a dozen gentlemen to warn him of their sliding from him, with offer of keeping them from the near neighbours' hands, and sent treasure to stay the shaking towns from lapse. \u2014 Deserved I such a recompense as many a complot both for my life and kingdom ?

Nor had he long to Avait. Only ten days after her last letter, Elizabeth caught a severe cold at Whitehall ; and as she had been warned by Dr Dee, her astrologer, to beware of 1 MS. Letters, St. P.

Up to this time she had struggled sternly and strongly against every symptom of increas ing weakness. It had long been evident to all about her that, since the death of Essex, her mind and con stitution had been perceptibly shattered. Her tem per Avas entirely broken ; and, in spite of every effort to defy it, a deep melancholy, and Aveariness of life, had fixed upon her. But although this Avas ap parent to near observers,1 to the world she kept up appearances ; and continued her usual fetes and diver sions, interrupted by sudden fits of silence, abstrac tion, and tears.2 At last, the effort Avas too much ; the boAv, bent to its utmost endurance, snapt asunder; and her lion heart, and strong energetic frame, sunk at once into a state of the most pitiable and helpless Aveakness.

She Avould take neither medicines nor nourishment ; her sleep entirely forsook her, and a Ioav hectic fever seemed to be wasting her by inches ; Avhilst she com plained of a heavy load upon the heart, which made her sigh almost incessantly, and seek, in Arain, for relief in a restless change of position. These sad symptoms increased to such a degree in the beginning of March, that the physicians pronounced her case hopeless ; and it was deemed right to send for the 1 Letter of Sir John Harrington, quoted in Dr Lingard's His tory, vol. viii. p. 394. - Birch's Memoirs, vol. ii. p. 505.

Council, Avho arrived at Richmond on the 18th of March ; and anticipating her speedy dissolution, took such measures as Avere thought necessurv, in that event, to secure the public tranquillity. With this object, it Avas resolved, that the Lord High Admiral, Howard Earl of Nottingham, the only member of the Council whose presence seemed to give comfort to the dying Queen ; Cecil, the Secretary of State ; and the Lord Keeper, should remain at Richmond; whilst the rest of the Council repaired to Whitehall. Orders, at the same time, Avere issued to set a guard upon the Exchequer ; to arrest and transport to Holland all suspicious characters found lurking in London and Westminster ; to furnish the Court with means of defence ; and convey to the ToAver some gentle- men Avho Avere belic-wed to be desperate from discon- tent, and anxious for innovation.

Whilst these precautions Avere being taken, the melancholy object of them, the Queen, seemed retired and sunk within herself; took no interest in anything that Avas going on; and if roused for a moment, declared that she felt no pain, required no remedies, and Avas anxious for death. She expressed, how ever, a strong desire to hear prayers in her private chapel, and all Avas made ready ; but she found the effort too much for her, and had cushions spread at VOL. ix. 2 D"], [426, "402 1603.

Want of food and sleep appear, not long after, to have brought on a partial delirium : for she noAv obstinately insisted on sitting up, dressed, day and night upon her cushions ; and when entreated by the Lord Admiral to go to bed, assured him, with a shudder of terror, that if he had seen what she saAV there, he would choose any place but that. She then motioned him to approach her ; and ordering the rest to leave the room, dreAv him with a piteous gesture down to her low seat, and exclaimed, \" My Lord, they have bound me: I am tied Avith an iron collar about my neck.\"1 It Avas in vain he attempted either argument or consolation : no power Avould make her undress or go to bed ; and in this miserable state she sat for two days and three nights, her finger pressed upon her lips, as if afraid of betraying some secret ; her eyes open and fixed on the ground, and generally silent and immoveable.2 Yet, whenCecil her Secretary remonstrated against this, and asked if she had seen spirits, she smiled contemptuously, and said the ques tion Avas not worthy an answer ; but Avhen he told her she must go to bed, if it Avere but to satisfy her people, she showed a flash of her former spirit. \" Must ! \" said she ; \" is must a word to be addressed to Princes ?

They attempted to induce her to take some nourishment, and to folloAV the prescriptions of her physicians ; but this she steadily refused, declaring that she had no wish to live. They then exhorted her to provide for her spiritual safety ; to Avhich she mildly ansAvered, \" That I have done long ago.\" 2 When the Arch bishop, Avho was affected by the deep despondency and melancholy into which she had sunk, attempted to rouse and comfort her by alluding to the services she had conferred on Europe, and by her glorious defence of the Protestant faith, she checked him severely, declaring- that she had too long listened to the voice of flattery, and that it should at least be silent on her death-bed ; but she held him by the hand, and compelled him to continue his prayers, till the aged primate's knees Avere wearied, and he had almost sunk down at her bed-side. At last she per mitted him to depart, after receiving his blessing.

On the night, hoAvever, on Avhich she died, Cecil made a last effort for the King of Scots; and accompanied by the Lord Admiral Howard, and the Lord Keeper, earnestly requested her to name a successor. Her answer Avas proud and brief: \" My seat has been the seat of kings, and none but a king must succeed me.\" They urged her to be more explicit, and mentioned the King of France ; but she Avas silent. They then ventured on the King of Scots ; but ,she vouchsafed no sign. The Lord Beauchamp, the heir of the house of Suffolk by his mother Lady Catherine Grey, was then spoken of; upon which she roused herself and said, Avith a look and flash of her former lion spirit, \" I will have no rascal's son in my seat.\" 3 Here, according to the account of Lady Soutlnvell, one of her maids of honour, Avho stood at the moment beside 1 Carey's Memoirs, pp. 120, 122.

But, on the other hand, it was positively affirmed by Cecil, and the tAvo lords his companions, that at a later hour of the same night she clearly declared by signs that the King of Scots alone ought to succeed her. When his name Avas mentioned, it is said she suddenly started, heaA-ed herself up in the bed, and held her hands jointly over her head in manner of a croAvn. It is probable that this sign given by the dying Princess was one of assent ; yet, it is possible, also, that they Avho had seized the aAvful moment when her soul Avas hover ing between the tAvo Avorlds to torture her Avith ques tions, may have mistaken a movement of agony for one of approbation.1 Soon after this she sunk into a state of insensi bility, and about midnight fell into a placid sleep, from which she woke to expire gently and Avithout a struggle.

Both were 1 Sloan MSS., printed by Ellis, 2.1 Series, vol. iii. p. 194."], [430, "1603. 406 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. friends and correspondents of the King of Scots, and it had been concerted between the brother and sister that the distinction of being the first to announce the happy new7s to that monarch should be theirs. It was difficult, however, to cheat the vigilancy of Cecil and the Council, Avho had ordered all the gates of the palace to be closed ; but Carey was on the alert, ready booted and spurred ; his sister stood beside the bed, watching for her mistress' last sigh ; and the mo ment it Avas breathed, she snatched a ring from her finger, (it had been a gift from the King of Scots,) glided out of the chamber, and cast it over the palace window to her brother, Avho threw himself on horseback, and rode post into Scotland. The Queen had died at three o'clock on Thursday morning and Carey reached the palace of Holyrood on Saturday night, after the royal expectant had retired to bed. He was immediately admitted ; and throwing him self on his knees, saluted James as monarch of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland. The King asked for the token ; and Carey, drawing the ring from his bosom, presented it in his sister's name. James then gave him his hand to kiss ; and Avithout evincing any unseemly exultation, bade the messenger good night, and composed himself to rest. Next morning, and for the tAvo succeeding days, the news was not made public, as Carey's message Avas not official ; but on the third day Sir Charles Percy, brother to the Earl of Northumberland, and Thomas Somerset, son of Lord Worcester, arrived with a letter from the Privy Council of England, announcing"], [431, "1603. JAMES VI. 407 the death of the Queen ; the proclamation of James' accession to the throne ; and the universal joy and impatience Avith Avhich the people of England ex pected their new monarch. It assured him that their sorrow for their recent loss was extinguished by looking fonvard to the heroical virtues Avhich resided in his person; laid at his feet the humble offering of their faith and obedience ; and besought him, in his excellent Avisdom, to visit them with all speed, that he might take possession of his inheri tance, and inspire new life into its languishing body.1 This great event was uoav communicated to the peo ple, who received it at first Avith universal demonstra tions of exultation and delight, and the King declared his determination to set out speedily for his new kingdom, leaving the Queen and his children to fol low at a slower pace. He committed the govern ment of Scotland to the Privy Council ; intrusted his eldest son, Henry, now Prince of Wales, to the Earl of Mar; Prince Charles to Sir Alexander Seton, President of the Session ; and the Princess Eliza beth to the Earl of Linlithgow. On the succeeding Sunday, James attended service in the High Church of St Giles, where, after a sermon w7as preached, in which the minister enumerated the manymercies pour ed out upon their Prince ; and described, as none of the least, his peaceable accession to that mighty kingdom Avhich iioav awaited him. The monarch himself then rose and delivered a valedictory address to the con gregation, Avhich, Ave are told, was often interrupted 1 .Spottiswood, pp, 473, 474,"], [432, "1003. 408 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. by the tears of the people. James, Avho Avas himself moved by these expressions of regret and affection, entreated his subjects not to be too deeply troubled at his departure ; assured them that they should find the fruits of his government as Avell afar off as Avhen he had resided amongst them ; pleaded that his increase in greatness did in nowise diminish his loA-e ; and promised them a personal visit once every three years; when the meanest, as Avell as the greatest, should haA*e access to his person and permission to pour their complaints into his bosom.1 This farewell oration was delivered on the 3d of April, 1603. On the 5th of the same month the King, surrounded by a large and brilliant cavalcade, com posed not only of Scottish but of English noblemen and gentlemen, who had hurried to his Court with the proffers of their homage, took his departure from Edinburgh amid the lamentations of the citizens. His progress through England, which occupied a month, Avas one long and brilliant pageant. Tri umphs, speeches, masques, huntings, revels, gifts, all that Avealth could command, and flattery and fancy devise, awaited him at the different cities and castles which he visited; and on the 6th of May, 1603, he entered London, accompanied by a numerous con course of his nobility and councillors, guarded and ushered by the Lord Mayor and five hundred citizens on horseback, and welcomed by the deafening shouts of an immense multitude of his neAV subjects. It seemed as if the English people had in this brief 1 Calderwood, p. 472. Spottiswood, p. 476."], [433, "1603. 409 JAMES VI. period utterly forgotten the mighty Princess, whose reign had been so glorious, and over whose bier they had so lately sorrowed. Not a murmur was heard, not one dissenting voice was raised to break the unanimity of his welcome ; and thus, after so many centuries of war and disaster, the proud sceptre of the Tudors was transferred to the house of Stewart, with a tranquillity and universal contentment which, even considering the justice of the title, was remark able and unexpected. In this memorable consummation, it was perhaps not unallowable, certainly it was not unnatural, that the lesser kingdom, Avhich now gave a monarch to the greater, should feel some emotions of national pride : for Scotland had defended her liberty against in numerable assaults; had been reduced, in the long struggle, to the very verge of despair; had been betrayed by more than one of her Kings, and by multitudes of her nobles; had been weakened by internal faction, distracted by fanatic rage ; but had never been overcome, because never deserted by a brave, though rude and simple people. Looking back to her still remoter annals, it could be said, with perfect historical truth, that this small kingdom had successfully resisted the Roman arms, and the terrible invasions of the Danish Sea Kings ; had maintained her freedom, within her mountains, during the ages of the Saxon Heptarchy, and stemmed the tide of Norman conquest ; had shaken off the chains at tempted to be fixed upon her by the two great Plan tao-enets, the First and Third Edwards, and, at a"], [434, "1603. 410 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. later period, by the tyranny of the Tudors ; and if now destined, in the legitimate course of royal suc cession, to lose her station as a separate and inde pendent kingdom, she yielded neither to hostile force nor to fraud, but willingly consented to link her future destinies with those of her mighty neighbour : like a bride, who, in the dawning prospect of a happy union, is contented to resign, but not to forget, the house and name of her fathers. Yet, however pleased at this pacific termination of their long struggles, the feelings with which his ancient people beheld the departure of their prince, were of a melancholy nature ; and an event occurred on the same day on which he set out, that made a deep impression upon a nation naturally thoughtful and superstitious. As the monarch passed the house of Seton, near Musselburgh, he was met by the funeral of Lord Seton, a nobleman of high rank ; which, with its solemn move ment and sable trappings, occupied the road, and contrasted strangely and gloomily with the brilliant pageantry of the royal cavalcade. The Setons were one of the oldest and proudest families of Scotland ; and that lord, whose mortal remains now passed by, had been a faithful adherent of the King's mother : whose banner he had never deserted, and inwhosecause he had suffered exile and proscription. The meeting was thought ominous by the people. It appeared, to their excited imaginations, as if the moment had arrived Avhen the aristocracy of Scotland was about to merge in that of Great Britain ; as if the Scottish nobles had finished their career of national glory, and this last"], [435, "1603. 411 JAMES VI. representative of their race had been arrested on his road to the grave, to bid farewell to the last of Scot land's Kings. As the mourners moved slowly on ward, the monarch himself, participating in these melancholy feelings, sat down by the way-side, on a stone still pointed out to the historical pilgrim ; nor did he resume his progress till the gloomy procession had completely disappeared.1 It is with feelings of gratitude, mingled with regret, that the Author now closes this work \u2014 the history of his country \u2014 the labour of little less than eighteen years : gratitude to the Giver of all Good, that life and health have been spared to complete, however imperfectly, an arduous undertaking ; regret that the tranquil pleasures of historical investigation, the happy hours devoted to the pursuit of truth, are at an end, and that he must at last bid farewell to an old and dear companion.

Bowes, the English Ambassador at the Scottish Court, to Lord Burghley, dated at Edinburgh, 4th June, 1590, that on the 8d June he received the following letter of Elizabeth to James, and presented it next day (the 4th) to the King of Scots. \" He received,\" says Bowes, \" her Majesty's letter very friendly ; showing himself much pleased and consorted therewith.\" The person against whom Elizabeth had remonstrated, deprecatiug his being sent on so weighty and confidential a business, was Colonel Stewart, whom she suspected, on account of his former desertion of the Protestant party. Queen Elizabeth to King James. MS. St. P. Off., Royal Letters, 29th May, J 590. \"My conceit, I perceive, my dear Brother, hath no whit swerved from your good intent : for now I well see Colonel Steward's nego tiation was not framed of his own brain, but proceeded from your earnest affection to so laudable a cause ; and by your last letters, I find your earnest motion made to the two Dukes, together with their good and loving consent. \" All this moveth me to find you a redevable' Prince to a careful friend; and [I ] do praise my judgment to have chosen so grateful a King, on whom to spend so many careful thoughts, as since your peregrination I have felt for your surety and your land's wealth : and as my thanks are manifold, so shall the memorial bide per uetual. 1 1 \" Redevable,\" Fr., beholden to ; gratefisl.

And [I] do as sure you, that as I will never myself enter into it the first, yet I will ask nothing that shall not fit a King to demand, nor plead more innocency in all the cause, than my guiltless conscience, well showed by my actions, shall ever testify. And so you may be assured to get most honour, and never blot your fame with dealing in an action, when so great injury shall appear, and no just cause to enforce it. \" That I perceive the Governors of Denmark like well that other Princes of Germany should send their good consent, with joining their message, I must needs say, \" the more the better \" that desire such thing as is best for all Christendom ; although I had thought that you, with the King of Denmark, would have sufficed. Yet if the rest do make the knot the greater, I must think my Bond to them the more, and trust the pact will be the surer. \" In the choice of such as you mind to send, this I hope you will chiefly regard : that he be none such as whose own cause or affection to the adverse part may breed a doubt of performance of the sender's will; but be chosen even such a one, as whose honest and wise endeavour may much advance the end of so good a beginning. \" My good brother, I write this the plainer that you might clearly see what one I wish, and that may suffice for all. And for that the time requireth speed, I doubt not but you will use it. \" And so I leave scribbling, but never end to love you, and assist you with my friendship, care, and prayer to the living God to send you all prosperous success, and his Holy Spirit for guide. \" Your most assured faithful Sister and Cousin.\" Indorsed, 29th May, 1590.
