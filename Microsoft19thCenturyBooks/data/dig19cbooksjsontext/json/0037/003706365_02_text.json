My uncle Dick amply vindicated his brother's eulogium of his conversational powers. When, at the bank, I had be held the stout, big form of my relative, and heard his bluff and highly familiar language, I believed him to be as nearly related to a boor as any man of his size and age can be. But my opinion of him VOL. II. B"], [12, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 2 underwent a very remarkable change when I listened to and watched him as he sat and talked at his brother's dinner-table. His manner then was perfectly polite ; positively there were certain points in his behaviour which my father might have beheld with envy and admiration. Added to this, he wyas exceedingly w7ell read ; talked French with a good accent, and quoted Latin with a happy applicability that robbed its employment of all flavour of pedantry. I had nothing to say. I was eclipsed. His jokes kept us all in high spirits. His anecdotes (which I can appreciate better now than I could then) were uni formly excellent.

He had been in Haydon's studio when Scott had called ; he had advised Southey on the purchase of some stocks ; he had dined wdth Rogers, where he had met Sydney Smith, William Bankes, Luttrell, and many others, whose names I forget. I am very much afraid, however, that we none of us listened to him with the interest he deserved. Speaking for myself, it would have given me more pleasure to have heard an account of a champion bdliard-match or a boat-race, than the best of Talleyrand's mots, or the smartest of Sydney Smith's rejoinders. My aunt smiled occasionally, as much out of politeness as out of appreciation ; and uncle Tom grew so soon tired of these stories \u2014 which I daresay he had often heard before \u2014 that he contrived to bring"], [14, "4 MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. the conversation round to the Stock Exchange, the income tax, and the stamp duties, on which his brother talked as freely and sagaciously as if these matters had been his only studies all his life. However, don't suppose that I sat like a mute through that dinner. When my uncle addressed me I contrived to answTer him in a style that, I had no doubt, maintained my credit with my aunt. One reply of mine \u2014 I forget what it was, and I am very glad I do \u2014 made the old gentleman burst into a tremendous roar of laughter, and from that moment he took a great deal of notice of me, en couraged my small attempts to exhibit my parts and wit, and took wine with me, nodding his head with a cordial smile, and crying out, before he put the"], [15, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 5 glass to his lips, how he wished the major made one of us. After my aunt and Conny had left the room, we three gentlemen grew really affectionate. The two brothers shook hands several times with each other, and several times with me, from no other reason whatever, than an overflowing im pulse. Old days were recalled and old scenes re-enacted. While my uncle Dick fished one beaming recollection after an other out of the grey tide of the past, my uncle Tom was watching him eagerly to observe when he stopped, in order to top the reminiscence with another. Some characteristic anecdotes of my father were repeated and roared over. Then my uncle Dick, having laughed himself grave, grew sentimental, spoke with hazy eyes of his dead wife, of his pet Teazer, wdio"], [16, "6 MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. was dear to him as his right hand, as the apple of his eye ; of departed friends, whose wit had often cheered, whose kindness had often soothed him.

Neither should you regard the instances he relates to you of family feuds as typical of the actual feelings that bind relations one to another. \" And nowT, my boy,\" said uncle Dick to me, \" when are you coming to Thistle wood ? \" \" Name a day convenient to your self,\" I replied, \" and then uncle Tom will perhaps give us his sense of the matter.\" \" Never mind the bank,\" exclaimed"], [18, "8 MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. uncle Tom, \" go whenever you like, and stop as long as you like.\" \" I shall return from London on Thurs day,\" said uncle Dick, \" and, if you'll come to me on that day, say so, and I'll send a telegram to Teazer to-morrow, to have a bed-room prepared for you.\" \"Let me say Monday,\" I answered. \" That will give your daughter more time.\" \" Very well.

I have something to say to you. The night is fine, and the longer you stay, the more brightly the moon will light you home.\" He then turned to his wife, who was watching us, and said, \"My dear, I have something of importance to talk over with Charlie, and we mean to shut ourselves up in the library.

We ought to be grateful. I hope, I beheve, I am. Few men have better reason to be satisfied with life than myself.

He told me to-night, that on the day of his daughter's marriage he will give her ten thousand pounds.

Far away down on the level plains were httle white villages, shining amid groups of trees.

The gate was opened, and I passed out of the broding road > into a deliciously cool avenue, with deep glades and sunny openings among the trees, under which I observed some young deer browsing.

I looked about me, being uncertain from which side of the avenue the voice had proceeded, and seeing nobody, was in the act of advancing again, when bang ! went the report of a pistol, so close and so loud, that, for the moment, I actually believed myself shot, and pulled off my hat, feeling pretty sure that I should find a bidlet hole in it. \"Good God!\" I thought. \"What is the meaning of this ? \" A thin cloud of blue smoke curled up from a tree on the right, and, as I gazed with a stupefied air in that direc tion, the tall commanding figure of a"], [75, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 65 woman stepped forward, and approached me. \" Why didn't you halt when I ordered you ? \" she demanded, fixing a pair < >f dark, glittering eyes on me.

On her head was a large garden hat which threw so dark a shadow over her face that I could master no more of its details than the keen bright o eyes. Could this be my cousin Theresa ?

I hastened forward, not doubting for a moment that, whether she was my cousin or not, she was not in possession of her reason, and congratulating myself on what I could not but consider a very narrow escape of my life. In a few moments I reached the house, a fine old building with a great door and many windows, the upper ones hooded, and a broad carpet of grass all round it, on to which the queerest little doors opened, with large bow-windows on the ground- er o floor.

However, I had scarcely been seated a minute when my uncle came in. \" How are you ? how are you ? \" he cried, grasping my hand. \" Delighted to see you and to welcome you.

Many of his books, he assured me, as he stood with his back to the door, complacently surveying the large coUection that was ranged, row upon row, round the walls, were worth their weight in gold. \" Here,\" said he, pulling out a folio, \" is a book for which I gave eight guineas, and for which I should consider myself insulted by an offer of twenty.

The name of the book I forget : but I wouldn't own that the engraving he opened the book at, and pointed to with immense triumph, struck me as very rude, and not to be compared with illustrations to be found in modern books* costing' only a few shillings. Bibliomania must be humoured, like any other form of madness. I was bitten with it myself not many years ago, and thought more of old bundles of illegible print stitched in parchment, well perforated with moths and worms, than of emeralds and diamonds. He pulled down several other volumes to show me, explaining their value and chattering about their contents in a style which convinced me that he was one of the very few book-buyers who are book readers.

There was nobody in the drawing-room. \" Why doesn't Teazer come to us ? \" exclaimed my uncle. \" Stay you here, my boy, and I'll go and call her.\" I took a chair at the table, and began to inspect the contents of an album filled with photographs.

On the next pages were, on the left a photograph of Theresa, and on the right a portrait of Conny. I had now my two cousins before me, and could compare them. Conny looked indescribably pretty, in spite of a somewhat affected p>ose. Teazer's face was in profile, and a handsome profile it was. There was plenty of intellect in the low, square brow, over which the plentiful dark hair was roughly drawn. The eyelashes were long, but contributed little of tenderness to the determined gaze of the large eye. The contour of the bust was noble.

I caught myself examining it intently and not without admiration ; though when my eye reverted to the sunny-haired beauty on the other page, my heart welcomed the sweeter attraction that drew it away from the fascination of the stern and handsome Teazer. All at once the door was violently pushed open, and in walked the lady of the pistol ! I closed the album and stood up. She gave me a manly nod, though such a figure as hers ought to have been capable of the most graceful and sweeping bow in the world, and said, \"Are you my cousin?\" \"I believe so,\" I answered, \"that is, if you are Theresa Hargrave.\" To this she made no reply, but stood for some moments with a curling Up, examining me from head to foot in a"], [99, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 89 manner the most depressing to my self conceit that can well be imagined. Meanwhile, I honoured her with a similar inspection. Her portrait scarcely did her justice \u2014 it made her a brunette ; whereas, her skin was delicately fair, though her eyes were dark and piercing, and her hair brown. She had a full red underlip, a fine tinge of red upon her cheeks, a straight Greek nose, and finely arched eyebrows. She held herself per fectly erect. I unhesitatingly admitted, in spite of the prejudice her extraordinary behaviour excited in me, that she was a strikingly handsome girl ; but I sought in her face in vain for some sign of the capacity of tender impulse and the womanly characteristics her father had claimed for her. \"What made you afraid of me just"], [100, "90 MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. now ? \" she enquired without a smde. \"You must be a very nervous per- 7. son. \" I am much obliged to you for your good opinion,\" I replied loftily.

But perhaps you mistook surprise for fear. You see, I was quite unprepared for your very noisy reception.

I was really alarmed by the girl's extravagance. There was something indescribably impudent in her manner and a slanginess in her speech, to say nothing of its grammatical deficiencies, that was inexpressibly repulsive to me. Uncle Tom had suggested that she wanted taming, but that word suggested nothing.

But her gravity was not to be mistaken. Like the country girl of the play, she appeared to have neither tact nor breeding enough to re strain or moderate the violent and sudden exhibition of her character ; and I sat Hstening to and watchimg her with much such mingled emotions of astonishment and disgust, as would no doubt possess me, were I compeUed to make love to a female chimpanzee. I was spared the trouble of hunting after some suitable answer to her singular remarks by the entrance of her father. He came in, saying that he had been giving orders to the servants to hurry forward with the dinner, which was faith fully promised by five o'clock ; and then going up to his daughter, he exclaimed :"], [106, "96 MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. \" Teazer, Avhat on earth made you play Charlie so vile a trick?

Theresa fixed her shining eyes upon me, and I suspected, from the expression on her face, that she was going to \"let out\" at me in violent and powerful lan guage. Instead of which she looked at her father, with a smile, and answered gently, \" I thought aU visits of state and cere mony were celebrated by discharges of artillery.\" \" Come, come, you were very wrong,\""], [107, "MY UNCLE'S SCHEME. 97 said her father, turning his head aside to conceal a grin. \" I can only promise you Charlie's forgiveness on one condition \u2014 that you wdl never be guilty of such folly again.\" Once more I encountered her eyes fixed upon me, haughtily and angrily ; and, anxious to conciliate her, I entreated my uncle to change the subject, assuring him that so far from being offended, I was only too pleased that Theresa should treat me sans ceremonie. This handsome speech produced no im pression on her whatever.

She kept the book open in her lap, I believe, as an excuse not to talk ; for, several times, whilst her father and I conversed, I caught her watching me, though she always took care to avert her eyes and curl her lip when I glanced at her. I thought her a perfect Tartar, and won dered at my uncle Tom's extraordinary want of penetration, in supposing that I could ever be brought to couple myseff with such a woman. She never opened her lips until the Irish man-servant, whose name I after wards learnt was 0 'Twist, announced din ner.

He made as good a host as Tom ; but though the dinner was first rate, the wines superior to any my uncle Tom had, I never in all my life felt so miserable nor enjoyed my food less. That confounded O'T wist, who stood behind his master's chair, scarcely ever removed his eyes from my face. I tried once to stare him out, but the longer I looked the more intent became his gaze.

Whether it was that he was spoiled in my esteem by the out rageous behaviour of his daughter and servant, or that I regarded him as head ing a conspiracy against my peace of mind, I did not find half so much to like in him as I had at Grove End.

Shortly after the dessert was placed upon the table she left the room, and to my great relief was followed by 0 'Twist. Vexed as I was, my politeness would not suffer me to make any comments on her behaviour.

She laughed, and coolly put the stool on end with her foot. \" I'll finish the song if my cousin likes,\" said she. \" No, thank you. He's had enough of it, I'U warrant.

It is impossible to over-estimate the importance of a history where facts are chosen to illustrate principles and enforce great truths; where there is a continuous protest in favour of liberty, whether political, intellectual, or religious, and where good and evil are not tampered with to suit party purposes, but the historian is as impartial and open to the reception of truth as he hopes to make the students who follow his pages.

Admirable histories of America, of the United States, of different portions of both, and of many distinguished men whose lives at one time or another have helped to make those histories, have been written, and are familiar to scholars. Some of them cover one period and some another ; and some are more, some less, full and exhaustive.

(SE2_|HIS Series has been commenced with the view of presenting to R3 B?4 English readers in the cheapest possible form, works by the best PiaAJ-Fa writers in English, American, Fre?uh, a?:,! German popular literature. The works chosen being intended for family reading, and for readers of all ages, it is almost needless to say that the greatest care will be taken in the selection, so that nothing shall be introduced which is not calculated to amuse innocently, to interest, and to instruct. Owing to the doubtful reputation which French literature has (in many instances quite deservedly) obtained in this country, it has become a fashion to ex clude it wholly from the family library. In so doing, we hope to prove by our selection that many English readers have thus been shut out from a source of amusement and instruction quite as innocent and pure as is to be found in the literature of any country. One of the special features of this series, which, it is hoped, will commend itself to all readers, is its price, 'which will rarely exceed ONE SHILLING EACH VOLUME. Another special and attractive feature is that many of the volumes will contain NUMEROUS FULL-PAGE AND SMALLER ILLUSTRATIONS. The following Volumes are noiv ready. I. SEAGULL ROCK.
