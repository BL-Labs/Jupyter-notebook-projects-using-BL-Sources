The border districts, at all times impatient under the restraints of a firm government, had, during the late civil commo tions, become the scene of the utmost violence and confusion ; but Morton, advancing from Peebles to Jedburgh with a force of four thousand men, soon compelled the principal chiefs to respect the law and give pledges for their obedience.1 Sir James Hume 1 MS.

He stated, that in a conver sation which took place in the palace, the Regent had declared, that as long as the Scottish Queen lived, there would be treason, troubles, and mischief; to which, said Killigrew, \" I answered he might help that ; and he said, when all was done, he thought at the next parliament * *\" to prove the noblemen after this concord, to see what might be done.\"2 We do not find, however, that Elizabeth at this moment gave any encouragement to the renewal of this nefarious negotiation. All was now quiet in Scotland, and it is remark- 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. Morton to Burghley, 25th June, 1573. 2 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. The Regent to Lord Burghley, Holy rood, 26th June, 1573.

Commerce and trade had increased; and whilst the power of the high feudal lords was visibly on the decay, the middle classes had risen in importance ; and the great body of the people, in structed in their political duties by the sermons of the clergy, and acquiring from the institution of parish schools a larger share of education and intelligence, began to appreciate their rights, and to feel their own strength. There is a passage in a letter of Killi grew, which is worthy of notice upon this subject. \" Methinks,\" said this acute observer, \" I see the noblemen's great credit decay in this country, and the barons, burrows, and such like, take more upon them ; the ministers and religion increase, and the desire in them to prevent the practices of the Papists ; the number of able men for service very great, and well furnished both on horse and foot ; their navy so augmented, as it is a thing almost incredible.\" 1 It is to be recollected, that Killigrew's last visit to Scotland had been in 1567, immediately after the murder of the King ; and that the remarkable change which he now noticed, had taken place in the brief period of five years. This flourishing state of things, however, did not long continue ; for although the Regent was justly entitled to the praise of restoring security and order, and his vigour in the punishment of crime, and the 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. Killigrew to Burghley, 1 1th Novem ber, 1572."], [29, "1573. REGENCY OF MORTON. 5 maintenance of the authority of the laws, was supe rior to that of any former governor, there was one vice which stained his character, and led to measures of an unpopular and oppressive kind. This was avarice : and he found the first field for its exercise in an attack upon the patrimony of the Kirk. He had the address to persuade the Presbyterian clergy, that it would be the best thing for their interests to resign at once into his hands the thirds of the bene fices, which had been granted for their support by a former parliament. Their collectors, he said, were often in arrear; but his object would be, to make the stipend local, and payable in each parish where they served. This would be a better system; and if it failed, they should, upon application, be imme diately reinstated in their right and possession.1 The plan was agreed to, but was followed by immediate repentance on the part of the clergy ; as the moment Morton became possessed of the thirds, his scheme of spoliation was unmasked. The course he followed was, to appoint two, three, or even four churches to one minister, who was bound to preach in them by turns ; and at the same time he placed in every parish a reader, whose duty was to officiate in the min ister's absence, and to whom a miserable pittance of twenty or forty pounds Scots was assigned. Hav ing thus allotted to the Church the smallest possible sum, he seized the overplus for himself; and when the clergy, sensible of their error, petitioned to be re- 1 Spottiswood, p. 270,"], [30, "1573. 6 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. instated in their property, as had been promised, they were at first met with delays, and at last peremptorily told, that the appointment of the stipends ought pro perly to belong to the Regent and Council. Nothing could be more distressing and degrading to this independent body of men than such a state of things. Before this, when their stipend was defec tive, they had an appeal to the superintendants, who, if not always able, were at least solicitous to relieve them. Now, they were compelled to become suitors at Court, where their importunate complaints met only with ridicule and neglect. All this misery was justly laid to the Regent's account ; and although once their favourite, as a steady friend to the Refor mation, he became highly unpopular with the clergy. But, if the grasping avarice of Morton fell heavy on the ministers of the Kirk, their woes were little to the miseries of the lower classes, more especially the artisans, merchants, and burgesses of the capital. Many of these had remained in the city during the time of the late troubles. These were now treated as rebels, who had resisted the King's authority; and they found that they must either submit to a public trial, or purchase security by payment of a heavy fine. The sum thus collected, was intended at first to be divided between the state and the citizens whose houses and property had been destroyed ; but it followed the fate of all monies paid into the coffers of this rapacious governor. Another source of complaint arose out of those Itinerant Courts, denominated Justice Ayres, and"], [31, "1573. REGENCY OF MORTON. 7 held in different parts of the kingdom ; which, under his administration, became little else than parts of a system of legal machinery, invented to concuss and plunder all classes in the country. To supply them with victims, he kept in pay a numerous body of informers, whose business it was to discover offences. Nor was it difficult to bring forward accusations of almost every possible nature, after so many years of a divided government, in which men, at one time or another, had been compelled to acknowledge very op posite authorities : now that of the King *and his Regent ; now, of the Queen or her partisans. Ample ground was thus found for every species of prosecu tion : against merchants for transporting coin out of the realm, against Protestants for transgressing the statute by eating flesh in Lent, against the poorer artisans or labourers for the mere remaining in a town or city which was occupied by the Queen's forces. As to those whose only offence was to be rich, their case was the worst of all ; for to have a full purse, and \" thole\"1 a heavy fine to the Regent, were become synonymous terms. These were not Morton's only resources. His petitions to Elizabeth for support were importunate and incessant ; nor did he fail to remind her, that as it was by her \" allowance and advice that he had entered upon the Regency, so he confidently ex pected her aid, especially in money, and pensions bestowed upon his friends.\" Although universally 1 \" Thole,\" undergo."], [32, "8 1573. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. reputed rich, he dwelt pathetically on his limited revenue compared with his vast outlay ; and in the letter to Burghley, which preferred these requests, he at the same time earnestly recommended Elizabeth to keep a watchful eye upon France, as the noted Adam Gordon, who had already done so much mischief in the North, was now received at the French court, and, he heard, had offered, if properly supported, to overthrow the King's government in Scotland.1 This news seems to have alarmed the English Queen ; for, not long after, she again despatched Killigrew into that country. Her open object was to learn the state of public feeling, and the disposi tion of the Regent ; \" whether he was constant in his affection towards England ; how his government was liked by the people ; whether the Scottish Queen had yet any party there ; and, above all, to discover whe ther France was intriguing, as had been reported, to get possession of the young King.\" To the Regent's proposal for a defensive and religious league, he was instructed to reply, that she deemed such a measure at present unnecessary ; although, in any emergency, he might look confidently to her support. As to his request for money, Killigrew was, as delicately as he could, to \" waive\" all discussion upon the subject. Here, however, as in the former embassy, there was a mission within a mission ; and the envoy's open instructions embraced not the whole, nor even the most material part of the object for which he 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. The Regent Morton to Burghley, Jan. 21, 1573-4, Haddington."], [33, "1573. REGENCY OF MORTON. 9 was sent. He was enjoined by Burghley and Lei cester (doubtless, as before, with Elizabeth's know ledge and advice) to renew the negotiation for \"the great matter ; \" the project for having Mary put to death in her own country, and by her own subjects. Unfortunately the written orders upon this point are now lost ; but immediately upon his arrival in Edin burgh, the Ambassador communicated to Walsingham his fears that they had suffered the time for the accomplishment of so desirable a result to go by.1 On examining the state of the country, Killigrew became convinced that his Sovereign and the English had lost popularity since his late residence in Scot land. The Regent, although professing his usual devotion, appeared more distant and reserved. The Queen's coldness on the subject of the proposed league, and her evasion of his request for pensions, had produced no good effect ; and some piracies committed by English subjects upon Scottish mer chantmen, had occasioned great popular discontent. Not long after the Ambassador's arrival, he re paired to Stirling, where he was introduced to the young King, then only seven years old ; and, after the interview, he sent this interesting portrait of him to Walsingham : \u2014 \" Since my last unto you,\" said he, \" I have been at Stirling to visit the King in her Majesty's name, and met by the way the Countess 1 MS.

And at my departure, he prayed me to thank her Majesty for the good remem brance she had of him; and further desired me to make his hearty commendations unto her Majesty. His Grace is well grown, both in body and spirit, since I was last here. He speaketh the French tongue marvellous well ; and that which seems strange to me, he was able extempore (which he did before me) to read a chapter of the Bible out of Latin into French, and out of French after into English, so well, as few men could have added any thing to his translation. His schoolmasters, Mr George Buchanan and Mr Peter Young, rare men, caused me to appoint the King what chapter I would; and so did I, whereby I perceived it was not studied for. They also made his Highness dance before me, which he likewise did with a very good grace; a Prince sure of great hope, if God send him life.\" 1 The English Ambassador remained in Scotland for more than two months, during which time he had ample opportunities to make himself acquainted with the state of the country. He found the Regent firm in his government, universally obeyed, somewhat 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off.

The general prosperity of all classes of the people surprised him. He had, to use his own expression, left the country \" in a consumption,\" distracted and impoverished by a long continuance of civil war.1 He had expected, on his return, to meet with the same melancholy state of things ; but to his astonish ment, the nation, as he described it to Burghley and Walsingham, had recovered itself with a rapidity of which he found it difficult to assign the cause. Its commerce and manufactures were in a flourishing condition, the people seemed to have forgotten their miseries, the nobles were reconciled to each other, and universally acknowledged the King's authority. Although French intrigue was still busy, and the captive Queen attempted to keep up a party, the uncommon vigilance of Morton detected and put down all her practices. Formerly, the people broken, bankrupt, and dispirited, were glad to sue for the protection of England, and the nobles were eager in their offers to Elizabeth. Now, to use Killigrew's phrase, they were \" lusty and independent ;\" they talked as those who would be sued to ; their alliance, they said, had been courted by \" great monarchies ;\" and they complained loudly of the attack and plunder of their merchantmen by the English pirates.

The rejection of the pro posed league by Elizabeth ; her silence as to sending him any aid, or granting any pensions ; the delay in giving back the ordnance which had been taken by the English, and other lighter subjects of complaint, were all recapitulated ; and it was evident to Killi grew that there was an alteration in the relative position of the two countries, which he assured Wal singham would not be removed by mere words of compliment.1 The Ambassador anxiously impressed upon Eliza beth and her ministers, that the Scots were no longer dependent upon England ; and as to attempting to make any impression upon the Regent in \" the great matter,\"2 which Leicester and Burghley were solici tous should be again secretly discussed, it seemed to him a vain idea at present. If Morton were to con sent to put Mary to death on her delivery into his hands, it would only be, as he soon perceived, by the offer of a far higher bribe than Elizabeth was dis posed to give ; and by the settlement of large annui ties on such of the nobles as were confidants to his cruel design.

He, too, insisted on certain terms ; especially an advance in money, and pensions to his friends. But the Queen deemed his demands exorbitant; and, as was not unfrequent with her when pressed by a difficulty from which she saw no immediate escape, she dismissed the subject from her mind, and unwisely took refuge in delay. In this manner \" the great matter\" for the present was allowed to sleep ; and Mary owed her life to the parsimony of Elizabeth, and the avarice of the Scottish Regent.1 Killigrew not long after left Scotland, and on parting with him, Morton assured Leicester, in a letter which this Ambassador carried with him, \"that no stranger had ever departed from that country with greater liking and contentment of the people.\"2 He requested him at the same time, on his return to the English Court, to communicate with the Queen and Council, upon some subjects of import, which required a speedy answer. These embraced the dangers to which the Protestant interest in Scotland was exposed from continental intrigue ; but to the Regent's mortification, many months elapsed before any answer was received. At last, Walsingham, alarmed by the apathy of Elizabeth, and the continued practices of her enemies, endeavoured, in a letter of 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. Aberdeen.

He told her, that he had recently received a despatch from the Scottish Regent, and with it some intercepted papers of the Bishop of Ross, which required instant consideration. They would convince her, he trusted, how utterly hollow were the promises of France and Spain, and to what imminent danger she was exposed from \" unsound subjects at home.\" He besought her deeply to weigh the matter, and \" set to\" her hand for the protection of her realm : observed that, \" Though the Cardinal of Lorrain were dead, he had left successors enough to execute his plots;\" and conjured her to use expedition, before the hidden sparks of treason, now smouldering within the realm, should break out into an unquench able fire. \" For the love of God, madam,\" said he, \" let not the case of your diseased estate hang longer in deliberation. Diseased estates are no more cured by consultation without execution, than unsound bodies by mere conference with the physician ; and you will perceive by his letters, how much the Regent is aggrieved.\" x For a moment, these strong representations alarmed Elizabeth, and she talked of sending Killigrew or Randolph immediately into Scotland ; 2 but her rela- 1 MS.

She had entered into an amicable correspondence with Cathe rine de Medicis. The Duke D'Alencon still warmly prosecuted his marriage suit ; and although the English Queen had not the slightest intentions of granting it, she, as usual, dallied and coquetted with the proposal. In the midst of all, Charles the Ninth died ; the Queen became engrossed with the specula tions and uncertainties which follow a new succession; and Morton, irritated by neglect, was driven by re sentment and necessity to cultivate the friendship of that party in Scotland which was devoted to France. This alienation was soon detected by Walsingham, who wrote in alarm to Burghley, and on the suc ceeding day to Elizabeth, adjuring her, \"for the love of God, to arrest the impending mischief, and secure the Scottish amity, which of all others stood them at that moment in greatest stead.

Elizabeth was at last roused, and gave orders for the despatch of Henry Killigrew into Scotland, accompanied by Mr Davison, afterwards the cele brated Secretary, whom he was directed to leave as English resident at the Scottish Court.1 But before the Ambassador crossed the Border, an affray broke out, which threatened the most serious consequences, and arrested him at Berwick. At a Warden Court, held by Sir John Forster, Warden of the Middle Marches, and Sir John Carmichael, Keeper of Lid desdale, a dispute arose which led to high words between these two leaders ; and their followers, taking fire, assaulted each other. The Scots at first were repulsed, but being joined by a body of their countrymen from Jedburgh, rallied, attacked, and totally routed the English. Sir John Heron, Keeper of Tynedale, was slain ; whilst Sir John Forster, Sir Francis Russell, Sir Cuthbert Collingwood, Mr Ogle, Mr Fenwick, and about three hundred men, were made prisoners, and carried by the Earl of Angus to the Regent at Dalkeith. Morton received them with much courtesy, dismissed the prisoners of inferior rank, and expressed, in a letter to Elizabeth, his readiness (to afford redress: but he detained the Lord Warden; and when the Queen insisted that the Regent should meet Lord Huntingdon, the President of the North, in a personal conference in England, he peremptorily refused. Such a proceed ing, he said, was beneath the dignity of the office he 1 MS. St. P. Off. Orig. Instructions to Henry Killigrew, 27th May, 1 575."], [43, "1575. 19 REGENCY OF MORTON. held ; but he offered to send the Justice Clerk to arrange a meeting in Scotland.1 On being informed of this, Elizabeth, already chafed by the detention of her Warden, broke into one of those furious fits of passion which sometimes caused her highest councillors to tremble for their heads, and disagreeably reminded them of her father. In this frame she dictated a violent message to the Scottish Regent, which she commanded Killigrew to deliver without reserve or delay. She had seen, she said, certain demands made, on his part, by the Justice- clerk, and did not a little wonder at so strange and insolent a manner of dealing. He had already been guilty of a foul fact in detaining her Warden, the Governor of one of the principal forts in her realm ; he had committed a flagrant breach of treaty ; and had she been inclined to prosecute her just revenge, he should soon have learnt what it was for one of his base calling to offend one of her quality. And, whereas, continued she, he goeth about to excuse the detaining of our Warden, alleging that he feared he might revenge himself when his blood was roused for his kinsman's death, \u2014 such an excuse seemed to her, she must tell him, a scornful aggravation of his fault ; for she would have him to know, that neither Forster nor any other public officer or private subject of hers dared to offer such an outrage to her government, as, for private revenge, to break a public treaty. As to the conference with Huntingdon, instead of receiving 1 MS. Relation of the Affairs of Scotland from 1566 to 1570. Warrender MS. Collections, vol. B. sol. 208."], [44, "1575. 20 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. her offer with gratitude, he had treated it with con tempt. He had taken upon him to propose a place of meeting, four miles within Scotland ; an ambitious part in him, and savouring so much of an insolent desire of sovereignty, that shewould have scorned such a request had it come from the King his master, or the greatest Prince in Europe. To conclude, she in formed him that, if he chose to confer with the Earl of Huntingdon at the Bond Rode} she was content; and he would do well to remember that his prede cessor the Regent Murray had not scrupled to come to York, and afterwards to London, to hold a consul tation with her commissioners.2 This passionate invective I have given, as it is high ly characteristic of the Queen; but Huntingdon and Killigrew deemed it proper to soften its expressions, in conveying the substance of it to the Regent, whom they had no mind unnecessarily to irritate.3 Even in its diluted state, however, it awed him into submis sion. He met the English President on the 16th of August at the appointed place, arranged all differ ences, and not only dismissed his prisoners, but load ed them with presents, and sent Carmichael up to England to ask pardon of Elizabeth. Amongst his gifts were some choice falcons ; upon which a saying rose amongst the Borderers, alluding to the death of 1 The Bond Rode, or boundary road, a place or road on the Marches near Berwick, common to both kingdoms. 2 MS.

On his arrival there, he perceived everywhere indications of the same flourishing condi tion in which he had lately left the country. Whilst the people seemed earnestly disposed to preserve the amity with England, all lamented the late accident on the Borders; and the ministers in their sermons prayed fervently for the continuance of the peace. As to the Regent himself, the Ambassador found him still firm in his affection to England, and in resisting the advances of France. Although not popular, generally, the vigour and success of his government were admitted even by his enemies: property and person were secure; and he gave an example of this in his own conduct ; for he never used a guard, and would pursue his diversions, walking abroad with his fishing-rod over his shoulder, or his hawk on his wrist,2 almost alone, to the wonder of many. The Borders, since the late disturbance, had been quiet ; and so rapidly had the foreign commerce of the coun try increased, that Killigrew reckoned it able to raise twenty thousand mariners. Such was the favourable side of the picture ; but 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. B.C. Huntingdon to Leicester, 14th August, 1575. Ibid. MS. Letter. Huntingdon to Sir T. Smith, 17th August, 1575. Also MS.

It was reported that Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh, who had shot the Regent Murray, and fled to the continent after the murder, was to be brought home by the Lord of Arbroath. This nobleman was second son of the late Duke of Chastelherault, and, owing to the insanity of Arran his elder brother, had become the chief leader of the Hamiltons. The idea of the return of his murderer, roused the friends of the late Regent to the highest pitch of resentment; and Douglas of Lochleven, his near kinsman, assembling a force of twelve hundred men, vowed deadly vengeance against both the as sassin and Arbroath his chief. The Earls of Argyle, Athol, Buchan, and Mar, with Lords Lindsay and Ruthven, espoused the quarrel of Lochleven; Arbroath, on the other hand, would be supported, it was said, by all the friends of France and the Queen; whilst Morton in vain endeavoured to bring both parties to respect the laws. Arbroath, too, meditated a a marriage with the Lady Buccleugh, sister to the Earl of Angus, the Regent's nephew and heir; and when Morton appeared to countenance the match, a clamour arose amongst the young King's friends that he showed an utter disregard to the safety of his sove reign. Was not the Duke, they said, failing the King, the next heir to the throne ? was not Arran his eldest son mad ? and did not the right of the royal succes sion devolve on Arbroath ? Had the Regent forgotten the ambition of the House of Hamilton, and Arbroath's"], [47, "1575. REGENCY OF MORTON. 23 familiarity with blood ? and would he strengthen the hands of such a man by a marriage in his own family ? If so, he need not look for the support of any faithful subject who tendered the young King's preservation.1 To these were added other causes of disquiet and difficulty. Morton was no longer popular with the citizens of Edinburgh ; nor, indeed, could he reckon upon the support of any of the middle or lower classes in the state. His exactions had completely disgusted the merchants of the capital. He had imprisoned the most opulent amongst them, and this caused so great an outcry that many scrupled not to say, that, if he did not speedily change his measures the same burghers' hands which had put him up, would as surely pull him down again. To all these causes of discontent, must be added his quarrel with the Kirk, and the soreness arising out of his recent establishment of Episcopacy. This had given mortal offence to some of the leading ministers, who consi dered the appointment of Bishops, Abbots, and other Catholic dignitaries to be an unchristian and hetero dox practice, utterly at variance with the great prin ciples of their Reformation. They arraigned, and with justice, as far as regarded the Regent, the selfish and venal feelings which had led to the preservation of this alleged relic of Popery. It was evident, they said, that avarice, and not religion, was at the root of the whole. The nobles and the laity had already seized a large portion of the Church lands, and their 1 Murdin, pp. 282, 283."], [48, "1575. 24 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. greedy eyes still coveted more. These prizes they were determined to retain; whilst the poor ministers who laboured in the vineyard, and to whom the thirds of the benefices had been assigned, found this a nominal provision, and were unable, with their utmost efforts, to extract a pittance from the collectors ; the whole of the rents finding their way into the purses of the Regent and his favourites. And how utterly ridiculous was this last settlement of the Bishops? Was it not notorious that the See attached to the primacy of St Andrew's belonged, in reality, to Mor ton himself? that there was a secret agreement, a nefarious collusion, between him and the Prelate, his own near relative, whom he had placed in it ? Was it not easy to see that the chief purpose of this eccle siastical office was to enable the Regent more readily and decently to suck out the riches of the benefice, as, in the north country, farmers would sometimes stuff a calf's skin, called there a Tulchan, and set it up before a cow to make her give her milk more will ingly? What were all these Bishops, and Abbots, and Priors, whom they now heard so much about, but mere Tulchans, \u2014 men of straw, \u2014 clerical calves, set up by the nobility to facilitate their own Simo niacal operations ? These arguments, which were enforced with much popular eloquence and humour, by those ministers who were attached to the Presbyterian form of Church Government, produced a great effect upon the people, already sufficiently disgusted by the ex actions and tyranny of the Regent. Morton, too,"], [49, "1575. REGENCY OF MORTON. 25 increased the discontent by his violence, threatening the most zealous of the ministers, and broadly declaring that there would be no peace or order in the country till some of them were hanged.1 At this crisis, Andrew Melville, a Scottish scholar of good family, who had been educated first in his native country, and afterwards brought up in the strictest principles of Calvin and Beza at Geneva, returned to Scotland from the continent. He was profoundly skilled in the Greek and Latin languages, and calculated, both by his learning and enthusiasm, to be of essential service to the reviving literature of his country ; but he was rash and imperious, a keen republican, sarcastic and severe in his judgment of others, and with little command of temper. Soon after his arrival he acquired a great influence over Durie, one of the leading ministers of the Kirk, who, at his instigation, began to agitate the question, whether the office of a Bishop was consistent with the true principles of Church Government as they could be gathered from the Word of God ? After various arguments and consultations held upon the subject, a form of Church polity was drawn up by some of the leading ministers; and the Regent, with greater in dulgence than his former proceedings had promised, appointed some members of the Council to take it into consideration : but they had scarcely met, when the State was suddenly plunged into new troubles, which at once broke off their conference. 1 Calderwood, MS. Hist. British Museum. Ayscough's Cata logue, No. 4735, p. 1053 of the MS."], [50, "1575. 26 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. This revolution originated in a coalition of the Earls of Athol and Argyle against the Regent. Both these noblemen were of great power and posses sions, and could command nearly the whole of the north of Scotland. Athol, a Stewart, was considered the leader of that party which had recently attached themselves to the young King, under the hope of prevailing upon him to assume the Government in his own person. Being a Roman Catholic, he was, for this reason, much suspected by Morton; and he, in his turn, hated the Regent for his cruel conduct to Lethington, to whom Athol had been linked in the closest friendship. Argyle, on the other hand, although he had formerly been united with Morton in most of his projects, was now completely estranged from his old comrade; and the cause of quarrel was to be traced to the Regent's cupidity. Argyle had married the widow of the Regent Murray, Agnes Keith, a sister of the Earl Marshal, and through her had got possession of some of the richest of the Queen's jewels. These Mary had delivered to Murray in a moment of misplaced confidence. He, as was asserted, had advanced money upon them to the State; at his death they remained in the hands of his widow; and Morton now insisted on recovering them, in obedience to an order given on the subject by Parliament. Argyle and his lady resisted; and although the jewels were at last surrendered, it was not till the noble persons who detained them were threatened with arrest. This, and other causes of dispute, had en tirely alienated Argyle from Morton : but, for a short"], [51, "1576. REGENCY OF MORTON. 27 season, the Regent derived security from the san guinary contests between the two northern Earls themselves. Their private warfare, however, which had threatened to involve in broils and bloodshed the whole of the north, was suddenly composed ; and by one of those rapid changes which were by no means unfrequent in feudal Scotland, the two fierce rivals, instead of destroying each other, united in a league against the Regent. This new state of things is to be traced to the influence of Alexander Erskine, the Governor of the King and Commander of Stirling Castle. This gentleman had recently discovered that Morton, with that subtle and treacherous policy, of which he had already given many proofs, was secretly plotting to get possession of the person of the young monarch, and to place a creature of his own in com mand of the Castle of Stirling. To confound his scheme, Erskine, who was beloved by the higher nobles, and a principal member of the confederacy which had been formed for the King's protection, wrote secretly to Athol and Argyle, inviting them to come to Stirling, assuring them that James was al ready well disposed to redress their complaints against the Regent, and promising them immediate access to the royal person. It is scarcely to be believed that these plots and jealousies should have altogether escaped the atten tion of Morton. He had his secret emissaries both in Scotland and in England, and he must have been well aware of his increasing unpopularity. The age of the young King, who had now completed his twelfth year."], [52, "1576. 28 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and begun to take an interest in the Government, admonished him that every succeeding year would render it a more difficult task for any Regent to engross the supreme power; and as long as James remained under the care of Alexander Erskine, whom he had reason to believe his enemy, it was evident that the continuance of his authority must be pre carious. Already, he saw his sovereign surrounded by those who, for their own ends, sought to persuade him that he was arrived at an age when he ought to take the Government into his own hands. So far-sighted and experienced a political intriguer as Morton, could not be sensible of all this, without speculating on the best mode of encountering the storm when it did arrive, and averting the wreck of his power. To continue sole Regent much longer was evidently full of difficulty ; but to flatter the young Monarch by a nominal sovereignty, and to rule him as effectually under the title of King, as he had done when sole Regent, would be no arduous matter, considering his tender years, provided he could undermine the influence of Erskine his Governor, and crush the confederacy with Argyle and Athol. In the mean season, he resolved to await his time, and watch their proceedings. But the Regent, although cautious and calculating, was not aware of the full extent of the confederacy against him ; and the catastrophe arrived more suddenly than he had anticipated. The intrigues of Argyle and Athol had not escaped the eyes of Walsingham; and in December, 1577, Elizabeth, suspecting an"], [53, "1577. 29 REGENCY OF MORTON. impending revolution, despatched Sir Robert Bowes to Scotland, with the hope of preventing any open rupture between Morton and the nobility. He was instructed to inculcate the absolute necessity of union, to prevent both themselves and her kingdom from falling a sacrifice to the practices of foreign powers ; and to threaten Morton, that, if he continued refractory, and refused to make up his differences with his opponents, she would make no scruple to cast him oft*, and herself become a party against him. He carried also a flattering letter from the Queen to the Earl of Athol, in which she assured him of her favourable feelings and recommended peace.1 For a moment, the envoy appears to have suc ceeded ; but he was aware that the friendship pro fessed on both sides was hollow, and the lull of civil faction only temporary. This is evident from a letter which he wrote to Leicester, upon his return to Berwick : \u2014 \" Albeit,\" said he, \" those matters (in Scotland) are for a season wrapped up, yet it is not unlike, without wise handling and some charge to her Majesty, that the fire will be readily kindled again. * * * The readiest way, in my opinion, to preserve the realm in quietness, with continuance of this amity, is to appease and 2 all the griefs between the Regent and others of the realm, and by friendly reconciliation and union to make him gracious 1 MS.

For which he must receive some apt lessons, with gentleness, from her Majesty : but with the same, he must also, receive some comfort, agree able to his nature.\"1 It is evident from this, that Bowes had become convinced that, to conciliate Mor ton and preserve peace, Elizabeth must deal less in objurgation, and more in solid coin, than she had lately done ; nor need we wonder that the envoy, afraid of undertaking so delicate a task, was happy to return: but the Queen, who had received some new and alarming information of the success of French intrigue in Scotland, commanded him to re visit Edinburgh, and watch the proceedings of both parties. Even this, however, did not appear enough : and soon after, Randolph was despatched on a mission to the young King and the Regent; its object being similar to that of Bowes', but his instructions more urgent and decided.2 Some delay, however, occurred; and he had scarcely arrived in Scotland, when the clouds which had been so long gathering burst upon the head of the Regent. The rapidity of the move ments of the conspirators, and their complete success, were equally remarkable. On the 4th of March, (1577-8) Argyle rode with his usual retinue to Stir ling, and being immediately admitted by Erskine to an interview with the young King, complained loudly 1 MS. Letter, Brit.

REGENCY OF MORTON. 31 of Morton's insolent and oppressive conduct, not only to himself, but to the whole nobility and people. He implored him to call a Convention to examine his complaints; and, if he found them true, to take the Government upon himself, and put an end to a system which, whilst it cruelly opprest his subjects, left him nothing but the name of a King. These arguments were enforced by Erskine the Governor ; the famous Buchanan, one of the tutors of the young monarch, threw all his weight into the same scale ; and the other confederates who had joined the conspiracy, Glammis the Chancellor, the Abbot of Dunfermline, the Secretary, Tullibardin the Comptroller, and the Lords Lindsay, Ruthven, Ogilvy and others, eagerly joined in recommending such a course. Athol at this time was absent : but he arrived, no doubt by concert, at the moment his presence was most neces sary; and being instantly admitted into the castle, and led to the King, his opinion was urgently de manded. Scarcely, however, had he time to deliver it, and to express his detestation of the tyranny by which they had been so long kept down, when a messenger brought letters from Morton, keenly re probating the conduct of the northern Earls. He remonstrated with the King on the outrage com mitted against his royal person and himself; repre sented the necessity of inflicting on such bold offenders speedy and exemplary punishment ; and concluded by declaring his anxiety to resign his office, if his royal master was prepared to overlook such proceed ings. This offer was too tempting to be rejected :"], [56, "32 1577-8. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. letters were addressed to the nobility requiring their instant attendance at court. Argyle, Athol, and Erskine, took care that those summonses should find their way only to their friends. The Convention assembled ; a resolution was unanimously passed that the King should take the Government upon himself; and before the Regent had time to retract, he was waited upon by Glammis the Chancellor, and Lord Herries, who brought a message from his Sovereign, requiring his immediate resignation. Although startled at the suddenness of the demand, Morton was too proud, or too wary, to pretend any repugnance. He received the envoys with cheerfulness ; rode with them from his castle at Dalkeith to the capital ; and there, at the Cross, heard the herald and the messenger-at-arms proclaim his own deprivation, and the assumption of the Government by the young- King. He then, in the presence of the people, re signed the ensigns of his authority; and, without a murmur or complaint, retired to one of his country seats, where he seemed wholly to forget his ambition, and to be entirely engrossed in the tranquil occupa tions of husbandry and gardening, The news of this revolution was instantly com municated by Randolph to his friend Killigrew, in this laconic and characteristic epistle, Avritten when he was on the eve of throwing himself on horse back to proceed to England, and in person inform Elizabeth of the alarming change. \" All the devils in hell are stirring and in o-reat rage in this country.

His high office was bestowed upon Athol, Morton's chief enemy, and the leader of the confederacy which had deposed him. But this, though it preserved the influence of the successful faction, scarcely compensated for the loss of their associate, who was accounted one of the wisest and most learned men in Scotland. Meanwhile, the confederated nobles followed up their advantages. As the King was not yet thirteen, a Council of twelve was appointed. It consisted of the Earls of Argyle, Athol, Montrose, and Glencairn ; the Lords Ruthven, Lindsay, and Herries ; the Ab bots of Newbottle and Dunfermline ; the Prior of St Andrew's : and two supernumerary or extraordinary Councillors ; Buchanan, the King's tutor, and James Makgill, the Clerk-Register.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. as the first exercise of their power, they required from Morton the delivery of the Castle of Edinburgh, the Palace of Holyrood, the Mint, and the Queen's jewels and treasure. To all this prostration of his former greatness, he appears to have made no resistance ; but simply required, that, in the next Parliament, they should pass an act approving of his administra tion during his continuance in the Regency. He then held a hurried conference with Randolph, before his setting off for the English Court ; intrusted him with a brief letter to his old friend, Lord Burghley, written in his new character as a private man,1 and seemed prepared, with perfect contentment, to sink into that condition. It was evident, however, from the expressions he used in this short note, that he had informed Ran dolph of some ulterior design for his resumption of power, which he did not choose to commit to writing; and that the Ambassador, long versant in Scottish broils and intrigues, considered it a wise and likely project. Nor was he wrong in this conclusion : for the development of this counter-revolution,' which restored Morton to power, followed almost imme diately; and the outbreak was as sudden, as the success was complete. The King's Lords, as Argyle and his friends were called, had formed their Council,2 assembled in the 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. The Earl Morton to Lord Burghley, 28th March, 1 578.

On the 24th of April, the General Assem bly met at Edinburgh; and having chosen Mr Andrew Melvil to be their Moderator, proceeded to their deliberations with their usual zeal and energy. It was determined to revise the Book of Church Policy, and lay it before the King and Council ; and a blow was aimed at the late Episcopal innovations, by a declaration that, owing to the great corruption already visible in the state of Bishops, no see should be filled up till the next General Assembly of the Church.1 During these transactions, Morton lived in retire ment, and appeared wholly engrossed in his rural occupations ; but he had secretly gained to his in terest the young Earl of Mar, whose sister was the wife of Angus, Morton's heir, and the head of the house of Douglas. To Mar, he artfully represented that he was unjustly and shamefully treated by his uncle, Erskine the Governor. He, the young Earl, who was no longer a boy, was entitled by hereditary right to the government of Stirling Castle ; but his uncle usurped it, and with it kept hold of the King's person. It was Alexander Erskine, not the Earl of Mar, who was now considered the head of that ancient house. Would he submit to this ignominy, when, by a bold stroke, he might recover his lost rights ; when the house of Douglas, with all its strength and vassalage, was ready to take his part ; 1 MS. Calderwood, pp. 105.5-10.5sl."], [60, "1578. 36 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and his uncles, the Abbots of Dryburgh, and Cam buskenneth, offered their council and assistance ? These arguments easily gained over the young lord ; and as he and his retinue were generally lodged in the castle, he determined to put Morton's plan in execution. On the 26th April, about five in the morning, be fore many of the garrison were stirring, Mar, who had slept that night in the castle, assembled his retinue, under the pretence of a hunting party, and riding to the gates with the Abbots of Dryburgh and Cambuskenneth, called for the keys. He was met by his uncle, Erskine the Governor, with a small com pany, who, for the moment, suspected nothing; but finding himself rudely accosted as a usurper by the Abbots, instantly dreaded some false play. To shout treason, seize a halbert from one of the guard, and call to his servants, was with. Erskine the work of a moment; but, ere assistance arrived, his little band was surrounded, his son crushed to death in the tumult, and himself thrust without the gates into an outer hall, whilst Mar seized the keys, put down all resistance, and became master of the castle. In the midst of this uproar the young King awoke, and rushing in great terror from his chamber, tore his hair, and called out that the Master of Erskine was slain. He was assured that his governor was safe ; and the Earl of Argyle, who had been roused by the tumult, finding the two Abbots arguing with Erskine in the hall, but showing him no personal violence, affected to consider it a family quarrel, between the"], [61, "1578. 37 JAMES VI. uncle and the nephew, and retired, after advising an amicable adjustment. News of the tumult was, that evening, carried to the Council at Edinburgh, accom panied by an assurance from Mar, Argyle, and Buch anan the King's tutor, that the dispute was adjusted. Upon this they despatched Montrose, the same night, to Stirling ; who, coming alone, was courteously re ceived and admitted into the castle : but next day when the Council rode thither in a body and de manded admittance, this was peremptorily refused by Mar. They should all see the King, he said, but it must be one by one ; and no Councillor should enter the gates with more than one attendant.1 Incensed at this indignity, the Council assembled in Stirling, and issued a proclamation, prohibiting any resort of armed men thither, whilst they sent secret orders to convoke their own forces. But their measures were too late: Douglas of Lochleven had already entered the castle, joined Mar, and commu nicated with Morton, whose hand, it was strongly suspected, although it did not appear, had managed the whole. Angus, meantime, by his directions was ready, at six hours' warning, with all the armed vassals of the house of Douglas ; and the ex-Regent, forgetting his gardens and pleasure grounds, hurried from his rural seclusion and reappeared in public, the same subtle, daring, and unscrupulous leader as before.2 1 MS.

Events now crowded rapidly on each other. At the earnest request of the young King, an agreement took place between Mar and his uncle, Alexander Erskine. The Earl retained the Castle of Stirling, and with it the custody of the royal person. To the Master of Erskine, so Alexander was called, was given the keeping of the Castle of Edinburgh ; and in a meeting held at Craigmillar, between Morton, Athol, and Argyle, it was decided that they should next day repair together to Stirling, and adjust all differences before the King in person. This was determined on the 8th of May ; and that evening the two northern Earls, after sharing Morton's hospitality at Dalkeith, rode with him to Edinburgh. In the morning, how ever, Morton was nowhere to be found ; and it turned out that he had risen before daybreak, and, with a small retinue, had galloped to Stirling, where he was received within the castle, and soon resumed his ascendancy both over Mar and the King.1 Against this flagrant breach of agreement, Argyle and Athol loudly remonstrated; and Sir Robert Bowes, the English Ambassador, exerting himself to to Burghley, written in the midst of this revolution, and on the very day the Council rode to Stirling, he says, \u2014 \" What storm shall fall out of these swelling heats, doth not yet appear. But I think, verily, within two or three days, it will burst into some open matter, discovering sufficiently the purposes intended; wherein, to my power, I shall seek to quench all violent rages, and persuade to unity and concord amongst them.\" 1 MS.

Other Lords obeyed, but came fully armed, and with troops of vassals at their back ; and both factions mustered in such strength, and exhibited such rancour, that, but for the remonstrances of Bowes, the country would have hurried into war. Amidst the clamour and confusion, however, it was evident that the ex-Regent directed all. By his per suasion a new Council was appointed, in which he held the chief place. It was next determined to send the Abbot of Dunfermline as Ambassador from the young King to Elizabeth. He was instructed to thank that Princess for the special favour with which she had regarded him from his birth, to confirm the peace between the two countries, and to propose a stricter league for mutual defence, and the main tenance of true religion.1 The Parliament had been summoned to meet in July at Edinburgh : but Morton was well aware of his unpopularity in that city, and dreaded to bring the King into the midst of his enemies. By his per suasion, therefore, the young monarch changed the place of assembly to the great hall within Stirling- Castle, where he knew all would be secure. But 1 MS. Draft, St. P. Off. 18th June, 1578."], [64, "40 1578. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. this new measure gave deep offence ; and when the day approached, Argyle, Athol, Montrose, Lindsay, and Herries, with their adherents, assembled in the capital, declaring that nothing should compel them to attend a Parliament within a citadel garrisoned by their mortal enemies, and where it would be a mockery to expect any free discussion. Despising this opposition, Morton hurried on his measures, and the Estates assembled in the great hall within Stirling Castle.1 It was opened by the King in person ; but scarcely had the members taken their seats, when Montrose and Lord Lindsay pre sented themselves as Commissioners from Argyle, Athol, and their adherents, and declared that this could in no sense be called a free Parliament. It was held, they said, within an armed fortress ; and for this cause the noble peers, whose messengers they were, had refused to attend it ; and we now come, said Lindsay, with his usual brevity and bluntness, to protest against its proceedings. Morton here inter rupted him, and commanded him and his companion to take their places; to which Lindsay answered, that he would stand there till the King ordered him to his seat. James then repeated the command, and the old lord sat down. After a sermon, which was preached by Duncanson, the minister of the royal household, and a harangue by Morton, who, in the absence of Athol the Chancellor, took upon him to fill his place, the Estates proceeded to choose the Lords of the Articles ; upon which Lindsay again 1 July 16, 1578."], [65, "1578. 41 .TAMES Vs. broke in upon the proceedings, calling all to witness, that every act of such a Parliament was null, and the choosing of the lords an empty farce. This second attack threw Morton into an ungovernable rage, in which he unsparingly abused his old associate. \" Think ye, Sir,\" said he, \"that this is a court of churls or brawlers? Take your own place, and thank God that the King's youth keeps you safe from his resent ment.\" \" I have served the King in his minority,\" said Lindsay, \" as faithfully as the proudest among ye; and I think to serve his Grace no less truly in his majority.\" Upon which, Morton was observed to whisper something in the King's ear, who, blush ing and hesitating, delivered himself of a little speech, which, no doubt, had been prepared for him before hand. \" Lest any man,\" said he, \" should judge this not to be a free Parliament, I declare it free ; and those who love me will think as I think.\"1 This silenced Lindsay, and the proceedings went on ; but Montrose, abruptly leaving the hall, rode post to Edinburgh. It was reported that he bore a secret letter from the King, imploring his subjects to arm and relieve him from the tyranny of Morton. It is certain, that the recusant Earl drew a vivid picture of the late Regent's insolence, and roused the citizens to such a pitch of fury, that they mustered in arms, and declared that they would rescue their Sovereign from the hands of a traitor who had sold them to the English. Nothing could be more grate ful to Argyle and Athol than such a spirit ; and 1 MS. Calderwood, Brit. Mus, pp. 1062, 1065,"], [66, "1578. 42 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. sending word to the townsmen, that they would speedily join them with a force which would soon bring their enemies to reason, they summoned their feudal services, and prepared for war.1 Montrose's sudden retreat saved him from imprison ment ; for next day an order of Privy-council ap peared, commanding him and Lindsay his associate to confine themselves to their own lodgings under pain of rebellion.2 In the meantime the Parliament proceeded. Morton's demission of the Regency, and the King's acceptance of the government were confirmed. An ample approval and discharge was given him of all the acts done during his Regency, and a new Council appointed, in which he himself sat as chief, and could, in any emergency, command a ma jority. The revolution was thus complete. He had lost the name of Regent, but he had retained his power ; and the nominal assumption of the govern ment by the young King had removed many difficul ties which before trammelled and perplexed him.3 But this daring and experienced politician had men to deal with who, having been trained in his own school, were not easily put down ; and scarcely had the arrangements for the new government been com pleted, when Argyle and Athol occupied the city of Edinburgh, and communicating with the leading 1 MS.

It was in vain that Sir Robert Bowes, the English Ambassa dor, remonstrated against this violence ; in vain that a charge from the Privy-council was fulminated against the two Earls, commanding them, on pain of treason, to depart from Edinburgh within twenty four hours. Both sides flew to arms : the country, so lately restored to peace, again resounded with warlike preparation : proclamations, and counter proclamations were discharged against each other ; summonses for their armed vassals issued in every direction; and so readily were the orders obeyed, that Argyle and Athol, who had marched out of Edinburgh on the 11th August with only one thou sand men, found themselves, on mustering at Falkirk on the 13th, seven thousand strong. Of these troops the greater part were animated by the deadliest hatred of Morton ; especially the hardy bands of the Merse and Teviotdale, led by their wardens Colding knowes and Cessford. They carried before them a banner of blue sarsnet, on which was painted a boy Within a grated window, with the distich \"Liberty I crave, and cannot it have.\"1 This was meant to represent the King's thraldom to Morton ; and below it was their answer, declaring that they would die to set him free. On the other side came Angus, who 1 MS. Letter, Calig. C. v. sol. 101, Lord Hunsdon to Burghley, Aug. 19, 1578, Berwick.

The young King, or rather Morton in his name, declared, that foreseeing the wreck and misery of the realm, if the present divisions were not speedily removed, he Was ready to meet the wishes of the Queen of England ; and there fore commanded his nobility, on both sides, to dis band their forces. To reassure Argyle and Athol's faction, their late conduct in taking arms was accepted as loyal service ; Argyle, Lindsay, and Morton, so recently denounced as traitors, were added to the Privy-council ; a committee of eight noblemen was to be chosen, to advise with the King upon the best mode of reconciling his nobility; and, from this moment, free access was to be afforded to all noble men, barons, or gentlemen, who came to offer their service to their Prince.2 To these conditions both parties agreed ; and by the judicious management of 1 MS.

Bowes, Scotland was saved for the present from the misery of civil war. This minister, after the service he had thus per formed, remained for some time resident Ambassador at the Scottish court ; where Morton's successful in trigues had once more established him as the chief ruler in the state ; a result which was viewed with much satisfaction by Elizabeth, who, even after his demission of his high office, had never ceased to give him the title of Regent.1 For the name, however, he cared little : it was power to which he looked ; and this, having for the moment secured, he was de termined not speedily again to lose. The great principles upon which he had hitherto conducted the Government, were a strict amity with England, op position to all foreign intrigue, a determined resist ance to the deliverance of the Scottish Queen, and a resolution to maintain the Protestant faith. On this last important point, however, his motives had be come suspected by the influential body of the minis ters of the Kirk. This was owing to his introduc tion into Scotland of the Episcopal form of Church government, and his resistance to the book of Church polity which had been drawn up by the General Assembly, and presented to the King and the three Estates for their approval. Yet still, although no longer the favourite of the clergv, Morton was anti- Catholic enough to be preferred by them to Athol, a professed Roman Catholic, and his associates, who, 1 Instructions to Randolph, 31st January, 1578, Caligula, C. v. sol. Ill, Brit. Mus."], [70, "46 1578. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. V for the most part, were either avowed or suspected Romanists ; and for' the present the ministers re frained from endangering the restored peace of the country by any violence of opposition. Yet it was impossible for any acute observer not to see that the times were precarious. The elements of discord were lulled in their active efforts, but not destroyed ; the intrigues of France and Spain for the deliverance of Mary, and the reestablishment of the ancient faith, were still busily carried on ; and Bowes the Ambassador, who, from long experience, was in timately acquainted with the state of the rival fac tions, regarded the Court and the country as on the eve of another change. On the 3d November, shortly previous to his leaving Scotland, he thus wrote from Edinburgh to Lord Burghley : \u2014 \" By my common letters to the Lords of her Ma jesty's Council, the weltering estate of this realm, that nowattendeth but a tide for a new alteration of the Court, will appear to your Lordship, and how necessary it is in this change approaching, and in the confederacies presently knitting, to get some hold for her Majesty amongst them.\"1 It had been his own earnest endeavour to get such hold over them ; and for this purpose he had entered into negotiations with the Earl of Caithness, one of the principal lead ers of the confederacy against Morton. He and his associates had sent articles of agreement, in the usual 1 MS. Letter, Brit. Mus. Caligula, C. v. sol. 109. Sir R. Bowes to Burghley, 3d November, 1578, Edinburgh."], [71, "1578. 47 JAMES VI. form, to the English Ambassador : but they expected, also, the usual gratuity ; and as it turned out, valued their devotion to Elizabeth at a higher rate than that parsimonious Princess was disposed to reckon it. Caithness, indeed, was of loose and accommodating principles, both in politics and religion ; and although Bowes flattered himself that, on his departure from Scotland, he had left the faction opposed to Morton very favourably disposed to England, he did not con ceal from Walsingham his apprehensions that the continuance of this feeling was precarious. \" I fear,\" said he, in his letter to this minister, \" that no great inwardness shall be found in them, when they find her Majesty's liberality coming slowly to them, that use not often at the fairest call to stoop to empty lure.\"1 These apprehensions of the English minister regard ing the unsettled state of Scotland were not without good foundation. Mary's indefatigable friend, the Bishop of Ross, whose intrigues in the affair of the Duke of Norfolk had already given such alarm to Elizabeth, was now busily employed on the Conti nent, exciting France, Spain, Germany, and the Papal Court, to unite for her deliverance ; and holding out the present crisis of affairs in Scotland as eminently favourable for the restoration of the true faith. The extent to which these operations were carried, was amply proved by a packet of intercepted letters, written in cipher, and seized by Walsingham or Burghley, whose spies and informers were scattered 1 MS. Letter, Brit. Mus. Caligula, C. v. sol. 110. Sir R. Bowes to , Nov. 24, 1578. I suspect to Walsingham."], [72, "48 1578. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. all over Europe. It was found that the Earl of Athol, a Roman Catholic, the great leader of the late cabal against Morton, and Chancellor of Scotland, was in constant correspondence with the Bishop of Ross. The letters of the Scottish Queen herself, written immediately after Morton's resignation of the Regency, to the same prelate, and directed to be communicated to the Pope, expressed her satisfaction at the late revolution in Scotland, and her zealous concurrence with his Holiness in his project for the restitution of the true faith in Britain, by the united efforts of the great Catholic powers. She alluded, in the same letter, to a project for the carrying off' her son, the young King, to the Continent, which the Pope had offered to forward by an advance of money. She informed him, that in consequence of the changes in Scotland since Morton's demission, she felt per fectly assured of the affection and services of the young Prince, and of his councillors ; she urged the necessity of placing him, if possible, in the hands of her friends of the house of Lorrain ; alluding to the imminent danger he incurred from Elizabeth's in trigues to get possession of his person, or even to deprive him of his life ; she declared her conviction, that if her son were once in France, and removed from the sphere of Elizabeth's influence, a more lenient treatment of herself would ensue ; and, lastly, she directed Ross to communicate upon all these matters with the Pope's nuncio at Paris.1 1 MS. Brit. Mus. ex cyphris Regin\u00e6 Scoti\u00e6 ad Episcopum Rossensem, Caligula, C. v. sol. 102."], [73, "1578. 49 JAMES VI. In an intercepted letter, Avritten about the same time by Beaton, Bishop of Glasgow, Mary's Am bassador at the Court of France, to the Bishop of Ross, the determination of Henry the Third, and the Duke of Guise, to assist her to their utmost, was clearly intimated.1 In the autumn of the same year, and soon after the pacification between the rival factions in Scotland, which we have seen effected by Bowes, the Bishop of Ross made a progress into Germany, with the object of exciting the Emperor, and the Duke of Bavaria, to unite with the other Catholic Powers for the speedy liberation of his royal mistress, and the restoration of religion. From both potentates he received the utmost encourage ment. The Emperor declared his readiness to co operate with the endeavours of his brother Princes for the deliverance of the Scottish Queen, and the securing to her and her son their undoubted right to the English throne ; and the Duke professed his de termination to peril both property and life itself for the restoration of the Catholic faith.2 This encour aging information was conveyed by Ross to the Cardinal Como, in a letter written from Prague on the 27th September, 1.578, which, unfortunately for his mistress, fell into the hands of her enemies ; and, at the same time, this indefatigable prelate, at the request of the Emperor, had drawn up a paper on 1 Ex literis Archiesp.

In a second interview, to which the Emperor admitted him, he described the state of parties in Scotland, following certain heads communicated by his royal mistress ;2 and by all these united exertions, there is no doubt that a deep impression was made throughout Europe in favour of the Scottish Queen. Well, therefore, might Sir Robert Bowes describe the condition of affairs in Scotland as one full of alarm ; and before we con demn Elizabeth for her severity to Mary, we must weigh the perils to the Protestant faith which these intercepted letters so clearly demonstrated. But, on the other hand, it must not be forgotten, that these very dangers arose out of the injustice of her impri sonment. In the mean time, Morton once more bore the chief sway in Scotland, where his triumph over the conspiracy of Athol and Argyle had really increased his power; whilst his possession of the King's person enabled him to overawe the young monarch as effectually as he had ever done when Regent. This resumption of strength he now employed to crush the house of Hamilton. The Duke of Chastelherault was now dead; his eldest son the Earl of Arran, had been insane for some years ; and in these melancholy circumstances, 1 MS. Brit. Mus. Caligula, C. v. sol. 105. 2 Ibid.\" sol. 106."], [75, "1579. 51 JAMES VI. the leaders of this potent and ancient family were his brothers the Lord of Arbroath and Lord Claud Hamilton. Arbroath, in the event of the death of Mary and the young King, was next heir to the throne ; and his possessions were described by Bowes as the greatest and the richest in Scotland.1 These lands were conterminous with the vast estates of the Earl of Angus, which included nearly all the Over ward of Clydesdale, as Arbroath's did the Nether ward ; and Morton and the Douglases had long looked upon them with greedy eyes. But although his enmity against Arbroath and his brother was entirely selfish, Morton was not guilty of injustice when he persuaded the young King that it was his duty to proceed with severity against the house of Hamilton. It had a long reckoning of crime and blood to account for. There was little doubt that the late Archbishop of St Andrew's, its chief leader and adviser, had suffered justly as an accessory to the murder of Darnley ; and this cast a strong suspi cion of implication upon its present leaders. It was certain that they were guilty of the death of the Regent Murray ; it was as undoubted that Lord Claud Hamilton had given the order which led to the murder of the Regent Lennox ; and the houses of Mar and Douglas were bitterly hostile to the whole race. The Hamiltons being thus miserably situated, the 1 MS. Brit. Mus. Caligula, C. v. sol. 82.

Morton and Angus in person besieged the Castle of Hamilton, commanded by Arthur Hamilton of Merton.1 He offered to surrender on being assured of his life, and pardon to himself and his garrison of all their offences, except the murder of the King and the two Regents ; but these terms were scornfully refused, and he was at last compelled to submit un conditionally.2 Much interest was made to save him : but Mar and Buchan, with Lochleven and James Douglas, a natural son of Morton's, were furious at the idea of his escaping their vengeance ; declaring that the lives of any ten Hamiltons were a poor recompense for the Regent Murray. He and his company, therefore, were hanged ; amongst whom was Arthur Hamilton, a brother of Bothwellhaugh who shot the Regent, and was known to have held the stirrup when the murderer threw himself on horseback and escaped.3 The Castle of Draffen, an other stronghold of this great family, in which the Duchess of Chastelherault, and the unfortunate Earl of Arran, had taken refuge, was invested and taken 1 4th May, 1579- 2 MS.

Nothing could be more wretched than its condition at this moment. The Lord of Arbroath had fled to Flanders, where he was an almost houseless exile ; Lord Claud escaped to England, and threw himself upon the compassion of Elizabeth ; its lesser chiefs were trembling under an impending sentence of forfeiture ; and its head, the Earl of Arran, whose royal descent and great power had made him, in former days, an almost accepted suitor, first of Elizabeth, and after wards of Mary, was a prisoner, hopelessly insane, and placed, with his unhappy mother the. Duchess, under the charge of Captain Lammie, a soldier of fierce and brutal habits, and a determined enemy of the house of Hamilton. Yet these accumulated miseries do not appear to have excited the slightest degree of sympathy in this unfeeling age ; and when Elizabeth, compassionating the misfortunes of the Hamiltons, despatched her envoy Captain Arrington, to plead their cause at the Scottish Court, he found the young King, and the whole body of the nobility, inflamed with the deepest hatred against them, ex pressing a conviction that their continuance in Scot land was dangerous to his person, and resolute against their pardon or return.1 1 MS.

In the midst of these cruel transactions, Athol the Chancellor, and the great leader of the confederacy against Morton, died suddenly, and under circum stances of much suspicion.1 He had just returned from a banquet, given by Morton at Stirling, to com memorate the reconciliation of the nobles ; and the symptoms of poison so strongly indicated themselves both before and after death, that his friends did not hesitate to say publicly, that he had met with foul play from the ex-Regent, who treated the report with contempt. The body was opened, and examined by a learned circle of \" mediciners, chirurgeons, and poticaries ;\" but they disagreed in their verdict. By some the poison was so plainly detected, that they declared there was not a doubt upon the subject ; whilst Dr Preston, the most eminent physician of the time, was equally positive that there was no poison in the case, \u2014 certainly none in the stomach. On being irritated by contradiction, however, he had the temerity to touch a portion of its contents with his tongue, and, to the triumph of his dissentient breth ren, almost died in consequence, nor did he ever completely recover the unlucky experiment.2 In the mean time, though the dark report was thus strength- 1 He died at Kincardine on the 25th April, 1579. \"The whole friends of the dead are convened at Dunkeld upon the third of May, where the young Earls of Athol and Montrose put in deliberation what were best way to come by revenge of this hei nous fact.\" MS.

Sometime after this, the General Assembly of the Kirk met at Edinburgh ; and having chosen Mr Thomas Smeton for their moderator, at his request appointed a council of the brethren to advise with him upon matters of importance. To this council Mr Thomas Duncanson, Minister of the Royal House hold, presented a letter from the young King, which contained a request, that the Assembly would at present abstain from debating upon such matters touching the polity of the Kirk, as in a former con ference had been referred for debate and decision to the Estates of Parliament. The same letter informed them, that Parliament would shortly meet and take these matters into consideration ; and it expi'essed the King's hope, that, in the mean season, the Assembly would exert themselves to promote peace and godly living, not only amongst their own members, but throughout the whole body of the subjects of the realm; so that the expectations of such busy meddlers as were enemies to the public tranquillity, should be disappointed. The Assembly having taken this royal letter into consideration, in its turn appointed a committee of their brethren, \u2014 the principal of whom were Erskine of Dun, Duncanson the King's minister, and Andrew Melville, to wait upon the King, with some requests to which they besought his attention. These were \u2014 that he would interdict all parents, under heavy penalties, from sending their children to be educated"], [80, "56 1579.

It was immediately whispered, that he had been sent over by the Guises, to fill Athol's place as leader of the French faction, and to act as a counterpoise to 1 MS. Calderwood, sub anno 1 579, Brit.

He was accompanied by Monsieur Momberneau, and Mi- Henry Ker, \u2014 the first a man of great wit and liveli ness, gay, gallant, and excelling in all the sports and pastimes to which the young monarch was partial ; the second, Ker, of a more subtle and retired char acter, \u2014 who had been long a confidential servant of Aubigny's, and was strongly suspected by the minis ters of the Kirk to be a secret agent of the Guises. All this excited the fears of Elizabeth ; and the information sent her by her secret agents, both in Scotland and France, was by no means calculated to remove her apprehension. As D'Aubigny and his friends, however, acted as yet with great caution and reserve, the Queen contented herself, for the moment, with a mission of observation and inquiry ; for which she selected Captain Nicolas Arrington, a brave and intelligent officer of the garrison of Berwick, who had already been repeatedly employed in Scotland. His open instructions were to intercede with James for some favour to the Hamiltons ; his more secret orders, to acquaint himself with the character and intentions of D'Aubigny, the state of parties, and what projects were then agitated for the young King's marriage. On the first point, the pardon, or at least the more lenient punishment of the house of Hamilton, he pre vailed nothing, \u2014 so deep was James's hatred, or per haps more truly, that of Morton, against him. With regard to the marriage, Arrington informed Burghley, that neither the Council nor D'Aubigny had yet made any formal proposal upon the subject. \" It was"], [82, "58 1579. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. evident,\" he said, \" that the young French stranger had already won the affection of his royal kinsman, and might look for high preferment ;\" probably to be Earl of Lennox, with a large share of the forfeited lands of the Hamiltons, if he could be prevailed upon to change his religion.1 The old soldier who thus wrote to Burghley, re quested his indulgence, should his information prove incorrect, as he had been more familiar with \" an other weapon than the pen ;\" but the course of events soon proved the accuracy of his intelligence. Wher ever James went, he insisted on having D'Aubigny beside him. When he removed, for the purpose of holding his Parliament, from Stirling to Holyrood, his graceful cousin had splendid apartments provided for him in the palace, nearest to the royal bed chamber ; and in the sports and pageants with which the citizens received their monarch, the favourite, for so he was now declared, found himself universally regarded and courted. The expensive scale on which these civic festivities were conducted evinced a re markable increase in the national wealth. They exhibited the usual confusion of classical, feudal, and religious machinery ; in which \" Dame Musick,\" at tended by four fair virgins representing the cardinal virtues, and the Provost and three hundred citizens, clad in velvet and satin, enacted their parts with great assiduity and success.

Religion, a grave matron, then conducted him into the High Church ; and thence, after hearing sermon, the monarch and the congregation repaired to the Market Cross, where Bacchus sat on a gilded puncheon, with his painted garments and a flowery garland. The fountains ran wine ; the principal street of the city was hung with tapestry, and, at the conclusion of the procession, the town presented the King with a cupboard of plate, valued, says a minute historian, at six thousand merks.1 These pageants were introductory to the Parlia ment which assembled on the 20th of October, and, as had been anticipated by Arrington, was principally occupied with the proscription of the Hamiltons, and the exaltation of D'Aubigny. The Lord Arbroath and Lord Claud Hamilton, with many more of the same name and house, were proclaimed traitors, and their estates forfeited; whilst all who had been partakers in the slaughter of the two Regents, Murray and Lennox, were commanded, under pain of death, to remove six miles from Court. On the other hand, the King conferred the Earldom of Lennox upon his favourite, and presented him, at the same time, with the rich Abbacy of Arbroath. Not long after, the stream of royal favour flowed still more munificently. He was made Chamberlain for Scotland ; his earldom 1 Moyse's Memoirs, Bannat. Edit. p. 25. Also, MS. Calder wood, Brit.

When these fears were once excited, the churches resounded with warnings against the dark machinations of Popery ; and the pulpit, as had frequently happened in these times, became a political engine. It was recollected that the Duke of Guise had accompanied D'Aubigny to Dieppe, and remained with him for many hours in secret conference in the ship ; he had been known also to have had consultations with the Bishops of Glasgow 2 and Ross ; and for what purpose (so the ministers argued) could the forty thousand crowns, which he brought with him, be so naturally applied 1 MS.

Nay, was it not known that a part had already found its way into the coffers of the Lady Argyle ; and did not all men see the warm and sudden friendship between her husband the Earl, and the favourite? 1 Amid these suspicions and jealousies, the year 1579 passed away ; and it was apparent to all who regarded the state of the country with attention, that it could not long remain without some sudden change or convulsion. The King was wretchedly poor; and the revenues of the crown, during his minority, had been plundered and dilapidated to such an extent that he could not raise three thousand pounds to defray the expenses of his household. The nobility, on the other hand, were rich ; they had prospered as the crown had sunk ; and so determined were they to hold fast their gains, that they \" would spare nothing they possessed to the King's aid, without deadly feud.\" 2 It had been earnestly recommended, that the King's person, in those unsettled times, should be defended by a body-guard, and that six Privy-councillors, in rotation, should always remain with the Court : but no funds could be raised to pay the soldiers' wages; the Councillors refused to support a table for themselves; no money was forthcoming elsewhere ; and the King was frequently left almost alone, without court or council around him ; a state 1 MS.

When Elphinston, Abbot of Dunfermline, was sent to England, in the preceding summer,1 his main purpose was to explain to the Queen the poverty under which the young Prince had entered on his government ; the great insecurity of his person, surrounded as he daily was by men \" who had dipped their hands in the blood of his parents and dearest kinsfolks,\" and the absolute necessity for a supply of money to pay the expenses of his guards and household.2 But Elizabeth could not be induced to advance any supplies ; and these evils and dangers had ever since been on the increase. Since the arrival of Lennox, too, the feuds amongst the nobility had risen to an alarming height. Morton, jealous of the new favourite, and animated by a hatred of Argyle, absented himself from Court; the powerful Border septs of the Humes and Cars regarded the ex-Regent with the deadliest rancour ; Elphinston, the King's Secretary, a man of talent, and long his firm friend, was now estranged from him ; and even the potent Angus, his nephew, and his heir, kept at a safe distance, and watched events. But Morton's great wealth, his energy, courage, and experience, made him still a formidable enemy ; and they who most wished his downfall, knew not on what side to attack him. The young King, in the mean time, who 1 30th July, 1578. 2 MS. St. P. Office. Demands of the Abbot of Dunfermline. Ambassador from the King of Scots, 30th July, 1578. ."], [87, "1580. JAMES VI. 63 had always felt an awe for the late Regent, became daily more devoted to Lennox, whom, with a boyish enthusiasm, and a precocious display of theology, he was now labouring to convert from what he esteemed his religious errors. He gave him books of con troversy, brought him to attend the sermons of the ministers, procured one of the mildest and most learned of their number to instruct him, and so far succeeded, that, if not converted, he was reported to be favourably inclined to the Protestant Church. Any sudden recantation would have been suspicious; and, meanwhile, his royal and youthful mentor con gratulated himself upon his favourite's hopeful and inquiring state.1 Amid these cares and controversies, a sudden rumour arose, none could tell from what quarter, that the Earl of Morton had plotted to seize the King, and carry him to Dalkeith. How this was to be effected, no one could tell ; but James, who had ridden out on a hunting expedition, precipitately interdicted the sports, and galloped back to Stirling Castle. Morton loudly declared his innocence, and defied his calumniators to bring their proofs ; yet scarcely had this challenge been given, when the Court was again thrown into terror and confusion, by news secretly brought to the Earl of Mar, that Lennox and his faction had fixed on the night of the 10th April to invade the royal apartments, lay hands on the King, hurry him to Dumbarton, and thence 1 MS.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. transport him to France.1 It was whispered, also, that a deep confederacy had been formed against the Earl of Morton, by the same junto : that Sir James Balfour, now a fugitive in France, and one who was well-known to have been a chief accomplice in the murder of the King's father, had promised to purchase his pardon, by giving up the bond for the murder, signed by Morton's own hand ; and that thus there was every hope of bringing the hoary and blood stained tyrant to the scaffold, which had so long waited for him. In the midst of these ominous rumours, the night of the 1 Oth April arrived, and all in the castle pre pared for an attack. Mar permitted none to see the King ; soldiers were stationed within and without the royal chamber ; and a shout arising, that Lennox ought to be thrust out of the gates, he shut himself up in his apartments, with a strong guard of his friends, armed at all points, and swore that he would set upon any that dared invade him. In the morning, Argyle, Sutherland, Glencairn, and other adherents of Lennox, hurried to Stirling; but were refused admittance to the castle ; and their fears for Lennox increased, when they heard it reported, that Morton was on the road to join his party. All was thus in terror and uncertainty : men gazed, trembled, and whispered fearfully amongst each other, aware that secret plots were busily concocting ; that the ground they stood on was being mined : and yet none could 1 MS.

At this moment, Captain Ar rington, Elizabeth's envoy, was in Stirling Castle, and thus wrote to Burghley : \" The young King is in heavy case, and much amazed with these troubles, and the more by reason of his great affection towards D'Aubigny, whom he perceives the mark they shoot at.

D'Aubigny, with his faction, doth offer to abide the trial by law, or otherwise, in their very persons, that there was never any such plot or mean ing by him, or his consent, or by any others to their knowledge, to have drawn the King either to Dum barton or any other sinister course.\" x It is difficult to arrive at the truth amidst these conflicting accusations of the two factions. Elizabeth certainly had received a warning from her Ambassador in France, that there was a design on foot to have the young King brought thither; and Morton had probably been encouraged by the English Queen to prevent it by every possible means.2 Lennox, on the other hand, although he indignantly, and probably truly, repelled any such treasonable intentions, avowed his wish to reform the Council, and protect the King from the pillage of the blood-suckers of the royal revenue, who had been thrust into their offices 1 MS.

In this project, James himself appears to have borne a part ; and had probably in tended, under pretence of a hunting party at the Doune of Menteith, to have escaped from the tutelage of Mar, and accomplished a revolution in the Court.1 The secret project, however, was discovered, and defeated by the vigilance of the house of Erskine. In the mean time, the picture drawn by Arrington, of the dangerous state of the country, threw Elizabeth into alarm, and she immediately despatched Sir Robert Bowes to Stirling. His instructions were to strengthen, by every means, the decaying influence of Morton, \u2014 to declare the Queen's willingness to gain some of the chief in authority by pensions, \u2014 to pull down the power of Lennox, \u2014 to plead for the pardon of the Hamiltons, and thoroughly to sift the truth of the late rumours of a conspiracy for carrying off the young King. Bowes also, before he set out, received a letter from Secretary Walsingham, recommending him to use the utmost vigilance in this mission. This, he said, was most necessary, as it was already reported in Spain, that mass was set up once more in Scotland, and arms taken against the Protestants; and, as he knew for certain, that Ker of Fernyhirst, a Roman Catholic, and an active friend of the Scottish Queen, with Bothwellhaugh, the blood-stained Ha milton who had shot the Regent Murray, had both recently ridden post from France into Spain.2 1 Brit.

On reaching court, the Ambassador was received, by the young King, with great courtesy : but his man ner instantly changed when any allusion was made to the Hamiltons; and it was evident to all that his exertions on this head would ,be unavailing.1 It was apparent, also, that the revival of Morton's former power promised to be a matter of extreme difficulty. He himself was so completely convinced of the strength of his enemies, and the deep estrangement of the King, that he had resolved to retire altogether from public affairs. In a secret conference held, in the night, Avith Bowes at Stirling Castle, he expressed much doubt whether it was not too late to attempt anything against Lennox, who now professed himself a Protestant, and had so completely conciliated the ministers of the Kirk, that they addressed a letter in his commendation to the Couneil.2 As to the late rumoured conspiracies for carrying off the King, the Ambassador found it difficult to dis cover the truth : but he was witness to a strange scene of violence and brawling before the Council, in which Morton, Mar, and Lennox gave the lie to their ac cusers, and the King, with much feeling and good sense, exerted himself to restore peace : a striking contrast, no doubt, to Bowes' experience of the de corous gravity and awe preserved by Elizabeth in her Council, in which the highest nobles generally spoke 1 MS.

On the subject of the alleged plot of Lennox, James was at first reserved, al though he expressed much love and admiration for Elizabeth; but the Ambassador, at last, gained his confidence, and drew from him many particulars, which showed that the conspiracy, intended to have been carried into effect at Castle Doune, involved the ruin of Morton, \u2014 the dismissal of Mar, and other obnoxious councillors, and a complete reconstruction of the government under Lennox and Argyle. As it appeared, also, that Sir John Seton, Sir George Douglas, and some of the captive Queen's most attached servants were to have been brought into the Council, Bowes at once suspected that the design originated in France, aud that Lennox and his youth ful sovereign acted under the influence of the Guises. He was the more persuaded of this, when Morton assured him that, since D'Aubigny's arrival, the King's feelings had undergone a great change in favour of that country. But the time called for action, not for speculation ; and, on consulting with his friends, regarding the most likely means of averting the dangers threatened by this alarming state of things, there were many conflicting opinions. It was recommended to have tried councillors about the King, and a strong body guard to prevent surprise ; as it had been remarked, that the late alarms and plots had all broken out when there was scarce a single councillor at court who could be depended upon. Yet this could not be"], [93, "1580. 69 JAMES VI. done without money; and where was money to be had in the present exhausted state of the royal revenue V Soon after this, the Ambassador took an opportunity of seeing the young King alone, and delivering a secret message from Elizabeth, upon a subject of the deepest interest to both : his succession to the Eng lish crown after' her death. The particulars of the interview, and the answer given by James, were communicated in cipher, in a letter of which the ad dress is now lost, but which was addressed probably to Burghley or Walsingham, \u2014 his usual correspon dents when the subject was of high moment. \" In private with the King (so wrote the Ambassador) I have offered to acquaint him with a secret greatly importing him and his estate, and lately discovered to me by letters, which were not out of the way, in case he should desire sight thereof ; and, taking his honour in pledge for the secrecy, which he readily tendered, I opened to him, at large, all the contents specified in the cipher note last sent to me, and to be communicated to him, persuading him earnestly to beware that he made not himself the cause of greater loss to him, than France, Scotland, or Lennox could countervail. He appeared here to be very much per plexed ; affirming that he would both most chiefly fol low her Majesty's advice, and also ask and require her counsel in all his great adoes. * * * In which good resolution and mind (continued Bowes) I 1 MS.

But Lennox having won great interest in him, and possessing free and sur,e access to him at all times, * * I dare not, therefore, assure, in his tender years, any long con tinuance or sure performance of this promise.\"1 These anticipations of James's fickleness proved to be well founded ; for neither the prize held out by Elizabeth, nor all the efforts of Bowes could retain the Monarch in his good resolutions. The influence of Lennox and his friends became daily more pre dominant ; his youthful master's arguments on the errors of the Church of Rome, seconded by the expo sitions of the Presbyterian clergy, had, as he affirmed, convinced him; he had publicly avowed his conversion to Protestantism, and had signed the articles of Religion drawn up by the Scottish clergy. His enemies were thus deprived of their principal ground of complaint and alarm ; and, although they accused him of insincerity, \u2014 and certainly the circumstances under which this recantation was made, were sus picious, \u2014 still, as he. afterwards died professing him self a Protestant, we have every reason to believe his assertions to have been sincere.2 But whether at this moment sincere or interested, Lennox's conversion, and consequent increase of power, placed Morton, and the other old friends of 1 MS.

Had they been assured of immediate support, they were ready, they said, to resist the intrigues of France, which became every day more successful, \u2014 the Bishops of Ross and Glasgow keeping up a correspondence with Lennox. But Elizabeth, as Walsingham confessed to Bowes, was so completely occupied and entangled with the negotiations for her marriage with the Duke of Anjou, that every other subject was postponed. No answer, which promised any certain assistance, arrived ; and Morton, wearied out and irritated with this neglect, declared to the Ambassador, that he would be constrained to provide for his personal safety by a reconciliation with Lennox. \" He utterly dis trusted,\" he said, \" Elizabeth's intention to be at any charges for the affairs of Scotland ; his own peril was great and imminent ; yet, had he been backed by England, he would have adventured to beard his enemies, and to have retained the country at the de votion of the Queen.

For some time after this, Elizabeth's policy towards Scotland was of that vacillating and contradictory kind which estranged her friends, and gave confidence to her opponents. She had been early warned by Sir Robert Bowes, then resident at Berwick, of the great strength of the confederacy at the head of which Lennox had placed himself, and that soon no efforts would avail against it.1 \" Such had been,\" he said, \" the success of the French intrigues, that Scotland was running headlong the French course ;\"2 and that everything tended to the overthrow of religion, \u2014 by which we must understand him as meaning the Pres- 1 MS.

She alternately flattered, remonstrated, and threatened ; but she resolutely refused to \" go to any charges ;\" and the effects of her indecision and neglect were soon apparent.1 Lennox grew daily more formidable. As he was supported by the favour of the King, and the coun tenance and money of France, he drew into his party the most powerful of the nobility. His possessions and landed property were already great. Favour after favour was bestowed. Himself, or his friends and retainers, held some of the strongest castles in Scotland ; and not long after this, Walsingham, who was anxiously watching his power, heard, with dis may, from Bowes, that Dumbarton, one of the most important keys of the kingdom, was to be delivered to the favourite.2 This last determination incensed Elizabeth to the highest pitch. She had for some time been engaged in a secret correspondence with the captain of the castle, the noted Cunningham of Drumquhassel, who had promised to retain it at her devotion ; and on the 1 MS.

The imperious and unscrupulous temper of the Queen was strongly marked in his instructions. If he found the fortress (for so its great strength entitled it to be called) undelivered, he was to remonstrate loudly against its being surrendered to one who, whatever mask the Pope allowed him to wear, was in his heart an enemy to the Gospel. If it was too late, and the castle already given up, he was instantly to confer with Morton how so fatal a step could be remedied : \" Either (to quote the words of the instructions) by laying violent hands on the Duke and his principal associates, in case no other more temperate course can be found, or by some other way that by him might be thought meet.\"1 Bowes hurried on to Edinburgh ; met with Mor ton, whom he found still bold, and ready to engage in any attack upon his rival ; and had already given him \" some comfort to prick him on\" \u2014 meaning, no doubt, an advance in money, when new letters arrived from the Queen. A single day had revived her par simony, and cooled her resentment : it would be better, she thought, to try persuasion first, and forbear ad vising force, or any promise of assistance.

His farewell interview was a stormy one. \" His royal mistress,\" he said, \" was bitterly mortified to find that this was all the return for her care of James ever since his cradle. She had little expected to be treated with contempt, and to see promoted to credit and honour the very man against whom she had expressed so much suspicion and dislike ; but hereafter, he might find what it was to prefer a Duke of Lennox before a Queen of England.\"3 This retirement of Bowes greatly strengthened D'Aubigny.

This was the destruction of Morton, the bitterest enemy of the Scottish Queen, and whose recent intrigues with the English Ambassador had shown that, although his power was diminished, his will to work their ruin was as active as before. Their plot against him, which had been in preparation for some time, was now ripe for execution, and it was determined to arraign him as guilty of the murder of Darnley. That he had been an active agent in the conspiracy against that unhappy Prince, was certain ; and that Archibald Douglas, another powerful member of the house of Douglas, had been personally present at the murder was well known : but this could be said of others who had escaped prosecution ; and as to Morton, although shorn of much of his power and lustre, he was still so dreaded that no one, for many years, had dared to whisper an accusation against him. The arrival of Lennox, however, had changed the scene ; and this new favourite of his Sovereign was now risen to such a height of power, that, find ing the late Regent intriguing with Elizabeth against him, he determined to pull down and destroy his enemy at once. For this purpose many things then assisted. Mor ton had quarrelled with the Kirk, and lost the confi dence of its ministers ; he was hated by the people for his avarice and severe exactions durino- his"], [101, "1580. 77 JAMES VI. regency ; and his steady adherence to England had made him odious to the friends of the imprisoned Queen, and the party of France. Lennox, therefore, had every hope of success ; and to effect his purpose, he employed a man well calculated to cope with such an antagonist. This was James Stewart, Captain of the Royal Guard, and second son of Lord Ochiltree, who had already risen into great favour with the King, and was afterwards destined to act a noted part in the history of the country. Stewart had re ceived a learned education ; and from the principles of his father, and his near connexion with Knox, who had married his sister, was probably destined for the Church. But his daring and ambitious char acter threw him into active life : he embraced the profession of arms, served as a soldier of fortune in the wars of France and Sweden, visited Russia, and afterwards returned to his own country, where he soon won the confidence of the young King and the Duke of Lennox, by his noble presence and elegant accomplishments. Beneath these lighter attractions, however, he concealed a mind utterly reckless and licentious in its principles, confident and courageous to excess, intolerant of the opinions of other men, and unscrupulous as to the means he adopted to raise himself into power. To this man, then only beginning to develop these qualities, was committed the bold task of arraigning Morton ; and to obtain complete proof of his guilt, it was arranged that Sir James Balfour, who was believed to have in his possession the bond for Darn-"], [102, "78 1580. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ley's murder, and who was himself a principal assassin, should come secretly from France, and exhibit this paper with Morton's signature attached to it. In this last scene of his life, the ex- Regent exhibited the hereditary pride and courage of the house of Dou glas. He had been warned of the danger he incurred, and the storm which was about to burst over his head, two days before, when hunting with the King. But he derided it ; and on the last of December, the day on which he fell into the toils, took his place, as usual, at the Council table, where the King presided. After some unimportant business, the usher suddenly entered and declared that Captain James Stewart was at the door, and earnestly craved an audience. The request was immediately granted ; and Stewart advancing to the table, fell on his knees, and instantly accused Morton of the King's murder. \" My duty to your Highness,\" said he, addressing the King, \" has brought me here to reveal a wickedness that has been too long obscured. It was that man (pointing to the Earl) now sitting at this table, a place he is unworthy to occupy, that conspired your royal father's death. Let him be committed for trial, and I shall make good my words.\"1 Amidst the amazement and confusion occasioned by this sudden and bold impeachment, the only per son unmoved was Morton himself. Rising from his seat, he cast a momentary and disdainful glance upon 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off.

The rigour with which I have prosecuted all suspected of that murder is well known ; and when I have cleared myself, it will be for your Majesty to determine what they deserve who have sent this perjured tool of theirs to accuse me !\" These bitter terms Stewart threw back upon the Earl with equal contempt and acrimony. \" It is false, utterly false,\" he replied, \" that any one has instiga ted me to make this accusation. A horror for the crime, and zeal for the safety of my Sovereign, have been my only counsellors ; and as to his pretended zeal against the guilty, let me ask him, where has he placed Archibald Douglas his cousin ? That most infamous of men, who was an actor in the tragedy, is now a Senator, promoted to the highest seat of justice, and suffered to pollute that tribunal before which he ought to have been arraigned as the mur derer of his Prince.\" x This scene had begun calmly; but as these last words were uttered, Stewart had sprung upon his feet, and Morton laid his hand upon his sword, when Lords Lindsay and Cathcart threw themselves be tween them, and prevented a personal encounter.2 The King then commanded both to be removed ; and, 1 Spottiswood, p. 310. 2 Harleian, 6999, sols. 3, 4, 5.

Even there, however, he was not deemed secure from a rescue ; and his enemies wrere not contented till they had lodged him within the strong fortress of Dumbarton, of which Lennox, his great enemy, was governor.1 On the same day that the ex-Regent was com mitted, the Council ordered his cousin, Archibald Douglas, to be seized ; and Hume of Manderston, with a party of horse, rode furiously all night to his castle of Morham : but Douglas had escaped, a few hours before, across the English Border, having re ceived warning from his friend the Laird of Long Niddry, who rode two horses to death in bringing him the news.2 Lennox and his faction, however, had made sure of their principal victim ; and all was now headlong haste to hurry on his trial, and have the tragedy completed, before any interruption could be made, or any succour arrive. Yet this was not easily accomplished. The story of his seizure had effectually roused Elizabeth. Randolph was de spatched on the spur of the moment, to cany a vio lent remonstrance to the King ; and Lord Hunsdon, 1 Calderwood, MS. Hist. Brit. Mus. Ayscough, sub anno 1581, sol. 1115. Also, MS.

Matters were there in so violent a state, and the English alliance so un- popular, that he dreaded assassination ; and prayed Walsingham, who had addressed him as an envoy, to vouchsafe him the name of an ambassador, if it were merely for protection, and to save him from personal violence.3 On sounding the dispositions of the leading men, they appeared coldly affected. The Earl of Angus, indeed, Morton's nearest kinsman, was ready to peril all in the effort to save him ; but he stood alone. The rest of the nobles were either banded with Lennox, or held themselves aloof, till Hunsdon's soldiers should be seen crossing, and not threatening to cross the Border, and till Randolph had begun to pay them in better coin than promises. They had been so often deceived by the artful diplo- macy of the English Queen; she had already so fre- quently incited them to take arms, under a promise of assistance, and left them, when it was too late to retreat ; that they were full of distrust and suspicion.

James had been irritated on Randolph's first arrival, by his refusal to have any intercourse with Jhis favourite Lennox -,1 and when the envoy attempted to justify himself, and offered to prove, by the production of an intercepted letter, that he was an agent of Rome and the house of Guise, and carried on a secret intelligence with the enemies of both kingdoms, the monarch answered with much spirit, that Lennox was an honourable nobleman, his own near kinsman, and that the accu sation was perfectly false. He had come from mo tives of affection to visit him ; and as for the inter cepted letter he spoke of, from the Bishop of Glasgow to the Pope, if any such existed, it was either a forgery, or a design of that prelate for Lennox's ruin. \" The Bishop's character,\" said James, \" is well known ; he is my declared traitor and rebel ; a favourer and kinsman of the Hamiltons, the mortal foes of the house of Lennox ; and no one wTould be more likely than Beaton to think his labour well bestowed, if, by his letters and intrigues, he might cause me to suspect and discard my kinsman, who has embraced the true religion, and is zealous for my honour and interest.

Elizabeth, indeed, had at first talked proudly and authoritatively of her determination to save him ; and her ministers and soldiers borrowed her tone. Walsingham declared to Randolph, that if a hair of Morton's head were touched, it would cost the Queen of Scots her life.2 Hunsdon addressed to the same Ambassador a blus- tering epistle, anticipating his speedy invasion of Scotland, and full of threats against the \" petty fel lows\" who were about the King of Scots.3 Leicester, whose opinion ought to have had still greater weight, expressed himself in ominous and warning words : alluding to the dreadful fate of Darnley, \" Let that young King take heed,\" said he. \" If he prove unthankful to his faithful servants so soon, he cannot long tarry in that soil.

Lennox were permitted to triumph, and Morton to fall, the quarrel would be no longer about the trifles of the Borders, but the right to the crown; in which Scotland would be assisted by France and Spain, and fortified by a large party within England.1 And the wise Burghley, in his \" Directions\" to Randolph, urged the necessity of immediate action to save Scot land from the domination of a concealed Papist \u2014 so he described Lennox \u2014 who, whatever he might pretend to the contrary, had been permitted by the Court of Rome to dissemble his religion.2 But this energy was short-lived, and spent itself in words. Hunsdon, after all his threats, protracted his levies ; not an English soldier crossed the Border ; and no decided support or supplies of money could be extracted from the caution and parsimony of the English Queen ; whilst on the part of Lennox and his adherents, all was vigour and warlike prepara tion. The whole force of the realm was summoned to be in readiness to resist the English army. Bands of \" waged soldiers \" \u2014 so termed to distinguish them from the feudal militia of the country, who served without pay \u2014 were enlisted, and added to the ordi nary guard about the King's person ; and the three Estates assembled to vote supplies for the exigencies of the expected wTar with England. Before this Parliament Randolph appeared and 1 MS. St. P. Off. Bowes to Leicester, 14th March, 1580-1, BerM'ick. 2 MS. St. P. Off.

He spoke for two hours : insisted with much earnestness on the benefits to be derived from the friendship of his royal mistress ; described, in glowing terms, the dan gers to be apprehended from Lennox, whom he de nounced as an agent of France and Rome ; and pro duced an intercepted letter from the Bishop of Ross; to prove his allegations. All these exertions, how ever, came too late, and were utterly unsuccessful. Lennox denied the charge, and demanded the fullest investigation. The Parliament promised forty thou sand pounds to support the preparations against England ; daily rumours of war, and whisperings of the intrigues and conspiracies which were fomented by the English diplomatist, agitated and inflamed the country ; and at last, as Randolph himself described it, \" Every day bred a new disorder ; men began to be stirring in all parts ; the Ambassador grew odious, his death suspected, and the Court in a manner desperate.\"1 These suspicions of conspiracies were not without foundation ; for, from the moment of his arrival, Randolph had kept in his eye the third article in his instructions, which was, to raise a faction against Lennox, and employ force, either in seizing his per son, or putting him to death in some open attack, if more conciliatory measures failed.2 It was hoped 1 MS.

The great advocates for this plan were Sir Robert Bowes, Lord Hunsdon, Lord Huntingdon, and the Earl of Angus ; but they differed somewhat as to the best mode of proceeding. Bowes seemed to have the least scruples as to employing force, for the sepa rating: James from his favourite. In a letter to Walsingham or Burghley,1 written shortly after Ran dolph's arrival, he informed his correspondent, that the Scottish nobles were drawing to an association ; and that, amid the pageants with which the King and Lennox were then recreating the Court, \" a strange masque might be, perhaps, seen at Holyrood,\" which would check the triumph of the favourite. Hunsdon, whose fiery temper on no occasion brooked much delay, recommended martial measures ; and assured the English secretary, that Lennox must look for his dismissal to France, or to \" something worse.\"2 Huntingdon, a nobleman of the highest honour in these dark times, \" assured Randolph, that any attempt to restore English ascendancy by nego tiation would be fruitless ; that open war must be deprecated ; and that to get out of their difficulties 1 The address is lost.

Why may not some of the nobility, assisted by England, say to the King, \u2014 ' Your Grace is young ; you cannot judge for yourself, and must be rescued from this French stranger, who abuses your confidence ;' and then,\" he added, \" if Lennox resisted and took arms, let them unarm him if they can, and let our royal mistress assist them.\"1 Amidst these various and conflicting opinions, Ran dolph laboured busily, and with the ardour of a man in his native element ; so that at last a band or asso ciation was \"packed up,\" to use the common phrase of the times, amongst the nobles ; and Bowes informed Leicester of the intentions of the conspirators, in a letter which shows, when taken in connexion with a communication addressed the day after by Walsing ham to Lord Hunsdon, that the design of the nobles wras to seize the person of the King, and secure, or perhaps murder, Lennox. \" Albeit,\" said Bowes, \" the levy of the forces newly assembled in Edin burgh and elsewhere, and the planting them about the King, to guard his person against suspected surprise or violence, doth greatly threaten the stay or defeat of the purposes intended, whereof I know your Lordship is advertised ; yet I am in good hope, that, if any opportunity be found, the parties asso- 1 MS.

The conspirators thus encouraged, completed their arrangements. They succeeded in corrupting some of the royal household ; by their connivance, forged keys for the King's private apartments were made ; and they thus hoped to enter the palace, seize the young monarch, put Lennox, Argyle, and Montrose to death, and send James to England.2 But Lennox, when on the very point of being cut off, was saved by an unexpected discovery ; and Morton, when his prison began to be cheered by the near prospect of escape, found himself more hopelessly situated than before. The chief actors in the association for his rescue were the Earls of Angus and Mar. With Angus, Randolph had arranged all in nightly meet ings, held sometimes in the fields, sometimes at Dal- 1 MS.

Lord Hunsdon, who had a high ad miration of Angus, was, as we have seen, deeply implicated : his forces were in readiness to advance from Berwick into Scotland, and he only waited for the signal which was to be the news of the King's seizure ; when Lennox, receiving some hint which awakened his suspicion, seized Douglas of Whitting ham, threatened him with the rack, and obtained a revelation of the wdiole. Morton's servants, Fleck, Nesbit, Reid, and Jerdan, were instantly arrested aud put to the torture. Angus was banished beyond Spey ; Randolph, whose intrigues were laid bare, fled precipitately to Berwick, after having been nearly slain by a shot fired into his study ; 1 and Elizabeth, disgusted by the treachery of Whittingham, and the utter failure of the plot against Lennox, commanded Hunsdon to dismiss his forces, recalled Randolph, and abandoned Morton to his fate. This, it was now evident, could not be long averted. His enemies were powerful and clamorous against him. Captain James StewTart, the accuser of the ex- 1 MS. St. P. Off.

One by one the various Earls and Barons, whose assistance had been bought by Elizabeth, dropped off, and made their peace with the stronger party ;3 till at last Morton was left alone, and nothing remained to be done but to sacri fice the victim. For this purpose, Stewart, his accuser, and Mon trose, were commissioned to bring him from Dum barton to the capital. In those dark days many prophetic warnings hung over ancient houses ; and among the rest, was one which predicted that the bloody heart, the emblem of the house of Douglas, would fall by Arran. This saying Morton affected to despise ; for the Earl of Arran was dead, and the Hamiltons, his enemies, in whose family this title was hereditary, were now banished and broken men. But Stewart, his implacable foe, had recently pro cured from the King the gift of the vacant earldom. 1 MS. St. P. Off. 1 1 th Jan., 1 5S0-1 , Bowes to Lord Burghley and Sir Fr. Walsingham. 2 MS.

During his long imprisonment, he had expressed contrition for his sinful courses ; deplored the many crimes into which ambition and the insatiable love of power had plunged him ; and sought for rest in the consolations of religion, and the constant study of the Holy Scriptures. At the same time, his preparations for the worst had not prevented him from taking as active a part against his enemies as his captivity would allow. He was brought to trial on the first of June, five months after his arrest ; and such was still either the lingering dread of his power, or the terror of some attempt at rescue, that the whole town was in arms. Two companies of soldiers were placed at the Cross, two bands above the Tolbooth ; whilst the citizens armed also, and with another body of troops filled the principal street, for the purpose of conducting him from his lodging to the Tolbooth, where the trial took place.

On this point, absolute and direct proof might not have been easily procured ; for it turned out that Sir James Balfour either did not possess, or would not produce, the bond for Darnley's murder. But Morton's own defence supplied this defect ; for although he denied that he had ever procured, or given his consent to the -death of Darnley, he distinctly admitted that he knew the murder was to be com mitted, and had concealed it ; upon which confession the Jury found him guilty. The terms in which their sentence was embodied were the same as those still employed in Scotland. It declared him \"convicted of counsel, concealing, and being art and part of the King's murder.\" And upon hearing these last words read aloud, the Earl, who had maintained the greatest calmness and tem per during the trial, became deeply agitated. \" Art and part !\" said he, with great vehemence, and strik ing the table repeatedly with a little baton or staff which he usually carried. \" Art and part !

Yet all may have been, nay, let us hope all was sin cere ; and whilst it is vain to speculate upon a state of mind known only to Him who sees the heart, allowance must be made for the character of an age familiar with blood ; for the peculiar, and almost ultra-Calvinistic, theology of the divines who ministered to him in his last moments; and the possibility of inaccuracy in the narrative itself, 1 Bannatyne's Memorials, Bannatyne Club Edition, p. 317."], [118, "1581. 94 HIST0RY.0F SCOTLAND. which was not read over to him before his death. In speaking of the assassination of the King, he dis tinctly repeated his admissions made at the trial; affirming that he, in common with many others, knew that Darnley was to be cut off, but did not dare to forewarn him ; and adding, that the Queen was the contriver of the whole plot. These conferences took place on the day in which he suffered ; and his friends amongst the clergy had scarcely left him, when his keeper entered his room, and desired him to come forth to the scaffold. He appeared surprised, and observed, that having been so much troubled that day with worldly matters, he had hoped that one night at least would have been allowed him to have advised ripely with his God. \" But, my Lord,\" said the keeper, \" they will not wait, and all things are ready.\" \" If it be so,\" answered he, \" I praise God I am ready also ;\" and, after a short prayer, he passed down to the gate of the palace to go to the scaffold. Here another in terruption took place ; for Arran, his mortal enemy, was waiting on the steps, and requested him to tarry till his confession, which had been made to the min isters, had been written down, and brought to him for his signature. But this reimmersion into worldly affairs he entreated to be spared. \" Bethink you, my Lord,\" said he, \" that I have far other things now to advise upon. I am about to die : I must prepare for my God. Ask me not to write now; all these good men (pointing to the ministers) can testify what I have spoken in that matter.\" With"], [119, "1581. 95 JAMES VI. this Arran professed himself satisfied ; but his im portunity was not at an end ; for he added that Mor ton must be reconciled to him' before he proceeded farther. To this the Earl willingly agreed ; observ ing, that now was no time to reckon quarrels, and that he forgave him and all, as he himself hoped for forgiveness. He then proceeded to the scaffold, which he ascended with a firm step ; and turning to the people, repeated, shortly, his confession of the foreknowledge of the King's murder, only suppress ing the name of his near relative, Mr Archibald Dou glas. He declared that he died in the profession of the gospel as it was at that day taught and established in Scotland ; and exhorted the people, if they hoped for the favour of Heaven, to hold fast the same. Mr James Lawson; one of the ministers, then prayed aloud ; and, during this act of devotion, Morton, who had thrown himself, with his face on the ground, be fore the block on which he was to suffer, was observed to be deeply affected. In his agitation, his whole frame was convulsed with sighs and sobs bursting from his bosom ; and his body rebounded from the earth on which he lay along. On rising up, however, his face was calm and cheerful ; he shook his friends by the hand, bidding them farewell with many ex pressions of kindness ; and having declined to have his hands bound, knelt down, and laid his neck upon the block. At this awful moment, Mr James Law son, stooping forward to his ear, read some verses from the Scripture, which Morton repeated with a firm voice. As he pronounced the wTords, \" Lord"], [120, "1581. 96 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Jesus, receive my spirit!\" the axe descended, and the imperfect sentence died upon the lips, which quivered and were silent for ever.1 The execution took place about four o'clock on the evening of Friday the 2d of June. It was remarked that Fernyhirst, who was known to have been acquainted with the murder of the King, stood in a window opposite the scaffold. He was recognised by a conspicuous feature in his dress \u2014 his large ruffles ; and seemed to take delight in the spectacle. The people also remarked that Lord Seton and his two sons had taken great care to secure a good view of all that passed, by pulling down a stair which would have intercepted their view of the scaffold.2 On the day after Morton suffered, George Binning, a servant of Archibald Douglas, was executed for his participation in the murder of the King. The con fession of this accomplice threw some additional light on this dark story. He affirmed, that his master, Archibald Douglas, who was then an ad herent of the Earl of Bothwell, was present at the deed, and, in his haste to leave the spot, lost one of his slippers ; that, when his master came home, his clothes were full of clay and soil, occasioned, no doubt, by the explosion ; and that, in retreating from the scene of the murder, he (Binning) encountered. 1 MS.

This necessarily led to the revival of the influence of France, and to renewed intrigues by the friends of the Catholic faith, and the supporters of the imprisoned Queen. The prospects of the Protestant lords, and of the more zealous ministers of the Kirk, were proportionably overclouded ; the faction in the interest of England was thrown into despair ; and reports of the most gloomy kind began to circulate through the country. It was said that religion was on the point of being altered ; that the King would marry a Princess of the house of Lorrain ; that the Duke of Guise had already written to him in the most friendly terms. and now for the first time had condescended to call him King.2 The conduct of Lennox was calculated to confirm rather than mitigate these suspicions. He professed, indeed, an earnest desire to maintain amicable relations with England ; and had written to this effect to the Earl of Leicester, warning him 'MS. Calderwood, Brit.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. against Archibald Douglas, who was now in Eng land, and laboured to embroil the two kingdoms.1 But he had forgotten entirely his friendly professions to the Presbyterians. The ministers of the Kirk, who had congratulated themselves as the instruments of his conversion, were treated with coldness ; and it was soon discovered that he had warmly espoused the King's opinions wTith regard to Episcopacy, and was ready to second, to his utmost ability, the efforts of the monarch for its complete establishment in his dominions. Meanwhile, the new Earl of Arran was not ne glectful of his interests, and advanced rapidly in power and presumption. Soon after the execution of Morton, he appeared before the Privy-council, entered into a detail of his proceedings against that nobleman, la mented the necessity he had been under of employing torture to procure evidence, and demanded and ob tained an Act of approval from the King, which characterized his whole conduct as honourable, and assured him, that at no future period should it be called in question.2 His next step was an act of such open profligacy, as to incense and scandalize the whole country. He lived in habits of familiar friendship with the Earl of March, and had been under deep obligations to him ; but he employed the opportuni ties such intimacy gave him to seduce the affections of the Countess of March, a woman of great beauty; 1 MS. St. P. Off. Lennox to Leicester, 7th Oct., 1581, LitEgow. s Orig. Record of Privy-council in the Register-House, Edin., 3d June, 1581."], [123, "1581. 99 JAMES VI. and so completely succeeded in depraving her mind, that she brought an action of divorce against her husband, on a ground which none but the most aban doned could plead. The suit was successful, the decree of divorce pronounced ; and Arran married the Countess, whose situation at that moment pro claimed her either a liar or an adultress. It affords a shocking picture of the manners of the times, that the young King appears to have countenanced this proceeding. Nor was this all. James determined to grant new honours to those who had assisted him in the overthrow of Morton : Lennox was made a Duke; Captain Stewart, who had already received a gift of the Earldom of Arran, was invested in that dignity with great solemnity ; the Earl of March received the Earldom of Orkney ; Lord Ruthven that of Gowrie ; and Lord Maxwell, one of the most power ful nobles of that time, became Earl of Morton. Parliament now assembled, and the sanction of this supreme Court was given to all those measures lately passed in favour of Lennox and Arran. Indeed, it could scarcely be expected that any would dare to oppose them ; for James had sent intimation to the Earls of Mar, Eglinton, Gleneairn, with the Lords Lindsay, Boyd, Herries, and Ochiltree, that he would dispense with their presence on this occasion j1 and none, probably, attended but those who were favour able to the Court. The adherents of the late Earl of Morton were pronounced rebels, and their estates confiscated. Amongst these, the principal Avere the 1 MS. St. P. Off.

Earl of Angus; Archibald Douglas of Whittingham; James Douglas, Prior of Pluscardine, and James Douglas of Pittendreich, two natural sons of the Regent Morton ; Douglas of Parkhead ; and Archi bald Douglas, Constable of the Castle of Edinburgh. In the same Parliament, Lennox, who believed his influence now to be all powerful, exerted himself to procure the pardon of Sir James Balfour, who had recently done him good service in the overthrow of Morton. But he was disappointed ; for James re fused his request, and pointed to those Acts of Par liament by which it was declared, that no person guilty of the King his father's murder, should ever be restored.1 At the same meeting of the Estates, the statutes were confirmed which protected the reformed religion ; some enactments introduced for the regulation of the coinage, against the exportation of wool, and that excess of apparel amongst the middle and lower classes, and expensive and super fluous banquets, which marked the progress of the -country in wealth and refinement, and had excited the jealousy of the higher nobility. It is now necessary to turn for a moment to the .Scottish Queen in her imprisonment. It was a miserable circumstance in the fate of this unfortunate I'rincess, that any successes of her friends generally brought along with them an increase of rigour and jealousy upon the part of her inexorable rival. This increase, on the other hand, as surely led to more 1 MS. St. P. Off. B.C., Thomas Sclby to Mr Tl omas Foster, \u2022i!Hh Nov., 1581."], [125, "1581. 101 JAMES VI. determined efforts for her delivery ; and thus, during the thirteen years for which she had now continued a captive, her health had been shattered, and her spirits broken, by those alternations of hope and fear, \u2014 those fluctuations of ardent expectation, or bitter disappointment, which must have destroyed even the healthiest and most buoyant constitution. Her condition about this time was so feeble, that she had lost the use of her limbs, and was carried in a chair, or litter, by her servants. She besought Eliza beth, in pathetic terms, for the favour of a coach, that she might enjoy a drive in the park of Sheffield Castle, where she was confined ; she requested the additional attendance of two female servants and two men servants, which her sickness demanded ; and she en treated to have passports for the Lady Lethingtoir and Lord Seton, in whose society she might find some alleviation of her solitude. But, although Castelnaii,\" the French Ambassador, seconded these requests by the most earnest remonstrance, the Eng lish Queen wTas deaf to his entreaties, and resisted the application.1 This cold and unrelenting conduct could not fail to make a deep impression upon Mary ; and, in a mo ment of resentment and excitation, she had deter mined to resign her rights as Queen of Scots, and her claims upon the Crown of England, into the hands of her son, with an earnest hope, that he would invade that realm, and, assisted by the Roman Catholic 1 Addition aux Mem. de Castelnan, p. 519. Chalmers' Life of Mary, vol. i. pp. 384, 388."], [126, "158k 102 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. party abroad, and Elizabeth's discontented subjects at home, establish his rights, and overwhelm her oppressor. But the return of calmer consideration showed the madness of such a sehcme ; and her anxiety for the amicable recognition of the rights of her son to the English Crown, banished the sugges tions of personal resentment. In a memorial presented by Mary about this time to Elizabeth and her Par liament, she requested to be heard, by deputies whom she would appoint, upon the subject of her title and pretensions.1 It was not, she added, on her own account that she suggested this. Continued afflic tion had brought on a premature age ; sorrow had extinguished ambition ; and, with her shattered frame, it would be ridiculous to expect to survive Elizabeth. But she felt the natural anxiety of a mother to secure the rights of her child : and she entreated her sister of England to agree to her petition, and to recognise the undoubted title of her son, as the most certain means of promoting settled peace, and securing their mutual security. This sensible memorial experienced the same fate as her former petition : it made no impres sion upon the Queen of England, or her minis ters; and Mary, defeated in her moderate desires, was compelled to embrace more determined mea sures, and to throw herself entirely into the arms of France. This led to a new project, known by the name of \" The Association,\" and which appears to have originated about this time. It was proposed 1 Murdin, p. 3-;7."], [127, "1581. 103 JAMES VI. to the young King, that in order to have his title to the Scottish throne recognised by the powers of Europe, \u2014 none of whom, with the exception of Eng land, had yet publicly given him the name of King, \u2014 he should resign the Crown to his mother, under the condition, that she should retransmit it to him, and retire from all the active duties of the Government. But before pursuing this scheme, which led ultimately to important consequences, it is necessary to attend to the state of the Church, and its violent collision with the Crown. The struggle between Episcopacy and the Presby terian form of Church government, which had been originally established at the time of the Reformation, was now assuming every day a more determined and obstinate form. The young King, with his ministers, and favourites, Lennox and Arran, and a large pro portion of the nobility, supported Episcopacy. The ministers of the Kirk, and the great body of the burghers, and middle and lower classes of the people, were zealously attached to the Presbyterian model ; and considered the office of a Bishop as anti-Scrip tural, and a remnant of Popery. In a General Assembly, held some time previous to this, the \"\u25a0 Platform\" of Ecclesiastical government, drawn up by Andrew Melvil, had been ratified by a majoritv of the ministers ; and received the solemn sanction of the Church, under the title of \"The Second Book of Discipline.\"1 Under these conflicting cir- 1 Calderwood's History, pp. 97, 102, convened 20th April, 15SU Confessions of Faith, vol. ii. p. 807."], [128, "104 1581. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. cumstauces, the Duke of Lennox, whose influence with the young King gave him an almost absolute power in the disposal of patronage, appointed Mr Robert Montgomery to the vacant bishoprick of Glasgow. It was notorious to all, that this was a collusive and Simoniacal transaction ; for Montgo mery resigned the temporalities of the see to the Duke, and was contented to receive a small annual stipend out of its revenues. But the clergy, at first waving this objection, pronounced a high censure upon Montgomery, and interdicted him from accepting a bishoprick. He remonstrated, and wras supported by the King and his Council ; who contended, that as Episcopacy had never been abolished by the three Estates, no illegal act had been committed. The General Assembly of the Church soou after was convened in the capital; and as some private intelligence had been sent to Scotland of the intended \u2022' Association\" between the imprisoned Queen and the King her son, this ecclesiastical convention met in a state of much excitement.1 It was known that various missionary priests were secretly intrigu ing in the country ; that George Douglas had arrived on a mission from France, charged with secret despatches from the Bishops of Glasgow and Ross, her agents in that realm ; and great dread was enter tained of Lennox's increasing influence over the mind of the young King. Determined measures, therefore, were adopted by the Church. Articles against Mont gomery were drawn up, which condemned, in strong 1 Calderwood, p. 118."], [129, "1581. 105 JAMES VI. terms, his life, conversation, and opinions ; and al though, upon investigation, many faults objected to him turned out to be frivolous and unfounded, other matters were proved, which, it w7as contended, utterly incapacitated him for the office which he had accepted. He received an injunction, therefore, to continue in his ministry at Stirling ; and, under pain of the highest censures, to abandon all thoughts of the bishoprick. During these transactions, Elizabeth, who had be come alarmed on the subject of Scotland, and dreaded the preponderating influence of Lennox and Arran, despatched Captain Nicolas Arrington, an able officer of the garrison at Berwick, on a mission into that country. He was instructed to use his utmost efforts to persuade the King to continue in amicable relations with England ; to sow, if possible, by some secret practice, a division between the Duke of Len nox and the Earl of Arran ; and to expose the devices of France and Spain for the overthrow of religion, and the resumption of power by the Scottish Queen.1 It had been the advice of Sir Robert Bowes, in a letter addressed to Burghley, that every means should be adopted to increase some jealousies which, owing to the pride and intolerance of Arran, had arisen between him and the Duke. But after every effort to \" blow the coals,\"2 as he expressed it, these proud rivals became convinced that their safest policy wan to forget their differences, and unite against their 1 St. P.

A reconcilement, accordingly, took place ;* and Lennox, strong in the continued attach ment of the King, and the new friendship of Arran, de termined to concentrate his whole strength against that faction of the Kirk which opposed themselves to Epis copacy, and had threatened his Bishop with deposition. At this moment secret information of a threatening nature arrived from France. The reports regarding the progress of \"The Association\" between the Queen mother and her son were confirmed. It was said, that Lord Arbroath, the head of the great house of Hamilton, now in banishment, was to be restored by French influence, under the condition, that the \"Mass\" should return along with him. And Mr John Durie, one of the ministers of Edinburgh, sounded a fearful note of alarm, in a sermon which he delivered in the High Church of the city. \" The King,\" he said, \" had been moved by certain courtiers, who now ruled all at their, will, to send a private message to the King of France and the Duke of Guise, and to seek his mother's blessing. He knew this, he de clared, from the very man wbo was employed in the message \u2014 George Douglas, Mary's sworn servant; and he painted in strong colours the deplorable effects which might be anticipated from such a coalition. It was proposed, in these dark counsels, that the King should resign the Crown to his mother, and she con vey it again to him, with an assurance, that he should then be acknowledged as King by France, and by the powers of Europe, which, up to this time, had refused 1 Historie of King James the Sext, p. 1 86."], [131, "1581. 107 JAMES VI. him the royal title. And what must inevitably follow from all this? If the transaction were completed, it would be argued, that the establishment of religion, and all other public transactions since the coronation, were null ; that the King's friends were traitors, and their adversaries his only true subjects.\" After the sermon, a remarkable conference took place between the Earls of Argyle and Ruthven, and the ministers, Durie, Lawson, and Davison, in the Council-house. On being pressed as to the French intrigues, Argyle confessed that he had gone too far ; but affirmed, that if he saw anything intended against religion, he would forsake his friends, and oppose it to his utmost. To Ruthven, Davison the minister of Libberton, in allud ing to the murder of Riccio, used a still stronger argument \u2014 \" If things,\" said he, \" go forward as they are intended, your head, my Lord, will pay for Davie's slaughter. But Scottish nobles now are utterly un worthy of the place they hold : they would not, in other times, have suffered the King to lie alone at Dalkeith with a stranger, whilst the whole realm is going to confusion ; and yet the matter (they signifi cantly added) might be reformed well enough with quietness, if the noblemen would do their duty.\"1 Nor were these warnings and denunciations con fined to the nobility. The young King, when sitting in his private chamber in the Palace of Stirling, re ceived an admonition quite as solemn as any delivered to his subjects. It was entered by Mr John Davison, along with Duncanson the royal chaplain, and Mr 1 MS. Calderwood, Ayscougb, 4736, sol. 1172."], [132, "1581. 108 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Peter Young : and Davison, after pointing out the dreadful state of the country, exhorted him to put away those evil councillors who were so fast bringing ruin upon the commonweal, and his own soul. \" My liege,\" said he, \"at this present, there are three jewels in this realm precious to all good men \u2014 Religion, the Commonweal, and your Grace's person. Into what a horrible confusion the two first have entered, all men are witness ; but as to the third, your Grace hath need to beware, not only of the common hypo crites and flatterers, but more especially of two sorts of men. First ; such as opposed themselves to your Grace in your minority : wdiereby they have com mitted offences for which they must yet answer to the laws ; and, therefore, must needs fear the King. Remember the saying, 'Multis terribilis,caveto multos.' The second sort, are those who are conjured enemies to religion. If (he concluded) your Grace would call to you such godly men as I could name, they would soon show you whom they think to be included in these two ranks.\" It had been arranged before hand, that should the young King exhibit any desire to profit by this counsel, Davison was to name the Lairds of Dun, Lundie, and Braid, with Mr Robert Pont and Mr James Lawson, two of the leading ministers ; but James, after hearing the exordium, and observing hurriedly, that it was good counsel, started off from the subject, and broke up the inter view.1 1 MS. Calderwood, Brit. Mus. sol. 1172."], [133, "1582. 109 JAMES VI. These scenes of alarm and admonition were fol lowed by a violent attempt of Montgomery to possess himself of the bishoprick, in which he entered the Church at Glasgow, accompanied by a band of the royal guard, and in virtue of a charge addressed by the King to that Presbytery, endeavoured to expel the established minister from the pulpit, and to occupy his place. This was resisted by the Kirk ; and the ministers of the Presbytery of Glasgow were in con sequence summoned before the Council:1 but they defended themselves with the greatest courage, and, when pressed by the King, declined the judgment of the Sovereign, or his judges, in a matter not of a civil but of a purely spiritual nature. Lawson, Durie, Andrew Hay, and a large body of the ministers and elders from Edinburgh, Dalkeith, and Lithgow, ac companied them to Stirling; and when the King insisted that they should receive Montgomery, and warned them of the fatal consequences of a refusal, he was boldly reminded by Durie, that such intem perate proceedings would only lead to the excom munication of the man whom he favoured.2 This threat, and the preparations for carrying it into immediate execution, alarmed the object of the quar rel himself; and the submission of Montgomery to the 1 April 13, 1582. 2 Calderwood MS., sol. 1174.

This lull, however, was exceeding brief; and soon followed by a more determined collision between the antagonist principles of Presbyterianism and Episco pacy. The Kirk at this time possessed, amongst its ministers, some men of distinguished learning, and of the greatest courage. Durie, Lawson, Craig, Lindsay, Andrew Melvil, Thomas Smeton, Pont, Davison, and many others, presided over its councils ; and formed a spiritual conclave which, in the infalli bility they claimed, and the obedience they demanded, was a hierarchy in everything but the name. Elo quent, intrepid, and indefatigable, they had gained the affeetions of the lower classes of the people ; and were supported, also, by the increasing influence of the burghs and the commercial classes. Animated by such feelings, wielding such powers, and backed by such an influence, it was not to be expected that they would be easily put down. The great cause of Episcopacy, on the other hand, was supported by the young King, who was himself no contemptible theo logian ; by the Duke of Lennox, the Earl of Arran, and a large portion of the old nobility. Abroad, it looked to the sympathy and assistance of France ; and as the whole hopes of the imprisoned Queen, and the great body of the Roman Catholics in England, rested on Lennox and his friends, they were inclined to strengthen his hands in every possible way. The power of this party had recently been shown by the destruction of Morton, which they carried through"], [135, "1582. 111 JAMES VI. with a high hand against the whole influence of Eng land and the Kirk ; and, flushed by this success, they resolved to renew the battle with the Presbyte rian party, in the case of the Bishop of Glasgow ; which, however insulated or insignificant it might appear at first sight, really involved the establish ment or destruction of Episcopacy. Montgomery, a weak man, and wholly under the influence of Len nox, was easily persuaded to retract his submission, and repeat his attempts to possess himself of the bishoprick ; whilst, at this moment, the feelings of the ministers were goaded to the highest pitch of jealousy and resentment, by the arrival of a messenger from the Duke of Guise : ostensibly, he came with a present of horses to the King ; but it was suspected that more was intended than mere courtesy. The person who brought this gift was Signor Paul, the Duke's master-stabler, and, as was asserted, one of the most active and remorseless murderers at the massacre of St Bartholomew.1 It was scarcely to be expected that this should be tamely borne ; and John Durie, the minister of Edinburgh, instantly rode to Kinneil, Arran's castle, where the King had determined to receive Guise's envoy. Meeting Signor Paul in the garden, the minister hastily drew his cap over his eyes, declaring he would not pollute them by looking on the devil's ambassador ; and, turning to the King, rebuked him sharply for receiving gifts 1 MS. Calderwood, Ayscough, 4736, sol. 1189. \" This Seignor Paul was a famous murtherer at the massacre at Paris. No fitter man could be sent to make pastime to the King.\""], [136, "112 1582.

Listen not, then, to those ambassadors of the devil, wdio are sent hither to allure you from your religion.\" x To this indignant sally, James, overawed by the vehement tone of the remonstrant, quietly answered, \" that his body was pure ; and that he would have no woman for his wife who did not fear God and love the Evangell.\"2 From Kinneil, Durie returned to Edinburgh, where his zeal flamed up to the highest pitch ; and, trans forming the pulpit, as was the practice of those times, into a political rostrum for the discussion of the measures of the Government, he exposed the intrigues of Lennox, the schemes of the Queen-mother, and the profligacy of the Court, in such cutting and indignant terms, that he was immediately summoned before the Council, and ordered to quit the city.

Its ranks, as he informed the English secretary, embraced Arran, a great per secutor of the preachers, Huntley, Seton, Ogilvy, the Prior Maitland, (this was the younger brother of the famous Secretary Lethington,) Balfour, Robert Mel vil, Mr David Makgill, and one Mr Henry Keir. These, he added, were all Papists.2 But Carmichael, himself probably a rigid Presbyterian, was little disposed to make any distinction between those who supported Episcopacy, and the friends of the Church of Rome. Yet it must be remembered, that the re ported intrigues between the Courts of Spain and the Duke, with the secret negotiations of the Jesuits for the association of the Queen-mother with her son in the Government, gave him no little countenance in the assertion ; and the vigour with which Lennox pushed forward his measures against the Kirk, seemed to indicate a very formidable combination of forces. Undismayed, however, by the attack of their adver saries, the party of the Kirk only roused themselves to a more determined opposition : retaliated, by excommunicating Montgomery ; and called upon the people to weep for their sins, and be prepared to 1 MS.

The country, at this moment, must have presented an ex traordinary picture : the pulpits rang with alternate strains of lamentation and defiance. Patrick Simp son, alluding to the fate of Durie, declared, that the principal link in the golden chain of the ministry was already broken. Davison, a firmer spirit, whose small figure and undaunted courage had procured him from Lennox the soubriquet of the \"petit diable,\" exhorted his auditors to take courage, for God would dash the devil in his own devices ; and, on the 27th of June, an extraordinary Assembly of the Church was convened in the capital, to meet the crisis which, in the language of the times, threatened destruction to their Zion.1 The proceedings were opened by a remarkable sermon, or lecture, which Andrew Melvil delivered from the pulpit of the New Kirk. He chose for its subject the 4th chapter of the first Epistle to Timothy ; and, in speaking of the fearful trials and heresies of the \" latter days,\" inveighed, in no gentle terms, against the audacious proceedings of the Court. The weapon now raised against them, he described as the \"bloody gully2 of absolute power.\" Aud whence, said he, \" came this gully ? \u2014 From the Pope. \u2014 And against whom was it used ? \u2014 Against Christ himself: from whose divine head these daring and wicked men would fain pluck the crown, and from whose hands they would wrench the sceptre.

Was not the palpable object of this scheme, which had been con cocting these eight years past, the resumption of her lost power, and with it the reestablishment of her idolatrous worship ? Who were its authors ? Bea ton Bishop of Glasgow, and Lesly Bishop of Ross. And by what devices did this last-named prelate ex plain their intentions to the imprisoned Princess ? To the letters which he sent, he had added a paint ing of a Queen, with a little boy kneeling at her feet and imploring her blessing ; whilst she extended one hand to her son, and with the other pointed to his ancestors, as if she exhorted him to walk in their footsteps, and follow their faith.1 At this Assembly, it was warmly debated whether Durie was bound to obey the sentence of banishment \u2014 a point upon which opinions were much divided. The Provost and Magistrates contended that they must execute the law which had pronounced the sentence, or become amenable to its penalties. One party of the ministers, taking a middle course, advised that two of their brethren, Mr David Ferguson and Mi- Thomas Buchanan, should be sent to remonstrate with the King. But from this the fiery Davison loudly dissented. \" Ye talk,\" said he, \" of reponing John Durie. Will ye become suppliants for rein stating him whom the King had no power to dis place ; albeit, his foolish flock have yielded ? \" At 1 MS.

Balfour was noto rious as one of the murderers of Damley ; yet, having been acquitted of that crime by a packed jury, he had resumed his functions as an elder of the Kirk.1 Such a man was not likely to overawe the bold minister ; and he undauntedly continued. \" Tell me what flesh may or can displace the great King's ambassador, so long as he keeps within the bounds of his commis sion?\" Saying this, he left the Assembly in great heat, perceiving that the question would be carried against him, which accordingly happened ; for, on the resumption of the debate, it was determined that Durie should submit, if the Magistrates, who belonged to his flock, insisted. They did so : and that very evening, he was charged not only to depart from the town, but not to reside within the freedom and bounds of the city.2 About nine o'clock the same night, he was seen taking his way through the prin cipal street of the city, accompanied by two notaries, and a small band of his brethren ; among whom were Lawson, Balcanquel, and Davison. On reaching the Market-cross, he directed the notaries to read a written protestation, which attested the sincerity of his life and doctrine ; and declared, that although he obeyed the sentence of banishment, no mortal power should prevent him from preaching the Word.3 Upon this, placing a piece of money in the hands of the 1 MS.

But plague, and fearful judgments, will yet light on the inventors.\" All this, however, passed away quietly, except on the part of the speakers ; and the denuncia tions of the minister appear to have met with little sympathy. A shoemaker's wife in the crowd cried out, if any would cast stones at him, she would help.1 A by stander, also, was heard to whisper to his neighbour, looking with scorn on the two protesters, \"If I durst, I would take instruments that ye are both knaves.\"2 Shortly before this, a conference had been held at Stirling, between the Commissioners of the Court and the Kirk, which had concluded by the King directing the ministers to present him with a list of the grievances of which they complained. They accordingly prepared their \" Articles,\" which, in bold and unequivocal language, drew the distinction be tween the obedience they owed to the King and the submission which was due to the Kirk. They complained, that the monarch, by advice of evil councillors, had taken upon him that spiritual au thority which belonged to Christ alone, as the King 1 MS. CalderM'ood, sol. 1196.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and Head of His Church ; and, as examples of this unwarrantable usurpation, appealed to the late ban ishment of Durie, the maintaining an excommunicated Bishop, the interdicting the General Assembly from the exercise of their undoubted spiritual rights, and the evil handling of the brethren of Glasgow for doing their duty in the case of Montgomery.1 The presentation of these Articles was intrusted to a committee of the ministers. It embraced Pont, Lawson, Smeton, Lindsay, Hay, Polwart, Blackburn, Galloway, Christison, Ferguson, James Melvil, Buchanan, Brand, Gillespie, Duncanson the minister of the King's household, and Andrew Melvil, Principal of the new College at St Andrew's. To these a single lay man was added in the person of Erskine of Dun, a name much venerated in the history of the Kirk. It had been agreed, that these \" Griefs\" should be pre sented to the King in the beginning of July ; and on the sixth of that month, this intrepid band of minis ters set out for Perth, where James then held his Court. Their adversaries had in vain made many exertions to intimidate them ; and secret information had been sent by Sir James Melvil, to his relative Andrew Melvil, that his life was in danger ; but he only thanked God that he was not feeble in the cause of Christ, and proceeded forward with his brethren. On being ushered into the presence chamber, they found Lennox and Arran with the King; and laid their remonstrance on the table. 1 MS. St. P. Off, Advertisements from Scotland, 22d June, 1582. MS.

Arran took it up, glanced his eye over it, and furi ously demanded \" Who dares sign these treasonable Articles?\" \"We dare,\" responded Andrew Melvil, \" and will render our lives in the cause.\" As he said this, he came forward to the Council-table, took the pen, subscribed his name, and was followed by all his brethren. The two nobles were intimidated by this un looked-for courage: the King was silent; and, after some conference, the ministers were dismissed in peace.1 It would have been well for Lennox and Arran had they taken warning from these symptoms of determined opposition ; but they underrated the in fluence of the ministers, and were not aware that, at this moment, a strong party of the nobility was form ing against them. It was fostered by the Kirk, and encouraged by England ; whilst its leaders, as usual in such enterprises, appear, about this time, to have drawn up a written contract, which declared the purposes for which they had leagued together. This paper was entitled the \"Form of the Band, made among the noblemen that is enterprised against Dobany;\"2 and it described, in strong language, the causes which had led to the association. These were said to be, the dangers incurred by the professors of God's true religion ; the intended overthrow of the Gospel, by godless men, who had crept into credit with the King's Majesty ; the perversion of the laws ; the wreck of the ancient nobility and the ministers of 1 MS.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. religion ; the interruption of the amity with Eng land ; and the imminent peril of the King's person, unless some remedy were speedilyadopted. \" Where fore,\" (it continued,) \" we have sworn, in God's pre sence, and engaged, by this ' Band,' to punish and remove the authors of these intended evils, and to reestablish justice and good order, as we shall answer to the Eternal God, and upon our honour, faith, and truth.\"1 The original of this important paper has not been preserved ; and the names of the associators do not appear in the copy : but we may pronounce them, from the evidence of other letters, to have been the Earls of Gowrie, Mar, Glencairn, Argyle, Mont rose, Eglinton, and Rothes, with the Lords Lindsay, Boyd, and many others.2 The principal enemies to Lennox among the ministers, were Lawson, Lindsay, Hay, Smeton, Polwart, and Andrew Melvil.3 At the time this Band was formed, its authors had not fixed upon any precise mode of attack ; but the events which now occurred brought their measures to a head, and compelled them to act upon the offensive. Shortly previous to. the interview of the ministers with the King at Perth, Montgomery had been re instated in the bishoprick of Glasgow by the royal command ; and the sentence of excommunication pronounced upon him by the Kirk was reversed, and 1 Caligula, C. vii. sol. 14, Brit.

Calderwood, sol. 1201."], [145, "1582. 121 JAMES VI. declared null. To soften, at the same time, the effect of this strong measure of defiance, the King, by a public proclamation, renounced all intention of making any changes in religion ; and Montgomery, confiding in his restored honours, ventured from his seclusion at Dalkeith, where*he had resided with his patron Lennox, and oirce more showed himself in Edin burgh. But Lawson, one of the leading ministers, flew to the magistrates, accused them of permitting an excommunicated traitor to walk the streets ; and com pelled them to discharge him from their city.1 As he departed, Montgomery threatened that, within half an hour, they should change their tone; and, within a brief space, returned with a royal proclamation, which was read at the Cross, commanding all men to accept him as a true Christian and good subject. He brought, also, letters to the same purport, which were sent to the Lords of Session. All, however, was in vain, so strong was the popular current against him. The Provost, in an agony of doubt between his duty to the King and his allegiance to the Kirk, impre cated vengeance upon his head, and declared he would have given a thousand merks he had never seen his face. The Judges refused to hear him ; and a report arising, that he should be again expelled, an immense crowd assembled. Tradesmen, armed with bludgeons, and women with stones, waited round the door of the Court ; and their expected victim would probably have been torn in pieces, had he not been smuggled away by the Magistrates through a narrow lane called 1 MS.

His retreat, however, became known ; the people broke in upon him with many abusive terms. False traitor, thief, manswom carle, were bandied from mouth to mouth ; and as he sprung through the wicket, he received some smart blows upon the back. So little sympathy did he meet with from the King, that, when the story reached the Court at Perth, James threw himself down upon the Inch, and, calling him a seditious loon, fell into convulsions of laughter.1 The effect, however, was different upon Lennox. His penetration did not enable him to see the formid able strength which was gradually arraying itself against him ; and his blind obstinacy only hurried on the catastrophe. At the instigation of France,2 he determined, by a sudden attack, to overwhelm his enemies ; and, assisted by the force which himself and Arran could command, to seize the Earls of Gowrie, Mar, and Glencairn, with Lindsay, and the chief of the Protestant nobles. Having achieved this, and banished the leading ministers of the Kirk, he looked forward to a triumphant conclusion of his labours in the establishment of Episcopacy, and the association of the imprisoned Queen with the govern ment of her son. Bowes, however, the English Am bassador, became acquainted^with these intentions, 1 MS. CalderM-ood, sol. 1202. 2 Sir E. Bowes to Secretary Walsingham, August 15, 15S2. Orig. Draft.

The minuteness of the infor mation which this veteran diplomatist elicited by his pensioned informers, is remarkable. He assured Gowrie and his friends, that they must look to themselves, or be content soon to change a prison for a scaffold ; that he had certain intelligence the King had consented to arraign them of a conspiracy against his person : and they knew, that if convicted of treason, their fate was sealed. It was by Wal singham's orders that Bowes made this communi cation, in the hope it would rouse the enemies of Lennox to immediate exertion ; nor was he disap pointed.1 Appalled by the news, and aware that even a brief delay might sweep them over the preci pice on which they stood, it became necessary to act upon the moment. The only danger to be dreaded was in prematurely exploding the mine already in preparation, and thus risking a failure. The band, or contract, as we have seen, had been drawn up ; but it was still unsigned by many of the nobility. There was scarcely time to concentrate all their forces ; and although they made sure of the approval of the minis ters of the Kirk, who had already cordially cooperated with them in all their efforts against Lennox, still these ecclesiastical associates were now scattered in different parts of the country, and could not be indi vidually consulted. On the other hand, the danger 1 Orig. Draft. Sir Robert Bowes to Walsingham, August 25, 1582, Bowes' Letter-Book. See, also, Widdrington to Walsing ham, July 19, 1582, Caligula, C. vii."], [148, "124 1582. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. was imminent ; and, if they acted instantly, some circumstances promised success. The young King was at Perth, separated both from Lennox and Arran.1 He had resorted to that country to enjoy his favourite pastime of the chase ; his Court was few in number ; Gowrie, Glammis, and Lindsay, three of the chief conspirators, were all-powerful in the neighbourhood of Perth ; and should they delay, as had been intended, till the King removed to the capital, it would become more difficult, if not impossible, to execute their design. In this state of uncertainty, they received intelligence which made them more than suspect that Lennox had discovered their conspiracy.2 This settled the question : and having once decided on action, their proceedings were as bold as they had before been dilatory. In an incredibly short time, Gowrie, Mar, Lindsay, the Master of Glammis, and their associates, assembled a thousand men, and sur rounded Ruthven Castle, where the King then lay. It was Gowrie's own seat ; and James, who, it ap pears, had no suspicion of the toils laid for him, had accepted the invitation of its master, thinking only of his rural sports. To his astonishment, the Earls of Mar and Gowrie entered his presence, removed his guards, presented a list of their grievances, and, whilst they professed the utmost fidelity to his person, took special care that all possibility of escape was cut off. 1 Wednesday, 22d August.

Meanwhile, the intelligence flew to Arran that the King was captive ; and he and Colonel Stewart, his brother, set off in fiery speed at the head of a party of horse. Their attempt at rescue was, howTever, too late ; for Colonel Stewart was attacked, and de feated by Mar and Lochleven, who threw themselves upon him from an ambush, where they had watched his approach ; whilst Arran, who had galloped by a nearer way to Ruthven, was seized the moment he entered the Castle court, and confined under a guard. All this had passed with such rapidity, and the Lords who surrounded the King treated him with so much respect, that James deluded himself with the hope that he might still be a free monarch. But next morning dispelled the illusion. As he prepared to take horse, the Master of Glammis intimated to him that the Lords who were now with him deemed it safer for his Grace to remain at Ruthven. James declared he would go that instant, and was about to leave the chamber, when this baron rudely interposed, and placing his leg before the King, so as to inter cept the door-way, commanded him to remain. The indignity drew tears from the young monarch ; and some of the associated Lords remonstrated with Glammis ; but he sternly answered, \" Better bairns1 greet, than bearded men,\" \u2014 a speech which his royal master never afterwards forgot or forgave.2 But although thus far successful, the actors in this 1 Bairns, children ; greet, weep. 2 MS.

Gowrie, Mar, Glammis, and Lind say, were indeed all assured of each other, and con yinced that they must stand or fall together ; but the band or covenant which, according to the practice of the times, should have secured the assistance of their associates, was still unsigned by a great majority of the most powerful nobles and barons, on whose assistance they had calculated. On the other hand, the Duke of Lennox could reckon on the sup port of the Earls of Huntley, Sutherland, Morton, Orkney, Crawford, and Bothwell ; besides Lords Herries, Seton, Hume, Sir Thomas Ker of Fernyhirst, Sir James Balfour, the Abbot of Newbottle, and many inferior barons ; whilst the Earls of Caithness, March, and Marshal, professed neutrality.1 This array of opposition was sufficiently appalling ; and for a brief season the enterprisers of the Raid of Ruthven (as it was called) began to waver and tremble ;2 but a moment's consideration convinced them, that if there was danger in advance, there was infinitely greater in delay. They were already guilty of treason ; they had laid violent hands on the King's person ; had defied Lennox, imprisoned Arran, outraged the laws, and raised against them the feelings, not only of their opponents, but of all good citizens. If they drew back, ruin was inevitable. If they went forward, although 1 St. P. Off. Names of the noblemen and lords that as yet stand with the Duke, 5th Sept., 1582. 2 MS. Caligula, C. vii. sol. 23.

They had the young King in their hands, and could work upon his timidity and inexperience. by menacing his life : they had possession of Arran, also \u2014 a man whom they dreaded far more than the gentler and vacillating Lennox : they were certain of the active support of the ministers of the Kirk ; and Bowes and Walsingham had already assured them of the warm approval, and, if necessary, the assistance of England. All this was encouraging; and they determined, at every risk, to press on resolutely in the revolution which they had begun. In the meantime, whilst such scenes passed at Ruthven, the capital presented a stirring scene. Lennox, who was at his Castle of Dalkeith, in the immediate neighbourhood of the city, when he re ceived the intelligence of the surprise of the King, deeming himself insecure in the open country, took refuge with his household within the town. On his arrival, the magistrates despatched messengers to Ruthven, to ascertain the truth or falsehood of the King's captivity from his own lips ; the ministers of the Kirk began to exult, and rouse the people to join with the Ruthven lords ; and Mr James Law son, although earnestly entreated, by the Provost of the city, to be temperate in his sernipn, replying, in the words of Micah, that what the Lord put in his mouth he would speak, L seized the opportunity to deliver, from the pulpit, a bitter and emphatic attack upon the Duke and his profligate associate. 1 Calderwood, MS.

It was true, he said, that these two barons had subscribed the Confession of Faith, pro fessed the true religion, and communicated with their brethren at the Lord's table ; but their deeds testified that they were utter enemies of the truth. Had they not violated discipline, despised the solemn sentence of excommunication, set up Tulchan bishops, and traduced the most godly of the nobility and of the ministry ? And as for this Duke of Lennox, what had been his practices since the day he came amongst them ? With what taxes had he burdened the Com monwealth, to sustain his intolerable pride ? What vanity in apparel ; w7hat looseness in manners ; what superfluity in banqueting ; what fruits and follies of French growth had he not imported into their simple country ? Well might they be thankful ; well praise God for their delivery from what was to have been executed the next Tuesday. Well did it become Edinburgh to take up the song of the Psalmist \u2014 \"Laqueus contritus est, et nos libcrati sumus.\"1 Whilst the ministers of the Kirk thus eulogised the enterprise of the Ruthven lords, Elizabeth, who had speedily received intelligence of their success, despatch ed Sir George Carey to Scotland, with letters to the young King, and instructions to cooperate with her Am bassador Bowes, in strengthening the hands of Gowrie, andhisfaction. Randolph, too, wrote in great exultation to Walsingham, rejoicing in the success of the revolu tion ; and, with the avidity and instinct of the bird which comes out in the storm, requesting to be again 1 Calderwood MS., sol. 1206, Ayscough, 4736, Brit.

Unmoved by the violence of the measures which had been adopted, he, in the spirit of the Puritan party to which he belonged, pronounced the King's capti vity a reward conferred by God on his sincere fol lowers. \" If it be true,\" said he, \" that the King be now in the Protestants' hands, the Duke pursued, Arran imprisoned, and his brother slain, we may then see from this what it is to be true followers of Christ, in earnest preaching, and persevering in set ting forth His word without respect or worldly poli cies.\"1 It seems strange it should never have occur red to this zealous diplomatist, that the imprisonment of a King, and the violent invasion and slaughter of his councillors, were not the fruits to be expected from the gospel of peace and love. Meanwhile, the captive monarch considered the late proceedings in a very different light, and medi tated many schemes of escape and revenge ; but he was alone, and closely watched : he did not even consider his life in safety ; and although it would be difficult to believe that Gowrie and his associates had any such atrocious designs, yet the history of Scotland afforded him too good a ground for these apprehensions. Lennox, on the other hand, was timid and irresolute, allowed the precious moments for action to pass, and contented himself with de spatching Lord Herries, and the Abbot of Newbottle, 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, 2d Sept., 1582, Maidstone. VOL. VIII.

Without giving Gowrie, or his friends, a moment to reply, James started from his seat, crying out it was all true : he was a cap tive ; he was not at liberty to go where he chose, or to move a step without a guard : and he bade them tell it openly, that all who loved him should assist the Duke, and achieve his deliverance. The Ruthven lords were, for a moment, overwhelmed with confusion : but they outbraved the accusation. Their Sovereign, they declared, had no more faithful subjects than themselves; nor should he be denied to go where he pleased ; only, they would not per mit the Duke of Lennox, and the Earl of Arran, to mislead him any longer. If he valued, therefore, the life of that person, he would do well to cause 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off."], [155, "131 1582. JAMES VI him to retire instantly, and quietly, to France. If this were not done, they must call him to account for his late actions, and enforce against him the most rigorous penalty of the law. Such was the message which they sent back by Lord Herries ; and they followed it up by a peremptory command to Lennox to deliver up Dumbarton Castle, and quit the king dom within twelve days ; orders which, after a short consideration, he despondingly prepared to obey.

Mr John Durie, who had been banished from his pulpit in the capital, was brought back in processional triumph. As he entered the town, a crowd of nearly two thousand people walked before him bareheaded, singing the 124th Psalm ; and, amid the shouts of the citizens, con ducted him to the High Church. It was observed that Lennox, from a window, looked down in anger, but showed no disposition to contest the field with"], [156, "1582. 132 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. his enemies ; and next day, accompanied by Lord Maxwell, Fernyhirst, and others of his friends, he left the city, and took the road to Dalkeith. This, however, was only to blind his opponents; for he soon wheeled off in an opposite direction, and, with eighty horse, galloped to Dumbarton.1 Meanwhile, Gowrie and his associates carried all with a bold hand. They had already compelled the King to issue a Proclamation, in which he declared that he was a free monarch, and preferred to re main for the present at Stirling : both assertions being well known to be false. They now committed Arran to a stricter ward, summoned a Convention of the nobility for an early day, required the Kirk to send Commissioners to this Assembly, promised to hear and remove its complaints, and gave a cordial welcome to Sir George Carey and Sir Robert Bowes, the English Ambassadors, who had now arrived at Stirling.2 At this audience Carey delivered a gracious mes sage from his royal mistress ; but when he alluded to the dangerous practices of Lennox, and charged him with meditating an alteration in religion, and the overthrow of the King's estate and person, James 1 MS.

He warmly vindicated his favourite : affirmed that no thing had been done by Lennox alone, but with advice of the Council ; and declared his utter disbelief that any treason could be proved against him.1 Eliza beth and Walsingham, however, trusted that this would not be so difficult ; for they had lately seized and examined two persons, who managed the secret correspondence which the imprisoned Queen of Scots had recently carried on with Lennox, her son, and the Court of France. These were, George Douglas of Lochleven, the same who had assisted the Queen in her escape ; and the noted Archibald Douglas, cousin to the late Regent Morton, who had remain ed in exile in England since the execution of his relative and the triumph of Lennox. This Archibald, a daring and unprincipled man, had been a principal agent in the murder of Darnley, and had played, since that time, a double game in Eng land. He had become reconciled to Lennox, and was trusted, in their confidential measures, by Mary and the French Court ; whilst he had ingratiated him self with Elizabeth, Walsingham, and Randolph, to whom he unscrupulously betrayed the intrigues of their opponents. On the late fall of Arran, the mortal enemy of the house of Douglas, he had writ ten an exulting letter to Randolph,2 and had begun. his preparations for his return to his native country, 1 Calderwood, MS.

It was evident, also, that a constant communication had been kept up between Lennox, the captive Queen, and the Bishop of Glasgow, her ambassador at the French court; but it would have required much in genuity to construe this into treason on the part of Lennox, and the examinations of Archibald Douglas gave no colour to the accusation. Arran, indeed, who was still a prisoner at Ruthven, offered to purchase his freedom by discovering enough to cost Lennox his head;2 but the Lords would not trust him, and preferred relying on their own exertions to so danger ous an alliance. In these efforts they derived the most active assis tance from the ministers of the Kirk, who, on first 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. Henry Killigrew to Walsingham, 17th September, 1582. 8 MS.

Two days after this, Lennox, from his retreat at Dumbarton, published an indignant denial of the accusations brought against him; in which he demanded a fair trial before the three Estates, and declared his readiness to suffer any punishment, if found guilty.3 He alluded, in this, to the King's captivity; and retorted against the Ruthven lords the charge of treason : but the associates fulminated a counter declaration ; repelled this as an unfounded calumny, and insisted, that to say the King was de tained against his will, was a manifest lie, the contrary being known to all men.4 What shall we say or think of the Kirk, when we find its ministers lending their countenance and assent to an assertion which they must have known to be utterly false ?

His intellect, naturally fearless and inquisitive, caught an early and eager hold of the principles of the Reforma tion; and having gone abroad, and fallen into the toils of the inquisition, persecution completed what nature had begun. In politics he was a republican; and his famous treatise \" De Jure Regni apud Scotos,\" was the first work which boldly and eloquently advocated those principles of popular liberty, then almost new, and now so familiar to Europe. In religion he was at first a leveller, and with the keen and vindictive temper which distinguished him, exerted every effort to overthrow the Roman Catholic Church ; but, in his later years, when the struggle took place between Episcopacy and Presbyterianism, his sentiments be came more moderate or indifferent ; and latterly he took no part in those busy intrigues of the Kirk and its supporters, which terminated in the Raid of Ruth ven. Of his poetical works, so varied in style and so excellent in execution, it is difficult to speak too highly; for seldom did a finer and more impassioned vein of poetry flow through a Latinity that, without servile imitation, approached so near to the Augustan age. In his history of his native country he is great, but unequal: his was not the age of severe and criti cal investigation; the school in which he studied was that of Livy and the historians of ancient Rome, in which individuality and truth is often lost in the"], [161, "1582. 137 JAMES VI. breadth and generality of its pictures. But in their excellencies, he has equalled and sometimes surpassed them. The calm flow of his narrative, his lucid ar rangement, the strong sense, originality, and depth of his reflections, and the ease and vigour of his unshackled style, need not dread a comparison with the best au thors of the ancient world. The point where he fails is that where they too are weakest \u2014 the cardinal virtue of truth. It is melancholy to find so much fable em balmed and made attractive in his earlier annals; and when he descends later, and writes as a contemporary, it is easy to detect that party spirit and unhappy obliquity of vision, which distorts or will not see the truth. In an interesting letter quoted by the best of his biographers,1 and written not long before his death, he tells his friend, that having reached his seventy fifth year, and struck upon that rock beyond which nothing remains for man but labour and sorrow, it was his only care to remove out of the world with as little noise as possible. With this view he abstracted himself from all public business ; left the Court at Stirling, and retired to Edinburgh; where, on the 28th September, 1582, his wishes were almost too literally fulfilled : for amid the tumult and agitation which succeeded the Raid of Ruthven, his death took place in his 76th year, unnoticed, unrecorded, and accom panied by such destitution, that he left not enough to defray his funeral. He was buried at the public expense in the cemetery of the Grey Friars : but his 1 Irving's Life of Buchanan, p. 273."], [162, "1582. 138 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. country gave him no monument; and at this day the spot is unknown where rest the ashes of one of the greatest of her sons.1 Soon after the death of Buchanan, the General Assembly met at Edinburgh on the 9th October ; and the noblemen who had engaged in the enterprise at Ruthven, having laid before this great ecclesiastical Council their \" Declaration\" of the grounds on which they acted, received, to their satisfaction, the cordial approval of the Kirk. Nor was this all : the Assembly issued their orders, that every minister throughout the kingdom should justify the action, and explain to his congregation the imminent perils from which it had delivered religion, the Commonwealth, and the King's person ; and not satisfied even with this, it determined to institute a rigid prosecution of all persons who presumed to express a different opinion.2 But although thus resolute in the support of the Ruth ven confederates, as far as concerned their seizure of the King, the ministers severely rebuked the same noblemen for the profligacy of their lives, and their sacrilegious appropriation of the ecclesiastical reve nues. Davison the minister of Libberton, in his conference with Gowrie and his friends, called loudly on them to begin their reformation of the Common wealth with a thorough reform of their sinful and 1 Irving's Life of Buchanan, p. 309.

By her anxious and repeated orders he exerted himself to obtain it ; but without success. Gowrie at first equivocated, and was unwilling to admit the fact; but when Bowes convinced him that he had certain proof of it, he changed his ground, alleging that such precious papers could not be delivered to Elizabeth without the special directions of the King. This was absurd, for James at this moment was a mere cipher; but the leader in the late revolution did not choose to part with papers which, inhis busy and intriguing career, he might one day turn to his advantage.3 Gowrie's is the last hand into which we can trace these famous letters, which have since totally disappeared. 1 MS.

The situation of James was now pitiable and de grading. He hated the faction who had possession of his person; but terror for his life compelled him to dissemble, and convinced him, that to gain delay and throw his enemies off their guard by appearing re conciled to the dismissal of Lennox, was the surest step to a recovery of his liberty. The most anxious wish of his heart was to see the Duke restored to his former power; but to betray this now, would, he thought, be to bring his favourite into more imminent peril; whilst if he allowed him to retire for a short season to France, he might not only escape ruin, but return with renewed influence and power. There were some friends of Lennox, on the other hand, who exhorted him strongly to attack his enemies, and assured him that every day spent in inactivity, added strength to their position and weakened his own ; whereas if he boldly faced the danger, they were ready to assemble a force sufficient to overwhelm Gowrie, and rescue the king. These so far prevailed, that on one of the dark nights of December,1 it was resolved to attack the Palace of Holyrood, massacre the Ruthven lords, and carry off the King ; but the ministers, and Sir George Bowes the English Am bassador, sounded the alarm ; a strong watch was kept ; and although Fernyhirst, Maxwell, Sir John Seton, and other barons, were known to have joined Lennox, and parties of horsemen were seen hovering all night round the city, the enterprise, from some 1 On the 4th December, 1582."], [165, "1582. 141 JAMES VI. unknown cause was abandoned, and theKingremained a prisoner.1 This failure was a triumph to the opposite faction, who lost no time in following up the advantage. A letter was sent to the Duke, to which the King had been compelled to put his name, charging him with disturbing the government, and recklessly endangering the safety of the royal person ; whilst a Herald was despatched to command him, in the name of the Council, instantly to leave the country upon pain of treason.2 This order, after many vain pretexts and fruitless delays, he at last obeyed ; having first sent a passionate remonstrance to his royal master, against the cruelty and injustice with which he had been treated.3 On his road to London, (for he had obtained permission to pass through England into France,) he encountered two ambassadors who were posting to the Scottish Court: La Motte, who carried a message from the King of France; and Davison, who was commissioned by Elizabeth to examine the state of parties in Scotland and cooperate with Bowes in strengthening the Ruthven faction.

Walsingham, therefore, threw every delay in the way of the French Ambassador ; and he acted so successfully, that La Motte found all his purposes counteracted. He was eager to hurry into Scotland before Lennox had left it; but matters were so managed, that they only met on the road; and here, too, Davison, who had received his lesson, took care that their conference should be of the briefest description.2 Lennox then passed on to London, and the French and English Ambassadors held their way for Scotland. Meanwhile, the Ruthven lords, with their allies the ministers of the Kirk, were now much elated by the triumph over Lennox ; and Bowes, in a letter to Walsingham, assured the Secretary, that Elizabeth might have them all at her devotion if she would but 1 MS.

He came nominally from the King of Scots, but really from them, and brought letters to Walsing ham from Gowrie, Mar, the Prior of Blantyre, and the Abbot of Dunfermline, the great leaders of that party. On his arrival at Court, he found there his old antagonist the Duke of Lennox, who had brought a letter and a message to Elizabeth from the King of Scots. This princess had, at first, refused to see him under any circumstances ; but afterwards admitted him to a private interview, in which, to use the homely but expressive phrase of Calderwood the historian of the Kirk, \" she rattled him up,\"2 address ing to him, at first, many cutting speeches on his misgovernment; to which the Duke replied with so much gentleness and good sense, that she softened down before they parted and dismissed him courte ously.3 During Lennox's brief residence in London, Secre tary Walsingham exerted the utmost efforts to dis cover his real sentiments on religion ; as the ministers of the Kirk insisted that, not withstanding his professed 1 MS.

It is curious to observe by what low devices, and with what complete success, the English Secretary became pos sessed of Lennox's most secret feelings and opinions. There was at the English Court one Mr William Fowler, a gentleman of Scottish extraction, and apparently connected with the Duke, who admitted him into his secret confidence. Fowler, at the same time, had insinuated himself into the good graces of Mau vissiere, the resident French Ambassador at the Court of Elizabeth ; and, by pretending a devoted attach ment to French interests and the cause of the captive Oueen of Scots, he had become acquainted with much of the intentions and intrigues of Mary and her friends. This man was a spy of Walsingham's ; and his letters to this statesman, detailing his secret conversations with Lennox and Mauvissiere, have been preserved. The picture which they present is striking. In their first interview, Lennox showed much satisfaction. \" Your mother's house,\" said he to Fowler, \" was the first I entered, in coming to Scotland, and the last I quitted, in leaving the country.\" The Duke then told him that the French Ambassador was not in London, but had been sent for suddenly to Court. This was a trick, he added, to prevent a meeting between him and Mauvissiere ; and he heard, also, that the Queen of England would not see him; but, in truth, he had little to say to her, except to complain of the conduct of her ambassador in Scotland. At this moment their"], [169, "1582-3. 145 JAMES VI. conference was broken off by some of the courtiers, who appeared dissatisfied that they should talk to gether; and the Master of Livingston, who was in the confidence of Lennox and his friends, joined the party. Fowler, upon this, took Livingston aside, and express ed his astonishment that the Duke should have left Scotland when he could muster so strong a party against his enemies. Livingston replied, that Lennox knew both his own strength and the King's good will; but that hehad been forced to leave Scotland, \"because the King mistrusted very much his own life and safety; having been sharply threatened by the lords, that, if he did not cause the Duke to depart, he should not be the longest liver of them all.\" J Arran, it appeared, had also written to James, assuring, him that the only suretv for his life was to send Lennox out of Scotland; and Fowler, in his secret meetings with Mauvissiere the French Ambassador, had the address to elicit from him, and communicate to Walsingham, the intended policy of France. La Motte Fenelon had been sent, he said, to renew the old league with Scotland ; to offer succour to the young King, if he found him in captivity, and a guard for the security of his person ; to promise pensions to the principal noblemen in Scotland, as they had in Cardinal Beaton's time; and, if possible, to advise a marriage with Spain. As to James's religious sentiments, Lennox had assured Mauvissiere that the young King was so constant to the reformed faith, that he would los? his life rather 1 Fowler to Walsingham, Jan. 5, 1582-3.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. than forsake it; and when the ambassador asked the Duke whether he, too, was a Huguenot, he declared that he professed the same faith as his royal master.1 At the same time that he thus fathomed the schemes of Lennox and the French Court, Walsingham had secured and corrupted another agent of the captive Queen, who, on the discovery of his practices with Mary and the English Catholics, had, as we have above seen, been thrown into prison by Elizabeth. This was the noted Archibald Douglas, a man of consider able ability and restless intrigue. It had been pro posed by Lennox to bring Douglas back to Scotland, and employ his power and talents against the English faction and the Kirk; but the young King had shrunk from receiving a man stained with his father's blood : and the prisoner, anxious for his freedom, was ready to purchase it by betraying the secrets of his royal mistress; and now plotted against her with the same activity which he had exerted in her behalf.2 We shall soon perceive the success of this base scheme, and its fatal influence upon the fate of Mary. In the meantime, Elizabeth gave an audience to Colvile the Ambassador of Gowrie and the Kirk, and assured him of her entire approval of their spirited proceedings against Lennox. She cautioned him, in strong terms, against French intrigues; observing, that though the King promised fair, yet, as the recent conspiracy for seizing his person plainly showed, 1 Fowler to Walsingham, 19th January' 1582-3.

James, whom necessity had made an adept in political hypocrisy, or, as he sometimes styled it, King-craft, pretended to be completely reconciled to the departure of Lennox, and said nothing against the violent conduct of his opponents; whilst he secretly plotted for the recall of his favourite, and anticipated the moment when he should resume his liberty, and take an ample revenge upon his enemies. The min isters, on their side, deemed the season too precious to be neglected; they had expelled the man whom they considered the emissary of Antichrist, the young King's person was in the hands of their friends, and they determined that he should remain so. Such being the state of things, the arrival of Monsieur de Menainville the French Ambassador, and his request to have a speedy audience of the King, aroused them to instant action. From the pulpits resounded the notes of warning and alarm : France was depicted as the stronghold of idolatry ; the ' St. P. Off, 18th Jan., 1582-3. Her Majesty's Answer to Mr Colvile's Negotiation."], [172, "1582-3. 148 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. French King pointed out as the Tiger who glutted himself with the blood of God's people ; it became amongst them a matter of serious debate whether it were lawful to receive any ambassador from an idolator ; and when the more violent could not carry their wishes, and it was decided that, \"in matters politick,\" such a messenger might be permitted to enter the kingdom, a Committee wras appointed to wait upon the young King, and read him a solemn lesson of admonition. 1 In this interview James behaved with spirit, and proved a match in theological and political controversy for the divines who came to instruct him. These were, Pont, Lawson, Lindsay, and Davison ; and, on entering the royal cabinet, they found Gowrie, the Justice-clerk, and others of the Council, with the King, who thanked them for their advice, but observed that he was bound by the law of nations to use cour tesy to all ambassadors. Should an envoy come from the Pope, or even from the Turk, still he must receive him. This Lawson stoutly controverted ; but the King not only maintained his point, but took occasion to blame the abuse with which this minister had as sailed the French monarch. \"As for that,\" said thev, \"the priests speak worse of your Grace in France, than we of the King of France in Scotland.\" \u2014 \" And must ye imitate them in evil?\" retorted James. \u2014 \" Not in evil,\" wras their answer, \"but in liberty. It is as fair for us to speak the truth boldly, as they boldly speak lees;2 and if we were silent, the chronicles 1 MS. Calderwood, pp. 1247, 1251, inclusive, Brit.

Avould speak and reprove it.\" \u2014 \" Chronicles,\" said James, \" ye write not histories, when ye preach.\" Upon which Davison whispered in Lawson's ear, that preachers had more authority to declare the truth in preaching, than any historiographer in the world. Gowrie then observed, that as hasty a rid dance as might be, should be got of the French Am bassadors ; and the ministers took their leave, but Davison lingered for a moment behind his brethren, craved a private word in the King's ear, and remon strated sotto voce against his profane custom of swearing in the course of his argument. \" Sir,\" said he, \"I thought good to advertise you, but not before the rest, that ye swore and took God's name in vain too often in your speeches.\" James was nowise dis pleased with this honest freedom ; but, accompany ing the reverend monitor to the door of the Cabinet, put his hand lovingly upon his shoulder, expressed his thanks for the reproof, and, above all, lauded him for the unusually quiet manner in which it had been administered.1 * - No such reserve or delicacy, however, was shown by the ministers to the French Ambassadors; and Monsieur de Menainville \u2014 a man of great spirit was compelled to vindicate their privileges in his first public audience. It had been debated by the Kirk, with a reference to their arrival, whether private masses should be permitted under any circumstances ; and aware of this, he had scarcely risen from kissing 1 MS. Calderwood, sol. 1250, 1252."], [174, "1582-3. 150 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the King's hand, when he put on his cap, and boldly claimed the privileges which belonged to his office. \" I am come,\" said he, \" from the most Christian King of France, my Sovereign, to offer all aid to the establishment of quietness ; and being an Ambassa dor, and not a subject, I crave to be treated as such; and as I have food allotted for my body, so do I require to be allowed the food of my soul, \u2014 I mean the Mass; which if it is denied me, I may not stay and suffer a Christian Prince's authority and embassy to be violated in my person.\"1 This spirited address made much noise at the time; and drew from Mr James Lawson, on the succeeding Sabbath, a coun terblast of defiance, in which, seizing the opportunity of elucidating the mission of the King of Babylon, he \"pointed out the French ambassage,\" and de nounced Mons. de Menainville as the counterpart of the blasphemous and railing Rabshakeh. Nor was this all : the indignation of the Kirk was roused to a still higher pitch, when the King commanded the magistrates of the capital to give (as had been usual in such cases) a farewell banquet to De laMotte Fenelon. This Ambassador now proposed to return to France, leaving his colleague, Monsieur de Menainville, to watch over the interests of that kingdom in Scotland; and nothing could equal the abuse and opprobrious terms which were employed, to convince men of the horror of such a proposal. Even the sacred orna ment of the Cross, which La Motte, who was a 1 MS. Calderwood, sol. 1 25:?."], [175, "1582-3, 151 JAMES VI. Knight of the Order of \" Saint Esprit,\" wore upon his mantle, was described as the badge of Antichrist; and when the influence of the ministers was found insufficient to stay the feast, a solemn fast was pro claimed for the same day, to continue as long as the alleged profane entertainment was enacting. At this moment, the scene presented by the capital was extraordinary. On one side the King and his cour tiers indulging in mirth and festive carousal ; whilst, on the other, was heard the thunder of the Kirk, and its ministers \" crying out all evil, slanderous, and inr jurious words that could be spoken against France;\" and threatening with anathema and excommunica tion the citizens who had dared to countenance the unhallowed feast.1 Meanwhile the King became every day more weary of his captive condition; and secretly favoured the efforts of De Menainville, who remained in Scotland, and spared neither money nor promises in drawing- together a faction against Gowrie and his associates. It was necessary, however, to act slowly and with great caution, for the keen eyes of Bowes and Davi- son, Elizabeth's agents at the Scottish Court, early detected these intrigues. Walsingham, too, was in- formed of the frequent communications which took place between the captive Queen and her son ; and his spies and agents on the continent sent him, almost daily, information of the correspondence of the Eng lish refugees and foreign Catholics with their friends 1 Spottiswood, p. 324. Historie of James the Sext, pp. 196, 197- MS.

It was in vain that she commanded Bowes and Davison to remonstrate with the young King, \u2014 to wTarn him of the confederacies of foreign Princes against religion, \u25a0 \u2014 to point out the great forces lately raised in France, \u2014 to declare her astonishment at his suffering the insolence of De Menainville, and receiving, as she heard he had done, with complacency, the congratu lations of La Motte on his intended \" Association\" with his mother, the Queen of Scots. It wTas in vain that she expressed her alann at the report which had reached her, that he meant to recall the Duke of Lennox from France, and restore the Earl of Arran to his liberty ; in vain that she begged him to peruse the letter written to him with her own hand, express ing her opinion of that turbulent man whose ambition knew no limits, and would inevitably cast his State into new troubles. These remonstrances James, who was an early adept in diplomatic hypocrisy, received with expressions of gratitude and devotedness ; but they did not in the slightest degree alter his efforts to regain his freedom, and strengthen his party; whilst, 1 MS.

This patience, indeed, was still necessary ; for, although gradually losing ground, the strength of Gowrie, and the faction of the Kirk, was yet too powerful for their opponents ; and a Convention hav ing been held by them in the capital, (18th April, 1583,) it was resolved to assemble Parliament. Against this measure James, who dreaded the pro scription of his friends, and the total overthrow of his designs, remonstrated in the strongest terms, and even to tears, when his request was denied. He prevailed so far, however, as to have the meeting of the three Estates delayed till October ; and cheerfully consent ed that a friendly embassy should be despatched to England. To this service, two persons of very opposite principles were appointed : Colonel Stewart, the brother of the Earl of Arran, who was much in the King's confidence, and had been bribed by Do Menainville ; and Mr John Colvile, who was attached to Gowrie and the Ruthven lords. Their open in structions were to communicate to Elizabeth, from the King, the measures he had adopted for the secu rity and tranquillity of his realm ; to request her approval and assistance ; to move her to restore the lands in England which belonged to his grandfather, the Earl of Lennox, and the Countess of Lennox, his grandmother, and to have some consultation on his"], [178, "154 1582-3. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. marriage.1 They were, lastly, enjoined to make strict inquiry whether any act was contemplated in preju dice of his succession to the English Crown, and, if possible, to ascertain the Queen's own feelings upon this delicate subject.2 De Menainville, the French Ambassador, still lingered in Scotland, although he had received his answer, and applied for his passports ; 3 but the King was unwilling that he should leave Court before he had completely organized the scheme for his delivery. Of all these intrigues Walsingham was fully aware : for De la Motte Fenelon, in pass ing through London,4 had informed Fowler of the great coalition against the Ruthven lords; and Fowler, of whose treacherous practices the Ambassador had no suspicion, told all again to Walsingham.5 It appeared, from these revelations, that La Motte had in his pocket, to be presented to his master the French King, a list of the most powerful noblemen in Scot land who had banded together for the King's delivery. These were the Earls of Huntley, Arran, Athol, Mon trose, Rothes, Morton, Eglinton, Both well, Glencairn, and Crawford, with the Lords Hume and Seton. The young King himself had secretly assured La Motte Fenelon, \"that, although he had two eyes, two ears, and two hands, he had but one heart, and 1 MS. Calderwood, sol. 1257. St. P.

The young King, it appeared by their contents, had been urged to explode the mine, and at once destroy the lords who held him in durance ; but he dreaded to lose Elizabeth's favour, and was convinced that a premature attempt would ruin all. His wish was to dissemble matters till the return of his Am bassadors, Colonel Stewart and Colvile, from the mission to England, and they had not yet left Scot land. Mauvissiere, in the meantime, had warned Menainville, that Stewart, whose passion was money, was likely to betray him ; and his reply is so charac teristic that I insert it : \" As to him who comes into England, (he means Stewart,) all your reasons, as far as my judgment goes, militate against your own 1 St. P.

For if it is his trade to be treacherous to all the world, why should he be unfaithful to me more than to any other ? He loves money : granted ; but to take my gold does not hinder him from receiv ing another's. May we not hope, that such a man will do more for two sums than for one ? He is a party man. I admit it ; but show me any man who has his own fortune at heart, and does not trim with the times ? His chief interest lies in England, believe me, much less than in another place which you wot of, where he may hope to gain more by a certain way in which I have instructed him, (and which he will show you,) than by any other service in the world. For the rest, the game is a good game.\"1 It must have been tantalizing to Walsingham, whose unceasing exertions had thus detected the plots of the French Court in Scotland, to find that all their efforts to defeat them, and keep the English party together, were ruined by Elizabeth's extreme parsi mony. In other matters, not involving expense, she was active and vigorous enough. Holt, the Jesuit, who was engaged in secret transactions with the Scottish Catholics, had been seized at Leith ; and Elizabeth strongly recommended that he should be, as she expressed it, \"substantially examined, and forced, by torture,\" to discover all he knew.2 She wrote to Gowrie, and to the young King ;3 she urged 1 Copy, St. P.

About this same time, and shortly before the Scot tish Ambassadors set out for England, the captive Queen of Scots, wrorn out with her long imprisonment, and weary of the perpetual dangers and anxieties to which the efforts of the Catholic party exposed her, renewed her negotiations with Elizabeth. Some months before this she had addressed a pathetic and eloquent appeal to that Princess, imploring her to abate the rigour of her confinement, to withdraw her support from the rebels who kept her son in durance, and to listen to the sincere offers she had so repeat edlymade for an accommodation. Someof the passages in this letter were so touchingly expressed, that it is difficult to believe even the cold and politic heart of the English Queen could have been insensible to them; but there wTere others so cuttingly ironical, and at the same time so true, that we cannot wonder the epistle 1 MS.

It may be doubted whether she had any serious intentions of listening to Mary : but she was anxious, before she received the Ambassadors, Stewart and Colvile, to probe her feelings, and ascer tain how far there existed any mutual confidence between her and her son ; and Beal's letters to Wal singham present us with an interesting picture of this conference. Lord Shrewsbury had been associated with him in the negotiation, of which he gave this account to the English Secretary : \" Since our last despatch,\" said he, \" this Earl and I have once re paired unto this lady; and whilst he went out to meet some gentleman of the country at the cockfight, it pleased her to spend some part of the afternoon in talk with me, of sundry matters of the Estate of Scotland. * * In conclusion, she solemnly pro tested, before Nau,2 that she and her son would do anything they could to deserve her Majesty's favour; and said that she was not so irreligious and careless of her honour and the force of an oath, as either before God or man she should be found to break that which she had promised; and she added, that she was now old, and that it was not for her now to seek any ambition or great estate, either in the one realm or the other, as in her youth she might; but only desired to live the rest of the small time of her life, in quiet- ] It will be found with a translation in Whitaker, vol. iv. p. 401. 2 Monsieur Nau, Mary's secretary."], [183, "1583. 159 JAMES VI. ness, in some honourable sort: she said she was dis eased and subject to many sicknesses, albeit, these many winters, she never was so well as she was this. She had a great heart which had preserved her, and desired now to be at rest, by the making of some good accord with her Majesty, her son, and herself.\" Beal then told Mary that, in his opinion, such an agreement or association as had been contemplated was not desired in Scotland, neither by the young King nor the nobility. \" For the nobility,\" said she, \"all that might hinder it are already gone. I have offended none of them which are now remaining; and therefore I doubt not but they will like thereof. These are principally to be doubted: Lindsay, Gowrie, Lochleven, Mar, and Angus. Lindsay is a hasty man, and was never thought to be of any great conduct or wit; and if he would do anything to the contrary, the way to win him was, to suffer him to have a few glorious words in the beginning, and afterwards he would be wrought well enough. In the association passed between her and her son,\" she said, \" all former offences done to her were pardoned ;\" adding, \" that whatsoever account her Majesty now maketh of Gowrie, his letters unto the Duke of Guise, sent by one Paul, which brought certain horses unto her son into Scotland, can declare that he will yield unto anything: she marvelleth how her Majesty dare trust him;\" and said, \"that because the Earl Morton did not, in a particular controversy that was between him and Lord Oliphant, do what he would, he was the cause of his death. * * There-"], [184, "1583. 160 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. fore,\" she said, \"there was no stability or trust in him. Lochleven hath (as she said) made his peace already. \u2014 Mar was her God-child, and, in her opinion, like to prove a coward and a naughty-natured boy. * * Angus had never offended her, and therefore she wished him no evil; but his sirname never had been friends to the Stewarts, and she knew7 the King her son loved him not. * * Touching her son,\" she ob served, \" that he was cunning enough not to declare himself openly, in respect of his surety and danger of his life, being in his enemies' hands; and what,\" said she, \"will you say if his own letters can be showed to that effect?\" * * On another occasion, some days later, she confirmed this ; observing, that, although James might appear to be satisfied with Gowrie and the rest, he only dissembled and waited his time, and must seek some foreign support if he did not embrace England, as he was too poor a King to stand alone against such a nobility; besides, Monsieur La Motte had told her he was well grown, and his marriage could not be delayed more than a year or two. \"His father was married when he was but nineteen years old, and the Duke of Lorrain when he was but six teen. * * As to herself, she was sure, (she said.) of a great party amongst the Scottish nobles, and had a hundred of their bands to maintain her cause, on the occurring of any good opportunity: yet she desired no ambitious estate, either in that country or this, but only her Majesty's favour, and liberty.\"1 1 MS.

Elizabeth, having thus elicited as much as possible from Mary, and even procured from the captive Prin cess some offers which might open the way to the recovery of her liberty, communicated all that had passed to Bowres, her Ambassador at the Scottish Court; and commanded him, in a secret interview with the young King, to sound his feelings regarding the restoration of his mother to liberty, and her association with himself in the government.1 The matter was to be managed with the utmost secrecy ; and the English Queen was so anxious to receive an instant answer, that Walsingham recommended Bowes to set a gallows upon the packet, as he had done on his own ; a significant hint sometimes given in those times to dilatory couriers.2 In all this, Elizabeth had no serious intention of either delivering her captive, or permitting her to be associated with her son: her wish was to defeat the whole scheme, bv making the young Prince jealous of his mother; and in this she appears to have succeeded. It is certain, at least, that in his secret interview with the English ambassador, James expressed himself with much suspicion and selfishness; and when Bowes showed him the paper containing Mary's offers to Elizabeth, he animadverted upon them with so much severity and acuteness, that, had the ambassador himself been the critic, we could scarcely have expected a more determined disapproval. Thus, in pointing to the eighth article, which related to their being jointly associated in the government, he 1 Minute, St. P. Off., 25th April, 1583. Walsingham to Bowes. 2 Ibid. VOL. VIII.

Besides, he observed, sundry obstacles might be found in the person of his mother. which might annoy both him and her. She was a Papist ; she had a Council resident in France, by whom she was directed ; she was so entangled with the Pope, and others her confederates, that she could not deliver herself from suspicion. In honour she could not abandon her friends in France; and as, in the person of Queen Mary, (alluding to Elizabeth's predecessor,) he said it was found, and seen to the world, that her own mild nature could not suppress the great cruelty of her Councillors, but that their desire prevailed to persecute and torment God's peo ple ; to overthrow the whole state and government established by King Edward the Sixth. * * So the Protestants and others in England, desiring a peaceable government and estate, might both doubt to find the like effects in the person of his mother, and be affrayed to come under the rule of a woman thus qualified. \u2014 These impediments and dangers, he added complacently, would not be found in his own condition, but rather an expectation of good parts, or qualities promising better contentment and satisfaction. He then, at Bowes' request, gave him the whole history of the correspondence between himself and the captive Queen ; expressed the deepest gratitude to Elizabeth"], [187, "1583. 163 JAMES VI. for this confidential communication; and concluded by assuring him, that, as he was convinced Mary preferred herself before him in this proposal, \u2014 till he saw much more clearly than he yet could, the bottom of the business, and her true meaning, he would go no far ther without communicating with the English Queen, and taking the advice of his Council ; whose opinion he could not now have, on account of the solemn pro mise of secrecy to Elizabeth.1 It is evident, through the whole of this negotiation, that James, if he expressed his real feelings, had a single eye to his own interest ; and cared little what became of his unfortunate mother, provided he secured an undivided sceptre in Scotland, and his succession to the English crown on Elizabeth's death. One only thing may be suggested in his defence: It is just possible that, in all this he dissembled, with the object of blinding Elizabeth and Bowes to his pur poses for the recovery of his liberty and the over throw of the English faction. But of this, the result will enable us more truly to judge. In the beginning of May, Menainville, having fully organized the plot for the overthrow of the Ruthven lords, and the return of the Duke of Lennox to power, took shipping from Leith for the Court of France : and so confidently did he express himself to his secret friends, that Bowes, who had a spy amongst them, told Walsingham he might look for a new world in 1 MS.

August.1 At the same time, the Scottish Ambassa dors, Colonel Stewart and Mr John Colvile, accom panied by Mr David Lindsay, one of the ministers of Edinburgh, who went at James's special request, repaired to London, where they were banqueted by Leicester, and soon admitted to an audience by Eliza beth. This Princess was, as usual, profuse in her professions and advice to her young cousin the King of Scots, but exceedingly parsimonious of her money.2 On the subject of his marriage, upon which he had solicited her advice, she promised to write herself; but referred all other points to her Council. It was urged by Colvile, in the strongest terms, that the King's person could not be deemed in safety, unless the Scottish Guard were increased. By this he meant, in plain language, that James could not be kept in captivity without a larger body of hired sol diers to hold the opposite faction in check. In them, to use the words of the Ambassadors, \" the life of the cause consisted.\"3 And yet Elizabeth could scarcely be prevailed on to advance the paltry sum of three hundred pounds, which she insisted Bowes must pay upon his own credit : and \" if,\" said Wal singham, when he sent him her commands in this matter, \" her Majesty should happen to lay the bur den upon you, I will not fail to see you myself dis- 1 MS.

He knew that the first object of his master the young King, was to strike the blow which should restore him to liberty : but this once secured, there remained the ulterior question, whether he should then \" run the French or the English course.\" And if the English Queen had been content to relieve James of the load of debt which overpowered him ; if she had frankly commu nicated with him on the succession, and given him her advice upon his marriage ; there was every proba bility that he would have continued at her devotion \u201e Only two days after the Scottish Ambassadors had left Court on their return, Bowes wrote from Edin burgh to Walsingham, that the Earls of Huntley, Athol, Montrose, and other barons, had met at Falk land ; that their \" purpose to welter2 the Court and State\" was no secret; and that nothing but a satis factory message from their royal mistress could save the English faction, and prevent a change of govern ment.3 Yet all this did not alter the resolution of the English Queen. It was in vain that the Ambas sadors remonstrated with Walsingham; that they reminded him of the promises made by the Queen to 1 MS. St. P. Off.

Bowes' advances to the English faction were discouraged ; and Walsingham bitterly complained, that even the wretched three hundred pounds, which he had given from his own pocket, would turn out to be a dead loss to the Ambassador, if he looked for pay ment to her Majesty, and not to himself. \" Thus, you see,\" said he, \" notwithstanding it importeth us greatly to yield all contentment to that nation, [Scot land,] how we stick at trifles ! I pray God we per form the rest of things promised.\"2 At this crisis, intelligence arrived of the death of the Duke of Lennox in France.3 He had been for some time in delicate health ; but the Scottish King had looked forward with confidence to his recovery, and his grief was extreme. His feelings became more poignant when he found the deep affection which his favourite had expressed towards himself on his death bed : enjoining his eldest son to carry his heart to his royal master in Scotland ; and dying, apparently, in 1 MS.

On the day of his death he addressed a letter to James, informing him that his recovery was hopeless ; and advising him to trust no longer to Angus, Mar, Lindsay, or Gowrie, whom he suspected as running the English faction; but to give his confidence to those whom he termed his own party. A blank, however, had been left for their names, and he expired before it was filled up. 1 This event threw an obstacle in the way of the immediate execution of that plot for his liberty, which the young King had been so long concert ino-, and from the success of which he had so fondly looked forward to the restoration of his favourite.2 Elizabeth seized this interval again to sound the mind of the King, and some of the leading men of her party in Scotland, regarding her recent negotia tions with the captive Queen for her restoration to liberty, and her intended \" association\" with her son. Both Prince and Council treated the idea with re pugnance. James observed to Bowes, that, although, as a dutiful son, he was ready to exert himself to procure the comfort and liberty of his mother, he was neither bound to this scheme of an \" association,\" as she had asserted, nor would he ever consent to it in the form which she had proposed. The Councillors were still more violently opposed to Mary on both points. The association, they said, had been proposed 1 MS. Calderwood, sol. 1 268, 1 269. Also MS. St. P.

Next day, John Colvile, who, with Colonel Stewart, had just returned from England, assured Walsingham \" that all things were quiet, and that the last work of God, in the Duke's departure, had increased the friendly disposi tion of the King.\"2 But the letters were still on their way to England, when all these flattering hopes were \u2022overthrown, and the Ambassador received the astound ing intelligence, that the King had thrown himself into the Castle of St Andrew's; that the gates of the place were kept by Colonel Stewart and his soldiers; ihat none of the nobility had been suffered to enter, but such as were privy to the plot ; and that the Earls of Crawford, Huntley, Argyle, and Marshal, were already with the monarch. On the heels of this news came a horseman in fiery speed from Mar to Angus ; and this Earl, the moment he heard of the movement, despatched a courier by night with his ring to Both well, urging him to gather his Borderers and join him instantly ; which he did. But the two barons were met, 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off. Bowes to Walsingham, 29th June, 1583, Edinburgh. 2 MS. Letter, St.P. Off., 25th June, 1583, Colvile to Walsingham."], [193, "169 1583.

They obeyed, rode on, saw James, and received his orders to return home and remain at their houses till he called for them.1 A few days showed that this sudden, though blood less revolution, was complete. The King was his own master, and owed his freedom to the ability with which he had organized the plot and blinded his adversaries.2 Gowrie, Mar, and Angus, the three lords who had led the faction of England, and kept him in durance, were in despair; but Gowrie, more politic thanhis associates, had secured a pardon for himself some time before the crisis.3 His colleagues in the triumvirate fled ; and to crown all, Arran, who, there is every reason to believe, had been privy to the whole, after a brief interval returned to Court, was embraced by the King, and soon resumed all his pride and ascendancy/ It was now nearly ten months since the Raid of Ruthven ; and as James had dissembled his feelings as long as he remained in the power of the leaders of that bold enterprise, the world looked not for any great severity against them.

A proclamation was set forth,1 which char acterized the enterprise at Ruthven as treason ; and whilst it assured his subjects, that all who acknow ledged their offence should experience the mercy of their prince, avowed his resolution to proceed vigor ously against the impenitent and refractory. At the same time, he published a declaration \" of the good and pleasant death in the Lord\" of his late dear cousin the Duke of Lennox ; informing his subjects that this nobleman had departed in the profession of the true Christian faith, established within his realm in the first year of his reign ; and denouncing penalties upon all who pretendedignoranceof thisfact, or dared to con tradict it, in speaking or in writing, in prose or rhyme.2 This public vindication of the memory and faith of his favourite, was intended to silence the ministers of the Kirk, who had deemed it their duty to cast out some injurious speeches against the Duke ; one of them affirming that, as he thirsted for blood in his lifetime, so he died in blood:3 an allusion to the disease of wb\u00e6efe he was reported to have fallen the 1 MS.

This harsh attack upon his favourite justly and deeply offended the King ; and Lawson, the author of the calumny, having been commanded to appear at Court, he, and a small company of his brother ministers, repaired to Dunfermline, and were carried into the presence chamber. Here, owing to the recent changes, they found themselves surrounded with the strantre faces of a new Court. Soon after the King entered, and, whilst they rose and made their obeisance, James, to their astonishment, took not the slightest notice, but passing the throne, which all ex pected he was to occupy, sat down familiarly upon a little coffer, and \" eyed them all marvellous gravely, and they him, for the space of a quarter of an hour ; none speaking a word ; to the admiration of all the beholders.\"1 The scene, intended to have been tragic and awful, was singularly comic: and this was increased when the monarch, without uttering a syllable, jumped up from his coffer and, \"glooming\" upon them, walked out of the room. It was nowdifficult to say what should be done. The ministers had come with a determination to remonstrate with their sovereign against the recent changes ; andhe, it was evident, enraged at their late con duct, had resolved to dismiss them unheard; but, whilst they debated in perplexity, he relented in the Cabinet, to which he had retired, and called them in.

His wit was of a homely and peculiar char acter. James, he said, ought to hear him, if any ; for he had demisted the Crown in his favour. Was he not Ferguson, the son of Fergus the first Scottish King ? and had he not cheerfully resigned his title to his Grace, as he was an honest man and had posses sion? \" Well,\" said James, \" no other King in Europe would have borne at your hands what I have.\" \u2014 \" God forbid you should be like other European Kings ! \" was the reply; \"what are they but murderers of the saints ? \u2014 ye have had another sort of upbringing : but beware whom you choose to be about you ; for, help less as ye were in your cradle, you are in deeper danger now.\" \u2014 \" I am a Catholic King,\" replied the monarch, \" and may choose my own advisers.\" The word Catholic was more than some of the ministers could digest, and would have led to an angry alterca tion, had not Ferguson again adroitly allayed their excited feelings. \" Yes, brethren,\" said he, turning to them, \" he is a Catholic; that is, a universal King; and may choose his company as King David did, in the hundred andfirstpsalm.\" This was a master-stroke; for the King had very recently translated this psalm into"], [197, "1583. 173 JAMES VI.

They then again warned him against his present Councillors; and one of the ministers, stooping down, had the boldness to whisper in his ear, that there was no great wisdom in keepinghisfather'smurderers, or their posterity, so near his person. Their last words were stern and solemn. \" Think not lightly, Sir,\" said they, \" of our commis sion ; and look well that your deeds agree with your promises, for we must damn sin in whoever it be found : nor is that face upon flesh that we may spare, in case we find rebellion to our God, whose ambassadors we are. Disregard not our threatening; for there was never one yet in this realm, in the place where your Grace is, who prospered after the ministers began to threaten him.\" At this, the king was observed to smile, probably ironically, but he said nothing ; and, as they took their leave, he laid his hand familiarly on each. Colonel Stewart then made them drink, and thev left the Court.1 I have given this interview at some length, as it is strikingly characteristic both of the Prince and the ministers of the Kirk.

Dur ing this interval, all was vigour upon the part of the King and Arran, whilst despondency and suspicion paralyzed and divided their opponents. Angus, the head of the house of Douglas, and one of the most powerful noblemen in the country, was banished beyond Spey;1 Mar and Glammis were ordered to leave the country;2 the Laird of Lochleven was imprisoned, and commanded to deliver his houses to Rothes ; Lord Boyd and Colvil of Easter Wemyss retired to France ; whilst, on the other hand, the friends of the Queen-mother, and those who had been all along attached to the interests of France, saw themselves daily increasing in favour and promoted to power. Those officers of the King's household, who were sus pected of being favourable to England, were removed, to make way for others of the opposite party. It was observed that James had given a long secret confer ence to young Gr\u00e6me of Fintry, a devoted Catholic. lately come from France, with letters (as Bowes be lieved) from the Duke of Guise.3 It was even noted. that a present of apples and almonds had been sent from Menainville to the King : a token concerted to show that all was ripe for the completion of the plot which he had devised when last in Scotland.4 In 1 Spottiswood, p. 326. 2 MS.

Amid these scenes of daily proscriptions and royal hypocrisy, the veteran statesman, Sir Francis Wal singham, arrived at the Scottish Court.1 His instruc tions directed him to require satisfaction from the King regarding the late strange actions which had taken place, so inconsistent with his friendly profes sions to his royal mistress; he was to use every effort to persuade James to reform the accident, which the Queen was ready to impute rather to evil counsel than to his own wishes ; and to assure him that, if he consented to alter this new course, he should not fail to taste of her goodness.2 But it required a very brief observation to convince Walsingham that his mission was too late. He found himself treated with coldness. His audience was unnecessarily de layed ; and wrhen at last admitted, the young King was in no compliant mood, although he received him with much apparent courtesy.3 To his com- 1 MS. Letter, St. P.

Before this, two or three lords had usurped the government; they had engaged in dangerous courses, and had brought their ruin upon themselves. Walsingham then at tempted to point out the mischief that must arise from displacing those councillors who were best affected to Elizabeth ; but James sharply, and \"with a kind of jollity,\" (so wrote the old statesman to his royal mistress,) reminded him that he was an absolute King ; that he would take such order with his sub jects as best liked himself;1 and that he thought his mistress should be no more curiousto examine the affec tions of his council than he was of hers. \" And yet,\" said Walsingham, \" you are but a young Prince yet, and of no great judgment in matters of government ; and many an elder one would think himself fortunate to meet an adviser like my mistress. But be assured. she is quite ready to leave you to your own guid ance : I have not come down to seek an alliance for England, which can live well enough without Scot land, but to charge your Majesty with unkind dealing to her Highness, and to seek redress for past errors.\"2 The Ambassador then complained of some' late out rages which had been committed by the Scots upon 1 MS.

JAMES VI. the Borders ; and the King having promised inquiry, and requested to see him next day in private, he took his leave. This secret conference, however, does not appear to have taken place. The probability is, that Arran, who carried himself towards Walsingham with great pride, had prevented it ; and, having bid adieu to the King, the English Secretary wrote to Burghley in these ominous terms : * * * \u00ab You will easily find that there is no hope of the recovery of this young- Prince ; who, I doubt, (having many reasons to lead me so to judge,) if his power may agree to his will, will become a dangerous enemy. * * * There is no one thing will serve better to bridle him, than for her Majesty to use the Hamiltons in such sort as they may be at her devotion.\"1 This last hint, of the use which might be made of Lord John and Lord Claud Hamilton, the sons of the late Duke of Chastelherault, who had been long in banishment, and now lived in England, was acted uponby Bowes; andbrief ashad beenthisAmbassador's stay in Scotland, he had found time to sow the seeds of a counter-revolution, by which he trusted to over whelm Arran, and place the King's person once more in the power of the friends of Elizabeth. By his advice, Bowes bribed some of the leading nobles ; and in less than a week after Walsingham's departure, his busy agent wrote to him that the good course, begun by him in that realm, was prosperous ; that he had met with many of the persons appointed, who 1 MS.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. promised to do what was committed to them ; and that already the well-affected were in comfort, and their adversaries in fear.1 This new plot Walsingham communicated to Eliza beth in a letter which has unfortunately disappeared, but to which he thus alluded in writing to Burghley from Durham, on his journey back to the English Court : \" There is an offer made to remove the ill affected from about the King, which I have sent to her Majesty. They require speedy answer : and that the matter may be used with all secrecy, I beseech your Lordship, therefore, that when her Majesty shall make you privy thereunto, you will hasten the one and advise the other.\"2 * * * Arran's quick eye, how ever, had detected these machinations : orders were given to double the royal guards, the strictest watch was kept at Court ;3 and although a body of forty horse were observed one night to hover round Falkland, and all dreaded an attack, the alarm passed away. The \"Bye course\" (the name given to the projected conspiracy) was thus abandoned ; and Elizabeth, who was dissatisfied with Walsingham's ill success, determined to reserve her judgment on the Scottish affairs, and recalled Bowes from Scotland.4 1 MS.

This coldness in the English Queen completely discouraged the opponents of the late revolution ; and before the end of the year, the King and Arran had triumphed over every difficulty. Angus, Mar, and Glammis, the Lairds of Lochleven and Cleish, the Abbots of Dunfermline and Cambuskenneth, with others who had acted in concert with Gowrie, were compelled to acknowledge their offences and sue for mercy ; whilst a Convention was held at Edinburgh, in which the good sense and moderation of the King were conspicuous, in restoring something of confidence and peace even to the troubled elements of the Kirk.1 Considering the difficulty of this task, it gives us no mean idea of James's powers at this early age ; wheii we find him succeeding in taming the fiery and almost indomitable spirits of one party of the ministers, and reconciling to his present policy the more placable division of the Presbyterians. The great subject of contention between the Court and the Scottish clergy was the outrage committed at Ruthven ; a transac tion which had received the solemn sanction of the Kirk, but which the Prince, however, compelled to disguise his sentiments at the time, justly considered rebellion. On this point James was firm. He had recently made every effort to bring the offenders to a confession of their crime ; and had appointed some Commissioners, chosen from the ministers and the elders of the Kirk, to confer with them upon the subject.2 But this gentle measure not producing all J MS.

Angus retired be yond Spey ; the Earl of Mar, the Master of Glam mis, with the Abbots of Dryburgh and Cambusken neth, repaired to Ireland ; Lord Boyd, with the Lairds of Lochleven and Easter Wemyss, passed into France ;* and other of their associates were imprison ed, or warded within the strictest bounds. Mr John Colvile alone, who had been as deeply implicated as them all, refusing submission, fled to Berwick ; F whilst Gowrie, who had already obtained pardon, reiterated his vows of obedience, and remained at Court.3 It was impossible, however, wholly to sub due the Kirk. Mr John Durie, one of the ministers, 1 MS. Act, St. P. Off, Dec. 7, 1583. 2 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Bowes ' to Walsingham.

But Durie was compelled, by threats of having his head set upon the West Port, one of the public gates of the city, to make a qualified retractation;1 and Melvil only saved himself from imprisonment by a precipitate flight to Berwick.2 He was a man of great learning, but fierce and reckless temper ; who had been educated at Geneva; a strict Puritan in religion, and a Republican in politics. When called before the Council, he resolutely declined their juris diction, \u2014 affirming, that he was amenable only to the Presbytery for anything delivered in the pulpit ; and when the King attempted to convince him of the contrary, he arrogantly told him, that \" he perverted the laAvs both of God and man.\" The removal of so stern an opponent was peculiarly grateful to the Court ; and as James had assured the Commissioners of the Kirk, that he was determined to maintain the Reformed religion, and to lay before his Council the remedies they recommended for restoring tranquillity to the country, it was anxiously hoped that the dis tracted and bleeding State might be suffered to enjoy some little interval of repose.3 During these transactions, the young Duke of Lennox disembarked at Leith from France. He was 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off., Bowes to Walsingham, Dec. 29, 1583. 2 Spottiswood, p. 330. 3 MS. Letter, St. P.

On coming ashore, they were met by Arran and Huntley, and carried to Kinneil, where the Court then lay. James received the son of his old favourite with the utmost joy ; restored him to his father's honours and estates ; and, as he was then only thir teen, committed him to the government of the Earl of Montrose.1 It was now expected that a period of order and quiet would succeed the banishment of the disaffected lords ; for although the counsels of Arran were violent, there was a wiser and more moderate party in the King's confidence, which checked, for a little while, his rashness and lust of undivided power. To this class belonged the celebrated Sir James Melvil, with his brother Sir Robert, and some of the more temperate spirits in the Kirk. One of these, Mr David Lindsay, accounted amongst the best of the brethren, addressed a letter, at this time, to Bowes, the late Ambassador, in which he spoke in high terms of the young King. 1 MS.

The chief conspirators were the banished noblemen, Angus, Mar, the Master of Glammis, the Earl of Bothwell, Lord Lindsay, and their associates. Of these, Mar and Glammis passed over secretly from their retreat in Ireland ; Angus left his refuge in the north ; the two sons of the Duke of Chastelherault, Lord Claud and Lord John Hamilton, were sent down by Eliza beth from England to the Borders; whilst Gowrie, who, to cover his purposes of treason, had sought and obtained the King's license to visit the continent, lingered in Scotland to arrange the plan of the insur rection.1 In England, the great agent in communi cating with Walsingham and Bowes, was that same Mr John Colvile with whom we are already acquaint ed ; and his letters, as wTell as those which yet remain of Bowes and Walsingham, admit us into the secrets of the conspiracy, and distinctly show the approval of the English Queen and her ministers. Gowrie, as it appears, had hesitated for some time between sub mitting to the King and embarking in the plot : but Bowes wrote to Walsingham, (on the 4th March, 1583-4,) that he had abandoned all thoughts of con cession, and stood faithful to his friends. He added, that the ground and manner of the purpose was 1 MS. St. P. Off, Bowes to Walsingham, 20th Jan., 1583-4.

Some delay, however, took place, regarding the course to be pursued with a certain Bishop, who was considered too powerful an antagonist to be continued in power ; and Colvile, who managed the plot in Lon don, had a secret meeting with Walsingham on this delicate point ; after which, he wrote to him in these words : \" Concerning the Bishop, the more I think of the matter, the more necessity I think it, that he, and all other strangers of his opinion, were removed ; for it is a common proverb, Hostes si intus sint, frustra clauduntur fores ; nequc antcquam CJ'pettantur tute cubandum est.1 But although Bowes, Walsingham, and Colvile, were no mean adepts in planning an insurrection, they had to compete with an antagonist in Arran, who detected and defeated all their machinations. His eyes were in every quar ter : not a movement taken by Gowrie, or Mar, or Glammis, escaped him. He was aware that a Band had been drawn up, and signed by many of his ene mies in Scotland, by which they solemnly engaged to assassinate him, and compel the King to admit them to his councils.2 He had received information that, in the end of March, a general assembly of the nobles, who trusted to overturn the Government, would be held at St Johnston.

When the meeting accordingly did take place, and the insurgent noblemen called upon all who were solicitous for the advancement of the Word of God, and the setting forth of his glory, to join their ban ner, their appeal found no response in the hearts of the people ; and the assembly fell to pieces without striking a blow.1 This premature movement, and its ill success, inti midated the conspirators, and gave new courage to Arran and the King, who sent a secret messenger to Elizabeth, offering the most favourable terms of ac commodation, and assuring her, that in supporting Gowrie and his friends, she was the dupe of some dangerous and unquiet spirits, whose purposes varied every month, and who were, not even true to each other.2 The Queen hesitated. Colvile had recently received from his brother the Laird of Cleish, one of the conspirators, certain articles of agreement be tween them and the English Queen, which they ex pected to be signed. These he was to correct and present to Elizabeth. But this Princess was in a 1 MS. Letter, Brit. Mus. Caligula, C. viii. sol. 5, Bowes to Walsingham, 10th April, 1584, Berwick.

If she signed the articles, she bound her self to the faction ; and should they be discomfited, she furnished evidence of her encouraging rebellion in subjects ; an accusation which Arran and his friends would not be slow to use. On the other hand, Colvile maintained that the late failure at St Johnston was to be ascribed to the folly and impa tience of some of their friends ; and that now all was ready for the outbreak and success of the great plot. Gowrie was at Dundee, waiting only for the signal from his fellow-conspirators. Angus, Mar, and Glammis, were ready to rise and march upon Stir ling. If they succeeded, the power, probably the life of Arran, was at an end ; a new order of things must be established in Scotland ; and the men whom she had just deserted, would be in possession once more of the person of the young King, and rule all. At this crisis, this busy partisan, Colvile, exerted him self to the utmost. He found that the English Queen, whilst she verbally gave her warm approval to the insurgents, \" expressing her gracious and motherly care of the well-doing of the noblemen,\" steadily re fused either to sign their articles, or to receive any messenger from them, till they were openly in arms. He implored them to be contented with these general assurances ; and declared, that immediate action, without sending any further advertisements to Eng- land, could alone secure success. The examples by which he confirmed this argument were the murder of Riccio, the seizure of Queen Mary at Faside, and the recent \" Raid of Ruthven.\""], [212, "1584. 188 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. \" If,\" said he, \" advertisements had been sent to England before the execution of Davie, the taking of the Queen at Faside, and of Arran at Ruthven, I think none of these good actions had ever been effec tuate. But you know, that after all these enterprises were execute, her Majesty ever comforted the enter prisers thereof in all lawful manner, albeit, she was not made privy to their intentions. Chiefly after the late attempt at Ruthven, it is fresh remembrance how timeously Sir George Carey and Mr Robert Bowes, her Majesty's Ambassadors, arrived to countenance the said cause. But now, when men does nothing but sit down to advise when it is high time to draw sword and defend, and will lie still in the mire un stirring, and expecting till some friend, passing by, shall pull them out, it appears well that they either diffide in the equity of their cause, or else are be witched, and so useless, and that they can feel nothing till they be led to the shambles, as was the poor Earl of Morton.1 If (he proceeded) matters were resolutely ordered, what more consultation is needed, (seeing religion, the King's honour, and all good men is in extreme danger ;) but first courageously, such as are agreed, to join together in secret manner for the King's deliverance, as was done at Ruthven ; or if this cannot be, then to convene at some convenient place openly, publish proclamation to the people for declaration of their lawful and just cause, and so 1 MS.

Arran, who was informed of every particular, had quietly suffered the plot to proceed to the very instant of its execution. Having secretly instructed his own friends to be ready with their forces at an instant's warning, he did not move a step till his adversaries were in the field ; and, by an overt act, had fixed upon themselves the crime of rebellion. The moment this was ascer tained, and when he knew that Gowrie only waited at Dundee for a signal to join his friends, who were advancing upon Stirling, he despatched Colonel Stewart to arrest him ; who, with a hundred troopers, coming suddenly to that town before sunrise, sur rounded his castle. It was difficult, however, in these times of feudal misrule and hourly danger, to find a Scottish baron unprepared ; and the earl bravely held his house against all assailants for twelve hours. But he was at last overpowered, seized, and carried a prisoner to Edinburgh.2 At the same moment that these scenes were acting at Dundee, word had been brought to the Court, that the Earls of Mar and Angus, with the Master of Glammis, and five hun- 1 MS.

These mighty exertions, however, were superfluous. The insur gent lords did not dare to keep together in the face of such a force ; and leaving a small garrison in the castle of Stirling, fled precipitately through East Teviotdale into England, and solicited the protection of Elizabeth.2 As they passed Kelso in the night. Bothwell, their old friend, met them, and held a secret conference ; but as such a meeting with traitors might have cost him his head, they agreed that at daybreak he should chase them across the Border: which he did, acting his part, in this counterfeit pur suit, with much apparent heat and fury.3 James then took possession of Stirling ; the castle surren dered on the first summons ; four of the garrison. including the captain, were hanged ; Archibald Dou glas, called the constable, was also executed ; and it 1 MS.

Of these, three, Mr Andrew Hay, Mr James Lawson, and Mr Walter Balcanquel, were sum moned to Court ; and two in particular, Galloway, minister of Perth, and Carmichael, minister of Had dington, were searched for at their houses by the King's Guard, but could not be found. They afterwards, with Polwart, Subdean of Glasgow, John Davison, minister of Libberton, and the noted Andrew Melvil, fled to England.2 In the meantime, it was determined to bring Gowrie to trial. Of his guilt, there was not the slightest doubt. He had been a chief contriver of the plot, and the most active agent in its organization : but there was some want of direct evidence ; and a base device, though common in the criminal proceedings of these times, was adopted to supply it. The Earl of Arran, attended by Sir Robert Melvil, and some others of the Privy-councillors, whose names do not appear, visited him in prison ; and professing great concern for his safety, informed him that the King was deeply incensed against him, believing that he had the chief hand in expelling his favourite, the 1 MS.

Gowrie declared, that his part in the disgrace of the Duke was not deeper than that of his associates ; but anxiously besought them, as old friends, to sue to the King for a favourable sentence. They replied, that to become intercessors for him in the present state of James's feelings, would only ruin themselves, and not serve him. \" What, then,\" said he, \"is to be done?\" \"Our advice,\" said they, \"is, that you write a general letter to the King, confess ing your knowledge of a design against his Majesty's person ; and offering to reveal the particulars, if admitted to an audience. This will procure you an interview, which otherwise you have no chance of obtaining. You may then vindicate your innocence, and explain the whole to the King.\" \" It is a peri lous expedient,\" answered Gowrie. \" I never enter tained a thought against the King; but this is to frame my own dittay,1 and may involve me in utter ruin.\" \"How so?\" said his crafty friends : \"your life is safe if you follow our counsel ; your death is determined on if you make no confession.\" \" Goes it so hard with me?\" was Gowrie's reply. \"If there be no remedy, in case I had an assured promise of my life, I would not stick to try the device of the letter.\" \" I will willingly pledge my honour,\" said Arran, \" that your life shall be in no danger, and that no advantage shall be taken of your pretended confes sion.\"2 Thus entrapped, the unfortunate man wrote 1 Dittay, accusation. 2 MS.

At this moment, the Jury returned and declared him guilty, \u2014 a sentence which he received with much firmness, and instantly rose to speak ; but the Judge interrupted him, telling him that his time was short, as the King had already sent down the warrant for his execution. \" Well, my lord,\" said he, \" since it is the King's content ment that I lose my life, I am as willing to part with it as I was before to spend it in his service ; and the noblemen, who have been upon my Jury, will know the matter better hereafter. And yet, in con demning me, they have hazarded their own souls, for I had their promise. God grant my blood be not on the King's head ! And now, my lords,\" continued the unfortunate man, \" let me say a word for my poor sons. Let not my estates be forfeited. The matters are small for which I suffer. Failing my eldest boy, then, let my second succeed him.\" It was answered, he was found guilty of treason, and, by law, forfeiture must follow. The last scene of the tragedy was brief. He was allowed to retire for a few moments, with a minister, to his private devo tions. He then walked out upon the scaffold, asserted his innocence of all designs against the King's per son, to the people who were assembled ; repeated the account of the base artifice to which he had fallen a victim ; and turning to Sir Robert Melvil, who stood beside him, begged him to satisfy the headsman for"], [219, "1584. 195 JAMES VI. his clothes, as he had left the dress in which he died to his page. The Justice-clerk then assisted him to undo his doublet, and bare his neck ; Gowrie him self tied the handkerchief over his eyes, and kneeling down, \" smilingly,\" as it was remarked by an eye witness, rested his head upon the block. It was then severed from the body by a single blow ; and his three friends, Sir R. Melvil, the Justice-clerk, and Stewart of Traquair, wrapping the remains in the scarlet cloth which he had himself directed to be the covering of the scaffold, had them buried, after the head had been sewed on to the body.1 Gowrie died firmly, penitently, and, it is be hoped, sincerely ; but even in this dark age of unscrupulous crime and aristocratic ambition, few men had more need of repentance. His early age was stained with the blood of the unfortunate Riccio ; he and his father being two of the principal assassins. In his maturer years, he accompanied Lindsay in that harsh and brutal interview with Mary, when they compelled her, in her prison at Lochleven, to sign the abdica- 1 MS. Brit. Mus.

It is difficult to reconcile the con duct of Sir Robert Melvil to Gowrie, as described by Davison, with this sentence in the above account : \" He was buried by his three friends, Sir Robert Melvil, the Justice-clerk, and Sir Robert Stewart of Traquair ;\" and we find, from the same source, that, on the scaffold, Gowrie turned to Melvil, with a last request, as if intrusting it to his dearest friend.

Since that time, his life had been one continued career of public faction ; his character was stained by a keen appetite for private revenge;1 and, although all must reprobate the base contrivances resorted to, to procure evidence against him on his trial, it is certain that, in common with Mar, Angus, and Glammis, he had engaged in a conspiracy to overturn the government.2 It is singular to find, that a man thus marked so deeply with the features of a cruel age, should have com bined with these considerable cultivation and refine ment. He was a scholar, fond of the fine arts, a patron of music and architecture, and affected mag nificence in his personal habits and mode of living. Common report accused him of being addicted to the occult sciences ; and, on his trial, one of the articles against him was his having consulted a witch: but this he treated with deep and apparently sincere ridicule. 1 \" Quant au Compte de Gourie il resemble toujours a luy mesme, collere et vindicatif et sur lequel peult plus la souvenance d'une injure passee, que toute aultre prevoiance de l'avenir.\" \u2014 Menainville to Mauvissiere, 28th March, 1583.

The death of Gowrie, and the flight of his fellow conspirators, left Arran in possession of the supreme power in Scotland, and filled Elizabeth and her min isters with extreme alarm. They knew his unbounded ambition ; they were aware of the influence which he possessed over the character of the young King : his former career had convinced them that his talents were quite equal to his opportunities. He combined military experience, and the promptitude and deci sion which a soldier of fortune so often acquires, with a genius for state affairs, and a ready eloquence, in which all could see the traces of a learned education. To this was added a noble presence and figure, with commanding manners, which awed or conciliated, as he pleased, those whom he employed as the tools of his greatness. Elizabeth suspected, also, and on good grounds, that although he professed a great regard for the reformed religion \u2014 declaring his fears"], [222, "1584. 198 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. lest the faction of the Queen-mother should regain its influence in Scotland, and seduce the mind of the young monarch from the truth \u2014 still these assevera tions were rather politic than sincere. For their truth, she and her councillors had no guarantee : and looking to the profligacy of his private life, his bitter opposition to the Presbyterian clergy, and his con stant craving after forfeitures and power, they con jectured that his alleged devotion to England, and desire to continue the amity, was rather a contrivance to gain time till he looked about him, than any more permanent principle of action. All this was embarrassing to the English Queen and her ministers : and there were other difficulties in the way of their recovery of influence in Scotland, to which it was impossible to shut their eyes. They had trusted that the late conspiracy, if successful, would restore Lord Arbroath and Lord Claud Ha milton, to their ancient authority and estates ; and that their union with the Earl of Angus, wTho wielded the immense power of the house of Douglas, would enable them to crush Arran, and destroy the French faction in Scotland. But Arran was now triumph ant ; and his enmity to the houses of Douglas and Hamilton was deep and deadly. Their restoration, he well knew, must have been his utter ruin. He had brought the Regent Morton to the scaffold ; he had possessed himself of the title and estates of the un fortunate Earl of Arran ; and as long as he continued in power, Elizabeth foresaw that the exiles would never be permitted to return. She had difficulties,"], [223, "1584. 199 JAMES VI. also, with the faction of the Kirk. They had hitherto been encouraged by England ; and had been em ployed by Burghley and Walsingham, as powerful opponents of the French faction, and the intrigues of the Queen-mother. But Elizabeth had herself no sympathies for the Presbyterian form of Church government : she had often blamed the factious and Republican principles disseminated by its ministers ; and now, when the party of the Kirk were no longer dominant, she felt disposed to regard them with cold ness and distrust.1 On the other hand, the young King had avowed his determined enmity to Rome ; whilst his opposition was simply to Presbytery as contrasted with Episcopacy. He had formed a reso lution to maintain, the Episcopal form of government which had been established in Scotland, at all risks, against the attack of its enemies. He was assisted in this great design by Arran, a man not easily shaken in his purposes ; and by Adamson Bishop of St An drew's, whose abilities were of a high order, both as a divine and a scholar : and now that Gowrie was gone, and the other great leaders of the Kirk in exile, there was every probability that James would suc ceed in his object. It became, therefore, a question with Elizabeth, whether she might not gain more b}r encouraging the advances of Arran, than she would lose by withdrawing her support from the exiled lords. Such being her feelings, she resolved to be in no 1 MS. Letter, St. P.

When the con spiracy broke out, Mr Davison had been on his road thither ; but he was arrested, on his journey, at Ber wick, by letters from Walsingham i1 and when the French Ambassador, who was resident at the Eng lish Court, requested the Queen's permission to repair to Scotland and act as a mediator between the fac tions, Elizabeth readily consented.2 She was the more inclined to choose this moderate course, as the King of France had recently offered to engage in a strict league with England. He had declared his earnest desire to see the three crowns united in per fect amity, and his wishes that the afflicted state of Scotland should be restored to quiet : wdiilst he had instructed his x\\mbassador to visit the captive Queen of Scots ; to exert himself to the utmost to mitigate the rigour of her confinement, and, if possible, to pro cure her restoration to liberty.3 In the meantime, Arran and the King, although they professed a firm resolution to maintain pacific relations with England, adopted energetic mea sures to secure their triumph and complete the xuin of their enemies.

It was made treason to decline his judgment, and that of his Council, in any matter what soever; the jurisdiction of any Court, spiritual or temporal, which was uot sanctioned by his Highness and the three Estates, was discharged ; and no persons, of whatever function or quality, were to presume, under severe penalties, to utter any slanderous speeches against the majesty of the throne, or the wisdom of the Council ; or to criticise, in sermons, declamations, or'private conferences, their conduct and proceedings.2 All ecclesiastical assemblies, general or provincial, were prohibited from convening; and the whole spiritual jurisdiction was declared to be resident in the bishops : the sentence of excommunication pro nounced against Montgomery was abrogated ; and a commission granted to the Bishop of St Andrew's, for the reformation of the University of St Andrew's: 1 MS.

Such severity, however, did not intimidate his brethren ; and when the recent acts against the Kirk were proclaimed at the Cross, on the Sunday after the rise of the Parliament, Robert Pont and Balcanquel, two of the ministers of the capital, openly protested against them. Having satis fied their conscience, and warned their flock against obedience, they deemed it proper to provide for their own safety ; and fled in the night, followed hard by some of the King's guard, who had orders to arrest 1 MS.

They escaped, however, and entered Berwick by day-break.1 Elizabeth now ordered Davison to proceed to Scot land, and the young King despatched the celebrated Sir James Melvil, who was then much in his con fidence, to meet him on the Borders. Melvil's com mission was to sound the Ambassador's mind before he received audience ; and after their meeting he despatched a letter to his brother, Sir Robert Melvil, in which he gave a minute and graphic account of their conversation, as they rode together towards the Court. Davison he described as all smiles and gentleness, full of thanks for the noble train which had met him on the Marches, and earnest in his hopes that he might prove a more happy instrument of amity than his diplomatic predecessors, Randolph and Bowes. Sir James's reply was politely worded, but significant and severe. He had little doubt, he said, that the intentions of the Queen of England were sincere ; her offers assuredly were fair, and the rebellion of subjects against their Prince could not but be hateful to her ; and yet the proceedings of her councillors and ministers appeared far otherwise to clear-sighted men. As for the King his master, he was now a man both in wit and per sonage, and acute enough to look more to deeds than words. It is the custom (continued Melvil) of some countries to hold their neighbours in civil discord, and send Ambassadors to and fro to kindle the fire under colour of concord. \u2014 No words could more plainly point out the recent proceedings of Elizabeth; but Sir James was too much of a courtier not to avoid the 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off., Davison to Walsingham, May 27, 1 584."], [228, "1584. 204 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. direct application. He utterly disclaimed having that opinion of her Majesty, or of the Ambassador himself, that many had of some Counsellors and Ambassadors ; but he assured him, unless her Majesty proceeded otherwise with the King than she had done yet, matterswere able1 [likely ] to fall out toiler unmendable miscontentment. I would not speak of auld 2 done deeds, said he, pursuing the attack ; but now lately, when Mr Walsingham was sent, his Majesty was in good hope of a strait amity to be packed in respect of his own earnest inclination and the quality of him that was sent, and could find nothing but an appear ance of changement of mind in him, either upon some new occasion, or by the persuasion of some other party ; and, nevertheless, his Majesty dealt favour ably and familiarly with him, and showed favour unto sundry that wTere suspected, at his request, and kept straitly some speeches that were between them; albeit, afterwards Master Bowes alleged the contrary, in such sort, that sundry thought it were done to pick a quarrel. And, wdtereas, (continued Melvil, alluding to the late conspiracy of Gowrie,) his Ma jesty was mercifully inclined to all his subjects, \u2014 both they with some of England and some of England with them had practised, whereof her Majesty had some forewarning, \u2014 yet, they drew to plain rebellion by them that came het-fut3 out of England and Ire land, and were now returned and treated there again; and, then, you will say the Queen loves his Majesty 1 \" Able\" is the word in the original.

What is this but mockery?1 \u2014 This was a home thrust, which Davison, wdio knew its truth, could not easily parry ; nor was he more comfortable when Sir James alluded to the conduct of the Kirk, and the state of religion. Lord Burghley himself, said Melvil, when in Scotland at the time of the siege of Leith, had been scandalized at the proceedings of the ministers, and gave plain counsel to put order to them, or else they would subvert the whole Estate ; and yet now, said he, they are again crying out against the King's Highness, whose life and conversation is better reformed, and more godly, than their own. He then detailed to him more particularly, as they rode along, the \" slanderous practices of some of these busy factioners ;\" and ended with this advice : Mr Ambassador, \u2014 If the Queen require friendship, she must like the King's friends ; she must hate his enemies ; and either deliver them into his hands, or chase them forth of her country, as she did at his Majesty's mother's desire, after the slaughter of Davy. Your mistress need not dread the King ; be is young, far more bent on honest pastime than on great handling of countries; and, unless compelled by such doings as have been carried on lately, he will keep this mind for many years yet. He is young enough (this was a glance at the succession to Elizabeth) to abide upon anything God has provided for him.2 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Sir James Melvil to my Lord of Pittenweem, or Sir Robert Melvil of Karny. 5 Id. Ibid."], [230, "206 1584. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. The two friends, by this time, had reached Mel vil's country seat, from which they rode to the Court at Falkland ; and Davison was admitted to his au dience. He found the young Duke of Lennox, and the Earls of Arran, Huntley, Montrose, and other nobles, around the King, who received his letters with courtesy; but expressed himself in passionate terms against the rebellious nobles, whom, he said, he expected Elizabeth to deliver into his hands. To this, Davison replied, that no one could be more ten der of his estate and preservation than his mistress. As to the noblemen whom he termed rebels, she was as yet utterly ignorant of the true circumstances of the late alteration, (by this mild term she alluded to Gowrie's treason ;) but she had always regarded these nobles as men who had hazarded their lives in his service ; nor could she now deliver them without blemish to her honour. Did his Majesty forget, that he had himself blamed Morton for the delivery of Northumberland in his minority; and had recently refused to give up Holt the Jesuit, who had been concealed in Scotland, and was a notorious intriguer against her Majesty's Government? Besides, she had good cause of offence from the late conduct of Livingston, his servant, whom he had sent up to re quire the delivery of Angus and his friends. This man had spread reports injurious to her honour: he had asserted that Gowrie had written a letter, in prison, accusing Elizabeth of a plot against the life both of Mary and the young King. The whole was a foul and false slander ; and she knew well the strata-"], [231, "1584. 207 JAMES VI. gems which had been used to procure such a letter : but she did, indeed, think it strange that the King himself should credit such stories of one whose life and government had been as innocent and unspotted as hers, and who had shown such care of himself, and sisterly affection to his mother.1 For the banished noblemen, she should take good care they should create no trouble to his kingdom. To all this James answered, with a spirit and readiness for which Davison was not prepared, that for this last assurance there was not much necessity. He could look, he hoped, well enough himself to the defence of his kingdom against such rebels as she now thought good to protect. The case of Holt, he said, was not parallel. He was a mean and single subject: they were noblemen of great houses and alliance. For Gowrie's letter, it was true such a letter had been written; but its terms were so general, as to touch neither her Majesty, nor any other persons in particular : nor was the accusation ever substantiated by proof. Her Majesty's honour, therefore, was un blemished. James then turned to lighter subjects, talked of his hunting and pastimes, and handed the Ambassador over to Montrose, with whom he dined.2 A few days' observation convinced Davison that James felt as deeply as he had expressed himself; and that, although Arran's power was great, the King's inclinations seconded, if theydid not originate, all those 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, 10th June, 1584, Davison to Wal singham. s Id. Ibid."], [232, "1584. 208 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. severe measures which were now adopted against the banished nobles and the ministers. Nothing was heard of, from day to day, but prosecutions, arrests, forfeitures, and imprisonments ; whilst Arran, and the nobles and barons who had joined his party, exultingly divided the spoil. The immense estates of the family of Douglas were eagerly sought after : and Davison, in a letter to Walsingham, conveyed a striking picture of the general scramble, \" with the misery 'and confusion of the country.\" The proceed ings of this Court, said he, are thought so extreme and intolerable, as have not only bred a common hatred and mislike of the instruments, but also a decay of the love and devotion of the subjects to his Majesty. * * The want of their ministers exiled ; the imprisonment of Mr David Lindsay in the Black ness ; and the warding of Mr Andrew Hay in the north, who refused to subscribe their late acts of Parliament, do not a little increase the murmur and grudging of the people ; besides, the lack of the ordi nary ministry here, which is now only supplied by Mr John Craig and Mr John Brand, at such times as they may be spared from their own charges. The King is exceedingly offended with such of them as are fled, blaming them to have withdrawn themselves without cause, notwithstanding some of their friends were already in hands, and warrant given forth for their own charging and apprehending before their departure. Immediately upon their returning, (he continued,) the Bishop of Glasgow, and Fintryvan other excommunicate, came to this town, and were"], [233, "1584. 209 JAMES VI. absolved jure politico from the sentence of excommu- nication, and now have liberty and access to the Court. * * The prisoners are all yet unrelieved of their wards, save Lindsay and Mr William Lesly, who, by the great suit of the Laird and Lady John- ston, hath obtained his life.

The association, concluded already, or on the point of being concluded, between them, by which Mary was to resign the kingdom to her son ; the late re volution at St Andrew's; the execution, exile, or imprisonment of all who had been constant in reli gion ; the alteration of the Protestant magistracy in the burghs; the reception of English Jesuits into Scotland ; the negotiations of the Scottish nobles now in power with the Bishops of Glasgow and Ross, Mary's Ambassadors and instruments at the Courts of France and Spain ; the frequent intel ligence between the young King and his mother; his speeches in her favour, and his impatience of hearing anything in her dispraise : all were so many facts, to which the most blind observer could scarcely shut his eyes ; and which, to use Davison's words to Walsingham, clearly demonstrated that the Scottish Queen, though elsewhere in person, sat at the stern of the Government, and guided both King and nobles as she pleased.1 This was an alarming state of things to Elizabeth. The King was now grown up : his marriage could not be long delayed. If, by his mother's influence, it took place with a daughter of France ; if to the intrigues of the Spanish faction of the Roman Catho lics in her own realm, were to be added the revived influence of the Guises in Scotland, and an increased power of exciting rebellion in Ireland ; what security had she for her crown, or even for her life ? A con spiracy against her person was at this moment organiz- 1 MS, St. P. Off, Davison to Walsingham, May 28, 1584."], [236, "1584. 212 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ing in England; for which Francis Throckmorton was afterwards executed.1 Of its true character it is dif ficult to form an opinion ; but whether a real or a counterfeit plot, it was enough to alarm the country. It seems certain, that many Jesuits and seminary priests were busy in both kingdoms exciting the people to rebellion : slanderous libels, and treatises on tyrannicide, were printed and scattered about by those who considered the Queen of England a usurper and a heretic : her enemies looked to the Queen of Scots as the bulwark of the true faith in England; and Mary, impatient under her long captivity, natu rally and justifiably felt disposed to encourage every scheme which promised her liberty and rest. At this moment, when all was so gloomy, the faction in Scotland by whose assistance Elizabeth had hitherto kept her opponents in check, was suddenly over whelmed; its leaders executed, or driven into banish ment ; and a government set up, the first acts of which had exhibited a complete devotedness to the friends and the interests of Mary. The English Queen was, therefore, compelled, by the imminency of the danger, to put the question, How was this crisis to be met ? Consulting Davi son, she found that any attempt at direct mediation, in favour of the banished lords, would, in the present temper of the young King, be unsuccessful ; and to use open force to create a counter-revolution, and restore the Protestant ascendancy, was full of peril.2 1 Carte, vol. iii. p. 586. 2 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Davison to Burghley, June 23, 1584."], [237, "1584. 213 JAMES VI. Setting both these aside, however, there were still three ways which presented themselves to revive her influence, and check the headlong violence by which things were running into confusion and hostility to England. One was to secure the services of Arran, who possessed the greatest influence over James. He had secretly offered himself to Elizabeth, declared his constancy in religion, as it was professed in Eng land, and his conviction, that to preserve the amity with that realm, was the best policy for his Sove reign. He undertook, if the English Queen followed his counsel, to keep the young King, his master, unmarried for three years ; and he requested her to send down to the Border, some nobleman of rank in whom she placed confidence ; whom he would meet there, and to whom, in a private conference, he would propose such measures as should be for the lasting benefit of both countries. A second method, directly contrary to this, was to support the banished lords, Angus, Mar, and Glammis, with money and troops ; to employ them to overwhelm Arran, and compel the King to restore the reformed faction, and the exiled ministers of the Kirk. A third scheme presented itself, in the offers which the captive Queen herself had made at this moment to Elizabeth. She was now old, she said ; ambition had no charms for her ; she was too much broken in health and spirits, by her long imprisonment, to meddle with affairs of State. All that she now wished, was to be restored to liberty, and permitted to live in retirement, either in England, or in her own country. She could not"], [238, "214 1584. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. prevent her friends, and the great body of the Roman Catholics in Europe, from connecting her name with their efforts for the restoration of the true faith ; from soliciting her approval, and organizing plans for her deliverance. All this resulted from her having been so long detained a captive against the most common principles of law and justice ; but if the Queen would adopt a more generous system, and restore her to liber ty, she was ready, she said, to make Elizabeth a party to the association, which was now nearly completed, with her son, to resign the government into the hands of the young King; to use her whole influence in reconciling him to the exiled lords ; to promote, by every method in her power, the amity with England ; and not only to discourage the intrigues of the Roman Catholics against the government of her good sister, but to put her in possession of many secret particu lars, known only to herself, by which she should be enabled to traverse the schemes of her enemies, and restore security to her person and government. All these three methods presented themselves to Elizabeth, and all had their difficulties. If she ac cepted Arran's offer, it could hardly be done except after the old fashion, which she so much disliked : of pensioning himself and his friends; outbidding France ; and setting her face against his mortal ene mies, the Douglases and the Hamiltons, whose return must be his ruin. If she sent back the exiled lords, it equally involved her in expense, and pledged her to the support of the Kirk ; to whose Presbyterian form of government, and high claims of infallibility"], [239, "1584. 215 JAMES VI. and independence, she bore no favour. If she em braced Mary's proposals, \u2014 her safest, because her justest and most generous course, \u2014 she acted in hos tility to the advice of Burghley and Walsingham, who were deemed her wisest councillors; and who had declared, in the strongest possible terms, that the freedom of the Scottish Queen was inconsistent with the life of their royal mistress, or the continuance of the Protestant opinions in England. Having weighed these difficulties, Elizabeth held a conference with her confidential ministers, Lord Burghley and Wal singham. Although of one mind as to the rejection of the offers of Mary, they, contrary to what had hitherto taken place, differed in opinion on the two alternatives which remained. Burghley advised her to gain Arran, to send a minister to hold a secret conference with him on the Borders,1 and, through his influence, to manage the young King. Walsingham, on the other hand, warmly pleaded for the banished lords. No trust, he affirmed, could be put in Arran ; and, as long as he ruled all, there would be no peace for England : but at this instant, so great was the un popularity of the young King, and this proud minis ter, that if her Majesty sent home the banished lords, with some support in money and soldiers, they would soon expel him from his high ground, and restore English ascendancy at the Scottish Court. Having considered these opinions, Elizabeth de cided that she would exclusively follow neither, but 1 MS. St. P. Off., Instructions to Lord Hunsdon, June 30, 1584."], [240, "216 1584.

To all the three parties who had offered themselves, hopes were held out. Arran was flattered, his pro posals accepted ; and Lord Hunsdon, the cousin of the English Queen, directed to meet him in a confer ence on the Borders.1 At the same moment, a nego tiation, which had been opened a short while before with the Queen of Scots, was renewed. She was once more deluded with the dream of liberty ; and encouraged to use her influence with her son, and persuade him to more charitable feelings towards England, and the exiled lords : 2 and, lastly, these noblemen, and the banished ministers of the Kirk, were fed with hopes, that the Queen would restore them to their country ; strengthen them with money and arms, and gratefully accept their service to over whelm both Arran and the Scottish Queen.3 In this way, Elizabeth persuaded herself, that she could hold in her hand, and ingeniously play against each other the main strings which moved the principal puppets 1 MS.

If Arran proved true to his promises, as Burghley anticipated, she could easily cast off the banished lords ; if false, as Walsingham judged likely, they were ready, at her beck, to rise and over whelm him. Whilst, from the captive Queen, whose restoration %6 liberty was never seriously contem plated, she expected to gain such disclosures as should enable her to traverse the constant intrigues of her enemies. It is to be remembered, that all these three modes of policy were carried on at one and the same time ; and it is consequently difficult to bring the picture clearly, or without confusion, before the eye : but it must be attempted. Elizabeth, in the beginning of July, informed James that she had accepted his offers, and had appointed Lord Hunsdon to hold a conference with Arran on the Borders.1 The arrangements for this meeting, however, which was to be conducted with considerable pompand solemnity, could not be completed tillAugust; and Davison, the English Ambassador in Scotland, employed this interval in getting up a faction in favour of the banished lords, undermining the influence of Arran, and in tampering with the Governor of the Castle of Edinburgh, for its delivery into the hands of the Queen. For all this Walsingham sent special instructions : and whilst his secret agents were busy in Scotland, Colvile had private meetings with Eliza beth, and laboured to gain the Hamiltons to join the exiled noblemen. It was hoped, in this way, that 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Walsingham to Davison, July 2, 1534."], [242, "218 1584. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the foundation of a movement would be laid, by which, if Arran played false, a result which both Elizabeth and Walsingham expected, the banished nobles should break into Scotland, seize or assassinate him, get pos session of the person of the King, and put an end to the French faction in that country. This, as will be seen in the sequel, actually took place, though the course of events interrupted and delayed the outbreak.1 It was now time for the appointed conference ; and, on the fourteenth of August, the Earl of Arran and Lord Hunsdon met at Foulden Kirk ; a place on the Borders, not far from Berwick. It was one ob ject of the Scottish lord to impress the English with a high idea of his power; and the state with which he came was that of a sovereign rather than a subject. His retinue amounted to five thousand horse, and he was attended by five members of the Privy-council, who, whilst Hunsdon and he alone entered the church, waited obsequiously without in the churchyard. AU, even the highest noblemen, appeared to treat him with such humility and deference, that Lord Hunsdon, writing to Burghley, observed, they seemed rather servants than fellow-councillors ; and Sir Edward Hoby, who was also on the spot, declared he not only comported himself with a noble dignity and grace, but was, in truth, a king, binding and loosing at his pleasure.2 In opening the conference, Arran pro- 1 MS.

There was a frankness about his commu nications which impressed him with a conviction of their truth ; and Hoby, who knew Elizabeth's love of handsome men, sent a minute portrait of him to Burghley, recommending him to the favour of his royal mistress. For the man, said he, surely he car rieth a princely presence and gait, goodly of person age, representing a brave countenance of a captain of middle age, very resolute, very wise and learned, and one of the best spoken men that ever I heard : a man worthy the Queen's favour, if it please her.1 But to return to the conference. Hunsdon, on his side, following the instructions of Elizabeth, com plained of the recent unkind conduct of James in seeking an alliance with France, and encouraging the enemies of England. It was well known, he said, to his royal mistress, that this young Prince, instead of fulfilling his promises to her to whom he owed so much, was practising against her. His harbouring of Jesuits ; his banishment of the noble men best affected to England ; his intended \" asso ciation\" with his mother; his intercourse with the Pope ; his contemptuous treatment of her Ambas sadors, all proved this; and would, ere now, have called down a severe retaliation, had he not recently shown a change of mind, and expressed a desire of 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Sir Edward Hoby to Lord Burghley, August 15, 1584."], [244, "\u2666 220 1584. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. reconciliation, which she was willing to believe sincere. She now trusted that Arran would act up to his pro testations; and employ his influence with the King his master, for the restoration of amity between the two Crowns, and the return of his exiled nobility. In his reply to this, Arran did not affect to con ceal the intrigues of France and Spain to gain the young King ; but he assured Hunsdon that all his influence should be exerted to counteract their suc cess, and promote the amity with England. As to his complaints, some he admitted to be true, some he denied, others he exculpated. His master, he said, had never dealt with any Jesuits, and knew of none in his dominions : he had no intentions of car rying forward \"the association\" with his mother; nor had he any secret intrigues with the Pope. He admitted his severity to some of her Ambassadors : but had it not been for the reverence he bore to their mistress, he would have used them with harder mea sure ; for he had Mr Randolph's own hand to prove him a stirrer up of sedition : and it was Mr Bowes, her Majesty's Ambassador, who was the principal plotter of the seizure of his person at Ruthven, and the recent rebellious enterprise at Stirling. As for the banished lords, it was strange, indeed, to find her Majesty an intercessor for men who had cast off their allegiance, and taken arms against their natural Prince ; and whose proceedings had been so outrage ous, that neither the King, nor he himself, could en tertain the idea of their return for a moment. Angus, Mar, and their companions, had never ceased to plot"], [245, "1584. 221 JAMES VI. against the government. Let him look back to the course of the last two years. With what shameful ingratitude had Angus treated the King his master, in the business of the Earl of Morton, in the affair of the Raid of Ruthven, when they seized and im prisoned him, (Arran,) and threatened the King they would send him his head in a dish, if he did not in stantly banish Lennox ! Hunsdon pleaded against this the King's own letter to Elizabeth, which showed that he was pleased with the change. Arran smiled and said, it was easy to extort such a letter from a Prince they had in their hands. Hunsdon replied, that James ought to have secretly sought advice from Bowes the English Ambassador. Bowes ! retorted Arran. \u2014 Bowes, as the King well knew, was at the bottom of the whole conspiracy for his apprehension. And, then, look to the dealings of the same lords in the last affair which cost Gowrie his head. With what craft did they seduce the ministers ; plotting my death, and the King's second apprehension, had it not been happily detected and defeated. Nay, said he, getting warmer as he proceeded, what will your lordship think, if I tell you, that at this moment the men you are pleading for as penitent exiles, are as active and cruel-minded in their captivity as ever ; and that, at this instant, I have in my hands the certain proofs of a plot now going forward, to seize the King, to assassinate myself, to procure, by treachery, the Castle of Edinburgh, and to overturn the Government I1 'Tis but a few days since all this 1 MS. St. P. Off, Hunsdon to Walsingham, 14th August, 1584;"], [246, "222 1584. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. has been discovered : and can your Lordship advise your mistress to intercede for such traitors ? This was too powerful an appeal to be resisted ; and Hunsdon, changing the subject, spoke of the con spiracies against Elizabeth. Adverting to Throck morton's recent treason, he declared that his mistress the Queen well knew that, at this moment, there were practices carrying on in the heart of her king dom for the disturbance of her government. She knew, also, that the King of Scots and his mother were privy to these ; nay, she knew that it was in tended he should be a principal actor therein. Let him disclose them all fully and frankly, and he should find that the English Queen knew how to be grateful. To this, Arran promptly answered, that nothing should be hid from Elizabeth, and no effort omitted by the King or himself to satisfy her Majesty on this point. He then showed Hunsdon his commission under the Great Seal, giving him the broadest and most unlimited powers; and the conference, which had lasted for five hours, was brought to an end.1 On coming out of the church, both Hunsdon and he appeared in the highest spirits and good humour. It was evident to the lords, who had waited without, that their solitary communi cations had been of an agreeable nature; and the Scottish Earl seemed resolved that his own people and MS.

Hunsdon and Lord Burghley had a little plot of their own to secure the favour of the young King of Scots, by gaining Arran, and bringing about a marriage between James and a niece of the English Earl; who, as cousin to Elizabeth, considered his kin as of royal blood.2 On this point, Walsing ham felt so bitterly, that he accused his old friends of worshipping the rising sun ; and observed, that her Majesty had need now to make much of faithful servants.3 On coming out of the church, Arran called for the Master of Gray, a young nobleman of his suite, and introduced him to Hunsdon. It was impossible not to be struck with the handsome countenance and grace ful manners of this youth. He had spent some time at the Court of France ; and, having been bred up in 1 MS. Letter, St. P.

He had always professed the deepest attachment to this unhappy Princess ; and the young King had, within the last year, become so captivated with his society, that Mary, who had too rapidly trusted him with much of her secret correspondence, sanguinely hoped that his influence would be of the highest service to her, in regaining a hold over the affections of her son. But Gray, under an exterior which was preeminently beautiful, though too feminine to please some tastes, carried a heart as black and treacherous as any in this profligate age; and, instead of advocating, was prepared to betray the cause of the imprisoned Queen. To her son the young King, and the Earl of Arran, he had already revealed all he knew ; and he now presented a letter from James his master to Hunsdon. Its contents were of a secret and confidential kind, and related to the conspiracies against Elizabeth, which gave this Princess such per- petual disquiet. After enjoining onHunsdon the strict est concealment of all he was about to communicate from every living being, except his royal mistress, Gray informed him that the King of Scots meant to send him speedily as Ambassador to England, with some public and open message to Elizabeth ; under colour of which, he was to be entrusted with the com mission of disclosing all the secret practices of Mary. Had Hunsdon kept his promise, we should have known nothing of all this ; but, next morning, he communi-"], [249, "1584. 225 JAMES VI. cated it to Burghley, in a letter meant only for his private eye. It is to the preservation of this letter, that we owe our knowledge of a transaction which brings the young King, and his favourite the Master of Gray, before us in the degrading light of informers : the one betraying his mother ; the other selling, for his own gain, the secrets with which he had been entrusted by his sovereign. This is so dark an accusa tion, that I must substantiate it by an extract from the letter in question. \" Now, my Lord,\" said Huns don, addressing Burghley, \" for the principal point of such conspiracies as are in hand against her Majesty, I am only to make her Majesty acquainted withal by what means she shall know it \u2014 yet wrill I acquaint your lordship with all. The King did send the Mas ter of Gray, at this meeting, to me, with a letter of commendation, under the King's own hand, whom he means presently to send to her Majesty, as though it were for some other matters; but it is he that must discover all these practices, as one better ac quainted with them than either the King or the Earl, (but by him.)1 He is very young, but wise and secret, as Arran doth assure me. He is, no doubt, very in ward with the Scottish Queen, and all her affairs, both in England and France ; yea, and with the Pope, for he is accounted a Papist ; but for his religion, your lordship will judge when you see him; but her Majesty must use him as Arran will prescribe unto her ; and so shall she reap profit by him. * * * 1 These words seem superfluous, yet they are in the original letter.

I have written to Mr Secretary [Walsingham] for a safe conduct to him ; but nothing of the cause of his coming, but only to her Majesty and to your lord ship. If Mr Secretary be slow for this safe conduct, I pray your lordship further it, for the matter re quires no delay.\" 1 The conference was now concluded, and Arran had succeeded in persuading Lord Hunsdon, not only of his sincerity and devotion to the service of Elizabeth, but of his entire hold over the mind of his royal master. If Lord Burghley, to whom he professed the utmost attachment, would cooperate firmly with him self and Hunsdon, and the Master of Gray, he was able, he affirmed, to hold the young King entirely at the devotion of the Queen of England. He did not despair to unite the two Crowns in an indissoluble league ; and, by exposing the practices of her enemies, to enable Elizabeth to traverse all the plots of Mary and the Roman Catholics. But there were two parties whom, he declared, they must put down at all risks. The one laboured for the liberty of the captive Queen, and her association in the government with her son. The other was, at this moment, intriguing in every way for the return of Angus and the exiled lords ; for the triumph of the Kirk over Episcopacy, and the reestablishment of the republican principles which had led to the Raid of Ruthven, and the other con spiracies for seizing the King, and using him as their tool. The first party was supported by France, 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Hunsdon to Burghley, 14th August, 1584."], [251, "1584. 227 JAMES VI. Spain, and the Spanish faction of the Roman Catholics in England. Its agents on the Continent were the Bishops of Ross and Glasgow, whose emissaries, the Jesuits and seminary priests, were, at that moment, plotting in Scotland ; it possessed many friends in the Privy-council and nobility of Scotland, \u2014 such as, Maitland the Chancellor, Sir James and Sir Robert Melvil,1 the Earl of Huntley, and it might, indeed, be said, the whole body of the Roman Catholic peers in both countries. It was from this party that the late conspiracies against the Queen of England had proceeded, as her Majesty would soon discover by the embassy of the Master of Gray ; and, if she listened to his (Arran's) advice, it would be no difficult matter to detach James for ever from his mother and her friends. But to effect this, she must put down the other faction of the banished lords. The King, he said, hated Angus, their leader ; and Angus and the whole house of Douglas, were still boiling in their hearts to revenge on their sovereign, and on Arran, the death of the Regent Morton. As to the banished lords of the house of Hamilton, their return must be his (Arran's) destruction; and, for the exiled ministers of the Kirk, James was so incensed against them, and so bent upon the establishment of Episcopacy, that he would listen to no measures connected with their restoration. Yet this party for the return of the banished lords, was supported by Walsingham in England, and Davison her Majesty's Ambassador 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Walsingham to Hunsdon, 12th Aug., 1584."], [252, "1584. 228 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. in Scotland; and their busy agent, Colvile, was admit ted to secret audiences with Elizabeth, and fed with hopes of their return. If, said Arran, this policy wrere continued, it would blast all his efforts for the binding his young master to the service of Elizabeth; for rather than one of the banished lords should set his foot in Scotland, James, he wras assured, would throw himself into the arms of France and Spain, and carry through the project of an association with his mother the captive Queen. These arguments of Arran explain that jealousy and irritation which appeared in many of Secretary Walsingham's letters regarding the conference be tween him and Hunsdon. This crafty statesman was well aware that there was a conference within a con ference, to which he was kept a stranger ; a secret negotiation between Burghley and Hunsdon, the ex act object of which he could not fathom ; but by which he felt his own policy regarding Scotland shackled and defeated. He looked, therefore, with suspicion upon Burghley's whole conduct in the affairs of Scotland at this time ; and these feelings were increased by the court which Arran had paid to Burghley's nephew, Sir Edward Hoby, who formed one of Hunsdon's suite at the conference. This accomplished person, on the conclusion of the conference, rode from Foulden Kirk, writh the Earl of Arran, to the ground where he had left his troops ; the distance was three miles ; they had ample time for secret talk ; and Hoby, next morning, described the conversation, in letters addressed both to his"], [253, "1584. 229 JAMES VI. uncle Burghley, and his kinsman Dr Parry.1 The Scottish Earl was particularly flattering and confi dential. Bringing Hoby near his troops, which were admirably mounted and accoutred, he pointed to them significantly, and shaking his head, told him in these ranks there were many principal leaders, who would gladly send him out of the world if they could, so mortally did they hate him ; but he feared them not. Nay, such was his power, and his enemies' weakness at this moment, that if Elizabeth would accept his offers, she should, have twenty thousand men at her service. To devote himself to her, indeed, would be his highest pride. As for France and Spain, he cared little for either. He neither needed their friendship, nor feared their enmity ; but with the favour of- his royal master, could live in Scotland independent of both ; and for these conspiracies against his life, the same God who had defended him in Muscovy, Sweden, and Germany, would cast his shield over him at home. Arran then appears to have changed the subject to James's expectations as Elizabeth's successor, the state of England, the rival interests of the Catholic and Protestant factions in reference to this delicate point, and the probable effects of Mary's intrigues for the recovery of her liberty upon the prospects of her son. So, at least, may be conjectured from Hob'y's description of the great and weighty discourses into which he entered; and he ended by assuring him, that the King of Scots desired, of all things in the world, to place himself, and his whole interests, 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off., Sir Edward Hoby to Dr Parry, Aug.. 15, 1584."], [254, "1584. 230 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. in the hands of Lord Burghley and Lord Hunsdon, the one as the wisest head, and the other the boldest heart in England.1 When it is recollected that Arran was no friend of the Queen of Scots, and that Burghley was not only opposed to every scheme for her liberty, but had often repeated his conviction, that her life was inconsistent with Elizabeth's security, we require no more certain evidence of the melancholy fact, that James was ready, at this instant, to desert her cause and betray her designs to her bitterest enemies. On his return, from this conference, to the capital, Arran, presuming on its successful issue, resumed the management of affairs with a high and proud hand. A few days before he met Hunsdon he had, as we have just seen, discovered a conspiracy against the government. In this plot, the Captain of the Castle of Edinburgh had been detected tampering with Davison and Walsingham, for the delivery of the fortress into the hands of the English faction ; and Arran wisely resolved to defeat all recurrence of such attempts, by taking possession of the place in person.2 He, accordingly, removed the Governor and officers, substituted his own creatures in their room, demanded the keys of the crown jewels and wardrobe, from Sir Robert Melvil ; and, with his lady and household, occupied the royal apartments within the castle.3 He had now four of the strongest fort- 1 MS.

On his return from the conference at Foulden Kirk, he was welcomed with cannon by the castle ; a ceremony, as it was remarked, never used but in time of Parlia ment, and to the King or Regents : and when, soon after, summonses were issued for the meeting of the three Estates, all the country looked forward with alarm to a renewal of the proscriptions and plunder which had already commenced against the exiled lords. But the reality even outran their anticipation. Arran, assisted by his lady, a woman whose pride and insolence exceeded his own, domineered over the de liberations of Parliament; and, to the scandal of all, insisted on those Acts, which they had previously prepared, being passed at once without reasoning.1 Sixty persons were forfeited ;2 many were driven to purchase pardons at a high ransom ; and the unhappy Countess of Gowrie was treated with a cruelty and brutality which excited the utmost commiseration in all who witnessed it. This lady, a daughter of Henry Stewart Lord Methven, on the last day of the Par liament, had obtained admission to an antechamber, where, as the King passed, she hoped to have an 1 MS. Letter, St. P.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. opportunity of pleading for herself and her children ; but, by Arran's orders, she was driven into the open street. Here she patiently awaited the King's re turn, and cast herself, in an agony of tears, at his feet, attempting to clasp his knees : but Arran, who walked at James's hand, hastily pulled him past, and, pushing the miserable suppliant aside, not only threw her down, but brutally trod upon her as the cavalcade moved forward, leaving her in a faint on the pave ment. Can we wonder that the sons of this injured woman, bred up in the recollection of wrongs like these, should, in later years, have cherished in their hearts the deepest appetite for revenge ? Immediately after the Parliament, the King re paired to his palace at Falkland ; whilst Arran, Montrose, and the other lords of his party, now all powerful, remained in Edinburgh, engaged in pressing on the execution of the late Acts, for the confiscation and ruin of their opponents. Of these, by far the most formidable was the Earl of Angus ; who, al though banished, and now at Newcastle, retained a great influence in Scotland. He was the head of the Presbyterian faction in that country, the great sup port of the exiled ministers; and it was his authority Avith Walsingham that traversed Arran's and James's schemes for a league between England and Scotland, on the broad basis of the establishment of Episcopacy. It was resolved, therefore, to cut off this baron ; and Arran, and his colleague Montrose, the head of the powerful house of Graham, made no scruple of look ing out for some desperate retainer, or hired villain,"], [257, "1584. 233 JAMES VI. to whom they might commit the task. Nor, in these dark times, was such a search likely to prove either long or difficult. They accordingly soon pitched upon Jock or John Graham of Peartree, whom Mon trose knew to have a blood feud with Angus; sent a little page called Mouse to bring 'the Borderer to Edinburgh ; feasted and caressed him during the time of the Parliament, and carried him afterwards to Falkland, where the two Earls, and the King, proposed to him not only to assassinate their hated enemy, but to make away with Mar and Cambus kenneth, his brother exiles, at the same time. Jock at once agreed to murder Angus, and was promised a high reward by the young monarch ; but he de clined having anything to do with Mar or Cambus kenneth, with whom he had no quarrel ; and he left the palace, after receiving from Montrose a short matchlock, or riding-piece, which was deemed ser viceable for the purpose in hand. But this atrocious design was hot destined to succeed. The villain, who was probably lurking about in the neighbourhood of Newcastle, was detected and seized, carried before Lord Scrope, compelled to confess his intention ; and information of the whole plot was immediately trans mitted by Scrope to Walsingham.1 The English Secretary recommended, that the discovery should be kept a secret from all, except Angus and Mar, who were privately warned of the practices against 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, B.C., 22d Dec., 1584, Scrope to W^alsingham. \" For the matter of Peartree, I have kept the same secret, saving to the Earls of Angus and Mar, who, I trust, will use it as the same behoveth.\""], [258, "1584. 234 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. them ; and it is from the confession of the Borderer himself, which he made before Scrope, that these particulars are given. The intended assassin thus described his interview with the King : After stat ing that he -had arrived late at night at the palace, they brought him, he said, into the King's gallery, where he [the King] was alone by himself: and only he, Montrose, and Arran, and this examinant, being together, the King himself did move him, as the other two had done, for the killing of Angus, Mar, and Cambuskenneth : to whom he answered, that for Mar and Cambuskenneth, he would not meddle with them ; but for Angus, he would well be contented to do that, so as the King would well reward him for that. And the King said, he wTould presently give him sixty French crowns, and twenty Scottish pound land to him and his for ever, lying in Strathern, near Montrose.1 These facts are so distinctly and minutely recorded in the manuscript history of Calderwood, who has given the whole of Graham's declaration, that it was impossible to omit them ; but although there is little doubt of the truth of the intended murder, as far as Arran and Montrose are concerned, it would be, per haps, unfair to believe in the full implication of the young King, on the single evidence of this Border assassin. To return, however, from this digression to Arran's headlong career. His hand, which had 1 MS. Calderwood, Brit. Mus., 1468.

Proclamation was made that all ministers should give up the rental of their benefices ; and that none should receive stipend but such as had subscribed the new-framed policy, by which Presbytery was abrogated and Episcopacy established. As was to be expected, many of the clergy resisted, and were commanded to quit the country within twenty days : nor were they permit ted, as before, to take refuge with their banished brethren in England or Ireland.1 All this was car ried through at the instigation of the primate, Arch bishop Adamson ; who had recently returned from England, and exerted himself to purify the' Univer sities from the leaven of Presbyterian doctrine, and to fill the vacant pulpits with ministers attached to the new form of policy. His efforts, however, met with bitter opposition. At St Andrew's, the Archi episcopal palace in which Adamson resided, was sur rounded by troops of students, who armed themselves with harquebusses, and paraded round the walls, bidding the primate remember how fatal that see had been to his predecessor, and look for no better issue. Montgomery the Bishop of Glasgow was attacked in the streets of Ayr by a mob of women and boys, who with difficulty were restrained from stoning him, aud kept pouring out the vilest abuse, calling him Atheist dog, schismatic excommunicate beast, unworthy to breathe or bear life.2 Some of 1 MS.

The anathema of one of these, named Mr John Hewison, minister of Cambuslang, has been preserved. It is more remarkable, cer tainly, for its courage than its charity ; and may be taken as an example of the tone of the high Puritan faction to which he belonged. Preaching in the Blackfriars at Edinburgh, on the text which declares the resolute answer of St Peter and St Paul to the Council of the Pharisees, he passed from the general application to the trials of the Kirk at that moment, and broke out into these words : \u2014 \" But what shall we say ? There is injunction now given by ane 1 wicked and godless counsel, to stop the mouths of the ministers from teaching of the truth ; and sic 2 a godless order made, as the like was never seen be fore.

I sail never obey their injunctions ; like as I request all faithful folk to do the like.\"4 The prediction of this bold minister was so far verified, that he was appre hended, and order given to bring him to justice ; but for some reason not easily discovered, the trial did not take place.5 It was at this same time, that Mr David Lindsay, one of the persecuted ministers, whose mind, in the solitude of his prison at Blackness, had been worked into a state of feverish enthusiasm, was reported to have seen an extraordinary vision. Suddenly, in the firmament, there appeared a figure in the likeness of a man ; of glorious shape and surpassing brightness : the sun was above his head, the moon beneath his feet ; and he seemed to stand in the midst of the stars. As the captive gazed, an angel alighted at the feet of this transcendant Being, bearing in his right hand a red 1 Wrangously, wrongfully. 2 Aneugh, enough. 3 Ken, know. 4 MS. St. P.

Before its gate stood the Earl of Arran and his flagitious consort : the Earl gazing in horror on the destroying minister, who waved his .sword above his head ; his Countess smiling in derision, and mocking his fears. The scene then changed : the captive was carried to an eminence, from which he looked down upon the land, wdth its wide fields, its cities and palaces. Sud denly the same terrible visitant appeared : a cry of lamentation arose from its inhabitants ; fire fell from heaven on its devoted towns \u2014 the sword did its work \u2014 the rivers ran with blood \u2014 and the fields were covered with the dead. It was a fearful sight ; but, amidst its horrors, a little bell was heard; and, within a cburch which had stood uninjured even in the flames, a remnant of the faithful assembled; to whom the angel uttered these words of awful admonition. \u2014 \" Metuant Justi. Iniquitatem fugite. Deligite Justi tiam et Judicium ; aut cito revertar et posteriora erunt pejora prioribus.\"1 Lindsay asserted that it was impossible for him to ascertain whether this scene, which seemed to shadow out the persecutions and prospects of the Kirk, was a dream or a vision ; 1 Sir George Warrender.

JAMES VI. but it brought to his mind, he said, a prophecy of Knox ; who, not long before his death, had pre dicted great peril to the faithful in the eighteenth year of the reign of James. Elizabeth now recalled Davison from Scotland,1 and looked anxiously for James's promised Ambas sador, the Master of Gray, whose mission had, as she thought, been somewhat suspiciously delayed. But this gave her the less anxiety, as she had, in the meantime, continued her correspondence with the banished lords ; whom, at any moment, she was ready to let loose against Arran and the King.2 She, at the same time, resumed her negotiations with Mary; and this unfortunate princess, who had so often been deluded with hopes, which withered in the expected moment of accomplishment, was, at last, induced to believe that the blessed period of freedom had arrived. Even Walsingham declared himself pleased with her offers, and advised that his royal mistress should be satisfied with them.3 Such was the crisis seized by the accomplished villany of the Master of Gray, to betray his royal mistress, and to enter the service of Elizabeth. Before he threw off the mask, he had the effrontery to write to Mary, affecting the highest indignation at the suspicions she had expressed of his fidelity ; and declaring, that the best mode to serve her interests was that which he was now 1 MS.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. following. It wras necessary, he said, that the young King her son, should, in the first instance, treat solely for himself with Elizabeth, and abandon all thoughts of \" the association \" with his mother. This, he affirmed, would disarm suspicion; and James, having gained the confidence of the English Queen, might be able to negotiate for her liberty. But Mary, who was already aware of Gray's treachery, from the re presentations of Fontenay the French Ambassador, promptly and indignantly answered, that any one who proposed such a separation between her interests and those of her son, or who opposed \" the association,\" which was almost concluded, must be her enemy, and in that light she would regard him. To this Gray returned an angry answer, and instantly set off for England.1 At Berwick, he had a private consultation with Hunsdon, whose heart he gained by his sanctimoni- ous deportment in the English church, and by the frankness with which be communicated his instruc tions. His principal object, he declared, was to in- sist, that the banished lords should either be delivered up by Elizabeth, or dismissed from her dominions. If this were done, or if the Queen were ready to pledge her word that it should be done, he was pre- pared, he said, to disclose all he knew of the secret plots against her person and government ; and he would pledge himself, that no practice had been undertaken, for the last five years, against herself, or her Estate, by France, Spain, the Scottish Queen, or 1 Papers of Master of Gray, Bannatyne Club, p. 30-37."], [265, "1584. 241 JAMES VI. the Pope, but she should know it, and how to avoid it.1 Gray had been expressly ordered by James to hold his confidential communications with Burgh ley alone, and to repose no trust in Walsingham, whom the young King regarded as his enemy. From Arran he had received the same injunctions; and nothing could exceed the confidence which both monarch and minister seemed disposed to place in Cecil. The King paid court to him in a long pedan tic letter, written wholly in his own hand ; in which he discoursed learnedly upon Alexander the Great and Homer ; modestly disclaiming any parallel be tween himself and the conqueror of Darius, but ex alting Cecil far above such \" a blind, begging fellowT\" as the Grecian bard. He addressed him as his friend and cousin, and assured him, that he considered himself infinitely fortunate in being permitted to confide his most secret affairs to such a counsellor ; to whom, he was convinced, he already owed all the prosperity which hitherto had attended him.2 Arran, at the same time, wrote in the most flattering and confiden tial terms to Sir Edward Hoby, Burghley's nephew ; and Hunsdon was requested by James to repair from Berwick to the English Court, that he might assist in their consultations.3 Gray now proceeded to London, and was speedily admitted to an audience of Elizabeth. It may be necessary, for a moment, to attend to the exact atti- 1 Hunsdon to Burghley, 19th Oct., 1584, Papers of Master of Gray, p. 13. - MS. Letter, St. P.

She had the party of the banished lords, now in England, at her command. Angus, Mar, Lord Arbroath the head of the house of Hamilton, Glammis, and many other powerful barons, were in constant communication with Walsingham ; their vassals on the alert ; the exiled ministers of the Kirk eager to join and inarch alongwith them. They held themselves ready at her beck; and she had only to give the word for them to cross the Border and attack Arran, to have it instantly obeyed. On the side of Mary, this poor captive had been drawn on, by the prospect of freedom, to offer the sacrifice of everything which belonged to her as an independent Princess, and which she could give up with honour. By the long-con templated \" association \" with her son, she had agreed to resign the government into his hands, and to re nounce for ever all connexion with public affairs, were she only allowed to live in freedom, with the exercise of her religion. Here, then, the Queen of England had only to consent ; and, in the opinion of even the suspicious Walsingham, she was safe. Such was the state of things, when the Master of Gray made his proposals from a third party, \u2014 the young King and Arran. From his intimate know ledge of the most secret transactions of the Scottish Queen and the Catholic faction, he was possessed, as he affirmed, of information which vitally touched her Majesty's person and estate.1 This he was ready 1 Papers of the Master of Gray, p. 13. Hunsdon to Burghley, 19th October, 1584."], [267, "243 1584. JAMES VI. to reveal ; but on condition that she would deliver up the banished lords, or drive them out of her domi nions ; break off all treaty with Mary on the subject of the association; and advance a large sum of money, in the shape of an annual proof of her affection to the young King. The first was absolutely necessary; for the King his master was animated with the strongest hatred of his rebels. The second was equally so ; for Mary's liberty was inconsistent with the security of both the Queen of England and James : her unshaken attachment to the Roman Catholic faith, rendering any \" association \" with her son highly dangerous to Elizabeth ; whose efforts ought to be directed to separate their interests, and to secure the establishment of a government in Scotland under a minister opposed to Mary. And here Gray artfully laid the foundation of his own rise with Eliza beth, and Arran's disgrace. Arran, he insinuated, was not so deeply devoted to her Majesty, or so hostile to the Scottish Queen as he pretended. He was proud, capricious, tyrannical, and completely venal. The King, too, was in such need of money, that Eliza beth would do well to remember that his politics, at this time, depended on the supply of his purse. If France bid highest, France would have both the min ister and his master. Arran, too, by his pride and extortions, was daily, almost hourly, raising up a formidable party against him. None dared to aspire to any interest with the King, whom he did not attack and attempt to ruin. Already he, the^ Master of Gray, was the object of his jealousy and hatred."], [268, "244 1584. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. for the favour with which the King regarded him. All was yet, indeed, smooth and smiling between them; but he knew well, this very embassy had been given him with the view of separating him from his master. The storm was brewing ; but, if Arran tried to wreck him as he had done so many others, he might chance, proud as he was, to have a fall himself. So con fident did he feel in the love of his royal master, if Elizabeth would grant him her support, he was certain he could supplant this insolent favourite, gain the young King, unite England and Scotland in an indissoluble league, recall the banished lords, over whelm all the secret plots of the Roman Catholics, and completely separate Mary and her son. To effect all this, however, would require time ; for, on two points, the King would be hard to be moved. If the exiles came back, they would bring Melvil and the banished ministers of the Kirk along with them ; and, at this moment, the very mention of such a result, would excite James's determined opposition. Elizabeth was highly pleased with this proposal. She had long distrusted Arran ; and felt that her best security lay in the return of the Protestant lords. She was anxious to break off her negotiation with Mary ; but did not like the odium of such a course. The blame would be thrown on the King of Scots by Gray's plan ; and this she liked much. She knew the unremitting efforts of France and Spain to gain the young King ; and felt assured, that her only safe guard would be an \" association\" between her own kingdom and Scotland, from which Mary should"], [269, "245 1584 JAMES VI. be entirely excluded ; and the basis of which should be the defence of the reformed religion against the perpetual attacks of the Roman Catholics in Europe. There were some circumstances of recent occur rence which greatly strengthened her in this course. Father Crichton, a Jesuit, happening to be on his voyage to Scotland from Flanders, the vessel was chased by pirates, and ne was observed to tear some papers and cast them away. But the wind blew them back into the ship : they were picked up, put to gether, and found to contain a proposal for an inva sion of England by Spain and the Duke of Guise. As one object proposed here, and in all such plots, was the delivery of the Queen of Scots and the de thronement of Elizabeth, their constant recurrence was now met by an \" association\" for the protection of the English Queen's government and life, first pro posed by Leicester, and eagerly subscribed by persons of all ranks and denominations. '^ The terms of this association were afterwards solemnly approved by Parliament, and an act passed for the safety of the Queen's person. It stated, that if any invasion or rebellion should be made in her dominions, or any enterprise attempted against her person, by or for any person pretending a title to the crown after her death, she might, by a commission under the Great Seal, constitute a court for the trial of such offences, and which should have authority to pass sentence upon them. It added, that a judgment of \" Guilty\" having been pronounced, it should immediately be made pub-"], [270, "1584. 246 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. lie ; and that all persons against whom such sentence was passed, should be excluded from all claim to the crown, and be liable to be prosecuted to the death, with their aiders and abettors, by her Majesty's sub jects.1 This league was evidently most unjust to wards the Scottish Queen, as it made her responsible, and liable to punishment, for the actions of persons over whom she had no control. She saw this ; and at once declared that the \" association\" had no other object than indirectly to compass her ruin. But if alarming to Mary, it was proportionably gratifying to Elizabeth. She persuaded herself that if her sub jects thus united to protect her person, and preserve the reformed faith, she ought vigorously to second their efforts ; and this inclined her to look graciously on Gray. The measures, therefore, proposed by him were adopted. It was resolved to undermine Arran, as the first step for the restoration of the banished lords ; and the other objects, it was trusted, would follow. To cooperate with Gray, Sir Edward Wotton was chosen to succeed Davison as Am bassador in Scotland. He was a man of brilliant wit and insinuating address, a great sportsman, an adept in hunting and \" wood-craft ;\" and these qua lities, with a present of eight couple of the best hounds, and some choice horses, would, it was be lieved, entirely gain the heart of the young King. Wotton, too, as we learn from Sir James Melvil, was a deep plotter, and capable of the darkest designs, 1 Carte, vol. iii. p. 587."], [271, "1584. 247 JAMES VI. whilst to the world he seemed but an elegant, light hearted, and thoughtless man of fashion. Having laid these schemes for the ruin of his cap tive Sovereign, aud of Arran his friend, the Master of Gray returned to the Scottish Court, and received the thanks of the King, and his still all-powTerful favourite, for the success with which he had con ducted his negotiations.1 To disarm suspicion, it was judged prudent that, for some time, all should go on serenely. Elizabeth wrote in flattering terms to Arran. She, at the same time, commanded the banished lords to remove from Newcastle into the interior ;2 and, in return for this, Gray had the satis faction of assuring her, that he found the King his master in so loving a disposition towards her, that he could not feel more warmly were he her natural son. He was equally successful in at once creating a breach between Mary and James. The just and merited contempt with which Fontenay, the French Ambassador, had stigmatized Gray's base desertion of that Princess, furnished him with a subject of com plaint to the King and Council ; and he so artfully represented the dangerous consequences which must follow \" an association\" between the young King and his mother, that it was unanimously resolved it should never take place.3 This was a great point gained ; and to secure fur- 1 MS.

They appealed in urgent terms to Walsingham ; declared that even now, if the Queen would say the word, they would break across the Border, surprise the person of the King, and chase Arran with igno miny from the country. Everything was ready for such an effort, and their friends only waited their arrival. But their proposed conspiracy was coldly received. Walsingham wrote to them, that her Ma jesty, seeing the hard success of the late enterprise at Stirling, was doubtful some like plot might have like issue ; and preferred a more temperate system of mediation, in Scottish affairs, to a more violent course.1 The exiles, therefore, submitted; and James and Arran, exulting in their success, recom menced their persecution of the Kirk. All ministers were compelled, on penalty of depri vation, to subscribe the acts of Parliament which estab lished the Episcopal form of Government ; forbidden to hold the slightest intercourse with their brethren who had fled for conscience sake ; and even prosecuted if they dared to pray for them.2 This extreme seve rity appears to have been enforced by a very general submission to the obnoxious acts ; and as it was fol lowed up by the removal of the banished lords into the interior of England, and a prohibition of any 1 MS.

Scottish minister from preaching, publicly or pri vately, in that realm, the cause was considered at the lowest ebb. A letter, written by David Hume, one of the exiles, from Berwick, to Mr James Car michael, a recusant brother of the Kirk, gave some details which carried sorrow to the hearts of the brave little remnant which still stood out against the Court. It told, in homely, but expressive phrase, that all the ministers betwixt Stirling and Berwick, all Lothian, and all the Merse, had subscribed with only ten exceptions ; amongst whom, the most noted were Patrick Simpson and Robert Pont ; that the Laird of Dun, the most venerable champion of the Kirk, had so far receded from his primitive faith as to have become a pest to the ministry in the north ; that John Durie, who had so long resisted, had \"crackedhis curple\" 1 at last, and closed his mouth ; that John Craig, so long the coadjutor of Knox, and John Brande, his colleague, had submitted ; that the pul pits in Edinburgh were nearly silent \u2014 so fearful had been the defection \u2014 except, said he, a very few, who sigh and sob under the Cross. His own estates, he added, had been forfeited, his wife and children beg gared; and yet he might be grateful he was alive, though in exile, for at home terror, occupied all hearts. No man, said he in conclusion, while he lieth down, is sure of his life till day.2 1 Cracked his curple.

This miserable picture was increased in its horrors by the violent proceedings of Arran against all con nected with the banished lords ; by his open con tempt of the laws, and the shameful venality of his government. His pride, his avarice, his insolence to the ancient nobility, and impatience of all who rivalled him in the King's affections, made his go vernment intolerable ; and the Master of Gray, be ginning to find that he was looked upon with sus picion by this daring man, concluded that the moment had come for the mortal struggle betwreen them. At this time, Sir Edward Wotton, the English Am bassador, arrived in Edinburgh. He was instructed to congratulate James on his wise determination to break off \" the association\" with his mother, the captive Queen ; and to encourage him to enter into a firm league with England. The Ambassador was also directed by Elizabeth to hold out to the Scottish King good hopes of a pension ; but Walsingham, her prudent Secretary, advised him not rashly to name the sum set down in his instructions, as its small sound might rather do harm than good.1 As he found opportunity, he was to sound the King, also, on the subject of his marriage, naming the King of Den mark's daughter ; and to assure him, that his deep animosity against the banished lords, was, in her opinion, immoderate and unjust. Last summer, she said, the Earl of Arran had, in his letters to her, accused them of a conspiracy against his life ; and 1 MS. St. P. Off, Minute, Walsingham to Wotton, 23d May, 1585."], [275, "1585. JAMES VI. 251 now, recently, she had investigated a similar tale brought up by James's Ambassador, the Justice clerk : but both tales, in the end, proved so weak and groundless, that she had good cause to think them maliciously devised to serve some end.1 Such were Wotton's open instructions ; and, as he seconded all he said by a present of eight eouple of buckhounds, and brought some noble horses for the royal stud, James received him with the youthful boisterous delight, which such gifts usually produced in the royal mind. But the Ambassador had a darker and more secret commission. During Gray's late stay at the Court of England, he had contrived, with the approval of Elizabeth, and the assistance of Wal singham, a plot for the destruction of Arran ; and Bellenden the Justice-clerk, who had recently visited England, had been prevailed on by the Queen to join it. Wotton was now sent down to take the manage ment ; and at the moment when he arrived, he found the Master of Gray deliberating with his brother conspirators, whether it were best to seize and dis court2 their enemy, or to assassinate him. The Lord Maxwell, now best known bv the title of Earl of Morton, had joined the plot, having a mortal feud with Arran ; and it is not improbable the more vio lent course would have been chosen, when Gray 1 MS.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. received, by the hands of Wotton, a letter frcm Elizabeth, recommending them to spare him. Wot ton next day wrote thus to Walsingham : \"By my letter that myself did deliver to the Master of Gray from her Majesty, their purpose is altered, at her Majesty's request, to deal with him by violence; notwithstanding, upon the least occasion that shall be offered, they mean to make short work with him.\"1 Gray, also, on the same day, addressed a letter to the English Secretary, assuring him, that he would comply with the Queen's wishes, and not resort to violence, except he saw some hazard to his own life. Adding, emphatically and truly, as to his own character, \" when life is gone all is gone to me.\"2 In the midst of these dark intrigues, all was bustle and pleasure at the Scottish Court. The King hunted, feasted, and made progresses to his different palaces, and the seats of his nobility. The Ambas sador, in whose society he took much delight, attended him on all his expeditions ; occasionally mingling State affairs with the chase, or the masque, or the banquet ; recommending the speedy adjustment of the league with Elizabeth ; sounding him lightly on the point of his marriage ; touching on the melan choly divisions amongst his nobility, which were in creased by his continued severity to the banished lords ; and sometimes adverting, with extreme cau- 1 MS.

To the league with England, James showed the strongest inclination. It appeared to him, he said, most wise and necessary, that the \" Confederacy,\" which had recently been entered into by the various Roman Catholic Princes, to prosecute the professors of the reformed faith, should be met by a union of the Protestant powers in their defence; and when the various heads of this treaty, transmitted by Walsingham to Wotton, were laid before him, they met with his cordial approbation.1 On his marriage, he showed no disposition to speak with seriousness ; and Gray assured Wotton, that to deal lightly in that matter would be best policy, his young- master having no inclination to match himself at this moment. His mind was wholly engrossed with his pastime, hunting, and his buckhounds. Of this passion, a ludicrous outbreak occurred shortly be- fore Wotton's arrival. James, at the end of a sharp and successful run, calling for a cup of wine, drank to all his dogs ; and, in particular, selecting and tak- ing the paw of an old hound, named Tell True, who had greatly distinguished himself, he thus apostro- phized his favourite : \" Tell True, I drink to thee above all my hounds ; and would sooner trust thy tongue than either Craig or the Bishop.\" Craig was the royal chaplain, and the prelate, Montgomery 1 MS.

Also, Ibid., Thomas Miller to Archibald Douglas, 8th July, 1585."], [278, "1585. 254 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Bishop of Glasgow. This anecdote was reported again to the banished ministers of the Kirk ; and mourned over more seriously, and as pointing to a deeper depravity, than it seems to have indi cated.1 Wotton was pleased to find that James continued constant in his resolution not to enter into any asso ciation with the captive Queen ; but, on the other hand, there were two subjects on which the young monarch was immoveable, \u2014 his love for Arran, and his enmity to the banished Protestant Lords and their ministers. These were terrible stumbling-blocks in the wTay of his negotiation ; and as the conspirators sus pected that Arran was already intriguing -with France, to traverse the league with England, many secret conversations took place between the English Am bassador and the conspirators, as to the propriety of cutting off this powerful favourite at once, before he did more mischief. Wotton duly and minutely commu nicated what passed, at such interviews, to Walsing ham and Elizabeth ; and although the letters are, in many places, written in cipher, and wherever the intended murder is directly mentioned, the words have been partially scored out ; still, fortunately for the truth, we have a key to the cipher, and the erasure is often legible. Strange and revolting as it may sound to the ears of modern jurisconsults, it is nevertheless certain, that the Lord Justice-clerk 1 Calderwood MS., Brit.

Bellenden, the late Ambassador to England, and the highest criminal judge in the country, promised Wot ton to find an assassin of Arran, if he would engage that his royal mistress would protect him. Wotton was much puzzled with this, and still more embar rassed when he received a private visit from the pro posed murderer himself ; who figures in his letter as 38, and appears to have been Douglas, Provost of Lincluden.1 The English Ambassador had been carefully warned not to implicate Elizabeth, by any promises, but to leave the matter to themselves ; and as it is curious to observe how, in those times, an Ambassador informed a Secretary of State of an in tended assassination, and probed his mind as to the encouragement which should be held out, it may be interesting to give some short passages of his letter to Walsingham. \" The Tuesday, in the morning, 38 came likewise to me, that used, in effect, the same discourse that a necessity of had done before, all tending to ; which, for the weal of the realms, should be done, so that the doers of it have thanks for their labour. I propounded to him, whether he might not be better discoursed by way of justice. ' Yea,' quoth he, ' worthily for twenty of fences ; but the king will not admit such proceedings.' Then I asked if 20 [Morton] might not attempt it, seeing he was 'already engaged ; but that, for want of secrecy, he said, and distance, was full of danger. At last I perceived, by his speech, that himself wTas 1 MS. Letter, Wotton to Walsingham, June 9, 1585. Caligula, C. viii. sol. 109."], [280, "1585. 256 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. to do it * * *.

But we must not get farther involved in the meshes of this conspiracy, from which Arran escaped, at this time, by his own vigilance and the coldness of the Ambassador, who would fain have ensured the profits of success, without the responsibility of failure. In the mean time, Wotton had completely succeeded in the principal and avowed object of his mission. James had determined that the proposed league between England and his kingdom, for the defence of religion, should be concluded. He had revised and amended the various articles ; and, with the view of bringing forward the subject, had assembled a conven tion of his nobility at St Andrew's, when an event occurred, which threatened to throw all into confusion. This was the slaughter of Lord Russell in a Border affray, which took place at a meeting, or day of truce, 1 MS. Letter, Brit. Mus., sol. 195. Caligula, C. viii., 1st June, 1585. VOL. VIII.

Foster, therefore, was directed to draw up a paper, the purport of which was to show that the attack had been preconcerted;4 and Wotton did not scruple to declare to the young King, that one of the bravest noblemen of England had been murdered by the contrivance of Arran and Ferny hirst. James, who was cast down at this interruption <>f the league, and unprepared for the violence of Wotton, could not conceal or command his feelings, but shed tears like a child : protested his own inno cence ; and wished all the lords of the Borders dead, provided Lord Russell were alive again. Nor were these mere words : Arran was imprisoned in the 1 July 28. 2 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, B.C., Sir John Foster to Walsingham, 28th July. r 3 MS. Letter, St. P.

But the result rather evinced the innocence, than established the guilt, of Fernyhirst. Arran, meanwhile, bribed the Master of Gray, who procured his imprisonment at St An drew's to be exchanged for a nominal confinement to his own castle at Kinneil ; and this scheme, for the ruin of the Court favourite, bid fair, by its unex pected result, to reestablish his influence over the young King, and increase his power.1 All this fell heavily on Wotton and Walsingham. Arran had resumed his intrigues with France ; it was believed that he had adopted the interests of the imprisoned Queen ; who, as we shall immediately see, was now busily engaged in organizing that great plot for the invasion of England and her own delivery from captivity, which was known by the name of Babing ton's conspiracy. At the same moment Burghley and Walsingham, who, by intercepting Mary's let ters, had discovered her designs against their royal mistress, were occupied in weaving those toils around Mary, and possessing themselves of those proofs of her guilt, by which they trusted to bring her to the scaffold. It was to them, therefore, of the utmost consequence, that the league between England and 1 MS. Letter, St. P.

Scotland should be concluded before they made their great effort against Mary; that the young King should be bound to Elizabeth by ties for mutual defence and the maintenance of the established religion; and that Arran, and French interests and intrigues, should not repossess their power over his mind. Yet the only counterpoise to Arran, in James's affections, lay in the Master of Gray, their great tool and partisan ; and he had betrayed them. There could not be a doubt that Arran owed to him his late deliverance from prison. Gray had proved false, too, at the critical mo ment when he was privy to all their schemes against this favourite ; so that it became equally hazardous to trust him or to throw him off. What, then, was to be done ? It was necessary to act rapidly \u2014 to act decidedly ; and yet it was almost impossible for Eliza .beth's ministers to make a single move against Arran without the fear of failure. From this difficulty they were delivered by the fertile brain and flagitious prin ciples of the very man who had so recently betrayed them \u2014 the Master of Gray. He, too, had his mis givings as to the insecurity of the ground on which he stood, and in his dilemma, sought the advice of the noted Archibald Douglas, now in banishment in Eng land, the intimate friend of Walsingham, and equally familiar with the party of the banished lords and the expatriated ministers of the Kirk; who, since the fall of Morton, had found a retreat in England. To this man, who had been stained by the murder of Damley; and, since then, engaged in innumerable plots, sometimes for, and sometimes against the Queen-mother \u2014 Gray"], [285, "1585. 261 JAMES VI. addressed an extraordinary letter, which yet remains, in which he laid open his secret heart, and required his advice, as the friend he loved best in the world. He told him frankly that the Queen of England had deserted and almost ruined him. It was by her advice, and relying upon her promises of support, that he had matched himself against Arran; that he had sought Arran's life, and Arran his ; and now that he was reduced to a strait, where were all her promises? To continue to deal frankly with her was impossible ; and must lead to his overthrow. What parties, then, were left to be embraced ? \u2014 Arran, the imprisoned Queen, the French politics, the Roman Catholic in terests in Europe ? This was impossible : Arran,. although obliged to him for his recent escape, was the falsest of men, and never to be long trusted ; he knew, too, that he would have taken his life. As to the Scottish Queen, she would never trust him after his desertion ; and his perfidy was perfectly known to the whole body of the Catholics. One party only remained, by uniting himself with which, a revolution might be effected in Scotland : the party of the banish ed lords, and their expatriated friends, the ministers. of the Kirk. If Angus, Mar, and the Master of Glammis, could make up their differences with their exiled brethren, with whom they were still at feud, Lords Claud and John Hamilton, and unite in invad ing Scotland, there would be little doubt of a strong diversion in their favour. He would promise them all his influence ; it might happen, too, that he would find means to rid them of Arran ; but as to this he"], [286, "1585. 262 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. would make no stipulation. Yet, if the deed could still be done, so secretly, that his knowledge of the \" doer \" should not be suspected, he would still make the attempt. At all events, they should be joined by Bothwell and Lord Hume ; and he could promise, also, he thought, for Cessford. He concluded his letter, by assuring Douglas that this was the only plan left, which had the slightest likelihood of success; that if the exiled noblemen were ever to make the attempt, now was the time when he woidd promise them they should muster, at least, two to one against their enemies; and he ended his letter with these em phatic words : Persuade yourself, if the banished lords come down, the King shall either yield, or leave Scotland.1 This new plot was readily embraced by the ban ished lords and the ministers of the Kirk, and warmly encouraged by Wotton, the English Ambassador, who immediately communicated it to Walsingham, in a letter from Dumbarton, whither he had accom panied the young King upon a hunting party. The Master of Gray had sought him out, he said, and in formed him, that he was now convinced they had run all this while a wrong course, in seeking to disgrace Arran with the King, whose love towards him was so extreme, that he would never suffer a hair of his head to fall to the ground, if he might help it. It was evident, he continued, that as long as Arran should remain in favour with the King, it would be 1 MS. Letter, Brit. Mus., Caligula, C. viii. sol. 222, Master of Gray to Archibald Douglas, 14th August, 1585."], [287, "1585. 263 JAMES VI. impossible to bring home the lords by fair means : that, unless they might be restored, the league could neither be sure, nor the Master of Gray, and the rest of his party, in safety. For Arran, recovering the King's person, would be able, with his credit, to ruin them, and divert the King from the Queen; or, finding his affection towards her irremoveable, would not stick to convey him into France. Wotton then proceeded to inform Walsingham of Gray's new plot. It was the advice, he said, of this experienced in triguer, that her Majesty, having so good occasion ministered by the death of my Lord Russell, should pretend to take the matter very grievously, and refuse to conclude the league for this time. She might then let slip the lords, (meaning Angus and his associates,) who, with some support of money, and their friends in Scotland, might take Arran, and seize on the King's person ; in which exploit Gray promised them the best aid he and his faction could give. Gray added, that if Walsingham found this overture well liked at the English Court, he would direct a special friend of his and the exiled lords, very shortly into England, who might confer with Angus and the rest about the execution of the plot. This (continued Wotton, addressing Walsingham) was the effect of Gray's whole speech, saving that, in the end, he said, in. answer of an objection I made, that he would undertake this thing, being alone, to bring the league to a perfect conclusion.1 1 St. P.

This letter is written partly in cipher ; but I print it from the con temporary decipher written above each character or number."], [288, "264 1585. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. This letter was written on the 25th of August ; and so actively did Gray proceed with his plot, that, within a week after, it had assumed a more serious shape. In Scotland, he had gained Lord Maxwell, now known as the Earl of Morton, a powerful Border baron, who had been suspected to be in the interest of Arran. In England, not only Angus, Mar, Glammis, and their friends, were secured as actors, but also the Lords Claud and John Hamilton, the mortal enemies of Arran, who had remained in ban ishment since the year 1579, when they were for feited for the murder of the Regents Murray and Lennox. These two noblemen agreed to a reconcilia tion with Angus aud his party, with whom they had been at feud, and determined to unite against Arran. Wotton, the English Ambassador, lent to all this his active assistance ; and his letters to Walsingham, which are still preserved, present us with an interest ing picture of the growth of the conspiracy.1 Some time before this, the Earl of Morton, who was war den of the west Borders, and whose military expe rience and power was equal to most noblemen in Scotland, had incurred the resentment of the King by an attack upon the Laird of Johnston, in which he slew Captain Lammie, who commanded a com pany of the royal forces, which James had sent to reinforce Johnston. This enraged the King, who, 1 St. P. Off, Wotton to Walsingham, September 1, 1585.

This nobleman, still nominally confined to his house at Kinneil, on the charge of being accessary to Lord Russell's death, was yet daily recovering his power over the King's mind ; and it was now well known that, having been deceived and thrown off by Eliza beth, he had embraced the interests of France, from which Government he had recently received a large supply of money.4 Under his protection, Holt, Dury, and Bruce, three noted Jesuits, were secretly harboured in Scotland,5 and busily engaged in their intrigues for the restoration of the Queen-mother, 1 St. P.

Arran, as we have already seen, could organize plots, and frame secret schemes for surprise and assassination, as well as his enemies. He had been too early educated in the sanguinary and unscrupulous policy of these times not to be an adept in such matters ; and whilst Gray and Wotton were weaving their meshes round him, they knew that counter-plots were being formed against them selves, of the existence of which they were certain, although they could not detect the agents. The two great factions into which the state of Scotland was divided, were thus mutually on their guard, and jea lously watching each other ; both armed, both intent on their dark purposes, busy in gaining partisans and anticipating the designs of their opponents ; so that it seemed a race who should soonest spring the mine which was to overwhelm and destroy their adversary. In such circumstances, nothing could be more painful and precarious than the situation of Wotton, the English Ambassador. He knew, and repeatedly wrote to Walsingham, that his life was in danger. His intrigues had been partially discovered by Arran. Colonel Stewart, the brother of that nobleman, and Captain of the Royal Guard, had upbraided him for his perfidy before the King ; and although the Ambassa dor gave him the lie on the spot, the truth was too well known for any to be deceived by this bravado.2 1 Orig.

It was under the influence of such feelings that he thus addressed Walsingham : \u2014 \" Though ye in Eng land be slow in resolving, Arran and his faction sleep not out their time : for they are now gathering all the forces they can make, and, within three or four days, Arran meaneth to come to the Court, and to possess himself of the King, in despite of the Queen of England, as he saith ; which, if he do, I mean to retire myself to the Borders for the safety of my life, whereof I am in great danger, as my friends which hear the Stewarts' threatenings daily advertise me. Your Honour knoweth what a barbarous nation this is, and how little they can skill of points of honour. Where every man carrieth a pistol at his girdle, (as here they do,) it is an easy matter to kill one out of a window or door, and no man able to discover who did it. Neither doth it go for payment with those men to say, I am an Ambassador, and therefore pri vileged ; for even their Regents and Kings have been subject to their violence. \" This notwithstanding, (he continued,) I would not be so resolute to depart, if, by my tarrying, I might do her Majesty any service. But I find the King so enchanted by Arran, and myself so hated of him, as I cannot hope to negotiate to any purpose so long as Arran shall be in Court.

If the Queen of England do it not, this country will be clean lost, and all her friends wrecked. Other hope to England than in"], [292, "268 1585.

For the King presseth him greatly to meet with Arran, and threateneth, that, uiiless he do it, he shall have just cause to suspect him. But the Master assureth me he will, by one means or other, avoid it, and will hold good these fourteen days. Therefore, what ye will do, must be speedily done. \" I am not, for my own part, (he added,) the great est favourer of [violent courses,] and, therefore, have hitherto rather related other men's speeches and opin ions than given my advice.

JAMES VI. 269 John Hamilton. The Master of Gray, in the mean time, remained at Court, and played into the hands of his brother conspirators ; watching his opportuni ties, taking every advantage against the opposite faction ; communicating, through Wotton and Archi bald Douglas, with the exiled lords and the minis ters ; and keeping up an intercourse with Morton by the Provost of Lincluden, a Douglas.1 It was this same fierce partisan, who, in the former conspiracy, had been pitched upon to put Arran to death ;2 and, as Gray had declared to Douglas, his resolution to \" essay\" the same again, if it could be quietly and secretly achieved, it is not improbable that the Pro vost may have been again- engaged to further the cause by assassinating this hated person. Such be ing the ripeness of all things, Wotton, who still remained at the Scottish Court, although in daily danger of his life, wrote hastily to Walsingham, on the fifth of October, assuring him, that the King had resolved to send his forces against Morton, before the twentieth of October, and would probably lead them in person. Arran, he added, was to be libe rated ; and if the lords meant to surprise him, and strike the blow with any hope of success, it must be done instantly.3 These arguments had the desired effect ; and 1 St. P.

Elizabeth, being assured that no time was to be lost, commanded her Ambassador to require an audience of the King of Scots, and make a peremptory demand for the delivery into her hands of Ker of Fernyhirst, whom she stigmatized as the murderer of Lord Russell. It was certain that this would be refused; and her object was to afford a pretext for the retire ment of Wotton from the Scottish Court, at the moment when the conspiracy, which he had organized with such persevering activity, was to take effect.1 But matters framed themselves otherwise. Early in October, the banished lords, Angus, Mar, and the Master of Glammis, who wei*e then in London, re ceived Elizabeth's permission to set out on their enterprise ; but by the advice of the ministers of the Kirk, their companions in exile, they first held an exercise of humiliation at Westminster, and, with many tears, (so writes the historian of the Kirk,) besought God to strengthen their arm, and grant them success against their enemies.2 They then set forward, accompanied by their ministers, Mr Andrew Melvil, Mr Patrick Galloway, and Mr Walter Bal canquel; and pressing forward to Berwick, met there with the Hamiltons and their forces. These movements could not be concealed; and the tidings flying quickly into Scotland, became known to the King and the English Ambassador at the same moment. It was a stirring and remarkable 1 Copy, St. P. Off, 12th Oct., 1585, WTotton to Walsingham. Also, Draft, 11th Oct., 1585, Walsingham to Wotton. 2 Calderwood, MS.

James, by this time, was fully aware of the intrigues of Wotton ; and resolving to make him a hostage for his own security, gave orders to seize the Ambassador in his house, and carry him with the army, which was then on the point of marching against Mor ton. Wotton, however, received intimation of his dan ger. At night-fall he threw himself upon a fleet horse ; gallopped to Berwick, and, from that city, wrote in much agitation to Walsingham and the Queen ; de claring that he had been plunged into the greatest difficulty by the reports of the advance of the lords : that he knew the King meant to arrest him, and that he had preferred rather to flee from Scotland, and peril her Majesty's displeasure, than to remain and thus bring ruin upon the common cause.1 All was now confusion at Court. Arran, break ing from his ward, hurried from Kinneil to Court. and rushing into the young King's presence, declared that the banished lords were already in Scotland, and rapidly coming forward with their forces ; accused the Master of Gray as the author of the whole con spiracy, and urged James to send for him instantly and put him to death.2 Gray was then absent from Court, raising his friends in Perthshire, and was thrown into perplexity and agitation on receiving the King's message. If he disobeyed it, he dreaded the overthrow of the plot, and the retreat of Angus and his friends; if he returned to Court, he cast 1 St. P.

Yet, choosing the boldest, which in such a crisis is generally the most successful course, he braved the peril, rode back to Court, entered the royal presence, defended himself from the accusation, and was so graciously received, that Arran and his faction had determined, as their last hope, to stab him even in the King's presence,1 when a messenger arrived in fiery haste, with the news that the advanced parties of the banished lords had been seen within a mile of Stirling. They had first met at Kelso, separated to raise their men, concentrated their whole troops at Falkirk on the 31st October, and, from this, marched towards that city at the head of eight thousand men. To resist such a force would have been absurd. Arran knew that his head was the only mark they shot at ; that he was surrounded by enemies within, as well as without the town ; and that his life was not safe for a moment. As the only resource left him, therefore, he fled secretly from Stirling, accom panied by a single horseman. His retreat was fol lowed by the instant occupation and plunder of the town by Angus and his forces ; whilst Montrose, Crawford, and the other lords of the opposite faction, threw themselves, as their last resource, into the castle ; which (to use the Master of Gray's own ex pression) was in a manner crammed full of great personages with the King \u2014 some friends, some ene mies.2 Preparations for a siege were now com- 1 Relation of the Master of Gray, by Bannatyne Club, p. 59. 2 Ibid. p. 60."], [297, "1585. 273 JAMES VI. menced ; and the lords had already set up their banners against the \" spur,\" or principal bastion, when the King sent out the Master of Gray with a flag of truce, to demand the cause of their coming. They replied, it was to offer their duty to his Ma jesty, and kiss his hands : to which it was answered, that the King was not at that moment solicitous of an interview ; but if they would retire for a brief space, their lands and honours should be restored. Still, however, they insisted on a personal interview, and James declared his readiness to agree to it on three conditions : safety to his own person; no in novation to be made in the State ; and an assurance for the lives of such persons as he should name. To the twTo first they instantly consented ; to the last, they replied, that as they were the injured persons, and their enemies were about the King, they must, for their own security, have them delivered into their hands, with the castles and strengths of the realm.1 This negotiation, which was conducted bv Grav, the arch-contriver of the whole plot, could only terminate in one way. James was forced to submit : the gates were opened, the Earls of Montrose, Crawford, and Rothes, with Lord Down, Sir William Stewart, and others, made prisoners ; and the banished lords con ducted into the King's presence. On their admis sion, they fell on their knees ; and Lord Arbroath, the head of the house of Hamilton, taking prece dency from his near alliance to the crown, entreated 1 Relation of the Master of Gray.

It was strange to see men who, a few hours before, with arms in their hands, had dictated terms of submission to their So vereign, now sue so submissively for mercy : but the scene was well acted on both sides ; and James, an early adept in hypocrisy, performed his part with much address. \" My Lord,\" said he to Hamilton, \" I never saw you before ; but you were a. faithful servant of the Queen my mother, and of all this company have been the most wronged. But for the rest of you, (casting his glance over the circle on their knees,) if you have been exiles, was it not your own fault ?

Arran was proclaimed a traitor at the Market-place, and in the King's name ; the royal guard altered, and its com mand given to the Master of Glammis ; the Castle of Dumbarton delivered to Lord Arbroath ; that of 1 Spottiswood, pp. 342, 34?."], [299, "1585. 275 JAMES VI.

On the same day, a pacifica tion and remission was published in favour of the exiles, who now ruled everything at their pleasure. All faults were solemnly forgiven ; and the whole of the measures lately carried into effect with such speed and success, declared to be done for the King's service.1 Immediately after the seizure of Stirling, the Mas ter of Gray communicated the entire success of the plot to the English Court, by letters to the Queen herself, Archibald Douglas, and Secretary Walsing ham. He assured the English Secretary, that the banished men were in as good favour as they ever enjoyed : nothing was now required but that Elizabeth should send an Ambassador, and the intended league between the two kingdoms would be concluded with out delay.2 The Queen accordingly despatched Sir William Knolles, who had audience at Lithgow on the 23d November, and was received by James with much courtesy. The King professed himself to be entirely at her Majesty's devotion ; declared he was ready to join in league with England, both in matters of reli gion and civil policy ; and that although at first offended at the sudden invasion of Angus and his friends, he was now satisfied that they sought only their own restitution, and, indeed, had found them so loving and obedient, that he had rather reason to bless God so great a revolution had been effected 1 Relation of the Master of Gray, p. 61. 2 St. P.

Knolles, too, as far as he had an opportunity of judging, considered these declara tions sincere. He observed no distrust on the part either of the Lords or their Sovereign. They kept no guard round him, but suffered him to hunt daily with a moderate train ; and as Arran had fled to the west coast, and Montrose, Crawford, and the rest of that party were in custody, no fear of change or attack seemed to be entertained.1 Such was Knolles' opinion ; although, in the end of his letter, he hinted that the King might dissemble according to his custom; a suspicion which next day seemed to have increased.2 Apparently, however, these misgivings were without foundation ; for a Par liament assembled shortly after at Linlithgow, in which it was unanimously resolved there should be a strict league concluded with Elizabeth.3 On this occasion, the King, if we may judge from his address to the three Estates, expressed extraordinary de votedness to England, and the most determined hostility to the Roman Catholics. He alluded to the confederating together of the \" bastard Christians,\" (to use his own words,) meaning, as he said, the Papists, in a league, which they termed holy, for the subversion of true religion in all realms through the 1 St. P.

These leagues, he observed, were com posed of Frenchmen and Spaniards, assisted with the money of the King of Spain and the Pope, and must be resisted, if Protestants had either conscience, ho nour, or love of themselves. To this end, he was de termined, he said, to form a counter-league, in which he was assured all Christian Princes would willingly join ; and as the Queen of England was not only a true Christian Princess, but nearest to them, of all others, in consanguinity, neighbourhood, and goodwill, it was his fixed resolution to begin with her.1 To second this, the King despatched Sir William Keith with a friendly message to the English Queen ; requesting her to send down an Ambassador, by whose good offices the proposed treaty might be carried into effect :2 aud Randolph, whose veteran experience in Scottish diplomacy was considered as peculiarly qua lifying him for such an errand, was intrusted with the negotiation. He arrived in Edinburgh on the 26th February, having been met at Musselburgh, six miles from the capital, by the Justice-clerk, and a troop of forty or fifty gentlemen, many of them be longing to the royal household. The English Ambassador was prepared to find his mission one of no easy execution ;3 for in the interval between the Parliament at Lithgow and his arrival at 1 Copy, St. P.

An Ambassador had beensentfrom France, and was reported to have brought with him a golden freight of French crowns. Holt, the Jesuit, and other brethren of that order, were still secretly harboured in the north, supported by Huntley, Montrose, Crawford, and other nobles of the Roman Catholic faith ; the agents of the Queen-mother were busy with their intrigues both in Scotland and in England ; and Morton, that powerful baron, whose union with Angus and the Hamiltons had so recently turned the scale against Arran, presuming upon his recent success, openly professed the Roman Catholic faith, and caused mass to be celebrated in the Provost Church of Lincluden.1 All these were ominous appearances; and, although James had instantly summoned Morton, and im prisoned him in Edinburgh Castle, yet the King was known to be so great a dissembler, that few trusted his professions. Randolph had been instructed by his royal mistress to congratulate the monarch upon the quiet state of his realm ; to express her willingness to proceed with the treaty, for a firm and lasting religious league between the two kingdoms, which had been interrupted ; and to warn him against the intrigues of France. He was also to require the delivery of Fernyhirst, who, she still insisted, was guilty of the murder of Lord Rus sell ; to urge James to prosecute Morton for his late 1 Spottiswood, p. 344.

In return for all this, should it be faithfully performed, Elizabeth declared her readiness to fix a yearly pension on the King, and to grant a solemn promise, under her hand and seal, that she would permit no measures to be brought forward against any title he might pretend to the English Crown.1 On being admitted to an audience, which took place the third day after his arrival, Randolph, at first, found nothing but smiles and fair weather at Court. The King assured him, that he felt himself bound to the Queen his mistress, as strictly as if she were his own sister ; that he esteemed her advice the best he could possibly receive, and meant, God will ing, to follow it.2 Having spoken this so loud, that most that stood by could hear it, James, entering into more private talk, told him of the arrival of the French Ambassador, and spoke slightingly of his youth and ignorance of Scotland and Scotsmen. This led to some remarks on the house of Guise, and the intrigues of the Jesuits ; to which the King answered, he had but one God to serve ; and as for the Papists, that Morton himself, and some others, would be ar- 1 Original Draft, St. P.

Before the audience was concluded, Randolph exhibited a little packet, \" curi ously sealed and made up,\" which he gallantly pressed to his lips, and delivered to the young monarch. It was a private letter from Elizabeth, which James, stepping aside, read with every appearance of devo tion ; and, placing it in his bosom, declared that all his good sister's desires should be fulfilled.1 These fair professions, however, were not fully to be trusted ; for Randolph, in a subsequent conversation with Secretary Maitland and Bellenden the Justice clerk, became aware that great offers had been made to the young King by France ; and that, although the royal hand was, as yet, uncontaminated by French gold, the Court necessities were so urgent, that it was not certain how long this magnanimity might continue. These counter intrigues, however, were, for the present, defeated ; and the Ambassador, with great address, procured the King's signature to the league with England, and sent Thomas Milles his assistant and secretary to present it to Elizabeth for her ratifica tion.2 Milles was, at the same time, instructed to warn the English Queen to have special care, at that moment, of her own person ; and to reveal the parti culars of a conspiracy against her, which was then hatching in Scotland. On this delicate point the Ambassador wrote, both to Burghley and Walsing ham : but he referred simply to Milles's verbal report, 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Randolph to .

JAMES VI. 281 and added to the English Secretary this ominous sen tence: \" The men, and, perchance, the women, are yet living, and their hearts and minds all one, that devised orprocuredthedevilishmischiefsthat hitherto, by God's providence, she hath escaped. You have heard, both out of Spain and France, what is to be doubted out of the Low Countries. I have seen what warning hath been given for her Majesty to look unto herself; and, in the presence of God, I fear as much despite and devilishness from hence as from them all; though I judge the King as free as myself, and could himself be content that he Were out of this country.\" l These disclosures of Milles to Elizabeth unfortu nately do not appear ; but there can be no doubt that they were connected with that conspiracy after wards known as \" Babington's plot.\" It is certain that this plot had its ramifications in Scotland ; that the captive Queen had still a powerful party in that kingdom, at the head of which was Lord Claud Hamilton; and many of her adherents were busily intriguing with France, Spain, and Rome. The league with England was distasteful to Se cretary Maitland and a large portion of the nobility. They maintained, aud Avith great appearance of reason, that the King, before he had been so readily induced to sign a treaty of so much importance, ought to have secured some commercial privileges to his subjects, similar to those enjoyed by them in France; that Elizabeth should have made some public and explicit declaration regarding their master's title to 1 St. T.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. the English Crown ; and that the annuity which he was to receive ought to bear some proportion to the large offers of those foreign princes, which his adhe rence to England had compelled him to refuse. All this, they said, he had neglected ; and, without con sulting his Council, had recklessly rushed into a treaty which he would speedily repent.1 This threat seemed prophetic : on Milles's arrival with Elizabeth's signa ture to the league, James discovered that the pension which, as first promised by Wotton, amounted to twenty thousand crowns, had dwindled down to four thousand pounds; and the same envoy brought the King a private letter, written with her own hand, in terms of such severe and sarcastic admonition, that it utterly disgusted and enraged him.2 It was pre sented by Randolph, in an interview which he had with James in the garden of the palace ; and, as he read it, the young monarch colouring with anger, swore \"by God,\" that, had he known what little account the Queen would make of him, she should have waited long enough before he had signed any league, or disobliged his nobles, to reap nothing but disappointment and contempt. This fit of disgust was fostered, as may easily be believed, by Secretary Maitland and his friends, and it required all the address of Randolph to soften the 1 St. P.

At last, however, everything was arranged, and the Ambassador, in a letter to Walsingham, congratulating himself upon a speedy return home, advised this minister to be careful in the choice of his successor at the Scottish Court. \" Your honour knows,\" said he, \" that non ess omni ligno ft Mer curius; and he has need of a long spoon that feeds with the Devil.\"1 Having procured the young King's signature to the articles of the league, Randolph left the Scottish Court; and in the succeeding month the negotiation was finally concluded by the Commissioners of both coun tries, who met at Berwick.2 In this important treaty it was agreed between the Queen of England and the Scottish King, that they should inviolably maintain the religion now professed in both countries against all adversaries, notwithstanding any former engage ments to the contrary. If any invasion should be made into their dominions, or any injuries should be offered them by foreign Princes or States, no aid was to be given to such foreign attack by either of the contracting parties, whatever league, affinity, or friendship, might happen to exist between them and such foreign powers. If England were invaded by a foreign enemy, in any part remote from Scotland, 1 St. P. Off, Randolph to Walsingham, 28th May, 1586, Edin burgh. 2 Camden's Elizabeth, in Kennet, vol. ii. p. 513. MS.

If Ireland should be invaded, all Scottish subjects were to be inter dicted, under pain of rebellion, from passing over into that kingdom. All rebels harboured within either country, were to be delivered up, or compelled to de part the realm. No contract was to be made by either of the Princes, with any foreign State, to the preju dice of this league. All former treaties of amity between the predecessors of the two Princes were to remain in force ; and on the Scottish King's attain ing the age of twenty-five, he engaged, that the '\u25a0 league should be confirmed by Parliament; his sister, the English Queen, promising the same for her part.\"1 It will be observed, that all consideration of the condition or interests of the unhappy Queen of Scots is studiously avoided both by her son and by Eliza beth. Indeed her name does not appear to have been once alluded to during the whole transactions. It will, however, be seen by the sequel, that although no reference was openly made to Mary, the main 1 MS.

The happy conclusion of this league was a matter of sincere congratulation to the English Queen ; but she had intrusted to Randolph another somewhat difficult negotiation. This was to induce James to recall and pardon the noted Archibald Douglas, whom she had herself recently imprisoned, but who had purchased his freedom by betraying the secrets of the Scottish Queen. This gentleman, with whose name and his tory we are already in some degree familiar, united the manners of a polished courtier to the knowledge of a scholar and a statesman. He was of an ancient and noble house ; he had been for years the friend and correspondent of Burghley and Walsingham ; and he was now in great credit with the English Queen. But Douglas had a dark as wrell as a bright side ; and exhibited a contradiction or anomaly in character by no means unfrequent in those days : the ferocity of a feudal age, gilded or lacquered over by a thin coating of civilisation. Externally all was polish and amenity ; truly and at heart the man was a sanguinary, fierce, crafty, and unscrupulous villain. He had been personally present at Darnley's murder, although he only admitted the foreknowledge of it; he had been bred as a retainer of the infamous Bothwell; he had afterwards been employed by the Scottish Queen, whom he sold to her enemies ; and Elizabeth's great purpose in now interceding for his return from her Court to his own country, wras to use his influence"], [310, "1586. 286 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. with the young King against his mother and her faction. He now brought a letter written by that Princess to the King in his favour -,1 and it is little to James's credit, that he speedily obtained all he asked. A mock trial was got up; a sentence of acquittal pronounced ; and Douglas was not only restored to his estates and rank, but admitted into the highest confidence with the Sovereign, whose father he had murdered. Nay, strange to tell, James held a secret conversation with him on the dark subject of Darnley's assassination; and as Douglas instantly sent a report of it to Walsingham, we get behind the curtain. The King commanded all the courtiers to retire ; and, finding himself alone with Douglas, after reading the Queen of England's letter, thus addressed him : \" At your departure, I was your enemy; and now, at your returning, I am and shall be your friend. You are not ignorant what the laws of this realm are, and what best may agree with your honour to be clone for your surety. I must confess her Ma jesty's request in your favour to be honourable and favourable, and your desire to have come by assize ~ to be honest ; and I myself do believe that you are innocent of my father's murder, except in fore knowledge and concealing ; an fault so common in those days, that no man of any dealing could mis- 1 MS.

It is evident the King kept at a distance from all direct mention of his mother's name. The general expressions which he used may either infer that the Queen must have known of the intended murder, but could not, Avith out imminent peril, have revealed or prevented it, or that she kneAV and permitted it. As to Douglas's own active share in the murder, it was positively asserted by his servant on the scaffold, and at a moment when there could be no temptation to deny or disguise the truth, that he was present at the ex plosion, and returned from it covered with soil and dust. 1 Misknaw; be ignorant. 2 MS.

Elizabeth, as has been already hinted, had a great purpose in view, wdien she concluded this league and sent Archibald Douglas into Scotland. Two months before, her indefatigable minister, Walsingham, had detected that famous conspiracy known by the name of \" Babington's plot,\" in which Mary AAras implicated, and for which she aften\\rards suffered. It had been resolved by Leicester, Burghley, and Walsingham, and probably by the Queen herself, that this should be the last plot of the Scottish Queen and the Ro- man Catholic faction ; that the time had come when sufferance Avas criminal and weak ; that the life of the unfortunate, but still active and formidable cap- tive, Avas inconsistent Avith Elizabeth's safety and the liberty of the realm. Hence the importance attached to this league, which bound the tAATo kingdoms to gether, in a treaty offensiA'e and defensive, for the protection of the Protestant faith, and separated the"], [313, ".1586. 289 JAMES VI. young King from his mother. Hence the eagerness for the return and pardon of Archibald Douglas, who had sold himself to Elizabeth, betrayed the secrets of Mary, and hoav offered his influence over James to be employed in furthering this great design for her destruction. It is noAv necessary to enter upon the history of this plot, and Mary's alleged connexion with it, \u2014 one of the most involved and intricate portions in the history of the two countries. To be clear, and prevent the mind from getting entangled in the inextricable meshes of Walsingham and his informers, it will be proper for a moment to look back. Mary had now been nineteen years a captive ; and, upon the cruelty aud illegality of her imprisonment during this long and dreary period, there can be but one opinion. She was seized and imprisoned during a time of peace ; contrary to eATery feeling of generosity, and in flagrant violation of every principle of laAV and justice. On the one hand, it was the right and the duty of such a prisoner to attempt every possible means for her escape ; on the other, it Avas both natural and just that the Catholic party, in England and Scotland, should have combined with France and Spain to deliver her from her captivity, and avenge upon Elizabeth such an outrage on the law of nations as the seizure of a free Princess. But the same party regarded Elizabeth as a heretic, Avhose Avhole life had been obstinately opposed to the truth. Some of them went so far as to consider her an illegitimate usurper, whose throne belonged to the Queen of Scots. vol. vni. v"], [314, "290 1586. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. They had plotted, therefore, not only for Mary's deliverance, but for the reestablishment of their oavii faith in England, and for Elizabeth's deposition; nay, some of them, mistaking fanaticism for religion, against Elizabeth's life. All these conspiracies con tinued more or less during the whole period of Mary's captivity, and had been detected by the vigilance of Elizabeth's ministers, acting through the system of private spies ; one of the most revolting features of an age which regarded craft and treachery as necessary parts of political Avisdom. With all these plots, the Queen of Scots had been in some degree either directly or indirectly connected : her rival felt acutely (and such a feeling was the retributive punishment of the AArrong she had committed) the misery of keeping so dangerous a prisoner ; but up to this time, there seems to have been no allegation that Mary Avas implicated in anything affecting Eliza beth's life, anything more, in short, than a series of plots continued at different times for her own escape. Nor did Elizabeth very highly resent them. So far at least from adopting the extreme measures to which she had been advised by many of her councillors, she had repeatedly entered into negotiations AATth her royal captive, in Avhich she held out the hope of her liberty on the one hand; whilst Mary, on the other, promised not only to forsake all connexion with pub lic affairs, and leave the government to her son, but to impart to her good sister the most valuable secret information. These scenes had been so repeatedly begun, and repeatedly broken off, that they had be-"], [315, "1586. JAMES VI. 291 come almost matters of yearly form. On both sides, in all this, there Avas probably much suspicion and insincerity ; but chiefly on the part of Elizabeth : for Mary, at last sinking under the soitoaats of so long a captivity, and worn out by deferred hope, became ready to pay the highest price for freedom ; to give up the Avorld, to sink into priA'ate life, to sacrifice all except her religion, and her title to the throne. It was on this principle, that she Avas ready to enter into that agreement Avith her son already alluded to, and known by the name of \" the Associ ation.\" By the terms of this, James was to continue King ; his mother resigning her right into his hands, and taking up her residence, Avith an alloAvance according to her rank, either in England or Scotland. Elizabeth, to whom the Avhole design was communi cated, and who Avas included as a party to the treaty, Avas to release the Scottish Queen, resume with her the friendly relations which had been so often broken off, and receiAre, in return, such general good advice, and such secret revelations, as Mary could give con sistently with fidelity to her friends. Noav, at the very time when this association seemed to be concluded ; when the hopes of the un happy captive Avere at the highest ; Avhen she was looking fonvard to her liberty with the delight \" which the opening of the prison brings to them that are bouud,\" the cup, for the hundredth time, was dashed from her lips.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. an attempt against the life of the English Queen ; and the covenant, or \"association,\" for the defence of Eliza beth's person, was concluded at the urgent instance of Leicester, by Avhich \" men of all degrees through out England bound themselves, by mutual vows and subscriptions, to prosecute to the death all AArho should directly or indirectly attempt anything against their Sovereign.\" It was in vain that Mary dis claimed all connexion with these plots, affirming passionately, and apparently sincerely, that it would be cruel to hold her responsible for all the wild attempts of the Roman Catholic faction who pro fessed to be her friends, but did not inform her of their proceedings ; in ATain, that she offered to sign the Association for Elizabeth's safety, and act upon it as if she were her dearest sister. She was met by a cold refusal ; the treaty for her freedom Avas abandoned ; the Master of Gray, and Archibald Douglas, men whom she had implicitly trusted, were bribed to betray her most private transactions ; and, as the last and bitterest ingredient in her misery, her own son broke off all intercourse with her, threw himself into the arms of the English Queen, and, by the \" League\" which we have just seen concluded, became the sworn pensioner of her enemy, and the avoAved persecutor of that religion which she firmly belieA'ed to be the truth. Are we to Avonder that, under such circumstances, she renounced her promises to Elizabeth, and, as a last resource, encouraged the Roman Catholics to resume their projects for the invasion of England, her delivery from captivity, and"], [317, "1586. 293 JAMES AT. the restoration of Avhat she belieATed the only true Church ? It is certain, that tAVO years before this, in 1584, she had been cognizant of Throckmorton's plot already al luded to, and got up by the English Catholic refugees in Spain and France for the invasion of England, the dethronement of Elizabeth, and her oavii delivery. One of the principal managers of this conspiracy AA7as Thomas Morgan, a devoted Catholic, Mary's agent on the continent, a man deeply attached to her inter ests, and who had been long trained in the school of political intrigue. The rest were Francis Throck morton, Avho suffered for it ; Thomas, Lord Paget ; Charles Arundel, Avho fled to France ; and some others. It is extremely difficult to discover what portion of the plot was real, and what fictitious ;\u25a0 but that schemes were in agitation against Elizabeth, in which the Spanish Ambassador, Mendoza, parti cipated, and Avith which Mary was Avell acquainted, cannot be doubted. So clear did her servant Mor gan's guilt appear to the King of France, in AArhose dominions he then resided, that although he refused to deliver him up as Elizabeth required, he threw him into prison, sent his papers to England, and treated him with much severity. Even in this durance, he managed to continue his secret practices ; but Mary, Avho had iioav entered into negotiations Avith the Queen for her liberty, renounced, for a season, all political intrigue ; and the smouldering embers of the recent conspiracies were allowed to cool and burn out, whilst she looked fonvard Avith sanguine hope"], [318, "1586. 294 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ' to her freedom. When, hoAveA'er, this hope was blasted; when she was removed from the gentler custody of the Earl of Shrewsbury to the severer jailorship of Paulet ; x when she was haunted by re ports of private assassination, and at last saw Eliza beth and her son indissolubly leagued against her, she resumed her correspondence Avith Morgan, and welcomed every possible project for her escape.2 At this time, Walsingham, the English Queen's principal Secretary, had brought the system of secret information to a state of high perfection, if Ave may use such an expression on the subject. The Queen of Scots, the French and Spanish Ambassadors, the English Roman Catholic refugees, were all surround ed by his creatures, who insinuated themselves into their confidence, pretended to join their plots, drew them on to reATeal their secrets, and carried all they kneAV to their employers. Amongst these base tools of Walsingham, were Poley, a man who had found means to gain the ear and the confidence of Morgan, and been employed by him in his secret correspondence with the Catholics of England and France ; 3 Gilbert Gifford, a seminary priest of a good family in Staf fordshire, who Avas also intrusted by Morgan with his secrets; Maud, a sordid wretch, who pretended great zeal for the Catholic faith ; and some others. 1 In October, 1584, Mary was removed from the Castle of Sheffield to Wingfield.

He AAras also assisted by Thomas Phelipps, a person of extraordinary skill in detecting real, and concoct ing false plots by forging imaginary letters, and of equal talent in discovering the key to the most diffi cult and complicated ciphers. In his service, too, was one Gregory, who, by reiterated practice, had acquired the faculty of breaking and replacing seals with such nicety, that no eye could suspect the frac ture.1 By means of these agents Walsingham, about the same time that the league had been concluded between Elizabeth and the King of Scots, discovered a conspiracy for the assassination of that Princess. Of this atrocious design, Ballard, a seminary priest, and Savage, an English officer who had served in the Netherlands, were the principal movers; but Mor gan, Mary's agent, undoubtedly encouraged the plot, and drew into it some of the English Catholic refu gees. At the same time, the former great project for the invasion of England, the dethronement of Eliza beth, and the escape of Mary, was resumed by Spain, France, and the Scottish Queen's Catholic friends in England and Scotland ; and the captive Princess herself became engaged in a secret correspondence on this subject Avith Morgan, Charles Paget, Sir Francis Englefield, and the French and Spanish Ambassadors.

Amongst these last, up to a cer tain date which can be fixed, we must undoubtedly class the Scottish Queen. She was fully aAvare, and indeed Avas an active agent in the schemes AAdiich Avere in agitation for the invasion of the country, and her OAvn deliverance ; 1 but she Avas ignorant at first of any designs against the life of her enemy.2 Whether to the last she remained so ignorant of all, has been disputed ; but, in the mean time, the predicament in which she stood, as all must see, was one of extreme peril, and so the result proved. Walsingham, through his spies, became acquainted with both plots ; and his fertile and unscrupulous mind, assisted and prompted by such an instrument as Phelipps, pro jected a scheme for involving Mary in a knowledge of both, and thus drawing her on to her ruin. Such being the general design, let us iioav look more mi nutely into the history and proceedings of the con spirators. John Savage, a Roman Catholic gentleman, Avho had served in the Avars of the Loav Countries, becom ing acquainted with some fanatical priests of the Jesuit seminary of Rheims, Avas induced, by their 1 MS.

They argued that the Papal bull, by Avhich this Princess Avas excommunicated, Avas dic tated by the Holy Spirit ; and that to slay any per son thus anathematized must be accounted an act of faith, and not of murder. Savage, thus worked upon, took a solemn vow that he would kill the Queen ; and prepared to return to England for the purpose.1 Previous to his departure, howeA-er, John Ballard, a priest of the same seminary, and a busy agent of Morgan, returned to France, from a tour which he had made amongst the Catholics of England and Scotland. The purpose of his mission thither had been to organize the plot for the invasion of Eng land ; the object of his return Avas to confer upon the same subject with Mendoza the Spanish Ambas sador, Charles Paget, and the other English Catholic refugees. Ballard was accompanied by Maud, the person already mentioned as a spy of Walsingham, who had deceived Ballard and Morgan, by pretend ing a great zeal for the Catholic cause ; and through this base person the English Secretary became ac quainted Avith all their proceedings.2 Paget being consulted, argued strongly that no invasion could succeed during the lifetime of Elizabeth ; and Bal lard, assuming the disguise of a soldier, and taking 1 Carte, vol. iii. p. 601 ; and MS.

Soon after his arrival, Ballard addressed himself to Anthony Babington, a young gentleman of large fortune, and ancient Catholic family, in Derbyshire, who had before this shown great zeal and activity in the service of the Queen of Scots. This was known to Ballard ; and he, therefore, confidently opened to him the great scheme for the invasion of England ; explained the ardour with which it had been resumed by Morgan and the Scottish Queen ; and exhorted him to second their efforts by every means in his power. Babington, it is certain, had been long warmly devoted to Mary. He had formed, when he Avas in France, an intimate friendship with Morgan ; had been introduced to Beaton the Bishop of Glas gow, her Ambassador in that country ; and had re turned to England Avith letters from both these per sons, which strongly recommended him to the Scot tish Queen. From this time, for the period of two years, he had continued to supply her Avith secret intelligence, and to receive and convey her letters to her friends.1 Latterly, however, all intercourse had been broken off; whether for some private cause, or on account of the greater strictness of Mary's con finement, does not appear certain. This interrup tion of Mary's correspondence with Babington had, however, given distress to Morgan ; and most unfor- 1 Hardwicke's Papers, vol. i. p. 227."], [323, "1586. 299 JAMES AT. tunately, as it happened for the Scottish Queen, he had written to her, in urgent terms, on the 9th of May, 1586, advising her to renew her secret inter course with him, and describing him as a gentleman on Avhose ability and high honour she might have the firmest reliance.1 On being sought out by Ballard, Babington evinced all his former eagerness for the service of the captive Queen ; but expressed strongly the same opinion as that already given by Charles Paget, that no inva sion or rising in England could succeed as long as Elizabeth liAred. Ballard then communicated to him Savage's purpose of assassination ; adding, that the gentleman who had solemnly bound himself to de spatch that Princess was noAV in England. This revelation produced an immediate effect ; and Bab ington expressed a decided opinion that the simul taneous execution of both plots held out the fairest prospect of success. It would be dangerous, how ever, he said, to intrust the assassination to only one hand : it might fail, and all would be lost. He sug gested, therefore, an improvement, by which the murder should be committed by six gentlemen of his acquaintance, of whom Savage should be one ; whilst he pointed out the best havens where foreign troops might be landed ; summed up the probable native force with which they were likely to be joined ; and demonstrated the surest plan for the escape of the 1 Murdin, p. 513.

Scottish Queen.1 With all this Ballard was highly pleased ; and from the time when the first meeting with Babington took place,2 he and Babington em ployed themselves in discovering, amongst their acquaintance, such men as they deemed likely to engage in this abominable design. Three were soon procured to join with Savage. Their names were Abingdon, the son of the late cofferer of the Queen's household ; BaniAvell, who was connected Avith a noble family in Ireland; and Charnock, a Catholic gentleman in Lancashire.3 Some time after, the number of six was made up by the addition of Charles Tilney, one of the Queen's band of gentlemen pen sioners; and Chidiock Titchbourne. Other gentle men of their acquaintance were engaged to assist in the project for the invasion, and the escape of Mary ; but the darker purpose of assassination AAras not re vealed to them. During all this time, Mary, on account of the strictness of her confinement under Sir Amias Paulet, had found it extremely difficult to continue her cor respondence with her friends abroad; but she had never abandoned the project of the Spanish invasion : and on the 5th May, she addressed a letter to Charles Paget, giving minute directions regarding the likeliest method of succeeding in their common enterprise 1 Murdin, p. 513.

They deArelop the AA'hole plot for the invasion of England, and exhibit a determination in her designs against Elizabeth, which, Avhen known, (as they came to be by the interception of the letter,) could not fail to excite extreme resentment. \" With an infinite number of other letters in cipher, (so she addressed Paget,) I received five of yours, dated the 14th January, 16th of May, and last of July 1585. and the 4th of February 1586.

I should think myself most obliged to the King of Spain, that it Avould please him to receive my son, to make him be instructed and reduced to the Catholic religion, which is the thing in the world I most desire ; affecting a great deal rather the salvation of his soul than to see him monarch of all Europe ; and I fear much, that so long as he shall remain where he is, (amongst those that found all his greatness upon the maintenance of the religion which he professeth.) it shall never be in my power to bring him in again to the right way ; whereby there shall remain in my heart a thousand regrets and apprehensions, if I should die, to leave behind me a tyrant and persecutor of the Catholic Church. \" If you see and perceive the said Ambassador to have c/oust in these overtures, and put you in hope of a good ansAver thereunto, which you shall insist to have with all diligence, I would then, in the mean"], [328, "1586. 304 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. time, you should write to the Lord Claud, letting him understand how that the King of Spain is to set on this country, and desireth to haATe the assistance of the Catholics of Scotland, for to stop, at least, that from thence the Queen of England have no suc cours ; and to that effect, you shall pray the said Lord Claud to sound and grope the minds hereunto of the principal of the Catholic nobility in Scotland. * * * And to the end they may be the more en couraged herein, you may write plainly to the Lord Claud, that you have charge of me to treat with him of this matter.

The vigour and ability with which the whole is laid doAvn, needs no comment ; and the Scottish Queen omitted no opportunity to encourage her friends in that great enterprise which was now re garded as the forlorn hope for the recoA-ery of her liberty, and the restoration of the Catholic faith in Britain.2 All this time, hoA\\Tever, Mary had no com munication with Ballard. He had been specially warned not to attempt to hold any intercourse with the Queen ; and she had been informed by Morgan, in a letter written from his prison, that such an agent was in England labouring busily in her behalf, but that there were strong reasons why she should avoid, for the present, all communication with him. \" He followeth (said he) some matters of consequence, the issue whereof is uncertain ; wherefore, as long as 1 MS.

And I have specially warned the said Ballard (he continued) not to deal at any hand with your Majesty, as long as he fol loAveth the affairs that he and others have in hand, which tend to do good, which I pray God may come to pass ; and so shall your Majesty be relieved by the power of God.\"1 In a postscript of a letter of Morgan's to Curie, Mary's French secretary, written on the same, which was intercepted and deciphered by Phelipps, an indi rect allusion was made to these practices of Ballard against the life of Elizabeth. \" I am not unoccu pied (said he) although I be in prison, to think of her Majesty's state, and yours that endure with her, to your honours ; and there be many means in hand to remove the beast that troubleth all the icorld.\"' But although Mary, thus warned, prudently ab stained from any communications Avith Ballard, she continued in active correspondence Avith Morgan, Englefield, Mendoza, Paget, and Persons, on the sub ject of \" the great enterprise.\" The principal person through Avhom she transmitted her letters was Gil- 1 Morgan to the Queen of Scots, Murdin, p. 527, 2 MS.

Her letters accordingly Avere regularly intercepted, deciphered by Phelipps, copied, considered by Wal singham, and then fonvarded to their destination.1 The English minister, therefore, was quite as Avell accainted Avith the plot for the invasion of the realm, and the insurrection of the Roman Catholics, as the conspirators themselATes. He knew, also, the desperate designs of Ballard, Babington, and his fellows, against the Queen's life ; yet, as Mary had abstained from all intercourse with the conspirators, there was no evi dence to connect her with their designs. There might be presumptions against her ; (and it seems to me impossible for any one to have read Morgan's allusion to the secret designs of Ballard without having a suspicion of some dark purpose ; ) but nothing had yet brought her into direct contact with Ballard or Babington. Here, then, was the diffi culty ; and as Walsingham pondered OArer the Avay to remove it, it seems to have fallen out, most unhappily for the Scottish Queen, that in consequence of the advice of Morgan, she resolved to renew her corre spondence with Babington, who probably about this time had returned from France to England, bringing with him the letter of the 29th April above-men tioned.2 It has been imagined, that Mary was drawn on to renew her correspondence with Babington by a stratagem of Walsingham's ; but although Wal- 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Paulet to Walsingham, 11th April, 1586. 2 Supra p. 299."], [332, "308 1586. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. singham was busy and ingenious in his stratagems after the correspondence had begun, there is no proof that any measures of his led to its renewal ; and it is evident, from what has been already stated, that for this purpose no trick or stratagem was required. But, howeATer this may be, Mary could not have adopted a more fatal step ; indeed, it was the very crisis of her fate. Hitherto, she knew only of the project for the Spanish invasion ; and, listening to the suggestions of prudence and suspicion, had connected herself in no way with Ballard and the plot against Elizabeth's life. Had she continued thus cautious, she was ignorant, and she was safe. But Babington arrived in England ; his residence lay in the near neighbourhood of Mary's prison ; Morgan had given him a letter to that Princess, recommending the re newal of their intercourse. The person who then managed the secret conveyance of Mary's letters was the treacherous Gifford. He, we know, would first com-ey it to Walsingham to be deciphered ; it would be then forwarded to the Scottish Queen. What a moment of suspense must this have been for the Eng lish secretary, Avho was Avatching, silent and darkling, for the evidence which might comics the captive Queen ? Had she suspected, or hesitated, or delayed, Morgan, who was in communication Avith Ballard, and likely to be soon informed of Babington having joined the plot against Elizabeth's life, might have warned her against having any communication Avith him, as he had done against corresponding with"], [333, "1586. 309 JAMES VI. Ballard. But Mary, if Ave are to believe the letters produced on her trial, which, however, she affirmed to be forgeries, had no suspicion. She wrote to Babington, at first, briefly. He, if Ave are to accept as genuine a copy of his letter produced at the trial, replied at great length. In his reply, the scheme for the invasion Avas connected Avith the conspiracy for the assassination of the Queen. Mary again answered ; at least so it Avas alleged by her enemies, who pro duced a copy of her reply ; she there gave directions for the landing of the troops and her own escape ; she alluded also to the assassination; and in her letter, if genuine, certainly did not deprecate it. The agent who managed this secret correspondence was Gilford; the man in whom Babington chiefly confided was Poley. Both were sold to Walsingham : every letter was thus carried first to him, deciphered by Phelipps, copied and reserved for evidence ; every conversation between the conspirators was reported. At last, when all seemed ripe for execution, the signal was given ; Gifford and his base assistants dropt the mask; Walsingham stept from behind the curtain ; Ballard and Babington were seized ; and the unfortunate captiA7e, one moment elated with hope, and joyous in the anticipation of freedom, found herself in the next\u201e detected, entangled, lost. This rapid summary has been given, to bring, at one glance, under the reader's eye, the great lines in this miserable and intricate story ; and, before proceeding to trace it farther, one observation must be added. From the system adopted by Walsingham, and the assistance he might deriA7e"], [334, "310 1586. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. from the unscrupulous ingenuity of Phelipps, it is clear, that if he were \u00a30 base as to aA'ail himself of it, he wasrin possession of a machinery by Avhich he could make Mary appear guilty of any plot he pleased. The letters of her correspondents, Morgan, Babington, Paget, and others, were Avritten in cipher to her, and her replies Avere conveyed in cipher to them. Both fell into the hands of the English secretary ; and, at the subsequent trial of Mary, the two long letters Avhich proved, as was contended, the Queen's acces sion to the plot against Elizabeth's life, were produced, not in the originals, but in alleged copies of the de ciphered documents. Nothing can be more evident than that, under such a system, Mary may have been Avholly innocent, and jet may have been made to ap pear guilty. The real letters which passed between her and Babington, and which were never produced, may have related solely to the great project for the invasion of England, and her escape. The copies of these letters, avowedly taken by Phelipps, Walsing ham's servant, may have been so manufactured, as to connect the invasion with the assassination of Elizabeth. We shall afterwards see that Mary as serted this Avas really done ; but, meaiiAA'hile, let us proceed with the story. Mary had two secretaries, named Nau and Curie: the first, a man of ability, intelligence, and education, but quarrelsome, and fond of political intrigue ; the second, chiefly employed as a clerk and decipherer. Both of them enjoying her confidence, and intrusted Avith the management of her secret correspondence."], [335, "311 1586. JAMES VI.

The letter accompanying this packet was in cipher, and in the folloAving words : \u2014 \" On Sunday last, I wrote unto you by this bearer, having received nothing from you since your letter dated the sixteenth of this instant.2 I hope to have her Majesty's despatch, mentioned in my foresaid, ready for to-morrow sevennight, [conform to] the appointment.

It is singular, as that gentleman has remarked, that Curie, or Nau, in writing it, made an error in the date. In 1586, the 4th of July, Roman style, which Mary's Secretaries used, was on a Friday, not a Saturday ; Saturday was the 5th of July, but the writer had mis taken the day of the month. This trivial circumstance appears to me to confirm the authenticity of the letters ; and there is another instance of carelessness in it : he speaks, although writing on the 5th July, of the 16th \"of this instant;\" evidently meaning the 1 6th June.

Paulet, howeArer, rejected it as dangerous, and liable, by exciting suspicion, to break off the good course already begun.2 He added, that this was the more to be feared, as it was expected, that on the 3d of the month, \" great matter\" would come from these people.

In the mean time, I would not omit to show you, that there is great assurance made of Mr Poley's faithful serving of her Majesty ; and by his OAvn let ters [he] hath ATowed and promised the same.\" But he subjoined this caution. \"As yet, her Majesty's ex perience of him is not so great as I dare embolden you to trust him much ; he never having AArritten to her Majesty but once, AAThereunto she hath not yet answered. * * * Let me knoAV plainly Avhat you understand of him. \u2014 12th July, Chartley. \u2014 Nau.\"2 Although these two letters, the first from Mary to Morgan, the second from Nau to Babington, appear not in the original, but only in the decipher, Avhich is in the handAvriting of Phelipps, and must therefore be regarded Avith suspicion, there seems no sufficient reason for doubting their authenticity; and they establish the fact, that the Scottish Queen, at this time, had tAvice Avritten to Babington, and meant to Avrite again. They prove, also, that, on the 12th July, she had received letters from Babington. But Avith regard to the subject of his offers to her, or her 1 1 2th July new style ; 2d July old. 2 MS.

To understand Avhat occurred next, the reader must keep in mind, that in his secret communications Avith Mary, Babington sometimes remained at Litchfield in the neighbourhood of Chartley, and sometimes went to London, for the purpose of holding his pri vate meetings with the conspirators, and also of visiting Secretary Walsingham, to Avhom, strange as it may appear, he had offered himself as a spy upon the practices of the Roman Catholic party. His object in this was evident. He belieA'ed that Wal singham kneAV nothing of his designs ; and hoped, under this disguise, to become acquainted with all the secret purposes of the Secretary. But Walsing ham was too old a diplomatist to be thus taken in. He accepted his offers, and made his own use of them. Hitherto Babington seems to have been in London when he received, through Gifford or his substitutes, the letters from Mary ; but he now pro posed to come doAvn to Litchfield, and communicate Avith her secret messenger in person. It is evident that this change made some alteration necessary on the part of Walsingham and Phelipps ; for the delay Avhich must have occurred in having the intercepted letters sent up to London, deciphered, copied, and retransmitted, to be delivered again to Babington, would have raised suspicion, and must, in all proba bility, have led to discovery. Phelipps, therefore, was sent down to Chartley,1 where, on pretence of some 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Phelipps to Walsingham, Chartley,"], [342, "1586. 318 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. other business, he took up his residence with Sir Amias Paulet ; and thus no time was lost in de ciphering the intercepted letters, and no suspicion raised. In this way Walsingham trusted that he would be enabled, following out what they had be gun, to draw the nets more tightly round the Scot tish Queen ; and procure, at last, a clear and positiA'e ground of conviction. Keeping this in vieAAT, the correspondence grows more and more interesting. Phelipps left London for Chartley on the evening of the 7th July,1 and on the way thither he met a messenger with a packet from Sir Amias Paulet to Walsingham, which, according to the directions he had received from this minister, he opened. It con tained a letter of Mary's to the French Ambassador. This the decipherer carried back with him to Chart ley, determining to copy it Avith all speed, and send it up again ; adding in his letter, that he knew the Ambassador was expecting it earnestly. \" By Sir Amias' letter, (to quote his note to Walsingham,) I find (said he) all things to stand in so good terms, as my abode here Avill be the less, but for Babington's matters, Avhich I beseech you resolve thoroughly and speedily.\"2 * * 14th July, 1586.

The arrival of Phelipps at Chartley was not un noted by the Scottish Queen, whose mind, Avith the acuteness and suspicion produced by a long captivity, eagerly scrutinized every new person or circumstance Avhich might affect her destiny. She remembered that Morgan had employed many years ago a gentle man of the same name; but she had never seen him. Could this be the same, and was he to be trusted, or might he not be some new spy or eavesdropper of her enemies? To ascertain this, she sent a minute de scription of his person to Morgan.1 He must have arrived at Chartley on the 9th July, and, having deciphered the intercepted packet to the French Ambassador, he, on the 14th, transmitted it Avith this letter to Walsingham. \" It may please your Honour, the packet is pre sently returned, Avhich I stayed, in hopes to send both that and the answer to Ba. letter at once : in the meanwhile, beginning to decipher that Avhich we had copied out before.

This packet, brought down by Phelipps, and thankfully received by Mary, appears to have contained a long letter from Babington, describing the conspiracy for the invasion of the realm, the escape of the Scottish queen, and the assassination of Elizabeth. This letter, which was not produced at the trial, and Avhich Mary denied having eArer re ceiA'ed, no longer exists, if it ever did exist, in the original ; but a copy, in a clerk's hand, has been pre served. Its purport Avas to excuse his long silence, every means of conveying his letters having been cut off, since the time that she had been committed to the custody of such a Puritan as Paulet. He then gave an account of his conference with Ballard ; in formed her of the intended murder of the Queen of England by six gentlemen selected for that purpose, and of his resolution to set her at the same time at liberty ; and he requested her to assign reAvards to the actors in this tragedy, or to their posterity, should they perish in the attempt.1 It is to be remembered, that this day, the 14th July, in Sir Amias' letter and Mr Phelipp's, was the 24th July according to the new style, which Mary and her secretaries, Curie and Nau, followed in their 1 Carte, A'ol. iii. p. 603.

They were addressed to Gifford ; and in the first, he told him, that the Queen of Scots had receiAred his letter, dated the 12th of that instant, with its enclosure ; that she was grateful for his dili gence, but approved of his cousin Gilbert's advice, not to employ frequently a certain person to Avhom he had alluded. He (Curie) then added this sentence : \" If Mr Babington be past down to the country, for whom this character x shall serve in time coming, her Majesty prayeth you to cause convey to him this enclosed, otherwise to stay it until you hear from her Majesty again.

Accord ingly, on the 19th July, which, it must be recollected, is the 29th July new style, Phelipps wrote in exulta tion from Chartley to Walsingham : \" It may please your Honour, you have now this Queen's answer to Babington, Avhich I received yesternight. If he be in the country, the original will be conveyed into his hands, and, like enough, answer returned. I hope, for your Honour's speedy resolution touching his apprehension or otherwise, that I may dispose of myself accordingly. I think, under correction, you have enough of him ; unless you would discover more particularities of the confederates, which may be done evren in his imprisonment.

I am sorry to hear from London, that Babington Avas not yet taken, and that some searches, by foreAvarning, haATe been frustrated.\"1 Phelipps concluded his letter, by cautioning Wal singham against one Thoroughgood, who had applied for a license to leaA'e the country, and whom he suspected might be Ballard under a feigned name ; and added this postscript: \"It may please your honour, by Berdon, or my man,, to inform yourself whether Babington be at London or no; AArhich known, we Avill resolve presently upon return.\" Paulet also wrote briefly, but joyfully, to Walsingham. His words, he said, would be feAV ; the papers now sent containing matter enough for one time ; but he re joiced that \" God had blessed his labours, giATing him 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Phelipps to Walsingham, July 19, 1586."], [349, "1586. 325 JAMES VI. the reward of true and faithful service, and trusted, that the Queen, and her graAre councillors, would make their profit of the merciful providence of God toAvards her Highness and England.\"1 It must here be remarked, that there seems no good reason to doubt the perfect authenticity of those tAvo notes of Curie's, of the 22d and 27th July ; and, therefore, no ground for questioning the fact, that the Queen of Scots had transmitted tAvo several letters to Babington : neither can there be any doubt that the letters of Phelipps, written on his road to Chartley, and during his residence there, are authen tic ; for they, like Curie's notes, are preserved, and prove themseh'es. But it is certainly remarkable;'. and cannot but excite suspicion, that, at this critical moment, the originals of Mary's tAvo letters to Bab ington, which Phelipps undoubtedly received, and the contents of which proved, as Avas affirmed, Mary's knoAvledge of the plot against Elizabeth's life, have both disappeared. Nay, the singularity goes farther ; for Mary sends tAvo letters to Babington, one on the 25th, the other on the 27th ; and only one was after wards produced against her, and that confessedly not. an original. All the other letters of Curie, Morgan, Nau, Gifford, and others, in these intricate doings, haA^e been preserved, and generally With the decipher ; but this letter, the most important of all, on whicii, indeed, the AA'hole question turned, is a copy. At the trial, when this copy was produced and argued on, when Mary solemnly asserted that it was never 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off., Paulet to Walsingham, July 20, 158G."], [350, "1586. 326 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. Avritten by her, and challenged her enemies to shoAv the original, it was not forthcoming. It is impossi ble not to regard this as a suspicious circumstance, coupled with the fact already noticed, that the letter of Babington to Mary is in the same predicament, and exists only as a copy ; and this suspicion is greatly increased by an assertion of Camden, that, after intercepting and opening the Scottish Queen's letter to Babington, Walsingham, and his assistant Phelipps, cunningly added to it a postscript in the same characters, desiring him to set down the names of the six gentlemen, and it is likely (he observes) other things too.1 Hitherto this statement of Cam den, Avhich involves a charge of so dark a kind against Walsingham, has rested on his bare averment, un supported by all evidence ; but I have found recently in the State-Paper Office, a small letter, written wholly in the same cipher as that of Mary's long letter to Babington, and endorsed in the hand of Phillipps, \" The postscript of the Scottish Queen's letter to Babington.\" It runs thus, and certainly gives great support to the allegation of Camden : \u2014 \" I Avould be glad to know the names and qualities of the six gentlemen which are to accomplish the designment ; for that it may be I shall be able, upon knowledge of the parties, to give you some further advice necessary to be followed therein f as 1 Camden in Kennet, vol. ii. p. 517- 2 After this, in the original cipher, follows this sentence scored through, but so as to be quite legible : \" And even so do I wish to be made acquainted with the names of all such principal persons, as also wo be already as also who be.\""], [351, "1586. 327 JAMES VI. also, from time to time, particularly how you pro ceed ; and as soon as you may, for the same purpose, who be already,' and hoAV far every one, privy here unto.\"1 The exact bearing of this postscript, as a proof of Mary's innocence, will aftenvards appear. In the mean time, it is sufficient to remark, that it goes far to establish the fact, that her letters to Babington were tampered Avith, and added to by Walsingham. Returning, however, to the contents of her reply, Ave find that Mary, in this real or pretended letter to Babington, entered fully into the details of the in tended invasion. She recommended them to examine deeply, first what forces they might raise ; what cap tains they should appoint ; of what towns and havens they could assure themselves ; where it would be best to assemble their chief strength ; Avhat number of foreign auxiliaries they required ; what provision of money and armour ; by what means the six gen tlemen deliberated to proceed ; and in what manner she should be assisted in making her escape. Hav ing weighed all this, she recommended them to com municate the result, and their intentions, to Mendoza the Spanish Ambassador, to whom she promised to write ; she enjoined on them the greatest caution and secrecy : and, to conceal their real designs, ad- 1 This was deciphered for me by Mr Lemon of the State-Paper Office, who has added this sentence : \" I hereby declare, that the above is a true and literal decipher of the document in the State Paper Office in cipher, endorsed by Philipps \u2014 The Postscript of the Scottish Queen's letter to Babington.

She then expressed herself in these re markable words : \u2014 \" Affairs being thus prepared, and forces in readi- ness, both Avithout and Avithin the realm, then shall it be time to set the six gentlemen to Avork ; taking order, upon the accomplishing of their design, I may be suddenly transported out of this place, and that all your forces, in the same time, be on the field to meet me. * * '* Nor for that there can be no certain day appointed of the accomplishing of the said gentlemen's designment, \u2014 to the end that others may be in readiness to take me from hence, I would that the said gentlemen had always about them, or, at the least, at Court, four stout men furnished with good and speedy horses, for, so soon as the said design shall be executed, to come Avith all diligence, to ad- vertise thereof those that shall be appointed for my transporting ; to the end that, immediately thereafter, they may be at the place of my abode, before that my keeper can have advice of the execution of the said design, or at least before he can fortify himself within the house, or carry me out of the same. It Avere necessary to despatch tAvo or three of the said advertisers by divers ways, to the end that if one be staid, the other may come through ; and at the same instant, Avere it also needful, to assay to cut off the post's ordinary ways.

She then obserATed, \" If I stay here, there is for that purpose [her escape] but one of these three means following to be looked [to.] The first, that at one certain day, appointed, in my walking abroad on horseback on the moors, betAvixt this and Staf ford, where ordinarily you know very few people do pass, a fifty or threescore men, well horsed and armed, come to take me there; as they may easily, my keeper having with him ordinarily but eighteen or twenty horsemen only with dags.1 The second 1 Dags \u2014 Pistols."], [354, "1586. 330 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. mean, is to come at midnight, or soon after, to set fire in the barns and stables, which you know are near to the house ; and whilst that my guardian's servants shall run forth to the fire, your company (having every one a mark whereby they may Iuioav one another under night) might surprise the house, where I hope, with the feAV servants I have about me, I were able to give you correspondence.

It was necessary, hoAvever, to act Avith extreme caution. If one of the conspirators was laid hold of before another, the rest might take alarm and escape, the news reach Chart ley, and Mary, whose papers he had resolved to seize, might order everything to be destroyed. He was too acute not to anticipate great difficulty even after all he had done and intercepted. The letters of Mary to Morgan and to Babington were not in the Queen's hand, but in cipher, and were written by her secretaries, Nau or Curie. She might deny them. The small notes enclosing these letters were also in cipher, and confessedly from Curie and Nau. She might assert that they had AATritten them without her orders, and unknown to her.1 The only way of completing the proof was to search her repositories for the original minutes or rough drafts of these let ters, and to seize Curie and Nau, and compel them to confess all they knew. Hence the extreme dan ger of giving any alarm at Chartley, which might lead to the destruction of the one, or the escape of the other. Babington apparently was still unsus picious, and in constant communication with Wal singham. Contrary to his original intention, he had. given up his plan of going down to Litchfield, and 1 The reader will observe, that I am here reasoning on the assumption that Mary's letters to Babington, as they appear in the copies, were authentic."], [356, "1586. 332 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. had remained in London, where he held secret meet ings with Ballard, Savage, Poley, Dun, and the other conspirators. In these difficult circumstances, Walsingham was compelled to act rapidly, and yet with caution. He sent for Phelipps, (July 22,) who remained still at Chartley, busy in the task of deciphering the last letters intercepted, addressed to Mendoza and the French Ambassador.1 Elizabeth, he said, Avould thank him, on his arrival, with her oavii lips ; but as Babington was still in London, he must bring Avith him the original letter of Mary to this traitor. It AATas not, however, brought up by the decipherer till the 27th or 28th, and Avas then conveyed to Babing ton by a secret messenger, to Avhom he promised to have the answer ready by the second of August.2 And here, in passing, it seems very important to re mark, that the original letter of Mary to Babington, the letter which brought home to her the knoAvdedge of the conspiracy against the Queen's life, and which has been already fully quoted, was confessedly in the hands of Phelipps the decipherer from the evening of the 18th July, when he intercepted it,3 to the 27th or 28th of the same month, a period of nine days at the least. There was ample time, therefore, to make any changes or additions AArhich might seem necessary 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off., Walsingham to Phelipps, July 22, 1586, Papers of Mary. s MS. Letter, St. P.

So far Avith Walsingham all had proceeded well. Babing ton had received the important letter, and promised his answer. Meanwhile, the task of arresting Bal lard had been committed to Milles, one of Walsing ham's secretaries ; but this conspirator used so many devices, and glided about so mysteriously, often changing his lodging, that for some time he eluded all their vigilance. At last he was seized and lodged in the Counter, a prison in Wood Street.1 Phelipps, however, began to be in great alarm about Babing ton, AA'ho had noAV become suspicious that they were discoArered, and instead of keeping his appointment for the 2d August, had ridden out of toAvn, none knew AArhere. The truth seems to have been, that the unhappy man was in an agony of suspense. He had discovered Maud's treachery, and trembled for their plot being on the point of detection. If he fled, the cause was lost. If he remained, it might be to perish miserably. He at last resolved to Avrite to Mary, and return with the vain hope of still over reachinp- Walsingham. His letter to the Scottish Queen, dated the 3d August, Avas intercepted like the rest.2 It informed her of their danger, but con jured her not to be dismayed, for all AArould yet go well.

He added, that he Avould send the. answer to her propositions, and their final deter mination, in the next.1 This promised letter, how ever, he was destined never to write. He returned to London on the 4th August, the day on which Ballard was apprehended; heard the fatal news; attempted a feeble remonstrance with Walsingham ; AAras reassured by the crafty excuses of that veteran intriguer for a few hours ; again doubted and trem bled ; and at last eluding the men who were set to watch his motions, escaped, in disguise, with some of his companions, and concealed himself in St John's Wood near the city. Walsingham appears hitherto, in these plots and counterplots, to haAre acted on his owrn responsibility ; but it was now necessary to determine on Mary's fate : and with this vieAV, he now, for the first time, laid before Elizabeth, in their full extent, the appalling discoAreries which he had made ; the conspiracy for the invasion of the realm ; and that also against her own life. The Queen was thunderstruck. She saAv her extreme danger. The plot was evidently proceeding in her own dominions, in Scotland, in Spain, perhaps in France ; yet, though its general purpose Avas clear, its particular ramifications, especially in Scotland, and at Rome, were still unknown. She noAV recalled to mind Randolph's solemn and warning letter, writ ten from Edinburgh some months before this. The persons to whom he alluded must be fellow-conspi- 1 MS. Letter, Copy, St. P.

Walsingham had used the precaution of apprehending him, simply on the charge of being a seminary priest, and, as such, interdicted by law from entering England. Elizabeth, under these circumstances, commanded Walsingham to keep everything still to himself. It was not time yet, she said, to consult the Council : she and he must act alone ; and it was her advice, that he should first bribe some of Ballard's confidants, if he knew of any such, and thus elicit his secrets. She suggested, also, that if any cipher used by the traitor in his correspondence had come to his hands, he might employ it to extract from him the particu lars of the plot against her life. It is from Wal singham's answer to this proposition of the Queen, that the above particulars are drawn, and the letter itself is too interesting to be omitted. It is as fol lows : \u2014 \" It may please your most Excellent Majesty, I will, as duty bindeth me, most pointedly obseiTe your Majesty's commandment, especially in keeping to my self both the depth and the manner of the discovery of this great and weighty cause.

At the same instant, Nau and Curie were seized, kept separate from each other, and hurried away, under a strong guard, to London. Mary was completely taken by surprise. She broke into ATiolent reproaches, and called upon her suite to defend their mistress from the traitors who dared to lay hands on her. But a moment's reflection convinced her they Avere far too weak for resistance ; and she suffered Paulet to lead her to Tixall.2 Here, by Elizabeth's orders, she wTas kept a close prisoner, secluded from her senTants, refused the ministry of her priArate chaplain, served by strangers, deprived of the use of writing ma terials, and completely cut off from all intelligence.

All Avas then packed up and sealed, preparatory to being sent to Elizabeth, who now appears to have directed every step. This Princess was over joyed at the success Avhich had attended the arrest of Mary : she wrote to Paulet, addressing him as the most faithful of her subjects ; promised him a reAArard \" non omnibus datum ; \" and, soon after, sent a new message, eagerly desiring him to write the whole story of everything done to Mary ; not that she sus pected (as she said) he had omitted any part of his duty, but \"simply that she might take pleasure in the reading thereof.\"1 Above all things, Elizabeth urged the safe keeping, and immediate transmission to her, of the caskets found in the Queen of Scots' repositories. These, and the things contained in them, she declared were, in her esteem, of far greater value than Nau or Curie ; and, not content with a written message, she deputed a special envoy from Windsor to look after these treasures and bring them at once.2 Shortly before this, Elizabeth had a new triumph in the seizure of Babington and his companions.

There was no Avant of evidence against them, and their own confes sions corroborated all; but after the day for their trials had been fixed, and everything seemed ready, the English Queen suddenly caught alarm, from the idea, that if the charge made by the Crown lawyers, and the evidence of the witnesses, deeply implicated Mary, her oavu life Avas not safe. Elizabeth had not yet resolved on the trial of the Scottish Queen, and the evidence against her was most imperfect. Her two secretaries, Nau and Curie, had as yet confessed no thing which materially involved their mistress. No original minutes of the letters to Babington had been found.1 Even if Mary's trial were to take place, it was clear that a considerable interval must elapse between her arraignment and the execution of the conspirators ; and, in this interval, thought Elizabeth, what might not be attempted against her own life ? Though some of the leading conspirators were taken, yet many desperate men might still be lurking about Court; and so intensely did she feel upon this subject, that, on the evening of the 12th September, the very day before the trial, she sent repeated messages and letters to Burghley, commanding that, in the \" Indictment \" and in the evidence, there should be no enlargement of the Queen of Scots' crime. It was her favourite, Sir Christopher HattonJme^Vice-chamberlain, who 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off., Walsingham to Phelipps, 3d Sept. 1586."], [364, "340 1586. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. transmitted these wishes to Burghley ; and the reason he gave, was, that Elizabeth felt that it might be perilous to herself, if anything Avere giAren in evidence Which touched Mary \" criminally for her life.\"1 Amid these alarms the trials proceeded ; and Ba bington, Ballard, and Savage, with the rest of the conspirators being found guilty, Avere executed on the 20th and 21st of September, with a studied cruelty, which it is revolting to find proceeded from Eliza beth's special orders. She had at first suggested to her council, that some \"new device\" should be adopted to enhance their tortures, and strike more terror into the people ; to which it Avas ansAvered by Burghley, that the manner of the execution prescribed by law, would be fully as terrible as any other neAV device, if the hangman took care to \" protract the action,\" to the extremity of their pains, and to the sight of the multitude who beheld it.2 The executioner by special direction did so : but the sight of seven men cut up alive, after being partially strangled, was found to excite the rage and disgust of the multitude; and next daythc second seven were permitted to be executed after a milder fashion.3 But, leaA'ing these cruel scenes, Ave must turn to the unhappy Mary. On the 25th August, she was removed from Tixall, to her former residence at Chart ley, under the charge of Sir Amias Paulet, and a body 1 MS.

This strong escort Eliza beth thought necessary, from the suspicion that many commiserated her fate ; and indeed, Walsingham's let ters betrayed considerable uneasiness on the subject. But his apprehensions were needless; for nothing could noAV be more utterly helpless than the situation of the royal captive. She had been deprived, during her stay at Tixall, of all her servants, and Avas surrounded by strangers. When seen coming from the gate of the castle, a croAvd of poor people assembled round her; and on some asking alms, she answered, weeping, that she had nothing to give. All has been taken from me, said she: I am a beggar as well as you. Then turning to Sir Walter Ashton, the proprietor of Tixall, and the other gentlemen, she again burst into tears, exclaiming, \" Good gentlemen, I am not witting of anything intended against the Queen.\" On reaching Chartley Castle, her old prison, an affecting incident occurred. The AArife of Curie her secretary, had been confined during the interval between Mary's removal and her return ; and before going to her OAvn chamber, the Queen, with the affectionate con sideration which she ahvays sliOAved to her senrants, went to visit the mother and child. It was a fe male; and turning to Paulet, AArho stood by, she begged him, since her own priest Avas removed from her, to suffer his chaplain to christen the babe, and give it the name of Mary.

The Queen said nothing at the time ; but retiring for a short season, came again into the room, and taking the infant on her knee, dipped her hand in a basin of water, and sprinkling its face, said, \" Mary, I baptize thee, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\" Paulet, in a letter to Walsingham, which described the scene, affected to be shocked at a scandal which he might himself so easily have prevented. He was igno rant, probably, that the Catholic Church, under such circumstances, permitted lay baptism ; but the man was of a perverse churlish temper \u2014 a strict Puritan ; and, as his letters often showed, more remarkable for his zeal than his charity.1 Mary now proceeded to her own apartment ; and on reaching it, the keys of the chamber, and of her coffers, were offered to one of her servants, who had been at length suffered to attend on her : but the Queen commanded him not to receive them ; and bade Mr Darrel, one of Paulet's assistants, open the door. He did so ; and on entering, finding her papers seized, and her repositories empty, she expressed herself with deep indignation : declaring, that there were two things which the Queen of England could never take from her, \u2014 her English blood, and her Catholic religion. She then added, that some of them might yet be sorry for this outrage; a threat which ruffled and disturbed Paulet.2 1 MS. Letter, St. P. Off, Paulet to Walsingham, Aug. 22, 1586.

All the efforts of Elizabeth and Walsingham Avere now directed to collect conclusive evidence against the Scottish Queen. Her secretaries, Nau and Curie, were in their hands, and repeatedly examined ; but, up to the 3d of September, their confessions did not materially involve their mistress.1 The evidence, connecting her with the general conspiracy for the invasion of the realm, was perfectly clear ; her cor respondence with France, Spain, and Scotland, and her secret practices with the Catholics in England, was fully made out. But this was not considered enough ; and Walsingham, in despair, wrote to Phe lipps, then at Chartley, that Nau and Curie would by no means be brought to confess that they were acquainted with the letters that passed between their mistress and Babington : adding, \" I Avould to God that these minutes could be found!\"2 It is evident that, by these minutes, the Secretary meant such rough drafts, or notes of Mary's letters to Babington, as he conjectured might be preserved in her reposi tories: and here we have a clear admission that, unless such Avere found, the evidence against the Scottish Queen was considered incomplete. At this moment of perplexity and difficulty, Burghley wrote to Sir Christopher Hatton, suggesting that it was terror for themselves that kept the Scottish Queen's secretaries silent : they refused, as he thought, to implicate their mistress, because it might bring ruin on themselves ; 1 MS.

On the same day (4th September) Walsing ham Avrote to Phelipps, who Avas then at Court. It was evident, he said, that Mary's \"minutes Avere not extant.\" He directed him, therefore, to seek access to Elizabeth, and persuade her to promise some extraordinary favour to Curie, Avho had admitted, in general terms, his mistress's correspondence Avith Ba bington, but obstinately refused to be more explicit.2 Both this person Curie, and his brother secretary, Nau, Avere, in truth, in a difficult dilemma.

On the 5th September, the day after Burghley had Avritten to Hatton, Nau, actuated, no doubt, by Hatton's promises of escape and pardon, described minutely the manner in which Mary man aged her secret correspondence. The Queen, he said, Avould never alloAV anything secret or important to be written anyAvhere but in her cabinet, himself and Curie sitting at the table. It was her usual practice to dictate the points which she Was pleased should be Avritten ; he took them doAvn, read them over to her, dreAv out the letters, again submitted them for correction, and finally delivered them to be put into cipher and disposed of according to her orders. In this manner were Avritten the intercepted letters of the Queen to the Archbishop of Glasgow, Charles Paget, and the Spanish Ambassador : but as to the letter to Babington, he declared that his mistress had delivered it to him for the most part Avritten in her own hand.1 It AATas Curie, he said, AAdio finally trans lated and put the letters in cipher ; and this same process had taken place Avith this letter as Avith the rest. This evidence was far from being sufficiently explicit or satisfactory ; and various attempts were made to amend it.

It is quite clear that this declaration, wrung out from Nau, did not corroborate, but rather contradicted the alleged letter of the Scottish Queen to Babington, \u2014 a sufficient reason why Burghley should have disregarded it. After an interval of eleven days, Nau and Curie were again examined before the Lord Chancellor, Burghley, and Sir Chris topher Hatton. Babington and his companions had been executed the day before : on that same morning seven more conspirators had been drawn to Tyburn. In the interval between this examination and their last, Ballard had been so \" racked\" that he was car- ried to the bar and arraigned in a chair;2 and it was hoped that, under the influence of terror for a similar fate, the secretaries would declare all.

This statement of Nau was corro borated by Curie; who added, that his mistress wished him to burn the English copy of the letters sent to Babington.2 It was now considered that there was sufficient evidence against the Queen of Scots, and there only remained the question of the mode of trial ; nor was this long in deliberation.

It asserted, that the contrary would be verified by the clearest proofs ; that she had, there fore, sent some of her chief and ancient noblemen to charge her with having consented to that most horrible and unnatural conspiracy lately discovered ; that, living as she did Avithin the protection of, and thereby subject to her haws, she must abide by the mode of trial which they enjoined ; and she, there fore, required her to give credit to those noblemen 1 Lingard, vol.

He explained Ballard's dealing with Morgan and Paget in France, the conspiracy for the invasion of England, and his repair to that country for the purpose of completing the plot ; he adverted to the transactions between Ballard and Babington, to the formation of the new conspiracy against the life of the English Queen ; to the renewal of the correspondence betAveen Mary and Babington, which took place at this mo ment ; and he concluded by contending that she had 1 Camden, vol. ii. of Kennet, p. 522."], [380, "1586. 356 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. approved of the plot, had promised her assistance, and pointed out the readiest mode for its execution.1 To this Mary ansAvered, that she had never seen Anthony Babington, nor receiAed any letter from him, nor herself Avritten any to him ; that she kneAv nothing of Ballard, and had never relieved him ; as for the Catholics of England, they were oppressed and took many things hardly. This she kneAv, and had represented it to the Queen her sister, imploring her to take pity on them. She acknowledged, also, that she had receiAred offers of assistance from ano nymous correspondents, but she had not embraced such offers ; and hoAV was it possible for a captive, shut up in prison, to search out the names or the intentions of unknown persons, or to hinder AA'hat they attempted ? It was possible that Babington bad Avritten such a letter as he described, but let them proAre that it had come into her hands;2 and as for her oavii letters, let them produce them, and she would know what to answer. Copies of the letter from Babington to the Queen of Scots, and of Mary's alleged ansAver, were then read; Babington's AA'ritten confession Avas also quoted, besides the confessions of Dun, Titchbourne, and Bal lard, three of his felloAv conspirators ; and it was contended by the Attorney-general Puckering, and by the Lord Treasurer Burghley, that nothing could be clearer than the evidence thus adduced, of direct con nivance and approval.

They spoke of the letters Avhich she had received, of the ansAArers she had sent; and thev brought fonvard copies of a long letter from a man Avhom she had neA'er seen, and a detailed ansAver, point by point, Avhich she had never Avritten.

And, as for her alleged letter to Babington, if it, too, Avas written in cipher, and the original had been intercepted by them,Avhy wasit not now produced?

She would then be able to ex amine it, to disproA-e it, and to detect the fraud Avhich had beeu practised against her. At present she must be contented with a simple and solemn denial that she had not written the letters which had been iioav read, and that she was guiltless of any plot against the life of the Queen of England. 1 Avis de ce qui a este faict en Angleterrc par Monsieur de Bel lievre sur les affaires dc La Royne D'Escosse.

The Avhole history of it was deATeloped point by point, it was opened by the brief notes written sometimes by Curie, sometimes by Nau; it was they who had deciphered the letters of Babington, and communicated their contents to their mistress. Nay, the exact manner had been specified, in which the answer had been prepared by Nau. It was composed partly from minutes by the Queen, and from verbal dictation; it was Avritten out at length in French, reA'ised by Mary, translated and put into cipher by Curie, and then secretly sent to its destination. The letters also of the Scottish Queen to Englefield, of a date as far back as Oth October, 1584, proved, as he said, that the great plot, for the invasion of England, Avas then in agitation ; her letter to Charles Paget, on the 21st of May last, (1586,) showed its resumption at that period; the letter of Charles Paget to the Scottish Queen, of the 29th May, connected her with Ballard and Mendoza the Spanish Ambassador; and the letters of the 27th July, to Lord Paget, Sir Francis Englefield, Mendoza, the Bishop of Glasgow, and Charles Paget, corrobor ated not only the confessions of the conspirators, but the contents of the letters between her and Babing ton, and the Avritten testimony of her oaati secretaries. During this address of the Lord Treasurer, he had occasion to mention the Earl of Arundel, as impli cated in some degree, with the conspiracy ; upon Avhich Mary burst into tears, and lamented, with passionate expressions, the calamities which the noble House of Howard had endured for her sake ; but,"], [384, "1586. 360 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. soon drying her eyes, and reassuming her dignity and composure, she once more, in reply to the arguments of the Lord Treasurer, asseverated her innocence of any plot against the Queen's life. What Babington (she said) might, or might not confess against her, she was ignorant of; neither Avas it possible for her to say or discover, Avhether this Avritten confession Avas in his handwriting or not. But Avhy had they executed him before they had confronted him with herself, and permitted her to examine him? If he were uoav before them, she Avould have so dealt Avith him, that the truth Avould have come out; but they had taken good care to make this impossible. And the same thing might be said of Nau and Curie ; Avhy Avas she not confronted Avith them? WhyAvas she not permitted to examine them ? They at least, Avere alive : they might have been here if her adversaries had felt con fident that they would have corroborated their written confessions. Curie, she aatis assured, Avas an honest man, though it Avas strange to find one in his station adduced as a Avitness agaiust her. Nau was a more politic and talented person ; he had been secretary to the Cardinal Lorrain, and she had received recom mendations in his favour, from her brother, the French King ; but she Avas by no means assured that hope, or fear, or reward, might not have influenced him to giATe false evidence against her; and it Avas well known that he had Curie at his beck, and could make him Avrite whatever he pleased. It Avas asserted truly, that her letters were Avritten, and put into cipher, by these secretaries. But AAThat security had she, that they"], [385, "1586. 361 JAMES VI. had not inserted into them such things as she had neA-er dictated? Was it not possible, also, that they might have received letters addressed to her, which they neA-er delivered ? was it not possible that they might have ansAvered letters in her name, and in her cipher, which she had never seen? \"And am I,\" said she, Avith great animation and dignity, \"am I, a Queen, to be convicted on such evi dence as this ? Is it not apparent, that the majesty and safety of Princes falls to the ground, if they are to depend upon the writings and testimony of their secretaries ? I have delivered nothing to them, but what nature dictated to me, under the desire of re coArering my liberty; and I claim the privilege of being convicted by nothing but mine oavu word, or writing. If they have written anything Avhich may be hurtful to the Queen, my sister, they have Avritten it alto gether without my knowledge : let them bear the punishment of their inconsiderate boldness.

Think you, Mr Secretary, that I am ignorant of your devices used so craftily against me ? Your spies sur rounded me on every side; but you knoAV not, perhaps, that some of your spies on me proved false, and brought intelligence to me. And if such have been his doings my lords,\" she continued, appealing to the assembly, \"how can I be assured that he hath not counterfeited my ciphers to bring me to my death ? Has he not already practised against my life, and that of my son ? \" Upon this, Walsingham, rising in his place, Avarmly disclaimed the imputation. \"I call God to AA-itness, said be, that as a private person, I have done nothing unbeseeming- an honest man, nor as a public servant of my royal mistress, anything unworthy of my office ; but I plead guilty to my having been ex ceeding careful for the safety of the Queen, and this realm. I have curiously searched out every practice against both: nor if Ballard, the traitor, had offered me his help in the inA-estigation, Avould I have refused if. With this plausible, but really indirect and evasiA-e disavowal, Mary declared herself satisfied; and after some arguments of the Lord Treasurer, and the croAvn laAvyers, which it is unnecessary to notice, the Court adjourned till next morning. The proceedings on the second day were not ma terially different from the first. Mary Avas still alone,"], [387, "1586. 363 JAMES VI. unassisted,, and it may be added, undismayed ; al though at times she gave way to tears, and seemed to feel her desolate condition. She reneAved her protestation, declining the jurisdiction of the Court ; and demanded that it should be recorded. As to the plot itself of which she was accused, some little vari ation took place in her mode of defence. On the former day, she had been wholly ignorant of the cir cumstances which were to be brought against her ; and had commenced her defence by a general denial or disavowal of all treasonable correspondence. She Avas now aware of the eAridence, and partially ad mitted and defended her letters to Morgan, Paget, and Mendoza ; she even acknoAvledged such notes as, by her secretaries acting under her orders, had been sent to Babington ;x but she again most pointedly asserted, that these notes and letters referred solely to the project for her escape. This project, she said, it Avas perfectly justifiable in her to encourage by every means, eA-en by the invasion of the realm : she then reiterated her denial of being accessary to the con spiracy against the Queen's person ; and entered into a detail of her repeated offers of accommodation made to that Princess. It had been her sincere desire, she affirmed, to remove every ground of dissatisfaction from the mind of her sister ; but her proposals were dis alloAved, or suspected, or despised; so that, remaining a captive, she was driven to practices for her escape. \"And now,\" said she, \"with what injustice is this cause 1 Egerton, p. 103.

If careless of my personal feelings, think at least, my lords, of the royal majesty which is wounded through me : think of the precedent you are creating. Your OAvn Queen was herself accused of a participation in Wyatt's plot ; yet she was innocent. And Heaven is my Avitness that, although a good Catholic, and anxious for the welfare and safety of all Avho profess that faith, I Avould shudder to purchase it at the price of blood. The life of the meanest of my people, has been ever dear to me; and far rather Avould I plead Avith Esther, than take the sword with Judith ; though I knoAV the character that has been given me by my enemies, and Iioav they brand meas irreligious.\" She then solemnly appealed to God, and to all foreign Princes, against the injustice with Avhich she had been treated. \"Icame into England,\" she exclaimed, \"relying on the friendship and promises of the Queen of Eng land. I came, relying on that token which she sent me. Here, my lords,\" she said, drawing a ring from her finger, and shoAATing it to her judges; \"here it is, regard it Avell : it came from A-our roval mistress. And trusting to that pledge of loAe and protection, I came amongst you i1 you can best tell hoAV that pledge has been redeemed.

It would noAV have been the time for the commissioners to deliver their opinions, and to pronounce sentence; but, to the surprise of many present, the Court broke up, having adjourned their meeting to the 25th October, at Westminster. The alleged ground of this abrupt measure, aatis the in formality of pronouncing sentence before the record, or official report of the proceedings, was completed : the true cause, Avas the secret letter of Elizabeth already quoted.1 On the same day, on which the Court broke up, the High Treasurer repaired to his country seat of Burgh ley, from which he wrote the following letter to Davi son. It is valuable, as illustrating the real character of so noted a statesman as Lord Burghley : the appro bation Avith which he speaks of his own eloquence; the complacent description he gives of his success in coun teracting the pity Which most generous minds would have felt for Mary's desolate condition; and the cold sneer Avith Avhich he styles her the \" Queen of the Castle,\" are all in keeping Avith his former unfeeling 1 Camden, pp. 524, 525. 2 MS.

Yesternight, upon receipt of your letter, dated on Thursday, I Avrote what Avas thought wrould be this day's work. The Queen of the Castle was content to appear again afore us in public, to be heard: but, in truth, not to be heard for her defence; for she would say nothing but negatively, that the points of the letters that concerned the practice against the Queen's Majesty were nevTer by her wTritten, nor of her knoAvledge. The rest, for invasion, for escaping by force, she said she will neither deny nor affirm. But her intention was, by long artificial speeches, to move pity ; to lay all blame upon the Queen's Majesty, or rather on the Council, that all the troubles past did ensue ; avowing her reasonable offers and our refusals. And in this her speeches I did so encounter her with reasons out of my knowledge and experience, as she had not that advantage she looked for; as I am assured the auditory did find her case not pitoyable, [and] her allegations untrue, by AA'hich means great debate fell yesternight very long, and this day renewed with great stomaching. But Ave had great reason to prorogue our Session till the 25th; and so we of the Council will be at Court on the 22d; and Ave find all persons here in commission sally satisfied, as, by her Majesty's order, judgment Avill be given at our next meeting.\" J The same day, Walsingham wrote on the same 1 MS.

JAMES VI. subject to Leicester, declaring that even Mary's best friends thought her guilty ; and adding, that but for a secret command of Elizabeth, they Avould have pronounced sentence. This delay and indecision appears to have so greatly annoyed the Secretary, that he represented it as a judgment from heaA'en, that her Majesty had no power to proceed against her as her own safety required.1 On the 25th of October, the commissioners met in the Star-chamber at Westminster, and the same proofs Avere adduced against the Scottish Queen which had been brought fonvard at Fotheringay ; with the excep tion that her secretaries, Nau and Curie, wTere iioav examined, and corroborated their letters and confes sions.2 The former confessions of these tAvo secretaries had been unsatisfactory to Walsingham and Burghley ;:; they proved the Queen to have received letters from Babington, and to have dictated to them certain an- SAvers in reply ; but judging from the imperfect papers Avhich remain,4 there was no certain proof in their confessions, that Mary had dictated the passages Avhich implied a knowledge of the conspiracy against Elizabeth's life ; and, on this second occasion at Westminster, they merely corroborated their former confessions.5 But Nau, if we may trust his own account, did more ; for he openly asserted that the 1 MS.

At FotheringayAve had the accused without theAvitnesses, at the Star-chamber AA\"e have the Avitnesses without the accused ; for Mary remained at Fotheringay under the morose superintendence of Paulet, whilst the investigation proceeded at Westminster, directed by the indefatigable and unrelenting Burghley. Having heard the evidence, the commissioners, as Avas to be anticipated, pronounced sentence against the Queen : declaring that, since the 1st of June, in the 27th year of Elizabeth, divers matters had been compassed and imagined within this realm of England, by Anthony Babington and others, with the privity of the Queen of Scots, tending to the hurt, death, and destruction of the royal person of her Majesty the Queen of England.2 They intimated, at the same time, Avith the object of conciliating the Scottish King, that nothing in this sentence should affect James' title to the English crown ; which should re main exactly in the same state as if the proceedings at Fotheringay had never taken place. A feAV days after this, Parliament met, and after. 1 Lingard, vol. viii. p. 229. 5 Howel, vol. i. p. 1189."], [393, "15S6. 369 JAMES VI. approving and confirming this sentence, unanimously petitioned Elizabeth, as she valued Christ's true reli gion, the security of the realm, her oavii life, and the safety of themselves and their posterity, to consent that the sentence against the Queen of Scots should be published. To enforce their request, they called to her remembrance the ano-er of God against Saul AA-hen he spared Agag king of the Amalekites, and his displeasure with Ahab for pardoning Benhadad.1 The answer of Elizabeth was striking; and probably sincere, except in the pity and soitoav it expressed for Mary. She acknoAAdedged, with expressions of deep gratitude to God, her almost miraculous preser- Aation; and professed the delight she experienced, after a reign of twenty-eight years, to find her sub jects' good Avill even greater to her iioav than at its commencement. Her life, she said, had been \" danger ously shot at ; \" but her sense of danger AA'as lost in soitoav, that one so nearly allied to her as the Queen of Scots should be guilty of the crime. So far bad she herself been from bearing her sister any ill will, that, upon discoArering Mary's treasonable practices, she had Avritten her, that if she would privately con fess them they should be wrapt up in silence ; and uoav, if the matter had only iiiA-olvcd dangers to herself, and not the welfare of her people, she pro tested that she should willingly pardon Mar}-. It AATas only for her people that she, Elizabeth, desired to live ; and, if her death could bring them 1 Camden in Kennet, vol. ii. p. 526. VOL. VIII. 2 B"], [394, "1586. 370 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. a more flourishing condition, or a better Prince, she would gladly lay down her life. After somewhat more in this strain, she informed Parliament that their last Act had reduced her to great difficulties ; and, in dAvelling upon the sor row felt for Mary, she artfully introduced a circum stance, AvhicliAvas Avell calculated to rouse their utmost resentment : telling them, that it Avas but a short Avhile since she had, Avith her own eyes, seen and read an \" oath, by which some persons had engaged to kill her within a month.\" This Avas on the 12th November, and two days after, (14th,) the Queen sent the Commons a message by her Vice-chamberlain, Sir Christopher Hatton, requesting them to consider whether they could not devise some gentler expedient, by which her commiseration for the Scottish Queen might be allowed to operate, and her life be spared.1 On the 18th, after much debate, both Houses unani mously ansAve red, \" that they could find no other Avay ;\" and this brief but stern decision was forthwith carried bythe Lord Chancellor and the Speaker of the House of Commons to the Queen, Avho was then at Richmond. This communication, it was expected, would elicit something direct and definite from Elizabeth ; but the answer which she gave was one of studied ambi guity. \" If,\" said she, addressing the Chancellor, \" I should say unto you that I mean not to grant your 1 MS.

Since the breaking up of the Court at Fotheringay, she had remained there under the custody of Paulet, Avhose letters to Walsingham breathed a personal dislike to his prisoner. On the 22d November, Lord Buck hurst, and Mr Beal the clerk of the Privy-council, arrived at Fotheringay, and communicated to her the sentence of death, which had been pronounced by the Commissioners, its ratification by Parliament, and the earnest petition of both Houses for her immediate execution. They warned her not to look for mercy; spoke severely of her attachment to the Catholic faith, which made her life incompatible with the security of the reformed opinions ; and promised her the ministrations of a Protestant divine in her last hours. The Queen of Scots heard them with the utmost tranquillity, and mildly, but firmly, declined all such religious assistance. She declared that the judgment of the Court was unjust, as she was inno cent of all consent to the plot against Elizabeth's life ; but she implored them, in the name of Christ, to permit her to have the spiritual consolations of her Almoner, whom she knew to be in the castle, although debarred from her presence. For a brief period this 1 Parliamentary History, vol. iv. p. 298."], [396, "1586. 372 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. was granted: but the indulgence was considered too great, and he was once more removed. Farther and more studied insults were soon offered. On the day after the arriA-al of Buckhurst, Paulet entered her chamber Avithout ceremony, and informed her that, as she was noAV no longer to be considered a Queen, but a private woman dead in laAv, the insignia of royal ty must be dispensed with. Mary replied, that AArhat eA-er he or his SoATereign might consider her, did not much move her ; she Avas an anointed Princess, and had receiAred this dignity from God : into his hands alone would she resign both it and her soul.1 As for their Queen, she as little acknowledged her for her superior, as she did her heretical Council for her judges ; and, in spite of the indignities they offered, would die, as she had li\\red, a Queen. This spirited answergreatly enraged Paulet, who commanded Mary's attendants to take away the \"dais,\" or cloth of state; and, when they refused, called in some of his oavu people, who executed the order. He then put on his hat, sat down in her presence, and pointing to the billiard-table which stood in the chamber, ordered it to be removed, remarking, that these A'ain recreations no longer became a person in her situation. Such brutal and insolent conduct Avould have disgraced the commonest jailor in the kingdom; and the man who was guilty of this outrage, could plead no order from Elizabeth.2 1 Martyre de la Royne D'Escosse.

That Princess now gave orders that the sentence against the Queen of Scots should be proclaimed to the people ; and, so highly excited Avere the citizens in the metropolis Avith the real or fancied dangers which they had escaped, that the communi cation was received Avith every mark of public re joicing.1 To Mary it brought no neAV pang, so far as life was concerned ; but she became agitated Avith the suspicion that Elizabeth, to aA-oid the odium of a public execution, Avould endeavour to have her privately assassinated: and this neAV idea gave her the utmost inquietude.2 Nor, if we are to belieA-e Camden,3 Avere these ideal terrors.

So horrid an accusation against Leicester Avould require some decided proof, which the historian has not given ; and it Avill be afterwards seen, that Wal singham's aversion to such a course Avas exceedingly short-lived. It was at this time that Mary addressed her last letter to Elizabeth, in these touching and pathetic terms : \u2014 \" Madam \u2014 I bless God with my Avhole heart, that, by means of your final judgment, he is about to put a period to the wearisome pilgrimage of my life.

Henry the Third had never, during the long course of her misfortunes, exhibited for Mary any feelings of personal affection or deep interest, although, from political considerations, he had frequently es poused her cause ; but the idea that a Queen and a near relative should be arraigned, condemned, and executed, Avas so new and appalling, that he deemed it imperative to interfere, and sent Monsieur de Bel lieA-re his Ambassador to present his remonstrances to the English Queen. After many affected delays, Eliza beth received him in unusual state upon her throne, aud heard his message with a flashing eye paid flushed and angry countenance.2 She restrained her feelings, however, sufficiently to make a laboured reply, pronounced a high encomium upon her oavii for bearance, promised a speedy and definite ansAver, 1 Jebb, vol. ii. pp. 91, 92. 2 NoA'ember 27."], [400, "376 1586.

The English Queen, fired at this threat, demanded whether his master had empowered him to use such language ; and, having found that it Avas AA-arranted by Bellievre's instructions, Avrote a letter of lofty defiance to Henry, and dismissed his eiiA-oy. Aubespine the resident Ambassador reneAved the attempt ; but a pretended plot against the life of Elizabeth, Avhich was said to be traced to some of his suite, furnished a subject for a new and bitter quarrel, aud this, for a time, interrupted all amicable relations betAveen the tAvo CroAvns.1 On the side of Scotland, James' efforts were not more successful. This young prince had been early informed of the conspiracy by Walsingham, and had written to Elizabeth congratulating her upon the dis covery.2 The English Secretary had employed bis friend, the Master of Gray, to sound his royal mas ter as to the intended proceedings against the Queen -of Scots ; and bade that nobleman remind the young- King, that any mediation for Mary would come Avith a bad grace from a Prince whose father had received such hard measure at her hands.3 To confirm James in thesefeelings, care had been taken to send him an account of the plot, with full extracts 1 Carte, vol. iii. pp. 613, 614. 2 10th September.

In these letters, James must have perceived the seA-ere terms in which he Avas spoken of by Mary, and become acquainted Avith her advice given to Lord Claud Hamilton, to seize his person and place him under a temporary restraint. Such revelations Avere little calculated to foster or presen-e any sentiments of affection in a son toAvards a mother whom he had never knoAvn. Yet all this cannot excuse the coldness and indifference which he manifested. Monsieur de Courcelles, who was then in Scotland, received instructions from the French King to incite the young monarch to interfere for Mary; but he replied that his mother was in no danger, and as for the conspiracy, she must be contented, be said, to drink the ale she had breAA-ed. He loved her as much as nature and duty bound him; but he knew well she bore him as little good will as she did the Queen of England : her practices had already nearly cost him his crown*, and he could be Avell con tent she would meddle with nothing but prayer and serving of God.1 These selfish and moderate sentiments were far from acceptable to the Scottish nobles and people, who felt the treatment offered to the mother of their soA-ereign, and the superiority assumed by Elizabeth, as a national insult. Angus, Lord Claud Hamilton, Huntley, BotliAvell, Herries, and all the leading men about Court, protested loudly against her insolence ; 1 4th October.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and declared their resolution rather to break into open Avar, than suffer it to proceed to further extremity.1 On this subject, indeed, the feelings of the nobles had become so excited, as to impel them to speak out with fierce plainness to the King himself. James, it seems, suspected that Elizabeth would send an Am bassador, to persuade him to remain passive, whatever extremities might be adopted against his mother; and turning to the Earl of BothAvell, a blunt soldier, he asked his advice what he should do. If your Majesty, said he, suffers the process to proceed, I think, my liege, you should be hanged yourself, the day after. George Douglas, also, (the same brave and attached friend of Many, avIio had assisted in her escape from LochleA-en,) remonstrated in strong terms with his royal master; Avarninghim to beAA7are of giving credit to the lying tales of some about him, Avho were the pensioned slaA-es of Elizabeth, and paid to create bad blood between him and his parent. \" And yet,\" an- SAvered James, \"how is it possible for me to 1oatc her, or to approA-e her proceedings ? Did she not write to Fontenay, the French Ambassador here, that unless I conformed myself to her wishes, I should have no thing but the Lordship of Darnley ; wrhich was all my father had before me ? Has she not laboured to take the croAvn off my head, and set up a Regent ? Is she not obstinate in holding a different religion % \" \" For that matter,\" said Douglas, \" she adheres to her faith, in which she hath been brought up, as your 1 Extract of Courcelles' Negotiations, pp. 11, 13.

He Avrote a letter of strong and indignant remonstrance to Elizabeth, and despatched it by Sir William Keith, who Avas instructed to express himself boldly, and without reserve upon the subject. He, at the same time, and by the same Ambassador, addressed a threatening note to Walsingham, whom he considered his mother's greatest enemy; and he commanded Keith, on his arrival at the English Court, to cooperate with the French Ambassador in all his efforts for the safety of the unhappy Princess, Avhose fate seemed to be so fast approaching. He had already Avritten strongly to Archibald Douglas, his Ambassador at the English Court.1 But it was suspected, on good grounds, that Douglas was wholly in the hands of Elizabeth and Walsingham ; and currently said, that 1 Appendix to Robertson's History of Scotland, No. XLIX.

When at last admitted, the Queen affected the utmost solicitude for Mary's life ; but represented herself as driven to extremi ties by the remonstrances of her ministers, and the fears of her people. \" And yet,\" said she, turning to the Ambassador, \"I swear by the riving God, that I would give one of my OAvn arms to be cut off, so that any means could be found for us both to live in assurance.3 I have already,\" she continued, \"saA-ed her life, when even her oavii subjects craved her death; and iioav, judge for yourseh-es which is most just, that I who am innocent, or she who is guilty, should suffer.\"1 Repeated intervieAATs took place, and Elizabeth on one occasion declared, that no human power should ever persuade her to sign the warrant for Mary's execution; but in the mean time, the sentence against her had been made public. Leicester, Burghley, and Walsingham, advised her death. The people, alarmed by reports of the meditated invasion by Spain, and new plots against J Lodge's Letters, vol. ii. (8vo edit.) p. 295.

It was with the greatest difficulty that she Avas prevented from chasing Keith, aa-Iio had spoken with great boldness, from her presence. But Leicester her faA-ourite at last appeased her ; and, on the succeeding day, she dictated a more temperate reply to the young King. On his side also, James repented of his A-iolence, and, unfortunately for his own honour, was induced to adopt a milder tone; to write an apologetic letter to Elizabeth; and to despatch the Master of Gray and Sir Robert Melvil, with instructions, to explain that his \"meaning, in all that had hitherto been done,\" was modest and not menacing.2 Nothing could be more self ish and pusillanimous than such conduct. The Scottish nation and the nobility were loud in their expressions of indignation.

HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. ing more about his succession to the English Crown than the peril of his parent : and, intimidated by the A'iolence of Elizabeth, judged it better to conciliate than exasperate. It is difficult to believe that James had any very deep desire to save his mother's life, when he selected so base and unworthy an intercessor as the Master of Gray. The King must have knoAvn well that this man had alreadybetrayed her, that he was a sworn adherent of Elizabeth, and that Mary's safety or return to power and influence brought danger to this envoy himself. So fully were these Gray's feelings, that, in a letter to his friend Archibald Douglas, written as far back as October 11th, he described \" any good to Mary as a staff for their OAvn heads ;\" and assured him, \"he cared not although she were out of the way.\"1 The result was exactly Avhat might have been anticipated : Gray on his arriATal at the English Court, (29th December,) in his public con ferences with Elizabeth and her ministers, and in the open despatches intended for the eyes of the Scottish Council, exhibited great apparent activity and interest in the cause of the Scottish Queen. 2 But this Avas all unreal: for secretly he betrayed her; cooperated with Archibald Douglas in his enmity; AAThispered in Eliza beth's ear the significant proverb, \" The dead don't bite;\" persuaded her, that although there was much clamour, there was little sincerity in his master's 1 Lodge, vol. ii. 8vo edition, p. 289.

They proposed, that Mary should demit her right of succession to the English CroAvn to her son. \"How is that possible? \" said the Queen; \"she is declared * inhabil' and can convey nothing.\" \"If she have no rights,\" replied Gray, \"your Majesty need not fear her ; if she have, let her assign them to her son, in Avhom will then be placed the full title of succes sion to your Highness.\" \" What,\" said Elizabeth, with a loud voice and great oath ; \"get rid of one, and have a worse in her place ? Nay, then I put myself in a more miserable case than before. By God's Passion, that Avere to cut mine OAvn throat ; and for a duchy or an earldom to yourself, you, or such as you, Avould cause some of your desperate knaves to kill me. No, by God ! your master shall never be in that place.\" Gray then craved, that Mary's life might at least be spared for fifteen days, to give them time to commu nicate with the King : but this she peremptorily re fused. Melvil implored her to giAre a respite, Avere it only for eight days. \" No,\" said Elizabeth, rising up, and impatiently flinging out of the apartment, \" not for an hour.\"2 After such a reception, it Avas impos- 1 Camden in Kennet, vol. ii. p. 533. - Robertson's Appendix, No. L. : Memorial of the Master of Gray, 12th January, 1586-7-"], [408, "384 1586-7. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. sible not to anticipate the worst; and although, on a succeeding occasion, the Queen appeared someAA-hat mollified, the Ambassadors left her with the conviction, that fears for herself, and not any lingering feelings of mercy towards Mary, were the sole causes of her delay. It Avas at this time that the Scottish King, having required the ministers of the Kirk to pray for his unhappy mother, then in the toils of her enemies and daily expecting death, received a peremptory refusal. This was the more extraordinary, since James had carefully worded his request so as to remoA-e, as he thought, eA-ery possibility of opposition ; but finding himself deceiA'ed, he directed Archbishop Adamson to offer up his prayers for the Queen, in the High Church of the capital. To his astonishment he found, on entering his seat, that one of the recusant ministers, named CoAAq>er, had preoccupied the pulpit. The King addressed him from the gallery, told him that the place had been intended for another ; but added, that if he would pray for his mother, he might remain vriiere he was. To this, Cowper answered, that he Avould do as the Spirit of God directed him ; a signi ficant reply to all Avho kneAv the history of the times, and certainly amounting to a refusal. A scene of confusion ensued. James commanded Cowper to come doAATn from the pulpit : he resisted. The royal guard sprang forAvard to pull out the intruder ; and he descended, denouncing woe and wrath on all who held back; declaring too, that this hour would rise up in Avitness against the King, in the great day of the"], [409, "1586-7. 385 JAMES VI. Lord. Adamson then preached on the Christian duty of prayer for all men, with such pathetic eloquence, and so powerfully offered up his intercession for their unfortunate Queen, that the congregation separated in tears, lamenting the obstinacy of their pastors.1 Meanwhile, reports were circulated in England, which were artfully calculated to inflame the people, and to excuse seA-erity towards Mary. It was said one day, that the Spaniards had landed at Milford Haven, and that the Catholics had joined them ; the next, that Fotheringay Castle Avas attacked, and that the Queen of Scots had made her escape; then came rumours that the northern counties Avere already in rebellion, and that a new conspiracy was on foot to slay the Queen and set fire to London.2 Amidst these fictitious terrors, the Privy-council held repeated meetings, and pressed Elizabeth to give her warrant for the execution ; Leicester, Burghley, and Walsingham, entreated, argued, and remonstrated, but she continued distracted and irresolute between the odium which must follow the deed and its ne cessity; at last, amid her half sentences and dark hints, they perceiAred that their mistress wished Mary to be put to death, but had conceived a hope they would spare her the cruelty of commanding it, and find some secret way of despatching her ; she even seemed to think, that if their oath to \"the association\" for her protection did not lead to this, they had pro- 1 Spottiswood, p. 334. 2 Camden in Kennet, vol. ii. p. 533.

From such an interpretation of their engagement however they all shrunk. The idea of private assassination was ab horrent, no doubt, to their feelings; but they suspected, also, that Elizabeth's only object was to shift the re sponsibility of Mary's death from her shoulders to theirs ; and that nothing was more likely than that, the mo ment they had fulfilled her wishes, she should turn round, and accuse them of acting without orders. Mean while, she became hourly more unquiet, forsook her wonted amusements, courted solitude, and often was heard muttering to herself a Latin sentence taken from some of those books of Emblemata, or Aphor isms, which were the fashion of the day: Aid f er autferi; ne feriare, feri.1 This continued till the 1st of February, when the Queen sent for Mr Davison the secretary at ten in the morning. On arriving at the Palace, he found that the Lord Admiral Howard had been conversing with Elizabeth on the old point, the Scottish Queen's execution; and had received orders to send Secretary Davison to her with the warrant, which had already been drawn up by Burghley the Lord Trea surer,2 and lay in his possession unsigned. Davison hasted to his chamber, and coming instantly back with it, and some other papers in his hand, Avas called in by Elizabeth, who, after some talk on indifferent topics, asked him what papers he had with him. He replied. 1 Either strike or be stricken ; strike lest thou be stricken. Camden in Kennet, vol. ii. p. 534. 2 Caligula, C. ix. sol. 470.

She then inquired AAdietherhehad seen the Lord Admiral, and had brought the warrant for the Scottish Queen's execution. He declared he had, and delivered it into the Queen's hand; upon which she read it over, called for pen and ink, deliberately signed it, and then looking up asked him whether he was not heartily sorry she had done so. To this bantering question he replied gravely, that he preferred the death of the guilty before that of the innocent, and could not be sorry that her Majesty took the only course to protect her person from immi nent danger. Elizabeth then commanded him to take the warrant to the Chancellor and have it sealed, Avith her orders that it should be used as secretly as possible; and by the way, said she, relapsing again into a jocu lar tone, \" you may call on Walsingham and show it him : I fear the shock Avill kill him outright.\" She added that a public execution must be avoided. It should be done, she said, not in the open green or court of the castle, but in the hall. In conclusion, she for bade him absolutely to trouble her any farther or let her hear anymore till it was done; she, for her part, having performed all that in laAV or reason could be required.1 The secretary now gathered up his papers, and was taking his leave, when Elizabeth stayed him for a short space; and complained of Paulet and others, who might have eased her of this burden. Even now, said she, it might be so done, that the blame might be removed from myself, Avould you and Walsingham 1 Davison's Defence, drawn up by himself, in Caligula, C. ix. sol. 470, printed by Nicolas.

To this Davison consented, promising to let Sir Amias knoAVAA'hat sheexpected athis hands; andthe Queen, having again repeated in an earnest tone, that the matter must be closely handled, dismissed him.1 All this took place on the morning of the 1st of February. Inthe afternoon of that day, DaAdson visited Walsingham, showed him the warrant with Elizabeth's signature, consulted with him on the horrid com munication to be made to Paulet and Drury; and repairing to the Chancellor, had the Great Seal affixed to the warrant. The fatal paper was then left in the hands of that dignitary; and Walsingham and Davison the same evening wrote and despatched a letter to Fotheringay, recommending to her keepers, the secret -assassination of their royal charge, at the Queen their mistress' special request. This letter, taken from an original found amongst Paulet's own papers,2 was in these calm and measured terms : \u2014 To Sir Amias Paulet. \" After our hearty commendations.

With the letter, Davison sent an earnest injunction that it should be committed to the flames; promising for his part to burn, or as he styled it, \"make a heretic\" of the answer. Cruel and morose, however, as Paulet had undoubtedly been to Mary, he was not the common murderer which Elizabeth took him to be, aud refused, peremptorily, to have any hand in her horrid purpose. He received the letter on the 2d of February, at five in the afternoon, and at six the same evening, having communicated it to Drury, returned this answer to Walsingham. \"Your letters of yesterday, coming to my hands this present day at five in the afternoon, I would not fail, according to your directions, to return my answer with all possible speed ; which [I] shall deliver unto you with great grief and bitterness of mind, in that I am so unhappy to have liven to see this unhappy day, in the which I am required, by direction from my most gracious Sovereign, to do an act which God and the law forbiddeth.

This refusal, aSAve have seen, was written on the2d February, in the ev-ening, at Fotheringay ; and, next morning, (the 3d, Friday, ) Davison received an early and hasty summonsfrom Elizabeth, Avho called him into her chamber, and inquired if he had been with the warrant to the Chancellor's. He said he had ; and she asked sharply Avhy he had made such haste. \" I obeyed yourMajesty'scommands,\"washis reply; \"and deemed it no matter to be dallied with.\" \u2014 \" True,\" said she, \" yet methinks the best and safest way would be to have it otherwise handled.\" He answered to this, that, if it was to be done at all, the honourable way AA'as the safest;1 and the Queen dismissed him. But by this time the warrant, Avith the royal signature, was in the hands of the Council ; and on that day they addressed a letter, enclosing it, to the Earl of Shrewsbury. This letter was signed by Burghley the Lord Treasurer, Leicester, Hunsdon, Knollys, Wal singham, Derby, Howard, Cobham, Sir Christopher Hattou, and Davison himself.2 Yet some fears as to the responsibility of sending it away without the Queen's knoAvledge, made them still hesitate to de spatch it. In this interval, Paulet's answer arrived ; and as Walsingham, to whom he had addressed it, was sick, (or, as some said, pretended illness,) the task of communicating it to Elizabeth fell on Davison. She read it with symptoms of great impatience; and, breaking out into passionate expressions, declared that she hated those dainty, nice, precise fellows, who 1 Davison's Apology, in Nicolas' Life, Appendix A. 2 Ellis's Letters, 2d series, vol. iii. pp. Ill, 112."], [416, "1586-7. 392 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. promised much, but performed nothing: casting all the burden on her. But, she added, she would have it done without him, by Wingfield. Who this new assassin was, to whom the Queen alluded, does not appear.1 The Privy-council, meanwhile, had determined to take the responsibility of sending off the warrant for the execution upon themselves; and, for this purpose, intrusted it to Beal the clerk of the Council ; who, on the evening of Saturday the 4th of February, ar rived Avith it at the seat of the Earl of Kent; and, next day, being Sunday, proceeded to Fotheringay and com municated it to Sir Amias Paulet and Sir Drew Drury.2 Intelligence was then sent to the Earl of ShreAvsbury, Grand Marshal of England, who lived at no great distance from Fotheringay; and, on Tuesday morning, the 7th February, this nobleman and the Earl of Kent came to the castle Avith several persons who were to give directions or to be employed in the approaching tragedy. For some days before this, Mary's sen-ants had suspected the worst; but the pre parations which noAV took place, and the arrival of so many strangers, threAV them into despair. On Tuesday after dinner, at two o'clock, the two Earls demanded an audience of the Queen of Scots, avIio sent word that she was indisposed and in bed; but if the matter were of consequence, she would rise and receive them. On their reply that it could brook no delay, they were admitted after a short interval ; and Kent and Shrewsbury coming into the apartment, 1 Davison's Defence ; Nicolas' Life of Davison, p. 103 ; and Id.

Avith Paulet, Drury, and Beal, found her seated at the bottom of her bed, her usual place, with her small Avork-table before her.1 Near her stood her physician, Burgoin, and her women. When the Earls uncovered, she received them Avith her usual tranquil grace ; and ShreAvsbury, in few words, informed her that his royal mistress, Elizabeth, being overcome by the importunity of her subjects, had given orders for her execution ; for which she would iioav be pleased to hear the Avar rant. Beal then read the commission; to which she listened unmoved and without interrupting him. On its conclusion she boAved her head, and, making the sign of the cross, thanked her gracious God that this welcome news had, at last, come ; declaring how happy she should be to leave a world where she was of no use, and had suffered such continued affliction. She assured the lords that she regarded it as a signal happiness, that God had sent her death at this moment, after so many evils and sorrows endured for his Holy Catholic Church: \"That Church,\" she con tinued, with great fervour of expression, \" for which I have been ready, as I have often testified, to lay down my life, and to shed my blood drop by drop. Alas,\" she continued, \"I did not think myself worthy of so happy a death as this ; but I acknoAvledge it as a sign of the love of God, and humbly receive it as an earnest of my reception into the number of his ser vants.

She had loved Eng land ; she had desired its prosperity, as the next heir to that Crown ; and, as far as was permitted to a good Catholic, had laboured for its welfare. She had earnestly longed for the love and friendship of her good sister the Queen ; had often informed her of coming dangers ; had cherished, as the dearest wish of her heart, that for once she should meet her in person, and speak with her in confidence ; being well assured that, had this ever happened, there would have been an end of all jealousies and dissensions. But all had been refused her ; her enemies, who still lived and acted for their own interests, had kept them asunder. She had been treated with ignominy and in justice; imprisoned contrary to all faith and treaties; kept a captive for nineteen years; \"and, at last,\" said she, laying her hand upon the New Testament which was on her table, \" condemned by a tribunal which had no power over me, for a crime of which I here solemnly declare I am innocent.1 I have neither 1 La Mort de la Royne D'Escosse, p. 618."], [419, "1586-7. JAMES AT. 395 invented, nor consented to, nor pursued any conspi racy for the death of the Queen of England.\" The Earl of Kent here hastily interrupted her, declaring that the translation of the Scriptures on which she had sworn was false, and the Roman Catholic version, which invalidated her oath. \"It is the translation in which I believe,\" answered Mary, \" as the version of our Holy Church. Does your lordship think my oath would be better if I swore on your translation, which I disbelieve ? \" She then entreated to be allowed the services of her priest and almoner, who was in the castle, but had not been permitted to see her since her remoATal from Chartley. He would assist her, she said, in her preparations for death, and administer that spiritual consolation, which it would be sinful to receive from any one of a different faith. To the disgrace of the noblemen, the request was refused : nor was this to be attributed to any cruelty in Eliza beth, who had given no instructions upon the subject; but to the intolerant bigotry of the Earl of Kent, Avho, in a long theological discourse, attempted to con- A-ert her to his own opinions ; offering her, in the place of her confessor, the services of the Protestant Dean of Peterborough, Dr Fletcher, whom theyhad brought with them. Mary expressed her astonishment at this last unexpected stroke of cruelty ; but bore it meekly as she had done all the rest, although she peremptorily declined all assistance from the Dean. She then in quired what time she should die; aud the Earls haA-ing answered \" To-morrow at eight in the morning,\" made"], [420, "396 1586-7. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. their obeisance, and left the room. On their departure she called her Avomen, and bade them hasten supper, that she might have time to arrange her affairs. No thing could be more natural, or rather playful, than her manner at this moment. \"Come, come,\" said she, \"Jane Kennedy, cease weeping, and be busy. Did I not warn you, my children, that it would come to this? and now, blessed be God! it has come, and fear and sorrow are at an end. Weep not then, nor lament, but rejoice rather that you see your poor mistress so near the end of all her troubles. Dry your eyes, then, and let us pray together.\" Her men-servants, who were in tears, then left the room, and Mary passed some time in devotion with her ladies. After which she occupied herself in counting the money which still remained in her Cabinet ; dividing it into separate sums, which she intended for her servants ; and then putting each sum into a little purse with a slip of paper, on Avhich she wrote, Avith her oavii hand, the name of the person for whom it Avas destined. Supper was next brought in, of which she partook sparingly, as was usual Avith her; con versing from time to time with Burgoin her physician, Avho served her ; and sometimes falling into a reverie, during which it Avas remarked that a SAveet smile, as if she had heard some good news, Avould pass over her features, lighting them up Avith an expression of animated joy, which, much changed as she was by sor row and ill health, recalled to her poor servants her days of beauty. It was Avith one of these looks that, turning to her physician, she said, \" Did you remark,"], [421, "1586-7. JAMES VI. 397 Burgoin, what that Earl of Kent said in his talk Avith me: that my life Avould haA-e been the death, as my death Avould be the life of their religion ? Oh, hoAV glad am I at that speech ! Here comes the truth at last, and I pray you remark it. They told me I was to die, because I had plotted against the Queen ; but then arrives this Kent, whom they sent hither to con- A-ert rne,andwhat says he? I am to die for niy religion.\"1 After supper, she called for her ladies, and asking for a cup of wine, drank to them all, begging them to pledge her ; which they did on their knees, mingling their tears in the cup, and asking her forgiveness if they had ever offended her. This she readily gave them, bidding them farewell with much tenderness, entreating in her turn their pardon, and solemnly enjoining them to continue firm in their religion, and forget all their little jealousies, living in peace and love with each other. It would be easier to do so now, she added, since Nau, who had been so busy in creating dissensions, was no longer with them. This Avas the only subject on AAdiich she felt and expressed herself with something like keenness ; repeating more than once, that he was the cause of her death, but adding that she forgave him. She next examined her AA-ardrobe, and selected various dresses as presents to her servants, delivering them at the moment, Avith some kind expression to each. She then wrote to her almoner, lamenting that the cruelty of her enemies had refused her the consolation of his presence Avith 1 Camden in Kennet, vol. ii. p. 534. Mort de la Royue D'Es cosse.

By this time it was two in the morning, and finding herself fatigued, she lay down, having first washed her feet, whilst her women watched and read at her bedside. They observed that, though quite still and tranquil, she was not asleep, her lips moving, as if engaged in secret prayer. It was her custom to have her women read to her at night a portion of the \" Lives of the Saints,\" a book she loved much ; and this last night she would not omit it, but made Jane Kennedy choose a portion, for their usual devotions. She selected the life entitled, \" The Good Thief,\" Avhich treats of that beautiful and affecting example of dying faith and divine com passion. \"Alas !\" said Mary, \" he was indeed a very great sinner, but not so great as I am. May my Saviour, in memory of His Passion, have mercy on me, as he had on him, at the hour of death.\"2 At this moment she recollected that she would require a handkerchief to bind her eyes at her execution; and bidding them bring her several, she selected one of the finest, which was embroidered with gold, lay ing it carefully aside. Early in the morning she rose, observing that now she had but two hours to live ; and having finished her toilet she came into her ora tory, and kneeling with her women before the altar, 1 The letters are preserved, and will be found printed in Jebb, vol. ii. pp. 627, 630. 2 Mort de la Royne D'Escosse, Jebb, toL'S. p. 631."], [423, "1586-7. JAMES VI. 399 Avhere they usually said mass, continued long in prayer. Her physician then, afraid of her being exhausted, begged her to take a little bread and Avine; which she did cheerfully, thanking him, at the same time, for giving her her last meal. A knock was now heard at the door, and a mes senger came to say that the Lords Avaited for her. She begged to be allowed a short time to conclude her devotions. Soon after, a second summons ar riving, the door was opened, and the sheriff alone, with his white wand, walked into the room, proceeded to the altar, where the still knelt, and informed her that all Avas ready. She then rose, saying simply, \"Let us go;\" and Burgoin her physician, Avho assisted her to rise from her knees, asking her at this moment Avhether she Avould not wish to take with her the little cross and ivory crucifix Avhich lay on the altar, she said : \" Oh yes, yes ; it was my intention to have done so : many, many thanks for putting me in mind ! \" She then received it, kissed it, and desired Annibal, one of her suite, to carry it before her. The sheriff, Avalk ing first, now conducted her to the door of the apart ment ; on reaching Avhich, her servants, who had fol lowed her tints far, were informed that they must now turn back, as a command had been given that they should not accompany their mistress to the scaffold. This stern and unnecessary order was received by them with loud remonstrances and tears ; but Mary only observed, that it Avas hard not to suffer her poor servants to be present at her death. She then took the crucifix in her hand, and bade them affectionately"], [424, "1586-7. 400 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. adieu ; whilst they clung in tears to her robe, kissed her hand, and were with difficulty torn from her, and locked up in the apartment. The Queen after this proceeded alone down the great staircase, at the foot of Avhich she Avas received by the Earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, who were struck with the perfect tranquil lity and unaffected grace with which she met them. She was dressed in black satin, matronly, but richly ; and Avith more studied care than she was commonly accustomed to bestoAV. She wore a long veil of white crape, and her usual high Italian ruff ; an Agnus Dei AATas suspended by a pomander chain round her neck, and her beads of gold hung at her girdle. At the bottom of the staircase she found Sir Andrew Melvil, her old affectionate servant, and Master of her Household, waiting to take his last farewell. On seeing her he flung himself on his knees at her feet, and bitterly lamented it should haA7e fallen on him to carry to Scotland the heart-rending news of his dear mistress' death. \" Weep not, my good Mel vil,\" said she, \" but rather rejoice that an end has at last come to the sorrows of Mary Stuart.

Upon it were' placed a Ioav chair and cushion, two other scats. 1 La Mort de la Royne D'Escosse, Jebb, vol. ii. pp. 635, 636. VOL. VIII. 2 D"], [426, "402 1586-7. HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. and the block. The Queen regarded it without the least change of countenance, cheerfully mounted the steps, and sat doAvn Avith the same easy grace and dignity with which she would have occupied her throne. On her right Avere seated the Earls of Kent and Shrewsbury, on her left stood the Sheriffs, and before her the tAvo executioners. The Earl of Kent, the Dean of Peterborough, Sir Amias Paulet, Sir DreAV Drury, Beal the Clerk of the PriA'y-council, and others stood beside the scaffold ; and these, with the guards, officers, attendants, and some of the neighbouring gentry, who had been permitted to be present, made up an assembly of about two hundred in all. Beal then read the warrant for her death, which she beard Avith apparent attention ; but those near her could see, by the sweet and absent expres sion of her countenance, that her thoughts were far off. When it was finished, she crossed herself, and ad dressed a few words to the persons round the scaffold. She spoke of her rights as a Sovereign Princess, which had been invaded and trampled on, and of her long sorrows and imprisonment ; but expressed the deepest thankfulness to God, that, being now about to die for her religion, she was permitted, before this compan}r, to testify that she died a Catholic, and innocent of having invented any plot, or consented to any practices against the Queen's life. \" I will here,\" said she, \" in my last moments, accuse no one; but when I am gone, much will be discovered that is now hid, and the objects of those who have procured my death be more clearly disclosed to the Avorld.\""], [427, "1586-7. 403 JAMES VI. Fletcher the Dean of Peterborough iioav came up upon the scaffold, and, with the Earl of Kent and Shrewsbury, made an ineffectual attempt to engage Mary in their devotions ; but she repelled all their offers, at first mildly, and afterwards, when they in sisted on her joining with them in prayer, in more peremptory terms. It was at this moment that Kent, in the excess of his Puritanism, observing her intensely regarding the crucifix, bade her renounce such antiquated superstitions : \" Madam,\" said he, \" that image of Christ serves to little purpose, if you have him not engraved upon your heart.\" \u2014 \"Ah,\" said Mary, \" there is nothing more becoming a dying- Christian than to carry in his hands this remembrance of his redemption. Hoav impossible is it to have such an object in our hands and keep the heart un moved!\"1 ' The Dean of Peterborough then prayed in English, being joined by the noblemen and gentlemen aa-1io Avere present ; whilst Mary, kneeling apart, repeated portions of the Penitential Psalms in Latin,2 and afterwards continued her prayers aloud in English.

She declared that her whole hope rested on her Saviour; and, although she confessed that she AA-as a great sinner, she humbly trusted that the blood of that immaculate Lamb, w-hich had been shed for all sinners, Avould wash all her guilt away. She then invoked the blessed Virgin and all the saints, im ploring them to grant her their prayers with God ; and finally declared that she forgave all her enemies. It was impossible for any one to behold her at this moment without being deeply affected; on her knees, her hands clasped together and raised to HeaA'en, an expression of adoration and divine serenity lighting up her features, and upon her lips the AArords of forgiveness to her persecutors. As she finished her devotions she kissed the crucifix, and, making the sign of the cross, exclaimed in a clear, SAveet voice, \" As thine arms, O my God, Avere spread out upon the cross, so receive me within the arms of thy mercy : extend thy pity, and forgive my sins ! \" She then cheerfully suffered herself to be undressed by her tAvo Avomen, Jane Kennedy and Elizabeth Curie, and gently admonished them not to distress her by their tears and lamentations ; putting her finger on her lips, and bidding them remember that she had promised for them. On seeing the executioner come up to offer his assistance, she smiled, and playfully said she had neither been used to such grooms of the chamber, nor to undress before so many people. When all was ready she kissed her two Avomen, and, giving them her last blessing, desired them to leave"], [429, "1586-7. 405 JAMES VI. her, one of them having first bound her eyes with the handkerchief AA-hich she had chosen for the purpose. She then sat doAvn, and, clasping her hands together, held her neck firm aud erect, expecting that she was to be beheaded in the French fashion, Avith a SAVord, and in a sitting attitude. Those Avho AA-ere present, and knew nothing of this misconception, Avondered at this; and in the pause, Mary, still AA-aiting for the bloAv, repeated the psalm, \" In thee, 0 Lord, have I trusted : let me neA-er be put to confusion.\"1 On being made aware of her mistake she instantly knelt doAvn, and, groping Avith her hands for the block, laid her neck upon it without the slightest mark of trembling or hesitation. Her last Avords were, \" Into thy hands I commend my spirit, for Thou hast re deemed me, 0 Lord God of truth.\" At this moment the tears aud emotions of the spectators had reached their height, and appear, unfortunately, to have shaken the nerves and disturbed the aim of the executioner, so that his first bloAVAA-as ill directed, and only wounded his victim.

Bowes to Burghlea.1 \"Edinburgh, April iStk, 1578. '\u2022 May it please your Lordship. On Saturday last, about six in the morning, the Earl of Mar, accompanied with the Abbots of Dryburgh and Cambuskenneth, and their servants ordinarily lodged in the Castle of Stirling, came to the castle gate, with pretence to go a- hunting; and finding there the Master and his servants, the Abbots called the Master aside, charging him that he had much abused the Earl of Mar his nephew, and far overseen himself in withholding the custody of the King and castle from the Earl. The Master after reasonable excuse made, found that they pressed to possess the keys, and command the piece; and reaching himself to an halbert, his servants came to assist him. Dryburgh and some with him stayed the Master; Cambuskenneth aud his complices assaulted the rest; when Buchanan, one of the Master's men, was sore hurt. After the fray pacified, the Master and the Abbots with draw themsehes to the hall to debate tho matter; and Argyle, being then a-bed, rose speedily, and came with a small number to the hall, where, hearing that the Master and the Abbots were in 1 Orig.

But the Master being then fully satisfied, Argyle was likewise soon after appeased; and then yielding possession for the Earl, they agreed at length to remove thence, and draw to concord, specially to satisfy the King, who of the tumult, as is reported, was in great fear, and teared his hair, saying the Master was slain. Aud as I am informed, his Grace by night, bath been by this means so discouraged, as in his sleep he is here with greatly disquieted. After all this was ended, the Earls of Argyle and Mar, the two Abbots and Mr Buchanan,1 advertised by their letters this Council of this accident; declaring that the parties were well reconciled ; and persuaded the Council to proceed forwards in the course determined for the government, as no such matter had happened, Argyle departed out of the castle, and he is now gone to levy his forces, meaning to return within two days at the farthest. \" In this uproar, the eldest son of the Master was so crushed in the throng, as he died the next day. The Master is fallen into vehement disease with danger of his life. \"Upon the coming of the said letters from Stirling, on Saturday about nine in the afternoon, the Council assembled ; and after some hot humours digested, they despatched Montrose that night towards Stirling, to understand, and certify to them the true state of the matter, to persuade quietness about the King's person, and to con tinue this present government established until the next Parliament. \" Montrose, after long abode at the Lord of Livingston's house, came to Stirling in the next day, and was received into the castle. He putteth the Council in good hope that the matter is well paci fied, and that this government shall not by this accident be im peached. Whereupon the most part of this Conncil, pretending to have the King's letters commanding their repair to him, are departed this day towards Stirling; but what shall ensue hereof is greatly doubted. \"Lochleven being speedily advertised of the doings of the Abbots, came the same day to Stirling, and with some difficulty, (as out wardly was showed,) was let into the castle with one servant, whom presently he returned to Lochleven to the Earl of Morton, and himself remaineth still in the castle. The Earl of Morten, 1 This was the celebrated Buchanan."], [435, "411 PROOFS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. upon the first advertisement, came to Lochleven; despatched his servant to the Earl of Angus, to put all his friends and forces in a readiness on an hour's warning. And many noblemen, being friends to these two Earls, have done the like ; nevertheless they show no force nor assembly as yet. \"The Lords of the Council have likewise levied all their powers, drawing some part with all possible speed towards Stirling, aud leaving the residue in readiness upon warning. \" Some are of opinion, that the Council will be readily received and welcomed to the King and to all the castle, without further change; and many think that, by the means of the Abbots, the King shall cause them to retire to their own houses, till his pleasure be further known. And in case they disobey the same ; then to lay siege and take the castle. That then the King will cause the Earl of Morton and other nobles to levy their power within the realm, to raise the siege, and rescue his person from their violence. AVhat storm shall fall out of these swelling heats doth not yet appear. But I think, verily, and that within two or three days, that it will burst into some open matter ; discovering sufficiently the purposes intended ; wherein, to my power, I shall seek to quench all violent rages, and persuade unity and concord among them; which, if this sudden chance had not happened, might easily have taken place.

It is as follows : \u2014 Hunsdon to Burghlew \"Berwick, August 1.0, 1578. \" My very good Lord \u2014 I will not trouble your Lordship with any long discourse touching this matter in Scotland.\" Hunsdon then refers Burghley to Mr Bowes' letter, \" who,\""], [436, "412 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. he says, '\u25a0\u25a0 has the greatest merit in bringing about peace : otherwise there had been such a slaughter as would not have been appeased in Scotland these many years, the malice of the lords and their adherents, especially the Wardens of Tevydale and the Merse and their bands, which was their greatest force against Morton, was so great and so desirous of revenge. They of the Merse made them a standard of blue sarcenet, and in it a child painted within a grate, with this speech out of his month, ' Liberty I crave, and cannot it have.' They seemed to answer under it, ' Either you shall have it, or we will die for it ;' so as though their malice to Morton was their quarrel indeed, yet they made the detaining of the King their colour. \" My Lord, the Queen's Maj: hath now both sides at her devo tion, and the party of Atholl and Argyle more in show than the King's ; for the King's side terms the others Englishmen, because they were contented to put the whole of their causes to her Majesty, which the other lords, being required of Mr Bowes to do the like, Morton utterly refused the same, saying that the K. and his Council would end them. But if Mr Bowe.i' travel, and some other means, had not taken place, it was very like that Morton had been hard bested ; for although the King's side were something more in number, yet were the others better chosen men, far better horsed and armed, and, besides, few of them but, either for their own causes or their friends, bare Morton a deadly hatred and sour de sire of revenge, which was but in few of the King's side against any of the other lords.

I found the like devotion of the whole nobility there towards them, and not willing to pity their cause; and thought not only discourtesy in receiving them in England, but as much in soliciting their causes, being so odious murderers to the King's dearest friends; yet seeming to be grate ful of her Majesty's good QwilFJ in forewarning the danger that might happen to the King's estate by their banishment into foreign countries, being of so great a house aud quality.

He also, in a private access to the King, ]aid before him his estate at large : the King took all well. \"All this time the Earl of Lennox made private means to speak with Randolph, standing still upon his purgation, which (being so commanded) he still resisted, which, notwithstanding grieved him much, as he understood a reconciliation was about to be wrought between Lennox and Morton, and the King approved"], [446, "422 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. of it ; and was to have gone to Glasgow the better to contrive the matter; 'albeit that purpose took not effect ; for Morton's friends, esteeming this course dishonourable, broke it off.' \"It was next determined to send Lord Seton from the King to her Maj. \"This staid by Randolph. \"The bruit of the gathering of English forces on the Borders continuing, it was determined to appoint a Lieutenant and 12 Captains, with commissions to levy 120 men. \" All this time, as matters grew worse, Mr Randolph omitted not underhand to procure a party, labouring by all means to make Morton's case fearful unto them, and the greatness of Lennox odious ; alluring them by promises of Elizabeth's support. Not withstanding all, velprece velpretio, though many seemed forward, no man would be foremost, \u2014 no assurance could be had except on Angus, Mar, and Glencairn. They said also, there was a want of sufficient proof of the matters with which Lennox was charged withal. \" On the other hand, the friends of Lennox were not idle, and made a great impression, urging, that Elizabeth's injustice and severity against an innocent man, showed she had more in view than the trial of Morton and the dismissal of D'Aubigny. \"At last, the 20th February, the day of the Convention, ar rived.

The bruit of wars grew stronger, \u2014 men stirring in all parts, \u2014 the ambassador grew odious and his death suspected, and the Court in a manner desperate. For all this, he forbore not to call for his answer : the Council was perplexed, and Lennox still stood up to his justi fication. \" Morton abode still at Dumbarton, straitlier kept than before, (although his larger liberty was craved by the ambassador.) Angus absented himself from the Court ; and being suspected of dealing with the ambassador, made Lennox, Montrose, and Argyle, and that party, stand on their guard.

This pro mised meeting of commissioners on the Borders might have been to good purpose, had it not been for the discovery of the practices between Angus and the ambassador, by Angus and Morton's own servants, which caused the ambassador to be greatly suspected and disliked. Whereupon all persons were examined that resorted to him, viz. George Fleck the laird of Mains, the laird of Spot, John Reid, and Whittingham,2 all servants and nearest kinsmen to Morton and Angus. Angus himself was banished beyond the Spey.

The faithless and traitorous dealing of Whit tingham was most noted, like a deep dissembler and fearful wretch. From the beginning, having had the handling and knowledge of all matters of importance and secrecy between Angus and the rest, in the end, without compulsion, by a voluntary confession he discovered their whole proceedings, not regarding his nearness of blood, or bond of duty to the Earls of Angus and Morton, or the danger he threw the other noblemen into. This man's treachery made Angus be put to the horn, and the ambassador ill handled. The King upon this intending to acquaint Elizabeth with the result of the confessions by an -envoy, and proceeding with greater seve rity against Angus, Morton, and Mar. Randolph, finding his longer abode useless, and dangerous to himself, retired to Berwick, there to await her Majesty's further orders. Within two days a gentleman from Angus and Mar came to him to declare their state, and wishing to know when and where they were to await his coming. But finding their party not sufficiently strong nor trustworthy, it was thought imprudent to hazard the advance of her Majesty's forces ; and so the messenger was dismissed. Thus -were they deserted. In the meantime, news came daily of their proscription, and seizing their houses, summoning of Stirling Castle held by Mar, fortifying Leith, \u2014 at last they heard that Mar was reconciled, and Angus left alone.

And likewise, he touched the present sent by the Duke of Guise to the King in these manner of speeches : \u2014 ' I pray you what should move Guise, that bloody persecutor and enemy unto all truth, that pillar of the Pope, to send this present by one of his trustiest servants unto our King ? Not for any love : no, no, his pretence is known. And I beseech the Lord the Church of Scotland feel it not oversoon. The King's Majesty was per suaded not to receive it ; for why ? What amity or friendship can we look for at his hands, who hath been the bloodiest persecutor of the professors of the truth in all France? Neither was there ever any notable murder or havoc of God's people at any time in all France but he was at it in person ; and yet for all this, the Duke and Arran will needs have our King to take a present from him. If God did threaten the captivity and spoil of Jerusalem because that their King, Hezekiah, did receive a letter and present from the King of Babylon, shall we think to be free committing the like, or rather worse ? And because you, my Lords, which both do see me, and even at this present hears me, \u2014 I say, because you shall not be hereafter excusable, \u2014 I tell it yon with tears. I feel such confusion to be like to ensue that I fear me will be the subversion and ruin of the preaching of God's Evangile here in the Church of Scotland. I am the more plain with you, because I know there is some of you in the same action with the rest. I know I shall be called to an account for these words here spoken ; but let them do with this carcass of mine what they will, for I know my soul is in the hands of the Lord, aud, therefore, I will speak, and that to your condemnation, unless you speedily return.' And then, in the prayers made, he prayed unto the Lord, either to convert or confound the Duke.

The minute and accurate information of Bowes communicated to Walsingham and the faction of the Protestant Lords, which led to the enterprise termed the Raid of Ruthven, is proved by the following extract from a letter of Sir Robert Bowes to Walsingham, dated Durham, 15th August, 1582: \u2014 Bowes to Walsingham. a \u00ab -::- -:;- j am infornied the Duke intendeth to persuade the King's Majesty to commit to ward the Earls of Gleucairn and Mar, the Lord Lindsay and Boyd, and sundry others best affected in religion, and loving the amity aforesaid ; aud also afterwards to hasten the death of the principals of them, whom I hear that he will not pursue for the death of David the Italian, (as from France ye have been advertised,) but rather to charge them with late matter and conspiracy intended, and to have been put in execu tion by them and their complices in the last month of July against the King and himself.

After stating that the King was with the Duke at St Johnston, he observed, that \" the ministers had accused the Duke of supporting the Bishop of Glasgow, who was excommunicated.\" He then adds, \"The Duke is about to charge them with the late conspiracy and practice, wherein they, were about to have procured him to haA'e been shot and slain.\" * * X.

In the month of May, 1583, when James was pondering on the plot for the recovery of his liberty, and his escape from the thraldom in which he was kept by the Ruthven lords, there occurs a re markable letter written by Fowler to Walsingham, which shows that the young King had first disclosed his secret intentions to the Master of Glammis. This is strange enough ; for Glammis, as we have seen, (supra, p. 125,) was one of the leaders of the \" Raid of Ruthven.\" The letter is as follows. \u2014 It is preserved in Brit.

Historical Remarks on the Queen of Scots' supposed Accession to Babington's Conspiracy. That Mary was a party to this plot, so far as it involved a pro ject for her escape, may be assumed as certain ; indeed, she ap pears to have admitted it, by implication at least, on her trial. But the question remains, and it is one deeply affecting Elizabeth and her ministers \u2014 was she cognizant of the resolution to assassi nate the English Queen? \u2014 did she permit, or encourage this atro cious design ? After a careful research into the history of this conspiracy, and an anxious desire to procure and weigh every do cument connected with it, I believe Mary's solemn assertion to be true, \u2014 that she neither ga\\-e any encouragement to the plot, nor was aware of its existence. Hume, who pronounces Mary guilty, has written on this conspiracy with all his inimitable clearness and plausibility; but unfortunately with much of his usual carelessness as to facts and dates, which enter deeply into the question, and which a little trouble might have enabled him to discover and to rectify. Dr Lingard, in an acute note added to the last edition of his His tory,1 has supported Mary's innocence ; and Dr Robertson, with out interrupting his narrative by critical remarks, has assumed it. Referring the reader to the works of these eminent men, I shall now briefly give some additional facts and observations, from which there arises the strongest presumption, if not absolute proof, of the. innocence of the Queen of Scots. First. It is evident, from the history of this conspiracy as given in the text, that Phelipps the decipherer had much, almost everything, in his power as to the proof of Mary's guilt or inno cence. He was admitted by Walsingham into all \" the secrets of the cause,\" (to use Paulet's phrase;) he enjoyed the full confi dence of this minister and his royal mistress. It does not appear that any other person about Walsingham or the Queen of England could decipher. There are letters in the State-paper Office, and in the British Museum, which prove that whenever any inter cepted letters in cipher fell into the hands of Elizabeth or Secre tary Walsingham, they were forthwith sent to Phelipps \" to be 1 Note M. vol. viii. History of England, p. 434."], [464, "440 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. made English;\"1 and it is certain that he did decipher, and retain in his hands for ten days, the letter in cipher from Mary to Babington, upon a copy of which that Princess was convicted. It is evident from all this, that Phelipps had the power and the opportunity to alter the letters of Babington or of Mary which were sent him to be deciphered ; and owing to the ignorance of his employers in this intricate science, he might have done so without much, or almost any fear of discovery. But it may be asked, Could he be so base as to garble these letters ? or was AValsingham so lost to all sense of justice and honour as to haA-e permitted it? To this I reply, that there is preserved in the State-paper Office a letter or petition of Phelipps to the Earl of Salisbury, an extract from which I give below, which proves, that in one noted instance he had availed himself of his talents and opportunity to a base and unscrupulous extent. In this case, he did not add to or alter any letter placed in his hands ; but he did much more. He composed, or created, an entirely imaginary correspondence. He wrote let ters under the name of an imaginary person to a real person, who enjoyed the confidence of the Spanish Government, and who, by the forgery of these letters, was betrayed into a correspondence with Phelipps, who made his own uses of his base contrivance. All this he acknowledges in a letter to the Earl of Salisbury, which is an undoubted original, written in his own hand,2 pleading 1 MS. Letter, Caligula, C. ix., sol. 455, Davison to Phelipps, 11th Dec. Davison to Phelipps. \" Mr Phelipps.

When you have made English thereof, I doubt not but you will return it back to her Highness : and so, in the meantime, I commit you to God.\u2014 At the Court the 11th De cember.\" There is another letter of AA'alsingham in Caligula, C. ix., sol. 455, written, I think, evidently to Phelipps, though the address does not appear: \u2014 \" I send you herewith enclosed another letter, written from the King of Spain unto some noblemen within this realm, which was delivered unto me by her Majesty, together with the other letter of Don Bernardino remaining in your hands, which, if it may be deciphered, will, I hope, lay open the treachery that reigneth here amongst us.

Such being the unscrupulous character of this person, is it any overstrained supposition, that such a man would have felt little hesitation in altering the letters of the Queen of Scots, to suit the purposes of her enemies ? But here it is asked, (and the argument is insisted on by Hume,) \u2014 would a man of such high honour and probity as Walsingham, have been guilty of so base a proceeding ? As to this alleged probity and honour, Hume, it is evident, trusted to the common eulogies which, in popular works, have been bestowed on Eliza bethan statesmen. Happily, however, the correspondence of Eliza beth's ministers remains to test this praise ; and Walsingham has left many letters which prove, incontestably, that, in working out any object which he was persuaded was for the good of the State, he descend iuto a gracious consideration of his case, and he doubteth not but his Majesty shall find cause to conceive much better of his proceedings than it seemeth he doth. '' The truth is, that there never was any real or direct correspondence held with Owen. But, by a mere stratagem and sleight in the late Queen's time, that State upon an occasion, was entertained in an opinion of an intelligence with an imaginary person on this side, such as was none in rerum nalurd, which Owen, abused, did manage on that side, as Phelipps for the Queen's service did on this. The manner whereof and the means were particu larly declared to my Lord of Salisbury by Ph. when he was first called in question, who had himself made some use of it in the Queen's time ; and you, Mr Lieutenant can, best of any man, remember how the Queen and my Lord of Essex served themselves of it. \" In the carnage of this business, the imaginary correspondent being pressed to find somebody that should set afoot certain overtures, touching peace and the jewels of the House of Burgundy, and such like, Phelipps was nominated and used for those purposes, to the contentment of both sides, as it fell out at sundry times, without that it was known, or so much as suspected, that Phelipps was the man that indeed managed all matters. \" AVith the Queen's life this course was supposed to have been quite deter mined ; but shortly after, upon the hope of amity, which was growing be tween this realm and Spain, an address was newly made to the imaginary correspondent in Maucididor's name, to have Phelipps moved to concur with those that should be set a-work both for peace and league of firm amity be tween the Princes, with large offers, and promises of honourable gratification to all such as could do any good therein. \" Which being a thing in itself not unlawful, and Phelipps seeing oppor tunity offered him to make himself thereby of use, he willingly embraced.\" * * *"], [466, "442 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. was quite as crafty and unscrupulous as his brethren. In those dark times, the scale of moral duty and honour was miserably low : justice, truth, religion, were names common in men's mouths, but slightly regarded in their actual dealings. To open letters, to rob an am bassador's desk, to corrupt his servants, to forge his signature, were all allowable methods of furthering the business of the State. The reader is already well aware of the little value placed on human life, of the frequency of private assassination, and the encouragement given to it by the highest statesmen of the age. To argue on the honour and probity of such men \u2014 as we should be entitled to do had they lived in our own times, (lax as this age may be in some things) \u2014 must lead to error. Nay, Hume himself was aware of, and states one instance in which Walsingham acted with a total disregard of all high principle. This historian tells us, that the English secretary, when he had intercepted and opened Mary's letters to Babington, added to them a postscript in the same cipher, in which she desired him to inform her of the names of the con spirators ; hoping thus to elicit from Babington the whole secrets of the plot. Was it possible that any man of common probity could have so acted ? and what are we to think of his letter quoted in the text, in which, in obedience to the English Queen's com mands, he solicited Paulet to put Mary privately to death ? Could a man of the slightest probity have written that letter ? It appears, then, that Phelipps and Walsingham were persons capable of such a course as garbling and altering Mary's letters : it is evident that Phelipps had the power and the talent to do so; and we have seen, from the history of the Conspiracy given in the text, that both were anxious to convict her and bring her to punishment. But it may be said, All this is presump tion : where is the proof that they added anything to these letters ? In answer to this may be first quoted, the forged postscript endorsed in Phelipps' handwriting, * Postscript of the Scottish Queen's letter to Babington\"1 inquiring the names of the six gentlemen. Hume, following Camden,2 asserts that Wal singham added a postscript of this import to one of Mary's letters to Babington. It is singular, however, that it should not have struck this historian, that no such postscript appeared in any of Mary's alleged letters produced at the trial ; and had this charge, 1 Supra, p. 326. 2 Hume, p. 453.

But the case is altered by the discovery, (mentioned in the text, p. 326,) of this postscript in cipher, endorsed by Phelipps, and presen-ed in the State-paper Office. Now, such a postscript was either what it purports to be \u2014 an original of Mary's, or a true copy of such an original, or a forgery. If it were an original of Mary's, or a true copy of such, why, it may be asked, was it not produced against her at the trial ? It connected her with the six conspira tors, who were Babington's associates ; and in this light would have been decided evidence against her. But no use was made of it at the trial ; and it may be conjectured, from this suppression, that, after having exercised his skill in fabricating it, Phelipps changed his scheme for the conviction of the Scottish Queen, and intro duced the sentences connecting her with the six gentlemen who were to assassinate the English Queen into the body of the letters, rather than in a postscript at the end. In the next place, although there is no direct evidence by which we can detect Phelipps or Walsingham in the act of garbling and altering Mary's letters, yet strong presumptive evidence is fur nished by the circumstances of the trial itself; and this even after making allowance for the partiality and disregard of justice which appears in all the judicial proceedings of those times. It is evident that Mary could only be proved guilty by the production of her own letters ; by the production of the minutes, or rough drafts of these in her own hand ; by the evidence of her secretaries, Nau and Curie, who wrote the letters ; or by the evi dence of Phelipps, Avho deciphered them. The limits to which I must confine these remarks will not permit me to go into detail ; but it may be observed, that on each of these modes of proof, the evidence against the Scottish Queen, either totally fails, or is defective. 1 . No original of Babington's long letter to her, or of her answer to Babington, was produced. Mary anxiously demanded the pro duction of both, and positively asserted that she had never written the letter of which they produced a copy ; but she demanded it in vain, and she was con\\-icted on the evidence of this avowed copy. 2. It was stated by Nau, her secretary, that the greater part of her letter to Babington was copied by him from a minute in Mary's own hand, written in French, which, he stated, would be"], [468, "444 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. found amongst her papers,1 and which, if we are to believe Nau's declaration, Elizabeth aud her ministers had really in their hands, and could have produced if they pleased.2 Now, these French minutes written in Mary's hand, if they had contained the guilty passages connecting her with the plot against Elizabeth's life, would undoubtedly have proved the case against her. Why then were they not produced ? It seems plain, that if found at all, of which there is reason to doubt,3 they did not contain any mention of the plot against Elizabeth's life. Here, again, the proof against the Scottish Queen totally fails. 3. As to Nau and Curie, the manner of dealing with these two secretaries of Mary betrays, in a striking way, the weakness of the proof against her. She anxiously requested to be allowed to examine them ; and engaged, if this were permitted, to prove by their testimony, that she was innocent. This was denied : she Avas shown some depositions to which they had attached their signatures ; and other declarations were produced wholly written by them, the contents of which, it was argued, proved her guilty of sending the long letter to Babington. Mary's reply to these de positions has been already stated in the text ; but it is here material to attend to an observation of Dr Lingard, who contends, and apparently with perfect justice \u2014 that, judging from the only papers which now remain, it does not appear that Nau or Curie were ever 1 MS. letter, State-paper Office, 7th September, 1586.

Do they verify, on oath, that this is a true copy of the letter written by them from Mary's dictation, and sent to Babing ton ? Far from it. Nau simply says, he truly thinks, to the best of his recollection, this is the letter; and Curie, that it was either this letter, or one like it, that he put in cipher.2 And it was on such an attestation as this that Burghley contended that the Scot tish Queen was guilty? 4. There was yet one other way in which the defects of the proof against Mary might have been supplied. If Walsingham and Burghley could not produce the original of her letter to Ba bington \u2014 if they had no minutes of this letter in her own hand writing \u2014 they still had Phelipps, who had deciphered it, aud who could have attested on oath the accuracy of his own decipher, and its agreement with the copy produced at the trial. Why was this man not produced ? Can the motive be doubted ? There are three original papers preserved in the State-paper Office, which appear to me to establish Mary's innocence, on as convincing grounds as the question admits of. It has been already noticed, that when Nau affirmed that the greater part of Mary's letter to Babington was taken by him from an original iu the Queen's hand, and that this minute of her answer would be found in her repositories, a strict search was made, which was wholly unsuccessful ; and on the 4th September, Walsingham became con vinced that \" the minute was not extant.\" This failure of obtain- 1 Lingard, Hist, of England, vol. viii. pp. 220, 221 ; and Appendix, pp. 436, 437.

In these difficulties, it seems to have struck Phelipps, that Curie and Nau might be intimidated into confessing something against Mary, by sTiowing them that they had already, by their written declarations, confessed enough against themselves to in- A'olve a charge of treason, as abettors of the plot for the invasion of England, and the escape of the Scottish Queen.

The plot related entirely, as is shown by these proofs, to the Spanish invasion of England, and the plans drawn up by Mary for her escape \u2014 to which she pleaded guilty. This defect appears to have struck Burghley, and Phelipps en deavoured to supply it by drawing up for this statesman a second Summary-, endorsed by Burghley : \" From Phelipps\" and dated on the same day as the former, 4th Sept., 1586. This paper appears to me, from its admissions and omissions, to be almost conclusive in establishing the innocence of Mary. It is entitled, ': Arguments of Nau and Curie's privity to the whole conspiracy, as well of invasion, as rebellion and murder of the Queen's per son ; \" and is as follows : \u2014 \" Their privity to that was written by their mistress touching the two former points both to Mendoza, the L. Paget, Charles Paget, Sir Francis Englefield, and the B. of Glasgow, in the letters of the 27th July, thus marked \u2014 F, O, K, D, E, L ; which minutes are of their own hands, as themselves confess, the like trust not unlike to be given for tcriting those to Babington. \" The first letter written by that Queen unto Babington, as it seemeth, since his intelligence was renewed, being of the 26th June, is of Curie's hand, (litera B;) and the secret intelligencer Bar naby,' is directed by Curie's letter where to find Babington, litera B. \" The second letter, likewise coming from Nau to Babington, touching their assurance of Poley, is of Curie's hand, (litera P ;) and it argueth a letter sent in cipher from Babington, which Curie, or the inditer thereof, was to decipher, which was Nau. In the same letter, Curie taketh order that x shall stand for Babington's name. \" Litera A showeth that there was another letter in cipher sent to Babington by the secret messenger, 27th July, which Babington shall confess to be the bloody letter. The letters to Babington and from Babington, two of them were very long, and all in cipher, fair written, (as Babington will confess ;) and therefore it cannot choose but that the Queen's letter was put in cipher by Nau or Curie, and Babington's letter likewise deciphered. 1 Barnaby is a name for Gilbert Gifford. \"Curie's Letter,\" 19th June; State-paper Office, in which he says, \"^\"stands also for Barnaby, or Gilbert Gifford.\" VOL. VIII. 2 G"], [474, "450 HISTORY OF SCOTLAND. \" The new alphabet sent to be used in time to come between that Queen and Babington, accompanying the bloody despatch, is of Nau's hand. \"The heads of that bloody letter sent to Babington, touching the designment of the Queen's person, (by this he means the plot to assassinate Elizabeth,) is of Nau's hand likewise. \" They cannot any way say it should stand with reason that the Queen did decipher, and put in cipher, her letters herself. For it appeareth that she despatched ordinarily more pacquets every fortnight than it was possible for one body well exercised therein to put in cipher, and decipher those sent ; much less for her, being diseased, a Queen, &c. \"It appeareth all letters were addressed to one of them, Nau or Curie; for that in the deciphering there is, for the most part, a postscript found to them \u2014 excusing sometimes the error or length of the cipher, sometimes of their private occasions, &c.\" Such is this second \" Summary.\" Now it will be noted that Phelipps argues thus. The letters of Mary to Mendoza, Lord Paget, and others, marked F, 0, K, D, E, L, were written from minutes drawn up by Curie and Nau from Mary's dictation. It is, therefore, to be presumed, that a similar trust would be given them for writing the letters to Babington. Is there not here an express admission by Phelipps, that there was no proof that Mary had given any instructions whatever to her secretaries, which con nected her with the alleged letter to Babington, produced on her trial. \u2014 He presumes that she may have given instructions for Babington's letter, because she gave such instructions for the let ters to Mendoza, Paget, and the rest. But there is a still more important fact stated by Phelipps in this second \" Summary.\" The heads of the bloody letter to Bab ington had, it appears, been found, although the minutes of this same letter which Nau affirmed to have been given him by the Queen in her own handwriting, had not been found. And these heads, let it be observed, were in the handwriting of Nau himself, not of Mary. It is, therefore, evident, that the utmost exertions, and the strictest search on the part of Mary's enemies, directed by all the skill and vigour of Walsingham, and carried into effect by the unscrupulous artifices and ingenuity of Phelipps, had not been able to find the smallest scrap of evidence under Mary's hand, which could connect her with the plot against Queen Elizabeth's life."], [475, "PROOFS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. 451 Last of all, we have in this \" Summary,\" the admission that all the letters, (which includes Babington's among the rest,) were ad dressed not to Mary, but either to Nau or Curie \u2014 that Mary relied on Nau and Curie to decipher therii \u2014 and that the Queen's alleged letter to Babington was put in cipher either by Nau or Curie. If, then, (to sum up these proofs,) Babington's alleged letter was not addressed to Mary \u2014 if she had nothing to do with deciphering it \u2014 if the alleged answer in cipher was not made by her \u2014 if there were no minutes in her hand for that answer \u2014 if Nau and Curie's declarations do not connect her with the plot against the Queen's life \u2014 and if Phelipps, whose evidence, under such a lack of proof, could alone have supplied the deficiency, was not brought forward \u2014 it appears difficult to resist the conclusion that Mary was im plicated solely in a plot for her escape, that she was entirely igno rant of the project for Elizabeth's assassination, and that she was the victim of forged letters manufactured by her enemies.1 It would be easy to corroborate this conclusion by some additional arguments, drawn from the successive declarations of Nau, and other letters or papers preserved in the British Museum and State paper Office ; but enough has been said upon the point, and any reader who wishes to pursue the inquiry, will find ample materials in these two noble repositories of original information. He will there find the lists, notes, and arguments which Lord Burghley drew up previous to the trial of the Scottish Queen ; upon which I cannot enter, \u2014 but the whole have been examined and carefully weighed, and the result is a confirmation of the opinion of Mary's innocence. 1 In the British Museum, Caligula,C. ix.fol. 458, there is a confession of Thomas Harrison, who styles himself Secretary to Sir Francis Walsingham, in which he states that Walsingham, Phelipps, and himself, contrived the conspiracy, and forged the letters, for which Mary suffered death. I have not given this confession, because I know one part of it to be false, and dare not trust the rest. END OP VOLUME EIOnTIJ.
