If this be the case, these new lights have penetrated but a short way into the general darkness, else why are the fallacious assump tions and old errors still enounced by professors in lecture-rooms, and taught in Manuals and School Primers ? The chief aim of this volume is not to discuss doubtful questions but to settle them, if possible, for ever; in fact, to separate what is true from what is false. Surely it is a work worthy of such learned societies as the Geological of London and the British Association to aid in removing this reproach from an uncertain science, and to ascertain by observations and experiments in various parts of the world the extent and limits of Atmospheric and River Erosion, the real nature, tendency, and effects, whether permanent or not, of Earthquake shocks, the present Rise of Land in any part of the world,"], [16, "VI PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. the actual formation of Chalk in deep sea bottoms, etc. The time has surely come for competent scientific observers, with minds free from prejudice or hypo thesis, to test and try these natural phenomena in the Bay of Naples or in the Baltic, in S.

To have recovered so many lost records of the past existence of our globe, and of its inhabitants, was a precious addition to the book of knowledge. But while appreciating the verities of geology, few who have studied the subject attentively can have failed to feel some qualms at accepting all its theories. There is no denying that the systems proposed by the Cosmogenists of the present day, while very dogmatically enforced by their propagan dists, contain many things hard to believe, and which appear to have been accepted too readily and without full investigation. An observer, long oc cupied in the study of nature, may be allowed to dwell upon the difficulties which environ the doctrine of Uniformity or the operation of Modern Causes, the elevating power of Earthquakes, Erosion of rocks by rivers, unlimited Denudation by atmospheric influ ences, and the Antiquity of Man on the earth. If it can be shown that there is ground for this hesitation to believe, and need for fresh in vestigation of dubious facts, if it should turn out that enormous exaggerations have paved the way for erroneous conclusions, and that supposed analogy"], [27, "3 CHAP.

The younger disciples of this school of geology will in that case not refuse to retrace their steps and start afresh. A living philosopher has proclaimed that to doubt is the first principle of modern science. Science, moreover, claims for herself an unlimited right of search into all matters of belief, and will not refuse to concede the same liberty which she enjoys. I propose, therefore, to relieve myself of an accumulation of scientific doubts which have obstructed my acceptance of cer- tain tenets of the modern school of geology, examin- ing various statements assumed to be facts, and testing their competency to fulfil the results attri- buted to them, from careful study of the writings of that school, partly from personal observations of the earth's structure in this and in other countries during many years past. The candid reader who may not be convinced by my arguments may perhaps be so far shaken in his implicit trust in these the ories as to desire a verification of the bases of some parts of modern geology, by a careful re-investigation of the phenomena on the spot. And here, at the outset, it is necessary to protest against the insatiable demands of geologists for time, or rather against the substitution of time for proof"], [28, "4 CHAr. I.

They see in their visions re sults which do not follow their premises, but which they assure us will happen, or ought to happen, pro vided we put off the fulfilment for \" an incalculable period of time.\" They seem unconscious of the fallacy of supposing that an event which to all appearance is not happening, and which certainly has not happened within the period of the world's known history, can ever come to pass, conditions and circumstances remaining the same, and no new motors coming into the field. There cannot be a more groundless assumption than that \" time is power.\" *\u25a0 A late geological president has corrected the mistake in these terse words : \" It is a question of dynamics and not of time, and we cannot accept the introduction of time in explanation of problems the real difficulties of which are thereby more often passed over than solved.\" \u2014 Professor Prestwich's Inaugural Lecture; Oxford, 1875.

In truth, the geologist draws bills at very long dates, which are never paid because they never arrive at maturity. Would it not become the geologists of our time to abandon a position which enforces on their followers a belief almost amounting to a superstition ? Does it not look like a resource for escaping from the fulfilment of their own prophecies ? Another preliminary objection must be recorded against a prevalent practice endorsed by some eminent names, but very dangerous to real science, of arguing from supposition and alleged similarity to conclusions wholly unproved. Thus, because a puddle in a rainstorm will cut runlets in the soft sand in an hour or two, it must follow that rain or running water will cut glens and valleys, or even sever high mountains, granted millions of years.2 Or that because the earthquake of 1822 in Chili raised the sea-beach 3 or 4 or 10 feet, whether perman ently or not has not been proved, a part of the South American continent, surpassing in weight and volume the whole chain of the Andes, was lifted at the same 1 Geikie, Scenery of Scotland, p. 115. 2 Ibid. p. 13."], [30, "SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY.

As a reason for the following discussion, indeed as a justification of it, we ought to bear in mind that the dogmas to which objection is taken are not confined to scientific papers or learned Transactions, but are promulgated in popular treatises and taught in school-books, now being widely circulated among the young. Is it not, therefore, incumbent upon us to ascertain whether these assertions be true ? The principles of this school of science have been thus formally enunciated by their eminent leader : \" The forces now operating %ipcm earth are the same in kind and in degree as those which, in the remotest times, produced geological changes!' \u2014 Lyell. If this be really the fact, if nature were still carrying on the operations by which the globe was made and fashioned, only on a diminished scale, are we not, in the first place, entitled to expect to catch her in the act of producing some of those elementary substances which enter into the composition of the earth's crust ; not of depositing but creating the 1 Lyell's Principles, i. p. 133."], [31, "CHAP. I. NO NEW ELEMENTARY SUBSTANCES. 7 metals and simple minerals, gold, silver, tin, quick silver, iron, the diamond, emerald, etc.? In no in stance has any such discovery been made. The geologist is lavish in explaining how sandstone is to be produced out of beds of sand, the washings of great rivers deposited in the sea. Yet we are not aware of any example of these sandbanks being raised from the bottom of the sea, and converted into solid sandstone or crystalline quartz. The sand and mud washed down into the Mediterranean by the Rhone in the days of Hannibal remain to this clay incoherent mud and sand. We cannot even satisfy ourselves with the sight of a fragment of new-made granite or a morsel of modern mica-schist. The obvious conclusion to be drawn from the absence of these substances is that the conditions under which they were created no longer exist. What goes on at present is but a fresh deposit, or concretion, or sublimation, or crystallisation of substances already existing in vapours or solution, as of silex from the Geysers of Iceland and hot springs of New Zealand, of calcareous stones from water impreg nated with carbonic acid, of sulphur from the vol canic vapours of Etna or Hecla, etc. A distinguished philosopher proclaims, as one of the facts gained to science from the cruise of the"], [32, "8 SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY. ciiAr. i. \" Challenger,\" the discovery that true chalk, in the condition of mud, is now being made at the bottom of the Atlantic, and even that it has never ceased to be made since the deposit of the chalk formation of our continents. Two reasons, however, have been brought forward by Mr. Gwynn Jeffreys, which would seem to make it impossible for us to imbibe implicitly this assertion. Atlantic mud cannot be liquid chalk, because it contains no more than fifty per cent of carbonate of lime, chalk being a nearly pure carbonite \u2014 and the living mollusca found in this mud are in every case totally different from the species contained in the old genuine chalk. Hutton ** satisfied himself, and many others, his followers, by the assertion that \" the materials of the harder rocks transported into the sea are spread out and form strata analogous to those of more ancient date. Though loosely deposited along the bottom of the ocean, they become afterwards altered and con solidated by volcanic heat, and are then heaved up fractured and contorted\" \u2014 Play/air's Works, iv. p. 75. Sir James Hall, to corroborate this, instituted instructive chemical experiments, such as heating lime in a closed gun barrel, to produce the crystalline texture assumed by melted matter cooled under high 1 Lyell's Principles, i. p. 73."], [33, "CHAP. I. METAMORPHISM A THING OF THE PAST. 9 pressure. But no sea, no water, could have existed on the surface of a globe of molten rocks. The water in contact with sand or rock heated red hot would have turned into vapour. What then be comes of high pressure exercised by the old ocean ? Metamorphism.1 Of comparatively recent origin is the theory of Metamorphism, or the alteration and conversion of one kind of rock into another, on a large scale and over great areas. By it sandstone has been (or may have been) converted into quartz rock (or even into granite), shales into mica-schists, and fossiliferous limestones into crystalline marble. That such effects have been produced in a former condition of the earth we have full evidence. The question is how it was effected. About this geologists are much perplexed and greatly at variance ; some attributing it to great heat under pressure, others to chemical action. To some, hot water charged with chemical carbonates seems to have been the agent, to others cold water percolating the rocks. Another expounder3 writes : \" heat aided by water is necessary to allow 1 Lyell's Elements, p. 730, 6th ed. ; Geikie's Geology (Chambers), pp. 72, 73. \" Ramsay, Physical Geology of Great Britain, p. 47."], [34, "10 SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY.

From all that has been stated, however, we arrive at one unmistakeable conclusion, viz. \u2014 that metamorphism is a thing of the past, its processes not now discoverable, and it must therefore be dismissed from the category of \" Causes now in action.\""], [35, "CHAP. II. EARTHQUAKES. 11 CHAPTER II. EARTHQUAKES THEIR EFFECT IN MODIFYING EARTH'S SURFACE EARTHQUAKE- WAVES. \" Thou sure and firm-set earth. \"\u2014Macbeth. The theory which attributes to earthquakes a large share in the conformation of the actual surface of the globe we inhabit is as old as Herodotus, who referred the opening of the gorge, through which the Peneus escapes to the sea, and Thessaly ceased to be a lake, to an earthquake caused by Neptune. This view was shared by Strabo. It was adopted by Hooke and Hutton; and their follower, Sir Charles Lyell, proclaimed the continued action of earthquakes as the undisputed agent of his cosmogony, operating now, as in former ages of the world's ex- istence, only with diminished force. Not less than 100 pages of that fascinating work The Principles are devoted to a history of the best recorded con- vulsions, and to the description of the office they fill. He sums up with the conclusion that the actual configuration of the earth's surface is due to a long-"], [36, "12 SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY. CHAP. H. continued series of moderate shocks. The poets of old, he tells us, were wrong to select the rock as the emblem of firmness,1 and it has fallen to the geolo gist of modern times to correct their error. There can be no doubt that the earthquake, when it comes in contact with buildings, or other work of man, is truly terrible, indeed irresistible. \" Temple and tower fall to the ground,\" whole cities are pro strated like packs of cards, and myriads of human beings are annihilated in the ruin. No wonder then that the description by eye-witnesses of these catas trophes should be tinged with the exaggerations of terror. It is surprising, however, that men of science should have transferred such exaggerations to their writings, and should have applied to the works of Nature what is strictly true only in reference to those of man, more especially since the few scientific eye-witnesses who have written from the spot, and near the time of such convulsions, give information which enables us to correct these fables and reduce them to sober reality. If it should turn out that this part of the fabric of modern geology has been hastily laid on foundations not perfectly secure, it is to be hoped that all lovers of science will encourage an investigation which has truth for its object. i Lyell's Principles, ii. p. 179."], [37, "EARTHQUAKES. 13 CHAP. II. Earthquake phenomena, little understood when the Principles of Geology first appeared, have been since subjected to minute mathematical and practical investigation by Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Robert Mallet. The last-named gentleman has studied them not only theoretically but on the scene of operations, having visited South Italy after the earthquake of 1857. His authority is acknowledged by Lyell, who quotes his writings, though he does not avail himself of all the results we are bound to bring forward. First of all let us invite attention to Mr. Mallet's definition of an earthquake as \" a movement like the shaking of a sieve,\" x as \" simply the transit of a wave or waves of elastic compression, from vertically upwards to horizontally, through the crust and surface of the earth.\" An eye-witness compares its motion with that of a carpet lifted on one side and shaken along the ground.

CHAP. II. first concussions the earth continues for hours, even for days, in a constant tremor or vibration. Mallet adds, p. 329,\" Earthquakes must not be confounded with the forces producing permanent elevation of the land.\" These fundamental determinations of learned observers ought carefully to be borne in mind in the following investigation ; they are somewhat at vari ance with the assumption of the Huttonian school of geology regarding both the nature and the permanent changes effected by these convulsions. Let us examine, then, the various instances recorded in the pages of the Principles, so as to ascertain what enduring consequences earthquakes are really capable of producing, and what evidences they leave behind, on the face of Nature, of the permanent elevation and fracturing of rocks, and especially of great mountain chains. The earthquake of Calabria in 1783 was one of the most tremendous on record, and its effects were carefully investigated on the spot immediately after, by the Neapolitan Academy, by Sir William Hamil ton, Mons. Dolomieu, and others, who published elaborate reports ; and Sir Charles Lyell has given a very full account of it from these sources. First and foremost occurred the opening of fissures in the ground, as the earth-wave rolled along, and the swallowing up of men and cattle and buildings by"], [39, "RESULTS OF EARTHQUAKE. 15 CHAP. II. the immediate closing of these gashes. Some re mained open, however. Next we are struck by the constant occurrence of landslips,1 caused by enor mous masses of earth being shaken down from the hillsides by the sieve-like motion, so that, in the language of the terror-stricken inhabitants, one hill marched down to meet another. The result was \u2014 innumerable stoppages of the river -courses, the obstruction of the drainage of the district, and the formation2 of 215 stagnant ponds and lakes. But the reader of Lyell who has admired the curious woodcuts of straight and starred fissures, holes, ravines, and chasms, must not for a moment suppose that these were formed in solid rock, that they lasted any time, or that any one visiting the spot would be likely to find any trace of them at the present day. All the fissures gradually closed up, for they were confined to superficial deposits, alluvium, clay, gravel, and an incoherent tertiary sandstone, according to Dolomieu (Brit. Assoc. Rep., 1 The filling up of a deep cove near Dusky Bay, New Zealand \u2014 surrounded by steep cliffs \u2014 after the earthquakes of 1826-27, was evidently the result of landslips. \"Trees were seen under water near the coast, having probably been carried down by landslips.\" \u2014 Lyell's Principles, ii. p. 82. 2 Lyell's Principles, ii. pp. 129, 130, 133."], [40, "SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY. CHAP. II. 16 p. 39). This is also acknowledged by Lyell, who adds that \" in more solid rocks we may expect that fissures will remain open for ages.\" Yet he is able to adduce no example of such permanent fissures in Cal abria, nor of any enduring change of level. Mr. Mallet visited this part of South Italy immediately after another very severe earthquake, which spread de struction through the southern part of the Peninsula, December 1857 ; but after the most patient investi gation, after traversing 150 miles of sea-coast and river-courses, he \" could find no trace of permanent elevation ; \" ** or, as the author of the Principles ex- presses it, \" the changes wrought in the river-courses were not on so grand a scale as in 1783.\" \u2014 Lyell's Principles, ii. p. 138. The well-known Temple of Serapis, on the Bay of Naples at Pozzuoli, a carefully observed geological example, is stated to have been twice raised and twice lowered by earthquake influence since the Christian era. Granting this, it at least affords no proof of permanent elevation, for we learn that in 1852 the floor of the temple was nearly on a level with the sea, and all downward movement had ceased, so that the temple stands now nearly where it did at first. The zone of holes midway in the three 1 Report to Royal Society, Transactions, vol. x."], [41, "17 CHAP. II. TEMPLE OF SERAPIS. standing columns, at a height of 12 feet above the pedestals, formed by marine-boring animals, which can live only under the sea, renders this building a puzzle to geologists and arch\u00e6ologists alike.1 We owe to the erudition, however, of the late Sir Edmund Head the discovery of a passage in Pausanias, from which it seems quite possible that the site of the temple was originally gained from the sea by artificial means, by throwing down earth and rubbish on which to found the temple, around a hot spring which rose in the midst of the sea itself. No doubt this is the spring, now flowing behind the temple, and once used to fill its baths. The pavement which was discovered five feet below the level of the base of the columns may have been the floor of a sunken bath, and conse quently no indication of any subsidence in the ground on which the stones of the pavement are laid. In the same manner the Fort of Sindree, in the delta of the Indus (L. ii. p. 104), submerged by the earthquake of Cutch, 1819, and seen by Alex. Burnes, 1828, surrounded by water, ten years later had risen up again on dry land, the lagoon having diminished; while still more recent intelligence, in 1845, assures us that \" a large area seems to have sub sided, and the Sindree Lake had become a salt marsh.\" 1 See Arch\u0153ologia, vol. xxxvii C"], [42, "18 SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY. CHAP. II. From all these circumstances, recited by Lyell himself, and from others which it would be tedious to quote, the permanent effects of earthquakes are discredited, and it would appear that although parts of the earth's surface may be raised by the jar of an earthquake, like the lifting of the lid of a box, the truth, as it emerges, proves that this rise is not lasting, and the ground subsides again gradually into place, when the shocks are over. Were it not so, there are some spots on the earth's surface, such as Conception and Copiapo in Chili, which ought to have been hoisted into the air or permanently sunk long ago, since scarce a year passes without at least one shock, whereas they remain, like the Temple of Serapis, just where history and geology first found them. No more extensive or remarkable range of volcanoes exists on the globe than that great circle which belts the Malay Archipelago. In this whole region earthquakes are constant, slight shocks occur ring monthly, or even weekly, intermixed with stu pendous convulsions at intervals, yet we do not find that Java, Sumatra, or the adjoining Philippines, are either gradually rising at all or sinking below the ocean. In many instances severe earthquakes pass with out causing the slightest change of level. After that"], [43, "CHAP. II.

The most destructive earthquake which ever visited the coast of Chili was that of November 1822, when shocks were felt throughout a space of 1200 miles from north to south. Next morning the coast was found to have been raised at Valparaiso 3 feet, and about 4 feet at Quintero, a seaport close to Valparaiso, where \"some rocks, a few hundred feet from the shore, previously always under water, were uncovered at half-tide ; \" also, \" a mill-stream, about 1 mile from the sea, gained a fall of 14 inches in little more than 100 yards, and from this fact it was inferred that the rise in some parts of the inland country was far more considerable than on the borders of the ocean.\"\u2014 Lyell's Principles, ii. 95. Dr. Meyer, a Prussian, who visited the coast nine years after, and saw beds of shell-fish and sea-weed adher- ing to rocks which before the earthquake were under the sea, was \" led to think the whole coast of central Chili was raised about 4 feet.\" This supposition of the rise of the coast is repeated in written state ments of Mrs. Graham, Mr. Cruikshank, and Mr."], [44, "20 SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY.

Still he builds upon it in different parts of his book, so far as to assert that \"in Chili, in 1822, the volcanic force has overcome the resistance, and has permanently uplifted a country of such vast extent that the weight and volume of the Andes must be insignificant in comparison,\" adding, a few lines further on, \" We can scarcely doubt that a mass of rock several miles thick was uplifted in Chili, 1822.\" x We have shown upon how very slight evidence, 1 Lyell's Principles, vol. i. p. 133."], [45, "CHAP. II. EARTHQUAKE IN CHILI. 21 in Sir Charles Lyell's own estimation, this assertion is made. Let us seek for any other example at any time or in any other country, from the author's earthquake chapters, to confirm it. The statement that \" Chili has thrice been per manently elevated \" is modified by Captain Fitzroy, who was there during another earthquake in 1835, and who warns us that \" the difference of 4 or 5 feet vertical, perceptible at first in the relative level of the land and water, gradually diminished, until the water rose again to within 2 feet of the former high-water level.\" He concluded also that in the neighbouring island of Santa Maria the land had been raised 4 or 5 feet in February, and had re turned in April to within 2 or 3 feet of its former level.\"1 \u2014 Lyell, ii. 92. Mr. Darwin, indeed, who was in Chili at the same time as Captain Fitzroy, appears to have been so blinded by his bias towards \" the permanent eleva tion theory,\" as not to be able to trust the evidence of his own eyes. \" There can be no doubt,\" he tells us, \" that the land round the Bay of Conception was 1 Sir Charles himself, in another place (vol. ii. p. 156), alludes to \" an opinion often promulgated of late years, that there is a tendency in the Chilian coast, after upheaval, to sink gradually and return towards its former position.\""], [46, "22 SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY. cnAP. ii. upraised 2 or 3 feet; but it deserves notice that, owing to the waves having obliterated the old lines of tidal action on the sloping sand, / could discover no evidence of this fact, except in the united testi mony of the inhabitants, that one little rocky shoal, now exposed, was formerly covered with water.\" \u2014 Journal, p. 310. Of the earthquake in New Zealand of 1855, a description appears for the first time in the tenth edition of the Principles. The author lays the greatest stress on it, because \" the geologist has rarely enjoyed so good an opportunity as that afforded him by this convulsion.\" \u2014 Lyell, ii. 88. The ac counts of it, also, were furnished to him by \" three well qualified scientific observers, who were eye-witnes ses,\" and their statement of the elevation of a high cliff of hard slaty rock over a distance of ninety mdes inland from the sea, is a unique instance of the kind, and requires to be carefully examined and tested on the spot at the present time by competent observers. This earthquake occurred on January 23d, 1855, in Cook's Straits, in the vicinity of Wellington, and was supposed by Mr. Roberts, an engineer, \" to have permanently elevated, in the vicinity of Wellington, a tract of land comprising 4600 square miles, not much inferior to Yorkshire.\""], [47, "CHAP. II. NEW ZEALAND EARTHQUAKE. 23 But it is added, \" the points of minimum and maxi mum elevation were 23 miles apart, which therefore expresses the breadth of the upraised area.\" \u2014 P. 85. The length of the fault running inland from Muka Muka, which marks the termination and the highest point of the upheaval, viz., 9 feet, amounted, accord ing to Mr. Borlase, \" to the extraordinary distance of about 90 miles.\" \u2014 P. 86. Now if we multiply 90, the length, by 23, the breadth, we find the result to be an area not of 4600 but only 2070 square miles.

How can we account for such confusion and con tradictions in the statement of \" an engineer who observed minutely the changes in the level of the land,\" and who \" was able to measure accurately the amount of permanent upheaval in the older for mations \" ? Until we can obtain further information on the results of this earthquake, we are compelled to refuse belief in the \" fissures 6 to 9 feet broad \" in the older formations, especially as there exists, as far as we know, no well-authenticated instance on record of the raising of an entire mountain chain in any part of the globe,1 nor of permanent fissures in hard or crystalline rocks by any earthquake.

Moreover, after the repeated and persistent asser tion of permanent upheaval (Lyell, p. 82), the nar rative of the New Zealand earthquake winds up with the usual confession that \" a question arose whether the land about Port Nicholson,\" where the shocks were most violent, upheaved several feet in January, had not \" sunk again to some slight extent before September 1855\" \u2014 Lyell, vol. ii. p. 88. It is but just to add that Mr. Roberts \" felt per suaded that he could not have failed to notice even a slight change of level, had any occurred ; \" and the author adds, \" It is surprising how soon the signs of a recent change of level on a coast are effaced to all eyes but those of the scientific observer.\" To sum up the results of the New Zealand earth quake, it may be safely asserted that the idea of a change of level over a space nearly as large as York shire originated in a total mistake ; while the 90 miles fault, if it really extends that distance, will probably turn out on examination to be not a fracture of solid rock, but a mere shift or landslip at the junction of two discordant unconformable formations."], [50, "26 SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY. CHAr. II. If there be well-founded doubts of any perma nence in the elevations and depressions caused by earthquakes, a perusal of their annals will prove how limited are their operations on the solid frame of the globe. Although by no means confined to plains and low grounds, earthquakes are most common among them, as in Cutch, the Mississippi valley, Lisbon, Jamaica, and even when they occur amidst the mountains, are felt chiefly upon the clay, gravel, and other recent or alluvial deposits at their base. Indeed, as a general rule, the earthquake force seems to glance off and to be turned aside on reaching the solid rocks of older formations. Dolomieu assures us that the Calabrian earthquake of 1783 did little mischief on the granite and slate rocks around the plain. Humboldt was astonished to find the spires and pinnacles of lofty buildings in the mountain capital of Quito, 9500 feet above the sea, stand the shock with scarcely a rent in their walls, while in the plain even huts are shattered by it. Sir Charles Lyell expresses wonder that two isolated earth columns, called the Dwarf Towers, near Viesch, in the Valais, \" consisting of hardened mud and gravel, should have resisted the destructive power of earthquakes which have occurred again and again in the neighbourhood,\" but he explains the"], [51, "CHAP.

Not a building on the secondary limestone or basalt was injured,\" writes Mr. Sharpe in 1839, quoted by Lyell. \" In New Zealand, 1855, the motion on the plain was greater than that on the hills.\" \u2014 Thompson's New Zealand, vol. ii. p. 232. \"The vertical movement ceased abruptly along the base of the hills of Remu taka.\"\u2014Lyell, ii. 85.1 \" Those houses in Chili of which 1 It is true Humboldt asserts that during the earthquake at Caracas (1812) the gneiss and slate mountains of the Cordilleras were more shaken than the plains. There may be other exceptions to the rule, but the opposite instances are far more numerous, and Mallet's opinion that the shocks felt at Lahore in 1832 passed through the Hindoo Coosh chain appears to be a conjecture only. The earthquakes felt at the same time on the Oxus, and even at Bokhara, may have originated from different centres. \u2014 See Mallet, British Asso ciation Report, 1850, pp. 39-40. In the Earthquake of Cashar, 1869, Dr. Oldham declares not a single fissure occurred in the solid and permanent part of the plain. They were confined to the borders of the river, and caused landslips, often filling up its channel, and driving back the water.

But it is precisely among the mountains, amid the great elevations and the fissures of the earth, that the operations which have modified its surface in ancient times are most perceptible, and here it is that the modern earthquake, if it were capable of performing the part assigned to it by geologists, ought to be most telling and active in lifting and fracturing, yet here precisely it begins to be impotent. The Swiss earthquake of 1855 shattered some houses of Visp on the low alluvium of the Rhone, dis lodged and shook down a few loose rocks upon the path to Zermatt ; but the lofty Balfrin Peak which looks down on Visp was not moved. During the catastrophe which levelled part of the city of Antioch in 1872, a German traveller, Seif, journeying thither through the mountains, had no perception whatever of the shock. So also to persons at the bottom of mines, the earthquake, so terrible at the surface, often passes unheeded by ; witness that which spread terror at Falun in Sweden, November 1823. The late excellent geologist, David Forbes, had been at plain at the foot of the Andes.

He could tes tify to their effects being confined to the surface.1 But not only does the earthquake appear to avoid the mountains, it has also nothing to say to those great gorges which intersect them and furnish channels to allow rivers to pass ; such as the Via Mala traversed by the Rhine in the Grisons, the gorge of the Danube below Belgrade, that of the Avon at Bristol, that of Sottoguda in the Tyrol, and a thousand others. Sir C. Lyell leads us to expect, p. 163, \"Where rocks have been once fractured and freedom of action communicated to detached portions of them, these will naturally continue to yield in the same direction, if the process of upheaval be continued.\" But we look in vain in these gorges for any \"up heaval \" of their sides or enlargement of their open ings at the present day. Two examples remain among the interesting catalogue of earthquake results brought together by Sir C. Lyell, which must not be passed over, because beyond doubt their effects are permanent \u2014 -the sub sidence of 1000 acres of sandy beach at Port Royal, Jamaica, 1692, and of an area 8 0 miles by 3 0 at New Madrid, in the valley of the Mississippi, 1811-12. 1 Journal of Geological Society, August 1872."], [54, "30 SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY. CHAP. II. In the latter case the ground affected consisted of alluvial matter \u2014 mud, trees decayed and living, mixed with reeds and lacustrine herbage. Such a soil could scarcely be termed dry land ; the neigh bouring rivers inundating it, and constantly chang ing their beds even at ordinary seasons ; and after being incessantly cracked and fissured by shocks for three months together, it is no wonder that it was underwashed. It had been squeezed dry like a sponge by the successive shocks, and collapsed soon after. In that very neighbourhood Sir Charles Lyell1 found the river alone, unaided by earthquakes, wasting its banks and undermining houses. The Jamaica case was a settlement of an incoherent sandbank, over weighted with buildings, which simply slipped into the sea from the concussion. Due stress and consideration has hardly been given to the effects of the great waves which always follow an earthquake occurring near the sea-shore. The ocean would appear to be turned up from its lowest depths on these occasions, and its equilibrium to be destroyed for days or weeks during which its oscillations last. These waves (as at Lima and Callao 1750, Conception 1751, Lisbon and Tan- 1 Lyell, Second Visit to the United States, vol. ii. p. 228 ; Lyell's Principles, ii. p. 161."], [55, "CHAP. II.

In this way beds of shells of living species are thrown up far beyond the shore, at heights of 60 or 80 feet above the reach of the tides, along with sea-weeds and shell-fish. This will account for the deposit of cotton thread, plaited rush, and an ear of Indian corn, found by Darwin on a hill near Lima.1 The tremendous force and volume of water thus set in motion also greatly alters the sea-bed near the shore, creating bars and sandbanks, and thrusting forward huge detached rocks 2 to places where before there was deep water. Hence the stories of rocks appearing above the water, and shell-fish exhaling odours on the shore. May not such waves have been the cause of the gently sloping beach which 1 Lyell, Antiq. of Man, p. 49 ; Mallet, Report, p. 61.

We have now passed in review all the most pro- minent and important instances of earthquake action enumerated by Lyell, and have endeavoured to show, partly out of his own ever candid avowals and con- fessions, that they do not bear out the conclusions at which he arrived. We have also the support of the following decisive sentences from Mallet : \" An earthquake, however great, is incapable of pro- ducing any permanent elevation or depression of land whatever. . . . Hence it is inexact, or rather untrue, to class earthquakes as among the causes of permanent elevation or depression of land.\" \u2014 Mallet, Report on Earthquake Phenomena, p. 48. The reader, it is hoped, will not consider that we have devoted too much space to this discussion when he remembers the importance which Lyell attributes to earthquakes : \" The integrity of the habitable world is preserved, and the very existence and perpetuation of dry land is secured, in a great degree, by subter ranean movements.\" \u2014 Lyell's Principles, ii. p. 144."], [57, "RESORT TO \"CONVULSIONS.\" CHAP.

The difficulties of modern Geology are greatly increased owing to its undertaking to produce vast effects with means which, on investigation, appear utterly inadequate to perform them. However, these results are so stupendous that even its adherents show signs of incredulity asrn their own theory, and a want of confidence in it. While professing uniformity and quietude, and charging with ignor ance and obliquity of vision those who still have faith in former operations of a more decisive character and on a grander scale than at present, they are compelled themselves to resort to these to account, in the first instance, for the creation of mountains, valleys, and river-beds, although laying the chief stress on denu dation.

No outward signs of distzirbance are visible, and the connection of the hollow with subterranean movements would not have been suspected by the geologist, had not the evidence of great convulsions been clearly exposed in the escarpment of the valley of the Ouse.\" The Quietudinarian geologist will answer that these upheavals are due to tranquil and gentle dis turbances, to \"multiplied convulsions of moderate intensity\"!4 \u2014 a succession of uniform minor move ments, repeated at distant intervals and after long pauses.

Moreover, as a wise modern geologist appropriately lays it down, \" It is not possible for any number of minor forces, where the ultimate resistance exceeds each one taken separately, to accomplish in any time, however long, that which requires for its execution a force of infinitely greater power.\" \u2014 Prestwich, Past and Future of Geology, 1875. To overcome the resistance of a mountain mass, to lift the Alps or Andes, and at the same time to break them up into gorges and valleys, was as suredly due to no modified violence, no gentle taps renewed from time to time. In order fully to under stand the magnitude of the work to be done by these gentle jogs, let us transport ourselves for a time into the midst of some of the grandest scenes of nature's operations. Listen to the evidence of an unbiassed geological observer possessing a minute knowledge of the highest mountain chain, the Hima layas. \" The whole mass,\" says Mr. Blanford, in a Report attached to the Geological Survey of India (p. 68), \"has been broken and disturbed, the rocks on one side of the fracture having been lifted up many thou-"], [60, "SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY. 36 CHAP.

Since man began to record his experience of natural catastrophes no one has ever witnessed such gigantic movements of the crust of the earth as here stand in existence.\" Sir Roderick Murchison \u2014 \" non sordidus auctor natur\u00e6 verique,\" writes, \" See the deep chasm occu pied by the Lake of the Four Cantons (between Brunnen and Altorf), a profound transverse fissure with vertical cliffs on either side, and observe the broken and discordant ends of the strata on one side, showing abrupt clean vertical abscission from those of the other.

It originates in events, issues, and developments which have passed away, and depends on a different condi tion of our planet from the present. We all know that the highest mountains on our globe are, in com parison with its diameter, far less than the wrinkles on the skin of an orange. Any one who has taken a survey of mountain-ranges from a high coign of vantage must have been struck by the uniformity with which they rise around him, wave beyond wave, maintaining, with the exception of a few pro minent peaks, nearly the same uniform level.

MOUNTAINS NOT UPHEAVALS. 41 the shattered ridges of a great table-land of stratified deposits which once formed the even surface of the primeval earth's crust ? If we adopt this conception, the mountain masses of the globe, the basins of lakes, the channels of rivers, the deep bed of the ocean, its narrow straits and wide gulfs, are the residt of overthrow rather than upheaval, of fissures and cracks in earth's surface caused by the contraction and shrinkage of the rocks whde in the act of cooling down from the state of a molten mass, like a lava stream, solid above, yet resting on masses still pliable from heat, and moveable below. Out of the openings thus formed arose our present mountains and valleys. The lines of fracture may have followed a direction nearly but not entirely paraHel to one another, interrupted in places by cross faults and fissures extending at right angles. At the moment of disruption some of the divided masses would be liable to fad over upon their yielding and still plastic base, like clods turned by the plough. The broken edges of the upper strata thus inclined would become peaks and ridges. Some, like the waves in a moving lava stream, would topple over and be absorbed in the glowing abyss below, to be remelted into granite or trap. In the general break-up the yawning gaps would become vaUeys and gorges, while"], [66, "42 SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY. CHAP. IV. the widest gulfs and deepest cracks, some descending not less than five miles, would become the ocean beds for the waters of the great deep to repose in. But the tremendous force developed in the sudden bursting asunder of the loftiest mountain chains would be accompanied by a recoil of the larger masses, producing unlimited lateral pressure, suffi cient to drive up the flat sedimentary strata behind either in slopes against their sides, or pushing them onward, to squeeze and crumple them up together. Hence those gigantic bends and contortions which in many a mountain section have roused the geolo gist's wonder. Thus the rupture and recod of the Alps bursting out of their cerements may have pro duced those wave-like undulations and folds, rising in nearly paraUel ridges one behind the other, which characterise the chains of the Jura. We know from high authority that no strata are so rigid as to resist a sufficient force applied laterady.1 The same con tracting movement would also promote the injec tion from the molten sea below of trap or granite in beds between the half-closed folds of the strata, or in veins and dykes penetrating their cracks and vertical fissures. The work would be completed by the flooring-over of the vaUey bottoms, as the lower layer 1 Lyell's Principles, chap. vii."], [67, "ORIGIN OF CONTORTED STRATA. 43 CHAP.

Geologists assure us that lateral pressure has crumpled up the Pal\u00e6ozoic rocks extending from the Mendip Hdls, under the sea, to the Ardennes, a distance of 800 mdes. If we consider the space these strata would occupy if laid flat in their original position, we may form some notion of the amount of folding and crumpling, of fractures and fissures, of gaps and slips, arising from the combined influence of contraction and recod. As the pressure increased nearly every fold would become a fracture, and the uplifted strata would resemble a long line of bound volumes, part of which would be liable to slip out of the strong grasp of one who attempted to lift them ad together. That some of these isolated strata should drop through into the seething abyss, there to be melted into trap or porphyry, would be inevit able. What more natural also than that, in a range of mountains of such length, in the midst of such vast lateral dislocations and vertical displacements and shifts thus set in movement, large isolated masses, parts of beds once continuous, should have been left behind as outliers ?

The explanation furnished by this hypothesis would relieve us also from those preposterous and incredible curves of strata prolonged nito the air by geologists of our day only to be swept away by atmospheric denudation. From the evidence afforded to us by numberless sections of disturbed strata, it appears that the outer folds of bent rocks have snapped asunder under the strain of severe pressure long before assuming the shape of complete arches.

The tendency of earth's crust to split and divide is not confined to the main severances forming great vadeys, but extends to the joints, faults, and cleavage dnes which traverse every stratum more or less. To this propensity is owing the fitness of the globe for man's occupation. Through it the lowest strata and ad their mineral treasure have been brought to light on the surface; through it the water springs have been let loose, and broad avenues made for their dispersion and circulation over earth's surface. The leading outdne of the theory of a primeval spdt-up of the crust of the globe thus propounded does not originate with the present writer. Many geologists, chiefly of foreign schools, have approxi mated to it. The sagacious Prestwich almost clutches it, but is entangled with the notion of upheaval from below ; Sir William Thomson's views on the rigidity of earth's surface have nearly anticipated it and tend to confirm it ; but the merit of fudy developing it is due to Professor Suess 1 of Vienna, who has carried it out and exemplified it upon the principal mountain-ranges not only of Europe, but also of Asia and America. 1 Die Entstehung der Alpen, von Edward Suess.

In recent times marks have been made on rocks on the shores of the Baltic, and observations with levels taken both on the Swedish and Prussian coasts. The residts hitherto have not been satis- factory ; no two sets of observations, made even by those who assert a rise, agree as to the rate and amount of it; and some of them throw doubt on the existence of any rise whatever. Sir Charles Lyed having visited the Baltic, 1834, on purpose, concluded that he had ascertained by a comparison of measurements, made at different periods/ that the land had risen by an insensible motion, \u2014 Principles, vol. i. p. 314; but in vol. ii. p. 190, of the same work, he evinces doubts whether the land had risen 2-| feet, or 10 inches, or it might be less, in a cen tury, \" in certain places north of Stockholm.\" Much stress is laid by Von Buch, Lyell, and others, on the existence of beds of sea-shells of ex isting species, at various heights considerably above the Baltic, but no dght is thrown on the time or mode of their deposition, and we cannot suppose that Wales is at present emerging from the sea"], [72, "48 SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY.

So much uncertainty prevails on the subject of the shores of the Baltic, that it is worth while to compare the conflicting evidence brought together by Sir Charles Lyell, which prevailed in convincing him that a rise is now ready going on in Scandi navia over an area of 1000 miles N. and S., and of unknown distance E. and W., increasing as we approach North Cape.1 Assertion.

Thus, when the wind is high at Malmu, the water overflows one of the present streets, and some years ago some excavations showed an ancient street in the same place 8 feet lower, and it was then seen that there had been an artificial raising of the ground, doubt less in consequence of that subsidence.

Such a conflict of testimony cannot fad to have perplexed my readers, and no wonder, since it appears to have had the same effect upon Sir Charles Lyed himself, for he adds, \" We have not only to learn whether the motion proceeds always at the same rate, but also whether it has been uniformly in one direc tion. Some phenomena in the neighbourhood of Stockholm appear to me only expdcable on the sup position of the alternate rising and sinking of the ground since the country was inhabited by man.\" J It is pleasant to pass from such uncertainties to positive facts which lead us to hope that we have once more arrived on \" terra firma.\" Thus, \" at Soder telge, 16 mdes S.W. of Stockholm, the land seems to have been quite stationary during the last cen tury.\" \u2014 Lyed's Principles, ii. 1 8 2.

Thus we have been fortunate enough to pin down the Scandinavian Peninsula, so to speak, unmistakably in its centre on the Baltic, and at its N.W. and S. extremities, upon evidence furnished by the author of the Prin ciples himself. The above extracts wid show how serious are the misconceptions regarding any present rise or fall in the Baltic shores, and how greatly exaggerated are the positive statements in books regarding it. But are there any local peculiarities which will account for the delusion of geologists ? Although there are no regular tides in the Baltic, it is subject to constant variations in level. Even strong N.E. winds in the North Sea affect it by damming up the narrow outlets which adow its waters to escape.

Professor Schidten observed that a fall of the barometer is fodowed by a rise in the surface of the sea, lasting sometimes for three weeks together. Moreover, no sea is more subject to the influence of ice than the Baltic. The ground ice which forms at the bottom of its shadow bays and channels whenever the frost is severe and prolonged, speeddy converts them into sodd cakes of ice. These, when lifted by the freshets of spring, take up not only large quantities of gravel and sheds, but also great stones, blocks, and boulders, and float them away, depositing them in shoals and reefs. Nay, sometimes these floes are driven a considerable dis tance inland along with their burthen, and are packed up to a height of 20 or even 50 feet. Von Baer observed a granite block of more than 400 tons weight thus stranded high and dry. By these means in many cases the channels between the fringe of islets and the mainland are growing shadower, or are even deserted by the sea, and reefs appear above the water from the deposits left by floating ice, driven by the wind, and not at ad from any rise of the land. The elaborate re searches of Dr. Meyer of Kiel, on the west part of"], [78, "54 SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY. CHAP. V. the Baltic, show that under such circumstances no reliance can be placed on marks made on rocks two or three inches above the water in a sea- basin liable to so great variability. To sum up the evidence, it would appear beyond doubt that in a former state of the globe, in the quaternary period, the shores of the Baltic may have been deeper in the water than now, but no proof is shown of any such rise during the historic period, and certainly there is no ground for the positive assertion, that \" The land is experi encing and has experienced for centuries a slow upheaving movement.\"1 Indeed, if the author of the Elements had seen the fodowing testimony of M. Pettersen, it is fair to suppose he would have modified his statement. That accurate Norwegian surveyor and geologist asserts : \" As to whether the land is stdl rising there is no positive evidence. In any case it is certain that the elevation during the last 1000 years has been quite insignificant. When it is stated in so many quarters, as a geological fact, that the north part of Norway rises about -^ of a metre in a century, this rate is evidently much too great.\"2 This is virtuady a confirmation of the previous tes- 1 Lyell's Elements, p. 49. 2 \" Karl Pettersen on the Geology of Norway, 1867-75,' quoted in the Geological Mag., No. 1351."], [79, "CHAP.

It is true that ardent disciple of the school, Mr. Geikie,1 is so fudy convinced of a slow upward movement now going on in Scandinavia, as to assure us that, in consequence of the great rise of the land, \" the pine-woods which clothe the mountains are being slowly elevated to ungenial heights, and are there fore gradually dying out along their upper dmits.\" Now as the upper dmits of pine-trees even as far north as Norway is 3500 feet, and as not -^ of the whole surface of Sweden surmounts the level of 2000 feet above the sea, it is quite clear the eleva- 1 Chambers's Geology, p. 66."], [80, "56 SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY. f'HAP.

Currents of water in rapid motion partiady abrade their beds by forcing stones and gravel over them. Whdlpools also drid holes in sodd rock, by making loose stones revolve constantly in their vortex, thus hodowing out pits or cauldrons many feet deep. Sometimes, by constant wear, two such \" pot-holes \" are thrown into one. In both cases this is purely mechanical erosion, since the stones, and not the water, hodow out the rocks. But these forms of erosion occur2 only near fads and rapids, and are not 1 MaeGillivray, Natural History of Deeside. 2 Streams flowing beneath glaciers act in the same manner. The water gathering on their surface drops through the first crack in the ice, and cuts a shaft sometimes more than 100 feet deep right through to the rock below, descending with tremendous force and a roar like thunder. If at the bottom it meets with any loose stones this Molin or glacier-mill sets them revolving, and drills round pits in the rock just as in a river bed. A remarkable example of this may be seen at"], [84, "60 SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY. CHAP. VI. generady marked by the curved or conchoidal surfaces which they leave behind on the rocks. There is no instance to be found, in any part of the world, of water, even with these auxdiaries, cutting down a clean smooth vertical surface in hard rock. It is not pretended that sdghtly coherent rocks, such as tufa, travertine, shale, and lava, can resist heavy floods any more than clay, drift, gravel, or sand, which of course are liable to be dissolved into mud, and washed away by any torrent, or even by any contact of water. This wdl explain the action of the flood of the Anio in destroying some of the houses at Tivod (Lyed's Principles, i. 354), because they stood upon beds of porous and incoherent tufa. The passage cut in a columnar lava current by the river Sioule in Central France (Scrope, C.

For the same reason, no one (except Mr. Jukes) 1 denies the power of running water to cut through aduvial deposits in plains and deltas and other easdy disintegrated modern formations, where rivers are constantly meandering and changing their beds. Another of Lyed's examples, that of the Simeto, at the foot of Mount Etna, cutting its way through lava of modern origin, but described by him to be compact and heavy, is yet capable of explanation. 1 \" When, however, a great river reaches the broad plain, its current must necessarily slacken, and its erosive power departs.\" \u2014 Jukes' School Geology, 2d edition. True, where the river is most rapid it has greatest power to move stones , but in its course over alluvial plains the current wears and dis solves its banks.

Sir Charles Lyed is, as usual, accurate on the whole in his observations, the lava current which issued from Etna in 1603 has been removed to a depth of 200 feet, and the stratum over which the river none flows is unusuady compact. He has faden into error, however, in this respect that, though the layer of lava now forming the river bed is comparatively hard, the upper beds, as in all lava streams, are scoriaceous, being the mere froth of the fiery mud, and offer slight resistance to running water. Notwithstanding, however, even the more compact bed has dttle tenacity, and from the nature Of its aggregation is very brittle, and more easdy battered to pieces by fragments washed down by the stream than a similarly compact rock of sandstone or limestone, the Simeto makes little or no progress at present in the lowering of its bed.

Yet, notwithstanding this, dmestone countries abound in open vadeys, speciady distin guished for the cdffs that almost invariably flank them, and are traversed by rivers like any other formations. Here, then, where water exercises an acknowledged power of excavation, it does not fulfil the duties which geology assigns to it. The limestone cdffs of Yorkshire and Derbyshire, there fore, were certainly not cut by watery erosion, but are probably due to a dislocation like that which produced the great Craven Fault. Many of the great river-vadeys display ndles of lateral precipice, rising often to heights of 1000 and 2000 feet above the water, almost invariably as smooth and even as the wads of a house. No proof exists of any of the processes of watery action above enumerated being able to produce straight cdffs, i.e., wads of rock.

How easily and economicady might the many cuttings on our railways have been constructed by turning over a hid a rapid current of water. The Prussian engineers, at any rate, had no faith in such aid in 1833, when they had some trouble in removing, by means of gunpowder, the well-known reef stretching across the Bhine at Bingen, upon which so many laden barges had suffered wreck during hundreds of years, to the injury and oppro brium of Hanseatic commerce. Yet notwithstanding the fud stream of the Bhine during so many ages had been unable to wear away this comparatively slight barrier, we are taught by geologists to believe that the long avenue of lofty precipices, including the Lurley a little lower down, and consequently the whole of the gorge from Bingen to Neuwied, 60 miles long, have been cut through by this same river Bhine. The Iron Gate on the Danube, just below the even more stupendous gorge through which that river passes out of Hungary, presents a similar obstacle to navigation and to geologists, who have failed to explain to us how water erosion having (as they assert) cut through cliffs 2000 feet high, should have stopped short at this petty barrier reef.

A ready explanation is at hand in the faults, shifts, joints, etc., which prevail all through the earth's crust : but these the ruling school of geology repudiate, nay, try as far as possible to shut their eyes to the frequent occurrence of such dislocations. Let us now, however, test the erosion theory by an examination of the phenomena attending the two greatest cataracts in the world. In them, beyond doubt, we see the power of running water exercised to its fullest extent. The first, Niagara, is ap pealed to triumphantly as an undoubted proof of the effects of running water. \" We have here,\" Sir Charles Lyed assures us, \" a river which has been eating its way backwards through the rocks for a distance of 7 mdes.\" Fortunately he himseff fur nishes the explanation of this : \" The St. Lawrence flows over a- bed of hard limestone nearly 90 feet thick, beneath which lie soft shales of equal thick ness, continually undermined by the action of the spray, which rises from the pool into which so large a body of water is projected, and is driven violently by gusts of wind against the base of the preeipke. In consequence of this action, and that of the frost, the shale disintegrates and crumbles away, and portions of the incumbent .rock overhang 40 feet,"], [97, "CHAP. VI. NIAGARA FALLS. 67 and often, when unsupported, tumble down.\" ' Is it not singular that the author should not have per ceived that this explanation refutes his own theory ? The hard dmestone bed, 90 feet thick, of the St. Lawrence, is not eaten back by the current flowing over it. It suffers no detriment from the passing river, but breaks away by its own weight,2 because its natural support is removed, not by the running stream above but by the splash of the spray wafted up from below the Fads, which dissolves the soft shale. To use the words of Professor Tyndad, \" the most violent whirdng of the shattered liquid (!)\" and \"the most powerful eddies recoding against the shale.\" But for the accident of the occurrence of this shale the Fads would not have altered their position. So far from the limestone bed being eroded, it is by its resistance to the river alone that the shale has not ad been removed long ago, and the cataract demodshed. The retrocession of Niagara Falls, therefore, is not the result of river erosion ; it is not even caused by contact with running water, but by the fortuitous 1 Lyell's Principles, vol. i. p. 360. 2 The famous Table Rock at Niagara, a part of the 90 feet limestone, projected, it is stated, 70 feet beyond the face of the cliff before it broke by its own weight ; but for many years before that event occurred the river had ceased to flow over it."], [98, "68 SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY. CHAP. VI. concurrence of a soft stratum soluble in water, whether stid or in motion, at a considerable depth below the bed of the river. The great cataract of the Zambesi, in Central Africa, caded by its discoverer, Livingstone, the Vic toria Fads, redresses the balance of glory for the Old World in possessing a larger and grander waterfall than any in the New. But besides that, it furnishes an undoubted example, on the largest scale, of a river-bed made for the river and not by it. This commanding stream having attained a width of more than a mde, flowing from N. to S. along an undu lating plain bounded by distant hills, on a sudden drops down into a crack stretching directly across its course, forming a trough 350 feet deep, but not more than 8 0 feet wide, into which the whole body of water is discharged. The Fad is twice as high and twice as wide as Niagara, but differs from it in that, immedi ately opposite to the Fad, rise three successive natural wads of rock of the same height as that over which the river leaps, separated from one another by narrow rifts.

It is next forced round the second promontory, then reversing its course round a third, and before it is adowed to escape to the sea it is compeded to double round a fourth wider headland. If the irresistible erosive power attributed to running water ready existed in it, the intrusive wad thus thrusting itself in front of the cataract should have been swept away by it long ago, instead of which the hard basalt over which the river tumbles has not yet lost its sharp edge, and the floods of thousands of years have surged against the opposing precipice without the sdghtest apparent enlargement of the wonderful, deep, zigzag channel.

' Then how came it not to sweep away these rock-partitions, so narrow in places that two men can scarcely walk abreast along them? Stid more preposterous is it to suppose that such a river could reverse its current on a sudden, so as to cut sideways, first right to left, next left to right. The discovery of the Zambesi Falls would seem to have been reserved until the present time, in order to refute a leading tenet of modern geology, and to prove the utter impotence of water to cut through hard rock. The conclusion seems irresistible that the fissure was made for the river to pass through, possibly by some shrinkage of the basaltic rock, when coodng down from an incandescent state, per haps on the sudden contact of water or ice. 1 Mr. Geikie, after studying an excellent model of these Falls, gives the following explanation upon erosive prin ciples : \u2014 \" The river seems to have cut its way backward through this winding ravine, until, owing to some subter ranean movements effecting a change of level, or to some other cause which would probably be detected by a geologist on the spot, the body of water in place of entering at the top of the ravine has been emptied over its sides.\" \u2014 Geikie's Scenery of Scotland.

If, then, water made such gorges, how was it carried up to the top of these mountains ? how could it com mence operations on a curved slope ? how could water have rested on such incdnes ? We wid pro duce another river as an example deserving the best efforts of modern geology to explain the phenomena attending it on erosive principles. The Litany (ancient Leontes), a river of Falestine, rising on the east slope of Lebanon, descends the valley between it and Anti-Libanus for more than 3 0 miles.1 At that point it approaches within 10 miles of the head-waters of the Jordan. A watershed of not more than 50 feet elevation, rising directly in the dne of its previous course N.and S., alone separates the two vadeys. Precisely at this spot the Litany alters its course, turns abruptly at a right2 angle due W.,in order to enter the defile of Kuweh,in places no more than 1 0 or 1 5 feet wide, which cleaves the chain of Lebanon 1 Robinson, Researches.

The Litany, if left to itself, according to the laws of hydrostatics, must have fodowed the lower opening presented to it, and have flowed over the inconsider able watershed into the Jordan, and thence to the Dead Sea. It is equady clear and certain that it coidd not have turned round, risen up 600 feet, and cut its present bed through so lofty and rocky a chasm, when the low road was open to it, without changing the dne of its previous course. But it is not necessary to go so far as to Palestine. We have precisely simdar examples to that of the Leontes close at home, one of them in the course of the Avon. Why should the Avon on quitting Bristol have altered its course, and instead of running straight forward over the low ridge at Bedminster into the Bristol Channel, have turned north to encounter hids five times higher (400-500 feet), those of Leigh Downs, unless it had found the gorge of Cdfton opened ready for it ? That that gorge was produced by a great convulsion is undeniable from the remark able fault a dttle below the Suspension Bridge, by which the strata on one side have suffered a vertical displacement of 800 feet above those on the other. In both these instances we may fairly ask the"], [105, "RIVER-BEDS VERSUS WATERSHEDS. 73 CHAP.

Modern geology assures us that the original ele vations of earth's surface determined the flow of the waters, and that their currents carved out the river valleys.1 How does this agree with the physical geography of our own country? In the Isle of Wight a high ridge of chalk running from E. to W. forms the back-bone of the island and the natural watershed, but the three chief rivers, the Brading brook, the Medina, and Yare, rise to the S. of the ridge and run N. into the sea, through this op posing ridge, by depressions evidently not made by water running from the watershed, which, as it is, yields only smad rivulets. The same thing occurs in the drainage of S. E. England. The natural watershed of the oodte and chalk ranges is utterly disregarded by the Nene, Ouse, and Wedand, ad of which rise to the west of these hdls, and by means of 1 \" The direction of the river valleys has, in the first place, been determined by the original slope of the land, but the deep dells, the broad valleys and straths, have all been scooped out by running waters.\" \u2014 Geikie's Geology, p. 76."], [106, "74 SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY.

The Weald of Kent and Sussex may be described as a. succession of strata trending nearly from N.W. to S.E., surrounded on the W., N., and S. by a horse shoe shaped escarpment of chalk, with an opening towards the E., descending towards Bomney Marsh. Do the rivers rising from the central Forest Bidge run parallel to the ranges which seem to offer ready made troughs, and through the wide level gap be tween Folkestown and Beachy Head empty into the Channel ? Nothing of the kind \u2014 the chalk barrier to the N. and S. is fractured, and through these openings the Arun, Adour, and Ouse run into the sea, the Med way, Mole, and Wey to the Thames. It is then vain to ted us that river-vadeys have been scooped out by running water, and that their ddection has been determined by the original slope of the surface, when there are innumerable instances to the contrary. Again, let not the geological student run away with the idea that the mud carried down by rivers is any proof of their erosive power, nor refer to the rapid increase of deltas at river mouths as a measure of its extent. In this case rivers are but trans porters. Adowing for the moderate disintegration of rocks at the present day from weather action, far"], [107, "75 CHAP. VI.

No doubt the mdky streams rising in glaciers are tainted with the mud formed by the present grind ing of the ice, but even here the water is only the carrier and not the creator of the mud suspended in it.

But be it remembered nature works for a purpose, and what would be the good of deepen ing channels which adeady effect the object for which they were intended, that of affording free passage for the waters of the country that they intersect ? The great impediment to the formation of a con sistent theory of the fashioning of the existing sur face of the earth lies in the obstinacy of those who deny the influence of pristine cracks and shrinkage fissures in the creation of vadeys, culminating in the dogmatic assertion that \" there is no necessary connection between fractures and the formation of vadeys.\" It may be safely asserted that fissurage is the common lot of earth's crust. Every formation, from the oldest to the newest, is pervaded with cracks, the natural result of the primitive baking to which all have been subjected. Every cliff and precipice, every quarry, convincingly proves this, and especiady every mine groaning under the number of its faults, shifts, etc. ; yet the utmost concession to be wrung from the erosionists is that \" the direction of vadeys"], [109, "77 CHAP.

In such a hollow des Loch Tay, an expansion in the course of the river Tay, descending to a depth of 600 feet, its bottom being nearly 250 feet below the level of the sea. In a basin far deeper lies the Lake of Como ; how could any ice-grinding account for its depth of 1924 feet, 1200 of which descend below the sea level ? How is it possible for running water or ice on any principle of hydrostatics to have created such basins ? The Sogne Fiord of Norway attains in its upper recesses a depth of 4000 feet, while near its entrance into the sea it is diminished to 200 or 300 feet. Loch Etive, in Scotland, is nearly walled in at its mouth by a reef, over which the entering and receding tide fads like a cataract. There is scarce a lake bed in any part of the world which does not present similar obstacles to the theory, and they are immensely increased in the case of such a de pression as the Dead Sea, whose surface is sunken 1300 feet below the Mediterranean, with the further obstacle of a watershed intervening in the vadey of the Ghor, between it and the Bed Sea, to in tercept an outflow in that direction.

Existing glacier beds, as a rule, would not hold lakes. Their rocky sides and bottom are always on a slope open at their lower extremity, generally assuming a spoon-shaped curve. Glaciers certainly never form vertical precipices, such as those which wad in the Lakes of Lucerne, Garda, Wadenstadt, and many others. But here the question arises, can it be shown that there is any essential difference between river and lake valleys ? They are both channels for running water, which, in the case of lakes, is arrested for a time by hodows deeper than the average level of the bed of the passing stream. The course of all great rivers among mountains is virtuady a succession of gorges and basins ; if the gorges were closed the basins above them would become lakes.

One of the most potent agencies counted on by geologists for modifying the surface of our planet is Denudation. It is defined by them to mean the removal of solid matter by water in motion, includ ing rain, frost, rivers, and sea-waves. It surpasses ad other modern causes in the power that it is said to be stid exerting, and in the effects it produces. The wonders which it has performed and is performing are best set forth in the very words of its advocates. \" Mountains and valleys are due to it; it has carved them out of the sodd rock.

The difficulty, however, seems to lie not in the great amount of Denudation, which without doubt has made its mighty influence felt in ad parts of the 1 Chambers's Geology, by Geikie, pp. 74 and 77. 2 Geikie, Scenery of Scotland, pp. 8 and 12. 3 Chambers's Geology, p. 75. 4 Ramsay's Physical Geology of Great Britain, p. 35."], [120, "88 SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY.

A disciple of this school must indeed be gifted with faith without measure before he could admit the possibdity of removing even such a mountain as Ben Nevis, not quite one mile high, by rain and frost above, aided by all the seabreakers that could be brought to bear on its base. It is needful, therefore, to inquire how this pro cess of rasping down the face of nature is carried on, whether these smad agents are ready effecting such changes, and in what way their power, such as it is, is applied. Weather, that is to say frost far more than raiu, is a potent cause of disintegrating surfaces of rocks, especiady those of slaty texture or jointed, so as to admit water into their interstices, which are burst open through its expansion by intense cold. But even at the greatest heights, where frost has its utmost sway, the mountain peaks and crags are covered with perennial lichens which preserve the surface from further corrosion. Such a coating envelopes the hoary blocks of Stonehenge, and has defied the storms of at least a thousand years. Where the softer nature of a rock allows the crumbling"], [121, "CHAP. VII.

There is scarce a radway cutting which does not furnish proof of this by the rapid clothing of its bare sides. There are two objections to the denudation of the Weald by atmospheric causes ; the chalk of the Downs, which form its N. and S. margin, though one of the softest rocks, yields to the weather less than granite, because it is so quickly covered with turf, which is virtuady indestructible and impregnable to atmospheric de nudation. The turf-clad barrows on Salisbury Plain have preserved thed prehistoric surfaces and out dne unchanged for thousands of years, while wads of stoutest masonry have crumbled. Secondly, there is no trace of beach or shingle ** at the base of the chalk escarpments, such as must inevitably have been left there had they ever been washed by sea waves. Nature has thus set a decided limit to the denud ing influences of frost and rain, for before they can penetrate to any great depth in rock surfaces vegetation interposes and disintegration is stopped.

These consoling facts, and the knowledge of the very large proportion of earth's surface which is covered by vegetation, may appease any alarm occasioned by geological exaggeration as to the present progress of denudation under mere atmospheric waste now in operation. The impotence of sub-aeriel agencies coidd not be better proved than by the engraving still indelibly fixed by glacial erosion on rocks so hard as to resist the growth of lichens, on which the finest lines are preserved in defiance of weather, as perfect as the day in which they were scratched, which the geolo gists wid tell us is not less than 30,000, perhaps than 100,000 years ago.

Nevertheless, the story of this clean sweep of mountains of strata was at once accepted by De la Beche, Lyed, Geikie, and others,1 and is now part of the geological creed, and incor porated in elementary works on geology. If we inquire what is the evidence that such masses of strata were so removed, or even that they ever existed, it rests solely upon geological diagrams, drawn by a process which is described as \" protract ing in imagination.\" 2 The gifted Government 1 De la Beche, Geol.

Director of the Geological Survey, not satisfied with producing sections of the actual strata as they exist, was tempted to \"join up the disrupted edges of the beds in conformity with the known normal curves de duced from accurately observed normal dips.\" ' But it is evident that in drawing these curves a varia tion in the angle, almost microscopical in amount, or a sdght twist of the compasses in protracting the curves, would convert hundreds of feet into thousands. No wonder that mountains so readily and fancifully created should be washed out by equady fanciful agencies. But besides this, it is highly probable that these contorted and uplifted strata, for all we know, may have been run up into many small plies or folds instead of one or two exorbitant or impossible curves. The flexibdity also of stratified rock has its limits ; and the pheno menon may be accounted for by the outer bands of strata breaking in the act of flexure long before the up lifted curve was compressed into an arch. The author of this theory of lofty curves seems to have been by no means sure of its adoption, and he propounded it with a diffidence and modesty which commands our commendation. He, as every other geologist, must perceive the risk of distortion and exaggera- 1 Geological Survey of Great Britain, vol. i."], [129, "97 CHAP. VII.

When he finds certain strata diving down below the surface he has often to seek for their upthrow at very great distances, the intervening space being covered with vast superficial deposits, not to be penetrated. How can he be sure that he has not passed over the missing ends of the strata which may possibly be buried beneath ? If he fancies he recognises the same rock many miles off, can he positively identify it, knowing how constantly rocks are modified; how, even when identical in mineral composition and occurring in contact, they differ widely in age ? These and other difficulties constantly make it a hopeless task for the geological surveyor to define the boundaries of strata, and to delineate the structure of a country, and ought to make us very cautious in bedeving that which may turn out after all to be not a fact but only an un safe inference. But may not the gaps, and voids in the con tinidty of dislocated strata, be accounted for in another way ? If we take into account the shrink age of rocks at the time of cooling, and the recoil of the strata at the moment of fracture, it is toler ably certain the edges of the strata stretched to the utmost degree of tension previous to breaking ii"], [130, "98 SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY.

This redeves us from the necessity of supposing that the whole area between the escarpments of the N. and S. Downs was ever covered by a continuous bed of chalk. Moreover, the ingenious Professor Bamsay has pro longed his curves into the air until he could drop them down, so as to cap some other outcrop of the same strata, regardless of the probable destruction and entire disappearance of intervening beds, which may have sdpped through in the general concussion at the moment of the uplifting of whole ranges of hills. But over and above the sweeping away of masses of strata piled mdes up into the sky, weather, frost, and running water, are credited by the younger geo logists with the power of carving ad mountains and vadeys out of the solid block of the primitive table lands.1 Let us apply this to Mont Blanc, with its twelve mdes array of peaks and precipices, and inquire what has become of the chips and fragments which this subacrial hammer and chisel work could not have faded to leave behind ?

But mountain peaks and ridges by their very shape proclaim their hardness and power of resisting the weather.

How came the sides of vadeys to stand, while the centres were swept away, and have vanished ? We know that weather acts equably upon ad rock-sur faces exposed to it, consisting of similar strata, and placed under the same conditions of exposure. Sir Charles Lyed1 has too readdy taken for granted that the largest and deepest valleys are in rocks which yield most readily to the atmosphere. The reverse is so often the case as to be a strong argument against erosion. The very deep vadey of the Dee, in Aberdeenshire, is riven through granite, and that of Chamounix, the deepest in Europe, in rocks of the hardest crystadine texture. Where then are we to seek for an explanation which wid relieve geology from these discordant improbabdities ?

To appreciate this power we must dismiss from our minds the trivial workings of modern glaciers confined to deep sunken beds, down which they descend with a slow motion and with a moderate erosive action. The phenomena before us are inconsistent with the supposition of a gradual retirement and diminu tion of the ice covering, which geologists hitherto have taken for granted. We have to consider the effect of a sudden transition from total glaciation, due to a change of temperature, and the consequent melting of a body of ice covering \\v_ry mountain and hdly region, combined with the additional weight and force which such huge bodies would acquire from 1 See de Salis' Ueber Erratischen Erscheinungen im Rhein- Gebiet, 1875.

It appears probable that the state of glaciation fodowed close upon, if it was not the result of, the cooling down of the earth from a molten state, the first consequence of which was the universal fracturing of its crust, described in Chapter iv. Thus, from the extreme of heat the globe may have passed to the extreme of cold, a prelude to oscillations of cdmate, constantly diminishing, un td the happy mean of temperature which we now enjoy was attained. Glaciation, therefore, must have taken possession of a fractured but unpolished world, of those deep fissures encumbered with moun tain fragments, and strata bent into curves or broken short off with spdntered edges, great part of which it was destined to smooth down or clear away. No one, so far as we can call to mind, has taken the trouble to consider by what steps and stages the earth was redeved from this general incrustation of thick ribbed ice. It must have been due of course, in the first instance, to a change of climate. A sdght increase of temperature acting upon so wide an expanse of ice and snow would set torrents running equal to the largest European rivers, capable of"], [139, "105 CHAP. VIII.

Most of these would fodow the openings in the fissured rocks which we have described as the rude troughs of future valleys, but great part of the icy coating of the upper tableland would slough off in enormous cakes, acres in extent, over the shoulders and down the mountain sides. We have proof that the ice masses we have to deal with were not dmited to glaciers, deep sunk in channels prepared for them, moving downwards a few inches per diem. We must face the problem of a continent of ice, superimposed upon a vast mountain area, suddenly released from peaks and precipices, and hurled downwards in every direc tion in which the force of gravity could conduct it, in the form of colossal avalanches, and ice sdps loaded with debris of rock exceeding that of the fad of the Bossberg, and starting from infinitely greater eleva tions. From this, and from the greatness of the masses, some faint ideas may be formed of the force they would exercise in concussing, pounding, fracturing, and sweeping away the obstacles in their course. Not that the rush of the debacle would long continue uninterrupted. The fragments of faden mountains, the reefs of fractured and up turned strata lying in the way, the discharges of constantly recurring avalanches of overwhelming"], [140, "106 SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY.

It wdl assist us to understand the occur rences inseparable from such a state of things if we refer to accidents of a similar kind, though r \u2022 an infinitely smader scale, which produce the * e barriers on the St. Lawrence, St. John's, and other rivers in N. America, and in Europe at times on the Bhine and Danube. In the spring of some years the ice breaks up in the upper course of the river before the thaw has set in below ; and floats down untd ar rested by ice stid unmelted. The constantly accumu lating blocks and floes, driven by the strong current against this obstacle, are not only pded one over the other, but are sunken, and packed into one sodd watertight dam, stretching across from side to side, and taking the shape of the river-bed, which it entirely fills. This impervious barrier lasts untd a further thaw, or the accumulated weight of water behind, aided by the cutting power of the overflow upon ice, bursts the dam. \" The river goes,\" sweeping all before it, and wdd work ensues.

Those acquainted with the properties of glacier ice, the ir~tantaneous cohesion of its surfaces, however sudden tht contact, its flexibidty and elasticity in masses, wid easdy comprehend the rapid formation of these ice barriers, \u2014 -indeed the impossibdity of such large masses of ice disengaging themselves from their cradle on the high plateaux without forming them.

At the openings of secondary vadeys minor glaciers protruding across, and even pushed up the opposite heights, woidd also effectuady bar the passage of the descending deluge of ice, water, rocks, and mud. Thus the accumulation, though enormous, would be let down step by step. Lakes would be formed one after another at different heights and in ad ddections, filling the main vadeys, and ramdying back into thed tributaries, at times overflowing lateral ridges.

With such a variety of impediments, so large a mass of ice could not be speeddy removed. The Arctic climate, which such an enormous body of ice pre supposes, granting the alternations of seasons, and the return of winters of far greater severity than at present, would continuady reconvert into ice the rushing torrents let loose by summer heat, so that this state of tldngs must have lasted for an indefinite time before the pristine glaciation could have been reduced to its present limits. At such a time, and under such circumstances, the Lake of Geneva was joined to those of Morat, Bienne, and Neuchatel, forming a great inland sea, stretching N. to the base of the Jura, and S. up the Ehone to Martigny. Beyond the Jura another lake may have occupied the whole space between the Vosges and Black Forest hids, as far as the gorge of the Bingen Loch, then perhaps recently opened, but stid choked with debris.

It has not only been proved that mountain chains are not raised by them, but made probable that their shock is arrested by mountains ; while, so far from opening gorges and valleys, they are powerless to effect even a fracture 1 in solid rock ; that whatever slight displacement of low alluvial land or rocks of recent formation may arise from one shock is undone by the next, and that they have left no permanent marks behind, except the devastation of human constructions. It is impossible to overrate the importance of the testimony of Mr. Madet, who, so to speak, has studied earthquakes both in theory and practice, that \" An earthquake, how ever great, is incapable of producing any permanent elevation or depression of land whatever.\" Limited as earthquakes are in action and area, they cannot disturb the general evidence we discover everywhere on the face of Nature of former disturbance and present tranquidity.

The redance of modern geology upon such feeble and inadequate agencies to produce such enormous results may perhaps be accounted for by the fact that a teacher of this new phdosophy assures us both that time is power, and that to attri bute great effects to great causes is a prejudice.2 1 Chambers's Geology, p. 77. 2 \" We make the fatal error of forgetting that in the geo logical history of our globe time is power. \u2014 It may not be"], [149, "115 CHAP.

An attempt has been made in the foregoing pages to explain what was the real cause of Denudation, and to refer it to phenomena which, fortunately for the existence of man, cannot be numbered among causes now in operation. We have also endeavoured to show that other causes besides modern denuda tions, or upheaval, or earthquakes and volcanoes may have been instrumental in forming mountains and vadey7s ; that they are possibly the result not so much of a dfting up as of a throwing down of the earth's crust, of a rending and crumpdng together caused by contraction and recoil, of a horizontal rather than a vertical movement, and are at ad events not due to any lifting power of volcanic action.

Is it indeed a bit more difficult to believe than that mountains are created and dkewise washed away by rain, water, etc. etc.? At ad events the forces, whatever their nature, which made the existing mountains and opened the vadeys, were directed to a consistent purpose, tending to a common result. They did not, as we have seen the earthquakes do,1 throw down merely to raise up again after a few years ; they opened up water-courses instead of obstructing them, promoted the circulation of water instead of damming it up into stagnant pools producing order in the world, and not confusion, such as the destruction of Lisbon, the wasting of Calabria and Java.

IX. believe in modern causes must accept as the certain result of their action that we owe to earthquakes in a great degree the perpetuation, nay the very exist ence of the habitable earth.1 They must acquiesce in a redistribution of land and water, as it is caded, as now going forwrard \u2014 that is to say, the sea is to replace the land, the land the sea ; they must admit that the land is gradually but certainly being washed into the ocean ; that denudation, undoing at one moment what it has done at another,3 may be destined to work away, \" in the long ages of the future, until it has worn down the solid land, and mountains and glens have alike disappeared.\"3 A phdosopher, no less eminent than Playfair, even calculated the time it wdl take to transfer the whole of the dry land into the bosom of the ocean ; and, though he did not arrive at \"safe conclusions,\" bolder men have been found of late, who, with \" more exactness,\" assert that the whole globe is 1 \" Subterranean movements ... are essential to the well being of the habitable surface, and even the very existence of terrestrial species.\" \u2014 Lyell's Principles, ii. p. 243. 2 \" Thus the final result of atmospheric denudation is to de stroy the features which itself gave rise to ; so the end of its action is to plane everything down to a uniform level.\" \u2014 Green, Geology for Students, 1876. 3 Geikie, Scenery of Scotland, p. 115."], [157, "EARTH REDUCED TO A DEAD LEVEL. 123 CHAP.

The result, then, of the most approved geological phdosophy is to reduce the great globe, and ad that it inherit, to a dead level ! ! ** unless by the antagon istic aid of igneous causes the unevenness of earth's surface can be restored* \u2014 truly a difficult task, con sidering that whde atmospheric effects operate over the whole globe, volcanoes are dmited to about 1-5 00th part of it ! ! - The modern Huttonians lay it down as profouncdy unphdosophical that the energies of nature should be supposed to have been greater at the creation of the globe than at present. Is there then any inconsistency in supposing that when a potter moulds a vase out of a lump of clay he should put forth his greatest energy 1 Lyell's Principles, i. p. 327 : \" The aqueous agents are incessantly labouring to reduce the inequalities of the earth's surface to a level.\" See also Principles, ii. pp. 237-239. \" So great is the denudation of the land, that in process of time the whole would be planed down to the level of the sea, were it not for the subterranean forces.\" \u2014 Geikie's Geology p. 77."], [158, "124 SCEPTICISM IN GEOLOGY.

That the work of the creation of the earth was one of perfection defies ad disproof. What need then to imagine that it was done by little and little ; least of all can we admit a solution of the problem of cosmogony involving the absurdity that the work was left unfinished, and needs constant alteration by means of certain mechanical self acting operations. The theory of natural develop ment in other branches of natural history, whether true or false, at least infers improvement of structure and conformation. Appded to geology, it ends in deterioration, monotony, and stagnation. According to it the earth is to be planed smooth and bare, deprived of ad that makes it beautdul, useful, and habitable ; converted into one monotonous plain, barely capable of keeping its head above water, save by the aid of occasional earthquakes ! ! \" The hunger of the mind to see every natural occurrence resting upon a cause,\" and the vanity of bedeving (spite of man's finite capacity) that modern science can account for and explain everything, ap pear to de at the bottom of the confidence reposed in the Theory of Modern Causes. Yet there is"], [159, "125 CHAP. IX. CONCLUSION. to hope that the more geology is studied in an earnest spirit, free from the mirage of attractive but shadowy hypotheses, the more it will be acknowledged that not blind force, however gentle, nor mechanical impulses, however gradual, rendered our planet what we find it. It will eventuady be acknowledged that at the time and in the process of fashioning the globe, a power was exerted totally different from the present course of nature ; that, in fact, it is not inconsistent with logical conclusions to hold that an act of creation may differ essentiady from one of maintenance and conservation."], [160, "126 POSTSCRIPT. \u2014 GAPING FISSURES. POSTSCRIPT.\u2014 GAPING FISSURES. Since the foregoing pages were in print, we have met with the following passage in a new edition of Mr. Geikie's Great Ice Age, lately published : \u2014 \" Do lakes lie in gaping fissures or in chasms produced by dislocations of the solid rocks, or, as they are technically termed, faults ? As a matter of fact, no single instance has yet been adduced, either at home or abroad, where a fault could be said to be the proximate cause of a lake-hollow.\" ' We were about to raise a protest against this dog matic assertion when we were re-assured by discovering the following explanation or modification of it on the page following, though this rider to the new edition of the work had nearly escaped our notice again in the modest retirement and small type of a footnote : \u2014 \" It may be well to remind the reader that I am speak ing of the carboniferous areas of the west of Scotland. I am very far from affirming that faults have never in any case given the initial direction to a line of drainage. I could mention a number of instances where they have certainly done so. A good case in point is Glenapp, in the south of Ayrshire, which coincides with a large frac ture. Again, the north-east and south-west fault that traverses Scotland from the shores of the Firth of Forth 1 Geikie's Great lee Age, New Edition, 1876, p. 272."], [161, "POSTSCRIPT. \u2014 GAPING FISSURES. 127 to the Irish Sea, gives rise in many places to a distinct feature, and streams occasionally follow it for some dis tance. The Great Glen would also appear to be in a line of dislocation. I have never seen, and would travel a long way to see, a gaping fault.\"1 An author who shows so laudable a desire to be set right, even at the expense of a considerable journey, may be glad to be informed of the existence of gaping faults, \u2014 1st, in the Dead Sea; 2d, in the Lake of Lucerne * or, d he declines to go so far from home, 3 d, in the gorges of the Avon at Bath and Clifton, also in Colebrook Dale. 1 Geikie, The Great Ice Age, p. 273."], [162, ""], [163, "INDEX.
