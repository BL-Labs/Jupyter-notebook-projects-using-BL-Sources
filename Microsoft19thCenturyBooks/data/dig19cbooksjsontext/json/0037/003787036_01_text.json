In order that the Mineral Resources of the Colony may be illus trated as completely as under present circumstances is possible, at the forthcoming Intercolonial Exhibition, the Minerals and Rocks which have been presented from time to time to this Department by Prospectors, Miners, Mining Surveyors, and others, have been carefully arranged, and labelled and numbered. With this Catalogue in his hand, anyone may easily find the Specimen he seeks ; but it is to be understood that no attempt has been made to classify the Minerals and Rocks. As valuable addi tions are made every day, it would be premature to do this ; and no good purpose, at this stage, would be served by it. The Specimens of Quartz, showing tbe character of the Reefs throughout the country, are very valuable and interesting ; and, when the Collection is complete, the Mineralogist will be in a good position to compare and contrast the several kinds of gold bearing quartz, and to arrive at safe conclusions regarding them. As much as hand specimens can teach, he will be able to learn. The thanks of the Department are due to those gentlemen named in the Catalogue, who have freely given their time and labor to the work of collecting specimens. R. BROUGH SMYTH, Secretary for Mines.

At Icolmkill, in Scotland, nephritic pebbles are found on the shore in great abundance, having been originally disseminated through a limestone, which has long ago been wrought out. In India, axe heads, ornaments, &c, are manufactured from jade. Vessels made from this material are as sonorous as porcelain. The natives of New Zealand fashion jade or nephrite into many fantastic shapes, hatchets, ornaments, &c., of which the accom panying specimen is an excellent example.
